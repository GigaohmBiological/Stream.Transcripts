WEBVTT

01:39.315 --> 01:55.588
Highway run into the midnight sun Wheels go round and round on my mind Restless hearts sleep alone tonight

02:06.203 --> 02:33.190
Sending all my love along the wire They say that the road ain't no place for a star to find me Right down the line it's me, you and me And loving a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be

02:35.786 --> 02:44.975
Oh girl, you stand by me I'm forever yours Faithfully

03:04.390 --> 03:27.635
Circus life Under the beach of the world We all need the clowns to make us smile Through space and time Always another show

03:31.733 --> 03:58.443
Wondering where I am lost without you And being a part of you just never felt The true strangers meant to fall in love again I get the joy of rediscovering you

04:01.211 --> 04:08.355
Oh girl, you stand by me I'm forever yours If only

06:01.676 --> 06:03.237
I think truth is good for kids.

06:03.657 --> 06:07.518
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

06:07.958 --> 06:09.579
We want everybody to feel good.

06:09.599 --> 06:11.960
That's not, that's not the way life is.

06:14.501 --> 06:18.462
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

06:20.223 --> 06:20.923
And I have lied.

06:20.943 --> 06:22.024
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:22.044 --> 06:24.785
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.945
I try not to be a liar.

06:25.965 --> 06:26.786
I don't want to be a liar.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.047
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:32.228 --> 06:52.420
introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.682
And then each of us is

06:58.055 --> 07:02.038
that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

07:05.780 --> 07:11.384
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

07:12.419 --> 07:24.312
Until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone and you know, it's it's not it's you know measles plus and I can tolerate what you think about measles because You know not that many people die from it.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.554
It's it's just a big hassle in the end

07:28.556 --> 07:42.906
No, when we have this new pandemic that's got 75% mortality, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

07:42.966 --> 07:45.468
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.651
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:49.671 --> 07:51.552
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.774
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:53.794 --> 07:55.695
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:55.715 --> 07:57.617
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:57.637 --> 07:59.618
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

07:59.638 --> 08:02.500
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.522
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.663
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:06.683 --> 08:10.126
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:10.286 --> 08:13.789
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that the deal is essentially a worst-case scenario.

08:13.809 --> 08:14.169
I'm afraid that

08:15.489 --> 08:26.496
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

08:27.197 --> 08:32.060
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

08:32.600 --> 08:37.243
I don't understand what the issue.

08:37.263 --> 08:38.444
I see.

08:38.464 --> 08:41.506
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

08:41.546 --> 08:42.667
No, it depends on how they use it.

08:44.532 --> 08:47.015
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

08:49.498 --> 08:51.461
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

08:51.541 --> 08:57.588
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

08:57.628 --> 08:59.330
This is all textbook stuff you're asking.

08:59.390 --> 09:00.232
Stop lying!

09:02.114 --> 09:03.516
Stop lying!

09:06.454 --> 09:06.674
The End

09:28.775 --> 09:32.639
My kids actually found me a plush toy virus at the bookstore the other day.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.662
They were at the used bookstore and my kid came back.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.544
Papa, you're not going to believe what we found.

09:37.584 --> 09:39.586
We found you a coronavirus plush toy.

09:40.266 --> 09:41.688
It is not from event 201.

10:02.612 --> 10:03.953
So here we are again.

10:03.973 --> 10:06.034
I'm going to turn the music down a little bit.

10:06.054 --> 10:08.695
Everybody's complaining that my music is too loud.

10:09.535 --> 10:14.997
So I'm turning it down a little bit, and I'm putting my voice up a little bit, even if it's a little loud in my ears.

10:15.757 --> 10:19.279
Trying to break the enchantment here with a little bit of work on the past.

10:19.919 --> 10:29.063
I've told you many times before that there's evidence on the internet still available, even on YouTube, that can teach us what really happened.

10:29.143 --> 10:31.104
All you got to do is go back and look for it.

10:31.744 --> 10:48.847
The truth is actually available many different angles on it and tonight I really want to dig into one angle that I think is really important and that is early 2021 Malone and Associates because this is when they were still

10:50.080 --> 10:59.503
jockeying for position, boxing people out, trying to make sure that people didn't catch on to the idea that there was no spread in New York City.

10:59.603 --> 11:03.465
They didn't want anyone to catch on to the idea of what virology really was.

11:04.045 --> 11:09.767
They didn't want anyone to think of the idea that placebos could be used to really make this work.

11:10.387 --> 11:19.330
And they definitely didn't want you to know that transfection was a technology that was on Robert Malone's resume for more than a decade.

11:21.158 --> 11:30.387
And that's also why they don't want you talking about all the ways that the protocols were murdered, especially that pesky, that pesky, give them as much as you want of the oxygen thing.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.532
If you are, if you are at all interested.

11:35.953 --> 11:43.655
If you are at all interested in that Oxygen story, I can highly recommend the last episode of Housatonic Live.

11:44.196 --> 11:51.638
It is just a spectacular breakdown of the oddities of this story and the people that were involved in it.

11:51.798 --> 11:56.839
It seems highly unlikely that this wasn't an integral part of the Scooby-Doo.

11:59.335 --> 12:12.679
and all of these people, all of them are starting to attribute bad motives to being marked, bad motives to the people that are really trying to figure it out and instead they want you to be stuck on the scooby-doo, stuck on the mystery.

12:13.740 --> 12:17.781
Solving the mystery seems to be what the weaponized piles of money want us to do.

12:18.561 --> 12:22.343
Blaming the shots on the United States seems to be what the

12:23.283 --> 12:26.926
the weaponized piles of money want the Five Eyes countries to do.

12:27.367 --> 12:37.575
I think there is a real motion right now of these weaponized piles of money to push people to be convinced about the origins of the virus.

12:38.516 --> 12:42.199
I think these people, by participating in this argument, are in the trap.

12:43.320 --> 12:51.187
And I think this theater spans all the way to people like Robert Malone, Jessica Rose, and many, many more.

12:53.542 --> 13:05.727
It is not to be taken lightly how much of this entire theater has been controlled by their participants, their players.

13:07.228 --> 13:13.791
And how much of this mythology we've been forced to accept because we thought we were solving a mystery and they were helping us.

13:15.312 --> 13:17.373
Not just this guy and his minions.

13:19.562 --> 13:26.784
Not just the people that are pushing all the transhuman agenda, but the people who are purported to be fighting against it.

13:27.364 --> 13:36.866
Even some of the people that purported to stand up against the AIDS virus and the AIDS epidemic were likely put there on purpose because they already knew.

13:37.486 --> 13:39.686
They already knew how to govern us with this stuff.

13:39.726 --> 13:42.207
They already knew that we were bamboozled.

13:42.247 --> 13:46.988
They already knew that they had charlatan power over us and they were never going to give it back.

13:47.848 --> 13:53.212
And so when the AIDS thing, you know, was done, they had another thing coming and another thing coming.

13:53.272 --> 14:04.799
And now with social media, we have given an unprecedented power over our lives to these charlatans and these, these charlatans.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.881
And maybe I'm wrong about some of these people.

14:07.921 --> 14:09.322
That's why they're circled in yellow.

14:09.863 --> 14:11.764
But some of them I'm damn sure about.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.426
And if we want to make gentle,

14:16.806 --> 14:28.869
If we want to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of their mythology, we are going to need to be able to see how amazing the artificial wave of consensus is.

14:29.609 --> 14:31.189
It's going away from the deep water.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.270
It's perfect all the way across.

14:33.710 --> 14:41.072
It's a great wave for kids to imagine that they're learning the ocean and that they're participating in the ocean.

14:42.162 --> 14:53.685
But this is not a dangerous wave because it goes away from the shallow, because it's not an unusual random wave, but it is a very orchestrated wave of consensus.

14:53.765 --> 14:55.526
And so your children are fooled by it.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.467
They think they understand what's going on in the world.

14:58.967 --> 15:04.408
And in order for them to see this wave of consensus, you've got to teach them the true biology and stay focused on it.

15:04.948 --> 15:07.509
You've got to not take their bait on social media.

15:07.529 --> 15:10.270
That's thinking about all the questions they want you to ask.

15:11.110 --> 15:35.849
while not asking the right ones and you gotta teach your kids to love their neighbors because they need friends and we need communities to bounce back especially in America and so that's why this is a special message all the time for Americans even though of course I feel solidarity with everyone around the world who was subject to this multinational

15:37.110 --> 16:01.040
intelligence operation where they convinced us that a pandemic happened when indeed it did not when indeed it's it's biologically not only implausible but I think impossible and so we're gonna spend most of this summer trying to sort these ideas out and try to get them succinctly expressed so that we can share them with our family and friends right after the right after the election when we have their attention

16:03.083 --> 16:03.904
That's the idea.

16:05.305 --> 16:09.247
Giga Home Biological is a stream that's been around for about four years now.

16:09.267 --> 16:20.855
It started out as a YouTube channel being made by a research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and it transitioned into a channel about a lab leak.

16:22.076 --> 16:33.022
thinking that I was solving the mystery myself and after four years of trying to solve that mystery I've kind of pulled my head out and realized that the national security operation was a script.

16:33.742 --> 16:46.289
It was a script designed to make us solve that mystery and then teach our kids that mythology and I think there's a chance that we can have a huge paradigm shift and that people will understand that public health has always been a grift

16:47.535 --> 16:55.441
and that we can reorient our societies toward cleaner environments and cleaner food and more decentralized communities.

16:56.041 --> 17:13.753
But if we're going to do this, and we're going to start to advocate for that kind of sovereignty, we're going to have to pull our hands away from our eyes, we're going to have to drop our phones, we're going to have to take Twitter and these kinds of things off of our phones, and we're going to have to participate in them in a very, very controlled manner.

17:14.634 --> 17:19.077
Because if the idea is to engage in united non-compliance, it's got to be informed.

17:19.917 --> 17:29.003
Because united non-compliance that is basically fueled by their narratives or their mythologies, we're never going to really usefully escape.

17:30.264 --> 17:36.688
And so this is GigaOM Biological, and hopefully together we're going to find a way to get out of this trap.

17:37.289 --> 17:37.749
That's what I hope.

17:41.903 --> 17:42.183
so

18:06.660 --> 18:07.521
Good evening, everybody.

18:07.581 --> 18:09.922
It's 511 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

18:09.942 --> 18:11.923
I'm coming to you live from my garage as usual.

18:11.963 --> 18:16.706
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.647
It is the 6th of July, 2024.

18:19.367 --> 18:24.890
We are four and a half years into this multinational security operation.

18:25.891 --> 18:30.814
I'm wearing my 2014 10-year-old HeliMasters hat from the Netherlands.

18:31.634 --> 18:32.615
I used to be a pretty

18:33.956 --> 18:41.030
a pretty competent beginner RC helicopter pilot.

18:41.070 --> 18:44.296
And I can still fly, and I still fly in the sim occasionally, but...

18:45.649 --> 18:47.170
I used to be an incredible enthusiast.

18:47.190 --> 18:52.834
That's why I played that video in the introduction in case you're wondering what in the hell was that thing flying around.

18:53.395 --> 18:55.997
It was a helicopter, a 700 size helicopter.

18:56.037 --> 18:57.358
It's about six feet across.

18:58.619 --> 19:02.522
The blades are very, very much big enough to decapitate the user.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.384
And he was flying in a 3D way so that the

19:07.305 --> 19:16.896
the blades can turn either way and so that the helicopter can be blowing or sucking depending on what you're doing there and so the helicopter can fly upside down and do all the crazy things you saw there.

19:16.916 --> 19:26.487
It takes an incredible amount of 3D spatial awareness and hand-eye coordination that I think is one of the highest examples of

19:27.268 --> 19:30.349
of sort of human neuronal hand-eye coordination.

19:31.369 --> 19:37.671
There are only a handful of people that can fly at that level and certainly with that amount of precision that some of those guys fly with.

19:37.771 --> 19:48.575
Anyway, it was a very fascinating thing for me to always think about trying to get a few of those guys inside of an MRI machine while they were flying in the sim to see if you could process what parts of their brain were working.

19:50.035 --> 19:52.357
I don't know, that was just a pipe dream a long, long time ago.

19:52.437 --> 19:54.178
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a human just like you.

19:54.259 --> 19:54.919
I've got kids.

19:54.959 --> 19:55.640
I've got a wife.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.441
I forgot it was my anniversary today.

19:58.582 --> 20:02.645
And so I apologize, Phila, you still remain the number one.

20:03.897 --> 20:04.777
Of course, you know that.

20:04.877 --> 20:09.458
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

20:09.958 --> 20:13.499
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

20:13.579 --> 20:20.000
Unfortunately, V, these ideas are likely to be a part of our lives for the rest of it.

20:21.161 --> 20:28.302
Hopefully, they will also be good enough and their compadres will be good enough to carry us through to our old age.

20:28.342 --> 20:29.222
I love you very much.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.023
I love you very much, V.

20:33.424 --> 20:36.966
These people need to be called out for what they are.

20:37.006 --> 20:40.267
They were positioned very early in the pandemic.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.448
They were put on podcasts.

20:42.468 --> 20:45.049
They were put in front of people all around social media.

20:45.069 --> 20:57.035
And what you need to see is Bret Weinstein and Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein and the Rubin Report and all of these sort of

20:58.422 --> 21:09.689
mid-level podcasters that have gone from being relatively nobody on the internet to being relatively prominent on these Rumble and Locals and YouTube and they're everywhere.

21:10.430 --> 21:17.134
And so these are not spontaneous entrepreneurs working in the back of their garage like me.

21:17.535 --> 21:18.875
These are people with staff.

21:18.936 --> 21:20.156
These are people with funding.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.537
These are people with sponsors.

21:21.557 --> 21:26.501
These are people that most importantly were put in place so that people like

21:27.441 --> 21:38.591
like Kevin McKernan would have a place to go and talk so that an illusion of consensus about what questions needed to be asked and what are the likely answers could be created on the internet with these podcasts.

21:38.752 --> 21:40.253
And there's not just a few of them.

21:40.673 --> 21:41.834
It's not just Rogan.

21:42.523 --> 21:44.184
That's the trick you need to understand.

21:44.684 --> 22:05.912
Many, many, many of these podcasters are witting or unwitting participants in this illusion because they have entertained and listened to these people and haven't had the biological knowledge, the background, or the insight to see that these people are coordinatedly lying about the potential for RNA to pandemic when in fact there is none.

22:07.287 --> 22:11.850
Now the reason why this is so important is because the way that they do it is in teams.

22:11.930 --> 22:18.474
And oftentimes it is Americans working in partnership with people from the UK or other Five Eyes countries.

22:18.934 --> 22:24.078
And I have been subjected to this more than several times during the course of the last four and a half years.

22:24.498 --> 22:32.083
The latest example of it is an American by the name of Jessica Hockett and a UK guy by the name of Jonathan Engler and their associates.

22:32.563 --> 22:51.188
The behavior of these people in Twitter messages and in audio messages on my phone over the last nine or 10 months has led me to come to the conclusion that they were always working in concert to convince me to accept certain people as being people that would be good conduits for my information.

22:51.588 --> 22:57.650
Good conduits to look to as ways to get the word of my biology out.

22:57.750 --> 23:00.611
And then they obfuscated everything that I was doing

23:01.431 --> 23:10.515
and obfuscated our collaboration for like nine months, representing them as part of my team, or on my side, or whatever you want to call it.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.517
But in reality, on Twitter, they promoted each other.

23:15.239 --> 23:20.283
And on Twitter and on their sub stacks, they promoted each other.

23:20.924 --> 23:36.717
And they minimized my role and impact in their understanding of the biology, even though they came to me under the pretense that I had the unique insight, which helped them finally tie a lot of loose ends together, but nevermind telling anybody that it was me who did that.

23:38.356 --> 24:00.884
And so once that ruse was broken, because Jessica Hockett made a couple very interesting, what I think must be bungles or mistakes in a text message to Mark and a proton mail to me that I just happened to not read until its effect couldn't, until the only thing it was, was evidence of her mistake.

24:03.001 --> 24:11.990
And so the lucky thing is, is that when you look back on these conversations that they chose to have on Twitter via DM, I can publish those whenever I want to.

24:12.651 --> 24:25.263
And the contents of those conversations are often very revealing, because despite the fact that I might protest that someone of their circle is making a very bad statement, why don't you call them out?

24:26.204 --> 24:29.987
they would always defend those people saying, you know, there's lots of different opinions.

24:30.047 --> 24:30.807
She's really great.

24:30.867 --> 24:32.868
I don't want to, I don't want to correct her.

24:33.229 --> 24:38.292
But with me, it was either promote them or we're going to ignore you.

24:38.872 --> 24:40.894
Right with us or we're going to ignore you.

24:41.014 --> 24:43.355
And this is just the latest manifestation of it.

24:43.395 --> 24:47.218
I was also part of the Steve Kirsch steering committee, this kind of thing.

24:47.618 --> 24:53.081
And so I think these study halls are really important because again, here you have what I would consider a

24:54.851 --> 24:56.732
The best description would be a traitor.

24:56.792 --> 25:16.483
This is somebody who was listening to me argue very vigorously that he had to start calling it transfection as soon as possible and explain to people how simple transfection was and that it was a product line in several biotech companies for the decade before the pandemic along with transformation.

25:17.543 --> 25:27.605
And yet here he is today responding to somebody who happens to mention that I actually was credited on their podcast as saying it should be a transfection and called that.

25:27.665 --> 25:29.666
And they agreed with me, but then never did it.

25:31.226 --> 25:34.387
And here he is saying, yeah, it's the right word, but it's not widely understood.

25:34.407 --> 25:38.328
And then a third person says, well, make it understood that just a thought.

25:40.108 --> 25:42.629
And I don't want to be a creep, but I was saying that to Brett in 2021.

25:46.058 --> 25:49.740
Right up until he said that he didn't think that 30 minutes on Zoom would help.

25:52.062 --> 25:55.964
That he wouldn't understand me any better with a few minutes on Zoom.

25:58.186 --> 25:59.807
So I just, I forgot.

25:59.887 --> 26:04.609
I mean, I just, I'd walked out of that signal chat assuming that they were just playing me the whole time.

26:04.649 --> 26:09.112
What was I doing there teaching them biology all the time if they weren't even gonna use a term?

26:10.073 --> 26:11.374
Nevermind concepts.

26:12.298 --> 26:18.622
Which they also ignored until Robert Malone or somebody said it was okay to say those concepts in their presence.

26:21.384 --> 26:23.286
These people are traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

26:23.306 --> 26:25.927
They're not talking about American laws that need to be changed.

26:27.529 --> 26:29.290
They're talking about the WHO and the UN.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.676
These people talked about bushmeat for a year.

26:33.376 --> 26:35.177
These people wore masks for a year.

26:35.637 --> 26:41.419
This guy advocated for everyone taking ivermectin for 30 days to get to zero COVID in June, 2021.

26:42.800 --> 26:55.165
And I think the show that we're gonna watch today, which is part of this operation to get us to teach gain of function to our children that they want us to accomplish for them,

26:56.192 --> 27:02.074
this, this idea that the worst case scenario has happened, that something got leaked and it's all over the world now.

27:03.635 --> 27:04.635
They must be killing us.

27:04.735 --> 27:06.636
All this stuff must be under their control.

27:07.056 --> 27:08.296
This is all nonsense.

27:08.336 --> 27:15.739
And they want you to forget that this 2024, they want you to forget that this is the fifth year of this nonsense.

27:16.259 --> 27:21.941
These people don't get to claim that they, they spoke up and had principles when it was necessary.

27:21.961 --> 27:23.242
They didn't even speak up until 2021.

27:26.249 --> 27:40.633
some of them until 2022, most of them in the same month of 2021, Naomi Wolf, Brett Weinstein, Steve Kirsch, Robert Malone, all because, why?

27:40.713 --> 27:42.514
Because of Byram Bridle.

27:43.234 --> 27:54.317
They had to step in front of Byram Bridle and make sure that the lab leak was never questioned, that the danger was never questioned, that the disease was never questioned, that the novelty was never questioned.

27:55.282 --> 27:59.063
that zero COVID wasn't questioned as a possibility.

28:00.323 --> 28:05.324
And the way they're getting away with it is that they're not talking about what they were doing in 2020 and 2021.

28:06.064 --> 28:07.644
They're just not talking about it anymore.

28:09.085 --> 28:11.365
They won't admit what they said on those podcasts.

28:11.405 --> 28:13.566
They won't talk about what they said on those podcasts.

28:13.586 --> 28:20.047
And that's why I think it is vital that we talk about what they said on those podcasts, because it's the faith that's a lie.

28:21.687 --> 28:23.408
Transfection is definitely real.

28:23.508 --> 28:24.810
Transformation is real.

28:24.930 --> 28:25.930
It's virology.

28:29.213 --> 28:35.538
But the faith in a novel thing that goes around the world fueled by RNA is just nonsense.

28:35.598 --> 28:37.019
It's absolute nonsense.

28:39.401 --> 28:43.805
That's why none of these people talk about these five people at all.

28:44.666 --> 28:46.267
They want you to blame it on the DOD.

28:51.892 --> 29:02.758
These people want you to focus on the shots and maybe the DNA double-stranded contamination in it, which they don't seem to be saying much anymore because I think we trounce them on that.

29:03.579 --> 29:12.084
Because it's so stupid to say that when transfection in its purest form would still be criminally negligent in a healthy 10-year-old or a healthy 80-year-old.

29:13.925 --> 29:17.707
That these lipid nanoparticles were inappropriate for any healthy person.

29:20.199 --> 29:23.520
And so they want you to focus on a very limited spectrum of that crap.

29:26.021 --> 29:30.743
That's why the VAERS expert from the very beginning has always been a non-American.

29:33.604 --> 29:36.124
And nobody will pay attention to Albert to this day.

29:42.167 --> 29:43.247
Welcome the Eagles, you know.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.564
It's just all a big game for these people.

29:47.584 --> 29:59.322
And as long as they only focus on their one talking point, their one book title, their one set of patents, then they never get around to telling you that they just murdered people and lied about it.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.753
Give them as much oxygen as they want.

30:03.794 --> 30:05.455
Turn it up as high as it needs.

30:06.036 --> 30:09.860
Kyle Seidel was writing papers that said, you know, 60 liters is great.

30:10.180 --> 30:13.583
Publishing videos saying 60 liters a minute is wonderful.

30:13.623 --> 30:16.446
We're going through thousands of liters of oxygen here.

30:16.967 --> 30:17.968
Don't anybody smoke.

30:22.566 --> 30:32.694
Now Robert Malone is talking about a risk assessment for avian flu and telling you it's there, telling you that it's moving, telling you that there are some, showing you some skepticism.

30:33.054 --> 30:45.123
The limited spectrum of debate with a great big argument inside of it is even, the other side is the much less tethered to reality side, his Brownstone Institute and CHD.

30:46.826 --> 30:52.370
Robert Malone doesn't say anything much about gain-of-function research here, in his substack.

30:56.073 --> 31:08.843
And so the limited spectrum of debate right now about where avian flu is going, headed, gone, coming from, is defined by, on one side, Robert Malone.

31:11.249 --> 31:17.500
And on the other side, it's defined by children's health defense and brownstone.

31:27.509 --> 31:29.030
It's just such nonsense.

31:29.090 --> 31:31.590
Okay, so I see in the video that that's there.

31:31.630 --> 31:34.031
So there's motors called Scorpion Motors.

31:34.111 --> 31:36.852
That's not because I'm a Scorpio.

31:36.892 --> 31:39.933
And then Gali on the other side is also a helicopter brand.

31:39.953 --> 31:42.214
So don't get too excited about that.

31:42.274 --> 31:44.834
That's just a Scorpion motor thing.

31:45.855 --> 31:49.016
So Malone does the Vajon Health thing.

31:49.096 --> 31:50.216
Why did this stop?

31:51.476 --> 31:53.057
I'm gonna escape out of here, I think.

31:59.329 --> 32:00.629
Yes, I think that's better.

32:01.110 --> 32:05.213
Yes, Malone does Vajon Health in June 2021.

32:05.273 --> 32:16.881
Now, I didn't cut all the clips out of the archive yet to show you that Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey and Christine Grace

32:19.244 --> 32:28.788
They did an absolutely despicable trio presentation for Vajon Health at some weekend COVID summit.

32:29.368 --> 32:30.369
It was appalling.

32:31.629 --> 32:37.772
And my review of that summit and my critique of the worst slide deck ever

32:38.872 --> 32:49.398
um used by christine grace um she actually made kevin mccarran look like a pretty competent presenter the way that she she blubbed it but her her

32:50.663 --> 33:16.725
let's call them text rich slide deck, needed a lot of critique and also her focus on things without actually teaching anybody anything about what anything meant, resulted in her actually writing a letter to Children's Health Defense complaining that I was doing something illegal or incorrect on the internet, which is technically tortious interference with an employer or an employer,

33:17.606 --> 33:20.787
employment or a business interference or some shit like that.

33:21.227 --> 33:21.968
I'm not really sure.

33:22.008 --> 33:25.889
My lawyer said that I should just take all that stuff and archive it so I have.

33:27.029 --> 33:28.650
That's the game that these people play.

33:30.050 --> 33:37.453
And they will stop at no level in order to create the illusion that somehow the world is responding to me.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.133
But it's not.

33:38.893 --> 33:40.394
Because they're all on the same team.

33:42.972 --> 33:47.974
It's not like they didn't know each other in some way or weren't connected to each other in some way.

33:48.475 --> 33:51.476
These people are not randomly distributed anymore.

33:54.137 --> 34:05.243
It may be that some of the people at CHD don't know the extent to which there are traitors in our midst, but nobody gets a free pass anymore.

34:06.630 --> 34:13.953
Because this video, for example, has been available for all these people to watch and think about and take notes on since June of 2021.

34:16.014 --> 34:19.396
And so there's no excuse for anybody not to know what we're about to see.

34:19.936 --> 34:25.639
And I think that what we're about to see in the first, let's say half an hour, is gonna be absolutely mind-blowing.

34:26.680 --> 34:32.042
Because this guy just blows his mouth off like, there's no, nothing to be lost here.

34:32.102 --> 34:35.944
I can just talk all I want because I'm Ditra and because I'm running this thing.

34:37.423 --> 34:39.225
Everybody's going to take direction from me.

34:41.589 --> 34:45.033
There's a really good one coming about a housekeeper that I'm just going to freak out about.

34:46.055 --> 34:46.956
Let's do it.

34:48.658 --> 34:49.399
Let's do it.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.202
Study hall time.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.987
Study hall time.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.203
I mean, this is already pretty extraordinary.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.805
I have this incredible music and graphics.

35:23.566 --> 35:26.607
And like, Japan, that's who he's talking about.

35:26.647 --> 35:27.968
He's talking about McCairn.

35:30.469 --> 35:33.351
Germany, he's talking about supplement sales people, you know?

35:35.362 --> 35:38.123
And he has this stuff going already in 2021.

35:39.143 --> 35:41.164
And I want you to hear very carefully.

35:42.005 --> 35:49.547
One of the things I really want you to hear is that a lot of his questions, I think, are queued up by Malone, which I find pretty funny.

35:52.849 --> 35:53.369
There he is.

35:54.429 --> 35:55.049
Maestro.

35:55.890 --> 35:57.330
He also plays in a symphony.

36:10.253 --> 36:13.196
Hello and good evening to everyone.

36:13.596 --> 36:17.080
And we're going to have an absolutely fascinating discussion.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.201
Fascinating.

36:18.401 --> 36:19.982
This isn't going to work.

36:20.103 --> 36:21.444
Oh boy, it's not going to work.

36:21.464 --> 36:22.825
That's not going to work for me.

36:29.091 --> 36:30.172
All the way back in 1988.

36:30.352 --> 36:31.534
That's Rob Malone.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.917
And we're going to explore some of his ideas, some of the history, some of his experiences.

36:35.097 --> 36:37.699
And I hope that you will find this as absolutely fascinating as I have.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.561
So here we have with us, Rob, how are you?

36:39.581 --> 36:40.362
I'm good.

36:40.402 --> 36:48.389
And thank you, Dr. McMillan, for having me on your podcast and for the opportunity to discuss ideas and data and science and everything else.

36:48.710 --> 36:49.510
Super smiling.

36:49.530 --> 36:52.053
Let's get straight to the crunch point that I want to understand.

36:52.913 --> 36:59.306
You were a PhD student when you first came up with the concept of mRNA vaccination.

36:59.346 --> 37:01.451
Were you the first person ever to think about this?

37:05.164 --> 37:08.345
I can't say whether anybody else preceded me in thinking about it.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.105
I'm not aware of documentation of others having.

37:11.165 --> 37:17.747
I think we should start out with a list of a few things that we're interested in figuring out here.

37:17.867 --> 37:25.908
So first of all, super smiley, is there a warning?

37:28.909 --> 37:31.029
So that's the first question that I have.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.350
Is there a warning?

37:32.930 --> 37:34.410
Is there a clear warning?

37:36.963 --> 37:41.565
So will he actually warn us about anything to do with this technology?

37:41.665 --> 37:44.807
Will he say that there's reason for pause?

37:47.968 --> 37:53.611
That's the main issue that I have here, because that's what he's supposed to be a hero about.

37:54.732 --> 38:03.776
And in May of this year, 2021, I had already put out a public call to pause all transfections.

38:06.354 --> 38:10.438
In May of 2021, I already had it written in January of 2021.

38:10.498 --> 38:13.120
I could have probably published it in January of 2021.

38:13.881 --> 38:21.427
But I was delayed because somebody said that they might be able to get it in an op-ed or something like that.

38:21.547 --> 38:28.133
And that would be my other author on that, which I now have posted on my website under the link Scooby.

38:29.028 --> 38:38.697
because I had been fooled by these people, including Gerrit van den Balsch and others that had convinced me that the transfection might be changing the gain-of-function virus as it circulates.

38:41.020 --> 38:52.331
And so the reasons why I was making the call for a pause in transfections was very many, there's a long list, but one of them was the potential enrichment of the circulating new pathogen.

38:54.445 --> 38:59.548
And that's why I have it on that link as Scooby, because it ain't my finest hour.

38:59.628 --> 39:10.013
I was completely bamboozled into thinking I had solved the mystery, that I was one of the smartest people on earth, because I had figured it out like the rest of drastic.

39:12.474 --> 39:14.395
And I had people telling me that I was that.

39:17.557 --> 39:18.678
And that's how they did it.

39:19.438 --> 39:22.900
That's why a lot of these people are still there, because they have comfort.

39:24.380 --> 39:26.262
Because everything's working out just fine.

39:28.764 --> 39:34.750
And because they've been told to keep their head down, I think, and just stay focused on the message about the shots and everything will be fine.

39:37.613 --> 39:40.056
Don't talk about the murder and the lying about it.

39:42.236 --> 39:44.678
So let's see what we got here with Mr. Maloney.

39:45.599 --> 39:52.345
In my experience, when the time is right for a technology or discovery, it tends to emerge kind of organically all across the world.

39:53.165 --> 39:57.789
In this case, strangely, it doesn't seem to have done so in that time frame of the late 80s.

39:58.630 --> 40:05.896
And so the record suggests that I was the first to develop this idea, but I can't say that nobody else had it.

40:06.457 --> 40:07.217
That'd be impossible.

40:07.517 --> 40:11.521
And so when you think, because you were studying, you were doing your PhD at the Salk Institute at that time.

40:11.941 --> 40:23.811
And when you were working on your dissertation with mRNA, and just to clarify, in case people don't fully understand, even though we're talking about it in the context of COVID, a lot of people may not understand the simplistic perspective on mRNA.

40:24.171 --> 40:27.434
What really were you doing in a very simple way for somebody to understand?

40:29.164 --> 40:31.147
So you're kind of asking the question, how did this all come about?

40:31.768 --> 40:37.796
And I can assure you that I did not start off thinking, I'm going to have a PhD on RNA vaccines.

40:37.936 --> 40:38.457
Absolutely not.

40:39.539 --> 40:41.541
The genesis of this is that I was fascinated.

40:41.902 --> 40:42.903
I was fascinated with retroviruses.

40:44.125 --> 40:54.054
I had kind of cut my teeth on mouse mammary tumor virus, a breast cancer virus of mice, and in a laboratory that played a key role in initial discoveries having to do with the role of retroviruses in AIDS back at UC Davis at the Primate Research Center.

40:54.914 --> 40:56.075
And so that was my background.

40:56.095 --> 41:02.982
And I'd come out of that as entering into an MD-PhD program absolutely fascinated with the idea of retroviral-based gene therapy.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.543
And I thought this was something that I could do with my fascination and knowledge of retroviruses.

41:07.403 --> 41:11.985
And it looked likely that this was really going to happen technically.

41:12.285 --> 41:15.446
And it's something that I could continue to pursue through my entire career.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.627
And by this point in time, there would be gene therapists everywhere in every hospital.

41:19.287 --> 41:20.308
That was my vision at the time.

41:20.968 --> 41:27.310
And so I went to this university, UC San Diego, that had two of the absolute pioneers in retroviral gene therapy, Inder Verma and Ted Friedman.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.571
than the one that really came up with the whole gene thing.

41:29.751 --> 41:34.593
So that's interesting because he said repeatedly that he was fascinated by retroviruses.

41:34.633 --> 41:43.418
So retroviruses puts him right smack dab in the middle of HIV and Gallo and Baltimore.

41:46.505 --> 42:03.291
And since these small communities of scientists are indeed very small, it's very likely that as a aggressive young PhD, MD, PhD student that he met Gallo, he met Baltimore, he met all these people because he wanted to meet the people that were doing these things.

42:03.331 --> 42:04.391
I mean, that's how it works.

42:04.491 --> 42:07.392
I would have done the same thing and I did in neuroscience.

42:08.533 --> 42:15.275
I mean, I had no qualms going up to somebody at neuroscience and introducing myself as a little groupie.

42:16.542 --> 42:18.904
And so I'm sure he did it, too.

42:18.944 --> 42:20.285
That's how you get mentorships.

42:20.305 --> 42:22.667
That's how you get postdocs, is just being bold.

42:24.529 --> 42:32.235
And so this puts him right, right, I mean, really right in the middle of it, where Judy Mikovits was, where

42:34.002 --> 42:36.003
with Murray Gardner is who we worked with.

42:37.043 --> 42:59.868
It's a real, it's a real interesting little tiny network of people that actually also intellectually descends from people like Stanley Plotkin and Hilary Kaprowski and Salk and Sabin and all these other people that are all people that have taken part in the erection of this narrative, so to speak.

43:01.549 --> 43:02.789
The construction of it.

43:04.056 --> 43:05.036
That's what they're doing here.

43:06.056 --> 43:10.817
Now they are constructing a narrative about what happened in the pandemic.

43:11.358 --> 43:20.699
And the illusion of consensus here is that the doctor, Philip, is learning from the doctor, Malone.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.800
The consensus is that Malone knows what he's talking about.

43:28.221 --> 43:30.801
And he's really interested in retroviruses in the past.

43:30.861 --> 43:32.602
It's a very, very,

43:33.911 --> 43:34.973
interesting admission.

43:34.993 --> 43:38.440
It has nothing to do with RNA viruses at all.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.424
It's retroviruses.

43:41.507 --> 43:43.511
So they're still thinking that you have to write

43:44.537 --> 43:50.343
You want to write into the genome, you know, that's what they're still thinking, because that's what retroviruses can do.

43:51.084 --> 44:05.139
If you believe virology and you believe Baltimore, that they can write into the genome of a cell, which is a very special thing, very different than transfection, where you're simply expressing a protein for a brief period of time until that RNA goes away.

44:07.128 --> 44:08.670
Just keeping everything straight.

44:09.010 --> 44:12.253
Now, where the rubber hits the road for the young graduate student is, what are you actually going to do?

44:12.814 --> 44:13.875
What is the question you want to work on?

44:13.975 --> 44:22.163
And for me, one of the core questions was, how does the RNA of the retrovirus assemble into live virus particles and get produced as viruses?

44:22.483 --> 44:26.347
This was essential to the fundamentals of making retroviral vectors work.

44:26.887 --> 44:41.965
And there was enough known about the RNA of the retrovirus in the specific packaging sequences that it was possible, theoretically, to examine that RNA, mutate that RNA, and ask questions about how those specific sequences were interacting with cellular proteins and viral proteins to assemble the retroviral particles that would be produced.

44:42.546 --> 44:44.308
So there you have it all in one in a nutshell.

44:46.002 --> 44:51.684
And if you will read the last substack that I wrote, which is just a working document.

44:51.744 --> 44:53.605
It's not really a finished product.

44:53.665 --> 45:00.328
It was kind of notes that I was handing to people that I thought were my friends, but turned out to be my meddlers.

45:02.209 --> 45:09.952
If you read that substack, you will see that one of the things that is pretty well known in RNA virology is you need to co-transfect.

45:10.912 --> 45:14.694
You need to co-transfect the RNA called the N.

45:15.586 --> 45:23.568
gene and if you do that you will get very successful packaging of apparently viral particles.

45:24.848 --> 45:39.251
Now what Robert Malone just described there is the early history of virology and the early history of retroviruses and specifically the quest to understand the mechanisms behind viral packaging.

45:39.291 --> 45:41.632
It is the infectious cycle ladies and gentlemen

45:43.444 --> 45:48.092
He's talking about the infectious cycle when he talks about viral packaging.

45:50.997 --> 45:56.708
He's talking about how they hijack the machinery of your cells to make them do something they don't already do.

45:59.619 --> 46:01.180
which of course is not what happens.

46:01.260 --> 46:08.626
And anybody that's watching this for a while or watching me and my show for a while knows that you can't make a cell do something that it doesn't already do.

46:08.727 --> 46:16.213
And so the main argument that I'm making, and a lot of people that have been studying exosomes for a long time have been making without knowing it,

46:17.788 --> 46:25.170
is that our cells release viral-like particles all the time that are called exosomes or endosomes or whatever you want to call them.

46:25.630 --> 46:29.711
They can have proteins on the outside that can be specific for an address.

46:29.751 --> 46:31.572
They cannot have proteins on the outside.

46:31.592 --> 46:33.332
They can have RNA and DNA inside.

46:33.773 --> 46:35.273
Maybe they have enzymes sometimes.

46:35.333 --> 46:35.933
We don't know.

46:35.993 --> 46:41.955
It's very hard to study them because it's an incredibly heterogeneous signal, this size scale.

46:42.915 --> 46:45.197
Because there's bacteriophages in there.

46:45.217 --> 46:46.818
There's garbage in there.

46:47.318 --> 46:50.380
There are signals from other animals in there.

46:50.641 --> 46:52.202
It's all mixed in.

46:53.543 --> 46:58.827
Tiny, tiny, tiny signals that we have no way of getting to.

46:58.887 --> 47:01.729
So the only thing we can really do is amplify them.

47:04.531 --> 47:04.931
That's it.

47:06.592 --> 47:07.093
And so they've...

47:08.215 --> 47:31.410
using polymerase chain reaction purported to amplify some of those signals and through that amplification and other methodological experiments methodological manipulations they purport to understand how these entities work and that they're all outside of us that's just impossible

47:34.431 --> 47:44.976
But if you got in on the game early, you were in on the ground floor, you were there when the illusion was being set, when the narrative, the mythology was being established.

47:48.977 --> 47:59.062
And so what I'm arguing is, is that if this goes as deep as those people like Dave Resnick and Peter Duesberg would say,

48:00.077 --> 48:25.644
than people like Robert Malone were put in place already back then, recruited already back then, and read into the national security narrative already back then, and have been participating in its active sustaining and its active curation at the WHO, active curation at closed door grant committee meetings, and all of this stuff.

48:26.909 --> 48:30.411
consulting for the people that write the grants to these committees.

48:34.533 --> 48:44.839
And so what I am suggesting is pretty strong, pretty right on with what Mark is suggesting, that a lot of these people have been deep state operatives for a very long time.

48:44.899 --> 48:55.085
I hate the words deep state as an idea, but if you use it as a general term to describe someone who has been working covertly for the government,

48:55.948 --> 48:57.669
even as a government employee.

48:58.670 --> 49:21.585
You can work for the government and still work covertly in the sense of you tell everybody that you're doing one job, when in reality, the Department of Defense or Health and Human Services or whoever you work for, whatever intelligence agency you work for, knows that you have an alternative job, which might very well be to sustain the illusion

49:22.506 --> 49:42.994
of retroviral biology to sustain the illusion of virology in general and of infectious disease as a pathogen-oriented immune response and a pathogen-associated molecular patterns as being the way that the immune response is orchestrated.

49:45.270 --> 49:55.672
to effectively neutralize any other interpretation of the immune system and neutralize any other interpretation of that biology, for example, it being endogenous signaling.

49:58.073 --> 50:08.975
So that, as I explained in that Gabe Mason podcast, that maybe when I encounter a RNA or a bacteria or a bacteriophage,

50:10.462 --> 50:23.192
that is maladaptive to my system for whatever reason, maybe my immune system is capable of sending signals to my family that manifest in a sore throat for a day or a cough for a day.

50:24.733 --> 50:35.482
And they develop immunity or their microbiome develops an immunity or a tolerance to something that otherwise they wouldn't have built an immunity or tolerance to in the same way.

50:38.601 --> 50:43.284
Maybe we send signals and use MHC molecules to select mates.

50:43.384 --> 50:46.706
For all we know, no one's going to care because that's not funded.

50:47.627 --> 50:51.189
They don't want us to think about the irreducible complexity that is us.

50:51.330 --> 50:54.512
They want us to think of ourselves as stupid meat puppets.

50:55.632 --> 50:56.213
Machines.

51:00.626 --> 51:04.131
And that was why they used Rodney, for example, in all those TED Talks.

51:04.191 --> 51:07.576
I don't know if it's ever become clear to you if you've watched enough of them.

51:07.596 --> 51:14.407
But what they did is they warmed everybody up with Rodney because he's so charming and he's so ethereal.

51:16.155 --> 51:26.183
But his explanation for how things are learned and complex skills are learned by the body and the mind is something that they're very interested in.

51:26.263 --> 51:37.352
And so someone with the level of insight into how skill, high-level skill and learning is accomplished and the flow state is accomplished is something that they were very interested in from Rodney.

51:41.291 --> 51:51.040
But at some point, I don't know if he was as useful to them as they thought, simply because he does have a respect for the irreducible complexity.

51:51.060 --> 52:00.268
He does understand that, you know, what he sacrificed in order to get where he was.

52:00.348 --> 52:01.509
He understands a lot.

52:03.429 --> 52:07.431
That they want to understand but don't because they're not asking the right questions.

52:07.511 --> 52:30.303
And so again, I can't stress enough I think you're witnessing something here a possible real paradigm shift because This Philip Macmillan is not a hero who quit his job so that he could teach the world the immunology that it would save it he's not somebody who lost his job at a medical school because he was speaking out and

52:32.674 --> 52:49.550
These are people who were put in place, elevated, and allowed to circulate on social media as well as anybody wanted them to, without any, let's say, without any negative programming.

52:51.431 --> 52:56.136
And so Robert Malone being elevated on this guy's show several times

52:57.825 --> 53:10.031
over the course of these four years is a very, very, very obvious sign that this is not a horse farmer who's decided to zoom and save the world.

53:10.891 --> 53:14.233
An emu farmer who's decided to save the world.

53:15.153 --> 53:23.517
This is a deep state operative, a government agent working for an intelligence agency or a five eyes network or some shit.

53:24.847 --> 53:28.009
to help with the controlled demolition of America in the West.

53:30.670 --> 53:51.041
And I don't know how far off script they are now, but I do know that when you listen to him here in this video, you are hearing a very cocky, very confident, over his skis actor, who if you just take the time to watch this video, and I promise I will push play, you will see a guy who is still figuring out

53:51.934 --> 53:54.596
what bullshit's going to stick.

53:54.616 --> 53:57.678
Before you go any further, let me just clarify because I'm talking really basic stuff for people.

53:57.998 --> 54:01.960
When you say RNA, usually the DNA in our body is what makes all the proteins.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.442
Well, it goes from DNA, DNA makes RNA and RNA then makes the proteins.

54:06.343 --> 54:06.543
Yes.

54:06.643 --> 54:15.048
And so when you talk about RNA, you are talking about going in the middle between the DNA and the proteins to be able to change the way how a cell works.

54:15.148 --> 54:15.929
Is that about right?

54:17.590 --> 54:22.854
So that kind of jumps ahead in time to the idea of mRNA as a drug and mRNA as a vaccine.

54:23.535 --> 54:24.936
At this point in time, I just want to set the stage.

54:25.236 --> 54:31.161
You know, the truth of the matter is retroviruses, and it's captured in the name, retroviruses are very odd.

54:31.201 --> 54:32.442
And David Baltimore got the Nobel for this.

54:33.055 --> 54:41.100
in that they have a protein that will take from the RNA and make DNA, which then gets put into the chromosome of the cell, which then makes retroviral RNA, which then gets packaged and put out as new viral particles.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.462
That's the life cycle of a retrovirus, is it's got this backwards step.

54:43.482 --> 54:44.342
But yes, you're exactly right.

54:44.582 --> 54:48.285
The central dogma of biology is that DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein.

54:49.525 --> 54:55.768
So in this case, I was trying to ask this question about how retroviruses package RNA so that they can produce viable retroviruses.

54:56.388 --> 55:06.073
And in order to build that as an experimental system, I had to have a way to produce synthetic RNA with mutations in it, put it into a cell and ask whether it comes back out as virus particles.

55:06.593 --> 55:13.236
See, so he was actually mutating individual genes to see which genes resulted in exosome production.

55:16.604 --> 55:18.806
I mean, how else can you hear it?

55:19.687 --> 55:29.056
I mean, he calls them viruses, but he's using these genes, these small transcripts to see which ones stimulate the release of particles.

55:29.116 --> 55:41.748
Now we can go back at his papers over the summer and we can look and see if he's bullshitting or not, but that's what he claims right here, which suggests a very intimate knowledge of the illusion.

55:43.345 --> 55:49.390
Because we at GigaOM Biological have come to the conclusion that the illusion is the infectious cycle.

55:50.370 --> 56:07.604
That the infectious cycle is outside pathogenic particles that are hijacking the machinery of our cells to make our cells do something they don't already do instead of endogenous signaling mechanisms that are being misconstrued as pathogenic mechanisms.

56:09.085 --> 56:10.086
Now, it is possible.

56:10.266 --> 56:11.387
It is still possible.

56:12.435 --> 56:20.522
that there is something happening, that there is something transmitting, that there are symptoms that can pass from conspecific to conspecific for a limited time.

56:20.582 --> 56:32.733
But the idea of a pandemic that is fueled by an RNA that was crafted and the crafting of it is what endowed it with the ability to pandemic is a lie.

56:33.694 --> 56:37.257
It is an absolute monstrous exaggeration.

56:38.746 --> 56:41.248
that it has no basis in biology at all.

56:41.288 --> 56:45.431
There isn't a paper I can show you that proves that, because there is no proof for it.

56:48.053 --> 56:49.274
And you can't prove a negative.

56:49.334 --> 56:53.958
Nobody sets out to show that, look, RNA can't go around the world forever, because it can't.

56:57.741 --> 57:05.207
And he spent his graduate time trying to figure out what genes of retroviruses, remember Bob Gallo and

57:05.802 --> 57:09.245
David Baltimore, you know, the liar at the beginning of every stream lately.

57:15.909 --> 57:17.471
This is their idea.

57:19.052 --> 57:28.679
The Baltimore scheme of where these enzymes fit and where these molecules fit and how we just use DNA to RNA to ribosome to protein, but they have all kinds of other stuff they can do.

57:30.014 --> 57:32.236
And they do it while they hijack our own cells.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.617
It's just absurd.

57:34.618 --> 57:41.824
I have the feeling that this is one of the guys that like they recruited him when he was young and raring to go and super excited.

57:47.208 --> 57:48.570
And he's been in it ever since.

57:49.951 --> 57:53.614
That's why Merrill Nass and his history go back very, very far.

57:55.213 --> 58:00.115
because likely they've both been part of this little charade for a very long time.

58:00.175 --> 58:07.297
The bioweapons expert from Maine and the bioweapons expert from the foot of the Shenandoah National Forest.

58:12.579 --> 58:17.181
It's like Radagast and his girlfriend or something.

58:18.152 --> 58:19.293
And that's what got me going on this.

58:19.554 --> 58:23.097
It wasn't because I was going to change the world or make an RNA vaccine or any of that stuff.

58:23.338 --> 58:24.379
That's where it started.

58:24.679 --> 58:27.342
I was in an amazing hothouse gene therapy environment.

58:28.743 --> 58:37.713
Just to give an example, the senior postdoc, when he left the laboratory, created the leading adenoviral vector company that now has been sold to Johnson & Johnson.

58:37.993 --> 58:40.496
And that technology is the basis for the J&J vaccine now.

58:40.916 --> 58:42.597
So I wonder why he didn't say the name.

58:42.657 --> 58:44.299
I think that's Cursel, right?

58:44.359 --> 58:44.879
Cursel?

58:44.999 --> 58:47.781
I think that was that name and he probably worked for them or something.

58:47.801 --> 58:48.102
I don't know.

58:48.142 --> 58:48.942
Mark could tell you that.

58:49.463 --> 58:53.346
Why don't you go look it up on Mark's website sometime and use his website for something?

58:54.526 --> 58:56.148
Because all that information is there.

58:57.649 --> 58:59.830
You can see Robert Malone's extensive career.

58:59.870 --> 59:04.114
You can see an example of his resume and you can check some of this stuff out.

59:05.819 --> 59:15.246
So I was in this amazing pressure cooker doing these gene therapy experiments and surrounded by people grappling with the early days of gene therapy and what the problems were.

59:15.887 --> 59:24.113
Was there any specific moment when you thought, oh my goodness, this is a possibility to use this technology to make a vaccine all the way in the 1980s?

59:24.453 --> 59:34.541
He just told you that he thought there was gonna be a gene therapist at every hospital in America using retroviruses to cure childhood diseases.

59:38.195 --> 59:46.078
Using them as vaccines was a secondary idea to the idea of altering humans at the genome level.

59:47.458 --> 59:55.321
First, of course, the innocent and totally benign goal of curing childhood diseases by editing the genome.

59:57.022 --> 01:00:00.323
Not really sure how you do that without changing an embryo, but anyway,

01:00:03.689 --> 01:00:05.510
So there was two kind of events.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:12.315
The first one was the aha moment about using gene therapy technology to produce vaccines.

01:00:13.149 --> 01:00:17.670
And that happened because I was working very closely with a postdoc mentor.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.830
His name is Dan St.

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:19.030
Louis.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:19.750
He still lives in San Diego.

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:34.053
And Dan was working on a system where he would use retrovirus vectors to put genes expressing a secreted protein into cells of a mouse, and then collecting them in a little package, a nodule, we could say, placing them as a transplant into the mouse, and then the mouse would continue making the protein.

01:00:34.633 --> 01:00:39.134
So this was putting things into engineered cells in cell culture, and then implanting them back in the mouse.

01:00:39.154 --> 01:00:40.354
That was the model, using a retrovirus.

01:00:41.198 --> 01:00:42.940
And Dan ran into a problem.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.501
It was a huge paradox in the laboratory.

01:00:45.382 --> 01:00:49.385
The cells would produce the protein in the mouse for about three weeks, and then they would stop producing it.

01:00:49.866 --> 01:00:53.208
And Inder's lab, where I was, Inder Verma, one of the top.

01:00:53.489 --> 01:00:55.030
Wow, this is a huge detail.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:55.630
Did you hear it?

01:00:55.731 --> 01:00:58.133
So what he's saying is that this St.

01:00:58.153 --> 01:01:01.896
Louis guy, he transfected cells.

01:01:03.798 --> 01:01:07.020
And then he put those cells into a mouse, like a little tumor.

01:01:10.621 --> 01:01:15.367
And that little tumor then grows in the mouse for like three weeks and produces the protein.

01:01:15.387 --> 01:01:18.671
So presumably you would think of something like insulin.

01:01:21.134 --> 01:01:23.237
Or maybe an enzyme that you need all the time.

01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:27.362
And so they're growing cells here and they're transfecting them.

01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:38.438
So that they produce a protein in the mouse, like they're putting cell culture, a little nodule in, and then it produces it for about three weeks.

01:01:38.498 --> 01:01:41.621
And then the immune system, of course, kills those cells because they're foreign.

01:01:45.124 --> 01:01:46.946
Or they're expressing a foreign protein.

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:49.488
I don't know which one it would be necessarily.

01:01:50.586 --> 01:01:53.150
leaders at the time in regulation of gene expression.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:58.839
And the others who were supporting him in that mission thought that this must be a... I think Dan St.

01:01:58.859 --> 01:02:00.101
Louis, he said, I'll go back.

01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:01.384
And then they would stop producing it.

01:02:02.315 --> 01:02:04.275
and then implanting them into cells of a mouse.

01:02:04.656 --> 01:02:07.216
I was working very closely with a post-doc mentor.

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:08.357
His name is Dan St.

01:02:08.377 --> 01:02:08.557
Louis.

01:02:08.577 --> 01:02:09.277
He still lives in San Diego.

01:02:09.817 --> 01:02:23.520
And Dan was working on a system where he would use retrovirus vectors to put genes expressing a secreted protein into cells of a mouse and then collecting them in a little package, a nodule, we could say, placing them as a transplant into the mouse, and then the mouse would continue making the protein.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.602
So this was putting things into engineered cells in cell culture and then implanting them back in the mouse.

01:02:28.622 --> 01:02:29.822
That was the model, using a retrovirus.

01:02:30.669 --> 01:02:32.429
And Dan ran into a problem.

01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:33.970
It was a huge paradox in the laboratory.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:38.851
The cells would produce the protein in the mouse for about three weeks, and then they would stop producing it.

01:02:39.351 --> 01:02:45.233
And Ender's lab, where I was- So I want to stop here because remember, he's transforming, right?

01:02:45.253 --> 01:02:47.993
He's using retroviruses and DNA.

01:02:48.153 --> 01:02:50.374
It's RNA, but it has to write it into DNA.

01:02:50.954 --> 01:02:55.095
So this might've been an RNA retrovirus, but then it writes it into DNA.

01:02:55.615 --> 01:02:57.476
So he transformed this.

01:02:57.556 --> 01:02:58.816
This is transformation.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:07.921
So he transforms the cell culture, and then he puts the transformed cells back into the mouse.

01:03:09.564 --> 01:03:11.747
He's not putting retroviruses into the mouse.

01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:14.351
Make sure that you hear that.

01:03:15.332 --> 01:03:16.815
It's not quite the same thing yet.

01:03:18.497 --> 01:03:19.098
Fair enough.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:32.516
one of the top leaders at the time in regulatory regulation of gene expression, and the others who were supporting him in that mission thought that this must be a what was happening was some sort of a control event that the retroviruses were getting turned off in the cells.

01:03:33.137 --> 01:03:37.702
And the aha moment for me as somebody trained in medicine for a couple years and immunology and vaccines and all that

01:03:38.263 --> 01:03:43.384
was, good heavens, this is happening at three weeks, which is exactly the timeline for a good, robust cellular immoral immune response.

01:03:44.205 --> 01:03:51.527
Probably what's going on is not some epigenetic, fancy chromosomal silencing thing, but rather simply that the mouse is making an immune response against the foreign protein.

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:53.287
And lo and behold, that was what happened.

01:03:53.447 --> 01:03:56.488
Now, it seems like a very small thing in retrospect, but it was heresy at the time.

01:03:57.348 --> 01:04:05.835
Gene therapy had not yet come to confront the fact that it has this fundamental logic flaw, which is if you're putting the good gene into a patient, the patient's immune system doesn't know that it's the good gene.

01:04:06.155 --> 01:04:12.240
It only knows that it's a foreign gene, and it will mount an immune response against it, and it will also mount an immune response against the vector if it's an adenovirus or retrovirus or whatever.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.421
So this aha moment seems trivial in retrospect.

01:04:15.382 --> 01:04:19.905
time, it was a kind of heresy, and not well received, as you might imagine.

01:04:20.325 --> 01:04:27.790
But that was one of the key ones, was gene therapy can be used, it may not ever remember, I come into this, a true believer in gene therapy, there's gonna be my career, right?

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.651
I'm in, I'm all in.

01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:29.131
Okay.

01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:32.253
And suddenly, the epiphany, oh, this isn't gonna work so good.

01:04:33.074 --> 01:04:33.934
What are we going to do about it?

01:04:34.135 --> 01:04:34.275
Right?

01:04:34.295 --> 01:04:39.258
Because because if you've got an immune response, there's no going back, you know, then you're into immune suppression land and really complex science.

01:04:40.099 --> 01:04:43.501
Oh, really complex science, when you start messing with the immune system.

01:04:43.541 --> 01:04:45.142
Isn't that an interesting statement to make?

01:04:45.422 --> 01:04:46.463
And that doesn't work very well.

01:04:46.963 --> 01:04:53.929
But the aha was, oh, one of the way out of the woods is that we can use gene transfer technology to make vaccines.

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.571
And so that was a key aha.

01:04:56.651 --> 01:04:57.352
And I thank Dan St.

01:04:57.392 --> 01:05:00.734
Louis for helping me and mentoring me at that time when I had that brainstorm.

01:05:01.155 --> 01:05:05.678
The other one that was kind of pivotal was way downstream.

01:05:07.225 --> 01:05:14.308
And it happened because of this serendipity that I was working with a non-viral method.

01:05:14.689 --> 01:05:16.009
It's very, very interesting.

01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.689
I'm going to go back.

01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:23.773
It's very, very interesting that they are not saying this correctly, right?

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:28.135
So, it's not really clear to me how this experiment leads you to use

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:36.701
RNA as a vaccine, because again, he's transforming the cells and then he's putting those cells in the mouse.

01:05:37.841 --> 01:05:49.186
So transfecting the mouse directly is not a, let's just say it's not only one step away from what they did in this Dan St.

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:49.906
Louis experiment.

01:05:49.926 --> 01:05:51.067
It's very interesting.

01:05:51.687 --> 01:05:56.929
He's kind of gone through it too quickly in my mind to not explain the difference between those.

01:05:56.949 --> 01:05:57.850
It was kind of pivotal.

01:06:00.031 --> 01:06:10.881
was way downstream and happened because of this serendipity that I was working with a non-viral method for transferring RNA into cells.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:18.367
And then because I was working as a teaching assistant in an embryology course at UC San Diego, and I had extra Xenopus embryos.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:26.074
So these are- So maybe what they did with retroviruses was they disarmed them so that they would just be RNA that would express proteins.

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:29.491
And that we would need to figure out.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:30.852
I would have to go look back at that.

01:06:30.912 --> 01:06:48.805
So then they're looking for just the kind of like what Ralph Baric is supposedly blamed for, trying to find the minimum number of genes that is necessary, the minimum number of proteins that are necessary, thank you, in order to get viral expression to occur.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:54.509
So this is really cool because now he says that he was using non-viral vectors to bring RNA in.

01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:58.694
which is, again, lipid nanoparticles is what we're going to hear in a minute.

01:06:59.194 --> 01:07:08.023
And so he's a very big expert on their uselessness in a healthy animal, yet somehow or another he took the shot, apparently.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:13.169
I'm not even sure if he really brags about that on this podcast, which will be interesting.

01:07:13.709 --> 01:07:15.651
In fact, we should make a note of that mentally.

01:07:15.772 --> 01:07:17.553
When is he going to say that he took the shot?

01:07:18.154 --> 01:07:23.396
because on Brett Weinstein's podcast, he says he took the shot because he wanted to travel.

01:07:23.896 --> 01:07:25.056
Basically early stage tadpoles.

01:07:25.576 --> 01:07:28.377
And I took the material that I had been using for cell culture to test.

01:07:28.397 --> 01:07:32.458
I was testing a whole large array of cell culture ones for the ability to put RNA into them.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:34.899
And I said, well, let's just see what happens with these frog embryos.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.761
And those RNA experiments worked, to my great surprise.

01:07:39.141 --> 01:07:39.721
Astonishing, really.

01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:40.782
They worked incredibly well.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:46.383
And then the next stage in the embryology course was some experiments involving chick embryos.

01:07:46.964 --> 01:07:48.564
And so I did this kind of same thing.

01:07:48.584 --> 01:07:49.725
Well, if it works with frogs, what about chicks?

01:07:50.365 --> 01:07:51.865
And lo and behold, I got signal with chicks.

01:07:52.265 --> 01:07:56.047
And so at that point, then things got serious.

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:59.748
And so he was basically transfecting animals there, right?

01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:03.289
He's transfecting frog embryos, and he's transfecting chick embryos.

01:08:04.295 --> 01:08:09.121
using retroviruses, which may not even really be retroviruses.

01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:15.168
They may just be vectors that are derived from whatever they called retroviruses back then.

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:20.334
Because again, remember what he told you earlier, he was looking for packaging sequences

01:08:22.228 --> 01:08:28.771
and doing point mutations in them to see how he could change the way that viral packaging occurred.

01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:35.235
He was working on the infectious cycle and specific proteins and regulatory proteins involved in it.

01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:48.822
So again, if you think carefully and try to remember that a cell can't be made to do what it doesn't already do, he was basically working on exosomal signaling and what triggers it, what controls it, how is it regulated, and how can we hijack it.

01:08:49.974 --> 01:08:56.736
because if we can hijack it, then we can use it to package things and use it for cell transformation.

01:08:58.017 --> 01:09:06.019
But if you listen carefully to what he's talking about, it's really, he's sometimes not talking about the same thing, but pretending that he is.

01:09:06.099 --> 01:09:17.343
And again, this little thing right here where he transforms the cell culture and then puts those cells back in the mouse, that's very similar to what they're doing to cure sickle cell anemia right now.

01:09:18.243 --> 01:09:25.326
They're transforming people's whatever immune cells like, and then putting them back in.

01:09:27.027 --> 01:09:28.948
That's a lot of what these cures are.

01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:37.052
They're ablating all the cells and they're putting the new ones back in, but they're transforming those cells outside of the animal and then putting them back in.

01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:44.996
It's not the same as vaccinating with a lipid nanoparticle carrying a RNA because that's just transfection.

01:09:47.318 --> 01:09:50.681
This is transfection in a cell culture and then implantation.

01:09:51.942 --> 01:09:56.445
And so it's really interesting how imprecise he's being with this.

01:09:56.485 --> 01:09:59.307
I'm sorry if I'm beating it too hard here.

01:09:59.507 --> 01:10:00.148
And interesting.

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:06.653
And disclosures were filed, and people started wrestling over who got ownership and all those kinds of things.

01:10:06.693 --> 01:10:07.594
And it all went sideways.

01:10:07.814 --> 01:10:12.217
So this is where you- With these embryos and how well this worked.

01:10:12.678 --> 01:10:14.099
And it was totally unexpected.

01:10:15.079 --> 01:10:17.641
But once there, this was a simple 2 plus 2.

01:10:18.341 --> 01:10:19.182
It doesn't work that well.

01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:24.806
I'm not going to cure cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy, but it might work well enough to make an immune response.

01:10:25.586 --> 01:10:26.567
And that was kind of the synthesis.

01:10:26.907 --> 01:10:32.771
So listen, this raises an important phase, because at this time, you are also having difficulty as a PhD.

01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:34.452
in that environment.

01:10:34.592 --> 01:10:37.154
And you did actually... So this is a queued up question, right?

01:10:37.675 --> 01:10:46.481
This brings me to the next point that you wanted me to mention, which is that you were having PTSD with Inder Verma because he was driving you crazy with this IP wrestling shit.

01:10:46.762 --> 01:10:48.143
...leave before you had finished.

01:10:49.103 --> 01:10:50.505
Was that a difficult time for you personally?

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:55.388
So I ended up with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder from a university physician.

01:10:55.849 --> 01:11:02.354
So he had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder from a university physician.

01:11:20.202 --> 01:11:27.024
I went through some experiences that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

01:11:27.064 --> 01:11:30.165
With the perspective of time, I would not be who I am now if I had not gone through those.

01:11:30.805 --> 01:11:35.046
And I was absolutely an aggressive, ambitious, overconfident young graduate student.

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:46.870
And you mentioned before, if I could speak to my younger self or to other graduate students, I would tell my younger self a story about the importance of humility.

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:49.912
and being a little bit more low-key about things.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:51.473
But that's who I was then.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:56.355
The experiences profoundly changed me, and I'm sure for the better.

01:11:56.635 --> 01:11:58.256
But they were extremely painful going through.

01:11:59.197 --> 01:12:00.258
And so I was right then.

01:12:00.278 --> 01:12:07.502
You can see that he would have run up to Bob Gallo, and he would have run up to David Baltimore and said, hey, it's great to meet you.

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:08.542
I really admire your work.

01:12:08.582 --> 01:12:09.383
I want to learn from you.

01:12:09.423 --> 01:12:11.784
Can I do a little stint in your lab, the whole nine yards?

01:12:12.324 --> 01:12:13.145
Of course he would have.

01:12:14.704 --> 01:12:16.185
And that would have got him in trouble, right?

01:12:16.225 --> 01:12:17.806
Because that loyalty doesn't work.

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:19.648
That intellectual property doesn't work.

01:12:19.688 --> 01:12:21.730
You're telling everybody our ideas.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:22.710
What's wrong with you, man?

01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:23.991
Get back to work.

01:12:24.011 --> 01:12:27.314
Let me ask you a hard question on that point, because you left the Salk Institute.

01:12:27.614 --> 01:12:29.596
And in a sense, you left a lot of that work behind you.

01:12:30.497 --> 01:12:35.881
Do you think that you'd be in a completely different place if you had stayed and continued with that work there?

01:12:37.022 --> 01:12:37.782
OK.

01:12:39.702 --> 01:12:40.442
Probably not.

01:12:41.283 --> 01:12:57.747
The cascade of serendipity continued when I left Salk and joined a little startup working for a scientist that I'd been collaborating with at the company Syntex in Palo Alto that had been hired to this La Jolla startup called Vykal.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:03.589
What happened was that I brought the protocols and reagents and know-how into Vykal.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:12.159
And there was capital and willingness to support further animal research and to take it to the next step at FICAL.

01:13:12.519 --> 01:13:16.802
And that was what led to the science paper that was considered to be analogous to cold fusion.

01:13:17.162 --> 01:13:18.503
That was the naked DNA and RNA paper.

01:13:18.843 --> 01:13:20.984
That wouldn't have happened had I remained at the salt.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:21.384
Absolutely.

01:13:21.424 --> 01:13:25.487
That is hilarious to claim that your paper was the equivalent to cold fusion.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:28.049
That is some serious egomaniac right there.

01:13:28.129 --> 01:13:28.429
Wow.

01:13:30.028 --> 01:13:36.633
So would it have been better for me, in terms of my long-term career trajectory, to stay at the Salk?

01:13:38.194 --> 01:13:38.474
I don't know.

01:13:38.554 --> 01:13:40.896
It was impossible for me to remain at the Salk, psychologically.

01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:42.517
It was not an option.

01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:57.687
I had, in the context of all this recent churn about those old days, a colleague, another postdoc from the lab, wrote to me personally and empathized, said that they hadn't realized all that I'd been going through, but they shared what they'd gone through and what they had seen other people go through.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:01.470
And you may or may not be aware, I don't think I'm sliding.

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:14.479
Dr. Verma was asked to leave the Salk Institute, where he was basically running the place, after an expose in Science Magazine about sexual harassment, which this individual that wrote to me privately reminded me of some of the things that he'd observed.

01:14:14.559 --> 01:14:20.043
And he spoke about Dr. Verma's... I wonder if he... I won't even say it.

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:21.004
It's just ridiculous.

01:14:21.044 --> 01:14:22.305
He has PTSD.

01:14:22.665 --> 01:14:23.726
Let's just assume that.

01:14:24.887 --> 01:14:25.527
Practice of...

01:14:28.204 --> 01:14:31.946
being very casual with the intellectual contributions of others in the forms of manuscripts, grants, etc.

01:14:32.666 --> 01:14:39.729
And the individual had the same exact experience that I had, where at one point Inder gave me a stack of grants that he had to review, and he said, read these and get ideas.

01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.629
I was shocked.

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.851
And I went to the then president of the Salk and said, this isn't right, is it?

01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:48.073
And the response I got back was, well, maybe Indra isn't the best role model for you.

01:14:48.654 --> 01:14:51.536
So there was kind of a tolerance there for a number of things.

01:14:52.116 --> 01:14:58.661
And I was an ambitious graduate student in a postdoc lab of, I don't know, 16 postdocs or something, who were extremely competitive.

01:14:59.101 --> 01:15:03.364
And the practice was to assign multiple postdocs to the same task and see which ones succeeded.

01:15:03.985 --> 01:15:05.906
So you can appreciate it's just a pressure cooker.

01:15:06.426 --> 01:15:09.249
And I was warned not to go there.

01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:15.213
Um, and yet I chose to do so because I was so passionate about, um, gene therapy and what I wanted to do in my career.

01:15:15.653 --> 01:15:22.136
And now he wants pity 20 years later because it was so hard and it was so cutthroat.

01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:27.138
Um, so, uh, you know, I, I can't, I brought this upon myself in some way.

01:15:27.198 --> 01:15:29.219
There is no warning here.

01:15:30.099 --> 01:15:32.600
We have not been warned at all yet.

01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:39.423
And so if you were hoping there was going to be a succinct, Hey, wait a minute, everybody, let's just pause.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.991
Transfection isn't a good idea in healthy humans.

01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:43.871
You were wrong.

01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:44.852
He never did that.

01:15:45.713 --> 01:15:48.675
This is pre-Brett Weinstein, I believe.

01:15:48.695 --> 01:15:51.197
That's why we're also not really jumping around.

01:15:51.237 --> 01:16:00.023
We don't really have succinct talking points at the beginning because Brett's podcast actually fixes that problem in some ways.

01:16:00.083 --> 01:16:01.584
It's almost like they learned from this.

01:16:02.044 --> 01:16:03.665
Maybe that's speaking, you know, a victim.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:07.908
But regardless, it was not a psychological option for me.

01:16:08.889 --> 01:16:15.955
having been this starry-eyed, naive, ambitious young scientist, to remain in that environment that I had walked into, thinking it was the temple of knowledge.

01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:18.898
Francis Crick was there at the time, there was a half a dozen Nobel laureates.

01:16:19.258 --> 01:16:24.743
It was kind of the center of the intellectual world of molecular biology, that and the whitehead.

01:16:25.103 --> 01:16:30.708
And so in retrospect, can I say I should have done it differently?

01:16:31.288 --> 01:16:33.110
One makes many mistakes as a young person, but

01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:36.342
you know, were they useful or not?

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:39.263
I think that has to do with what you do inside with those experiences.

01:16:39.684 --> 01:16:45.587
And hopefully I've processed them and I take some comfort that I have had a long series of contributions since.

01:16:46.907 --> 01:16:53.031
But one of the things that comes out of that is I am really religious about ensuring that people get credit for their contributions.

01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:54.872
And I think it makes me a much better leader.

01:16:55.192 --> 01:16:59.114
He's really religious about people getting their contributions.

01:16:59.734 --> 01:17:25.611
acknowledged wow so he makes a great leader because he makes sure that everybody gets the right authorship so that that raises a question before we move on in the discussion which is that when we see all the attention now on the success of mRNA vaccines and so on how does it make you feel considering that you first i guess documented the idea here it comes you were taking it forward and then you almost had to walk away from it and yet you are not giving any credit for it how does that make you feel

01:17:26.428 --> 01:17:28.309
Okay, let me frame it up a little bit.

01:17:28.489 --> 01:17:37.534
I had no choice but to walk away from it because Vykal, in my employment terms and agreement, had employment terms there that made it so that everything I did at Vykal was owned by Vykal.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:41.576
And furthermore, I was not allowed to continue to develop that line of research.

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.657
It belonged to Vykal, and they sold it to Merck.

01:17:44.017 --> 01:17:52.422
So for many years, all of this data and information that I've recently, and my wife has largely disclosed, was hidden away in a very large box in our closet.

01:17:53.363 --> 01:17:54.703
And it wasn't an option.

01:17:54.943 --> 01:17:56.044
Now, Vykal recently went bankrupt.

01:17:56.624 --> 01:17:59.927
And as a young academic, I received cease and desist letters from BICO.

01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:02.709
So it really wasn't an option to carry on in the same way.

01:18:02.729 --> 01:18:03.370
I had to do new things.

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:05.151
So just to get that.

01:18:06.492 --> 01:18:06.893
The feeling.

01:18:08.073 --> 01:18:13.218
So Francis Delier of Heidi News was the one that first contacted me from the press about this whole situation.

01:18:13.838 --> 01:18:18.402
And from the heart, what I said to him was, it feels like rape.

01:18:19.022 --> 01:18:20.023
And I know that's a strong word.

01:18:20.964 --> 01:18:24.027
But what I was trying to express is it feels rape.

01:18:26.403 --> 01:18:29.785
And from the heart, what I said to him was, it feels like rape.

01:18:30.366 --> 01:18:37.530
And I know that's a strong word, but what I was trying to express is it feels like something that I have created.

01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:42.113
And with- In his lived experience, it felt like rape.

01:18:42.834 --> 01:18:48.697
I've never personally been raped, but I imagine that it feels a lot like what Inder Verma did to me.

01:18:49.398 --> 01:18:55.602
And a lot like what it feels like to get cease and desist letters as a young dropout graduate student.

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:01.863
This is a narrative in development.

01:19:02.023 --> 01:19:04.044
It is a script in the making.

01:19:04.305 --> 01:19:06.426
It is a character in the making.

01:19:06.626 --> 01:19:09.507
It is a schtick in the making.

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:12.349
It is a lie in the making.

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:21.594
That's why it's important to go back to these years of 2020 and 2021.

01:19:21.654 --> 01:19:27.377
Because if you go back and look what I was saying and compare it to what these people were saying,

01:19:30.414 --> 01:19:35.296
I won't have anything to stream about it anymore because everybody will just be a subscriber.

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:37.076
I'll be the new Joe Rogan.

01:19:38.237 --> 01:19:39.297
But that's never gonna happen.

01:19:42.558 --> 01:19:45.359
But that's really the truth if I toot my own horn.

01:19:46.019 --> 01:19:47.960
Find the videos of me in 2020.

01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:56.023
Find one of me in 2020 and I dare you not to be shocked at what I'm saying.

01:19:58.171 --> 01:20:02.633
And compare that to any of these people, if you can even find a video from 2020 of some of them.

01:20:03.613 --> 01:20:04.934
Compare me to Paul Cottrell.

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.074
Compare me to Kevin McCairn.

01:20:07.635 --> 01:20:09.235
Compare me to Kevin McKernan.

01:20:12.136 --> 01:20:19.379
What I was saying in 2020, what I wrote in 2021 makes these people look exactly like what they are.

01:20:19.879 --> 01:20:23.941
Meddlers put in place to curate a narrative.

01:20:25.768 --> 01:20:32.333
And this is a guy who's only been on stage a few times and still trying to figure out what it is exactly his message is.

01:20:33.033 --> 01:20:35.055
Or maybe his handlers are trying to figure it out.

01:20:36.676 --> 01:20:41.840
But in this same month, is the month that he goes on talking with that blonde girl.

01:20:42.765 --> 01:20:51.873
And he explains the exact same thing that he was talking about right here, that I worked on packaging sequences and I'm an expert on the infectious cycle.

01:20:52.294 --> 01:20:58.179
And I can tell you that the vast majority of viral particles that are produced during an infection are useless.

01:21:00.141 --> 01:21:01.842
They're replication incompetent.

01:21:04.004 --> 01:21:04.985
He never said it again.

01:21:07.082 --> 01:21:16.768
Just like he's never really been so detail-oriented about some of these things in such a sloppy way, so that we could barely get through any of this video yet.

01:21:18.529 --> 01:21:20.971
Because this isn't a narrative in development.

01:21:22.392 --> 01:21:24.193
He's never going to use the word rape again.

01:21:25.474 --> 01:21:27.675
He's never going to whine about it quite this much again.

01:21:27.715 --> 01:21:30.617
He's never going to use this many details about retroviruses again.

01:21:31.037 --> 01:21:36.381
He's never going to say that he was really interested in retroviruses very many more times again.

01:21:39.904 --> 01:22:00.191
every time he does it puts him right back into the little circles of HIV and chronic fatigue syndrome and xmrv and htlv2 or whatever the hell they all are sv40 my ass you know my own passion and and effort i mean i work tirelessly um is being taken from me

01:22:01.136 --> 01:22:04.457
completely without anything being taken by others.

01:22:05.437 --> 01:22:08.178
And that's rough.

01:22:09.418 --> 01:22:12.979
In academe, there's rules about citing citations.

01:22:13.019 --> 01:22:13.339
You know that.

01:22:13.359 --> 01:22:14.480
You're an academic, and you publish also.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:22.902
And it's probably pretty important to you, as it is to me, in this small, strange world of academic research and publications, that people acknowledge your intellectual contributions.

01:22:22.942 --> 01:22:29.284
And I'm sure you, like me, are rigorous about acknowledging the best metaphor is we all stand on the shoulders of giants.

01:22:30.204 --> 01:22:42.878
And I think it's important to acknowledge those that have contributed to this song that we all sing together, that have come before us and are our peers, and to have that kind of taken away and others seeking to advance their own agenda.

01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:44.920
So he's kind of talking about a community.

01:22:45.701 --> 01:22:49.806
He's kind of talking about a consensus that you don't want to buck.

01:22:51.724 --> 01:22:55.027
kind of suggesting standing on the shoulders of giants.

01:22:55.107 --> 01:22:59.471
And I think one of the giants that he's talking about is David Baltimore.

01:23:00.191 --> 01:23:02.373
One of the giants he's talking about is Robert Gallo.

01:23:03.054 --> 01:23:05.155
One of the giants he's talking about is Murray Gardner.

01:23:06.156 --> 01:23:08.358
One of the giants he's talking about is Stanley Plotkin.

01:23:08.858 --> 01:23:11.160
One of the giants he's talking about is Hilary Kaprowski.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:18.887
One of the giants he's talking about are Sina Bavari and David Hone, his friends and colleagues.

01:23:25.017 --> 01:23:27.838
without even acknowledgment is a little rough.

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:31.198
And so how does it feel?

01:23:31.338 --> 01:23:31.959
It hurts a lot.

01:23:33.019 --> 01:23:37.360
And, you know, a quote, I think it's from the outliner.

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.400
It hurts a lot.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.060
It ain't right.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:39.600
It ain't proper.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.860
And I think we all know that, right?

01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:42.921
Intuitively.

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:48.022
But science and academic science is a strangely competitive world that's very much a pyramid.

01:23:50.311 --> 01:23:56.453
So it's a personal commitment on my part to make sure that everybody that is in my world gets credited for their contributions.

01:23:56.793 --> 01:24:00.153
And I guess I kind of expect the same from others regarding my contributions.

01:24:00.974 --> 01:24:10.756
It's the only thing... So he's really seeding this narrative right now that there is a contribution to be acknowledged, there's intellectual property to be acknowledged, there's a hat tip to be given.

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:24.882
This is very, very much in parallel to how his wife was behaving on the internet about the fact that his technology, his technology, his technology was saving the world.

01:24:27.765 --> 01:24:32.188
And so you can hear from this that that's really the argument that he's making right now.

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:37.212
He's, I can't tell if anybody else had this idea besides me, but I do have the patents.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.981
And there are no warnings here.

01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:42.523
There is no hesitation here.

01:24:42.543 --> 01:24:48.188
There's no cautionary user discretion advised here.

01:24:51.271 --> 01:24:53.112
This is egomania.

01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:55.054
I suffered.

01:24:56.435 --> 01:24:57.436
I paid the price.

01:24:58.137 --> 01:24:59.238
I carry a cross.

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:03.702
I suffered.

01:25:04.663 --> 01:25:05.283
What did he say?

01:25:05.303 --> 01:25:05.383
Shit.

01:25:07.552 --> 01:25:08.552
I got PTSD.

01:25:08.592 --> 01:25:09.633
It felt like rape.

01:25:16.175 --> 01:25:16.675
I mean, I don't know.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:17.515
I don't know what to say.

01:25:17.535 --> 01:25:20.736
I really don't know what to say other than he's really, really making this.

01:25:21.937 --> 01:25:23.017
It's really obvious.

01:25:24.778 --> 01:25:26.318
And we need to wake up.

01:25:27.178 --> 01:25:28.619
This guy toured the world.

01:25:29.588 --> 01:25:37.655
and told people stories on stage for years that other people shared and told us we had to listen to him.

01:25:38.896 --> 01:25:44.441
FLCC, American Frontline Doctors, they're all telling us that he's good.

01:25:45.382 --> 01:25:47.023
The International COVID Summits.

01:25:48.124 --> 01:25:51.247
Bobby Kennedy and Children's Health Defense published his book.

01:25:56.724 --> 01:26:02.546
We have got to come out of this nosedive that these people have us in and we've got to wake up and apologize to our children.

01:26:04.126 --> 01:26:25.733
These people are liars and they are coordinated traitors to America, working with other five eyes, useful idiots to create an illusion of consensus about a novel virus from which millions were saved by transfection, this guy's invention.

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:37.999
It's part of the capital that we're all trading as academics and intellects contributing to this common song that we sing in science, and that we will all respect the contributions of each other.

01:26:38.019 --> 01:26:39.140
Does that answer your question?

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.141
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:43.404
And I feel honored that I'm in a position to be able to at least give you the opportunity

01:26:43.504 --> 01:26:46.825
Does that answer your question that I told you to ask me?

01:26:47.345 --> 01:26:50.547
To get some of that credit, you know, and I feel honoured about that.

01:26:50.567 --> 01:26:53.808
So I'm going to take us on to a different part because we are in the middle of COVID.

01:26:54.068 --> 01:27:01.851
You are therefore one of the experts on mRNA vaccination and it has done a tremendous step with regards to reducing

01:27:02.671 --> 01:27:03.072
I'm shocked.

01:27:03.612 --> 01:27:05.334
I mean, I am amazed.

01:27:05.494 --> 01:27:09.859
I spent a couple of decades of my career trying to advance new gene delivery technologies.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:17.288
I was a founder of Inovio, the electroporation company, and mentored the young Norwegian scientist that was behind that.

01:27:18.269 --> 01:27:20.472
I spent years and years developing and testing cationic lipids.

01:27:20.812 --> 01:27:25.519
I know how hard this business is to get to get this level of transgene expression, because that's really what it is.

01:27:25.539 --> 01:27:26.079
This is really gene.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:35.232
So he did years and years of lipid nanoparticle research, which means that he's he could not be lied to by Peter Cullis.

01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:38.337
That's also a lie then.

01:27:38.397 --> 01:27:40.358
Listen to what he's just said there, please.

01:27:40.858 --> 01:27:42.119
...new gene delivery technologies.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:50.065
I was a founder of Inovio, the electroporation company, and mentored the young Norwegian scientist that was behind that.

01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:52.666
I spent years and years developing and testing cationic lipids.

01:27:53.026 --> 01:27:57.850
I know how hard this business is to get... Years and years developing cationic lipids.

01:27:59.371 --> 01:28:02.513
Years and years developing cationic lipids.

01:28:02.913 --> 01:28:04.154
He didn't take this shot.

01:28:05.799 --> 01:28:17.689
He lied on the Bret Weinstein podcast when he said that he took it for travel and that's the reason why on the Tommy podcast, Steven Hatfield said that he didn't have a Vax card when they went to Italy together.

01:28:21.272 --> 01:28:25.495
Ladies and gentlemen, he lied about taking the shot to coerce other people into doubt.

01:28:27.217 --> 01:28:34.823
That there might be some risk benefit to way out here if it's flying AIDS and I'm fat or I'm old.

01:28:38.052 --> 01:28:42.534
He was on a beach in Hawaii misleading kids about this stuff too.

01:28:43.714 --> 01:28:48.296
And even then, a couple months after this, he still wasn't precise enough to save anyone.

01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:50.316
Because that was never his job.

01:28:53.457 --> 01:28:55.798
None of them were there to save anybody.

01:28:56.218 --> 01:29:00.180
None of them were taking any risks telling people not to do this.

01:29:02.847 --> 01:29:15.573
Just like CHD doesn't take any risks right now when they say that they want to have a big top tent of health freedom and that they want freedom of speech and they want vaccines to be a choice.

01:29:16.554 --> 01:29:22.837
They're not taking any risks to save any kids.

01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:28.199
And these two clowns aren't taking any risks either.

01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:32.061
They're actually performing an elaborate act, which is designed to coerce people

01:29:35.046 --> 01:29:43.868
confuse people and remove their ability to exercise informed consent, which is an international war crime.

01:29:45.267 --> 01:29:47.808
to get this level of transgene expression, because that's really what it is.

01:29:47.828 --> 01:29:49.349
This is really gene, back to the original concept.

01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:52.531
This is gene therapy applied to vaccines with RNA.

01:29:52.611 --> 01:29:53.591
Wow.

01:29:53.712 --> 01:30:02.336
I thought, given what had happened and all the pushback and all the intervening time, I thought that this would eventually come to pass, but I would be long in the ground when it happened.

01:30:02.696 --> 01:30:07.199
So to see it happen so suddenly in the context of this amazing public health crisis we're in.

01:30:08.019 --> 01:30:11.281
Amazing public health crisis we're in.

01:30:13.403 --> 01:30:15.453
What a poor choice of words that was.

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:16.740
It's mind-boggling.

01:30:18.089 --> 01:30:32.079
Furthermore, the levels of activity of these lipoplexes, that's the technical term for these small nano aggregates of RNA and lipids that are formed, which are what allows the RNA to go into cells.

01:30:32.799 --> 01:30:35.721
Lipoplexes, what an interesting thing to call them.

01:30:35.781 --> 01:30:39.764
So they're not just simple little viral-like particles, little fat bubbles?

01:30:40.524 --> 01:30:41.825
They're more complex than that?

01:30:41.845 --> 01:30:41.885
Oh.

01:30:47.577 --> 01:30:48.597
and be produced into protein.

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:54.459
Um, the, the level of efficient efficiency associated with those, uh, is mind blowing to me.

01:30:54.939 --> 01:31:07.202
Um, and, uh, I, in particular, I think the unsung hero in this song here is, uh, Dr. Peter Cullis and his team, um, who developed the core, this advanced new, uh, um, he's selling it.

01:31:08.843 --> 01:31:10.143
He's selling the shot.

01:31:10.803 --> 01:31:12.384
Peter Cullis figured it out.

01:31:13.224 --> 01:31:14.024
Holy shit.

01:31:17.981 --> 01:31:19.823
There's not a warning, there's an endorsement.

01:31:22.006 --> 01:31:26.412
There's not a warning, there's an endorsement in this video.

01:31:30.597 --> 01:31:30.998
Blow it to me.

01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:49.460
And in particular, I think the unsung hero in this song here is Dr. Peter Collis and his team, who developed the core, this advanced new formulations of lipids that are directly being used by both the BioNTech Pfizer product and the CureVac product.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.241
The Moderna product is a slight variation on the same.

01:31:52.022 --> 01:31:53.643
The activity of those is mind-blowing.

01:31:53.683 --> 01:31:56.244
So I... Mind-blowing.

01:31:57.398 --> 01:31:58.478
Mind-blowing.

01:31:58.538 --> 01:32:05.080
He's describing the activity of these transfection vehicles as mind-blowing.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.901
Stop lying!

01:32:10.722 --> 01:32:12.182
Never expected to see this in my lifetime.

01:32:12.762 --> 01:32:19.764
Um, and, uh, it's, uh, I'm fascinated, but with that high level of transfection activity of, you know, polynucleotide delivery ability.

01:32:20.264 --> 01:32:20.885
What did he call it?

01:32:21.265 --> 01:32:22.705
Transfection activity?

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:23.966
What?

01:32:25.266 --> 01:32:25.526
Huh?

01:32:28.837 --> 01:32:34.781
Maybe we should call it transfection in 2021 and then everybody will be able to exercise informed consent and avoid it.

01:32:37.123 --> 01:32:51.993
I'm fascinated, but with that high level of transfection activity of polynucleotide delivery ability, there comes... What part of me is not completely and totally vindicated by that one line right there?

01:32:53.396 --> 01:32:54.737
Never mind his CV.

01:32:54.777 --> 01:32:57.499
Never mind all the other things that you can find on the internet.

01:32:57.539 --> 01:32:59.020
That one line right there, they know.

01:32:59.381 --> 01:32:59.761
They knew.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:04.225
They could have used that word every day and twice on Sunday if they wanted to.

01:33:05.125 --> 01:33:08.408
He could have told that to Brett Weinstein in the first 10 minutes.

01:33:08.448 --> 01:33:09.649
Well, these are transfections.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:10.329
I'm an expert.

01:33:12.431 --> 01:33:13.272
They didn't do it.

01:33:15.509 --> 01:33:41.765
they interchange the word gene therapy and vaccines just like these two clowns are interchanging the words genes vaccine and gene therapy and vaccine and transfection and vaccine and these vaccines and these vaccines and that's not how this works you can't call everything a vaccine just because you squirted in and you have some intentions

01:33:45.819 --> 01:33:56.281
And this disingenuous word game is at the heart of the coercive psychological operation that they executed on us, that these people executed on us.

01:33:57.861 --> 01:33:59.562
These are traitors to their countries.

01:34:02.402 --> 01:34:10.804
Misleading thousands, if not millions of citizens around the world about what really happens and what really can happen and what really can't.

01:34:14.577 --> 01:34:23.284
and waging a semantic war where no one can be precise enough to enable informed consent, to execute informed consent.

01:34:26.366 --> 01:34:30.930
Consequences, as you know, in drug development, nothing is free and no drug is perfectly safe.

01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:34.512
And so- Why is he smiling?

01:34:37.174 --> 01:34:40.417
Gosh, I wish I could see this person in person again.

01:34:42.182 --> 01:34:45.324
I can't wait to see this person in person again.

01:34:45.684 --> 01:34:54.030
With this amazing advance in efficiency, come some potential issues which I think we need to be sensitive to.

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:57.973
Now, this is a sensitive topic because, as I said, we're in the middle of a pandemic.

01:34:58.533 --> 01:35:02.836
there is a lot of pressure politically to try and get out of it with regards to vaccines.

01:35:02.876 --> 01:35:10.002
And a major part of it, especially with some of the other side effects that we're seeing from some of the other vaccine candidates, it looks as though the mRNA technology is leading the way.

01:35:10.803 --> 01:35:17.548
Oh, so he's already putting down the narrative that they're going to have to pull the adenovirus-based shots because those are having some side effects.

01:35:17.908 --> 01:35:20.250
It looks like the mRNA is doing better.

01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:28.276
That's no different than the little joke they did on Saturday Night Live where the Johnson & Johnson is for you guys because I get Moderna.

01:35:31.271 --> 01:35:32.292
You don't think that happened?

01:35:33.412 --> 01:35:34.873
You probably don't remember that happened.

01:35:34.913 --> 01:35:35.794
I'll find it right now.

01:35:36.394 --> 01:35:37.435
I'll show it to you right now.

01:35:38.795 --> 01:35:40.576
I should have downloaded it already, but I didn't.

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:44.599
They actually made a joke on Saturday Night Live about that.

01:35:51.083 --> 01:35:51.643
They really did.

01:35:54.676 --> 01:36:15.627
most vulnerable now have some degree of protection states and getting vaccines into their older population the majority of baby boomers have been vaccinated have been vaccinated have been vaccinated vaccinated vaccinated okay so let's wait let's find out when this was first posted on on snl march 28th 2021 baby boomers

01:36:22.389 --> 01:36:25.391
Most vulnerable now have some degree of protection.

01:36:25.411 --> 01:36:28.252
States are getting vaccines into their older population.

01:36:28.412 --> 01:36:31.334
The majority of baby boomers have been vaccinated.

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:55.289
baby boomers greatest generation got all the money now we got the vaccination crash the economy three whole times but when it comes to the vax we the first in line got a job out of college no student debt retirement funded a hundred percent voted for trump but just for the taxes don't believe in covid still got the vaccine

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.551
This is kind of like encouraging old people.

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:26.899
This is making a a This is really evil

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.562
So here they're trying to say that she doesn't need a mask because she's got a vax.

01:37:40.602 --> 01:37:47.585
You see, this is all the same propaganda machine that lied to us and coerced us and separated us and divided us.

01:37:48.126 --> 01:37:55.229
And Brett Weinstein and these people are all part of that same narrative, that same group of coordinated liars.

01:37:57.264 --> 01:37:58.785
to me in the bank account.

01:38:27.604 --> 01:38:33.526
And right embedded in the middle of it is the immunomythology that antibodies are how you fight viruses.

01:38:33.546 --> 01:38:38.368
That antibodies are a correlate of immunity that translate to something that allow your doctor to see.

01:38:57.554 --> 01:39:01.817
that companies can build detectors for, diagnostics for.

01:39:04.119 --> 01:39:19.911
And that's why Kevin McKernan was promoted so early in the pandemic and made sure that he did podcast appearances and that he wrote that paper at the beginning of the pandemic with the Dutch guy, Peter Borger.

01:39:21.784 --> 01:39:29.867
Not objecting to PCR testing as a diagnostic, but objecting to the methodologies that were purported to be advocated for by the WHO.

01:39:31.687 --> 01:39:33.328
So just test, just different ones.

01:39:36.549 --> 01:39:41.771
And now let's listen to the worst part of this song and the funniest part of this song, the immunomythology part.

01:39:45.381 --> 01:39:51.563
So they're already setting up the idea in 2021 that the housing market is going to be destroyed in 2022 and 2023.

01:39:51.743 --> 01:39:52.064
And that

01:40:12.921 --> 01:40:19.387
The way that it's gonna be destroyed is that all of these houses are gonna be bought up because they're all owned by old people.

01:40:22.089 --> 01:40:26.033
And that no one's ever gonna live large like these people again.

01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:30.597
March, 2021.

01:40:32.379 --> 01:40:38.184
They're already preparing us for the death of the American dream here on Saturday Night Live with lots of funny.

01:40:41.064 --> 01:40:43.226
I mean, they say it right in your face.

01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:44.267
We've been running the world since 1945.

01:40:44.727 --> 01:40:47.569
We've crashed the economy three times.

01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:48.150
They say it out loud.

01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:49.511
I don't want to do that anymore.

01:40:49.531 --> 01:40:50.091
I want to watch.

01:40:50.111 --> 01:40:50.892
I want to watch Robert.

01:41:11.075 --> 01:41:11.455
alone.

01:41:13.376 --> 01:41:16.518
So you've made a good point is that there is the opportunity to make a difference.

01:41:16.578 --> 01:41:20.861
But as always with any technology there are risks or potential problems.

01:41:21.621 --> 01:41:22.762
This is an important topic.

01:41:22.982 --> 01:41:30.386
What have you come across recently that would make you think about consideration of how we approach vaccination at this point.

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:32.002
So thanks for that.

01:41:32.142 --> 01:41:33.323
And let me frame that up a little bit.

01:41:34.324 --> 01:41:39.968
I was alerted from a colleague that worked for the government, let's say, US government, that was in Wuhan during the last month of 2019.

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:46.292
I was alerted in the first week of 2020 about the threat that the virus represented.

01:41:46.993 --> 01:41:48.454
And I made a threat assessment.

01:41:48.474 --> 01:41:51.256
I'm an experienced outbreak specialist that does a lot of biodefense work these days.

01:41:51.896 --> 01:41:52.417
mostly with the U.S.

01:41:52.437 --> 01:41:52.677
government.

01:41:53.017 --> 01:41:58.141
And so I made a threat assessment and made a... What a weird thing to say like 25 minutes into the thing.

01:41:58.241 --> 01:42:02.484
I'm a guy, I'm an outbreak expert that does a lot of defense work with the U.S.

01:42:02.524 --> 01:42:02.925
government.

01:42:06.347 --> 01:42:08.269
That seemed like kind of just thrown out there.

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:08.869
That's weird.

01:42:09.149 --> 01:42:12.432
Because in the next interview, he's going to say DITRA, right?

01:42:12.552 --> 01:42:13.653
And DOD and WE.

01:42:14.313 --> 01:42:16.635
That's how he talks to Paul Cutrell about it in August.

01:42:18.276 --> 01:42:19.237
It's a really interesting

01:42:21.497 --> 01:42:24.539
of 2020 about the threat that the virus represented.

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.681
And I made a threat assessment.

01:42:26.701 --> 01:42:30.643
I'm an experienced outbreak specialist that does a lot of biodefense work these days, mostly with the U.S.

01:42:30.663 --> 01:42:30.883
government.

01:42:31.243 --> 01:42:40.088
And so I made a threat assessment and made a personal determination that the most efficient way to help provide protection was to focus on drug repurposing, not on vaccine development.

01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:45.091
Now, the government of the United States made a different assessment and different decision, and I don't want to second guess that.

01:42:46.112 --> 01:42:51.654
That's a really weird statement to make because if the government made a different decision, then what was the domain program?

01:42:54.095 --> 01:42:55.716
He made a personal assessment.

01:42:58.797 --> 01:42:59.157
The U.S.

01:42:59.177 --> 01:43:01.178
government didn't fund the domain program.

01:43:01.198 --> 01:43:02.618
The domain program didn't happen.

01:43:02.658 --> 01:43:03.859
Then what's going to go on here?

01:43:05.615 --> 01:43:06.396
It's water under the bridge.

01:43:06.656 --> 01:43:14.901
And I can tell you, having been through too many of these outbreaks, when it hits and the fog of war hits, it becomes very difficult to process information and make decisions.

01:43:16.002 --> 01:43:31.372
This decision was made by the government to pursue vaccine technology because there was apparently, by these emails that have come out recently from The Washington Post under FOIA, there was a sense that this was the best way to move forward, is to invest all capital and effort into vaccine development.

01:43:32.413 --> 01:43:35.075
And the NIH, as well as BioNTech back in

01:43:36.015 --> 01:43:40.939
EU made a strategic assessment to invest in RNA-based approaches, which was quite bold.

01:43:42.259 --> 01:43:44.381
And that decision has been validated.

01:43:45.982 --> 01:43:47.863
And so I've watched with great interest as this has proceeded.

01:43:49.304 --> 01:43:56.048
Recently, because of my background, and I'm a clinical development specialist, I'm experienced in toxicology and regulatory affairs and other things.

01:43:56.108 --> 01:43:57.369
This is what I do for a living these days.

01:43:59.771 --> 01:44:04.234
I was approached by some individuals to- I thought he does defense work.

01:44:05.734 --> 01:44:10.620
I thought he just said a minute ago that he's an outbreak specialist and does defense work, primary for the U.S.

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:11.061
government.

01:44:11.121 --> 01:44:13.685
Now he's telling, now he says something else.

01:44:14.365 --> 01:44:19.652
Because of my background, and I'm a clinical development specialist, I'm experienced in toxicology and regulatory affairs and other things.

01:44:19.672 --> 01:44:20.954
This is what I do for a living these days.

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:38.731
I was approached by some individuals to provide an independent assessment of some data that had been revealed through a Freedom of Information Act submitted by a group of Canadian scientists and physicians, which had obtained a copy of the

01:44:40.012 --> 01:44:45.755
application which Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted for their mRNA vaccine to the regulatory authorities in Japan.

01:44:45.795 --> 01:44:48.196
And this is a, forgive me, there's some technical words here.

01:44:49.057 --> 01:44:52.698
This was their initial new drug application or their common technical document.

01:44:52.718 --> 01:44:53.539
These are regulatory terms.

01:44:53.839 --> 01:44:57.901
What it means is it's the information package that a drug developer or sponsor, in this case, vaccine developer.

01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:00.042
He hasn't said Byron Bridle's name yet.

01:45:00.782 --> 01:45:08.086
Would submit to a government regulatory authority that basically says, here's the sum total of all of our data at this point in time, supporting the use of this product in humans.

01:45:08.766 --> 01:45:16.348
And so normally these packages of information are closely held confidential and are not discoverable by Freedom of Information Act.

01:45:16.688 --> 01:45:18.928
They're usually protected from that, and that's certainly the case in the United States.

01:45:18.948 --> 01:45:28.971
But these Canadian scientists and physicians who were very concerned about some of the safety signals that they were seeing in vaccine recipients in Canada decided to, of their own initiative, to seek more information.

01:45:29.671 --> 01:45:43.417
And so they obtained this, and within 24 hours, I was asked by the editor-in-chief of an organization called Trial Site News in the United States to look at this document and another document that... Trial Site News asked him to look at documents?

01:45:43.557 --> 01:45:51.141
Trial Site News is the one that promoted Kevin McCarran and Kevin McKernan in the same damn article about four months ago in March of 2024.

01:45:53.609 --> 01:45:55.671
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:45:55.731 --> 01:46:00.455
And in fact, he has informed LifeSite News a lot, and they have promoted him a lot.

01:46:01.756 --> 01:46:03.557
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:46:03.677 --> 01:46:19.510
One big national security operation run by Five Eyes Countries to convince the world of a pandemic, to roll out transfection under the guise of the V word, and to keep people confused long enough so that they could be coerced into taking it.

01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:21.051
And it didn't work.

01:46:21.872 --> 01:46:22.812
They're off script.

01:46:23.766 --> 01:46:25.388
Not enough of us took the shot.

01:46:25.948 --> 01:46:31.633
They have a very, very big problem because a lot of us are not ever going to take a shot again.

01:46:33.816 --> 01:46:41.923
And so there's going to become a crucial point in America where they're going to start telling us how many people have and how many people haven't taken one of these shots.

01:46:41.983 --> 01:46:44.926
And you're going to have to believe me, they're going to lie about it.

01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:54.076
They're gonna lie about it because they want to eliminate the control group by any means necessary and it is still an objective.

01:46:55.857 --> 01:46:58.780
It is still a checkbox that they have not been able to hit.

01:47:00.461 --> 01:47:12.432
And his job and Malone's job and Corey's job and Weinstein's job and all of their jobs was to make sure that we would hit it by making us solve the lab leak.

01:47:13.351 --> 01:47:32.775
mystery of the lab leak and find out that it's a gain-of-function virus it might be flying aids we sure got lucky with this gain-of-function spike but now there might be a highly infectious omicron variant that comes out of belgium maybe some garage in belgium

01:47:35.646 --> 01:47:45.372
was publicly available from the European Medicines Agency that was their official summary of their assessment of the analogous initial new drug application and common technical document that had been submitted to them.

01:47:45.732 --> 01:47:48.034
Can I stop you here a minute, Robert, before you go any further?

01:47:48.074 --> 01:47:52.316
Because we're speaking live, and this information is being shared publicly.

01:47:52.676 --> 01:48:01.021
And you are walking in an area here that is not well taken, where you are saying stuff that can be challenging to the political narrative with regards to vaccines.

01:48:01.241 --> 01:48:02.923
Are you sure you want to speak about this?

01:48:03.423 --> 01:48:05.144
Yeah, so thank you.

01:48:07.358 --> 01:48:08.879
Are you sure you want to go here?

01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.522
I mean, be careful, Robert.

01:48:11.682 --> 01:48:13.363
Are you sure you want to go here?

01:48:13.403 --> 01:48:16.666
Because this is very thin ice.

01:48:19.008 --> 01:48:21.010
I mean, I just want to double check Robert Malone.

01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:24.753
I don't want you to risk too much of your personal reputation.

01:48:25.213 --> 01:48:29.257
I don't want you to put too much on the line to save anybody.

01:48:33.274 --> 01:48:36.558
holy shit, forgiving me the opportunity to pause and reconsider.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.383
I'm, I'm really committed to openness and transparency.

01:48:40.564 --> 01:48:44.268
And part of that comes from the background of the crucible that I've had to go through.

01:48:44.829 --> 01:48:49.115
But it also comes from the extensive training I've had in in bioethics.

01:48:49.355 --> 01:49:03.159
Holy shit, he's got extensive training in bioethics too, as well as clinical product development and review committees and also biodefense, works a lot with the US government on biodefense and stuff and outbreak specialists.

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:23.852
also does x-ray crystallography models of enzymes, and also can run an AI program that can screen an entire library of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals that are in the FDA catalog, which he still, strangely enough, hasn't mentioned at all.

01:49:24.997 --> 01:49:35.798
He said he made a personal decision, a personal decision to pursue repurposed drugs, even though the government didn't, but DITRA did.

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:47.823
And I'm personally, as a physician, scientist, clinical development specialist, I have a really bedrock commitment to fundamental principles of bioethics.

01:49:47.863 --> 01:49:52.944
And among those is transparency and the importance of full disclosure to protect.

01:49:52.964 --> 01:49:56.706
I mean, how often is he going to tell us how ethical of a man he is?

01:49:57.886 --> 01:50:01.647
How often is he going to tell us that he fights for the rights and credit of others?

01:50:02.087 --> 01:50:06.709
How often is he going to tell us that he's been he's like the best guy ever?

01:50:10.174 --> 01:50:11.094
Holy shit.

01:50:13.976 --> 01:50:18.157
This is a guy who Jiki Leaks says is a pretty decent dude.

01:50:18.998 --> 01:50:25.000
He worked for Ditra before, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say he's a bad guy.

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:25.501
I don't know.

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:35.605
Just like, because Jessica Rose apparently hasn't tried to out Jiki Leaks, then she's gotta be a good guy.

01:50:39.195 --> 01:50:40.815
I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it.

01:50:41.156 --> 01:50:46.237
And I'm not buying the idea that Jicky Leaks can't see this guy for who he is.

01:50:46.357 --> 01:50:47.217
I'm not buying it.

01:50:52.338 --> 01:51:02.621
Jicky Leaks is probably on their team, pretending to be the leader of a out-of-control chaos mouse army that opposes all these people.

01:51:04.929 --> 01:51:15.834
and keeps nudging everybody around all the time, but I don't see how it's possible to watch a video of this guy in 2021 and not realize that he is practicing a lie here.

01:51:19.156 --> 01:51:25.619
Is Jiki gonna be able to ignore that in about 15 minutes, he's gonna say that his housekeeper has questions about this shit?

01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:51.296
just like in a couple weeks we're gonna hear from Steve Kirsch in the same year saying yeah my housekeeper and her husband and somebody else like three people related to my housekeeper have been injured by the shots so that can't be random it is a coordinated group of traitorous liars it is a network that spans the five eyes countries

01:51:53.427 --> 01:52:02.609
And it is so often, so often, someone from the UK collaborating with someone from America like the shit you're watching right now.

01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:04.869
Receiving experimental products.

01:52:05.549 --> 01:52:06.929
So I'm comfortable continuing to speak.

01:52:07.289 --> 01:52:17.391
I'm an experienced professional, regulatory professional, and I hope that you don't, the audience doesn't in any way infer that I am invested in a contrary position regarding.

01:52:17.551 --> 01:52:22.012
Jiki Leaks hasn't blocked me, so he's not against me, but he doesn't agree with everything that I say.

01:52:23.063 --> 01:52:27.185
And one of the things that he doesn't agree with is that Robert Malone is an obvious bad guy.

01:52:28.746 --> 01:52:45.595
One of the things that Jiki Leaks won't say is that this guy who's been touring around the world for four years straight with Peter Kory and Meryl Ness and Shoshana Topova and David Martin, that these must all be good guys, I guess, according to Jiki.

01:52:46.857 --> 01:52:52.860
Jeeki's focused on Nick Hudson, because Nick Hudson used to work for insurance companies, so he's gotta be a bad guy.

01:52:53.180 --> 01:53:03.125
But the guy who works for Ditra, and the guy who worked for Retrovirus, the priests of retrovirology, he couldn't possibly be a bad guy, no way.

01:53:06.427 --> 01:53:07.547
Wake up, Jeeki.

01:53:09.548 --> 01:53:13.630
Pull your head out, or I'm gonna start calling you for the meddler you are.

01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:16.452
This guy is at the center of it.

01:53:17.898 --> 01:53:22.361
And he's been at the center of this shit for 20 years in my country.

01:53:24.402 --> 01:53:26.284
Meddling with my nation.

01:53:28.545 --> 01:53:34.750
And the fact that you won't speak out about him at all says that you're probably meddling in my nation too.

01:53:35.782 --> 01:53:38.844
which is the same reason why Nick Hudson won't really call him out.

01:53:39.224 --> 01:53:41.165
Why Jonathan Engler just ignores him.

01:53:41.545 --> 01:53:43.786
Why Jessica Hockett never mentions his name.

01:53:44.187 --> 01:53:56.753
And Jessica Hockett couldn't figure out that Pierre Corey was a witness for freaking, for George Floyd and on papers that cited Kyle Seidel's work.

01:53:58.734 --> 01:54:03.557
Because they're all part of the same network of liars that's trying to get us not to focus on the right people.

01:54:06.041 --> 01:54:09.846
Not to focus on the right laws, not to focus on the right questions.

01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:12.969
Double-stranded DNA.

01:54:14.431 --> 01:54:16.894
Retroviruses in every hospital.

01:54:19.917 --> 01:54:23.762
I worked on packaging proteins, packaging sequences.

01:54:27.836 --> 01:54:50.118
packaging sequences he said packaging sequences that he cloned and transformed into cell cultures to see which ones would make exosomes he freaking said it and none of these no virus people picked up on it not from their cozy little lord of the rings island

01:54:51.724 --> 01:54:56.465
not from the woods of New York, not from a farm wherever he is.

01:54:56.705 --> 01:55:03.267
None of these no virus people picked up on the fact that he just said it in an interview casually.

01:55:03.727 --> 01:55:09.608
And in another interview, he says that most of the particles that are produced are replication incompetent anyway.

01:55:09.648 --> 01:55:16.310
And the only reason why he would know that is because of what he said in this interview and the work that that represented or comes from.

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.003
I'm sorry, but I don't think there's any way to see it any other way.

01:55:23.083 --> 01:55:37.616
These people have been working on a covert program to understand our molecular biology that includes retroviruses and includes exosomes that can have genetic material in them.

01:55:38.456 --> 01:55:42.640
Maybe even, very briefly, have self-replicating RNAs in them.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:43.101
I don't know.

01:55:44.195 --> 01:55:46.757
But if they found this stuff, they lied to us about it.

01:55:47.198 --> 01:55:52.422
And they told us it wasn't part of us so that they could study it and eventually use it against us.

01:55:53.883 --> 01:56:04.393
Because if viruses are from us, if exosomes are from us and they're studying us, then there are entirely different ethical concerns here.

01:56:04.813 --> 01:56:09.197
If they are pathogens and it's public health, then your ethics can be damned.

01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:20.912
Ladies and gentlemen, they have stolen our biology and told us it was outside of us, and Robert Malone is at the heart of it.

01:56:22.012 --> 01:56:26.895
At the heart of the theft, at the heart of the lie, wittingly or unwittingly, he's participating in it.

01:56:27.715 --> 01:56:36.920
I think it's almost certain that Tony Fauci knows, it's almost certain that Robert Gallo knows, it's almost certain that David Baltimore knows, and that means that it's almost certain

01:56:37.765 --> 01:56:57.078
that Judy Mickiewicz knows, and it's almost certain that Robert Malone knows, and that's the exact same reason and supporting reason why those two characters never come together, never have had a debate or a discussion, never have debunked each other or validated each other.

01:56:57.879 --> 01:57:03.543
They've only been in music videos together made by Mickey Willis' crew.

01:57:08.103 --> 01:57:14.810
The illusion is breaking, ladies and gentlemen, because the truth is still available on YouTube.

01:57:16.672 --> 01:57:16.992
Vaccines.

01:57:17.653 --> 01:57:19.014
I'm not an anti-vaxxer.

01:57:19.334 --> 01:57:22.497
I've spent my whole life developing vaccines and trying to advance vaccines.

01:57:23.198 --> 01:57:29.664
But that doesn't override my commitment to transparency and disclosure and good science.

01:57:29.685 --> 01:57:30.846
He's saying it again!

01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:41.310
he's so ethically can stop talking about how ethically is it's i'm i'm of the belief that the public is that adult public is mature enough

01:57:42.442 --> 01:57:45.823
to make their own informed decisions based on the information available.

01:57:46.363 --> 01:57:54.045
And that it's the obligation of governments and public health organizations, particularly in the context of an experimental product like these vaccines all are right now.

01:57:54.966 --> 01:57:58.407
It's the obligation of the public health community, the official public health community, to convince the public that they're safe.

01:57:58.427 --> 01:58:00.567
But this is all illusion of consensus.

01:58:00.847 --> 01:58:03.028
This is all illusion of consensus too, right?

01:58:03.108 --> 01:58:05.268
These don't have to be real people.

01:58:05.328 --> 01:58:06.389
They could be real people.

01:58:06.429 --> 01:58:07.129
It doesn't matter.

01:58:07.169 --> 01:58:10.410
It creates an illusion of consensus that the people in the chat

01:58:11.090 --> 01:58:31.125
also think he's a trustworthy guy not only philip but also the people in the chat really believe the most interesting man in the world you know the most interesting man in the world you know that right he's got a little commercial it's the most interesting man in the world

01:58:39.062 --> 01:58:39.643
Isn't there one?

01:58:39.963 --> 01:58:40.904
I don't know where that is.

01:58:40.924 --> 01:58:42.165
I thought I downloaded it.

01:58:42.205 --> 01:58:43.667
I won't be able to find it off the top.

01:58:44.408 --> 01:58:49.573
But he did a whole commercial where he made fun of himself being the most interesting man in the world.

01:58:49.633 --> 01:58:51.675
Just like that Miller Lite commercial or whatever.

01:58:51.695 --> 01:58:52.316
But it was him.

01:58:53.097 --> 01:58:54.098
With a glass of wine.

01:58:55.319 --> 01:58:55.979
They did that.

01:58:57.201 --> 01:58:58.142
Him and Mickey Willis.

01:59:00.583 --> 01:59:06.870
of governments and public health organizations, particularly in the context of an experimental product like these vaccines all are right now.

01:59:07.771 --> 01:59:11.635
It's the obligation of the public health community, the official public health community, to convince the public that they're safe and effective.

01:59:12.826 --> 01:59:15.627
And so I'm totally OK with proceeding.

01:59:16.267 --> 01:59:17.228
And I'm a grown up too.

01:59:17.568 --> 01:59:21.729
And if I say something that's controversial and I start getting hate mail, that's part of the price I have to pay.

01:59:22.290 --> 01:59:30.132
But it doesn't, I've been through situations before where I have gone public about major ethical issues that I've encountered in

01:59:32.276 --> 01:59:36.820
in this kind of technology development space and drug development space and clinical research space.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:39.442
And I've had consequences in my career.

01:59:39.682 --> 01:59:43.525
He's hinting at the Jesse Gelsinger story.

01:59:44.105 --> 01:59:48.809
And one thing you should know about Jesse Gelsinger is the investigation was done by Endoverma.

01:59:49.818 --> 01:59:55.882
So him speaking out could have been a coordinated thing with him and his supervisor.

01:59:55.922 --> 02:00:06.149
Now remember, one of the very interesting things here would be that if that PTSD and that apparent split between him and Inder Verma was actually just a lie.

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:07.569
It's just a scam.

02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:09.731
It's just part of their little schtick.

02:00:12.332 --> 02:00:13.532
because that's how they do it.

02:00:13.572 --> 02:00:22.076
Just like Matt Crawford stormed out of the Signal Chat with Alexandros Marinos and Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson.

02:00:22.716 --> 02:00:25.697
He stormed out like he was all pissed because nobody's listening to me.

02:00:26.177 --> 02:00:28.258
Nobody will listen to me about the DMED data.

02:00:30.839 --> 02:00:37.962
And then a few weeks later, I left that Signal Chat group and went to Matt thinking that, yeah, but Matt, they don't listen to me either.

02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:47.275
And so now whether you believe Inder Verma or whether you believe Robert Malone, you're going to believe a liar probably.

02:00:50.399 --> 02:00:57.025
Or if Inder Verma says something that isn't jiving with what Robert Malone says, Robert Malone can claim he's a liar.

02:00:57.846 --> 02:01:00.309
You know, he also sexually harasses people and stuff.

02:01:01.377 --> 02:01:13.387
Maybe that's how they're controlling Inder Verma and keeping him quiet or kept him quiet about the details of retrovirology versus endosomes and exosomal communication.

02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:23.276
There's lots of possibilities here that are not discussed when you make the assumption that Robert Malone is a 20-year

02:01:24.884 --> 02:01:26.425
track record of being a hero.

02:01:27.165 --> 02:01:33.028
A 20-year unblemished track record of integrity inside of a den of vipers.

02:01:35.569 --> 02:01:37.110
That's what he's trying to paint here.

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:42.452
Cutthroat, lying, stealing, cheating bastards in science.

02:01:42.913 --> 02:01:45.854
And I'm just a shining beacon of truth and integrity.

02:01:52.128 --> 02:01:53.249
He's insisting on it.

02:01:54.389 --> 02:02:03.515
But that doesn't absolve me from the obligation that I think I have to be open and transparent about information.

02:02:03.535 --> 02:02:08.397
How many freaking times is he going to say that he feels very important that it's open and transparent shit?

02:02:11.979 --> 02:02:12.740
Can you see it?

02:02:14.721 --> 02:02:16.282
The illusion is being laid.

02:02:17.469 --> 02:02:23.014
The neuro-linguistic programming, as ham-fistedly as it is being done here, is being done.

02:02:24.315 --> 02:02:25.476
He's repeating things.

02:02:27.257 --> 02:02:31.481
He's insisting on certain concepts to be associated with his dumbass.

02:02:34.503 --> 02:02:36.805
I'm sorry, but this guy has got to be done.

02:02:36.965 --> 02:02:38.066
It's got to be over.

02:02:38.687 --> 02:02:42.670
Anybody that's promoting this guy has to be automatically disqualified.

02:02:44.528 --> 02:02:50.294
Anybody that's not actively saying that Robert Malone is part of this has to be disqualified at this point.

02:02:56.381 --> 02:03:02.547
Quite frankly, I think if you think that Jessica Rose is good, you need to be disqualified at this point.

02:03:02.628 --> 02:03:06.472
She rapped on stage in Geneva.

02:03:12.421 --> 02:03:18.026
with the blessing of all of these people, these performers that all were in Geneva at the same time.

02:03:18.866 --> 02:03:22.950
Weinstein, Malone, Kirsch, Rose, it was gross.

02:03:25.311 --> 02:03:29.715
Pushing the idea that the shots in America is bad because of the shots.

02:03:32.297 --> 02:03:34.759
Who did Jessica Rose save in Israel?

02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:38.062
Who did Jessica Rose save in Canada?

02:03:39.758 --> 02:03:48.972
What tenure track position did Jessica Rose lose when she spoke out about VAERS having a signal now that it didn't have before?

02:03:54.498 --> 02:03:58.421
which is relevant and in my opinion should be made publicly available.

02:03:58.761 --> 02:04:00.042
Well, that is tremendous.

02:04:00.303 --> 02:04:07.508
And we do appreciate that because we do need scientists like yourself who are studying and able to challenge and make sure that everything that we do is as safe as possible.

02:04:07.528 --> 02:04:08.569
So yes, please go ahead.

02:04:08.869 --> 02:04:09.890
We are very appreciative of that.

02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:11.571
So thank you for that support in those words.

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:14.353
Let me just kind of loop back just a little bit on that theme.

02:04:14.953 --> 02:04:21.215
It's interesting that he doesn't use the military lingo that he used when he talks to Andrew Huff or somebody else like that.

02:04:21.735 --> 02:04:23.855
Good copy and shit like that.

02:04:23.915 --> 02:04:25.816
With this guy, it's very flowery.

02:04:25.896 --> 02:04:28.116
And, you know, thanks a lot for that comment.

02:04:28.136 --> 02:04:31.517
Thanks for giving me a chance to reconsider before I blow my head off.

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:36.678
In my experience, in my strong opinion, science requires that we challenge each other.

02:04:37.378 --> 02:04:41.359
And if we don't do that, we end up with groupthink and we end up making mistakes.

02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:43.100
So continuing on the theme,

02:04:44.195 --> 02:04:52.781
These documents were provided to me and I was asked to render an opinion about what I saw as a professional with the level of, you know, the type of experience and background that I have.

02:04:52.841 --> 02:04:57.745
These documents that had been uncovered by my respected scientific and clinical colleagues in Canada.

02:04:59.046 --> 02:04:59.706
And so I made an opinion.

02:04:59.786 --> 02:05:06.091
Who I won't mention because if you mention them then you'll be able to find out who he is and you'll listen to him instead of me.

02:05:08.405 --> 02:05:09.246
independent assessment of those.

02:05:09.826 --> 02:05:14.611
And then I was concerned that I may have over interpreted or misinterpreted.

02:05:15.371 --> 02:05:27.402
And so I asked an even more senior regulatory specialist that I respect highly to look over the same documents and draw their own independent opinion to make sure that I wasn't over reading things or overreacting to them.

02:05:29.202 --> 02:05:29.783
So that happened.

02:05:31.043 --> 02:05:34.604
And I think that was he says that was Jeremy Marks, but I'm not sure.

02:05:35.645 --> 02:05:49.690
With those documents, we both observed that there were deficiencies that were highly unusual and not what we would anticipate seeing in a regulatory submission from an organization of the experience and capabilities of Pfizer.

02:05:51.190 --> 02:05:53.732
And that was, I found that a little bit alarming.

02:05:53.772 --> 02:05:54.372
So did my colleague.

02:05:54.892 --> 02:05:57.933
He was less sanguine about placing his name to his assessment.

02:05:58.654 --> 02:05:59.574
And so he remains anonymous.

02:06:00.034 --> 02:06:05.897
But I was comfortable that the assessment that I made was true and accurate based on the documents that I had.

02:06:06.997 --> 02:06:08.038
And I was very clear on that.

02:06:09.678 --> 02:06:12.340
So the findings included that

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:23.367
There were data in the IND package from Japan, data tables, that examined the biodistribution of the vaccine product in an animal model, in a rodent model.

02:06:24.110 --> 02:06:27.171
with limited numbers of samples using two core technologies.

02:06:27.251 --> 02:06:35.574
One was the one that I used way back in the day when I was finding RNA delivery, which is expression of proteins from an RNA encoding, the protein that makes the firefly tail glow.

02:06:36.074 --> 02:06:40.635
So it has the perhaps unfortunate name here in the States, where we have a strong religious community, of being luciferase.

02:06:41.796 --> 02:06:47.878
Luciferase is just the name that the discoverers that were trying to understand how come fireflies glow at night gave to the protein when they cloned it.

02:06:47.958 --> 02:06:51.959
And it turns out to be a super duper, we call it reporter protein, way to detect whether or not

02:06:52.759 --> 02:06:58.323
a polynucleotide and RNA or DNA has gotten into a cell and been turned into protein because it will produce photons and those are easy to detect.

02:06:58.783 --> 02:06:59.744
So a lot of technical there.

02:07:00.685 --> 02:07:12.654
So the studies were done in non-good laboratory practice means and they involved use of luciferase RNA rather than the actual RNA of the drug product encoding spike.

02:07:14.531 --> 02:07:15.732
And they involve tritiated RNA.

02:07:16.653 --> 02:07:24.341
So this is radioactively tagged RNA that is able to be detected very sensitively because it's radioactive in various tissues of the animal in which it's been injected.

02:07:24.782 --> 02:07:27.124
And so the data that I was able to review

02:07:27.952 --> 02:07:33.254
had to do with the distribution of injected RNA lipoplex complexes.

02:07:33.274 --> 02:07:33.994
We talked about that earlier.

02:07:34.154 --> 02:07:35.575
This is the actual material.

02:07:35.835 --> 02:07:39.116
Only it wasn't the actual material, which is what usually one has to do these studies with.

02:07:39.776 --> 02:07:44.658
It was a surrogate, the RNA for the luciferase instead of the RNA encoding the vaccine, which is encoding spike.

02:07:45.338 --> 02:07:51.861
So what the data showed was that in these rodent models, and it was small numbers of rodents,

02:07:52.722 --> 02:07:56.425
This is the opposite of a useful summary for a layperson.

02:07:56.485 --> 02:08:02.530
This is the opposite of trying to give a message because he is not giving a message.

02:08:02.591 --> 02:08:05.813
He's explaining something in the worst way possible.

02:08:08.856 --> 02:08:13.440
It didn't stay at the ejection site, could have been said 10 minutes ago already.

02:08:15.785 --> 02:08:27.670
And if you can't see this as a malevolent meddler working for the five eyes, intelligence, whatever's that did this to us, I don't know what to tell you.

02:08:32.031 --> 02:08:37.554
That the injected material, a lot of it stays near the injection site, but a lot of it doesn't.

02:08:38.454 --> 02:08:41.275
And it goes throughout the bodies of these mice or rats.

02:08:44.454 --> 02:08:49.216
It appears that it may have remained biologically active in some of those distal sites.

02:08:49.836 --> 02:08:55.738
It appears that it may have remained biologically active in some of those distal sites.

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:01.621
He's not trying to save anyone.

02:09:02.661 --> 02:09:04.722
He's trying to save the product.

02:09:05.765 --> 02:09:07.805
He's trying to save the narrative.

02:09:08.545 --> 02:09:17.107
He's trying to save the fear and uncertainty and doubt that this whole operation relied on in order to get maximum compliance in the oldest people.

02:09:24.528 --> 02:09:34.370
And it certainly, the data suggested, and the tables are a little difficult to follow for me because they analyze both the lipid distribution and the tritiated signal distribution, which is a marker of the RNA.

02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:41.577
They showed a high concentration and relative concentration into, for instance, ovarian tissue, spleen, and liver.

02:09:41.877 --> 02:09:43.879
But in particular, the ovarian tissue was surprising.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:50.021
And particularly it was surprising because there was not that concentration in the testis that were sampled from the male.

02:09:51.702 --> 02:09:53.982
So we had concentration of the lipids in particular in ovaries.

02:09:54.522 --> 02:09:59.183
And we had some relative concentration of the tritiated signal suggesting the RNA in the ovaries compared to some other tissues.

02:09:59.503 --> 02:10:03.564
But strikingly, we had distribution of all of this kind of systemically throughout these animal models.

02:10:04.085 --> 02:10:08.966
Is that what we would expect to a certain extent with regards to injecting a vaccine?

02:10:09.066 --> 02:10:10.246
Isn't there some degree of spread?

02:10:10.786 --> 02:10:12.247
Injecting a vaccine.

02:10:12.327 --> 02:10:23.015
So again, Dr. Philip McMillan being as inaccurate as possible and using the word vaccine whenever possible because these people are liars.

02:10:24.395 --> 02:10:27.197
Or do we expect it to remain local to where it was injected?

02:10:28.598 --> 02:10:30.880
Good question and entirely appropriate.

02:10:32.001 --> 02:10:37.865
And I had no way to... They are running through it right now.

02:10:39.178 --> 02:10:41.059
They are rehearsing it right now.

02:10:41.699 --> 02:10:47.280
They're trying to decide what they can say and what they can't say and how many words they can use to say it.

02:10:49.061 --> 02:10:51.081
How can they object without objecting?

02:10:51.541 --> 02:10:56.783
How can they pretend to be skeptical without giving anybody good reason not to be afraid?

02:10:57.639 --> 02:11:13.672
How can they accept the virus, but have some limited spectrum of debate that feels really lively, like this guy's really telling the truth, so that we can flash a couple comments up on the screen and make everybody watching think that everybody thinks he's telling the truth.

02:11:18.056 --> 02:11:20.078
This is the placement of Robert Malone.

02:11:21.209 --> 02:11:32.926
testing him out on a few foreign podcasts with a few clowns getting him ready to go to the big show which was the Brett Weinstein podcast and he knew it just like he knew it when he was going on Rogan.

02:11:33.346 --> 02:11:34.228
This is rehearsal.

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:40.739
possess because we didn't have the controls of alternatives.

02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:46.203
But yes, one would expect, to some degree, a spread of the injected material.

02:11:47.805 --> 02:11:48.785
I like that critique.

02:11:48.825 --> 02:11:55.170
Somebody in here says regarding the Five Eyes, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia and Oz are just colonies being used.

02:11:55.891 --> 02:11:57.673
for different things by the UK.

02:11:57.693 --> 02:11:59.174
So I would agree with that.

02:12:00.295 --> 02:12:04.018
It is more likely to need to focus also on Germany.

02:12:04.478 --> 02:12:06.620
And I would also agree with that wholeheartedly.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.142
Thank you very much for posting that.

02:12:08.202 --> 02:12:09.523
Good to see you in the chat there.

02:12:10.424 --> 02:12:16.589
Core thesis that had been advanced in the scientific literature before my... I'm glad I didn't lose you.

02:12:19.211 --> 02:12:20.832
I've lost a lot of people in my chat.

02:12:21.093 --> 02:12:22.454
I'm really happy to see you there.

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:30.698
I can only speak to my personal experience, my encountering these data in this IND package, IND being the abbreviation for initial lead drug application.

02:12:32.238 --> 02:12:38.720
My expectation from the literature was that the injected material and the encoded spike protein would remain membrane-bound and regional.

02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:49.383
I was aware that these complexes had been engineered as a formulation historically, specifically so that they would be transmitted along the lymphatic system.

02:12:50.103 --> 02:12:51.384
And I'm trained in pathology.

02:12:51.404 --> 02:12:52.505
I used to teach university pathology.

02:12:52.525 --> 02:12:56.909
And I know darn well that the lymphatic system drains into blood and circulates and passes through the liver and all that good stuff.

02:12:56.929 --> 02:12:59.512
This is fundamental biology and human physiology in mammals.

02:13:00.473 --> 02:13:09.461
So the prior publications and information have suggested that these complexes would remain at the site of injection or the draining nodes.

02:13:11.459 --> 02:13:20.303
The formulations were specifically engineered to preferentially go through lymphatics to the draining nodes, lymph nodes, which is where the immune system processes antigens and teaches B cells and T cells.

02:13:20.363 --> 02:13:23.184
And that's just the worst idea I've ever heard.

02:13:23.264 --> 02:13:37.670
So you want these lipid nanoparticles to go where the dormant T cells are, where the dormant B cells are, where the inactivated, not ready to, I mean, still waiting to be activated T cells are.

02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:52.459
I just, I cannot see how it is possible that anyone with any biological background at all can listen to this and say that they wanted the lipid nanoparticles to go to the draining lymph node.

02:13:56.642 --> 02:13:59.544
Not the, not the produced protein.

02:14:01.065 --> 02:14:05.908
Not little lipid rafts with the spike protein.

02:14:07.133 --> 02:14:15.396
He's talking about the lipid nanoparticles taking the RNA, being designed to take them to the draining lymph node and what?

02:14:15.496 --> 02:14:18.097
Transfect immune cells?

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:25.040
He just said it right there.

02:14:26.041 --> 02:14:36.785
Augmenting the immune system with a lipid nanoparticle transfection agent that is kind of designed to go back to the lymph node is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

02:14:42.628 --> 02:14:49.671
The prior publications and information had suggested that these complexes would remain at the site of injection or the draining nodes.

02:14:51.672 --> 02:15:02.776
The formulations were specifically engineered to preferentially go through lymphatics to the draining nodes, lymph nodes, which is where the immune system processes antigens and teaches B cells and T cells, these are the things that attack other cells or produce antibodies.

02:15:03.096 --> 02:15:07.158
So why in the shit would you just transfect as much as you can there?

02:15:09.161 --> 02:15:14.262
How would that usefully augment the immune system, Master Malone?

02:15:16.862 --> 02:15:38.486
Considering that there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of unique epitopes represented by the T cells in each lymph node waiting to be turned on if necessary and to clonally expand when called, why in the world would we want a lipid nanoparticle carrying a RNA encoding a foreign protein to go there?

02:15:40.188 --> 02:15:41.250
You dum-dum.

02:15:44.395 --> 02:15:46.499
What is going on, Philip McMillan?

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.550
Where did you learn your biology if you don't think that that's the stupidest shit you've ever heard?

02:15:56.778 --> 02:16:02.702
Um, teaches them, uh, educates them so that they make the proper immune response against the energy just for the, uh, for the viewership.

02:16:03.043 --> 02:16:06.565
Um, so, uh, that was the logic spike was engineered with a tether.

02:16:07.066 --> 02:16:13.911
Um, it, uh, transmembrane region, it was supposed to stay in the cells that it was, uh, that were in the region and, uh, it was not, uh,

02:16:14.571 --> 02:16:19.753
previously disclosed, let's say, in the literature, that it would move systemically in any kind of a systematic way.

02:16:19.833 --> 02:16:22.634
So for me, it was a surprise.

02:16:22.794 --> 02:16:25.616
And the relative concentration in certain organs was a bit of a surprise.

02:16:25.676 --> 02:16:27.936
You'd expect it to concentrate in spleen and in liver.

02:16:28.397 --> 02:16:38.861
The ovarian signal was a little surprising, more than a little surprising, a bit concerning, particularly since now we get into this intersection between these many reports that patients that are out there, that patients have made,

02:16:39.361 --> 02:16:41.503
And we have to be really careful because there's a selection bias.

02:16:41.823 --> 02:16:52.510
When somebody makes a spectacular claim, you know, I lost my baby, or I had, you know, my parents died, or, you know, right after vaccination, whatever, these things quickly catch fire in social media these days.

02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:58.774
And the truth is that all of these events would be expected to occur at some normal frequency.

02:16:59.577 --> 02:17:00.718
And for instance, there are those who say.

02:17:00.758 --> 02:17:04.659
He is not helping anyone usefully question what's happening.

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.181
He is creating more confusion.

02:17:07.221 --> 02:17:14.424
Well, don't be sure just because both your grandparents died after vaccination, that would kind of be expected to happen anyway at a certain frequency.

02:17:16.755 --> 02:17:18.116
I'm sorry, I gotta go eat dinner.

02:17:18.756 --> 02:17:19.857
I gotta break away now.

02:17:20.397 --> 02:17:22.458
This is a YouTube video.

02:17:22.879 --> 02:17:29.162
This is a video that has been archived by Mark Kulak on his Bitchute channel.

02:17:29.983 --> 02:17:33.705
This is a video that I will archive on my Peertube channel.

02:17:35.307 --> 02:17:49.711
And it is a video that continues to go on and on, the same kind of ham-fisted execution of this narrative curation, because they really don't realize how bad it's going in 2021.

02:17:49.771 --> 02:18:03.234
They think they can still pull out of the nosedive, that they're gonna get people to take the injection at the end of the year, because at the end of this year is when they go on TV and say that the world should expect a winter of

02:18:03.994 --> 02:18:06.215
of disease and death for the unvaccinated.

02:18:11.757 --> 02:18:14.258
So at this time, they still think they can get us.

02:18:14.978 --> 02:18:22.281
They still think that the lab leak and the Scooby-Doo mystery is gonna convince people that, well, I better get a vaccine if this was a gain-of-function virus.

02:18:24.702 --> 02:18:28.824
That's where we are in this narrative right now, at this time, in this video.

02:18:29.918 --> 02:18:44.664
They still think they have a chance at getting rid of the control group if they scare us enough about this gain-of-function virus and about the spike protein, which these two clowns will most certainly talk about in the coming minutes.

02:18:47.845 --> 02:18:50.346
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no other way to see it.

02:18:50.606 --> 02:18:56.289
These people are evil meddlers, and they want us

02:18:57.645 --> 02:19:10.358
to teach our children an illusion of consensus about bat cave viruses and laboratory viruses and genetically stitched viruses so that they surrender their sovereignty to this mythology.

02:19:11.539 --> 02:19:13.742
And it is a mythology that can be debunked.

02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:19.232
because it's just transformation and transfection in cell culture and in animals.

02:19:19.912 --> 02:19:23.174
It is just the cheap production of DNA and RNA.

02:19:24.054 --> 02:19:35.320
And it is the cheap use of transfection and transformation that can explain all and any of these phenomenon, including what they call virology in laboratories.

02:19:37.501 --> 02:19:44.845
And so instead of debunking virology in a few statements, we have spent four and a half years

02:19:46.778 --> 02:20:03.569
Instead of debunking transfection and transformation as not investigational vaccines and pulling everybody out of this nosedive in 2021, we are now here in 2024 with Brett Weinstein saying that not everybody understands what transfection means.

02:20:11.174 --> 02:20:11.995
It's very simple.

02:20:13.203 --> 02:20:17.606
You can't grow RNA that you find in the wild in a dish.

02:20:19.607 --> 02:20:25.911
If you want to do that, you're going to have to make a DNA copy of it by sequencing it and synthesizing it.

02:20:26.971 --> 02:20:31.814
And DNA, unlike RNA, is very high fidelity to copy, like a CD.

02:20:33.095 --> 02:20:35.977
And we have lots of ways to do it using bacteria.

02:20:36.357 --> 02:20:41.060
These are very old techniques that go back to Baltimore and Gallo.

02:20:45.094 --> 02:20:46.855
And so we can grow a lot of DNA.

02:20:46.875 --> 02:20:51.418
We can grow a lot of RNA and we can put it in places and find it with PCR and sequencing.

02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:55.801
We can also passage it in cell culture.

02:20:56.802 --> 02:20:59.384
We can use electroporation and all of these things.

02:20:59.424 --> 02:21:00.985
We can test for it and find it.

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:04.647
Doesn't necessarily mean we're proving that it's replicating.

02:21:05.308 --> 02:21:12.553
Not necessarily mean we're proving that it's virology, but these signals are makeable and they are detectable.

02:21:14.622 --> 02:21:34.132
And you can make very high quantities of them because there are industrial methods appropriate for making venom, appropriate for making any protein biologic, including antibodies that could be used to generate the DNA and RNA that these virologists call infectious clones.

02:21:36.033 --> 02:21:40.395
And yes, they could be made at an industrial scale as well, using all the same equipment.

02:21:45.233 --> 02:21:56.281
But the real thing you should be calling it is synthetic DNA in quantity, because that's all that's needed for the sequencing to work, for the PCR to work.

02:21:57.582 --> 02:22:00.764
They could transfect you to an immunogen that would cause symptoms.

02:22:02.025 --> 02:22:13.293
Maybe even they transfected people to the spike so that they would find it and then could justify the 45 minutes it took for Moderna to design the spike with a membrane anchor.

02:22:17.045 --> 02:22:19.626
Ladies and gentlemen, it's all about synthetic biology.

02:22:19.666 --> 02:22:21.046
It's the only thing that's real.

02:22:21.706 --> 02:22:29.828
If you haven't seen this interview with Gabe Mason that I did the other day, please watch it again because I do think I say some really interesting things in that video.

02:22:30.568 --> 02:22:37.809
And I do think that some of those things were taken and kind of used against me or pirated and pawned off as somebody else's ideas.

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:39.130
So be careful.

02:22:39.210 --> 02:22:40.990
It's important that you hear it so that you can

02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:46.415
hear these combination of words being crafted and used by me and then stolen by other people.

02:22:47.316 --> 02:23:03.213
Ladies and gentlemen, these people are part of the same narrative control curation group that Tony Fauci and Richard Ebright and Peter Daszak are all part of the same show that these people are part of.

02:23:04.997 --> 02:23:08.323
And that's really hard to accept for a lot of people, but it's definitely true.

02:23:08.343 --> 02:23:11.308
They are national security operatives.

02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:12.310
They are spies.

02:23:12.911 --> 02:23:14.073
They are intel agents.

02:23:14.634 --> 02:23:16.397
They are meddlers and they are traitors.

02:23:19.690 --> 02:23:29.056
And if you want to see them for what they are, I suggest one really good video to watch is Mark's video from today, Where in the World is Pierre Kory?

02:23:29.196 --> 02:23:30.036
was the title of it.

02:23:30.096 --> 02:23:36.480
Ladies and gentlemen, intravascular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:43.084
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:23:45.916 --> 02:23:50.460
Weaponized piles of money have murdered people and gotten people to agree about that being a lab leak.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:53.142
The old vaccine schedule was shit.

02:23:54.863 --> 02:24:03.631
And virology is just transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animal models with synthetic DNA and RNA.

02:24:05.307 --> 02:24:11.231
And for some reason or another, Andy Kaufman couldn't say that when he was arguing with Steve Kirsch last week.

02:24:12.112 --> 02:24:16.174
For some reason, Andy Kaufman couldn't say that for four years.

02:24:16.394 --> 02:24:19.537
And Tom Cowan hasn't been able to say it for four years.

02:24:20.397 --> 02:24:23.859
And Christine Massey keeps arguing about all the foyage she's collected.

02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:30.844
And Alex Zek keeps saying that they've proven virology's wrong with a control experiment.

02:24:30.884 --> 02:24:34.627
But you're not proving anything wrong if exosomes are everywhere.

02:24:37.004 --> 02:24:39.125
and transfection and transformation are real.

02:24:40.026 --> 02:24:46.710
Ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

02:24:46.730 --> 02:24:53.634
And if you liked what you saw, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to financially support this work because we need it real bad.

02:24:54.914 --> 02:24:56.275
We are running on fumes.

02:24:56.815 --> 02:25:03.860
And if you need to rewatch or you want to share it, please share the links at stream.gigaohm.bio and realize that you can download those videos now.

02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:15.066
audio 480 and 1080 and you can do whatever you want with them including share them, post them, email them around, cut clips.

02:25:15.286 --> 02:25:21.090
Thank you very much everybody for supporting my work and realize that I have a little bit of a funny weekend

02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:49.337
because it's my anniversary and my family is leaving for a couple weeks and so my timing won't be very good until Tuesday and after Tuesday we're gonna work like a Swiss Swiss train schedule here so thank you very much and I'll see you again soon this is a luxury of having spent my life doing what I love the cost of that it sucks

02:25:52.828 --> 02:25:53.948
I'm not blind.

02:25:55.929 --> 02:25:57.850
I'm not numb to the pain.

02:25:57.870 --> 02:26:05.392
I would argue I'm more conscious of it than anybody else, but I'm also more conscious of what that gives me.

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:17.817
And when I'm done with this, that will be what it is and I'll find a way.

02:26:18.737 --> 02:26:20.778
But there's something inside of me propelling

02:26:22.335 --> 02:26:26.498
that I'm not going to give up until the wheels fall off.

02:26:27.759 --> 02:26:28.620
That's what I'm made of.

02:26:30.321 --> 02:26:37.126
And I wish I see all the arguments against it, but I wish I could relate the intangibles to you.

02:26:40.048 --> 02:26:42.650
My guess is that we're all built the same.

02:26:43.871 --> 02:26:47.854
None of us are completely stupid, a little deranged.

02:26:48.134 --> 02:26:49.635
I think a strong argument, I do.

02:26:51.690 --> 02:26:55.793
But ultimately, we also know what we have.

02:26:57.655 --> 02:27:08.104
And to go and lay down in that sense of it, that's like embracing what we've done with our lives, you know?

02:27:11.909 --> 02:27:13.230
This guy is Rodney Mullen.

02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:20.775
He is a world famous skateboarder, inventor of many, many skateboarding moves, and a longtime supporter of GigaOM Biological.

02:27:20.795 --> 02:27:32.963
And one of the reasons why I'm in front of you today, because without him edifying my belief in myself and my confidence in my ability to figure this out, I might have given up a few years ago already.

02:27:34.043 --> 02:27:39.787
And so I've got a lot to thank Rodney for, the least of which being the financial support that he's provided over the years.

02:27:42.130 --> 02:27:55.856
But more than anything, I just have him as an inspiration because he's somebody who, you know, just did what he felt was right.

02:27:56.536 --> 02:27:59.998
And it's led him in all the places where it needed to go.

02:28:00.438 --> 02:28:02.359
And I'm doing what I think is right.

02:28:02.699 --> 02:28:07.701
And if it wasn't for my wife, Fearla,

02:28:09.207 --> 02:28:11.247
I definitely wouldn't be in front of you right now.

02:28:11.668 --> 02:28:16.229
So I need to go enjoy my anniversary and celebrate it.

02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:21.910
And I will be again here tomorrow because that's what we do.

02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:26.271
I think tomorrow I actually might have an interview with someone if I can schedule it.

02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:26.871
So we'll see.

02:28:26.911 --> 02:28:28.871
It'll probably be after dinner if that happens.

02:28:29.771 --> 02:28:32.172
Thank you very much for joining me and I will see you again tomorrow.
