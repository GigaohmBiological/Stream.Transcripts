00:00.000 --> 00:27.320
left hand monkey wrench number two is definitely first yes you are first 10 oh

00:27.320 --> 00:34.280
five huh darn it I really want to get started earlier because I'm up really

00:34.280 --> 00:41.120
late after these things are done when I start so late Steph with an F Misha

00:41.120 --> 00:51.960
fire fire bike yes Pamela we got a box today thank you very much Fred is

00:51.960 --> 00:57.680
actually really happy with her stuff just to let you know you hit a home

00:57.680 --> 01:03.280
run with a couple of those things this vest with the little sparkly stuff on it

01:03.280 --> 01:08.200
she digs it she digs it I think she might wear it for like weeks in a row

01:08.200 --> 01:13.080
that's how much she likes it she took it out of my hand so fast changed the

01:13.080 --> 01:18.840
shirt underneath and went immediately in she loved it loved it loved it loved it

01:18.840 --> 01:23.520
and it fits perfect she's super excited about it thanks what I want is

01:23.520 --> 01:28.440
high morbidity I want people to complain so what do I do I go to Des Moines

01:28.440 --> 01:31.400
ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen I have nothing against Des Moines

01:31.400 --> 01:34.800
I live there for four years I go to Des Moines I infect a couple of

01:34.800 --> 01:39.840
Sentinel cases in Des Moines I go to Seattle I infect a couple of cases there

01:39.840 --> 01:45.440
I go to North Carolina I go to Wisconsin what I'm doing is I'm using a

01:45.440 --> 01:49.760
dispersion methodology to be able to infect Sentinel cases with a highly

01:49.760 --> 01:53.960
morbid condition these individuals complain again this is a central nervous

01:53.960 --> 01:58.000
system condition so they're complaining of whatever the bug may do it'll produce

01:58.000 --> 02:02.440
some cascade of neurological and neuro psychiatric signs and symptoms and

02:02.440 --> 02:08.600
then what I do the real bug that I use is the internet I take attribution for

02:08.600 --> 02:12.440
that yes I'm a terrorist group and I have done this by infecting with a

02:12.440 --> 02:17.160
highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x y and z

02:17.160 --> 02:21.560
these people are really sick with this but then I say others who are also

02:21.560 --> 02:26.920
infected will show subdramal pre-dramal signs of lethality and what that will

02:26.920 --> 02:33.280
be is anxiety sleeplessness agitation what I've now done is I've got every

02:33.280 --> 02:37.000
individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal and I've got every

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system

02:40.000 --> 02:45.520
is rebel news is rebel news the the organization or the dudes that are

02:45.520 --> 02:48.880
running around in Davos right now I've always been wondering about that guys

02:48.880 --> 02:55.360
he's able to travel definitely got enough money for travel okay I see I

02:55.360 --> 03:00.640
fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its

03:00.640 --> 03:08.160
government it doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until

03:08.160 --> 03:12.440
we invent really important ones you know until we have a pandemic that's

03:12.440 --> 03:17.640
killing everyone you know and you know it's not it's you know measles plus and

03:17.640 --> 03:22.280
okay I can tolerate what you think about measles because you know not that many

03:22.280 --> 03:28.720
people die from it it's just a big hassle in the end but no when when we

03:28.720 --> 03:36.760
have this new pandemic that is you know got 75% mortality and it's not it's

03:37.480 --> 03:41.760
that there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs it

03:41.760 --> 03:46.760
will be a moral emergency because it has to be and this is just sheer

03:46.760 --> 03:54.760
contingency as to whether we're in one condition or another I mean so and I

03:54.760 --> 03:59.920
also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooe who some of you will know from his

03:59.920 --> 04:05.440
lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a bike journal club on a

04:05.480 --> 04:10.200
bike that he also has advanced diversion of this hypothesis so I don't claim it

04:10.200 --> 04:14.920
to be unique I do think I arrived at it independently

04:27.880 --> 04:32.840
if we got rid of infectious disease to the degree that we could we made that

04:32.840 --> 04:36.840
public enemy number one we might simultaneously do be doing the best

04:36.840 --> 04:43.880
possible thing to limit the attractiveness of totalitarian ideology

05:02.840 --> 05:25.240
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a

05:25.240 --> 05:29.040
worst case scenario I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing

05:29.040 --> 05:34.160
with essentially a worst case scenario I'm afraid I should also point out that

05:34.160 --> 05:38.920
our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked and I should

05:38.920 --> 05:42.760
point out that actually we are in an interesting sense a model of something

05:42.760 --> 05:49.080
that I believe is not on the public radar so if I'm correct you Robert have had

05:49.080 --> 05:54.240
COVID I've had COVID and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna all right Steve

05:54.240 --> 05:59.480
you have been vaccinated fully vaccinated with Moderna all right I am

05:59.480 --> 06:04.840
unvaccinated but I am on prophylactic Ivermectin and the data actually shocking

06:04.840 --> 06:09.120
as this will be to some people the data suggests that prophylactic Ivermectin is

06:09.120 --> 06:12.680
something like a hundred percent effective at preventing people from

06:12.680 --> 06:17.920
contracting COVID when taken properly so aside from the risk that possibly the

06:17.920 --> 06:22.080
Ivermectin I got wasn't real and I have every reason to think it was it certainly

06:22.120 --> 06:27.560
appears to be the genuine article I believe that what we have here is a

06:27.560 --> 06:31.800
demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity where through three

06:31.800 --> 06:37.560
different routes COVID vaccine and Ivermectin we are protected and you are

06:37.560 --> 06:40.640
that's fair doubly protected so I would just say that for anybody who's

06:40.640 --> 06:44.520
enthusiastic about the vaccines if you're unconvinced by what we have to say

06:44.520 --> 06:48.320
about the hazard of them one thing to consider is that the way to get society

06:48.760 --> 06:52.920
to herd immunity and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction which ought to be

06:52.920 --> 06:57.000
our goal the way to do it is to get people into this category one way or

06:57.000 --> 07:00.800
the other whether that's through prophylaxis whether it's through a vaccine

07:00.800 --> 07:05.320
or whether it's because they've had COVID already when one could argue that

07:05.320 --> 07:13.200
if everybody just took Ivermectin for a month worldwide really independent some

07:13.200 --> 07:18.200
will find the title that I have given this episode perplexing I would ask them

07:18.200 --> 07:23.400
to stick with the episode through the end and I will explain why I titled it as I

07:23.400 --> 07:28.040
did I I really believe that actually we have the capacity at any moment we

07:28.040 --> 07:33.080
decide to utilize it to end the pandemic and that it is it is well

07:33.080 --> 07:38.280
within reach should we choose to see what is in front of us

07:43.640 --> 07:57.280
Mark is on bit you today or yesterday he's got a little break going on here and

07:57.280 --> 08:00.600
the stuff that he does produce is going to be on other channels just be aware of

08:00.600 --> 08:04.360
that we're defining back we've got two strikes on a couple channels on YouTube

08:04.360 --> 08:10.080
right now so he's gonna be he's gonna be on alternative places just so you know

08:10.440 --> 08:13.960
you know anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need

08:13.960 --> 08:18.480
shots within a year you know Canada saying nine months is as actually JJ

08:18.480 --> 08:22.800
Coe's insistence and I think he's right on calling them

08:22.800 --> 08:27.080
transfections rather than the vaccines

08:28.480 --> 08:36.320
he's scheduled for 16 minutes next he's going on French British Italian Japanese

08:36.320 --> 08:44.680
television people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing

10:06.320 --> 10:32.880
excuse me hello cough into the mic to start out the show always a really good

10:32.880 --> 10:39.520
idea to cough into the mic to start the show they don't want us to be able to see

10:39.520 --> 10:44.440
any more ladies and gentlemen you gotta learn your history

11:02.880 --> 11:04.880
you don't understand

11:32.880 --> 11:54.560
any time I ever see anyone talking about goggles I always think of this one

11:54.560 --> 12:00.320
Simpson's episode where a dude is in a movie and he's supposed to be this

12:00.320 --> 12:06.880
superhero guy and then they dump some acid on him and he's like the low rent Arnold

12:06.880 --> 12:13.840
Schwarzenegger in in Simpsons and he says the goggles they do nothing and I don't

12:13.840 --> 12:18.080
know why but at the time when that episode came out I lost my breath for

12:18.080 --> 12:23.840
hours I thought it was so funny anyway patch climb physiology giga home seals

12:23.840 --> 12:27.320
giga home biological that's where the name comes from

12:27.320 --> 12:32.200
giga home biological dot com is where you can find me and also at giga home dot bio

12:33.000 --> 12:39.240
bit of a chat thing you can also find my confession at that Scooby-Doo link you can

12:39.240 --> 12:47.160
find a one-time support link there a link for the brief scroll down for a schedule for a phone

12:47.160 --> 12:53.880
number where you can leave a voicemail sometimes I pick up and you can also subscribe which would

12:53.960 --> 13:00.520
be really great because I think that's the way we become an unstoppable information source on the

13:00.520 --> 13:07.160
internet I thought I had it worked out a couple different times in the last three years the last

13:07.160 --> 13:16.920
one I thought I was almost a dream job and it all came to a pretty abrupt halt and so now thanks

13:16.920 --> 13:23.000
to these people I am fighting for the possibility of becoming a semi-permanent

13:23.000 --> 13:28.600
independent news source on the internet a science news source I know there are many

13:30.040 --> 13:37.640
but not so many take the time to do the things that we do here at giga home biological which is

13:37.720 --> 13:49.560
really try to try to get beyond the veil and so yeah we we got a lot of work to do I do think

13:49.560 --> 13:54.840
and we might have some time to do it I think they're going to draw this out quite long

13:55.640 --> 14:01.960
I never dreamed did you ever dream would be starting our fifth year of the pandemic

14:01.960 --> 14:08.040
did you ever dream we would be just starting the fifth year of the pandemic and still

14:08.040 --> 14:13.800
basically the rhetoric hasn't really moved beyond a faith in a novel virus that people are still

14:13.800 --> 14:20.120
insisting I find it quite extraordinary but you know I wasn't it took me a long time

14:21.000 --> 14:29.240
it took me until 2022 to really wake up to it and 2023 to really really wake up to it

14:30.200 --> 14:32.040
so that the trap was deep

14:34.600 --> 14:40.040
and yeah I think we're starting to get to the point where the ideas that we're trying to peddle

14:40.600 --> 14:46.600
our ideas that can clear the noise a little bit so that's what I'm most excited about

14:46.600 --> 14:53.160
here at at this little workbench of mine it's the 18th of january 2024 thanks for joining me

14:54.120 --> 15:00.840
uh this is the faith we are trying to dispel this idea that novel virus killed millions of people

15:00.840 --> 15:06.040
that millions more were saved from and that gain of function is real and therefore a virus

15:06.040 --> 15:12.360
will come again we're trying to spread the news that there's really no evidence of a spreading

15:12.360 --> 15:18.760
risk additive pathogen in new york city infectious clones really need to be understood by everyone

15:18.840 --> 15:24.760
especially young people young adults the idea of placebo batches and how useful they would be

15:24.760 --> 15:30.280
also needs to be understood by those same young adults and they also need to understand how every

15:30.280 --> 15:35.160
one of their biology professors should have done known better about transfection they need to

15:35.160 --> 15:40.680
understand that the news and social media hid that the protocols were murdered they hid that

15:40.680 --> 15:46.040
gain of function is a mythology they participated in so much better story to sell including the

15:46.040 --> 15:52.120
solving of the mystery they were sucked in just like us because of the spectacular commitment

15:52.120 --> 16:01.240
to lies it's a national security priority ladies and gentlemen national security priorities

16:02.120 --> 16:04.120
return to our colony

16:09.560 --> 16:15.080
i don't know if this when this becomes there's something here that becomes like

16:17.480 --> 16:26.600
it becomes funky um and for some reason they don't like me to use it so i'm gonna cut over here quick

16:27.240 --> 16:31.880
good evening ladies and gentlemen this is giggle biological high resistance low noise

16:31.880 --> 16:37.400
information brief brought to you by a biologist i am coming to you from the back of my garage

16:37.400 --> 16:45.160
in pittsburgh pennsylvania it's 10 22 in the evening here um it sounds and it can look as though i'm

16:45.160 --> 16:51.800
coming to you from a starship enterprise somewhere in an alternative dimension however tonight that

16:51.880 --> 16:59.560
is not the case tonight it is just a normal news brief information brief um i'm gonna escape as

16:59.560 --> 17:04.840
usual out of this slide deck and then i'm gonna bring up the one for this evening this one for

17:04.840 --> 17:13.080
this evening is actually quite abbreviated um because i'm gonna use mostly just raw video from

17:13.080 --> 17:19.720
the internet so just a few links um and then i'll go back to uh where i think we should be in the

17:19.720 --> 17:26.680
regular deck um i haven't released the lit latest deck yet and i apologize i'm still trying to

17:26.680 --> 17:38.040
sort out the um the sort of routine of how we're gonna get um everybody in in motion here uh

17:38.040 --> 17:45.000
actually my wife uh is starting to help with contacting and and communicating with the subscribers

17:45.000 --> 17:51.960
which is a huge forward move um because i just have not really been very good

17:52.520 --> 17:57.800
about communicating with my subscribers and telling them we know what the plan is as far as pdfs and

17:58.440 --> 18:03.080
and and and news briefs and and slide decks and this kind of thing and so

18:04.120 --> 18:08.520
i've been doing a little bit of the misleading of the young myself but over the next few days

18:08.520 --> 18:13.160
and weekend um i think we're gonna figure it out tomorrow's friday we were supposed to have

18:13.720 --> 18:17.960
a nice basketball practice tomorrow night and late and that was going to screw up the whole

18:17.960 --> 18:24.120
schedule but somehow or another with less than an inch of snow on the ground they've decided

18:24.120 --> 18:30.200
that tomorrow's already a snow day and they're going to have a flexible instruction day at home

18:30.760 --> 18:36.120
um so my wife and i are left with our three kids hopefully there will be enough snow so

18:36.120 --> 18:42.760
that they have sufficient time outside um and if not uh i'm gonna try and find a window during

18:42.760 --> 18:49.720
the day to stream however i would like you to be aware of the fact that i will also stream

18:49.720 --> 18:57.160
around 11 30 in the morning tomorrow um eastern standard time 11 30 tomorrow i'm actually doing

18:57.160 --> 19:05.320
an interview with wolf gang woda which i'm very very very excited about um and so that's going to

19:05.320 --> 19:11.000
be um an interesting experience for me and we're going to talk about this disease x and so

19:11.800 --> 19:18.280
since that already kind of came up i thought i would just just veer off a little bit

19:19.000 --> 19:23.240
and and cover a couple things that i wasn't really planning on covering so if this is a

19:23.240 --> 19:29.800
little awkward or a little choppy it's because i just threw all this together in my head

19:30.360 --> 19:35.400
that i should instead try to do this and maybe watch a couple of these discussions to see where the

19:35.960 --> 19:42.120
where the hype is going so that i'm ready for to meet um uh wolf gang tomorrow which is is

19:42.120 --> 19:49.640
seriously like i don't i don't have very many people on a list of people that i'd really like to

19:49.640 --> 19:58.440
meet but secret bhakti is one um i've already got my bucket list guy mike eden on the end of the

19:58.440 --> 20:04.600
email chain and so i really am happy about that but wolf gang is one of these guys who was on the

20:04.600 --> 20:10.680
ball about this in 2009 so he's gone up against this

20:13.000 --> 20:18.360
a smaller version of this scheme he's gone up against it when nobody cared nobody really paid

20:18.360 --> 20:26.360
attention and only 1200 people got hurt in germany or so so it was a very smaller scale thing that

20:26.360 --> 20:32.360
he put his whole career on the line for and because he was fighting against a much bigger monster that

20:32.440 --> 20:40.760
hadn't barely even moved a paw to do the 2009 pandemic now this monster is much bigger

20:41.880 --> 20:47.880
fully awake uh and and around the globe and so it's a much different beast to

20:49.480 --> 20:57.320
oppose for all of us but also on the flip side it just it was much harder for him to gain

20:57.320 --> 21:03.640
traction on a global scale because the pandemic was much more from the perspective of individual

21:03.640 --> 21:07.800
countries it was much more isolated so what happened in germany i guess is what i'm trying to say

21:08.360 --> 21:13.400
what happened in germany was pretty isolated to germany and it didn't spread very far in the

21:13.400 --> 21:19.880
in the consciousness of the populace even throughout the EU is relatively well contained

21:21.240 --> 21:26.840
and so that's an interesting flip here um that i'm very excited about meeting that guy he's

21:26.920 --> 21:32.040
one of my pandemic heroes for sure so we've got to stop misleading the young

21:33.000 --> 21:39.880
we've got to be aware that there is a conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits

21:40.600 --> 21:47.160
and opinions and if we're not aware of this we will be vulnerable to it in a way that otherwise

21:47.160 --> 21:56.280
maybe we could i don't know not necessarily push back on but not be so not be so vulnerable to

21:56.840 --> 22:04.280
and eventually free of and so i think they fooled us into solving a mystery they made us feel like

22:04.280 --> 22:10.760
we were a bunch of teenagers solving a mystery with our dog and as we unmasked the bad guys

22:10.760 --> 22:17.080
they confessed to us their roles in this in this heist in this pandemic narrative

22:18.840 --> 22:25.880
and we've been trying to build kind of a 30 000 foot understanding of how the pandemic was

22:25.880 --> 22:30.280
orchestrated it had a lot to do with seeding the gain of function narrative in the primary

22:30.280 --> 22:40.600
literature for at least a couple decades um and this is literature about RNA viruses and and how

22:40.600 --> 22:48.520
they're studied how they're purified how they're isolated how they're cultured etc and what kind

22:48.520 --> 22:53.720
of potential these measurements represent then at the same time in parallel over these last couple

22:53.720 --> 22:59.640
decades there have been regular high-level exercises in secret rooms with lanyards and badges

23:00.360 --> 23:08.040
and and fancy meals and even plushies where they go over all these dangers of bioterrorism and

23:09.000 --> 23:15.400
it has moved or let's say evolved into this thing where they're primarily now focused on viruses and

23:15.400 --> 23:23.240
that's mostly RNA viruses so at the beginning of the pandemic it was very important for them to

23:23.240 --> 23:31.160
seed into the narrative some of the likely or expected outcomes of the countermeasures and so

23:31.720 --> 23:40.120
it is possible that they seeded kidney failure into the early covid narrative in order to make

23:40.120 --> 23:45.560
sure that when they rolled out remdesivir that could be confounded with with the virus and

23:46.280 --> 23:51.320
and not blamed on remdesivir it's also possible that they did the same thing for the transfection

23:51.880 --> 23:59.400
in the sense of if they knew that transfection had a high rate of causing stroke and blood clots

23:59.400 --> 24:04.520
then they might say well then we're going to seed that in the narrative at the beginning of the

24:04.520 --> 24:10.120
pandemic so that people know that that symptomology or associate that symptomology with the virus

24:10.680 --> 24:18.120
and so then we can tie in this spike protein and it's this link between the transfection and the virus

24:18.120 --> 24:22.440
that will allow us to throw up our hands and say hey it was an emergency we did our best we chose

24:22.440 --> 24:26.120
the wrong protein or we chose a protein that had too many things we didn't understand

24:26.680 --> 24:31.640
the next time it's going to be better at least we got it started at least we tried it and proved

24:31.640 --> 24:36.760
that it's almost perfect already like wow that's pretty serendipitous that's the whole

24:37.400 --> 24:44.040
point of having this worst case scenario team so that you you constantly believe that in the end

24:44.040 --> 24:47.800
what you're really talking about is are you going to step in front of a train and let it run

24:47.800 --> 24:52.040
you over are you going to step off the tracks for a minute wait for the train to go by and then

24:52.600 --> 24:57.080
step back on the tracks again and they want you to make you think that it's a very easy choice

25:00.040 --> 25:06.440
that this whole idea of well i mean that we don't have any idea of what's going on here we don't

25:06.440 --> 25:10.680
know the properties of this virus but we do know that there is a potential that this could be

25:11.320 --> 25:17.560
much worse than any other type of crisis worse than a nuclear weapon

25:18.600 --> 25:26.760
Sam Harris 2019 December 19th on Brett Weinstein's eighth podcast was talking about a virus

25:26.760 --> 25:30.680
spreading around the world with 75 mortality

25:32.920 --> 25:39.080
so there's no way you can convince me that the worst case scenario hasn't been drilled into us

25:39.080 --> 25:42.520
over and over over at least the last 10 years

25:44.760 --> 25:50.040
in the beginning of movies and the end of movies and the themes of movies and the themes of tv shows

25:51.240 --> 25:58.840
in rap songs everything and at the start of the pandemic they put people in place all over this

26:00.040 --> 26:05.240
socioeconomic map to make sure that no matter where you turned or where you searched you would

26:05.240 --> 26:12.280
find somebody more likely than not that wouldn't question this basic idea that the worst case

26:12.280 --> 26:17.560
scenario is a disaster and so we better take this frickin seriously

26:20.600 --> 26:25.720
and the reason why some of these people a lot of these people are so committed to this narrative

26:25.720 --> 26:32.360
is because they were recruited as part of a national security exercise a national security

26:32.360 --> 26:41.240
operation if you will and to the extent to which they are receiving comfort or artificial algorithmic

26:43.000 --> 26:49.800
amplification it's all part of the same operation it's an imperative that people

26:49.800 --> 26:56.680
complied and so in order to get that compliance part of that operation included

26:57.640 --> 27:01.960
operators that were seeding this worst case scenario narrative to make sure that there was

27:01.960 --> 27:06.200
enough fear to motivate people to follow the directive and take the countermeasures

27:07.640 --> 27:13.320
and when they did that the toxicity of those countermeasures be it remdesivir or be it

27:13.320 --> 27:20.440
transfection would be naturally confounded with the properties of the disease because of the way

27:20.520 --> 27:27.400
the narrative in the first year was told because of the way in which the limited spectrum of debate

27:27.400 --> 27:32.920
about the properties of the virus was controlled by the same people who would then control the

27:32.920 --> 27:41.560
narrative about the transfection and lead us all by the hand especially those people without

27:41.640 --> 27:47.480
biological backgrounds through this you know maze of confusion

27:50.040 --> 27:54.760
early but i want his high morbidity i want people to complain and so that's why we play this guy

27:54.760 --> 28:01.240
all the time because his lecture about how this would be done and his emphasis on the fact that

28:01.240 --> 28:08.200
you would only need to create the illusion of spread with complaining people in a few places

28:09.080 --> 28:15.880
and then use the internet to confound that signal with spread and now we have people like Jessica

28:15.880 --> 28:26.040
Hockett and Jonathan Engler and Martin Neil and quite a few other people now Denny Rancour

28:26.760 --> 28:33.400
who have put together observation sets data sets which indicate that these mass casualty events

28:33.480 --> 28:40.520
while they existed did not have spread geographically from them and that is a highly

28:40.520 --> 28:47.240
suspect observation which correlates well with the idea of what Dr. Giordano says in this video

28:47.240 --> 28:56.120
which is that there is a way to use a pathogen or a toxin a toxin is what he's talking about in

28:56.120 --> 29:03.800
this that is a highly morbid condition so that people complain and then the rest of the time

29:03.800 --> 29:10.520
you say that there are other asymptomatic spreaders and so you've got to be aware that you can

29:10.520 --> 29:16.200
asymptomatically spread this virus and at the same time you could also develop a very severe

29:16.200 --> 29:19.480
disease it's all a very random thing that we don't understand

29:20.200 --> 29:35.880
and so this don't understand this random thing I'm going to switch this to this this yes is

29:37.640 --> 29:43.080
they have orchestrated this with winning and unwitting actors

29:44.520 --> 29:48.440
and it's a question of how many actors do you really need I one of the things I would really

29:48.440 --> 29:55.480
like you to consider is like the corporate tug-of-war let's say that we had 20 people from the

29:55.480 --> 30:02.360
neuroscience department at Pitt and 20 people from the biochemistry department at Pitt

30:02.360 --> 30:06.200
and we lined them up on a pretty fair field with a pretty thick and long rope

30:07.320 --> 30:14.920
and we set them up for a tug-of-war 20 versus 20 how many of these people would be needed

30:15.560 --> 30:24.920
to recruited and sabotage their team before you could guarantee the results and more importantly

30:24.920 --> 30:30.280
how easy would it be for one or two of those people to sabotage their team to lead into the

30:30.280 --> 30:36.680
rope but not really pull to get into the position and struggle and make the noise and squint but

30:36.680 --> 30:44.200
not really pull and so the question really becomes how many of these people are necessary to be

30:44.200 --> 30:49.000
co-opted into this national security operation in order for the rest of the people to just keep

30:49.000 --> 30:58.200
pulling anyway to keep pulling on these same ideas to keep pulling on these these these same

30:58.200 --> 31:05.000
arguments and ignoring all the other ones ignoring the protocols ignoring the changes that we made

31:05.000 --> 31:13.720
to our to our daily lives which have cost hundreds of hours of pain and suffering and deaths to the

31:13.800 --> 31:20.760
thousands and that's what this is really all about is not it's not saying that any one of these

31:20.760 --> 31:25.560
people is bad and in reality right we can have most of the people in the tug-of-war actually

31:25.560 --> 31:32.280
try in their best but because of the nature of this exercise because of the nature of this

31:32.280 --> 31:39.720
operation you got to find your space on the rope we were made to feel like you got to find your

31:39.720 --> 31:45.720
space on the rope these people were made to feel like they had to find their space on the rope

31:46.920 --> 31:55.320
and they did and they pulled together but not everybody was pulling and that's the trick

31:56.360 --> 32:02.920
that's how they got us to buy into this public leak lab leak cover-up happening yada yada

32:03.720 --> 32:12.680
is because they ignored these increases these sources of all cause mortality increase they were

32:12.680 --> 32:21.720
ignored and confounded with this spreading pathogen which was never spreading but we couldn't know

32:21.720 --> 32:25.640
that because the data wasn't available we couldn't know that because the numbers weren't available

32:25.640 --> 32:29.720
we couldn't know that because there wasn't testing and the testing was all being done by the CDC

32:30.360 --> 32:36.440
this illusion of a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from

32:36.440 --> 32:45.480
could have been saved from it came from gain of function this is all what we have to break our

32:45.480 --> 32:57.240
children free from and so it's crazy to think that after all this work on this you know gain of

32:57.320 --> 33:03.880
function and worst case scenario idea that we actually have a story that has just come out this

33:03.880 --> 33:13.320
week about a virus that can kill a hundred percent of the mice and infects the brain and is scary

33:13.320 --> 33:20.520
and deadly and frightening and so i just wanted to address this because this is kind of disease

33:20.520 --> 33:25.720
x this is kind of the the story that i suspect one of the things that wolf gang wodock might

33:25.720 --> 33:32.040
ask me about tomorrow and so i thought i'd take a look at this first so this is the paper

33:33.080 --> 33:39.400
lethal infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice caused by sarscov2 related pangolin coronavirus

33:39.400 --> 33:49.080
gx p2v short three prime untranslated region um so i'm gonna do my best here but you have to

33:49.080 --> 33:54.920
understand that there are several papers with a longer version of this virus that precede it

33:56.280 --> 34:03.720
and those four papers i've read but it doesn't really paint a coherent picture of what these

34:03.720 --> 34:11.080
people think these viruses are because again these are RNAs which have been identified in the wild

34:12.120 --> 34:18.360
by a combination of PCR fishing and then metagenomic sequencing on the whole sample

34:19.000 --> 34:27.160
and then sort of best guessing on what coronavirus consensus sequence is represented therein

34:28.520 --> 34:39.400
and so these are pretty complicated alchemical analyses which take a relatively faint RNA signal

34:41.240 --> 34:47.800
and then amplify the background in such a way so that they can make a statistical argument that

34:47.800 --> 34:55.720
there exists a pure signal called a coronavirus and of course this is the stuff that the no-virus

34:55.720 --> 35:03.000
people have been harping on for three years now four years now that this idea of how they isolate

35:03.000 --> 35:11.080
and and propagate viruses is very very strange and so let's just try to read this this abstract

35:11.080 --> 35:16.040
and this this paper together and see how far we can get and see if we can figure out what's going on

35:16.120 --> 35:21.800
here and i'm just going to turn off this scroll at the top so i can see where we are here

35:22.600 --> 35:30.840
so first of all let it be known that the chd defender did an article on the 18th is that today

35:30.840 --> 35:35.960
yesterday written by john michael demise and he's a nice guy

35:38.840 --> 35:44.680
and this article is extraordinary because they quote almost everybody in the whole world i don't

35:44.680 --> 35:52.120
know how they got so many quotes um chinese scientists have created a mutated pangolin coronavirus

35:52.120 --> 35:56.840
that is a hundred percent lethal and humanized mice raising biosafety concerns around

35:57.480 --> 36:04.840
risky gain of function research hmm let's see now keep in mind that i i used to work

36:05.160 --> 36:13.480
um with chd uh for chd as a staff scientist and i used to work as a defender

36:15.560 --> 36:19.880
consultant or advisor or you know whatever i was the the guy that helped the defender a

36:19.880 --> 36:25.000
little bit so i would have probably been able to help with this article had i still been um

36:25.000 --> 36:33.080
working for uh chd this week so let me just read it quick here so let's go back again right chinese

36:33.080 --> 36:36.600
scientists have created a mutated pangolin virus okay so let's see

36:37.960 --> 36:44.360
SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin coronavirus gx p2v can cause a hundred percent mortality in

36:45.160 --> 36:50.280
human ace-2 transgenic mice potentially attributable to late-stage brain infection

36:50.920 --> 36:57.240
this underscores a spillover risk of this into humans and provides a unique model for understanding

36:57.320 --> 37:03.960
pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses so let's see what we've got here this is

37:03.960 --> 37:08.680
going to be a little bit of a mess to get through first of all it doesn't look like they created

37:08.680 --> 37:15.640
the virus if you read the other four papers what you find is that the original pangolin virus that

37:15.640 --> 37:22.040
that doesn't have this short does is not miss is not and miss having this deletion which creates

37:22.040 --> 37:27.800
the short um three prime utr which i believe what this this designates um

37:29.640 --> 37:35.960
these virus so here it's it's here we previously we previously this is where you get it we previously

37:35.960 --> 37:43.240
reported that the early passage gx pv2 isolate was actually a cell culture adapted mutant

37:44.200 --> 37:52.840
which possessed 104 nucleotide deletion at the three prime untranslated region so

37:54.200 --> 37:57.240
they passaged a clone

37:59.800 --> 38:04.600
and of an isolate so this infectivity have been studied the isolate which was higher

38:04.600 --> 38:10.200
homology can infect and i believe that these studies these first four studies were all done

38:10.280 --> 38:18.120
by cloning that pangolin isolate and they don't explicitly say it but i assume

38:19.320 --> 38:24.680
and maybe i'm making an ass of you and me by assuming that but it sure does feel as though

38:24.680 --> 38:31.080
they're using the term very loosely to say it without saying that they are making a DNA construct

38:31.080 --> 38:36.600
and then generating the cloned RNA from it and they're starting from that cloned RNA which represents

38:37.560 --> 38:42.520
this virus that they're going to transfect into these cells and again you can tell if they're

38:42.520 --> 38:47.640
doing that because they have to start with a cell culture they need to transfect something

38:47.640 --> 38:54.600
before they can before they can do the virus thing so let's see if if we can find any trace

38:54.600 --> 39:04.440
of that okay so this gdo one isolate uh can infect golden hamsters and ace two mice in contrast

39:04.440 --> 39:09.000
can also affect both species it doesn't appear to be obvious cause obvious disease

39:09.640 --> 39:15.160
we previous those so that's the full-sized virus that doesn't seem to cause obvious disease in

39:15.160 --> 39:23.880
those animals so they previously reported that the early passaged isolate was actually a cell

39:23.880 --> 39:29.720
culture adapted mutant named so i'm not really sure if this language isn't perfect but it's a

39:29.720 --> 39:36.120
mutant with a uh a deletion and the deletion after they cloned it this we cloned this mutant

39:36.840 --> 39:43.160
considering the propensity of coronaviruses to undergo rapid adaptive mutation in culture so

39:43.160 --> 39:49.640
this really does say that because coronaviruses and you could also just read that because

39:50.440 --> 39:57.560
self-replicating RNA let's just call it a little bit more specific word that means something to

39:57.560 --> 40:01.720
all of us at the same time self-replicating RNA molecules

40:04.360 --> 40:10.520
they cloned it and why did they clone it because of the propensity of self-replicating RNA to

40:10.520 --> 40:17.640
undergo rapid adaptive mutation in cell culture rapid adaptive mutation being characterized by

40:17.640 --> 40:25.400
hundreds of thousands of subgenomic RNAs translated for every long RNA that gets most of the genome

40:26.360 --> 40:32.680
hundreds of thousands and then the one that gets the long genome will still have errors and still

40:32.680 --> 40:39.640
will likely not be a full genome but that's how they again they're writing this to the editor so

40:39.640 --> 40:49.000
this is how they they write it so we found that this short version gx version clone clone

40:49.160 --> 40:57.160
can infect human ACE2 mice with high viral loads detected in both lung and brain tissue

40:57.720 --> 41:02.040
high viral loads remember that so we're going to look at how the high viral loads are defined

41:02.600 --> 41:07.560
this infection resulted in a hundred percent mortality in human ACE2 mice we surmise that the

41:07.560 --> 41:12.120
death cause of death may be linked to the occurrence of late brain infection

41:12.520 --> 41:24.040
now this is important this right here the human ACE2 mouse model expressing human ACE2

41:24.840 --> 41:33.320
under the control of the CAG promoter the CAG promoter

41:34.200 --> 41:40.040
was developed using random integration technology by Beijing

41:40.600 --> 41:43.640
spefarm biotechnology company

41:45.640 --> 41:53.400
now if i'm not mistaken this might mean that the whole point of this is to sell the mouse model

42:04.200 --> 42:11.320
anyway the point is is that this is a promoter that is very a specific okay that means that

42:11.320 --> 42:19.480
wherever it integrated it's going to express a lot of ACE2 so now the first question becomes is

42:19.480 --> 42:26.680
are it is the physiological expression profile of human ACE2 equivalent to that

42:27.560 --> 42:36.360
of where the mouse ACE2 would be in a healthy mouse and if that so does that result in a healthy

42:36.360 --> 42:45.000
mouse on the other hand have they added human ACE2 to a mouse with mouse ACE2 or is it a knockout

42:45.000 --> 42:52.520
mouse you see i guess it must be a knockout mouse we're just going to assume the best that they

42:52.600 --> 42:59.640
knocked out the ACE2 in the mouse and then they put in a human ACE2 under the CAG promoter which

42:59.640 --> 43:04.120
is a very hot promoter it's going to it's going to express wherever it is it's going to express

43:04.120 --> 43:13.320
a lot of human ACE2 which means that if these are exosomes with a a human ACE2 protein agonist on

43:13.320 --> 43:19.320
the outside then if there really is some kind of fusion mechanism then there's going to be a

43:19.320 --> 43:26.440
lot of fusion happening with these exosomes if they put them into a mouse that is over expressing

43:26.440 --> 43:33.400
this protein so that's interesting in order to obtain a genetically homogenous clone for animal

43:33.400 --> 43:37.960
experiments we clone the passage mutant through two successive plaque assays what

43:39.160 --> 43:46.680
shoot that doesn't make any sense to me and i'm you know i'm not a virologist so it may

43:46.840 --> 43:53.080
make sense to a virologist to obtain a genetically homogenous clone for animal experiments we cloned

43:54.520 --> 44:01.160
to obtain a genetically homogenous clone which is a noun for animal experiments we cloned

44:01.800 --> 44:08.520
which is a verb the passage mutant through two successive plaque assays plaque assays being this

44:08.600 --> 44:18.680
thing where they where it's like a double layer of agar that prevents the virus from going anywhere

44:18.680 --> 44:24.360
and so then you put the virus at a very low concentration and then you get separate virus

44:27.080 --> 44:32.760
mutants replicating that you can then select from these plaques and then you get i guess a lot of

44:32.760 --> 44:40.120
subgenomic RNA because the cells are dying from so it's strange i don't know what you would get

44:40.120 --> 44:45.960
if you did that and then you i guess you would take that plaque assay and you do another plaque

44:45.960 --> 44:52.120
assay and so then that would be very pure and then at that stage these clones when compared to the

44:52.120 --> 44:59.800
genome of the original mutant all four shared identical mutations and then this one c7 was

44:59.800 --> 45:05.640
randomly selected for evaluation for viral pathogenicity that's weird that they selected that

45:05.640 --> 45:14.040
randomly initially we assessed whether c7 could cause disease in human ACE2 mice by monitoring

45:14.040 --> 45:21.320
daily weight they put five times five ten to the fifth plaque forming units of virus

45:22.200 --> 45:31.320
and i don't really know how that translates to plaque forming units per milligram because

45:31.320 --> 45:41.320
again in the figure that's what you see you see copies per milligram see log base 10

45:43.400 --> 45:47.640
copies per milligram log base 10 copies per milligram

45:48.600 --> 45:55.960
and they called that high remember they called that high concentration these are the these

45:55.960 --> 46:03.800
are the figures we're looking at here and so this would be the this is networking

46:05.880 --> 46:12.840
this would be um hold on one second i'll get that there we go there we go

46:13.480 --> 46:19.560
yeah so this says brain i'm sorry you can't read this maybe i should get a pdf out here

46:21.960 --> 46:24.120
i did already didn't i oh yeah no here we go

46:25.960 --> 46:30.760
see if i can get a good a better picture for you is that working

46:33.320 --> 46:37.160
yeah it's a little better okay so these are the mice that are dying

46:38.120 --> 46:43.240
remember that they put five times ten to the fifth plaque forming units into their menos

46:44.600 --> 46:54.040
and what is this three days post six days post and this is viral and oh it's n protein copies per

46:55.560 --> 46:56.360
milligram

46:58.520 --> 46:59.320
hmm

47:01.720 --> 47:06.040
remember that the n protein will be one of those sub genomic RNAs that's

47:06.120 --> 47:11.800
copied hundreds of thousands of times more than full genome so even if

47:14.200 --> 47:21.560
even if you think about transfecting the mouse in the nose it's pretty easy to imagine how the

47:21.560 --> 47:30.600
subgenomic RNAs of but it could be i guess that's not RNA though i guess they're looking for protein

47:30.600 --> 47:38.920
i would have to look at the figure legend de quantification of n gene copies

47:41.960 --> 47:48.760
n gene i think is is i think n gene is sub genomic RNA so there you go that's the that's the

47:49.960 --> 47:57.560
that's the rub if you remember from our model of of the infectious cycle

47:58.040 --> 48:04.440
when we look at nanopore sequencing papers and when we look at old-school RNA

48:05.400 --> 48:11.880
gel papers where they separate the total RNA fractions out it's a very very very tiny

48:11.880 --> 48:15.960
almost undetectable fraction that is large enough to be considered a full genome

48:17.160 --> 48:21.560
and with nanopore sequencing we they haven't been able to find a very large fraction at all it's

48:21.560 --> 48:31.400
tiny minuscule ridiculously small just like the old papers seem to suggest so in this case

48:31.400 --> 48:37.480
when they look for n gene copies what they're looking for because they're going to use a reverse

48:37.480 --> 48:43.240
transcriptase to find it first they're looking for those sub genomic RNAs of the n protein which

48:43.240 --> 48:48.760
is one of the most abundant if not the most abundant protein produced let's

48:49.400 --> 48:56.840
let's look at that because i don't know what what that looks like anymore i don't remember

48:58.440 --> 49:03.160
what that looks like okay i'm not going to do that now because that'll take too long but

49:03.160 --> 49:07.560
i want to watch these other things so here here's where i think we've already figured out okay so

49:07.560 --> 49:13.160
let me just summarize it again i know that it's just broken up i know this is lame but i wanted

49:13.160 --> 49:16.520
to go through this so it's kind of like a study all because i wanted to go through this before i

49:16.520 --> 49:24.520
talked to wolf gang tomorrow so what it seems they're doing here is they're looking for

49:25.480 --> 49:31.400
viral n copies per milligram so they're doing some kind of sample from these different tissues

49:31.400 --> 49:39.320
and they're looking for a signal that indicates n gene copies now if you remember very carefully

49:40.120 --> 49:46.360
remember back to when we when we have looked at the total RNA in a cell culture looked at the

49:46.360 --> 49:54.360
total RNA in a closed-transfection infection system where there's cytopathic effects or this

49:54.360 --> 50:00.840
kind of thing and we've looked for full genomes we don't find them but what we do find are hundreds

50:00.840 --> 50:08.040
of thousands of times as many copies of the sub genomic RNAs the smaller shorter versions of the

50:08.040 --> 50:16.040
whole genome and the vast giant majority i believe are n and s protein is also quite highly

50:16.040 --> 50:20.840
produced the e protein is also quite highly produced the m protein is also high quietly

50:20.840 --> 50:28.440
but i think the n is the most abundant small sub genomic RNA in a viral infection or a viral

50:28.440 --> 50:34.040
transfection with these sub with these self-replicating RNA so this is interesting because

50:34.600 --> 50:40.280
what that means is is that if you through all of these self-replicating RNAs into the mouth

50:40.280 --> 50:46.680
the nose of the animal and they started to do their thing like they've done in other contexts

50:47.240 --> 50:54.440
they're going to make a preponderance of n protein sub genomic RNAs and other sub genomic RNAs

50:54.440 --> 50:59.480
there's going to be thousands and thousands of times as many of those as there will be of this

50:59.480 --> 51:06.440
full genome so that's why they look for that because that RNA is also likely to spread elsewhere

51:09.320 --> 51:16.760
and so if something does happen with this huge load of self-replicating cloned RNA

51:16.760 --> 51:22.120
being put into the animal's nasal passages it's possible that the most abundant sub genomic

51:22.120 --> 51:27.560
form of that RNA is we're using their terms when we call it sub genomic RNA but

51:27.640 --> 51:33.720
it is a it is a tiny form of this whole they i don't even know if they really understand it

51:35.000 --> 51:40.120
but what they're fooling around with is a self-replicating RNA and the patterns of RNA that are

51:40.120 --> 51:47.560
produced by that self-replicating RNA and i i get that it's showing up in the lungs i get that

51:47.560 --> 51:54.360
it's showing up in the eye where there's there's there's there's passage from the nose to the eye

51:54.440 --> 51:58.760
we know that already like lacrimal ducts and and and whatever other tubes are in there

52:01.320 --> 52:07.880
and so it's not unusual that it would also get to the brain because again of the intense connection

52:09.080 --> 52:18.600
between the the olfactory system and the brain and it's the fact it's the only sensory system that

52:18.600 --> 52:25.000
has a direct line in and doesn't need to go through the thalamus so you've got a lot of

52:25.640 --> 52:36.840
potential here for for explanations for how this n protein RNA gets up in the brain that doesn't

52:36.840 --> 52:41.800
necessarily indicate that it's that's the reason those animals are dying the animals are dying

52:41.800 --> 52:50.680
because they were in like an internasally injected with it a metric ton of self-replicating RNA that

52:50.680 --> 52:58.520
was going to make a huge quantity of foreign RNA in their epithelial cells if it works as it says on

52:58.520 --> 53:06.680
the tin so that's pretty extraordinary to me that that this paper is not really as impressive

53:07.320 --> 53:14.360
you know codon changes in the and and what they it's it's impressive to me

53:17.320 --> 53:25.480
because it's not wow I don't know what to tell you anymore guys i'm i'm a little kind of sad by this

53:27.000 --> 53:28.520
because here we have

53:36.680 --> 53:43.800
Marty saying that risky experiments are taking place this infection resulted in 100 mortality

53:43.800 --> 53:49.480
i mean it doesn't mean anything first of all remember that the monkeys that were infected with

53:50.040 --> 53:54.920
SARS-CoV-2 clone also were killed they died i mean they didn't survive it i don't think

53:55.640 --> 53:58.200
they were sacrificed because they wanted to see where it went

53:58.520 --> 54:05.800
so James Thorpe interesting he gets quoted in this one wow

54:07.640 --> 54:11.880
sure appears like a lab created bioepin to me am i missing something do you believe that this

54:11.880 --> 54:17.240
research is being done for the good of humanity what have we have we collectively gone insane

54:21.080 --> 54:23.640
great news everybody oh here that's this one

54:24.440 --> 54:34.520
that's that's that's mr uh that's mr mr narrative for the first two years mr mr narrative for

54:34.520 --> 54:42.200
the first two years he let everybody and their mom take the shot and then some and then some more

54:42.920 --> 54:49.560
before he ever sort of kind of found his oh wow i mean he's as bad as Brett Weinstein

54:50.440 --> 54:58.680
so uh barking mad yada yada Francis Ballyu oh my gosh that was a dude who just had bad

54:58.680 --> 55:07.720
opinions all the time for the first year gosh this guy was awful Richard Ebright why not give

55:07.720 --> 55:14.200
Richard Ebright a say in something in the defender what a great idea the guy who said that there

55:14.280 --> 55:22.840
would be 250 000 college kids dead if we opened up the universities in the fall of 2020

55:23.800 --> 55:26.600
that's what he said that's what he said

55:32.440 --> 55:38.520
wow Richard Ebright i mean he's one of the worst of these kinds of lab leak worst case

55:38.600 --> 55:46.760
team worst case scenario he is he is a government and Rutgers funded team worst case scenario

55:46.760 --> 55:50.440
in its fight he could be a could be the team captain for all i know

55:51.880 --> 55:56.840
ebright ebright ebright i'm surprised that high risk low value research such as the

55:56.840 --> 56:01.560
research in this preprint continues in china today it's nothing they just put some RNA

56:02.440 --> 56:07.560
they just put some RNA in a mouse nose and then they found some parts of that RNA

56:07.560 --> 56:13.480
in the mouse it's not that big a deal it's really not the fact that the amount the mouse

56:13.480 --> 56:18.440
had an immune reaction that resulted in it in it getting so sick that they had to kill it or that

56:18.440 --> 56:27.480
it died is also not that big a deal it's really not not if what they put into them was an RNA that

56:27.480 --> 56:33.880
was at an active transfection investigators claim it's not gain a function it's not

56:34.600 --> 56:40.040
it brian hooker says that it is it's not true the high level of mutation in these RNA viruses

56:40.040 --> 56:46.040
the more experimentation involving the eight infected humanized mice could select for mutations

56:46.040 --> 56:52.200
that interact more robustly with the human ACE2 receptor so what brian is saying and i think

56:52.200 --> 56:59.640
incorrectly is that by putting it into the mice that it was possible that a more dangerous

56:59.720 --> 57:00.840
virus would come out

57:04.040 --> 57:08.840
that's what he's suggesting here which is exactly the illusion that i've been trying to break

57:09.480 --> 57:14.280
it's exactly the illusion that i've been trying to break i don't understand there is no

57:15.160 --> 57:22.840
pandemic potential in bat caves there is no way to passage viruses in a cell culture and get them

57:22.840 --> 57:30.120
to be worse that is what is implied in this paper they say that the original pangolin virus

57:30.120 --> 57:37.880
was passage in cell culture and resulted in a deletion of over a hundred nucleotides and that

57:39.320 --> 57:45.160
virus with that deletion was the one that they put inside of these animals and so

57:46.120 --> 57:52.200
that is the virus that brian is suggesting might actually passage itself into a pandemic

57:52.200 --> 58:01.160
potential virus no no that's exactly the mythology they want us to teach our children

58:02.200 --> 58:08.040
so what in the hell is going on here why are why is there a

58:11.720 --> 58:17.080
why is there a why are there quotes in a chd article saying that this is

58:17.960 --> 58:22.200
this is gain of function research there's no two ways about it like

58:22.920 --> 58:28.280
christina parks a science educator with a degree in cellular molecular biology

58:29.000 --> 58:30.840
this is gain of function research

58:34.200 --> 58:37.000
the epoch times biosafety now

58:37.560 --> 58:46.840
it sounds like every one of these people is on team worst case scenario

58:48.920 --> 58:52.440
didn't anybody listen to me when i said that r&a can't do this

58:54.440 --> 58:57.560
that that's not what's happening they're misrepresenting this

58:59.720 --> 59:04.920
they're misrepresenting this and and people are buying into it all great here's frances boil

59:05.640 --> 59:12.040
he's going to tell us

59:19.240 --> 59:24.680
the wuhan cover up will blow up blow out of the water the international disinformation

59:24.680 --> 59:29.720
campaign bought us and chinese government officials and they're bribed scientists that

59:29.720 --> 59:34.200
covid-19 somehow magically jumped out of the wuhan wet market

59:35.000 --> 59:40.440
kennedy's book will provide the ammunition needed for us lawyers to hold them all

59:40.440 --> 59:43.880
legally accountable for this nuremberg crime against humanity

59:48.680 --> 59:53.160
that's what frances boil said about robert f kennedy's book

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:07.160
however the findings showed largely in absence of major inflammatory responses or tissue damage

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:21.960
exceptionally high genome copies they're not genome copies you see that's already wrong

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.680
they're not genome copies they're copies of the n

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:32.440
r&a you see this is kind of this is kind of frustrating because that is a highly

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.400
immunogenic protein and it's a highly immunogenic protein so if it is there

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.000
and being made in high quantities that would already be enough

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:45.480
i mean

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:54.440
we're confounding viral infection viral replication and successful viral spread

01:00:54.520 --> 01:01:02.600
through the body with an overload of self-replicating r&a and an overload of the proteins that are

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:10.360
encoded by that r&a this is very different than a viral infection in the cartoons and they know it

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:26.520
a proposal here is the proposal what's that proposal is that the is that the my gosh

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.120
here we go

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.440
i don't know what to say ladies and gentlemen this looks pretty scary to me it looks like

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.960
they're really trying to rev it up let's see what alina chan's got to say about it oh my gosh

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.160
alina chan the lady that uh found the that found the the viruses that were

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.080
the the sequence difference and how much it changed in oh my gosh this is amazing

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.200
have we learned nothing from the coronavirus pandemic

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.920
oh come on now

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:09.560
why are you doing me new reporting suggests chinese laboratories just can't help themselves

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.520
according to daily mail chinese scientists have reportedly developed a mutant coronavirus strain

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.800
that attacks the brain and has a 100 percent kill rate in mice worse they admit there's a

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.160
risk it could spill over to humans the virus is a modified version of a strain found in pangolins

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:30.040
and was tested on mice expressing a protein found in humans to test that the disease might

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.080
impact people reportedly all mice infected with the virus died between seven and eight days after

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.760
being infected with symptoms including their eyes turning completely white

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.640
but why would they show this picture right here

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.280
what are they doing if they're showing this picture right here

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.560
oakland school allows covid positive students to 10 class what is this

01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:00.280
do you see what they're doing to our kids do you see what they're doing to our our our

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:08.360
college age kids that watch this show they are brainwashing them they are bamboozling them with

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:17.640
magic spells and this guy listen to him talk what kind of nonsense is this rapid weight loss and

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:25.400
fatigue researchers additionally found significant viral load in the mice's brains lungs noses eyes

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:31.240
and windpipes while the potential for a new pandemic could be rising here at home pandemic

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.240
prevention measures have done a full 180 oakland a new covid policy is allowing even students who

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.920
test positive for the coronavirus to attend the classes as long as the child is asymptomatic they

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:49.080
can go to school but they are encouraged to wear a mask here to discuss the coronavirus and this

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.320
potential new mystery disease out of china is alina chan scientific advisor at the broad

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.600
institute of mit and harvard and co-author of viral the search for the origins of covid-19

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.920
welcome back to rising alina is she really scientific advisor i think she can't be i think

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.480
she's got to be like a scientist or something she can't be an advisor to the whole institute that

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:17.960
would just be absurd she would go from a a postdoc nobody to having a pre-print that nobody printed

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:25.160
that everybody had to ignore because it showed that a RNA was somehow or another showing up

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:31.720
identical in all these places around the world not changing at all as they kept finding it

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.800
unlike the last time they had to trace one of these RNAs around the world where it changed

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:45.160
10 or 12 or 30 amino acids every time they got a sequence that pre-print has never been printed

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:51.000
then pre-print has never been published i covered it twice on my bike in the beginning of this thing

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.520
in 2020 and she would not communicate with us that that did not happen but she wrote a book

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:05.560
she's selling one of those books and now she's here to tell us about this gain of function research

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.920
this worst case scenario that's just around the corner

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:18.520
i i can't stress enough how i think team worst case scenario was one of the most important

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:28.120
aspects of the pandemic thanks for having me so if it is possible to to calm us down to make our

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:35.160
us less fearful please do so but i i know you'll be as honest and blunt as necessary what is this

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.240
is this study not somehow not as bad as it seems what's going on

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.960
yes the the wording in this study is a bit unfortunate because the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.920
also causes a hundred percent of humanized mice to to die so it's not clear based on this new

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:59.080
letter whether or not the the pangolin virus is is more concerning than the pandemic i want you to

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:06.520
consider the possibility that humanized mice under the cag promoter could be the worst possible

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:15.800
disease model given the coronavirus cartoon narrative it is possible that they have actually

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:24.200
engineered a toxin and then engineered a mouse to be vulnerable to the toxin and then have told us

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:29.400
that when we scored a bunch of the RNA encoding the toxin into the mouse's nose that after the

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:35.640
nose an epithelium manufacture the toxin that the mouse's immune system goes apeshit really

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:43.720
wow surprising and you can find that RNA in places after you injected it really wow that's surprising

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:49.560
ladies and gentlemen we can't take any of this for granted anymore we can't take any of their

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:55.640
models of infection for granted anymore and this is a model of infection it is a genetically

01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:04.520
altered mouse that is being used to justify the lethality of a virus it is being used to justify

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:12.200
the existence of pandemic potential without these mice we wouldn't be able to know how dangerous

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.440
these viruses are but with humanized mice holy crap they all die

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:25.800
but wait i thought SARS-CoV-2 was a really really uh not so lethal virus and that was the trick it

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:33.800
was an incapacitating agent but it killed all the mice so how useful of a disease model they are

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:41.480
those mice if they die from a uh a virus that everybody now apparently agrees on that it infected

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.680
so many people went around the the earth for five years has actually very mild and that's why

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:53.480
everybody had it but most people didn't get sick i'm drowning in contradictions here

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:02.360
this is extraordinary and they have bamboozled our friends our families our neighbors everyone

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:07.560
our teachers at their school the high school kids the college kids the college professors that

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.560
haven't pulled their head out are completely bamboozled by this mythology

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.840
virus but it is yet another example where the public is only learning about risky virus research

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.640
once it is done once it is done and published that's when the public finds out so people don't

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.600
don't get to find out before the work is done that is apparently no consultation and what this

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.480
means is that if these viruses had not been published and if they unfortunately leaked from a lab

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:43.160
and they didn't create it this is not created it's an RNA it's an RNA

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:50.280
that they generate with a combination of PCR fishing and then metagenomic sequencing they

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.720
said it right in their in their papers that's how they found the original gx pl4 whatever it is

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.320
you can read those papers that's how they do it that's how they did it that's how they always do it

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:08.760
it would be no way for the public to tell if this was from nature or if it came from a lab

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:14.360
it had been genetically enhanced so this is a real the reason why there's no way for you to tell is

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:21.000
because any significant RNA signal has to be generated by a synthetic virus it has a synthetic

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.800
molecule it has to be it has to be generated in a laboratory because there are no significant

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:33.720
homogenous circulating RNA signals in nature holy cow i just said it better than i've ever

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:42.680
said it before there are no there are no highly homologous circulating RNA signals in nature there

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:49.480
are none but they can create something that's approximate to that they can create models of that

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:55.560
in a laboratory and they can create humanized mice and then use them as models for that we are

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.520
getting farther and farther and farther away from anything that has any relation to reality

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:08.760
and yet we are trying to suggest that this is implying a pandemic potential a pandemic potential

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.480
that's even worse than SARS-CoV-2 or in her case that's not any worse than SARS-CoV-2 because

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:18.040
SARS-CoV-2 also kills 100% of humanized ACE2 mice

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:31.560
you're accepting their their gain of function monster when you accept the idea of what what

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.680
Brian Hooker said here and i love Brian Hooker he is a hero he is the guy who drove across the

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:47.880
country to confront the CDC in person and found the first definitive evidence that the CDC was

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.600
hiding that they knew that vaccines were hurting kids and especially black boys

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.600
Brian Hooker is a hero he's going to be a hero for all time but here he is confused

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:06.520
he is confused because he thinks that if an RNA sequence is created that has the right

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:12.040
combination of bases that it can circulate the globe for five years and it cannot

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.920
write

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.640
high fidelity replication of RNA is not possible it does not happen there's no evidence for it

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:30.840
and the idea that you can use RNA a special RNA sequence as i showed you here

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.440
the idea that you can use a special RNA sequence and you can put it in a cell culture you can put

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.920
it in an animal and that it will change as it moves through that animal it will change as it

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:52.680
infects that animal to go from being okay to being a pandemic potential virus or even worse than it

01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:03.080
was when it went in there is no biology to support that idea because in the end every one of these

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:11.560
replication steps is highly inefficient highly erroneous and highly prone to recombination

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:21.080
and recombination during RNA replication is essentially an end point to stop a break

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:32.040
and so that's why hundreds of thousands of the first gene encoded in these self-replicating RNAs

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.960
is made hundreds of thousands of times more often than the whole genome

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.960
and so i'm just going on the stuff that we think we know and the stuff that we think they're not

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.440
lying about it's still possible that the no-virus people the super skepticists say that there's

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:57.640
nothing of none of this is real that even these self-replicating RNAs are an illusion but i i tend

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:03.000
to believe that it's possible that what they've really done is tricked us into believing that

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.800
they're working on a natural phenomenon in reality what they're working on is something that they hope

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:14.680
will become a useful phenomenon and that they're they're making an approximation of what they think

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.840
they found in nature but they can never really make nature give it to them on a regular basis

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.360
so they have an approximation it's called an infectious clone and that's how they get these

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.400
kinds of experiments to appear to work because if you put an infectious clone down here

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:35.640
or in this case an infectious clone from a pangolin here and then you passage it you can get another

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:42.520
you can get a different RNA at the end over here and that RNA could be cloned and put into an

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:48.040
animal and then that animal would get sick and then you could say look at that wow isn't that cool

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:58.840
and so he says given the high level of mutation of these RNA viruses which is the reason why you

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:06.760
need to start with clones the mere experimentation involving the eight infected humanized mice could

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:13.400
select for mutations that interact more robustly with the human ACE2 receptor that is the mythology

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:23.400
they want to teach our kids and that is a misleading mythology that doesn't have any proof in nature

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:34.520
it just simply doesn't these self-replicating RNAs do not behave this way and they are

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.200
absolutely positively spectacularly committed to the lie that they do but they all know that

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.240
they start with cloned RNA they start with RNA that's been produced using DNA plasmids and whole

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.520
thing they definitely definitely definitely do

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.760
and so it's really not good that they have this we have this going on right now i mean it's just

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:08.280
wrong i'm saying for for the world what do we know about this safety protocol in effect at the lab

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:14.360
where the study was done as i understand it a big part of the negligence with respect to COVID-19

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.200
was that the kind of equipment being used at the lab was insufficient for the

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:26.760
virality of the the virus that was being created and so she thinks she's figuring this out right

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.080
that oh yeah i heard that the biosafety level that was used for these viruses is actually lower than

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:37.480
it should be and that could be the reason why it leaked it's scooby-doo live on your youtube

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:45.400
channel and because they're not biologists because their salary depends on them not knowing

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.440
this is all just it's all just narrative nonsense getting you to think that there is an ongoing

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.640
mystery being solved and that Alina Chan is one of those one of those people like velma that's

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:08.040
figuring it out for lab and a different part of china uh but typically these types of viruses

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:14.280
had been handled at pretty low biosafety at bsl2 so at this level there's almost no tracking

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.320
of lab escapes so if you had been infected by a virus like sars covid 2 that has only

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.320
malt symptoms there's no way you would have caught that and traced it back so what are the arguments

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.840
that i made in 2020 already and one of the ways that i got to where i am now

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.200
was coming to the conclusion first of all that if all this lab leaking is happening all the time

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.560
that started to make me think that wait then maybe we don't have any clue about the background

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:46.520
what if the background is just full of coronavirus it's just full of RNA RNA signals that are from

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:55.000
from pharmaceutical companies dumping stuff in the water RNA from animals and plants RNA from

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.800
insects RNA from from these noisy signals called coronaviruses in there everywhere and in all mammals

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.760
and so therefore they have led us to believe that the background is relatively pure and clean when

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.920
in reality it's just absolutely chock full of signals and we can talk to nathan wolf to hear

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.320
all about that because that's what he made is living on his story his sales pitch for meta biota

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:29.400
was that there was all this biological information out there that represented new life forms dark

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:38.920
matter of life and so while we pcr go on pcr fishing expeditions thinking that the only thing we can

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:44.440
catch are coronaviruses with these with these hooks really we could be catching anything

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.480
and then once we decide that we caught something in that sample then we start to use

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.760
all kinds of other techniques like metagenomic sequencing to find something in that sample

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:07.400
and if the background signal of RNA and DNA is very very very very very thick deep

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:15.400
and heterogeneous then you could find almost anything there depending on your rigorousness

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:20.280
of your of your search and these searches that they've done historically are not rigorous at all

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.080
and certainly don't use the kinds of positives and negative controls that somebody would do if

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:34.760
they really wanted to prove the existence of a virus but as i've heard so cleverly described

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.400
a couple days ago that the the genius of the no virus argument with regard to

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.080
isolation and purification is that it becomes this circular thing you have to argue about these

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:54.360
things you have to argue about these methodologies when the virologists have already moved on from

01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:02.600
that and think that that's a a stepping stone to sequencing and since they first do the voodoo

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:09.800
of psychopathic effects and the voodoo of passage in cell culture before they do the sequencing

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.200
virology has lost touch with the idea of what these things are doing but again because the

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:22.760
no virus people were so compartmentalized on this one aspect of the methodology without simply

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:30.920
trying to keep working through the whole experimental isolation and characterization process with the

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.840
virologists to the point where the virologists would have to see it was what was so clever about

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:43.720
it and here again we have somebody that's just harping on the absolute worst case scenario is

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:49.320
that viruses can circulate for five years six years forever we missed the window and now this

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:54.920
is an endemic virus too bad we didn't listen to Brent Weinstein who had three easy ways to

01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:01.960
have zero COVID forever and an investigation so this this letter that came out about the

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:07.320
pangolin virus actually did not state at what level of virus safety the experiments were done

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.800
so it could have been low it could have been high there's no way to tell so I think this is

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:17.960
yet another reminder that we can't let scientists self-regulate on these sort of experiments you know

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:23.560
because the benefits are unclear of the study but the risks are real so the risk could impact

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.040
billions of people around the world so a scientist might act on a dangerous idea in

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.440
appropriate biosafety and unfortunately billions of people paid a price so this is yet another

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:38.920
reminder that we can't just let scientists do whatever they want and as a reminder for viewers

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:46.600
the difference in the kind of lab safety protocols between the US and some labs in China

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:52.280
what has actually been revealed to be a selling point that has been a selling point for doing

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:57.080
the research you know we've covered on the show from the US right to know doing this reporting

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.200
showing that some of the one of the grants that that eco health alliance was trying to get you

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.880
know specifically was was persuading the the oversight officials that it would be done the

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:12.200
research would be done in the US but there's that note where they're saying but once we get it approved

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.000
we can actually do it in China where there's less to worry about it in terms of oversight and so

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.160
this is really just the Scooby-Doo and I wanted you to see it I wanted you to see that where we

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:27.880
are this is the fifth year of the pandemic and we still have Alina Chan who came to prominence

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:34.200
in May of 2020 still leading the Scooby-Doo narrative and we're still at the same place we were

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:40.280
four years earlier do you see it now do you see how dangerous it is that the train

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:50.680
is is leaving the lie is becoming the truth it's fifth year the fifth year and Alina Chan still

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:57.960
selling books and still selling the worst-case scenario and I think so is this guy

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:06.120
welcome to today's talk Thursday the 18th of January now being a fairly sad individual I was

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:12.600
browsing through the Cambridge dictionary and I found a rather interesting idiom that's the link

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:19.000
there now the idiom is accidentally on purpose and it means this if you do something accidentally on

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.960
purpose you do it intentionally but pretend it happened by chance and so he's actually describing

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:32.280
the scenario that we watched last night that was made for that course in Australia where Antonio

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:39.800
Hardy and Tonya Hardy the creator of the vaccine also actually had released the virus

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:47.240
and she did that in order to release the vaccine and so it's a story very similar to this one right

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:52.120
where you would stage a pandemic so that you could convert your warm base of manufacturing

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:58.520
from traditional vaccines to mRNA so that you could justify the spending of trillions of dollars

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.840
to set up this new base of warm base of manufacturing around the world that could make

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:11.000
transfection and so now you have have all of the warm base manufacturing you need around the world

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.880
to make transfections forever and transfections are very legal plug-and-play kind of thing now

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:22.040
we're making coronavirus transfections but we can make whatever we want now and make it in high

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:29.000
quantities all around the world and so if we want to spike the sewers with something new we can we

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
want to spray it into the subways we can you want to you want to this is the place where we are right

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.600
now and so as we start talking about disease x what we're not talking about is the fact that

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.920
we've always had the ability to do this we've had the ability to put a sequence anywhere

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.720
and it as many places as we want with as high a fidelity as we want to imply spread

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:59.800
we've had the ability to transfect people with immunogens with with proteins that will cause

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.400
an immune reactions which could cause an allergic reaction which could cause

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:09.080
a not so different than than some kind of interotoxin B kind of thing

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:17.720
and so transfection is possible transfection is real and it was real before the pandemic

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:26.680
RNA being dropped in a puddle or on the back of someone's shoe or in the combination of two cages

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:35.640
and then that RNA faithfully and high fidelity replicating around the earth is impossible

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:43.320
but we can transfect people we can make high quant large quantities of high fidelity copies

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:50.200
of RNA and DNA we can do all that Kevin McCurnan can definitely explain how those various processes

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.720
could be done and how we can make large quantities of biologics we know we can do that that's easy

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:04.920
and so the fact of the matter is this guy is still 100% on narrative he's about to tell

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:12.280
you that again accident on purpose they could release something on purpose that would go around

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:19.880
the earth and do damage to people in perpetuity out of their control this is a narrative it is a

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.160
mythology of gain of function that they want us to teach our children when we cannot do it

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:33.000
we really can't i'm starving i'm i'm so hungry that i'm quitting early i was going to play that

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.760
video uh we don't need to play that video um i got a whole bunch of other stuff i was going to do

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:47.480
tonight but i'm not going to do it because it is time for uh midnight snack and um

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.960
i didn't have i didn't have very much dinner tonight because we she made this pasta with

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:58.360
salmon in it and the kids really liked it by the time i got to the table there was hardly any

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:04.360
left so um i need to to figure out what i'm going to do but i think i'm going to make a sandwich or

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:10.120
something like that ladies and gentlemen we are at a time point where human diversity is at its peak

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:14.200
and so there will never be more genetic diversity again and i think they've been telling each other

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.960
a story in these back rooms about how a artificial general intelligence is going to come and help

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:25.640
them organize the data that they are collecting now the data from our college kids the genomic

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.400
data that they got from our college kids the medical data that they're going to take from their

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:35.960
children they are inverting their sovereignty they don't care about us they don't care about us 50

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.560
year old guys they care about our kids and they care about our kids kids this is a multi-generational

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.720
game ladies and gentlemen they don't mind if it's going to take them 20 years to usurp us

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:52.760
i don't think it's going to take 20 years but i do think that that timescale has not by any

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:59.800
stretch of the imagination out of the or out of the question and so that's why i'm advocating very

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.680
much for the fact that we have to stop transfection and healthy humans full stop because they are

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:10.280
trying to eliminate the control group and i am trying very hard to convince people to subscribe

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:19.560
to my work because i want to have giga ohm establish itself as an independent science news source

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:27.640
on the internet that people trust i think there's a real niche for a biologist that can express

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:34.840
things as succinctly as this so ladies and gentlemen intramuscular injection of any

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.440
combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:44.600
transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and you academic professors out there

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.680
that use transfection in your work better pull your head out soon and viruses are not pattern

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:55.640
integrity thank you very much for joining me this is the independent bright web there are a few

01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.600
members of the independent bright web i think marq satanic considers himself one he's on a

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:06.440
little hiatus you can find him on other channels like mid shoot and elsewhere and you can also

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.400
find him on twitter don't forget he keeps us pretty up to date as well thank you very

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:17.160
much for joining me ladies and gentlemen you can find me at giga ohmbiological.com

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:25.480
and also giga ohm.bio you can find my confession at that scooby-doo link up there you can scroll

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:33.240
down for a schedule for a phone number where you can leave a voicemail and also links where

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.280
you can subscribe so you can either help me out month by month you can help me out quarterly

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:44.040
which is actually the most generous of gifts and then also you can help me out as an annual

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.640
collaborator that's once a year it just depends on how you feel like doing it i don't i don't even

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:54.920
know the original idea was that that was supposed to be some kind of ladder but it didn't end up

01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:00.040
that way because they made the monthly just ten dollars because you wanted to have something

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:06.760
smaller because i don't think everybody can afford to serve to help that much but there are

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:12.280
annual subscribers here quarterly subscribers here monthly subscribers here all of these people

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:21.480
are responsible for what you see and thank them very much for it and i do as well so does my family

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:26.040
thanks very much for joining me i will see you again tomorrow i will see you again tomorrow

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:33.480
i said i will see you again tomorrow
