WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Can you thank you very much?

00:02.400 --> 00:03.240
That should be it.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.080
Dang it, dang it, dang it.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.280
How did I screw this time up again?

00:17.320 --> 00:19.080
Always the same crap.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.080
It's no problem.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.960
So, Kooti, yes.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.520
Well, it's okay for you.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.720
Yeah, the sound here is fine for me, as long as you can.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
Okay, good, fine.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.400
So, maybe I'm going to begin with the reynion,

00:35.400 --> 00:36.480
as it's still the reynion.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.520
Okay, I'm going to start with the reynion.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.040
I'm going to start with the reynion.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.120
I'm going to start with the reynion.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.280
Okay, I'll start with the reynion.

00:47.280 --> 00:56.600
Same, nine, ark, seven, six, fune, fier, tri, swy, eyns.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.160
Yeah, I'm turning for the reynion.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.120
So, I'm going to start with the reynion.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.120
I know, I'm excited to see the reynion.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.240
I'm going to start with the reynion.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.920
I'm going to start with the reynion.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.200
I'm going to start with the reynion.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.000
Hello, JJ.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm glad you're with us.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.600
We had a little bit of a mix up with regards to timing,

01:17.600 --> 01:18.840
but that's no problem.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.800
We are very excited to talk to you.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.840
It would be great if maybe you could introduce yourself.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.240
Yeah, and then we can take it from there.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.440
Thanks very much for having me.

01:32.440 --> 01:37.560
My name is Jonathan Couey, and I am a recovering academic

01:37.560 --> 01:39.920
neurobiologist.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.520
I had about a, I don't know, a 15 or 20 year career

01:43.520 --> 01:48.560
as an academic biologist before the pandemic started.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.880
And after speaking out against measures and mandates,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.920
I was told to go home from my position

01:55.920 --> 01:58.200
at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine

01:58.200 --> 02:01.000
as a research assistant professor.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.360
And I continued to speak out against the,

02:04.360 --> 02:06.160
I don't know what I would characterize it as,

02:06.160 --> 02:09.200
other than nonsense, the biological nonsense

02:09.200 --> 02:13.040
that was being characterized as a pandemic.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.480
I didn't figure it out right away.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.840
I don't want anybody to think that I came to where I am now

02:18.840 --> 02:21.800
after a few days of thinking about it.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.040
For a very long time in 2020, I was still convinced

02:26.040 --> 02:28.240
that there was a lab leak that was being covered up

02:28.240 --> 02:31.160
and that this was what was happening.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.040
And as my understanding of virology and the biology

02:35.040 --> 02:43.920
underlying the idea of a pandemic started to clarify a little bit,

02:43.920 --> 02:45.440
or I started to clarify it a little bit,

02:45.440 --> 02:49.120
I've come to realize that that's probably not what happened.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.160
And so I've spent my last three years

02:51.160 --> 02:55.640
basically trying to learn enough immunology and virology.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.440
And the biology that I didn't know previous to the pandemic

02:59.440 --> 03:02.280
so that I could understand what really happened.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.480
And so I found myself, how can I say it,

03:06.480 --> 03:09.080
crossing paths with a lot of people.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.360
A lot of people have come to my house in Pittsburgh

03:11.360 --> 03:14.560
to visit and talk to me about this stuff.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.040
And most of the people that have come to visit me

03:17.040 --> 03:18.920
have turned out to be medlers in the sense

03:18.960 --> 03:23.080
that they didn't really have my or my family's best interest in mind.

03:23.080 --> 03:27.120
And so over the last three years, I've come to understand

03:27.120 --> 03:29.960
that most of the people who have stepped up to speak out

03:29.960 --> 03:35.880
have in some way or another been well, been compromised.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.000
And I don't think it's to say that there are bad people.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.440
I think it's to say that something very serious

03:42.440 --> 03:46.840
occurred across the globe, across these Western countries

03:46.840 --> 03:49.760
that involves a government operation.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.040
And that government operation gives a priority to a narrative.

03:54.040 --> 03:59.560
And so people who are in control of this theater

03:59.560 --> 04:02.880
have perpetuated this narrative that a pandemic occurred

04:02.880 --> 04:04.680
and that it's actually not a very bad one.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.200
And it could be much worse in the future.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.240
And I think this is a mythology that they've been trying to install

04:11.240 --> 04:14.920
for a number of years so that our children or the so even worse

04:14.920 --> 04:17.920
that we will teach this mythology to our children

04:17.920 --> 04:19.760
and that they can be governed by it forever.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.720
And I think that's the crossroads that all of humanity is at right now.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.880
And it sounds a bit maybe overdramatic or overdramatic,

04:28.880 --> 04:29.760
but it's really not.

04:29.760 --> 04:34.000
It's really where we are right now.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.160
We need to reevaluate our basic understanding of who we are

04:38.160 --> 04:42.400
as a species and where we fit in the natural world.

04:42.520 --> 04:47.840
And I think we need to start to really introspectively think

04:47.840 --> 04:50.720
about what the idea of a pandemic really is

04:50.720 --> 04:53.760
and what the biology that they claim really is

04:53.760 --> 04:56.760
and then investigate whether or not this biology has

04:56.760 --> 04:58.200
any foundation in reality.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.960
Because I think we will find that a lot of what

05:01.960 --> 05:05.040
is misconstrued as public health is actually

05:05.040 --> 05:09.280
a large mythology that's been thrown on us.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.360
It sounds very scary and it sounds very daunting

05:13.360 --> 05:14.640
to try and penetrate this.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.240
But I think in reality, a lot of people

05:17.240 --> 05:19.800
have felt this inside for a long time.

05:19.800 --> 05:23.800
A lot of academic biologists have the tool set

05:23.800 --> 05:28.840
to understand this deception and just have chosen not

05:28.840 --> 05:34.720
to apply their critical thinking to this particular problem.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.200
And I think that's one of the magics of where I am.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.920
I used to be an academic biologist so I understand

05:41.920 --> 05:46.320
exactly how focused one has to be in order

05:46.320 --> 05:47.840
to succeed in that environment.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.600
And that extreme focus and specialization

05:51.600 --> 05:54.920
has created a bunch of really smart thinkers

05:54.920 --> 05:58.560
that are so hyper focused on one biological problem

05:58.560 --> 06:01.760
that they have essentially undermined themselves

06:01.760 --> 06:03.840
and as responsible adults.

06:03.840 --> 06:08.480
And they can't apply their unique skill set to reality.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.160
They just apply it to this one academic pursuit.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.160
And they take everything else for granted.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.880
And I think that mistake has been made by so many hundreds

06:17.880 --> 06:21.960
of thousands of biologists that have this inherent love

06:21.960 --> 06:24.520
of biology, this inherent, inherent respect

06:24.520 --> 06:26.360
for the sacredness of life.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.280
They have this inherent understanding

06:28.280 --> 06:31.800
of the irreducible complexity that they are knocking

06:31.800 --> 06:33.480
against all the time.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.560
And yet some reason or another because of the way

06:36.560 --> 06:38.720
the academic environment is set up,

06:38.720 --> 06:43.880
people like me who have this intense love of everything

06:43.880 --> 06:47.480
alive can be put in a laboratory.

06:47.480 --> 06:53.560
And that fascination and that love for everything sacred

06:53.560 --> 06:58.360
can be sort of compartmentalized to answer one question.

06:58.360 --> 07:06.120
And in that extreme focus, monastery style focus,

07:06.120 --> 07:08.760
you lose touch with the rest of the world.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.600
And this has resulted in, I think,

07:13.600 --> 07:18.520
the biology of public health being

07:18.520 --> 07:20.320
contorted into what it is today.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.400
And there are no biologists that are in love with biology

07:24.400 --> 07:28.880
that are curating this public health mythology.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.800
None of these people are there for that reason.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.760
They're all there for power, for greed,

07:35.760 --> 07:40.360
for intellectual property, for money.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.320
None of these individuals that have led us

07:43.320 --> 07:47.520
through the last four years are children who

07:47.520 --> 07:50.320
grew up as biologists and teachers who

07:50.320 --> 07:54.280
grew up as biologists and lovers of the natural world.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.240
These are not who we are being led by right now.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.480
We are being led by individuals who,

08:00.480 --> 08:03.160
by wittingly or unwittingly, have given up

08:03.160 --> 08:07.640
the understanding of what it means to be a human

08:07.640 --> 08:09.920
and what it means to understand where

08:09.920 --> 08:12.480
that line of sacredness starts.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.880
When a baby comes out of the womb, it's pretty much perfect.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.120
That idea has been wholly discarded

08:18.120 --> 08:20.400
by our academic biologists.

08:20.400 --> 08:24.280
And that's really a tragedy from which this all comes.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.680
And so it has a really long introduction

08:26.680 --> 08:29.080
that I would say I'm a lifelong biologist who

08:29.080 --> 08:32.000
wandered his way through life trying

08:32.000 --> 08:34.800
to figure out what to do with this extreme fascination

08:34.800 --> 08:36.400
and love for the living world.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
And I found myself in academic biology

08:39.400 --> 08:42.400
for a long time asking questions about the brain

08:42.400 --> 08:45.160
and being very happy with that job.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.440
I actually thought it was the most amazing job

08:47.440 --> 08:50.440
because I got to use high-powered electron,

08:50.440 --> 08:52.960
or not electron, but a high-powered microscopes,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.880
high-powered confocal microscopy.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.560
It's a lot of photography.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.720
It's a lot of high-precision measurements.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.360
It's a lot of very interesting things

09:02.360 --> 09:04.800
that include surgery and all this other stuff

09:04.800 --> 09:05.880
that you get to do.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.040
And so it's a really wonderful pursuit

09:08.040 --> 09:10.280
because you really are monastery-style,

09:10.280 --> 09:12.080
focused on a question.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.640
But now the question becomes, is that the right question?

09:15.640 --> 09:19.600
Are you pursuing an avenue which is expanding

09:19.600 --> 09:22.480
our understanding of who we are as a species?

09:22.480 --> 09:24.720
And I believed personally what I was doing

09:24.720 --> 09:26.160
in neuroscience was doing that.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.440
But I also was keenly aware that there were many, many,

09:29.440 --> 09:32.640
many avenues of investigation that we're not doing that.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.640
And not just in neuroscience, but across the board

09:35.640 --> 09:38.200
in the biological sciences in general.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.440
And that's really the unique perspective I think I bring

09:42.440 --> 09:46.240
to this is that I've had my feet on the floor

09:46.240 --> 09:49.440
of a laboratory where grant money is important

09:49.440 --> 09:50.560
for a very long time.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.200
I watched how this, what this does to intelligent people

09:54.200 --> 09:58.200
and how rewarding it feels for them

09:58.200 --> 09:59.720
to succeed in this environment,

09:59.720 --> 10:02.440
but also how isolating it is

10:02.440 --> 10:07.440
and how it takes away the power

10:09.040 --> 10:11.800
that they would have as a leader in their community,

10:11.800 --> 10:12.960
for example.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.560
Most of these people, I'm just babbling here.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.600
Most of these people who are professors

10:18.600 --> 10:22.120
at universities should probably also be community leaders

10:22.120 --> 10:25.040
where maybe they're a mayor or they're a board member

10:25.040 --> 10:28.480
or they influence decision in their community.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.920
But because this academic job is so all encompassing

10:32.920 --> 10:37.320
and so borders on obsession,

10:37.320 --> 10:39.680
they have no extra energy for their children

10:39.680 --> 10:40.880
or for their wife or their marriage.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.800
Nevermind for contributing to the governance

10:43.800 --> 10:44.640
of their community.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.960
So one of the amazing things that this academic,

10:49.880 --> 10:54.360
you know, the ivory tower has done to the way that our,

10:55.680 --> 10:58.440
we govern our communities is that some of the,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.760
who probably would be some of the more respectable leaders,

11:01.760 --> 11:04.360
some of the more articulate leaders

11:04.360 --> 11:06.280
have been taken out of that arena

11:06.280 --> 11:09.160
and put into this, you know,

11:09.160 --> 11:12.000
this rat race ladder climbing exercise

11:12.000 --> 11:13.560
which feels very good to them

11:13.560 --> 11:15.520
because they get to ask these,

11:15.520 --> 11:17.280
what they feel are interesting questions,

11:17.280 --> 11:21.280
but the way that the funding has been used to sculpt

11:21.280 --> 11:25.600
that pursuit for the last 40 years has resulted

11:25.600 --> 11:28.640
in a lot of wasted money, a lot of wasted pursuit

11:28.640 --> 11:31.640
and a lot of bad assumptions

11:31.640 --> 11:34.360
upon which public health is now based.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.360
And so we have many, many years of work

11:38.360 --> 11:43.360
to try to reverse this and the pandemic,

11:43.760 --> 11:47.040
I hope has given us some open windows

11:47.040 --> 11:49.440
with which to show people what's really going on

11:49.440 --> 11:50.640
and what's really happening.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.480
And so I'm hoping that we can maintain this momentum enough

11:54.480 --> 11:58.600
so that we can start to get to a lot of these academic biologists

11:58.600 --> 12:03.120
who as I said earlier have the tool set to crack this puzzle

12:03.120 --> 12:07.160
but haven't yet put any of their critical thinking faculties

12:07.160 --> 12:08.600
toward reality again.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.880
They're still super focused on their,

12:10.920 --> 12:14.360
their academic pursuits because that's what they've told

12:14.360 --> 12:17.480
is the way that they're supposed to contribute to the world.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.080
So that, I don't know how that,

12:19.080 --> 12:20.880
that's the worst introduction I've ever given,

12:20.880 --> 12:21.960
but there it is.

12:22.920 --> 12:23.760
That's all right.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.680
I think it's right on the point basically.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.600
So would you think that because,

12:28.600 --> 12:31.600
I mean, since there's a lot of grant money involved,

12:31.600 --> 12:36.160
so people, you say it's maybe also limiting their,

12:36.160 --> 12:38.040
you know, the approach they take

12:38.040 --> 12:41.200
to what they, the field that they maybe do research in

12:41.200 --> 12:45.520
because there's money only for this kind of research and so on.

12:45.520 --> 12:50.520
So that also makes a limits, you know, the fields where you,

12:51.080 --> 12:53.480
and maybe it's also an incentive,

12:53.480 --> 12:56.840
an incentive for maybe even coming out with like say,

12:56.840 --> 13:00.840
fraudulent or like manipulated statistics and so on

13:00.840 --> 13:02.960
because you, you think, oh, it has to be,

13:02.960 --> 13:05.360
there's more, more grants coming up if I say,

13:05.360 --> 13:06.760
oh, there's long COVID and I have,

13:06.760 --> 13:08.960
we have to do this and that or so.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.880
That's also a distortion.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.280
It's definitely spot on.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.480
I think that, that, that I can give you several examples

13:15.480 --> 13:17.760
where this is actually the primary mechanism

13:17.760 --> 13:22.760
by which these, these idea spaces are, are sculpted.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.480
And so one example might be the genetic causes of autism.

13:27.480 --> 13:31.600
If you fund $1 billion to investigate genetic correlations

13:31.600 --> 13:36.040
with autism and you, you, you use these grants

13:36.040 --> 13:38.320
to do a couple different things.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.320
Number one, you use these grants to tell people like me

13:42.320 --> 13:44.240
what the right question to ask is.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.560
Now, if I'm an academic biologist, I need to find money.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.640
And so I've got to look for grant calls

13:50.640 --> 13:53.800
and every grant call has a specific little limited window

13:53.800 --> 13:56.880
of investigation that your question should fall under.

13:56.880 --> 14:00.760
And in this respect of genetic causes of autism

14:00.760 --> 14:05.160
has caused an entire field of neuroscience

14:05.160 --> 14:10.160
to almost completely transform into the assumption

14:10.520 --> 14:14.360
that autism is caused exclusively by genes.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.800
And so there has been so much investigation

14:17.800 --> 14:21.400
into correlation in animal models of autism,

14:21.400 --> 14:24.520
which are another thing that get,

14:24.520 --> 14:27.840
that get, essentially they get codified or,

14:27.840 --> 14:30.440
or canonized by these grant calls

14:30.440 --> 14:33.200
because after five years of funding research

14:33.240 --> 14:35.760
into the genetic causes of autism,

14:35.760 --> 14:38.600
you've also funded five years of research

14:38.600 --> 14:41.120
into animal models of autism.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.280
And by, by no fault of their own

14:45.280 --> 14:47.320
have made these legitimate models,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.520
legitimate models because all these papers

14:49.520 --> 14:51.480
from the previous years have come out.

14:51.480 --> 14:55.360
And so now there's a whole field that has precedence.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.000
And these models have precedence so that you can say,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.760
well, this guy did this study and this guy

15:00.760 --> 15:02.600
and this lady did this study.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.720
And so I'm following on the footsteps of their work.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.760
And so this pattern of building up

15:09.760 --> 15:13.480
the scientific literature has resulted in whole fields

15:13.480 --> 15:16.000
which are essentially probably working

15:16.000 --> 15:17.720
on the wrong assumption set,

15:17.720 --> 15:21.040
but have perpetuated because there is this literature

15:21.040 --> 15:24.720
foundation that they can use to justify what they're doing

15:24.720 --> 15:27.720
and what they're doing still fits

15:27.720 --> 15:30.080
within these grant research calls

15:30.080 --> 15:32.520
and these broad, not broad,

15:32.520 --> 15:35.000
but very limited spectrums of investigation

15:35.000 --> 15:36.760
that are established by the grant calls.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.480
And so it is of utmost importance to understand

15:40.480 --> 15:43.440
that the vast majority of academic neuroscientists,

15:43.440 --> 15:46.720
academic biologists, anybody that's investigating

15:46.720 --> 15:50.880
a medical thing is investigating a question

15:50.880 --> 15:53.560
that has been, they have been pigeonholed

15:53.560 --> 15:56.320
into asking because of who they studied with,

15:56.320 --> 15:59.360
what they did in their PhD, why they did their postdoc,

15:59.360 --> 16:04.200
these things already start to limit the sliver of biology

16:04.200 --> 16:05.560
that people can investigate.

16:05.560 --> 16:09.480
And then once they start trying to solicit their own money,

16:09.480 --> 16:12.600
they almost are forced to work on things

16:12.600 --> 16:14.080
that they worked on in the past

16:14.080 --> 16:15.960
in order to justify their expertise.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.000
And then lo and behold, you've got a whole world

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
full of academic biologists that specialize

16:22.000 --> 16:25.400
in a sliver of knowledge and a sliver of investigation.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.480
And by definition, are very careful

16:27.480 --> 16:29.200
about not stepping outside of that

16:29.200 --> 16:31.520
so that nobody can criticize them.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.680
And so this is...

16:32.680 --> 16:34.280
There's also a lot of angst involved.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.640
Absolutely there is.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.320
And in fact, that's a lot of how these fields work

16:38.320 --> 16:41.600
is that you become an expert in your sub-field,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.800
of this sub-field and then everybody cites you

16:43.800 --> 16:45.680
and they need to cite that thing,

16:45.680 --> 16:47.200
but they don't investigate it

16:47.200 --> 16:49.280
because they know that you're doing it.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.600
And so as long as this little, you know,

16:52.600 --> 16:57.200
monastery system of biology continues,

16:57.200 --> 17:00.120
then with certain funding streams

17:00.120 --> 17:02.280
and with certain priorities,

17:02.280 --> 17:07.280
they can perpetuate the idea that public health is X, Y, and Z,

17:07.400 --> 17:11.480
that pandemic potential can be measured with X, Y, and Z.

17:11.480 --> 17:16.120
And after 10 years, they have a literature foundation

17:16.120 --> 17:18.760
which can be pointed to as pandemic potential.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.480
And I think that's one of the tricks

17:21.480 --> 17:23.800
that has been pulled on us since about,

17:23.800 --> 17:27.160
I would say 2002, where they have slowly

17:27.160 --> 17:32.160
but surely led academic biologists,

17:32.560 --> 17:35.720
led bureaucrats and led the common populace

17:35.720 --> 17:38.200
into believing that RNA,

17:38.200 --> 17:41.160
if it has the right combination of bases,

17:41.160 --> 17:44.000
can perpetuate itself around the world

17:44.000 --> 17:45.600
with high fidelity for many years.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.280
And that's just biologically not true.

17:48.280 --> 17:52.440
RNA cannot make a protein

17:52.440 --> 17:56.360
and then copy itself and then jump from people to people

17:56.360 --> 18:00.320
without changing its sequence for hundreds of infections

18:00.320 --> 18:05.320
over millions of, the story that they've told us

18:05.320 --> 18:07.800
is not possible using RNA.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.840
It's just not, you can't leak RNA in a puddle

18:11.840 --> 18:14.600
and then have it get into one person's lungs

18:14.600 --> 18:19.080
and then some mechanism by which that RNA copies itself

18:19.080 --> 18:20.920
with high enough fidelity to be found

18:20.920 --> 18:24.280
in several places around the world with few changes.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.840
And then a few months later,

18:25.840 --> 18:29.200
many more places around the world with very few changes.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.280
This level of fidelity,

18:31.280 --> 18:34.440
there is no support for this in the biological literature.

18:34.440 --> 18:39.440
There is support for signals in this size scale.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.920
There is support for genetic signals of DNA and RNA

18:44.920 --> 18:47.640
in the background, but what they've done

18:47.680 --> 18:52.160
is essentially turned up the volume on a ham radio

18:52.160 --> 18:54.720
that's picking up noise from the atmosphere

18:54.720 --> 18:56.640
and then turned it up loud enough

18:56.640 --> 18:59.400
so that they could use an algorithm to say in that noise,

18:59.400 --> 19:01.320
there's some order.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.560
And we have been allowed,

19:05.560 --> 19:07.400
they have been allowed to get away with it

19:07.400 --> 19:09.920
because of the way that academic biology

19:09.920 --> 19:14.920
is in this monastery style, hyperspecialized.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.760
And then they've controlled that specialization.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.320
How many people work on coronaviruses?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.920
How many people work on RNA viruses?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.960
Not very many.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
And the ones that work on the ones that matter

19:27.520 --> 19:29.600
for purposes of pandemic

19:29.600 --> 19:33.120
and purposes of establishing pandemic potential,

19:33.120 --> 19:35.520
the list is extremely short.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.920
And the same people have-

19:37.920 --> 19:38.920
How many people?

19:38.920 --> 19:39.760
Sorry.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.960
I mean, it's less than 20.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.320
It's less than 15.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.720
Like worldwide, you think it's like 20 scientists

19:47.720 --> 19:49.680
to control this narrative?

19:49.680 --> 19:53.480
I mean, it's certainly less than 20 scientists

19:53.480 --> 19:55.800
that control the clones.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.360
And so that's the part of this

19:58.360 --> 20:01.080
that I think everybody essentially is missing

20:01.080 --> 20:06.120
and the part that I feel as though I want to be challenged on.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.760
I want some molecular biologist to come and say that I'm wrong.

20:09.760 --> 20:14.000
But essentially, what I feel like has ruined my life

20:14.000 --> 20:16.680
is not coming out against the lab leak

20:16.680 --> 20:18.000
or saying it's a lab leak.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.680
It's not coming out and saying the natural immunity

20:20.680 --> 20:25.240
to previous RNAs is more than adequate

20:25.240 --> 20:29.160
to protect us from this new one, if there is a new one.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.160
And that didn't ruin my life either.

20:31.160 --> 20:35.720
What ruined my life was when I started to say out loud

20:35.720 --> 20:37.880
that RNA can't pandemic,

20:37.880 --> 20:42.080
that RNA can't copy itself even once,

20:42.080 --> 20:44.400
it can't copy itself perfectly.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.920
DNA, because it's double-stranded,

20:46.920 --> 20:50.400
has this built-in ability to,

20:50.400 --> 20:54.560
it shows its errors because the double helix doesn't complete.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.080
At least that's how the cartoon is told to us.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.560
And there are other accessory enzymes

20:59.560 --> 21:02.320
that can come along and repair those errors.

21:02.320 --> 21:07.320
And so copying DNA into more DNA is thought to be

21:08.320 --> 21:12.160
from a biology perspective, a very high fidelity process.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.160
But copying RNA is actually something

21:15.160 --> 21:17.200
that isn't done very often.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.320
And so when it is done in the context

21:19.320 --> 21:23.880
of the virology cartoon, it is done in two different contexts.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.800
One is the negative strand RNA virus

21:26.800 --> 21:30.360
where they have to have an enzyme along with them.

21:30.360 --> 21:34.240
Because a negative strand RNA, like in a measles virus,

21:34.240 --> 21:37.520
can't be immediately converted into a protein

21:37.520 --> 21:39.480
by hijacking our machinery.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.840
Because it's a negative strand RNA, it doesn't work.

21:42.840 --> 21:47.920
So they need to have built into the viral a protein

21:47.920 --> 21:51.560
that can copy that RNA into a positive strand RNA

21:51.560 --> 21:54.440
which can run through our ribosome.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.120
So it's an interesting cartoon already.

21:57.120 --> 22:01.240
When you contrast the cartoon of a flu virus

22:01.240 --> 22:03.320
there are a measles virus which needs to have

22:03.320 --> 22:06.520
a built in protein enzyme already present

22:06.520 --> 22:11.120
in every variant that's gonna be infectious

22:11.120 --> 22:13.640
versus a coronavirus that actually doesn't

22:13.640 --> 22:16.600
because it's a positive strand, single stranded RNA

22:16.600 --> 22:20.520
and it actually, supposedly contains an RNA code

22:20.520 --> 22:22.880
for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.560
And so it doesn't have one in the viral

22:25.560 --> 22:27.920
but instead it makes one.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.000
And then that enzyme is supposed to copy

22:31.040 --> 22:32.800
and make new viruses.

22:32.800 --> 22:37.800
So in these two sort of illustrations,

22:39.160 --> 22:41.200
what you don't hear and what you don't see

22:41.200 --> 22:45.480
is that every single time the RNA dependent RNA polymerase

22:45.480 --> 22:49.320
makes a copy of that RNA by definition there are errors.

22:49.320 --> 22:54.320
It has to be, that is the foundational understanding

22:54.320 --> 22:55.160
of how this works.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.440
There's can't be proofreading.

22:57.440 --> 23:02.440
There is a accessory protein called exon exon

23:03.520 --> 23:07.360
that supposedly can increase the fidelity

23:07.360 --> 23:10.920
of coronavirus genome replication

23:10.920 --> 23:12.560
but it's not proofreading.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.720
It can't be proofreading because there's a very,

23:15.720 --> 23:17.080
it's not even really well understood

23:17.080 --> 23:21.400
but there's ever a double stranded RNA moment

23:21.400 --> 23:24.000
during the copying of the RNA in these things

23:24.000 --> 23:26.200
because we don't understand very well how this works.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.960
But the point would be that what they have described to us

23:30.960 --> 23:35.960
is a phenomenon where an RNA with a 30,000 base pair genome

23:37.040 --> 23:42.040
could be found in Iran, in Wuhan, in Washington state

23:42.040 --> 23:46.840
and in Italy and that a few months later

23:46.840 --> 23:50.040
it could be found in New York and in Florida

23:50.040 --> 23:54.360
and in Oklahoma and that relatively speaking

23:54.360 --> 23:58.240
that RNA signal would be almost identical

23:58.240 --> 24:02.720
across 30,000 bases, across all these different measurements

24:02.720 --> 24:06.560
and that has no precedence in the history of biology.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.280
There's no, not one paper that has ever demonstrated

24:10.280 --> 24:12.080
that this is even remotely possible

24:12.080 --> 24:14.720
and we have to understand what they've implied.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.600
They've implied millions of infections

24:18.600 --> 24:22.080
by the same RNA virus that originated from a point

24:23.080 --> 24:26.840
and that's just, it's the unfathomability,

24:26.840 --> 24:30.520
it's just so beyond absurd

24:30.520 --> 24:34.720
and then the spectacular commitment to this is what happened,

24:34.720 --> 24:40.720
it just reveals the thing for what it is.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.480
And so here's where we go full circle that I apologize,

24:43.480 --> 24:46.040
I almost lost track of my thoughts.

24:46.040 --> 24:50.440
If RNA can't do this, then what's really going on?

24:50.520 --> 24:53.520
Well, for the last 30 years,

24:53.520 --> 24:55.840
RNA viruses have been very difficult,

24:55.840 --> 24:59.360
if not impossible, to grow in culture.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.480
I'm not an expert on flu virus,

25:01.480 --> 25:04.920
but it does seem to be that flu viruses,

25:04.920 --> 25:08.960
flu virologists say that they can grow flu virus in cultures

25:08.960 --> 25:11.320
and in eggs and then they get a lot more flu virus.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.960
So I can't argue and I won't argue,

25:13.960 --> 25:16.080
I'm not sophisticated enough to argue with that,

25:16.080 --> 25:18.600
but what I will argue with is that what they grow there

25:18.680 --> 25:25.520
is a very heterogeneous, very mixed bag of RNA exosomes

25:25.520 --> 25:31.160
or RNA particles, it's not a high fidelity version

25:31.160 --> 25:34.520
of the flu and that's because of the way

25:34.520 --> 25:37.000
that these genes are copied

25:37.000 --> 25:38.440
and the way they sort themselves out.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.160
But it may be something that's useful

25:41.160 --> 25:42.680
for exposing your immune system,

25:42.680 --> 25:46.880
but my point is that when they study these viruses

25:46.960 --> 25:49.000
and it includes the flu,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.280
that a very standard procedure for these RNA signals

25:52.280 --> 25:53.800
is to convert them to DNA

25:53.800 --> 25:56.360
so that you can always go back to that sequence.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.640
And why is that important?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.320
Well, because it's not natural.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.080
If you sample whatever these RNA signals are

26:04.080 --> 26:06.680
from a bat or from a pangolin,

26:06.680 --> 26:12.040
you are basically using a very tiny PCR amplicon

26:12.040 --> 26:14.120
to be a flag for the existence

26:14.120 --> 26:18.560
of what you assume to be a 30,000 base pair genome.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.240
Once you get that very small amplicon flag,

26:21.240 --> 26:22.880
you say, oh yeah, there it is.

26:22.880 --> 26:27.960
And so then you use a fishing method to turn up the noise

26:27.960 --> 26:30.360
and then you look for a signal that fits

26:30.360 --> 26:34.440
a preconceived notion of what a coronavirus is.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.560
When you find it, you can't do anything about it.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.160
You can't grow that in a dish.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.240
You can't put it in a cell culture

26:41.240 --> 26:43.240
and grow enough of it to send all around the world

26:43.240 --> 26:45.800
because that's really not how they work.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.440
And instead, and they're trying to blame it on Ralph Barrick,

26:49.440 --> 26:52.000
but I think that's a little bit of a fudge

26:52.000 --> 26:53.920
in the sense of this molecular biology

26:53.920 --> 26:55.440
has been around for a very long time

26:55.440 --> 26:57.640
and applying it to these particular sequences

26:57.640 --> 26:59.160
is not that big a deal.

26:59.160 --> 27:04.200
We have known how to take different DNA pieces

27:04.200 --> 27:07.080
and stitch them together using endonucleases.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.840
We've known this for a very long time.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.800
Molecular biologists have been putting together

27:12.800 --> 27:15.840
different sequences of DNA for decades now.

27:15.840 --> 27:20.840
And so using this to make a 30,000 base pair genome

27:21.840 --> 27:24.600
of a coronavirus and then grow a lot of that DNA

27:24.600 --> 27:27.160
is a very normal baking procedure

27:27.160 --> 27:31.840
in pharmaceutical companies when they make antibodies.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.720
They have to do a very similar thing.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.360
Making biologic oftentimes involves making a DNA construct

27:39.360 --> 27:40.760
and then the protein comes from it.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.520
But the intermediate there is an RNA.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.280
And so the way that they've made this shot for everybody,

27:46.280 --> 27:50.800
the transfection shot is just simply a bacterial culture

27:50.800 --> 27:54.240
that makes the DNA and the DNA is,

27:54.240 --> 27:56.720
they lice the culture, they take the DNA out

27:56.720 --> 27:59.720
and then they put an RNA polymerase on it,

27:59.720 --> 28:02.800
they make the RNA, they purify the RNA as best they can

28:02.800 --> 28:04.920
and then they injected that into people

28:04.920 --> 28:07.240
after they combined it with a lipid nanoparticle.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.800
The point is is that the only way,

28:09.800 --> 28:12.560
the only way they've been able to study coronaviruses

28:12.560 --> 28:14.640
is if they start from a DNA construct

28:14.640 --> 28:16.560
that they make RNA clones from.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.760
And so all of these papers that have ever studied SARS-1,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.480
for example, you can look this up,

28:22.480 --> 28:25.600
a lot of these papers start with SARS-Urbani.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.280
SARS-Urbani is a sequence of SARS-1

28:28.280 --> 28:31.920
taken from a guy named Urbani in 2003 or 2002

28:32.800 --> 28:35.600
and they constructed a DNA clone of it.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.960
And then they generated RNA from that DNA clone.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.720
And now if you think very carefully about what happens

28:42.720 --> 28:45.600
when the natural virus is put into a cell culture

28:45.600 --> 28:48.280
or natural viruses sampled in nature,

28:48.280 --> 28:53.080
you have an RNA that's being copied by an RNA polymerase.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.200
When they make clones, they have a DNA

28:55.200 --> 28:58.880
that's being translated into RNA by an RNA polymerase,

28:58.880 --> 29:01.280
not an RNA dependent RNA polymerase,

29:01.280 --> 29:03.720
but an RNA polymerase that's designed to work

29:03.720 --> 29:07.720
or has evolved to work from DNA to RNA.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.880
And so that copying process is a little bit higher fidelity

29:10.880 --> 29:13.840
and more importantly, the template is higher fidelity.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.440
The enzyme doesn't jump off of DNA

29:17.440 --> 29:19.880
when it's making the RNA because that would make,

29:19.880 --> 29:22.920
that would be a big problem for us and making proteins.

29:22.920 --> 29:27.360
But the RNA dependent RNA polymerase is already well known

29:27.360 --> 29:31.120
to have a propensity to make many, many, many short genomic

29:31.120 --> 29:33.800
sequences of RNA as it copies the genome

29:33.800 --> 29:37.760
and almost never makes it from beginning to end

29:37.760 --> 29:42.080
of the original RNA and that can be seen in experiments

29:42.080 --> 29:43.920
from the 70s all the way up until now.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.720
No matter how they measurement,

29:45.720 --> 29:48.120
the full genome almost never gets copied

29:48.120 --> 29:50.000
and hundreds of thousands of copies

29:50.000 --> 29:53.160
of the sub-genomic RNAs are present after this happens.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.400
So again, the point is, is that whenever they've tried

29:56.400 --> 29:59.800
to sample these RNA signals from the wild,

29:59.800 --> 30:03.400
they peter out, they disappear, they collapse,

30:03.400 --> 30:05.560
there might have been a signal in the animal,

30:05.560 --> 30:07.960
there might have been a signal in the sick person,

30:07.960 --> 30:09.960
but they're never able to reconstruct

30:09.960 --> 30:13.280
and sustain this signal in any laboratory preparation

30:13.280 --> 30:18.280
because of the nature of RNA copying its lack of fidelity

30:21.120 --> 30:26.120
and the sort of erroneous nature of RNA dependent RNA polymerases

30:26.120 --> 30:27.920
the way that they work.

30:27.920 --> 30:32.400
And so they bypass this whole problem

30:32.400 --> 30:36.200
by taking whatever signal they purport to find in nature

30:36.200 --> 30:39.840
and making an RNA construct and always starting from there

30:39.840 --> 30:44.840
because then when they inject that infectious RNA

30:45.080 --> 30:48.680
into the animal, they are injecting a concentration

30:48.680 --> 30:53.440
and purity of full genome RNAs that could never,

30:53.440 --> 30:56.960
ever, ever, ever, ever be found in nature,

30:56.960 --> 31:00.800
could never occur in nature, could never exist in nature

31:00.800 --> 31:03.560
because again, RNA dependent RNA polymerase

31:03.560 --> 31:05.840
can't copy RNA like that.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.600
But if you take a DNA copy of it

31:07.600 --> 31:11.320
and then use a commercial version of RNA polymerase,

31:11.320 --> 31:16.320
you can make a very, very large, relatively pure amount

31:19.200 --> 31:23.360
of self-replicating RNA that you can put in an animal,

31:23.360 --> 31:25.200
you can send around the world,

31:25.200 --> 31:27.800
you can put on cell culture and the cell culture

31:27.800 --> 31:30.840
will make lots more RNA.

31:30.840 --> 31:35.840
And so all of the basic biology of virology

31:35.920 --> 31:39.240
can be of coronavirus virology can be recreated

31:39.240 --> 31:42.360
using these clones, but these clones, I'm arguing,

31:42.360 --> 31:46.920
are nowhere near related to whatever RNA signal

31:46.920 --> 31:48.680
they purport to be finding in nature.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.440
It just can't be possible, it's not.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.480
And this is, on the other hand,

31:54.480 --> 31:57.480
I hope that eventually I can shut up,

31:57.480 --> 32:02.480
is that this is the easy right in front of our hand,

32:02.760 --> 32:04.840
right in front of our face explanation

32:04.840 --> 32:07.240
for how this sequence could have been found

32:07.240 --> 32:10.120
in so many places at the same time.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.400
Because this is how coronavirus biology is done.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.760
If you wanted five labs in the world

32:15.760 --> 32:17.760
to work on your new coronavirus,

32:17.760 --> 32:19.840
the way that Ralph Barrick would do it

32:19.840 --> 32:22.000
is he would make a CDNA clone of it,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.360
he would produce enough infectious RNA

32:24.360 --> 32:25.880
to send around to all these labs

32:25.920 --> 32:28.200
and they'd all get a perfect sample.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.800
And that's indeed what they've done with SARS-CoV-2

32:30.800 --> 32:31.960
and some of these variants,

32:31.960 --> 32:33.840
that's what they've done with Omicron,

32:33.840 --> 32:35.720
that's what they do with a pangolin virus

32:35.720 --> 32:38.240
that they're now saying was 100% lethal

32:38.240 --> 32:42.520
in the ACE2, or human ACE2 mice that they put it in,

32:42.520 --> 32:46.280
they are confounding all of these different assumptions

32:46.280 --> 32:50.080
together and the result is a mythology

32:50.080 --> 32:51.520
that we're supposed to teach our kids,

32:51.520 --> 32:53.520
which is that RNA can pandemic

32:53.560 --> 32:55.840
and this was an easy one

32:55.840 --> 32:58.280
and the next one could be much worse.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.080
I don't even remember what the question was anymore,

33:00.080 --> 33:04.200
holy cow, Wolfgang, can I just say

33:04.200 --> 33:09.040
that you probably saved my life and the life of my family

33:09.040 --> 33:11.360
because you spoke out in 2020,

33:11.360 --> 33:15.680
you were the first guy I saw your work in 2009,

33:15.680 --> 33:20.600
is heroic, I also heard a presentation by Mark von Braunst,

33:20.600 --> 33:22.560
the guy from Belgium a few years later

33:22.560 --> 33:24.760
where he trashed you and said that,

33:24.760 --> 33:28.120
oh, he was a terrible guy for speaking out in 2009

33:28.120 --> 33:32.440
and I just can't thank you enough

33:32.440 --> 33:35.960
for the rest of the earth for having done what you did

33:35.960 --> 33:38.800
and I hope I'm doing a little bit

33:38.800 --> 33:41.680
of justice to your work

33:41.680 --> 33:44.160
because I'm really only inspired by you

33:44.160 --> 33:47.080
and Mike Eden and a couple other heroes, seriously.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.680
I'm so much fascinated because you know the details

33:50.680 --> 33:53.800
and you know the many people who know many details

33:53.800 --> 33:57.280
and you have an overview of all those specialists

33:57.280 --> 34:00.680
you have met and you know how they think

34:00.680 --> 34:02.280
and it's great for me.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.680
I'm just a practitioner.

34:04.680 --> 34:08.560
I'm just someone having being responsible for human lives

34:08.560 --> 34:13.400
as a public health guy who wanted to do the best he can

34:13.400 --> 34:15.720
and I'm a critical man

34:15.720 --> 34:20.720
and this is the only, you know this,

34:20.720 --> 34:26.120
when we enter this region of molecules,

34:26.120 --> 34:28.600
when we start to explain what we experience

34:28.600 --> 34:33.000
and what life is concentrated on molecules,

34:33.000 --> 34:36.480
I get lost, I get really lost

34:36.480 --> 34:39.800
and I go back and I say, what can we observe?

34:39.800 --> 34:40.920
What's happening?

34:40.920 --> 34:42.800
How long, what is the virus?

34:42.800 --> 34:45.680
Did they exist 100 years ago already?

34:45.680 --> 34:48.960
What function does viruses have in life

34:48.960 --> 34:51.840
and life is a very, very perfect thing?

34:51.840 --> 34:55.440
I'm a fan of Maturama, you know him, I think.

34:55.440 --> 34:59.680
Yes, and so I know about this communication process

34:59.680 --> 35:02.080
is in life theoretically.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.680
I'm not interested in the details of molecules.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.480
I cannot manage, it's too much

35:08.480 --> 35:12.840
but I think there is, life is so much more

35:12.840 --> 35:16.280
I think there is, life is so much more clever

35:16.280 --> 35:20.920
than only human beings can be.

35:20.920 --> 35:24.920
So we, you said something very, very important for me,

35:24.920 --> 35:26.960
this was a gift already.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.080
You said the in irreducible complexity of life,

35:30.080 --> 35:31.160
this is what you said.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.720
And I think this is a great word.

35:34.720 --> 35:39.720
And if you think this irreducibility of complexity,

35:40.720 --> 35:45.480
we just have to step back and have to,

35:45.480 --> 35:49.040
why do we, what do we need for having a good life?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.080
What do we need?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.920
Do we need all those details?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.680
Can we have a manage?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.360
What is with artificial intelligence?

36:00.760 --> 36:03.680
It's not artificial, it's stunned by man,

36:03.680 --> 36:04.960
this is artificial.

36:06.120 --> 36:09.000
And this, those weak part of biology,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.840
like we are human beings,

36:10.840 --> 36:14.560
it's a very small part of biology, we live.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.280
When I look out of the window, there is,

36:16.280 --> 36:18.240
there is the sea, there is the trees,

36:18.240 --> 36:22.760
there is so many living varieties,

36:22.760 --> 36:25.400
I will never catch, I will never understand.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.600
And we just go to work, we just learn something,

36:30.600 --> 36:34.320
we use this something, we have our attention in,

36:35.320 --> 36:40.320
this makes me very, take back my mind,

36:41.200 --> 36:44.520
I don't know, you, how do you say it?

36:44.520 --> 36:48.320
I'm cautious that I don't know so much,

36:49.240 --> 36:54.000
but I know there is something very well functioning.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.520
And when we think we can make it better,

36:55.520 --> 36:57.440
we do many mistakes for sure.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.880
Oh yes, and I think that's a perfect segue

36:59.880 --> 37:01.680
into what I was gonna say is that,

37:01.680 --> 37:05.280
I've been trying to come up with a few messages

37:05.280 --> 37:08.080
that non-biologists can understand,

37:08.080 --> 37:11.000
and one of the ones that I think is resonating

37:11.000 --> 37:15.120
with a lot of people right now is intramuscular injection

37:15.120 --> 37:17.440
of any combination of substances,

37:17.440 --> 37:21.040
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.360
And the reason why I love that phrase so much

37:23.360 --> 37:28.200
is because it gets back to the idea of what they are implying

37:28.200 --> 37:30.360
when they say that they can give, you know,

37:30.360 --> 37:34.080
30 injections to my kid before age six months.

37:34.080 --> 37:37.960
And they are implying that this incredibly complex,

37:37.960 --> 37:42.280
irreducibly complex system, that is the immune system,

37:42.280 --> 37:44.800
has sufficiently understood that they can put

37:44.800 --> 37:48.280
a combination of things in the muscle of your child

37:48.280 --> 37:49.800
to augment that system.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.120
And that is the level of audacity there,

37:54.120 --> 37:56.280
and arrogance is really extraordinary,

37:56.280 --> 37:58.280
but that's really where we are right now.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.360
And then the worst part is,

38:00.360 --> 38:03.160
is that it's now not even a combination of substances,

38:03.160 --> 38:05.640
but it's an actual genetic signal.

38:05.640 --> 38:10.640
And in a toxic envelope that we have even had the audacity

38:10.920 --> 38:13.200
to say is relatively equivalent

38:13.200 --> 38:16.160
to the previous combinations of terrible substances

38:16.160 --> 38:17.600
that we've been injecting,

38:17.600 --> 38:20.120
when in reality it's nowhere near equivalent.

38:20.120 --> 38:25.120
And in fact, it probably makes these previous concoctions

38:25.600 --> 38:27.440
look relatively benign,

38:27.440 --> 38:29.960
because they are just, you know, some heavy metals

38:29.960 --> 38:32.080
or some toxins that your body has challenged

38:32.080 --> 38:34.560
and your immune system is confused by.

38:34.560 --> 38:39.560
But this, where you start to make your biology behave

38:40.560 --> 38:44.640
differently and really potentially confuse your immune system,

38:44.640 --> 38:47.440
that I don't think the immune system is ever confused

38:47.440 --> 38:49.480
by an intramuscular injection of aluminum

38:49.480 --> 38:51.760
plus some proteins that all that crap

38:51.760 --> 38:53.320
is not supposed to be here.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.360
But once you've transfected random cells in your body

38:57.360 --> 38:59.520
to express a protein,

38:59.520 --> 39:02.360
it becomes a very much more, in my humble opinion,

39:02.360 --> 39:05.400
diabolical signal that is much more challenging

39:05.400 --> 39:08.960
for the immune system to sort out without making a mistake.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.520
And this is...

39:10.520 --> 39:13.400
I was so much interested when I was working

39:13.400 --> 39:18.400
with a group of biologists or human genetic geneticists

39:18.840 --> 39:20.760
genetic geneticists,

39:20.760 --> 39:25.680
and they were advising people with inborn defects,

39:25.680 --> 39:27.160
genetic defects.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.360
So they are the children that cannot produce certain proteins

39:30.360 --> 39:31.840
they need for their life,

39:31.840 --> 39:35.360
and they tried to genetically modify those children

39:35.360 --> 39:38.920
so that they can build the protein they needed.

39:38.920 --> 39:42.000
And they found out that after two years

39:42.000 --> 39:44.840
or after some time, they...

39:44.840 --> 39:48.280
Before they started producing the protein, they needed.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.560
It was okay, but after some time,

39:50.560 --> 39:53.000
after some months or some years,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.640
this process was stopped again.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.360
It just didn't work anymore.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.400
So there must be something within the human being

40:00.400 --> 40:03.300
they tried to treat, which repaired.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.360
There must be some plan of this human being

40:06.360 --> 40:09.080
how it was born.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.960
It said, no, this doesn't fit to me.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.960
This is a strange thing, and erase it again.

40:14.960 --> 40:19.560
So my hope is, when they do this genetic operation now

40:19.560 --> 40:21.920
with billions of people,

40:21.920 --> 40:24.400
that after two or three years,

40:24.400 --> 40:26.920
the bodies will have, if they survive it,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.200
the bodies may repair it in many, many cases.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.160
I don't know it, but I think this is a chance.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.000
We can...

40:35.000 --> 40:36.640
This is some hope also.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.320
We can wait for it.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.920
Yeah, I am cautiously optimistic myself.

40:43.920 --> 40:46.520
I'm also cautiously optimistic that the people

40:46.520 --> 40:49.320
that did this who were aware,

40:50.480 --> 40:54.000
at least vaguely aware of the potential advantage

40:54.000 --> 40:56.800
they could gain if they put some placebo doses out there,

40:56.800 --> 41:01.600
so that the populace would be fooled into believing

41:01.600 --> 41:04.360
that the safety was higher than it was.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.680
And so I think there are a number of possible ways

41:07.680 --> 41:10.120
that this technology,

41:10.120 --> 41:11.840
and I do think that's one of the things

41:11.840 --> 41:15.600
we have to acknowledge is that there was a concerted effort

41:15.600 --> 41:20.040
to bamboozle much of the free world

41:20.040 --> 41:22.560
into believing that transfection has been proven

41:22.560 --> 41:25.400
to be useful, and that now we just have to figure out

41:25.400 --> 41:28.080
what protein and how exactly to do it.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.040
Maybe we need a better lip and nanoparticle,

41:30.040 --> 41:32.600
or maybe we need to inhale some of these things,

41:32.600 --> 41:37.560
but the basic methodology is on TV already checked out

41:37.560 --> 41:38.960
and is already a miracle.

41:38.960 --> 41:43.240
And this, I think, is so much of the goal here,

41:43.240 --> 41:45.520
is to get people to accept this.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.680
And then maybe the old adage

41:49.680 --> 41:52.000
that all of these people have been saying for 20 years

41:52.000 --> 41:54.240
that mice lie and monkeys deceive,

41:54.240 --> 41:57.000
and the only thing that tells you the truth are humans,

41:57.000 --> 42:01.960
maybe this is part of a move toward getting people to accept

42:01.960 --> 42:04.600
that the only way we're gonna make personalized medicine

42:04.600 --> 42:06.680
is to use you as a guinea pig.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.880
And so there's so many frightening aspects of this

42:11.880 --> 42:15.080
that, again, assume that we've conquered

42:15.080 --> 42:18.160
the irreducible complexity of biology,

42:18.160 --> 42:19.440
that we've figured it all out,

42:19.440 --> 42:23.120
that we're just a few years away from having the data set

42:23.120 --> 42:27.320
to put into the AI, and then the AI will spit out the answer.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.280
And this is all an illusion.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.520
It's all an illusion that they've told rich people

42:32.520 --> 42:36.840
and they've told bureaucrats that the cheaper

42:36.840 --> 42:39.840
that we can make DNA and the cheaper it is to sequence it

42:39.840 --> 42:43.080
is just the same as the easier it's gonna be

42:43.080 --> 42:44.520
that we're gonna understand it.

42:44.520 --> 42:48.320
And that's just not, they're not equivalent things.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.480
That we can make DNA cheaper.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.400
It doesn't mean we understand what we're making

42:52.400 --> 42:56.040
or how it contributes to the pattern integrity of life.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.600
And so that still is this thing

42:58.600 --> 43:01.600
that we're telling our college kids

43:01.600 --> 43:03.560
and we're telling our high school kids

43:03.560 --> 43:06.000
that we have this mastery that we don't have

43:06.000 --> 43:08.400
and that we have this understanding that we don't have

43:08.400 --> 43:13.400
and we're robbing them of this reverence for life.

43:14.720 --> 43:18.040
We're robbing them of this reverence for the living world

43:18.040 --> 43:21.200
and instead replacing it with this arrogance

43:21.200 --> 43:24.360
and with this, it's terrible.

43:24.360 --> 43:27.160
I really see it as a fundamental attack

43:27.160 --> 43:28.580
on who we are as humanity.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.540
I think there may be, there are those people

43:31.540 --> 43:34.020
who finance all this and you say,

43:34.020 --> 43:36.020
yes, I need what you do.

43:36.020 --> 43:41.020
I take it and I use it in seven billion people.

43:42.300 --> 43:44.020
Those people, why do they do that?

43:45.300 --> 43:48.540
They are part of biology too.

43:48.540 --> 43:50.220
Yeah, it's hard to say.

43:50.220 --> 43:52.340
I mean, I think number one, we have to admit

43:52.340 --> 43:55.260
that there gotta be a number of unwitting participants

43:55.260 --> 43:58.260
because I was an unwitting participant in 2020.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.420
I still, when you and Mike Eden were saying

44:01.420 --> 44:03.860
that, you know, whatever these are,

44:03.860 --> 44:06.020
the variants are probably baloney

44:06.020 --> 44:08.500
and there were lots of signals like this

44:08.500 --> 44:10.900
when we were working before.

44:10.900 --> 44:14.540
I still was fighting for this idea that no,

44:14.540 --> 44:17.540
but a laboratory virus could have heretofore unseen possibilities

44:24.340 --> 44:27.740
and laboratory virus could be much more infectious

44:27.740 --> 44:30.100
because it's got a fear and cleavage site.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.260
And so I was totally fooled.

44:32.260 --> 44:34.980
I totally bought in to the idea

44:34.980 --> 44:36.420
that they were covering something up

44:36.420 --> 44:39.460
and that because it was a laboratory virus

44:39.460 --> 44:42.540
that it could potentially have biology that wasn't natural

44:42.540 --> 44:46.980
and that idea sucked me in and sucked a lot of people in.

44:46.980 --> 44:48.500
I think that was intentional

44:48.500 --> 44:51.660
because that scared people into taking something

44:51.660 --> 44:53.780
that they otherwise would have never taken.

44:53.780 --> 44:56.260
And here we are three years later

44:56.340 --> 44:58.300
and I'm really late to the party.

44:58.300 --> 45:01.260
Like you and Mike had seen through it already in 2020.

45:01.260 --> 45:04.420
And I, it's not so difficult to see it.

45:04.420 --> 45:08.100
When you have a, I was very impressed by a map

45:08.100 --> 45:11.460
where I could see it 24 hours short

45:11.460 --> 45:14.380
where all the airplanes were yellow points

45:14.380 --> 45:18.900
driving around the world with 10 million passengers a day.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.100
Yes.

45:20.100 --> 45:22.980
With all their viruses on their body, in their body,

45:22.980 --> 45:25.740
everywhere traveling around 10 billion a day.

45:25.740 --> 45:26.940
Yes.

45:26.940 --> 45:30.020
And spreading everything of every variation of life,

45:30.020 --> 45:33.700
spreading that can live with human beings, spreading each day.

45:34.740 --> 45:36.380
And I was, I was thinking of that.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.460
And then I was thinking, Wuhan,

45:39.460 --> 45:41.100
there was such a high,

45:41.100 --> 45:46.100
a legal thing there in Guangdong, in Guangdong in the SARS-1.

45:47.180 --> 45:49.460
I was thinking, where has it disappeared?

45:49.460 --> 45:51.980
Why does it disappear so quickly?

45:51.980 --> 45:55.140
And with all those passengers traveling around the world

45:55.140 --> 45:56.940
and the virus is so contagious

45:56.940 --> 45:58.860
and how can this be?

45:58.860 --> 46:00.740
And we forgot SARS.

46:00.740 --> 46:05.100
SARS didn't exist between 2005 and 2020.

46:06.700 --> 46:07.980
It wasn't that wide.

46:07.980 --> 46:09.260
This cannot be.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.700
So it's such easy thoughts, you know?

46:12.700 --> 46:14.020
It's so easy.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.460
You don't have to know about molecular things.

46:17.460 --> 46:20.100
You just have to, you just have to think,

46:20.100 --> 46:22.660
well, if there are viruses and they go around the world,

46:22.660 --> 46:24.500
they change every year a little bit.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.540
We have the flu on Australia.

46:26.540 --> 46:29.580
When I was with a swine flu,

46:29.580 --> 46:32.780
my first call was to Australia, to a colleague in Australia.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.500
How is it whether you do you have more cases than usual?

46:35.500 --> 46:36.540
You should know.

46:36.540 --> 46:38.380
So I knew what was going on.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.780
It is, it's really easy

46:40.780 --> 46:42.940
because when you know how those,

46:42.940 --> 46:45.180
how those entities, those biological entities,

46:45.180 --> 46:47.060
where they live, how they live normally,

46:47.060 --> 46:50.620
you have recognized them and you can observe them.

46:50.620 --> 46:53.340
And then you see the effects and you can,

46:53.740 --> 46:58.020
you don't need molecules to understand.

46:58.020 --> 47:02.580
And when you're from your experience as a doctor,

47:02.580 --> 47:06.340
how often in his, when you were practicing,

47:06.340 --> 47:10.860
how often did you actually make a molecular

47:10.860 --> 47:15.340
or some kind of confirmation with a diagnostic

47:15.340 --> 47:17.020
that you had a particular virus?

47:17.020 --> 47:19.380
Or were you always just treating?

47:19.380 --> 47:20.700
No, there was only flu.

47:20.700 --> 47:22.100
Yeah, okay.

47:22.180 --> 47:25.660
But there was one, I started doing some nonsense

47:25.660 --> 47:28.420
when I started making the H-test, HIV test.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.780
Because we were frightened.

47:31.780 --> 47:32.940
I was also frightened.

47:32.940 --> 47:35.540
I thought there was something very serious to move on.

47:35.540 --> 47:39.100
And they gave me the HIV test in my ward

47:39.100 --> 47:41.300
and they said, you can use it.

47:41.300 --> 47:43.980
And I used it and I found some positive cases.

47:45.300 --> 47:46.580
But they were all healthy.

47:48.420 --> 47:51.300
And I never saw someone with an immune deficiency before

47:51.340 --> 47:56.340
in my region, my whole region where I used to practice.

47:57.340 --> 47:58.180
Never.

47:58.180 --> 47:59.620
No, I never got it.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.420
No, I didn't.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.180
And suddenly there should be something very new.

48:04.180 --> 48:08.980
So, but I was trapped then with this big propaganda HIV.

48:08.980 --> 48:10.900
And I'm very sorry.

48:10.900 --> 48:14.060
I did many wrong things because of that.

48:14.060 --> 48:18.260
And I understood, many years later,

48:18.260 --> 48:20.540
many years later I understood

48:20.580 --> 48:22.380
that they made this test

48:22.380 --> 48:26.340
and they produced those cases as they always do cases.

48:26.340 --> 48:27.420
Isn't it fascinating?

48:27.420 --> 48:29.460
Isn't that test an antibody test?

48:29.460 --> 48:32.100
So actually for AIDS, it's an antibody test,

48:32.100 --> 48:34.740
which is extraordinary because now they sold us antibodies

48:34.740 --> 48:35.740
as immunity.

48:37.980 --> 48:39.420
It's extraordinary.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.180
Yes.

48:42.180 --> 48:45.260
And it's very, you know what we have to do?

48:45.260 --> 48:47.940
We have to change the education of doctors.

48:48.780 --> 48:50.260
Yeah.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.380
I mean, we do.

48:52.380 --> 48:53.900
We need to teach them immunology.

48:53.900 --> 48:56.940
We need to teach them how the immune system works

48:56.940 --> 48:58.940
so that they come to this conclusion on their own.

48:58.940 --> 49:04.100
If you, if you really, I mean, I have given a number

49:04.100 --> 49:09.100
of what I consider to be very broad stroke immune lectures

49:10.460 --> 49:12.700
that people have said that this is just the best lecture

49:12.700 --> 49:15.020
I've ever heard because I've explained the immune system

49:15.100 --> 49:20.100
in a way that that that that explains its organization.

49:20.580 --> 49:25.420
And I think the one of the things that I stress a lot

49:25.420 --> 49:27.300
is that the immune system is organized

49:27.300 --> 49:31.620
from the inside out and it's designed to to maintain a barrier

49:31.620 --> 49:35.460
between the inside of your body and the outside world.

49:35.460 --> 49:39.940
And so the immune system is used to meeting challenges

49:39.940 --> 49:41.260
on that barrier.

49:41.260 --> 49:46.260
And so in history, if any of these previous immunizations

49:46.420 --> 49:49.660
have worked, they have worked because they've immunized

49:49.660 --> 49:53.060
at a barrier, oral vaccines are at a barrier, you know,

49:53.060 --> 49:56.140
variation with smallpox was at a barrier.

49:56.140 --> 49:59.060
So you were interacting with the immune system

49:59.060 --> 50:01.500
and from the direction in which it expects

50:01.500 --> 50:05.580
to be interacted with and with an intramuscular injection,

50:05.580 --> 50:08.420
you are taking a signal and putting it

50:08.420 --> 50:11.140
where the immune system least likely to find it.

50:11.140 --> 50:14.220
And so it's extraordinary how absurd it is

50:14.220 --> 50:19.060
that we've moved through this immunization of evolution

50:19.060 --> 50:21.100
and gotten worse and worse.

50:21.100 --> 50:23.500
This is what I said in this too.

50:23.500 --> 50:27.580
But you know this, when it started with the swine flu also,

50:27.580 --> 50:31.020
they started thinking of giving the flu shot,

50:31.020 --> 50:33.500
not a flow shot, but giving the spray.

50:33.500 --> 50:34.340
Oh yeah.

50:35.340 --> 50:39.300
Because they were recognizing that this could be a way

50:39.300 --> 50:42.180
they could sell the same nonsense before.

50:42.180 --> 50:47.180
But what they didn't deal with is there's so much competition

50:48.020 --> 50:52.820
between those informations we get.

50:52.820 --> 50:57.820
Our immune system has to find out what is important,

50:58.300 --> 50:59.540
what is not important.

51:00.420 --> 51:01.620
So there has to be,

51:01.620 --> 51:05.220
because there's a limited capacity of immune reaction.

51:06.220 --> 51:09.620
And so you have to see our immune system has to select.

51:09.620 --> 51:13.980
There's a really interesting phenomenon that occurred.

51:13.980 --> 51:15.980
I think you'd find really fascinating as well,

51:15.980 --> 51:19.260
that in the early 2000s or late 90s,

51:19.260 --> 51:24.420
there were two basic schools of thought of immunology

51:24.420 --> 51:26.420
that were funded by the NIH in America.

51:26.420 --> 51:31.620
The one was pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

51:31.700 --> 51:35.860
And the other one was damage-associated molecular patterns.

51:35.860 --> 51:38.700
And now the difference between these two big theories

51:38.700 --> 51:39.540
is really cool.

51:39.540 --> 51:42.460
One, the pathogen-associated molecular patterns

51:42.460 --> 51:45.460
is a theory where the immune system tries to make

51:45.460 --> 51:47.900
a unique set of memories for every pathogen

51:47.900 --> 51:49.580
that it comes in contact with.

51:49.580 --> 51:52.540
The other one, damage-associated molecular patterns,

51:52.540 --> 51:55.540
was the idea that the immune system tries to generalize

51:55.540 --> 52:00.060
across challenges to find the molecular motifs

52:00.060 --> 52:01.300
that are most dangerous.

52:01.300 --> 52:04.380
Usually hydrophobic ones are charged motifs.

52:04.380 --> 52:09.380
And so this theory then suggested that in one case,

52:09.460 --> 52:12.100
the immune system is just making a profile

52:12.100 --> 52:13.860
of the new things that it finds.

52:13.860 --> 52:14.980
And in the other case,

52:14.980 --> 52:18.460
it's trying to generalize across molecular signals,

52:18.460 --> 52:22.300
and then essentially building a minimum amount of memory.

52:22.300 --> 52:25.700
And I think there's so much of our understanding

52:25.700 --> 52:27.540
of the immune system that really suggests

52:27.540 --> 52:31.380
that minimizing the reaction to anything is ideal.

52:31.380 --> 52:35.620
And overreaction is the heart of everything going wrong.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.100
And so interestingly enough,

52:38.100 --> 52:40.180
we were talking about this an hour ago,

52:40.180 --> 52:43.700
the funding for damage-associated molecular pattern

52:43.700 --> 52:45.380
investigation is gone.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.380
It disappeared in 2005.

52:47.380 --> 52:50.380
There is no funding of that idea anymore.

52:50.380 --> 52:53.540
It is exclusively pathogen-associated molecular patterns

52:53.540 --> 52:56.220
or specific memory, which of course means

52:56.220 --> 52:59.780
that you need specific vaccines for every specific challenge.

52:59.780 --> 53:02.140
And that's the extraordinary moment.

53:02.140 --> 53:04.340
You can have a patent on viruses.

53:04.340 --> 53:08.940
You can have a patent on the choice of your immune system.

53:11.020 --> 53:11.860
Yeah.

53:12.700 --> 53:13.820
It's extraordinary, man,

53:13.820 --> 53:17.820
because I think this has exposed a very big scam

53:17.820 --> 53:21.140
that we've all been under the enchantment of

53:21.140 --> 53:22.260
for a very long time.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.780
And so we can all just be very humble

53:24.780 --> 53:26.460
and say we didn't get it for a long time

53:26.460 --> 53:28.500
and just pull ourselves out.

53:28.500 --> 53:31.860
Our discussion that reminds me of something

53:31.860 --> 53:34.740
when we were discussing about the transportation law

53:34.740 --> 53:38.340
in Germany, there were always those people who said,

53:38.340 --> 53:40.580
the brain, this is our identity.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.340
This is what we are, the brain.

53:44.500 --> 53:46.260
They said, if the brain is dead,

53:46.260 --> 53:49.820
you can take everything because then the guy is dead.

53:49.820 --> 53:52.300
And I always think, no, there's something more complicated,

53:52.300 --> 53:54.540
more identity, much more identity.

53:54.540 --> 53:59.300
What I am is much more my immune system than my brain.

54:02.100 --> 54:07.100
So this discussion, it has so many consequences.

54:08.220 --> 54:10.380
Consequences in regulation, in human,

54:10.380 --> 54:15.380
in what we think, what is the dignity of man.

54:17.900 --> 54:21.420
So all this values our society is based on,

54:21.420 --> 54:22.980
is based on pictures.

54:25.340 --> 54:29.860
And this picture with the brain, in our thoughts,

54:29.860 --> 54:34.380
is the thing which makes us the most.

54:34.380 --> 54:36.420
And there is this other thing,

54:36.420 --> 54:37.940
which makes us much more humble

54:37.940 --> 54:39.660
because the immune system is something

54:39.660 --> 54:41.180
you find everywhere in nature.

54:44.180 --> 54:49.180
So it's a very good lesson we can learn now.

54:50.180 --> 54:54.180
How our values are shaped and how they shape our culture

54:54.180 --> 54:56.180
and our thinking, our living together,

54:56.180 --> 54:59.180
and our respecting and respecting nature,

54:59.180 --> 55:00.180
which is around us.

55:00.180 --> 55:04.180
So I think there is, it's a big chance now

55:04.180 --> 55:06.180
for developing new ideas.

55:06.180 --> 55:08.180
I totally agree.

55:08.180 --> 55:11.180
If the immune system functions well,

55:11.180 --> 55:14.180
maybe the brain is also part of an immune system

55:14.180 --> 55:18.180
like that enables you to understand

55:18.180 --> 55:21.180
infiltration via deception.

55:21.180 --> 55:23.180
Because if your thoughts function,

55:23.180 --> 55:25.180
then you understand,

55:25.180 --> 55:27.180
well, this is not really what I should believe.

55:27.180 --> 55:30.180
This is bad for me, for my whole body.

55:30.180 --> 55:31.180
I mean, what we just,

55:31.180 --> 55:34.180
but people came to see during the crisis.

55:34.180 --> 55:36.180
I have one question.

55:36.180 --> 55:40.180
Irreusable complexity of life is reduced

55:40.180 --> 55:43.180
by the very low possibilities

55:43.180 --> 55:46.180
that human brain has to understand all this.

55:47.180 --> 55:48.180
Yeah.

55:48.180 --> 55:49.180
Yeah.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.180
That's a really great question.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.180
It's a really great way to put it.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.180
Can I ask you, like, I mean,

55:53.180 --> 55:57.180
I don't know if you're aware of the work of Dr. Sabina Steber.

55:57.180 --> 55:59.180
She's been in the committee several times

55:59.180 --> 56:02.180
and she's been investigating like everything

56:02.180 --> 56:05.180
that's basically also put into the vaccines

56:05.180 --> 56:07.180
and what they know,

56:07.180 --> 56:11.180
what they knew about like the toxic results

56:11.180 --> 56:14.180
or like the toxic effects that it might have, you know?

56:14.180 --> 56:16.180
And like, for instance, in Germany,

56:16.180 --> 56:18.180
we found out that our,

56:18.180 --> 56:23.180
basically the authority that oversees the, you know,

56:23.180 --> 56:27.180
the market release and so on of the vaccines,

56:27.180 --> 56:30.180
the head of that authority, you know,

56:30.180 --> 56:34.180
has actually published on a variety of issues

56:34.180 --> 56:38.180
that we now find to be really damaging for people, you know,

56:38.180 --> 56:40.180
from what we can see.

56:40.180 --> 56:43.180
And so she has, she has said, you know,

56:43.180 --> 56:48.180
it's kind of interesting because there's so many aspects put into these vaccines,

56:48.180 --> 56:50.180
like from, or like the so-called vaccines,

56:50.180 --> 56:54.180
like from all kinds of angles, like the nano lab lipids and, you know,

56:54.180 --> 56:59.180
whatever these, these DNA aspects and so on, you know?

56:59.180 --> 57:00.180
It's amazing.

57:00.180 --> 57:02.180
And it seems that it's only, I mean,

57:02.180 --> 57:08.180
you really have to put together such a cocktail of toxic aspects, you know,

57:08.180 --> 57:09.180
that it's amazing.

57:09.180 --> 57:10.180
This cannot be coincidence.

57:10.180 --> 57:14.180
And this must have been worked on by, you know,

57:14.180 --> 57:17.180
maybe just a few people, very specialized people,

57:17.180 --> 57:21.180
who could oversee what was, what's going to come from that.

57:21.180 --> 57:23.180
Maybe they do not have the full picture.

57:23.180 --> 57:28.180
But I mean, they could see from a variety of studies that are already out there,

57:28.180 --> 57:33.180
that there's, it's like a cocktail of horror, basically.

57:33.180 --> 57:36.180
I mean, would you, would you share that opinion?

57:36.180 --> 57:42.180
I would, I would share a little bit of expanded opinion in the sense that

57:42.180 --> 57:47.180
I think that this, this operation was so diabolical,

57:47.180 --> 57:53.180
that they have, they have planned already from the very beginning

57:53.180 --> 57:59.180
to tell us a biological narrative about a gain-of-function virus

57:59.180 --> 58:03.180
that actually includes specifically a gain-of-function protein

58:03.180 --> 58:07.180
with lots of little intricate things that have been inserted in it by really

58:07.180 --> 58:10.180
master chefs of, of virology.

58:10.180 --> 58:15.180
And that protein is what we serendipitously decided to

58:15.180 --> 58:17.180
transfect into everyone's body.

58:17.180 --> 58:21.180
And so this story was not just by accident.

58:21.180 --> 58:27.180
This story allows the confounding of the biological effects of the spike protein

58:27.180 --> 58:30.180
with the biological effects of transfection.

58:30.180 --> 58:34.180
And I think more than anything, we need to understand that biologically,

58:34.180 --> 58:39.180
this is a disingenuous connection that was put there on purpose,

58:39.180 --> 58:44.180
so that they would have a whole series of, of things that we could argue about,

58:44.180 --> 58:48.180
a very limited but lively spectrum of debate where,

58:48.180 --> 58:50.180
I'm sure it's the lipid nanoparticles.

58:50.180 --> 58:52.180
And if we just fix those, it would be better.

58:52.180 --> 58:56.180
I'm sure it's the spike protein, the spike protein was gain-of-function.

58:56.180 --> 58:58.180
And so the spike protein is causing all of this.

58:58.180 --> 59:00.180
And that, that was intentional.

59:00.180 --> 59:02.180
That confounding was intentional.

59:02.180 --> 59:09.180
And so this now discussion of were there, were there, uh, graphene particles,

59:09.180 --> 59:14.180
or is the lipid nanoparticle the problem, or is the DNA contamination the problem?

59:14.180 --> 59:18.180
I assure you that if the lipid nanoparticles were perfect

59:18.180 --> 59:24.180
and the spike protein was perfect and everything was made to the finest of standards,

59:24.180 --> 59:28.180
transfection would still be wholly inappropriate for healthy humans.

59:28.180 --> 59:29.180
That's where we are.

59:29.180 --> 59:33.180
And so we're being, they're shuffling all these things on the table

59:33.180 --> 59:38.180
to try and make us choose which was the, what's responsible when in reality,

59:38.180 --> 59:42.180
as you said, they've known from the very beginning that they couldn't get the results

59:42.180 --> 59:44.180
that they said they were going to get.

59:44.180 --> 59:50.180
Peter Cullis, the man who invented and, and whose research has developed

59:50.180 --> 59:55.180
these lipid nanoparticles was accepting award, an award all across Canada

59:55.180 --> 59:57.180
called the Gardineer Award.

59:57.180 --> 59:59.180
It's like a pre-noble prize award.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:03.180
And he was touring Canada, giving lectures about the lipid nanoparticles

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:06.180
and about how exciting it was that there was soon going to be a Nobel Prize

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.180
and maybe they would get it.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.180
And he admitted that he killed the career of five postdocs

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:18.180
that he tried to get them to figure out how to target the lipid nanoparticles

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.180
to a particular place in the body.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.180
And five postdocs never figured it out.

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:28.180
And the fifth one insisted that she do something else otherwise she was going to quit.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.180
And he made a joke about that on stage in 2022,

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.180
knowing that a billion people had been injected with a lipid nanoparticle

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:41.180
that they were told would stay in the muscle and go disappear in a few weeks.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:47.180
That's extraordinary because they burnt, they burnt Byron Bridal's career

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.180
and he revealed that information from a FOIA request from Japan.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.180
They burnt his career only a year and a half later

01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:00.180
to have the inventor of the frickin' technology go onstage and say it all out.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.180
And they didn't burn his career.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.180
They didn't throw him out of the university for admitting it.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.180
But he admitted it on stage.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.180
That's where we are.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.180
It's extraordinary. It is really extraordinary.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:17.180
It's all there for the learning and the knowing.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180
And it's now just a question of getting people to raise their chin off of their desk

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:28.180
and put their phone down and understand that we have really been deceived in a major way.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:33.180
And I really think it's important to understand that their goal is for us to teach this to our children.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.180
They don't care about us.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.180
We have to understand that this goes already for 50 years.

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.180
Yes, absolutely it does.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.180
And only we can save our children because if we don't,

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:49.180
our children will grow up having experienced this experience to this pandemic

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.180
and they're done forever.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.180
It's really a disaster.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.180
They call the whole thing pandemic preparedness.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.180
And they prepared what they call a pandemic.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:07.180
So it's sadistic.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:15.180
The double meaning of pandemic preparedness is very interesting.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.180
Yeah.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:20.180
Can I ask you like in the beginning you said that you'd been after you spoke out

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.180
and then had these problems with the university and so on.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:29.180
You said you were visited by people who you consider now to be like medallists.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.180
I mean, what kind of experience did you make?

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:36.180
They tried to convince you to maybe give up your train of thought.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.180
Yes.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.180
Exactly.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.180
So it mainly happened in 2021.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:49.180
So I was a member of this loose organization called Drastic,

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.180
which was given credit for like solving the lab leak puzzle on Twitter in 2020.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:03:00.180
And that group of people is still largely an anonymous group of medlers who refused,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.180
literally refused.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:05.180
So I'm a member from the very beginning.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:11.180
I was the guy who I actually put my name and reviewed several of these papers,

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:15.180
which got published about the fear and cleavage site and thought I was doing a heroic act

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:21.180
by reviewing these papers and getting the lab leak hypothesis out there into public.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.180
And so I was a bit taken hookline and sinker by these people.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:35.180
But Drastic at some point refused, absolutely refused to discuss the idea that this

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.180
transfection to a spike protein could be a disaster.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:43.180
That could be actually the real reason why this whole mythology was spun up to begin

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.180
with.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.180
When I started saying that, Drastic split into two groups and both of those groups threw

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.180
me out.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.180
And so after that happened, interestingly enough, and this is where it gets really

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.180
sketchy.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:59.180
And I hope you'll know a little bit of these details so that you'll see why it's so important.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:09.180
About two or three months later was when the first hints of the diffuse proposal leak started

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.180
to appear.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:15.180
And at some moment, a member of Drastic was given a copy of the diffuse proposal.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:22.180
Now the diffuse proposal is supposedly a grant proposal that was written in 2017 and submitted

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:29.780
by EcoHealth Alliance, the notorious gain of function funders in the United States.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.780
They submitted this grant to DARPA in 2019 apparently.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:41.060
And in this grant, curiously enough, is described an experiment that in the cartoon would be

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:47.460
exactly how this pandemic would have started complete with bad coronaviruses that were

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:54.020
molecularly altered to insert a fear and cleavage site at the S1, S2 junction.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.180
And when this text was first shown to me, the very first thing that went off in my head

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:03.460
was, well, that's a convenient way of making it, making it real.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:07.620
Isn't that a very convenient way of making it real leak a grant proposal that never

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:08.620
got funded?

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:14.780
Well, I will tell you that when I ignored that grant proposal, eventually that was intolerable

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:23.300
and somebody came to my house and physically convinced me to join Drastic again and to

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.140
pursue the origin of the virus because they are hiding this lab leak.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.220
And so for a few more months, I was kind of in this hamster wheel again, trying to figure

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:39.300
out if this diffuse proposal was real, but in reality, I have now, I'm firmly on the

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.860
side of this being part of this worst case scenario narrative that they are trying to

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860
spin up.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:50.660
And in fact, the diffuse proposal is still being given wood for its fire.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.660
There are still people that are doing foyas on the diffuse proposal and still doing analysis

01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:00.300
of the experiments that were proposed in the diffuse proposal, all under the pretense that

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.140
this text, his further evidence that gain of function was happening, that they did it

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.140
and that they were arrogant about it, and that it will come again.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.980
And so this has always been about that.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.900
And so every person that has contacted me has been trying to keep me focused on the origin

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.020
and keep me off of transfection.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:24.220
And so after a while, that pattern just broke me and I just stopped paying attention.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.020
But it happened first for more than a year and a half.

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.180
Can you say something about the escape theory?

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:39.020
I just don't think it's it's I don't think that lab leaks and see and people getting

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.260
sick are not real.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:44.500
No, I mean, I mean, the escape theory when you when the virus escapes when you haven't

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.500
ever.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.500
Oh, yeah.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.500
Yeah.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.500
Yeah.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.540
So this is one of those things that I think is also part of the the illusion.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:55.540
So remember that one of the things that they convinced us of is that this virus wasn't

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.540
here before 2019 and then it was here in the end of 2019.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:07.220
So what that means from the perspective of the of the phylogenetic tree is that the

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.940
final phylogenetic tree started at a point and then it grew over the last five years from

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.700
one point all over the world, one point all over the world.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.900
Well, no other, no other points where viruses grow, right?

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.140
No other points from one.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.140
Yes.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.140
They can only grow from who?

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.140
Right.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.900
And so the interesting thing about that is is that it assumes that as you've said before

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.980
that there's no other signal in the background that could be mixed with this one, that there

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:35.060
is no other signal that we could have been monitoring in 2019 or 2018 that we weren't

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.740
monitoring because we weren't.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.140
We weren't doing any PCR surveillance.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.700
We weren't doing any sequence surveillance of any coronavirus.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.780
So as far as we know, there were 50 SARS viruses in circulation before the pandemic.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.540
And then they came up with a test and said, now this is evidence of spread.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:57.620
And so the important thing to for I think for us to now send as a message is that one

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:02.820
of the ways they trapped us in this was convincing us that arguing about what this

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.500
signal meant was so important.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:12.420
And so arguing about whether whether it means that there's novel spread or whether it means

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.620
it's a background signal that that discussion never occurred.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:20.060
The discussion that occurred was, are we using the right primers?

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.620
Are we overcycling these tests?

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:28.140
So the questions that we were primed to ask actually made us accept the fact that the

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.820
tests work had actually made us accept the fact that there was something to test for had

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:36.980
actually made us accept the fact that there was an emergency when in reality what we should

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.060
have been asking in the original is what would have happened if we use these tests six months

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.060
ago?

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.060
Would we find the same signal?

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.260
And if that's the case, then what are we all worried about?

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.500
But we never asked that question on purpose.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.740
They did it on purpose.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.100
They were very clever.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:57.380
You know that they make monitoring of our of the risks we live in while while just examining

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.100
the wastewater.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.500
And that's honestly that would be the easiest thing to spike ever.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.740
You could spike the wastewater with DNA of any signal you wanted and then claim, look,

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.940
there's Marburg in the sewer.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.820
I mean, it would be so easy to do it.

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:12.820
A joke.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.660
This is why they do it.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.980
And they invest a lot of money and all the cities in Germany, they all started.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:19.980
They all make this.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.220
They all follow this nonsense.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.940
They give a lot of money for this.

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.940
Yeah, wow.

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.580
I don't even know what to say.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.140
We have to be aware of new risks, they say.

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:33.740
And we have to have we have to monitor our sewer so so we can find out what's happening.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:39.900
Oh, I mean, this is really a very, very slippery slope to just declaring whatever they want

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.700
to declare whenever they want to declare.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:42.700
Yes.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.060
And Robert Koch Institute is one of the first who says it and you have to do it.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.060
We want to be safe.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.060
Oh, my.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.060
Oh, it's terrible.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.060
Yes.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:59.660
What I think is what's very interesting is that, you know, when you say there were also

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:07.060
certain stories or like trains of thought like presented with regards to the virus and

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:13.060
so on, there must have been someone thinking about how can we distract these people, you

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:19.020
know, like, how can we control also the scientific conversation, the discussion, you know,

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:23.020
like, I mean, as you said, like maybe with the, okay, maybe that was a coincidence with

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.020
the graphene idea.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:30.500
I don't know, you know, maybe was just someone looking for the wrong ingredients or something

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:34.660
or had like a no, but I think it's actually more likely, I think it's actually more likely

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.700
to be true because if there was graphene in one particular lot that somebody could find

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:44.780
and show videos of, and it wasn't in any other lot so that they could debunk this all

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:48.940
around the world, it's a perfect argument that gets nobody anywhere.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.300
And the longer you argue about it, the better.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.300
Yes.

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:57.900
And the next time you do something into the job with where you can find something in the

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:07.700
G5, with some, with your iPhone, you can try and the magnetic, the story with the magnetic

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.700
...

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.700
Absolutely.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.700
Yeah.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.140
All those stories where we were discussing, which we were discussing, they could have

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.460
thought it in advance, they could have installed all these stories to distract us from what

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.460
they do.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460
Absolutely.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:28.740
I think that also the effects and the dangers that I think are real of 5G have been purposely

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:34.060
confounded with the virus on purpose to try and, to try and again, get people to argue

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:39.180
about stuff that they can never figure out, instead of arguing about the very simple fact

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:43.980
that they are lying to us about a spreading risk, at the risk, additive pathogen.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.980
Yeah.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:50.860
And everything, those, everything which has, has a syllable smart in front, it's dangerous.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.780
Oh, well, they're going to get us with convenience, right?

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780
It's so convenient.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.020
You'll never have to, you'll never have to enter a password again, it'll just be a chip

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.460
under your skin.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.020
That's the, that's the convenience of it.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:10.900
I am, I am absolutely thrilled that we have so much connection here and that we see it this

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900
way.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.820
I, what is it like to be a guy who saw this in 2009?

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.620
You've been trapped in this little hell for, for 15 or 20 years where most of us are just

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.540
recently waking up.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.340
I only really figured it out in 2022 as well as I have.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:34.420
I gave my kids their vaccinations before they went to their new school in 2022 and then watched

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.900
the movie vaxxed and realized that, wow, no problem, I'm a little bit older than you.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.940
So I started a little bit before you.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.780
Yeah, I see.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.620
I mean, but it's, it must've been, I mean, I guess what I'm trying to get at is is that

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:52.940
when you spoke out in 2009, there wasn't this global awareness of anything.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:56.500
It was very easy for them to kind of hide you in the noise.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:00.620
And although I think locally it was important what you did, I don't think the story really

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:07.660
ever penetrated the, the media in America at all, whereas now this global thing has sort

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:14.420
of, I think made it possible in a way for, you know, people like me, I don't think I

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.860
would have been able to, to sustain speaking out in 2009 because there wouldn't have been

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.860
enough momentum.

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.860
There wouldn't have been enough feedback.

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.820
I would have felt like I was shouting into the breeze, whereas now, I mean, look, I get

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.740
to talk to you or I don't think in 2009 this would have even been possible.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.300
So that's also a thing to be hopeful about.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.020
So this is an advantage, you know.

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.020
Yeah.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:42.900
I talk to so many people I would never, never been the chance to talk to is so I'm so happy

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.100
to experience all this for myself.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.620
If I'm agristic, I learned so much in those last years.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.540
I never learned so much before.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:51.540
Yeah.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:52.540
I think it is really wonderful.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:58.220
I mean, that's definitely one of the, the more twisted things about this is, is that

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.820
it has been a superior learning experience indeed.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:07.700
I haven't loved biology as much as I've loved it in the last three years because I feel

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.620
like I'm actually, I'm actually doing it again.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.700
So that's really cool.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:16.580
I'm happy about that, but, but it's getting rough.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:23.180
I was working for Children's Health Defense for about, so I helped Bobby Kennedy with,

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.700
with his, with his book about the lab leak and I tried to get a little bit of this biology

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700
in there.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.860
There's some biology about how RNA can't pandemic in that book.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.220
Then after the book, I got hired by Children's Health Defense, but I was only working there

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:41.260
for six months before they laid me off again, presumably because of the things that I'm

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.260
still saying.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:48.100
It wasn't really clear exactly why, but it's been pretty disappointing because I thought

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.860
I had kind of a dream job and I'd figured it out and I'd got a better foundation under

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:57.180
me and I was going to push forward and then out of nowhere the first week of January,

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.660
they said they're going to part ways with me.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:03.700
So I'm, I'm cautiously optimistic that that means I'm over the target and then I'm teaching

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:10.500
what I need to teach, but my family and, and our future is a little bit less, less solid

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.980
ground than we were a month ago.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:18.260
So that's, that's unfortunate, but this is, this is high hope optimism to the 10th power

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.260
meeting you.

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:23.620
I mean, I don't, I know that you're a guy who doesn't see yourself that way, but from,

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:28.140
from my little life and my little corner of the world, you really are a giant among giants

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:32.700
and I can't thank you enough for, for talking to me.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:40.700
I guess that's, that's too much of a, you know, nothing, nothing, I speak Dutch.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.220
So I can understand that German.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:49.460
Okay, well, I mean, thanks so much for all the work and, you know, also your courage to

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:55.180
really, you know, speak out and, and not be distracted, like from, from all these, you

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:00.580
know, these, these, whatever they present as a narrative for like aspects of that.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.940
I have one last question.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:10.100
The disease X that is now kind of hovering in the, in the near side.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.580
That's also, I mean, in your point of view, I guess that's another story.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.300
Well, again, remember that I'm not suggesting to you that they can't make a lot of it.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:23.660
And so they can make a lot of, of an RNA and they could transfect hundreds or thousands

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:28.740
of people in any given place using any number of, of known methodologies of aerosolizing

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:32.500
the RNA or spraying it on people or droplets of it.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.780
I don't know how they would do it.

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:35.980
They, they, they, they, can you eat it?

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:36.980
You could eat it.

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:37.980
Maybe.

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:38.980
I don't know.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.980
But the point would be is that they can make this RNA, they can make this DNA in high

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.140
quantities and then put it in places.

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.860
Will it make people sick?

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860
Maybe.

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:48.860
Will it make PCR test positive?

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.860
Absolutely.

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.580
Will it make sequencing high fidelity?

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:52.580
Absolutely.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.580
They'd be able to find it in lots of places, absolutely.

01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:02.660
And so what I think we need to understand is that although an RNA molecule can't become

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:09.260
disease X on its own with standard molecular biological techniques used in pharmaceutical

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:14.340
companies all around the world, they could make enough of DNA and RNA to create the illusion

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.340
of that.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:16.340
And that's the dangerous part.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:21.220
They can make a protein that's highly immunogenic and they could, they could put that protein

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:25.300
into something and they could use a toxin to and then lie about it.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:30.340
Like there's lots of ways that they could make disease X show up that doesn't have anything

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:35.540
to do with an RNA molecule perpetuating itself for years.

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.780
That's, that's the biology we need to teach our kids because that's what disease X is.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.780
It's just an extension of this mythology.

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.140
Yeah, that's right.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.740
So we got to watch out.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.740
Yeah.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.220
Thanks so much for, for being with us today.

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:54.980
It's, yeah, it's been very inspirational also, I think on a lot of levels and I guess

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.740
we just have to continue speaking out about what's going on.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.740
I agree.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.260
If you could share the, if you could share the link when you have it, I would, I would

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.260
spread it out too.

01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.260
Yeah, we will.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.260
Thank you very much.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.260
We will.

01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.540
Thanks a lot and keep up the good work.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.540
Okay, I will.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:10.540
Thank you very much.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.540
Thank you.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.540
Thank you very much too.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:13.540
Bye bye.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.540
Thank you.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.540
Bye bye.

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.540
Bye.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.540
Bye.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.540
Yeah.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.300
I don't even know what to say about that.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.940
I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to hang up before I start crying.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.420
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.420
Thanks for being here.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:26.420
Live for that.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.740
I'm probably going to stream later.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.740
I got to decompress.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.300
I need some lunch and I need a coffee.

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300
That was just crazy.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.300
I just, I didn't, I had a bunch of stuff written down, but I never really said any

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.300
of it.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:41.380
And I just kind of shot from the hip.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:45.620
So we'll see what it is on the replay and thank you very much for joining me.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.180
Have a good afternoon and I'll see you later.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:47.520
Thanks.
