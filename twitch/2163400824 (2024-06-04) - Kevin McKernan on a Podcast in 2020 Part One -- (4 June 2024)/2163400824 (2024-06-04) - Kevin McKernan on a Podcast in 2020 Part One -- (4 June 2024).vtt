WEBVTT

00:16.440 --> 00:31.210
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the greatest gentleman, greatest organization of gentlemen, Connie Mutu on the percussion.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.988
Mr. Chuck LaValle on the keyboard.

00:36.808 --> 00:38.248
O'Teal from Egypt.

00:39.989 --> 00:40.389
Truth.

00:41.929 --> 00:43.470
Jimmy Herring on guitar.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.290
A BBQ 250.

00:46.890 --> 00:49.071
Hey, on the drums.

00:51.492 --> 00:52.472
Matt Munney.

00:52.992 --> 00:54.012
Matt Munney.

00:54.292 --> 00:57.053
I don't know what he's going to play.

01:52.023 --> 02:17.537
Feel a fixin' to die Yeah, I'm walkin' kinda funny Feel a fixin' to die Yeah, I don't mind dyin' Hate to see my children cryin' There's a black smoke risin' Risin' on my head There's a black smoke risin' Risin' on my head

02:19.735 --> 02:20.479
No, I can't

03:38.463 --> 03:54.268
I'm walkin' kinda funny, feelin' fixin' to die Yeah, I'm walkin' kinda funny, lost, feelin' fixin' to die Said I don't mind dying, but I hate to see my children dying

04:08.251 --> 04:35.668
No, I can't tell him, making all my dying men I said, I'm walking kind of funny, yeah, see the picture of that Yeah, I'm walking kind of funny, yeah, see the picture of that Yeah, I don't mind dying, boy, but I hate to see my children crying

04:54.755 --> 04:57.117
Yo, welcome to the Spice Passa.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.579
Let's see how I'm practicing.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.961
Yo, you remember O'Hara.

05:02.001 --> 05:02.542
My boy, Sulu.

05:02.562 --> 05:02.782
Hey, y'all.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.183
What up, Spock?

05:04.263 --> 05:06.205
Baby, no salsa on the leather.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.086
Keep it on the chips.

05:09.848 --> 05:10.248
Artwork.

05:11.229 --> 05:11.449
Dope.

05:13.511 --> 05:15.472
James T. Kirk, president of the council.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.415
This boy love that leftover roast beef.

05:18.495 --> 05:20.637
Spock, it's solid beef, baby.

05:21.297 --> 05:22.839
He like it a little, you know, rotten.

05:24.127 --> 05:25.588
And this here is my sanctuary.

05:25.988 --> 05:29.449
See, this is where I chill, where I relax, where I chillax.

05:32.530 --> 05:35.391
Scotty, beam on down, baby.

05:39.352 --> 05:43.614
As always, Scotty, bringing the power.

05:43.974 --> 05:44.814
Oh, yeah.

05:45.154 --> 05:46.095
Oh, yeah.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.075
Oh, yeah.

05:47.155 --> 05:48.916
Yo, Scotty, bring it.

05:48.996 --> 05:49.216
Oh, yeah.

05:59.909 --> 06:02.589
Just trying to make people laugh every once in a while.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.790
We gotta laugh every once in a while if we're gonna get through this darkness, ladies and gentlemen.

06:06.870 --> 06:07.770
Glad to be here.

06:07.870 --> 06:08.611
Good to see you.

06:10.091 --> 06:15.352
The stream will end at 1240 on the dot, but we gotta do these things.

06:15.372 --> 06:21.013
We're trying to make them a little sharper and deliver a crisper message.

06:21.753 --> 06:26.714
I think we are at a crucial state where we cannot, we cannot,

06:28.749 --> 06:35.171
We cannot let up the pressure on the openings that have presented themselves.

06:35.211 --> 06:36.531
We can't move on yet.

06:37.211 --> 06:45.753
I'm sorry to say it, but we've got to keep hitting the same spot over and over again until the illusion actually breaks.

06:45.893 --> 06:51.555
Because the only thing they have left is to double down and to triple down on these players.

06:53.632 --> 06:55.214
That's why they're rapping in Geneva.

06:56.435 --> 07:01.860
There's no other way to explain that level of Fonzie jumping the shark.

07:02.982 --> 07:07.886
If Epigirl is rapping in Geneva, that's pretty impressive.

07:13.968 --> 07:22.041
It's my understanding that Mark Kulak may be going for the current independent BrightWeb record of 53 streams in a row.

07:22.061 --> 07:23.343
He's getting really close.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.146
Don't miss him.

07:25.827 --> 07:26.348
Don't miss him.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.697
If you see me slouching, please tell me to sit up straight.

07:40.737 --> 07:42.218
I'm sitting on a stool.

07:42.719 --> 07:43.940
Sometimes I need reminding.

07:43.960 --> 07:44.200
Sorry, dear.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.742
I should have talked over this liar.

07:45.762 --> 07:46.543
Sorry about that, dear.

07:59.585 --> 08:00.285
And I have lied.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.346
I'm sure I'll lie again.

08:01.366 --> 08:02.306
I don't want to lie.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.127
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

08:04.247 --> 08:05.267
I try not to be a liar.

08:05.307 --> 08:06.148
I don't want to be a liar.

08:06.728 --> 08:09.489
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

08:11.910 --> 08:16.092
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

08:16.452 --> 08:20.554
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

08:35.687 --> 08:37.568
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

08:37.668 --> 08:50.594
His name is JJ Cooey and I believe he is a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

09:03.235 --> 09:13.259
Eventually telling the truth is exactly the kind of titration I mean as they walk you to the place in the cave that they want you to arrive to next.

09:13.339 --> 09:15.000
That's what these people have been doing.

09:15.560 --> 09:21.062
That's why they have to step in front of people because two years too late is too late.

09:21.463 --> 09:27.265
And so the truth is going to come out that they have been covering up a criminal vaccine schedule for decades

09:27.765 --> 09:32.868
and that truth is going to be slow rolled out so that people react the way that they want them to react.

09:33.409 --> 09:35.370
How many different ways can I explain it?

09:35.670 --> 09:50.419
There's no question that the previous vaccine schedule was garbage and likely injured so many children that they had to invent something called sudden infant death syndrome that all of us grew up believing in.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.728
It's much worse than you think, ladies and gentlemen.

09:54.748 --> 09:59.933
It could be that some of the truth is that transfection isn't as bad as the last vaccine schedule was.

10:00.313 --> 10:03.056
That's possibly part of this enchantment.

10:04.093 --> 10:05.494
that the inverse is true.

10:05.914 --> 10:16.721
That actually, transfection hasn't hurt as many people as a random combination of adjuvants and recombinant proteins injected into children at very early ages.

10:16.882 --> 10:19.523
Of course this is a possibility.

10:20.024 --> 10:26.048
And I apologize to everyone out there if I haven't been absolutely clear that I don't know.

10:26.788 --> 10:33.313
But I do know for sure that most or everything that we have been led to believe by these people because of this fact.

10:34.313 --> 10:47.420
This man told us the truth, that they have led us to perceive everything incorrectly, even, perhaps, the danger of the transfection, because, of course, they rolled out placebo.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.141
There was no danger for a lot of people.

10:52.483 --> 11:02.308
And so this is all being obfuscated by this parade, this circus of rappers and screamers and talkers.

11:04.005 --> 11:15.048
Nothing that we perceive is true, and that's why no one, not just one or some, none of them talk about these ideas.

11:15.448 --> 11:18.409
None of them talk about these ideas.

11:19.489 --> 11:26.991
Except to attribute bad motives to the people who want to talk about these bad ideas.

11:30.191 --> 11:31.872
It is really hard to

11:34.364 --> 11:48.393
overestimate how valuable it is if you watch how even though i'm a creep on twitter i am attacking their ideas and even though they're pretending to be victims

11:49.571 --> 11:53.778
They are actually only attributing bad motives to everyone who disagrees with them.

11:53.838 --> 12:00.849
And this strategy, while implying that it's in fact their, the targets of their ire that are doing this.

12:01.069 --> 12:04.114
This is exactly how the art of war goes.

12:05.205 --> 12:17.110
And because they have access to weaponized piles of money, because weaponized piles of money are providing them with programmed social media prominence, they are able to outcompete us.

12:17.730 --> 12:25.993
And they are able to prevent many people who would otherwise have seen this long ago from not having seen them for who they are.

12:26.733 --> 12:30.455
Because they're focused on the Scooby-Doo villains, like Tony Fauci.

12:31.375 --> 12:38.481
and the Scooby-Doo villains like Elon Musk or Peter Hotez or Peter Daszak.

12:41.738 --> 12:54.469
And if we learn our history, we find out that who we should have been focused on is anybody that studied with Hilary Koprowski, anybody that studied with Stanley Plotkin, anybody that studied with Bob Gallo, anybody that studied with David Baltimore.

12:54.529 --> 13:03.976
These basically four mentors can be traced right to all these bad ideas and their origination in their own writings, in their own words.

13:04.397 --> 13:06.538
And that's how we inherited these charlatans.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.240
That's why they have power over us.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.522
That's why they had power over our parents.

13:12.042 --> 13:16.088
And so a lot of us, if we can just pull our head out, we don't even need to ask for forgiveness.

13:16.909 --> 13:24.640
We just need to cooperate together and agree that we need to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of this mythology.

13:33.956 --> 13:42.261
And America, we need to focus on transitioning America out of this mythology because America's vaccine schedule is the most criminal of all.

13:45.543 --> 13:47.605
America's vac- Is that not working?

13:47.645 --> 13:49.246
What the hell is that not working?

13:49.266 --> 13:49.686
Test, test.

13:49.726 --> 13:51.187
Test, test.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.768
Why is that not working?

13:52.848 --> 13:53.568
Test, test.

13:54.969 --> 13:55.670
Test, test.

13:55.730 --> 13:56.310
There we go.

13:56.650 --> 13:57.831
Oh no, that's the wrong one.

14:00.933 --> 14:02.394
Anyway, I wanted to make that echo.

14:03.404 --> 14:05.105
didn't have that set up right, sorry about that.

14:05.806 --> 14:10.750
But in America, we have the most criminal vaccine schedule of all.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.073
That would have had better effect if I would have had an echo on it.

14:16.835 --> 14:25.683
And so if we're gonna reveal this, this coordinated wave of liars that is responsible for us,

14:27.310 --> 14:36.795
Our children having assumed that a pandemic happened and that vaccines are, I don't know, teacher says they're okay, must've been a real virus.

14:36.855 --> 14:38.937
I mean, COVID is definitely COVID, it's strange.

14:39.197 --> 14:47.081
All of this stuff, if we're gonna teach our kids to see it and make it safely to shore, we're gonna need to do a couple things.

14:47.121 --> 14:49.563
We're gonna need to stay focused on the biology.

14:49.643 --> 14:53.365
We're gonna need to not take their bait on social media and on television.

14:53.965 --> 14:56.787
And we're going to have to teach our children to love their neighbors again.

14:56.827 --> 15:02.790
And that means even people that are still trapped in the TV, still trapped on social media.

15:03.271 --> 15:04.652
That's essentially what we're doing.

15:04.692 --> 15:09.534
We're trying to free people while at the same time, we've got to swim in that water.

15:10.315 --> 15:13.817
We want everybody to get out of the river because it's too dangerous to swim in.

15:13.877 --> 15:18.020
But everybody's been told that that's the only safe place because the forest is on fire.

15:19.011 --> 15:25.434
It turns out that our houses are fine, the forest is great, and it's the river that's dangerous.

15:25.994 --> 15:27.595
We've got to wake people up, ladies and gentlemen.

15:27.615 --> 15:29.236
You can do that by sharing this work.

15:30.356 --> 15:38.520
A great place to share, which is growing slowly but surely every week, is stream.gigaohm.bio.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.201
That's our own PeerTube instance.

15:42.762 --> 15:47.284
And it is now getting hundreds of views a day, which is great.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.746
and it's because people share there.

15:49.806 --> 15:50.807
There's no censorship.

15:50.847 --> 15:52.409
You get to hear the music in the beginning.

15:53.289 --> 15:59.015
You can download the videos, I believe, and if that's not, somebody tell me and we'll figure it out.

15:59.796 --> 16:10.466
But there's a paradigm shift happening, and it's happening because there are those voices on the independent bright web that have started to take control of the narrative and insist

16:11.127 --> 16:23.895
that people pull their heads out and start talking about murder first and all the different ways that people were murdered and that how that was misconstrued as as a pandemic.

16:24.975 --> 16:30.779
The only way you're going to be able to engage with us in a meaningful way is to start seeing it as in the

16:30.999 --> 16:32.520
informed non-compliance.

16:33.000 --> 16:49.287
The more you learn about what these people said in 2020 and the more you learn about what was known or assumed to be known about viruses and RNA viruses in particular before the pandemic, the easier it is for you to just say, wait a minute, you're full of it.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.829
And be confident in saying it because you know the biology.

16:54.269 --> 16:56.110
This is GigaOM Biological, by the way.

16:58.917 --> 16:59.097
do

17:22.357 --> 17:25.019
Good morning, everyone, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

17:25.059 --> 17:31.004
My name is Jonathan Cooey, and I'm the biologist that brings you Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief.

17:32.065 --> 17:42.292
We are trying to restore the reverence for the sacred, especially the irreducible complexity that is found everywhere in nature and in all of us.

17:43.969 --> 17:44.890
Welcome to the show.

17:45.390 --> 17:47.791
As I said, I come live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

17:47.812 --> 17:49.432
You can hear my garden back there.

17:49.933 --> 17:50.873
It's a pretty nice day.

17:50.953 --> 17:52.074
And so the back door is open.

17:54.252 --> 17:55.393
I'm a human just like you.

17:55.513 --> 17:56.414
I've got a family.

17:56.554 --> 18:08.142
I've got kids that I want to be able to enjoy the kinds of things that I enjoyed as a young person and not have to worry about a world full of adults who don't understand basic reality.

18:08.202 --> 18:15.628
And so I don't like the world that my kids are growing up in because they are going to be surrounded by adults that don't really understand reality.

18:16.468 --> 18:24.215
GigaOM Biological is trying to throw a lifeline back down into the cave, the Plato's cave, and try to help people out of the cave.

18:24.235 --> 18:27.598
We're trying to use flashlights and torches to help people.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.880
We're trying to build a way out.

18:30.460 --> 18:31.921
And that way out, I believe, is

18:34.952 --> 18:49.363
restoring an appreciation for the irreducible complexity of our own biology, so that you can hear when people are using dumb, simple, or stupid, complicated models to try and intimidate you in

18:50.283 --> 19:05.971
into foregoing that reverence and noticing it and instead assume that these questions are answerable and in fact the fidelity that they exaggerate all the time in all of these different places is in fact real.

19:06.992 --> 19:14.676
And I think that the more sophisticated you become in terms of understanding these three ideas, the more likely it is that you're going to be able to, darn,

19:20.592 --> 19:41.611
let's try this here if this is going to work i think that's okay um intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and rna cannot pandemic and so although i still think for the next

19:43.769 --> 19:55.092
There is a lot of work to be done yet where we are outlining why it is that we should group certain people together into a what I've called team worst case scenario.

19:56.073 --> 20:03.875
And they are a group of people that have curated a narrative about a novel virus that may or may not have come from a laboratory.

20:05.109 --> 20:08.311
and the narrative around the response to it.

20:09.232 --> 20:17.118
And these people are coordinated in their lying in that they try very hard to only stop one car of the train.

20:17.878 --> 20:28.726
And that's why the video that I play often with the man that pretends to stop the subway and then steps off to the side and chalks his hands and then starts the train again or seems to push it,

20:29.807 --> 20:38.103
I've used that over and over again because I believe that these people are part of a scripted, coordinated group of liars.

20:39.471 --> 21:06.230
that was put in place at the beginning of the pandemic, maybe even months or years before the pandemic to make sure that trusted sources, a term that's used by them, trusted sources were in place so that this narrative could be curated in such a way so that at the end of the tunnel, we would come to the conclusion that a pandemic happened, that the response was a little bit rushed and maybe botched.

21:08.384 --> 21:23.298
But overall quite successful and we've been off script for much longer than most people understand and myself and others are starting to realize that there's a good possibility that the warp speed

21:24.324 --> 21:32.087
sort of forced rush of the vaccine rollout may have been the start of them having to go off script.

21:32.687 --> 21:50.873
And essentially without those two years of confusion, fear, frustration, and doubt that was going to be orchestrated through testing and protocols, they were forced to kind of do that on top of the vaccine rollout, which became much more of a nuanced dance

21:51.738 --> 22:02.425
And that's why so many people were brought on stage in June of 2021, when they probably were never scheduled to come on stage until a year or more later.

22:03.936 --> 22:23.565
And although they were ready, and although they were in place, the way that they temporarily overlap now, actually the way that they shared the spotlight now, and the speed with which their narrative changed over the course of their public appearances, reveals them for the manipulators, the players that they are.

22:25.043 --> 22:34.027
and their inability to address any of these questions, even as they occasionally address me as a person to need addressing.

22:35.328 --> 22:44.753
We have seen over the last four years, especially I have seen over the last four years, that these people engage in a very disingenuous kind of relationship where

22:45.493 --> 22:52.058
They essentially interact with you in such a way to make you feel as though you're making a contribution and that you're being heard.

22:52.098 --> 22:56.861
But then when they go on to promote, they continue to promote one another over you.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.463
And that's how they've absorbed a lot of people.

22:59.543 --> 23:10.071
A lot of people have essentially thought that I'm going to go to Romania and I'm going to finally get on stage at one of these international COVID summits and people are going to find out that there was no pandemic.

23:11.712 --> 23:12.533
And then what happens?

23:16.294 --> 23:22.158
Well, then Epigirl comes back from the conference and tells everybody that, wow, it was really great.

23:22.198 --> 23:23.159
I had breakfast with him.

23:23.199 --> 23:26.141
And he says 17 million people were killed by the shot.

23:26.481 --> 23:29.143
And then Robert Malone comes back from it and he says the same thing.

23:29.203 --> 23:30.684
I saw an amazing presentation.

23:31.064 --> 23:33.606
And he says 17 million people were killed from the shot.

23:33.666 --> 23:42.252
But he also said other stuff that all of these people are very, very precise in omitting.

23:47.182 --> 23:55.326
And so the accusation that I'm making is that the spread of these bad ideas was coordinated by whoever, whatever weaponized piles of money are behind this.

23:56.366 --> 23:59.388
It wasn't the DOD or unless these people work for the DOD.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.249
And I'm fine with that explanation.

24:02.309 --> 24:03.850
Show me how they work for the DOD.

24:04.170 --> 24:13.895
They work for someone because since the very beginning, they have been fueling a narrative

24:15.407 --> 24:18.492
which focuses on these principles.

24:19.593 --> 24:24.501
And now if you say that Sasha Latapova no longer says that, remember yesterday.

24:26.823 --> 24:38.146
The obvious meddler, Doc Malek, made the point of having Sasha Latupova on her stream multiple times, and then made the point of mentioning me, but saying that we have very similar ideas.

24:38.726 --> 24:53.549
And since Sasha is pre-programmed in social media to rise and be seen and show up in everybody's algorithm, then essentially, I guess, according to Malek, Sasha and me are interchangeable, and maybe Sasha's more likable.

24:57.267 --> 25:04.917
I mean, he felt it was very relevant to promote his second or third interview with her and do a substack about it and get all excited about it.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.100
He's never done that for me.

25:07.120 --> 25:14.490
And in fact, the second interview I had with him, it was really like he was down in the dumps about something and he had to talk only about his suffering all the time.

25:17.304 --> 25:25.468
And so what you see and what I'm seeing is, and I wanna be very clear about it, you can see them coordinatedly lying together.

25:25.829 --> 25:42.558
And there's no good reason why Sasha Latupova should be promoting Kevin McKernan when actually he thinks that there's a virus and she says there's no virus and the gain of function is a mythology, then essentially they don't agree on anything, but it's okay, they get along.

25:46.004 --> 26:03.795
I mean, if Kevin McKernan was exhibiting, let's say, a correct pattern of behavior, he would have blocked her a long time ago, but he's not because he knows that she's on a team that can't be treated the same way that people outside of that team are treated.

26:03.915 --> 26:05.456
Eventually, they may come to heads.

26:06.056 --> 26:07.197
Eventually, they may argue.

26:07.237 --> 26:12.280
Maybe they'll go into a Twitter space and they'll argue about it, but it will be fake.

26:13.513 --> 26:21.577
just like the rest of these rivalries are fake, just like the rest of this engagement with Jonathan Cooley's theories are often fake.

26:21.957 --> 26:28.860
Even the people that promote me, sort of, they just all kind of abdicate understanding.

26:28.940 --> 26:32.942
I'm not sophisticated enough to understand what JJ's saying.

26:33.822 --> 26:37.704
That's the best I ever get from anyone, and that's barring nobody.

26:39.284 --> 26:42.205
So you want me to be absolutely brutally honest?

26:42.826 --> 26:56.092
Apparently, I haven't done enough work to explain how easy it is to understand that RNA virology is a hoax based on synthetic transfection and transformation of cell cultures.

26:57.413 --> 27:00.154
How much more succinctly has anyone ever put it?

27:00.174 --> 27:02.315
You don't need to write a whole

27:05.774 --> 27:06.955
treaties about this.

27:06.995 --> 27:09.397
You need to say it as simply as possible.

27:09.457 --> 27:12.900
That's the problem that I present with all of these people.

27:13.340 --> 27:20.165
If you listen to me and you take the most simplest distillation of these ideas and try to debunk it, you can't.

27:22.387 --> 27:32.295
I should probably add to RNA cannot pandemic is that RNA viruses are based solely on transfection and transformation in cell culture.

27:34.733 --> 27:36.275
our understanding of them.

27:37.596 --> 27:41.180
I just think RNA virology is best because what is that?

27:41.540 --> 27:43.062
What is RNA virology?

27:44.103 --> 27:46.145
Is it just the study of exosomal signaling?

27:47.796 --> 27:58.761
And so they called it virology to make sure that you would never attribute it to yourself, that you would never come to the conclusion that, hey, wait, are you saying that my own immune system uses retroviruses too?

27:59.202 --> 28:03.524
That my own immune system tries to communicate with other immune systems that are in my group?

28:03.624 --> 28:05.805
Or you mean all these things exist?

28:05.865 --> 28:08.246
Is that why I didn't like kissing that girl, but I like this?

28:08.626 --> 28:14.049
They don't want you to think any of this biology could have any frame of reference within you.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.704
And these people don't either.

28:20.945 --> 28:21.625
Don't you see?

28:21.785 --> 28:27.108
As sophisticated as they are, they still haven't been able to simply put it.

28:27.929 --> 28:34.493
They're still using a combination of dumb simple or stupid complicated to confuse people instead of just saying it succinctly.

28:36.308 --> 28:46.896
That's why they skip the same beginning slide for the last year and a half now and say I'm chasing a Scooby-Doo mystery or something like that instead of just addressing the three points that I say they can't.

28:46.956 --> 28:47.836
Now we have a fourth.

28:48.857 --> 28:52.980
RNA virology is based solely on transfection and transformation of cell cultures.

28:57.406 --> 29:00.248
So they've changed the way we think by coordinated lying.

29:00.368 --> 29:01.889
It's very, very hard.

29:01.929 --> 29:05.051
I just actually had a talk with my sons about it because...

29:07.136 --> 29:11.818
They wanted to do a thing with Freddy on Minecraft.

29:11.838 --> 29:24.525
And what they wanted to do was they wanted to pretend that it was only Kira and her playing, but then actually Matthew would be in the other room, also in the world, harassing them and then pretending like, wait, there's somebody here.

29:24.945 --> 29:25.865
We don't know who it is.

29:26.005 --> 29:30.908
And Kira was going to make it seem like he also didn't know who it was and was worried that they'd been hacked.

29:31.792 --> 29:35.395
And I said, you know, that's exactly how they created the pandemic, right?

29:35.435 --> 29:39.559
They just got a bunch of people to pretend to agree about something.

29:40.801 --> 29:54.533
And if they did it with enough people on enough platforms, then everybody that looked at those platforms on their phone or looked at those platforms on their YouTube or their TV would see an illusion of consensus that there was a pandemic occurring.

29:55.313 --> 30:10.948
just like you two agreeing to lie to each other, because they had even planned to have Cherokee come out of the room and sit and watch them and talk smack about how they're not building very well, and then say he's got to go to the bathroom and then show up in the background as the invader.

30:11.488 --> 30:26.135
And so they really had a script worked out so that they could fool their sister into believing that someone had hacked Minecraft and that was burning their houses and stuff and was in creator mode and they had all kinds of things figured out.

30:26.595 --> 30:30.897
And I tried very hard for them to see how easy, just imagine how easy it would be.

30:32.398 --> 30:45.851
If Health and Human Services and the national biosecurity state decided that we needed to get compliance to the worst case scenario, we needed to see how close we could get to 100% compliance.

30:46.451 --> 30:51.476
And the way that we were going to do it was with a limited spectrum of debate that would be curated by people on the news.

30:51.776 --> 30:55.820
They talked about it in Dark Winter and in Event 201.

30:57.546 --> 31:03.027
about how there needed to be people in place, trusted news sources, trusted sources of information.

31:05.333 --> 31:10.515
And so I want to be very clear that I'm making the accusation that they've been doing this for decades.

31:10.555 --> 31:17.558
They have been intelligently and consciously manipulating the organized habits and opinions of us since our parents.

31:17.618 --> 31:23.380
And that's why we grew up believing that vaccines weren't terrible and viruses were real.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.382
And there was some things spreading around all the time, which may be true.

31:29.448 --> 31:36.034
but not in the dumb, simple way that they've described it.

31:37.255 --> 31:51.407
Because there's an irreducible complexity out there that all of these people are trying to mislead the young about, so that they never understand the breadth and the depth of the spectacular commitment to lies that is the entire biosecurity state.

31:52.878 --> 32:16.372
that all of these people serve, whatever that is, the weaponized piles of money and banks and private hedge funds, the weaponized piles of money that are the pharmaceutical companies and their intellectual property, whatever it's worth, the investing, everything that you and I don't understand is all wrapped up in this illusion so that we can be governed by a mythology.

32:16.472 --> 32:20.394
Our children can be governed by lies, essentially be slaves and not know it.

32:23.049 --> 32:36.932
And so I'm making some pretty big accusations about these people, but I think their pattern of behavior, their appearances on podcasts in April and May of 2020 is not by chance.

32:37.852 --> 32:51.955
It's actually part of this national security operation that was gamed for many decades and tabletop exercises where they suggested there would be characters like an Epi girl.

32:53.126 --> 32:55.107
That was the public facing brochure.

32:55.167 --> 33:10.274
The real reality is, is that they had people set up so that different sides of the narrative could be controlled and that people would fall into different grooves following different influencers.

33:10.314 --> 33:13.055
Let's call them thought leaders.

33:14.936 --> 33:18.458
And these thought leaders were put in place because they know how to do this.

33:19.418 --> 33:20.399
They've gamed it out.

33:21.994 --> 33:29.962
And there is no reason to believe that this man is saving us given what he said over the timeline of the pandemic.

33:30.502 --> 33:32.864
He's essentially Bret Weinstein in 2020.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.848
All the way until December.

33:38.610 --> 33:45.116
It's a subtle debate about whether the virus is novel or not, but there is no question that there is a virus spreading.

33:48.137 --> 34:05.170
And that's why even after the Senate committee hearing, somebody like Mary Holland interviews him and promotes him on CHD, because they are also part of the orchestrated curation of this slow roll.

34:05.670 --> 34:11.755
In a few years, maybe, maybe in 3030, they're gonna eventually say the whole vaccine schedule is shit.

34:12.155 --> 34:14.897
But man, oh man, these RNA vaccines are obviously better.

34:14.917 --> 34:16.759
Now that we're not making them through process two,

34:20.046 --> 34:22.308
Now that Tony Fauci's dead, I guess we can admit it.

34:26.811 --> 34:32.676
That's why they needed all of these people on the podcast with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:32.736 --> 34:35.018
It was originally supposed to be just me and Bobby.

34:35.679 --> 34:39.161
And then a week or four days beforehand, it became a panel.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.084
And I got seven minutes.

34:42.684 --> 34:44.025
Robert Malone took 40.

34:45.406 --> 34:46.487
Meryl Nass took another 20.

34:48.089 --> 34:56.773
Jessica Rose took like five and a very confused Tess Laurie just sat there and squinted for an hour and a half going, what in the hell did they invite me here for?

34:59.174 --> 35:03.896
And Bobby Kennedy said some crazy stuff about me at the beginning of the pandemic.

35:05.316 --> 35:07.317
At the beginning of the, I mean, crazy stuff.

35:07.677 --> 35:10.078
When I was listening to it live, I was cringing.

35:10.158 --> 35:13.520
All I could do was look down at the table and then back into the, I mean,

35:15.922 --> 35:18.883
I never said that it was intelligence agencies or something like that.

35:18.903 --> 35:21.544
I mean, it's just an incredible introduction.

35:23.245 --> 35:24.526
I was flabbergasted.

35:26.406 --> 35:33.109
And honestly, the hypothesis that I pitched here was done incorrectly.

35:33.169 --> 35:34.370
I had to adjust so

35:35.461 --> 35:45.685
I had so little time to adjust that I had to make a decision between whether I was going to say they could have transfected us to the spike protein, or they could have planted clones of the whole sequence anywhere they wanted to.

35:45.705 --> 35:51.207
I had to be somewhat selective about how I said that because I only had seven minutes.

35:51.267 --> 35:54.268
And so I kind of said that they could have planted the spike signal anywhere.

35:54.288 --> 35:57.229
And that's, in retrospect, wasn't the perfect presentation.

35:57.269 --> 36:01.151
But that's what happens when you're told you're going to have an hour

36:01.751 --> 36:05.393
And you have 130 slides, and you're ready to teach Bobby everything.

36:05.773 --> 36:07.835
And then they say, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

36:07.855 --> 36:08.675
We've changed the plan.

36:08.695 --> 36:09.996
We're going to have these people come in.

36:10.056 --> 36:11.297
Why do you think that happened?

36:16.259 --> 36:24.084
It happened because that guy up there, this woman over here, and that woman down there at the bottom, Epigirl, are all part of a curation team.

36:25.196 --> 36:33.742
that made sure that the worst case scenario of a gain of function lab leak, even if it ended up to be not as dangerous of a virus, it could spread around the world.

36:33.802 --> 36:35.904
And that's indeed probably what happened right now.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.206
They all agree on that.

36:38.406 --> 36:44.530
They all were there to make sure that the message that that didn't happen, didn't actually get out from this podcast.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.012
And I think they were quite successful.

36:47.913 --> 36:51.956
Partly because I'm still trapped in their illusion at this time.

36:51.996 --> 36:54.438
I'm still not sure who's a bad guy and a good guy here.

36:55.948 --> 37:00.810
I thought I was being given an opportunity maybe even to convince Robert Malone.

37:02.391 --> 37:07.813
And then nine days later, he sees me at a CHD conference and yanks his hand away because he says he doesn't know who I am.

37:11.615 --> 37:15.156
I was in a signal chat with Brett Weinstein for almost a year.

37:17.817 --> 37:20.918
And he's known that this should be called a transfection since early 2021.

37:27.489 --> 37:39.397
And now he's on Russell Brand, still unable to be succinct and simple about anything, like accurate, you know, still unable to say anything because their job is to mislead the young.

37:42.679 --> 37:45.601
And I think we need to explain over and over again that.

37:46.361 --> 37:46.842
Okay.

37:51.024 --> 37:52.005
I'm going to escape.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.287
I think it's just a little mad that I'm doing too much here.

37:59.568 --> 38:15.318
Yeah, so we need to explain that embedded in an operation like Dr. Giordano so eloquently gives the brochure presentation for, the public presentation for,

38:16.616 --> 38:23.684
We already know that we're going to use the internet to control the perception of a spreading dangerous pathogen.

38:23.704 --> 38:25.886
But in reality, we're just going to seed a few cases.

38:26.427 --> 38:35.517
I've made the argument that seeding the few cases could be specifically seeding the molecular signal that they wanted to be seeded.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.122
And they could have done that in Wuhan.

38:38.162 --> 38:41.605
They could have done that in the Sohomish County, man.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.346
They could have done that in Bergamo.

38:43.487 --> 38:52.455
They could have also used something else to make people sick and die like protocols or previous vaccinations from the year before.

38:54.617 --> 38:59.061
And I don't know because it's a crime, but what I am suggesting is that the main issue

39:00.054 --> 39:07.722
The main molecular biological issue that every one of these people can't seem to get their head around because they don't understand J.J.

39:07.782 --> 39:11.566
Cooey's biology is that the sequence could be planted.

39:12.833 --> 39:21.297
It could be planted in a very high fidelity way so that the sequencing reaction would be very strong signal.

39:22.037 --> 39:29.280
And they can do that with any signal that they want to, any DNA that they want to manufacture, they can manufacture in large quantities.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.201
And then it can be put in places.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.162
It could be put in cruise ships.

39:33.222 --> 39:34.983
It can be put in people's throats.

39:35.163 --> 39:36.603
It can be put in vapes.

39:36.703 --> 39:39.024
It could be put in waters.

39:39.605 --> 39:40.625
It could be put anywhere.

39:43.112 --> 40:07.132
And they don't, none of them, none of them want to acknowledge that recombinant DNA and RNA technology is sufficient to create all of the molecular signals, all of them, the lateral flow test, the PCR tests, the full sequences, all of them are easily, easily and cheaply created with synthetic DNA and RNA put in this only in the places it needs to be.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.795
And everything else, everything else could be murder.

40:12.921 --> 40:16.324
Is there anyone that's trying to explain it more simply than that?

40:16.744 --> 40:34.979
You don't need to argue about whether viruses can be isolated or whether viruses can be cultured if you say that RNA virology is based on synthetic RNA and DNA being used to transform and transfect cell cultures and then show that that's the case in every paper that you look at.

40:36.440 --> 40:37.061
And that is true.

40:38.274 --> 40:41.956
I've tried to get the no-virus people to do that for quite some time now.

40:42.016 --> 40:56.246
It's actually the idea that I tried to bridge the connection between CHD and the no-virus people, try to bring them together under the idea that there is no high-fidelity RNA molecule that you can let go like a Frisbee and it's just going to go around the world repeatedly for five years.

40:56.286 --> 40:59.248
And by the end of it, there's going to be thousands of Frisbees everywhere.

41:01.032 --> 41:07.680
That's not how RNA works, but if you wanted everybody to find a frisbee, you could make a bunch of frisbees and then put them places.

41:08.261 --> 41:13.087
Throw them in everybody's backyard and then say, hey, go in the backyard and look, if you got one, whoa, it's spreading, see?

41:15.750 --> 41:19.595
Now, if your backyard's on social media, it's pretty easy to make that illusion happen, isn't it?

41:24.372 --> 41:33.879
And these people are part of a team of people that was put in place in order to confuse, frustrate, create fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the worst case scenario of what was really happening.

41:33.919 --> 41:36.721
Maybe next year it'll be worse because the virus is still evolving.

41:38.342 --> 41:40.344
These are all things that are still being said.

41:40.404 --> 41:41.224
Now they've shifted.

41:41.745 --> 41:42.845
There's been some shift.

41:43.786 --> 41:50.011
Pierre Corey is now shifting to say, wow, I can't believe I finally figured out that the vaccine schedule is bad.

41:50.411 --> 41:53.013
But we've already said, this is part of the titrated shift.

41:53.865 --> 41:56.986
they're eventually gonna admit that the FDA and the CDC was shitty.

41:58.827 --> 42:10.432
They're eventually gonna admit that the old vaccine schedule was bad, but these new ones, if we just get the process two right, or we do the process one again, or we make it personalized, that everything will be fine.

42:11.732 --> 42:15.534
And there's no doubt in my mind that that's exactly who these people play for.

42:17.079 --> 42:21.203
And if Ryan Cole is about to jump ship, well, he needs to be pushed.

42:21.884 --> 42:31.694
If Peter McCullough is thinking about jumping ship, he needs to be pushed because none of them are making a concerted effort to get to the exits.

42:34.577 --> 42:38.241
Could be because there's a lot of coercion that happens as you enter this group, I don't know.

42:42.012 --> 42:49.195
I can guarantee you that some or all of these people are read into a national security operation and know damn well that they're lying to the American public.

42:49.235 --> 43:03.461
A lot of them have known that they've been lying about a worst-case scenario for four years straight, especially the ones who said the worst-case scenario could be a billion people dead at any time during that timeline, because I've never said that.

43:04.747 --> 43:14.660
And I've come to understand the truth is there is no way an RNA molecule can be responsible for a pandemic unless people make enough of it.

43:15.521 --> 43:15.902
That's it.

43:16.763 --> 43:20.788
And then after that, it's still, you want everybody to have a Frisbee, you gotta make them.

43:21.698 --> 43:23.420
You want everybody to have a coronavirus?

43:23.440 --> 43:26.963
You're going to have to make it, or it's already got to be there a long time ago.

43:27.804 --> 43:30.106
And I don't really care what the right answer is anymore.

43:30.166 --> 43:42.738
I just want you to understand that the most plausible and parsimonious explanations, given what we know about RNA virology and immunology, are not being presented by these people.

43:43.960 --> 43:44.820
They're simply not.

43:46.148 --> 44:00.893
All of their possible explanations involve not talking about 2020, not talking about a background signal, not talking about the illusion of PCR or the illusion of sequencing, and not talking about 2020.

44:01.653 --> 44:04.354
They want you to focus on the fact that the COVID shots are bad.

44:05.035 --> 44:05.735
End of story.

44:13.291 --> 44:18.114
And so I am making some bold statements here, but I think these people are working against us.

44:18.174 --> 44:29.280
I think they're on the team of big money, the team of Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Facebook, all of these weaponized piles of money and the social media that they control.

44:31.382 --> 44:33.043
That's what Locals is all about.

44:33.443 --> 44:35.124
That's what Telegram is all about.

44:35.184 --> 44:41.488
That's what this Bitcoin shit and all these other money laundering schemes, that's what they're all about.

44:42.571 --> 44:46.794
That's why everybody on the internet's now buying really fancy watches with Bitcoin.

44:47.975 --> 44:49.296
It's money laundering.

44:49.336 --> 44:54.880
It's very similar to, who else is in a Bitcoin signal chat group for like three years now?

44:55.000 --> 44:55.701
Interesting, huh?

45:11.354 --> 45:16.395
So I want to just take a brief look at Kevin McKernan on a podcast in 2020.

45:16.495 --> 45:18.276
We're going to go to the May one first.

45:18.316 --> 45:22.257
We're going to take a brief look at it, and then we'll probably be done for the day.

45:22.997 --> 45:26.838
I'm going to stream my wife's yoga class after this at 1 o'clock.

45:26.898 --> 45:30.298
If you want to find her on YouTube, it's Fearla, V-E-E-R-L-E.

45:33.259 --> 45:59.450
And it's nog een yogi of which is another yoga teacher in Dutch so she's making fun of herself because she's a beginner yoga teacher and nobody watches but she likes to make the videos and as I've Said to her, you know, once you make the videos, they're always there And so if you're gonna practice and you're gonna do it anyway, I don't mind streaming it So if there's anybody out there who didn't know that you can find it on YouTube but I'm not gonna put links here and stuff like that because I don't need a

46:00.071 --> 46:01.213
other people finding her.

46:02.256 --> 46:03.278
So let's take a look at this.

46:08.476 --> 46:10.198
Kevin McKernan, welcome back.

46:10.418 --> 46:11.979
I might just leave these texts up.

46:11.999 --> 46:13.881
Hey, Vance, thank you so much for having me back.

46:14.181 --> 46:15.582
I appreciate it.

46:16.243 --> 46:18.685
I feel like it was yesterday, but it's probably been a month.

46:18.745 --> 46:19.186
Who knows?

46:19.626 --> 46:20.227
Oh my gosh.

46:20.287 --> 46:26.732
And it seems like you're a person that I just met as a complete stranger, and now I'm texting you being like, hey man, you on?

46:26.752 --> 46:27.353
You ready to go?

46:27.433 --> 46:29.675
And you're like, no, I can't right now.

46:29.875 --> 46:32.578
I'm PCR-ing a SARS virus.

46:32.958 --> 46:33.198
Yeah.

46:33.579 --> 46:37.442
And so like now I've got a buddy out on the East Coast that's messing around with SARS.

46:37.502 --> 46:38.723
What are you doing out there?

46:39.183 --> 46:45.308
So, um, this may be completely superfluous and probably, uh, it's an insurance policy.

46:45.508 --> 46:49.792
We're worried if they find SARS in the cannabis supply chain, we'll get shut down.

46:50.999 --> 46:57.322
And so we set out on a mission to figure out how to detect potential SARS contamination in cannabis.

46:57.602 --> 46:58.883
It's not a replicative test.

46:59.003 --> 47:01.144
It shouldn't have any SARS.

47:01.264 --> 47:09.908
But we've got dispensaries and we've got grows in town right now that are getting employees that are coming down with it.

47:09.948 --> 47:15.090
And actually, everyone's worried that cannabis is manually farmed and manually trimmed often.

47:15.710 --> 47:17.891
And there's a lot of human contact with it.

47:17.931 --> 47:19.472
And so if anyone's coughing or

47:20.980 --> 47:24.201
or spreading SARS onto the cannabis, it's an inhaled product.

47:24.301 --> 47:29.422
So the next people downstream who might be getting this are people who could be potentially inhaling it.

47:30.322 --> 47:37.064
And that in itself you think might be extreme like a lightning strike, but there's a lot of bat guano getting used as fertilizers.

47:37.084 --> 47:39.265
That's where we're finding a lot of the coronaviruses.

47:39.365 --> 47:40.125
And then if you look at the

47:40.525 --> 47:44.510
The patients have shared comorbidities.

47:45.210 --> 47:49.675
So a lot of the elderly population started using CBD as this became more legal.

47:50.636 --> 47:54.821
We've got a lot of COPD, diabetes, hypertension, cancer in particular.

47:54.841 --> 47:56.323
There's a lot of cannabis use in cancer.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.305
Those are all the patient classes that are exposed to COVID.

48:01.185 --> 48:06.968
And so we're just worried if it ever shows up, it'll be a shutdown for us.

48:07.008 --> 48:11.431
So we just started building tests that could pick up SARS on cannabis.

48:12.271 --> 48:17.354
So now I'm finding myself managing it every day and PCRing it and purifying it.

48:18.454 --> 48:23.059
Naturally, all of the whole mask debate gets thrown at you left and right.

48:23.139 --> 48:30.627
I saw you were involved in some of that recently as well, and there seems to be a community out there that's all or nothing on this.

48:30.867 --> 48:35.852
You either wear masks all the time while riding bikes and in cars and going to bed, or you don't wear them at all.

48:36.212 --> 49:02.342
and that there's no cost to wearing them that it's just that people don't want to that my biggest issue with the way that debate is going is it's it's saying look at all these reasons why you should and here's only one reason why you wouldn't and it's because you don't care about anybody else but yourself and it's like wait a second there are going to be second order effects here things you can't predict when now everybody's not only allowed to wear a mask but impelled to wear a mask like this is uh

49:03.442 --> 49:08.522
People didn't, you're right, we're in this place where people want all or nothing answers and it's getting scary out there.

49:08.888 --> 49:12.170
Yeah, and we're not even getting those from, I mean, we've seen the WHO flip-flop.

49:12.210 --> 49:13.811
We've seen Fauci flip-flop on this thing.

49:13.831 --> 49:15.912
And it's not because, I don't think they're being deceitful.

49:15.952 --> 49:18.053
I think it's that it depends on the context.

49:18.133 --> 49:23.236
If you're a physician that's managing patients that are immunocompromised, maybe you should wear one.

49:23.416 --> 49:28.018
And if you're out running or on a, I mean, I saw someone on a bike today fondling their mask while running a bike.

49:28.759 --> 49:31.040
I'm like, right there, my rain man goes off.

49:31.100 --> 49:37.644
Like, wait a minute, dude, riding a bike one-handed fondling your mask is probably more dangerous than the risk that you're inverting by putting the mask on.

49:39.164 --> 49:43.307
So this has gone to just extremes of either virtue signaling or something.

49:43.427 --> 49:46.569
And there's some data out there on hypoxia.

49:46.609 --> 49:49.431
These masks, if you wear them all day, they become wet sponges on your mouth.

49:49.531 --> 49:54.054
And there's higher respiratory infections with people that don't know etiquette on wearing them.

49:54.955 --> 49:56.396
I'm not perfect at wearing them either.

49:56.456 --> 50:02.540
But a lot of these studies, they're finding the SARS on the outside of the mask.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.541
Now, that's not from breathing it in from the atmosphere.

50:04.561 --> 50:06.783
That's from your hand touching something and putting it there.

50:07.495 --> 50:07.695
right?

50:07.875 --> 50:11.639
So they become a collection filter for all types of microbes.

50:12.019 --> 50:18.885
And when you use these things in a sterile setting, you touch it and you toss it, right?

50:19.566 --> 50:22.088
If you ever touch your mask, you throw it out and get a new one.

50:22.168 --> 50:22.969
And no one's doing that.

50:23.369 --> 50:26.332
They're fondling them, moving them around, riding their bikes with them, walking.

50:26.392 --> 50:30.055
And none of that is, at one, it's probably environmentally really destructive.

50:30.095 --> 50:31.316
I don't think there's good evidence that it's

50:31.857 --> 50:35.481
filtering these things out, maybe some of the droplets and the coughs and what have you.

50:36.222 --> 50:40.868
But it's, yeah, it's gotten crazy where no one can see any nuance here.

50:41.709 --> 50:45.734
So yeah, if I were handling live virus in a lab, you got to do it in a BL3 lab, I'd wear one.

50:45.794 --> 50:49.818
But if I'm going outside that day after being in the lab, I'm not wearing one.

50:51.320 --> 50:54.583
And what about being in a closed environment?

50:54.603 --> 50:55.724
You going to the grocery store again?

50:55.744 --> 50:57.985
I would probably, I mean, they make you wear them in the grocery stores.

50:58.005 --> 51:00.548
I probably wouldn't feel like I need to.

51:00.668 --> 51:02.789
If I were in a New York subway, maybe I'd put one on.

51:03.190 --> 51:16.141
I mean, all the areas that have demonstrated there's bad air flow and high population density and perhaps high viral load, but wearing them everywhere just seems like we're going to have, I can't imagine how many masks are going to go floating in the Pacific after this.

51:16.940 --> 51:22.644
Well, I had a really interesting guy, Brad Frecking, on who was running a pork plant.

51:23.285 --> 51:33.052
And they had huge numbers of people coming back positive for coronavirus, and yet very few people showing any symptoms at all and only one hospitalization.

51:33.912 --> 51:40.476
And that was news that when that came out, I remember that was the same week as the two doctors that came out.

51:40.516 --> 51:42.977
It was the same time you and I talked.

51:43.237 --> 51:44.558
There was a whole bunch of stuff.

51:44.618 --> 51:51.081
You're not even allowed to question any part of how dangerous this is or how deadly or any of that.

51:51.141 --> 51:52.662
So where do you think we're at now?

51:53.643 --> 51:55.424
Well, you bring up good studies there.

51:55.464 --> 51:56.985
I mean, those are really interesting.

51:57.185 --> 51:59.166
You see this go through communities like this.

51:59.606 --> 52:01.827
They're in work environments where they're probably really close.

52:01.887 --> 52:02.868
I would imagine a lot of those

52:03.504 --> 52:09.071
Okay, so let's just take a little pause here because that was pretty big pile of flood there of stuff.

52:09.111 --> 52:12.154
So COVID and cannabis, of course, that's really funny.

52:12.715 --> 52:16.779
And the story that he told with regard to bat guano being used is also really funny.

52:19.783 --> 52:20.924
I just find it hilarious.

52:21.485 --> 52:23.187
I was actually making that joke because

52:24.407 --> 52:25.007
It doesn't matter.

52:26.448 --> 52:27.728
Masks.

52:28.249 --> 52:37.232
You don't care about anyone else is what Vance said with regard to not wearing masks means that you don't care about anyone else.

52:37.792 --> 52:40.313
And McKernan didn't push back on that at all.

52:40.373 --> 52:42.354
That's extraordinary because that's really

52:43.195 --> 52:46.578
the narrative that they wanted everybody to adopt, right?

52:46.658 --> 52:49.720
So this is dead on balls narrative here.

52:49.760 --> 52:54.964
This is exactly what Brett Weinstein was doing with his woodshop goggles and bandana.

52:55.024 --> 53:03.050
It's the same, absolutely the same dumb set of questions about do we have to, if we're using these masks, is it dumb to use masks?

53:03.151 --> 53:07.234
No, it's just dumb if you let them get all dirty and you don't renew them every day.

53:07.854 --> 53:10.455
And the other problem is, what are we going to do with all these masks?

53:10.475 --> 53:12.155
I mean, it's just going to be a big garbage heap.

53:12.195 --> 53:13.715
So that's another problem.

53:13.775 --> 53:15.116
It's another dumb question.

53:15.156 --> 53:19.017
If you don't need masks, then who gives a shit about how you dispose of them?

53:19.057 --> 53:22.537
You're wasting them for nothing when you don't need them for something.

53:23.097 --> 53:27.778
And so they're not at all thinking about the psychological aspects of it.

53:27.818 --> 53:28.379
They're very

53:30.599 --> 53:43.309
Strictly limiting their limited spectrum of debate to the what they consider are the moral Justifications for doing something better than then it's it's ridiculous.

53:46.171 --> 53:50.454
I Got a little message here, I'm gonna check just to see what he's got to say over here.

53:51.655 --> 53:52.556
I don't know who this is.

53:52.576 --> 53:52.596
I

54:02.165 --> 54:05.987
The only reason not to wear a mask means a person doesn't care about the life of others.

54:06.807 --> 54:09.128
I mean, I don't know exactly how to hear it.

54:09.168 --> 54:11.189
I heard what I heard there.

54:11.690 --> 54:19.874
They were not usefully arguing against wearing masks, but trying to present it as some sort of subtle, nuanced discussion.

54:19.894 --> 54:24.356
Because, you know, it does stop droplets, but I don't think it stops meaningfully.

54:24.376 --> 54:25.116
What does that mean then?

54:27.297 --> 54:54.499
It is just extraordinary that they also mentioned hypoxia with regard to the masks, and the idea that if they force people to mask in a hospital while they were waiting in the waiting room, and you sat with a mask for two hours in a waiting room, and maybe even a N95 mask because you were really worried about it, and you sat there for four hours, and then they took your pulse ox, it might be low enough for them to justify giving you supplemental oxygen.

54:56.676 --> 55:04.327
And because supplemental oxygen is something that oxygen is something that none of these MDs seem to want to talk about and say, no, you're right.

55:04.407 --> 55:05.429
Or no, you're wrong.

55:07.231 --> 55:10.396
I think it's getting more and more likely that this was a key.

55:13.223 --> 55:13.923
to the castle.

55:14.144 --> 55:25.210
It was a key to getting people onto a protocol and thinking that their disease was progressing because the result of supplementary oxygen given in an inappropriate way is ARDS.

55:25.271 --> 55:33.576
Of course, the primary severe step to severe COVID is ARDS.

55:34.496 --> 55:40.100
So you can't underestimate how them just dropping that little hint there is all part of this.

55:41.664 --> 55:42.708
It's all part of it.

55:42.748 --> 55:46.463
They gotta get these ideas out there in a way so that they can curate them.

55:48.973 --> 55:57.019
And so curating the narrative about hypoxia is also really important because they want you to think that it's already been addressed, that it's mentioned.

55:57.059 --> 56:04.404
They know they didn't mention what might happen if you had hypoxia and went into a hospital, that it might be misconstrued as COVID.

56:04.745 --> 56:07.447
They were very specific about not saying anything like that.

56:07.487 --> 56:12.971
It's just that masks might not always be as good as we say because sometimes people get hypoxia.

56:13.331 --> 56:14.251
But that's weird, right?

56:14.271 --> 56:19.253
Because Pierre Cory said that like 80% of the people in New York City had hypoxia.

56:21.973 --> 56:27.275
And so you see that they're curating the narrative from different sides with different people that you might not hear Pierre Cory.

56:27.755 --> 56:29.275
He might not have heard Kyle Seidel.

56:30.256 --> 56:31.456
Maybe you only heard this guy.

56:32.236 --> 56:38.738
Maybe you've been listening to Vance Crowe because of his extended resume with the World Bank and with Monsanto.

56:38.798 --> 56:39.078
I don't know.

56:41.561 --> 56:43.542
But they're asking really a lot of dumb questions.

56:43.602 --> 56:45.743
And I think they probably do that for the whole hour.

56:45.803 --> 56:48.925
And this is only a month after he was on his show or less than a month.

56:49.005 --> 56:49.585
It's three weeks.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.827
This is definitely narrative curation here.

56:53.187 --> 56:54.368
There's no other way to see it.

56:55.008 --> 56:57.390
And these people are the players that were put in front of us.

56:57.650 --> 56:59.231
This is the operational areas.

57:00.251 --> 57:03.453
Many of his people are probably socializing after work at the local bar.

57:03.473 --> 57:07.115
I mean, you tend to have these large factories that are in rural America.

57:08.239 --> 57:10.681
there's probably not a lot of places for them to go afterwards.

57:10.701 --> 57:14.925
So you tend to get a big community, you know, collection points in certain local restaurants and bars.

57:14.965 --> 57:16.006
That's probably where it's spreading.

57:16.046 --> 57:20.470
It's probably not spreading on the production lines, but you raise a good point that not a lot of them are getting sick.

57:20.810 --> 57:22.912
That was seen on the USS Roosevelt.

57:23.052 --> 57:24.693
That was seen in the Diamond Princess.

57:24.773 --> 57:28.036
If you look at both of those cases, those are like Petri dishes that are islands.

57:28.236 --> 57:33.100
I mean, he was asking the question there of whether the meat supply was being contaminated with coronavirus or not.

57:33.160 --> 57:33.921
You see that, right?

57:34.401 --> 57:36.043
That's already being seeded there as well.

57:37.642 --> 57:43.725
And maybe part of their plan was to use coronavirus as an excuse to disrupt the supply chain, and now they're pivoting to a flu.

57:43.985 --> 57:44.446
I don't know.

57:44.926 --> 57:57.812
But I do know that it's very odd that all of these little pieces of the narrative that we still seem to be thinking are shiny objects are present in this May 12th interview with Kevin McKernan.

57:58.773 --> 57:59.633
They're contained.

58:00.314 --> 58:06.717
And something like 82% of the people were clearly exposed because they were held in the tightest quarters you could ever imagine.

58:07.199 --> 58:08.520
and they didn't come down with a sickness.

58:09.521 --> 58:10.022
So why?

58:10.722 --> 58:12.304
Why are they not getting sick?

58:12.344 --> 58:15.467
If you jam that many people, I think it was close to 5,000 people.

58:15.607 --> 58:18.650
Maybe because an RNA doesn't spread like that.

58:19.891 --> 58:29.260
Maybe because these signals are being misconstrued as a risk additive spreading pathogen, but they're actually just molecular biological signals that were planted.

58:33.834 --> 58:40.881
They could have been planted in the tests, in the diagnostics, or in the patients, or on the surfaces, or wherever they wanted.

58:41.241 --> 58:43.343
In the tubes, in the reagents.

58:44.304 --> 58:45.945
DNA is very stable.

58:50.229 --> 58:50.750
RNA isn't.

58:54.343 --> 58:54.643
The U.S.

58:54.683 --> 58:59.485
is Roosevelt, and the density at which they stack those people is like tighter than New York City.

58:59.905 --> 59:08.088
Oh, I used to live on a ship, and they're living in soldier conditions where they don't have to try and convince young college kids to go work there.

59:08.528 --> 59:09.348
It is cramped.

59:09.908 --> 59:11.069
He used to live on a ship?

59:11.109 --> 59:12.609
Does that mean he worked in the Navy?

59:12.969 --> 59:16.330
Oh my gosh, please tell me it means he worked in the Navy.

59:16.771 --> 59:18.071
You gotta be kidding me.

59:18.331 --> 59:19.251
Right on top of each other.

59:19.271 --> 59:20.892
You're taking a shower in an area that

59:21.352 --> 59:24.094
your shoulders are so broad they'll touch both walls.

59:24.134 --> 59:25.615
Like it is super tight in there.

59:25.635 --> 59:26.835
Social distancing is impossible.

59:26.875 --> 59:34.159
So anyone in those ships is fully exposed and only 17% of them are coming down with... Is that right?

59:34.179 --> 59:46.966
Because last we left the story of the ship, it was like waving goodbye to the ship captain that absolutely broke all the protocols and these poor soldiers were basically left on the ship to die and then we didn't hear anything about it.

59:47.146 --> 59:48.247
So what did end up happening?

59:49.551 --> 59:51.392
This is all just narrative curation.

59:51.432 --> 59:55.174
We're asking the questions that these guys agree are interesting to ask.

59:56.035 --> 01:00:03.480
And if the questions that they are asking were queued up as part of a national security operation, then you actually understand what's going on.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.981
It's not really complicated.

01:00:06.682 --> 01:00:10.204
It's just as simple as Matt and Kira lying to Freddie.

01:00:11.925 --> 01:00:14.907
If two or more people agree to lie to you, you're in big trouble.

01:00:15.607 --> 01:00:16.928
I mean, really big trouble.

01:00:20.157 --> 01:00:21.178
happening there.

01:00:21.198 --> 01:00:25.100
Yeah, there's a good video to point your audience to.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.301
I think it's from someone at Rockefeller University.

01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:33.604
It's about a 12-minute video that walks through the numbers on the Diamond Princess and on that cruise ship.

01:00:34.485 --> 01:00:43.770
And the numbers line up pretty close between the Diamond Princess and the USS Roosevelt of having over 80% of the people not getting sick despite being exposed.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:45.871
And then you look at the prisons.

01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:52.493
I'll send you a link on the prison studies.

01:00:52.513 --> 01:00:53.774
This place is tracking all the prisons.

01:00:53.794 --> 01:00:58.655
And one of these studies, it was like over 1,900 cases and only 10 deaths.

01:00:59.235 --> 01:01:01.055
So that's down at 1%.

01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:06.116
And prison environments, they're not getting a lot of vitamin D there.

01:01:06.256 --> 01:01:09.136
This is probably poor looting conditions.

01:01:09.156 --> 01:01:10.337
They don't get outside much.

01:01:10.357 --> 01:01:14.737
Their immune systems are probably destroyed from being indoors and contained all day.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:17.538
And even there, it's hard to get the numbers up to 1%.

01:01:19.758 --> 01:01:20.299
Oh, really?

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:26.161
I was expecting you to say, hey, the reason their numbers are over 1% is because they're vitamin D deficient.

01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:28.262
I thought you set up yourself in the argument.

01:01:28.322 --> 01:01:34.804
It could be, but the fact is they're contained and everyone's got to be getting it and only a very small number of them are dying.

01:01:35.064 --> 01:01:35.704
What does that say?

01:01:35.724 --> 01:01:39.286
I would imagine ... I don't know the ...

01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:43.635
He said that they must all be getting it.

01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:46.216
They must all be getting it, but none of them are dying.

01:01:46.356 --> 01:01:48.877
That assumption is part of this narrative.

01:01:49.357 --> 01:01:52.777
They don't have evidence that all the prison populations are getting COVID.

01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:54.978
What kind of nonsense is this?

01:01:55.558 --> 01:02:04.300
But we can assume that all the people on the cruise ship are exposed, just like we can assume all the people on a Navy ship are exposed.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360
We can assume that all the people in

01:02:07.702 --> 01:02:11.445
Insert your assumption here about assumption here.

01:02:13.607 --> 01:02:15.649
And so they're agreeing that this is true.

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:18.612
There's an illusion of consensus, obviously.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:19.693
I mean, I was on a ship.

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:22.655
But it's just lying.

01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:25.618
It's just a spectacular commitment to a mythology.

01:02:26.218 --> 01:02:28.060
And that's why these guys are doing it.

01:02:29.081 --> 01:02:31.483
You should be confused and made just like I was.

01:02:33.544 --> 01:02:41.187
when I was on my fifth podcast in a row with Paul Cuttrell and Kevin McCairn and Addy Adds.

01:02:43.688 --> 01:02:44.749
But he's not confused.

01:02:44.769 --> 01:02:46.289
He already knows where we're going.

01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:48.430
He already knows what his job is.

01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.831
Promote yourself, promote these ideas.

01:02:51.891 --> 01:02:53.612
Promote yourself, promote these ideas.

01:02:53.692 --> 01:02:55.693
Promote your expertise, promote these ideas.

01:02:56.721 --> 01:02:58.403
And he's been doing that for four years straight.

01:02:58.443 --> 01:02:59.744
He did it twice on my show.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:06.710
The crazy thing is if you watch the previous recordings with me and him, I think it's the most revealing of all.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.132
Because I know what I was thinking then.

01:03:09.272 --> 01:03:12.975
I know how behind the ball I was and I know how much I looked up to him.

01:03:13.936 --> 01:03:16.939
I haven't bothered to roll that out yet because it's such a nuclear bomb.

01:03:18.046 --> 01:03:22.288
I mean, at any point in time, we could just kind of end this, but nobody's paying attention yet.

01:03:22.348 --> 01:03:32.292
So we need more people to share this work, more people to get people to listen to the introduction so that they understand exactly what I'm accusing these people of being a part of.

01:03:33.112 --> 01:03:38.235
I don't want to pull any more punches because I've got a stage coming in a couple of weeks.

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:41.216
I don't want anybody to be surprised at what they hear.

01:03:45.683 --> 01:03:49.165
I'm going for the throat, because I don't think we have much more time.

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.266
Demographics of those.

01:03:50.306 --> 01:04:02.253
But we do know there is a high incident of African-American imprisonment, more so on drugs than an equal number of people, if you're Caucasian, getting caught for drugs for the same crime.

01:04:02.273 --> 01:04:07.637
There's something like a 48-fold higher rate of getting incarcerated if you're African-American for the same crime.

01:04:08.197 --> 01:04:10.078
Jeez, Vance says.

01:04:10.278 --> 01:04:11.079
Jeez.

01:04:11.219 --> 01:04:12.560
Like, are we really serious?

01:04:13.922 --> 01:04:14.943
Are we really serious?

01:04:15.043 --> 01:04:17.967
Are you really learning that for the first time, you jackass?

01:04:18.607 --> 01:04:19.689
You see what they do?

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:27.357
They create this illusion of revealing, this illusion of I'll acknowledge something and everybody knows, then I'll say something dumb.

01:04:27.718 --> 01:04:30.481
Then I'll acknowledge something, everybody knows, then I'll say something dumb.

01:04:32.523 --> 01:04:34.305
But it's not saying something dumb.

01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:52.658
It's saying something carefully crafted to make sure that we got on board with the Scooby-Doo mystery so that by the end of this, we would have bought it as a gain of function lab leak that required people to go a little bit crazy with regard to getting compliance, required the government to lock down as hard as they did.

01:04:54.218 --> 01:04:59.840
And I think the reason why they're off script is because they were forced to rush the shot and that was never part of the plan.

01:05:00.681 --> 01:05:04.402
That's why a lot of them were talking about two or three years before a vaccine would be ready.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:13.041
Make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, I am suggesting that we are way off script.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.801
And these people are behaving exactly as they are because of how far off script we are.

01:05:20.721 --> 01:05:27.743
And the only thing they have to rely on is that the illusion on social media will be maintained by the programming.

01:05:28.323 --> 01:05:39.405
Because if enough people see that they promote specifically each other and specifically when each other is preaching about these ideas, then it will be obvious that these people are playing against us.

01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:40.465
They are not heroes.

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:41.766
They are not on white horses.

01:05:41.826 --> 01:05:42.866
Their horses are black.

01:05:51.015 --> 01:05:53.137
despite the fact that drug use doesn't differ between the two.

01:05:53.197 --> 01:05:58.841
So there's clearly racism involved in prosecution and involved in who's getting incarcerated.

01:05:59.761 --> 01:06:04.665
And so there's interesting studies in Norway, and I think it's Norway and Sweden.

01:06:05.466 --> 01:06:06.767
It's a Nordic country.

01:06:06.827 --> 01:06:08.468
I've got to get the right country on this.

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:12.831
But there are African-Americans, and I shouldn't even say African-Americans.

01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:16.194
There are people of dark skin that live in northern latitudes, and they're the most

01:06:17.424 --> 01:06:21.506
de-deficient folks in the world because they're not getting the sun that they're used to.

01:06:22.666 --> 01:06:25.448
And they're seeing higher rates of COVID fatality amongst them.

01:06:25.528 --> 01:06:27.149
So I imagine that same thing's going on.

01:06:27.169 --> 01:06:30.490
So they're not getting the normal amount of sun that they're used to?

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.992
What about the people of dark skin that were born in those countries?

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:35.372
What the hell is he talking about?

01:06:37.553 --> 01:06:41.715
Are we about to pivot to the hint that, ooh, maybe it's targeted to certain races?

01:06:42.195 --> 01:06:43.276
Maybe that explains it.

01:06:45.558 --> 01:06:46.899
You see what the debate is now?

01:06:46.959 --> 01:07:08.233
They're already seeding the narrative that maybe there are certain groups that are gonna get affected, but they're never gonna come to the realization that Denny Rancor said it was only poor people, and that it respected county borders, and that people with serious disabilities or income disparities were the ones that were getting murdered in the hospital.

01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:09.654
It's really weird, right?

01:07:10.976 --> 01:07:18.002
All these little pieces just falling out of his mouth at random in May 2020, but he's focused on cannabis genome stuff.

01:07:18.022 --> 01:07:19.062
I mean, I'm busy all day.

01:07:19.563 --> 01:07:23.085
Now I'm busy all day sequencing SARS virus, make sure that it's not there.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.188
So how is he sequencing it then?

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:27.893
Is he using a control?

01:07:28.573 --> 01:07:30.394
Oh, oh, okay.

01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:31.255
I wonder what that's all.

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:40.240
You know, you see, it's already, he's already bamboozled Vance and Vance is happy to be bamboozled because this guy used to work for the Human Genome Project.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.841
I just hope I can keep up for an hour.

01:07:43.782 --> 01:07:45.703
It's wonderful once you see it.

01:07:45.823 --> 01:07:46.664
It's just blatant.

01:07:46.804 --> 01:07:55.109
This video and the videos related to it from April, May, and December of 2020 are all still on YouTube to watch.

01:07:57.133 --> 01:08:00.355
Apparently he wasn't off script enough to get censored.

01:08:06.198 --> 01:08:11.641
Mark's four minute video about Pierre Cory was censored in minutes after he posted it.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:12.362
Minutes.

01:08:14.383 --> 01:08:14.903
Minutes.

01:08:17.865 --> 01:08:21.807
These highly controversial takes have been present on YouTube for four years.

01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:32.111
went on in prisons.

01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:33.132
Wow.

01:08:33.352 --> 01:08:37.093
That community's might indeed be deficient and they would be particularly prone to this.

01:08:37.133 --> 01:08:40.255
And yet we're not seeing Wow.

01:08:40.275 --> 01:08:45.377
We're seeing fairly suppressed exposure to this.

01:08:45.597 --> 01:08:50.639
So they are also terribly malnourished and all these other things like what is he talking about?

01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:54.400
It's an illusion of consensus.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:54.480
Wow.

01:08:55.141 --> 01:08:58.442
So everybody else listening says to Kevin Wow.

01:09:01.727 --> 01:09:03.128
What is it with vitamin D?

01:09:03.168 --> 01:09:04.869
I mean, all of a sudden that hit.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:06.851
I saw Matt Ridley talking about it.

01:09:06.931 --> 01:09:16.879
I've heard people, you know, trying to, and it's like, it, it, it feel, it felt at first like Matt Ridley, you mean Matt Ridley, the one that wrote a book with Alina Chan?

01:09:17.699 --> 01:09:20.722
Is that, is that the Matt Ridley you mean?

01:09:20.762 --> 01:09:21.362
Where is that?

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:24.605
I think it actually is.

01:09:24.705 --> 01:09:26.386
I think it's actually this book right here.

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:30.189
Matt Ridley, before the book is written, he's mentioning Matt Ridley.

01:09:31.261 --> 01:09:31.681
Really?

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:52.815
The one that would coordinate with the Broad Institute scientist named Helena Chan, who's never had a position in her life, went from postdoc to staff scientist at the Broad Institute because she had a preprint that never got published about the supposed evolution or non-evolution of the SARS-2 virus compared to the SARS-1 virus?

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:53.656
That one?

01:09:55.402 --> 01:09:57.003
Liars, ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:58.765
Positioned with book sales.

01:09:58.965 --> 01:09:59.585
Liars.

01:09:59.706 --> 01:10:02.127
Positioned with media elevation.

01:10:02.228 --> 01:10:08.452
Liars with programmed relevance on social media.

01:10:08.493 --> 01:10:11.255
These people are part of the show.

01:10:12.135 --> 01:10:15.738
And that's why Vance is mentioning him now.

01:10:15.838 --> 01:10:18.360
Because he was cued up to be part of the show.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:30.513
just like Alina, just like Drastic, just like George Webb, just like Robert Malone, just like Meryl Nass, just like they're all were present and on purpose.

01:10:33.614 --> 01:10:35.135
Nobody's coming to our rescue.

01:10:36.323 --> 01:10:41.609
Nobody on social media that was censored and whatever is coming to our rescue.

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:52.020
It's the people who are still censored, still haven't risen, have a proven record of four years of integrity and have admitted that they made mistakes and that cost people lives.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.623
Anybody that doesn't say that is a liar.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:04.255
We're talking one step above essential oils or get your Vita-C pack.

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.895
It's easy to throw to everyone.

01:11:05.915 --> 01:11:10.558
The FDA likes to downplay anything that could be a nutraceutical.

01:11:11.758 --> 01:11:13.279
People have been talking about vitamin D for a while.

01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:15.720
Nick Szabo has been pushing on this quite a bit.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.781
He's really involved in the

01:11:17.561 --> 01:11:20.622
are early on in the Bitcoin space and he caught on to a lot of these papers really early.

01:11:20.662 --> 01:11:22.862
I started reading them and it helps boost your immune system.

01:11:23.703 --> 01:11:27.123
So if you can boost your immune system cheaply, hey, that's the thing to do.

01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:30.784
So Bitcoin space mentioned, isn't that wonderful?

01:11:30.844 --> 01:11:35.705
He also wants to use blockchain for publishing too.

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:37.366
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.587
thinks blockchain is great because it's going to save us too.

01:11:42.607 --> 01:11:44.648
That's how it all works, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:46.008
That's what's happening right now.

01:11:47.978 --> 01:11:55.915
You ever thought about the fact that maybe if Donald Trump just said he wanted to go back to being a TV guy with The Apprentice, that maybe all this would go away?

01:12:01.428 --> 01:12:04.209
There's a theater, ladies and gentlemen, and you are seeing it.

01:12:04.789 --> 01:12:09.250
You are staring at the brick wall behind you, behind the theater.

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.150
The scenery is visible.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:22.833
And these people provided the cognitive scenery that we thought was a lively debate about our future, but it was actually a limited spectrum of debate.

01:12:23.453 --> 01:12:33.478
curated by these people that were put in place at the beginning of the pandemic or before so that trusted sources of information could be used to curate the narrative where we are now.

01:12:35.099 --> 01:12:40.882
And they're off script because it should have taken longer for us to get to the stage where Epigirl was wrapping in Geneva.

01:12:41.622 --> 01:12:45.784
That was supposed to happen in 2030, but it's happened already.

01:12:47.472 --> 01:12:55.034
So we've advanced quite a few seasons in this sitcom of the macabre, and it's because they are off script trying to catch up to us.

01:12:55.114 --> 01:13:04.417
We've gotten several dominoes ahead of them by saying that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system was always dumb.

01:13:05.237 --> 01:13:09.639
From the time of Hilary Koprowski all the way till now, it has always been dumb.

01:13:11.439 --> 01:13:14.240
And more of us are making the argument that they've always known that.

01:13:15.546 --> 01:13:28.498
and an illusion of consensus created by a few people like, I don't know, David Baltimore, Hillary Kaprowski, Stanley Plotkin, what's the prion guy's name?

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:33.463
What is his name?

01:13:34.003 --> 01:13:34.664
God dang it.

01:13:34.884 --> 01:13:40.289
Anyway, all those people that trained with all those people, Gallo, Fauci's just descended from them.

01:13:41.158 --> 01:13:48.069
protecting the same set of lies, the same mythology upon which the criminal vaccine schedule in America is based.

01:13:49.632 --> 01:13:53.679
And slowly but surely, these people are in charge of rolling us to that conclusion.

01:13:55.114 --> 01:14:09.487
But at the same time, pulling the bait and switch like in Indiana Jones, where they substitute the mRNA for the old vaccine schedule, but with the caveat that we admit the old vaccine schedule was shit.

01:14:09.567 --> 01:14:13.371
And we admit that we rolled this out too fast because we thought it was a gate of function virus.

01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:14.772
So we had to make sure.

01:14:19.363 --> 01:14:21.225
That's why they were there, ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:21.245 --> 01:14:22.125
That was their job.

01:14:22.326 --> 01:14:28.431
That's why he sounds like such a dickhead.

01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:34.396
So that's the easiest and cheapest thing Americans can do to pump up their immunity.

01:14:34.476 --> 01:14:41.562
And it's probably also why a lot of these viruses disappear in the summer, is that people get out more, they get more sun, they get vitamin D levels up.

01:14:41.662 --> 01:14:44.565
But in the wintertime, everyone's vitamin D deficient in northern latitudes.

01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:48.067
And so there's a higher likelihood of these viruses causing grief.

01:14:49.147 --> 01:14:50.968
I think that's one reason why we're probably seeing it.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:58.172
So now we're not questioning whether there are viruses or to what extent they are available in the background or responsible for disease.

01:14:58.772 --> 01:15:07.317
Now we're just arguing about the subtleties of how prevalent they are given vitamin D levels and hot and warm and sunshine and not.

01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:08.597
And so what are we doing?

01:15:08.617 --> 01:15:12.099
We're asking the wrong questions because these people are liars.

01:15:12.519 --> 01:15:13.140
Stop lying!

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.283
That's all you need to know.

01:15:15.304 --> 01:15:17.127
He's lying.

01:15:17.288 --> 01:15:20.374
They are agreeing to lie about the relevance of these questions.

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:24.062
They are agreeing to lie about the relevance of these discussions.

01:15:25.441 --> 01:15:36.485
Because as long as you're trapped in these hamster wheels, you're never usefully questioning the actual fidelity, the actual existence of SARS-CoV-2.

01:15:37.206 --> 01:15:51.351
And the only useful people that were questioning the existence of SARS-CoV-2 at this time were noticeably people like Andrew Kaufman, who I am absolutely sure is not

01:15:54.568 --> 01:15:55.188
he says he is.

01:15:55.849 --> 01:16:02.572
I don't know what he's doing, who he plays for, but this is not a person who was really trying to save our grandchildren.

01:16:02.632 --> 01:16:06.514
He was taking care of his own first himself, playing a role.

01:16:06.574 --> 01:16:12.357
That's why there's a photograph of him shaking Andrew Cuomo's hand before the pandemic as part of a

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:24.124
a grant award thing where he was getting an award to develop a biometric device to monitor potential suicidal behavior in prison populations.

01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:37.028
That Andrew Kaufman, all part of the same crew of people, all part of the same national security operation that was planning to use the crisis in America

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:48.379
to convince Australia to lock down, New Zealand to lock down, to convince other countries in this network to behave in a certain way because of what happened in America.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:56.185
America was used, there were victims and there were fraud that was created in America because we have the best control over America and its media.

01:16:56.785 --> 01:17:01.348
And then those ideas were projected around the world in order to create the illusion of a pandemic.

01:17:01.769 --> 01:17:02.990
Who's responsible for it?

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:07.193
I don't know, but most likely it's traitors to our own US government like,

01:17:07.833 --> 01:17:14.845
Kevin McKernan, who was able to take intellectual property out of the Human Genome Project and start his own company.

01:17:14.885 --> 01:17:18.071
And so who does he owe everything that he has?

01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:19.193
He owes the U.S.

01:17:19.233 --> 01:17:19.673
government.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.702
He owes the U.S.

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:23.763
Department of Energy.

01:17:23.783 --> 01:17:25.004
He owes MIT.

01:17:25.104 --> 01:17:26.966
He owes the Broad Institute.

01:17:26.986 --> 01:17:27.807
He doesn't owe us.

01:17:28.547 --> 01:17:33.392
He doesn't owe his hometown or the people that came to his store and bought his goods.

01:17:34.133 --> 01:17:36.915
He owes NIH, Tony Fauci.

01:17:37.336 --> 01:17:40.639
He owes Francis Collins, and he owes his father.

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:51.952
And yet here he is in April and May of 2020, pretending to be an entrepreneur who didn't get anything from his father besides, uh, besides, uh, three meals a day.

01:17:54.213 --> 01:18:08.063
And who doesn't owe anything to anybody, you know, like Francis Collins or anybody else that he's been in photographs with, even though he was allowed to take IP out of the human genome project and make millions multi-generational wealth from it.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:19.964
when his father was already making multi-generational wealth as a part of the biosecurity state, the pharmaceutical companies, whatever you want to call it, weaponized piles of money of various sizes.

01:18:23.886 --> 01:18:27.308
Traders, ladies and gentlemen, that's the only way to see the Americans involved in this.

01:18:27.348 --> 01:18:28.048
They are traders.

01:18:28.088 --> 01:18:29.369
They're playing for somebody else.

01:18:35.972 --> 01:18:36.833
It's fade away right now.

01:18:40.153 --> 01:18:42.675
The obvious question is did people overreact?

01:18:42.815 --> 01:18:51.644
If what you're saying is it's vitamin D deficiency and it's not that fatal, did the decisions we made, was this the wrong way to go?

01:18:51.704 --> 01:18:53.005
Yeah, I think we did.

01:18:53.085 --> 01:18:57.349
When you look at the Ferguson models, all of these things were going off of R0.

01:18:58.030 --> 01:19:03.232
are not as a reproductive number that assumes the population that the disease is entering has zero immunity to it.

01:19:04.052 --> 01:19:16.117
But what's really happened is, and what a lot of epidemiologists would point to, is you have to go after RE, which E has to do with what portion of the population is actually susceptible.

01:19:16.177 --> 01:19:22.160
So if there's any previous immunity to this in the population, it puts the brakes on the spread of the virus quite quickly.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:22.960
In fact, Michael,

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.821
Levitt's been presenting a lot of this work too.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:29.403
He's a former, what year did he get the Nobel Prize?

01:19:29.423 --> 01:19:31.724
I think 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

01:19:32.505 --> 01:19:33.325
Really smart guy.

01:19:33.745 --> 01:19:40.749
He's been publishing all of these models, tracking the virus, and he's been demonstrating quite elegantly that it's not exponential.

01:19:40.789 --> 01:19:45.871
So isn't that interesting that a Nobel Prize winner is demonstrating that the spread is not exponential?

01:19:45.931 --> 01:19:51.514
So accepting the spread, accepting the molecular biological exaggeration of fidelity,

01:19:52.114 --> 01:19:55.775
accepting that we don't have any data from 2020 to see how prevalent it is.

01:19:56.616 --> 01:20:04.818
And the last podcast that Kevin was on, he said that it was in the background for 40 to 80 years, probably circulating in the background of China where nobody was sequencing.

01:20:06.479 --> 01:20:08.420
Think about how far he's come in a month now.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.580
He doesn't say that anymore.

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.480
I don't want to say that.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.721
That might, that might goof things up.

01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:18.772
So the more nuanced thing now is we have to talk about not R-naught, but R-E.

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:21.173
I guess that didn't really catch on very well.

01:20:21.193 --> 01:20:22.534
It was too complicated for people.

01:20:22.574 --> 01:20:25.296
So he introduced that, but it didn't really start very well.

01:20:25.336 --> 01:20:31.940
And now he's plugging some Nobel prize winner who's suggesting that the models aren't right, or it's not linear.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.561
It's linear, not exponential.

01:20:33.681 --> 01:20:40.625
Or again, the limited spectrum of debate is always asking wrong questions and then vigorously debating.

01:20:40.685 --> 01:20:43.127
And then everything that he promotes is that.

01:20:44.642 --> 01:20:47.565
And it's been that way with all of these people since the very beginning.

01:20:47.605 --> 01:20:54.613
That's why Jessica Rose was hot on the gain of function spike, the same as Kevin McCairn, the same as has Walter Chestnut.

01:20:54.713 --> 01:21:05.164
All of these people wittingly or unwittingly were buying into the Scooby-Doo and then amplified and gained comfort and some social media acceptance because of it.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.522
But there's no way that Jessica Rose doesn't know what she's doing.

01:21:09.562 --> 01:21:16.729
There's no way that Robert Malone doesn't know, or Meryl Nass, or even Kevin McKernan, or Kevin McCarran, or Charles Rixey, they all know.

01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:23.975
They all know because they're all part of a coordinated group of liars that is part of this national security operation.

01:21:25.257 --> 01:21:27.579
It's also why the only thing they can do is ignore me.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.141
There's nothing to sue.

01:21:31.222 --> 01:21:32.303
The truth isn't slander.

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:42.824
Everyone's assuming this thing's going to go exponential, but it's never hit an exponential rate in any of the countries.

01:21:42.904 --> 01:21:44.785
So something's putting the brakes on this.

01:21:45.585 --> 01:21:54.770
I think what's putting the brakes on this is all the papers that we're seeing come out showing that the former coronaviruses that have gone through the population are providing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:57.871
Oh my gosh, did you hear it?

01:21:58.191 --> 01:22:00.352
There are antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

01:22:00.653 --> 01:22:12.258
So this super, super genius molecular biologist seems to be unaware that Stanley Perlman had a whole series of papers after the original SARS virus that showed actually antibodies don't do shit.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:24.424
And it's the T cell immunity to conserved regions of coronaviruses like the RNA dependent RNA polymerase that are responsible for the clearance of disease as far as his disease model went.

01:22:26.314 --> 01:22:33.257
And yet here he is vomiting the same Francis Collins nonsense, the same correlative immunity.

01:22:33.297 --> 01:22:35.338
We get antibodies from previous.

01:22:35.899 --> 01:22:45.343
So then the whole argument about whether or not you have antibodies, and that is an indication of previous immunity, is exactly what this jackass wants you to believe.

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:51.766
Exactly what he is teaching young people right before they're faced with having to go back to college or saying no.

01:22:51.786 --> 01:22:55.088
Stop lying!

01:22:56.052 --> 01:22:59.714
This is malevolence and its highest form.

01:23:01.936 --> 01:23:06.639
Coordinated lying is malevolence in its highest form.

01:23:08.941 --> 01:23:18.247
Fifth generation warfare is a way to make sure that the skilled TV watching public, the skilled social media users never realize it's that simple.

01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:23.846
Just like Matt and Kira lying to Freddy about Minecraft, it's the same thing.

01:23:23.886 --> 01:23:27.669
When these people agree to lie, it doesn't matter if Vance knows or not.

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:37.295
As long as McKernan and Rose and everybody that they are able to co-opt, like Corey and McCullough,

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:51.399
are all on the same page and understand that, you know, you can complain about the shot, you can complain about the spike protein, you can complain about gain of function, but just don't ever question the possibility that we're just murdering people and lying about it.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.961
You know, a really simple explanation that fits.

01:23:58.962 --> 01:23:59.462
Don't want that.

01:24:03.948 --> 01:24:07.051
and with the story that is novel.

01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:22.405
So when that word was being used, this is one of those situations where, you know, a philosophical background is really valuable because you start saying, hey, if we're going to have a term that we add into the environment, everybody should understand what that term actually means.

01:24:22.885 --> 01:24:27.327
Because everybody around me was using it because, oh, it's like COVID or corona.

01:24:27.367 --> 01:24:29.808
You told me that's what we call it, so that's what we call it.

01:24:29.848 --> 01:24:31.649
But they called it a novel coronavirus.

01:24:32.270 --> 01:24:35.531
And for the people that were like me, I don't know to push back on that.

01:24:35.551 --> 01:24:37.772
It could have been like the pink coronavirus.

01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:39.473
It wouldn't have mattered.

01:24:39.613 --> 01:24:47.277
But it actually has meaning in the rest of the—it has an implication that we ended up taking on as far as how we reacted to the disease.

01:24:47.637 --> 01:24:48.257
Absolutely did.

01:24:48.477 --> 01:24:50.118
And we should never do that again.

01:24:50.178 --> 01:24:55.041
Just because something is new from an RNA standpoint does not mean that it's new to our immune system.

01:24:55.501 --> 01:24:58.262
And this is a bit of what goes on in publication bias.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:25:00.123
I don't think there is any malfeasance here.

01:25:00.163 --> 01:25:04.385
I think what happens is someone discovers a new coronavirus and that becomes publication meat.

01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.106
Hey, look, I found something new.

01:25:06.266 --> 01:25:14.790
So they would never have created the illusion of pandemic potential by just creating the actual publications and funding them.

01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:17.311
No way.

01:25:17.351 --> 01:25:19.213
There's no bad intentions here.

01:25:19.253 --> 01:25:21.054
There's no bad actors here.

01:25:25.497 --> 01:25:27.719
It's so simple once you see it.

01:25:27.779 --> 01:25:37.086
The only thing they won't consider is that the biosecurity state would lie about pandemic potential in order to enslave our children.

01:25:37.526 --> 01:25:41.609
It's the only possibility that they just can't seem to consider.

01:25:43.106 --> 01:25:51.007
Even though it's a real simple explanation that explains everything in one fell swoop, they just can't seem to get there because they had something strange too.

01:25:51.107 --> 01:25:52.088
I had something strange.

01:25:52.148 --> 01:25:53.588
Meryl says she had it three times.

01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:56.268
He had something strange, I'm sure.

01:25:56.748 --> 01:25:57.529
Didn't he say that?

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.629
Yeah, he said that in the first podcast in April.

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.029
It's unbelievable.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:05.830
It's so easy to see it now, we just have to keep hammering.

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:08.330
You can't get into a journal and say it's new, it's never been seen before.

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:11.671
But if you come out saying, eh, it's kind of been seen before,

01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:13.863
doesn't get published as readily.

01:26:14.063 --> 01:26:18.404
So the truth is that we've got ancestry on this thing.

01:26:19.624 --> 01:26:24.565
We know that it has relationships to rat G13, but those are 40 to 70 years ago.

01:26:24.585 --> 01:26:28.266
So it's a huge missing link that we spoke about in the last podcast of 40 to 70 years.

01:26:28.326 --> 01:26:37.268
We don't know how long this has been in bats and how long it's been over in humans, but the assumption was that the first person they ever sequenced in Wuhan was a zoonotic event or close to it.

01:26:37.328 --> 01:26:37.448
And I

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:44.196
I just don't think there's really any evidence for that when you consider coronaviruses have been floating around mammals for ages.

01:26:45.357 --> 01:26:49.261
And now the antibody studies are coming out showing that there's more.

01:26:49.562 --> 01:26:52.725
It's been here either longer than we think or spread further than we anticipated.

01:26:54.006 --> 01:26:58.291
And even those antibody studies, I think, are underestimating the spread.

01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:00.733
Because when you design these antibody tests,

01:27:01.474 --> 01:27:06.436
You have to go through some work on an exclusivity and inclusivity study, usually.

01:27:06.516 --> 01:27:15.639
What you do is you get a bunch of SARS viruses and show that, look, my test picks up these SARS viruses, but it doesn't pick up MERS, and it doesn't pick up SARS-1.

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:19.981
So you spend all this time making antibodies that are really, really specific to track the current virus.

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.882
That's a great thing for tracking the current virus.

01:27:22.677 --> 01:27:31.165
But if you want to know about the immunity that might be out there, you actually want an antibody test that's going to pick up, is this person going to be immune to this or not?

01:27:31.185 --> 01:27:33.568
Well, then you might need to survey all the old coronaviruses.

01:27:33.908 --> 01:27:34.729
That's incredible.

01:27:34.789 --> 01:27:41.495
So he's still making this elaborate attempt to assure you that antibodies are absolutely primal to immunity.

01:27:42.096 --> 01:27:45.257
that you can make specific antibodies and nonspecific antibodies.

01:27:45.297 --> 01:27:54.881
And if the tests are looking for specific antibodies, they might not actually pick up your previous existing antibodies to other coronaviruses and therefore miss preexisting immunity.

01:27:54.921 --> 01:28:03.644
And so now we can ask this question over and over again in many different forms, and we can get Vance to think that it's a really interesting question and all his viewers will too.

01:28:04.064 --> 01:28:04.925
And then all of a sudden,

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:17.857
It's 2021 and half of your friends have gotten the shot because you were never usefully informed in a way that allowed you to extricate yourself from the national security narrative.

01:28:19.818 --> 01:28:20.699
That's why he's there.

01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:24.842
That's why he was never deleted from YouTube.

01:28:25.082 --> 01:28:28.745
That's why the podcaster worked for Monsanto and the World Bank, probably.

01:28:29.785 --> 01:28:30.406
And on a ship.

01:28:34.451 --> 01:28:46.185
It's hard to believe that it's this easy, ladies and gentlemen, but if you cannot see it for the liars that they are a patient may have seen I just suggest you got more watching and listening to more reading that are applicable to this one.

01:28:47.307 --> 01:28:53.014
And that was never brought into the models never brought into discussion and now paper after papers coming out, showing that.

01:28:53.638 --> 01:28:56.479
The antibodies to the old viruses are the antibodies.

01:28:56.559 --> 01:28:58.459
Antibodies, antibodies, antibodies.

01:28:58.479 --> 01:29:03.380
And I think those are, that is really the smoking gun on why this thing never went exponential.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.841
And I think that's probably what's behind Michael Leavitt's work.

01:29:07.561 --> 01:29:14.162
So something was released, but it didn't go exponential because we had previous immunity, but it was probably a gain of function virus.

01:29:14.202 --> 01:29:15.702
And that's why later we're going to hear.

01:29:15.902 --> 01:29:19.103
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:29:19.363 --> 01:29:23.184
And why everybody was focused on him for so long, because that's what they wanted.

01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:33.404
And I bet you dollars to donuts that Kevin McKernan still says that Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci are two of the bad guys.

01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:35.532
You're saying it never went exponential.

01:29:35.632 --> 01:29:42.175
I mean, I watch our world in data, you know, I'm, I'm watching those charts come out and they look like they are skyrocketing.

01:29:42.255 --> 01:29:49.638
It looks like, you know, if I turn on the news, they are running a dial that shows, you know, 90,000, a hundred thousand, a million people.

01:29:49.778 --> 01:29:52.979
And for me, I don't know if that's a lot of people or not.

01:29:53.039 --> 01:29:54.160
And I don't mean to be calloused.

01:29:54.220 --> 01:30:01.523
I mean, like, you know, you get up to numbers above 20,000 and it's difficult for the human brain to understand them other than in relative size.

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:14.329
It is, and they're often... And so you wouldn't want to start with something basic like there are about 350 million people in the United States, maybe 340, and every year we lose between 2.7 and 3 million people.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:20.333
You wouldn't want to explain that on any given week we could lose between 55 and 75,000 people depending on what week it is.

01:30:24.363 --> 01:30:27.584
You wouldn't want to give people that very basic context, right?

01:30:27.624 --> 01:30:31.825
Because once you get into these big numbers, I just can't understand it anymore.

01:30:32.225 --> 01:30:38.006
So somebody like Kevin should swoop in with a very simple understanding of how it works in America.

01:30:38.326 --> 01:30:40.046
There's very simple questions.

01:30:40.126 --> 01:30:41.446
How many people are in America?

01:30:41.507 --> 01:30:42.707
How many die every year?

01:30:43.047 --> 01:30:45.307
Do we have any numbers on how many die every week?

01:30:45.347 --> 01:30:46.087
Well, yeah, we do.

01:30:46.468 --> 01:30:53.469
So then you can put it into context very easily, Vance, if you wanted to pull your head out, or Kevin, if you wanted to pull Vance's head out.

01:30:53.831 --> 01:30:54.523
But instead...

01:30:58.834 --> 01:31:06.556
They just agree that, yeah, it's really hard to figure it out because all-cause mortality is really difficult, especially when like hundreds of thousands of people are dying of opioids.

01:31:06.576 --> 01:31:07.796
Putting them on linear scales.

01:31:08.156 --> 01:31:09.976
And suicide and lockdown.

01:31:10.196 --> 01:31:17.398
And in sciences, when you're dealing with exponentials, you put them on log scales so that you can tell if it's linear on a log scale.

01:31:17.758 --> 01:31:19.318
Oh, we need log scales.

01:31:19.818 --> 01:31:20.698
Oh.

01:31:20.838 --> 01:31:23.579
What Michael's work's been showing is that it's not.

01:31:23.739 --> 01:31:28.200
If the PBS NewsHour would have used log scales, then they would have been telling us the truth.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:46.645
oh why didn't i see it holy shit okay ladies and gentlemen so there's some breaks on this thing we don't know what i think it's time i think it's time to call this quits you can see it there's a few more minutes left this whole video and the one that follows is available on peer tube i downloaded them to make sure

01:31:47.325 --> 01:31:56.131
in case they would remove them from YouTube now that we're using them as evidence of the operation that was executed and is still being executed on us.

01:31:56.751 --> 01:32:02.795
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:32:03.376 --> 01:32:11.921
I think these people and others, wittingly and unwittingly, are part of a national security operation which is designed to mislead the young about the

01:32:12.782 --> 01:32:17.924
pandemic potential that exists in nature and in laboratories, both of which is a lie.

01:32:17.984 --> 01:32:26.687
They are based on synthetic biology, synthetic DNA and RNA being transformed and transfected into cell cultures and the resultant

01:32:27.867 --> 01:32:32.351
conditions being called the presence of or the culturing of viruses.

01:32:33.292 --> 01:32:44.623
Very succinctly, we can dismiss RNA virology based on that statement alone, because if you go to PubMed and look for how virology is done, it is almost exclusively done with synthetically created

01:32:45.123 --> 01:32:49.264
DNA and RNA molecules that are then transfected into various cell cultures.

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:54.525
And that's how virus is produced for any cell model or any animal model.

01:32:54.585 --> 01:33:00.207
And that's why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:33:00.647 --> 01:33:02.247
It's based on a bunch of mythology.

01:33:02.607 --> 01:33:09.789
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent, because they have been playing with this technology on academic biological benches for decades.

01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:23.093
And most of the academic biologists that are currently masquerading as tenure-track professors should have known better, and therefore are kind of guilty for not having figured it out earlier, because RNA cannot pandemic.

01:33:23.133 --> 01:33:26.794
And every one of them did a very basic sort of

01:33:27.814 --> 01:33:40.582
oral exam to get their PhD, where they were most assuredly asked about the DNA to RNA through a ribosome to protein sequence, and what parts of that were high fidelity and what parts weren't.

01:33:41.022 --> 01:33:47.846
And the fact of the matter is, is they should have known just like I took two and a half years to figure out because of so many meddlers.

01:33:48.386 --> 01:33:54.027
that RNA could never pandemic, and we've known that since before the pandemic was declared.

01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:58.949
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group.

01:33:58.969 --> 01:34:04.410
I'm sorry to have to cut short, and this has been Giggle Home Biological.

01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:10.752
If you want to share the stream, the best replays are on Peertube because then you get the musical introduction as well.

01:34:11.492 --> 01:34:11.712
That's

01:34:12.853 --> 01:34:21.501
This is where we talk and you can send me private messages there that I will read.

01:34:22.082 --> 01:34:28.909
And this is where you can find links to support the stream, which I would really and my family would greatly appreciate.

01:34:28.949 --> 01:34:31.051
We're trying very hard to put it all on the line here.

01:34:31.591 --> 01:34:39.504
and we don't have enough subscribers yet, so if you have the means, you can find me also on Substack under the same moniker, getting all biological if that's easier for you.

01:34:39.985 --> 01:34:41.087
Also much appreciated.

01:34:41.127 --> 01:34:42.549
Thank you very much for sharing the stream.

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.492
These are the people that make it possible.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:45.293
See you again tomorrow.
