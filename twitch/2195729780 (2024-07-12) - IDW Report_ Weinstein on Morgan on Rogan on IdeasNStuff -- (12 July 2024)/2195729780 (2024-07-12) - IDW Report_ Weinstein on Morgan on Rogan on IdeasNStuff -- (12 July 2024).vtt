00:37.458 --> 00:40.379
Welcome to Contemporary American History.

00:41.419 --> 00:42.420
I'm Professor Turchison.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.820
You know, a lot of people think history is just facts.

00:45.501 --> 00:47.001
It's just information about the past.

00:47.901 --> 00:48.441
But not me.

00:49.622 --> 00:51.302
I mean, I hold history very sacred.

00:51.662 --> 00:52.123
Sacred.

00:52.903 --> 00:55.404
The way the farmer looks at the earth and he holds it sacred.

00:55.444 --> 00:58.745
The way a Christian takes the Bible and he holds it sacred.

00:58.765 --> 01:01.285
The way a lot of people hold their marriage sacred.

01:01.305 --> 01:02.526
That's how I feel about it.

01:02.906 --> 01:06.247
So why don't we dive right in by interpreting one of the easiest events

01:07.039 --> 01:08.739
in the last 20 years of American history.

01:10.320 --> 01:16.402
Now, can someone tell me why, in 1975, we pulled our troops out of Vietnam?

01:19.102 --> 01:26.104
The failure of Vietnamization to win popular support caused an ongoing erosion of confidence in the various American, but illegal, Saigon regimes.

01:31.146 --> 01:31.686
Is she right?

01:34.497 --> 01:36.901
Because I know that's the popular version of what went on there.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.005
I know a lot of people like to believe that.

01:39.941 --> 01:41.462
I wish I could, but I was there.

01:41.682 --> 01:44.984
I wasn't here in the classroom, hoping I was right, thinking about it.

01:45.204 --> 01:58.411
I was up on my knees in rice paddies with guns, and then we're going up against Charlie, slugging it out with him, while pussies like you were back there partying, putting headbands on, doing drugs, listening to goddamn Beatle albums.

01:59.211 --> 02:03.293
Hey, Professor, take it easy, will you?

02:03.313 --> 02:06.215
I mean, these kids, they were in grade school at the time.

02:06.515 --> 02:08.916
And me, I'm not a fighter.

02:09.369 --> 02:09.889
I'm a lover.

02:15.152 --> 02:19.154
Well, I didn't know you wanted to get involved with the discussion, Mr. Helper.

02:20.794 --> 02:22.996
But since you want to help, maybe you can help me, OK?

02:24.276 --> 02:27.358
You remember that thing we had about 30 years ago called the Korean conflict?

02:28.218 --> 02:30.199
Yeah, where we failed to achieve victory?

02:30.836 --> 02:40.783
How come he didn't cross the 38th parallel... and push those rice eaters back to the Great Wall of China... and take the Birkbeck brick... and nuke them back into the fucking Stonehenge River?

02:41.003 --> 02:41.524
How come?

02:41.544 --> 02:42.284
Tell me why!

02:42.324 --> 02:42.805
Say it!

02:43.105 --> 02:43.785
Say it!

02:44.746 --> 02:45.166
All right.

02:45.186 --> 02:46.247
I'll say it.

02:46.267 --> 02:51.931
Because Truman was too much of a pussywimp... to let MacArthur go in there and blow out those cumming bastards!

02:53.933 --> 02:54.573
Good answer.

02:56.294 --> 02:56.975
Good answer.

02:56.995 --> 02:59.637
I like the way you think.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.642
I'm gonna be watching you.

03:07.085 --> 03:07.665
Good teacher.

03:08.466 --> 03:12.209
He really seems to care about what I have no idea.

03:17.332 --> 03:26.199
Well, I was born down in the Southland Twenty-some-odd years ago

03:34.113 --> 03:52.960
I ran away for the first time When I was only four years old, I'm a free-born man With all my homies on my back I know every inch of the highway Every foot of back road, every metal railroad track

04:14.476 --> 04:35.095
Got a gal in Cincinnati, a little woman in San Antone Always love the gal next door, but anyplace is home I'm a free-born man One of my homies on my back I know every inch of the highway, every foot of the back road, every run of railroad track

04:50.012 --> 05:08.775
Well, I got me a Morton guitar And a Colonel no-toe sack Well, I hocked it about 200 times But I always got it back, I'm a pre-born man Lord, my homie's on my back I know every inch of the highway Every foot of back road, every foot of railroad track

05:39.065 --> 06:01.182
Well, I was born in the Southland Twenty-some odd years ago I ran away for the first time When I was only four years old I'm a free-born man My home is on my back I know every inch of the highway Every foot of back road Every run of railroad track

06:17.102 --> 06:18.663
I think truth is good for kids.

06:19.084 --> 06:22.927
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

06:23.387 --> 06:25.029
We want everybody to feel good.

06:25.169 --> 06:27.411
That's not, that's not the way life is.

06:29.953 --> 06:33.876
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

06:35.678 --> 06:36.398
And I have lied.

06:36.578 --> 06:37.459
I'm sure I'll lie again.

06:37.479 --> 06:38.400
I don't want to lie.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.241
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

06:40.342 --> 06:41.382
I try not to be a liar.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.263
I don't want to be a liar.

06:42.824 --> 06:45.526
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

06:47.657 --> 07:07.830
introduce Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

07:07.850 --> 07:11.552
And then each of us, this incredible,

07:13.666 --> 07:17.469
we have each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

07:21.232 --> 07:39.766
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not it's, you know, measles plus, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because, you know, not that many people die from it.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.068
It's just a big hassle in the end.

07:42.669 --> 07:42.869
But

07:44.033 --> 08:10.178
no one when we have this new pandemic that is you know got seventy five percent mortality and uh it it's not it's that there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs i'm afraid that the latest it's literally turning into worst case scenario worst case scenario just i'm afraid it's literally turning into essentially a worst case scenario i'm afraid

08:11.909 --> 08:15.050
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

08:15.551 --> 08:17.371
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

08:19.352 --> 08:19.732
Isolation?

08:19.752 --> 08:20.092
What was it?

08:20.252 --> 08:21.433
Isolation and purification.

08:23.214 --> 08:23.934
Of the virus?

08:24.014 --> 08:24.214
Yes.

08:25.475 --> 08:27.235
Well, you isolate a virus by

08:33.882 --> 08:36.504
finding a virus which causes a disease.

08:37.164 --> 08:42.048
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

08:42.628 --> 08:52.696
I don't understand what the issue... Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different... No, it depends on how they used it.

08:53.276 --> 08:54.077
Stop lying!

08:54.537 --> 08:56.939
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

09:00.424 --> 09:01.445
Did Dr. Gallo do that?

09:01.525 --> 09:07.549
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

09:07.629 --> 09:09.631
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

09:50.559 --> 09:53.366
The End

10:10.922 --> 10:15.484
Well, here we are again, ladies and gentlemen, trying to wake up a few people every day.

10:18.526 --> 10:23.528
It is an extraordinary moment we are in history where it appears a lot of people are in panic.

10:23.588 --> 10:30.792
They don't really know what to do anymore because, again, they can't talk about the things, the ideas that we're talking about here.

10:30.832 --> 10:37.456
And so there is a coordinated chorus of people just trying to say that I'm nuts or

10:38.815 --> 10:47.497
I don't know, I guess somehow I'm the baddest bad guy, but not for long because, you know, there'll be more bad guys or something like that.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.218
I don't even get it anymore.

10:50.038 --> 11:01.441
I just know for sure we live in very interesting times with a lot of fake people, a lot of people who claim to be doing one job, but are actually probably being paid quite substantially to do another job.

11:02.661 --> 11:06.662
And as long as we are listening to these people, we are going to be vulnerable

11:08.276 --> 11:15.940
to their version of reality, which is, again, the difference between what's perceived to be true and what is actually true.

11:17.501 --> 11:25.165
And I'm afraid that these people have been occupying our consciousness, our attention, for a lot longer than we realized, and to malevolent ends.

11:25.965 --> 11:37.996
And that's why these same people that now and for many years have attributed the name Judas to me, actually don't talk about there being no evidence of spread in New York City.

11:38.016 --> 11:44.882
They don't talk about infectious clones as an idea in virology and what it means practically for synthetic biology.

11:45.382 --> 11:48.625
They don't talk about the role that placebo batches likely played.

11:49.066 --> 12:06.082
And they don't talk about the fact that transfection and transformation and transduction are all words that all academic biologists should have done known about many, many years before the pandemic and the idea that it took so many people so long to come to the T word.

12:06.903 --> 12:09.925
And some of them still haven't come there yet as extraordinary.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.307
Um, the protocols were murder.

12:12.327 --> 12:14.568
They just don't want to talk about how many different ways.

12:15.028 --> 12:20.091
It was fine when everybody was talking about remdesivir and trying to blame Tony Fauci for it.

12:20.571 --> 12:35.079
But once we started to realize that the only way you could get somebody in the hospital and have them have symptoms that, that you could put them on remdesivir, it often, often, often started with, um, as much oxygen as they need, you know, just turn it up.

12:36.319 --> 12:44.604
Gain of Function is definitely a mythology, especially with regard to RNA and RNA viruses, and that's the biology that we're going to work on all summer.

12:45.144 --> 12:55.651
And then the Scooby-Doo is just this thing where they coordinatedly pretended that there was some kind of cover-up or denial happening, and that coordinated

12:56.551 --> 13:12.268
spectacular commitment to that theater about the cover-up of the origin of the virus and whether or not it could be or would be or maybe is a lab leak is exactly how they planned to get us to teach this mythology to our children.

13:14.901 --> 13:27.128
And so I think by instead teaching our children that weaponized piles of money that have control of the mainstream media and also of social media have convinced us using liars to argue about the origins of the novel virus.

13:27.188 --> 13:32.931
And by participating in this argument unwittingly, we all accepted the novel virus as being real.

13:33.331 --> 13:35.312
And we are still being governed by this theater.

13:35.352 --> 13:38.934
The question is, is how deep and how broad is this theater and what

13:39.494 --> 13:42.155
To what domains of our understanding does it extend?

13:42.215 --> 13:44.556
Is it really as bad as Alan Dulles suggested?

13:44.596 --> 13:50.339
And that once everything we believe is false, we will finally be ruled by them?

13:50.359 --> 13:51.459
I don't know.

13:51.519 --> 13:52.460
I think it's possible.

13:54.217 --> 14:07.845
I know for sure that the pattern of them attributing bad motives to me has evolved, and now they are kind of out of the side of their mouth, suggesting that I might disappear pretty soon, which is an interesting connotation.

14:09.225 --> 14:13.048
I still think it just has to do with weaponized piles of money and the history of them.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.549
That's why I think my last guess was interesting.

14:16.710 --> 14:21.533
Lots of history there of weaponized piles of money, and if you don't start to see it soon, you're probably not gonna.

14:22.553 --> 14:27.676
You're probably not willing to realize exactly how overextended they are.

14:27.696 --> 14:33.979
I think Ray Kurzweiler, I've done a couple programs about Ray Kurzweiler.

14:34.019 --> 14:38.902
He's a guy who can really illustrate for you how overextended they are.

14:38.942 --> 14:47.226
They've been saying for a really long time what they're gonna do in 10 years because everything is happening so fast and now we're 20 years later or 40 years later.

14:48.527 --> 15:02.197
And if we don't realize that this is accurately cataloged in our history, these mythologies and how they developed, we're gonna lose access to our history and then these charlatans will have power over us for another couple generations.

15:02.858 --> 15:08.322
And in the same way that we inherited them from our parents, our kids will inherit them from us.

15:09.143 --> 15:16.068
And we can stop this, we can stop this if we realize who all the charlatans are.

15:17.918 --> 15:26.242
and how they've been working together so long that they are actually using American history against us now.

15:26.382 --> 15:36.528
And if we want to make gentle the life of this world as we transition out of their mythology, we're going to have to teach our children how to see the artificial waves of consensus by which we are governed.

15:37.108 --> 15:40.310
the artificial waves of consensus by which we are governed.

15:40.350 --> 16:00.900
Waves of consensus about Israel, and about money, and about banks, and about loans, and about bankruptcy, and about student loans, and about racism, and about abortion, and about state laws, and about everything, including the origins of the novel virus and the contamination of the mRNA shot.

16:02.196 --> 16:03.796
That's really what we're dealing with here.

16:03.816 --> 16:08.317
We're dealing with a coordinated wave of consensus.

16:08.758 --> 16:22.501
And if you don't focus on the biology and avoid taking their bait on social media, if you don't actively try to love your neighbor, you're going to end up on the bottom of the wave down here and pretty sad about it.

16:23.646 --> 16:35.495
Now this is a message coming from an American, American made message broadcasting to America and the world where I think the message should be stay focused, don't take the bait, and love your neighbor.

16:35.915 --> 16:37.836
Please share this work, that's how this works.

16:38.016 --> 16:44.101
If you share it, more people will see this biology and have a little ladder on the way out.

16:45.842 --> 17:09.271
Today we're not going to do a whole lot of biology in the sense of a journal club or something like that, but we're actually going to look at how a physicist and mathematician, intellectual dark web genius, has been elevated over many years to now sort of be at the center of a manufactured controversy about physics and mathematics.

17:09.932 --> 17:14.994
And this manufactured controversy is supposed to create some kind of cognitive parallel between

17:15.814 --> 17:23.460
our knowledge in physics, our lack of knowledge in physics, and our knowledge in biology and lack of knowledge in biology.

17:23.480 --> 17:36.751
And I'm hoping that I can use this as an example of how just by seeing it differently, by having a different set of filters, you can look at social media and see it plainly for what it is and the illusions for what they are.

17:37.887 --> 17:42.848
But again, if you want to engage in this, you've got to pull your own hands down.

17:42.888 --> 17:46.269
Because right now, the illusion is sustained by our participation.

17:47.210 --> 17:53.612
And so if you learn to engage in noncompliance by informing yourself, this is how we're going to get farther.

17:53.692 --> 17:54.492
That's what I think.

17:58.442 --> 17:58.522
So,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.642
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

18:26.662 --> 18:30.165
It is 1026 coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

18:30.185 --> 18:34.668
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:34.688 --> 18:35.929
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

18:36.810 --> 18:38.091
And yeah, it's a nice day.

18:38.131 --> 18:39.232
I think it's going to get pretty hot.

18:39.272 --> 18:40.653
I tried to start early today.

18:40.673 --> 18:44.556
It is the 12th of July, and we've got a lot of work to do.

18:44.756 --> 18:46.418
As usual, I'm a human just like you.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.198
I make mistakes.

18:47.258 --> 18:51.842
I got taken by the Scooby Doo at the beginning of the pandemic worse than almost anyone.

18:53.343 --> 18:57.866
I think that it's important to always start with the same message if you have a good one.

18:58.407 --> 19:05.012
And in this case, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

19:05.092 --> 19:10.476
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

19:12.438 --> 19:13.920
There are other ways to look at this.

19:13.960 --> 19:23.029
I've started already in the introduction with the idea that weaponized piles of money are behind all of this, and it's just a question of seeing who all of these people are.

19:23.749 --> 19:27.013
How is this limited spectrum of debate actually created?

19:27.073 --> 19:34.080
And I've been making the argument, along with a lot of other people on the internet, that the intellectual dark web represents a kind of forward-facing

19:34.420 --> 19:37.502
part of this, the obvious part, but there's lots of layers to it.

19:38.002 --> 19:57.214
And the way that these podcasts and their sponsorships work is that they are consciously and intelligently manipulating the organized opinions and habits of the masses by creating this illusion of consensus about what the interesting topics to talk about are, what the most interesting people, who the most interesting people are,

19:57.934 --> 20:09.040
and what we should be thinking about as a society or as an intellectual dark web alternative to the heterodoxy, whatever words that they use.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.682
And if you don't start to understand that podcasting

20:13.442 --> 20:41.509
whether you like it or not, is starting to become a central mode by which they fractionate us, and by which they occupy our consciousness so that we are wasting our time, or our children are wasting their time, and instead of developing skills, or becoming better at math, or reading, or learning anything, they are spending their time on video games, and they are spending their time on influencers, and they are spending their time on trying to become some of these things.

20:42.591 --> 20:49.915
And we must see that this is not even mediocrity as what Matthew said yesterday.

20:49.955 --> 20:51.155
It's not even mediocrity.

20:52.556 --> 20:59.079
We're talking about really the lowest level of time use.

21:00.080 --> 21:06.823
And we've got to pull out of this nosedive with our children very quickly or we won't be able to anymore.

21:06.863 --> 21:09.965
We will be left with a generation of adults that's inept.

21:11.266 --> 21:16.667
incapable of being the citizens that you need in order to have and maintain a republic.

21:17.547 --> 21:19.527
And unfortunately, we may already be there.

21:19.547 --> 21:26.289
We may have already unwittingly wasted too much time with our own lives to save our children.

21:26.329 --> 21:31.689
But if we're going to try, we've got to first acknowledge that that's where we are right now.

21:32.810 --> 21:35.850
Yesterday, I did have Matthew Eret on.

21:37.150 --> 21:39.111
And you can find his substack there.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.571
I'll just plug that one more time.

21:51.815 --> 21:55.578
So today, I want to get right to the show and right to the things that we're going to do.

21:55.698 --> 21:57.760
This is the IDW Report.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.902
Every once in a while, I think I should just title it the IDW Report.

22:00.922 --> 22:04.765
It's the Intellectual Dark Web Report from, of course, the Independent Bright Web.

22:05.706 --> 22:10.350
This is Morgan, or sorry, it's Weinstein on Morgan, on Rogan on ideas and stuff.

22:11.270 --> 22:22.897
And what I mean by Weinstein on Morgan, on Rogan, on ideas and stuff, is that Weinstein was a guest on Morgan's show, which is called like Uncensored or on something or other.

22:23.697 --> 22:30.461
And he, Weinstein, was talking about his appearance on Rogan, where he was talking to this Terrence McKenna or whatever his name is.

22:31.201 --> 22:51.736
and talking about his ideas and they're going to debate about whether that was a good idea because you know if you go on Rogan for four hours and talk to this Looney Tune then you give all of his ideas a lot more credence and everybody takes them a lot more seriously and I think you have an obligation as a smart guy not to talk to dumb people or something like that.

22:52.616 --> 22:56.099
Now what I want to extract from this is

22:57.651 --> 23:01.453
my first take on what they are trying to do with this dialogue.

23:01.493 --> 23:10.499
Remember what these dialogues are, these scripted dialogues with different people on different... this is the social media version.

23:10.519 --> 23:19.485
It is the literal, and I don't like that word, but in this case it might be appropriate, it is the literal manifestation of the words of

23:20.365 --> 23:21.365
of Noam Chomsky.

23:21.445 --> 23:37.829
So these limited spectrums of debate within which a very lively conversation occurs is exactly what these podcasts, newscasts, shows on the internet amount to.

23:37.929 --> 23:49.292
The view is one version of this and what we're going to see here is another version of this where four people get together and they agree on what are the smart questions to ask

23:50.154 --> 23:53.255
and agree about what the smart things to argue about are.

23:54.456 --> 24:07.162
And all the while, the presuppositions of the system are going to be reinforced by the stupid shit that they say, excuse my language, I found it coming, I could hear it coming, and I made the choice to say it.

24:08.542 --> 24:09.643
It is really bad.

24:09.983 --> 24:15.565
And I've only seen about the first five minutes of it, so I know already that we're gonna go deep.

24:16.005 --> 24:18.947
And I have a feeling that on the tee ball,

24:19.949 --> 24:31.534
T every time a new batter comes up or every time a new question comes up, there's going to be some like, you know, well, obviously, and then they're going to hit that idea out of the park.

24:32.094 --> 24:34.835
And then they're going to say, well, obviously we all know that.

24:35.736 --> 24:37.416
And then they're going to hit that ball out of the park.

24:37.476 --> 24:43.579
Now, the question is how many of those ideas that get put on the T and they're allowed to hit a home run.

24:44.059 --> 24:48.861
How many of those ideas are real versus not

24:51.974 --> 24:52.994
not substantiated.

24:54.195 --> 25:09.941
And if they put any ideas on that T and then go, well, we know that nuclear weapons exist, tink, and then they hit it out of the park never to discuss it again, you could kind of see that, wow, that's an interesting thing to put on the T. And so I'm anticipating two things.

25:10.181 --> 25:16.383
One, I'm anticipating, again, that we're going to need to make a list to identify the questions that they are debating.

25:16.983 --> 25:23.165
And then as we go, we'll just take notes and I'll try to formulate the questions I think they're asking and the answers they're offering.

25:23.605 --> 25:33.949
And then more importantly, I want you to look carefully, listen carefully for the presuppositions of the system that are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.

25:34.489 --> 25:39.310
I don't know if I'm going to be good at this or not yet, but that's what we're going to attempt to do as we move forward.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.671
We're going to try to use these

25:41.687 --> 25:50.624
these concepts as tools to dismantle some aspects of the illusion.

25:50.704 --> 25:51.305
So here we go.

25:51.325 --> 25:53.328
I'll try this one first.

25:56.115 --> 25:57.936
Everything has an equal and opposite.

25:58.436 --> 25:59.477
It has to mate.

25:59.757 --> 26:00.157
Whoa.

26:00.338 --> 26:02.799
I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community off.

26:02.899 --> 26:07.382
You're kind of adding legitimacy to slightly unhinged science fiction.

26:07.782 --> 26:12.024
I wouldn't have been able to appear with Terrence if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

26:12.084 --> 26:18.348
The platform to be accepted for the ideas is not social media.

26:18.668 --> 26:19.389
Neil himself

26:20.219 --> 26:24.621
doesn't appear conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

26:25.022 --> 26:29.564
It's 10 times easier to produce something that's BS, and so than it is to refute it.

26:29.744 --> 26:31.165
Science has a branding problem.

26:31.265 --> 26:35.587
If you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science, you have already lost.

26:35.948 --> 26:38.669
Science has become a pagan thing.

26:38.969 --> 26:47.314
Effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

26:48.382 --> 26:49.603
Ha, Candace Owens, nice.

26:49.643 --> 26:52.506
Trust the science became a mantra during the COVID pandemic.

26:52.946 --> 26:57.871
But in the years since, and partly as a consequence, a rising tide of people are doing quite the opposite.

26:58.031 --> 27:01.915
Challenging the scientific mainstream is in vogue.

27:01.955 --> 27:05.818
Now first, let me point out, right, Piers Morgan doesn't have to get you.

27:07.199 --> 27:08.821
Piers Morgan doesn't have to get you.

27:08.881 --> 27:10.102
Weinstein doesn't have to get you.

27:10.142 --> 27:11.624
None of these people have to get you.

27:12.184 --> 27:14.086
The question is, can they get people?

27:15.370 --> 27:16.811
because that's what this is all about.

27:16.971 --> 27:21.033
It's a throw everything against the wall and see what sticks.

27:21.673 --> 27:41.604
We have infinite money and we have probably an infinite list of people we could help or give a leg up or provide with comfort and fame in order to manipulate into, again, how many people do they really need to control if they have 50 or 100 podcasts and each one of those gets a million viewers?

27:41.644 --> 27:43.105
That's a lot of coverage already, right?

27:44.977 --> 27:46.218
And so that's what they're doing.

27:46.258 --> 28:00.447
They're filling this space on social media with places where no matter where you go, you are going to hear an illusion of consensus about certain things and a very lively debate within that limited spectrum.

28:00.487 --> 28:01.227
That's what it is.

28:01.287 --> 28:02.448
And that's what this will be.

28:03.028 --> 28:05.350
What I want to help you see is what I see.

28:06.070 --> 28:13.873
and what they are doing here with this Terrence McKenna guy and the four-hour Joe Rogan podcast where they're going to talk about it.

28:14.133 --> 28:19.815
Straight in the recent viral phenomenon of actor Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan podcast.

28:20.155 --> 28:24.697
So the viral phenomenon is of course chosen and I bet you anything we could just put a little

28:26.977 --> 28:35.522
viral and we'll just chalk it up like how many references to viruses will they make in this silly podcast.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.463
Let's go back to the beginning again.

28:37.803 --> 28:46.148
Effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

28:48.188 --> 28:51.350
Trust the science became a mantra during the COVID pandemic.

28:51.770 --> 28:56.694
But in the years since, and partly as a consequence, a rising tide of people are doing quite the opposite.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.676
Challenging the scientific mainstream is in vogue.

28:59.796 --> 29:15.767
Nobody's this better illustrated than the recent viral phenomenon of actor Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan podcast, the biggest media platform in the world right now, arguing that one times one actually equals two, among other bizarre theories.

29:17.028 --> 29:20.870
They don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.

29:21.110 --> 29:22.091
What do you mean by tone?

29:22.331 --> 29:30.616
Same tone, same key of E. You keep dividing light by two, and you'll ultimately get back to the audible sound of it.

29:30.996 --> 29:35.319
Because there was a relationship between light and color, sound and tone, matter and shape.

29:35.599 --> 29:39.221
At a given point, Mars was here in the Goldilocks zone.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.703
Everything has an equal and opposite.

29:42.183 --> 29:43.204
It has to mate.

29:44.025 --> 29:46.206
Mating is a big part of what we do.

29:46.726 --> 29:50.108
The carb, the boron mates with nitrogen.

29:50.168 --> 29:51.149
What's this guy's name?

29:51.649 --> 29:52.909
Did he say this guy's name?

29:52.929 --> 29:54.390
Sorry, I said Terrence McKenna.

29:54.410 --> 29:55.991
That's obviously wrong.

29:56.311 --> 30:00.133
I don't want to be... I don't want to make it seem like I didn't know that.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.594
I know his name is Terrence, though.

30:01.694 --> 30:04.235
Anyway, sorry, if someone can put that in the... Terrence Howard.

30:04.275 --> 30:04.975
Yes, thank you.

30:05.015 --> 30:05.376
My bad.

30:05.416 --> 30:07.577
How the carbon happens.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.158
96% of physics is unknown matter.

30:11.175 --> 30:15.279
that they've had to make up to account for it, and we were able to build Saturn.

30:15.799 --> 30:17.080
Man, don't turn my phone off.

30:17.120 --> 30:17.721
Don't do that.

30:18.141 --> 30:23.406
Every time I get ready, well, because I know they're watching me right now, and they're mad at me.

30:24.186 --> 30:25.587
Who's they?

30:26.628 --> 30:32.313
The politicians and the authorities that give the politicians their accredation.

30:32.553 --> 30:35.936
And our world economy is based off of one times one equaling one.

30:35.976 --> 30:37.137
You think they fuck with your phone?

30:37.438 --> 30:38.298
Oh, I'm sure of it.

30:38.539 --> 30:38.779
Whoa.

30:42.699 --> 30:46.702
Well, there were four hours of that, but it's reached tens of millions of people.

30:46.802 --> 30:49.383
It's been a true viral phenomenon, like I said.

30:49.423 --> 30:57.729
Well, many in the scientific establishment expressed alarm at the apparently limitless reach of wild theories at a time science has a reputation problem.

30:58.089 --> 31:02.692
Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps the most famous scientist on the planet, had this to say.

31:05.071 --> 31:18.423
If you're a fan of a subject, let's say, a hobbyist, let's call it, it's possible to know enough about that subject to think you're right, but not enough about that subject to know that you're wrong.

31:18.844 --> 31:23.048
The funny part about it is, is that that is exactly describing himself.

31:24.707 --> 31:31.833
He knows just enough about physics to talk about it on TV and kids programs, but not enough to argue with anyone who actually knows physics.

31:31.873 --> 31:38.399
Now that's not me, but I know that from talking to countless other people who do know physics, that that guy is basically a brick.

31:39.340 --> 31:41.521
It's pretty funny that they use him as example.

31:42.662 --> 31:44.523
I hope that they're going to lampoon him for that.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.624
Phenomenal, like I said.

31:45.664 --> 31:53.967
Well, many in the scientific establishment expressed alarm at the apparently limitless reach of wild theories at a time science has a reputation problem.

31:54.328 --> 31:58.990
Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps the most famous scientist on the planet, had this to say.

31:59.610 --> 32:01.831
The most famous scientist on the planet?

32:01.951 --> 32:02.591
Seriously?

32:03.392 --> 32:05.613
Like, do you say that without, wow?

32:07.768 --> 32:14.692
If you're a fan of a subject, let's say, a hobbyist, let's call it, it's possible to know enough about that subject.

32:14.752 --> 32:16.193
I mean, let's just be honest.

32:16.253 --> 32:19.254
Tony Fauci's more well-known than this guy.

32:19.274 --> 32:20.175
Like, come on.

32:21.596 --> 32:26.999
To think you're right, but not enough about that subject to know that you're wrong.

32:27.299 --> 32:33.542
The platform to be accepted for the ideas is not social media.

32:34.463 --> 32:36.344
It is not Joe Rogan.

32:37.543 --> 32:39.084
It is not my podcast.

32:39.664 --> 33:00.355
It is research journals where attention can be given on a level that at the end of the day offers no higher respect for your energy and intellect than by declaring that what's in it is either right or wrong or worthy of publication or not.

33:02.000 --> 33:02.962
Well, others disagree.

33:03.122 --> 33:06.608
Right or wrong, or worthy of publication or not.

33:06.688 --> 33:08.992
See, what a weird thing to say.

33:09.033 --> 33:10.215
That's so stupid.

33:12.711 --> 33:15.213
He knows that it's worthy of publication or not.

33:15.233 --> 33:19.617
It has nothing to do with right or wrong, because right or wrong isn't established by p-values.

33:19.717 --> 33:35.750
Like, this is an extraordinary admission here, that they're already curating a limited spectrum of debate where on one side we have this dork, and then on the other side we're going to have the intellectual dark web master of many things, polymath,

33:36.651 --> 33:40.855
and advisor to Peter Thiel, son of Les Weinstein, Eric.

33:41.095 --> 33:43.076
They argue the old system needs to be shaken up.

33:43.116 --> 33:50.582
The questioning and challenging mainstream institutions and theories is the only real way to actually get to the truth.

33:51.263 --> 33:58.268
Here to debate this, the podcaster and cosmologist at University of California, Professor Brian Keating, host of Impact Theory, Tom Billiard.

33:58.628 --> 34:01.931
But I'll start with Dr. Eric Weinstein, mathematician and OG.

34:02.031 --> 34:05.094
So that other dude is like an intellectual dark web level two.

34:06.263 --> 34:12.144
He's a lot like, you know, underneath Ruben, underneath Shapiro.

34:12.205 --> 34:14.285
He's had Rodney Mullen on his show.

34:17.446 --> 34:18.886
Rodney's never been on my show.

34:22.607 --> 34:25.828
That guy's got a great podcast, but I don't understand why.

34:27.808 --> 34:33.510
Well, let's just say that when you get a million subscribers, it doesn't necessarily mean that that means you're super smart.

34:34.437 --> 34:39.740
or you're very insightful, it might just mean that you got lucky and you had a lot of good guests and you're supposed to rise.

34:41.301 --> 34:47.143
And so if I watch that guy, his early podcast, we can talk about that later.

34:47.264 --> 34:56.448
If we watch his early ones, the impact factor versus the ones that are coming out now, you can see a level of humility that's completely disappeared from his work.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.774
And so that leads me to believe that he's on the rise here.

35:01.814 --> 35:03.597
He's been on the rise throughout COVID.

35:04.298 --> 35:11.507
And it was one of these people who got on the escalator because he had a pass already, just like all these intellectual dark web people did.

35:12.636 --> 35:12.997
Here we go.

35:13.037 --> 35:17.019
The intellectual dark web and creator of the portal podcast.

35:17.039 --> 35:18.641
Well, Eric, welcome back to Uncensored.

35:18.661 --> 35:25.526
I'm Tom Bilyeu, but I'll start with Dr. Eric Weinstein, mathematician and OG of the intellectual dark web and creator.

35:25.846 --> 35:27.167
OG, old gangster.

35:27.187 --> 35:28.788
That's a nice reference there.

35:28.888 --> 35:29.909
Really classy.

35:30.209 --> 35:30.789
Classy.

35:30.909 --> 35:32.471
Of the portal podcast.

35:32.491 --> 35:34.132
Well, Eric, welcome back to Uncensored.

35:34.672 --> 35:40.656
Really fascinating to see how big this has all blown in the last few days.

35:41.657 --> 35:49.343
For those who didn't watch the Terence Howard four-hour, I don't know what you would call it, theory-a-thon, let's be kind.

35:51.225 --> 35:55.608
What were the sort of main premises he was coming out with that have captured everyone's attention?

35:57.670 --> 36:07.737
Well, I think that he made several outrageous claims that were more or less baseless as far as

36:09.562 --> 36:23.490
either the heterodox or the orthodox view of science, that 1 times 1 is equal to 2, that the periodic table should be rearranged around earlier work from the 1920s.

36:27.287 --> 36:32.230
that he had a theory of physics based on platonic solids with curved linear sides.

36:33.471 --> 36:38.714
I don't think any of those hold up to any kind of scrutiny.

36:39.134 --> 36:49.160
That said, he definitely has some very interesting engineering claims, and he's got some very interesting geometric structures that

36:50.100 --> 36:57.635
could make beautiful lighting, fantastic art, and he is saying some things that people are deriding.

37:00.141 --> 37:03.583
from a scholarly perspective that actually have some merit.

37:04.244 --> 37:10.128
So it's a very bizarre and complicated situation, but it is not complicated at the root.

37:10.569 --> 37:18.535
There's nothing wrong with standard orthodox science, and I say that as a very strong critic of the system.

37:18.755 --> 37:28.563
So if you wanted to hear it from somebody with a PhD who's nevertheless not shy about savaging the institutions when that is what they deserve,

37:29.338 --> 37:35.197
I would say that the level of doubt that he has cast on simple things like arithmetic

37:36.596 --> 37:37.957
is completely unwarranted.

37:38.077 --> 37:50.284
But it's a very bizarre situation to watch an entire nation that depends on technology and science for its advantage suddenly question whether or not one times one equals one.

37:50.444 --> 38:00.249
So there's a presumption right there that the entire nation, because of Terrence Howard's appearance on Joe Rogan, is now questioning fundamental principles of mathematics.

38:00.649 --> 38:01.350
Stop lying!

38:01.750 --> 38:10.839
I mean, that's a crazy, just because people watched the podcast, now everybody thinks that we weren't worried when people said that 2 plus 2 was 5.

38:11.339 --> 38:17.825
We weren't worried that that was going to go and everybody was going to, you know, bridges were going to collapse and cars would stop working.

38:17.865 --> 38:22.710
So I don't know what we're, I don't know what this means, but that's a pretty ridiculous statement.

38:24.372 --> 38:34.436
What is fascinating to me is the last time I had anything to do with Terrence Howard, I interviewed him at CNN about 10 years ago when he did a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen.

38:35.156 --> 38:46.520
And the next thing, he's doing a four-hour podcast with Joe Rogan in which he's airing the most sort of intensely complex theories, many of which, as you say, might be completely for the birds.

38:48.121 --> 38:54.604
Were you aware that Terrence Howard was thinking this way, was moving to a place where he could even conduct an interview like that?

38:56.484 --> 39:09.069
Well, to be honest, I didn't know who Terrence Howard... My basic assumption here, just so you know what I'm thinking in my head, is that Terrence Howard was coached and set up by Eric.

39:10.402 --> 39:23.611
so that Eric, after he went to Oxford and did all these other things, could be the guy who sat with him on Joe Rogan and then fired back and forth after he had rehearsed several times on The View and other places.

39:24.636 --> 39:38.042
This is my most parsimonious explanation for what's going on here, and that would also be the reason why, you know, Eric felt so, you know, he was gonna take one for the team and step up and tell this guy the truth.

39:38.222 --> 39:42.204
Well, because he had already helped him develop that schtick, and he's an actor.

39:43.160 --> 39:55.643
So in my humble opinion, there's no butts about it that this guy is playing us as part of the ruling elite's game that they're playing, whether he knows it or not.

39:56.563 --> 39:57.783
But most likely he knows.

39:58.363 --> 40:09.325
I mean, if you're given the greatest acting role in history to be part of the reality theater that's going to change the world forever, well, then you take that.

40:09.526 --> 40:11.226
You take that chance if you're that guy.

40:12.153 --> 40:13.774
And he was an actor, right?

40:13.814 --> 40:15.394
So I mean, they just take roles.

40:15.494 --> 40:16.234
They take roles.

40:16.834 --> 40:17.515
He was.

40:19.235 --> 40:21.256
So I didn't have an image for him.

40:21.876 --> 40:36.660
But had you asked me, I would have thought back to Werner Herzog doing the entire film Fitzcarraldo to test his engineering theories about how less technologically advanced people could move heavy objects many miles.

40:38.761 --> 40:39.902
uphills.

40:39.922 --> 40:42.503
He created an entire film to test his engineering theories.

40:42.903 --> 40:52.709
Hedy Lamarr famously developed spread spectrum technology despite being a screen siren back in the 30s and 40s.

40:53.389 --> 41:02.434
So just as I don't think it's very strange to find out that Steve Martin is an incredible banjo player, I don't find it at all odd that a polymath

41:02.934 --> 41:04.536
Like Terrence Howard.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.558
So Terrence Howard is a polymath, okay?

41:07.618 --> 41:11.481
Terrence Howard is a polymath is what he states.

41:13.763 --> 41:15.785
He's not pretending to be a polymath.

41:15.845 --> 41:17.626
He's not maybe a polymath.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.228
He's not smart on a lot of levels.

41:20.088 --> 41:31.278
Eric Weinstein is asserting that Terrence Howard is a polymath, even in the same interview as he's saying that he basically says a lot of nonsense, but he's got some neat art.

41:32.722 --> 41:33.683
Think about that.

41:33.943 --> 41:36.685
Think about what is happening here and see what it is.

41:36.765 --> 41:39.807
They are inserting him.

41:40.448 --> 41:46.513
We are agreeing to talk about him because he's a polymath and he's asking questions worth answering.

41:46.533 --> 41:53.098
I think it's very strange to find out that Steve Martin is an incredible banjo player.

41:53.638 --> 41:57.341
I don't find it at all odd that a polymath like

41:58.056 --> 42:00.397
Terence Howard would have such theories.

42:00.497 --> 42:05.519
I don't think that the theories about math and physics and chemistry are incredibly deep.

42:05.539 --> 42:07.379
So I'm going to push back on that.

42:08.540 --> 42:14.822
But I do think that he knows quite a lot about many things and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

42:15.529 --> 42:27.826
I mean, Neil deGrasse Tyson said that he- I mean, ask yourself the question why Terence Howard wouldn't at least point out that Tesla knew a lot more about a lot of things than we ever gave him credit for.

42:28.527 --> 42:30.630
And why wouldn't he in his-

42:31.391 --> 43:00.784
One of the things that bothers me a lot is he claims to have used this new geometry to describe electromagnetism in a correct way, which I don't understand how anybody can take that seriously because, a very simple fact, if you have a model of reality that is closer to correct than what is currently in use, then that model of reality will replace what is there by the merits of its predictive power.

43:02.594 --> 43:17.924
In other words, if he had come up with a good idea which explained magnetism to a mathematically more correct or a practically more correct way, then it would make predictions that would come true in the real world.

43:18.845 --> 43:20.466
And they would be easily testable.

43:20.526 --> 43:21.647
That's the whole point.

43:22.547 --> 43:26.350
If you have a hypothesis and it's untestable,

43:27.691 --> 43:33.313
or only its null hypothesis is testable or being tested, then you're not doing science.

43:34.653 --> 43:40.535
And what right now they are discussing is a very disingenuous representation of what's going on here.

43:40.555 --> 43:41.415
I'm going back once.

43:42.656 --> 43:48.938
But I do think that he knows quite a lot about many things and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

43:49.625 --> 43:57.707
I mean, Neil deGrasse Tyson said that people can know enough to sort of ask questions and stuff, but maybe not enough to know when they're wrong.

43:58.307 --> 44:13.592
In other words, when they're presented with quite complex science that has been peer reviewed and is deemed to be established scientific fact, that he doesn't know enough about the detail to understand why he's wrong to question it.

44:15.972 --> 44:18.193
You mean the Dunning-Kruger effect, as Neil said.

44:18.273 --> 44:18.473
Yeah.

44:20.157 --> 44:28.505
It's kind of ironic, actually, because it feels to me like Neil deGrasse Tyson is himself a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

44:28.985 --> 44:35.671
As his comments about Philip Eddington using the 1919 solar eclipse.

44:39.995 --> 44:49.862
to prove that Einstein's theories about a star warping space, in particular our sun, appear to be borne out.

44:51.463 --> 45:02.850
Neil claims that that was sent to a peer-reviewed journal, whereas peer review doesn't really begin in physics and in the sciences really until the 60s and much more the 70s.

45:03.370 --> 45:06.533
So it's very interesting because Neil himself

45:07.369 --> 45:11.774
doesn't appear conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

45:12.355 --> 45:13.516
So there's a nice one.

45:14.177 --> 45:15.378
That's for sure the truth.

45:15.798 --> 45:19.322
Peer review is not something that these guys went through.

45:19.362 --> 45:25.810
They sent each other's ideas to each other, and then they sent letters back, and they published books, and that's it.

45:25.850 --> 45:27.371
They published treaties, and that's it.

45:28.871 --> 45:43.962
This idea of peer review being a way of, as Neil deGrasse Tyson said, proving something is right or wrong or worthy of publication is exactly the bamboozlement that modern science and academicians engage in.

45:44.952 --> 45:58.935
Isn't the reality of all science a bit like with medicine that a lot of very smart people take a look at a lot of available data, but maybe not enough to reach absolute definitive conclusions.

45:59.075 --> 46:06.036
And they espouse theories which their peer group then look at and discuss and analyze and argue about.

46:06.416 --> 46:11.697
And that's how we progress with science over decades, centuries, and so on.

46:11.737 --> 46:14.558
I mean, isn't this part of the evolution of science?

46:14.998 --> 46:19.119
is that people like you and Neil deGrasse Tyson might vehemently disagree about stuff.

46:19.559 --> 46:26.101
But actually, it's only through the disagreements you develop... But you can only disagree about models of reality.

46:26.141 --> 46:27.882
And then either you test them or you don't.

46:27.922 --> 46:29.462
Either they're testable or they're not.

46:30.983 --> 46:35.264
But it makes it seem like there's so much grey area in reality right now.

46:35.304 --> 46:36.404
There's so much grey area.

46:36.464 --> 46:41.326
The only grey area that exists in physics is in places where they can't experimentally test.

46:42.466 --> 46:42.726
That's it.

46:44.039 --> 46:45.320
That's the only gray areas.

46:45.460 --> 46:47.901
The gray areas are where we can't come up with an experiment.

46:47.941 --> 46:49.761
We can't come up with a collider big enough.

46:49.801 --> 46:51.702
We can't do whatever, then they can't do it.

46:53.843 --> 46:55.264
But that's the beauty of physics.

46:55.304 --> 46:58.005
That's how far we've come with physics, right?

46:59.406 --> 47:09.530
The edge of physics, like practical physics, where you build a rig or you build an experiment or you build an apparatus to test something, this is all just fine.

47:10.987 --> 47:14.390
And we can build state-of-the-art airplanes and all this other stuff.

47:15.471 --> 47:17.352
Engineering physics is just fine.

47:18.373 --> 47:28.361
The only place where people like Eric and Neil deGrasse Tyson can disagree are places where experimentally it's very hard to get, if not outright impossible.

47:28.902 --> 47:34.106
And that's why his theory has something called a ship-in-the-bottle variable.

47:35.814 --> 47:37.975
I mean, can we talk about how stupid that is?

47:38.015 --> 47:56.099
Can you imagine if I had an explanation for how mitochondria work, and one of the things that I said was, well, there's this thing inside of it that I can't really accurately describe, but if you let me call it a ship in a bottle, then I can explain everything else, depending on what that ship in a bottle ends up being when we figure it out.

47:57.919 --> 48:01.180
That's how he claims his alternative view of physics works.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.621
It requires a variable called a ship in a bottle variable.

48:06.564 --> 48:13.751
I don't know how this differentiates from other algebraic and complex variables, but it's called a ship-in-a-bottle variable.

48:13.831 --> 48:14.872
It absolutely is.

48:17.154 --> 48:17.875
Or operator.

48:19.963 --> 48:21.985
This is not a real intellectual here.

48:22.045 --> 48:24.168
He may be very mathematically intelligent.

48:24.208 --> 48:32.337
He may be very, very smart, but he is not on the cutting edge of anything with his new ideas, and that's his main shtick.

48:33.138 --> 48:40.946
He can be really smart, just like I can read an awful lot of biology and still maybe never come up with a new idea myself.

48:41.727 --> 48:47.328
But I can be very, very conversant in all of the ideas of the people around me and the people that came before me.

48:47.748 --> 48:49.108
Doesn't make you a bad guy.

48:49.608 --> 48:50.549
Doesn't make you dumb.

48:53.069 --> 49:05.651
But what Eric Weinstein is the example of is someone who, for whatever reason, either has good ideas but can't express them or doesn't really have good ideas but would love people to believe he does.

49:05.691 --> 49:09.712
And since he's got a really good job working for Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, why would he need to do

49:10.404 --> 49:17.093
you know, wouldn't want to really do it, you know, like Brett wouldn't really want to do research.

49:17.133 --> 49:21.719
He's done a paper on telomeres and then he's supposed to talk about that for the rest of his life, I guess.

49:26.345 --> 49:28.646
Well, but I doubt that he would agree to a probe.

49:28.706 --> 49:32.647
Disagree over decades, centuries and so on.

49:32.667 --> 49:40.090
I mean, isn't this isn't this part of the evolution of science is that people like you and Neil deGrasse Tyson might vehemently disagree about stuff.

49:40.530 --> 49:44.311
But actually, it's only through the disagreements you you you develop.

49:46.912 --> 49:52.919
Well, but I doubt that he would agree to a program where we were going to have a discussion about this.

49:53.660 --> 49:57.384
My guess is that you reached out to him, that he was too busy to appear.

49:57.865 --> 50:01.208
My claim is, is that in general, we avoid dustups.

50:03.413 --> 50:04.714
for fear of looking foolish.

50:05.274 --> 50:10.476
And I think it's fine to avoid dust-ups when you feel that there's an ethical problem with the other person.

50:11.156 --> 50:15.899
But in general, science progresses by a large variety of different channels.

50:16.759 --> 50:23.722
Benjamin Jeste famously observed that his milkmaids weren't dying from smallpox, but they did get cowpox.

50:23.782 --> 50:31.966
So he injected his entire family with cow pus to give them cowpox to prevent against smallpox.

50:32.646 --> 50:34.007
Bad language choice there.

50:34.067 --> 50:36.549
Not very accurate there, Mr. Weinstein.

50:36.610 --> 50:38.071
He didn't inject anybody.

50:39.272 --> 50:47.179
It's not like he could go down to the shop and buy some hypodermic needles that were already sterilized or put them in his fucking, excuse me, in his pressure cooker.

50:47.239 --> 50:49.621
I really apologize for that, but this is terrible.

50:50.602 --> 50:52.363
He injected cowpox, he says.

50:53.324 --> 50:54.825
They didn't inject anything.

50:54.905 --> 50:57.668
It's called variolation and it's gross.

50:59.328 --> 51:00.569
but they did get cowpox.

51:00.629 --> 51:08.573
So he injected his entire family with cow pus to give them cowpox to prevent against smallpox.

51:08.593 --> 51:11.055
That's one of the beginnings of vaccines.

51:11.115 --> 51:15.237
People would dig up bodies from graveyards to do anatomical studies.

51:15.798 --> 51:17.759
Famously, the ulcer.

51:17.919 --> 51:25.043
I wonder if you dug up a rotting body, if you'd risk any other diseases or anything like that, other infections, other weird things, you know?

51:25.103 --> 51:27.084
Like, what are we talking about here?

51:29.653 --> 51:47.204
which was thought to be correlated with stress, was tested by the dissenting heterodox biomedical researcher and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig to buy these from graveyards to do anatomical studies.

51:47.764 --> 51:52.227
Famously, the ulcer, which was thought to be correlated with stress,

51:53.327 --> 52:03.660
was tested by the dissenting heterodox biomedical researcher and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig.

52:03.920 --> 52:04.922
What did he just say there?

52:06.724 --> 52:08.905
I'm sorry, but I want to smack this guy in his face.

52:09.225 --> 52:10.706
Who is he talking to like that?

52:11.186 --> 52:11.767
What did he say?

52:12.247 --> 52:13.428
Did you hear the words?

52:13.948 --> 52:20.872
A Greek doctor proved that ulcers were just bacterial infections that could be cured by antibiotics.

52:20.912 --> 52:21.692
Did you hear that?

52:22.272 --> 52:23.273
Did you hear him say that?

52:24.133 --> 52:25.374
Cause I didn't hear him say that.

52:25.514 --> 52:28.796
I heard heterodox doctor data did up data.

52:32.571 --> 52:48.558
Did you hear him say that a Greek doctor for 10 years suffered ridicule and tried to publish the idea that ulcers didn't need to be surgically removed, which is what they were doing for 10 years while they ignored this guy in Greece?

52:53.000 --> 52:57.222
Did he tell the story or did he just say nonsense?

52:58.834 --> 53:02.195
tested by the descending heterodox biomedical researcher.

53:15.580 --> 53:20.124
and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig.

53:20.164 --> 53:22.706
So what information did you get there?

53:22.806 --> 53:23.827
What information?

53:23.867 --> 53:33.234
Did you get the fact that a doctor figured it out, that it was bacterial and that antibiotics would work instead of cutting ulcers out via surgery?

53:35.816 --> 53:37.417
What is he telling anybody there then?

53:42.517 --> 53:51.965
I think that you have to understand that just as Benjamin Franklin took a kite and key into an electrical storm to prove that lightning was electric.

53:52.085 --> 53:57.710
I'm not sure that Ben Franklin took a key tied to a kite into an electrical storm.

53:57.750 --> 54:02.093
There's something about that as a ham radio operator that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

54:03.655 --> 54:08.779
Was he not smart enough to know that he could put a stake in the ground and have the

54:10.168 --> 54:13.750
have the kite be, you know, just, you could tie it to a tree for shit's sake.

54:14.090 --> 54:16.971
If you have a long enough string to fly a kite, then you could tie it anywhere.

54:17.492 --> 54:18.152
I don't get it.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.613
I have a kite right behind me.

54:20.653 --> 54:25.596
I've been flying kites since I was a little kid, all kinds of them, four lines, two lines, one line.

54:26.256 --> 54:30.378
I don't understand why someone would stand in the middle of a field with a kite.

54:31.719 --> 54:33.479
And I just don't get it.

54:35.620 --> 54:36.401
I really don't get it.

54:37.432 --> 54:38.053
electricity.

54:39.094 --> 54:44.118
People have done all sorts of things that have nothing to do with learned societies and the genteel

54:46.092 --> 54:52.013
sort of feel afforded by peer review in order to advance science.

54:52.073 --> 54:55.514
I really think that in part what we've done is we've sanitized our own history.

54:55.574 --> 54:56.634
We've forgotten what works.

54:57.275 --> 55:05.256
What was interesting to me was Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't go on Joe Rogan to respond, which is what Terence Howard wanted him to do.

55:06.057 --> 55:06.697
But you did.

55:07.037 --> 55:08.037
And here's a clip from that.

55:10.191 --> 55:11.552
This is the other side of it.

55:12.452 --> 55:16.474
This is what's very interesting.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.955
Like these, they'll come together and meet.

55:19.435 --> 55:23.017
You can see where they meet up, their natural meeting up.

55:23.477 --> 55:29.140
Now this one looks exactly like this one, but they don't have the same mixture.

55:29.220 --> 55:34.102
So what this is creating, this is actually showing, this is the equal and opposite.

55:34.142 --> 55:35.623
This is matter.

55:35.943 --> 55:37.784
This becomes the antimatter of it.

55:38.604 --> 55:39.444
You can't stop me.

55:39.464 --> 55:40.064
I'm so sorry.

55:40.144 --> 55:42.725
I'm my own worst enemy and my own best friend.

55:43.725 --> 55:44.146
You know what?

55:44.806 --> 55:45.926
That was a beautiful statement.

55:46.546 --> 55:54.728
But what I'm trying to say is the fact that they keep, and these four will keep, this is just the magnetic, what I consider the magnetic field.

55:54.848 --> 55:56.689
You see, you stopped yourself.

55:56.789 --> 55:58.609
I consider this to be the magnetic.

55:58.749 --> 56:05.651
See, if he considers that the magnetic field of an atom or whatever, it should make testable predictions.

56:05.731 --> 56:07.512
Otherwise, it's not a very good model.

56:08.527 --> 56:19.492
But since he says it's based on the negative space between bubbles and it's kind of a better interpretation of platonic solids or some shit like that, to me, the most

56:21.011 --> 56:46.380
absolute rudimentary way to challenge this guy would be to say okay what predictions does your model of the world and universe make that we can test just name one and we'll and we'll we'll tell you that it's already been done we'll show you you see that's the issue here that's the part that i believe terrence and joe rogan unwittingly and eric

56:47.080 --> 57:08.015
engage in this faux sort of discussion where as long as Terrence and Eric appear to agree that they're discussing something that they both understand then Rogan is left to say well I guess I don't understand what they're talking about but clearly they're talking about something because they both agree they're talking about it and now

57:09.082 --> 57:21.109
Eric Weinstein can go on Pierce Morgan and pretend that they were talking about something and that he was calling him out when it was necessary, but not all the time, because sometimes it's pretty interesting shapes he's got here.

57:21.509 --> 57:29.273
Because they're expanding at the center, and magnetism, in my language, magnetism expands out and becomes greater.

57:29.293 --> 57:31.295
And you know when you just said, in my language?

57:31.335 --> 57:31.935
In my language.

57:31.955 --> 57:33.656
That's what I just did with the Terrence product.

57:33.716 --> 57:34.877
You said in your language.

57:34.897 --> 57:37.238
I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community off.

57:37.438 --> 57:38.238
I don't want to piss him off.

57:38.358 --> 57:39.299
I want friends.

57:39.379 --> 57:40.079
I need friend.

57:41.460 --> 57:47.622
Now, the interesting thing to me is, as we would say in the U.K., it sounded to me like he was talking a load of old cobblers.

57:49.302 --> 57:53.964
And yet you were there and you were being very generous and sort of reasonable.

57:54.244 --> 58:01.007
And I would love to come to Albuquerque, New Mexico and kite buggy.

58:01.287 --> 58:06.489
I did it a couple of times on the beach in the Netherlands, and it is the most

58:07.253 --> 58:10.637
Incredible fun I've ever had on the beach.

58:10.817 --> 58:13.980
Actually, I also did this little sail car kind of thing.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.662
It has a sail and like three wheels.

58:16.383 --> 58:18.425
And those things can move on the beach.

58:18.465 --> 58:19.326
That was also great.

58:19.366 --> 58:23.230
But with a power kite and a cart, it was insane.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.613
I was actually pretty scared at one point.

58:25.633 --> 58:26.453
It went so fast.

58:26.534 --> 58:27.855
I didn't know that that was possible.

58:27.975 --> 58:31.657
and decent with him and allowing him to continue with his theories.

58:31.997 --> 58:46.044
That's attracted for you a lot of criticism that by by engaging in that manner with him you're kind of adding legitimacy to slightly unhinged science fiction rather than promoting the cause of science.

58:46.064 --> 58:46.985
How do you respond to that.

58:48.939 --> 58:53.781
Well, first of all, this is always a scuttlebutt, and people say.

58:54.261 --> 58:55.762
So I'm not very impressed with that.

58:55.842 --> 59:00.403
I would say that you have... But see, that's dumb.

59:00.443 --> 59:01.884
This is supposed to be an interview.

59:01.944 --> 59:04.465
So part of that is a cop-out on the part of Pierce Morgan.

59:04.485 --> 59:05.785
Why not just ask the question?

59:06.366 --> 59:14.789
So by listening to Terrence and entertaining his ideas, aren't you giving them legitimacy that they don't deserve, especially four hours on Joe Rogan?

59:14.829 --> 59:16.349
That's the question he wanted to ask.

59:18.610 --> 59:21.853
He was kind of able to say, yeah, but you know what people say, blah, blah, blah.

59:22.373 --> 59:34.063
What he's not saying specifically is that places like Twitter and Facebook and elsewhere have been corrupted so that the illusion that lots of people are saying this stuff can be created.

59:35.484 --> 59:43.167
And instead of saying, oh, I don't buy into that just because a lot of people are saying it, he is reinforcing the assumption that a lot of people are saying it.

59:43.787 --> 59:49.809
And that it's available and visible on social media, which I would argue is exactly the illusion they want to sustain.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.590
None of this is real.

59:52.150 --> 59:55.552
None of the illusions of consensus you see on social media are real.

59:56.072 --> 01:00:00.293
Even if some of those people in those lists of people that agree are your friends.

01:00:01.794 --> 01:00:04.775
We have to wake up to the illusion that they've created.

01:00:07.093 --> 01:00:10.576
I wouldn't say it's mildly unhinged, I would say it's wildly unhinged.

01:00:10.596 --> 01:00:12.858
A lot of this stuff is just nonsense, right?

01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:17.522
On the other hand, I was very quick to spot something that

01:00:18.679 --> 01:00:22.981
I wouldn't have been able to appear with Terrence if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:35.866
And because I have a lot of background and experience in this area, it was possible for me to go through what he said at a speed that I think very few people would be able to go through his work.

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:39.167
What percentage of what he was saying?

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:45.992
was true or at least vaguely sensible and what was completely- Very little, very little.

01:00:46.012 --> 01:01:06.246
So my question, if it was genuinely very little, him getting tens of millions of views for espousing complete nonsense in the main and then someone with your pedigree and your knowledge of this subject matter going on and kind of going along with engaging him as a serious person in these

01:01:07.367 --> 01:01:08.389
things.

01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:11.794
Is that not in its own way diminishing science when you do that?

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:20.827
First of all, I wouldn't have had Terence on the first time because it didn't do him a service to what he actually is doing that's interesting.

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:23.398
to give him this amount of air.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:26.259
That was a good friend of mine's choice.

01:01:26.979 --> 01:01:29.319
So partially what you're seeing is a relationship.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.920
So now it wasn't even my choice.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.181
It was Joe's choice.

01:01:33.241 --> 01:01:35.641
And Joe's my good friend, so I wanted to support him.

01:01:35.702 --> 01:01:37.542
And so that's why we did the show.

01:01:37.602 --> 01:01:40.723
That's what they're arguing now, which is pretty funny.

01:01:42.404 --> 01:01:47.405
I wanted to say that Jay Bhattacharya using the phrase illusion of consensus is by design.

01:01:47.485 --> 01:01:49.126
They actually stole that from us.

01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:51.943
Or maybe I stole it from them.

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:52.503
I don't know.

01:01:52.523 --> 01:01:54.163
You can do the timeline and find out.

01:01:54.223 --> 01:01:56.284
But their blog didn't start until May 2023.

01:01:56.784 --> 01:02:00.025
And I think I was already using the phrase then.

01:02:00.065 --> 01:02:03.646
It's not like I can make up phrases in English that have never been used before.

01:02:04.127 --> 01:02:09.648
And the illusion of consensus was something that I was definitely using and certainly beating into the ground.

01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:10.929
What I find interesting

01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:20.558
about Jay Bhattacharya's podcast and his substack that he started called The Illusion of Consensus is that he started it with a Canadian kid.

01:02:21.459 --> 01:02:26.084
And that Canadian kid was promoted first on YouTube by Brett Weinstein.

01:02:26.932 --> 01:02:35.654
And so it's a blatant admission that this kid is part of this, you know, meddler network in Canada, which there is a lot of.

01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:38.915
And he was promoted with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:46.017
Jay Bhattacharya had already met me three times at Broken Science Initiative, telling me how great it was and how much he'd learned from me.

01:02:46.057 --> 01:02:55.539
And yet he decided to start a blog and a podcast titled Illusion of Consensus with someone that Brett Weinstein introduced to the world.

01:02:58.063 --> 01:02:59.304
I mean, it's just obvious.

01:02:59.424 --> 01:03:00.865
They are a network of people.

01:03:01.566 --> 01:03:12.413
They are a network of people that is being influenced and encouraged and given comfort and fame by some weaponized pile of money or piles of money.

01:03:12.473 --> 01:03:13.734
That's about all I can say.

01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:25.243
And I think the Weinsteins, more Eric and less than Brett, are intimately connected to these weaponized piles of money that are responsible for this chaos.

01:03:25.956 --> 01:03:31.460
between a comedian, Joe Rogan, and a mathematician, Eric Weinstein.

01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:36.104
Joe's a buddy of mine, and he matters to me.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:38.646
And he's the one who asked me to come on.

01:03:42.149 --> 01:03:44.951
Some people tried to frame it as if I wanted to go on.

01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:45.772
I had no interest.

01:03:46.758 --> 01:03:51.322
going on, but if we were going to watch a mass delusion... Does he live in Texas?

01:03:51.522 --> 01:03:55.406
Otherwise he like had no interest in going on, but he did because why?

01:03:55.426 --> 01:03:57.107
I guess to save us from the bullshit.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:02.351
You know, some people tried to frame it as if I wanted to go on.

01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:08.136
I had no interest in going on, but if we were going to watch a mass delusion take

01:04:08.991 --> 01:04:14.553
take shape, certainly I don't want any more mass delusions.

01:04:14.713 --> 01:04:27.716
And I also don't want the idea that once these ideas are out there, that science is afraid somehow to confront Terence Howard's new theory of arithmetic.

01:04:27.756 --> 01:04:29.557
He doesn't have a new theory of arithmetic.

01:04:30.057 --> 01:04:33.118
And somebody needs to be the adult and say,

01:04:34.935 --> 01:04:35.756
This is not right.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:46.685
On the other hand, you have to appreciate that all it takes is one great idea to move the world, and a lot of BS is going to be forgiven.

01:04:46.885 --> 01:04:52.089
And if he has a great idea, I would suggest to you it's likely his concept

01:04:53.038 --> 01:05:10.275
of a six-rotor drone that he calls the linchpin that's based on a mathematical error where he's fit six pentagons through the edges of a regular tetrahedron, giving him six degrees of freedom which span

01:05:11.338 --> 01:05:20.603
what we would call the Lie algebra of the affine group, giving him the ability to rotate around a center and move to any point in three-dimensional space.

01:05:21.204 --> 01:05:22.925
It's an incredibly cool idea.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.225
Now, I don't know that it's his.

01:05:24.365 --> 01:05:26.287
I believe that it's his, but I don't know that.

01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:32.830
So I think what he's talking about is a way of arranging the rotors on a drone to give it maximum maneuverability.

01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:38.654
And I'm not really sure I'm even buying this idea unless you're talking about something moving in space.

01:05:39.574 --> 01:05:40.595
like without gravity.

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:53.360
It's an extremely narrow level of bullshit here that I, unfortunately, I can't, I would have to go back to their video and discuss or listen to what he was saying.

01:05:53.901 --> 01:05:56.782
There are plenty of people in the chat in part of our group.

01:05:56.862 --> 01:05:57.883
There's a couple of pilots.

01:05:59.143 --> 01:06:01.404
We could go into this if we wanted to, to see what it is.

01:06:01.444 --> 01:06:09.008
But my assumption is, is that it is some aspect of this geometry that he said, you know, if you make a drone this shape with the,

01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:16.284
With the rotors here or whatever that you would be able to do something that other drones have a little harder time doing or something like that.

01:06:16.384 --> 01:06:16.744
I don't know.

01:06:17.325 --> 01:06:19.666
You're never going to beat a helicopter and a swashplate.

01:06:19.746 --> 01:06:23.249
So I don't really understand the everybody getting all excited about it.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:28.593
The ultimate flying machine has already been made and it's the helicopter.

01:06:28.613 --> 01:06:29.934
I don't know why we're worse.

01:06:30.374 --> 01:06:31.775
It's silly to debate this.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:32.816
Doesn't that work?

01:06:32.976 --> 01:06:34.217
I'm not a drone operator.

01:06:34.637 --> 01:06:37.538
So I don't realize what the state of the art is.

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:55.203
But imagine that that was the only thing that he did and that he figured out that these things could fit together as per the Intel drone shows to form capsids in the shape of dodecahedrons, much the way we see viruses doing that with capsimers and protein coats.

01:06:55.504 --> 01:06:57.064
What is he talking about?

01:06:57.104 --> 01:07:01.465
He's saying that the drones will assemble into a capsid-like structure and fly around?

01:07:01.545 --> 01:07:02.946
Or what in the hell?

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:07.289
holy shit, in three-dimensional space.

01:07:07.889 --> 01:07:09.631
It's an incredibly cool idea.

01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:10.892
Now, I don't know that it's his.

01:07:10.912 --> 01:07:12.993
I believe that it's his, but I don't know that.

01:07:13.073 --> 01:07:13.894
I haven't done that work.

01:07:14.054 --> 01:07:18.637
I'm not a drone operator, so I don't realize what the state of the art is.

01:07:19.178 --> 01:07:32.068
But imagine that that was the only thing that he did and that he figured out that these things could fit together as per the Intel drone shows to form capsids in the shape of dodecahedrons, much the way we see viruses

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:39.393
doing that with capsomeres and protein coats to protect the genetic material.

01:07:39.713 --> 01:07:48.980
That's an extraordinary... Oops, I'll just make a parallel between Terrence Howard's drone idea and viral capsid assembly.

01:07:49.821 --> 01:07:50.622
And what are we doing?

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:56.186
We are suggesting that these things are definitely real.

01:07:57.007 --> 01:08:01.030
That capsids assemble, that they make this dodecahedron shape,

01:08:01.963 --> 01:08:02.544
And they may.

01:08:03.144 --> 01:08:04.245
They may very well do it.

01:08:04.305 --> 01:08:07.288
The point is, is that why is he bringing that up?

01:08:07.348 --> 01:08:11.132
There's a million examples of geometry that he could bring up that he doesn't bring up.

01:08:11.192 --> 01:08:14.615
Could be an incredible contribution of Terrence Howard.

01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:27.929
And the thing that really disgusts me is watching my colleagues make fun of Terrence as easily where he is right as where he is wrong.

01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:28.969
It doesn't require that.

01:08:29.009 --> 01:08:30.811
He's clearly a self-taught guy.

01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:37.116
He pronounces words like canonically, canonically, which indicates that he's teaching himself.

01:08:38.126 --> 01:08:47.531
And for all of this talk of the Neil deGrasse Tyson's, where they say, I'm so pleased to see active minds engaging with the world of ideas, they're really not.

01:08:48.592 --> 01:08:54.355
And my feeling about this is pretending that Terrence Howard is a fool or an idiot,

01:08:56.947 --> 01:08:57.928
is repugnant to me.

01:08:58.128 --> 01:09:10.993
I mean, if you just take what he said about tones and the periodic table, because of some good fortune in my life, I was able to go out to none other than one of the greatest musicians now living, Stanley Jordan.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:24.861
and say, Stanley, let's share your work on playing the periodic table by using the ionization energies as frequency information, much the way Terence was discussing.

01:09:25.001 --> 01:09:29.083
So my feeling is that a lot of my colleagues just don't have enough knowledge.

01:09:29.683 --> 01:09:33.565
And even though- But lucky he knows like a world class bass player.

01:09:33.626 --> 01:09:40.409
And so he could verify that, I guess, hydrogen and carbon are both in the key of E. Did he actually say that?

01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:40.710
No.

01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:49.579
He said that he went and had some bass player play the periodic table using the ionization energies as frequency information.

01:09:49.619 --> 01:09:55.785
He didn't say that he confirmed anything predicted by the model of Terence Howard.

01:09:55.865 --> 01:09:58.548
Be very conscious of that.

01:09:59.509 --> 01:10:00.931
He may be trying to imply it.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:07.359
The next question or words out of Piers Morgan may imply it, but that's not what he said.

01:10:07.399 --> 01:10:09.039
That's not what happened, you see?

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.021
So it's a really, really deceptive little shit game they're playing here.

01:10:14.221 --> 01:10:15.842
Tones in the periodic table.

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:35.323
Because of some good fortune in my life, I was able to go out to none other than one of the greatest musicians now living, Stanley Jordan, and say, Stanley, let's share your work on playing the periodic table by using the ionization energies

01:10:36.003 --> 01:10:38.964
as frequency information, much the way Terrence was discussing.

01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:43.185
So my feeling is, is that a lot of my colleagues just don't have enough knowledge.

01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:49.507
And even though they're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats, they're not behaving like professors.

01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:52.427
They're not behaving like academicians.

01:10:52.507 --> 01:10:54.528
They're making fun of me.

01:10:55.028 --> 01:10:56.828
Academagicians, what did he say?

01:10:56.868 --> 01:10:57.769
That's my word.

01:10:59.869 --> 01:11:00.589
What did he say?

01:11:00.609 --> 01:11:01.850
Holy shit.

01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:09.882
And even though they're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats, they're not behaving like professors.

01:11:09.922 --> 01:11:12.803
They're not behaving like academicians.

01:11:12.883 --> 01:11:14.264
They're making fun of somebody.

01:11:14.284 --> 01:11:18.845
Oh, academicians, not academy magicians.

01:11:19.225 --> 01:11:21.025
I'm saying academy magicians.

01:11:21.085 --> 01:11:22.166
He said academy.

01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:23.906
Wow.

01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:27.127
They're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats.

01:11:27.895 --> 01:11:29.396
They're not behaving like professors.

01:11:29.436 --> 01:11:32.298
They're not behaving like academicians.

01:11:32.398 --> 01:11:37.102
They're making fun of somebody because it allows them to work out their own personal interests.

01:11:37.142 --> 01:11:37.903
He said it wrong.

01:11:37.943 --> 01:11:39.084
He's probably self-taught.

01:11:39.184 --> 01:11:39.764
Exactly.

01:11:39.844 --> 01:11:40.305
Nice one.

01:11:40.345 --> 01:11:41.165
That's a good dunk.

01:11:41.245 --> 01:11:41.726
Securities.

01:11:41.766 --> 01:11:43.147
And that's not going to happen on my watch.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:12:11.554
It's actually really fascinating, because unless I'm mistaken, what you're saying is, look, you might be wrong about 99% of this stuff, but the 1% might be really significant, which is staggering to me that Terrence Howard has gone through life as a movie actor, is suddenly doing stuff which is, to you, quite groundbreaking in the very complex world of science and mathematics and so on.

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:14.376
It's not in science and it's not in mathematics.

01:12:14.816 --> 01:12:29.966
If he's doing something that I recognize, it's in engineering, art, and it's possible that he's doing something, you know, I was able to recognize where his shapes come from, where Neil does not appear to understand, which is fine.

01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:38.652
So, you know, there's some very beautiful geometry, but it doesn't appear to me to be at a research level.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.054
And I don't want to conflate

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.703
Again, I'm not being, I'm hardly a pushover.

01:12:46.743 --> 01:12:51.226
I'm saying he's wrong in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

01:12:51.306 --> 01:12:56.909
In fact, it doesn't rise to the level of a theory that needs to be actively considered.

01:12:57.509 --> 01:13:06.455
That said, to dismiss everything he's saying because we can find, you know, sometimes a fly lands in your dish

01:13:07.697 --> 01:13:11.441
And you insist that it be taken back at a restaurant.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.103
Other times you just say, you know, five second rule.

01:13:14.363 --> 01:13:14.884
You're hungry.

01:13:15.684 --> 01:13:17.386
And it's not the fault of the restaurant.

01:13:17.566 --> 01:13:19.508
And you just let it go.

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:24.052
And my feeling about this is what Neil did

01:13:24.873 --> 01:13:26.214
is really troubling.

01:13:26.254 --> 01:13:33.558
What he did is that he advertised a fake openness, which is just submit what your work is to a peer-reviewed journal.

01:13:34.358 --> 01:13:53.409
Neil either doesn't know the history of peer review, doesn't know why it's called peer review, has no concept of what peer review actually is, which is bizarre, or he does know, and he's deliberately going to waste Terrence Howard's time because Terrence isn't a peer.

01:13:54.551 --> 01:13:59.553
And the whole concept of peer review, the word peer isn't like a jury of your peers.

01:13:59.713 --> 01:14:07.255
So now we're agreeing to discuss the idea that peer review requires you to be a peer.

01:14:07.315 --> 01:14:23.881
And since Terrence Howard isn't a peer, like he's not an academy magician, he doesn't have a tenure track position, he doesn't have a lab, then no one in peer review is gonna take him seriously, which is a very, very stupid, very, very, very stupid idea.

01:14:26.474 --> 01:14:29.076
It's really silly to think that that's the case.

01:14:31.297 --> 01:14:32.418
It's not the case at all.

01:14:32.478 --> 01:14:36.820
And even if it was, it's not the way that he's portraying it here.

01:14:39.402 --> 01:14:41.503
I don't have a faculty position anymore.

01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:48.147
And I think you're going to see in the future, me probably having a article or two somewhere.

01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:53.231
I don't know if they will be peer reviewed in this sense or if they will just be published.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:58.806
We are having an argument right now about something we all agree is broken.

01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:02.068
The publishing in science is broken.

01:15:02.128 --> 01:15:03.709
The p-value thing is broken.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.710
The null hypothesis testing is broken.

01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:07.792
Grant calls have broken it.

01:15:08.032 --> 01:15:10.814
And yet we're not talking about any of that at all.

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:16.818
Instead, we're spending a lot of time talking about what peer review is or isn't or whether somebody understands what it is or it isn't.

01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:23.242
And now we're going to discuss whether or not he's a peer and therefore he's even qualified to get peer review.

01:15:24.434 --> 01:15:25.395
fellow citizens.

01:15:26.115 --> 01:15:29.057
It's like peers in terms of the House of Lords.

01:15:29.698 --> 01:15:39.705
The whole idea of peer review is to keep the laity, the people who don't do science for a living or medicine for a living, out of the review process.

01:15:40.762 --> 01:15:42.164
And that's where it was born.

01:15:42.344 --> 01:15:47.289
That's why it grew up in the 60s and 70s as peer review.

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:55.959
It was as part of a struggle where scientists wanted to wall off their kingdom and say, look, we are taking public.

01:15:55.999 --> 01:15:59.203
See, and so what he's suggesting is it's the scientists that did it.

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:02.010
The scientists did it.

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:05.592
The scientists are bad guys because they don't want to go under scrutiny.

01:16:05.632 --> 01:16:07.853
They want to hold all the information to themselves.

01:16:08.373 --> 01:16:10.574
It couldn't have been weaponized piles of money.

01:16:12.574 --> 01:16:15.455
It couldn't have been the weaponized piles of money of universities.

01:16:15.515 --> 01:16:18.316
It couldn't have been the weaponized piles of money of funding agencies.

01:16:18.396 --> 01:16:19.457
It couldn't have been any of these people.

01:16:19.477 --> 01:16:24.939
It was the scientists who wanted to wall off their knowledge from public scrutiny.

01:16:27.785 --> 01:16:29.727
money but we don't want public review.

01:16:30.088 --> 01:16:31.709
You're not qualified to be here.

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:32.891
Shut up.

01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:34.472
Get out of our lab and let us work.

01:16:35.433 --> 01:16:44.663
And that's why it's so fiercely defended is because it's the last ditch effort to keep the laity from interfering in matters that they can't understand.

01:16:47.262 --> 01:16:58.966
Science itself has been under probably a bigger public assault in terms of its validity as a result of the COVID pandemic than I can ever remember in my lifetime, certainly.

01:16:59.146 --> 01:17:08.609
Is it damaging when everybody on social media suddenly becomes an epidemiologist, whatever it may be, you know, a different type of scientist?

01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:10.930
He can't even say epidemiologist right now?

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:15.772
After four and a half years of doing this job, he can't say epidemiologist or whatever it's called?

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:16.512
Wow.

01:17:18.385 --> 01:17:20.646
I can't be bothered to read those words anymore.

01:17:21.107 --> 01:17:21.667
Wow.

01:17:22.227 --> 01:17:23.488
That's extraordinary.

01:17:24.489 --> 01:17:25.669
What a piece of garbage.

01:17:25.989 --> 01:17:26.390
Certainly.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:38.456
Is it damaging when everybody on social media suddenly becomes an epidemiologist, whatever it may be, any different type of science you like, or medical expert, whatever?

01:17:39.517 --> 01:17:49.747
When their views get amplified, like Terence Howard, if they're completely wrong, they get amplified and shared gazillions of times, as has happened here with all of the things that he said.

01:17:50.448 --> 01:17:53.331
Is it damaging to the integrity of science when that happens?

01:17:53.571 --> 01:18:00.638
And is that a unique problem with social media amplifying amateur scientific and medical views?

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:03.471
It's a very interesting question.

01:18:04.031 --> 01:18:06.494
I would think... A very interesting question.

01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:07.856
I totally agree.

01:18:07.876 --> 01:18:09.157
Stop lying!

01:18:09.177 --> 01:18:13.161
I think that we would begin somewhere else.

01:18:13.301 --> 01:18:21.210
The greatest damage is when we amplify pseudoscientists who happen to be official pseudoscientists.

01:18:22.211 --> 01:18:23.673
So when you take

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:37.255
a director of NAIA, National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, and take that person's contradictory pronouncements.

01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:46.435
and you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is because they're trying to make a decision for their child.

01:18:46.535 --> 01:18:49.398
And suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology.

01:18:50.099 --> 01:19:02.351
Oh, so they weren't thrust into advanced biology when lateral flow tests and PCR tests were used to quarantine people like from their own 50 year long spouse?

01:19:04.096 --> 01:19:10.083
So they weren't put into any jeopardy before the shot was rolled out.

01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:18.613
They weren't put into any situation where informed consent might be compromised until the shot came out.

01:19:19.194 --> 01:19:21.096
Do you hear how much of a liar this guy is?

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:30.162
This is awful and this is exactly, I mean EXACTLY what they planned to do all along.

01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:34.924
This is EXACTLY the script that they've been running the clock out in order to play out.

01:19:34.984 --> 01:19:37.085
This is EXACTLY the game they're playing.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:58.586
in a nutshell for allergies and infectious disease and you take that person's contradictory pronouncements and you amplify those then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is because they're trying to make a decision for their child and suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology

01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:03.501
because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institutes of Health.

01:20:03.621 --> 01:20:11.548
But they didn't amplify any pseudoscience coming out of the National Institutes of Health when Peter Daszak was publishing with Shengxi Li.

01:20:12.049 --> 01:20:14.271
That wasn't amplifying pseudoscience.

01:20:14.771 --> 01:20:16.773
When they published Gain of Function,

01:20:17.774 --> 01:20:31.241
potential papers in bat caves for years and gain a function as a debate in flu, they weren't spreading any misinformation of the NIH or CDC or who at that time.

01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:43.126
The misinformation spreading is explicitly and exclusively dedicated to or focused on and centered on the shot.

01:20:45.187 --> 01:20:45.648
That's what

01:20:46.673 --> 01:20:52.358
O-G-I-D-W wants to tell us.

01:20:52.398 --> 01:21:12.535
A person's contradictory pronouncements, and you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is, because they're trying to make a decision for their child, and suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology, because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health.

01:21:13.893 --> 01:21:16.836
or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA.

01:21:18.217 --> 01:21:32.891
The failure and the pseudoscience is coming from inside the house or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency into advanced biology because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health.

01:21:34.251 --> 01:21:36.693
or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

01:21:36.773 --> 01:21:38.335
Whoa!

01:21:38.415 --> 01:21:44.339
Well, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was the guys that were in charge of the sequencing for the first year and a half or so.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:52.326
And so they did orchestrate the data, which was misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen.

01:21:55.336 --> 01:21:57.317
They controlled all the swabs centrally.

01:21:57.377 --> 01:22:05.902
They were brought in maybe because they just wanted to sequence the DNA, you know, like do a restriction enzyme map or amplify everybody's DNA so they could get a sample of it.

01:22:08.183 --> 01:22:14.186
I don't know what to tell you ladies and gentlemen, but they're saying this stuff out loud because the panic has set in.

01:22:15.407 --> 01:22:22.551
They need desperately to get in front again and they're never going to get in front because they can't get in front of their own lies anymore.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:33.422
The failure amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health, or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

01:22:33.502 --> 01:22:46.205
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency was also the agency which ran the domain server which purported to find silicoxib, famotidine, remdesivir, and ivermectin.

01:22:48.277 --> 01:22:56.441
And so is he stating that the mainstream media, the national security state, amplified misinformation from DITRA?

01:22:57.161 --> 01:23:00.123
Because Robert Malone actually worked for DITRA.

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:05.826
So are they still amplifying fake information from DITRA here?

01:23:06.606 --> 01:23:08.007
Do you see the problem with this?

01:23:08.027 --> 01:23:09.588
This is pretty extraordinary.

01:23:10.248 --> 01:23:11.348
He must have read that.

01:23:12.662 --> 01:23:18.908
Like mentioning DITRA is not, like of all the things you could have said, you could have just said intelligence agencies or I don't know who.

01:23:19.948 --> 01:23:21.950
I'm gonna go back one more time and let you hear it again.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:30.678
And you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is because they're trying to make a decision for their child.

01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:38.525
And suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.841
or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA.

01:23:44.202 --> 01:23:48.584
The failure and the pseudoscience is coming from inside the house.

01:23:49.424 --> 01:24:07.672
The problem is when a Francis Collins and an Anthony Fauci in private emails can turn their dissenting colleagues, fully competent expert dissident colleagues, like Jay Bhattacharya and his colleagues at Harvard and Oxford, and overnight they become fringe epidemiologists.

01:24:08.462 --> 01:24:08.682
Right.

01:24:09.123 --> 01:24:22.061
So more or less, which is so now we're again, going back to this idea that the Great Barrington Declaration and those three guys advocating for focused lockdowns just on old people and focused vaccination of old people.

01:24:25.655 --> 01:24:44.052
are right and that Tony Fauci and Francis Collins in their private emails made an ass of themselves by calling them fringe epidemiologists like this is all part of the Scooby-Doo episode that all of us were involved in for four years that started already four years ago almost five now

01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:52.154
And so the idea that he's talking to Pierce as though this is, you know, my unique cutting-edge take on this is the Scooby-Doo.

01:24:52.214 --> 01:24:55.957
This is the exact national security narrative.

01:24:55.997 --> 01:25:03.001
It's the exact national security narrative that they were hired to trick us into accepting.

01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:07.645
They contracted Twitter and Facebook

01:25:08.607 --> 01:25:27.372
and Peter Thiel and private, I don't know, LLCs and podcasters to teach us this narrative and exactly the narrative that he's talking about, about emails and about Senate arguments and about misappropriated funds from USAID.

01:25:29.132 --> 01:25:31.693
It's all the same mythology.

01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:39.273
And we spent four years trying to figure out that mystery, and that's why it's so hard to pull our heads out.

01:25:39.293 --> 01:25:43.554
What you're seeing is not a failure of science.

01:25:44.335 --> 01:25:49.196
What you're seeing is a failure of science to disavow public health.

01:25:49.836 --> 01:25:51.237
Public health is not science.

01:25:52.057 --> 01:26:00.940
Public health is an incredibly bizarre field that tries to straddle two worlds of actual truth and the noble lie.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:11.644
And as I've said before, the problem is the failure to cancel an ex-spouse's credit card privileges.

01:26:12.064 --> 01:26:17.127
When the person takes the credit card on a spree, science did not cancel its credit card.

01:26:18.152 --> 01:26:19.673
that it had given to public health.

01:26:20.154 --> 01:26:37.487
And so what we had was an incredible destruction of trust in science, which is completely unwarranted, because people who are not acting as scientists, who may have at one time been scientists, but have gone over to public policy, were allowed to lie on science's behalf.

01:26:38.288 --> 01:26:39.209
That's a failure.

01:26:39.329 --> 01:26:41.451
Yeah, I understand why the credit rating got beaten up.

01:26:41.491 --> 01:26:44.253
But what they're talking about is lying about the mRNA.

01:26:44.273 --> 01:26:47.095
They're not talking about lying about pandemic potential.

01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:47.776
They're not lying.

01:26:47.956 --> 01:26:50.238
They're not talking about lying about gain of function.

01:26:50.278 --> 01:26:52.720
And they're not talking about lying about the lab leak.

01:26:54.402 --> 01:27:00.727
They're not talking about lying about murder in New York City for all of these illusions to take hold.

01:27:02.708 --> 01:27:07.531
And this is a giant omission which requires them to not talk about 2020 and 2021.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:17.316
But for God's sakes, just cut off the credit card and learn where scientists lie and where they do not.

01:27:17.456 --> 01:27:19.016
They don't lie generically.

01:27:19.036 --> 01:27:21.338
There's nothing wrong with Hooke's law.

01:27:21.518 --> 01:27:23.959
There's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.120
Whoa, Hooke's law.

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:27.141
Well, let's just...

01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:29.836
Let's just see.

01:27:29.936 --> 01:27:30.837
What's Hooke's Law?

01:27:31.077 --> 01:27:33.577
Anybody know off the top of their head what Hooke's Law is?

01:27:33.617 --> 01:27:44.841
Just so we... Hooke's Law is an imperial law that states that the force needed to extend or compress a string by some distance scales linearly with respect to that distance.

01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:47.042
It's a law about springs.

01:27:47.182 --> 01:27:47.622
Interesting.

01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:50.863
And the adapter hypothesis.

01:27:51.043 --> 01:27:53.484
If there are any biologists in the neighborhood,

01:27:54.366 --> 01:27:59.069
who know what the adapter hypothesis is, please put it in the chat now, because I bet you don't.

01:28:10.576 --> 01:28:11.677
Does anybody know what it is?

01:28:11.697 --> 01:28:13.378
Adapter hypothesis?

01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:16.239
Please tell me you know what it is if you do, because I didn't know.

01:28:16.319 --> 01:28:17.800
I never heard it called that before.

01:28:19.121 --> 01:28:21.342
Catheter organic, shrugging her shoulders.

01:28:21.903 --> 01:28:22.103
Nope.

01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:23.463
Nope.

01:28:24.204 --> 01:28:28.028
OK, let's show you what the adapter hypothesis is according to Wikipedia.

01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:29.310
What the hell?

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:35.696
Why won't that work?

01:28:35.716 --> 01:28:40.481
I'm going to do this, and then I do this.

01:28:40.602 --> 01:28:41.102
Does that work?

01:28:41.322 --> 01:28:41.903
Yeah, there we go.

01:28:42.637 --> 01:28:58.543
The adapter hypothesis is a theoretical scheme in molecular biology to explain how information encoded in the nucleic acid sequences of messenger RNA is used to specify the amino acids that make up proteins during the process of translation.

01:29:02.625 --> 01:29:11.929
It's from Francis Crick and he postulated that there must exist a small molecule to precisely recognize and bind the mRNA sequences while amino acids are being synthesized.

01:29:13.163 --> 01:29:17.287
synthesized, I didn't think they were synthesized, I thought they were brought in by transfer RNA.

01:29:17.828 --> 01:29:25.796
The hypothetical adapter molecule was later established to be here, here there are two unknown nucleic acid transfer RNA.

01:29:28.339 --> 01:29:34.566
So the adapter hypothesis was a hypothesis that there would be another molecule that would adapt the

01:29:35.416 --> 01:29:40.139
the mRNA code to whatever changes it to a protein.

01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:43.021
And there would have to be something that would adapt or match to it.

01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:46.323
And that would be later discovered transfer RNA.

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:52.287
So it's part of this whole central dogma of molecular biology.

01:29:53.168 --> 01:29:57.011
But for some reason, the physicist

01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:03.461
polymath named Eric Weinstein just says the adapter hypothesis and nothing else.

01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:25.827
And there's no doubt in Hooke's law, which is about springs and the adapter hypothesis, which is about the canonical idea of RNA, DNA, RNA to protein and the role that mRNA and transfer RNAs play in that

01:30:27.509 --> 01:30:28.491
in that physiology.

01:30:31.057 --> 01:30:32.681
So it's an extraordinary statement.

01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:36.128
I want to play it again to make sure that you hear exactly how hardcore it is.

01:30:38.223 --> 01:30:39.164
That's a failure.

01:30:39.484 --> 01:30:49.312
I understand why the credit rating got beaten up, but for God's sakes, just cut off the credit card and learn where scientists lie and where they do not.

01:30:49.472 --> 01:30:51.013
They don't lie generically.

01:30:51.053 --> 01:30:53.335
There's nothing wrong with Hooke's law.

01:30:53.515 --> 01:30:56.657
There's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis in biology.

01:30:57.098 --> 01:31:02.642
That statement right there leads me to believe that there's definitely something wrong with the adapter hypothesis in biology.

01:31:04.076 --> 01:31:15.863
And the adapter hypothesis really is at the center of the idea that we are DNA to RNA through a ribosome to protein and that everything else outside of that is outside of us.

01:31:16.583 --> 01:31:18.264
Retroviruses are pathogens.

01:31:18.784 --> 01:31:20.425
RNA viruses are pathogens.

01:31:20.505 --> 01:31:22.806
DNA anteroviruses are pathogens.

01:31:22.847 --> 01:31:28.850
They're all things that are outside of us that need to be understood as things that we exist despite of.

01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:39.135
So there's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis is something that this physicist mathematician should not be saying unless it's part of his script.

01:31:39.495 --> 01:31:40.295
Stop lying!

01:31:42.157 --> 01:31:46.099
There's nothing wrong with most of what we consider to be science.

01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:49.181
We lie in very special places out of necessity.

01:31:50.365 --> 01:32:05.426
out of necessity you mean like about gain of function and the presumed pathogenic sorry uh pandemic potential that exists in nature you see he says it without saying it he says it in such an obvious way that it's almost laughable

01:32:06.769 --> 01:32:10.972
Could bring in the other two guests now to debate actually what you've been saying.

01:32:11.253 --> 01:32:18.598
Professor Brian Keating, cosmologist from San Diego University, and Tom Bellio, who's the Impact Theory podcast host.

01:32:18.758 --> 01:32:23.242
Professor Keating, your response to what you've just been hearing from Eric?

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:39.950
Well, I think scientists, I mean, I don't know what the impact theory guy has done before he started a podcast, but if they introduced me as the host of a podcast and put me on with, with two other people that were going to claim expertise, I would just log out.

01:32:42.759 --> 01:32:43.600
Like, what is this?

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:45.561
Why would he be there?

01:32:45.661 --> 01:32:46.902
What is his expertise?

01:32:46.982 --> 01:32:55.667
Why is he going to talk with the polymath, Eric Weinstein, and servant of Peter Thiel, and the cosmologist?

01:32:55.747 --> 01:32:57.148
What is he doing there?

01:32:57.728 --> 01:33:04.112
Other than because he's part of the Intellectual Dark Web pseudo-intellectual podcast network.

01:33:05.834 --> 01:33:07.175
We have a responsibility.

01:33:07.555 --> 01:33:10.616
Eric's known for coining the term the intellectual dark web.

01:33:10.656 --> 01:33:18.559
And I feel like as scientists, we have a responsibility to keep the environmental, intellectual environment clear of pollution.

01:33:19.459 --> 01:33:27.122
And I feel like there is a tendency, because of this anti-authoritarian moment that we seem to be in, to view science as authoritarian.

01:33:27.662 --> 01:33:39.507
And then to rebel against it, we look to heroes and people like Terrence or Candace Owens or people like Tucker Carlson, and they get enormous platforms because of their social media stature.

01:33:40.067 --> 01:33:50.232
But to me, you know, to listen to people who have no domain expertise and no proven track record is an affront to actual practicing scientists.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:51.932
And it's fine to have a hobby.

01:33:51.972 --> 01:33:55.293
It's fine to do things out of an avocation, a love for it.

01:33:55.693 --> 01:33:59.755
But it's a bit, to me, an example of the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias.

01:33:59.995 --> 01:34:02.235
And you have people you're listening to.

01:34:02.275 --> 01:34:08.237
In some cases, it's akin to listening to your friend peers, Andrew Tate, for marital advice.

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:18.641
He may be a great MMA star, and Terrence may be a great actor, but that gives them no and confers no benefit to their scientific practices.

01:34:19.282 --> 01:34:23.964
And it'd be like me going onto the set of Iron Man and trying to be like Terrence.

01:34:24.004 --> 01:34:26.645
You would laugh me off the stage, and rightfully so.

01:34:26.785 --> 01:34:36.489
That's just ridiculous that one craft is equal to another, that intellectual thinking and philosophy and natural science is the same as acting.

01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:44.514
And so if you have a skill as an actor, then you've developed it just like if you have an understanding of physics, you've developed it.

01:34:44.574 --> 01:34:47.435
It's really, it's really incredible, right?

01:34:47.655 --> 01:34:49.256
Like it's really, really incredible.

01:34:52.838 --> 01:35:01.023
And they're not acknowledging the fact that first and foremost, as an actor, it would be very easy for him to do what he's doing with cooperation of Eric Weinstein.

01:35:01.724 --> 01:35:05.386
Like it's possible that the only two people in on this joke are Eric and Terrence.

01:35:06.809 --> 01:35:07.429
It's possible.

01:35:07.449 --> 01:35:12.890
I have to look at and examine these claims that amateurs can do good science.

01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:31.354
You know, Eric pointed out in the interview that there's some babies in with the bathwater, and I'd love to ask my dear friend Eric to expound upon those particular babies, because to me, to say that there might be some angle or something like that or some drone, it sounds to me a little bit like damning with faint praise as well, because

01:35:31.854 --> 01:35:38.838
If you go through and there's 97 patents that he claims he has, we go through them, we find out that very few of them have been granted.

01:35:39.498 --> 01:35:41.359
There may be a couple that have been granted.

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:43.721
You go through one times one equals two.

01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:46.222
Eric demonstrated clearly that's not the case.

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:54.687
You go through the periodic table, his idea- But the whole point of the patent thing to realize from the perspective of the Joe Rogan podcast that

01:35:55.543 --> 01:36:02.466
that Eric Weinstein was on was when the patents were brought up, Eric did not want to talk about them because he said the patents don't prove anything.

01:36:04.206 --> 01:36:08.008
He didn't want to talk about it because his dad's an IP, a patent lawyer.

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:18.952
He knows exactly what patents do and how they can be used, how they can be used to create the illusion of value, how they can be used to create the illusion of something existing that doesn't exist.

01:36:21.293 --> 01:36:23.514
If you patent something, it doesn't mean that it works.

01:36:26.556 --> 01:36:33.342
and especially in certain scenarios with certain cases, the patent office spends about 20 minutes on each application at most.

01:36:35.383 --> 01:36:42.709
And so, you know, with the right set of lawyers and the right language, you can patent something that's not necessarily real.

01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:51.096
You can patent something in a broad, broad way, like Robert Malone did when he patented all genetic vaccines somehow.

01:36:54.679 --> 01:36:56.060
And so this kind of,

01:36:57.577 --> 01:37:00.838
It's intellectual dishonesty when they talk about things like this.

01:37:01.018 --> 01:37:06.919
And again, is it four people agreeing or a couple people agreeing about what the important questions are?

01:37:06.959 --> 01:37:15.822
And as long as those important questions are squarely in the middle of the limited spectrum of debate and the presuppositions of the state are reinforced, or at least not questioned,

01:37:16.673 --> 01:37:23.159
Then Pierce Morgan can get all feisty, and so can Weinstein, and so can this cosmologist.

01:37:23.219 --> 01:37:30.345
And then they can defer to the podcast guy who can just say that, you know, I'm one of these guys who learned a lot from podcasting.

01:37:30.385 --> 01:37:34.009
And every time somebody comes on my show, it sure is enlightening for me.

01:37:34.389 --> 01:37:35.471
They're completely wrong there.

01:37:35.831 --> 01:37:47.608
His claims about gravity and building planets, that he's built the planet Saturn or it comes out of a biological digestive process of the sun, these things are completely fallacious.

01:37:47.648 --> 01:37:51.193
So I think there's a danger and it's a symptom of the halo effect.

01:37:52.829 --> 01:37:56.071
Just a point about Andrew Tate, he's a friend of mine, he's someone I've interviewed.

01:37:56.272 --> 01:38:12.606
I think also this talk of the Dunning-Kruger effect, the talk of the halo effect, these are all things that are designed to trap you inside of their limited spectrum of debate, to pretend to you that there are phenomenon that are well understood and very, very seductive.

01:38:12.686 --> 01:38:18.571
And so it's very likely that most of these people are just falling into this, you know, you don't have free will anyway.

01:38:19.716 --> 01:38:38.882
And so this kind of discussion, rather than using simple words like coordinated lying, or ridiculous, or these models of reality fall flat on their face if you try to test them experimentally, rather than putting any meat on this discussion, these people are

01:38:39.542 --> 01:38:42.603
doing the exact opposite and with extraordinary skill.

01:38:43.104 --> 01:38:54.128
Three times, but the point I make about him, I had this debate with someone the other day, is he has a huge following on social media, regardless of whether people like me interview him.

01:38:54.489 --> 01:38:57.670
At least when I interview him, I get a chance to challenge him.

01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:08.675
And I've really noticed when young men in particular come up to me in the street, which they do with alarming regularity about Andrew Tate, that actually the conversation I have with them has moved from,

01:39:09.355 --> 01:39:12.576
God, you know, Andrew Tate, isn't he amazing, blah, blah, blah, too.

01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:15.557
I really liked it when you challenged him about this, this, and this.

01:39:15.597 --> 01:39:24.841
In other words, shining a light on people like Andrew Tate, actually challenging them on a big platform, I see tangible impact on the street.

01:39:25.681 --> 01:39:34.685
Curiously, there was an international COVID sub in November 16th and 17th in Romania, very close to where Andrew Tate lives.

01:39:34.705 --> 01:39:35.345
It's kind of cool.

01:39:35.945 --> 01:39:37.406
Maybe, you know,

01:39:38.846 --> 01:39:43.650
Jessica Rose and Robert Malone had a whiskey with him or something like that.

01:39:43.670 --> 01:39:45.351
You never know, they might all like cigars.

01:39:46.052 --> 01:39:56.579
Those challenges kicking through into people's consciousness, in a way they wouldn't if he was just able to do his thing slightly below radar on social media without ever being challenged.

01:39:56.599 --> 01:40:00.482
So that's my kind of theory about why I interview people like him.

01:40:00.842 --> 01:40:04.385
which is in itself open to debate, obviously.

01:40:04.525 --> 01:40:10.490
Eric, just in that response to the babium bathwater, what would you say to Brian Keating's point there?

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:25.723
Well, I tried to say it already, that if you take the vertices of a tetrahedron as measured from the centre, you're looking at an angle of the arc cosine of minus one third, which is about 109.47 in degrees,

01:40:28.117 --> 01:40:31.021
And if you take the interior angles of a regular Pentagon, it's 108.

01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:34.366
So 108 is not 109.47.

01:40:35.107 --> 01:40:43.779
But it is close enough so that within engineering tolerances, you can put six of these motors into a regular tetrahedron.

01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:53.643
and then you can potentially, therefore, traverse all of the dimensions needed to orient the object around its center of mass and to move it to any point in three-dimensional space.

01:40:54.123 --> 01:40:58.465
I've stated that clearly to any technical person who wants to hear it.

01:40:59.005 --> 01:41:06.248
It may be that there's prior art, and it may be that it doesn't end up being that interesting because of the tolerances or it's too difficult to work, that's fine.

01:41:06.829 --> 01:41:08.629
But I've already stated what the baby is,

01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:23.015
And further, you know, Brian, I was very... I think one of the things that's going on with that drone idea is the idea of not thinking about how real drones move.

01:41:23.735 --> 01:41:29.938
I got to believe that what they're talking about is like an ideal arrangement of rotors

01:41:31.092 --> 01:41:39.557
that at a steady, you know, I don't understand it for sure, but I think they're making an argument that is absolutely dumb.

01:41:40.257 --> 01:41:46.101
Again, mainly I would argue it's dumb because three-dimensional flight has already been solved with a helicopter.

01:41:46.321 --> 01:41:47.882
It can't be done any better than that.

01:41:48.703 --> 01:41:58.010
And if it can be done better, it's not arrangement of static rotors around a three-dimensional space in a very special way like Terence Howard claims to.

01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:07.917
And this guy claims is somehow a mathematical error solution to some combination of mathematical concepts, which he keeps repeating but never explaining.

01:42:08.917 --> 01:42:09.878
And that's how you know.

01:42:09.998 --> 01:42:11.639
That's how this happens, right?

01:42:11.679 --> 01:42:13.641
That's how we got where we are.

01:42:14.707 --> 01:42:18.228
surprised that you just corrected me on social media.

01:42:18.388 --> 01:42:21.689
Now, of course, we're friends, and so I don't mind having this back and forth.

01:42:22.029 --> 01:42:32.751
But you've stated that in my field that peer review is much older than Ghislaine Maxwell, who was born in 1961.

01:42:33.572 --> 01:42:36.132
And you cited a bunch of journals in physics.

01:42:36.672 --> 01:42:38.673
And in fact, that's simply not true.

01:42:40.734 --> 01:42:43.376
So now we're talking about the history of peer review again.

01:42:43.416 --> 01:42:45.398
So we're jumping from question to question.

01:42:45.418 --> 01:42:48.400
We were just talking about Andrew Tate a few seconds ago.

01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:51.403
Like this is not informing people.

01:42:51.463 --> 01:42:58.009
What this is, is exactly what the intellectual dark web and its progeny were designed to do.

01:42:58.789 --> 01:43:05.215
They were designed to create a very lively debate within the limited spectrum of the presuppositions of the state.

01:43:06.636 --> 01:43:07.036
In part,

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:18.506
Well, I have Melinda Baldwin's article here, which says, however, most papers accepted for physical review never went out to referees at all.

01:43:18.666 --> 01:43:25.611
The editor accepted most papers on its own authority, consulting referees only when he thought he might want to reject a paper.

01:43:25.631 --> 01:43:32.255
It was not until the 1960s that all physical review papers were sent out for external referee opinion.

01:43:32.795 --> 01:43:35.117
More or less, peer review comes out of Utah,

01:43:36.378 --> 01:43:47.432
in 1972 through Senator Wallace Bennett's amendment that forced- That's weird because there was a real recent, who said it?

01:43:47.492 --> 01:43:51.697
Somebody said that Jazane Maxwell's dad is responsible for peer review.

01:43:52.915 --> 01:43:54.395
I don't remember where I saw that.

01:43:54.436 --> 01:43:57.276
I'm sure I probably saw it on Twitter, that crap hole, but.

01:43:57.657 --> 01:44:04.079
This is the issue into the NIH framework because the Medicare Act was established.

01:44:04.099 --> 01:44:09.260
Yes, seriously, using Jazain Maxwell as an age is odd.

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:15.062
That's what I think actually also triggered my remembering that I thought they said that Robert Maxwell did that.

01:44:15.122 --> 01:44:16.223
So it's really strange.

01:44:19.145 --> 01:44:19.946
1965 making the U.S.

01:44:20.006 --> 01:44:20.807
taxpayer.

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.329
Did Weinstein say that on Rogan?

01:44:23.409 --> 01:44:23.730
Nice.

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.071
Why didn't he say it here then?

01:44:25.672 --> 01:44:26.492
Isn't that weird?

01:44:27.313 --> 01:44:28.354
I think that's bizarre.

01:44:28.634 --> 01:44:35.761
Responsible for medical payments that they suddenly wanted access to knowing why are we paying all of this money to doctors without the ability to question them.

01:44:36.442 --> 01:44:39.225
So you know in part what I'm astounded by

01:44:40.902 --> 01:44:44.867
is that we're not even aware of our own history.

01:44:45.027 --> 01:44:45.548
If George.

01:44:45.808 --> 01:44:47.410
So I'm aware of our own history.

01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:48.911
I'm learning more all the time.

01:44:49.012 --> 01:44:55.179
Edward Bernays actually in his book said the doctors were really important because people believe doctors whether they're right or wrong.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.681
That's the truth.

01:44:58.443 --> 01:44:59.544
Green the Miller.

01:45:00.097 --> 01:45:11.608
with no formal education, mailed off a solution to an inversion problem for differential operators, which is what gives us Green's functions, which Feynman made famous.

01:45:14.591 --> 01:45:16.273
He didn't have any training whatsoever.

01:45:17.034 --> 01:45:20.937
It's in part very dangerous to be offended

01:45:21.755 --> 01:45:33.571
when people listen to what we say and they then say, I keep hearing that science is for everyone and that mathematics is a great place to play, there are no bad questions.

01:45:34.859 --> 01:45:40.141
And then when they appear to take an interest, we cut their heads off.

01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:44.983
And my feeling is that I'm not going to do that.

01:45:45.063 --> 01:45:46.464
I'm going to state what this is.

01:45:46.504 --> 01:45:48.104
This is an elite activity.

01:45:48.185 --> 01:45:50.385
It's elite the way a violinist is elite.

01:45:50.846 --> 01:45:54.187
It's elite the way a surgeon is an elite brain surgeon.

01:45:54.207 --> 01:46:00.229
You're not going to have somebody say, hey, I've been doing brain surgery in my backyard on my family members, and I'm ready for prime time.

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:06.490
We are not honest about the extent that this is an elite community.

01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:14.891
And the last thing that I would add to what you said is... Okay, so I'm getting a little signal in the chat from Pamela about promise.

01:46:14.971 --> 01:46:21.532
Now, this is partly going back to Bill Barr because Bill Barr was also involved in the promise thing.

01:46:22.613 --> 01:46:31.174
Now, my problem with this is a lot of times, and this is kind of in a public apology to Pamela, I don't have the...

01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:37.904
the cognitive space sometimes to address all the things that people were putting in soapbox up until now.

01:46:37.964 --> 01:46:41.766
And Pamela is one of these people who doesn't just, you know, put a link.

01:46:42.647 --> 01:46:50.111
It's a link with an explanation and it requires some, you know, you have to know your history better than I do.

01:46:51.051 --> 01:47:00.316
That's the worst part of the position that I'm in as a biologist, that I'm still having to go back and realize how many of these assumptions are still working in the background.

01:47:01.653 --> 01:47:10.120
The idea that there was a patient reported outcome measurement information system established in 2004 with the funding of NIH.

01:47:14.631 --> 01:47:16.632
and that Bill Barr was involved in it.

01:47:16.712 --> 01:47:21.376
It's very, very interesting roadmap to medical research.

01:47:21.416 --> 01:47:28.060
The idea that the University of Pittsburgh was involved, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

01:47:29.361 --> 01:47:37.787
They chose some very prominent players in the national security, biosecurity state to be a part of this.

01:47:38.747 --> 01:47:41.949
And it was still going on until 2014, at least, as far as I can see here.

01:47:46.785 --> 01:47:52.068
And they funneled a lot of money to these universities in order for this system to go.

01:47:52.608 --> 01:48:05.876
And so if this information was stolen, and it was stolen by a foreign power, and Bill Barr is tied up into that, this is a really big rock to open up.

01:48:09.338 --> 01:48:11.340
Is Bill Barr's promise is different, I think?

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.862
I'm not sure that that's the case, and we should check that.

01:48:17.004 --> 01:48:21.287
It's the land-grant university system with Harl, Yale, Carl, okay, okay, I see, okay.

01:48:21.848 --> 01:48:27.833
So let me just make sure that I know what I'm doing here, and I'm gonna look into this, I promise that for sure.

01:48:28.638 --> 01:48:39.246
But the problem is, where are the dissident scientists who don't go along inside of the university system, inside of the research institutions?

01:48:39.987 --> 01:48:43.870
If you had them, they would have been tarred and feathered.

01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:51.316
Pamela says it's the same promise, and now he's saying that people inside of academia going against this would have been tarred and feathered.

01:48:51.356 --> 01:48:54.919
Well, interestingly enough, his brother knows that I was thrown out.

01:48:56.084 --> 01:49:00.745
They just told me to go home and not come back and they quietly paid my salary out until October.

01:49:03.026 --> 01:49:11.128
So yes, when people spoke out about transfection, when people spoke out about the lab leak or the coverup or whatever, people were thrown out.

01:49:12.469 --> 01:49:13.089
It's correct.

01:49:13.309 --> 01:49:18.750
It's just funny because him and his brother probably know my name and know my story and are telling this as if they don't.

01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:24.292
Inside of the university system, inside of the research institutions,

01:49:25.057 --> 01:49:35.381
If you had them, they would have been tarred and feathered during DEI because they would have said, who are these foreign intruders into the academic arena?

01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:37.421
We must fire them and get them out.

01:49:37.461 --> 01:49:40.062
Claudine Gay could never have become president of Harvard.

01:49:40.442 --> 01:49:44.784
What we've done is we've gotten rid of all of the dissenting experts.

01:49:45.424 --> 01:49:49.946
And the dissenting experts who are going to get up and at the top of their lungs

01:49:51.241 --> 01:49:55.067
say, hey, we've got a disaster in theoretical physics at the moment.

01:49:56.189 --> 01:50:06.364
We have an abomination in the way in which we are pretending that random mutation is decidedly the main engine

01:50:06.884 --> 01:50:08.185
of Darwinian selection.

01:50:09.045 --> 01:50:13.788
We're going to pretend that neoclassical economics is on solid ground.

01:50:15.329 --> 01:50:19.311
All of these things are just absolutely silly.

01:50:19.911 --> 01:50:28.396
And effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

01:50:29.076 --> 01:50:44.760
And I promise you that it's more expensive to get rid of your dissenters who actually know what they're talking about than it is to open it up to a public that wonders whether they've just shortened the life of their child by giving them an unnecessary experimental pseudovaccine.

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.821
All right, let me bring in- Pseudovaccine.

01:50:47.961 --> 01:50:49.862
Still can't say it.

01:50:53.707 --> 01:51:01.931
He still can't say a already understood methodology.

01:51:01.992 --> 01:51:03.452
They just can't say it.

01:51:04.953 --> 01:51:07.634
It is absolutely malevolent.

01:51:08.435 --> 01:51:09.475
Let's talk to Tom.

01:51:09.635 --> 01:51:11.076
Tom, you've been waiting very patiently.

01:51:11.256 --> 01:51:12.937
Tom, what's your perspective on this?

01:51:14.775 --> 01:51:21.520
So I think the key thing to understand is if you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science, you have already lost.

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:27.363
So the goal here has to be to understand that we are living in the age of conspiracy.

01:51:27.584 --> 01:51:28.784
And that is the problem.

01:51:29.285 --> 01:51:39.752
When I saw the interview with Terrence Howard and Joe Rogan the first time, I just about dislocated my finger dialing Eric to call him up to be like, hey, you have to refute this stuff.

01:51:40.432 --> 01:51:44.595
And so he has Eric Weinstein's phone number, which is also an admission.

01:51:44.975 --> 01:51:57.645
The reason that I was very excited to see that he went on and did that and did that so well, Eric, you are a national treasure, is that it does not matter to me what the elites think in isolation.

01:51:58.763 --> 01:52:05.926
All that happens is if people have an idea that hits a critical mass, they begin to bifurcate.

01:52:05.946 --> 01:52:11.768
I mean, this is like the multiverse where we no longer have a shared vision of what is true.

01:52:12.188 --> 01:52:16.490
That has second and third order consequences that I think are going to be terrifying for the nation.

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:32.574
And when you have a thinker like Eric who can actually go through and say, hey, let me steal, man, what I have heard you say, which Joe and Terrence would not let him do, which I was mortified by because he should have just laid it out here.

01:52:32.654 --> 01:52:33.575
Here are the base assumptions.

01:52:33.976 --> 01:52:34.676
Wow.

01:52:34.796 --> 01:52:36.958
This is the most amazing theater ever.

01:52:37.018 --> 01:52:38.900
I bet the guy in the white shirt doesn't know.

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:40.322
And I bet Pierce doesn't know.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:48.876
Maybe Pierce knows, but man oh man, these two intellectual dark web dudes are cooperating for sure, and that's why he's blowing so much sunshine up.

01:52:49.958 --> 01:53:12.830
up this hole and then we're going to build up from that now the reason that i want that to happen is when an idea whether it is terrible whether it is obviously terrible whether every elite person in the world who does science is like this is the worst idea ever you have i can't help but see him in that intellectual dark web photograph with the black umbrella over him like that that's who he is to me understand because

01:53:13.905 --> 01:53:18.287
of a whole host of things, but certainly COVID being a nice mile marker for us.

01:53:18.807 --> 01:53:23.510
It broke people's trust in elites to lead us properly.

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.150
It broke our trust in science.

01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:31.693
And so now you must, if in fact, I will say scientists, I love you all, you have no obligation to do what I'm saying.

01:53:31.833 --> 01:53:39.137
I beseech you as somebody who wants society to move forward well, that if an idea hits a certain level of critical mass,

01:53:39.617 --> 01:53:57.995
in the public's awareness even if you hate it you are going to have to address it if you want to lead us well forward but you have to do it based on base assumptions so that anybody following along at home that's trying to build their thinking up can go oh I actually understand Terrence's base assumptions one times one equals two

01:53:59.176 --> 01:54:00.777
Uh, all things are in motion.

01:54:00.797 --> 01:54:02.738
There's no straight lines like things that, okay.

01:54:03.018 --> 01:54:04.879
Have I understood your position perfectly?

01:54:04.939 --> 01:54:05.279
Terrence?

01:54:05.379 --> 01:54:06.320
Yes, Eric, you have.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:06.920
Okay.

01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:07.381
Amazing.

01:54:07.441 --> 01:54:15.905
Now I'm going to walk through each of those base assumptions and show you which ones are broken and how that is going to make the rest of your sequencing fall apart.

01:54:16.345 --> 01:54:21.288
If people would just stay focused on utility, these beliefs work in the real world.

01:54:21.748 --> 01:54:23.889
We would be in a much better position.

01:54:23.989 --> 01:54:25.110
That's what I want to see more of.

01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:26.291
Okay, let me bring Brian in.

01:54:26.311 --> 01:54:29.215
Before I come to you, Brian, though, I want to play a clip from Candice Owens.

01:54:29.255 --> 01:54:34.301
This was several days after the debate that... He did what he had to do.

01:54:34.381 --> 01:54:35.903
That was what he was set up to do.

01:54:35.983 --> 01:54:36.904
That was what he did.

01:54:36.984 --> 01:54:38.686
Now he can take a drink and relax.

01:54:38.746 --> 01:54:39.527
And now I said it.

01:54:39.687 --> 01:54:40.268
It's cool.

01:54:40.989 --> 01:54:43.111
Another 10,000 followers today.

01:54:43.452 --> 01:54:44.453
Rogan and Terence Sapp.

01:54:46.061 --> 01:54:48.342
why I am now rejecting the cult of science.

01:54:48.723 --> 01:54:50.264
So many things that they've lied to us about.

01:54:50.364 --> 01:54:54.646
Vaccines, birth control, people that are being injured, and we just accept everything.

01:54:54.706 --> 01:54:59.209
What I said was that science has become a pagan faith.

01:54:59.529 --> 01:55:01.631
Yes, that's what I actually believe.

01:55:02.995 --> 01:55:05.978
You want to say that NASA has satanic origins and so on.

01:55:06.279 --> 01:55:15.048
Now I interviewed Candace myself recently and she's she's a bona fide anti-vaxxers and believe in vaccines at all.

01:55:15.729 --> 01:55:23.938
And she has a big following and lots of people like her out there now saying that because there have been legitimate areas of concern.

01:55:24.699 --> 01:55:31.106
around the COVID vaccines, that everything about them is flawed and wrong.

01:55:31.646 --> 01:55:36.411
And therefore, all the scientists who promoted them are the devil.

01:55:37.072 --> 01:55:39.254
And this stuff gathers momentum.

01:55:39.314 --> 01:55:41.256
I see it spreading like wildfire.

01:55:41.816 --> 01:55:47.103
She also says that Emmanuel Macron's wife is a man, despite having had three kids, and so on.

01:55:47.383 --> 01:55:49.105
And these things gather their own momentum.

01:55:49.165 --> 01:55:57.755
And whilst on one level it's sort of humorous, on another level it's actually, I think, very damaging, because it means that scientists can never be wrong again.

01:55:58.556 --> 01:56:07.179
Because if they're wrong about any one aspect of a big thing like a COVID pandemic, which is fast moving and evolving and changing, if they're wrong about... That's extraordinary.

01:56:07.219 --> 01:56:16.643
See, so he's reinforcing the novel virus, the fact that a million people died and that millions more were saved and that it might have come from a lab, but that's probably ridiculous.

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:19.904
But in any case, a virus is going to come again because Mother Nature did it.

01:56:22.745 --> 01:56:27.687
And so we all agree that it's evolving and that it moves very fast, and this is all bullshit.

01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:35.913
But these are the presuppositions of the state that must be reinforced by this limited spectrum of debate because you're not even going to question them.

01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:37.811
we're just gonna reinforce them.

01:56:37.831 --> 01:56:48.656
We'll state that we all agree here, Tom and the dude in the white shirt and Eric and Pierce all agree that this is a changing, evolving situation with a novel virus.

01:56:48.716 --> 01:57:01.143
Scientists can never be wrong again, because if they're wrong about any one aspect of a big thing like a COVID pandemic, which is fast moving and evolving and changing, if they're wrong about any aspect of it, the whole thing,

01:57:02.003 --> 01:57:26.410
gets trashed by this community here's this this is why we have to understand that this is about the age of conspiracy the very thing that eric i agree with you about that yeah is to say science is about figuring out where we are wrong and if scientists stake their reputation as they have done over the last four or five years entirely on always being right then if i can pull one thread and it falls apart everything is dead but if science

01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:32.212
just gets behind Feynman's statement that this is about distrusting experts and figuring out where they're wrong.

01:57:32.653 --> 01:57:37.015
Now it can become a far more fruitful pursuit of what actually works.

01:57:37.335 --> 01:57:39.376
Okay, Brian, your thoughts on that?

01:57:40.456 --> 01:57:44.938
Yeah, Tom, just because someone's an expert doesn't necessarily mean that you have to distrust them.

01:57:45.298 --> 01:57:48.139
When you look at something, there's a concept called Brandolini's law.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:49.340
Here we go.

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.322
Now we're at a Dunning-Kruger effect, a halo effect, and now we're doing somebody's law.

01:57:55.042 --> 01:57:55.983
Brian, your thoughts on that?

01:57:57.096 --> 01:58:01.580
Yeah, Tom, just because someone's an expert doesn't necessarily mean that you have to distrust them.

01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:08.606
When you look at something, there's a concept called Brandolini's Law, which my kids are nearby, so I'm not going to say it in its full terms.

01:58:08.646 --> 01:58:14.611
But it's basically that it's 10 times easier to produce something that's BS than it is to refute it.

01:58:14.951 --> 01:58:18.715
Therefore, the world is full of unrefuted BS.

01:58:19.035 --> 01:58:24.259
To put that on scientists, to make us the intellectual SEAL Team 6,

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.782
where we can never be wrong.

01:58:26.862 --> 01:58:28.765
The terrorists only have to be right once.

01:58:29.306 --> 01:58:33.851
And everyone else is relying on us, SEAL Team 6, that we're never wrong.

01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:40.039
To put that in perspective, you know, when you listen to people like this, Candace tweeting from her laptop and

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:49.043
enabled by technology that was invented at Bell Labs, that was the byproduct of the space race, which she also denies, moon landings and so forth.

01:58:49.363 --> 01:58:50.463
We're not in new age.

01:58:50.983 --> 01:58:58.386
We're in a pre-scientific age where people can, unfortunately, spread not scientific truth,

01:58:58.846 --> 01:59:04.848
via scientific proof, which Eric, I'm sorry to say, my academic genealogy goes back 17 generations.

01:59:05.349 --> 01:59:09.230
Every single one of those people, including my students, I'm now in my third generation.

01:59:09.250 --> 01:59:10.110
I have graduate students.

01:59:10.471 --> 01:59:14.152
You know, Pamela points out something that this has never been different, right?

01:59:15.152 --> 01:59:19.674
Mark Twain said that a lie circles the globe before the truth gets its pants on.

01:59:20.275 --> 01:59:21.415
So this is a reality

01:59:24.898 --> 01:59:32.002
It is a reality that it was true before social media has become weaponized against us as a result of social media.

01:59:32.542 --> 01:59:36.765
And these people want to pretend that it is not the state.

01:59:38.317 --> 01:59:48.683
and not our governing structure, not weaponized piles of money that have weaponized this control, this manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

01:59:48.763 --> 01:59:50.584
They are not using that against us.

01:59:50.785 --> 02:00:04.633
It is the nature of humanity and bad guys and bad people to lie that is a weakness of this otherwise near utopian communication system.

02:00:06.833 --> 02:00:13.396
Twitter is near-utopian Main Street Town Square.

02:00:14.116 --> 02:00:19.238
Nearly utopian, but not quite, mostly because human nature brings out assholes.

02:00:20.098 --> 02:00:28.241
It has nothing to do with coordinated liars telling us a mythology in order to govern us by it, and that these people are part of it.

02:00:28.261 --> 02:00:29.782
It has nothing to do with that, of course.

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:32.583
What it is, is that there's just so many bad people in the world.

02:00:33.467 --> 02:00:36.688
and so easy for those bad people to put out bad ideas.

02:00:37.328 --> 02:00:38.388
They have their own graduate students.

02:00:38.768 --> 02:00:40.069
They've all been through peer review.

02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:43.049
We didn't have Pergamon Press and Robert Maxwell.

02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.609
That is true.

02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:47.430
Einstein published almost all of his famous papers that were done by peer review.

02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:53.452
In fact, the discovery of gravitational waves, one of the most revolutionary discoveries in all of science.

02:00:53.892 --> 02:01:00.874
That prediction, he first tried to get submitted in the early 1930s, and he didn't want to get it peer reviewed, and there was an error in it.

02:01:01.134 --> 02:01:02.474
He said it would never be detected.

02:01:02.674 --> 02:01:03.235
Imagine that.

02:01:03.375 --> 02:01:04.416
Einstein made a mistake.

02:01:04.756 --> 02:01:11.124
But thanks to peer review, that paper was published in 1936, and it went on to win the Nobel Prize for some of my good friends.

02:01:11.164 --> 02:01:13.006
I've interviewed 20 Nobel laureates on my own.

02:01:13.066 --> 02:01:14.748
It's not thanks to peer review.

02:01:15.429 --> 02:01:17.111
It could have been published without peer review.

02:01:19.668 --> 02:01:20.849
Adventure would have happened.

02:01:20.909 --> 02:01:21.990
That's the part about this.

02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:43.347
That's so ridiculous the other thing that You saw happen here, and you probably didn't all miss it looks like Daniel in the chat didn't miss it There's an illusion of consensus here among these four people that the moon landing is not worth questioning anything about it Right that just happened and because nobody said well hold on a minute I

02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:45.610
No, done.

02:01:46.811 --> 02:01:47.431
A podcast.

02:01:47.992 --> 02:01:52.854
And three of them won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the thing that Einstein thought was impossible.

02:01:53.214 --> 02:01:54.995
We can go back many, many generations.

02:01:55.375 --> 02:01:56.936
And yes, they didn't have presses.

02:01:57.056 --> 02:02:00.838
Of course, the printing press was only... I mean, is Eric really listening at this point?

02:02:00.878 --> 02:02:03.660
Or is he just realizing that, okay, this is what he's going to do now.

02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:04.860
And then I'm going to do the next thing.

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:06.021
What is Eric doing here?

02:02:06.772 --> 02:02:09.213
Has he engaged in a discussion with this guy or not?

02:02:09.233 --> 02:02:13.376
Because it looks like he's paging through the notes that he had pre-printed out.

02:02:13.536 --> 02:02:15.497
A relatively recent invention.

02:02:15.837 --> 02:02:17.918
But you go to the peer review process.

02:02:17.958 --> 02:02:18.539
Look at this!

02:02:18.599 --> 02:02:24.382
Not far from where Peers is right now is the Royal Society, and also not too far away is the Royal Institution.

02:02:24.482 --> 02:02:25.522
I've been to both places.

02:02:25.863 --> 02:02:26.663
I've lectured there.

02:02:27.003 --> 02:02:28.304
And when you go to those places,

02:02:28.604 --> 02:02:40.371
Yes, there wasn't a press, but you gather your peers around you and you do an experiment and that experiment would either fail or pass in real time and you would get feedback from a jury, a real jury of your peers.

02:02:40.856 --> 02:03:09.512
okay eric it's interesting watching oh he just commented to someone next to him so again he had to go on mute it's impressive somebody was telling him to go on mute this guy right here this guy got told to go on mute right after he talked watch watch him end and that experiment would either fail or pass in real time and you would get feedback from a jury okay jury okay eric it's interesting watching elon musk did you see it he said yes

02:03:11.203 --> 02:03:12.325
I was with him actually the other day.

02:03:12.345 --> 02:03:14.528
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:15.850
I have to respond to that.

02:03:15.991 --> 02:03:16.531
Okay.

02:03:16.571 --> 02:03:17.994
What you just said is not true.

02:03:19.296 --> 02:03:23.442
You know, it's just, the fact is, is that Einstein, for the most part,

02:03:26.348 --> 02:03:35.210
Sorry, that was John Tate, who was the editor at Physical Review before Simon Pasternak, before Sam Goudschmidt.

02:03:35.370 --> 02:03:38.731
Yes, it is true that most of Einstein's work was not peer-reviewed.

02:03:38.791 --> 02:03:40.011
That's why he was incensed.

02:03:40.111 --> 02:03:43.232
He'd never sent another paper to Physical Review.

02:03:43.352 --> 02:03:44.673
Did he say his kids were in the room?

02:03:44.713 --> 02:03:45.413
Sorry, I missed that.

02:03:45.473 --> 02:03:48.153
If I'm not incorrect, please check me on it.

02:03:49.194 --> 02:03:49.974
Was that paper peer-reviewed?

02:03:52.642 --> 02:03:58.728
There was one paper with Rosen that was peer-reviewed, which incensed Einstein because he was used to not being peer-reviewed.

02:04:02.819 --> 02:04:08.123
until peer review pointed out by Eddington helped out as well and said that there was an error in the calculation.

02:04:08.323 --> 02:04:10.905
Peer review is not referee review, right?

02:04:11.165 --> 02:04:15.168
We had external referees that were occasionally sought.

02:04:17.169 --> 02:04:26.275
But what you cite about the Royal Society is in fact an error introduced into the literature by Merton, the famous historian of science,

02:04:27.676 --> 02:04:31.058
who is the father of the Merton, of Black Scholes Merton fame.

02:04:32.518 --> 02:04:38.921
And that was an erroneous claim that peer review began, I think, in the 1700s.

02:04:40.242 --> 02:04:44.023
What we currently call peer review is far more recent.

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:49.706
And it is fantastic to find out that our professor does not know

02:04:50.706 --> 02:04:53.708
the history of peer review in its own subjects.

02:04:55.149 --> 02:05:01.873
Because what we have is we have a chorus of people with the highest credentials repeating a fable.

02:05:02.954 --> 02:05:06.316
And we can't always tell when we've been.

02:05:07.997 --> 02:05:09.958
Just that it's a limited spectrum of debate.

02:05:09.998 --> 02:05:19.424
So that's the fable that they're talking about is going to be limited to the history of peer review, the role of peer review, and all these things that aren't related to

02:05:20.144 --> 02:05:27.989
anything to do with the fundamental principles of why we have a biosecurity state, the danger of gain of function, and the idea of a pandemic.

02:05:28.089 --> 02:05:30.311
None of that will ever be questioned here.

02:05:30.431 --> 02:05:43.700
But, you know, whether or not the pseudo vaccines... But I would submit to you, sir, that despite your pedigree, in general, your predecessors were not peer reviewed.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:51.782
in any modern sense of the term, before the 1970s, certainly before the 1960s.

02:05:52.883 --> 02:05:57.624
The beginning of forms for external referees begins, I think.

02:05:57.664 --> 02:06:09.048
What you should realize if you're following along is that there is an alternative to peer review that was going to be blockchain oriented and that Kevin McKernan has been advocating for for a long time.

02:06:10.134 --> 02:06:13.077
and has given presentations about throughout the pandemic.

02:06:13.137 --> 02:06:17.642
So there is a solution coming to this peer review problem, I assure you.

02:06:18.243 --> 02:06:23.889
And the guy from the Human Genome Project has already been queued up with a blockchain story about how that could be fixed.

02:06:23.989 --> 02:06:24.750
I shit you not.

02:06:25.391 --> 02:06:29.795
And actually he's already presented it to the Steve Kirsch podcast and a lot of other places.

02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:35.613
And so again, yes, we are talking about things that have been queued up for years.

02:06:36.414 --> 02:06:44.360
People that were queued up with these ideas for years, and they are pawning them off as though they are just spontaneous, you know, actors.

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:47.062
Spontaneous people trying to do their best.

02:06:47.995 --> 02:06:48.876
That's not the case.

02:06:49.517 --> 02:06:57.965
Just like him and that other guy from Impact Factor being complimentary to each other in this podcast is not accidental.

02:06:58.025 --> 02:06:58.946
They work together.

02:06:59.767 --> 02:07:01.549
They're part of the same narrative network.

02:07:02.210 --> 02:07:06.174
I think in the 1930s under John Tate, I just don't think you know the history.

02:07:07.594 --> 02:07:15.157
I do know it, and in fact, I invite you to go down to the Royal Institution next time you're in London, and you'll see pictures of Michael Faraday, of J.J.

02:07:15.197 --> 02:07:17.058
Thompson, of Eddington.

02:07:17.078 --> 02:07:17.558
You'll see them.

02:07:17.578 --> 02:07:18.358
Look at the face.

02:07:18.418 --> 02:07:19.418
This is a performance.

02:07:19.458 --> 02:07:20.319
This is a theater.

02:07:20.359 --> 02:07:21.459
These people were recruited.

02:07:21.979 --> 02:07:24.960
They are producing propaganda, and it's disgusting.

02:07:25.841 --> 02:07:29.982
In front of audiences, was there a peer review process before journals?

02:07:30.022 --> 02:07:31.623
When would the journal nature start?

02:07:32.714 --> 02:07:32.734
a

02:07:50.167 --> 02:07:57.094
wants to chew through their TV set right now or their laptop as they're listening to this and the reason is they don't care about this.

02:07:57.274 --> 02:08:00.077
It's already done.

02:08:00.117 --> 02:08:01.218
Hold on, let me finish.

02:08:01.338 --> 02:08:04.801
The world cares about people like they want to hear what Joe Rogan has to say.

02:08:04.861 --> 02:08:06.483
They want to hear who goes on his show.

02:08:07.223 --> 02:08:09.784
They are absolutely going to listen to Candace.

02:08:09.804 --> 02:08:11.025
I think, Brian, you brought that up.

02:08:11.385 --> 02:08:12.825
Candace is about to sweep the world.

02:08:13.326 --> 02:08:35.755
And if I could just get you guys on board with the reality that we are in a very difficult moment right now where, yes, you guys are being asked to do a public service, which is to collide with these people who do not have your scientific bona fides, but the average person does not care, but they will actually listen to your collision of ideas for sure, because I took a lot away

02:08:36.135 --> 02:08:37.218
from you talking to Terrence.

02:08:37.278 --> 02:08:39.645
And the first time I heard Terrence, I was like, maybe this is genius.

02:08:39.705 --> 02:08:40.026
I don't know.

02:08:41.445 --> 02:08:42.886
You know, it's so interesting.

02:08:42.966 --> 02:08:55.772
I was going to say, actually, Eric, earlier that I saw Elon Musk recently, met him for the first time, and he did a fascinating Q&A about everything from colonising Mars to humanoid robots and so on.

02:08:56.232 --> 02:09:07.157
But I also, we talked about X and his purchase of Twitter and then taking to X. One of the best things I've seen in terms of populist peer review is community notes now on X.

02:09:07.757 --> 02:09:12.622
where I often see things which are spinning around, which are complete nonsense.

02:09:12.982 --> 02:09:14.804
Here we are talking about X again.

02:09:14.844 --> 02:09:20.110
So for four years, we've been talking about X as the center of social media.

02:09:20.250 --> 02:09:24.955
And that is by design, because these people work for Elon Musk and for Peter Thiel.

02:09:26.196 --> 02:09:29.359
And you see a very well-sourced community note.

02:09:30.236 --> 02:09:39.883
killing it, and it does seem to have an effect, because that in itself, because it's happening in the same medium, starts to also spread like wildfire and tends to kill them quite quickly.

02:09:40.544 --> 02:09:44.046
Are you a fan of what Elon is doing with X?

02:09:44.126 --> 02:09:47.409
Is this helping it as a populist peer reviewing?

02:09:47.449 --> 02:09:47.649
Right.

02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:48.730
Yeah.

02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:55.355
Again, this is, you know, this is one of these Wild West conversations where it's not peer review.

02:09:55.435 --> 02:09:58.037
The whole concept of peer review is peer.

02:09:59.401 --> 02:10:02.302
And community notes is community.

02:10:03.042 --> 02:10:03.283
Right.

02:10:03.463 --> 02:10:07.424
And so in a certain sense the point is it's an anti peer review.

02:10:07.624 --> 02:10:09.065
It's working pretty well right now.

02:10:09.645 --> 02:10:15.007
But keep in mind that Wikipedia worked pretty well until people figured out how to game it.

02:10:15.287 --> 02:10:15.547
Right.

02:10:15.767 --> 02:10:20.429
So my concern is is that what you're looking at with peer review and with

02:10:21.369 --> 02:10:32.021
Community Notes, which is anti-peer review, if you will, is technologies that are in the process of being probed and gamed.

02:10:32.262 --> 02:10:37.227
And just to refute what Tom was saying before, Tom, I don't disagree at all.

02:10:37.267 --> 02:10:39.370
We are going to have to deal with the Candace phenomenon.

02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:41.592
But the reason the Candace phenomenon is happening

02:10:42.353 --> 02:10:45.614
is that you don't have any expert dissident opinion.

02:10:46.074 --> 02:11:00.398
If you have five professors shout me down that I don't know what I'm talking about with respect to peer review, and I happen to be completely right, I will be told that I'm not an academic despite the fact that we all speak the same language and have the same credentials.

02:11:00.978 --> 02:11:04.999
What is going on is that the world is not crying out for Candace Owen.

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:09.721
It's crying out for where is the physician with my daughter's interests at heart?

02:11:10.541 --> 02:11:17.464
Where is the biologist who's willing to stand up to a Tony Fauci and say, I completely disagree?

02:11:17.924 --> 02:11:18.264
Why?

02:11:18.484 --> 02:11:20.845
It's not Bret Weinstein, okay?

02:11:20.885 --> 02:11:31.890
That might be implied here, but it's not Bret Weinstein, because for two and a half years, he had no principles, no knowledge, and couldn't teach anything useful, and still can't say transfection is what this is.

02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:38.312
Transformation is what the J&J shot was, and transduction is what they used to call it before the pandemic.

02:11:38.352 --> 02:11:39.873
They won't say it because they're liars.

02:11:41.834 --> 02:11:48.619
It's an illusion of consensus.

02:11:48.659 --> 02:11:50.200
He says it, fake consensus.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.481
That's what they did to us.

02:11:51.541 --> 02:11:52.702
That's what they did to us.

02:11:52.742 --> 02:11:53.922
That's what they're doing to us.

02:11:53.982 --> 02:11:54.963
That's how it's done.

02:11:55.403 --> 02:11:57.285
We are governed by mythology.

02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:06.786
are basically determined by getting rid of the people who won't shut up and who won't sit down and who won't sing from the hymnal.

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:13.871
And what I'm trying to say is what you just saw was an interchange between two colleagues with a great deal of love and respect for each other.

02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.762
on an issue where I'm claiming that the good professor is simply an error.

02:12:19.343 --> 02:12:35.452
And if you had somebody saying that around the Wuhan lab and the origin of COVID, or the potential danger of the vaccines, or the liability regime in which they were negotiated, that this is an abomination, that we can't sue the manufacturers.

02:12:35.792 --> 02:12:36.753
We never could.

02:12:37.912 --> 02:12:40.233
We couldn't sue him before the pandemic either.

02:12:40.253 --> 02:12:44.035
This is bullshit and totally disingenuous nonsense.

02:12:44.996 --> 02:12:46.476
You would have a totally different world.

02:12:46.536 --> 02:12:48.337
Nobody would be listening to Candace Owens.

02:12:48.357 --> 02:12:50.878
They would be trying to track Jay Bhattacharya.

02:12:50.938 --> 02:12:54.560
They would be trying to track all of the experts.

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:59.823
See, Jay Bhattacharya, again, mentioned as a guy who we have to pay attention to, and I'm sorry, but...

02:13:02.349 --> 02:13:09.612
The last time Jay talked to me, his only real advice for me was to focus on the biology and stop talking about Robert Malone.

02:13:13.493 --> 02:13:26.678
After seeing me three years in a row, talking to me three years in a row, taking selfies, that guy's done nothing for my family.

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:28.259
He's not even a subscriber.

02:13:28.299 --> 02:13:29.759
He's never even donated $10 one time.

02:13:33.755 --> 02:13:35.316
None of them have, don't you see?

02:13:35.436 --> 02:13:36.336
None of them have.

02:13:37.777 --> 02:13:39.578
And I am actually a guy.

02:13:41.098 --> 02:13:48.362
I am actually a guy without a substack, huge following, without any of this support, without any, I'm just a guy.

02:13:51.723 --> 02:13:54.005
And when I was working for Bobby, they ignored me.

02:13:54.065 --> 02:13:56.326
When I was working for CHD, they ignored me.

02:13:56.406 --> 02:14:03.409
And since I've been fired from CHD, they ignore me because that's all they can do because my biology is exactly what they don't want us to learn.

02:14:04.969 --> 02:14:13.113
My subtle take on how the no virus idea could have been used against us as a blunt weapon for four years is not something they want to talk about.

02:14:13.754 --> 02:14:15.555
They do not want an article about that.

02:14:20.137 --> 02:14:22.798
Who were standing up with their interests at heart.

02:14:23.118 --> 02:14:28.381
The big problem in the United States is we used to have experts in the right chairs who dissented.

02:14:29.001 --> 02:14:31.743
And now what you have is a group of people who know to keep their head down.

02:14:32.588 --> 02:14:36.649
Brian, I just want to end with just quick thoughts from you and Tom before we finish.

02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:39.851
Give me some hope about the future of science.

02:14:39.891 --> 02:14:47.633
Clearly, I think it's indisputable that science and the integrity of science and scientists has never been under a bigger attack than it is today.

02:14:47.653 --> 02:14:50.835
A lot of it fuelled by conspiracy theorists and social media.

02:14:51.295 --> 02:14:54.416
Give me some hope for the future of science and its integrity.

02:14:56.161 --> 02:15:10.249
I think the hope comes from my students, the people that I work with, the incredible breakthroughs that I've been witness to both personally and part of a team of 300 scientists that are working to uncover what happened during the first nanosecond in the cosmos' history.

02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:15.592
What kind of breakthroughs do we now unlock knowing that the universe is suffused with dark energy?

02:15:16.132 --> 02:15:23.374
What do we learn about the future, possibly with new technology, like high temperature, room temperature, superconductivity, or perhaps fusion?

02:15:23.874 --> 02:15:26.715
That's never been a more exciting time to be a scientist.

02:15:26.755 --> 02:15:29.536
And to hear about science, it's best days are behind us.

02:15:29.576 --> 02:15:30.536
I think that's nonsense.

02:15:30.896 --> 02:15:40.179
On the other hand, we have to guard against conspiracy theories and flat earthers and all sorts of anti-vaxxers and things like that, because there is always a grain of truth.

02:15:40.259 --> 02:15:43.320
As Isaac Asimov said, if you believe the earth is flat, you're wrong.

02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:47.783
But if you believe it's perfectly round two, you're also wrong, but you're less wrong.

02:15:48.143 --> 02:15:55.148
And I think that what we want to do as scientists is not be held to this impossible secret service level of we can't make a single mistake.

02:15:55.548 --> 02:15:58.250
Recognize that we do make mistakes, but science is self-correcting.

02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:02.833
And part of that self-correction mechanism has to do with being analyzed by your peers.

02:16:03.293 --> 02:16:13.640
Whatever Eric and I disagreed with about in the past, today peer review is perhaps, as I like to say, it's the worst system for gauging scientific process except for all the rest.

02:16:14.401 --> 02:16:14.561
Tom.

02:16:14.581 --> 02:16:17.063
All right.

02:16:17.303 --> 02:16:26.252
So the thing that I really want to make sure that I'm being heard on, uh, Brian, cause you keep repeating, we shouldn't be held to this, uh, team seal team six level of perfection.

02:16:26.592 --> 02:16:27.593
What I'm saying is silent.

02:16:27.853 --> 02:16:29.455
Uh, science has a branding problem.

02:16:29.515 --> 02:16:31.036
You guys created a branding problem.

02:16:31.317 --> 02:16:37.482
I'll just say during COVID where it was, uh, Hey, everybody listened to us and everything is going to be fine.

02:16:37.502 --> 02:16:39.084
The branding masks don't work by

02:16:39.404 --> 02:16:43.326
See, the branding problem of science did not happen during COVID.

02:16:43.366 --> 02:16:44.347
That is an illusion.

02:16:44.407 --> 02:16:47.028
What they want you to believe is that it all started with COVID.

02:16:47.068 --> 02:16:48.169
It all started with the rush.

02:16:48.209 --> 02:16:49.349
It all started with the panic.

02:16:49.389 --> 02:16:50.390
It all started with Trump.

02:16:50.430 --> 02:16:52.931
It all started with misinformation.

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:54.892
It all started with a cover-up.

02:16:54.912 --> 02:16:54.952
No!

02:16:56.533 --> 02:16:58.694
They have been lying about pandemic potential.

02:16:58.754 --> 02:16:59.535
They set it up.

02:17:01.445 --> 02:17:02.966
They set Brett Weinstein up.

02:17:03.046 --> 02:17:04.207
They set Eric up.

02:17:04.447 --> 02:17:09.530
They set Joe Rogan up before the pandemic to make sure that they could control this narrative.

02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:11.851
So when that happened, that's not when it started.

02:17:14.173 --> 02:17:20.677
That was when the theater was taken to a new level, a new height, when the pressure was turned up.

02:17:22.498 --> 02:17:30.123
And so that is a misconception that he is enforcing for them, that his, I just want to make sure that I'm being very clear about.

02:17:32.353 --> 02:17:34.695
I mean, he could be unwittingly involved.

02:17:34.715 --> 02:17:45.927
He could just be doing what Eric tells him to do because he's such a good friend and he trusts him because Eric is a polymath super genius and he's got him on his cell phone that when Eric says, I need you to come on Piers Morgan with me and make a couple points,

02:17:46.943 --> 02:17:48.244
Of course he's gonna do it.

02:17:49.065 --> 02:17:51.687
But save them for the health workers because they need them.

02:17:51.727 --> 02:17:54.149
It's like, so everyone's brain starts skitching out.

02:17:54.730 --> 02:17:56.711
Also, no one has talked about social media yet.

02:17:57.152 --> 02:17:59.013
Social media, this is done.

02:17:59.594 --> 02:18:00.735
The horses are out of the stable.

02:18:00.815 --> 02:18:02.396
The toothpaste is all over the floor.

02:18:02.476 --> 02:18:04.018
The genie has flown out of the bottle.

02:18:04.338 --> 02:18:06.920
We are living in a reality where everybody is a publisher.

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:11.002
Everybody is going to say things and people are screaming out for Candace Owens.

02:18:11.042 --> 02:18:16.086
I'm telling you right now, as somebody, I'm almost sure I'm going to disagree with every word out of her mouth.

02:18:16.626 --> 02:18:24.071
And yet I am utterly fascinated by how she has already captured people in terms of their imagination, because this is what they want.

02:18:24.331 --> 02:18:26.853
As a marketer, I can tell you, you guys are terrible.

02:18:26.933 --> 02:18:32.657
Like if I have to mark you, oh, God, even though I look at Eric and I'm like, is this the smartest human I've ever encountered?

02:18:33.157 --> 02:18:33.697
For sure.

02:18:34.077 --> 02:18:37.179
Do I want him at my house just whispering in my ear all the things to do?

02:18:37.459 --> 02:18:37.939
Absolutely.

02:18:37.979 --> 02:18:39.100
My life would be way better.

02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:39.660
How?

02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:44.202
I wonder if he whispers in Peter Thiel's ear about what technologies to invest in.

02:18:44.442 --> 02:18:46.963
However, from a marketing perspective.

02:18:47.403 --> 02:18:50.785
Oh, I should say what intellectual property to invest in.

02:18:50.805 --> 02:18:51.325
Sorry about that.

02:18:52.366 --> 02:18:55.568
So it's like we have a much bigger challenge that we have to overcome.

02:18:55.828 --> 02:18:57.509
And Candace doesn't have that problem.

02:18:57.529 --> 02:18:58.729
She's electrifying.

02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:01.011
She captures what people want to hear.

02:19:01.051 --> 02:19:08.715
And what I'm saying is the service that you guys can now play in the world that we live in is to say science isn't about being right.

02:19:09.416 --> 02:19:10.597
Science is about two things.

02:19:11.365 --> 02:19:13.866
Number one, the pursuit of utility.

02:19:14.566 --> 02:19:25.651
Einstein's breakthroughs matter because they give us- And so the guy from the impact theory is now educating these people about what science really is and what the intellectual pursuit of knowledge really is.

02:19:25.751 --> 02:19:29.533
And it is, it is laughably arrogant.

02:19:31.081 --> 02:19:34.764
as someone who's never probably engaged in it, like really tried.

02:19:34.804 --> 02:19:35.424
Have that problem.

02:19:35.444 --> 02:19:36.645
She's electrifying.

02:19:36.946 --> 02:19:38.927
She captures what people want to hear.

02:19:38.947 --> 02:19:46.633
And what I'm saying is the service that you guys can now play in the world that we live in is to say science isn't about being right.

02:19:47.314 --> 02:19:48.515
Science is about two things.

02:19:49.286 --> 02:19:51.767
Number one, the pursuit of utility.

02:19:52.487 --> 02:19:56.629
Einstein's breakthroughs matter because they give us GPS and nuclear energy.

02:19:56.829 --> 02:19:58.670
That's the only reason that they matter.

02:19:59.310 --> 02:20:03.572
And the second thing is, we know we're wrong about a whole lot of stuff.

02:20:03.892 --> 02:20:07.974
And so our job is just go through, what are all the things we're wrong about that are stopping us?

02:20:08.294 --> 02:20:10.334
And I hope I'm not talking out of class, Eric, oh please God.

02:20:11.135 --> 02:20:14.276
But Eric has said to me many times, we ought to be traveling the cosmos.

02:20:15.096 --> 02:20:18.658
And we aren't because string theory has gotten stuck.

02:20:19.562 --> 02:20:20.002
Exactly.

02:20:20.303 --> 02:20:21.684
So you have to get new ideas.

02:20:21.704 --> 02:20:26.928
You have to break the old paradigms in order to get the utility that you want.

02:20:27.268 --> 02:20:31.592
And if we judge every idea by its utility and not by where it comes from, we'll be in a much better place.

02:20:31.712 --> 02:20:45.843
You know, the best thing about this debate, Tom, is that it's actually by having this kind of conversation on a platform like this that is watched globally in pretty big numbers now, that we can probably get to where you want to get science to.

02:20:46.323 --> 02:20:52.426
And the other thing I've observed is I host a lot of debates between people who disagree, and they normally end up screaming at each other.

02:20:52.686 --> 02:20:59.009
What I loved about you three was the more abusive you became in a very nice, polite manner, the more you all laughed.

02:20:59.590 --> 02:21:01.231
That is the way to debate.

02:21:01.311 --> 02:21:02.931
So thank you all very much indeed.

02:21:04.752 --> 02:21:06.793
Thank you, Pierce.

02:21:07.214 --> 02:21:09.095
I'm not really sure what to say about that.

02:21:09.155 --> 02:21:11.436
That was freaking extraordinary.

02:21:12.416 --> 02:21:13.597
Let me get this out of here.

02:21:15.328 --> 02:21:18.209
and set up my slide deck really quick just to close.

02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:22.251
Thank you very much for being here today, ladies and gentlemen.

02:21:22.271 --> 02:21:23.112
That was a lot of fun.

02:21:23.132 --> 02:21:25.873
I do want to do a full close though here.

02:21:27.114 --> 02:21:37.859
So don't forget, I'm actually suggesting that these people are working together, that they actually were put in place, some of them before the pandemic, some of them at the start.

02:21:38.619 --> 02:21:41.063
And I don't have any qualifications to say this.

02:21:41.183 --> 02:21:43.587
I used to be a long-time academician.

02:21:43.627 --> 02:21:49.675
I was a neurobiologist and I ended my career at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 2021.

02:21:50.176 --> 02:21:54.402
And I now wear a badge that says I am the chief biologist of GigaOM Biological.

02:21:55.908 --> 02:22:11.722
All of that being said, I think my credentials of four and a half years of an unblemished record of integrity and trying to figure this out and making a few mistakes and admitting it, I am doing a service to my children that I don't believe Kevin McKernan would ever do for my kids.

02:22:12.163 --> 02:22:15.986
And I don't believe that any of these people are doing anything for my children either.

02:22:16.026 --> 02:22:17.728
A lot of these people don't even have kids.

02:22:18.688 --> 02:22:24.530
So it's very extraordinary because someone like Brett Weinstein has been meddling with me for more than four years now.

02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:31.572
Brett Weinstein has known for four years that it should be called transfection or transformation and has chosen not to teach anybody that.

02:22:32.072 --> 02:22:38.974
And actually pretended, even after admitting that I told him that, that it just wasn't important enough, I guess, to do even a single show about.

02:22:39.434 --> 02:22:45.436
And that makes him a traitor to our kids because he wants us to teach the gain of function is real to our children.

02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:46.076
He wants that.

02:22:46.963 --> 02:22:51.626
He also wants us to teach our kids that vaccines are pretty good, even if they don't always work.

02:22:52.186 --> 02:23:04.773
Whereas I think it's important that we start to insist, until they prove beyond a shadow of a doubt otherwise, that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:23:05.433 --> 02:23:13.519
I think we should continue to insist that transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and an EUA doesn't make it not so.

02:23:13.999 --> 02:23:21.004
And we should also freely challenge them with the idea that RNA cannot pandemic because I believe with all my heart and soul

02:23:21.564 --> 02:23:23.445
that these people have lied to us about this.

02:23:23.485 --> 02:23:41.157
They've lied to us about pandemic potential by telling us a story and an argument and performing a theater about a crisis, performing a theater about a coverup, performing a theater about a lie, performing a theater that has led to a illusion of consensus that they themselves created through that theater.

02:23:43.328 --> 02:23:49.633
The only awful and most malevolent part about it is that we were all fooled by these people for a very long time.

02:23:49.713 --> 02:23:54.296
Even if we weren't fooled by the people on TV, we were fooled by the people on social media.

02:23:54.316 --> 02:24:03.443
And that's why there is an illusion of consensus about they are killing us, that they release it, and that somebody's got to come and save us, and this whole thing seems to be under their control.

02:24:03.943 --> 02:24:04.564
It's a lie.

02:24:05.742 --> 02:24:16.992
because they don't talk about a background signal, they don't talk about background noise, they don't talk about bacteriophages, and they don't talk about anything.

02:24:17.632 --> 02:24:27.020
They talk exclusively about the mythology of viruses, and they don't talk about 2020 and 2021, and that's how they avoid admitting that the faith is a lie.

02:24:27.741 --> 02:24:29.862
And you saw those four people,

02:24:30.888 --> 02:24:41.231
freely set forth the illusion of consensus that the moon landing happened, that viruses are real, that there is a novel virus that underlies COVID.

02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:50.694
This was all part of that illusion where they agreed that those things are true, but we should argue about peer review, and we should argue about what science has done to undermine itself.

02:24:50.734 --> 02:24:51.554
We should never talk

02:24:57.395 --> 02:25:01.219
We should never talk about the fact that they murdered people and lied about it.

02:25:01.279 --> 02:25:04.062
That's, of course, the one thing that these people don't want to talk about.

02:25:04.082 --> 02:25:10.628
They don't want to talk about Sina Bavari and David Hohn's patent on a virus-like particle that looks an awful lot like the Ebola virus.

02:25:10.648 --> 02:25:15.573
They don't want to talk about Stanley Plotkin and the emissions in their many giant textbooks.

02:25:15.593 --> 02:25:17.976
They don't want to talk about Hilary Koprowski and his role

02:25:18.596 --> 02:25:20.417
in the starting of the polio vaccine.

02:25:20.437 --> 02:25:22.259
They don't want to talk about the Barr family.

02:25:22.659 --> 02:25:26.081
And hopefully we can talk about the Barr family and the promise system very soon.

02:25:26.662 --> 02:25:28.463
And they don't want to talk about Joshua Lederberg.

02:25:28.503 --> 02:25:31.465
Quite frankly, I'm almost done talking about Joshua Lederberg too.

02:25:32.966 --> 02:25:38.530
The only reason why I want to talk about Joshua is because he's one of these people who's kind of the godfather of some of these ideas.

02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:46.696
And so we need to start from him and then draw lines through the mentor chains that led us to the people who are alive right now.

02:25:49.127 --> 02:25:51.608
I don't want to talk about dead people much more anymore.

02:25:51.648 --> 02:25:53.248
That's somebody else's purview.

02:25:53.688 --> 02:25:55.029
That's somebody else's work.

02:25:56.309 --> 02:26:09.373
I want to talk about the living, breathing humans that are perpetuating this mythology, wittingly or unwittingly, because of deep state social media bullshit like the intellectual dark web and what you just saw.

02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:12.101
That's why they don't want to talk about 2020.

02:26:13.282 --> 02:26:15.403
That's why they won't admit that the faith is a lie.

02:26:15.423 --> 02:26:16.884
I don't know why those two came up again.

02:26:17.324 --> 02:26:24.349
So we do have a problem because this illusion of a biosecurity state, worst case scenario, must be broken.

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:26.691
It cannot be passed on to our kids.

02:26:27.171 --> 02:26:33.895
They need to understand that virology, at least RNA virology, is wholly dependent on synthetic RNA and DNA.

02:26:33.935 --> 02:26:37.698
There's no other way to do it because RNA doesn't grow in a dish.

02:26:41.974 --> 02:26:44.795
but they can definitely, they can definitely sequence it.

02:26:44.935 --> 02:26:53.437
So they can get this RNA and they can claim they're finding sequences and whatever they claim they find, they can definitely make a large quantity of it and then test it in a laboratory.

02:26:54.777 --> 02:27:00.558
And so the bottom line is, is that these people could be even lying about what they're finding just so that they can test whatever they want to test.

02:27:00.858 --> 02:27:04.799
Oh, we found some new exosomes with some new genes in them.

02:27:04.839 --> 02:27:11.441
And since they're not yours, they're viruses, we can study them as much as we want to with no ethical concerns at all.

02:27:13.035 --> 02:27:21.559
And so claiming that they're finding these signals in bats just gives them an excuse to study the same signal in humans under the pretense that they're studying something from bats.

02:27:21.639 --> 02:27:22.919
Do you see the problem here?

02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:27.461
Because they make a lot of this DNA, and then they either use it directly or convert it to RNA.

02:27:27.501 --> 02:27:33.284
And whether they use it on a cell culture, whether they use it in an animal, or that they make a large quantity of it, it's all the same.

02:27:33.324 --> 02:27:36.785
They call it infectious DNA and infectious RNA clones.

02:27:37.566 --> 02:27:39.547
And they can make as much as they want of them.

02:27:40.470 --> 02:27:46.053
using the same kinds of bio-manufacturing that they use to make antibodies and venom.

02:27:47.973 --> 02:27:58.418
The only disingenuous part is instead of calling them infectious clones, they should just call them synthetic RNA and DNA in quantity that they transform and transfect these cell models with, these animals with.

02:27:59.318 --> 02:28:00.139
That's all they're doing.

02:28:01.152 --> 02:28:08.078
Once they move to clones, once they move to pure molecules, they're just transforming and transfecting cell cultures in animals.

02:28:08.559 --> 02:28:11.261
And they are not recapitulating anything in nature.

02:28:11.301 --> 02:28:12.943
They're doing bioweapons research.

02:28:14.124 --> 02:28:15.625
And all of these people know it.

02:28:17.407 --> 02:28:24.774
They probably know it better than a lot of the people at the CDC who are probably blissfully dumb, ignorant, ignorant idiots.

02:28:26.274 --> 02:28:31.399
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:28:31.999 --> 02:28:35.682
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

02:28:35.722 --> 02:28:38.345
That's because weaponized piles of money got us to argue about it.

02:28:38.385 --> 02:28:39.466
That's why we accepted it.

02:28:39.946 --> 02:28:41.728
And that's how we're still being governed.

02:28:45.032 --> 02:29:01.105
all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary and if you like what you saw please go to gigaohm.biological.com find a way to support the stream otherwise share it here at stream.gigaohm.bio we have a new channel

02:29:01.906 --> 02:29:24.043
and a new member of gigaohm upstream.gigaohm.bio and that is Housatonic Live is now able to post his videos up there and so his edited versions are probably going to start showing up there as he posts them elsewhere and so this is not to say that you shouldn't share his bit shoot or or follow him on rumble and share that but it's just to say that there's another way

02:29:25.304 --> 02:29:28.987
to find his content all in one place, starting now.

02:29:29.768 --> 02:29:38.574
And it's a way to kind of move forward with this federated, decentralized social media substitute, which is Soapbox and PeerTube.

02:29:39.274 --> 02:29:46.319
And I think it's a really good example that we're going to set over the next couple of weeks as we move away from Twitter and these other things and just take it on our own.

02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:48.501
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:29:48.541 --> 02:29:49.341
Thanks for supporting.

02:29:49.381 --> 02:29:50.122
Thanks for sharing.

02:29:50.842 --> 02:29:54.065
If you liked what you saw, again, please find a way to make it happen more often.

02:29:55.642 --> 02:29:57.455
And I'll see you again tomorrow, Saturday.
