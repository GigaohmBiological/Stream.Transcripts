WEBVTT

00:00.112 --> 00:00.461
One, two.

01:57.328 --> 01:58.709
Now, I know I'm not in uniform right now.

01:58.789 --> 02:00.069
That's because I'm going undercover.

02:00.189 --> 02:05.232
In light of all the recent false flag shootings, you might be wondering, how do I get in on the action, you know?

02:05.272 --> 02:08.253
What do I gotta do to be the lucky guy that gets recruited to do something crazy?

02:10.796 --> 02:12.618
I might get in on that action.

02:13.099 --> 02:22.609
Lucky for you, citizen of the United States, Biden's Build Back Better bill, because he loves you so much, absconded in the 10,000 pages federal false flag subsidization program.

02:22.749 --> 02:26.453
For example, if you're thinking, you know what, maybe I don't have the nerve to do something crazy.

02:26.473 --> 02:28.776
We'll give you all the SSRIs and fluoride you need.

02:28.796 --> 02:31.199
You're thinking, where do I get the money for these fancy guns?

02:31.419 --> 02:32.400
Where do you think these like

02:32.680 --> 02:52.363
mentally ill mcdonalds workers got the money from in this economy if you're wondering where to get money from just go on the internet and say that you're having violent thoughts all of our boys will swarm in there onto your venmo account to send you money our best discord groomers do your discord account to give you all the instruction manuals quick rundowns and everything really we're trying to make this as easy for you as possible especially if you're a minority

02:52.654 --> 02:56.516
If you're retarded in some way, we have all the affirmative action to get you on your feet.

02:56.616 --> 02:59.698
Before you get started, though, we don't want you to injure yourself in any way, at least not yet.

02:59.718 --> 03:01.439
You can do that after it's all said and done.

03:01.459 --> 03:07.422
Here's a little thing you gotta know about gun safety, first of all, is you want to be waving it in as many directions as possible at all times.

03:07.962 --> 03:08.322
Loaded.

03:08.342 --> 03:10.723
Check the chamber to make sure there's a bullet in there.

03:11.003 --> 03:12.083
Just have fun with it, really.

03:12.403 --> 03:12.964
Do it for me.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.504
Do it to save the Whiterace.

03:14.804 --> 03:15.324
Hey, what's up, guys?

03:15.344 --> 03:15.804
It's Soph here.

03:15.824 --> 03:17.065
Just getting ready for the Pride Parade.

03:17.605 --> 03:17.885
Oh, hey.

03:18.245 --> 03:18.905
Didn't see you there.

03:18.925 --> 03:23.747
I'm just here getting ready to go to the Pride Parade, considering I'm going to a GSA meet pretty soon.

03:23.947 --> 03:28.088
So when you're kind of, you know, playing around with a gun as you do, you should always be playing around with it.

03:28.108 --> 03:35.250
You want to keep your finger directly on the trigger so you're always ready in case any sort of homosexual person strolls by.

03:35.270 --> 03:37.531
I need to see you holding the gun like this, okay?

03:38.780 --> 03:39.924
I want you to take yourself out.

03:39.944 --> 03:46.223
The way you gotta do it, you gotta take your gun like so, thusly, and, uh, you know, shoot yourself in the back of the head.

03:47.728 --> 03:52.170
So guys, one of the classic ways to make your whole thing more comical is going akimbo.

03:53.091 --> 03:55.172
Very impractical, very untactical.

03:55.212 --> 03:56.652
You want to make sure you're really close together.

03:56.672 --> 04:05.857
If you start hitting each other when you're trying to shoot, you start colliding with each other, you're shooting your other gun with each other.

04:06.397 --> 04:11.399
If you're worried your gun might be malfunctioning and isn't working properly, just make sure to test it on yourself.

04:18.337 --> 04:22.859
Alright guys, you wanna make sure to do some shenanigans as far as, you know, how many bullets your man is actually carrying.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.940
So just make it so that the numbers don't add up.

04:31.002 --> 04:37.545
So, just in case you're not very imaginative, I'll give you some ideas of what sort of things you're supposed to say when you're shooting, okay?

04:37.565 --> 04:38.445
Alright.

04:38.885 --> 04:42.887
I'm doing this for you, Hitler!

04:46.915 --> 04:53.659
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.122
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

04:57.202 --> 05:06.648
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

05:06.668 --> 05:13.272
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

05:15.623 --> 05:18.204
pass the time to our next honored guest.

05:18.744 --> 05:21.765
And yeah, I will keep fighting until the last minute.

05:22.326 --> 05:25.227
Last minute, for me, all for Chinese Communist Party.

05:25.507 --> 05:25.907
Thank you.

05:33.070 --> 05:42.954
Dr. Li Min Yang is not only a hero to the Chinese people, not only a hero to the American people, she's a hero to all mankind.

05:59.909 --> 06:15.682
The last thing I want to say, when Dr. Li-Man Yang left Hong Kong in the middle of the night because of the great work of the Rule of Law Foundation, the Rule of Law Society, the great heroes there and supporters, she defected and came out with tremendous danger to herself.

06:16.562 --> 06:23.908
When she first got here, I think we spent three, four, five days in due diligence with lawyers and scientists and all of that.

06:23.928 --> 06:25.069
Stop lying!

06:25.089 --> 06:28.232
I have to say about her personal journey, she was

06:29.292 --> 06:31.814
very meek, very shy.

06:32.715 --> 06:38.540
The woman that was on the stage tonight was so shy and so demurred.

06:38.560 --> 06:46.607
I got to tell you, one year of breathing the fresh air of freedom has... Stop lying!

06:50.951 --> 06:55.215
We have to get her citizenship because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.125
Thank you.

07:00.185 --> 07:00.986
Thank you, Ariel.

07:04.308 --> 07:06.630
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.491
Oh, time out, JC on the bike.

07:09.552 --> 07:10.432
JC on the bike.

07:11.273 --> 07:12.414
It's JC on the bike.

07:13.234 --> 07:14.515
It's JC on the bike.

07:14.595 --> 07:15.435
Yeah.

07:16.096 --> 07:20.219
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.280
And I know just the one.

07:23.161 --> 07:24.001
Look around.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.482
It's JC on the bike.

07:26.082 --> 07:28.184
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

07:30.717 --> 07:40.844
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the, of America, of the American people is being used to create the crisis.

07:40.884 --> 07:44.807
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin maybe America.

07:44.947 --> 07:46.889
I don't know, crash the dollar.

07:47.109 --> 07:52.013
I don't know, steal the rest of our, our, what limited treasury value we have left.

07:52.213 --> 07:55.275
I don't know, but I know for sure.

07:55.680 --> 08:13.128
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

08:15.469 --> 08:17.490
Protect yourself at all times.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.551
Follow my instructions.

08:19.571 --> 08:20.071
Keep it clean.

08:20.411 --> 08:21.412
Touch gloves if you wish.

08:21.692 --> 08:22.112
Let's do it.

08:23.684 --> 08:26.986
The Matrix is a system, Neil.

08:45.424 --> 08:46.885
That system is our enemy.

08:47.506 --> 08:49.867
When you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

08:49.947 --> 08:56.713
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save.

08:57.113 --> 09:02.117
But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.

09:02.297 --> 09:06.760
You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

09:07.581 --> 09:13.666
And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

09:16.118 --> 09:17.279
Were you listening to me, Neo?

09:18.180 --> 09:19.681
Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

09:20.422 --> 09:21.303
I was... Look again.

09:23.185 --> 09:23.565
Who is it?

09:28.610 --> 09:31.592
This... This isn't the Matrix.

09:31.793 --> 09:32.013
No.

09:34.235 --> 09:36.597
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing.

09:38.699 --> 09:40.781
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

10:56.988 --> 11:01.591
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?

11:03.232 --> 11:06.654
Oh, Lord.

11:06.774 --> 11:11.717
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.

11:13.378 --> 11:16.920
Oh, Lord.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.863
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?

11:22.423 --> 11:23.704
Oh, Lord.

11:23.964 --> 11:24.645
Oh, Lord.

11:36.943 --> 12:04.674
You told me you were drowning I was not in the hand I've seen your face before, my friend But I don't know if you know who I am Well, I was there when I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes

12:07.168 --> 12:11.010
I know where you've been.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.051
It's all been a pack of lies.

12:14.071 --> 12:23.995
I can feel it coming in the air tonight.

12:24.215 --> 12:25.956
Oh, Lord.

12:26.596 --> 12:33.879
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life.

12:34.299 --> 12:35.440
Oh, Lord.

12:38.464 --> 12:45.575
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord.

12:46.035 --> 12:53.087
And I've been waiting for this all night, for all my life.

13:20.934 --> 13:26.397
last time we ever met.

13:26.457 --> 13:33.621
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up.

13:34.502 --> 13:42.126
The beautiful me, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows.

13:42.146 --> 13:42.907
Some strangers

15:56.329 --> 15:58.270
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

15:59.391 --> 16:04.133
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

16:05.534 --> 16:07.235
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

16:08.882 --> 16:09.589
It's embarrassing.

16:41.732 --> 16:41.792
you

17:11.579 --> 17:25.231
Hey, good morning everybody.

17:25.531 --> 17:30.075
It is 10.30 in the morning on the 1st of August 2024.

17:30.295 --> 17:38.001
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

17:39.861 --> 17:40.762
Let's see here.

17:40.862 --> 17:43.685
Yeah, I used to be an academic biologist.

17:44.926 --> 17:56.498
And while I was an academic biologist, I used to record from brain slices of different animals to try and understand little microcircuits, to try and understand neuropharmacology and biophysics of ion channels.

17:57.579 --> 18:00.561
And so I used a lot of microscopes and I used a lot of animals.

18:00.981 --> 18:05.643
And the recordings that I made actually formed gigaohm seals.

18:05.683 --> 18:09.245
It was part of the reason why we got such high resistance, low noise recordings.

18:09.926 --> 18:17.109
And since we started making this stream, we started to use gigaohm biological high resistance, low noise for the same reason.

18:17.149 --> 18:25.254
And so many, many years later, the most high resistance, low noise statements that I can make to start every show I make,

18:25.974 --> 18:31.979
and those are intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

18:32.519 --> 18:42.948
Transfection, transformation and healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses or RNA is not a pattern integrity and it doesn't matter

18:43.748 --> 18:56.974
what kind of RNA it is or what special combinations of bases that your particular RNA has, it doesn't jump the shark, so to speak, from being a molecule to being a pattern integrity.

18:57.014 --> 18:58.095
And that's the trick here.

18:59.035 --> 19:00.796
We need a new consensus about this.

19:00.836 --> 19:04.338
We need a new consensus about the fact that everybody should have done known better.

19:04.878 --> 19:19.320
that transfection and transformation in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and that they were, by over 30 years of failure, very much motivated to murder and lie about it in order to get people to believe that transfection

19:20.061 --> 19:34.428
is a useful methodology for augmenting the human system in general, never mind disguising it as a vaccine for now or a cancer cure for now, which it may or may not do, the latter, but the former is absolutely absurd.

19:34.909 --> 19:41.412
And in fact, we know that because the vaccine schedule in America has been a criminal enterprise for years before the pandemic.

19:41.892 --> 19:42.773
And it's something that

19:43.849 --> 19:59.499
in a limited spectrum way, CHD and ICANN were fighting before the pandemic, but I'm starting to feel as though those organizations were somehow impotent in their ability to get the ball across the finish line before the pandemic.

19:59.899 --> 20:09.826
And maybe even when they started to finally have the momentum that was necessary in the form of Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2, that momentum was somehow

20:10.726 --> 20:13.587
I don't know, abruptly ended by the pandemic.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.928
And so there's lots of ways to look at it.

20:15.988 --> 20:22.630
But from my perspective, these people are all part of a sort of limited spectrum of debate that should have come to this.

20:23.330 --> 20:25.791
This should have been on their banners a long time ago.

20:25.851 --> 20:30.093
You know, like, look, I'm just going to take what's off my door here and show you what I mean.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.113
This is spontaneous.

20:31.133 --> 20:31.953
I didn't mean to do this.

20:38.735 --> 20:40.196
Hold on one second, I'm coming back.

20:43.456 --> 20:44.577
It's got fake magnets.

20:51.201 --> 20:54.903
So my friend, I've been plugged back in.

20:57.284 --> 21:12.133
My old buddy at the University of Pittsburgh used to always take apart old hard drives and then you'd get these super magnets out of them and then, you know, the ones that are flat that don't have any legs on them are really nice for sticking to metal doors and stuff like that, but they're also very hard to get off.

21:12.751 --> 21:17.997
So what I'm saying is, and this is my argument about ICANN and about children's health defense.

21:19.058 --> 21:21.161
I'm arguing for one specific thing here.

21:21.181 --> 21:24.685
I'm trying to say, look, we need a new consensus about certain things, right?

21:25.506 --> 21:27.228
Certain things we need a consensus about.

21:27.268 --> 21:29.451
That's what I'm trying to say with these words up here.

21:29.971 --> 21:31.193
What is their consensus?

21:32.557 --> 21:39.711
Their consensus is rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

21:40.272 --> 21:42.776
So how's that gonna get America out of this mess?

21:44.394 --> 21:49.356
How does that inform parents about the vaccine schedule?

21:49.396 --> 21:59.700
How does that inform young college kids about how distorted the public health message is to the point where they can't make informed consent happen anymore?

22:00.421 --> 22:09.264
How is that helping anyone if this is all they put on their very expensive vinyl banners for their annual conference?

22:09.304 --> 22:10.505
That's the best they can do.

22:11.556 --> 22:12.517
It's like a goal.

22:13.118 --> 22:15.120
It's like a goal that will never be reached.

22:15.220 --> 22:19.325
They need money until the end of time because they don't have a goal.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.167
There is no end.

22:22.649 --> 22:24.311
And the end should be right here.

22:25.432 --> 22:28.456
This is the end that these people should be fighting for.

22:28.536 --> 22:31.239
They were fighting for it before the pandemic, I thought.

22:32.930 --> 22:36.593
But they're not fighting for it now, and we need to fight for it.

22:37.014 --> 22:38.655
I want to fight for this.

22:39.436 --> 22:42.298
Gigaohm Biological is fighting for this.

22:42.418 --> 22:44.060
Make no mistake about it.

22:44.901 --> 22:48.043
If you want to argue that RNA can pandemic, that's fine.

22:48.103 --> 22:49.385
I'm still arguing about this.

22:49.445 --> 22:52.908
The vaccine schedule in the United States is a criminal enterprise.

22:54.870 --> 23:14.370
And while you're running around talking about shooters or whether the audio is right or whether Las Vegas had 50 shooters and helicopters, you are ignoring the vaccine schedule in America and children are continued to be harmed and damaged and permanently altered by this.

23:16.181 --> 23:18.503
This is it, okay?

23:18.843 --> 23:39.441
If you're not gonna talk about adults getting sucked into street opiates, you're not gonna talk about the devastating effect that the last four years has had on our school systems, then at least please, let's talk about the vaccine schedule in America that should have been talked about long before the pandemic.

23:40.356 --> 23:43.179
And let's get more specific than rise and resist.

23:43.259 --> 23:46.802
People over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

23:46.822 --> 23:50.325
Do you even know what I stand for if I say these words together?

23:52.307 --> 23:56.971
If I started GigaOM Biological with this every day, would that help clear it?

23:57.011 --> 23:58.293
Would I get more viewers?

23:58.333 --> 23:59.534
Would I get more supporters?

24:00.074 --> 24:00.875
What is this?

24:04.118 --> 24:04.999
Now keep in mind,

24:06.360 --> 24:10.841
that I took that banner home with me because at the time I was proud to be a part of CHD.

24:10.901 --> 24:12.421
I wanted it on my wall.

24:13.521 --> 24:18.482
I wanted to be a part of this movement because I thought that's what this movement was.

24:18.562 --> 24:19.862
I thought it was about the truth.

24:19.962 --> 24:24.823
I thought it was about saving future generations from these mythologies, but it's not.

24:25.523 --> 24:27.524
It's about rising and resisting.

24:27.564 --> 24:29.184
It's about courage over fear.

24:29.244 --> 24:34.185
It's about, I guess, something over profits, but it's not about these things.

24:34.365 --> 24:35.925
It's not about these things.

24:38.248 --> 24:47.512
And the way we got here is specifically because of this seeming incompetence or lack of focused goals or lack of the right question.

24:49.433 --> 24:51.514
They created this illusion of consensus.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.135
They gamed it out at a table.

24:53.995 --> 24:58.917
They knew how many questions can we make them ask before they'll finally get to the truth?

24:59.398 --> 25:01.579
How many different obstacles could we put in?

25:01.619 --> 25:02.959
How many different detours?

25:03.440 --> 25:06.041
How many different circumlocuting

25:07.113 --> 25:25.627
paths to the truth can we create with an orchestrated barbershop quartet of liars that no matter which four you choose they all are harmonizing together and you can mix them all together because they all know the the song

25:26.971 --> 25:42.498
And so if you choose Jessica Rose to be your soprano, but then you put, you know, Bret Weinstein in the background as the baritone and you have Robert Malone as the bass, then it doesn't really matter who you choose as your tenor because they all know the same song.

25:42.538 --> 25:43.398
They're all going to sing it.

25:43.438 --> 25:48.040
So if it's Steve Kirsch, the tenor, or Ahmed Malik, it doesn't matter.

25:54.042 --> 26:07.965
And so if we go back to March, 2017, and we see that Robert Malone is just as savvy as he is now with the, with the biosecurity state and the, I've been so many epidemic guy and I'm so, you know, talented and, and insightful.

26:08.065 --> 26:20.508
And I'm, I'm the dude that stands in front of the contagion infectious disease today banner and gives an interview about how we need to fear free range RNA, RNA molecules, including Arbo viruses.

26:21.684 --> 26:41.313
we go forward to 2018, we find an interesting little thing where Li Min Yan is presenting with some of the biggest names in the NIAID national security state infrastructure about universal flu vaccines.

26:42.509 --> 26:52.233
And then just one and a half years later, she decides to be the whistleblower against all these people that her and her husband and her mother-in-laws all work for.

26:52.833 --> 27:03.578
You know, Li Min Yan, Dream in the Eyes, promoted by Steve Bannon and Giuliani and some weird Chinese billionaire, supposedly.

27:04.818 --> 27:08.782
and on Fox News, and nobody over there in the blue ever questioned her.

27:08.862 --> 27:22.433
Nobody said, wow, it's interesting that Leigh Minyan was essentially an NIAID wannabe Robert Malone, wannabe Tony Fauci, wannabe Christian Anderson, wannabe Mike Waraby.

27:23.174 --> 27:26.677
She was going for a universal flu vaccine just like Mike Waraby.

27:27.117 --> 27:27.658
She was them.

27:29.266 --> 27:41.833
And so all of these people just kind of ignored this whistleblower, all of these intrepid reporters like Goodman and Cullen and Webb, and they all didn't find it.

27:42.374 --> 27:43.114
I didn't find it.

27:43.254 --> 27:51.799
I'm not saying I found it, but what I'm suggesting to you is, is now that Mark's found it, it should have already spread like wildfire through all of these people's feeds.

27:52.520 --> 27:57.983
It should have spread like wildfire through all of these people's retooling of holy crap.

27:59.241 --> 28:09.170
Even somebody like Bobby Kennedy, who has written a book like this with my help, needs to kind of revamp his understanding of what's going on here.

28:09.530 --> 28:15.035
Wouldn't it have been a great thing to have in this book that Lee Min Yan was actually on Tony Fauci's team the whole time?

28:16.217 --> 28:20.520
What an interesting little thing to have in this book to update this book with.

28:21.266 --> 28:25.090
And yet every one of these people is still facing forward in the ride.

28:25.531 --> 28:29.175
Goodness sakes, we wouldn't want to think back to how the ride started now, would we?

28:29.515 --> 28:33.339
Because if we did that, this illusion of consensus might suddenly break.

28:36.122 --> 28:42.049
You know, this illusion of consensus that gets created when you go on the internet and try to solve the mystery of the novel virus.

28:46.021 --> 28:49.262
That's what's happening when you go on Twitter or when you go on Facebook.

28:49.342 --> 29:11.986
It doesn't matter if you happen to really like Bobby Kennedy and therefore you kind of trust Sasha and you kind of trust Merrill and you stumbled upon Andrew Kaufman because CHD promoted him early in the pandemic and you really like Brett Weinstein and you were particularly persuaded by the book of Alina Chan, then your little video game is a little different than mine.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.228
Because I'm not persuaded by Bobby anymore.

29:15.268 --> 29:18.131
And I know that Brett Weinstein is a traitor to our children.

29:18.151 --> 29:22.916
And I know that Alina Chan is a liar because I tried to interact with her in May of 2020.

29:23.957 --> 29:28.702
But I was bamboozled more by other people, including Kevin McKernan, for example.

29:31.345 --> 29:34.928
But it doesn't matter as long as you engage, as long as you get in the chair.

29:35.879 --> 29:38.220
And you put on the goggles and you say, here I go.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.180
I'm going into Twitter.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.700
I'm going to figure this out right now.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.901
I'm going to fight these bad guys.

29:42.961 --> 29:47.462
And I'm going to send the tweets that are going to push back the empire.

29:49.822 --> 29:56.784
And as long as you're engaging with these people, as long as you're engaging in their little arguments, asking their little questions, you're done.

29:57.898 --> 29:59.239
You are not getting anywhere.

29:59.299 --> 30:06.643
That's exactly how these weaponized piles of money have used social media to convince us to argue about and with whom to argue.

30:06.703 --> 30:10.245
That's exactly why participating in the argument accepts their narrative.

30:10.285 --> 30:13.988
As soon as you get in the chair, you've accepted that you're going to play Star Wars.

30:17.390 --> 30:20.792
And we are governed by this theater so long as we keep logging in.

30:20.812 --> 30:25.475
It's so long as we keep going to YouTube and looking for clips from the CEO

30:26.536 --> 30:36.062
or clips from Rogan, or clips from Walsh, or clips from Cedar, or clips from Tim Pool, it doesn't matter.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.142
They're all the same.

30:38.543 --> 30:42.746
It's all this social media weaponized against you.

30:42.786 --> 30:44.267
And you think those are just people.

30:44.347 --> 30:47.428
No, they are part of the weaponization of social media.

30:48.569 --> 30:50.810
Actors on that stage, actors on that stage.

30:50.830 --> 30:54.773
And we've been calling it for a while now, a Lollapalooza of liars.

30:56.547 --> 31:00.431
And it doesn't matter what stage you go to because they all go backstage.

31:01.352 --> 31:13.524
And then when they show up on different stages mixed together, like in Geneva and start rapping or on a cruise ship off the coast of Turkey, it doesn't matter because they're all backstage together.

31:13.544 --> 31:19.430
And when they come out on the stage to do a show, it doesn't matter which audience they go out to because they're all together.

31:21.408 --> 31:26.513
It's all one big happy show, and that's what is very disturbing about this.

31:26.653 --> 31:28.094
It is very, very deep.

31:28.295 --> 31:36.683
It is almost no one that you can trust, because they all seem to be sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

31:36.743 --> 31:43.830
I mean, if you want to be critical, even somebody like Michael Yeadon sticks to a very strictly limited debate.

31:45.256 --> 31:55.322
And he was all about no virus just a couple years ago and then briefly came back and now he's all about toxins with our friend Sasha, the mom of Soph.

31:57.944 --> 31:59.865
And so it's hard, you know, it's really hard.

31:59.925 --> 32:02.867
It's possible that Mike is just being played by all these people.

32:03.447 --> 32:09.331
But if Mike is paying attention to this show, he knows how many of these, and he knows that Sasha is definitely compromised.

32:11.269 --> 32:14.612
And somehow or another, apparently it's okay for him to do that.

32:14.952 --> 32:16.053
Is that his substack?

32:16.113 --> 32:20.157
Is that his telegram or is it hers?

32:20.517 --> 32:26.302
We have to think about all of these things, but we are in dire straits because that's what this is.

32:26.442 --> 32:29.105
This is them doing this.

32:30.266 --> 32:31.367
I don't know, that wasn't gonna go.

32:31.447 --> 32:32.488
It should go though, let me see.

32:35.871 --> 32:51.578
that that was what this is right that's this whole thing here with her that's it's all a simulation if you're watching alex jones as a way of i don't know why that's not playing i want to see if i can get that to play

32:57.389 --> 33:08.297
If you're just watching Alex Jones with the idea of trying to figure out how to make this happen or how to make this work or how to get out of the trap, you are in the trap and you're not getting out, you see?

33:09.346 --> 33:10.806
That's what I'm trying to suggest to you.

33:11.247 --> 33:34.153
And if you look back before the pandemic, you'll see that this started already before the pandemic with Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein and all of these podcasts that were put in place in 2017, 18 and 19, were all in preparation for taking over the narrative and controlling it, all the different tracks

33:34.733 --> 33:37.374
of the Scooby-Doo, these people were put in place on purpose.

33:37.414 --> 33:45.799
That's why it is the eighth podcast of Brett Weinstein where Sam Harris says that we can't tolerate anti-vaxxers and the next pandemic.

33:46.159 --> 33:52.162
That's why it is only a few months before the pandemic that Soap is promoted by Alex Jones.

33:52.222 --> 34:00.326
And it's only like a half a year after the pandemic started that we're supposed to believe that the truth is coming out on Twitter.

34:00.666 --> 34:01.767
And part of it is because

34:02.407 --> 34:04.888
Elon Musk has bought it and made it free.

34:06.049 --> 34:06.850
Stop lying!

34:07.450 --> 34:09.371
And that's where the illusion is.

34:20.293 --> 34:31.579
So I have to start like that all the time because if somebody hasn't been here for a while or isn't coming regularly or is here for the first time, I want them to really see the illusion from that 30,000 foot perspective.

34:31.619 --> 34:34.120
But now I have a specific idea in mind today.

34:34.180 --> 34:35.781
I really want to go back to 2020 and take a look at

34:38.202 --> 34:41.185
another video from the PBS NewsHour.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.306
And why do I want to do that?

34:42.366 --> 34:51.473
Because very specifically, I think it's important for us to go back to 2020 and dissect the questions that we were asked to answer.

34:52.494 --> 35:02.242
Because I think the Scooby-Doo thing, when I say that there's a Scooby-Doo, when I say that there was a Scooby-Doo, it does kind of feel as though

35:04.560 --> 35:08.743
The main focus should be on the question of whether it was a natural virus or a lab leak.

35:08.783 --> 35:14.106
But that question actually came very, very much later in 2020.

35:14.326 --> 35:21.230
And it needed, it needed to come much later, even though in 2020, I was riding my bicycle

35:23.365 --> 35:30.512
and had already done three videos where I suggested that a lab leak is not crazy in February of 2020.

35:31.613 --> 35:36.837
But that's not where the real controlled narrative was.

35:37.058 --> 35:45.686
And it couldn't be because if it was there, then we would have already been months and months and months ahead of this slow progression to where we are now,

35:46.246 --> 35:47.587
which is that we rushed it.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.829
Transfection worked, but it was imperfect.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.251
It saved a lot of old people.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.692
It gave some old people a lot.

35:53.052 --> 35:54.274
It also hurt some of them.

35:54.634 --> 35:58.317
And so we've got a lot of things to consider, a lot of questions to ask.

35:58.377 --> 36:00.800
It's gonna take a lot of retrospective investigation.

36:00.840 --> 36:04.083
In the meantime, the roller coaster is still going forward.

36:04.143 --> 36:05.244
That's where we are now.

36:05.664 --> 36:10.909
And the only way that we can bring college age kids to understand what was done to them,

36:11.750 --> 36:19.111
how it was done in 2020, is to make a list of the questions that they bamboozled us into asking.

36:19.151 --> 36:24.832
And I think the way to do that is to go back to the beginning and listen to what PBS NewsHour says happened.

36:25.532 --> 36:33.694
Now, what I find especially curious about the PBS NewsHour is that they are making this show called Frontline.

36:34.514 --> 36:39.315
And Frontline is a kind of documentary series with a really nice voice.

36:41.318 --> 36:52.800
And I just really like the idea that these people, they kind of make summary documentaries to kind of clean up the narrative.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.401
You know, a summary of what happened over the last few months.

36:55.901 --> 37:01.842
And of course, Frontline usually does a whole variety of topics and things like that.

37:01.902 --> 37:05.563
But for the coronavirus pandemic, they were pretty much doing something every month.

37:06.423 --> 37:07.764
And so this is the second one.

37:07.804 --> 37:09.344
The first one that we watched,

37:10.949 --> 37:15.734
was actually one where the guy from PBS NewsHour went to Seattle.

37:16.375 --> 37:20.899
And so basically, then they were just talking about the pandemic and the virus.

37:22.320 --> 37:31.870
And they weren't necessarily talking very much about the biology of the virus, more trying to go back in the past and establish

37:33.672 --> 37:38.236
that the biology of a pandemic is real and that people warned us about it.

37:38.296 --> 37:41.018
That's what the first one was about.

37:41.098 --> 37:46.022
And so, you know, you're talking to people who did the, who experienced the first one.

37:46.042 --> 37:52.847
You're trying to get people to understand whatever happened on the first one is being kind of recapitulated in this next one.

37:53.388 --> 37:59.873
This next video, which comes a few months later, is titled the virus and what went wrong.

37:59.893 --> 38:01.094
And this is in August.

38:01.214 --> 38:01.514
And so,

38:02.855 --> 38:17.444
It's a really curious video because again in between here there are two more Frontline documentaries that are specifically about a family and then it's specifically about Bergamo and Italy and then also something else which we can go over later.

38:17.964 --> 38:26.430
But I just want to again use these longer documentaries that Frontline made about every two months to try and orchestrate a list of questions.

38:27.270 --> 38:29.011
What were they trying to get us to think about?

38:29.852 --> 38:40.858
And if we see that there were 10 questions before LabLeak, or there were 40 questions before LabLeak, or that's what I want to get at.

38:40.898 --> 38:43.779
How many of them were there and who was participating in them?

38:43.839 --> 38:48.082
Can we remember who was encouraging us to ask these questions?

38:48.122 --> 38:51.704
Because Brett Weinstein, for example, is one of these people who would have been asking,

38:52.644 --> 39:07.432
All of the PBS NewsHour questions in 2020 and most of 2021, all of those questions were relevant to him from bushmeat to masks, to goggles, to aerosol or not, this kind of thing.

39:08.112 --> 39:13.675
So it's a really good idea, I think, for us to go back in time and to take a look at what questions were asked.

39:15.056 --> 39:16.096
And so that's what we're gonna do.

39:16.116 --> 39:17.117
America is reopening.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.698
Protests over the death of George Floyd

39:19.398 --> 39:20.779
People are taking to the streets.

39:21.559 --> 39:27.763
Amid fears of a second wave, correspondent Martin Smith looks at how we got here.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.144
Okay, so fears of a second wave.

39:30.224 --> 39:32.445
Let's get, let me see if I can do this.

39:36.628 --> 39:39.809
And I want to go like that, and then I can go like this.

39:39.889 --> 39:40.089
Yes.

39:40.610 --> 39:46.273
So the first thing is to remember that first it was, you know, they had to tell us it was a zoonosis.

39:48.034 --> 39:52.097
That was what the first documentary is about.

39:52.117 --> 39:54.799
It was about zoonosis, about pandemic potential.

39:58.202 --> 40:02.865
And remember, this nib is a little bent.

40:02.885 --> 40:04.706
You're going to hear some scraping sometime.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.007
I can't fix it.

40:06.187 --> 40:08.489
Or I'm trying to fix it, but it's still a little bit sharp.

40:09.890 --> 40:10.851
Pandemic potential.

40:10.891 --> 40:11.831
And so this was right.

40:11.852 --> 40:12.872
This was Dayzak.

40:14.714 --> 40:15.934
And this is Wolf.

40:17.304 --> 40:17.984
And it's Fauci.

40:18.864 --> 40:20.045
Everybody told this story.

40:20.705 --> 40:23.625
So they even got Barak in here, right?

40:24.285 --> 40:25.666
They have all those people in there.

40:25.686 --> 40:27.486
And so that was the first documentary.

40:27.506 --> 40:29.826
This was the first PBS documentary.

40:29.846 --> 40:33.467
And so now here, we're talking about a second wave.

40:35.907 --> 40:38.508
So will there be a second wave is already a question.

40:40.988 --> 40:44.089
And let me go back just a little bit to see what they said there.

40:46.334 --> 40:49.597
America is reopening.

40:49.917 --> 40:52.340
People are taking to the streets.

40:53.601 --> 40:59.846
Amid fears of a second wave, correspondent Martin Smith looks at how we got here.

40:59.986 --> 41:04.931
Did you say to him, look, Mr. President, with all due respect, it's not true what you're saying.

41:04.991 --> 41:08.812
Yeah, I'm not going to comment on the conversations I've had with the president.

41:08.892 --> 41:10.052
I mean, listen to the music.

41:10.692 --> 41:12.853
The missteps.

41:13.013 --> 41:16.994
Throughout much of January and February saying that this is a hoax.

41:17.394 --> 41:19.114
Every lab is fighting for itself.

41:19.214 --> 41:21.015
Every state is fighting for itself.

41:21.195 --> 41:23.255
Now on front line, the virus.

41:23.656 --> 41:29.217
There will be thousands who will die needlessly because of our lack of preparedness.

41:45.083 --> 41:46.023
December 31st.

41:54.085 --> 42:00.707
One million people crowded into New York's Times Square to celebrate what they hoped would be a bright new year.

42:05.488 --> 42:11.009
What no one knew at the time was that a highly infectious virus was rapidly moving toward them.

42:16.454 --> 42:24.418
I think at this stage is the second or third of January that Robert Malone gets a phone call from Michael Callahan telling him that there's something coming.

42:25.039 --> 42:28.300
So some people knew a couple days after the New Year's celebration.

42:45.526 --> 42:51.991
Scientists say a new virus related to SARS may be responsible for a mysterious pneumonia outbreak in China.

42:52.271 --> 42:55.514
I had begun reporting on the coronavirus several months ago.

42:56.735 --> 42:57.836
We watched that video.

42:57.856 --> 43:00.017
This guy and another dude.

43:00.197 --> 43:06.102
I had just returned from the Middle East where I was covering events in Iraq and Iran.

43:06.342 --> 43:11.847
Out of caution, I decided to quarantine in the Catskill Mountains two hours north of New York City.

43:13.168 --> 43:14.849
I would do my reporting from here.

43:17.785 --> 43:22.687
So he was in the Middle East in Iran, which is, I think, a place that got hit hard, according to the narrative.

43:23.567 --> 43:25.708
I wanted to understand where we were headed.

43:27.168 --> 43:28.028
Were we prepared?

43:29.169 --> 43:30.509
Were warnings being heeded?

43:37.332 --> 43:39.952
Among my first calls was to Dr. David Ho.

43:40.533 --> 43:41.233
Dr. Ho.

43:41.573 --> 43:47.355
A renowned American medical researcher who I met years back when I was reporting on the AIDS epidemic.

43:48.438 --> 43:50.999
Uh-huh, AIDS epidemic reporter.

43:51.319 --> 43:53.399
I'm just putting up a good front.

43:54.940 --> 43:58.660
Dr. Ho had worked to stem the spread of SARS in 2003.

43:59.421 --> 44:02.101
Now he was worried about the spread of COVID-19.

44:03.201 --> 44:06.562
Do you think people are grasping how serious the situation is?

44:07.502 --> 44:15.184
I think people hear the news, they watch the coverage, but it's hard to fully comprehend.

44:16.008 --> 44:20.910
certainly we did not realize that our government would be so ill-prepared.

44:21.510 --> 44:25.031
We knew long ago what China was experiencing.

44:25.771 --> 44:31.393
I think it was the false assumption that that's somebody else's problem.

44:31.413 --> 44:32.653
It would not happen to us.

44:33.454 --> 44:40.176
But that's the same kind of attitude that people had about many other epidemics in the past.

44:41.196 --> 44:43.517
We knew if this thing blew up,

44:44.361 --> 44:45.942
it would just continue to spread.

44:51.184 --> 44:54.625
Wuhan, a major commercial hub in central China.

44:57.706 --> 45:01.267
The first case was identified here on November 17th.

45:03.728 --> 45:09.130
No one knew what it was, but just a few weeks later, it was clear something was wrong.

45:11.031 --> 45:13.892
Amy Chen reported from China for The New York Times.

45:14.699 --> 45:22.662
In December, there were starting to be these patients that were trickling into these hospitals in Wuhan with this pneumonia that doctors were really puzzled by.

45:24.543 --> 45:26.304
It was unclear how to treat them.

45:26.324 --> 45:28.184
They were giving them medicine, and they weren't getting better.

45:28.224 --> 45:30.365
And they were still running these very high temperatures.

45:31.106 --> 45:35.847
And the rumor was that this is a virus that people need to be aware of.

45:39.468 --> 45:45.734
Throughout December, more and more people continued to come into Wuhan hospitals with high fevers and coughs.

45:47.235 --> 46:06.492
Then on December... What I will argue right now is that if this many people, it was really infected in Wuhan by a naturally occurring RNA virus, then the RNA viral signal would not have been as high fidelity as they reported to us, where everybody who sequenced had the same sequence.

46:07.537 --> 46:13.080
that is never in the history of RNA virology ever been documented.

46:14.181 --> 46:30.570
The best case scenario is a paper by Mark Ronst in, I believe, 2007 or 2008, where a new coronavirus is identified in hospitals in the Netherlands, and they are able to track it successfully for 27 children.

46:32.852 --> 46:33.492
And then it's gone.

46:35.905 --> 46:54.177
And so if the claim is that a single RNA sequence and its progeny are responsible for all of these pneumonia cases, then the only way that could be possible is through the creation and deployment of a synthetic sequence.

46:54.977 --> 46:59.220
Whether that sequence is responsible for these people getting sick is another question.

47:00.350 --> 47:12.081
But the only way that a high fidelity RNA signal of 30,000 bases could be found in disparate places around the world, in disparate people, in the exact same time frame,

47:12.830 --> 47:25.254
The only way that could happen if the same sequence was found in Iran and found in Wuhan and found anywhere else, the only way that could happen is if it was first produced synthetically and then distributed to those places.

47:25.314 --> 47:25.654
How?

47:25.754 --> 47:26.174
I don't know.

47:26.654 --> 47:27.975
It's obviously a crime.

47:28.915 --> 47:30.855
So I don't know how the crime was done.

47:31.836 --> 47:36.537
But molecular biology tells us that an RNA cannot do it by itself.

47:37.997 --> 47:39.298
You can't blame the RNA.

47:41.889 --> 47:55.436
You have to add something else because if you spill paint in your backyard, you're not gonna find that paint in six different countries around the world just because people got on planes because that's not how paint works.

47:56.997 --> 48:04.301
There's not gonna be suddenly a house and a car and three people covered in this paint because you spilled it in your backyard.

48:04.841 --> 48:07.583
And very similarly, it doesn't matter

48:08.510 --> 48:13.493
You can't spill RNA and then have it go around the world and paint everybody's house.

48:16.794 --> 48:22.717
Your lungs have the surface area of a tennis court or so.

48:26.839 --> 48:29.160
So it is, it is kind of like painting houses.

48:29.821 --> 48:34.103
The RNA went from being nowhere to being in a lot of tennis courts.

48:37.082 --> 48:49.087
And so you gotta explain how it is that an RNA molecule could be in all of these tennis courts and all of the tennis courts in Bergamo and all of the tennis courts in Iran.

48:50.148 --> 48:50.928
It doesn't work.

48:51.808 --> 49:01.773
30th, a 34 year old ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Li Wenliang logged onto a group chat with some fellow medical school classmates.

49:03.734 --> 49:04.354
He was worried.

49:07.898 --> 49:11.899
Have you seen the record of what was said, what he was saying?

49:12.239 --> 49:12.619
Yes.

49:13.020 --> 49:25.883
It really wasn't that outrageous statement he made or anything, just simply said that I heard in our hospital there are cases of SARS-like symptoms.

49:26.104 --> 49:30.585
Liu Baifeng Xiao and her husband Orville are longtime China experts.

49:30.965 --> 49:33.406
And that was enough to bring the authorities down on him?

49:33.786 --> 49:33.986
Yes.

49:34.517 --> 49:39.898
Public Security Bureau came and made him sign a confession and made him agree to be quiet.

49:41.538 --> 49:46.119
And that's a very threatening thing because the Public Security Bureau is no joke.

49:46.439 --> 49:49.540
It's a secret police force and people are fearful of it.

49:51.780 --> 49:56.841
In China, there's an entire system of online surveillance in which they can monitor what's happening.

49:56.881 --> 50:02.562
And I think in this case, they would have been able to use certain keywords to track what people were saying.

50:04.446 --> 50:12.273
And actually local authorities, the police have broad powers to look into the personal messages of its citizens.

50:14.556 --> 50:21.042
Local Wuhan authorities issued a formal directive ordering other doctors not to discuss the mysterious pneumonia.

50:21.362 --> 50:25.146
And so they're trying to set up a narrative where the Chinese government has

50:29.910 --> 50:33.212
totalitarian control over the social media.

50:33.292 --> 50:35.654
And so they prevented the word from getting out.

50:36.134 --> 50:43.599
Maybe even China prevented America from acting in the way that we should have, had they warned us sufficiently.

50:43.639 --> 50:44.979
And so these are the questions.

50:46.841 --> 50:48.121
Was China honest with us?

50:49.062 --> 50:51.323
Did China know earlier than they told the world?

50:53.125 --> 50:55.306
Were there whistleblowers that got covered up in China?

50:57.711 --> 50:59.155
And who's asking these questions?

50:59.235 --> 51:01.862
Well, of course, it's people that worked on the previous SARS.

51:02.785 --> 51:05.833
It's reporters that worked on the HIV outbreak.

51:10.023 --> 51:13.886
Are they arguing that if we had control over social media, we might be better off?

51:13.966 --> 51:15.347
Are they hinting at that right now?

51:15.387 --> 51:21.072
Despite the silencing of dissent, Chinese scientists were working to map the genome of the virus.

51:38.891 --> 51:48.258
COVID-19 was very quickly sequenced and very quickly people discerned that was about 80% related to the SARS coronavirus.

51:49.058 --> 51:55.143
But given the speed of the subsequent spread, it should have been apparent to all.

51:55.914 --> 51:59.055
that there must have been human-to-human transmission.

51:59.335 --> 52:09.039
It surprises me to see that as of January 12th, the World Health Organization issued a statement saying there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.

52:09.619 --> 52:13.041
They certainly said that, but, you know, they weren't on the ground.

52:13.341 --> 52:18.683
They were probably recounting what was reported back to them by the China CDC.

52:19.123 --> 52:19.903
Shouldn't they have known?

52:20.324 --> 52:22.384
Well, they should have been asking tough questions.

52:22.604 --> 52:23.705
This was obviously

52:24.281 --> 52:25.521
So what is the debate here?

52:25.541 --> 52:32.764
Is there a human to human transmission seems to suggest that there might be a reservoir in nature or a reservoir at a market.

52:32.864 --> 52:38.465
And so if people go through the reservoir, they could get infected, but they're not sharing it with each other yet.

52:38.505 --> 52:46.408
And there's still a chance that before the window of sharing it human to human happens, that we can lock down and prevent a pandemic.

52:46.428 --> 52:46.908
Do you see it?

52:49.025 --> 52:51.126
Do you see the little juggling we're doing here?

52:51.166 --> 52:58.730
Because this is what Brett Weinstein is going to argue for the next year and a half, that zero COVID is something that we should still go for.

52:59.190 --> 53:08.614
Even if that means forced drugging people with silicoxib and ivermectin for 60 days, zero COVID is reachable if we really wanted to get there.

53:09.395 --> 53:17.899
And we could have gotten there earlier if we would have shut down, if China would have been honest about when human to human transmission started

53:19.232 --> 53:24.674
because they're telling you a narrative about during zoonosis, it's not automatically human to human.

53:24.714 --> 53:38.918
Zoonosis can be where the virus jumps to a human that it was exposed to the animal, but then because it doesn't acquire the necessary fear and cleavage sites or HIV inserts to transmit human to human, it might just stay in that person.

53:40.014 --> 53:55.922
They are creating a gray area here, an imaginary sort of list of questions about the biology and how does the biology of these foreign inability, unable to infect us viruses, how do they gain the ability to infect us?

53:55.982 --> 54:03.406
And what specific steps do we go through as we move from being a bat virus to being a pandemic virus?

54:03.846 --> 54:15.273
That's exactly what these two people are agreeing, and many more, are the most important questions to have asked back then, and the questions that the Chinese government were covering up.

54:15.393 --> 54:26.459
And this is all the hamster wheels of the on-ramp to the Scooby-Doo, which will eventually be, wow, I guess we have to consider whether this was a lab leak or natural.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.001
Epidemic that was being spread by humans.

54:33.294 --> 54:36.735
So it might be bushmeat or it might be humans.

54:37.395 --> 54:40.136
It could be mostly bushmeat and only some humans.

54:40.576 --> 54:54.601
We might be, you see the whole idea here is that there is this transition period that we can understand that people like Peter Daszak and Nathan Wolf really need to be at the forefront of understanding where that transition period is.

54:55.001 --> 55:00.263
Because according to Peter Daszak, there are 1.7 million viruses that are waiting to go through that transition.

55:05.467 --> 55:10.051
But with Lunar New Year around the corner, no one wanted to spoil the festivities.

55:11.012 --> 55:13.413
Oh, and so they didn't want to spoil Lunar New Year.

55:13.453 --> 55:20.279
So they let people come and go home after Lunar New Year because that would have been a disaster if they wouldn't have let that happen.

55:20.659 --> 55:22.160
And so they didn't want to exaggerate.

55:22.200 --> 55:25.122
They didn't want to, you know, go overboard.

55:25.142 --> 55:27.124
They didn't want to ruin the economy over there.

55:27.204 --> 55:28.545
So they just went through it.

55:29.085 --> 55:32.108
And then after the Lunar New Year, they started telling everybody.

55:32.688 --> 55:33.349
Stop lying!

55:34.963 --> 55:35.383
There you go.

55:35.403 --> 55:35.903
Perfect story.

55:36.464 --> 55:39.265
No evidence of human-to-human transmission, said the Chinese.

55:39.485 --> 55:39.965
Wow, those liars.

55:40.105 --> 55:41.586
We were played like a fiddle.

55:41.606 --> 55:46.488
Your parents and my parents and my aunts and uncles and my brother, they were all played like a fiddle.

56:06.681 --> 56:10.522
Now, I was still being played by a fiddle by the people on the other side of this, right?

56:10.562 --> 56:14.963
Chasing around all of these people trying to figure out what natural immunity was all about.

56:15.003 --> 56:24.285
Because at this time, of course, the people that were at the cutting edge of the dissident movement were annoyed because people were talking about there might not be any immunity to this virus.

56:24.325 --> 56:29.946
In August, somebody like Li Min Yan was actually on Fox News and other TV programs as Mark

56:30.546 --> 56:48.675
Kulak on Housatonic ITS has shown us, and she was arguing just like Rochelle Walensky and Demi Sridhar and all of these people that argued it in the Lancet, that we don't even know if we can make natural immunity to this novel virus.

56:48.755 --> 56:57.139
Now, what is interesting about that is that that whole idea, we can't make natural immunity to a coronavirus, why would that be?

56:58.112 --> 57:11.103
is part of the on-ramp to the Scooby-Doo, because a real, real deep thinker will say, well, yeah, but if we can make natural immunity to all other coronaviruses, why are they worried that we might not be able to make natural immunity to this one?

57:11.163 --> 57:12.644
Maybe they know something that we don't.

57:14.306 --> 57:17.568
And of course, that's also what Lee Min Yan doesn't even imply.

57:17.628 --> 57:25.115
She just says, this is an unrestricted bioweapon, is what she said most often on Twitter with her 100 different accounts.

57:26.584 --> 57:29.145
Twitter, hundreds of Li Min Yan accounts.

57:32.406 --> 57:34.867
Chinese New Year every year is a really festive time.

57:34.887 --> 57:38.588
This is the time when everyone gets together with their families and in their neighborhoods.

57:39.348 --> 57:48.051
And in one neighborhood in Wuhan called Baiguting, they had organized this large banquet at which 40,000 families ended up attending.

57:53.021 --> 57:55.802
If you have a big celebration, you don't want to have bad news.

57:56.202 --> 57:56.983
That looks nice.

57:57.143 --> 57:58.563
Wow.

57:59.323 --> 58:07.266
If you bring up bad news during that time period, it is said that you'll be cursed with bad happenings for the rest of the year.

58:08.727 --> 58:12.488
Are you telling me that the pandemic happened because of Chinese superstitions?

58:14.029 --> 58:14.429
Come on.

58:14.469 --> 58:21.472
Making matters worse, millions of people left Wuhan in this period to visit friends and family across the country and beyond.

58:22.759 --> 58:24.901
We all have face masks, but we're not wearing them.

58:39.269 --> 58:44.873
It was not until January 20th that the Chinese health ministry declared what was already obvious.

58:45.233 --> 58:45.633
Wow.

58:45.713 --> 58:47.675
And so that's already three weeks.

58:48.095 --> 58:54.559
I mean, we should check the timeline again, but I'm pretty sure it was like the second or third of January that Robert Malone got the phone call.

58:54.599 --> 59:08.308
So he's already been working for several weeks for DITRA on the domain program and already long on his way to identifying ivermectin, famotidine, uh, silicoxib and, and, and, and,

59:10.270 --> 59:11.211
And so what did I say?

59:11.251 --> 59:23.722
I said, ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and remdesivir as potential antivirals in his volunteer team.

59:23.842 --> 59:24.703
So that's kind of cool.

59:25.363 --> 59:27.845
The virus was spreading from human to human.

59:28.086 --> 59:29.827
Zardoz, that's why we're doing this work.

59:29.867 --> 59:32.790
We're writing the timeline right now, and we need to do it right.

59:32.930 --> 59:34.071
So it's going to take a while.

59:34.111 --> 59:35.072
We got a lot of work to do.

59:37.509 --> 59:39.511
Some ominous developments out of China.

59:39.731 --> 59:45.376
Officials there have just confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of coronavirus.

59:45.416 --> 59:46.177
It's a huge story.

59:46.659 --> 59:55.804
So how long have we been watching already and debating about whether human to human transmission is happening and whether or not they should have said it, when they said it, when they had the first... Do you see?

59:56.385 --> 59:58.746
This is part of the hamster wheel.

59:59.086 --> 01:00:02.708
We have had the truth slowly titrated to us.

01:00:02.768 --> 01:00:10.573
And I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that eventually all of the truth will come out, including the fact that the vaccine schedule in America is criminal.

01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:16.662
It will just come out when they're ready so that they can use it as part of the controlled demolition of America.

01:00:17.063 --> 01:00:26.725
If we want to take our country back, we've got to get young people and young parents to jump the shark and get to that conclusion before they want them to.

01:00:27.485 --> 01:00:29.026
We got to get them to get there right now.

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:31.180
That's how we win.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:45.715
Because once the young people understand that public health in America is an illusion that was created by the special cancer virus program and the Human Genome Project and billions of dollars of misappropriated funding of academic research,

01:00:47.059 --> 01:00:52.662
then we can start to move forward as a country that has a shared common vision of where we want to go.

01:00:53.203 --> 01:00:53.823
And it ain't here.

01:00:53.943 --> 01:01:01.408
The WHO did not announce the prospect of human-to-human transmission almost two months after this thing began.

01:01:02.248 --> 01:01:08.832
And it was two weeks after Taiwan had warned them that there was a human-to-human transmission.

01:01:09.613 --> 01:01:13.315
Wuhan, China, ground zero for the outbreak, now under lockdown.

01:01:13.888 --> 01:01:17.291
By January 23rd, Wuhan was placed on lockdown.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:22.035
All trains and planes out of that city halted just tonight.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:24.997
Eerie for a city 11 million people call home.

01:01:25.597 --> 01:01:28.740
It was then that people around the world began to take notice.

01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:38.628
I think it was in February of 2020 that, so it would be right after this, that George Webb was on 60 Minutes talking about the Wuhan military games.

01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:43.452
I perfectly remember the moment in which we start fearing this issue.

01:01:44.426 --> 01:01:52.411
And it was when we have seen all those caterpillars building a new hospital in just less than 10 days.

01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:57.955
Dr. Stefano Fagioli heads the Department of Medicine at a hospital in Bergamo, Italy.

01:01:58.055 --> 01:02:02.458
It's in a place far away from us, so it was all TV show.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:13.606
But then I remember I was having a meeting with some colleagues, and I said, look, but if they are building a whole hospital, there must be something beyond

01:02:14.582 --> 01:02:16.103
our perception.

01:02:16.523 --> 01:02:17.324
Exactly.

01:02:18.805 --> 01:02:20.366
And that was the whole idea, right?

01:02:20.847 --> 01:02:41.301
It wouldn't be until months later that we would see that that hospital wasn't really used, and that it was leaky, and that just like the comfort ship that was brought to New York, just like a lot of these tents that were set up in front of hospitals all around the world, it didn't really happen.

01:02:43.598 --> 01:03:00.727
And so Bergamo, Italy is an interesting case that has been analyzed by some people that I consider meddlers, but they did it in a way that makes the argument that what happened in Bergamo wasn't the landing of a particularly transmissible risk additive pathogen.

01:03:00.767 --> 01:03:08.571
Now, they also looked at previous vaccinations there in Bergamo and the two years before that, how a lot of old people in Bergamo were given

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:19.678
pneumonia vaccines, and so there's a lot of things that were in play in Bergamo besides a coronavirus spreading around.

01:03:19.738 --> 01:03:23.401
And so Bergamo is one of these places that was used

01:03:24.381 --> 01:03:29.183
as a site for the theater, just like New York City was used as the site for a theater.

01:03:30.803 --> 01:03:34.144
I think we're going to come to the conclusion that no virus is not going to cover it.

01:03:34.204 --> 01:03:44.307
And I think we're going to come to the conclusion that a gain-of-function virus is not going to cover this elaborate military operation in which we are still trapped.

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:46.868
I think we need to be prepared.

01:03:47.725 --> 01:03:55.011
Two new coronavirus cases have been confirmed here in Singapore.

01:03:55.111 --> 01:04:00.775
In fact, by early February, cases began showing up in other countries, including the U.S.

01:04:00.916 --> 01:04:03.978
The deadly coronavirus officially hitting the U.S.

01:04:03.998 --> 01:04:06.620
A ninth person has tested positive for coronavirus.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.263
This is now the third case in Ontario, fourth case in Canada.

01:04:10.463 --> 01:04:13.846
And it really shows just how fluid the situation is.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:28.756
Meanwhile, Dr. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who had warned of the deadly virus at the end of December, had been hospitalized, a little over a week after he was ordered to stay quiet.

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:38.889
Wow, is the Asia Society really a Jamie Metzel executive vice president?

01:04:39.229 --> 01:04:40.890
Wow, Pamela.

01:04:41.691 --> 01:04:47.657
Jamie Metzel was the guy that Tucker Carlson said was the guy who started drastic, which was a stop.

01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:49.697
Complete lie.

01:04:49.737 --> 01:05:11.803
The guy who started drastic was Billy Bo Stixson, which is still somebody that we don't know, but it's possible that Billy Bo Stixson is Jamie Metzl, and then that would make Tucker Carlson and Vanity Fair both correct on the fact that Jamie Metzl started drastic, which would then also make Jamie Metzl part of the Twitter illusion.

01:05:13.323 --> 01:05:13.743
A liar.

01:05:14.603 --> 01:05:17.144
He was on a ventilator, struggling to breathe.

01:05:20.031 --> 01:05:22.051
By February 7th, he was dead.

01:05:23.412 --> 01:05:25.532
His death was really a shock.

01:05:25.952 --> 01:05:30.753
And at that time, that was the lowest point in China's battle with the epidemic.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:34.574
And his death really put a human face on the cost of it.

01:05:37.494 --> 01:05:43.035
When news of Dr. Li's death surfaced, Chinese social media exploded in outrage.

01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:48.616
He told people the truth.

01:05:50.117 --> 01:05:51.237
at the end of December.

01:05:52.058 --> 01:06:00.380
It got the attention of Dr. Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old highly respected pulmonologist, a top advisor to the government.

01:06:02.181 --> 01:06:04.341
He now dared to defy the party.

01:06:05.082 --> 01:06:12.204
I think the majority of the people think he's the hero of China.

01:06:13.806 --> 01:06:20.887
That seemed unusual to me, to hear somebody that is an authority like that to criticize the government.

01:06:21.328 --> 01:06:31.610
Well, Dr. Zhong Nanshan, I mean, the reason why he has so much credibility with the public is because he's willing to push back against the government, criticize the government when it's necessary.

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.731
I think he was speaking, just saying what most people in China feel.

01:06:37.231 --> 01:06:38.811
This is Chinese doctor.

01:06:40.191 --> 01:06:42.652
I suppose majority of Chinese doctor

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:44.719
actually like him.

01:06:48.362 --> 01:06:54.725
In Wuhan and some other cities, they held a short mourning memory.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:07:04.091
Everyone would go out onto their balconies and turn the lights off and hold their cell phones up.

01:07:12.035 --> 01:07:13.276
It was really incredible to see.

01:07:15.057 --> 01:07:19.460
I remember all these videos, people screaming out their windows and stuff.

01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:22.823
The thing is, they're telling a story that's wrong there, right?

01:07:22.863 --> 01:07:28.327
Because it wasn't people sticking their cell phones out their window to mourn the loss of that doctor.

01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:36.693
What we were told in the beginning of the pandemic when we saw those videos was that those people were trapped in their buildings because they had been welded in.

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:46.854
And this is PBS news hour several months later, retelling that story has somebody earlier in the chat said they're actually erasing history and rewriting it.

01:07:48.515 --> 01:07:52.116
There weren't people with their cell phones out of their window there.

01:07:52.176 --> 01:08:00.500
Those videos were told to us that those were people screaming for help because they had been locked in their giant buildings with, while being able to leave.

01:08:02.762 --> 01:08:03.643
That's what we were told.

01:08:04.303 --> 01:08:13.671
We were told that Wuhan was locked down so hard that they bulldozed giant piles of dirt in front of the roads to block them.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.234
And PBS NewsHour is not telling us that.

01:08:18.134 --> 01:08:24.099
PBS NewsHour just told us that those people were holding their phones out of their window in solidarity for those.

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:26.701
That is a awful, awful.

01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:27.302
Stop lying.

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:28.523
Wow.

01:08:32.432 --> 01:08:34.133
Wow, that was awful.

01:08:35.073 --> 01:08:35.994
Holy shit.

01:08:36.114 --> 01:08:39.436
A month earlier, the Trumps greeted the New Year in Florida.

01:08:46.299 --> 01:08:49.021
They hosted a big party at their Mar-a-Lago mansion.

01:08:49.741 --> 01:08:55.604
So now they're gonna paint Trump as being not smart enough, not on top of it.

01:08:55.844 --> 01:08:58.065
Don't forget that he was being impeached at the time.

01:08:58.366 --> 01:09:00.787
...members of President Trump's private club.

01:09:05.447 --> 01:09:08.568
Our country has never done better than it's doing right now.

01:09:08.988 --> 01:09:10.909
We have the best unemployment numbers.

01:09:11.249 --> 01:09:13.949
We have the best employment numbers.

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:16.270
Almost 160 million people are working.

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:19.271
Our country is really the top of the world.

01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:20.631
Everybody's talking about it.

01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.412
Thank you.

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:32.795
But that weekend, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Robert Redfield, received a phone call from the American CDC office in China.

01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:41.620
I was actually on a vacation with my children, their spouses, and my 11 grandchildren up in Deep Creek, Maryland.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:56.770
And I did get notified from our CDC China office on New Year's Eve that there was a cluster of cases of unspecified pneumonia in Wuhan, China that seemed to be linked to a seafood market.

01:09:58.471 --> 01:09:59.932
The call was one of several.

01:10:00.032 --> 01:10:02.314
Seemed to be linked to a seafood market.

01:10:03.697 --> 01:10:05.338
What an interesting thing to drop in.

01:10:05.378 --> 01:10:11.103
...that interrupted his vacation.

01:10:13.506 --> 01:10:18.590
On January 3rd, Redfield called his Chinese counterpart, Dr. George Gao.

01:10:19.651 --> 01:10:25.796
It got to the point that Redfield's counterpart even breaks down crying during one of the conversations that he has with him.

01:10:26.217 --> 01:10:29.700
Michael Scheer is a White House correspondent for The New York Times.

01:10:30.896 --> 01:10:36.881
which underscores for Redfield the seriousness of what the Chinese believe at that point that they're dealing with.

01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:38.923
Chai Gao supposedly cried.

01:10:38.963 --> 01:10:39.743
That's pretty funny.

01:10:39.763 --> 01:10:41.465
That guy was at the Event 201.

01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:48.790
Not the real Event 201 that you can see at realevent201.com, but I mean like Event 201, the one that Bill Gates wrote.

01:10:52.113 --> 01:10:58.078
The memory of those previous viral infections, SARS and another one called MERS,

01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:02.333
that they really ravaged that part of the world.

01:11:03.673 --> 01:11:14.259
So I think what you can probably draw from it is a bit of the anxiety on the part of the doctor sitting there in China thinking to himself, Jesus.

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:16.520
They didn't ravage that part of the world.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.461
MERS barely infected anyone.

01:11:18.581 --> 01:11:23.363
SARS infected less than 10,000 people and only killed 700.

01:11:23.443 --> 01:11:26.485
Not that those people aren't important, but ravaged?

01:11:27.725 --> 01:11:28.426
Ravaged?

01:11:29.616 --> 01:11:32.398
There were 10,000 cases on earth.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.601
Some of them were in Canada.

01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:42.227
I don't understand what he's saying here other than rewriting a narrative about what MERS and SARS did.

01:11:42.247 --> 01:11:50.835
Those previous viral infections, SARS and another one called MERS, they really ravaged that part of the world.

01:11:52.248 --> 01:12:04.633
So I think what you can probably draw from it is a bit of the anxiety on the part of the doctor sitting there in China thinking to himself, geez, what if this is as bad as SARS?

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.373
What if it's worse?

01:12:06.153 --> 01:12:07.894
As bad as SARS wouldn't be that bad.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:08.914
I mean, what is this?

01:12:08.974 --> 01:12:09.974
This is absurd.

01:12:10.495 --> 01:12:13.416
Of course, they're making the argument that SARS was more deadly.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:17.597
And so, you know, now we have to decide, is this one really deadly or not deadly?

01:12:17.657 --> 01:12:18.958
Is there asymptomatic spread?

01:12:18.998 --> 01:12:19.518
Here it comes.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.831
Shearer stands by.

01:12:23.891 --> 01:12:34.757
And don't forget that MERS, MERS, there's so many papers about MERS where actually the relations to Li Min Yan are featured.

01:12:34.877 --> 01:12:40.160
Her husband, her supervisors, even her, I mean, it's absurd.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.343
His reporting, but Redfield told me that Gao was not very alarmed.

01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:52.802
He felt pretty confident that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and that really was the extent of it.

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.003
So he wasn't very concerned.

01:12:55.063 --> 01:12:59.804
If there was no human-to-human transmission confirmed, then he wasn't very concerned at that point?

01:13:00.385 --> 01:13:08.528
Back in January 3rd time frame, 3rd through 6th time frame, there was not a sense of urgency from him.

01:13:10.216 --> 01:13:15.722
But Redfield was concerned and called his boss, Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services.

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:21.772
Secretary Azar is the guy who can declare an emergency under the PREP Act.

01:13:22.072 --> 01:13:28.976
And remember that there needs to be no rational basis for his declaration of the emergency.

01:13:29.036 --> 01:13:29.956
It can be on a whim.

01:13:30.436 --> 01:13:31.757
It can because he's scared.

01:13:32.457 --> 01:13:40.441
It can because of a decision made, much like whether or not a groundhog sees its shadow, and he can declare an emergency.

01:13:41.343 --> 01:13:48.112
There's like a thing in law and whatever called a rational basis test, I think, and it doesn't have to pass that.

01:13:49.013 --> 01:13:55.822
You don't have to have a rational basis for declaring an emergency as Health and Human Services Secretary, and there is no

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:03.482
check or balance on resetting that emergency, except for, I guess, the president firing that guy.

01:14:03.762 --> 01:14:06.383
Now, we need to investigate this further.

01:14:06.423 --> 01:14:08.903
It would be good to see what Catherine Watts said about that.

01:14:08.943 --> 01:14:13.525
But that guy has ultimate power with regard to health emergencies.

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:17.586
He also notified the National Security Council at the White House.

01:14:18.444 --> 01:14:22.026
The president had already begun receiving daily briefings from the U.S.

01:14:22.106 --> 01:14:30.392
And we just had Redfield repeat again that the issue was when did human to human transmission start versus when did the Chinese tell us?

01:14:30.452 --> 01:14:32.913
So that is a very important question in this episode.

01:14:33.133 --> 01:14:34.234
Intelligence community.

01:14:35.795 --> 01:14:41.859
Some contained warnings of a serious contagion with dire economic and social consequences.

01:14:42.321 --> 01:14:45.044
They call it the PDB, the President's Daily Briefing.

01:14:45.385 --> 01:14:49.489
It's nice that they show the CIA there because of course that means Michael Callahan.

01:14:49.529 --> 01:14:55.396
Michael Callahan being the guy who called Robert Malone on the 2nd or 3rd of January to get his team spun up.

01:14:55.897 --> 01:15:00.903
And Robert Malone spun up a team of mostly volunteers and used a combination of

01:15:01.383 --> 01:15:27.280
computer simulation of x-ray crystallography models of two different enzymes and then screened all known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog to see whether they could usefully interact with that three-dimensional model and he identified four drugs within three weeks that he then proceeded to get into clinical trials and to push for repurposed drugs because that's what him and DITRA and DOD and his buddy David Hone do.

01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:33.002
But he got a call from the CIA.

01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:35.603
That's the reason why he decided to spin his team up.

01:15:35.703 --> 01:15:43.005
Otherwise, he was focused exclusively on Emus and his horses and the stuff that's going on at the foot of the Shenandoah Mountains.

01:15:43.325 --> 01:15:50.247
And the virus begins to pop up in those just as sort of, hey, this could be something and we should keep an eye on it.

01:15:50.367 --> 01:15:51.608
You say it's in his brief.

01:15:51.688 --> 01:15:53.589
We know that he doesn't always read his brief.

01:15:54.989 --> 01:15:57.670
So what do we know about when did the president know?

01:15:58.208 --> 01:16:01.971
That's a good question about whether or not he might have actually read it.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:05.853
He's never been clear any of the times that he's been asked.

01:16:05.893 --> 01:16:10.877
And I think our reporting suggests that, as you say, it's not clear at all that he reads the briefing.

01:16:12.338 --> 01:16:14.960
And the president now says he was distracted.

01:16:15.546 --> 01:16:17.767
I mean, I got impeached, I think.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.868
So the question now is, when did the president know?

01:16:21.568 --> 01:16:26.370
Did the CIA try to tell the president, but the president's not reading his daily briefs?

01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:31.492
He actually said the words, we know that he doesn't always read his briefs.

01:16:32.032 --> 01:16:32.752
Stop lying!

01:16:33.112 --> 01:16:39.235
That is an extraordinary statement to make, an extraordinary narrative to tell.

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:42.336
You know, I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it, right?

01:16:43.334 --> 01:16:45.995
and busy securing a big trade deal with China.

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:52.037
A rare moment of collaboration after more than two years of acrimonious talks.

01:16:53.457 --> 01:16:57.959
During this period, Azar was trying to alert the president but couldn't get a meeting.

01:16:58.439 --> 01:16:58.819
Oh boy.

01:16:58.839 --> 01:17:03.480
Instead, over two weeks passed before he got a call back from Mar-a-Lago on a Saturday.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.301
Oh, here we go.

01:17:04.321 --> 01:17:06.841
And the president wanted to discuss something else.

01:17:08.282 --> 01:17:11.783
The president was not reached by Secretary Azar until January 18th.

01:17:12.634 --> 01:17:13.195
Wow.

01:17:13.215 --> 01:17:17.379
The president's first concern at that time was to talk about e-cigarettes.

01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:25.166
Stephen Morrison is a health policy expert who has long warned that America was unprepared for a pandemic like this one.

01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:26.007
Did you hear that?

01:17:26.027 --> 01:17:28.289
He wanted to talk about e-cigarettes.

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:34.735
And Secretary Abzar was having a hard time conveying the gravity of the situation to the president.

01:17:35.199 --> 01:17:44.867
This is 18 days after the Chinese government has recognized that they are seeing deaths from this, and it takes 18 days for Azar to get to the president.

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:45.467
Correct.

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:48.230
Was that the president's first true briefing on this?

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:51.893
As far as I know, it was the first serious high-level discussion.

01:17:53.274 --> 01:17:56.396
But it is unclear how much Azar pressed the president.

01:17:56.897 --> 01:17:58.218
He declined to be interviewed.

01:17:58.798 --> 01:18:04.203
According to Michael Scheer, Azar actually reassured the president that he didn't need to worry.

01:18:04.983 --> 01:18:09.004
What Azar wanted to communicate to the president was, we got this.

01:18:09.104 --> 01:18:11.745
We're not taking this lightly.

01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:13.285
CDC is on it.

01:18:13.925 --> 01:18:15.005
FDA is on it.

01:18:15.426 --> 01:18:18.746
We're monitoring it closely, but also not.

01:18:19.066 --> 01:18:32.910
At the same time, of course, Kevin McKernan was already on a podcast saying that the FDA needed to get out of the way, that the FDA and its 10 pages of EUA paperwork was going to delay our response to the pandemic and was part of the problem.

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:46.058
Kevin McKernan, the guy who cut his teeth in the Human Genome Project and decided to start screening marijuana with PCR for COVID so that he would be ahead of the ball in case old people started to die.

01:18:46.078 --> 01:18:51.882
You know, because so many people are saving Medicare a ton of money by using weed.

01:18:52.282 --> 01:18:57.726
And so if the COVID is in the weed, I got to know before people start smoking it.

01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:02.089
And he was also on podcasts telling people that the FDA was gonna be in the way.

01:19:02.469 --> 01:19:10.916
At the same time that Donald Trump is being, you know, led by the nose into this crisis.

01:19:11.817 --> 01:19:13.658
We all have to panic and shut the country down.

01:19:13.678 --> 01:19:18.983
I mean, at this point, it's really everybody is in the mode of, you know, we gotta keep an eye on this.

01:19:20.424 --> 01:19:22.285
Are there words about a pandemic at this point?

01:19:22.305 --> 01:19:23.226
No, not at all.

01:19:23.286 --> 01:19:24.787
And we have it under control.

01:19:24.908 --> 01:19:26.569
It's gonna be just fine.

01:19:27.768 --> 01:19:35.713
As late as January 26th, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, downplayed the dangers.

01:19:36.334 --> 01:19:39.236
The American people should not be worried or frightened by this.

01:19:39.396 --> 01:19:46.481
It's a very, very low risk to the United States because we have ways of preparing, of screening, of people coming in.

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:51.304
But it's something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously.

01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:58.485
A prominent biostatistician, Nicholas Jewell, had been tracking the virus for over a month.

01:19:59.285 --> 01:20:14.928
There was still a remarkable lack of urgency in the Western world that this was actually almost inevitably going to reach their shores and that it was going to be potentially catastrophic unless we took major steps.

01:20:15.028 --> 01:20:21.629
So there's no question in my mind that we lost the time that we had gained from the early warning coming out of

01:20:22.427 --> 01:20:24.348
Oh, that's a different message.

01:20:24.428 --> 01:20:32.210
Now we're getting a message that we did get early warning, that people knew, but we blew it.

01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:33.651
We wasted that time.

01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:35.311
Was it Trump's fault?

01:20:35.351 --> 01:20:36.631
Or was it Fauci's fault?

01:20:36.651 --> 01:20:37.912
Or was it Redfield's fault?

01:20:37.952 --> 01:20:44.534
Whose fault was it that we wasted that crucial time when we could have just put down the hammer of lockdown and stopped this forever?

01:20:44.574 --> 01:20:50.296
We could have just distributed ivermectin and silicoxib to everybody for 30 days and got to zero COVID right away.

01:20:50.336 --> 01:20:51.356
We could have done something.

01:20:53.692 --> 01:21:02.986
On January 29th, White House economic advisor Peter Navarro sent the president a lengthy memo warning that there was a risk of massive loss of life.

01:21:03.587 --> 01:21:05.810
He urged flights from China to be halted.

01:21:07.628 --> 01:21:08.288
the next day.

01:21:08.428 --> 01:21:17.473
Peter Navarro, the guy that Lee Minyan credits with helping her to defect and bring the message of the unrestricted bioweapon to America.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:28.059
Peter Navarro listed in the same breath as Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani when she is saying thank you, and then followed by the Morgan family.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.902
Secretary Azar had a second call with the president.

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:35.790
This time, he was more concerned.

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:40.954
He warned the president that the coronavirus might become a serious pandemic.

01:21:42.175 --> 01:21:44.577
The virus has been spread rapidly over the last month.

01:21:45.197 --> 01:21:49.781
The president responded by restricting some flights from China, but not all.

01:21:50.341 --> 01:21:53.304
And millions of people had already left Wuhan anyway.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.183
And many of those people were flying out to the rest of the world.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:01.824
Yes.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:08.250
In fact, there are direct flights from Wuhan to many cities in the U.S.

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:14.856
And that was happening throughout the month of January until the lockdown.

01:22:15.396 --> 01:22:17.058
So those are extremely important weeks.

01:22:18.279 --> 01:22:18.479
Yes.

01:22:22.485 --> 01:22:30.410
In fact, in the month before President Trump's decision to restrict flights, an estimated 380,000 people entered the U.S.

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:31.151
from China.

01:22:33.192 --> 01:22:37.154
Even afterwards, if you were an American, you were exempted.

01:22:37.975 --> 01:22:41.237
And flights from Europe were not restricted for another six weeks.

01:22:42.698 --> 01:22:46.020
Furthermore, asymptomatic carriers were not detected.

01:22:46.764 --> 01:22:58.349
One of the things that they didn't know at the time was even if a person isn't symptomatic, doesn't have a fever, maybe that person is still spreading the virus all over the place because they have it and they're just not showing symptoms yet.

01:22:59.249 --> 01:23:01.230
The virus can spread undetected.

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:05.431
Then another assumption, the virus can spread undetected.

01:23:06.812 --> 01:23:09.473
Restricting flights proved to be a half measure.

01:23:11.963 --> 01:23:14.164
Didn't do enough, just like Paul Cottrell said.

01:23:14.484 --> 01:23:20.047
Viruses knew that we're going to be hit in waves here in the US.

01:23:20.067 --> 01:23:20.347
Waves.

01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:32.694
We have lost six weeks sitting on the sideline watching China struggle and watching other countries struggle, thinking that if we shut our borders, we'll be fine.

01:23:36.656 --> 01:23:43.986
Jeremy Konyndyk, a specialist in global health issues, remembers meeting with some Trump administration officials around this time.

01:23:44.767 --> 01:23:49.453
In February, you sat down with some administration officials, correct?

01:23:49.898 --> 01:23:53.140
So it was an off-the-record dinner, so I can't say too much specifically about it.

01:23:53.300 --> 01:24:05.309
But it was very clear that most of the bandwidth of the administration was focused on enforcing the travel restrictions on China, tracking people who had come back from there, quarantining people.

01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:09.052
That was the ball that they had their eye on at that time.

01:24:09.192 --> 01:24:09.872
What's wrong with that?

01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:16.117
Well, I was quite gobsmacked by that, because to my mind, the biggest priority at that point

01:24:16.863 --> 01:24:20.666
was not preventing it from coming here, because it was inevitable that it would come here.

01:24:20.786 --> 01:24:27.851
You know, it's fine to try and keep it out, but you have to do so with the expectation that, at best, you are buying time.

01:24:29.592 --> 01:24:35.536
The problem was that the administration was failing to understand the basic math behind a pandemic.

01:24:36.297 --> 01:24:41.240
If I tell you there's 30 cases in the United States, that's not going to scare you.

01:24:41.704 --> 01:24:44.446
that's not going to cause you to shut down your cities.

01:24:44.686 --> 01:24:48.729
If I tell you there's 60 cases in the United States, you still feel very comfortable.

01:24:49.409 --> 01:24:51.711
120, 240, and so on.

01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:56.534
You don't feel the power of exponential growth until it's absolutely.

01:24:56.834 --> 01:24:57.554
There you go.

01:24:57.675 --> 01:25:08.742
Now that's it right there because people don't understand math, they don't understand graphs, and they're just throwing in the idea that this virus is gonna go exponential.

01:25:11.741 --> 01:25:16.763
I mean pattern integrities like insects and rabbits don't go exponential.

01:25:17.983 --> 01:25:21.085
And if they do, they go exponential for a very short time.

01:25:22.085 --> 01:25:28.067
So the idea that they are, they are telling us that at any moment it could go exponential.

01:25:28.087 --> 01:25:32.109
The only reason why it hasn't gone exponential is because we're lucky.

01:25:35.751 --> 01:25:42.076
And that's why there could be a second wave this winter, which is previewing the winter of 2020 still.

01:25:44.398 --> 01:25:46.319
This is August of 2020.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.461
So we're not in the winter yet.

01:25:48.521 --> 01:25:51.683
They're trying to get everybody to accept the fact that another wave could come.

01:25:52.144 --> 01:25:57.268
They're trying to get everyone to accept the fact that the only reason why we're still alive is because we got lucky.

01:25:58.493 --> 01:26:02.756
and that there's asymptomatic spread, it could already be in the exponential part of the curve.

01:26:02.796 --> 01:26:08.220
We are in big trouble if we don't realize that we don't understand the math of exponentials.

01:26:10.062 --> 01:26:16.066
Just assuming, I guess, that a RNA with a furin cleavage site and some HIV inserts can definitely go exponential.

01:26:16.707 --> 01:26:17.147
Stunning.

01:26:17.227 --> 01:26:23.332
So when you say, oh, if there are 10,000 cases in the United States, then we ought to pay attention.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:26.954
The trouble is, in two or three days now, it's 20,000.

01:26:28.257 --> 01:26:31.020
Within another two or three days, it's 16 times.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:34.783
So it takes a long time to ramp up exponential growth.

01:26:35.764 --> 01:26:39.628
But once it gets your attention, it's stunning at its speed.

01:26:42.911 --> 01:26:43.251
Can't.

01:26:43.752 --> 01:26:44.753
RNA can't do that.

01:26:44.893 --> 01:26:47.135
I'm sorry, but RNA can't do that.

01:26:48.993 --> 01:26:57.702
In New York City, an infectious disease specialist with New York Presbyterian Hospital started to see cases he suspected of being COVID-19 by mid-February.

01:27:00.123 --> 01:27:05.366
We started to hear that there were a lot of viral illnesses that we were not able to identify.

01:27:05.466 --> 01:27:06.347
Look who it is!

01:27:07.788 --> 01:27:15.192
PBS NewsHour promoting the Twiv star Griffin, who's on once a week with Vincent Racaniello.

01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:16.513
Amazing.

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:20.795
Actually, PBS NewsHour and Frontline promoted him.

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:21.776
Wow.

01:27:21.856 --> 01:27:26.859
From a lot of the community doctors in our area that maybe we were seeing early spread here.

01:27:29.943 --> 01:27:33.644
During this time, the president is saying everything's under control.

01:27:33.984 --> 01:27:35.565
People that want to get a test.

01:27:35.745 --> 01:27:40.446
I do think that that's a very, very important point to make, that we don't even know what spread in Wuhan.

01:27:40.486 --> 01:27:42.087
It could have also been bad ideas.

01:27:42.147 --> 01:27:43.467
It could have been bad treatments.

01:27:43.547 --> 01:27:48.669
It could have been a legitimate bacterial pneumonia that people were getting.

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:50.470
It could have been the deployment of a toxin.

01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:52.190
Lots of things, right?

01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:53.491
It doesn't have to be a clone.

01:27:53.971 --> 01:27:57.112
It didn't have to be synthetic DNA or RNA in these people.

01:27:58.693 --> 01:28:02.336
And if they were all sick, there's probably an explanation for it.

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:08.381
But I don't think it's an RNA molecule that can be traced all the way back from then to now.

01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:09.622
No way in hell.

01:28:09.722 --> 01:28:14.226
You get a test that this is going to disappear when the weather warms up.

01:28:14.506 --> 01:28:16.868
How did you take that in at the time?

01:28:17.689 --> 01:28:25.335
You know, it was tough because, you know, as clinicians, when you get the sense something is going on, you're waiting for the ability to confirm that.

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.564
But most of the response was, you know what?

01:28:28.704 --> 01:28:32.446
Until we see a large number of cases, we don't want to over-respond.

01:28:32.466 --> 01:28:34.588
We don't want to be the boy who cried wolf.

01:28:35.828 --> 01:28:39.030
In fact, there were people who thought you were a little bit out there.

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:41.031
They said, what's wrong with Dr. Griffin?

01:28:41.492 --> 01:28:48.456
Well, that was actually when I reached out to one of the other infectious disease physicians in the area.

01:28:48.476 --> 01:28:51.998
And I said, hey, we really should start communicating and preparing.

01:28:52.898 --> 01:28:56.060
And yeah, his response to one of my partners was, what's wrong with Dr. Griffin?

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:59.820
Why is he, like, getting so worked up about this?

01:29:01.841 --> 01:29:03.502
Dr. Griffin was not alone.

01:29:04.222 --> 01:29:09.305
Many doctors and scientists were increasingly concerned that America was not prepared.

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:27.727
Among the first countries outside China to face the coronavirus was South Korea.

01:29:28.647 --> 01:29:33.310
That's where none other than Kevin McCairn got his case.

01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:37.432
And we're going to describe that super spreader event right now, I think.

01:29:38.693 --> 01:29:39.153
Sweet.

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:43.536
Their response is now a case study in how to handle an outbreak.

01:29:45.537 --> 01:29:50.620
Back in 2015, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, had scared them.

01:29:53.928 --> 01:29:54.868
I'd like to look that up.

01:29:54.888 --> 01:29:57.669
I spoke to South Korea's foreign minister, Kang Kun-ha.

01:29:58.669 --> 01:30:04.051
The lessons from the mares experience was instrumental.

01:30:04.091 --> 01:30:08.972
I think that failure had the seeds for the success this time.

01:30:09.773 --> 01:30:12.433
It's weird because I thought mares was in camels.

01:30:13.254 --> 01:30:15.414
So why was mares in South Korea?

01:30:15.474 --> 01:30:16.555
That's strange.

01:30:16.595 --> 01:30:17.475
I got to look into that.

01:30:17.515 --> 01:30:19.756
I didn't know South Korea had anything to do with mares.

01:30:19.856 --> 01:30:20.996
That's bizarre.

01:30:21.903 --> 01:30:23.925
Officials called an emergency meeting.

01:30:24.246 --> 01:30:25.647
That is super bizarre.

01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:28.010
I am really befuddled by that.

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:31.113
Four known cases of COVID-19 in the whole country.

01:30:31.433 --> 01:30:36.899
Healthcare officials summoned 20 private companies on January 27th to a conference room

01:30:37.279 --> 01:30:47.550
So now they're telling us a story about how unlike us, when they only had four cases, Korea already went balls to the walls and called in all kinds of experts and went for it.

01:30:47.751 --> 01:30:51.635
And that's why South Korea's response has been so successful.

01:30:55.273 --> 01:30:58.195
The train station in Seoul is not just a train station.

01:30:58.215 --> 01:31:00.876
It's a multi-function complex.

01:31:01.396 --> 01:31:08.820
And so if you want to bring in experts from all across the country and have a quick meeting, this would be the ideal place.

01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:14.643
The meeting at Seoul Station was prepared and carried out by the Korean CDC.

01:31:15.364 --> 01:31:18.945
Dr. Lee Hyuk-min was at the meeting and headed the initiative.

01:31:19.246 --> 01:31:23.948
The purpose of the meeting was to encourage the development of commercialized

01:31:24.329 --> 01:31:26.713
The meeting was tense.

01:31:26.753 --> 01:31:29.998
The meeting was tense?

01:31:30.018 --> 01:31:31.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:36.164 --> 01:31:39.946
It was tense because no one knew how contagious the virus was.

01:31:40.106 --> 01:31:42.707
And so what was the thing that they got?

01:31:42.767 --> 01:31:50.291
They got diagnostics, not countermeasures, not antivirals, not vitamin D and C and zinc, none of those things.

01:31:50.351 --> 01:32:00.956
They were getting together 20 different companies to talk about diagnostics, sequencing, lateral flow test, antibody, seroprevalence, this kind of shit.

01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:02.717
And how much time they had.

01:32:04.297 --> 01:32:05.398
In our estimation,

01:32:06.018 --> 01:32:12.060
The chance of the importation of COVID-19 in Korea is very high, we thought.

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:25.424
So when the first patient was confirmed in Korea, my first action is to make the diagnostic testing method to detect the COVID-19.

01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:47.106
Based on their experience with MERS, the number of infected people could be- Think about how impressive that is, that their goal is to make a product, their goal is to pursue IP, their goal is to pursue a diagnostic, not treatment, not understanding the physiology, and that's the key to see here.

01:32:50.188 --> 01:32:51.790
Be doubling every few days.

01:32:54.844 --> 01:32:56.765
In a matter of weeks, South Korea.

01:32:57.205 --> 01:33:02.248
An RNA-based signal is doubling every few days.

01:33:02.989 --> 01:33:03.729
Stop lying!

01:33:04.309 --> 01:33:08.212
An RNA-based signal is doubling every few days.

01:33:08.832 --> 01:33:10.253
Stop lying!

01:33:11.493 --> 01:33:13.915
Could be looking at over 100,000 cases.

01:33:18.658 --> 01:33:24.441
Moving fast, just days after the train station meeting, four companies had developed COVID tests.

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:28.670
Just over a week later, one was approved for use.

01:33:30.431 --> 01:33:35.053
By February 7th, 46 labs across the country began to test people.

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:41.857
A process that ordinarily could take a year had been completed in just over a week.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.718
Only one test was approved?

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:44.018
Wow.

01:33:45.765 --> 01:33:47.867
And then they made a bunch of it, or they had to take all the samples?

01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:50.670
There were only four cases when they had their meeting and call to action.

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.471
That's right.

01:33:52.171 --> 01:33:54.774
And they recognized how dangerous this was.

01:33:55.054 --> 01:33:59.098
And even if all you have are four cases, that is a dangerous moment.

01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:04.844
They tested around 10,000 people daily.

01:34:05.585 --> 01:34:08.468
They then swung into action very decisively.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:16.413
and set up this enormous testing regime along with very robust tools for monitoring cases and tracing contacts.

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:23.776
I'm starting to panic now because I'm starting to think if they really swabbed everybody and then put the data in a database.

01:34:29.039 --> 01:34:34.561
If they did that to all the people that they swabbed in America, all of this data is collected

01:34:38.598 --> 01:34:40.439
That might be all they can get from us, right?

01:34:40.679 --> 01:34:42.780
Once they have that, they don't need us anymore.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.381
It's our kids they want.

01:34:46.542 --> 01:34:52.425
And if I hear that they were testing 10,000 people, I mean, I don't know, I'm just getting, I don't like it anymore.

01:34:52.605 --> 01:34:54.826
And isolating and quarantining people based on that.

01:34:56.507 --> 01:34:59.729
They began acting before it seemed like they needed to do so.

01:35:00.455 --> 01:35:06.559
Former head of USAID, Dr. Rajiv Shah, was astounded by what South Korea was able to do.

01:35:07.059 --> 01:35:13.383
Former head of USAID, the CIA funded funding source, you know, that's what they all say.

01:35:15.364 --> 01:35:15.964
Look at that.

01:35:16.004 --> 01:35:16.545
Come on.

01:35:16.585 --> 01:35:17.145
For an RNA molecule.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:33.299
This would make sense if it was a bacteria that you thought was sprayed on your... I mean like if it was a pattern integrity, but this is extraordinary.

01:35:33.859 --> 01:35:47.028
...points who were making drive-through testing available very broadly by doing swab collections and mailing it into a public health laboratory construct where... and reference labs that can validate the data quickly.

01:35:52.048 --> 01:35:54.251
They thought everything was under control.

01:35:54.271 --> 01:35:56.994
Remember, flattening the curve was something that we could do.

01:35:57.014 --> 01:35:57.714
You know, the curve was real.

01:36:06.957 --> 01:36:08.758
That's what flattening the curve does, right?

01:36:08.878 --> 01:36:12.139
It makes the curve real, and the curve was never real to begin with.

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:15.380
The curve was based solely on murder and lies.

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.320
They had found only 30 cases.

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.921
Then, on February 18th, they identified a 61-year-old woman in Daegu, South Korea.

01:36:34.867 --> 01:36:37.768
At the time, they had discovered no other cases in Daegu.

01:36:38.848 --> 01:36:44.290
This is the town where Kevin McCairn supposedly would get sick, right?

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:52.233
Because he says, and he claims regularly, that he was infected in a super spreader event in Korea that was on World News.

01:36:53.419 --> 01:37:04.704
And most recently, he recounted this story in the presence of Stephanie Seneff on his own program, which obviously means Stephanie Seneff is an awful person as well.

01:37:05.744 --> 01:37:08.726
But when they traced her contacts, it led them here.

01:37:10.475 --> 01:37:11.956
the Shincheonji Church.

01:37:12.517 --> 01:37:13.918
And don't take any offense to that.

01:37:13.998 --> 01:37:19.923
Stephanie Seneff has been the control agent for glyphosate biology for like 10 years before the pandemic.

01:37:19.963 --> 01:37:22.906
And she was part of Steve Kirsch's steering committee.

01:37:22.966 --> 01:37:30.992
So if you had any idea that Stephanie Seneff was a good guy, you were wrong about that.

01:37:31.713 --> 01:37:38.699
A Christian sect that claims over 200,000 members who believe that their leader, this man, is the Messiah.

01:37:41.553 --> 01:37:46.177
Officials knew they had a big problem.

01:37:46.237 --> 01:37:48.579
Is there really a false messiah in South Korea?

01:37:49.219 --> 01:37:53.983
So how did he get infected by the followers of a false messiah in Korea?

01:37:54.023 --> 01:37:54.724
That's interesting.

01:37:55.204 --> 01:37:58.747
Obvious that this was a cluster that was at risk.

01:37:59.087 --> 01:38:05.252
And then we decided to trace the group as a whole.

01:38:05.592 --> 01:38:07.113
And this is about 9,000, 10,000 people.

01:38:10.913 --> 01:38:13.174
So you tested 9,000 members of the church?

01:38:13.934 --> 01:38:18.757
Not all of them, but we contacted them to the extent that they were traceable.

01:38:20.177 --> 01:38:21.758
Asked if they had any symptoms.

01:38:22.999 --> 01:38:27.421
The percentage of positives among them were much higher than any other groups.

01:38:30.362 --> 01:38:33.184
Oh, more spray.

01:38:33.224 --> 01:38:35.004
Oh, black suited sprayers.

01:38:35.085 --> 01:38:36.765
Those guys are like the special troops.

01:38:38.146 --> 01:38:39.927
They were doing it in office buildings.

01:38:43.277 --> 01:38:50.902
Today, South Korea, along with Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, has managed to control the spread of the virus better than most countries.

01:38:51.122 --> 01:38:52.603
And that is an illusion, right?

01:38:52.643 --> 01:39:01.068
That is an illusion that they want to use to leverage against America, to make America think that the murder and lies that's happening in America is just our inability to deal.

01:39:01.708 --> 01:39:07.490
our inability to enact draconian measures that are strong enough and forceful enough to stop the spread.

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:13.592
That's the illusion that the PBS NewsHour was foisting on our family and friends in 2020.

01:39:14.352 --> 01:39:14.853
Hear it.

01:39:18.034 --> 01:39:23.035
In Seoul, a crowded city of 10 million people, there have been just four known deaths.

01:39:23.696 --> 01:39:27.957
In the country of South Korea, how many deaths approximately?

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:28.621
It would be 260, 264.

01:39:28.681 --> 01:39:31.627
The number has now crept up to around 300.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:51.119
By mid-January, the CDC was busy developing its own diagnostic test.

01:39:51.679 --> 01:39:52.159
Here we go.

01:39:52.759 --> 01:40:11.506
So now, of course, remember what happened, is that the CDC developed its own test because they didn't want to use the Jorston-Corman test, the Corman-Jorston test that McCairn and Yeadon and Claire Craig and Thomas Binder and all these other meddlers had decided to come out and say, I don't know, I don't think Thomas Binder is a meddler.

01:40:11.526 --> 01:40:14.487
I think he was included in that paper so that they could control him.

01:40:15.492 --> 01:40:25.639
And I had a very optimistic opinion that Michael Yeadon was also on that objection to the PCR test of the WHO in order to control him.

01:40:25.699 --> 01:40:31.863
But his latest performance with Sasha leads me to believe that he's either been coerced or co-opted.

01:40:33.524 --> 01:40:44.771
In any event, what we're talking about here, and I'm reminding you of, is that there was a paper that was written very early on in the pandemic that was coordinated by Claire Craig and

01:40:45.379 --> 01:40:52.620
Kevin McKernan, and a guy by the name of Mahaltra.

01:40:54.938 --> 01:41:15.875
and he's a German guy, and these people wrote a paper that purported to speak out against the methodologies and the specific details of the WHO test, and also said that they were very angry that the WHO test was approved in 24 hours and that means that it wasn't peer-reviewed.

01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:23.366
They also filed an addendum to that, which was supposedly answering some critical response to the first paper.

01:41:23.406 --> 01:41:33.171
But unfortunately, their website that they bought together, and you know, .com, you know, Corman-Jorston-Report.com, that website's gone.

01:41:33.512 --> 01:41:35.353
The original article is gone.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:38.074
The only thing you can find is the addendum.

01:41:38.114 --> 01:41:44.298
So these guys who thought to get together and organize an international statement against

01:41:44.858 --> 01:42:00.054
an international peer-reviewed paper against the WHO PCR thing that included Kevin McKernan and included Claire Craig, two people that I have identified over the last two months as being central to this illusion of consensus.

01:42:00.815 --> 01:42:06.962
Definitely traitor, Kevin McKernan, and definitely a traitor to the UK, Claire Craig.

01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:17.680
And so these people pretended to come out at the same time that the United States said that they were gonna make their own test and then flubbed it.

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:26.766
Listen, all the same, the same elaborate theater, just parts of it were on TV and parts of it were on Twitter and social media.

01:42:27.267 --> 01:42:28.067
Good morning, everyone.

01:42:28.848 --> 01:42:33.611
On January 28th, Secretary Azar announced they were ready to go.

01:42:33.811 --> 01:42:35.312
Drosten, sorry, Drosten.

01:42:35.352 --> 01:42:36.453
Was I saying Jorsten?

01:42:36.513 --> 01:42:37.594
Yeah, Drosten, sorry.

01:42:37.654 --> 01:42:39.135
Accomplishment within one week

01:42:39.537 --> 01:42:43.679
Within one week, the CDC had invented a rapid diagnostic test.

01:42:44.179 --> 01:42:49.622
Within weeks... Right out of the gate, I was feeling really good about the process.

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:54.164
Scott Becker is the CEO of the Association of Public Health Labs.

01:42:54.464 --> 01:43:03.888
We were going to be able to cover the country to a good extent for the surveillance and early detection that was really job one.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.623
But that optimism evaporated by the end of the first week in February.

01:43:10.343 --> 01:43:12.805
It was Sunday morning, February 8th.

01:43:13.185 --> 01:43:14.426
I woke up a little bit late.

01:43:15.227 --> 01:43:19.910
I read my texts and my emails and I start seeing these messages.

01:43:23.092 --> 01:43:24.152
We're having a problem.

01:43:24.233 --> 01:43:25.393
Nice link.

01:43:25.493 --> 01:43:26.194
Thanks, Daniel.

01:43:30.036 --> 01:43:31.137
I call that an OSM.

01:43:31.197 --> 01:43:32.358
It was my moment.

01:43:33.098 --> 01:43:38.720
And I remember thinking, oh, my God, wait till governors and others find out about this.

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.661
We're all counting on getting testing up and running.

01:43:43.321 --> 01:43:46.222
And what a nightmare this is going to be.

01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:59.306
So it was pretty devastating to everyone, the CDC staff, to public health labs, to epidemiologists, public health community.

01:43:59.786 --> 01:44:02.127
You know, we were left with

01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:05.396
out the biggest tool in our toolbox.

01:44:05.636 --> 01:44:10.087
Government officials discovered contamination in a CDC lab in Atlanta.

01:44:10.373 --> 01:44:16.116
By then, a diagnostic test developed by German scientists was available from the WHO.

01:44:16.816 --> 01:44:17.316
But U.S.

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:21.218
officials would insist it was better to find an American solution.

01:44:21.998 --> 01:44:36.065
And in the background, in the dissident movement, where we were already talking about the lab leak, we already had dissidents putting out a paper and sharing it amongst each other that was saying that the WHO test was bullshit anyway.

01:44:37.423 --> 01:44:39.525
So it makes sense for us not to use it.

01:44:40.265 --> 01:44:43.728
What an amazing theater it was, ladies and gentlemen.

01:44:44.429 --> 01:44:55.999
Any of these groups can submit their testing kits through our regulatory processes, but with- Don't forget that that guy by the name of, um, um, um, um, Burkhalter.

01:44:56.739 --> 01:45:05.827
Burkhalter is the guy who Kevin McKernan has collaborated with to show us that there's double-stranded DNA contamination in the transfections.

01:45:06.974 --> 01:45:17.919
The funny thing is, is Burkhalter at this time in American history was exclusively focused on filling that big gap of sequencing problems and big gap of PCR testing.

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:28.004
And so he was in the weeds and in the mud here trying to put together a, and help formulate a test product of his own.

01:45:28.044 --> 01:45:29.285
He was getting in on the action.

01:45:30.299 --> 01:45:35.962
Without that and without a plan, we are not going to accept tests that have not been studied by us.

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:41.386
Is that excusable that they failed to have a test ready to go?

01:45:41.406 --> 01:45:44.288
That's inexcusable in my book.

01:45:44.688 --> 01:45:49.591
I mean, how can you distribute something that is so critical to monitor

01:45:50.436 --> 01:45:52.977
the epidemic and have it be faulty.

01:45:53.357 --> 01:45:55.578
We cannot distribute drugs like that.

01:45:55.698 --> 01:45:59.819
We cannot distribute other FDA approved tests in that fashion.

01:46:00.299 --> 01:46:02.260
So that's certainly inexcusable.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:03.721
And it's said.

01:46:03.841 --> 01:46:07.122
Keep getting this Chinese guy to tell us what they did wrong.

01:46:07.162 --> 01:46:09.503
It's really weird.

01:46:09.543 --> 01:46:13.164
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center.

01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:17.165
Wow.

01:46:17.525 --> 01:46:18.106
Wow.

01:46:18.286 --> 01:46:19.086
Month, I would say.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:23.662
Is it unusual to have a glitch in the initial tests?

01:46:24.722 --> 01:46:28.184
I have not seen another mistake like this at CDC.

01:46:28.364 --> 01:46:32.987
The tests have rolled out very effectively without a glitch in the past.

01:46:33.527 --> 01:46:39.610
My mind is that this is just a wonderful addition to the game.

01:46:39.690 --> 01:46:49.916
It's a wonderful addition to the illusion that somebody like James Giordano could definitely tell you that there would be a forward-facing part of the brochure where we

01:46:50.336 --> 01:46:52.837
and distribute a few cases here and a few cases there.

01:46:53.197 --> 01:47:13.162
And then there will be the back room behind the curtain version, which is a whole series of officials on TV and officials on social media and fake dissidents on social media that would all control public opinion in order to get people to accept the pandemic and the solutions that the state wanted to provide for it.

01:47:15.334 --> 01:47:20.738
You're just supposed to believe that maybe it was the DOD and a few people ceding cases and lying about it.

01:47:20.838 --> 01:47:21.698
No, no, no, no, no.

01:47:21.758 --> 01:47:26.081
It's a giant apparatus that spans internationally.

01:47:26.562 --> 01:47:32.946
And the idea was to use America and murder in America to bamboozle the whole world about this stuff.

01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:49.076
And at the same time, it was to use these five eyes countries, these other English speaking countries to create the illusion that America dropped the ball, that America's system fell apart, that Americans shouldn't trust their system, that America is hopelessly fractured.

01:47:49.116 --> 01:47:53.878
And that's one of the reasons why the pandemic is so bad there and not so bad in Asian countries.

01:47:54.398 --> 01:47:59.240
There are seeding a narrative of controlled demolition of the American idea.

01:48:01.903 --> 01:48:04.886
It's more than a pandemic that they are seeding.

01:48:04.946 --> 01:48:07.107
It's more than bad biology.

01:48:07.188 --> 01:48:18.076
It's giant assumptions about our role in it, giant assumptions about our intentions within it, and giant assumptions about who the bad guys are and who the bad guys aren't.

01:48:18.997 --> 01:48:22.780
Tom Friedman was head of the CDC during the Obama administration.

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:25.862
Is there any bigger misstep?

01:48:26.002 --> 01:48:30.986
Tom Friedman was also at Event 201, not the real one, but the official one.

01:48:31.488 --> 01:48:34.731
or stumble here than the failure to test.

01:48:35.292 --> 01:48:41.798
I think when we look back at what went right and what went wrong we're going to focus on February.

01:48:42.319 --> 01:48:46.183
What should have gotten done in February that didn't happen.

01:48:48.925 --> 01:48:53.027
So my first question to you is, does the CDC's test for coronavirus work?

01:48:53.367 --> 01:49:00.051
Yeah, the problem was when the test was sent to the states, one of the components had a contaminant in it.

01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:06.034
I asked Dr. Redfield why South Korea... So you think that's the only component test was contaminated?

01:49:06.094 --> 01:49:06.894
It's the only one?

01:49:07.535 --> 01:49:09.836
Even though a lot of them were manufactured in China?

01:49:10.723 --> 01:49:27.835
even though a lot of the lateral flow tests that the UK and America used are manufactured in China, you actually think that the manufacturing process and potential contamination with controls or with other reagents is not something that could happen at the private level as well?

01:49:29.156 --> 01:49:32.178
Especially when you're issuing between 200 and 220 EUAs for such diagnostics in 2020?

01:49:32.218 --> 01:49:33.579
Just one test, just like one shot,

01:49:41.368 --> 01:49:41.948
was bad.

01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:45.571
Johnson & Johnson was so bad we had to pull it off the shelf.

01:49:45.992 --> 01:49:48.594
The rest of the transfections are pretty good.

01:49:49.034 --> 01:49:56.079
You know, a lot of these tests are great, but the one that we rolled out first, we really flubbed it up because that one was contaminated.

01:49:59.233 --> 01:49:59.654
Lion!

01:49:59.974 --> 01:50:02.216
Can you see it for what it is, ladies and gentlemen?

01:50:02.356 --> 01:50:12.625
Every one of these little tidbits of the narrative is designed to be a fake handhold so that you climb right past a question.

01:50:14.287 --> 01:50:18.630
You climb right past the question of why do we need 220 different tests in America in a year?

01:50:22.478 --> 01:50:25.980
Why do we climb over the fact that these are proprietary tests?

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:32.263
Why do we climb over the fact that we don't have any data from the previous years, so we don't even know?

01:50:32.824 --> 01:50:34.245
Why do we climb over this fact?

01:50:34.305 --> 01:50:50.393
Instead, we focus on one little anecdotal story and then allow the listener, the participant, the one that's sitting on the chair playing the game to jump to the conclusion that the rest of these tests must be OK.

01:50:51.658 --> 01:50:53.319
succeeded where the U.S.

01:50:53.419 --> 01:50:53.759
failed.

01:50:54.619 --> 01:51:02.941
Korea had already developed private-public partnerships through the MERS thing and really had invested enormously appropriately.

01:51:03.502 --> 01:51:06.703
And that's what our nation had not done over the last 30 years.

01:51:07.103 --> 01:51:14.385
So you won't get an argument from me that the public health workforce has been really under-invested in for

01:51:14.585 --> 01:51:18.949
DITRA controlled all of the sequencing for the first year or more.

01:51:19.049 --> 01:51:24.413
So all the swabs that were PCR positive were not sequenced wherever they were found.

01:51:24.453 --> 01:51:30.338
They were sent to a central location and the sequencing was controlled by DITRA for more than a year.

01:51:30.758 --> 01:51:31.999
And that is public fact.

01:51:32.299 --> 01:51:32.799
decades.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:36.541
The CDC says it's now going to send improved tests.

01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:49.869
DITRA, you know, that's the group that is headed by David Hohn, on whose couch Robert Malone has served and has known for a very long time as his good friend.

01:51:50.769 --> 01:51:58.931
And yeah, David Holm, the guy that's got a virus-like particle patent with Sina Bavari, you know, the guy who's the head of the USAID.

01:51:58.991 --> 01:52:00.351
Both of them are foreigners.

01:52:00.411 --> 01:52:01.911
They're not Americans.

01:52:01.971 --> 01:52:05.692
So I feel really good about them being in charge of our infrastructure in that way.

01:52:06.072 --> 01:52:09.552
And Robert Malone is a best friend of him and was working for DITRA.

01:52:09.612 --> 01:52:16.194
DITRA, the one that also ran the domain server, and DITRA, the one that did all the sequencing for the first year and a half.

01:52:18.214 --> 01:52:22.056
Weeks were lost while the CDC remanufactured the tests.

01:52:31.922 --> 01:52:43.248
If the failure at the CDC and the outbreaks in China and South Korea did not instill more urgency... More than 200 tests were eventually ended their EUA by the FDA.

01:52:43.268 --> 01:52:43.848
That's correct.

01:52:43.968 --> 01:52:46.990
See, the February outbreak in Iran should have.

01:52:48.598 --> 01:52:53.661
This is Qom, a place of pilgrimage for Shiite Muslims from all over the world.

01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:55.181
Oh, this is Iran.

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:56.922
This is what happened in Iran.

01:52:56.982 --> 01:53:13.011
So again, keep in mind that if there is a deployment of a clone, if there is a deployment of a transfection that would one, give you the sequence indication of a coronavirus and two, express an immunogen that would cause people to get sick.

01:53:14.522 --> 01:53:32.849
than if you want to not believe in viruses, but still believe in synthetic DNA and RNA, then there's still a really good way that a lot of that spike protein could have found itself in a lot of people and could have even spread for a short period of time by shedding these sequences and these proteins to other people.

01:53:33.269 --> 01:53:39.532
You could have had an acute outbreak anywhere where a significant amount of that molecular clone was released.

01:53:41.483 --> 01:53:47.311
I've asked you to do this thought exercise in the past, and I'll ask you to do it again now.

01:53:48.291 --> 01:53:53.613
I want you to think of the first SARS virus release as a certain quantity.

01:53:54.253 --> 01:54:14.860
Imagine, for example, that they made a certain quantity of a self-replicating RNA molecule that has an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in it and a couple proteins in it and a couple of packaging sequences that Robert Malone would have been working on when he was a grad student back in the retrovirus days.

01:54:15.973 --> 01:54:23.255
And those packaging sequences will cause, for a limited period of time, that RNA to be replicated and repackaged and shed.

01:54:24.355 --> 01:54:37.559
And that they've been studying this technology for quite some time, as soon as they figured out that all eukaryotes are shedding genetic signals into a very limited set of genetic signals, and that that system could be hijacked.

01:54:39.028 --> 01:54:40.890
and occasionally maybe it is hijacked.

01:54:40.910 --> 01:55:05.232
So what they did was they took those signals that Nathan Wolf and Peter Daszak and Ralph Baric were studying but could never really get to grow in culture, and they made a large quantity of them, and then they threw them out of an airplane in China in 2002, and then they did their absolute best to see how far those molecules would go from the point where they threw the bottle.

01:55:06.673 --> 01:55:13.117
And it turned out that they could follow that molecule or traces of that molecule through 10,000 people.

01:55:13.517 --> 01:55:16.219
And of those 10,000 people, 700 of them died.

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:27.125
Now I want you to take that same thought experiment and imagine that they improved, they improved what they had in the bottle.

01:55:27.705 --> 01:55:35.750
And then instead of making just one bottle, they made five bottles and they threw one bottle in Italy, one bottle in Wuhan, one bottle in Iran,

01:55:37.833 --> 01:55:38.613
and they let it go.

01:55:39.914 --> 01:55:41.034
How far can we track it?

01:55:45.115 --> 01:56:05.280
Now I want you to imagine that that wasn't done on a clean chalkboard, that wasn't done on a background with no signals, but it was done on a background that was hot, a background where all kinds of these signals exist so that even if you don't really find the one you put out there, there's lots of other signals to find.

01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:32.454
And since the national security state knows that there was a specific signal, but the pharmaceutical companies don't, the DOD contractors don't, most of the people that are on Substack don't, since the only conclusion that people can come to is that there's no virus, then the idea of a hot background on which they spilled some paint and then told you that the paint was evidence of the hot background,

01:56:34.810 --> 01:56:48.077
and wherever they found the hot background was evidence that the paint was spreading, they have misconstrued a background signal and synthetic virology with pandemic potential.

01:56:48.678 --> 01:56:52.600
And they've been doing it for 20 years with Peter Daszak, with Nathan Wolf.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:57:01.265
And then at the beginning of the pandemic, they put people in all corners of the internet to make sure that any useful questioning of the narrative would never happen.

01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:10.312
with any useful alternative interpretations of the biology of what happened would never happen.

01:57:10.372 --> 01:57:20.494
And the only thing that we would get is an argument about whether it was a lab leak or gain of function, whether it was natural or gain of function, or whether there are any viruses at all.

01:57:24.074 --> 01:57:31.936
And so the continued testing and deployment of self-replicating RNAs with immunogens on them

01:57:33.049 --> 01:57:36.851
can go on into the future forever.

01:57:37.792 --> 01:57:45.497
Because our kids are gonna grow up in a world where they believe that pandemic potential exists and that we don't have to worry about synthetic biology.

01:57:45.537 --> 01:57:47.538
We don't have to worry about synthetic biology.

01:57:47.578 --> 01:57:58.105
We don't have to worry about the fact that if they wanted to, they could make enough of any PCR signal or any RNA sequence and then distribute it at anywhere they wanted to find it.

01:57:59.606 --> 01:58:00.807
We don't wanna talk about that.

01:58:03.519 --> 01:58:11.145
Instead, Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project wants you to believe that, well, if we make a lot of it, it's just the same as the stuff in nature.

01:58:11.205 --> 01:58:11.905
Come on, man.

01:58:12.326 --> 01:58:16.909
It's the same subgenomic RNA selection and bouquet as the original viruses.

01:58:16.929 --> 01:58:18.690
So you're not saying anything.

01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:20.272
It's just, what did he call it?

01:58:21.332 --> 01:58:22.113
What did he call it?

01:58:22.934 --> 01:58:27.917
He called it, uh, he called it like crazy.

01:58:27.977 --> 01:58:29.859
He called it, um, um, um,

01:58:31.448 --> 01:58:35.391
one who flew over the cuckoo's nest crazy or something like that in a sub stack.

01:58:35.411 --> 01:58:42.337
He wrote that concern over a large quantity of a, of a synthetic RNA would be, that's just silly.

01:58:44.815 --> 01:58:49.257
It's the whole point of their obfuscation.

01:58:49.317 --> 01:58:59.240
They never want you to understand that virology is an illusion created by synthetic RNA and DNA that's used to transform and transfect cell cultures in animals.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.500
They never want you to know it.

01:59:01.021 --> 01:59:13.545
Just like they never want you to know that healthy tissues in your body and your immune system, all of them are using very small genetic signals to communicate health and disease

01:59:14.915 --> 01:59:16.996
And those signals are really hard to study.

01:59:18.858 --> 01:59:20.839
They're very difficult to nail down.

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:33.128
And if we're ever going to understand how we are as a pattern integrity in existence and how we exist through time, then we're going to have to understand that communication mechanism.

01:59:33.188 --> 01:59:36.350
And the only way to understand it would be to turn everybody into lab animals.

01:59:40.543 --> 01:59:43.484
To understand that would be to turn everybody into lab animals.

01:59:43.504 --> 01:59:47.386
So they've decided to do that decades ago, decades ago.

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:52.148
That's why, for example, maybe I shouldn't pause with Ayatollah Khomeini on there.

01:59:52.989 --> 02:00:00.772
That's why we don't talk about, for example, let me just go back to, let me find a better picture here.

02:00:02.333 --> 02:00:05.955
That's why none of these people don't talk about implied consent.

02:00:07.387 --> 02:00:12.248
One of the things that I would like to say before I forget to say it, somebody sent me a very nice message about this.

02:00:13.168 --> 02:00:22.370
And it's really important that people understand that in America, if you're sending your kids to school, you are basically giving implied consent.

02:00:23.111 --> 02:00:26.751
Meaning that you're giving consent to whatever the school does.

02:00:27.251 --> 02:00:33.653
And if your kid goes along with it, by sending your kid to school, you've already given implied consent.

02:00:35.666 --> 02:00:54.820
And so there are legal sort of precedents set here, and there are parts of your school doctrine that will tell you this if you look for it, that if you don't want your kid to take a vaccine, you better make sure they're informed, because when we give vaccines at school, we'll give it to your kid, and you will have given implied consent by just sending him here.

02:00:54.901 --> 02:01:00.665
And many, many states in America have this with their public schools, so you need to be aware of it.

02:01:01.857 --> 02:01:13.041
because informed consent and the ability to say no is not being given to people in America and hasn't been given to children in America in public schools in a very, very long time.

02:01:14.961 --> 02:01:19.583
You need to see the vaccine schedule in America and it's mandating in public schools for what it is.

02:01:19.643 --> 02:01:26.085
It is a coercive means of removing your ability to exercise informed consent, which includes saying no.

02:01:27.407 --> 02:01:28.208
for decades.

02:01:28.468 --> 02:01:32.890
The CDC says it's now going to send improved tests to labs facing problems.

02:01:33.611 --> 02:01:37.413
Weeks were lost while the CDC remanufactured the tests.

02:01:47.319 --> 02:01:56.324
If the failure at the CDC and the outbreaks in China and South Korea did not instill more urgency, the February outbreak in Iran should have.

02:01:56.832 --> 02:02:00.834
Now, I wanna just say something about the British intelligence asset.

02:02:00.914 --> 02:02:12.398
One of the things that I keep thinking of is that the British crown or London was a giant weaponized pile of money 400 years ago.

02:02:13.479 --> 02:02:14.299
That's a problem.

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:20.202
That's a very big problem because just like the Vatican was a weaponized pile of money 400 years ago,

02:02:25.533 --> 02:02:26.513
Black Rock wasn't.

02:02:26.914 --> 02:02:27.974
State Street wasn't.

02:02:31.836 --> 02:02:45.801
And so it's very easy for us to focus on the characters in this comic book without realizing that 400 years ago, there were already weaponized piles of money that had almost conquered the globe.

02:02:49.286 --> 02:02:58.316
And one of the things that my friend G. Edward Griffin often argues is that we were led to believe as Americans that we broke away from that control, that we separated ourselves from the crown.

02:02:58.837 --> 02:03:10.170
But in reality, there have been traitors and their descendants in our government and in our culture since that breakaway, and we've never really fully broken away from the crown.

02:03:11.633 --> 02:03:17.035
And if that's the case, it's very interesting that Jill Glass Poole Malone's father worked for the Crown.

02:03:17.415 --> 02:03:25.918
It's very interesting that a lot of these people have connections to India or other places that are part of the Crown.

02:03:25.958 --> 02:03:39.922
And once you start to see it as the Crown, instead of as Five Eyes, then you start to see why maybe South Africa and South Africans were also recruited, interestingly, very early, like Panda.

02:03:41.761 --> 02:03:56.067
I'm starting to see it as a British crown thing too, which is also curious because Churchill actually called America an elephant and Russia a bear and called the UK a lion.

02:03:59.748 --> 02:04:06.191
This is Qom, a place of pilgrimage for Shiite Muslims from all over the world, including China.

02:04:08.686 --> 02:04:12.612
It was here that the world's next major outbreak of the virus erupted.

02:04:14.655 --> 02:04:18.901
From the beginning, Iran's leaders, like America's, played down the dangers.

02:04:20.635 --> 02:04:22.396
a mixture of religion and national.

02:04:22.636 --> 02:04:29.061
Yeah, the informed consent thing and the implied consent thing has just went down in in in either Vermont.

02:04:29.241 --> 02:04:30.302
I think it was in Vermont.

02:04:30.442 --> 02:04:32.764
So that's a real recent case that somebody sent to me.

02:04:32.784 --> 02:04:34.785
I think it was Kara.

02:04:35.706 --> 02:04:37.287
But anyway, whoever sent it to me, thank you.

02:04:37.327 --> 02:04:39.448
Pride had delayed Iran's response.

02:04:41.210 --> 02:04:44.832
Iran would soon be reporting the world's highest mortality rate.

02:04:46.453 --> 02:04:50.016
We never thought Iran would be one of the first countries hit

02:04:51.368 --> 02:04:52.209
by the pandemic.

02:04:53.170 --> 02:05:00.475
For whatever reason, because of our contacts, or because of other reasons, we were one of the first countries hit.

02:05:00.676 --> 02:05:04.579
I was able to reach Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, in Tehran.

02:05:05.519 --> 02:05:08.021
It was 6 o'clock in the morning, my time.

02:05:08.582 --> 02:05:09.983
Why do you think you were so hard hit?

02:05:10.063 --> 02:05:11.284
What are the theories now?

02:05:12.144 --> 02:05:13.105
Well, nobody knows.

02:05:13.225 --> 02:05:20.571
I mean, it was at a time when, more than anything, the population was unprepared.

02:05:23.194 --> 02:05:26.916
In fact, it was natural that Iran would be hit with a virus from China.

02:05:27.376 --> 02:05:28.216
It was natural?

02:05:28.236 --> 02:05:31.558
It is not only that Chinese pilgrims come here.

02:05:31.578 --> 02:05:34.719
Iran faces tough U.S.

02:05:34.799 --> 02:05:35.759
economic sanctions.

02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:41.122
And as a result, China has become Iran's lifeline to the outside world.

02:05:45.523 --> 02:05:49.905
Kamyar Alaei is an Iranian healthcare expert living in exile in the U.S.

02:05:49.925 --> 02:05:51.646
There are a lot of, you know,

02:05:52.130 --> 02:05:56.458
Iran's not going along with it if they don't understand what happened.

02:06:02.898 --> 02:06:05.079
That's why GigaOM Biological is so important.

02:06:05.099 --> 02:06:28.991
We're the only ones offering a alternative interpretation for what happened at the beginning of the pandemic that takes into account real virology methodologies, takes into account real pharmaceutical methodologies, takes into account real limitations to sequencing and PCR, and takes into account real limitations on what RNA virology is, not

02:06:29.511 --> 02:06:31.875
They're just no viruses and cells.

02:06:31.915 --> 02:06:33.817
When they die, they break up into little balls.

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:41.589
So that's what due to Chinese New Year, they went back to China, got infected, brought back to Iran.

02:06:42.791 --> 02:06:43.392
And we ask

02:06:47.419 --> 02:06:57.051
I don't think you can underestimate how few people in the world actually understand why RNA virology can be a mythology, but that doesn't mean there are no viruses.

02:06:57.511 --> 02:06:59.153
That doesn't mean that there was no COVID.

02:06:59.173 --> 02:07:00.935
That doesn't mean that there were no sequences.

02:07:01.857 --> 02:07:27.854
There are many different scenarios where a combination of lies about a background, lies about synthetic virology and lies about clone release or clone deployments and toxin deployments that could be used in combination to create the chaos that these people say is very simply understood as a spreading risk additive RNA virus.

02:07:30.017 --> 02:07:41.082
that is expanding exponentially across the globe because that's what RNA does when it has a fear and cleavage site and a couple of HIV inserts that they don't want to talk about because it's an Indian paper.

02:07:41.362 --> 02:07:42.663
Oh, Indian.

02:07:43.303 --> 02:07:44.083
Indian paper.

02:07:44.784 --> 02:07:45.304
Interesting.

02:07:45.324 --> 02:07:53.428
The flights from China to Iran, but due to political interests, the Iranian government, they decided not to do that.

02:07:54.768 --> 02:07:57.890
The flights were on Iran's largest carrier, Mahan Air.

02:07:58.885 --> 02:08:04.067
But Zarif told me that Iran cancelled its flights from China at the same time as America did.

02:08:05.187 --> 02:08:12.769
I think we were one of the first to limit flights and to screen passengers.

02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:16.911
The Americans cut flights from China at the end of January.

02:08:17.011 --> 02:08:23.833
My information is that our decision was made basically in the same time zone as the others.

02:08:25.799 --> 02:08:35.421
Yet one analysis of flight records shows that Mahan Air flew over 55 round trip flights to and from China between February 5th and February 23rd.

02:08:36.121 --> 02:08:41.163
So how many flights really did go from China to, you see the crazy stuff here?

02:08:42.203 --> 02:08:43.303
It's all the same.

02:08:43.343 --> 02:08:48.064
They're getting you to ask all these crazy questions about really how many flights were there in February?

02:08:48.104 --> 02:08:49.825
Like how should we really understand this?

02:08:49.885 --> 02:08:50.205
Come on.

02:08:50.385 --> 02:08:51.365
I just dried my pen out.

02:08:53.143 --> 02:08:55.665
Yeah, it's an extraordinary place we're in.

02:08:55.965 --> 02:08:57.466
Extraordinary place we're in.

02:08:57.867 --> 02:09:01.910
They flew on to Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, and other countries.

02:09:04.542 --> 02:09:10.705
All the while, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, would continue to downplay the virus.

02:09:11.166 --> 02:09:11.926
He said while.

02:09:11.946 --> 02:09:15.588
At one point he said it was possibly a biological attack.

02:09:29.175 --> 02:09:36.380
Do you agree with the Supreme Leader that the coronavirus was perhaps a biological attack by the United States?

02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:40.123
Scooby-Doo on the PBS NewsHour!

02:09:42.884 --> 02:09:50.068
Of course it had to be on the PBS NewsHour because this is where we say yes and no, and you know, who says what?

02:09:50.128 --> 02:09:53.490
And then for the most part, they're gonna say it wasn't a lab leak.

02:09:53.550 --> 02:09:55.991
It couldn't have been a lab leak and cover it up, right?

02:09:56.031 --> 02:09:56.952
That's what this is.

02:09:57.572 --> 02:09:58.653
Here's the on-ramp.

02:09:58.693 --> 02:10:00.094
You can see it right here.

02:10:00.954 --> 02:10:05.156
The PBS NewsHour put the little carrot in front of even our parents.

02:10:07.137 --> 02:10:07.478
Wow.

02:10:07.918 --> 02:10:08.438
On Iran.

02:10:08.518 --> 02:10:11.580
Well, there are a lot of speculations on all sides.

02:10:12.273 --> 02:10:16.294
about this, I said, it's not unreasonable to believe that.

02:10:21.655 --> 02:10:24.376
Talk of a biological attack was a distraction.

02:10:26.896 --> 02:10:29.096
Tehran's hospitals were overwhelmed.

02:10:29.217 --> 02:10:29.937
Oh, of course they were.

02:10:32.297 --> 02:10:35.438
On social media, people were seen collapsing in the streets.

02:10:35.578 --> 02:10:36.098
It's frontline.

02:10:36.118 --> 02:10:36.838
This is frontline.

02:10:38.438 --> 02:10:40.439
Oh, wow, people were collapsing in Iran, too.

02:10:40.539 --> 02:10:40.699
See?

02:10:41.678 --> 02:10:42.358
and in China.

02:10:44.299 --> 02:10:45.440
Wow.

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:48.421
I don't remember these.

02:10:48.441 --> 02:10:51.943
The government also delayed the closing of parliament.

02:10:52.023 --> 02:10:54.684
At least 23 senior government figures caught the coronavirus.

02:11:09.966 --> 02:11:13.070
Reportedly, around a dozen senior officials died.

02:11:13.090 --> 02:11:22.400
Hiraj Harirchi, the deputy health minister, appeared at this press conference clearly ill, while denying he had the coronavirus.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:24.783
And he said, no, this is just, you know, common cold.

02:11:24.803 --> 02:11:25.844
It's not a serious thing.

02:11:27.148 --> 02:11:30.531
The next day, however, he tested positive and was hospitalized.

02:11:30.551 --> 02:11:31.652
Interesting.

02:11:31.672 --> 02:11:34.254
Iran also being crowned would be interesting, wouldn't it?

02:11:35.755 --> 02:11:36.576
Hmm.

02:11:36.856 --> 02:11:38.938
Maybe China is cooperating with the crown.

02:11:38.998 --> 02:11:42.241
People continue to deny the seriousness of the situation.

02:11:42.501 --> 02:11:43.922
I don't think it's the crown, though.

02:11:43.942 --> 02:11:47.025
They just hide behind that royal family, right?

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:49.407
It's the city of London that we should be thinking about.

02:11:50.772 --> 02:11:54.413
It wasn't until March 16th that the government closed Qom's shrines.

02:12:28.943 --> 02:12:31.486
It took some time for us to close the shrine.

02:12:32.607 --> 02:12:37.772
We have a very traditional society with people who still do not agree with us.

02:12:38.012 --> 02:12:38.773
Interesting now.

02:12:38.853 --> 02:12:40.614
So they had trouble shutting down too.

02:12:40.695 --> 02:12:44.799
So it's the same narrative that if you could shut down as hard as the Koreans did,

02:12:45.359 --> 02:12:49.624
or the Japanese or the Chinese, then these kinds of problems would be avoided.

02:12:49.685 --> 02:13:02.321
But unfortunately, if you have a lot of religious zealots that won't listen to you, or you have a lot of freedom-loving people, conservatives that are into Trump, and you have a president like Trump, then you're gonna drop that ball.

02:13:10.006 --> 02:13:31.232
By then, government officials had begun enforcing... You know, the opium war being London versus China is hard for me to understand, Pamela, because I don't understand how a small country that was sailing around the world and had India and these other places was able to

02:13:33.163 --> 02:13:38.767
fight China by landing and giving them opioids.

02:13:38.807 --> 02:13:39.808
Now, I'm not opiates.

02:13:39.848 --> 02:13:41.809
I'm not saying that opium wasn't a thing.

02:13:42.330 --> 02:14:02.284
I'm just trying to understand how that became significant when the population of Britain was, I think, quite a bit smaller than China, that China is such a geographically large with such a different culture and a huge language and writing barrier that would make it very hard for an Englishman dressed in his finest

02:14:02.964 --> 02:14:06.769
outfit to show up on a shore and say, here, I've got opium to sell you.

02:14:07.169 --> 02:14:12.516
And it would be very easy, I think, for that country to say, we don't want any of your opium.

02:14:12.536 --> 02:14:18.283
And so I'm still having a hard time understanding whether that opium war is a

02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:40.092
is a bedtime story that they tell us with a very specific, you know, set of bad guys and good guys and outcomes, or whether that's just really what happened, that the British were so incredible at controlling the seven seas around the world that they were also, you know, engaged in an opium war at the same time that they were

02:14:40.652 --> 02:14:46.815
you know, extracting everything that they could from India and parts of Africa.

02:14:46.855 --> 02:14:49.096
And I'm just, I'm trying to get my head around that.

02:14:54.298 --> 02:14:55.459
but it was too late.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:22.481
I mean, for example, if the opioids, opiates could have been used against certain factions in China by certain other factions in China that were cooperating with these foreigners that were bringing it in, then you can imagine a scenario where previous families or previous dynasties or whatever you call them in China could have, could have essentially made bargains with these foreigners in order to work against each other.

02:15:23.413 --> 02:15:27.036
And so the opium war might not have been a war between Britain and China.

02:15:27.076 --> 02:15:31.240
It might've been Britain turning Chinese people against Chinese people.

02:15:34.063 --> 02:15:47.875
But I just don't understand how it is that somebody that's got boats and can only get to you by boats, but can't read your writing and can't speak your language can engage in an opium war on you.

02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:57.215
Today, Iran has reported over 180,000 cases and 9,000 deaths.

02:16:01.618 --> 02:16:02.899
Yeah, there was a lot of Americans.

02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:06.542
There were a lot of American families that were also shipping opium to China.

02:16:12.347 --> 02:16:14.769
Coronavirus should have been no surprise.

02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:20.252
I don't want to laugh at people, but come on.

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:25.975
He put on his best clothes and then he ended up dying in the street later?

02:16:26.075 --> 02:16:26.576
Like, really?

02:16:28.382 --> 02:16:35.546
In 2014, the deadly Ebola epidemic was a big wake-up call.

02:16:35.626 --> 02:16:36.826
Don't forget about Ebola.

02:16:36.926 --> 02:16:43.450
The Ebola is a virus that's shaped exactly like the virus-like particle that Sina Bavari and David Hohn patented.

02:16:43.970 --> 02:16:51.254
Exactly the same as the Ebola rod-like, you know, little worm-like thing.

02:16:51.334 --> 02:16:54.556
That's what the virus-like particle that David Hohn and

02:16:55.655 --> 02:16:57.976
And Sina Bavari patented does, it makes that.

02:16:58.056 --> 02:17:03.477
And then that's why it's so exciting, because it can hold a gigantic RNA molecule if it's that large.

02:17:03.517 --> 02:17:07.998
It's not just this little tiny circle, you know, it's like this long rod shaped thing.

02:17:08.758 --> 02:17:09.418
Health systems.

02:17:09.858 --> 02:17:11.739
Jeremy Konondyk led the U.S.

02:17:11.779 --> 02:17:13.159
government's effort to fight it.

02:17:13.819 --> 02:17:17.220
It was a monumental effort to bring that outbreak under control.

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:22.101
I think all of us who were involved in that effort looked back at that and said, wow,

02:17:22.819 --> 02:17:25.100
a truly airborne or droplet style.

02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:26.221
I mean, Pamela's right.

02:17:26.261 --> 02:17:29.202
We have people falling on the street all the time in New York city.

02:17:29.222 --> 02:17:38.587
And let's keep in mind that somebody with a glove and a small piece of car fentanyl could walk behind anyone on in front of a street camera and touch them lightly.

02:17:39.008 --> 02:17:41.729
And in a few minutes, expect them to drop on the street as well.

02:17:42.189 --> 02:17:47.472
So these are not videos that could not be created by lies or murder or both.

02:17:47.832 --> 02:17:50.654
A respiratory pandemic is going to be so much worse.

02:17:51.661 --> 02:17:52.862
and so much more difficult.

02:17:53.262 --> 02:17:54.664
And so this is the story, right?

02:17:55.324 --> 02:18:07.515
A flying Ebola would be the most dangerous thing ever, which is what Robert Malone and Peter Daszak and Tony Fauci and all of them have been talking about for a couple of decades.

02:18:09.997 --> 02:18:17.724
And so there was a real urgency in the final years of the Obama administration to begin laying more groundwork for that kind of a scenario.

02:18:18.956 --> 02:18:27.640
To address potential threats like this, the Obama White House organized a pandemic response team inside the National Security Council, the NSC.

02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:39.766
...an infrastructure, so that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up, five years from now or a decade from now, we've made the investment.

02:18:42.435 --> 02:18:49.679
But in 2018, after Trump tapped John Bolton to head the NSC, the pandemic response team was reorganized.

02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:51.600
Was that a funny handshake?

02:18:51.981 --> 02:18:53.261
Is that a normal handshake?

02:18:53.582 --> 02:18:54.282
I'm trying to think.

02:18:55.082 --> 02:18:56.383
Do I put my thumb there?

02:18:56.583 --> 02:18:57.324
I don't think I do.

02:18:58.364 --> 02:19:00.205
His thumb is coming backwards, you see?

02:19:01.046 --> 02:19:03.728
This thumb right here is coming backwards.

02:19:03.808 --> 02:19:04.628
It shouldn't be there.

02:19:04.668 --> 02:19:05.589
It should be right there.

02:19:05.689 --> 02:19:06.809
That's where his thumb would be.

02:19:06.849 --> 02:19:07.130
But look.

02:19:08.157 --> 02:19:11.522
his thumb is also down and it shouldn't be down.

02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:17.952
I don't want to be a shit, but that's not a normal handshake.

02:19:17.992 --> 02:19:24.554
That's what you call, that's one of those Freemason handshakes because his thumb should be right there.

02:19:25.075 --> 02:19:25.755
That's what you do.

02:19:25.795 --> 02:19:29.156
You put your hand out like this and your thumb is on the top of their hand.

02:19:29.756 --> 02:19:32.998
It's not, you don't shake somebody's hand and put your thumb over here.

02:19:33.078 --> 02:19:38.860
You shake your hand and you put it over, your thumbs interlock, but this is a thumb going like that.

02:19:39.653 --> 02:19:41.035
This is just annoying.

02:19:41.735 --> 02:19:47.142
It's just annoying because again, they, they put this right in front of you, just like they put in front of us.

02:19:47.222 --> 02:19:58.335
When that guy in Toronto stood in front of the, the COVID camera, and he put this symbol in his hand for like three seconds before he sat down.

02:20:01.087 --> 02:20:08.252
But in 2018, after Trump tapped John Bolton to head the NSC, the pandemic response team was reorganized.

02:20:08.712 --> 02:20:10.213
Its members were reassigned.

02:20:11.294 --> 02:20:13.475
Its leader, Admiral — Was it Quebec?

02:20:13.515 --> 02:20:14.576
Sorry, Jeff from Earth.

02:20:14.756 --> 02:20:15.777
I'm glad you remembered.

02:20:15.817 --> 02:20:17.718
It was somewhere, and I know I saw it.

02:20:17.738 --> 02:20:19.559
I've got a video of it somewhere in the archive.

02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:20.920
— Timothy Ziemer left.

02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:27.125
Bolton has maintained that he was simply streamlining bloated NSC operations.

02:20:28.032 --> 02:20:30.853
and that it did not hurt America's pandemic response.

02:20:32.074 --> 02:20:38.356
But last year, Stephen Morrison headed a bipartisan effort to address America's pandemic response capacity.

02:20:39.696 --> 02:20:46.619
His report, released in November 2019, recommended the pandemic response team be moved back to the White House.

02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:56.583
We live in an era in which we're seeing increasing rapidity and increasing velocity and increasing impacts

02:20:57.259 --> 02:20:59.420
of these new pathogens coming at us.

02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:04.242
This is the condition of our microbial universe today.

02:21:05.043 --> 02:21:07.284
SARS-like virus has now spread into Japan.

02:21:07.424 --> 02:21:09.765
More than 10,000 people died from H1N1.

02:21:11.385 --> 02:21:21.550
The idea that you would disband your capacity willfully at the White House, aware of the developments of the last two decades, which were convincingly

02:21:22.308 --> 02:21:28.673
that we needed to be prepared and far better prepared on a consistent and sustained and coherent basis.

02:21:29.153 --> 02:21:30.935
What's the explanation that would be given?

02:21:31.575 --> 02:21:33.837
Well, I can't speak for John Bolton.

02:21:34.838 --> 02:21:38.921
I presume that they wanted to see that responsibility moved over.

02:21:39.551 --> 02:21:43.573
out of the White House to the Secretary of HHS.

02:21:44.033 --> 02:21:48.455
I'm of the opinion that it's at the 33rd degree that masonry actually starts.

02:21:49.315 --> 02:21:53.677
So if you don't make it to 33rd degree, you're just like a Cub Scout that never made it to Eagle.

02:21:54.137 --> 02:21:58.299
And then once you make it to Eagle, they take you into another room and they tell you what's really going on.

02:21:59.019 --> 02:22:05.266
And so when you get to 33rd degree, that's the one where they've told you that, yeah, you have to choose a holy book or something like that.

02:22:05.306 --> 02:22:09.090
And you choose the book you swear on and then you and then you're 33rd degree.

02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:11.413
And then ever after that, I guess you just get to retire.

02:22:11.473 --> 02:22:11.913
No, no, no.

02:22:12.694 --> 02:22:19.601
That's that's the that's the level of commitment that's required for you to to make it to the highest levels of their network.

02:22:21.082 --> 02:22:27.226
And very few people that are below that are really usefully in on anything.

02:22:27.627 --> 02:22:28.387
That's what I think.

02:22:29.008 --> 02:22:29.808
Of course, I don't know.

02:22:31.269 --> 02:22:35.533
So what's wrong with that decision to move this capacity over to the HHS?

02:22:36.333 --> 02:22:42.178
The mistake there is to assume that the secretary of HHS is able to

02:22:43.507 --> 02:22:49.111
see the full picture and be able to command the different elements of our government to respond in a coordinated.

02:22:49.571 --> 02:22:56.416
So he's actually telling you that it's the HHS that's gonna command and coordinate the response of all these parts of the government.

02:22:56.776 --> 02:22:59.318
Is he talking about the 17 intelligence agencies?

02:22:59.358 --> 02:23:07.743
Is he talking about DITRA and DOD and DARPA and BARDA and the State Department and CBERN and all these things?

02:23:07.763 --> 02:23:08.744
Because I think he is.

02:23:09.895 --> 02:23:16.364
And so here you go again with Sasha Latupova, the mom of Soph, telling us it's the DOD who released toxins.

02:23:21.348 --> 02:23:23.469
There's a little truth everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.

02:23:23.489 --> 02:23:25.650
There's a lot of truth on PBS NewsHour.

02:23:25.690 --> 02:23:43.440
It's just what they don't tell you and how they tell it to you, that you gotta have a sophisticated understanding of this timeline and know what was going on in the background with Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch, who were not speaking out in 2020 at all, but were trying to get on the gravy train of repurposed drugs.

02:23:45.669 --> 02:23:49.090
raising money to screen repurposed drugs.

02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:50.911
That's what they were doing in 2020.

02:23:52.251 --> 02:24:00.514
And Robert Malone was working closely with DITRA and DOD and used the pronoun we when talking about those entities.

02:24:03.427 --> 02:24:05.187
But of course he didn't say any of that until 2021.

02:24:06.047 --> 02:24:15.489
He was doing that behind the scenes now in 2020, when this video was released to your mom and dad, to my mom and dad, to my brother, to our neighbors.

02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:25.571
Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch were still trying to get on the gravy train and not speaking out at all.

02:24:25.991 --> 02:24:30.272
In a coherent and integrated way, that can only happen

02:24:31.538 --> 02:24:33.740
through an empowered entity at the White House.

02:24:35.561 --> 02:24:41.605
So by definition, we set ourselves up for a slow and sluggish response.

02:24:42.606 --> 02:24:45.428
A slow, sluggish and halting response.

02:24:47.185 --> 02:24:48.605
Because it was in the White House?

02:24:48.866 --> 02:24:49.546
Interesting.

02:24:50.086 --> 02:24:51.606
So it shouldn't have been in the White House.

02:24:51.646 --> 02:24:57.848
They gave it to the White House, and then because they gave it to the White House, we had this really slow, sluggish response.

02:24:57.868 --> 02:24:58.489
So there you go.

02:24:58.729 --> 02:25:00.389
They're solving the mystery for you.

02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:01.590
Now you know why it happened.

02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:05.911
Shoulda never gave pandemic preparedness back to HHS.

02:25:07.392 --> 02:25:08.432
I think that's what he's saying.

02:25:16.001 --> 02:25:18.682
The virus was about to slam into Europe.

02:25:19.683 --> 02:25:22.044
Wow.

02:25:22.184 --> 02:25:23.384
Slam into Europe.

02:25:24.625 --> 02:25:30.307
On February 19th, a championship soccer match was set to kick off in Italy's largest stadium.

02:25:30.407 --> 02:25:36.049
February 19th, we're actually approaching Kevin McCairn's very first stream with Eddie Edds.

02:25:37.570 --> 02:25:38.190
Capacity, 75,000.

02:25:48.567 --> 02:25:52.329
The Atalanta team from Bergamo in Lombardy won the game.

02:25:56.170 --> 02:25:59.731
Afterwards, Bergamo became the epicenter of Italy's outbreak.

02:25:59.952 --> 02:26:02.112
And it was all because these people attended.

02:26:02.132 --> 02:26:04.153
Oh my God.

02:26:04.273 --> 02:26:05.014
Wow.

02:26:05.874 --> 02:26:08.995
Dr. Stefano Fagioli of Bergamo remembers.

02:26:09.655 --> 02:26:17.799
They had 10 colleagues from our hospital which went to see the game and 10 of them, they all got infected.

02:26:17.819 --> 02:26:18.039
Wow.

02:26:19.295 --> 02:26:24.459
When I spoke to Dr. Fagioli, he was quarantined at home after catching the virus himself.

02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:34.367
And it's interesting that the two main outbreaks in Spain are close to Madrid and Valencia, which was the other, the opponent team.

02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:42.053
In the beginning, Italy, like China and Iran, was slow to react.

02:26:44.155 --> 02:26:47.658
Dr. Marco Vergano is an anesthesiologist in Turin.

02:26:48.374 --> 02:26:55.156
We were conducting really the usual, a normal life, a social life, in the last week of February.

02:26:56.076 --> 02:27:04.598
And it's really difficult to implement social distancing measures when you don't have your hospitals already overwhelmed by patients.

02:27:06.858 --> 02:27:08.619
But they were losing valuable time.

02:27:10.079 --> 02:27:14.680
Flights were cut from China, but as in the U.S., Italy hesitated to do more.

02:27:16.175 --> 02:27:18.339
The job was left up to town mayors.

02:27:18.479 --> 02:27:23.267
Remember the town mayors running around telling people they were going to get a flamethrower, I think.

02:27:23.287 --> 02:27:24.950
I remember this.

02:27:28.712 --> 02:27:29.112
There he is!

02:27:29.132 --> 02:27:29.713
Flamethrower guy!

02:27:29.733 --> 02:27:37.561
This is the same, you know, kind of shit that they pulled in America when they put sand in the beachfront skate parks and stuff.

02:27:52.725 --> 02:27:55.186
they became viral on social media.

02:27:55.667 --> 02:27:56.747
Yes, again, here we go.

02:27:56.847 --> 02:27:58.428
Viral on social media.

02:27:58.528 --> 02:28:01.410
Viral on social media is a- Stop lying!

02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:02.530
It's a lie.

02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:03.691
They are programmed.

02:28:04.091 --> 02:28:05.672
They are put in front of everyone.

02:28:05.792 --> 02:28:09.074
They programmed it so that you would see people falling down in Wuhan.

02:28:09.094 --> 02:28:12.496
They programmed it so you would see the construction of the hospital.

02:28:12.536 --> 02:28:16.678
And they programmed it so you would think that Trump wasn't reacting the way that he should.

02:28:17.059 --> 02:28:21.261
And they programmed it so you would see these people in Italy doing more than Trump was doing.

02:28:22.125 --> 02:28:33.756
stop lying people i think realized quite soon that this was a way to protect them and protect others probably this happened maybe go home to your playstation

02:28:42.748 --> 02:28:43.869
than was necessary.

02:28:44.149 --> 02:28:50.973
Go home to your PlayStation so it can make more pictures of your face for facial recognition databases all around the world.

02:28:50.993 --> 02:28:51.933
Do you see it?

02:28:51.953 --> 02:29:08.043
What we know is that if you implement some real stringent social distancing measures at the beginning of the surge, and since this is an exponential surge, just maybe 24 or 48 hours earlier is enough to avoid more than 30 or 40 percent

02:29:12.409 --> 02:29:14.010
of the number of infected people.

02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:22.714
That is an amazing statement that this RNA could have been avoided if we had just taken action 24 hours or 48 hours earlier.

02:29:23.134 --> 02:29:26.375
We could avoid 40% or more of the people getting.

02:29:26.795 --> 02:29:35.839
That is an extraordinary claim of understanding, extraordinary claim of certainty as if this is just a very simple system to understand.

02:29:35.899 --> 02:29:39.461
And the math is really simple because exponential is exponential.

02:29:40.472 --> 02:29:42.334
Holy shit, can you see it?

02:29:42.874 --> 02:29:43.735
Three weeks later.

02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:53.323
The closing of flights from China had done little to stem the spread.

02:29:54.624 --> 02:29:59.849
In January, the government of Italy was celebrating a new initiative to increase Chinese tourism.

02:30:02.738 --> 02:30:06.421
Emergency power has been extended to the flu pandemic right now already.

02:30:06.461 --> 02:30:10.545
We're already in an emergency based on flu, not COVID, just in case you're unaware.

02:30:10.786 --> 02:30:14.569
Tourists from Wuhan arrived in Milan on January 23rd.

02:30:16.411 --> 02:30:18.413
They tested positive a week later.

02:30:20.635 --> 02:30:22.297
The virus was already here.

02:30:24.366 --> 02:30:29.276
Italy's surge in cases now marks the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside of Asia.

02:30:29.296 --> 02:30:32.583
The death toll leaping by more than 50% in one day.

02:30:32.603 --> 02:30:34.647
Italy is the hardest hit country in

02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:36.760
That wasn't a person.

02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:37.361
That was not a person.

02:30:37.401 --> 02:30:37.901
Look at this.

02:30:37.921 --> 02:30:38.941
Look at that head move.

02:30:39.001 --> 02:30:39.741
That's not a real person.

02:30:39.781 --> 02:30:40.662
That head's moving funny.

02:30:40.682 --> 02:30:41.962
I don't think that was a real person.

02:30:41.982 --> 02:30:42.442
It doesn't matter.

02:30:42.462 --> 02:30:44.703
Was there a moment in time when this really seized your attention?

02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:12.292
In my case, personally, it was that Skype call from the task force in Lombardia from this friend of mine.

02:31:13.313 --> 02:31:18.855
He told me I have seen scenes in hospitals that I will never forget in my whole life.

02:31:21.256 --> 02:31:30.199
He described hospitals with people in hallways and people dying outside of hospitals because even

02:31:31.401 --> 02:31:33.602
There were not enough ambulances.

02:31:34.442 --> 02:31:38.483
So keep in mind all these people were not tested, all these people were not sequenced.

02:31:38.563 --> 02:31:44.904
So when I say that they could have used a clone to do it, you don't need a clone to do this because again, they're not sequencing everybody.

02:31:44.944 --> 02:31:50.226
So there's no molecular biological illusion to what happened in Bergamo.

02:31:50.246 --> 02:31:50.746
There's none.

02:31:51.186 --> 02:31:52.166
Just be aware of that.

02:31:52.246 --> 02:31:54.607
The molecular biological illusion comes later.

02:31:55.347 --> 02:31:59.070
This is just an illusion about protocols and deaths and what's causing it.

02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:10.777
And we don't know if it has to do with the exceptional vaccine coverage that they covered in this part of Italy for the first two years prior to the pandemic that we know was done by the military.

02:32:10.797 --> 02:32:11.798
We know that for sure.

02:32:12.799 --> 02:32:15.901
And so we have no idea, for example, if these people weren't primed.

02:32:16.752 --> 02:32:23.236
You know, it could be one of these things that we're supposed to not ever talk about, you know, like graphene or 5G.

02:32:23.957 --> 02:32:26.138
In Italy, it could have been something completely different.

02:32:26.158 --> 02:32:36.124
And maybe in Italy, it was graphene and the turning on of 5G after these people had been implanted with the receiver in a pneumonia vaccine from the year previously.

02:32:36.164 --> 02:32:45.030
Of course, that's an outlandishly science fiction story that I do not offer you as the most parsimonious explanation.

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:55.262
But I want to offer it to you as a much more plausible explanation than the idea that a particular RNA molecule is responsible for this.

02:32:56.343 --> 02:33:01.926
Unless it's an RNA molecule that we ourselves made and made enough of so that it would do it.

02:33:02.267 --> 02:33:03.848
Hospitals in Italy's north were overwhelmed.

02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:16.042
There were not enough beds, let alone ventilators.

02:33:16.722 --> 02:33:20.124
And so a lot of people got on supplementary oxygen, right?

02:33:20.725 --> 02:33:26.168
Because they were running out of ventilators and supplementary oxygen causes the progression to ARDS.

02:33:26.668 --> 02:33:33.753
And do not forget this because this could also have been happening in these people that are in the hallways when they don't have a ventilator.

02:33:33.773 --> 02:33:35.714
Hospitals in Italy's north were overwhelmed.

02:33:37.895 --> 02:33:39.016
There were not enough beds.

02:33:39.216 --> 02:33:40.057
Look at that dude.

02:33:41.017 --> 02:33:41.858
Look at that dude.

02:33:43.263 --> 02:33:44.704
Look at this dude in the bubble.

02:33:45.345 --> 02:33:47.887
Hospitals in Italy's north were overwhelmed.

02:33:48.748 --> 02:33:50.870
Is he on full oxygen in that bubble?

02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:54.413
Because if he's on pure oxygen in that bubble, he's going to develop ARDS.

02:33:54.793 --> 02:33:56.414
There's another bubble right back there.

02:33:56.434 --> 02:33:59.317
Oh my gosh.

02:33:59.377 --> 02:34:06.523
If they are on high flow oxygen in those fricking bubbles, then they're going to develop ARDS and need a ventilator.

02:34:09.932 --> 02:34:12.394
I'm sorry, but that is a really bad picture right there.

02:34:12.454 --> 02:34:13.935
It's a really bad picture.

02:34:14.756 --> 02:34:16.297
That is, oh, there's another one.

02:34:16.758 --> 02:34:19.180
Look at the head on bubble headed.

02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:21.181
Holy shit.

02:34:22.062 --> 02:34:24.064
That is not a ventilator, ladies and gentlemen.

02:34:24.084 --> 02:34:25.745
That is supplementary oxygen.

02:34:26.306 --> 02:34:28.447
Not enough beds, let alone ventilator.

02:34:28.608 --> 02:34:29.028
Oxygen.

02:34:29.068 --> 02:34:32.791
Look, there's a line right there around his head and it's going right down here.

02:34:33.151 --> 02:34:35.153
That person's on supplementary oxygen.

02:34:35.193 --> 02:34:35.693
Do you see it?

02:34:37.787 --> 02:34:48.145
in a condition with a severe shortage of resources and maybe you have 10 people in need of a ventilator and only one or two ventilators available.

02:34:48.797 --> 02:34:54.099
and they need to be used by younger people that have a greater chance of survival, right?

02:34:54.759 --> 02:34:59.461
And they're using ventilators on the younger people because the old people are already lost.

02:35:00.262 --> 02:35:03.623
And the crazy part is, is that that's not what the Italian said.

02:35:04.083 --> 02:35:07.825
That's what the PBS NewsHour guy asked him to confirm.

02:35:08.425 --> 02:35:09.165
Stop lying!

02:35:10.046 --> 02:35:10.806
Think about that.

02:35:11.326 --> 02:35:12.687
Stop lying!

02:35:12.967 --> 02:35:13.807
Think about that.

02:35:13.827 --> 02:35:18.449
Need of a ventilator and only one or two ventilators available.

02:35:19.108 --> 02:35:24.392
and they need to be used by younger people that have a greater chance of survival, right?

02:35:24.932 --> 02:35:26.914
Yeah.

02:35:26.954 --> 02:35:28.215
Wow.

02:35:29.135 --> 02:35:30.736
You're damn right it's murder.

02:35:31.837 --> 02:35:33.118
You're damn right it's murder.

02:35:33.178 --> 02:35:37.061
Those bubble heads that we just saw are evidence for me that it was murder.

02:35:37.361 --> 02:35:39.162
Lockdown until March 9th.

02:35:44.206 --> 02:35:46.147
To date, over 34,000 Italians have died of COVID-19.

02:35:56.249 --> 02:36:04.878
Seeing what was happening around the world, top American public health officials were increasingly convinced that halting flights from China was not enough.

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.447
I think most health officials agree that, at best, it delays and, as the secretary says, kind of pauses things.

02:36:12.807 --> 02:36:17.492
Dr. Fauci and two other officials planned to confront the president on February 26.

02:36:18.863 --> 02:36:23.125
a broad pandemic throughout the world, travel restrictions are not going to help.

02:36:23.165 --> 02:36:25.106
You can't just travel restrict everyone.

02:36:25.126 --> 02:36:36.751
The public health officials, Redfield, Anthony Fauci at the NIH, Stephen Hahn at FDA, they had all decided that was going to be the day they were going to tell the president, hey, look, we need to be more aggressive here.

02:36:38.252 --> 02:36:44.435
But before they could do that, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, spoke out publicly.

02:36:45.578 --> 02:36:49.740
Tonight, the CDC is calling the coronavirus a tremendous health threat.

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:57.504
We are working to ready our public health workforce to respond to local cases and the possibility this outbreak could become a pandemic.

02:36:57.824 --> 02:36:59.305
It was a dire warning.

02:36:59.605 --> 02:37:04.548
The virus has killed more than 2,200 people and infected nearly 77,000 worldwide.

02:37:05.869 --> 02:37:07.970
The president was on his way to India.

02:37:09.150 --> 02:37:10.231
There, he was reassuring.

02:37:13.126 --> 02:37:19.477
You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country.

02:37:20.258 --> 02:37:23.163
We have very few people with it.

02:37:23.919 --> 02:37:27.881
But as he prepared to return home, Messonnier spoke to reporters.

02:37:28.001 --> 02:37:36.905
Don't forget that he also interviewed with none other than Sherry Markinson in Australia that we showed a couple days ago, where he also made the same claim.

02:37:37.605 --> 02:37:37.886
Again.

02:37:38.426 --> 02:37:40.347
And also said that it's likely from a lab leak.

02:37:41.027 --> 02:37:50.591
He didn't say that to America on American TV, but he did say it to Australians on Australian TV, and then now only recently are we allowed to see that Sky News did that.

02:37:50.611 --> 02:37:50.892
You see?

02:37:51.872 --> 02:37:54.955
We expect we will see community spread in this country.

02:37:55.316 --> 02:38:05.426
It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.

02:38:05.767 --> 02:38:10.071
Federal health officials said today the coronavirus will certainly begin spreading.

02:38:10.091 --> 02:38:12.274
It is not a question of if, but when.

02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:21.176
Now remember a couple months or a couple weeks earlier, we were still arguing about whether human human to transmission had started and when did China know it?

02:38:21.636 --> 02:38:23.978
And if they told us earlier, could we have stopped it?

02:38:24.358 --> 02:38:31.724
And now we're talking about a couple days of a window in Italy where we could have stopped it and prevented 40% of the cases.

02:38:32.104 --> 02:38:34.025
But in America, it's...

02:38:37.282 --> 02:38:44.714
It is the narrative, the theater that they wanted our family and friends to participate in so that we would teach our children this mythology.

02:38:45.695 --> 02:38:46.657
And we're not going to do it.

02:38:47.438 --> 02:38:50.323
As Nancy Messonnier is giving this briefing to reporters,

02:38:50.998 --> 02:38:55.000
The president is just getting on Air Force One in India to fly home.

02:38:55.741 --> 02:39:00.283
So as he's flying home, the stock market crashes 1,000 points.

02:39:00.303 --> 02:39:05.366
Wall Street continues to sell on those coronavirus fears, the Dow falling close to 900 points today.

02:39:05.466 --> 02:39:10.549
TV is broadcasting nonstop about how this is going to change the way Americans live.

02:39:10.649 --> 02:39:13.651
And of course, the president hadn't been briefed on any of this.

02:39:14.525 --> 02:39:21.069
So, by the time Air Force One lands Wednesday morning on the 26th, he's fuming, he's angry.

02:39:21.610 --> 02:39:26.893
The big economic success that he's constantly touting is under assault from his viewpoint.

02:39:27.854 --> 02:39:33.037
He picks up the phone and calls Azar, yells at Azar, says, you're scaring people to death here.

02:39:33.097 --> 02:39:33.878
What's going on?

02:39:34.298 --> 02:39:40.042
But the big consequence of that is that the briefing that the

02:39:45.802 --> 02:39:52.343
public health officials had intended to do for Trump that evening after he'd returned, that briefing never happens.

02:39:54.323 --> 02:39:59.244
Yeah, if those bubble heads are oxygen-tense, then they had them on high-flow oxygen and they were causing ARDS.

02:39:59.284 --> 02:40:00.144
It's easy to see it.

02:40:00.465 --> 02:40:04.185
Angry with his public health advisors, Trump refused to meet with them.

02:40:05.505 --> 02:40:11.146
Talk of more aggressive measures such as stay-at-home orders and strict social distancing was put off.

02:40:12.727 --> 02:40:14.667
Messonnier's warnings were heresy.

02:40:15.799 --> 02:40:22.965
They then, the next day, dedicated an entire presidential press conference to walking back the warning and the assessment that she had given.

02:40:22.985 --> 02:40:24.847
Thank you very much, everybody.

02:40:24.887 --> 02:40:25.527
Thank you very much.

02:40:25.768 --> 02:40:29.050
And with the benefit of a month's hindsight, she was 100% right.

02:40:29.251 --> 02:40:31.593
She accurately anticipated what was about to happen.

02:40:32.273 --> 02:40:34.335
She tried to warn the country of that.

02:40:34.655 --> 02:40:37.298
Center for Global Development.

02:40:37.338 --> 02:40:37.898
Thanks, buddy.

02:40:38.058 --> 02:40:40.520
The White House tried to furiously walk it back.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:43.343
Did you see the book that was on the shelf behind him?

02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:44.331
Right.

02:40:44.531 --> 02:40:48.053
She accurately anticipated lessons for the next pandemic with Ebola.

02:40:48.093 --> 02:40:53.236
I mean, come on, all these people, all of them, all of them did what was about to happen.

02:40:53.916 --> 02:40:55.957
She tried to warn the country of that.

02:40:56.737 --> 02:40:59.959
And the White House tried to furiously walk it back.

02:41:01.138 --> 02:41:08.342
The CDC said yesterday that they believe it's inevitable that the virus will spread in the United States, and it's not a question of if but when.

02:41:08.762 --> 02:41:10.063
Do you agree with that assessment?

02:41:10.183 --> 02:41:12.004
Well, I don't think it's inevitable.

02:41:12.024 --> 02:41:13.384
It probably will.

02:41:13.445 --> 02:41:14.285
It possibly will.

02:41:14.885 --> 02:41:17.587
It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level.

02:41:18.427 --> 02:41:20.028
Whatever happens, we're totally prepared.

02:41:20.208 --> 02:41:21.489
We have the best people in the world.

02:41:21.749 --> 02:41:30.013
As someone who served in government, I can tell you that kind of behavior sends a very, very clear signal to government workers about what is and is not permissible to say.

02:41:30.535 --> 02:41:35.496
It's interesting that it's very much like what happened in China in late December and early January.

02:41:36.136 --> 02:41:38.357
The parallels are very striking.

02:41:38.637 --> 02:41:47.039
I think it's immensely irresponsible of people in this administration to be blaming China for that kind of behavior, even as they have engaged in it themselves.

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:51.840
Dr. Nancy Messonnier would be sidelined.

02:41:53.121 --> 02:41:55.881
Alex Azar was removed as head of the task force.

02:41:56.401 --> 02:41:58.742
He was replaced by Vice President Pence.

02:42:00.268 --> 02:42:03.589
Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me.

02:42:04.669 --> 02:42:06.249
Mike Pence and Jared Kushner.

02:42:06.489 --> 02:42:10.990
He's got a certain talent for this, and I'm going to ask Mike Pence to say a few words, please.

02:42:11.210 --> 02:42:11.730
Thank you, Mike.

02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:15.151
What talent Vice President Pence was bringing was not clear.

02:42:16.771 --> 02:42:17.511
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:42:18.191 --> 02:42:22.252
When he was governor of Indiana, he had slashed the state's public health budget.

02:42:23.612 --> 02:42:27.553
As a staunch evangelical Christian, he had questioned scientific advice.

02:42:30.638 --> 02:42:39.832
So, not in the least, when this was mentioned to me, I was delighted that I get to have the Vice President helping in this way.

02:42:39.972 --> 02:42:40.393
Delighted.

02:42:40.953 --> 02:42:41.434
Absolutely.

02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:49.223
The daily press briefings became a platform for the president's positive messaging.

02:42:49.604 --> 02:42:58.390
You are hearing the line that the risk for Americans is low, which comes from everybody's mouth, from the president on down.

02:42:58.410 --> 02:43:01.872
Mr. President, how should Americans prepare for this virus?

02:43:01.892 --> 02:43:04.654
Should they go on with their daily lives, change their routine?

02:43:05.014 --> 02:43:06.175
What should what should they do?

02:43:06.255 --> 02:43:07.956
Well, I hope they don't change their routine.

02:43:07.976 --> 02:43:11.038
But maybe, Anthony, I'll let you I'll let you answer that.

02:43:11.118 --> 02:43:12.199
Or Bob, do you want to answer?

02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:13.380
Thank you.

02:43:13.911 --> 02:43:17.973
I think it's really important that, as I said, the risk at this time is low.

02:43:17.993 --> 02:43:20.875
The American public needs to go on with their normal lives.

02:43:21.595 --> 02:43:25.657
You said, February 29th, the risk at this time is low.

02:43:25.977 --> 02:43:29.339
The American public needs to go on with their normal lives.

02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:31.280
It was true at that time, Martin.

02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:32.781
I think the risk was low.

02:43:33.001 --> 02:43:34.042
But by this time...

02:43:34.482 --> 02:43:34.842
What?!

02:43:35.803 --> 02:43:40.025
We just heard somebody from Italy say that it's on down to a 24-hour or 48-hour window.

02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:54.654
We just heard an hour long program telling us how we missed the three weeks where we knew something was happening in China and countries like Korea took action and we didn't.

02:43:56.670 --> 02:44:00.513
The narrative is changing even in this documentary for shit's sake.

02:44:01.193 --> 02:44:02.614
China had had an outbreak.

02:44:03.615 --> 02:44:07.457
Iran was in the midst of a major outbreak, as was Italy.

02:44:07.677 --> 02:44:10.519
And you're saying at this time the risk is low.

02:44:10.779 --> 02:44:13.781
Yeah, well the risk was low to the general American public at the time.

02:44:14.162 --> 02:44:23.628
But the fact is that we had stumbled in February to test adequately, to test enough people to know where things were going.

02:44:23.848 --> 02:44:26.530
How can you say that when we had such inadequate testing?

02:44:27.311 --> 02:44:34.521
Well, the purpose, I'm sure, of your documentary is to help identify lessons and correct them so we don't repeat this.

02:44:35.182 --> 02:44:36.544
Many of us are in the arena.

02:44:36.964 --> 02:44:41.651
I'm sure your documentary is to document the mistakes we made so that we don't repeat them.

02:44:42.245 --> 02:44:43.126
Stop lying!

02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:45.487
Gee whiz, why don't you just say it out loud?

02:44:45.587 --> 02:44:49.189
We're, as Teddy Roosevelt would say, we're marred and bloodied.

02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:53.052
Uh, we're trying to dare greatly.

02:44:53.472 --> 02:44:56.914
Hopefully, at best, we'll know the triumph of high achievement.

02:44:57.995 --> 02:45:01.237
And, you know, at worst, we'll fail by daring greatly.

02:45:05.539 --> 02:45:09.522
Throughout February, the president had continued to hold his rallies.

02:45:09.842 --> 02:45:10.563
Hello, Phoenix.

02:45:11.966 --> 02:45:13.267
Hello, Las Vegas.

02:45:13.467 --> 02:45:14.567
Great to be with you.

02:45:14.908 --> 02:45:20.170
Where else would you like to be but a Trump rally, right?

02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:25.173
Fortunately, only a Biogen event in Boston was a super-spreader event.

02:45:25.373 --> 02:45:29.595
Fortunately, only a Christian gathering in Korea was a super-spreader event.

02:45:30.115 --> 02:45:32.316
None of Trump rallies were super-spreader events.

02:45:32.496 --> 02:45:38.839
Neither were the seven months of protests on the streets for George Floyd super-spreader events.

02:45:38.899 --> 02:45:39.740
Just keep that in mind.

02:45:41.789 --> 02:45:44.230
He blamed others for exaggerating the threat.

02:45:44.910 --> 02:45:50.851
Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus.

02:45:50.991 --> 02:45:51.751
You know that, right?

02:45:51.951 --> 02:45:52.692
Coronavirus.

02:45:53.312 --> 02:45:54.732
They're politicizing it.

02:45:55.232 --> 02:45:56.532
And this is their new hoax.

02:45:56.592 --> 02:46:01.273
The president would not call for social distancing for another two and a half weeks.

02:46:02.054 --> 02:46:07.535
We have leaders throughout much of January and February saying that this is a hoax.

02:46:08.434 --> 02:46:12.695
35,000 people on average die each year from the flu.

02:46:12.735 --> 02:46:13.796
Did anyone know that?

02:46:13.976 --> 02:46:13.796
35,000.

02:46:14.296 --> 02:46:21.238
And so far, we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States.

02:46:22.018 --> 02:46:23.599
And they shake their head, no, we didn't know that.

02:46:23.659 --> 02:46:25.519
Those are all imaginary numbers, right?

02:46:25.539 --> 02:46:26.980
Those aren't real tested numbers.

02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:29.000
Those are projected numbers by the CDC.

02:46:29.481 --> 02:46:34.922
What he should have said was, is that between 50 and 65,000 Americans die every week in total.

02:46:36.843 --> 02:46:37.283
Every week.

02:46:38.283 --> 02:46:38.843
All the time.

02:46:38.863 --> 02:46:50.945
It's a complete denial of science and leading to all sorts of decisions that are harmful to our country, to our planet.

02:46:51.405 --> 02:46:52.685
You're quoting the president.

02:46:52.765 --> 02:46:53.806
He made these comments.

02:46:54.346 --> 02:47:00.207
Is it your view that he knew Frontline documentary from 2020 in August better than that?

02:47:01.467 --> 02:47:04.647
Or was he simply misinformed?

02:47:05.408 --> 02:47:07.548
I cannot psychoanalyze the president.

02:47:08.112 --> 02:47:13.594
But we know that he has a tendency to believe he's the best at everything.

02:47:14.054 --> 02:47:16.395
He probably thinks he's better than the scientists.

02:47:16.995 --> 02:47:20.336
And you wonder the press is in hysteria mode.

02:47:20.736 --> 02:47:22.657
Fake news and the camera just went off.

02:47:25.938 --> 02:47:33.180
I think if he were practicing medicine, he would be negligent and he would be prosecuted.

02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:42.862
The president's behavior, the president's resort to repeated falsehoods is a function of the way he is approaching this crisis.

02:47:43.322 --> 02:47:51.365
He's approaching this crisis about how it affects his own political survivability and re-electability.

02:47:52.585 --> 02:47:55.306
This is a list of the different countries.

02:47:55.426 --> 02:47:58.967
United States is rated number one, most prepared.

02:47:59.407 --> 02:48:02.928
I would equate it to something like seeing a hurricane offshore

02:48:03.695 --> 02:48:21.006
that has just taken out a couple of Caribbean islands and is strengthening to Category 5 as it heads for Florida, and not bothering to tell people to get off the beach and board their windows, and only starting to do that when you see the storm surge coming ashore, by which point it's, of course, far too late.

02:48:23.087 --> 02:48:23.768
Unbelievable.

02:48:24.741 --> 02:48:29.524
the kinds of lies they were telling, the commitment, spectacular commitment to lies.

02:48:29.544 --> 02:48:34.568
The first COVID-19 death to be recognized in America was on February 29th, near Seattle.

02:48:34.868 --> 02:48:36.309
So whom is county, Matt?

02:48:36.929 --> 02:48:40.031
It was followed by a cluster of cases in a nursing home.

02:48:41.032 --> 02:48:43.694
But the big bomb would land on New York City.

02:48:46.448 --> 02:48:58.317
From the suburb of New Rochelle, 20 miles north of the city, an estate lawyer commuted daily by train into his office in midtown Manhattan.

02:48:58.497 --> 02:49:00.879
In late February, he started feeling sick.

02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:08.145
On February 27th, he checked himself into a New York Presbyterian hospital in Bronxville, New York.

02:49:10.293 --> 02:49:13.399
Lawrence Garbus tested positive on March 2nd.

02:49:13.519 --> 02:49:17.446
The man in his 50s lives in Westchester, but works in Manhattan.

02:49:17.486 --> 02:49:20.270
New York City Health Department says he is in severe condition.

02:49:20.611 --> 02:49:22.735
Now the entire family in quarantine.

02:49:23.154 --> 02:49:27.375
For Dr. Griffin, who had been seeing patients- Dr. Griffin again!

02:49:27.535 --> 02:49:31.756
Since mid-February, the Garbus case confirmed what he had suspected all along.

02:49:31.776 --> 02:49:33.236
With his stupid bow tie on.

02:49:33.276 --> 02:49:38.858
This gentleman had not traveled, so he had obviously acquired it in the New York area.

02:49:39.558 --> 02:49:40.078
Obviously.

02:49:40.518 --> 02:49:43.479
Dr. Griffin had been pressing for more testing for weeks.

02:49:44.579 --> 02:49:51.881
But because of a lack of testing capacity, he says the CDC told him he could only test Garbus's immediate contacts.

02:49:53.803 --> 02:50:00.650
The subway has daily ridership of approximately 3.2 million people and the buses have a daily ridership of 1.4.

02:50:00.810 --> 02:50:02.752
Yeah, okay.

02:50:04.474 --> 02:50:08.739
Our impression at this point in the end of February, beginning of March,

02:50:09.059 --> 02:50:14.264
is that we already had community transmission of COVID-19.

02:50:14.644 --> 02:50:16.266
Oh, now it's not human to human anymore.

02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:17.827
Now it's community transmission.

02:50:17.847 --> 02:50:27.917
So we're graduating up this hypothetically, it's a mythological ladder of understanding and a ladder of zoonosis.

02:50:27.997 --> 02:50:28.738
It's hilarious.

02:50:28.938 --> 02:50:29.799
In the New York area.

02:50:30.359 --> 02:50:30.939
Community.

02:50:31.099 --> 02:50:34.441
But you're only letting us test people that have had contact with this man.

02:50:34.962 --> 02:50:36.983
We don't think he got it in New Rochelle.

02:50:37.463 --> 02:50:40.284
We suspect he got it commuting to and from the city.

02:50:40.885 --> 02:50:46.828
We would like to start testing all these people with respiratory symptoms that we don't have a diagnosis for.

02:50:47.428 --> 02:50:48.389
What's their response?

02:50:48.869 --> 02:50:50.830
We still have our rigid criteria.

02:50:51.509 --> 02:50:54.112
Unless someone is really severely ill.

02:50:54.513 --> 02:50:59.138
They need to have a direct contact or a travel history And what's your response to them?

02:50:59.719 --> 02:51:10.010
Our response is we think this gentleman got it in the community and so now the argument is and the show the theater that we are being told is that Griffin here

02:51:10.891 --> 02:51:13.592
unlike the rest of his colleagues was taking it seriously.

02:51:14.132 --> 02:51:18.514
Griffin here wanted to go harder than the rest of his colleagues did.

02:51:18.874 --> 02:51:26.698
And it seems like the rest of his colleagues were listening to the White House and didn't take it very seriously because Donald Trump didn't take it very seriously.

02:51:27.098 --> 02:51:34.221
But thank goodness we have this guy who's been on the web every day and every week since with Vincent Racaniello.

02:51:34.561 --> 02:51:38.583
We think there's community spread and we would like to do broader testing.

02:51:39.059 --> 02:51:40.060
But you're not allowed to?

02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:41.280
We're not allowed to.

02:51:43.801 --> 02:51:50.364
We would really like to swab everybody in New York City on a daily basis as they get on the subway, but we're not allowed to.

02:51:54.586 --> 02:51:58.568
Jessica Caro is a nurse who works at a New York Presbyterian clinic.

02:52:00.508 --> 02:52:08.392
We first heard the news of the lawyer from New Rochelle getting sick, and that scared me because I live, like, maybe a 10-minute drive away from there.

02:52:10.225 --> 02:52:18.827
And if one of these RNA molecules gets on your skin or in your eye mucosa or in your throat, it could be game over.

02:52:19.167 --> 02:52:23.288
I mean, Li Min Yan told us that, you know, everybody could die.

02:52:23.328 --> 02:52:24.868
The whole planet is in danger.

02:52:24.888 --> 02:52:29.769
It could be 8 billion people dead and the vaccine won't help you.

02:52:30.009 --> 02:52:35.571
This is August, exactly when she is on Fox News telling everybody that.

02:52:37.662 --> 02:52:44.184
She was complaining to me that she had a fever and, you know, nurse mom was just, like, throwing her some Motrin and saying, you know, you'll be fine, you'll be fine.

02:52:44.964 --> 02:52:50.926
And I finally got a thermometer on her when I almost dropped it because it was 105, not 100.5, it was 105.

02:52:52.446 --> 02:52:56.668
Wanting to get her daughter tested, Jessica called New York's COVID hotline.

02:52:57.188 --> 02:53:00.049
Thank you for calling the New York State COVID-19 hotline.

02:53:00.309 --> 02:53:03.790
Eventually, she got a live person on the line, but it didn't help.

02:53:05.049 --> 02:53:07.431
This man was like, has your daughter traveled to China?

02:53:07.451 --> 02:53:08.252
And I'm like, no.

02:53:08.793 --> 02:53:10.895
He's like, well, has she had contact with somebody that's positive?

02:53:10.935 --> 02:53:11.936
I'm like, well, we don't know.

02:53:11.956 --> 02:53:14.778
And the last question was, is she short of breath?

02:53:14.878 --> 02:53:17.000
And I'm like, well, not currently, but she's very sick.

02:53:17.661 --> 02:53:20.804
And the man tells me, well, if she's not short of breath, she doesn't qualify.

02:53:20.824 --> 02:53:29.092
I remember hanging up the phone and just like this, I could feel the heat coming off of me, just how angry I was.

02:53:31.542 --> 02:53:35.126
I'm really erring on the side right now thinking that they transfected people.

02:53:35.727 --> 02:53:41.693
And so they released a quantity, and they knew how much they released, and they watched how it worked.

02:53:42.094 --> 02:53:46.599
They released a quantity in Iran and in Italy, and they watched how it worked.

02:53:47.039 --> 02:53:47.740
That's what I think.

02:53:48.141 --> 02:53:50.443
And they watched how long the signal would be detectable.

02:53:51.744 --> 02:53:54.045
because they're trying to learn about this background.

02:53:54.085 --> 02:53:57.026
They're trying to learn if they can manipulate it and use it against us.

02:53:57.547 --> 02:54:12.233
And the other, even more parsimonious explanation would be that they characterized the background for the last 10 years, and then they rolled out PCR and sequencing with an illusion that it was evidence of spread, when in reality there was no spread, nothing spreading.

02:54:12.673 --> 02:54:20.056
This was them testing for a background signal that they were, you know, using media and social media illusions of consensus

02:54:20.596 --> 02:54:26.958
created by PBS NewsHour and people like Griffin to make doctors think that there was something real happening when there wasn't.

02:54:27.579 --> 02:54:38.303
Remember, Lee Min Yan even told us that natural immunity wouldn't work, just like Rochelle Walensky and a lot of these others asked us in a Lancet paper in October of 2021.

02:54:38.643 --> 02:54:43.945
There was a shortage of tests across America.

02:54:45.385 --> 02:54:50.007
Dr. Susan Butler-Wu runs a clinical microbiology lab in Los Angeles.

02:54:50.967 --> 02:54:58.629
testing was very restricted, you have to get approval from your local public health authority in order to be able to do that testing.

02:54:58.669 --> 02:55:02.130
And they then had to coordinate with the CDC to get approval to do the testing.

02:55:02.551 --> 02:55:04.851
So, it was a very arduous process.

02:55:06.792 --> 02:55:10.973
Because of shortages, the CDC limited who qualified for a test.

02:55:12.074 --> 02:55:16.975
At one point, testing was limited to people coming in from mainland China.

02:55:17.795 --> 02:55:19.696
But viruses don't respect borders.

02:55:19.776 --> 02:55:20.036
They don't

02:55:21.946 --> 02:55:26.088
According to Denny Rancor, they respect voters very well.

02:55:28.250 --> 02:55:29.090
Oops.

02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:31.071
Oops.

02:55:31.231 --> 02:55:36.234
I think we were always way behind because of that.

02:55:38.191 --> 02:55:49.764
It wasn't probably until later in January, February, that I really started to feel like even if the public health labs were able to offer this testing, it's just not sufficient.

02:55:49.824 --> 02:55:53.148
We're not going to be able to respond to something of this magnitude.

02:55:55.888 --> 02:55:59.031
I've talked to a number of doctors and they say, look, if I couldn't tell.

02:55:59.151 --> 02:56:09.700
Just keep in mind that it is Kissinger himself who purported to say that if we get people to accept vaccination, then, you know, we can do whatever we want.

02:56:11.195 --> 02:56:15.219
And so the COVID pandemic could be just to get our kids to accept it.

02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:30.135
And then when they want to do the next thing, when they want to take the next step, whether it is to screen people or to cull or whatever, then they can do it because they already have access to us via intramuscular injection.

02:56:30.956 --> 02:56:36.682
And an intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is, of course, dumb.

02:56:37.463 --> 02:56:46.131
And that's why part of the reason why everybody has to ignore me is because of that statement, because they need access before they can test transfection and transformation.

02:56:46.151 --> 02:56:48.994
And they would need access before they could sample you.

02:56:49.014 --> 02:56:52.297
And they would need access if they were really going to eventually depopulate us.

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:59.026
If they depopulated us on the first COVID shot, then it wouldn't have gotten full coverage, right?

02:56:59.186 --> 02:57:06.654
Instead, they used placebo batches to test a few versions of the transfection and make sure that most people thought it worked fine.

02:57:06.674 --> 02:57:07.555
I didn't feel a thing.

02:57:07.575 --> 02:57:13.661
I told them that my patient had been to China

02:57:14.642 --> 02:57:15.943
they couldn't get a test.

02:57:16.303 --> 02:57:20.725
Yeah, that's a decision that's made individually by each health department, how they wanted to do that.

02:57:21.265 --> 02:57:30.590
I will say that early on in January and February, the cases that were recognized in the United States were largely linked to Wuhan, China.

02:57:30.910 --> 02:57:35.472
And so those were the case criteria as this new epidemic happened.

02:57:35.832 --> 02:57:37.613
Wow, that is just impressive.

02:57:37.773 --> 02:57:44.737
So the case criteria, the case criteria is what caused us from seeing the depth and the breadth of the true crisis.

02:57:44.817 --> 02:57:51.241
...allowed for more people to get tests, but shortages persisted, though not for celebrities.

02:57:53.022 --> 02:57:56.524
...reports that Kevin Durant has been tested.

02:57:56.584 --> 02:57:58.205
Soothspiders got it right on the head.

02:57:58.245 --> 02:58:01.527
This is a long game and they cannot do it in one generation.

02:58:01.587 --> 02:58:02.568
It's a long game.

02:58:04.079 --> 02:58:06.121
positive for the coronavirus.

02:58:06.221 --> 02:58:13.328
On social media, criticism for celebrities who've been tested like Celine Dion, Heidi Klum, and reportedly Kris Jenner.

02:58:13.688 --> 02:58:15.670
Whatever it may be, I'm going to quarantine myself.

02:58:16.191 --> 02:58:27.442
How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while other- Oh no, now they're getting pissed because professional athletes get to test when they don't have symptoms, but normal people don't get to.

02:58:29.164 --> 02:58:35.330
It looks like they're protecting the celebrities on Hollywood sets better than they're protecting the average people on main street.

02:58:38.833 --> 02:58:39.654
Wow.

02:58:39.754 --> 02:58:42.316
That is a debate that we didn't need to get into.

02:58:42.396 --> 02:58:42.597
Huh?

02:58:43.397 --> 02:58:48.022
Pro athletes and celebs.

02:58:50.376 --> 02:58:57.841
have tests when they're not symptomatic, and that's not fair.

02:58:57.941 --> 02:59:00.722
That's like, oh my gosh, that's so classy.

02:59:03.607 --> 02:59:12.030
We see stars being able to be tested where people without means or without celebrity status are unable to get tested.

02:59:12.090 --> 02:59:12.471
Wow.

02:59:12.591 --> 02:59:13.611
Yeah, unfortunately.

02:59:14.391 --> 02:59:15.372
Wow.

02:59:15.392 --> 02:59:18.733
With regard to inequity in our society have really come out.

02:59:18.813 --> 02:59:21.154
Was that today's oxygen bottles?

02:59:21.274 --> 02:59:22.115
Oh my gosh.

02:59:22.915 --> 02:59:23.455
Yes.

02:59:25.056 --> 02:59:25.936
Oh my gosh.

02:59:26.536 --> 02:59:27.797
Look what you just saw.

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:28.577
Free reign.

02:59:29.297 --> 02:59:30.098
Nice catch.

02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:36.121
Oh my gosh, that is a gigantic catch.

02:59:37.281 --> 02:59:38.082
Look at that.

02:59:38.982 --> 02:59:41.263
There is no explanation for that.

02:59:42.383 --> 02:59:44.224
Oh my gosh, that is amazing.

02:59:45.324 --> 02:59:47.045
That is amazing.

02:59:47.345 --> 02:59:51.586
And while they show you the supplementary oxygen being brought in by these 2000 liter tanks,

03:00:00.589 --> 03:00:03.653
Because one of those tanks can hold like a whole gymnasium full of air.

03:00:04.174 --> 03:00:05.676
That's why you don't want one blowing up.

03:00:07.867 --> 03:00:13.089
Like that, those are great big amounts of pure oxygen produced.

03:00:13.249 --> 03:00:14.230
That's impressive.

03:00:15.170 --> 03:00:20.292
That's impressive.

03:00:20.532 --> 03:00:29.075
And so while they show us the high flow oxygen evidence, they also tell us that celebrities are taking all the tests when they don't even have symptoms.

03:00:29.115 --> 03:00:29.896
That's not fair.

03:00:33.397 --> 03:00:39.546
Yeah, unfortunately, a lot of issues with regard to inequity in our society have really come out.

03:00:40.207 --> 03:00:48.398
But I think that people get a little bit intolerant when it's actually affecting the health of them, their loved ones, their children, when they realize that

03:00:49.016 --> 03:00:54.679
you're concerned about your mother, she can't get tested, but a VIP can get tested.

03:00:54.960 --> 03:01:00.583
And I think that during a pandemic, there's something quite wrong with that occurring.

03:01:00.603 --> 03:01:01.583
Stop lying!

03:01:02.184 --> 03:01:03.885
Wow, that is gross.

03:01:04.405 --> 03:01:05.866
Certainly among all the major countries.

03:01:06.967 --> 03:01:11.709
By the end of the first week in March, there were 337 cases of COVID-19.

03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:13.671
Holy shit, I never even thought about that.

03:01:13.691 --> 03:01:15.712
Of course they could have put shit in the oxygen.

03:01:16.854 --> 03:01:17.594
Of course they could have.

03:01:17.875 --> 03:01:19.135
Nineteen in the U.S.

03:01:19.375 --> 03:01:20.616
and 17 deaths.

03:01:21.697 --> 03:01:27.680
But cases were doubling every several days, and only around 4,000 people had been tested.

03:01:30.421 --> 03:01:35.844
When the president visited the CDC on March 6, he flatly denied there was a shortage.

03:01:35.864 --> 03:01:42.048
DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test.

03:01:42.068 --> 03:01:42.448
They're there.

03:01:42.836 --> 03:01:47.518
I think in this same little visit, he also talks to Kizmekia.

03:01:47.538 --> 03:01:49.619
They have the tests, and the tests are beautiful.

03:01:50.119 --> 03:01:52.600
You know, March 6th... No, no, maybe not.

03:01:52.640 --> 03:01:53.300
That's too early.

03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:57.642
...is the date that you won't forget, where the president came to the CDC.

03:01:57.882 --> 03:01:59.923
He's wearing the hat, Make America Great Again.

03:02:00.924 --> 03:02:04.785
And he states that everyone who wants a test can get a test.

03:02:05.125 --> 03:02:06.586
Did he believe that, do you think?

03:02:07.046 --> 03:02:10.627
Again, I'm not going to comment on what I think the president believed or didn't believe.

03:02:10.907 --> 03:02:11.648
Did you talk to him?

03:02:11.688 --> 03:02:17.610
Did you say to him, look, Mr. President, with all due respect, it's not true what you're saying.

03:02:17.930 --> 03:02:20.751
Yeah, I'm not going to comment on the conversations I've had with the president.

03:02:21.211 --> 03:02:26.333
If there's a doctor that wants to test, if there's somebody coming off a ship, they're all set.

03:02:26.873 --> 03:02:35.216
I remember watching that and thinking, I'd like the ability to test patients in my hospital at a much larger scale than what I'm doing, and I know I can't do that either.

03:02:35.822 --> 03:02:41.425
So at the time, it didn't reflect the reality of what I was experiencing as a clinical laboratory director in a hospital.

03:02:42.205 --> 03:02:44.506
She has a virus behind her there and a little plush toy.

03:02:44.766 --> 03:02:45.186
Not at all.

03:02:45.787 --> 03:02:49.788
And the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect.

03:02:50.929 --> 03:02:54.851
The tests are all perfect, like the letter he sent to North Korea.

03:02:55.031 --> 03:02:56.331
Prescription was perfect.

03:02:56.692 --> 03:03:00.894
It was a made-for-TV event, and it was soundbites.

03:03:02.062 --> 03:03:07.192
The reality of the situation was quite different, and I think most Americans knew that at the time.

03:03:09.437 --> 03:03:10.760
The president had to have known.

03:03:11.421 --> 03:03:12.844
I would expect that he did.

03:03:14.039 --> 03:03:17.080
But even had there been enough tests, the U.S.

03:03:17.140 --> 03:03:22.502
was facing a shortage of nasal swabs, masks, and other equipment needed to carry out the tests.

03:03:22.762 --> 03:03:33.025
So one of the frontline documentaries that comes a month after this is an hour about how we had a shortage of PPE.

03:03:33.726 --> 03:03:36.987
An hour about how we had a shortage of PPE.

03:03:37.647 --> 03:03:43.249
And the president placed responsibility on state and local authorities to acquire their own supplies.

03:03:44.795 --> 03:03:49.017
Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment, try getting it yourself.

03:03:49.477 --> 03:03:52.279
We will be backing you, but try getting it yourself.

03:03:52.379 --> 03:04:04.946
When he says things like the governors in the states should be trying to look after their own needs and get these things themselves, what that means is there is no single picture of what the country needs.

03:04:05.566 --> 03:04:06.666
You want to hear something crazy?

03:04:06.686 --> 03:04:13.050
There was a guy at the University of Pittsburgh that you can actually look up, and in the beginning of the pandemic, he stole, like,

03:04:14.540 --> 03:04:19.164
like a lot of masks and tried to sell them on eBay at $5,000 a box.

03:04:19.244 --> 03:04:21.986
And he made like 15 grand before the FBI caught him.

03:04:22.766 --> 03:04:25.889
And then he lost his job and you know, like it was hardcore.

03:04:25.909 --> 03:04:34.676
I don't know if he got sentenced already or what, but he was like one of the heads of physical plant at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine where I was working.

03:04:35.116 --> 03:04:40.961
And he was actually friends, good friends with my neighbor on my old street where I lost my house.

03:04:41.621 --> 03:04:52.007
And so I had sat with that guy a couple years earlier in the backyard of parties and at our block party and stuff because he came for those friends.

03:04:52.608 --> 03:05:01.953
And I've talked to him a long time over beers and stuff and knew that he worked at Pittsburgh where I worked, but we never ran into each other because there's lots of buildings there.

03:05:03.354 --> 03:05:17.363
Then at the beginning of the pandemic to hear that this guy Chris had stolen masks and risked his job and lost it to try and make a buck was absolutely mind-blowing to me because his family's well-to-do and that he didn't need to do it.

03:05:17.383 --> 03:05:19.205
It was like more for thrill or something.

03:05:19.245 --> 03:05:33.194
But again, it was because they had created this incredible illusion of consensus that we were short of PPE, that PPE was going to run out, that we didn't have our shit together, and that there was a disaster coming.

03:05:34.415 --> 03:05:36.195
So he saw profit.

03:05:36.275 --> 03:05:40.717
He saw opportunity in that locked closet.

03:05:40.797 --> 03:05:42.098
You're on your own, boys and girls.

03:05:42.578 --> 03:05:46.300
You're on your own, but we're also going to be buying up all the supplies that we've told you you need.

03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:51.362
Every state is basically going on eBay and bidding against all the others and against the federal.

03:05:51.602 --> 03:05:54.363
On eBay, where that guy was selling boxes of PPE.

03:05:54.384 --> 03:05:54.984
I'm not kidding.

03:05:55.104 --> 03:05:57.545
Government to try and get the basic supplies that they need.

03:05:59.500 --> 03:06:03.043
By March 11, there were 1,300 cases in the U.S.

03:06:03.223 --> 03:06:04.504
and 36 deaths.

03:06:05.704 --> 03:06:10.668
It was then that President Trump decided to expand his travel ban to European countries.

03:06:11.008 --> 03:06:21.716
My fellow Americans, to keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.

03:06:22.716 --> 03:06:29.061
The next day, Dr. Fauci testified before Congress and admitted they were still failing to test adequately.

03:06:29.639 --> 03:06:36.645
The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for.

03:06:37.185 --> 03:06:38.166
That is a failing.

03:06:38.506 --> 03:06:39.707
A failing, yes.

03:06:39.967 --> 03:06:40.648
It is a failing.

03:06:40.908 --> 03:06:41.429
Let's admit it.

03:06:41.789 --> 03:06:44.091
He was spot on, and I'm glad he said it.

03:06:44.531 --> 03:06:45.472
Somebody had to say it.

03:06:46.233 --> 03:06:49.735
The way people in other country are doing it, we're not set up for that.

03:06:50.316 --> 03:06:51.677
I concur with Dr. Fauci.

03:06:52.077 --> 03:06:53.218
We've completely failed.

03:06:53.238 --> 03:06:55.280
This is a massive failure.

03:06:55.480 --> 03:06:56.361
At the end of the day,

03:06:57.148 --> 03:07:03.251
The whole way that healthcare is set up in this country is the... That doesn't sound like an American to me.

03:07:06.072 --> 03:07:07.773
Do you hear an American accent here?

03:07:07.813 --> 03:07:08.373
What is that?

03:07:08.453 --> 03:07:10.714
Dr. Fauci, we've completely failed.

03:07:11.174 --> 03:07:12.795
This is a, there's a massive failure.

03:07:12.875 --> 03:07:17.497
But at the end of the day, the whole way that healthcare is set up in this country

03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:19.901
is the failure too, right?

03:07:20.261 --> 03:07:21.422
That every lab is fighting.

03:07:21.442 --> 03:07:24.284
She's got the same glasses that Claire Craig wears.

03:07:25.265 --> 03:07:26.766
I don't like this accent at all.

03:07:26.806 --> 03:07:27.947
This is not an American.

03:07:28.407 --> 03:07:30.428
Every state is fighting for itself.

03:07:30.508 --> 03:07:31.849
Every city is fighting for itself.

03:07:32.169 --> 03:07:35.652
I mean, that's not what you need in something like this.

03:07:36.576 --> 03:07:43.903
Is it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope and misrepresenting preparedness right now?

03:07:43.923 --> 03:07:44.703
No, I don't think so.

03:07:44.803 --> 03:07:45.504
No, I don't think so.

03:07:45.544 --> 03:07:49.548
I think that, I think it's got, you know, the not-yet-approved drug on it.

03:07:49.888 --> 03:07:50.989
Such a lovely question.

03:07:51.429 --> 03:07:53.291
What do you say to Americans who are scared, though?

03:07:53.311 --> 03:08:00.217
I guess nearly 200 dead, 14,000 who are sick, millions, as you witnessed, who are scared right now.

03:08:00.417 --> 03:08:03.400
What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?

03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:08.604
The FLCCC says to go to the hospital if your pulse ox gets below 94.

03:08:08.764 --> 03:08:12.226
I say that you're a terrible reporter.

03:08:12.326 --> 03:08:13.007
That's what I say.

03:08:14.628 --> 03:08:20.052
I think it's a very nasty question, and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people.

03:08:20.493 --> 03:08:23.835
The American people are looking for answers, and they're looking for hope.

03:08:24.415 --> 03:08:26.117
And you're doing sensationalism.

03:08:26.717 --> 03:08:29.159
By the end of March, there were more than 5,500 deaths.

03:08:32.873 --> 03:08:40.677
Many of them probably started by supplementary oxygen leading to ARDS and then ventilation, not Remdesivir.

03:08:41.997 --> 03:08:44.399
You see, Remdesivir isn't out there yet.

03:08:44.639 --> 03:08:46.680
Fauci didn't get on the couch and say that yet.

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:51.602
So you can't blame Remdesivir for the murder that happened in the beginning of the pandemic.

03:08:52.022 --> 03:09:01.947
You can't blame Remdesivir for this murder that they used to model all of the coming months, that they used to project the future.

03:09:07.833 --> 03:09:12.374
Jessica Carroll, the clinic nurse, was never able to get her daughter Gianna tested.

03:09:14.435 --> 03:09:24.258
If I get to be in that movie where Robert De Niro plays Tony Fauci, then I want the guy from The Fly to play me.

03:09:24.298 --> 03:09:25.278
Gianna recovered.

03:09:26.298 --> 03:09:30.880
But two weeks later, Jessica's aunt Amelia spiked a high fever and cough.

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.121
I get a phone call from my mom that my aunt is ill and

03:09:35.854 --> 03:09:38.034
That's when I started to get really scared.

03:09:38.094 --> 03:09:41.975
There's gotta be a guy from The Sopranos who could play Tony Fauci better.

03:09:43.356 --> 03:09:51.577
Um... Because you kept hearing, the hospital's filling up, and now I'm like, wait, this is not good.

03:09:53.718 --> 03:09:57.539
Jeff Goldblum is from Pittsburgh, actually, and he, like me, also has no cavities.

03:09:57.799 --> 03:10:02.460
Amelia was hospitalized, but in the meantime, Jessica got another call.

03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:04.300
It was her mother.

03:10:05.325 --> 03:10:06.867
She said, I have to tell you something.

03:10:07.568 --> 03:10:08.169
I have a fever.

03:10:08.849 --> 03:10:10.872
And I said, no, mommy, please don't tell me that.

03:10:10.992 --> 03:10:12.354
And she goes, yeah, I have a fever.

03:10:13.055 --> 03:10:14.016
And I started coughing.

03:10:14.656 --> 03:10:15.377
And I'm scared.

03:10:19.522 --> 03:10:21.985
Jessica's mother was hospitalized on April 7.

03:10:23.854 --> 03:10:26.135
The next day, just down the hospital hallway.

03:10:26.155 --> 03:10:28.296
Al Pacino is one skilled mofo.

03:10:28.336 --> 03:10:29.037
That is for sure.

03:10:29.097 --> 03:10:29.817
I agree with that.

03:10:30.037 --> 03:10:31.598
I like Al Pacino a lot.

03:10:32.118 --> 03:10:35.340
Her sister, Amelia, Jessica's aunt, died.

03:10:39.061 --> 03:10:40.242
By now, there were over 18.

03:10:40.822 --> 03:10:43.284
There's the refrigerator truck and it's well lit.

03:10:43.524 --> 03:10:45.925
You know, it got the lights on it to make sure you can see it.

03:10:48.308 --> 03:10:50.570
13,000 deaths from coronavirus in America.

03:10:50.970 --> 03:10:52.191
That was pretty extraordinary.

03:10:52.431 --> 03:10:55.893
The one time that I spoke to her on the phone, she was very out of breath.

03:10:56.613 --> 03:10:57.734
Every word was labored.

03:10:57.754 --> 03:11:02.297
And so we, at that point, were just conversing by text.

03:11:04.058 --> 03:11:09.001
But then I had texted her at some point in the evening, and she hadn't answered me back.

03:11:09.676 --> 03:11:22.060
What about the guy who, you remember Soprano had a sister and she got married to one of the bad, bad or bad guys and then she ended up shooting him in the chest.

03:11:22.580 --> 03:11:25.061
That guy could play, that guy could play Tony Fauci.

03:11:26.622 --> 03:11:28.302
And I'm like now starting getting worried.

03:11:28.362 --> 03:11:30.643
And next thing you know, I get a text from her.

03:11:31.163 --> 03:11:33.664
It was like jarbled gibberish.

03:11:33.704 --> 03:11:35.425
And then it was call me, call me now.

03:11:36.145 --> 03:11:39.166
And the doctor was there and the doctor is telling me,

03:11:39.881 --> 03:11:42.883
Um, you know, unfortunately, at this point, we need to intubate.

03:11:43.143 --> 03:11:43.483
Okay.

03:11:43.503 --> 03:11:43.843
Thank you.

03:11:43.903 --> 03:11:44.624
I appreciate it.

03:11:44.664 --> 03:11:45.284
Thank you so much.

03:11:45.844 --> 03:11:50.346
Since visiting was prohibited, Jessica could only reach her mother through FaceTime.

03:11:51.367 --> 03:11:52.408
Hi, Mommy.

03:11:52.428 --> 03:11:54.609
Hi, Mama.

03:11:54.649 --> 03:11:55.369
Do you hear me?

03:11:55.389 --> 03:12:00.352
In my heart, I know she was able to hear me, but it was hard to see her like that.

03:12:01.192 --> 03:12:03.753
I can get chills from that because you know what they're doing, right?

03:12:03.793 --> 03:12:08.736
They're creating an illusion of consensus among Americans and everybody that watched Frontline.

03:12:10.339 --> 03:12:12.000
And that is gross.

03:12:13.741 --> 03:12:18.104
I even promised her that when she got better, I'd take her to her favorite place, which is the casino.

03:12:18.905 --> 03:12:24.329
And not being able to... Mommy.

03:12:24.349 --> 03:12:26.510
Hi, Mama.

03:12:26.570 --> 03:12:27.351
Do you hear me?

03:12:27.391 --> 03:12:30.052
It looks like a feeding tube also, actually, right?

03:12:30.072 --> 03:12:34.976
Because that one, that one there has got stuff in it, and this one doesn't.

03:12:35.016 --> 03:12:35.896
And then there's more.

03:12:35.936 --> 03:12:37.377
I mean, that's a lot of tubes, indeed.

03:12:37.538 --> 03:12:39.059
At heart, I know she was able to hear me.

03:12:40.049 --> 03:12:42.151
but it was hard to see her like that.

03:12:42.171 --> 03:12:42.751
Also some IVs.

03:12:44.232 --> 03:12:48.555
I even promised her that when she got better, I'd take her to her favorite place, which is the casino.

03:12:49.396 --> 03:12:58.803
And not being able to be there and hold her hand and let her hear my voice has just been the worst of all of this.

03:13:00.804 --> 03:13:03.066
Mama, I love you.

03:13:03.086 --> 03:13:03.146
Wow.

03:13:04.047 --> 03:13:05.568
I love you so much.

03:13:05.588 --> 03:13:06.588
This is so gross.

03:13:08.864 --> 03:13:09.785
and you're fighting.

03:13:09.885 --> 03:13:10.846
I know you are.

03:13:11.186 --> 03:13:15.630
I need you to get better, Mommy, okay?

03:13:16.631 --> 03:13:21.534
After 16 days on a ventilator, Jessica's mother, Ann Martinez, passed away.

03:13:23.956 --> 03:13:24.957
It happened on April 23rd.

03:13:24.977 --> 03:13:25.558
It was her 80th birthday.

03:13:25.578 --> 03:13:26.979
By then, over 50,000 Americans had died.

03:13:35.512 --> 03:13:39.035
around 15,000 of them in New York State.

03:13:39.055 --> 03:13:41.478
See, 15,000 in New York State.

03:13:41.518 --> 03:13:41.958
I thought it was 24,000.

03:13:44.961 --> 03:13:45.601
Five weeks.

03:13:46.302 --> 03:13:51.186
The bodies were stored in refrigerated trucks next to the hospitals.

03:13:51.206 --> 03:13:52.728
Oh, some of those trucks weren't even running.

03:13:53.529 --> 03:13:57.592
When they had people walking around those hospitals, they weren't even running.

03:13:57.652 --> 03:14:01.416
Dr. Ho, on March 31st, he described New York this way.

03:14:03.331 --> 03:14:05.354
New York is the new Wuhan right now.

03:14:06.135 --> 03:14:11.562
There's tremendous carnage seen in all the hospitals in this area.

03:14:11.702 --> 03:14:12.884
Tremendous carnage.

03:14:13.024 --> 03:14:14.466
Tremendous carnage.

03:14:15.047 --> 03:14:15.788
Stop lying!

03:14:16.429 --> 03:14:19.413
Tremendous carnage that no police officer noticed.

03:14:22.324 --> 03:14:24.046
They're scared.

03:14:24.106 --> 03:14:28.910
Tremendous carnage, like 5,000 bodies a week when normally they're used to doing like 700.

03:14:29.671 --> 03:14:32.093
But who knows who carried all these bodies around?

03:14:32.873 --> 03:14:34.475
Who knows where they got all the gurneys?

03:14:35.215 --> 03:14:35.716
Who knows?

03:14:36.677 --> 03:14:39.859
I guess they just stacked them up like cordwood inside of those trucks.

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:44.463
We just didn't see anybody, you know, two big strong guys going like this.

03:14:44.624 --> 03:14:46.886
We didn't see anybody throwing bodies into trucks.

03:14:47.446 --> 03:14:58.190
like this, even though if you had 5,000 bodies a week in a city that's usually having 700 to 1,000, you'd need to have a few strong guys throwing bodies into a truck like this.

03:14:58.310 --> 03:15:00.031
Who processed all these bodies?

03:15:00.131 --> 03:15:07.694
Well, it's like being hit by a tsunami of patients, and they're not well equipped to fight this.

03:15:10.899 --> 03:15:11.759
Who do you blame for that?

03:15:11.940 --> 03:15:14.021
Technically that's called a bag of holding.

03:15:14.201 --> 03:15:21.725
I mean, if you're really going to stick to the original Dungeons and Dragons mythology, then it's called a bag of holding and Harry Potter took it and made it something else.

03:15:22.365 --> 03:15:23.205
I blame the government.

03:15:23.366 --> 03:15:27.628
I honestly, I blame the government for, um, not alert.

03:15:27.748 --> 03:15:32.610
She blames the government and incidentally on Sky News Australia, they also blame our government.

03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:39.294
Being a sooner that this was going to be an issue, not, um, consolidating a nationwide stockpile.

03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:46.545
and not putting people in charge of giving it to who needs it in an orderly fashion.

03:15:47.106 --> 03:15:55.613
Just being a citizen, not even being a healthcare professional and watching the news, I can see how just incompetent everything is.

03:15:57.855 --> 03:16:02.158
Jessica Caro's mother and aunt immigrated here from the Dominican Republic.

03:16:03.579 --> 03:16:06.802
Black and Latino communities have been the hardest hit.

03:16:07.731 --> 03:16:15.234
Blacks and Latinos are grossly disproportionately killed.

03:16:15.474 --> 03:16:16.274
Cleavon Gilman.

03:16:16.374 --> 03:16:19.475
And that was probably because they are on Medicare.

03:16:19.535 --> 03:16:26.357
That's probably because when they were brought into the hospital, they were targeted for the high flow oxygen death protocol.

03:16:26.978 --> 03:16:34.080
That's because as Denny Rancor has shown that the death rate in America directly correlates with poverty.

03:16:37.404 --> 03:16:46.448
not black and Latino, but poverty, income level, not black and Latino.

03:16:47.649 --> 03:16:54.592
But the PBS NewsHour would like you to believe that it's a race problem in America because America has a race problem and it's systemic.

03:16:55.492 --> 03:16:59.914
That's why celebrities get to test when they're not positive, but we don't get any tests.

03:17:00.915 --> 03:17:03.856
Is an emergency room doctor at New York Presbyterian.

03:17:05.054 --> 03:17:11.558
It's just due to that a large majority of us live in housing projects as well.

03:17:11.878 --> 03:17:18.182
A lot of us are also essential workers, MTA officers, grocery clerks.

03:17:19.823 --> 03:17:23.145
And that's just taking a toll on our whole community.

03:17:25.186 --> 03:17:29.889
Across the city, the virus has been twice as deadly for Blacks and Latinos as whites.

03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:33.591
And poverty is also a dangerous risk factor.

03:17:34.344 --> 03:17:39.866
I think this crisis has amassed a tremendous vulnerability in America.

03:17:40.546 --> 03:17:42.386
Former USAID guy again.

03:17:42.846 --> 03:17:46.607
Where 40, 50, 60% of American households.

03:17:46.627 --> 03:17:56.870
USAID, the entity in the United States that funded EcoHealth Alliance, so essentially funded the illusion of pandemic potential.

03:17:57.250 --> 03:18:00.951
Barely get by day to day, have lost faith in the American.

03:18:01.071 --> 03:18:03.272
And he actually was there when they funded him, you see?

03:18:05.134 --> 03:18:07.656
So he's definitely part of the DASAC illusion.

03:18:07.716 --> 03:18:10.137
And DASAC is not an illusion that they're covering up.

03:18:10.217 --> 03:18:10.838
It's an illusion.

03:18:10.898 --> 03:18:20.944
He's a fat nobody who used to work on electron microscopes and was a zoologist before he became the EcoHealth Alliance guy.

03:18:21.565 --> 03:18:22.525
He's a nobody.

03:18:22.966 --> 03:18:24.607
He's not a real biologist.

03:18:24.647 --> 03:18:26.148
He's not a real academic.

03:18:28.325 --> 03:18:52.142
He is an intelligence agent that has been put forth by the American traders and probably by the British crown or the city of London or whoever weaponized pile of money is behind him to set up the belief in pandemic potential for it to be ubiquitous throughout the bureaucracy, throughout the common people, throughout the university system.

03:18:52.443 --> 03:18:55.485
I can dream for their children that their kids can do better, that they can

03:18:56.686 --> 03:19:03.974
And now our society will have to grapple with and deal with the reality that we can't just hide and pretend that's not the case anymore.

03:19:11.203 --> 03:19:14.707
Today, the total number of Americans who have died is more than 115,000.

03:19:18.979 --> 03:19:29.708
A Columbia University study has calculated that had a stay-at-home order been imposed at the end of February, it would have prevented 83% of all U.S.

03:19:29.768 --> 03:19:30.088
deaths.

03:19:30.368 --> 03:19:37.014
A stay-at-home order in February instead of March would have saved 80% of the U.S.

03:19:37.074 --> 03:19:37.334
deaths.

03:19:37.354 --> 03:19:44.240
This sounds exactly like Bret Weinstein, exactly like Tony Fauci, exactly like everyone.

03:19:48.166 --> 03:19:52.708
It's remarkable to me that in the Vietnam War, I think 55,000 American soldiers died.

03:19:53.088 --> 03:19:56.370
And we're now saying we might see four times that many people die.

03:19:56.390 --> 03:19:58.171
Yep.

03:19:58.771 --> 03:19:59.271
It's astounding.

03:19:59.992 --> 03:20:01.893
You know, 9-11, we lost 3,000 people.

03:20:02.453 --> 03:20:12.978
And in response to that, the country built an infrastructure for protecting against terrorist attacks that costs an average of $150 to $250 billion a year.

03:20:12.998 --> 03:20:16.700
I think we need to take this threat as seriously as we take the threat of terrorism.

03:20:17.849 --> 03:20:21.270
Are we really spending $150 billion a year on terrorism?

03:20:22.791 --> 03:20:23.571
On anti-terror?

03:20:25.472 --> 03:20:40.818
We also have $150 billion antibody market before the pandemic started, and then antibody intellectual property was completely undermined by the Supreme Court at the beginning of the pandemic that none of these people are talking about, but could be.

03:20:42.040 --> 03:20:45.664
It has the potential to kill at least as many, if not considerably more Americans.

03:20:46.104 --> 03:20:49.928
And I hope coming out of this- And it's much more dangerous than terrorism.

03:20:49.989 --> 03:20:54.013
I mean, Kim Dotcom made that point, you know, it's more dangerous than nuclear weapons.

03:20:54.073 --> 03:21:03.543
Nuclear weapons still can only kill a limited number of people, whereas a virus, if Lee Man-Yan is right, nobody can build natural immunity to it and all eight billion people will die.

03:21:03.683 --> 03:21:05.223
whenever we do eventually come out of this.

03:21:05.423 --> 03:21:08.784
We'll finally take... Whenever we do eventually come out of this.

03:21:09.004 --> 03:21:10.084
My voice is getting tired.

03:21:10.104 --> 03:21:10.744
We're almost done.

03:21:10.804 --> 03:21:14.325
Take seriously the importance of health security and public health investments.

03:21:16.825 --> 03:21:19.506
Finally, there was the toll on health care workers.

03:21:20.726 --> 03:21:23.906
In New York, scores of health care workers died of the virus.

03:21:24.947 --> 03:21:25.427
Scores?

03:21:25.527 --> 03:21:26.887
How about we have an actual number?

03:21:30.508 --> 03:21:32.528
New Yorkers tried to show their support

03:21:34.477 --> 03:21:38.680
Every day thousands went to the streets and to their windows to say thank you.

03:21:40.941 --> 03:21:50.068
That started in Italy and actually the National Public Radio did a story about how they were doing it on Montana.

03:21:50.488 --> 03:21:54.651
In a town in Montana they were actually getting out of the window and howling like wolves.

03:21:55.686 --> 03:22:04.389
And there was a real NPR program about that that showed that in Italy they were banging pans and in a place in Montana they were howling like wolves.

03:22:15.452 --> 03:22:17.473
I'm getting chills again because it's so gross.

03:22:19.232 --> 03:22:21.253
This is what they do with social media though, right?

03:22:21.293 --> 03:22:22.454
They do it on social media.

03:22:22.494 --> 03:22:25.696
They got the message out and then people participate.

03:22:26.917 --> 03:22:35.382
No different than George Floyd, no different than the toilet paper craze, no different than how many shooters are there and was there one on the water tower?

03:22:35.783 --> 03:22:40.886
You are asking the questions that they want you to ask and that's how you can't get out of the trap.

03:22:45.489 --> 03:22:47.651
But we are gonna get our kids out of this trap.

03:22:48.331 --> 03:22:50.813
We are definitely getting our kids out of this trap.

03:22:51.354 --> 03:22:51.654
Here we go.

03:22:51.674 --> 03:22:52.094
Potter's Field.

03:22:52.114 --> 03:22:54.656
Drone shot, just in case anybody, you know, gets it misconstrued.

03:22:54.676 --> 03:23:00.420
It's not just COVID, it's all the dead that we don't have a place to put in New York City.

03:23:00.521 --> 03:23:01.221
But yeah, go ahead.

03:23:15.665 --> 03:23:17.086
5,000 bodies a week.

03:23:17.226 --> 03:23:17.926
Think about that.

03:23:17.946 --> 03:23:19.787
5,000 bodies a week.

03:23:19.807 --> 03:23:23.048
The steepest drop in employment since the Great Depression.

03:23:26.089 --> 03:23:29.110
Now countries around the world are beginning to reopen.

03:23:30.531 --> 03:23:33.452
Healthcare officials warn of a second wave.

03:23:37.653 --> 03:23:41.535
A second wave is how they're going to end it?

03:23:44.179 --> 03:23:45.960
Wow, listen to the end.

03:23:48.780 --> 03:23:49.861
Beginning to reopen.

03:23:51.321 --> 03:23:54.262
Healthcare officials warn of a second wave.

03:23:59.123 --> 03:24:03.604
And that's how we're going to go into the fall with a warning of the second wave.

03:24:04.425 --> 03:24:05.325
Think about this.

03:24:08.939 --> 03:24:13.801
Think about this very carefully, what I've shown you here, because we can keep going.

03:24:13.841 --> 03:24:14.582
There are more.

03:24:16.582 --> 03:24:19.784
Think very carefully about what I'm trying to argue here.

03:24:21.124 --> 03:24:26.507
We need to come to a new consensus about what was done to us.

03:24:26.787 --> 03:24:28.628
We needed to have a new consensus.

03:24:35.646 --> 03:24:42.430
And the PBS NewsHour time machine is a great place to start to get people to revisit what actually happened.

03:24:42.910 --> 03:24:46.292
That people were murdered and they lied about it around the world.

03:24:47.152 --> 03:24:51.275
That molecular biology, as they tell it to us, cannot explain what happened.

03:24:52.656 --> 03:25:00.260
And that the real reason why they did it was because they're protecting the vaccine schedule in America and around the world because it is a criminal enterprise.

03:25:01.184 --> 03:25:10.614
And they need everyone in the world, especially the young parents and the young people that are not with children yet, to accept the vaccine schedule as proven.

03:25:11.735 --> 03:25:13.497
The vaccine schedule as a given.

03:25:14.799 --> 03:25:18.783
Because that's what Kissinger explained to us is the way that they will get control of us.

03:25:18.823 --> 03:25:21.746
They can end us whenever they want to if we accept this schedule.

03:25:25.325 --> 03:25:29.047
have complete control over our children's sovereignty if we accept this schedule.

03:25:29.087 --> 03:25:37.690
We are giving implicit consent or implied consent when we leave our children at the mercy of social media.

03:25:38.050 --> 03:25:42.412
And we cannot give implied consent to social media for our kids anymore.

03:25:42.792 --> 03:25:45.994
We can't give implied consent for our health of our kids anymore.

03:25:46.414 --> 03:25:51.596
And we must make people aware that the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise.

03:25:51.976 --> 03:25:53.477
You cannot make a cuckoo clock

03:25:53.957 --> 03:25:57.740
make toast, and you cannot make your body do something that it doesn't already do.

03:25:58.540 --> 03:26:08.206
These people have lied to us about the fundamentals of our biology, and the way we fight back is to teach our kids the biology that edifies these three ideas.

03:26:08.587 --> 03:26:17.773
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and RNA

03:26:18.493 --> 03:26:21.994
Definitely, definitely cannot pandemic because they are not viral.

03:26:22.074 --> 03:26:23.574
They are not pattern integrities.

03:26:23.614 --> 03:26:26.895
They can't go exponential, ladies and gentlemen.

03:26:26.915 --> 03:26:27.695
They just can't.

03:26:33.716 --> 03:26:35.697
They can't go exponential, ladies and gentlemen.

03:26:35.737 --> 03:26:37.917
Don't argue about what they want you to argue about.

03:26:37.997 --> 03:26:40.698
Don't argue with whom they want you to argue.

03:26:44.684 --> 03:26:50.146

03:27:01.664 --> 03:27:07.166
You guys gotta log off, you gotta get off, you gotta get off that social media because that's their weapon against us.

03:27:07.947 --> 03:27:10.768
We don't have to fear the government, we have to fear social media.

03:27:11.448 --> 03:27:12.229
That's the reality.

03:27:12.269 --> 03:27:14.210
We gotta get our kids off of social media.

03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:16.271
We gotta do it right now.

03:27:18.912 --> 03:27:20.653
I love you all very much, ladies and gentlemen.

03:27:20.693 --> 03:27:21.733
I'll see you again tomorrow.

03:27:22.433 --> 03:27:25.835
I don't know if I'll do three hours again tomorrow, but I'll definitely see you tomorrow.
