WEBVTT

00:13.387 --> 00:13.888
so

00:44.650 --> 00:48.753
Yo, welcome to the Spaz Passage.

00:49.053 --> 00:52.896
Let's see how I'm passing.

01:13.353 --> 01:14.593
Yo, you remember O'Hara.

01:14.613 --> 01:15.174
My boy, Sulu.

01:15.194 --> 01:15.414
Hey, yo!

01:15.574 --> 01:16.814
What up, Spock?

01:16.894 --> 01:18.835
Baby, no salsa on the leather.

01:19.895 --> 01:20.735
Keep it on the chips.

01:22.476 --> 01:22.876
Artwork.

01:23.856 --> 01:24.076
Dope.

01:26.137 --> 01:28.117
James T. Kirk, president of the council.

01:28.957 --> 01:31.058
This boy love that leftover roast beef.

01:31.118 --> 01:33.198
Spock, it's solid beef, baby.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.579
If you like it a little, you know, rotten.

01:36.759 --> 01:38.160
And this here is my sanctuary.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.921
See, this is where I chill, where I relax, where I chillax.

01:45.239 --> 01:52.704
The title was just wrong there I should have I

02:10.953 --> 02:15.241
Have a guest very soon on Zoom and we'll have a little chat.

02:15.281 --> 02:16.102
We'll see what happens.

02:16.683 --> 02:17.384
I'm pretty excited.

03:00.946 --> 03:01.006
you

03:38.911 --> 03:40.471
I think truth is good for kids.

03:40.892 --> 03:44.692
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.833
We want everybody to feel good.

03:47.753 --> 03:49.194
That's not the way life is.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.215
But you can tell if someone's lying.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.635
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

03:57.436 --> 03:58.156
And I have lied.

03:58.336 --> 03:59.216
I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:59.236 --> 04:00.156
I don't want to lie.

04:00.656 --> 04:01.997
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:02.097 --> 04:03.137
I try not to be a liar.

04:03.157 --> 04:04.017
I don't want to be a liar.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.298
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

04:09.551 --> 04:29.759
introduced Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

04:30.860 --> 04:34.181
And then each of us, this incredible, preeminent

04:34.830 --> 04:39.394
a panel that we have each one of you is going to get a chance to comment.

04:43.177 --> 04:48.782
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

04:49.462 --> 05:01.708
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

05:01.988 --> 05:03.989
It's just a big hassle in the end.

05:04.589 --> 05:10.592
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not,

05:16.934 --> 05:20.296
there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

05:20.356 --> 05:22.857
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

05:55.708 --> 05:55.848
The.

06:29.969 --> 06:30.749
Hello, everybody.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.710
Welcome to the show.

06:31.810 --> 06:33.450
This is Giga Home Biological.

06:33.490 --> 06:36.171
We're trying to dispel the enchantment one day at a time.

06:38.372 --> 06:48.175
I'm hopeful that I'm going to have a guest in a few minutes, and we're going to have a little chat about this kind of thing, about being a Galileo Galilei when it isn't cool.

06:49.575 --> 06:55.617
And I think my scheduled guest is somebody who can definitely speak to being a Galileo

06:56.397 --> 07:02.115
when it isn't cool or wasn't cool and can tell us a little bit about the different sides of the truth.

07:05.771 --> 07:11.375
Because he's keenly aware of the fact that what's perceived to be true is all that matters to these people.

07:11.395 --> 07:15.939
That's how they've been controlling us for quite some time.

07:17.200 --> 07:25.366
And that's why it has become true that our consciousness is actually the prime real estate that they are competing for.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.808
And it's become ever easier for them to

07:29.537 --> 07:37.387
to pull this off because of social media and the permissions that we've given them, the access that we've given them to our consciousness.

07:39.088 --> 07:43.992
and so there was no spread in New York City that can really be detected by any normal means.

07:45.052 --> 07:49.496
Infectious clones, the term, is actually the only real threat if you understand it.

07:50.436 --> 07:59.343
Placebo batches are never really mentioned, but they're the most obvious way that a known sort of deadly new kind of

08:01.483 --> 08:14.856
of medicine would be rolled out and could be confused enough so that transfection in healthy animals, which was already dumb before the pandemic, could be misconstrued as something that saved anyone.

08:16.344 --> 08:18.666
Um, and, uh, yeah, the protocols were murder.

08:18.946 --> 08:30.535
Gain of function is definitely a mythology and they made you feel like you were solving a Scooby-Doo mystery, uh, in order that you would teach your kids all about gain of function and all about viruses.

08:30.715 --> 08:41.423
And, uh, as long as they remain spectacularly committed to these lies and you, you keep thinking you're solving this mystery, catching them in their, in their act.

08:42.964 --> 08:45.585
You're never going to wake up to the fact that it's very simple.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.305
They murdered people and lied about it and they do it all the time.

08:50.266 --> 08:56.307
And then instead of telling you the truth, they just attribute bad motives to everybody that disagrees with their story.

08:57.087 --> 08:58.208
That's how we do it now.

08:58.548 --> 09:00.668
That's how we've been governed for a very long time.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.569
And now we have weaponized piles of money that are doing it to us.

09:05.009 --> 09:07.950
And if we don't show our kids the truth, they might never see it.

09:09.065 --> 09:16.107
Even if they are kids that would normally see it, social media is especially malevolent.

09:16.708 --> 09:17.928
It's not easy to see through.

09:19.048 --> 09:24.290
And a lot of us thought we were solving this mystery on Twitter, thinking we were using Twitter against them.

09:24.910 --> 09:33.593
That it was some kind of tool that we had in our toolbox that we could use against the oligarchy or the big weaponized piles of money, and it was just kind of a joke.

09:34.794 --> 09:37.655
They're still right on schedule with their little

09:40.148 --> 09:44.771
They're right on schedule with this, this, you know, AI is going to collect all the data.

09:44.991 --> 09:52.056
And, uh, if we don't learn the history that's still available to us and talk to the people who lived it, I don't know how we're going to get out of this.

09:53.037 --> 09:55.518
We inherited these charlatans from our parents.

09:55.698 --> 10:01.162
Actually, we, they had power over our parents and that's why they kind of why they have power over us.

10:01.262 --> 10:02.203
That's the real truth.

10:02.963 --> 10:07.126
And if we wake up to that truth, there might be a way for us to, to, to escape.

10:08.167 --> 10:08.247
Um,

10:10.899 --> 10:19.925
I'm just gonna pause for a second and make sure that I sent that mail because somehow I'm having the feeling, oh, he joined already.

10:20.005 --> 10:20.966
Then what's happening here?

10:21.586 --> 10:26.469
I don't see him there actually.

10:27.370 --> 10:31.833
So it says I got an email here that he's joined my personal meeting room.

10:31.893 --> 10:32.854
Start the meeting.

10:32.874 --> 10:35.636
Oh, I see.

10:35.716 --> 10:36.776
Maybe that's what I did.

10:37.337 --> 10:37.657
Ships.

10:38.598 --> 10:39.198
End the meeting.

10:41.035 --> 10:42.055
Hold on a second, guys.

10:42.095 --> 10:42.976
Let me get this done.

10:43.156 --> 10:44.276
End the meeting for all.

10:46.757 --> 10:50.279
Zoom is not going to be happy with me right now because I'm also streaming, of course.

10:50.339 --> 10:50.739
I'm here.

10:51.179 --> 10:52.119
Hello, everybody.

10:52.160 --> 10:52.740
Hello, hello.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.681
I just have to screw this meeting up, of course.

10:55.741 --> 10:56.901
I'm going to start this meeting.

11:00.363 --> 11:01.603
And what did it do there?

11:03.764 --> 11:04.945
Oh, goodness sakes.

11:05.165 --> 11:05.525
Really?

11:07.148 --> 11:18.117
Okay, you're going to have to give me one more second because this is really, uh, I have, I have a problem here with, with, um, my browsy browsers causing me some trouble here.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.018
So let me see if this is going to go now.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.881
If you are the meeting host, start the meeting.

11:24.001 --> 11:25.182
Oh, I'll just do that then.

11:25.482 --> 11:25.843
Duh.

11:26.904 --> 11:27.264
Zoom.

11:28.145 --> 11:28.725
New meeting.

11:29.365 --> 11:30.086
Start video.

11:30.206 --> 11:31.487
Use my personal thing.

11:31.767 --> 11:32.348
There we go.

11:33.544 --> 11:36.325
I didn't have a certain box clicked.

11:37.305 --> 11:44.026
So I was starting a new meeting with a different address instead of the one that I had programmed in, which I think we should be on now.

11:44.667 --> 11:47.567
Hopefully this is going to work.

11:51.528 --> 11:52.108
Let's see.

11:52.208 --> 11:52.948
That's off.

11:53.008 --> 11:53.689
That's working.

11:53.849 --> 11:55.589
I see my sound is working.

11:55.609 --> 11:57.989
I don't see my virtual camera on.

11:58.010 --> 11:58.970
I'm going to turn that on.

11:59.010 --> 11:59.490
There we go.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.010
That's on.

12:01.533 --> 12:04.894
I see myself, but I don't see anybody else in this meeting.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.015
Oh, there he is.

12:06.755 --> 12:07.816
He's connecting right now.

12:07.836 --> 12:13.038
Okay, we're gonna continue with this and he will be with us in a second.

12:14.098 --> 12:16.899
I'm just gonna finish this up quick.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.025
Getting started here.

12:21.345 --> 12:22.425
I see you there, David.

12:22.465 --> 12:30.168
We're trying to make gentle the life of this world, despite the fact that they're using some of our our history against us.

12:31.729 --> 12:34.810
This is a very coordinated effort.

12:35.651 --> 12:38.072
It is a coordinated effort that results in a

12:38.912 --> 12:41.014
a false wave of consensus.

12:41.074 --> 13:03.471
And if you want to teach your kids to see through this false wave of consensus, you're going to be able to, you're going to have to be able to teach them a little history, but also a little bit of contemporary biology so that you understand why, despite all of these new technologies and all of these new ways to sequence things ever easier, we haven't learned very much about virology and the infectious cycle in a very long time.

13:03.971 --> 13:07.654
And that's because this wave of consensus about what virology is

13:08.174 --> 13:15.281
has been weaponized against us in a way that involves a lot more than Tony Fauci and a few people at NIH.

13:15.341 --> 13:17.683
But it is a national security operation.

13:18.123 --> 13:28.953
And if you don't stay focused on the biology and you take their bait on social media and you do not love your neighbor, I'm afraid that you're going to be part of the controlled demolition of America and maybe the whole West.

13:29.634 --> 13:40.200
And so we're trying to save some social media users today and we're trying to give this advice to people in America especially stay focused on biology don't take their bait on social media and love your neighbor.

13:41.101 --> 13:46.284
The way this works is that people share this stream and as it gets shared people get the biology and they wake up.

13:47.905 --> 13:53.908
I'm gonna just pause it right here actually and hit escape and just go right away to

13:55.248 --> 14:04.696
My recent colleague, and I should say just recent colleague because I'll just transition out of this music and do recent colleague here.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.841
My recent colleague has degrees in chemistry and biology and

14:10.681 --> 14:18.329
And he has been in the pharma and biotech industry between 78 and 96 or so.

14:18.889 --> 14:23.434
And then after 1996, he started working on cancer.

14:24.395 --> 14:27.818
And so I suspect he's got a lot to tell us about that as well.

14:27.858 --> 14:31.222
We're just not really sure where we're going to start this conversation.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.625
To go on further, just some tidbits here.

14:36.285 --> 14:40.287
He was the AIDS advisor to the South African president in the year 2000.

14:40.687 --> 14:46.631
He's got more than 30 or sorry, 40 scientific publications and at least two books.

14:46.831 --> 14:51.653
And so far be it from me to give more of an introduction than that.

14:51.733 --> 14:55.755
Instead, I just like to turn the floor over to Dr. David Resnick.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.176
Thank you very much for joining me.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.477
Am I saying your last name right?

14:59.639 --> 15:00.700
Rastnik, yes, that's it.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.600
Good to see you, Jay.

15:01.620 --> 15:02.380
Yeah, good to see you.

15:02.461 --> 15:08.284
I'm going to put myself down here in the corner and then if you wouldn't mind improving on my introduction and maybe if...

15:09.349 --> 15:16.190
I mean, the way that we know each other, ladies and gentlemen, is that we've been working on a case together and it's about PCR testing and this kind of thing.

15:16.730 --> 15:19.731
And so we haven't really met before until right now.

15:19.771 --> 15:22.591
And so this is kind of a fun time for both of us.

15:22.651 --> 15:30.853
And I thought it would be nice if we do it live, it'll feel better and everybody will get to, well, you'll feel the honesty because, you know, we've never even been on Zoom before.

15:30.913 --> 15:34.653
So I'm going to switch over here and then put myself down here.

15:34.673 --> 15:37.274
And then if you could improve on my introduction, that'd be really great.

15:37.314 --> 15:37.534
Thanks.

15:38.672 --> 15:43.014
Okay, well, I don't like to go into too deep on that stuff.

15:43.074 --> 15:45.176
I have a website, davidrasnik.com.

15:45.216 --> 15:46.096
People can go there.

15:46.136 --> 15:48.677
It's got 40 years plus stuff on there.

15:49.938 --> 15:50.578
You got it right.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.740
I was in the pharmaceutical industry for about 20 years.

15:53.840 --> 16:04.706
And then I left that in 1996, permanently joined up with Professor Peter Duesberg at UC Berkeley to fight the AIDS stuff.

16:04.786 --> 16:06.467
And also that same year,

16:08.319 --> 16:13.863
Peter and I also joined up and worked on the chromosomal imbalance theory of cancer aneuploidy.

16:14.704 --> 16:15.805
And we've published a lot.

16:15.845 --> 16:21.189
We've published a lot on AIDS together and a lot on cancer together and books and things.

16:21.349 --> 16:24.071
Like I say, if you want to know more about that, go to the website.

16:25.893 --> 16:30.056
Jay and I have some more pertinent things to discuss today.

16:31.059 --> 16:35.401
than that, and I just, Jay, I just saw your red pill thing today.

16:35.441 --> 16:36.181
I'm glad I did.

16:36.341 --> 16:36.981
Oh, very good.

16:37.001 --> 16:54.568
I found it, and I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed it, and I couldn't find a single thing to disagree with, you know, that I said, oh my goodness, he got it wrong, and all that sort of thing, you know, or have, not really wrong, but, you know, I have a different view or a different opinion or whatever.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.229
Well, that makes me feel very good.

16:56.269 --> 16:57.649
Thank you very much for that compliment.

16:57.669 --> 16:58.350
I appreciate that.

16:59.330 --> 16:59.490
Yeah.

17:00.160 --> 17:06.383
And so I've been fighting the AIDS stuff since 1985, actually.

17:08.684 --> 17:19.389
And I think the thing that I think Jay and I, leave it up to you, but we really need to talk about what's going on now.

17:19.869 --> 17:29.393
Jay, you're a warrior, I'm a warrior, and I'm gonna be talking about other warriors, people that I knew either personally

17:30.362 --> 17:37.905
or professionally, for example, like Kerry Mullis was a friend of mine, the inventor of polymerase chain reaction.

17:39.485 --> 17:42.066
And he, a curious thing happened.

17:42.106 --> 17:57.252
He was the, probably the most credentialed combination of credentialed, he's Nobel Laureate, outspoken critic of Anthony Fauci, started with the AIDS stuff.

17:58.183 --> 18:00.264
And unfortunately, Kerry died in August 2019.

18:02.785 --> 18:16.032
And I guess the second most, it's almost neck and neck tie of outspoken critics, credentialed outspoken critics of Fauci is Professor Peter Duisburg, a friend of mine, my colleague.

18:17.153 --> 18:20.915
And he was going to meet with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:20.935 --> 18:21.255
for supper.

18:26.109 --> 18:29.913
in 2021, and a couple of days before that, he had a stroke.

18:30.873 --> 18:31.574
Pretty bad stroke.

18:31.594 --> 18:32.635
He's recovering now.

18:33.836 --> 18:37.959
And then we had Luc Montagnier, another Nobel laureate.

18:37.979 --> 18:41.162
He got the Nobel Prize for discovering HIV.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.324
And he died February 2022.

18:44.905 --> 18:54.553
Now you have, these are the three most potent and credentialed critics of Anthony Fauci.

18:55.689 --> 19:08.157
And I personally am very, very skeptical or suspicious about the timing of these deaths, the two deaths and the stroke of Peter Duesberg.

19:08.757 --> 19:24.727
If you were Anthony Fauci and if you wanted to keep the PCR thing going, you'd want to get rid of, silence somehow, the three most credentialed critics of the principal public criminal, which is Anthony Fauci,

19:27.451 --> 19:30.543
They've been fighting Fauci, at least Peter and I have, for decades.

19:31.760 --> 19:36.443
And two Nobel laureates and Peter Duisburg, a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

19:36.463 --> 19:39.124
So I have to get that off my chest right off the bat.

19:39.204 --> 19:45.988
I would just add that there is a Canadian guy named Plummer who also worked on HIV that died right at the beginning of the pandemic.

19:47.388 --> 19:55.492
And there was this airplane that got shot down over Ukraine that had a lot of AIDS experts from the Netherlands on it.

19:55.552 --> 19:59.194
And they all died in one airplane also, which might have been 2019 as well.

20:01.529 --> 20:02.750
That's new to me.

20:03.090 --> 20:07.551
I think I might have heard of the other guy, but I don't know anything about him, but I didn't hear about the airplane.

20:07.591 --> 20:15.654
Yeah, the airplane had at least four prominent Dutch people and their lab mates or their postdocs.

20:15.734 --> 20:16.714
It was pretty hardcore.

20:18.495 --> 20:18.675
Yeah.

20:19.055 --> 20:24.697
Well, I encourage your viewers to see your talk at the Red Pill.

20:24.897 --> 20:27.017
I gave a talk at Red Pill, I think it was 2021.

20:29.577 --> 20:40.081
on the link, going all the way back, those decades, all the way back to Anthony Fauci, when he started with AIDS, and then it moved on all these other phony pandemic plagues or whatever.

20:40.221 --> 20:49.925
I wonder if you can tell, if this will not be too boring of a story, I have this pressing question that I've been wanting to ask you since I realized that we were gonna be in contact.

20:50.565 --> 20:57.248
Can you kind of relate at the time, was there ever

20:59.102 --> 21:11.485
just doubt in, in when, when did the doubt in viruses versus the doubt in particular claims about like, I mean, how does that all wrap in with the discovery of reverse transcriptase?

21:11.545 --> 21:15.526
Because you know, they use that enzyme to indicate something or not indicate something.

21:16.106 --> 21:22.088
When did the skepticism of virology start versus skepticism of their use of it?

21:22.208 --> 21:24.068
And how can we navigate?

21:24.108 --> 21:25.408
That's where I feel like I'm at.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.069
Yeah.

21:26.249 --> 21:26.449
Yeah.

21:26.749 --> 21:26.909
Yeah.

21:28.632 --> 21:33.615
Yeah, I mean, I was as mainstream as you could get up until about 1985.

21:34.675 --> 21:48.903
I just moved to San Francisco in 1980 from Abbott Laboratories in North Chicago, Illinois, to set up my first little biotech company in the San Francisco Bay Area.

21:49.783 --> 21:55.487
And of course, that year, 1980, was when the AIDS stuff started and everything, but it didn't have that name.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.127
And I've told this story

21:58.941 --> 21:59.722
countless times.

22:00.322 --> 22:11.911
But I was as mainstream as you could get until 1984 is when it was, let's see, Reagan's end of his first term in office.

22:13.272 --> 22:20.378
And they were afraid that the Democrats would make AIDS a campaign issue since Reagan had talked about it.

22:20.398 --> 22:23.580
So Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services,

22:24.226 --> 22:28.668
was brought out April 23rd, 1984 at a press conference, brought out Robert Gallo.

22:29.729 --> 22:33.251
And they said he was discovered the probable cause of AIDS.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.832
It was one of his retroviruses.

22:35.872 --> 22:38.073
And they dropped the word probable the very next day.

22:39.134 --> 22:44.837
And all of the dogmas about AIDS became a government policy that day.

22:45.217 --> 22:47.999
AIDS was contagious, sexually transmitted, started in Africa.

22:50.076 --> 22:59.540
It's weird when they show you that it's weird when they show that video that it doesn't seem possible that that was it But that was really it just that press conference and the day later.

22:59.600 --> 23:17.626
It's that's that's the reality That's reality and say I'm not a virologist or anything like that I'm a chemist and I was working on tissue destroying diseases and I assume these people knew what in the world they were talking about so I I started you know, once I found out retroviruses have Mattel Oh have a spiral protease.

23:17.706 --> 23:18.666
I've started designing

23:19.198 --> 23:23.261
inhibitors for that, but I stopped quickly because I remembered I had a friend at Abbott.

23:23.781 --> 23:28.484
He had 20 chemists working on human aspartyl proteases, and I figured he was way ahead of me, and he was.

23:29.324 --> 23:40.871
But I sort of bought it hook, line, and sinker right there, because I figured if it was a national broadcast from, I guess, from the White House or wherever it was, there must be something to it.

23:41.672 --> 23:42.572
But guess what?

23:42.693 --> 23:43.813
There was nothing published.

23:43.833 --> 23:48.276
When I started looking into it, there was not a single paper in the scientific literature

23:48.971 --> 23:51.993
published on that until later, until after that press conference, you know.

23:53.594 --> 24:05.660
And then in 1985, about a year later, when I was really looking into this contagious component, it was clear that AIDS, what was called AIDS, had nothing to do with contagious disease.

24:05.740 --> 24:13.925
It did not have a single property about it, aspect about it, that made it a contagious thing.

24:14.065 --> 24:18.447
And I brought that up with my colleagues, and of course they all shut up and wouldn't talk about it.

24:19.497 --> 24:21.518
That was sort of what I call my red pill moment.

24:21.558 --> 24:22.818
That's the phrase these days.

24:24.259 --> 24:29.201
And then I really did a deep dive into this, and I have been ever since 1985.

24:30.762 --> 24:39.625
And I learned about Peter Duesberg around, oh, 87 or so when he had that paper, his famous paper criticizing retroviruses in general.

24:40.946 --> 24:49.089
And then I really accepted everything about contagious diseases and viruses until I'd say, after I joined it with Peter,

24:50.439 --> 24:55.062
And I was at UC Berkeley and I went to a seminar there.

24:55.262 --> 24:57.364
This was probably 97 or so.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.486
And I saw an epidemiologist, a professor there.

25:02.147 --> 25:08.131
He went through the history or the timing of these plagues.

25:08.191 --> 25:12.934
It didn't have to be virology, but contagious disease in general.

25:13.527 --> 25:15.068
There were three of them during World War Two.

25:15.389 --> 25:21.994
Every war, every war or global catastrophe, whatever, there's some sort of disruption where people get sick.

25:22.074 --> 25:26.878
You know, the environment's destroyed, the food's destroyed, the poison's everywhere.

25:27.899 --> 25:30.522
And it was whooping cough and polio.

25:30.582 --> 25:32.043
And I forget there was the third one here.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.345
It was going on during World War Two in the United States.

25:35.561 --> 25:41.308
And he showed the time of these infectious diseases in the United States.

25:41.388 --> 25:43.550
It showed during World War II, they were very, very high.

25:44.411 --> 25:53.141
And then almost overnight, after World War II ended, there was this rapid decline in all three of these.

25:53.322 --> 25:56.165
I only remember the two, the whooping cough and the polio.

25:57.285 --> 26:09.855
And had they not brought out the stock vaccine in the mid-50s or sometime in the 50s, polio and the whooping cough had almost totally disappeared before the vaccine came out.

26:10.876 --> 26:17.141
And one of the very few things that the CDC ever did that was a benefit to human beings that I'm aware of

26:18.126 --> 26:32.094
was that they discovered that the natural decline in polio cases stopped, right, it coincidentally stopped, the natural decline stopped when they went out with the Salk vaccine.

26:32.874 --> 26:41.919
So then they immediately, I was young in those days, but I was around, I remember this, immediately they came out with another one, the Sabin vaccine to replace the Salk vaccine.

26:43.944 --> 26:55.310
And then the natural decline in polio that was almost off scale before the Salk vaccine was there, then it went ahead and on its own disappeared.

26:55.991 --> 27:03.675
And they gave credit to the vaccine, to the Sabin vaccine, of something that was going away on its own, and also the whooping cough.

27:04.375 --> 27:07.557
And then I said, hey, there's something really fishy going on here.

27:08.334 --> 27:13.897
And now I have no confidence at all that there is such a thing as a viral disease.

27:13.917 --> 27:16.318
That's not to say that there's not such a thing as a virus.

27:16.398 --> 27:17.718
I have not concluded that yet.

27:18.999 --> 27:25.662
I am satisfied that there are these things called exosomes that for all the world look like viruses.

27:26.982 --> 27:31.204
And you talked about it in your red pill thing.

27:31.304 --> 27:35.766
And I've been studying those things for a while as an outsider, not as a professional.

27:37.486 --> 27:39.429
you know, what you said made perfect sense.

27:40.310 --> 27:49.522
And so then I, what I did instead of just jumping to conclusion that there was no such thing as viruses, I took them one at a time, all these viral diseases.

27:50.403 --> 27:51.985
And I looked at the time course.

27:52.836 --> 27:54.097
And I didn't find one.

27:54.177 --> 27:55.497
I don't care if it's smallpox.

27:55.537 --> 27:56.658
I don't care what it was.

27:57.138 --> 28:03.401
There was not a single disease, the so-called viral disease, that didn't have that sort of same thing.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.502
It peaked and it went away on its own.

28:05.522 --> 28:08.603
And vaccines had nothing to do with it.

28:09.437 --> 28:14.159
So then finally, I concluded that I didn't exhaust it.

28:14.219 --> 28:16.220
I did it one viral disease at a time.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.601
And finally, I could not discover an exception.

28:20.241 --> 28:25.803
So I just said, the simplest thing is that there is no evidence for viral diseases.

28:25.843 --> 28:36.427
There's no evidence that a vaccine has ever prevented a spread of viral diseases or had any effect at all on a viral disease.

28:37.047 --> 28:37.888
And now here it is.

28:39.585 --> 28:48.034
2024, and for a couple of years now, I'm comfortable saying that there's no such thing as a viral disease.

28:48.054 --> 28:49.275
There's certainly no evidence for it.

28:50.242 --> 28:51.282
And to me, that's good enough.

28:51.302 --> 28:56.023
Whether viruses exist or not, who cares if they don't cause disease?

28:56.163 --> 28:57.504
So I've been going on and on.

28:58.464 --> 29:00.364
We'll go someplace else with that if you want to.

29:00.784 --> 29:01.304
Yeah, I know.

29:01.324 --> 29:13.847
I guess for me, it's been a real journey to try and look backwards and see and try to figure out who were the granddaddies that needed to insist.

29:14.447 --> 29:16.788
I really feel like David Baltimore's got to know.

29:18.629 --> 29:29.397
and just insists that his scheme of viruses is right, and there are these double-stranded and single-stranded and positive and negative-stranded and all this stuff.

29:30.298 --> 29:33.841
And in reality, he's got to know that these things don't hold up.

29:34.601 --> 29:37.584
I'll get off viruses after I just mention this.

29:38.544 --> 29:42.628
The thing that has really come to my attention over the pandemic is the

29:43.448 --> 30:10.443
absolute expansion of these really powerful and cheap sequencing technologies and how scared virology is to adjust their methodologies for that so that they, you know, maybe just revisit a few assumptions and see what you find out and use these extremely cheap and high resolution sequencing things so you can show us how this really works and they just don't do it.

30:11.964 --> 30:18.893
They're happy to rest on the assumptions that they basically have been doing experiments with since the 70s or even earlier.

30:20.595 --> 30:24.620
So we met through a court case where

30:26.651 --> 30:32.294
An entire city in California was sequencing, well, let's not say that.

30:32.354 --> 30:40.579
Let's say they were swabbing or requiring saliva samples from their municipal employees every week.

30:42.179 --> 30:52.025
And in this case, coincidentally or not, I don't know, it seems highly unlikely that a city in California would just choose a guy who

30:52.665 --> 30:55.588
has another career as a porn movie producer.

30:55.608 --> 31:09.601
But anyway, the same basic scam, I'm just wondering if it's molecularly actually even a simpler scam that they're pulling on us now than they ever tried to pull with AIDS.

31:12.138 --> 31:24.648
And for that, what I mean is that they had 10 years since the first SARS to go and test to see if they could make a, I don't know, find a background signal that would be useful for this.

31:25.328 --> 31:33.435
And then they could make molecular tools that did work, but misconstrued them as what they were working to show us.

31:34.950 --> 31:55.123
And anyway, we've looked at this test, at least the one that we've seen, and what's very interesting about it is that I feel like we actually came in late enough so that the court can kind of avoid both of our expertise, or at least is trying to avoid it.

31:56.144 --> 32:02.688
Is there any parallel to this in your mind, or is it easier or harder than what they did in AIDS, or am I just being silly?

32:04.659 --> 32:06.940
No, well, I know where you're heading with that.

32:07.201 --> 32:08.641
I've watched this over the decades.

32:09.522 --> 32:15.045
And, you know, there I've looked all for HIV.

32:15.065 --> 32:15.966
That was the first one.

32:16.806 --> 32:25.091
There is clearly absolutely no evidence, whatever, that there is such a thing as HIV that I'm absolutely certain of.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.472
And I knew that before I doubted viruses.

32:27.652 --> 32:27.933
Wow.

32:28.113 --> 32:33.556
I was just looking for the evidence, you know, and there was no evidence, zero evidence for it.

32:33.676 --> 32:33.876
All right.

32:34.762 --> 32:37.424
and the only test for it was the antibody test.

32:37.805 --> 32:44.170
They had that and then they had the western blot and then they had the PCR thing came out in the 90s with David Ho.

32:45.131 --> 32:49.395
And if you look at, if you download, it was, you know,

32:51.172 --> 33:01.245
Kerry Mullis's PCR, but David Ho used the polymerase chain reaction, which is just a manufacturing technique, really, or you can use it for purposes.

33:01.705 --> 33:06.331
But it's absolutely not usable for diagnosing an infectious disease.

33:07.302 --> 33:10.123
And let me tell you something before I forget.

33:10.763 --> 33:20.107
When I was looking at those first papers, like the Wu study in 2020, where they did the isolation, they so-called put it in quotes and everything, I read the thing.

33:20.787 --> 33:22.067
They never isolated anything.

33:22.088 --> 33:24.949
They never even attempted to isolate anything.

33:25.769 --> 33:31.571
And that metatranscriptomic stuff that they were doing, you know, I mean, it's all technology now.

33:31.611 --> 33:33.812
There's no biology to this stuff.

33:34.918 --> 33:43.485
And the technology took over in the 80s with AIDS, where they, like with HIV, there was never any HIV there.

33:44.185 --> 33:51.791
And then from that point on, Anthony Fauci is there at the NIAID, and there was never, they never worried about viruses since then, they had the PCR.

33:52.552 --> 34:02.039
And if you download the inserts that come with the HIV test, doesn't matter which one you pick, PCR, the antibody,

34:02.851 --> 34:13.239
They tell you right in the insert that there's no recognized reference standard for the test, which means there's no virus there.

34:14.100 --> 34:14.380
All right.

34:14.840 --> 34:20.965
And they say this test cannot be used to diagnose the presence of HIV or AIDS.

34:23.066 --> 34:25.428
And that's how we won a lot of court cases.

34:26.008 --> 34:32.153
I've been involved in around 50, 50 plus, something like that, court cases, as expert witness.

34:32.768 --> 34:34.910
on the HIV stuff, mostly.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.693
And we won most of those cases.

34:38.273 --> 34:47.782
I forget how many states had criminal laws for people who knowingly exposed somebody else to HIV.

34:47.882 --> 34:52.126
Most states, I think it's probably still in the books, those criminal cases.

34:53.684 --> 35:01.274
And we won most of those cases just by using the evidence of the package inserts that came with it.

35:02.076 --> 35:03.898
They would drop it before it even went to trial.

35:04.058 --> 35:10.907
And then when it went to trial, it was even worse for them because then we got to go there on the witness stand and show the evidence.

35:11.803 --> 35:17.024
you know, to the judges or who's ever was in there, jury or whatever, you know.

35:17.164 --> 35:20.705
So then there's this whole... To this day, the same is true with SARS-CoV-2.

35:20.765 --> 35:22.705
The CDC doesn't have any SARS.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.325
Nobody does.

35:23.665 --> 35:23.825
No.

35:23.905 --> 35:24.425
Nobody has it.

35:24.445 --> 35:26.746
No MERS, no Zika, no Ebola.

35:27.366 --> 35:37.688
Somewhere in there, though, somewhere in there, they were able to slip in this idea that they can find a sequence in the wild and then they can make it.

35:38.408 --> 35:38.848
And that's...

35:39.998 --> 35:48.100
I realized early on, I'm interrupting because you reminded me of this.

35:49.340 --> 36:00.662
Early on, when I looked at that Wu paper and the metatranscriptomics, I told myself when I looked how they did it, they had to know what they were looking for before they ever started.

36:01.683 --> 36:05.083
Because logically, it made no sense to do that.

36:05.523 --> 36:07.784
And then in your talk,

36:08.607 --> 36:12.508
that you've made that same point, but even more forcefully.

36:12.568 --> 36:21.831
I forget exactly the words you used, but you started off this discussion a little bit with it about how they use known sequences.

36:21.851 --> 36:24.732
I believe that's what you said, known sequences of coronavirus.

36:25.773 --> 36:28.193
And which I think you're absolutely right.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.274
I think you're absolutely right.

36:29.334 --> 36:33.715
I think they were looking for a coronavirus from the beginning.

36:34.155 --> 36:35.256
I didn't use those words.

36:36.041 --> 36:41.827
But I said to myself, they knew what they wanted to find before they started.

36:42.408 --> 36:42.968
Yeah.

36:43.089 --> 36:52.659
And for me, it's you know, it would be very easy for me to believe that that even the at this stage, I got to really be honest with you, there's really very few.

36:54.858 --> 37:04.481
working experts in coronavirus virology that actually go out into the wild and find them and claim to do this kind of cave virology.

37:05.301 --> 37:14.043
And Ralph Baric really feels to me like somebody that the government set up to create this illusion.

37:14.163 --> 37:19.645
I was gonna make this point, maybe now is a good time to make it.

37:19.665 --> 37:21.846
I'm just gonna start showing you books, okay?

37:22.226 --> 37:22.926
This is crazy.

37:24.744 --> 37:27.748
Now, this is a book about chemistry.

37:28.048 --> 37:28.789
See how big it is?

37:28.970 --> 37:30.992
It says chemistry on it, right?

37:32.855 --> 37:33.796
This is crazy.

37:35.018 --> 37:39.424
These three books are about medical virology, whatever that is.

37:39.784 --> 37:40.565
And then there's...

37:41.949 --> 37:45.632
This book, thick, gigantic book is called Vaccines.

37:45.712 --> 37:46.773
Look how big it is.

37:46.813 --> 37:49.955
They get bigger and bigger.

37:50.215 --> 37:52.357
Virology is actually two volumes.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.859
Field virology is actually two volumes.

37:54.919 --> 38:01.124
So it's really an expansive field of science that requires new volumes every couple of years.

38:01.764 --> 38:05.147
And then if you go further, you can find even the

38:06.761 --> 38:13.888
Holy shit, even prion disease has really, really thick, thick, thick books about prion disease.

38:14.408 --> 38:20.894
But then, what I find really shocking, plant physiology is almost like a magazine.

38:21.475 --> 38:22.816
Like, who cares?

38:23.236 --> 38:25.618
There's hardly anything to know about plants, I guess.

38:25.879 --> 38:26.579
That's weird.

38:27.927 --> 38:31.989
You know, study in the brain is also this really thin book neurobiology.

38:32.049 --> 38:34.389
It's, you know, it's, it take you a weekend or something.

38:34.429 --> 38:40.852
But I mean, if you want to get through virology, you've got a whole encyclopedia of stuff to read.

38:40.912 --> 38:52.176
And so I really, I feel as though that insistence of the depth and breadth of biology kind of belies the actual sort of fraud of it all.

38:54.117 --> 38:56.598
If it was such an expansive thing,

38:59.144 --> 39:02.346
then it cannot all be outside of us.

39:02.426 --> 39:05.627
I guess that's my point, is that they study it in a very funny way.

39:06.168 --> 39:23.877
One of the favorite things that I found in our case together, I showed it a couple of days ago on my stream, is the idea that the control for our PCR that we were looking at was a bacteriophage that had the RNA sequence, or the DNA, I don't know, RNA sequence they were looking for,

39:25.057 --> 39:27.178
And so they could make that as much as they wanted.

39:27.378 --> 39:35.899
They could make industrial quantities of that and put it anywhere they wanted to and create a perfect PCR positive.

39:37.420 --> 39:39.080
All of the techniques are available.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.160
That's the crazy part.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.301
All of these techniques are available to them.

39:43.621 --> 39:46.101
And it's cheap now to do these things.

39:46.301 --> 39:51.443
And yet they are insisting that maybe I have to take a left turn here.

39:51.763 --> 39:53.223
As a biologist and a chemist,

39:55.809 --> 40:06.455
I was recently challenged by somebody at the Red Pill Expo in the discussions that actually biochemistry is almost not taught anymore in university.

40:06.676 --> 40:15.421
And one of the problems that we have is that there's all these biologists and medical scientists and whatever, but they're actually not at all trained in biochemistry.

40:16.261 --> 40:23.664
They can be completely bewildered by the idea of molecular interactions or active sites and this kind of thing.

40:24.105 --> 40:28.026
They don't really understand the biochemistry that's happening there.

40:28.066 --> 40:40.232
And they just take the word for it of these people that almost don't exist anymore, probably like yourself, who as a biologist and a chemist and being in pharma at that time was well-trained in biochemistry.

40:40.392 --> 40:44.914
And so one of the biochemical problems that I see

40:45.814 --> 40:50.417
with a pandemic of an RNA is that there's no evidence that RNA can do that.

40:50.597 --> 40:57.061
Like it it would be very, very crazy if the wrong combination of nucleic acids could do that.

40:58.882 --> 41:07.368
Yeah, I. But biology, living things are too robust to.

41:08.469 --> 41:15.133
Think about living things have been around on this planet for billions of years, I guess, you know.

41:15.669 --> 41:23.592
life and up animals and trees and things been around, you know, for hundreds of millions of years, at least.

41:23.972 --> 41:25.252
I don't know and don't care.

41:25.292 --> 41:27.393
The point is, it's been a long, long time.

41:28.113 --> 41:31.955
And think of all the trials and tribulations that have gone on.

41:32.535 --> 41:42.698
And yet look at the, when you just go outside and you hear where we live, I live in North Carolina, all the trees and all the animal life and everything, you know, that's robust here.

41:45.971 --> 42:08.247
Well, I tell you that there's no way, this is one reason why I've convinced myself as a scientist, or confirmed it as a scientist, there's no way that something with so few genes like this little, whether you want to call it a virus or an exosome or something like that, that it's going to wreak havoc on people, you know?

42:09.446 --> 42:12.168
It just can't happen.

42:12.289 --> 42:20.895
I mean, when you look at the robustness of the innate immune system and all the backups and all the auxiliaries and all this kind of stuff, it makes no sense at all.

42:21.255 --> 42:23.717
Yeah, but it had a fear and cleavage site, though.

42:23.737 --> 42:28.540
It was a real special fear and cleavage site, so it could really, it really went fast.

42:29.381 --> 42:33.123
Oh, the point, I really, really, really liked your red pill thing.

42:34.384 --> 42:38.107
There are so many stories going on out there

42:39.002 --> 42:40.603
to keep it like what do they call it?

42:40.783 --> 42:50.050
Limited hangout, I guess, when you acknowledge some things, you know, and then you you put out this phony stuff like that.

42:50.070 --> 42:54.533
They say, oh, yeah, but it's they want to keep the viral thing here and they will be a plague.

42:54.593 --> 42:56.615
OK, or they like the argument.

42:56.855 --> 43:00.157
Well, was it manmade or was it natural or something like that?

43:00.738 --> 43:03.320
Rather than, you know, that just keeps it going.

43:03.420 --> 43:04.680
Yeah.

43:04.721 --> 43:05.901
Rather than dig deep.

43:06.081 --> 43:07.122
These people are criminals.

43:07.142 --> 43:07.983
They know what they're doing.

43:08.863 --> 43:12.828
And they've been using these strategies now for decades, if not more.

43:13.989 --> 43:16.732
But I personally know of it for decades.

43:17.433 --> 43:19.035
But it works with the people.

43:20.196 --> 43:23.941
Because it sounds like they're getting the story.

43:24.708 --> 43:29.189
They're getting bits and pieces of it, but they can't dive into it.

43:30.409 --> 43:46.172
Your discussion about CHD and RFK and things like that, I totally understand your frustration and everything, but I also understand what's going on in a different way.

43:47.653 --> 43:48.653
You and I are individuals.

43:50.074 --> 43:50.954
we're pretty free.

43:51.074 --> 44:02.839
And one reason why we're able to do and think what we are, and I had my own companies for decades, free to work with Peter and all that, I'm pretty impervious to this propaganda stuff.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.200
And I can't be bought.

44:06.601 --> 44:08.902
I'm not part of a big institution.

44:08.942 --> 44:10.182
They put pressure on me.

44:10.963 --> 44:17.005
But when you have a big organization like a CHD or a

44:17.962 --> 44:30.185
informed consent, you know, the good guys, you know, and, you know, they got pressure put on them too, from the structure of the thing that they're working on.

44:30.205 --> 44:40.607
I mean, when Kennedy tells the story, and I totally understand it, and I get it, he really didn't want to have anything to do with vaccines as being a problem.

44:41.248 --> 44:45.269
And it took those mothers to force him to read those papers.

44:45.449 --> 44:46.689
This is the story, you know,

44:47.378 --> 44:49.140
And then he got involved in this thing.

44:49.180 --> 44:54.586
So I mean, it took some badgering, you know, to do it.

44:55.206 --> 44:57.389
But now he's still part of an organization.

44:57.489 --> 44:59.391
He's running for president and things like that.

45:01.693 --> 45:06.038
He doesn't have the luxury that you and I do, or the freedom

45:06.932 --> 45:08.293
And a lot of people don't.

45:08.633 --> 45:11.156
I mean, if you're in a big corporation, OK, we understand it.

45:11.536 --> 45:26.568
But if you're in any organization that has a structure to it, has a financial base to it, you know, and you want to keep it going, I can see why you, you know, you pick your battles.

45:28.150 --> 45:35.856
You know, you and I, our job, your job and my job, as I said, we're basically soulmates in this thing.

45:36.878 --> 45:38.719
is that we don't have to worry about stuff like that.

45:38.739 --> 45:52.187
All we have to do is remain people of integrity and to own up when stuff, you know, that we don't know or we change our minds about, like, you know, I used to accept viruses.

45:52.227 --> 45:52.727
Now I don't.

45:53.768 --> 45:54.768
But I can afford to do that.

45:55.008 --> 45:55.989
That's what scientists do.

45:56.009 --> 46:00.411
We change our minds all the time, you know, if given reasons to do that.

46:01.452 --> 46:04.073
But institutions, people or institutions, you know,

46:05.299 --> 46:11.923
Maybe they can personally, but they're hamstrung by the institution that they're in.

46:12.523 --> 46:15.985
So I guess what I'm saying is, I understand.

46:16.286 --> 46:17.046
I'll shut up and let you.

46:17.366 --> 46:17.866
No, no, no.

46:17.906 --> 46:18.507
I'm sorry.

46:18.547 --> 46:19.487
I wasn't going to cut you off.

46:19.547 --> 46:20.928
I just wanted to say that you're right.

46:20.988 --> 46:24.590
I mean, for me, I really fought hard against this.

46:24.650 --> 46:25.811
I got to be very honest.

46:25.911 --> 46:26.792
I thought

46:28.064 --> 46:37.086
I still think, I was told, I bought, I thought I was using adenovirus to transform my mice and do optogenetics.

46:37.146 --> 46:42.347
And so I thought I knew what viruses were and how they could be used as a tool on the bench.

46:43.727 --> 46:51.569
And so when they said they were gonna use them as a investigational vaccine, I was already like, yeah, I don't think that's okay.

46:51.589 --> 46:57.710
Like I can use it in my mice, but I wouldn't be putting a foreign protein into the body of my grandma.

46:59.786 --> 47:15.480
But for me, that did not, that did not equate to me ever understanding that, I mean, what part of my job would have ever made me question virology when I thought I was using an attenuated version of a virus as a tool on my bench.

47:15.581 --> 47:24.689
And so it took me a long time to understand what these people were saying when they were saying that, look, they didn't isolate anything, this stuff,

47:25.209 --> 47:42.677
is just sequences and whether these sequences even exist or not or whether they exist in the order that they're presented or whether all of this didn't, it took a long time to sink in just because I'd spent 20 years assuming that I, because I was, I don't know, baking in the kitchen that I understood chemistry.

47:43.497 --> 47:47.619
And in reality, I don't think that I did as well as I thought I did.

47:47.639 --> 47:50.861
And so now I'm in a very different place and

47:52.273 --> 48:06.883
It's crazy, I just, it's hard for me to believe that so many of you were here in the 90s when I was in high school or college, and you already knew that what I was being told in classrooms was extremely wrong.

48:08.024 --> 48:09.144
It's just shocking to me.

48:09.465 --> 48:11.106
It's still hard for me to understand.

48:12.106 --> 48:16.249
Almost on a daily basis, I'm confronting new information that is shocking.

48:16.389 --> 48:18.831
You know, really bad stuff.

48:19.178 --> 48:21.019
that has been going on for a long time.

48:21.179 --> 48:25.060
And I don't know, you know, I'm beginning to suspect just about everything.

48:25.921 --> 48:27.542
Yeah, well, absolutely.

48:27.722 --> 48:28.062
Me too.

48:28.142 --> 48:32.844
I mean, I know right now that I'm very worried for our country because it is

48:33.795 --> 48:46.559
I have grown up a multiracial American, so I never really had even a hyphenated, I couldn't even call myself Filipino-American when I was growing up, because my mom is other things as well, and I'm too tall to be a Filipino.

48:46.639 --> 48:54.822
Anyway, so I've just always thought of myself as American, and I lived for 15 years in Europe, and that made me feel that way even more.

48:54.982 --> 48:59.164
And I just, I want the truth to be told, and I'm afraid that

49:00.970 --> 49:03.313
were being given very easy out here.

49:03.333 --> 49:05.856
I don't know what's happening here.

49:05.876 --> 49:06.957
I really don't.

49:08.639 --> 49:20.093
But I know that the case that we're working on is terrifying to me because I can't believe it's probably one of hundreds if not thousands around America of similar cases where

49:20.714 --> 49:23.455
You have an absolutely fraudulent.

49:24.235 --> 49:26.816
I explained it a couple of days ago, so we don't have to do it again.

49:26.876 --> 49:31.077
They can go back and look at that stream, but it's an absolutely fraudulent.

49:31.537 --> 49:35.398
There is no attempt to make it specific for anything.

49:36.318 --> 49:39.339
There was no attempt to, to, to, to,

49:40.999 --> 49:54.702
It's just extraordinary to me when I've used PCR to try and show things, the amount of scrutiny and sort of ire you get from people when they're like, well, whatever you're pulling up here doesn't prove what you want to say.

49:55.042 --> 49:58.082
You got to do three more controls and you should do all those in triplicate.

49:58.102 --> 50:00.843
And even then you can just use a plus sign or a minus sign.

50:01.203 --> 50:05.124
You can't use a number because that's just, you're overextending your data.

50:05.164 --> 50:06.704
But then here we are looking at a,

50:07.384 --> 50:14.932
something that could have maybe put that guy out of a job, or could have made him stay home, or whatever it is they were doing with these tests.

50:16.614 --> 50:17.715
And it was based on nothing.

50:18.116 --> 50:19.477
I mean, even the

50:22.216 --> 50:31.798
The data that was, not the data, the information that was required for the EUA, the only things that we could see, we couldn't really learn anything from anything we found.

50:32.199 --> 50:46.482
I mean, the FDA might have just more or less rubber stamped anything they got in the mail saying that I'm gonna, we should have gotten into that business and we probably could have made hundreds of thousands of dollars doing nothing.

50:46.542 --> 50:48.263
We would just test nothing, who cares?

50:48.303 --> 50:48.923
I mean, we'd just,

50:49.929 --> 50:52.070
produce that 10-page document and send it in.

50:54.691 --> 50:56.071
It's extraordinary, I don't know.

50:56.872 --> 51:00.753
Well, the FDA's been a captured organization.

51:00.793 --> 51:02.434
God, I forget when it was.

51:02.594 --> 51:12.018
I have it in my book, the exact year and everything, where they allowed the pharmaceutical companies to pay the FDA.

51:12.418 --> 51:18.160
I think 60%, at least now, of the FDA's money comes from pharmaceutical industry.

51:18.755 --> 51:32.958
And I distinctly remember when that year or two after they passed that, that somebody at the FDA boasted that they now consider the FDA a virtual drug company, you know.

51:33.818 --> 51:37.439
So, I mean, the people that work there, they know what's going on.

51:37.819 --> 51:43.720
Oh, I mean, another little story, has nothing to do with this one, but it has to do with the area of cancer.

51:44.420 --> 51:46.701
And that's because I worked in that for many years now.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.621
And I delved into it really deep.

51:51.141 --> 51:56.125
And it's a big money area, just like infectious diseases, as we know, big money areas.

51:57.045 --> 52:07.433
And it's very clear that the big name people in cancer research, they all know, and they've said it in print,

52:10.945 --> 52:15.889
And I've got the quotes of them, that they know that the gene mutations do not cause cancer.

52:16.750 --> 52:19.573
They know that gene mutation theory does not work.

52:19.673 --> 52:24.858
And they can get away with it like that because they don't go public on television or anything.

52:25.399 --> 52:27.761
And they got these big names and they still get the grant money.

52:28.021 --> 52:31.945
They still write grants for these things and work on it.

52:32.537 --> 52:42.982
But they admit it, and they admit it in big, huge books like you're talking about that you held up on cancer, and in the papers and their talks, they know it doesn't work.

52:43.403 --> 52:50.546
It's wrong, but it keeps going, and they stay in it, you know?

52:51.427 --> 52:56.849
Somebody offers them a lot of money to start up another company or something, and they will do that for gene mutations.

52:57.430 --> 53:01.492
So my guess is that science in general

53:02.367 --> 53:07.233
is probably corrupt to its core, especially if it's big buck science.

53:07.513 --> 53:08.914
Yeah, absolutely.

53:08.955 --> 53:17.764
And I think that at the heart of this, I want to call you Dr. Rasnick, but if you don't mind, I call you David.

53:18.957 --> 53:20.658
I like Dave myself.

53:20.738 --> 53:21.358
I prefer that.

53:22.058 --> 53:32.603
I was just talking to someone yesterday who was kind of pivoting to this ivermectin cures cancer, and it's because cancer is caused by parasites or intracellular parasites.

53:32.643 --> 53:35.824
And there is a lot of people that are saying this now.

53:36.205 --> 53:39.346
And I mean, do you want to comment on that?

53:39.406 --> 53:42.948
Is that as crazy as it sounds, or is that actually not so crazy?

53:42.988 --> 53:43.488
I heard that too.

53:43.728 --> 53:47.470
I didn't hear about the parasite thing, but I did hear that people were using ivermectin

53:49.112 --> 53:49.892
treat cancer.

53:50.053 --> 53:55.995
I don't know if that's because it's turbo cancer business is going on and ivermectin is hot now, popular and all that.

53:58.316 --> 54:00.657
I can't say anything confirmatory.

54:00.857 --> 54:02.117
I'm very, very suspicious.

54:04.078 --> 54:05.919
I don't think it can cure cancer.

54:05.979 --> 54:11.421
It might do some symptoms but from what I know about cancer, there is no molecule

54:12.648 --> 54:13.388
that will stop it.

54:13.649 --> 54:15.650
There is no molecule that will stop cancer.

54:15.990 --> 54:18.431
No five or 10 molecules that will stop cancer.

54:19.672 --> 54:20.992
So that I'm certain of.

54:22.013 --> 54:28.897
It may have some benefits, help your body be a little bit more healthy.

54:29.757 --> 54:38.662
I mean, I could go on and on and on about this, but you know, when I hear stuff like that, there's so many things like that, I just drop it because that's just,

54:40.330 --> 54:42.312
right now to me with no substance.

54:42.552 --> 54:49.337
I mean, is one of the weaknesses of that though, that should we be thinking of it still as this umbrella term cancer?

54:49.357 --> 54:54.700
Or are we really talking about a wide variety of cellular dysfunction in one great big?

54:55.080 --> 55:04.467
Oh, I tell you, I highly recommend to people watching this, go to my website, have tons of stuff on cancer.

55:04.687 --> 55:06.308
And I even have it on my homepage.

55:07.045 --> 55:10.426
The book that I published for cancer researchers is technical.

55:10.806 --> 55:15.128
They've been dropping links in my chat, so that's already available to them.

55:15.148 --> 55:15.408
All right.

55:15.608 --> 55:17.169
Yeah.

55:17.389 --> 55:19.570
But it's got 1,100 references.

55:19.790 --> 55:23.111
And if you could feel like diving deep into it, that's great.

55:23.891 --> 55:27.513
I am trying to get a book published for the general public.

55:28.093 --> 55:32.474
I call it The Outsider's Advantage, A Personal Odyssey into the Essence of Cancer.

55:32.514 --> 55:34.175
It's sort of a plain language

55:34.958 --> 55:42.362
explanation for the public at large, basically tells the same story, but a much larger story than just cancer.

55:42.382 --> 55:44.783
It's about the whole pharmaceutical industrial thing.

55:44.803 --> 55:45.183
Wow.

55:45.323 --> 55:46.424
How far are you on it?

55:46.544 --> 55:48.005
I mean, do you have a draft ready?

55:48.745 --> 55:49.646
I'll be, I do.

55:50.066 --> 55:52.207
I mean, the text is finished.

55:52.767 --> 55:55.308
I'd be happy to send you a PDF of it.

55:55.729 --> 55:56.009
Wow.

55:56.269 --> 55:58.210
It's got table contents.

55:58.910 --> 56:02.352
I'm still working on, I'm about 80% done with the bibliography.

56:03.257 --> 56:05.319
And I'm trying to find a publisher.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.321
Have you heard of Celia Farber?

56:08.481 --> 56:10.162
She's one of the AIDS warriors.

56:10.202 --> 56:11.583
She's a very, very good friend of mine.

56:11.623 --> 56:12.944
She's trying to help me get it published.

56:12.964 --> 56:15.505
But it's hard to get anything published these days.

56:16.086 --> 56:17.907
She should have connections.

56:18.848 --> 56:19.088
Yeah.

56:19.288 --> 56:22.370
And she's got so many irons in the fire.

56:23.111 --> 56:25.952
She's one of these warriors that goes back to the 80s, I tell you.

56:26.113 --> 56:27.273
She's something else.

56:29.269 --> 56:31.650
So, I mean, there's so, you know what we need to do?

56:32.250 --> 56:37.813
We need to do another one of these things so we can focus on individual things.

56:37.833 --> 56:44.175
Because you and I as scientists, it'd be very interesting for us to have a conversation more focused.

56:44.215 --> 56:50.798
Right now, I think we're doing the right thing, getting to know each other, cover these big picture general topics and everything.

56:51.478 --> 56:53.479
But, you know, scientists love to talk.

56:53.539 --> 56:55.380
Don't trust a scientist that won't talk to you.

56:56.240 --> 56:58.481
And you and I are scientists.

56:58.877 --> 57:06.460
And I would love to get into the weeds, as some people say, with some of these topics.

57:06.520 --> 57:10.201
I'd love to talk to you in detail about cancer, because it's such a fascinating thing.

57:10.862 --> 57:19.245
But just really, really quick, just for the folks, I didn't discover the true cause of cancer.

57:19.305 --> 57:26.187
This was actually done by David Hanselman and Theodore Boveri back in the turn of the late 19th, early 20th century.

57:28.331 --> 57:37.237
Theodore Bovary wrote a book in 1914 about this and I got it translated in English and he was right on.

57:37.297 --> 57:47.965
He actually had to do with chromosomal imbalance and David Hanselman used a microscope and looked at cancerous tissue and all the cancer cells were different.

57:47.985 --> 57:49.806
They all had different combinations of chromosomes.

57:49.826 --> 57:52.969
Theodore Bovary provided a theoretical explanation

57:54.022 --> 57:57.591
And he was right, I'd say at least 95%, maybe 98%.

57:57.791 --> 58:03.284
I can't think of anything really substantial that he got wrong in that book.

58:04.059 --> 58:19.595
And then Peter and I, when we joined up in 96, he went that year into 96 on a sabbatical because he lost his grant funding from the NIH because of his opposition to the HIV stuff.

58:20.135 --> 58:27.423
Went on his very first sabbatical in Germany to work on what the aneuploidy theory of cancer, what Theodore Boveri's

58:28.377 --> 58:44.588
idea and Peters is a researcher wanted to do experimental work on it to sort of confirm it and I did the theoretical stuff I know a lot about enzyme kinetics and things like that and and I looked up the literature and everything and he and I together Proved Bavaria was right.

58:44.648 --> 58:53.954
We published a lot of a lot of stuff on that and that book that I that's on my website for cancer researchers that's got it all in there and I

58:54.878 --> 58:58.962
We had three very successful international conferences on this.

58:59.943 --> 59:03.146
And so, you know, we did, we nailed it.

59:03.466 --> 59:04.307
We know what it is.

59:05.208 --> 59:09.732
And the other people, the gene mutation people know what it's not.

59:09.812 --> 59:11.013
It's not gene mutations.

59:11.794 --> 59:18.080
And I think they have a pretty good suspicion that we're right about the aneuploidy stuff, but they can't really talk about it.

59:18.672 --> 59:22.335
And I'd love to have another one of these where we can go into detail.

59:22.355 --> 59:27.739
Is aneuploidy, is that more than, more than or less than the normal number?

59:27.939 --> 59:28.459
It's both.

59:28.599 --> 59:30.441
It's an imbalance of chromosomes.

59:30.541 --> 59:30.841
Okay.

59:31.541 --> 59:38.626
It turns out that a loss of, a gain of chromosomes is more survivable than a loss of chromosomes.

59:39.827 --> 59:44.491
But an imbalance of chromosomes is always dangerous for the health of a cell.

59:44.511 --> 59:47.573
They almost always die at some point as they try to progress.

59:48.689 --> 01:00:00.661
It's really weird because I held this book up before because I'm almost sure that there are examples of this in plant physiology that the plants are really crazy with their chromosomes and they have.

01:00:00.721 --> 01:00:01.221
Oh, they are.

01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:05.626
And so they really do some nutty things when their chromosomes change.

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:10.491
So it's an interesting sort of, hmm, could be a reflection there somehow.

01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:11.992
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

01:00:12.032 --> 01:00:17.996
I really haven't looked into plants much, but I know that they're very, very interesting things, and I should look at them.

01:00:18.577 --> 01:00:19.177
I really should.

01:00:19.577 --> 01:00:28.844
Yeah, my wife was a plant PhD, and for the time that we were courting in Amsterdam, I tried to get into it a little bit, but the genetics are just so baffling.

01:00:28.884 --> 01:00:30.865
I made myself look like a fool.

01:00:31.165 --> 01:00:39.011
At some point, I just surrendered to the fact that I study simple eukaryotes, like, you know, just mice, that's it, nothing else.

01:00:41.132 --> 01:00:44.193
I can't do the higher plants.

01:00:44.613 --> 01:00:48.295
And they might be related because they have nuclei, but that's about it.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:48.735
I don't know.

01:00:49.475 --> 01:00:51.276
They have lots of chromosomes.

01:00:51.296 --> 01:00:53.056
Plants have lots of chromosomes.

01:00:53.757 --> 01:00:53.957
Yeah.

01:00:54.217 --> 01:01:01.699
And they go through haploid and diploid and quadriploid states, so it can be really, really complicated.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:05.941
And all these people know how to breed them, which I find absolutely fascinating.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:10.922
As long as they stay balanced, as long as the chromosomes stay balanced, life is possible.

01:01:11.162 --> 01:01:24.367
So interestingly enough, you know, there's a couple of these futurist transhuman people that are really interested in adding artificial chromosomes so that they can, you know, boost functionality or add genes.

01:01:24.427 --> 01:01:29.389
And that sounds like you're saying that that's not going to be so easy as just squirming in there.

01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:30.550
I'm not worried about that.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:32.931
These idiots.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.952
I mean, these people, I mean, they're idiots.

01:01:36.132 --> 01:01:38.557
They think that, I mean, think about it.

01:01:38.597 --> 01:01:44.949
You and I, both scientists, think of the work, the effort it takes to do something, to understand something.

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:51.918
And it's just a progress, you know, you make progress and then you pull back, you fail here and you fail there.

01:01:52.418 --> 01:02:00.982
These people are talking like, man, it's at their fingertips right now, they're gonna do this, they're gonna, you know, they clearly have not a clue what they're talking about.

01:02:01.002 --> 01:02:06.164
I am not worried about any successes on their part.

01:02:07.364 --> 01:02:10.806
One thing, they can't build anything, not really, but they can destroy things.

01:02:11.274 --> 01:02:15.202
Wow, that's a very dark but exalient point for sure.

01:02:15.222 --> 01:02:15.783
Wow.

01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:21.578
They can't build things, but they can definitely destroy things.

01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:22.939
That is something.

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:28.303
Almost everything we know about the brain is from lesion studies, right?

01:02:28.323 --> 01:02:29.444
I mean, they can break stuff.

01:02:29.524 --> 01:02:30.124
That's for sure.

01:02:30.204 --> 01:02:30.805
That's right.

01:02:31.265 --> 01:02:33.967
If something goes wrong, then you compare it with something that's normal.

01:02:34.027 --> 01:02:35.428
That's about how you learn.

01:02:35.528 --> 01:02:36.129
Yeah, right.

01:02:36.389 --> 01:02:36.969
Right, right.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:42.353
So what is the way out, do you think?

01:02:42.413 --> 01:02:45.916
I mean, you must have been thinking about this for a long time.

01:02:45.976 --> 01:02:46.716
I mean, obviously,

01:02:47.877 --> 01:02:54.181
Social media isn't helping us I Have been thinking about it a long time.

01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:55.722
I on my website.

01:02:55.742 --> 01:03:12.474
I'm looking at it right now I have a couple little articles on there like on the on the home page The tyranny of dogma is one but out of kilter out of kilter is a little article that I wrote To

01:03:15.141 --> 01:03:18.623
had to do with the AIDS stuff, about how everything was kind of wrong.

01:03:18.683 --> 01:03:23.965
I could see society was going in a really bad place with all the AIDS stuff and everything, and about how it got there.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:28.447
And I put in a few thoughts about how to fix it.

01:03:29.648 --> 01:03:38.052
And it wasn't that I thought that you could fix it anytime soon, but only if there was some magic involved.

01:03:39.092 --> 01:03:40.733
And now, oddly enough,

01:03:41.463 --> 01:03:52.149
since these people that are talking about build back better, what that implies, a lot of people don't understand, what that implies is you have to bulldoze things.

01:03:52.689 --> 01:03:57.892
You have to destroy what's present before you can build back.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:01.214
See, there it is, out of kilter, tyranny of dogma.

01:04:01.434 --> 01:04:02.615
Oh yeah, right here, okay.

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:04.596
Yeah, right there, those little things.

01:04:08.218 --> 01:04:09.678
Those are downloadable too.

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:10.819
I try to have

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.630
Most of my stuff is downloadable if I have it.

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.512
And wow, man, I mean, yeah, it's awesome.

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:19.272
This is awesome.

01:04:19.853 --> 01:04:20.973
Yeah, I'm excited.

01:04:21.614 --> 01:04:36.282
So then I was thinking, you know, that when I realized that they that they are in the process of destroying society, destroying everything, destroying businesses, destroying infrastructure, they want to wipe out large fractions of the population.

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:40.618
And they're well on the way of doing that right now.

01:04:41.018 --> 01:04:41.859
Just chaos.

01:04:42.019 --> 01:04:44.459
I mean, we haven't seen anything yet, I'm afraid.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.421
You know, it's going to get a lot worse really fast, I'm afraid, especially this fall.

01:04:50.982 --> 01:04:59.844
If the predictions and what they want to do stays on track, it's going to be a nightmarish fall into next year.

01:05:00.425 --> 01:05:04.806
But the thing is, the destruction cannot be stopped.

01:05:06.229 --> 01:05:17.433
And frankly, do we really want the structures and the institutions and the things that are destroying us?

01:05:18.093 --> 01:05:21.575
Do we even mind that they're destroyed anymore?

01:05:25.656 --> 01:05:27.137
They're working for us.

01:05:27.277 --> 01:05:28.838
They're not saving anything.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:32.199
So, okay, they're going to be destroyed no matter what.

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:32.659
All right.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:36.164
So now we have to start thinking.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:49.115
I never thought I'd live to say what I'm going to say right now, because I thought in my little, that little article out of kilter, I thought, oh, that's just me fantasizing, you know, about what the ideal situation.

01:05:49.775 --> 01:05:57.662
But here that I've been thinking recently, you know, I might have to start talking about this little thing again, about trying to correct the errors, how we got here.

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:02.330
So it's just a very superficial thing.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.971
Talks about it in general, sets it up, and then my little thoughts.

01:06:06.031 --> 01:06:08.392
And I think there's some substance to it.

01:06:08.452 --> 01:06:10.633
Very, very simple approach.

01:06:10.813 --> 01:06:11.893
Things we have to learn.

01:06:12.033 --> 01:06:13.314
I think elected office.

01:06:15.134 --> 01:06:20.756
I realized in 1980 that I think that was the election between Jimmy Carter and the one, what's his name?

01:06:21.536 --> 01:06:23.137
The actor guy in there.

01:06:23.297 --> 01:06:26.638
And that's what I realized as a young guy in 1980.

01:06:28.021 --> 01:06:32.083
And I realized there is no such thing as representative government.

01:06:33.043 --> 01:06:36.025
At least they don't represent the people they're supposed to.

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:37.586
I realized that all the way back then.

01:06:38.346 --> 01:06:42.088
And I'm not going to go into those details why, unless you're curious.

01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:47.690
So then I was thinking, what would work?

01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:53.233
We draft people in the military against their will, all right?

01:06:54.269 --> 01:07:02.716
So my little thing, I'll just give a little short story, a little short introduction here, is that yes, we do have representatives, people that represent us.

01:07:03.537 --> 01:07:10.523
And we keep the structure like, you know, one third every two years, you have a new replacement.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:11.644
No elections are involved.

01:07:12.344 --> 01:07:13.385
But you use a lottery.

01:07:14.946 --> 01:07:17.949
You say use a lottery, which means

01:07:18.786 --> 01:07:30.696
The real people of the United States actually are going to be drafted into the government, what we call Congress, you see, to be Congress, to make those decisions.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:38.463
And think of it, though, the people in our society, you, me, everybody else around, we're the ones that build things.

01:07:38.965 --> 01:07:44.287
And we look at all the stuff that we're communicating now because of this COVID crap.

01:07:44.367 --> 01:07:54.151
I would have never known of you or Catherine Austin Fitz and all these other people that I've been talking to and collaborating with had it not been for this catastrophe.

01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:55.532
And it's like a renaissance.

01:07:56.292 --> 01:08:05.556
You know, we're in a weird sort of renaissance right now where people with all these skills who are not totally brain dead and basically independent for the most part

01:08:06.368 --> 01:08:10.951
are coming together, sharing that people have skills and are curious.

01:08:11.151 --> 01:08:13.152
The other thing is, is that we're curious.

01:08:13.192 --> 01:08:14.733
Don't trust people who are not curious.

01:08:15.654 --> 01:08:18.675
Don't trust people that don't ask questions.

01:08:19.076 --> 01:08:20.937
And I say, don't trust people that don't laugh.

01:08:22.137 --> 01:08:25.119
That's the criteria that I use.

01:08:25.739 --> 01:08:33.364
And when I see the people that I've been meeting on these Zoom things, personally, everything, they all satisfy that criteria.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:42.685
you know, the ones that I'm happy to be with them, we laugh a lot, have a good time, we learn, share information, you know, that's the people that build things.

01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:43.986
That's what they do.

01:08:44.486 --> 01:08:46.107
And that's what they've always done.

01:08:46.127 --> 01:08:47.027
All right.

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:57.011
And so we're the ones, you know, that have to think about at some point, we're the ones that have to think about the rebuilding part.

01:08:58.211 --> 01:09:02.013
And, you know, and it has to be a new, it can't,

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:04.567
I would do away with elected office.

01:09:04.647 --> 01:09:05.667
It's obviously failed.

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:09.608
But I like the idea of democracy or a republic.

01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:15.370
If you have a big space, if you have a republic, then you have to use a draft.

01:09:16.050 --> 01:09:18.851
It's not elected, you know, and I'd keep it very small.

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:21.212
You know, the states are a good idea.

01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:29.575
I think the states, the sizes of states, I think that's a good place to start with, you know, and just draft people.

01:09:30.676 --> 01:09:31.876
And I was, in my little thing,

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.470
They would be paid a million dollars a year for six years, just like the Senate.

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:39.497
They're in office in the Senate because here they are, they're being drafted.

01:09:40.177 --> 01:09:44.379
But you're gonna pay them too, you know, so that they haven't wasted anything.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:47.580
So it's like jury duty from hell kind of though, right?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.381
It's jury duty from hell, but you get paid for it.

01:09:51.601 --> 01:09:52.162
Nice.

01:09:52.862 --> 01:10:02.085
And, but, you know, I was thinking, boy, you can do all kinds of things when you, when these people are drafted, you know, each and every one of them, you have their stories, you know, you tell their backgrounds there.

01:10:02.105 --> 01:10:09.348
I mean, you can have a lot of fun with it, you know, and then these people are in there and they're just regular folks and everything would be live.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:14.953
You know, there would always be live broadcast, all the time, everything they do.

01:10:15.613 --> 01:10:19.416
I would get away with having no secrets in government.

01:10:19.776 --> 01:10:21.798
It's okay for individuals to have secrets.

01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:28.403
It's not okay for governments to have even one secret, in my opinion, to not even have one secret.

01:10:28.963 --> 01:10:46.416
but what if the whole congress is just a show it's a theater and all the real things happen behind closed doors anyway i mean then we're in trouble that's that's absolutely right it's so anyway here i you see you see i get i get enthusiastic about i know i am too i'm very enthusiastic about it i really want to save america but we've got a

01:10:47.236 --> 01:10:54.363
I think that the reality is the reason why we're here in COVID is because most of these people are part of this little theater and they know it already.

01:10:54.403 --> 01:11:02.530
They've already, they've already, they've signed on because they're, I don't know, maybe there's an arc or something that they know about that we don't know about.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:09.697
But, um, I, I'm, I'm still humans with a certain level of consciousness.

01:11:10.549 --> 01:11:13.950
that they don't feel good about themselves in a way.

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.352
I think, you know, there are some, like Anthony Fauci, I think he's totally completely lost, has zero conscience.

01:11:19.592 --> 01:11:20.533
No, probably not.

01:11:20.993 --> 01:11:21.233
Yeah.

01:11:21.273 --> 01:11:21.493
Yeah.

01:11:22.253 --> 01:11:27.595
I mean, but he, you know, he's a guy who, who that you can't explain him being there except for that.

01:11:27.715 --> 01:11:28.996
He's perfect for the role.

01:11:29.736 --> 01:11:30.216
He is.

01:11:30.556 --> 01:11:34.298
Otherwise they would have replaced him with someone better, but he's perfect for the role.

01:11:34.438 --> 01:11:34.598
Yeah.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:38.202
Yeah, he's been in for a very, very long time.

01:11:38.242 --> 01:11:43.848
I mean, some of the videos of him when he's young and talking about AIDS and whether kids can get it or not are very terrifying.

01:11:45.269 --> 01:11:55.400
It's hard for me to imagine the kinds of things that aren't available anymore, but would have been back then, the things that were said and the way that that went.

01:11:57.028 --> 01:12:07.314
Yeah, I mean, we could go on for many, many hours, but it's an hour and 10 minutes now, and it's kind of a good introduction if that's how you feel.

01:12:07.674 --> 01:12:08.455
It's okay here.

01:12:08.595 --> 01:12:10.196
We can keep going, whatever you'd like.

01:12:11.817 --> 01:12:15.759
I've been diving in in all different directions now, and because, you know,

01:12:17.068 --> 01:12:18.629
I didn't really figure it out until 2022.

01:12:20.509 --> 01:12:29.872
So for me, I was still believing that I was part of an effort to expose this and an effort to save everybody.

01:12:30.072 --> 01:12:33.514
And so I still have a lot of learning to do.

01:12:33.614 --> 01:12:34.674
So if you want to come back.

01:12:34.874 --> 01:12:35.374
We all do.

01:12:35.814 --> 01:12:37.055
We all do.

01:12:37.555 --> 01:12:37.735
Yeah.

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:40.169
I have a feeling you're ahead of me.

01:12:40.749 --> 01:12:44.290
You should, you should feel very good about yourself and look at Naomi Wolf.

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:55.212
I mean, she is something else too, because how, you know, she's such a good independent individual and she has a good mind and she is such a different person.

01:12:55.352 --> 01:12:57.772
I mean, in the sense of public, a public person.

01:12:58.613 --> 01:13:06.174
Uh, uh, I mean, from what I see and you know, I don't hold it against people, uh, that,

01:13:07.754 --> 01:13:13.540
accepted things for a while, but when they couldn't accept it anymore, they didn't.

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.382
They stopped.

01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:16.002
That's good.

01:13:16.122 --> 01:13:17.664
I think that's a good experience.

01:13:18.004 --> 01:13:20.026
Yeah, I definitely do.

01:13:20.166 --> 01:13:21.467
I'm worried about the

01:13:22.926 --> 01:13:28.971
The way I feel is that a lot of people actually encouraged me to go the wrong way.

01:13:29.412 --> 01:13:34.276
And if I had continued to go the wrong way, I think they would still be encouraging me to go that way.

01:13:34.956 --> 01:13:42.923
And so I start to become worried how many of those people were put in place very early in order to encourage us to go the wrong way.

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:45.845
I think that's the level of,

01:13:47.236 --> 01:14:02.689
of what is it, it would be pessimism, I guess, that I'm very pessimistic that there were actually, I mean, if they would have been saying, look, David Resnick knew this already in the 80s and the 90s, and we should listen to him, that would have been one thing.

01:14:03.249 --> 01:14:08.914
But not very many people pointed backwards and said, hey, other people have been arguing this.

01:14:08.974 --> 01:14:15.880
And instead, they stepped right into the spotlight and didn't really usefully help us for quite a while.

01:14:17.317 --> 01:14:23.499
Oh, this has been going on since at least the 80s at the academic level, especially.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:34.404
I didn't know it took AIDS to do it because I was collaborating with people at University of California at San Francisco and other places and we had good collaborations.

01:14:34.824 --> 01:14:38.245
But then with the AIDS stuff, the whole establishment

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:47.562
You know, at that university, UC Berkeley, for example, UCSF, these other places, you couldn't talk about it.

01:14:47.682 --> 01:14:57.005
You know, we could talk about anything, but the politically sensitive stuff like AIDS, nobody at the whole institution would talk to you about it.

01:14:57.285 --> 01:14:57.625
Wow.

01:14:59.145 --> 01:15:03.486
And that was at Berkeley and at UCSF and that was in the 80s.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:06.067
So it was probably going on before the 80s.

01:15:06.889 --> 01:15:12.114
But I know for a fact that it was going on in the mid 80s.

01:15:12.234 --> 01:15:13.436
And it's gotten worse.

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:20.863
I heard a story that your friend Peter Duesberg was about to be on national news and got canceled like minutes beforehand.

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:21.504
Oh, so many times.

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:23.290
So, so many times.

01:15:23.431 --> 01:15:27.972
I mean, but that really is like a, that's like a almost there kind of moment.

01:15:28.032 --> 01:15:40.838
And maybe we're here now where instead of, you know, getting, getting canceled and not getting out there that finally this is going to start to break through and, and, and become common knowledge for enough people so that we can make a difference.

01:15:40.858 --> 01:15:45.680
I mean, if we can start to even wake up a significant portion of

01:15:46.499 --> 01:15:50.661
the college kids, because right now I think the college kids are the ones that got screwed.

01:15:51.202 --> 01:15:56.404
We adults let them go back to school and left them at the hands of those monkeys.

01:15:56.724 --> 01:16:00.767
And so they know that these adults are liars.

01:16:00.887 --> 01:16:02.027
They definitely know that.

01:16:02.127 --> 01:16:07.190
Now, the question is, can we use that momentum and wake them up to this in the right way?

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:09.531
I think it's a real opportunity.

01:16:10.412 --> 01:16:10.652
It is.

01:16:10.672 --> 01:16:12.033
They're going to have to wake themselves up.

01:16:12.173 --> 01:16:12.653
That's the key.

01:16:14.678 --> 01:16:28.930
And the way they do that, like I say again, with curiosity, imagination, and then if they still have any in them, which young people, I hope they do, then they will discover us.

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:34.575
Like we're discovering each other now, so we just welcome them.

01:16:35.055 --> 01:16:37.177
But there's nothing we can do.

01:16:37.397 --> 01:16:42.161
They have to do it for themselves to look, to look for answers.

01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:46.353
you know, and find out, you know, they got to put in the effort.

01:16:47.433 --> 01:16:48.174
Very good point.

01:16:48.274 --> 01:16:49.414
I think that's really valid.

01:16:51.035 --> 01:16:52.656
I'm sure you've gotten this a lot of time.

01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:57.658
Hey, can you just send me some papers so I can figure this out for myself?

01:16:58.859 --> 01:17:01.100
I've been hearing that for many years now.

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.661
Can you just send me a few papers?

01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:05.702
Well, I tell you what, people can go to my website.

01:17:05.963 --> 01:17:08.244
Yeah, you're different though.

01:17:08.284 --> 01:17:08.925
That's different.

01:17:08.945 --> 01:17:10.846
Yeah, indeed.

01:17:10.906 --> 01:17:11.506
That's different.

01:17:11.546 --> 01:17:13.928
You've definitely got that up on me.

01:17:13.968 --> 01:17:17.090
And so I'm dropping that in the chat again.

01:17:18.451 --> 01:17:21.713
It's there right in this one.

01:17:23.204 --> 01:17:26.586
And yeah, it's been a real pleasure talking to you.

01:17:26.706 --> 01:17:32.729
And it's been actually really funny that we have only been on email up until now.

01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:36.570
And they've been very interesting email threads to say the least.

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:37.251
It's been nice.

01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:40.252
That will make a story in its own right someday.

01:17:40.392 --> 01:17:40.652
Yes.

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:48.336
Hopefully, it'll be a very exciting story that ends with, I don't know, a lot of forfeiture and that kind of thing.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.420
OK, OK, my friend.

01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:52.642
Well, nice meeting you.

01:17:52.682 --> 01:17:54.023
Have a great afternoon.

01:17:54.263 --> 01:17:58.228
OK, have a nice afternoon and we'll do this again very soon, I promise.

01:17:58.929 --> 01:17:59.569
OK, very good.

01:17:59.589 --> 01:18:00.030
I enjoy it.

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:00.731
OK, bye bye.

01:18:01.492 --> 01:18:01.832
We'll see you.

01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:05.063
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that was it.

01:18:05.664 --> 01:18:07.245
It was pretty random.

01:18:07.365 --> 01:18:08.487
I apologize for that.

01:18:08.547 --> 01:18:11.009
I don't really, I apologize.

01:18:11.049 --> 01:18:12.591
I don't know if that's the right term.

01:18:12.691 --> 01:18:19.257
I mean, maybe it became more obvious that we were just kind of shooting the shit.

01:18:19.377 --> 01:18:21.199
And I think that's a good way for us to meet.

01:18:21.219 --> 01:18:22.100
And yeah.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.221
I think that was a good way for us to first explore things.

01:18:28.361 --> 01:18:29.282
And I really liked the guy.

01:18:29.322 --> 01:18:31.943
I got a really good feeling about that dude.

01:18:32.903 --> 01:18:38.905
Unlike some of these other dudes who I have a less, whoops, I have a less good feeling about.

01:18:40.526 --> 01:18:51.250
I don't know exactly what they're hiding, but I do know that they are hiding transfection and transformation of cell culture in animals being the primary methodology that's used for RNA

01:18:52.290 --> 01:19:00.356
Virology, I do know that they know very well that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:04.920
I'm pretty sure they know that transfection in healthy humans was always a bad idea.

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.043
And I'm pretty sure they know that RNA can't pandemic.

01:19:09.403 --> 01:19:15.185
And that's why I say that bottom one RNA virology is just transformation and transfection of cell cultures and animal models.

01:19:15.225 --> 01:19:20.166
And if you understand that, then virology sort of works, but not the way they say.

01:19:21.187 --> 01:19:24.808
Please stop all transfections in humans.

01:19:26.772 --> 01:19:30.453
because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:19:32.694 --> 01:19:35.695
And so yeah, wake up your friends, wake up your neighbors.

01:19:36.236 --> 01:19:38.877
They don't need a shingle shot or a pneumonia shot.

01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:41.958
If you like what you saw, please show back up at

01:19:43.564 --> 01:19:57.129
gigaohm.bio which is a little place to chat and please share the videos at stream.gigaohm.bio and you can support the stream there at gigaohmbiological.com.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.190
Thanks very much for joining me.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:02.592
It's been a real pleasure and I'll see you tomorrow for sure.

01:20:03.112 --> 01:20:05.153
We've got a lot of work to do.

01:20:05.293 --> 01:20:10.715
It's been nice, a little relaxed schedule but we've got a lot of work to do so I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21:20.199 --> 01:21:21.483
Thanks everybody in the chat.

01:21:21.523 --> 01:21:22.465
See you tomorrow.

01:21:22.626 --> 01:21:25.514
Should be up, should be in the morning, should be in the morning.

01:21:26.597 --> 01:21:27.981
I should be able to do it in the morning.

01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:28.342
See you later.
