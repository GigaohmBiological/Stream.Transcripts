00:29.418 --> 00:32.680
I tried and told her I loved her, she didn't care, but anyway.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.403
I told her we'd still be friends and she didn't care, but anyway.

00:38.343 --> 00:42.125
I tried last week not to call her, she wasn't home, but anyway.

00:43.046 --> 00:46.408
I think I'll spend my life alone, I really don't care right now.

00:46.808 --> 00:52.231
But anyway, the state of affairs and the state of emotion, the kind of thing that you must understand.

00:52.291 --> 00:56.574
I'll tell you one thing, you tell me and that day we walk away, maybe then shake hands.

01:12.316 --> 01:14.977
We're joking when you taught me this, but anyway.

01:15.497 --> 01:17.918
The news man said not to sit on the strange colored sheets.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.398
It's my life he's trying to save.

01:19.618 --> 01:22.599
Well, anyway, I found out that I got a cancer.

01:22.819 --> 01:24.080
Too many television waves.

01:24.320 --> 01:27.341
Well, anyway, it's a state of affairs and a state of emotion.

01:27.681 --> 01:29.522
Kind of thing that you must understand.

01:29.962 --> 01:31.922
I'll tell you one thing, you tell me another.

01:31.942 --> 01:33.603
We walk away many dead shapes.

03:12.207 --> 03:39.837
Someday an answer will find us Quite a long shot, but anyway I think the past, the past is behind us A real confusing event, but anyway I put all my hope in tomorrow It's gonna be great, I can tell, but anyway I see a new, a new day is dawning I'd like to say to you, well, but anyway It's a state of affairs, a state of emotion The kind of thing that you must understand I tell you one thing, you tell me another We walk away, maybe then shake hands

04:14.107 --> 04:16.469
Yo, welcome to the Spock Casa.

04:16.769 --> 04:18.170
And let's see how I'm pricey.

04:20.031 --> 04:21.312
Yo, you remember O'Hara.

04:21.332 --> 04:21.873
My boy, Sulu.

04:21.893 --> 04:22.133
Hey, y'all.

04:22.293 --> 04:23.514
What up, Spock?

04:23.614 --> 04:25.555
Baby, no salsa on the leather.

04:26.616 --> 04:27.437
Keep it on the chips.

04:29.198 --> 04:29.598
Artwork.

04:30.579 --> 04:30.799
Dope.

04:32.861 --> 04:34.842
James T. Kirk, president and counsel.

04:35.663 --> 04:37.744
This boy love that leftover roast beef.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.986
Spock, it's solid beef, baby.

04:40.606 --> 04:42.188
He like it a little, you know, rotten.

04:43.482 --> 04:45.324
And this here is my sanctuary.

04:45.344 --> 04:48.748
See, this is where I chill, where I relax, where I chillax.

04:51.871 --> 04:54.734
Scotty, beam on down, baby.

04:58.738 --> 05:02.402
As always, Scotty, bringing the power.

05:02.482 --> 05:03.303
Oh, yeah.

05:03.323 --> 05:03.643
Oh, yeah.

05:17.145 --> 05:19.746
Thanks for putting that link in the chat there for free rain.

05:19.826 --> 05:21.407
I really appreciate that very much.

05:21.567 --> 05:26.890
And please, please organize a way to see the live stream.

05:28.150 --> 05:33.793
I'm going to do my best to represent our work very well in South Dakota in a couple of weeks.

05:56.991 --> 06:03.277
The red pill, Pittsburgh, might actually be when the brownstone comes to Pittsburgh in November.

06:03.457 --> 06:11.123
At the beginning of November, there's a brownstone meeting in Pittsburgh, and I may be the actual red pill that shows up there.

06:11.143 --> 06:11.604
Who knows?

06:12.124 --> 06:12.945
I got my ticket.

06:13.666 --> 06:20.392
They're gonna have to revoke it if they don't want me to show up and cause trouble, so to speak.

06:21.713 --> 06:22.934
Throw a wrench in their works.

06:45.819 --> 06:47.340
A body cam, I bet.

06:47.961 --> 06:50.063
Dollars to donuts they wouldn't let me do that.

06:50.163 --> 06:51.604
But yeah, it's not a bad idea.

06:51.624 --> 06:52.966
I think truth is good for kids.

06:53.406 --> 06:57.250
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.332
We want everybody to feel good.

07:00.273 --> 07:01.714
That's not the way life is.

07:04.196 --> 07:05.718
But you can tell if someone's lying.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.080
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

07:09.890 --> 07:10.630
And I have lied.

07:10.650 --> 07:11.671
I'm sure I'll lie again.

07:11.691 --> 07:12.631
I don't want to lie.

07:13.092 --> 07:14.452
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

07:14.572 --> 07:15.593
I try not to be a liar.

07:15.613 --> 07:16.473
I don't want to be a liar.

07:17.034 --> 07:19.795
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

07:22.216 --> 07:26.359
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

07:26.779 --> 07:30.881
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

07:46.011 --> 07:47.892
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

07:47.992 --> 07:49.373
His name is J.J.

07:49.513 --> 07:53.274
Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for C.H.D.

07:54.135 --> 07:56.296
and I believe he has a Ph.D.

07:56.316 --> 08:00.898
in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

08:09.019 --> 08:16.725
Unfortunately, I think one of the reasons why they're doing it in Pennsylvania, and it doesn't matter if I come or not, is Pennsylvania is a two-party state.

08:16.785 --> 08:18.667
Can't secretly record anybody here.

08:19.147 --> 08:21.829
That would be a very bad idea in Pennsylvania.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.611
Can get you in trouble really quick.

08:24.711 --> 08:26.413
I think I've been baited.

08:28.046 --> 08:38.455
I think I've actually been baited more than once into recording somebody illegally or, you know, and that's really dangerous in Pennsylvania.

08:38.475 --> 08:39.216
You just can't do it.

08:39.276 --> 08:40.317
So I'm always recording.

08:40.757 --> 08:43.319
If you're on my show, you're being recorded, just so you know.

08:43.339 --> 08:45.561
Hello, let's push the button here.

09:03.763 --> 09:06.326
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

09:06.867 --> 09:12.713
This is Giga Ohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:13.334 --> 09:20.382
We are daily or nearly daily trying to work through the necessary exercises in order to

09:21.727 --> 09:25.811
effectively see through the illusions of the pandemic and how they did it.

09:26.391 --> 09:35.780
And it's taken us many years actually to get to an understanding that makes sense where the different angles on what is true add up to what the truth really is.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.344
And it isn't a matter of what is true, but what's perceived to be true.

09:40.384 --> 09:43.767
And that's what so much of social media has been about.

09:43.828 --> 09:47.151
It's been treating your consciousness as prime real estate.

09:48.584 --> 09:56.246
and giving it to the highest bidder, in this case, probably a national security operation being executed on all of us.

09:57.646 --> 10:08.109
And the way it has been executed on us is that they are keeping us from effectively asking any questions which will get us to these questions.

10:08.349 --> 10:13.891
Any lines of thought that will lead to these questions or these ideas

10:14.791 --> 10:25.677
are avoided, and they are avoided by a carefully crafted and orchestrated group of characters that I've come to call Team Worst Case Scenario.

10:26.238 --> 10:32.902
They're the ones who convinced us that solving the Scooby-Doo mystery about a lab leak or natural virus was a great idea.

10:33.522 --> 10:54.067
they're the ones who are committed to the spectacular lie that has gained a function as a potential pandemic source they are the ones who are spectacularly committed to not really discussing how many different ways the protocols were murdered and how much of a slippery slope something as innocent as supplementary oxygen

10:54.887 --> 10:58.470
in response to a low pulse ox, quote unquote.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.892
How slippery of a slope that could be.

11:01.433 --> 11:03.214
All of these things need to be hidden.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.536
You can't talk about this stuff.

11:06.077 --> 11:10.721
If you want to argue about how badly they've covered up the virus, you'll be a hero.

11:11.242 --> 11:21.310
If you want to talk about how badly they're covering up murder, they're going to attribute bad motives to every single thing you bring to the table and claim that you're not bringing any evidence at all.

11:22.386 --> 11:40.392
These people are influenced by, given comfort by, and in fact probably employed by, weaponized piles of money that are descendant from this original objection, probably not accurately recorded, where Andrew Jackson tried to expose the

11:42.987 --> 11:44.729
the den of thieves for what they were.

11:44.829 --> 11:50.814
And remember, this is still back in the day when there might have been some gold backing up some values.

11:51.595 --> 11:52.636
We don't have that anymore.

11:52.676 --> 11:56.560
We're fiat currencies on top of fiat currencies on top of derivatives.

11:57.773 --> 12:02.395
There's no way for anyone to accurately see what they've done in that regard.

12:02.435 --> 12:13.119
But there is a way to see what they've done with regard to biology because that's a mythology that is solely reliant on that commitment to lies.

12:13.780 --> 12:16.241
That's why Tony Fauci has been in charge for so long.

12:16.821 --> 12:24.844
It's hard to get a succession of people to commit to lies about the basic truths of our irreducible complexity.

12:25.284 --> 12:26.505
It's not too hard to get one

12:28.209 --> 12:37.316
one guy's son to lie about it for his whole life, his whole professional life.

12:37.416 --> 12:41.559
And that history is slowly being erased, being cleansed.

12:42.740 --> 12:47.843
And you better get it while you can, because it will eventually be gone.

12:47.903 --> 12:48.444
Buy books.

12:51.175 --> 12:53.497
You know, backup CDs and stuff is not enough.

12:53.517 --> 12:54.357
You need to buy books.

12:54.517 --> 12:57.239
I've learned that in a very wonderful way.

12:57.279 --> 13:01.642
I've come to love all the books that I'm surrounded by because these charlatans aren't in those books.

13:03.283 --> 13:13.811
The charlatans that are descended from the OG charlatans, Baltimore, Gallo, Kaprowski, and Plotkin,

13:14.895 --> 13:22.899
Those are my OG charlatans, and I know there are more, but I leave that up to Mark Hucytonic, Mark Kulak to add to that list.

13:22.939 --> 13:32.885
But for me, for now, those four are pretty much enough because they explain how almost everyone in this narrative has come to be in this narrative, including Mickiewicz and Malone.

13:33.825 --> 13:38.688
Yeah, that's right, including Mickiewicz and Malone, not just Rancid Yellow, not just Fauci.

13:40.677 --> 13:43.838
but Malone and Mickiewicz too, which is really weird.

13:43.898 --> 13:58.181
And so the only way we're going to make gentle the life of this world as we shed this mythology that has been put on us over generations is to make sure we stay focused, that we don't take their bait that they're trying to give us and that we try to love our neighbors.

13:58.221 --> 14:02.943
And in fact, that's what we've been doing here at Giggo and Biological for quite some time.

14:02.983 --> 14:03.823
That's been our deal.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.425
And this wave of coordinated, it's an artificial wave.

14:08.525 --> 14:11.910
It feels like, wow, everybody agrees.

14:12.731 --> 14:18.439
And this wave of consensus was artificially created by a bunch of people who agreed to lie on the internet.

14:18.819 --> 14:20.281
And if you want to use the truth,

14:21.022 --> 14:28.209
and the understanding of the sacred biology that is us and our children to surf this wave, well, then you're at the right place.

14:28.669 --> 14:34.674
And I don't purport to be as good a teacher as that guy in the white trunks, but I'm doing my best.

14:35.835 --> 14:39.879
And if you've been here for a while, you know that at Giga Home Biological, we stay focused on the biology.

14:39.919 --> 14:43.062
We don't take the bait on social media and we love our neighbors as best we can.

14:43.582 --> 14:47.004
The way this works is that people are sharing the stream consistently every week.

14:47.425 --> 14:50.607
And that's why we're already at 58 viewers after just 14 minutes.

14:51.427 --> 14:54.910
And I expect we'll be over 110 viewers by the end of the program.

14:56.050 --> 14:57.631
It's just a trend they can't break.

14:58.932 --> 15:04.796
And a lot of the reruns are being watched on PeerTube, which is exactly the idea of that platform in the first place.

15:05.517 --> 15:11.221
We don't want to steer people to an archive that's going to disappear like something on Twitch.

15:11.741 --> 15:19.086
We don't want to steer people to an archive like on Rumble that's obviously supporting some of these other narrative people and promoting them.

15:19.907 --> 15:25.231
We want to steer them to a place that's completely free and actually now funded by these viewers.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.713
So, you know, one of the places that I spend money

15:28.913 --> 15:31.696
from the subscriptions is on PeerTube.

15:31.736 --> 15:37.381
So that archive, completely taken care of by us, is also provided by us.

15:37.601 --> 15:40.523
And so all of those people on that start stream, thank you very much.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.466
Illusion, his participation, that's it.

15:43.606 --> 15:44.607
You gotta participate.

15:44.707 --> 15:50.172
And if you wanna engage in noncompliance, you actually gotta, you gotta learn the biology.

15:56.745 --> 15:57.106
do do

16:20.276 --> 16:22.378
Good morning, everyone from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:22.418 --> 16:27.082
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:27.122 --> 16:30.385
My name's Jonathan Cooey, and yeah, it's the 5th of June.

16:30.665 --> 16:31.626
We still have work to do.

16:32.266 --> 16:33.527
I apologize for being late.

16:33.547 --> 16:38.912
This is the first day of summer vacation in my house, and so there are a few different balls to juggle here.

16:38.952 --> 16:47.560
I don't think that that's gonna affect the 1010 stream long-term, but this morning, we still had some loose ends to tie up,

16:48.320 --> 16:52.023
And so I had to be lifeguard in our little tiny driveway pool.

16:53.143 --> 17:02.069
There are some incredibly small neighbor kids that come over sometimes that can actually still have a problem in our little pool, even though it's only like, I don't know what, how deep it is.

17:03.030 --> 17:06.472
So after lifeguarding this morning, I am here.

17:06.492 --> 17:11.436
I am a human just like you trying to best cope with

17:12.279 --> 17:20.567
a world full of people that are confused and frustrated and also unreasonably certain about things.

17:21.568 --> 17:22.990
And so that's what's really weird, right?

17:23.030 --> 17:31.478
You have people around you everywhere you see, especially in America, because it's here worse than anywhere else, I imagine.

17:32.579 --> 17:43.724
where people are just so riled up and confused and also sort of have their hairs on end because they assume that half of the people in the world are diametrically opposed to them.

17:44.664 --> 17:56.229
So we're in a very dangerous place right now in America, I'll admit it, but I do think that there's a very easy, however narrow, way out, and that is trying to reconnect with the sacred biology, the irreducible complexity,

17:56.849 --> 18:02.914
that was you when you were born and your child when he or she was born, and in fact all of us.

18:03.195 --> 18:18.188
And it's only because of the extreme lack of proper nutrition and the extreme presence of environmental toxicity in America in particular that so many people are so unhealthy.

18:18.268 --> 18:18.989
I mean, if you eat

18:19.749 --> 18:21.671
unhealthily your entire life.

18:22.352 --> 18:31.399
If eating habits are spoiled from school onwards, even from birth onwards, then you really have a problem.

18:31.439 --> 18:47.793
And of course, we start, most American children start with two injections within a few minutes of their birth, which is really an abomination and something that I myself was a firsthand witness to when my daughter was born seven years ago now.

18:48.913 --> 18:51.894
It's to me something still that I very humbly submit.

18:52.674 --> 19:03.557
I did not pull my head out as fast as some of these other people who have come before me that actually have children who remain vaccine injured, some of whom are now vaccine injured adults.

19:05.418 --> 19:09.919
And these people deserve all of the respect and deference that we can offer them.

19:10.839 --> 19:12.480
However, a lot of them are burnt out.

19:13.340 --> 19:35.495
A lot of them are tired of fighting because they have been fighting for 10 years, and people have been ignoring them, and they have been shouting into an echo chamber that may have been some of these organizations purporting to be speaking for them, helping them, advocating for them, when in reality they were just a little 55-gallon barrel that everybody was yelling into, thinking that they're

19:36.135 --> 19:38.597
that their voices were being heard.

19:39.057 --> 19:43.300
And so that's really what I'm trying to get this idea out.

19:43.320 --> 20:02.375
I'm going to try and do my best at the Red Pill Expo to really explain how it is that people, by lying consistently about the biology and asking consistently the wrong questions and acknowledging consistently that these are the right questions, even though they're the wrong questions, has led to a

20:06.394 --> 20:17.661
a false illusion, an illusion of consensus, that it is becoming common knowledge that four and a half years ago, a lab leak occurred.

20:18.322 --> 20:33.051
And that common knowledge is about to pass on to our children, where they are going to talk in the locker rooms or with their history teacher about the fact that what indeed happened, apparently, it seems like it was a lab leak.

20:34.730 --> 20:48.714
And I am making the argument that this is exactly the intention of this so-called fifth generation warfare that's supposedly working on top of a natural phenomenon, which is a coronavirus pandemic.

20:48.754 --> 20:51.355
And this is a wholesale lie.

20:52.755 --> 21:03.258
And all of the people that I am currently criticizing are people who I believe are part of a team of people

21:05.421 --> 21:20.386
who wittingly or unwittingly at some point has become part of this national security narrative which was designed all along to bring to the state where people understand that I guess it was a lab leak.

21:20.446 --> 21:31.429
Now, the reason why I showed that Alex Karp video a few days ago is because Alex Karp is very succinct when he says that he went to Germany to study how it is that we know things.

21:32.759 --> 21:36.860
how it is and whether or not people can actually participate in their republics.

21:39.520 --> 21:50.403
And so these little hints are all over the place from all of these people when they've been first introduced, when they first come out, when they first spoken, when things are a little less reined in or less polished.

21:52.343 --> 21:57.624
And what you see is that these people have been sculpting, have been forming,

21:59.986 --> 22:25.690
these rather complex concepts in our head by planting them in social media, planting them in mainstream media and movies and books and in philanthropic endeavors and conferences and in bureaucratic meetings and in grant proposals and in tabletop exercises, all the same ideas.

22:27.498 --> 22:37.720
so that over years there is an illusion of consensus about a background of viruses, retroviruses, coronaviruses, DNA viruses, RNA viruses.

22:41.620 --> 22:42.841
All of it is outside of us.

22:43.021 --> 22:44.081
All of it is alien.

22:44.241 --> 22:47.181
All of it is we exist despite.

22:50.462 --> 22:56.503
And so essentially there's all this erroneous, pathogenic,

22:58.110 --> 23:10.793
aspects of the world, which is really a gross distortion of what I see when I look out into my backyard, what I've seen for my whole life and know to be true.

23:12.493 --> 23:21.615
And it's only because of the blessings and curses of this pandemic that many of us have come to understand how badly we were fooled.

23:21.655 --> 23:24.856
More importantly, how badly all of our teachers, all of our parents,

23:26.792 --> 23:29.714
All of the people that I was ever mentored by are fooled.

23:31.635 --> 23:40.039
And many of them remain fooled, even though I have, as best I've tried, to really explain to them that, look, I was there too.

23:40.379 --> 23:44.101
I was fooled like you, so I understand exactly what your mindset is.

23:44.141 --> 23:51.085
And I feel like I've thrown a very handy lifeline to a lot of these people.

23:51.125 --> 23:55.047
And they've just kind of said, nah, I'm not really interested in climbing out.

23:57.403 --> 24:01.865
And so we are at a very crucial point right now where maybe we're not going to get over a threshold.

24:01.945 --> 24:02.645
Maybe we are.

24:03.685 --> 24:10.367
But if we're going to do it, it's going to happen, I believe, in the next few months where a threshold is reached that can never be reversed.

24:10.447 --> 24:13.008
Quite similar to where we were with the shots.

24:13.628 --> 24:24.212
We need to get most of the people who are still open minded to see the possibility that they murdered people and then blamed it on a lab leak.

24:24.252 --> 24:26.053
And that's what they want to be the

24:28.621 --> 24:43.806
the end sort of set point, the end attractor state of everybody's conscious and unconscious assumptions about the last five years, especially university students.

24:44.286 --> 24:51.609
You can't understand how important it is that especially they, because if their parents don't fully fall into that attractor state, they're going to stay there.

24:52.878 --> 24:56.746
And they'll assume that their parents don't understand the nuances of what occurred.

24:57.227 --> 25:04.201
And there's going to be a concerted effort in the coming months to make sure that this does become common knowledge.

25:06.636 --> 25:16.681
That's why Chris Martenson, that we've talked about in the last couple of weeks, just did a podcast like yesterday that said that the lab leak was starting to become common knowledge.

25:17.061 --> 25:30.748
It's exactly what their plan was and exactly why all these people, trusted sources, were put in place, promoted on the PBS NewsHour in 60 minutes and in the Senate years before the pandemic.

25:34.585 --> 25:40.669
What they want you to believe is that this operation started in 2020, but it did not.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.071
2020 was a public reveal.

25:44.212 --> 25:52.078
They have been covering up for a very long time that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.323
It's very possible that the old vaccine schedule is much worse than this one.

25:57.723 --> 26:02.566
And that's why EpiGirl's message of look at the VAERS signal though.

26:02.966 --> 26:05.948
The VAERS signal has been pretty low up until now.

26:10.431 --> 26:21.098
Now you see that EpiGirl's first and most important message was actually that the VAERS signal from the COVID vaccines is so much higher than any previous.

26:22.113 --> 26:22.734
vaccine.

26:23.254 --> 26:26.397
In fact, all the other vaccines combined.

26:28.219 --> 26:41.652
What an interesting message now in retrospect that she started out with and stuck with for an extraordinarily long time, almost exactly like the character described in the Spars document that I'm referring to, Epigirl.

26:43.154 --> 26:47.058
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

26:47.498 --> 26:55.606
Today I found some really funny coincidental evidence of where things are going with regard to this thing.

26:55.987 --> 26:57.088
Remember my argument.

27:00.611 --> 27:03.895
I'm making the argument that we got picked up on the side of the road.

27:05.041 --> 27:12.585
And we got into a car, and we thought that all the people in the car were, you know, a bunch of hitchhikers in the same situation that we were in.

27:12.845 --> 27:19.448
You know, a meteor hit, one guy stole a car, drove down the road, picked up somebody that needed help, then another person, and then another person.

27:19.488 --> 27:23.329
We're all in this situation together, and we're just driving away from the crash.

27:23.770 --> 27:24.690
We got to get out of here.

27:27.042 --> 27:34.967
But in reality, what happened was we were told to stay home, we went on social media, and then social media was programmed to put certain people in the car with us.

27:35.988 --> 27:51.759
And incidentally, those certain people that in the car, the ones that were supposedly censored and then started Gab and Locals and Telegram, are all united in their inability to question the fundamental principles of this faith.

27:52.259 --> 27:53.580
There was a novel virus.

27:54.597 --> 27:57.157
Millions died and were saved from it.

27:57.918 --> 28:00.678
Gain of function is real and a virus will come again.

28:03.899 --> 28:13.160
And once you start to see that although Jessica Rose is a hero for speaking out about VAERS signals, she can't question this at all.

28:14.140 --> 28:23.802
And in fact, the first three papers that she ever published are doing computational math, making a math model of virus growth or something like that.

28:25.560 --> 28:26.541
She's a virologist.

28:30.904 --> 28:38.070
More recently, it's become more obvious, I think, because they're really off script and they're panicking and they need to do something to step someone in front of me.

28:38.871 --> 28:41.293
So they're desperately trying to figure out how to do it.

28:41.353 --> 28:48.559
Maybe they're gonna, I showed you already, maybe they're gonna have Sasha Latupova and Kevin McKernan get into a big fist fight or something like that.

28:48.979 --> 28:52.582
Maybe they'll get on a Twitter space together and argue, argue, argue.

28:53.763 --> 28:54.624
It'll all be fake.

28:55.919 --> 28:59.903
Maybe Sasha Latipov has already done it with somebody else and argued and it's fake.

29:03.607 --> 29:17.641
The reason why you know she's fake is because you have to do research about what she allowed to happen or what she allowed to be done using her daughter when her daughter was a minor before the pandemic.

29:17.681 --> 29:18.702
If you just look into that,

29:19.448 --> 29:20.891
You can find her videos.

29:20.951 --> 29:24.998
I think her moniker on the internet was Soph, S-O-P-H.

29:25.039 --> 29:26.040
I don't know what her name is.

29:26.141 --> 29:26.722
I don't care.

29:26.742 --> 29:30.008
I just need you to know that there's no reason to trust this person.

29:30.993 --> 29:33.275
any more than there's a reason to trust Kevin McKernan.

29:33.836 --> 29:36.578
But Kevin McKernan is a very important player in this.

29:37.158 --> 29:48.628
There were lots of random people that were added, like Sasha, that don't play much of a role, and in the end can't really play much of a role, because she was already doing something before the pandemic.

29:48.688 --> 29:56.955
And the moment that becomes clear, the moment that everybody finds out that, wait a minute, what, your daughter was on Alex Jones before the pandemic?

29:56.995 --> 29:57.456
What the hell?

29:58.700 --> 30:01.842
Wait, your daughter threatened the YouTube CEO?

30:01.882 --> 30:02.403
Wait, what?

30:03.703 --> 30:11.189
Wait, you took intellectual property and data from the University of Rochester and made a company and sold it to Pfizer?

30:11.609 --> 30:15.972
I mean, that's just an absolute meddler.

30:16.012 --> 30:18.694
Look what Joe Lee is doing on Twitter right now.

30:19.354 --> 30:26.139
He's trying to pretend that the reason why they hired me at CHD was to distract from his string theory.

30:29.454 --> 30:44.702
I mean, the pathetic level that they're at right now, where they're trying to use a combination of lies and victimhood, and somehow I'm still collaborating with this one or that one.

30:49.145 --> 30:58.390
I don't want to be too... I mean, there's hardly anybody with a record of integrity in this except for me.

31:00.694 --> 31:04.596
I mean, who else has admitted consistently when they were wrong?

31:04.616 --> 31:08.317
Who else has got a link up that says exactly how wrong they were?

31:10.799 --> 31:19.122
Who else can have the claim to fame of trying to have sent an email where I tried to bring CHD together with the no virus people on both sides said, meh.

31:21.463 --> 31:27.106
Who else can claim to have helped Bobby Kennedy write his book and even gotten the words in there, they didn't need a virus.

31:29.778 --> 31:34.319
and then worked for CHD and got fired because they said something about Robert Malone and Meryl Ness.

31:34.339 --> 31:35.620
Who else can claim that?

31:41.421 --> 31:44.042
Sasha's been on Shannon Joy four times.

31:44.082 --> 31:48.563
Sasha's been on the Coronavirus Committee in Germany three times.

31:49.664 --> 31:52.164
She's been on Malik's podcast twice.

31:52.565 --> 31:53.745
Who is that meddler?

31:56.860 --> 32:00.782
And why is Kevin McKernan having a conversation with her on the internet now?

32:01.622 --> 32:03.683
But Robert Malone says she's a bad guy.

32:04.364 --> 32:06.625
Robert Malone has outed her as one of the worst.

32:06.665 --> 32:09.746
Remember, he was on Steve Kirsch's podcast a couple of weeks ago.

32:09.786 --> 32:12.407
I don't really appreciate that.

32:12.808 --> 32:17.570
She's part of a three-year campaign of interference with his life.

32:22.369 --> 32:23.869
I mean, you can just look at the videos.

32:23.889 --> 32:25.610
We've studied them day after day.

32:25.750 --> 32:27.750
It's very clear now they are liars.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.831
They have revealed themselves as liars.

32:29.891 --> 32:36.573
It only takes a few hours of time to listen carefully to how I delineate that they have to be liars.

32:36.633 --> 32:44.335
It's impossible for them to be where they are saying what they said in 2020, 21, 22, to now be claiming what they're claiming.

32:44.355 --> 32:45.235
They have to be liars.

32:47.233 --> 32:53.543
And they're fundamentally liars because they all agree that an RNA molecule can pandemic and it definitely can't.

32:59.198 --> 33:01.520
So I saw this guy today, which is really interesting.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.361
And I got to get the things off of here for a minute.

33:04.422 --> 33:05.522
So I saw this guy today.

33:05.542 --> 33:14.388
I'm going to leave this graphic up, though, because I want everybody to be reminded constantly that the spread of bad ideas is very diabolical and actually programmed to work against us.

33:14.928 --> 33:20.192
So I don't know who this guy is, but he tweets a lot in Polish.

33:20.392 --> 33:22.754
And he claims to have worked for the CDC in the past.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.775
I'm not trying to promote him, I'm just trying to show you a pattern.

33:26.416 --> 33:34.680
I said that Jessica Hockett was gonna release the video from what we briefed Senator Ron Johnson's staff on.

33:35.240 --> 33:46.925
So we didn't get an audience with Senator Ron Johnson, we got an audience with his staff and somebody or two people who were far below the informed level that we hoped for.

33:48.086 --> 33:51.568
We basically got recent college graduates, as far as I could tell.

33:51.648 --> 33:54.849
So it's unfortunate, but we did what we could.

33:56.550 --> 34:00.051
And so I said, you know, in coming, we might release this video.

34:00.091 --> 34:01.252
I'm really excited about it.

34:01.832 --> 34:04.093
And this guy decides to tweet, actually.

34:04.153 --> 34:05.954
Most of the time, he just retweets people.

34:06.434 --> 34:12.357
But in this case today, he decided to retweet more noise being sent to Senator Johnson's panel.

34:14.605 --> 34:14.765
Hmm.

34:15.646 --> 34:19.369
So I just started to look at what he had retweeted today.

34:20.549 --> 34:26.914
And he retweeted Kate Lindy, who was promoting Brett Weinstein's video.

34:27.615 --> 34:34.059
He retweeted Jason James, who retweeted Brett Weinstein's video.

34:34.520 --> 34:36.061
He retweeted Jeffrey Tucker.

34:36.121 --> 34:41.605
That's the guy who runs the Brownstone Institute that I'm going to crash, but I've paid to crash in November.

34:43.804 --> 34:47.968
Oh, wow, there's Shannon Joy, look at that, and The Who, that's great.

34:48.869 --> 34:52.872
He says that Barack Obama is actually behind what happened.

34:54.174 --> 34:56.876
He's Steve Kirsch, there you go, isn't that great?

34:58.157 --> 35:08.366
And Jordan Chattel, I don't know where he's from, but he feels like a meddler as well, just from who he promotes, but then he promotes Professor Martin Neal, that's really nice.

35:09.648 --> 35:12.330
and the virus origins and gain of function research.

35:12.370 --> 35:25.101
So that, that's an interesting review, because that review is basically based on, it's based on taking the word of previous to

35:27.646 --> 35:31.089
the pandemic, previous to the pandemic, textbooks about virology.

35:31.109 --> 35:46.602
They're basically trying to go on what fields virology said about coronavirus before the pandemic and then use that as a starting point to say what did or didn't happen in the pandemic and what is or isn't possible with coronavirus research.

35:46.662 --> 35:54.629
Now, for the most part, I just want to say that I was offered the opportunity to write that with them or to help them

35:55.376 --> 35:57.218
edit it or write it or contribute to it.

35:57.298 --> 35:58.719
And I did not.

35:59.920 --> 36:10.429
And the main reason was because when I read it, I realized that they had done what I did in 2020 and bought a virology book or got the PDF and read it.

36:12.470 --> 36:17.635
And so I didn't really want to go and say, well, I mean, yeah, but

36:20.430 --> 36:22.832
And so it was frustrating to me.

36:22.912 --> 36:27.735
So then, of course, he also is promoting Nick Hudson, but notice carefully the pattern here.

36:28.996 --> 36:30.377
Notice carefully the pattern here.

36:30.437 --> 36:44.526
He's only promoting Nick Hudson when he's replying to Steve Kirsch, or when he's replying to Jeffrey Tucker, or when he's replying, oh, when he's got this guy on who was on the Campbell Show about T-cells.

36:45.347 --> 36:46.908
I think, or no, cancer, sorry.

36:49.141 --> 36:53.424
So it's a very interesting place we're in because it's starting to become obvious.

36:53.464 --> 36:54.725
They're running out of room.

36:54.785 --> 36:55.986
They're running out of actors.

36:56.026 --> 36:57.628
They're running out of anonymous accounts.

36:57.668 --> 37:05.114
If you just stop paying attention to anonymous accounts alone, the noise of Twitter disappears greatly, but you can also still see it.

37:06.935 --> 37:10.578
And this very lively debate is being curated by these people.

37:10.618 --> 37:16.043
That's why it's very suspect to me that somebody who is followed well in Poland

37:18.691 --> 37:27.776
Has decided to speak out against me and it's interesting because other people were trying to get me to interview this guy earlier this year And I never really was in contact with him.

37:27.836 --> 37:47.125
So it's strange that he's got something in his in his bonnet for me So, please work hard every day to try and see through this thing that has been going on since the 20s this is Edward Bernays talking about how Democratic society is ruled

37:47.984 --> 37:52.248
by the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses.

37:52.308 --> 37:54.150
And there's a special word in there.

37:54.190 --> 37:56.632
It's the organized habits and opinions.

37:57.973 --> 37:59.674
Organized habits and opinions.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.138
These people and those people and those people and those people.

38:03.618 --> 38:05.279
And that's what these guys are doing.

38:06.681 --> 38:08.002
Make no mistake about it.

38:08.042 --> 38:10.164
That's why I'm hammering on Kevin McKernan.

38:11.271 --> 38:24.037
There is no other way to explain why Kevin McKernan was on an April podcast talking about a background signal and that you're going to have to come up with some pretty good evidence if it's a lab leak because I don't believe it.

38:24.917 --> 38:27.478
It could have been in circulation for 40 or 70 years.

38:29.459 --> 38:36.923
Then the next month he's back again talking about how he's got to test cannabis because you know we use bat guano and people sneeze all the time.

38:37.844 --> 38:45.389
And cancer patients and old people are using weed like never before, so we wouldn't want cannabis to get in the weed supply and then kill all these old people.

38:47.330 --> 38:56.036
And they had a discussion about masks and whether or not they're appropriate anywhere or whenever, and how often they need to be renewed, asking the wrong questions over and over.

38:56.476 --> 38:59.538
And now, today, we're gonna watch one from December of the same year.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.482
And it'll probably be nothing sort of extraordinary, what he says.

39:08.203 --> 39:18.033
That's why it's also extraordinary that I think part of the reason why I was let go from CHD is because pressure that was put on by him or people that were associated.

39:18.674 --> 39:24.259
It's my understanding that he himself called and complained about what I was doing on Twitter.

39:27.102 --> 39:36.825
I can't remember off the top of my head which one, who told me what, if someone directly told me by email or if someone told me about somebody else who got the phone call.

39:36.865 --> 39:38.946
But either way, that person was involved.

39:41.226 --> 39:56.751
And so it's also very strange that these two people, Jessica Rose and Robert Malone, were so prominently featured in my podcast with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which was supposed to be an hour with him and me, and then was changed about a few days beforehand.

39:58.353 --> 40:02.918
because Robert Malone didn't want to listen to my talk or something like that, and it became seven minutes.

40:04.661 --> 40:06.743
And it wasn't even supposed to be a panel until then.

40:07.264 --> 40:11.509
And incidentally, this panel, I think Robert Malone spoke for at least 40 minutes.

40:12.530 --> 40:15.512
And it wasn't my best presentation by any stretch of the imagination.

40:15.572 --> 40:16.793
Seven minutes is short for me.

40:17.333 --> 40:31.101
But I did my best, and more importantly, these people did their best to make sure that they continued to maintain this illusion that a Scooby-Doo mystery was on the way to being solved and that gain of function was very likely.

40:32.862 --> 40:39.025
And these people have been misleading the young for a few years now, and it's time that we don't take it anymore.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.366
We have to draw a line somewhere.

40:43.692 --> 40:47.357
And anybody that's on that red side over there is still sketchy.

40:47.377 --> 40:50.101
I think that Sukrit Bhakti is almost there.

40:50.121 --> 40:56.669
I think that Peter McCullough is almost there, except he still says what he's got to say, I guess, to stay alive.

40:57.471 --> 40:57.791
I don't know.

40:58.712 --> 41:01.354
But the rest of these people are just fully meddlers.

41:01.394 --> 41:02.195
They're just liars.

41:02.315 --> 41:04.356
They're lying about their motivations.

41:04.396 --> 41:08.239
They're lying about their insight or how they can't figure anything out.

41:08.259 --> 41:13.603
They get no fracking idea or they think it's an evolutionary thing or whatever.

41:14.144 --> 41:16.065
Double-stranded DNA is the most dangerous.

41:16.165 --> 41:17.126
Oh, it's mutating.

41:17.186 --> 41:18.267
Whatever it is they say.

41:20.776 --> 41:33.540
They're all wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly, they are misleading the young by insisting that nobody really scrutinize 2020, that nobody really pay any attention to what people were doing in 2020.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.941
And that's why I think it's important the work we're doing.

41:36.741 --> 41:38.462
Because if you believe this.

41:39.123 --> 41:39.643
So what do I do?

41:40.324 --> 41:41.025
I go to Des Moines.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.907
Ladies and gentlemen, the people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines.

41:43.927 --> 41:44.708
I lived there for four years.

41:45.088 --> 41:45.868
I go to Des Moines.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.631
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

41:49.411 --> 41:50.212
I go to Seattle.

41:50.772 --> 41:52.354
I infect a couple of cases there.

41:53.034 --> 41:54.796
I go to North Carolina.

41:54.976 --> 41:56.437
I go to Wisconsin.

41:56.797 --> 42:03.523
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

42:03.983 --> 42:05.225
These individuals complain.

42:05.285 --> 42:07.128
Again, this is a central nervous system condition.

42:07.368 --> 42:09.291
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

42:10.052 --> 42:14.719
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

42:15.420 --> 42:19.246
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

42:19.947 --> 42:21.509
I take attribution for that, yes.

42:21.829 --> 42:23.831
The real bug that we use is the internet.

42:23.871 --> 42:29.216
But what you need to understand is this is a public facing brochure presentation of what was really done.

42:29.856 --> 42:44.970
What was really done is that very skilled agents, very skilled members of a team and carefully recruited members of a team were unleashed mostly on the United States in order to control the perception of the early pandemic.

42:46.152 --> 42:49.833
Now, I don't know if Jessica Hockett's right, and it's much more fraud than it is murder.

42:50.234 --> 42:59.517
I don't know if Mark Hulak's right, and it's more murder than fraud because of the opioid epidemic and all these other things that are definitely being ignored by these meddlers.

42:59.957 --> 43:12.262
But I do know that if you ever question the central narrative of a novel virus with a strange disease that they've had multiple times, that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine work for,

43:14.867 --> 43:17.128
that you are not part of this group anymore.

43:17.168 --> 43:21.551
You will never get invited into this little circle of buddies.

43:22.911 --> 43:31.256
And I think the only reason why Brian Hooker or this lady from the NVIC are there is because that's how they do it.

43:32.416 --> 43:33.797
They absorb a couple of people.

43:33.857 --> 43:35.278
They let them also present.

43:35.378 --> 43:36.839
They make them feel part of the team.

43:36.879 --> 43:38.279
They get to be in the group picture.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.881
But in the end, the message was controlled.

43:42.339 --> 43:52.950
limited spectrum of debate was reinforced and the narrative that we're all supposed to eventually accept as common knowledge about a lab leak is also completely preserved.

43:54.291 --> 44:05.343
Brett Weinstein, of course, was a guy who was in a social signal chat with me for a year along with Chris Martinson and a few other people that are definitely notable in this narrative, but

44:05.822 --> 44:08.584
I'm a little afraid to mention because of legal issues.

44:09.445 --> 44:17.231
However, those people were essentially part of this same narrative that was trying to, I don't know why that didn't play.

44:17.812 --> 44:18.732
I guess we have to escape.

44:18.953 --> 44:21.615
We're probably running out of RAM in the 101st slide.

44:25.270 --> 44:35.033
And that's why it's interesting now that he's on with Russell Brand talking about Russell Brand's recent conversion to Christianity and whether or not God is real or not.

44:35.453 --> 44:37.533
Around the same timing a few weeks ago, right?

44:37.553 --> 44:47.616
We also had Jordan Peterson talking with that English guy, Pierce Morgan about God and whether he believes in God or not.

44:47.656 --> 44:52.237
And his answer pretty much was, well, I behave as if there is one.

44:54.007 --> 44:58.724
I work under the assumption that there is one, but he doesn't understand what you mean by believe.

45:00.196 --> 45:21.409
And it's not very dissimilar to what these two yo-yos talk about as they try to, I believe and I feel this kind of, well, you know, these old religions need to be universalized because there's so many universal truths that are evolutionary dependent or evolutionarily obvious or evolutionarily convergent or whatever other garbage he says.

45:21.449 --> 45:26.793
This is the worst kind of liars because they are working for the slavers.

45:28.737 --> 45:39.319
And that's why I find it very interesting that someone who calls my work noise is also promoting Brett Weinstein's appearance in Geneva with all these other people.

45:40.260 --> 45:46.141
These same actors, Robert Malone, Jessica Rose was rapping on stage in Geneva.

45:46.181 --> 45:49.442
And I will not ever, I promise, I make this promise to you.

45:49.942 --> 45:55.943
I will never use that video on my stream, even though it is absolutely hilarious.

45:57.028 --> 46:04.270
and I've downloaded every resolution of it possible and backed it up on every location possible, I will never make you watch it.

46:04.531 --> 46:14.774
But I assure you, if you ever need a laugh late night or you're drinking and you want to make someone spit out their drink, that's the video to look for.

46:19.457 --> 46:22.499
So here we are, you know, I still really think we're mapping it out here.

46:22.539 --> 46:24.980
And I think you can start to see the pattern very quickly.

46:25.020 --> 46:36.147
If you watch these people promote each other, you watch these people pat each other on the back and sell each other's books and, uh, and, and promote each other's podcasts and podcast appearance.

46:36.187 --> 46:38.248
You'll see why they never address these points.

46:38.348 --> 46:39.309
None of them ever will.

46:40.069 --> 46:40.710
They just won't.

46:43.746 --> 46:47.149
It's unfortunate, but they're just not going to address it because they know they can't.

46:47.269 --> 46:48.630
So I just want to give you a heads up.

46:49.751 --> 46:59.238
Justwritemedia.org slash blog slash archive slash 14 517, which I will now put in the chitty chat, right?

46:59.378 --> 47:00.098
I'm going to try that.

47:00.258 --> 47:00.479
Yes.

47:00.819 --> 47:01.159
Gotcha.

47:03.481 --> 47:03.881
Copy.

47:05.843 --> 47:06.183
Bang.

47:06.721 --> 47:07.362
That's one.

47:07.923 --> 47:13.933
And then here's the video and we might watch it tomorrow or we might watch it at some point because it is a pretty good video.

47:14.374 --> 47:20.964
This dude's a lawyer and he's got a pretty good basic take on the pandemic.

47:21.024 --> 47:21.245
Listen.

47:27.355 --> 47:30.237
I might not have queued it up correct, but it'll play.

47:30.597 --> 47:38.642
The reality is I'm convinced that modern societies, our society is not susceptible to pandemics.

47:39.362 --> 47:42.624
That's the one lie that underlies all the other lies.

47:43.225 --> 47:53.791
We are not susceptible to pandemics with the advent of modern antibiotics and the whole panoply of pharmacopedia

47:54.611 --> 48:01.873
of repurposed drugs that we have available to us to deal with any disease threat that may arise.

48:02.693 --> 48:11.596
So that we are subject to pandemics at all is the greatest lie.

48:12.096 --> 48:19.638
And anyone who advances a platform, news, advice, recommends vaccines,

48:20.441 --> 48:32.244
They need to go into the category of extreme suspicion because they're trying to sell you something based on fear and a fear which is wholly unjustified.

48:32.925 --> 48:35.745
Watch out for the purveyors of fear.

48:36.325 --> 48:37.966
They are probably lying.

48:38.737 --> 48:39.938
Now, I love that take.

48:40.038 --> 48:42.499
I know that there's some things we can say about that, right?

48:42.539 --> 48:44.080
We can say it, but he's a lawyer.

48:44.140 --> 48:54.446
So you can't expect him to have the sophistication of someone who has been reading biology his whole life and then turned to this pandemic and read as much as he could.

48:55.567 --> 48:56.787
He hasn't had time to do that.

48:56.827 --> 49:00.269
He's attacking the dragon from a different side.

49:01.050 --> 49:03.071
But he's really close to the truth here.

49:05.697 --> 49:12.859
I mean, pandemics, epidemics, these kinds of things are kind of the same.

49:12.879 --> 49:22.441
And the one problem that I have with it, and I'm sure that there are people in the chat who are going to hear it, is that he's saying the reason why is because of medicines and pharmaceuticals.

49:22.521 --> 49:27.802
It's not about sanitation or water or the things that we know got rid of polio and measles.

49:28.570 --> 49:32.453
And so, I'm a little skeptical, but I don't think this guy's a bad guy.

49:32.473 --> 49:39.098
I just think he needs to be shown that, okay, there's a ranking here, and you should first realize that

49:39.929 --> 49:47.952
You know, good sanitation, water purification, hygiene was essential to the first initial precipitous drop.

49:48.433 --> 49:58.097
And then, of course, we treat disease better and better and more successfully all the time, and people are not dying of secondary infection like they used to.

49:59.277 --> 50:27.542
We have to be very careful about how we talk about this because otherwise we're essentially reinforcing this idea that out there There are all these things that are that are out to get us or that are taking advantage of our weaknesses or whatever it is when in reality That's probably not an accurate way to think about our place in this in this molecular soup So I just I just wanted to make that clear And yeah, we will

50:29.793 --> 50:32.456
We will keep this playing because I know that they say a little bit more.

50:32.956 --> 50:34.518
Our guest today is Chess Crosby.

50:34.938 --> 50:38.282
Mr. Crosby was leader of the official opposition in Newfoundland from 2018 to 2021.

50:38.362 --> 50:41.746
As a lawyer, he has a background in medical malpractice and class actions.

50:46.107 --> 50:55.654
He did pro bono work for claimants to the 9-11 compensation scheme and worked on tobacco cases, which 20 years later are still in mediation.

50:55.815 --> 50:56.535
Oh, I like this guy.

50:56.555 --> 51:04.541
He believes that government overreaction to COVID-19 was so massive that Canada needs an equally massive no-fault compensation.

51:04.802 --> 51:12.708
So he thinks the overreaction was so massive and all I got to do then is just push him one step farther and realize that the overreaction was planned.

51:13.567 --> 51:18.433
And that's why they had this illusion of consensus from the very beginning that the worst case scenario might happen.

51:18.994 --> 51:20.215
A billion people dead.

51:21.277 --> 51:24.781
If we can just push somebody like Chess to that, whoa!

51:26.391 --> 51:28.473
Because then he becomes really powerful, right?

51:28.513 --> 51:35.278
Because then he can start to challenge them on real biological principles as well as legal and moral principles.

51:35.738 --> 51:38.860
And he becomes a very, very difficult force to reckon with.

51:39.381 --> 51:44.424
I would be very interested in talking to Chess Crosby from Newfoundland.

51:55.945 --> 51:58.126
So we got work to do, ladies and gentlemen.

51:58.706 --> 52:00.147
They are gonna continue to meddle.

52:00.327 --> 52:09.472
And so let's watch this, the first part or whatever we can get through of this podcast from December, 2020, again with Kevin McKernan.

52:10.372 --> 52:19.196
We're listening to Kevin McKernan because he rose very early in the response to the pandemic about very specific things.

52:19.636 --> 52:24.799
If you're not aware, he wrote a paper along with some other people, interesting people, in fact,

52:25.899 --> 52:34.724
about the methodological shortcomings of the PCR test as published by Drorsten and The Who.

52:36.505 --> 52:40.767
And in retrospect, it looks to me like a controlled op

52:41.876 --> 52:55.671
coordinated by a few people to tie together Mike Eden and Claire Craig and Thomas Binder and a few other very early outspoken people together on a unified front of objection to the PCR test.

52:56.152 --> 53:03.239
But it was a mealy-mouthed objection because it wasn't about the general usefulness of PCR, but the specific

53:05.064 --> 53:14.370
perceived shortcomings of a methodology proposed by Drorsten and circulated by the WHO, which again did not ask the right question.

53:14.410 --> 53:20.473
The right question was, can we roll out a PCR test and know anything about and get anything from the results?

53:20.513 --> 53:21.674
And the answer should have been no.

53:22.927 --> 53:24.008
but the answer wasn't no.

53:24.048 --> 53:29.312
The answer was that, oh, well, you know, there's primer dimers and blah, blah, blah.

53:29.612 --> 53:33.035
They might be false positives or there's, you know, things that don't work right.

53:33.075 --> 53:34.315
Cause their temperatures are off.

53:34.335 --> 53:36.257
There's like 10 different objections we have.

53:37.705 --> 53:46.655
But none of them are based on the objection that none of these PCR tests are being adequately shown to not pick up a ubiquitous background signal.

53:46.695 --> 53:48.817
In fact, nobody's even asking that question.

53:48.877 --> 53:57.286
In fact, I would argue that that paper got a bunch of those people together under the consensus that that wasn't even a relevant question.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.021
And so I do think it's very important.

54:02.041 --> 54:09.123
Kevin McKernan is one of the central players here, even if he wasn't originally meant to be, um, as central as he is now.

54:09.143 --> 54:13.105
I think it's probably the case.

54:13.765 --> 54:28.751
I think if anybody was not supposed to be as central as they are, it's Robert Malone, because he is a red thread that connects all of these people right back to these, you know, Kaprowski, Plotkin, uh, Baltimore and, uh,

54:29.645 --> 54:36.152
and Plotkin, Kaprowski, Baltimore, and Gallo.

54:37.974 --> 54:46.263
And so yeah, it's an extraordinary place where we are, so I'm gonna escape out of here, and then I do think I've got it all queued up already, if I'm lucky.

54:48.625 --> 54:49.987
And then I can make it big.

54:50.802 --> 54:55.664
And I'm doing it at regular speed because I'm going to pause and talk and we'll see what we can get through.

54:56.584 --> 55:02.086
The boys are going to basketball without me today, so I do have plenty of time to make this a long one.

55:03.006 --> 55:05.927
So if you need to get a drink or take a bathroom break, maybe now is the time.

55:05.947 --> 55:09.248
It says full screen.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.849
I don't know why it didn't go full screen yet.

55:12.056 --> 55:16.297
You know, even after the vaccine, they want masks and they want social distancing.

55:16.557 --> 55:24.219
And there doesn't seem to be any exit strategy for this, which is concerning because there is no scoreboard for the negative consequences of the reaction.

55:24.279 --> 55:26.119
That's just all getting swept under the rug.

55:26.379 --> 55:32.481
We see, we do see notes from, in many papers that have come out on the harms of lockdown, and they seem to be ignored.

55:33.101 --> 55:37.242
There's a lot of concern from the UN and others in third world countries, there's going to be starvation.

55:37.978 --> 55:45.734
I'm Christina Hudson-Kohler, an egg processing manager living in Syracuse, New York, and you are listening to the Vance Crowe Podcast.

55:47.062 --> 55:48.443
Welcome back to the podcast.

55:48.583 --> 55:49.664
I'm glad you're here.

55:50.124 --> 55:54.207
Today I'm interviewing a past guest, Kevin McKernan.

55:54.507 --> 55:59.371
Kevin is a scientist that once was working at MIT on the Human Genome Project.

55:59.811 --> 56:04.415
He has then separated, started his own company, built them up and he is an expert.

56:04.855 --> 56:13.901
So if we just stop it right here and point out that in the intro, the first, the two things that they emphasized was that the response is what hurt people and there's nobody accounting for that.

56:14.702 --> 56:16.023
And then he did a UN plug.

56:17.227 --> 56:18.988
You wanna hear it again, just in case you missed it?

56:19.708 --> 56:21.029
That's what he said, right?

56:21.189 --> 56:25.551
I mean, it was the response hurt people and nobody's keeping account of it and the UN.

56:26.211 --> 56:32.935
Even after the vaccine, they want masks and they want social distancing and there doesn't seem to be any exit strategy for this, which.

56:33.855 --> 56:38.078
is concerning because there is no scoreboard for the negative consequences of the reaction.

56:38.158 --> 56:39.999
That's just all getting swept under the rug.

56:40.259 --> 56:46.343
We do see notes in many papers that have come out on the harms of lockdown, and they seem to be ignored.

56:46.963 --> 56:51.186
There's a lot of concern from the UN and others in third world countries there's going to be starvation.

56:51.866 --> 56:59.551
I'm Christina Hudson-Kohler, an egg processing manager living in Syracuse, New York, and you are listening to the Vance Crowe podcast.

57:00.919 --> 57:02.320
Welcome back to the podcast.

57:02.440 --> 57:04.402
I'm glad you're here today.

57:04.482 --> 57:07.945
I'm interviewing a past guest, Kevin McKernan.

57:08.386 --> 57:13.250
Kevin is a scientist that once was working at MIT on the Human Genome Project.

57:13.691 --> 57:18.235
He has then separated, started his own company, built them up, and he is an expert

57:18.775 --> 57:24.478
in the PCR space, which is really an interesting space to be in during coronavirus.

57:24.538 --> 57:34.084
So we have a wild conversation about the details of those tests, those nasal swabs that people are having shoved up their noses and the rapid test.

57:34.124 --> 57:35.685
And what does the antigen test mean?

57:36.725 --> 57:39.567
And Kevin is one of those guys that I love staying in contact with.

57:39.647 --> 57:45.550
I watch him on Twitter and I find his perspective to be interesting if only because it's different.

57:45.730 --> 57:51.433
I happen to find Kevin to be intelligent, fair-minded, able to articulate complicated ideas.

57:51.813 --> 58:02.139
But even if he wasn't, I really love the fact that I'm able to explore ideas that... Isn't that pretty extraordinary that they let that webpage expire?

58:02.919 --> 58:04.120
I find it extraordinary.

58:04.180 --> 58:05.181
Nobody seems to care.

58:07.022 --> 58:11.446
that are not being published in other places, and I think that that is a really important thing.

58:11.787 --> 58:27.282
We're going to get to the interview, but one thing that you should be aware of is if you like conversations like this, if conversations with people that want to push the envelope, that they believe that their faith is best tested by going out and exploring the world, consider joining the Articulate Ventures Network.

58:27.742 --> 58:35.808
It is a place where we have big conversations about all kinds of complicated ideas and people have various perspectives that are not all in sync.

58:35.908 --> 58:44.434
And so it makes for much better conversations, but we have a culture around it that makes it a fun exploratory time where you can learn from and it makes your life better.

58:44.474 --> 58:51.499
So if you're interested in joining, join before the first of the year at network.articulate.ventures.

58:52.019 --> 58:55.642
So I'm going to head now to the interview with Dr. Kevin McKernan.

58:55.822 --> 58:56.302
Sorry about that.

58:56.322 --> 58:59.043
Kevin McKernan, welcome back to the podcast.

58:59.163 --> 58:59.744
Thank you.

58:59.864 --> 59:01.044
Yes, it's been too long.

59:02.585 --> 59:03.805
Miss Chandy about this stuff.

59:04.006 --> 59:04.726
What's new in the world?

59:04.746 --> 59:06.066
My, how the world has changed.

59:06.106 --> 59:17.891
So for anybody that is new to the podcast, Kevin McKernan was one of the very first guests I had on that was willing to take a contrary position to the national narrative about what was going on with coronavirus.

59:18.252 --> 59:23.434
And so I wonder if he'll accurately articulate what exactly was contrary.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.475
I don't mean it contrary as in like, it wasn't there.

59:26.975 --> 59:29.735
It was, let's think about the measures that we're taking.

59:30.075 --> 59:31.375
Let's lay out some lines.

59:31.416 --> 59:32.516
Let's talk about data.

59:33.276 --> 59:35.116
So he, he definitely does.

59:35.156 --> 59:48.679
He did not question the virus, but did question the measures in response.

59:52.833 --> 59:58.855
And that's pretty much the whole operation in a nutshell.

59:59.856 --> 01:00:15.322
And now he's supposed to be the go-to expert that keeps you away from questioning the fidelity of the PCR test or understanding what cycle threshold means versus the specificity of primers versus a clean

01:00:18.205 --> 01:00:30.612
distilled water background control or a distilled water plus a bacteriophage with a known sequence in it versus a nasal swab as the basis for a starting point of PCR.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:38.576
And all of these things, I'm sure they're not going to cover now, but I just want to predict it ahead of time so that you know what's happening here.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:44.380
This is narrating, this is sorry, curating the narrative like nobody ever did.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:44.720
Like a

01:00:46.098 --> 01:00:47.219
He was central.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:55.445
And man, you are the guy that I turn to when I say it's really easy to me to know what the national narrative is.

01:00:55.906 --> 01:00:58.588
But how do I know what other people are thinking?

01:00:58.608 --> 01:01:00.289
Because it's often pushed out of the world.

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:01.750
So what do you think?

01:01:02.691 --> 01:01:06.894
What is the status of coronavirus right now at the end of December of 2020?

01:01:09.019 --> 01:01:18.067
OK, well, my my sense of it is it would be much better if they didn't make a lot of these generic outpatient treatments illegal in our country.

01:01:18.327 --> 01:01:26.434
So for those who aren't familiar with ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, which we probably spoke about many months ago, those have proven to work really well in India.

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:32.179
And now we have doctors down at the Department of Homeland Security pounding the fist in the table to open them up for U.S.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:32.900
use.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.162
And I thought they were working in America.

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:38.787
That's interesting, right?

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:41.949
So there are no American accounts of ivermectin working right now.

01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:43.489
It's just in India.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:45.750
That's curious.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:55.454
I wonder, maybe that's true at December 2020, but he's actually telling a story now that India is the source of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin data, which is neat.

01:01:55.554 --> 01:01:56.554
I think that just happened.

01:01:57.435 --> 01:02:04.738
Ironically, like the week they made the vaccine available, they opened up those two, which is kind of incredible timing.

01:02:06.438 --> 01:02:13.601
But yeah, I think in India, they're seeing something like 90 or 80 or 90 deaths per million and maybe 100 deaths per million.

01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.682
And we're up at like 800 here in the States.

01:02:15.762 --> 01:02:22.985
And one of the things they do there is if you get symptoms, they don't tell you to wait around for a couple of weeks before coming to the hospital.

01:02:24.225 --> 01:02:25.846
They give you hydroxychloroquine out of the gate.

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.048
And I think the ivermectin data looks even better.

01:02:28.268 --> 01:02:33.371
So those are really cheap, off-patent drugs that haven't been used quite a bit here.

01:02:33.431 --> 01:02:36.974
And so we have a contagion here that's larger than it needs to be.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:45.600
At the same time, there's a lot of other folks I follow on Twitter that have some really good studies here, or will point you to a lot of good studies that demonstrate the excess deaths are

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.102
are barely exaggerated here in the news.

01:02:48.462 --> 01:02:50.804
We have this obsession of following PCR cases.

01:02:50.984 --> 01:02:55.948
So I think one of the things that is being done here, he said that ivermectin looks better than hydroxychloroquine.

01:02:56.008 --> 01:03:02.493
My feeling is, although I'm not going to claim to have the pharmaceutical or mechanistic

01:03:03.499 --> 01:03:04.720
definitive explanation.

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:25.820
But my feeling is, is that something that is essentially very, very much related to an ant poison, maybe even chemically identical to an ant poison, is less likely to help you with a respiratory disease than something like hydroxychloroquine, which at least in some pharmacological descriptions I've heard,

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.521
it is actually a zinc ionophore.

01:03:28.601 --> 01:03:31.143
So that's one of the problems here.

01:03:31.323 --> 01:03:52.417
Already we have a guy who could give us some mechanistic explanation for why it is that something that is normally an insecticide or a boticide or a parasite killer that you take once a season is something that can now be used against a respiratory disease, maybe even whenever people think they have it.

01:03:53.683 --> 01:04:02.466
And so it's an interesting thing to note that his primary argument is that his evidence is India and what he's read about India.

01:04:03.267 --> 01:04:04.227
He's not been to India.

01:04:04.267 --> 01:04:05.628
He's not done the study himself.

01:04:05.648 --> 01:04:07.809
I mean, he doesn't even have friends in India, my guess.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.271
And so it's a very curious thing.

01:04:13.511 --> 01:04:17.192
He said ivermectin looks better than hydroxychloroquine.

01:04:17.872 --> 01:04:21.374
Hydroxychloroquine was what Zev Zelenko pushed.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:31.454
and said that he treated a couple hundred people in Congress with, not ivermectin, which is now what all these people say is the miracle drug that also cures cancer.

01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:34.876
Ladies and gentlemen, they are liars.

01:04:36.348 --> 01:04:37.990
PCR cases are really not informative.

01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:39.932
You really have to look at deaths.

01:04:40.312 --> 01:04:42.074
And I know those come later.

01:04:42.114 --> 01:04:42.935
It's unfortunate.

01:04:42.995 --> 01:04:45.738
But the excess deaths are what's really critical.

01:04:45.858 --> 01:04:50.202
Every time this year, there are deaths that go up in the wintertime, something like 8,000 a day.

01:04:50.222 --> 01:04:50.863
And we are, in fact,

01:04:53.866 --> 01:04:54.026
I'm

01:05:09.056 --> 01:05:11.837
He's itemizing all of the death certificates, not all of them.

01:05:11.877 --> 01:05:15.678
I think he did a study of a couple thousand and noticed like 40% of them aren't really COVID deaths.

01:05:16.418 --> 01:05:23.080
So we've got a, I think a narrative in the news that likes to profit on this fear campaign.

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.340
And I don't know what's driving it.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:33.583
It's probably conspiratorial to go there, but it's not reflective of- It's not conspiratorial to say that they murdered people and then we're going to blame it on a lab leak.

01:05:34.369 --> 01:05:53.700
and that they put people who were connected to them for decades in place early on to make sure that as they slow rolled everybody to this understanding, both sides of this argument, both sides of this many faceted argument would come to that conclusion and essentially teach their children that that's the best explanation for what happened.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.824
The date of this podcast is the 30th of December, 2020.

01:06:03.217 --> 01:06:05.839
what's actually going on if you dig into the numbers.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.780
That's when it was released.

01:06:07.861 --> 01:06:09.081
I don't know when it was recorded.

01:06:09.101 --> 01:06:11.703
It was probably recorded before the 30th of December.

01:06:11.803 --> 01:06:13.525
The numbers are we have a second wave.

01:06:13.645 --> 01:06:20.850
One of the things you'll notice is that he doesn't say anything about the winter of severe disease and death, which they announced right before this, I think.

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.091
Or was that 2021?

01:06:22.251 --> 01:06:23.092
I don't remember anymore.

01:06:23.552 --> 01:06:24.072
I'll go back.

01:06:24.853 --> 01:06:26.415
Thanks for the interruption, Jessica.

01:06:26.475 --> 01:06:27.156
Good to see you here.

01:06:40.094 --> 01:06:46.760
So we've got, I think, a narrative in the news that likes to profit on this fear campaign.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.021
And I don't know what's driving it.

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:49.642
That's probably conspiratorial to go there.

01:06:50.262 --> 01:06:54.866
So was that a plug for Scott Jensen, who says there's only 40% of them aren't COVID?

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:55.787
So there is COVID.

01:06:56.948 --> 01:06:57.709
There is a virus.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:07.977
So apparently, Scott Jensen doesn't question that either or didn't at the time, so much so that he felt he could promote him, which is interesting.

01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:13.302
Um, it's, it's not reflective of what's actually going on.

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:17.083
If you dig into the numbers, uh, the numbers are, we have a second wave.

01:07:17.143 --> 01:07:18.003
That's really a ripple.

01:07:18.503 --> 01:07:28.026
Although if you look at the PCR data, it looks as big, if not bigger than the first wave, but it's just not pulling through in terms of, um, the IFR, the IFR, and this continues to go.

01:07:28.106 --> 01:07:36.908
And so what is key here to see, and I hope you can see it, um, is where is it?

01:07:39.537 --> 01:07:40.678
Oh, sorry, I gotta go like this.

01:07:41.358 --> 01:07:41.678
My bad.

01:07:43.219 --> 01:07:48.202
What's key to see here is what he's telling you are PCR cases aren't informative.

01:07:48.302 --> 01:07:48.683
Why?

01:07:49.743 --> 01:07:51.184
Not because they aren't cases.

01:07:51.264 --> 01:07:52.245
They are cases.

01:07:52.965 --> 01:07:59.869
He just got through telling you that we have another wave, although it's not manifesting in its IFR.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.752
It's not manifesting in its creating sickness.

01:08:04.758 --> 01:08:09.644
but he's absolutely positively not questioning that something is spreading.

01:08:10.706 --> 01:08:14.250
He's not questioning that the PCR has identified something spreading.

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:18.756
It looks even worse than last time, except people aren't as sick as last time.

01:08:20.572 --> 01:08:21.153
Can you see it?

01:08:21.713 --> 01:08:24.256
You have to see it very clearly before I can move on.

01:08:24.336 --> 01:08:28.600
This is extraordinary because again, this narrative is very specific.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.044
He talked about antibodies twice in a row since he's been to this podcast.

01:08:33.125 --> 01:08:37.929
Now he's here reinforcing the narrative that the PCR cases aren't informative.

01:08:38.009 --> 01:08:38.370
Why?

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.072
Not because they are not cases.

01:08:41.733 --> 01:08:44.614
Not because they're measuring on a pre-existing background.

01:08:44.994 --> 01:08:55.578
There is spread, it is monitoring it, and it's showing that the spread, despite how amazing it is and how with such high fidelity we can track it, it's not hurting anybody.

01:08:55.858 --> 01:08:57.739
At least not as many as they thought it was gonna.

01:08:57.999 --> 01:08:59.419
And so maybe they've overreacted.

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.320
Stop lying!

01:09:03.421 --> 01:09:17.808
I think John Ioannidis just put some work out demonstrating it approaching the flu now, which I think is what we spoke about back in March, is that this thing would eventually reach the flu, if not lower, because it'll probably reflect what most other coronaviruses do over time.

01:09:17.828 --> 01:09:30.974
And so asking the question of will this become just like the flu in the future is asking the wrong question because it accepts the fact that something was released or leaked and it's spread around because we can track it.

01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:35.371
Let's get better.

01:09:36.012 --> 01:09:38.212
And you understand the disease more.

01:09:38.232 --> 01:09:39.292
You understand who it affects.

01:09:39.312 --> 01:09:40.553
And you try to protect the vulnerable.

01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:42.913
And you do a better job at managing the disease.

01:09:42.953 --> 01:09:44.173
And the numbers improve over time.

01:09:44.253 --> 01:09:46.034
So yeah.

01:09:46.054 --> 01:09:54.616
So he's talking about a combination of learning what the right stuff is, and everybody building a little immunity, and the vaccine rolling out.

01:09:54.676 --> 01:09:56.816
And that's just the way these things work.

01:09:57.977 --> 01:09:59.337
Stop lying.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:03.458
I think there's a lot of problems in the PCR side of things.

01:10:03.498 --> 01:10:06.579
And that's what seems to be driving the panic and the fear.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.442
And a lot of that, I think, is a misunderstanding of what PCR is measuring.

01:10:12.502 --> 01:10:21.087
It's really not measuring your... Well, here, let's stop for a second, because one of the biggest differences between when you and I spoke the first time and now

01:10:21.707 --> 01:10:31.055
is that I didn't know anyone that had coronavirus, but we were watching videos of people laying dead bodies in the street and running away, right?

01:10:31.176 --> 01:10:36.180
So right now, it's been a little bit inverted, like we don't see those types of things.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.661
Now we maybe see hospitals.

01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:41.305
I don't watch regular news, so I don't I don't really have that much of a chance to see it.

01:10:41.365 --> 01:10:44.668
But but I do know people that have lost

01:10:45.228 --> 01:10:47.489
grandparents to coronavirus.

01:10:47.549 --> 01:10:52.971
I know people that are in their 50s going to the emergency room and getting put on ventilators.

01:10:53.511 --> 01:11:00.853
So, like, one thing that I hesitate as I'm hearing you describe this stuff is because I'm like, I don't know, man.

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:03.414
Seems like people got pretty sick with this one.

01:11:04.025 --> 01:11:06.405
Yeah, I'm not a denier.

01:11:06.585 --> 01:11:07.106
It's happening.

01:11:07.126 --> 01:11:09.266
Without a doubt, there's a virus spreading around.

01:11:10.526 --> 01:11:15.487
But you have to also put it in context to all the other numbers that are going on.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:16.727
The flu's disappeared.

01:11:18.027 --> 01:11:25.709
So this time last year, there's probably some coronavirus floating around that we all... So he can't adequately explain that the testing went away?

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:27.889
He's not going to say that at all?

01:11:27.969 --> 01:11:28.969
Flu disappeared?

01:11:29.509 --> 01:11:29.889
Really?

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.530
Please tell me he's going to stay on that.

01:11:34.943 --> 01:11:41.715
Because if he makes the argument right now that flu actually disappeared and coronavirus replaced it... Stop lying!

01:11:42.616 --> 01:11:47.044
I'm gonna laugh my... I'm gonna have a hard time controlling how long I laugh.

01:11:47.498 --> 01:11:48.058
called the flu.

01:11:48.078 --> 01:11:49.519
So we probably under called it last year.

01:11:49.539 --> 01:11:50.980
We're probably over calling it this year.

01:11:52.161 --> 01:11:53.742
So yeah, those things do happen.

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:57.905
There is a very large separation between the young and the old on this.

01:11:57.965 --> 01:12:03.468
I think it's about 1000 fold difference between the young and the old in terms of the the the mortality.

01:12:03.548 --> 01:12:12.934
So the older you are, especially when the old people go into the hospital with a low pulse ox and they get a supplementary oxygen and a kid goes into hospital, they probably don't.

01:12:14.212 --> 01:12:19.474
Kid can probably take supplemental oxygen a lot longer than an elderly patient can.

01:12:20.095 --> 01:12:22.196
Do you see it?

01:12:22.696 --> 01:12:23.416
Because I do.

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:28.679
Or if you're over 70, you're a thousand times more likely to die from this than you are if you are a child.

01:12:28.919 --> 01:12:33.521
But if the child is less than the flu, you also have to look at the average age of death.

01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:35.522
The average age of death is older than the average age.

01:12:36.442 --> 01:12:50.871
So this is a group of patients that are, unfortunately, in the last years of life, and this may be accelerating their demise, but it is not changing the overall statistics.

01:12:50.891 --> 01:12:54.053
But what about all the young people that died in New York, supposedly?

01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:55.434
What the hell's going on here?

01:12:56.533 --> 01:13:04.001
The whole argument in this first summer was that New York was evidence that everybody was vulnerable, that everybody needed to lock down.

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:06.003
The schools needed to stay closed.

01:13:06.043 --> 01:13:08.165
The schools are closed right now in December of 2020.

01:13:08.786 --> 01:13:12.610
My kids are using iPads and shitty Chromebooks.

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.892
That is still going on.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:16.013
And this started then.

01:13:16.074 --> 01:13:16.794
It was going on.

01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:17.895
This was the second year.

01:13:18.516 --> 01:13:30.719
College students had gone back to college, but under ridiculous circumstances, because people like Richard Ebright said that 250,000 people could die if we go back to college without some kind of controls.

01:13:31.959 --> 01:13:34.279
This guy's talking about focused isolation.

01:13:34.699 --> 01:13:40.241
We might as well isolate all these old people, because they are vulnerable, so we can separate people who've been married for 50 years.

01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:42.061
We wouldn't want them to kill each other.

01:13:45.102 --> 01:13:46.522
He's saying nothing!

01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:48.852
but what they want him to say.

01:13:50.273 --> 01:13:57.639
He's asking none of the questions that would enlighten the people that are listening to this except to trap them in the Scooby-Doo.

01:13:57.659 --> 01:14:02.223
It takes very significantly on the excess deaths.

01:14:03.124 --> 01:14:10.350
If you were to compare the excess deaths of this year to 2019, 2018, 2016, you can see spikes like this.

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:13.593
I think some really interesting work, I'll see if I can connect you to,

01:14:15.214 --> 01:14:16.315
I'm going to murder his name here.

01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:16.615
What is it?

01:14:16.635 --> 01:14:19.858
I think it's Daniel Rancourt.

01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:21.979
I have to get his spelling for you correctly.

01:14:22.019 --> 01:14:25.863
But he's done some work showing the timing of a lot of these deaths.

01:14:26.123 --> 01:14:31.327
And there's a really abnormal spike in the deaths last year, right after the WHO announced this as a pandemic.

01:14:32.087 --> 01:14:33.888
And it's synchronized, like all over the globe.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:34.748
You just don't get that.

01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:39.009
You usually get these waves of excess death that track seasonality around the globe.

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:45.271
But when the WHO announced this as a pandemic, you see this massive spike in excess mortality.

01:14:46.092 --> 01:14:48.653
So interesting to plug Denny Rancourt here.

01:14:52.774 --> 01:14:55.575
Denny Rancourt has not always been super helpful.

01:14:56.738 --> 01:14:56.858
me.

01:14:57.098 --> 01:15:11.445
He's been supportive, he's been a good guest, but on Twitter there's been a couple times where he's essentially, yeah, not been as helpful to me as he could have.

01:15:12.546 --> 01:15:18.649
Got some people's feathers ruffled at CHD when I was working there and kind of made me the focus of it.

01:15:21.274 --> 01:15:26.036
He also does not believe that there's anything nefarious that happened on 9-11.

01:15:26.076 --> 01:15:29.138
He does not believe there were explosions in the towers.

01:15:30.178 --> 01:15:36.422
He thinks it was a natural collapse, which is an extraordinary, quite remarkable stance to take as a physicist.

01:15:37.962 --> 01:15:41.744
And so as much as I want to believe in Denny Rancourt,

01:15:45.532 --> 01:15:51.357
I think Denny is being used one way or another, whether he likes it or not for a very specific part of the message.

01:15:52.578 --> 01:15:53.919
Um, and.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.202
At this stage, it might not have been clear really how they were going to use them.

01:15:58.282 --> 01:16:00.304
It might've been very clear how they were going to use them.

01:16:00.344 --> 01:16:04.948
They needed to get him in, in, in here, just like they got Dan Jensen in here, I guess.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.206
uh, that occurs within like a couple of weeks after.

01:16:08.386 --> 01:16:14.675
In Daniel, uh, Rancourt, I have, I have to get his spelling for you correctly, but you know, he's done some work showing.

01:16:14.755 --> 01:16:16.017
And he got his first name wrong.

01:16:16.057 --> 01:16:19.422
So maybe he's not really telling you anything, you know.

01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:21.666
The timing of a lot of these deaths.

01:16:21.966 --> 01:16:27.188
And there's a really abnormal spike in the deaths last year right after the WHO announced this as a pandemic.

01:16:27.928 --> 01:16:29.729
And it's synchronized all over the globe.

01:16:29.749 --> 01:16:30.569
You just don't get that.

01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:34.851
You usually get these waves of excess death that track seasonality around the globe.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:45.835
But when the WHO announced this as a pandemic, you see this massive spike in excess mortality that occurs within a couple of weeks after the WHO announcing this.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.616
And his theory is that that was manmade.

01:16:49.056 --> 01:16:54.298
Everyone started going into pandemic mode and started overventilating and perhaps mistreating this.

01:16:55.378 --> 01:17:01.981
So there is a contribution to our reaction to this disease that is elevating those excess deaths.

01:17:02.081 --> 01:17:04.362
So that's very, very succinctly absorbed.

01:17:04.722 --> 01:17:08.984
So we are acknowledging that Denny says that it looks like it was just a manmade thing.

01:17:09.464 --> 01:17:14.566
And then Kevin says very succinctly, so it looks like our response to the virus

01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:17.288
Caused a lot of people to get hurt.

01:17:23.196 --> 01:17:24.438
Damn, that's impressive.

01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:26.441
I'm gonna play that again.

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:31.491
2019, 2018, 2016, you can see spikes like this.

01:17:31.511 --> 01:17:37.774
I think some really interesting work, I'll see if I can connect you to, I'm going to murder his name here, what is it?

01:17:37.794 --> 01:17:41.016
I think it's Daniel Rancourt.

01:17:41.076 --> 01:17:43.137
I have to get his spelling for you correctly.

01:17:43.177 --> 01:17:46.979
But he's done some work showing the timing of a lot of these deaths.

01:17:47.279 --> 01:17:52.524
And there's a really abnormal spike in the deaths last year right after the WHO announced this as a pandemic.

01:17:53.245 --> 01:17:55.046
And it's synchronized all over the globe.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:55.907
You just don't get that.

01:17:55.967 --> 01:18:00.171
You usually get these waves of excess death that track seasonality around the globe.

01:18:00.612 --> 01:18:11.162
But when the WHO announced this as a pandemic, you see this massive spike in excess mortality that occurs within a couple of weeks after the WHO announcing this.

01:18:11.682 --> 01:18:13.963
And his theory is that that was manmade.

01:18:14.363 --> 01:18:19.585
Everyone started going into pandemic mode and started overventilating and perhaps mistreating this.

01:18:19.765 --> 01:18:32.209
So our argument is that a combination of fraud and murder was used to create mass casualty events that were misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen in New York City, perhaps in Italy, perhaps in a few other places.

01:18:33.389 --> 01:18:34.770
And the rest of it is nonsense.

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:46.550
confusion, frustration, and doubt reinforced by people like him who just make sure that whenever you try to get out of the cage that he's standing there going, no, no, no, back, back where he came from.

01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:48.051
No, no, no, no, not this way.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:49.673
That's the wrong question.

01:18:52.809 --> 01:18:59.371
So there is a contribution to our reaction to this disease that is elevating those excess deaths.

01:18:59.411 --> 01:19:08.114
We have to remember that some of those excess deaths could be cancer patients, they could be overdoses, they can be a lot of these things from lockdown that are also creating excess deaths.

01:19:08.694 --> 01:19:17.257
And the way that we're categorizing COVID-19 right now, we've never done this before where if you ever die, if you ever are PCR positive for COVID-19.

01:19:17.397 --> 01:19:18.978
Yeah, he did say overdose.

01:19:19.358 --> 01:19:22.079
Like in the last 28 days, you'll get labeled a COVID death.

01:19:22.219 --> 01:19:23.199
even if you get hit by a bus.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:28.380
So there's a lot of over-categorization of the disease now.

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.461
They're not- That sounds like hyperbole, right?

01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:33.121
Like that sounds like- No, it's just not.

01:19:33.181 --> 01:19:41.763
It's actually just part of the narrative because he's actually not saying what Denny Rencor said, which is there's no evidence of anything spreading.

01:19:44.604 --> 01:19:50.065
There's no epidemiological evidence of spread is what he carefully avoided saying.

01:19:52.250 --> 01:20:03.755
while making it seem like he's acknowledging that there are other there's miscategorization of death and stuff too so it's really just terrible we can't know anything this fifth generation warfare is almost impenetrable

01:20:04.701 --> 01:20:08.684
You're saying even if you get hit by a bus, I know it isn't bad.

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:10.746
Yeah, there's gunshot.

01:20:10.766 --> 01:20:13.048
There's gunshot victims that go down as COVID.

01:20:13.168 --> 01:20:15.270
I mean, so there are cases that are that extreme.

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:22.776
The exact frequency of those, I'll have to point you to Scott Jensen's work on it, because I think he did a little bit more itemization.

01:20:22.936 --> 01:20:24.017
Scott Jensen again.

01:20:24.838 --> 01:20:25.298
Interesting.

01:20:25.478 --> 01:20:27.679
I have, but it is happening.

01:20:27.919 --> 01:20:45.986
And there are, I've got family that work in the hospital space, and they certainly see oddities on their end as well, where they just see an over-categorization of it because there's liability for flu patients in hospitals, and there is basically liability waivers for COVID patients.

01:20:46.526 --> 01:20:51.788
Oh, so there's another reason why COVID became a thing.

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:54.630
Another reason why fraud was committed.

01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:56.813
Another reason why Jessica Hockett might be right.

01:20:56.853 --> 01:21:00.517
Because in New York in particular, there was a complete waiver.

01:21:02.304 --> 01:21:05.126
for COVID treatments, provided you follow the recommended protocol.

01:21:05.146 --> 01:21:06.627
This is extraordinary right here.

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.969
I think it's really, really key to see how extraordinary it is.

01:21:10.109 --> 01:21:12.870
And if you can, congratulations, you're right there with me.

01:21:13.311 --> 01:21:13.911
The hospital.

01:21:13.991 --> 01:21:16.252
So the first thing they test for is C-19.

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:22.896
And if it's endemic and you have it, but you might have it asymptomatically, but you have something else that's causing your health problems, you're going to go down.

01:21:23.277 --> 01:21:23.917
What did he say?

01:21:24.057 --> 01:21:24.878
And it's endemic?

01:21:25.782 --> 01:21:26.943
He did just say that, right?

01:21:27.463 --> 01:21:33.046
So did he just drop in the idea that COVID-19 is already endemic?

01:21:33.407 --> 01:21:43.813
Because six months from now, Bret Weinstein on his podcast with Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone is going to make the argument that prophylactic use of ivermectin by everybody on the planet for

01:21:44.453 --> 01:21:48.476
30 days would get rid of COVID forever and we could reach zero COVID.

01:21:48.797 --> 01:21:50.858
He's already suggesting that maybe it's endemic.

01:21:50.878 --> 01:22:05.729
You know, like that, that journalist named Garrett, who in the CNN video before the pandemic said that the worst case scenario with one of these lab leak epidemics is that it becomes endemic and we're stuck with it forever as an additional disease that we've all got to cope with.

01:22:06.649 --> 01:22:08.431
It's all one story.

01:22:09.131 --> 01:22:12.474
It's all one story with many tellers.

01:22:13.717 --> 01:22:14.638
And they're all liars.

01:22:14.818 --> 01:22:15.799
Patients in the hospitals.

01:22:15.859 --> 01:22:18.141
So the first thing they test for is C-19.

01:22:18.161 --> 01:22:26.549
And if it's endemic and you have it, but you might have it asymptomatically, but you have something else that's causing your health problems, you're going to go down in the record as a COVID death.

01:22:27.868 --> 01:22:30.830
So we have a lot of data to unwind here.

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:34.012
I'm not suggesting I have the- It's going to take a long time.

01:22:34.072 --> 01:22:40.558
He's not suggesting that he has all the answers, but it's never crossed his mind in 2020 that maybe they just lied about it.

01:22:40.598 --> 01:22:51.907
Maybe they're just murdering people and lying about it so that the pandemic potential that's implied in the literature can be permanently accepted by the masses as common knowledge.

01:22:54.724 --> 01:23:01.310
like Chris Martenson explained on his podcast two days ago, 24 hours ago, 14 hours ago.

01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:02.651
Higher answer.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:09.458
It is a disease we need to take seriously, but I think the proportionality of the response is actually doing more harm than good.

01:23:09.847 --> 01:23:20.992
Well, and like you can see when you just described about the doctors maybe overreacting to coronavirus, like all of a sudden seeing a patient and saying these symptoms add up to coronavirus.

01:23:21.232 --> 01:23:28.416
And and so therefore going down that path as opposed to looking at other reasons why they could be getting sick.

01:23:29.016 --> 01:23:32.538
And that's something that, like, you could feel that in the air.

01:23:32.678 --> 01:23:40.101
And I think when you go back and reference, like, you know, when our children say, what was it like when coronavirus was going on?

01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:40.861
See?

01:23:41.461 --> 01:23:41.702
See?

01:23:42.762 --> 01:23:47.104
When our children ask, what was it like when coronavirus was going on?

01:23:48.104 --> 01:23:50.205
You will pass on this mythology.

01:23:51.446 --> 01:23:56.248
And it will be common knowledge that the most likely source was a gain of function lab leak.

01:23:57.927 --> 01:24:07.355
unless we beat these people, unless we reject these people and engage in informed noncompliance by rejecting them.

01:24:07.735 --> 01:24:16.862
You got to remember how intensely scared and worked up people were and how much that would cloud their judgment on every other thing.

01:24:17.603 --> 01:24:25.592
And it seems odd to me that all of the restrictions that they put in place when they were in panic mode are still the exact same ones.

01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:34.321
Nobody's been like, okay, okay, now that the craziness has happened, now we can look at what's working and what's not, and let's roll some of these back.

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:38.226
All of them are still on in full force, if not harder now.

01:24:39.096 --> 01:24:40.477
Yeah, that's concerning.

01:24:40.517 --> 01:24:47.084
I was hoping some of that would die away with the whole election being behind us, but obviously this is global and that's not happening.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:56.452
We still see a continued focus on, you know, even after the vaccine, they want masks and they want social distancing and there doesn't seem to be any exit strategy for this, which

01:24:57.373 --> 01:25:01.594
is concerning because there is no scoreboard for the negative consequences of the reaction.

01:25:01.654 --> 01:25:03.515
That's just all getting swept under the rug.

01:25:03.535 --> 01:25:10.317
So now he's kind of announcing that there's no exit strategy, that this is going to go on and on, because I think it was always meant to go on and on.

01:25:10.377 --> 01:25:15.539
They just didn't expect to be where they were, where the vaccine was released already at the end of 2020.

01:25:16.359 --> 01:25:21.621
That, ladies and gentlemen, that I think is the problem.

01:25:21.681 --> 01:25:25.642
I think they maybe even wanted to do adenovirus longer.

01:25:29.051 --> 01:25:30.131
That might have been the plan.

01:25:30.612 --> 01:25:36.394
And then to withdraw the adenovirus in a much bigger show, and that part of it was accelerated.

01:25:38.255 --> 01:25:39.455
And now we're already there.

01:25:39.495 --> 01:25:40.956
We're getting through it right now, right?

01:25:40.976 --> 01:25:42.276
In December, they're still out there.

01:25:42.336 --> 01:25:45.898
AstraZeneca and J&J, there's people still taking it, I think, in December here.

01:25:46.431 --> 01:25:52.615
and the mRNA is about to come out or it's available to the people on Hollywood sets and on newscasting sets.

01:25:52.635 --> 01:25:56.297
They're all getting the fat mRNA from process one.

01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:58.018
They're all being told it's great.

01:25:58.519 --> 01:26:00.720
You're part of a priority list of people.

01:26:01.401 --> 01:26:04.983
That's all going on right now in the context of this video.

01:26:07.344 --> 01:26:18.608
My friend Annie Wershing is probably taking a shot so that she can be on set with Captain Picard as the Borg Queen right now, December 2020.

01:26:20.188 --> 01:26:29.331
And then one year later, she will develop a really fast brain cancer and die and leave a family of three and a loving husband behind.

01:26:29.411 --> 01:26:32.493
That's what's happening right now in 2020 in December.

01:26:37.816 --> 01:26:52.123
And I'm not adequately equipped to explain to Annie or my friend Nathan in Chicago that you can't take these transfections because what they're telling you isn't right.

01:26:52.784 --> 01:26:53.884
I couldn't articulate it.

01:26:54.885 --> 01:26:59.887
I didn't see that virology was really an illusion because people had convinced me that that would be crazy.

01:27:01.348 --> 01:27:06.731
I had done experiments with adenovirus before, so I thought, wow, I mean, we must, there must be something out there.

01:27:11.584 --> 01:27:18.653
And about a month later after this video, a month later, maybe even a couple weeks, Kevin McKernan will be on my stream for the first time.

01:27:22.038 --> 01:27:23.660
And you're darn right we're gonna watch it.

01:27:24.602 --> 01:27:31.243
drug, we do see notes in many papers that have come out on the harms of lockdown, and they seem to be ignored.

01:27:31.883 --> 01:27:43.346
There's a lot of concern from the UN and others in third world countries there's going to be starvation, and at scale that just dwarfs by orders of magnitude the coronavirus deaths that are on the table.

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:47.566
So the proportionality in response is just gone.

01:27:47.907 --> 01:27:49.707
And I think a lot of people are frustrated

01:27:50.847 --> 01:27:53.349
that the people running the show have conflicts of interest.

01:27:53.389 --> 01:27:55.950
At least I hear a lot of this about the SAGE group in the UK.

01:27:56.531 --> 01:27:58.612
We need that anecdotal knowledge.

01:27:58.692 --> 01:28:02.995
Why was the vaccine not supposed to be available until 2025 and how do you know it?

01:28:03.015 --> 01:28:04.876
It would be great for you to share that with us.

01:28:04.936 --> 01:28:05.316
Thank you.

01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:09.819
Those people are involved in either testing companies or vaccine companies.

01:28:10.039 --> 01:28:12.901
So they see the science through the solution they have in their hand.

01:28:14.161 --> 01:28:16.844
And I don't, you know, we're all human.

01:28:16.884 --> 01:28:17.624
I can see that happening.

01:28:17.664 --> 01:28:20.406
If you happen to be in that field, you're going to be very pro-vaccine.

01:28:21.067 --> 01:28:22.568
What if you're in the field of testing?

01:28:22.608 --> 01:28:24.109
Are you going to be very pro-testing?

01:28:24.129 --> 01:28:30.354
Because Kevin McKernan's in the field of testing because his friend Buckholtz is in the field of testing.

01:28:30.394 --> 01:28:35.979
And right now in 2020, Buckholtz isn't concerned about contamination in the process too shot.

01:28:36.339 --> 01:28:38.861
He's helping the government develop PCR tests.

01:28:41.192 --> 01:28:45.833
He's working with the CDC and the NIH to develop sequencing primer sets.

01:28:47.473 --> 01:28:53.735
Buck Holtz, the guy who said that the DNA is really only a worry for his daughter.

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:56.675
I mean, he'd still give the shot to his grandparents and his parents.

01:28:56.715 --> 01:28:59.856
I mean, of course, it's not that dangerous for them, they're old.

01:29:01.496 --> 01:29:03.797
That's what he said in front of the South Carolina Senate.

01:29:03.817 --> 01:29:05.717
You can go back and look, it's still on YouTube.

01:29:08.118 --> 01:29:09.478
And these people promote each other.

01:29:10.748 --> 01:29:12.049
And he's just admitting it right here.

01:29:12.069 --> 01:29:15.931
I mean, if you're into the testing, then you're going to, you know, be advocate for testing.

01:29:15.971 --> 01:29:18.433
If you're into the vaccines, you're going to advocate for the vaccine.

01:29:18.813 --> 01:29:21.295
And so he's telling us mostly the truth.

01:29:24.376 --> 01:29:30.160
But every time you get close to the brick wall, he turns you around and gets you to walk right back to the beginning of the middle of the cage, right?

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.641
You're about to hit the chain link.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:33.302
He turns you around again.

01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:35.091
to a

01:29:51.148 --> 01:29:51.668
We're all human.

01:29:51.688 --> 01:29:52.448
I can see that happening.

01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:55.050
If you happen to be in that field, you're going to be very pro-vaccine.

01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:57.392
And I think what Pfizer has done is amazing.

01:29:57.592 --> 01:30:01.014
The technology they have behind that vaccine is just stunning what they've pulled off.

01:30:01.575 --> 01:30:02.095
We're all human.

01:30:02.115 --> 01:30:02.876
I can see that happening.

01:30:02.896 --> 01:30:05.477
If you happen to be in that field, you're going to be very pro-vaccine.

01:30:05.517 --> 01:30:07.999
And I think what Pfizer has done is amazing.

01:30:08.019 --> 01:30:11.442
The technology they have behind that vaccine is just stunning what they've pulled off.

01:30:11.482 --> 01:30:14.043
They've synthesized, I think it's 4,284 base long RNA.

01:30:16.705 --> 01:30:17.866
30 micrograms in every injection.

01:30:17.886 --> 01:30:19.327
That's an incredible synthesis feat.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.469
When you have to like five prime cap it, they change.

01:30:21.489 --> 01:30:22.189
What does that mean?

01:30:22.349 --> 01:30:23.630
It's like, slow that way down.

01:30:24.411 --> 01:30:25.832
They have to make this RNA model.

01:30:25.972 --> 01:30:30.075
He is so impressed with their ability to manufacture the RNA.

01:30:31.116 --> 01:30:32.517
It is really a feat.

01:30:33.717 --> 01:30:35.178
And so is anybody going to doubt it?

01:30:36.119 --> 01:30:40.823
Is anybody going to hear him and say, well, I guess if he says it's great, I mean, that's pretty badass.

01:30:40.843 --> 01:30:43.404
That's a pretty big ass seal approval now, isn't it?

01:30:44.265 --> 01:30:44.946
Stop lying!

01:30:47.699 --> 01:30:49.960
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, give me a break.

01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:53.943
Molecule that's 4,284 letters long.

01:30:53.983 --> 01:30:56.004
That's a very hard RNA molecule to make.

01:30:56.845 --> 01:31:06.450
And in the process of doing so, they've had to put in pseudouracil inside of every, they replaced one base in there, the uracil base with a different one called pseudouracil.

01:31:07.011 --> 01:31:13.094
It's a non-native nucleotide, but they do this because that nucleotide protects the RNAs from getting degraded by nucleases.

01:31:13.194 --> 01:31:14.835
So it lasts longer in your system.

01:31:14.895 --> 01:31:15.736
It doesn't just get eaten up.

01:31:15.796 --> 01:31:21.882
It's not going to cause frame shifts or spontaneous stop codons or wobble bases at all.

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:25.850
That's not going to be a problem there, Mr. Human Genome Project?

01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:27.491
Not by yourselves.

01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:31.233
And then they also put a five prime cap on it and a three prime cap.

01:31:31.253 --> 01:31:34.515
These are things that protect the RNA from degrading as quickly as it does.

01:31:35.416 --> 01:31:41.620
And that's been the main weakness of the approach, which is why you need two injections, is that the RNA is not replication competent.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.361
It doesn't replicate on its own.

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:50.906
Why would he use the words the RNA is not replication competent unless he wanted you to understand the idea of replication competence?

01:31:53.496 --> 01:31:56.499
to seed the idea of replication competence.

01:32:00.563 --> 01:32:06.329
Because viruses are replication competent, but the RNA molecule is not.

01:32:08.311 --> 01:32:10.233
Please tell me I'm not wasting my time here.

01:32:10.733 --> 01:32:11.434
Stop lying!

01:32:12.355 --> 01:32:13.176
I got to play that again.

01:32:14.594 --> 01:32:18.079
there, the uracil base with a different one called pseudouracil.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:24.729
It's a non-native nucleotide, but they do this because that nucleotide protects the RNAs from getting degraded by nucleases.

01:32:24.829 --> 01:32:26.471
So it lasts longer in your system.

01:32:26.511 --> 01:32:28.774
It doesn't just get eaten up by your cells.

01:32:29.575 --> 01:32:35.082
And so there's no mention of transfection being wholly inappropriate to augment the immune system of healthy people.

01:32:35.242 --> 01:32:36.043
None at all.

01:32:36.163 --> 01:32:50.059
No mention of what possible crazy sorts of small RNAs might be created by substituting every uracil with a pseudouridine that can cause premature stop codons whenever the wobble base happens.

01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:52.751
And that's separate, sorry.

01:32:53.412 --> 01:33:00.178
Premature stop codons are separate from... And what is a premature stop codon other than the ribosome just falling off the transcript?

01:33:01.319 --> 01:33:04.282
I don't think there's any way to mechanistically differentiate between the two.

01:33:04.362 --> 01:33:07.304
So every once in a while, it hits a pseudouridine and falls off.

01:33:08.445 --> 01:33:11.548
And so you get these incomplete translations of those RNAs.

01:33:11.588 --> 01:33:13.130
Will those RNAs interfere with...

01:33:14.551 --> 01:33:15.532
native transcription?

01:33:15.572 --> 01:33:16.052
We don't know.

01:33:16.092 --> 01:33:21.596
Will those RNAs provoke an incorrect translation of a partial protein?

01:33:21.616 --> 01:33:22.016
We don't know.

01:33:22.816 --> 01:33:23.417
He doesn't know.

01:33:23.857 --> 01:33:28.740
He's not even going to mention that yet because it's not time in the narrative for him to mention any of these things.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.743
But now in 2024, it's fine for him every once in a while to measure them.

01:33:32.883 --> 01:33:33.903
Most of the time he doesn't.

01:33:33.943 --> 01:33:36.205
He just says double-stranded DNA over and over again.

01:33:36.673 --> 01:33:39.715
And then they also put a five prime cap on it and a three prime cap.

01:33:39.735 --> 01:33:42.977
These are things that protect the RNA from degrading as quickly as it does.

01:33:42.997 --> 01:33:49.641
Uh, and that's been the main weakness of the approach is just why you need two injections is that the RNA does not, is not replication.

01:33:49.881 --> 01:33:54.724
So he's actually arguing that two injections is the right way to go here too, which is also interesting.

01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:56.285
I don't even know.

01:33:56.305 --> 01:34:01.048
I'm not really taking notes cause I'm just so flabbergasted, but let's see.

01:34:01.468 --> 01:34:04.230
Um, yeah.

01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:06.191
So Pfizer is, is, is amazing.

01:34:12.544 --> 01:34:20.270
And pseudouridine is a thing.

01:34:22.632 --> 01:34:24.854
It's not a dangerous thing or a weird thing.

01:34:24.894 --> 01:34:27.777
They just did that because, you know, it's a Nobel Prize winning idea.

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:36.924
I mean, if you can't see it, that this is just an absolute horrible liar and a traitor,

01:34:37.796 --> 01:34:50.643
who is all about working for the national security state that he cut his teeth working for back in the day with the Human Genome Project, MIT, Francis Collins, Tony Fauci, Lederberg, all these people.

01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:55.406
I have no doubt in my mind he's probably smoked a cigar with David Baltimore.

01:34:57.274 --> 01:35:01.038
It doesn't replicate on its own, per se, inside your cells.

01:35:01.098 --> 01:35:04.801
So it has to be there long enough for some protein to get made for your immune system.

01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:12.988
Can you imagine the barbecues that they've had at his palatial house on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean outside of Boston and Marblehead?

01:35:13.629 --> 01:35:16.131
Can you imagine the kind of barbecues that were there?

01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:19.514
Who was there when he was a teenager and his dad was throwing a barbecue?

01:35:20.655 --> 01:35:24.198
Who was there when he was working for the Human Genome Project and they threw a barbecue?

01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:27.811
Think about it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:27.871 --> 01:35:29.872
Think very carefully.

01:35:30.793 --> 01:35:33.755
To recognize it, but it needs two injections to do it.

01:35:33.815 --> 01:35:39.838
But that's an absolute stunning feat of DNA synthesis or RNA synthesis.

01:35:39.938 --> 01:35:41.179
It's just they've done an amazing job.

01:35:41.259 --> 01:35:41.740
It's both.

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.381
It's DNA and RNA synthesis.

01:35:44.461 --> 01:35:45.362
Please clarify.

01:35:45.882 --> 01:36:10.355
up there but um it's been rushed injections to do it but that's an absolute stunning coming of it's coming dna synthesis here it comes rna synthesis it's just they've done an amazing job there but um it's been rushed uh you know i'm not jumping in front of line to get to it i'm going to kind of wait and see what happens it's been rushed um so if you're involved in that it's just they've done an amazing job there but um it's been rushed it's been rushed who rushed it

01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:16.530
Lying!

01:36:17.031 --> 01:36:17.731
Who rushed it?

01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:21.193
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:36:21.914 --> 01:36:23.274
Was Donald Trump who rushed it?

01:36:23.955 --> 01:36:26.416
In fact, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:26.556 --> 01:36:29.458
at a Bitcoin conference just said it.

01:36:30.679 --> 01:36:32.380
Last week, I showed you the video.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.261
A couple days ago, I showed you the video.

01:36:36.062 --> 01:36:38.343
All these sponsors, him on stage.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:41.285
Trump did the lockdown.

01:36:43.787 --> 01:36:45.668
Trump is responsible for the vaccines.

01:36:48.439 --> 01:36:49.519
They changed the script.

01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.180
Wasn't supposed to be like that.

01:36:57.282 --> 01:36:58.262
I'm pretty convinced.

01:36:58.822 --> 01:37:01.703
And that's why we're so far off kilter now.

01:37:02.143 --> 01:37:07.084
Why it's so easy to see these meddlers that they had to have Epigirl rap in Geneva.

01:37:08.765 --> 01:37:09.365
She rapped!

01:37:13.829 --> 01:37:14.670
I can beatbox.

01:37:15.471 --> 01:37:17.593
I'm not jumping in front of the line to get to it.

01:37:17.613 --> 01:37:19.054
I'm going to kind of wait and see what happens.

01:37:19.114 --> 01:37:25.080
So if you're involved in that, I think everyone's high-fiving each other over what a feat that is.

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:29.884
And actually, that's going to probably skew your interpretation of what should be done with coronavirus.

01:37:30.985 --> 01:37:36.190
I know that Peter Cullis was moved to a scotch after he heard that it was 95% effective.

01:37:37.964 --> 01:37:46.610
I'm a little concerned that there's so much regulatory capture in a lot of these agencies that we're not really seeing the true science filter through here.

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:49.733
We're seeing the lobbied interests run the show.

01:37:50.113 --> 01:37:56.778
And that's a little bit of, I don't know how to reverse that other than a change in how the media is operating right now.

01:37:56.798 --> 01:38:00.801
Because I think a lot of the media is in fact captured by many of these organizations.

01:38:01.261 --> 01:38:06.585
Well, so you're an interesting character in that you, media is captured by who?

01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:11.245
He's not aware of the CIA and the government working with the media.

01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:12.306
That's kind of weird, right?

01:38:14.127 --> 01:38:18.070
He's not very sophisticated on some fronts, but boy, is he an expert on PCR.

01:38:19.309 --> 01:38:28.659
really despise or dislike the regulation that goes into the world of medicine and the application of it?

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.862
I don't despise the idea of standards and regulation.

01:38:31.922 --> 01:38:39.470
I despise when they're centralized and they're easily bought off because that tends to create a lot more power for the incumbent than it does for the entrepreneur.

01:38:40.471 --> 01:38:46.917
And that's, it seems to be, our government, the larger it gets, it seems to be more prone to this, right?

01:38:46.977 --> 01:38:55.765
So when you looked at what happened with hydroxychloroquine and with ivermectin, you've got physicians from around the world that are screaming to get this to people.

01:38:55.965 --> 01:38:59.168
These are generic drugs that had safety profiles that were well understood.

01:38:59.268 --> 01:39:01.330
Why the hell were those held back in the United States?

01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:16.663
and the only pattern you can put together, and granted this is connecting dots and maybe deemed conspiratorial, but is that they were trying to promote Remdesivir, which was patented and $3,000 a pop, as opposed to $20 solutions that were generic and there weren't really a

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:19.224
an advocate for in Congress.

01:39:19.444 --> 01:39:30.727
And so he's laying down a narrative, a Scooby-Doo mystery with bad guys that were trying to protect Remdesivir from an EUA by getting rid of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.

01:39:30.767 --> 01:39:33.767
And you're now asking a multilayered bad question.

01:39:35.008 --> 01:39:39.028
In fact, I asked that multilayered bad question for almost two years.

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:43.489
And I asked that question with respect to the

01:39:46.738 --> 01:39:59.192
the vaccine as well, thinking that they were hiding hydroxychloroquine ivermectin because they wanted to protect the EUA of the coming vaccines.

01:40:01.294 --> 01:40:07.021
And these were all questions that do not get at the heart of this, which is what that lawyer Chess said.

01:40:09.141 --> 01:40:13.464
which is that if you say that there's pandemic potential in the world, you're a liar.

01:40:13.504 --> 01:40:16.806
If you've been saying there's pandemic potential in the world, you're a liar.

01:40:16.846 --> 01:40:25.451
If you're saying that that pandemic potential can be monitored by a bunch of different PCR product tests called diagnostics, you're a liar.

01:40:26.112 --> 01:40:36.939
If you say that we have 15 million high-fidelity sequences of a novel virus that just developed from between 80 and 40 years ago in the rural parts of China, you are a liar.

01:40:39.397 --> 01:40:40.578
Kevin McCurden's a liar.

01:40:40.658 --> 01:40:53.092
He plays for whatever weaponized piles of money have orchestrated the controlled demolition of America by paying these traders inside our government, inside the public sector.

01:40:53.973 --> 01:40:56.376
They're all part of the same controlled demolition.

01:40:56.396 --> 01:40:58.178
A lot of them are foreigners.

01:40:58.238 --> 01:41:00.681
A lot of them have different passports.

01:41:02.748 --> 01:41:10.514
All of them, all of them have connections to the beginning of the pandemic and dubiously knowing things like the spike has gained a function.

01:41:12.195 --> 01:41:16.558
Where's any of the data on the fact that the RNA was a smear?

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.682
That data is not out yet, but he's gonna come on my stream and tell me all about it.

01:41:26.525 --> 01:41:29.367
And seed a narrative of process two.

01:41:30.489 --> 01:41:37.093
He tried twice to come on my stream and see the narrative of Process 2 before they ever admitted there was a Process 2.

01:41:37.953 --> 01:41:45.097
Before I was even aware of this, how this all connected with regard to infectious clones in the literature.

01:41:46.978 --> 01:41:51.281
This is such a wonderful video because it shows so starkly

01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:59.041
What did I say at the beginning of the stream?

01:41:59.081 --> 01:42:00.541
What did I want to put in?

01:42:00.741 --> 01:42:01.902
I wanted to do it different.

01:42:02.302 --> 01:42:09.164
I was actually going to start with this song, which starts with a very, very curious statement.

01:42:10.444 --> 01:42:15.306
A stained soul cringes at the small details in the mirror of embarrassment.

01:42:18.447 --> 01:42:19.647
We'll start with that one tomorrow.

01:42:20.607 --> 01:42:25.069
These people with their stained souls, all we got to do is show them in the mirror.

01:42:26.164 --> 01:42:29.827
show them what they themselves said and everybody could see them for who they are.

01:42:31.128 --> 01:42:34.671
I'm not, I'm not doing anything that Kevin isn't doing to himself.

01:42:36.193 --> 01:42:44.780
This video that was never censored on YouTube just like the previous two that are still available on YouTube despite his going against the narrative.

01:42:50.126 --> 01:43:00.589
The generic owners of these drugs aren't pooling their resources to go and present to Congress why their drug should be at the front line, or trying to court Fauci over what should be the standard of care.

01:43:00.609 --> 01:43:02.909
But the standard of care was the worst drug we had.

01:43:03.329 --> 01:43:09.631
If you look at all the studies on remdesivir, it's clearly the shittiest drug we've got for this, yet it became the standard of care.

01:43:10.331 --> 01:43:12.612
And I can only explain that by regulatory capture.

01:43:12.972 --> 01:43:13.812
I don't have proof of it.

01:43:14.372 --> 01:43:19.376
But I think the standard of care was supplemental oxygen for people with low pulse ox.

01:43:19.456 --> 01:43:27.381
I think the standard of care was for a long time to ventilate people after they had pain from the supplemental oxygen.

01:43:27.421 --> 01:43:38.650
And I think that they want you to think about remdesivir so that you chase the videos of Rick Bright and you chase the videos of all these guys talking about snake venom to come.

01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:40.691
They're going to come.

01:43:40.731 --> 01:43:41.632
They're not coming yet.

01:43:41.692 --> 01:43:42.232
They're coming.

01:43:42.552 --> 01:43:42.833
You see?

01:43:43.732 --> 01:43:45.675
You have to see this where it is in the timeline.

01:43:45.695 --> 01:43:51.663
He's setting all those things up like tea, like balls on a tea for the people that come after him to go.

01:43:54.366 --> 01:43:59.350
And more parts of this narrative are people are chasing more balls in the wrong direction all through the cave.

01:43:59.550 --> 01:44:01.252
But no data supports it.

01:44:01.632 --> 01:44:04.234
And yet it gets it gets front lines.

01:44:04.754 --> 01:44:06.056
And then we had all of these things.

01:44:06.456 --> 01:44:09.038
You're like a super serious scientist.

01:44:09.198 --> 01:44:16.544
So have you found yourself in the past in this same kind of like conspiratorial warped world?

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:16.864
Like to me?

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:20.169
This is like, this has to be like an observation.

01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:21.892
So it's never happened to him before.

01:44:22.112 --> 01:44:24.296
Science was fine before the pandemic.

01:44:24.396 --> 01:44:25.238
Now it's crazy.

01:44:30.492 --> 01:44:31.452
Wow, that was a good one.

01:44:31.592 --> 01:44:40.775
Alarming experience for you as as like somebody that is now crossed the Rubicon and started questioning orthodoxy.

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:50.258
But like to the extent that you're saying this is a grand conspiracy, like people are making huge sums of money over this and we may want to look at.

01:44:50.918 --> 01:44:52.380
I don't know that it has to be very grand.

01:44:52.420 --> 01:45:00.046
I think you can have lots of parallel entities that have interests that happen to align, and that they're all pushing for the same thing.

01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:03.889
And so it looks like a scientific consensus to those that are in power trying to make decisions.

01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:09.554
And their attention is always paid to the people who have top dollar, and that's just how the political system works.

01:45:10.594 --> 01:45:16.659
You know, you don't necessarily need to have, you know, some type of great reset level of conspiracy to make this happen.

01:45:16.699 --> 01:45:23.645
Like, this could simply happen out of market forces when the market is so disturbed by— It could also be a mass psychosis, right?

01:45:23.685 --> 01:45:27.988
You know, it just happens, you know, where people go crazy and they run off a cliff.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:37.584
You know, like that guy who's at the Senate meeting from Belgium who says that it's a mass psychosis.

01:45:37.644 --> 01:45:45.572
And actually, when the Breggans spoke out against that mass psychosis idea is when, when Robert Malone started to sue them.

01:45:46.893 --> 01:45:54.421
Still on the fence with the Breggans because they have this huge, huge, long record of integrity before the pandemic.

01:45:55.256 --> 01:46:17.534
So even if they sold a book that says it's, you know, gain of function or says that it's a bioweapon or gets a lot of things wrong, I'm still trying to give them, I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt because, but there's no doubt that Robert Malone suing the Breggans steered a lot of attention to them.

01:46:19.015 --> 01:46:21.918
And Robert Malone is definitely never going to sue me

01:46:23.804 --> 01:46:30.066
None of these people will, Children's Health Defense, any of these people that I'm calling out as part of this, they can't sue me.

01:46:30.086 --> 01:46:33.607
They won't sue me because number one, they don't want any more attention than I'm already got.

01:46:34.027 --> 01:46:36.148
And number two, you can't sue somebody for telling the truth.

01:46:40.309 --> 01:46:47.912
There's no other way to explain these people why they are coordinated in their presentation of these very curated ideas, this limited spectrum of debate.

01:46:50.185 --> 01:46:53.367
the political forces that seem to control it all.

01:46:53.387 --> 01:46:55.809
We don't really have a free market making these decisions.

01:46:55.889 --> 01:47:05.655
We have a market that is highly controlled and highly regulated through D.C., which turns everyone away from funding entrepreneurs to funding lobbying groups to push their drugs.

01:47:06.115 --> 01:47:07.477
So you don't have to have the best drug.

01:47:07.497 --> 01:47:10.080
You have to have the best connections in Congress and in D.C.

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:10.961
to move things along.

01:47:11.462 --> 01:47:20.313
And that significantly, I think, discredits or makes it a big disadvantage to anything that's generic that doesn't have a single owner with deep pockets.

01:47:22.075 --> 01:47:25.717
So these generic drugs, I think, got overlooked for this very reason.

01:47:25.757 --> 01:47:29.498
And you would think that that's what the NIH is there for, right?

01:47:29.538 --> 01:47:37.621
The NIH should be looking for areas of market failure and promoting them, knowing the market's probably not going to dig their feet into generic drugs.

01:47:37.661 --> 01:47:39.082
But we didn't see that with the NIH.

01:47:39.162 --> 01:47:45.505
We saw the NIH promoting remdesivir and many of these vaccine approaches, and they have some patent estate connections to those.

01:47:47.046 --> 01:47:51.571
NIH isn't doing this market correction thing that we're we're hoping it would do.

01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:53.934
It seems to be an amplifier of the lobby.

01:47:53.954 --> 01:47:55.556
So let me just make very clear.

01:47:55.636 --> 01:48:01.863
I don't want to make I want to make sure that everybody sees this at this stage in his discussion, right?

01:48:02.384 --> 01:48:04.446
At this stage in his discussion.

01:48:04.866 --> 01:48:05.187
Dang it.

01:48:08.962 --> 01:48:16.446
At this stage in his discussion, he has not said that anything about intramuscular injection of the previous vaccines being a problem.

01:48:17.427 --> 01:48:24.210
He's never said anything about transfection versus transformation and bothered to try and differentiate between the two.

01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.933
Even though right now in December of 2020, there are two types of products on the market.

01:48:29.553 --> 01:48:34.976
He flatters the Pfizer as a manufacturing miracle.

01:48:36.505 --> 01:48:39.226
and reinforces the idea that an RNA can pandemic.

01:48:39.266 --> 01:48:46.707
So all of these things that I would like somebody to challenge remain unchallenged.

01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:54.949
No one really wants to talk about what evidence that they have that works against these statements.

01:48:58.049 --> 01:49:05.451
And so we're still here, still just narrative control, narrative curation process.

01:49:06.937 --> 01:49:10.119
When we talk about hydrochloroquine, is that the malaria drug?

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.362
Yeah, hydroxychloroquine is the malaria drug that you use with zinc, ideally.

01:49:14.602 --> 01:49:19.425
And they were sometimes, I think, providing, giving it with an antibiotic as well.

01:49:20.306 --> 01:49:24.889
And then ivermectin is a similar deworming agent that's been generic for quite some time.

01:49:25.049 --> 01:49:27.530
A similar deworming agent.

01:49:28.331 --> 01:49:28.991
See what I mean?

01:49:29.872 --> 01:49:31.213
What in the shit is that?

01:49:32.947 --> 01:49:37.212
As far as I can tell, it's closer to an insecticide than hydroxychloroquine is.

01:49:39.595 --> 01:49:41.318
Similar agent.

01:49:42.679 --> 01:49:43.360
How do they work?

01:49:44.442 --> 01:49:49.007
I heard for a while that people were saying ivermectin blocked the 3Cl protease.

01:49:50.069 --> 01:49:51.771
I even remember that

01:49:52.864 --> 01:50:12.219
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think John Campbell of YouTube fame with 3 million subscribers, who didn't save a single person from taking the shot, actually did a show with little cutouts, little tiny cutouts of how a enzyme works and then how something can interfere with it.

01:50:13.459 --> 01:50:15.341
And he did a little journal club about a paper.

01:50:17.062 --> 01:50:17.903
I shit you not.

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.343
So there's no mechanism here, they're just similar.

01:50:32.887 --> 01:51:01.784
when uh... you know this is a big disadvantage to anything that's generic that doesn't so disturbed by the the political forces that seem to control it all like we don't really have a free market making these decisions we have a market that is highly controlled and highly regulated through dc which turns everyone away from funding entrepreneurs to funding lobbying groups to to push their drugs so you don't have to have the best drug you have to have the best connections in congress and in dc to move things along and that significantly

01:51:02.964 --> 01:51:09.547
I think discredits or makes a big disadvantage to anything that's generic that doesn't have a single owner with deep pockets.

01:51:11.307 --> 01:51:14.929
So these generic drugs, I think, got overlooked for this very reason.

01:51:14.989 --> 01:51:17.770
And you would think that that's what the NIH is there for.

01:51:18.650 --> 01:51:26.817
The NIH should be looking for areas of market failure and promoting them, knowing the market's probably not going to dig their feet into generic drugs.

01:51:26.877 --> 01:51:28.278
But we didn't see that with the NIH.

01:51:28.379 --> 01:51:34.784
We saw the NIH promoting remdesivir and many of these vaccine approaches, and they have some patent estate connections to those.

01:51:34.864 --> 01:51:40.809
So the NIH isn't doing this market correction thing that we were hoping it would do.

01:51:40.849 --> 01:51:43.652
It seems to be an amplifier of the lobbying process.

01:51:45.217 --> 01:51:48.399
When we talk about hydrochloroquine, is that the malaria drug?

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.642
Yeah, hydroxychloroquine is the malaria drug that you use with zinc, ideally.

01:51:52.882 --> 01:51:57.705
And they were sometimes, I think, providing, giving it with an antibiotic as well.

01:51:58.566 --> 01:52:03.149
And then ivermectin is a similar deworming agent that's been generic for quite some time.

01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.849
I think they use it.

01:52:04.029 --> 01:52:09.953
So he admits that they were giving it sometimes with an antibiotic, which would then again, you know, it doesn't work for a virus, right?

01:52:09.993 --> 01:52:11.674
So why would they give an antibiotic, Kevin?

01:52:13.042 --> 01:52:14.223
in horses and veterinarians.

01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:17.685
You can still get it on, actually, I think on Amazon, as like a paste for horses.

01:52:17.745 --> 01:52:23.788
But you can't get it from a physician who will give you the proper amount and the right dose regimen for it.

01:52:23.848 --> 01:52:27.230
But I think this just changed a few weeks ago.

01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:31.193
So at least I know hydroxychloroquine got reversed when the vaccines went live.

01:52:31.233 --> 01:52:35.015
I don't know where ivermectin stands, but there is better data on ivermectin.

01:52:35.515 --> 01:52:40.658
And many physicians pounding their hands on the table in DC trying to get this thing opened up.

01:52:41.098 --> 01:52:45.299
So we mean, like Pierre Corey was probably pounding his hands in D.C.

01:52:45.339 --> 01:52:50.761
when he was invited to be at the first Senate hearing that he then went and told what happened in New York.

01:52:50.821 --> 01:52:53.742
I think Jessica is on that like flies.

01:52:54.942 --> 01:52:55.302
Yeah.

01:52:55.362 --> 01:52:56.522
So that's interesting.

01:52:56.542 --> 01:52:58.683
I got to go back a little bit because he said something else.

01:52:58.903 --> 01:53:02.105
I think they use it in horses and veterinarians.

01:53:02.125 --> 01:53:04.066
You can still get it on, actually, I think on Amazon.

01:53:04.106 --> 01:53:06.888
So you can still get it on Amazon, he's actually telling you.

01:53:06.928 --> 01:53:10.450
You can get it as little tubes of a yellow paste for horses on Amazon.

01:53:10.471 --> 01:53:11.591
I mean, wow.

01:53:12.412 --> 01:53:13.212
Wow.

01:53:14.433 --> 01:53:15.154
Wow.

01:53:15.534 --> 01:53:15.974
Really?

01:53:15.994 --> 01:53:16.054
Wow.

01:53:17.675 --> 01:53:18.676
Did he just say that?

01:53:21.049 --> 01:53:21.770
Where did I put that?

01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:25.315
I had one of those tubes here once because I wanted to have it on stream.

01:53:25.355 --> 01:53:26.396
Now I don't know where it went.

01:53:26.496 --> 01:53:26.777
Darn it.

01:53:27.458 --> 01:53:34.767
It's like a pace for horses, but you can't get it from a physician who will give you the proper amount and the right dose regimen for it.

01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:38.230
I think this just changed a few weeks ago.

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:42.150
So at least I know hydroxychloroquine got reversed when the vaccines went live.

01:53:42.210 --> 01:53:51.633
I don't know where ivermectin stands, but there is better data on ivermectin and many physicians pounding their hands on the table in DC trying to get this thing opened up.

01:53:52.073 --> 01:53:58.734
So we wouldn't have a clogged ICU problem or a clogged hospital problem if we could do outpatient treatment.

01:53:58.814 --> 01:54:04.596
So many- So he's still reinforcing the idea that we have a clogged hospital problem, which I'm not really-

01:54:05.396 --> 01:54:06.817
I'm not really sure that's true.

01:54:06.977 --> 01:54:07.738
It was ever true.

01:54:07.878 --> 01:54:19.366
And certainly, I think at this time, it was very important in December of 2020 to sustain the idea that that was true, when it really, it definitely wasn't.

01:54:20.484 --> 01:54:26.227
of this, you know, the hospitals are overwhelmed justification for lockdowns is self-imposed.

01:54:26.587 --> 01:54:30.909
It's the government not letting go of what are already approved drugs.

01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:36.611
Doctors usually had the freedom to prescribe these things off label and that was ripped away from them during the pandemic.

01:54:37.492 --> 01:54:40.993
And that to me looks like they were just parting the Red Sea for their friends to pull other drugs.

01:54:41.013 --> 01:54:42.354
But who ripped it away from them?

01:54:42.394 --> 01:54:47.516
Because I understand from people like Mary Talley Bowden that it was just pharmacies who were refusing to fill.

01:54:49.005 --> 01:54:53.988
So that's not really the NIH, that's HHS, or it's even state health departments doing it.

01:54:54.068 --> 01:54:55.129
You see the problem here?

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:58.171
We're not telling this correctly.

01:54:58.231 --> 01:55:04.775
He's implying that it's coming from above, that Donald Trump is doing it, or his administration is doing it.

01:55:04.795 --> 01:55:06.115
And it's exactly the opposite.

01:55:06.155 --> 01:55:07.196
The states had to do it.

01:55:07.596 --> 01:55:10.558
That's why the responses across state borders were so different.

01:55:10.938 --> 01:55:18.363
And that's probably why county to county, there was no spread in any of Denny Rancor's data that he kind of mentioned, but called him Daniel.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:20.100
drugs through.

01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:28.623
Wait, you mean they changed that doctors were no longer allowed to go off books in order to be able to, and that's not normally the way that works.

01:55:28.983 --> 01:55:29.283
No.

01:55:29.303 --> 01:55:34.785
2019 you could prescribe these things for outside of rheumatoid arthritis or for other, other uses.

01:55:34.865 --> 01:55:36.585
And during the pandemic they reversed it.

01:55:37.365 --> 01:55:38.346
How did they reverse it?

01:55:39.546 --> 01:55:41.427
You see how crucial this is.

01:55:41.487 --> 01:55:43.347
It's very important that you see this.

01:55:44.588 --> 01:55:45.608
How did they reverse it?

01:55:48.137 --> 01:55:51.479
Because this is not an accurate description of what happened.

01:55:52.940 --> 01:56:00.224
Hydroxychloroquine was given in EUA, but only for hospital use, and ivermectin, something, something, I don't know what, but this is not what happened.

01:56:00.244 --> 01:56:04.026
The FDA didn't stop doctors from prescribing off-label.

01:56:07.167 --> 01:56:08.268
Be wary of this.

01:56:09.048 --> 01:56:09.368
This is 2020.

01:56:11.875 --> 01:56:18.918
See it for the malevolence that it is, getting you to ask the wrong questions based on the wrong assumptions about the wrong questions.

01:56:19.779 --> 01:56:20.019
Evil.

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.503
Well, I mean like- You could prescribe these things for outside of rheumatoid arthritis or for other uses and during the pandemic they reversed it.

01:56:28.843 --> 01:56:29.083
Evil.

01:56:29.864 --> 01:56:30.064
Evil.

01:56:31.317 --> 01:56:51.217
well i mean like it if you if that really is true you will be in the definition of the creation of suffering worse where it's not needed then yeah you're right like uh... and those are my words you cannot look up by doctor peter mccullough from baylor easily leading cardiologist was down there uh... explaining this shenanigans to uh... senator i think it was uh... ron johnson i believe

01:56:52.478 --> 01:56:57.722
But, you know, he went over the surgesphere debacle, you know, the whole New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet retraction.

01:56:57.882 --> 01:57:01.445
They published these bullshit papers on this drug being harmful.

01:57:02.126 --> 01:57:11.233
And then they used Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey and him to promote it and to say that these are the questions we should be arguing about.

01:57:11.293 --> 01:57:12.534
Look at this fake data.

01:57:12.634 --> 01:57:16.497
Oh, my gosh.

01:57:16.577 --> 01:57:18.199
I think they made up a whole data set.

01:57:20.393 --> 01:57:21.654
I think they're covering it up.

01:57:22.174 --> 01:57:23.634
I think this might be a lab leak.

01:57:23.994 --> 01:57:33.778
James Todaro on Twitter, another physician who's well-versed in the Bitcoin space, just looked through the... He just promoted a physician that's well-versed in the Bitcoin space.

01:57:34.059 --> 01:57:34.719
Stop lying!

01:57:35.475 --> 01:57:36.275
Come on.

01:57:36.295 --> 01:57:41.296
And realized it was a scam, put out a paper describing it as a scam.

01:57:41.336 --> 01:57:45.737
It wasn't a peer-reviewed paper, but he put it on, I think he put it on a Google Drive, and the drive got censored.

01:57:46.658 --> 01:57:47.618
But eventually, he was right.

01:57:48.178 --> 01:57:51.859
And it showed that this Surgisphere company was describing it as a scam.

01:57:52.019 --> 01:57:53.179
He went over there.

01:57:53.199 --> 01:58:00.461
His leading cardiologist was down there explaining this shenanigans to Senator, I think it was Ron Johnson, I believe.

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.383
But you know, he went over those.

01:58:03.463 --> 01:58:07.106
He is pretending not to know that the name is Ron Johnson.

01:58:07.466 --> 01:58:13.872
He's pretending not to know that Peter McCullough, I think his name is Daniel Rankert.

01:58:16.135 --> 01:58:19.258
It's all a elaborate charade.

01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:20.860
There's just fear of debacle.

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:27.003
You know, the whole New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet Retraction, they published these bullshit papers on this drug being harmful.

01:58:27.663 --> 01:58:38.468
And James Todaro on Twitter, another physician who's well-versed in the Bitcoin space, just looked through the data and realized it was a scam, put out a paper describing it as a scam.

01:58:38.508 --> 01:58:42.890
It wasn't a peer-reviewed paper, but he put it on, I think he put it like on a Google Drive, and the drive got censored.

01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:44.811
But eventually, he was right.

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:48.472
And it showed that this Surgisphere company was a spring-up company.

01:58:48.513 --> 01:58:54.475
We still don't know exactly who funded them, but there are some connections to one of the authors, to Gilead, who makes from Desivir.

01:58:55.796 --> 01:58:57.277
And we saw Gilead.

01:58:58.882 --> 01:59:00.783
Billy, I'd also fund the Bulwar study.

01:59:00.943 --> 01:59:02.504
Well, I didn't fund the Bulwar study.

01:59:02.524 --> 01:59:07.407
I think they showed that the Bulwar study in Minnesota was one that wasn't very favorable on hydroxychloroquine either.

01:59:07.447 --> 01:59:08.827
But there's a problem with that.

01:59:08.927 --> 01:59:12.729
I mean, you might as well be going, you know, we saw in file F-160.

01:59:13.530 --> 01:59:20.754
Hydroxychloroquine can't save you from the effects of ARDS induced from supplemental oxygen, I bet you.

01:59:21.641 --> 01:59:31.312
I bet you hydroxychloroquine cannot save you from the ARDS that develops from extended exposure to high flow oxygen.

01:59:31.452 --> 01:59:32.473
I bet you it can't.

01:59:32.513 --> 01:59:35.076
And I bet you ivermectin doesn't do a lot for that either.

01:59:37.614 --> 02:00:04.811
or three seven one six that this was true or this was not true answer about that i just thought those references a little bit better but i don't even mean to spell out the references i'm saying like an ordinary person like me sits here and says i have no way of going through and discerning whether what kevin is saying is true or what the government saying is true however i can say that my experience with corona virus has led me to believe that the people that are in charge

02:00:05.271 --> 02:00:23.151
are not making what i would think of as like a continual regular service of good ideas and good decisions and the biggest eye-opener to me so far even bigger than the experience of going out and having masks all over everybody which to me is still bizarre but uh

02:00:23.812 --> 02:00:26.493
but is when I went to get a PCR test.

02:00:26.693 --> 02:00:32.316
So we had somebody caring for our daughter that tested positive for coronavirus, not very sick at all.

02:00:32.716 --> 02:00:34.977
She always wears a mask when she's caring for our daughter.

02:00:35.378 --> 02:00:43.141
And so boom, now we are on quarantine because not that we were in contact with her, but that our daughter was and we'd be holding our daughter.

02:00:43.842 --> 02:00:52.546
And he probably watched the video earlier in the pandemic where Steven Hatfield explained that if your kid is sick, then you should use an apron.

02:00:53.406 --> 02:01:00.129
And you should be doing all kinds of things to make sure that you don't have contact.

02:01:00.169 --> 02:01:01.450
You know, take off your shoes.

02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:04.091
You should be wearing gloves and a mask.

02:01:04.131 --> 02:01:09.213
When you tend to your kid in the bedroom, you're supposed to wear an apron.

02:01:14.028 --> 02:01:14.248
Yes.

02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:16.410
That's Steven Hadfield said that.

02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:25.256
So he's on quarantine now because you know, Brett Weinstein says that when you get tested and you have, you gotta, you gotta quarantine, the whole family's got to go on quarantine now.

02:01:25.596 --> 02:01:28.598
So now you've got to like, all right, well, what's the thing that we can do here?

02:01:28.678 --> 02:01:30.379
So we like, let's go get tested.

02:01:30.939 --> 02:01:33.581
So we wait four days and then we go get tested.

02:01:34.081 --> 02:01:39.605
And when I show up at this clinic, which is like the only one that I can get in to get the, the day of thing.

02:01:40.286 --> 02:01:43.408
Um, the, it is like T going to the TSA.

02:01:44.048 --> 02:01:46.169
They have us wait in the car for like two hours.

02:01:46.469 --> 02:01:47.129
We come in.

02:01:47.509 --> 02:01:50.670
It's a bunch of people standing around and I know they're nurses.

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:54.791
The woman that comes to do my readings isn't even wearing gloves.

02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:58.793
She just comes in and like puts it like a cuff around me.

02:01:58.893 --> 02:02:01.193
And there's no way she's actually looking at the dial.

02:02:01.233 --> 02:02:03.514
I mean, she's just like, you know, kind of.

02:02:03.934 --> 02:02:06.095
And then they come in to actually do the test.

02:02:06.835 --> 02:02:13.579
And they tell me nothing about what's going on because they must be doing an ungodly amount of these and jam it all the way up my nose.

02:02:13.739 --> 02:02:17.120
And I was just like, yeah, so shocked at the way this goes.

02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:21.763
So we've got to all share in this common experience of being nasally raped.

02:02:22.543 --> 02:02:23.564
We've all got to share.

02:02:23.604 --> 02:02:25.685
We've all got to testify that it happened.

02:02:27.512 --> 02:02:30.534
it's dirty in there, like stuff wasn't picked up.

02:02:30.874 --> 02:02:34.376
And you think, where would all these PCR positives come from?

02:02:34.416 --> 02:02:43.862
It must be because they're not doing the test with the kind of accuracy and high fidelity standards that they should be.

02:02:43.942 --> 02:02:46.023
And that might be causing added problems.

02:02:46.773 --> 02:02:48.535
I can go get healthcare anywhere I want.

02:02:49.016 --> 02:02:53.822
So what if this is where I could get to, then where is the rest of the country?

02:02:53.842 --> 02:03:02.552
Wow, I mean, imagine all those poor people what what they are getting tested at CVS or something going to get healthcare and it's got to be worse than this.

02:03:02.752 --> 02:03:04.615
And that is a scary, scary thought.

02:03:05.035 --> 02:03:10.260
Was anyone there, um, you know, maybe you, you, you weren't, uh, you weren't asking these hard questions.

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:16.467
I do it because I'm in the PCR space, but when I've been to a few of these things and I, and I ask like, well, what's the false positive rate of the test?

02:03:16.547 --> 02:03:17.608
Oh, I asked man.

02:03:17.648 --> 02:03:21.131
Cause I had just been, that's why when you were tweeting about this, I was like, wait, what?

02:03:21.552 --> 02:03:24.415
But how would you know the false positive of the test?

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.982
See, that's also a incorrect argument.

02:03:29.022 --> 02:03:41.667
He's saying what words sound correct, but unless he's gonna explain that without extensive testing of any one of these products before the pandemic, we would never actually know what the background signal was.

02:03:41.707 --> 02:03:46.849
And therefore you actually couldn't calculate the prevalence.

02:03:46.909 --> 02:03:52.752
And you need to know the prevalence of the signal that you're looking for before you can estimate the false positivity.

02:03:55.051 --> 02:03:57.652
So he's never going to actually break that down.

02:03:58.872 --> 02:04:05.453
And the only people that have ever tried to break that down on the internet have broken it down in an incorrect, very obtuse, convoluted way.

02:04:06.173 --> 02:04:14.955
Instead of very simply saying that without any data about previous prevalence of any of these amplicons before the pandemic, hell if we know what this means.

02:04:17.036 --> 02:04:22.597
That's the very simple flashcard for the PCR exam, for the PCR diagnostics.

02:04:23.447 --> 02:04:27.730
And they want you to believe that PCR is very high fidelity, that we can trust all these people.

02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:34.074
And so the only thing they're not telling us is, is what's the, what's the prevalence, what's the false positive rate.

02:04:34.114 --> 02:04:42.059
But he's not going to tell you how you would calculate the false positive rate and how it would be impossible given the fact that they have no data from before the pandemic.

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:43.440
Stop lying.

02:04:46.362 --> 02:04:52.226
Tell me about the test because, and I went in there and I actually asked them and then we'll get into your answers on this.

02:04:52.246 --> 02:04:52.767
So I said,

02:04:53.627 --> 02:04:57.289
What did the number of tests that come back positive that shouldn't be?

02:04:57.309 --> 02:04:58.150
And the woman was like, I don't know.

02:04:58.170 --> 02:04:58.810
It's not very many.

02:04:58.850 --> 02:05:00.391
It's really, it's really, really good test.

02:05:00.611 --> 02:05:03.893
And then I was like, what's the process for you doing this?

02:05:03.933 --> 02:05:05.153
Like, how does this test get done?

02:05:05.674 --> 02:05:07.975
Um, they come and pick up the vials every couple hours.

02:05:08.115 --> 02:05:11.077
And then, uh, we'll, we'll let you know sometime in the future.

02:05:11.117 --> 02:05:13.538
And I, and like, she just had no concept.

02:05:13.658 --> 02:05:18.901
And like the fact that it was so dirty is there that it led me to believe it'd be hard to get reasonable tests.

02:05:19.758 --> 02:05:21.498
Yeah, same experience here.

02:05:21.699 --> 02:05:24.239
And in our case, the rapid test was $140.

02:05:24.279 --> 02:05:27.880
And I think the PCR test was like $320 or something.

02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:31.501
So the price of these tests is ridiculous at the moment.

02:05:32.802 --> 02:05:34.862
So somebody was making a lot of money, huh?

02:05:35.942 --> 02:05:36.323
Wow.

02:05:36.643 --> 02:05:38.643
Because it's all taxpayer funded, you know?

02:05:38.803 --> 02:05:39.784
Spare no expense.

02:05:40.204 --> 02:05:42.784
We've got to assume the worst case scenario is going to happen.

02:05:42.824 --> 02:05:44.285
Maybe a billion people will die.

02:05:44.305 --> 02:05:44.585
I don't know.

02:05:44.625 --> 02:05:48.086
There's some raccoon in Japan that says that.

02:05:49.071 --> 02:05:54.301
And there's this guy, some MD called Paul Cottrell, who also says that.

02:05:56.588 --> 02:05:59.090
A PCR test should be like maybe $10 to $50, right?

02:05:59.170 --> 02:06:05.416
But they're all elevated because they've created this artificial demand, this regulatory demand that doesn't necessarily need to be there.

02:06:06.296 --> 02:06:07.317
So that's one issue.

02:06:07.898 --> 02:06:09.980
And no one there knew the false negative rate, the false positive.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.941
They didn't even know the name of the test they were running.

02:06:12.001 --> 02:06:15.965
And I even tried to ask a very simple question, like, what's the percent positivity?

02:06:16.165 --> 02:06:17.946
How many of these things are lighting up per day?

02:06:17.966 --> 02:06:18.066
Is it 1%?

02:06:18.107 --> 02:06:18.207
Is it 10%?

02:06:18.287 --> 02:06:18.447
No clue.

02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:24.811
You know, so I left very disheartened with it.

02:06:24.831 --> 02:06:26.911
That's really what kind of made me dig more into this.

02:06:26.931 --> 02:06:36.133
Cause I was like, this, this is what PCR is turned into is it's like, I have better, I get better medical information out of people at a dispensary than I get from people that are shoving stuff up my nose.

02:06:37.173 --> 02:06:44.374
So explain to people what the PCR test is supposed to be doing and kind of what's going on with the test people are using.

02:06:44.434 --> 02:06:46.415
So it's supposed to be measuring, uh,

02:06:47.555 --> 02:06:50.018
Well, it depends on who you ask what it's supposed to do.

02:06:50.038 --> 02:06:51.139
I can tell you what it does.

02:06:51.239 --> 02:06:55.904
And it measures if you have any RNA molecules that are related to the virus in your system.

02:06:56.264 --> 02:06:57.505
And it's pretty good at that, actually.

02:06:57.785 --> 02:07:03.431
It measures if you have any RNA molecules associated with the virus in your system.

02:07:05.173 --> 02:07:06.154
Holy shit.

02:07:09.537 --> 02:07:11.039
Is that really where he's going to start?

02:07:11.099 --> 02:07:13.441
Because this is going to get ugly really fast.

02:07:14.102 --> 02:07:21.030
Explain to people what the PCR test is supposed to be doing and kind of what's going on with the test people are using right now.

02:07:21.070 --> 02:07:23.112
So it's supposed to be measuring, well,

02:07:24.634 --> 02:07:26.655
It depends on who you ask what it's supposed to do.

02:07:26.675 --> 02:07:27.775
I can tell you what it does.

02:07:27.875 --> 02:07:32.577
And it measures if you have any RNA molecules that are related to the virus in your system.

02:07:32.897 --> 02:07:34.078
And it's pretty good at that, actually.

02:07:34.098 --> 02:07:35.378
It can pick up very small numbers.

02:07:35.438 --> 02:07:40.380
But that thing that they jam up your nose is not very good at sampling.

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:47.562
There have been studies showing anywhere between 1,000 to 10,000-fold variance in the amount of human DNA that comes on that swab.

02:07:48.242 --> 02:07:54.964
Regardless of whether they pick up the virus, some of these tests will look for a human gene just to prove the test worked, which is a good idea.

02:07:55.744 --> 02:07:58.885
If you can't see the human gene, you missed the nose, right?

02:08:00.145 --> 02:08:03.066
But even those signals vary quite a bit.

02:08:03.306 --> 02:08:05.927
And so that tells you that the sampling is really roughshod.

02:08:06.127 --> 02:08:21.472
So I can tell you from consulting work that I've done that there are very few tests that existed in Canada or in the United States in 2020 or 2021 that had a positive control that was amplifying a known transcript from human DNA, I swear.

02:08:23.973 --> 02:08:29.715
And the ones that did, did not show adequate amplification of the human signal.

02:08:30.515 --> 02:08:31.576
I've seen the raw data.

02:08:31.636 --> 02:08:34.757
I've spent hours on it because I'm consulting for a couple lawyers.

02:08:36.843 --> 02:08:39.406
specifically on the fraud that is the PCR test.

02:08:40.868 --> 02:08:48.138
And so I am extremely curious to hear him describe it as measuring if you have RNA molecules related to the virus.

02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:49.340
Stop lying!

02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:51.663
It measures an amplicon.

02:08:54.090 --> 02:09:07.804
The tests that I've looked at have measured an amplicon that is supposed to be a 300 base pair fragment associated with the N protein encoding RNA segment of the RNA genome.

02:09:09.286 --> 02:09:15.252
So that's definitely not measuring if you have RNA molecules related to the virus, it's measuring specifically if you have one.

02:09:18.419 --> 02:09:35.105
which we know in terms of their own description of how these RNA molecules behave when they hijack a cell, there are hundreds of thousands of copies of that RNA and comparatively fewer of the more relevant enzymes that are associated with what?

02:09:35.705 --> 02:09:37.186
Replication competence.

02:09:38.843 --> 02:09:49.956
Something that he dropped in the background a few minutes ago with regard to the RNA and the amazing work that Pfizer has done in making non-replication competent RNA in high quantities.

02:09:52.138 --> 02:09:52.899
Stop lying!

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.162
I mean, I can go on all day.

02:09:58.391 --> 02:09:59.673
and probably not very accurate.

02:10:00.874 --> 02:10:03.857
And then it's looking for virus RNA, though.

02:10:03.897 --> 02:10:05.399
It's not looking for active virus.

02:10:05.559 --> 02:10:13.167
And that's a big problem, because the time frame for which you're qPCR positive can be outwards to 50 days.

02:10:13.187 --> 02:10:15.669
There's some papers that show it out to 77 days.

02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:19.473
But the time window where you're infectious is around seven days.

02:10:20.325 --> 02:10:26.987
So, you know, you can have a scenario where it's a 10 to one ratio of people who are not infectious that are getting quarantined versus those that are infectious.

02:10:27.047 --> 02:10:27.847
So it's horrible.

02:10:28.347 --> 02:10:30.388
So the question is, when is infectious?

02:10:30.428 --> 02:10:31.929
How do we define infectious?

02:10:31.949 --> 02:10:34.589
We could argue about that for a couple of years, at least, I'm sure.

02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:36.250
Concerning whether you're infectious or not.

02:10:37.230 --> 02:10:42.492
And then this cascading effects of telling people that they have a positive test when they don't have a positive test.

02:10:43.392 --> 02:10:44.372
It's a cascade.

02:10:44.432 --> 02:10:46.153
And once you get involved in it, it's like,

02:10:47.153 --> 02:10:53.436
So that's why we limit how many people we see now, just because if we get an incorrect one, you're done.

02:10:53.596 --> 02:10:57.118
Oh, so that sounds a lot like what Brett Weinstein argues for.

02:10:57.138 --> 02:10:59.119
I mean, if you test positive, then you're screwed.

02:10:59.139 --> 02:11:06.423
So you better limit your connection with people because how you get infected is coming in contact with other people.

02:11:08.496 --> 02:11:22.671
influencing the exact contagion narrative that the biosecurity state needs us to believe, needs to become common knowledge, and has hired or recruited Kevin McKernan to do it.

02:11:23.712 --> 02:11:25.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's very true.

02:11:25.234 --> 02:11:29.878
And you know, everyone writes it off as no big deal, you're getting quarantined, you're not dying, you know, suck it up.

02:11:30.098 --> 02:11:36.083
But that has an impact on how many nurses are in the hospitals, because their kids go positive, and then they got to stay home.

02:11:36.624 --> 02:11:37.945
And it has an impact.

02:11:37.985 --> 02:11:39.406
My wife is a physical therapist.

02:11:39.427 --> 02:11:43.951
She can't treat people if she's positive, or even is in the cascade of somebody being positive.

02:11:43.971 --> 02:11:44.912
Yes, exactly.

02:11:45.392 --> 02:11:48.515
The cascade of someone being positive.

02:11:52.315 --> 02:11:53.316
That one didn't catch on.

02:11:54.356 --> 02:11:57.439
And so I don't think... Chain of infection is what he should have said.

02:11:57.499 --> 02:11:59.800
He wasn't up to date on that vocabulary.

02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:03.743
People appreciate the six degrees to Kevin Bacon that everyone's in.

02:12:04.403 --> 02:12:06.525
You are probably three degrees from someone who's positive.

02:12:07.545 --> 02:12:18.553
And so that means all of society's stalled because the test... He just used the Kevin Bacon game to tell everybody that you're only three degrees of separation from somebody who's infected.

02:12:18.693 --> 02:12:19.774
Holy shit.

02:12:21.345 --> 02:12:22.246
is overly sensitive.

02:12:23.326 --> 02:12:27.869
Now, some of that, we've written actually a retraction request for some of these methods.

02:12:28.689 --> 02:12:33.132
One in particular, which is the first one that the WHO put on their website, and I can point people to that retraction review.

02:12:33.772 --> 02:12:39.335
That doesn't mean we're saying all PCR is bad, but one- Oh no, we are very clear about that, Kevin.

02:12:39.375 --> 02:12:42.437
We are very clear that you're not saying all PCR is bad.

02:12:42.877 --> 02:12:46.960
Holy shit, I've been making that statement for three years straight.

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:50.322
You traitor, you liar.

02:12:51.536 --> 02:12:53.057
You misleader of the young.

02:12:53.497 --> 02:12:59.620
In particular, that got launched really early is very bad and does create a lot of false negatives and false positives.

02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:02.921
And it's really- False negatives?

02:13:03.121 --> 02:13:04.222
Holy shit.

02:13:04.262 --> 02:13:07.743
Set the seed for running this test with your blinders on.

02:13:08.444 --> 02:13:11.925
The challenge with this test is people are turning it into a yes, no answer.

02:13:11.965 --> 02:13:13.506
And that's really not helpful.

02:13:14.266 --> 02:13:18.048
You really want to know your viral load and you want to know the value that comes out of the test.

02:13:18.468 --> 02:13:25.194
You want to use more of our products to evaluate whether or not you're sick and exactly what place in the progression you're in.

02:13:25.755 --> 02:13:27.496
I can provide those products for you.

02:13:27.616 --> 02:13:30.839
Otherwise, because you want to know, do I have a little bit of virus?

02:13:30.859 --> 02:13:34.742
Because if I don't have symptoms and a little bit of virus, I'm probably not infectious.

02:13:35.203 --> 02:13:36.224
And I'm not going to worry about this.

02:13:36.324 --> 02:13:38.265
Maybe I'll get tested again in two days.

02:13:38.325 --> 02:13:41.288
And if the viral load goes down, I know I'm on the back end of the disease.

02:13:41.308 --> 02:13:49.894
He is saying exactly what Steve Kirsch says, that, well, my wife tested positive, and then a few days later, I tested positive.

02:13:50.234 --> 02:13:53.796
How else should I understand that if it's not spreading in my house?

02:13:54.877 --> 02:13:55.197
Holy...

02:13:57.039 --> 02:13:58.781
disease, not the front end of the disease, right?

02:13:58.821 --> 02:14:05.388
There's a lot that you could do to minimize the impact on society if you know what that CT level is.

02:14:05.408 --> 02:14:08.171
There's a CQ or CT score on these things.

02:14:08.191 --> 02:14:09.612
Those two terms are interchangeable.

02:14:09.632 --> 02:14:16.700
Yeah, you've got to learn about R, not R0, but RE, and you've got to learn about CT counts in the PCR field.

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.603
And that just measures, it's a log scale, it measures how much virus you have.

02:14:20.663 --> 02:14:31.173
So, if you don't utilize that log scale, it's literally like you crying, you know, yelling fire inside of a movie theater every time you feel the Richter scale move, you know.

02:14:31.814 --> 02:14:35.197
And it's a log scale, and we're hiding that information.

02:14:35.817 --> 02:14:47.021
But if you were to do that, if you were to, you know, yell panic every time the Richter scale moves without telling people it's like, you know, a scale, you know, an earthquake that's a two versus a seven, you're going to have massive chaos in society.

02:14:47.701 --> 02:14:51.422
And that's what they're doing with... He couldn't smell his cats for weeks.

02:14:53.123 --> 02:15:01.966
This test, they're not telling you what it is, and they're taking this overly cautious approach of quarantining people that are asymptomatic and aren't infectious.

02:15:03.079 --> 02:15:09.785
That's exactly the James Giordano line of, you know, prodrome, predrome syndrome.

02:15:10.646 --> 02:15:12.708
And I think it violates a lot of medical ethics.

02:15:12.728 --> 02:15:13.829
We couldn't get away with this in 2019.

02:15:13.869 --> 02:15:19.394
You're just not supposed to be doing medical tests on asymptomatic people without informed consent.

02:15:19.815 --> 02:15:21.376
And it's pretty clear nobody's informed.

02:15:21.596 --> 02:15:27.577
No, but not even the physicians or the nurses that are administering these tests know what the CT value is.

02:15:27.597 --> 02:15:30.478
They don't even know the name of the test or the false positive or false negative rates.

02:15:30.598 --> 02:15:36.199
So the informed nature of the test isn't there, and the consent isn't there.

02:15:36.219 --> 02:15:38.020
No one's taking these things consensually.

02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.400
I mean, I shouldn't say no one, but a few people are taking them consensually.

02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:42.120
They're forced to take them to get back to school.

02:15:42.481 --> 02:15:44.381
They're forced to take them to get back into the workforce.

02:15:44.421 --> 02:15:45.501
They're forced to- There's school stuff.

02:15:45.581 --> 02:15:49.342
I mean, there are people going in weekly to get tests for coronavirus.

02:15:49.462 --> 02:15:55.545
Yeah, like the entire student body of the University of Illinois, the entire student body of the University of Ohio.

02:15:56.905 --> 02:15:58.886
And those remnants were already sold.

02:15:59.947 --> 02:16:03.848
They had a buyer for the leftover swabs.

02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:07.630
You know, like somebody that might want to amplify the human DNA in it.

02:16:10.913 --> 02:16:12.754
They're telling you the truth here in 2020.

02:16:12.814 --> 02:16:14.795
They're just not telling you the whole truth.

02:16:14.875 --> 02:16:17.536
They're seeding a narrative that they can then control.

02:16:17.976 --> 02:16:28.461
And that's why Kevin McKernan has been all over the place for the last four years, from the beginning till now, in front of the Senate, because he is part of that narrative curation team.

02:16:29.041 --> 02:16:33.323
Just like Robert Malone and his wife, just like Jessica Rose, aka Epigirl.

02:16:34.656 --> 02:16:37.597
just like Merrill Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:16:37.817 --> 02:16:51.662
and Mary Holland were probably the controlled op for all of these vaccine-injured parents so that they have somewhere to yell and they'd have some conference to go to, some hero to point to, but they were never gonna score a touchdown.

02:16:51.702 --> 02:17:02.086
They were always playing the Lucy game, always pulling the ball away just before Brian Hooker would kick the field goal.

02:17:03.106 --> 02:17:07.128
just before these people would reach the finish line.

02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:16.754
Make no mistake about it, one of the biggest delusions that they need to hide is that that previous vaccine schedule wasn't that bad.

02:17:20.116 --> 02:17:21.316
And that this is much worse.

02:17:21.376 --> 02:17:22.937
I mean, what they did here is crazy.

02:17:25.719 --> 02:17:29.481
That's what EpiGirl's main job is to make sure that you never go, hey, wait a minute,

02:17:30.399 --> 02:17:36.203
You proved that the coronavirus vaccine was dangerous using VAERS.

02:17:37.784 --> 02:17:43.528
But then that just leaves everybody open to be saying that the VAERS is just not, it's not reliable.

02:17:44.869 --> 02:17:48.151
The exact same excuse that they used for VAERS before the pandemic.

02:17:48.811 --> 02:17:52.534
And now we're running in a hamster wheel that we were already in at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:17:54.994 --> 02:17:59.576
And that's why Jessica Rose is very careful not to say that all vaccines were bad.

02:17:59.996 --> 02:18:05.739
She still hasn't gotten there, despite being an immunologist, computational virologist, and whatever else.

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.261
But she's sure that these COVID shots are bad.

02:18:10.381 --> 02:18:11.341
Boy, is she sure of it.

02:18:12.462 --> 02:18:16.644
She was also really sure for a couple of years that the spike protein was a sign of gain of function.

02:18:16.684 --> 02:18:23.887
It might hurt people's mitochondria, or maybe even Walter Chestnut's right, and it causes premature aging, almost like a radiation sickness.

02:18:26.152 --> 02:18:27.195
It's all the same team.

02:18:27.757 --> 02:18:28.960
All the same team.

02:18:30.745 --> 02:18:32.109
One, two, three, worst case scenario.

02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:33.193
Worst case scenario.

02:18:34.862 --> 02:18:37.183
It's a billion dollar business now.

02:18:37.263 --> 02:18:50.089
I'm like, fine, if you're sick, or maybe if you did come in contact with somebody that had a really bad case, there may be some level where it's like, hey, you've got to go get tested to find out what's going on.

02:18:50.109 --> 02:18:50.670
I think symptoms make sense.

02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:52.710
Yeah, if you've got symptoms, take care of this.

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.191
That's a really good sign.

02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:57.173
The asymptomatic spread stuff has really fallen apart.

02:18:57.653 --> 02:19:00.934
I mean, that was sent around and quite popular in the spring.

02:19:00.954 --> 02:19:02.215
A lot of the papers came out of China.

02:19:02.515 --> 02:19:05.736
That was the terrifying part because that made everybody an other.

02:19:06.096 --> 02:19:10.398
That made every single person you encountered, whether they were sick or not, dangerous.

02:19:10.438 --> 02:19:11.879
They might as well have had leprosy.

02:19:12.499 --> 02:19:13.099
Absolutely.

02:19:13.119 --> 02:19:20.262
And that was, I think, the key for them to get control over society is to send out and amplify that message that it doesn't matter if you have symptoms.

02:19:20.302 --> 02:19:22.543
You really, everyone needs to be afraid of everybody else.

02:19:23.783 --> 02:19:25.384
and we all need to panic a little bit harder.

02:19:25.825 --> 02:19:31.469
But the papers that are coming out now, I think the most recent one in JAMA showed 0.7%.

02:19:31.529 --> 02:19:34.551
Look how close they walk to the truth and they never quite get it, right?

02:19:34.631 --> 02:19:39.754
They would lie about everything except the actual thing.

02:19:40.495 --> 02:19:41.535
That they would never lie about.

02:19:41.575 --> 02:19:47.940
Obviously, that's true because PCR works and sequencing works and I'm from the Human Genome Project, but they would lie about everything else.

02:19:50.421 --> 02:19:56.225
but just not to the extent to which this would be an illusion created out of whole cloth of consensus.

02:19:56.285 --> 02:19:57.506
No, that's not possible.

02:19:59.067 --> 02:20:02.650
He owes his allegiance to NIH and the U.S.

02:20:02.730 --> 02:20:03.251
government.

02:20:04.131 --> 02:20:07.013
He owes his allegiance not to even the U.S.

02:20:07.033 --> 02:20:19.843
government, but specifically to MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Eric Lander, Francis Collins, and all the people that coordinated via the Department of Energy, the Human Genome Project.

02:20:21.547 --> 02:20:23.008
It was a top secret thing.

02:20:25.410 --> 02:20:30.495
He got to take intellectual property out of it and try to develop it commercially.

02:20:30.615 --> 02:20:32.416
And it was successful several times.

02:20:33.657 --> 02:20:40.964
His dad was also in biotech and he claims to have pulled his own self up by his own bootstraps.

02:20:41.644 --> 02:20:49.291
And now he's risking his career in pot genetics to try and save our children from something, I guess.

02:20:54.907 --> 02:20:58.289
and asymptomatic spread in indoor environments.

02:20:58.309 --> 02:21:07.935
So the worst possible condition where everyone's locked inside, the- You mean like the Biogen super spreader event that Robert Malone was at?

02:21:08.235 --> 02:21:10.937
Symptomatic spread was barely noticeable above background.

02:21:11.077 --> 02:21:14.118
And I think it was something like 25% if you're symptomatic.

02:21:14.178 --> 02:21:16.980
So the asymptomatic story is really crumbling.

02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:19.482
And that really points

02:21:20.322 --> 02:21:24.344
and underscores why these PCR tests can be so damaging.

02:21:24.524 --> 02:21:27.226
They're the right tool in the hospital, and the doctors need these tests.

02:21:27.246 --> 02:21:44.576
There's no doubt that doctors like these tests, but I think they're all a little frustrated that people are taking an RNA score that comes off this test without any information on symptoms or any other clinical management, any understanding of prior disease, of the patient's background, and declaring you a quarantine subject, not even knowing if you're infectious.

02:21:45.156 --> 02:21:46.417
They could not get away with that in 2009.

02:21:46.977 --> 02:21:50.199
He made sure he asked the question again, are you infectious?

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:52.461
Are you infectious?

02:21:53.402 --> 02:22:01.227
I think they're all kind of shocked that it's happening now, that this level of testing is happening, even on children that don't really have the capacity to perform informed consent.

02:22:01.928 --> 02:22:04.169
It's really gone way overboard.

02:22:04.209 --> 02:22:09.173
And the reason I brought up the regulatory stuff before is that when these industries get this big, they're hard to stop.

02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:12.155
I mean, Thermo did $2 billion in testing last quarter.

02:22:12.175 --> 02:22:13.676
They're growing 40% a quarter.

02:22:14.037 --> 02:22:14.897
Quest did $1 billion.

02:22:15.057 --> 02:22:15.958
LabCorp did $1 billion.

02:22:17.218 --> 02:22:18.939
Those are just three I know off the top of my head.

02:22:18.979 --> 02:22:26.542
This is a multi-billion dollar... Oh, so it's those guys that are responsible, not the people that are making the tests, not the people that got the EUA.

02:22:30.823 --> 02:22:43.168
What if I told you that an EUA was granted by the FDA to a former movie producer, a porn movie producer, and that that porn movie producer was allowed to start a PCR business?

02:22:44.085 --> 02:22:47.667
and start testing municipal employees weekly in 2020.

02:22:50.268 --> 02:22:51.428
Would that surprise you at all?

02:22:52.289 --> 02:22:56.791
That not everybody that got into PCR testing was as qualified as this super genius?

02:22:57.831 --> 02:22:58.992
Would that surprise you at all?

02:23:00.293 --> 02:23:02.854
But PCR is great for this, it just should be in hospitals, you know?

02:23:03.914 --> 02:23:07.836
Even though they were doing it in every university that I was allowed to.

02:23:08.376 --> 02:23:11.438
They were doing it in municipalities all around the United States.

02:23:13.502 --> 02:23:14.062
Hospitals.

02:23:15.783 --> 02:23:17.563
He's talking out of both sides of his mouth here.

02:23:18.043 --> 02:23:18.884
Quarterly industry.

02:23:19.684 --> 02:23:28.847
That's not going to stop anytime soon, given, you know, they're selling these now to every high school and every, even elementary school, that, hey, you have to test all your kids every week.

02:23:29.787 --> 02:23:32.708
And the schools don't know any better, other than if we don't do this, we might be liable.

02:23:32.748 --> 02:23:33.788
So they all sign up for it.

02:23:34.769 --> 02:23:39.250
And this is kind of absurd, because the kids are a thousand fold less likely to ever get symptoms.

02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:42.162
and they're not known to transmit it very well.

02:23:42.242 --> 02:23:53.150
So it's like they've gone after the part of the- Just can't seem to muster the possibility that this would allow an incredible amount of exaggeration and lying.

02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:57.053
You know, like Peter Thiel said right before the pandemic on the Portal podcast.

02:24:00.066 --> 02:24:16.494
that all this fidelity could be faked, that all this knowledge could be faked, that this signal could be generated out of whole cloth, background, even not necessarily background, just a flawed PCR test that maybe was designed by a Chinese company that was chosen by a porn producer.

02:24:20.055 --> 02:24:27.379
We had over 200 EUA grants in the United States alone for PCR diagnostics, 220 products.

02:24:31.189 --> 02:24:33.992
were given EUAs as PCR products.

02:24:34.533 --> 02:24:36.596
And as he described them, what do they do?

02:24:37.256 --> 02:24:40.961
They measure if you have RNA molecules related to the virus.

02:24:41.962 --> 02:24:42.683
Stop lying!

02:24:43.183 --> 02:24:46.768
What a awful, malevolent liar.

02:24:48.047 --> 02:24:50.688
offering no useful insight at all.

02:24:51.548 --> 02:25:01.810
And this vapid moron that's interviewing him that used to work for the World Bank and Monsanto is playing along because he's getting promoted.

02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:04.250
He's promoting some network called what?

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:08.871
The Articulate Ventures Network?

02:25:08.931 --> 02:25:09.891
Boy, I can imagine.

02:25:09.991 --> 02:25:11.092
I can only imagine.

02:25:11.112 --> 02:25:13.232
I can only imagine what that is.

02:25:14.377 --> 02:25:20.959
If we were to look into that, I'm spraying ink everywhere now because I'm starting to slam my pen down on the page because I'm pissed.

02:25:23.961 --> 02:25:25.101
I want this over with.

02:25:26.261 --> 02:25:29.243
I never want to see this person on social media again.

02:25:30.823 --> 02:25:33.164
He's just a fraud like they all are.

02:25:35.205 --> 02:25:37.066
And I'm gonna, I can go on all day.

02:25:37.766 --> 02:25:38.806
I can go on all week.

02:25:38.886 --> 02:25:40.707
I can go on all summer and I'm gonna.

02:25:43.905 --> 02:25:44.706
I'm done with this.

02:25:44.786 --> 02:25:46.467
There's no more punches being pulled.

02:25:46.627 --> 02:25:48.388
I'm not titrating anything anymore.

02:25:48.428 --> 02:25:49.649
Population that can't vote.

02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:55.233
And force them all to take these tests that aren't necessarily... It's a big boondoggle.

02:25:55.933 --> 02:25:57.494
Maybe it appeases the teacher unions.

02:25:57.514 --> 02:25:57.915
I don't know.

02:25:58.015 --> 02:25:59.756
But the teachers are the ones that should be getting tested.

02:25:59.776 --> 02:26:01.477
They're the ones that are more at risk.

02:26:01.737 --> 02:26:02.678
What a question!

02:26:02.738 --> 02:26:05.260
Oh, we should be testing the teachers, not the kids.

02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:06.961
Holy balls.

02:26:07.521 --> 02:26:10.763
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:26:11.264 --> 02:26:12.825
And that might as well be him saying it.

02:26:12.905 --> 02:26:18.789
He has all the responsibility for the people who didn't know better and transfected themselves.

02:26:18.849 --> 02:26:25.613
He has all the responsibility for the people who didn't know better and bought into the fear and uncertainty and doubt and transfected themselves.

02:26:25.753 --> 02:26:33.879
Just like Robert Malone, just like Brett Weinstein, just like Jessica Rose, they're all guilty of murder because they're covering it up.

02:26:34.727 --> 02:26:39.011
They know that they murdered people and tried to misconstrue it as a lab leak.

02:26:40.372 --> 02:26:43.895
And they know that they're failing miserably at it because they're off script.

02:26:44.375 --> 02:26:50.080
Because we needed three years of badgering before we would believe it.

02:26:51.201 --> 02:26:53.643
They didn't have time because maybe Trump rushed them.

02:26:55.085 --> 02:26:55.505
I don't know.

02:26:55.945 --> 02:26:57.587
It seems like it might be true.

02:26:58.848 --> 02:27:00.469
And so now they're so off script.

02:27:01.090 --> 02:27:02.231
They're so lost.

02:27:04.107 --> 02:27:10.795
that Sasha Latapova, mother of Soph, is interacting with this character on Twitter.

02:27:11.456 --> 02:27:13.379
I mean, it's amazeballs.

02:27:13.839 --> 02:27:15.041
Yes, please.

02:27:15.642 --> 02:27:17.824
But we see all the focus on the children.

02:27:17.844 --> 02:27:18.245
I don't get it.

02:27:18.285 --> 02:27:18.886
It's really bizarre.

02:27:19.386 --> 02:27:22.307
So you said earlier that you applied for a retraction.

02:27:22.627 --> 02:27:26.469
Why are you taking this on as something that you're participating in?

02:27:26.489 --> 02:27:27.149
I mean, you're not.

02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:32.792
I got asked to do it probably based on my Twitter history, just having an understanding of this.

02:27:33.692 --> 02:27:35.413
But I also didn't know the authors.

02:27:35.473 --> 02:27:37.694
I think the people who really initiated this.

02:27:38.134 --> 02:27:40.515
I also didn't know the authors.

02:27:40.615 --> 02:27:41.896
OK, so who initiated it?

02:27:41.916 --> 02:27:46.458
Because I know who initiated it because Thomas Bender told me it was the first author.

02:27:47.932 --> 02:27:51.173
The guy who went around on Twitter calling people glowies for three years.

02:27:52.967 --> 02:27:55.769
wanted an independent view on this of someone who wasn't.

02:27:56.449 --> 02:27:58.310
The authors were in Germany, and I don't know them.

02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:00.751
I didn't even know of them prior to this.

02:28:00.811 --> 02:28:01.432
I probably should have.

02:28:01.472 --> 02:28:03.593
They're well published in the virology space.

02:28:03.673 --> 02:28:05.214
But I admit it's not known.

02:28:05.254 --> 02:28:06.735
He didn't know Jorsten.

02:28:06.835 --> 02:28:11.838
No, nobody knows Jorsten, even though he's the guy who made the PCR test for the first SARS virus.

02:28:12.158 --> 02:28:13.639
And they said, oh, it's perfect.

02:28:13.659 --> 02:28:15.740
You understand PCR, and you don't know these people.

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:17.541
You're a perfect person to take a look at this.

02:28:17.561 --> 02:28:18.421
What do you think?

02:28:19.042 --> 02:28:20.683
And when I first looked at it, I was like, eh.

02:28:21.383 --> 02:28:23.084
I've made those mistakes in PCR myself.

02:28:23.144 --> 02:28:30.550
I don't know that I would want to go after a group of people that were trying to be early on this during a pandemic.

02:28:30.590 --> 02:28:32.551
I would want to perhaps cheer them on.

02:28:33.092 --> 02:28:34.493
I'm all for the entrepreneur, right?

02:28:34.573 --> 02:28:38.456
But they then backed up and said, no, no, you have to look at how this happened.

02:28:38.516 --> 02:28:40.237
This happened through regulatory capture.

02:28:40.317 --> 02:28:48.664
They took this protocol and sent it to the WHO before it went through peer review, and after they gave it to their labs where they have a financial interest in testing.

02:28:49.544 --> 02:28:51.825
And I said, all right, that kind of triggered me.

02:28:51.885 --> 02:28:54.326
I was like, that's not cool.

02:28:54.626 --> 02:29:11.691
So it has nothing to do with PCR testing, nothing to do with having no background data, no evidence, no background information to work from to tell whether or not this PCR test is pulling off of a pre-existing background or an existing spreading novel pathogen, nothing like that.

02:29:13.991 --> 02:29:19.812
just an incredible amount of words that mean nothing, that said nothing taught nobody anything.

02:29:20.532 --> 02:29:22.933
This whole broadcast has been that so far.

02:29:23.173 --> 02:29:31.134
They sent it to the- Explain that last part, meaning that these are not like university professors that are sitting in a laboratory.

02:29:31.154 --> 02:29:38.635
So some of the authors are, but they have scientific advisory relationships to labs in Germany.

02:29:38.775 --> 02:29:41.196
And so make clear, he's talking about the Drorsten

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:45.142
publication and their conflicts of interest.

02:29:45.162 --> 02:29:57.811
He's not in any way telling you that Thomas Binder, Claire Craig, Peter Borger, Kevin McKernan, and these other people are on that paper.

02:29:57.851 --> 02:29:58.632
He's not saying that.

02:29:59.381 --> 02:29:59.401
I

02:30:14.121 --> 02:30:17.204
He's deflecting from the idea, so who did you write this paper with?

02:30:17.224 --> 02:30:18.645
Because you were asked to do it.

02:30:18.765 --> 02:30:19.826
Who asked you to do it?

02:30:20.226 --> 02:30:21.647
We're not talking about that at all.

02:30:21.708 --> 02:30:26.872
He's focused on the Dorsten thing, and they're bad guys, and they've got all these conflicts of interest.

02:30:26.932 --> 02:30:36.300
Never mind that he owes all of his allegiance to the national security state that gave him the intellectual property that allowed him to build multigenerational wealth with his father and his brothers.

02:30:37.641 --> 02:30:38.562
Don't mind that.

02:30:39.443 --> 02:30:41.905
Pay attention to the Germans with conflicts of interest.

02:30:47.082 --> 02:30:50.283
I'm going to keep grinding and grinding.

02:30:51.604 --> 02:30:52.364
Some testing revenue.

02:30:52.384 --> 02:30:56.105
And so those companies got the assay first, no crime there.

02:30:56.346 --> 02:30:57.366
Then it went to the WHO.

02:30:57.486 --> 02:31:04.649
I'm like, well, you're trying to leverage regulatory authority there to get your test approved when it's not been peer reviewed.

02:31:05.229 --> 02:31:11.892
When they put it through peer review, they were on the editorial board of the journal they put it to, and it went through peer review in 24 hours.

02:31:13.573 --> 02:31:15.374
And that's never happened at that journal before.

02:31:15.614 --> 02:31:25.083
We went through and scraped all of the submission timelines and the peer review timelines off the journal, and the average is like 172 days for this journal.

02:31:25.464 --> 02:31:28.226
And I think the next closest one was like a 20-day peer review.

02:31:28.427 --> 02:31:32.911
See, so it's not fair that they got it through peer review so fast, so it must be fake.

02:31:35.265 --> 02:31:44.689
Asking the wrong questions and then having a very vigorous debate within that limited spectrum is exactly what he's done for the last 45 minutes of this video.

02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:46.941
So this thing got rammed through peer review.

02:31:46.961 --> 02:31:52.743
But couldn't this be the response to Pearl Harbor or the response to 9-11 where people are rising to the occasion?

02:31:52.763 --> 02:31:56.925
I mean, like, I mean, I can see you're saying, hey, they broke their protocols.

02:31:56.945 --> 02:31:57.906
This is really different.

02:31:58.006 --> 02:31:59.586
This may be why there are holes there.

02:32:00.067 --> 02:32:03.428
But there doesn't necessarily have to be malintent in that.

02:32:03.688 --> 02:32:12.072
No, the only thing that I think is a real scar on the peer review process is they didn't disclose the conflicts of interest when they did this.

02:32:12.852 --> 02:32:18.793
And that put the journal in a bad spot, because the journal didn't have the radar out for conflicts.

02:32:20.814 --> 02:32:24.234
When you submit a paper, you're supposed to submit all your financial conflicts with it.

02:32:25.014 --> 02:32:31.556
And if you don't disclose those, and they didn't- Think about how much time and energy he's wasting on this that has nothing to do with reality.

02:32:31.716 --> 02:32:33.496
It's just like, wow.

02:32:34.056 --> 02:32:39.277
So what's a list of things that we can talk about for 15 minutes each that will not save anyone?

02:32:42.619 --> 02:32:44.240
can't disclose themselves either.

02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:47.122
Somebody else figured out they had conflicts later and complained to the journal.

02:32:47.142 --> 02:32:51.745
And the journal finally updated the paper to mention their conflicts of interest in the testing labs.

02:32:52.685 --> 02:32:54.046
So the journal got blindsided.

02:32:54.146 --> 02:33:00.470
They got sent this paper, didn't really appreciate the conflicts that were there, let it zip through peer review too quickly.

02:33:00.890 --> 02:33:03.932
And lo and behold, it's the worst performing assay in the marketplace.

02:33:04.572 --> 02:33:07.474
We've got reams of evidence on that, that it actually is flawed.

02:33:07.995 --> 02:33:09.716
So the peer review here broke.

02:33:10.596 --> 02:33:17.083
And it was done with, I would say, malintent, because they hid their conflicts, which later came to light.

02:33:17.564 --> 02:33:20.547
Now, that's one insult.

02:33:20.567 --> 02:33:22.729
The second insult is ramming it through the who.

02:33:22.849 --> 02:33:24.451
The who's not a peer-reviewed body.

02:33:24.531 --> 02:33:27.795
They're just going with the relationships that they have and people they trust.

02:33:27.835 --> 02:33:29.036
And so they probably knew these people.

02:33:29.076 --> 02:33:42.683
Are we setting up the who to be the main bad guy, the who to be the people that we need to fight eventually that Meryl Nass will have to make her own nonprofit separate from CHD so that she can fight the who on her own with the help of Mary Holland?

02:33:46.624 --> 02:33:47.125
I see it.

02:33:47.265 --> 02:33:50.206
I just see just narrative curation.

02:33:50.286 --> 02:33:55.869
I just see a guy who works for them, a trader selling out America and our children.

02:33:57.950 --> 02:33:59.031
and threw the protocol up.

02:33:59.371 --> 02:34:03.154
He's just staying loyal to the people who've taken care of him his whole frickin' life.

02:34:03.675 --> 02:34:05.797
But now the WHO's got this dirty protocol on their hand.

02:34:05.817 --> 02:34:18.167
You'll notice, I think a few weeks ago, after a retraction request went through, the WHO shifted their communication on PCR and started backpedaling a little bit on, hey, we may have some PCR protocols in here that are early and need refinements.

02:34:18.187 --> 02:34:26.714
So I think they've seen the writing on the wall that this is now a massive liability that anyone... Interesting point that, uh...

02:34:28.306 --> 02:34:33.310
Oseen makes there that it's not, he's not saying that Jorsten was an editor.

02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:35.652
That may be how he got it through peer review so fast.

02:34:35.692 --> 02:34:37.133
So it's kind of weak.

02:34:38.334 --> 02:34:42.057
Again, making sure that you will run and hit the cage, right?

02:34:42.097 --> 02:34:47.281
Because you'll run and complain and then somebody else will point that out and say, yeah, but he was an editor.

02:34:47.321 --> 02:34:48.942
That's how they got it through so fast.

02:34:52.225 --> 02:34:57.749
I think he caught a very good thing in the chat there because he's setting people up to run into a different part of the cage then.

02:34:58.459 --> 02:35:03.284
When they go running and telling their friends, yeah, but they got it through peer review and it wasn't fair.

02:35:03.324 --> 02:35:05.586
And then somebody else knows a different part of the story.

02:35:06.747 --> 02:35:08.469
Heard it from wherever Osine heard it.

02:35:09.210 --> 02:35:19.300
That it was just him being an editor.

02:35:19.602 --> 02:35:28.964
money who's been falsely locked down or had their business destroyed is going to want to file case against whoever created a test that falsely led to those circumstances.

02:35:30.144 --> 02:35:30.284
Whoa.

02:35:30.604 --> 02:35:32.985
That is, that's a Peter Thiel paradox.

02:35:33.065 --> 02:35:34.865
If I've ever heard one, it's happening.

02:35:34.945 --> 02:35:41.027
Everybody has talked about the liability going towards go safety, go see a Peter Thiel paradox.

02:35:43.927 --> 02:35:47.408
What T F.

02:35:48.907 --> 02:35:51.037
is a Peter Thiel paradox.

02:35:53.041 --> 02:35:55.442
That is bizarro world.

02:35:55.622 --> 02:36:00.224
A little bit on, hey, we may have some PCR protocols in here that are early and need refinement.

02:36:00.244 --> 02:36:15.089
So I think they've seen the writing on the wall that this is now a massive liability, that anyone who's been falsely locked down or had their business destroyed is going to want to file case against whoever created a test that falsely led to those.

02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:19.211
Interesting that I'm actually consulting on exactly such a case.

02:36:19.611 --> 02:36:22.672
And CHD and ICANN are not.

02:36:24.912 --> 02:36:25.973
Let me repeat that again.

02:36:26.353 --> 02:36:30.015
Interesting that I'm consulting on a case exactly about this.

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:37.240
And CHD and ICANN are not.

02:36:40.542 --> 02:36:41.203
Interesting, right?

02:36:41.343 --> 02:36:45.205
It's not like the people in these cases haven't sought their help.

02:36:46.706 --> 02:36:47.667
They got laughed away.

02:36:48.347 --> 02:36:50.969
They were told that it's a stupid case, that it'll never go anywhere.

02:36:52.253 --> 02:37:00.478
And yet here he is in 2020 saying this is a huge vulnerability potentially for any business that wants to sue for the people that made those tests.

02:37:00.878 --> 02:37:02.800
What an interesting thing for him to say.

02:37:05.621 --> 02:37:10.224
What an interesting thing for me to hear him say in light of what I'm consulting for.

02:37:10.644 --> 02:37:12.626
Maybe we'll have to add him to the witness list.

02:37:13.425 --> 02:37:14.165
circumstances.

02:37:15.406 --> 02:37:19.248
Whoa, that is that's a Peter Thiel paradox if I've ever heard one.

02:37:19.589 --> 02:37:20.049
It's happening.

02:37:20.149 --> 02:37:24.691
Everybody has talked about the liability going towards go safety, go safety, go safety.

02:37:24.751 --> 02:37:27.273
But you're saying the polarity could get reversed.

02:37:27.693 --> 02:37:28.253
It has been.

02:37:28.374 --> 02:37:29.374
The cases have been filed.

02:37:30.215 --> 02:37:30.455
Yeah.

02:37:30.635 --> 02:37:32.156
So they're going after these people.

02:37:33.164 --> 02:37:40.970
And I don't know where and what jurisdiction is gonna prevail, but there's enough people that class action lawsuits now materializing.

02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:44.112
I think Reiner Fulmich is the person who's the head of the sphere in this.

02:37:44.473 --> 02:37:54.400
Nice, Reiner, the guy that took their money and made it into gold or the guy that like paid for his house because he was afraid the money that was donated to the CIC would be lost.

02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:02.106
You mean the guy who set up the Coronavirus Committee in Germany that then actually recorded an interview with Sasha Latupova like four times?

02:38:05.256 --> 02:38:05.676
That one?

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:22.628
The Coronavirus Investigational Committee in Germany may have done some interviews with some very good people, but has over-promoted some very bad ideas and some very bad people.

02:38:23.609 --> 02:38:25.150
Sasha Lantupova being one of them.

02:38:26.731 --> 02:38:28.072
Meryl Nass being another one.

02:38:31.034 --> 02:38:32.295
And I suspect many more.

02:38:34.264 --> 02:38:36.845
Remember, Germany is at the heart of this, right?

02:38:36.905 --> 02:38:48.409
Germany is at the heart of this international group of people and traders that are interested in serving the globalists and interested in controlled demolition of America specifically.

02:38:50.149 --> 02:38:53.050
You don't think there are people in Germany who've got a vendetta with us?

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:57.432
You don't think there are people in the UK that got a vendetta against us as a people?

02:39:00.253 --> 02:39:00.873
You're mistaken.

02:39:02.719 --> 02:39:12.445
And they are trying to bring to light that these tests that went through a shaky peer review have destroyed businesses and people's lives, and they want to see some change.

02:39:13.186 --> 02:39:17.108
So I got involved because I could review the science, the paper.

02:39:17.348 --> 02:39:18.789
I can't speak to all those politics.

02:39:18.949 --> 02:39:20.910
I can't speak to the lawsuit.

02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:21.430
I'm not a lawyer.

02:39:22.371 --> 02:39:23.972
But I can certainly find

02:39:24.252 --> 02:39:25.474
problems and protocols.

02:39:25.794 --> 02:39:31.761
And I've gone through all the other literature that demonstrates this protocol is in fact flawed compared to everything else.

02:39:32.382 --> 02:39:35.465
And I'll leave it up to everyone else to decide whether the peer review system needs to change.

02:39:35.526 --> 02:39:42.334
But if you want it to change, he's got a solution that involves blockchain.

02:39:43.663 --> 02:39:45.965
Just in case you wanna know, that's his thing.

02:39:46.505 --> 02:39:48.187
He spoke about that in front of the Senate too.

02:39:48.267 --> 02:39:49.768
The blockchain will help peer review.

02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:58.876
As you know from- So tell us about the flaws in a way that would make it- Yeah, tell us about the flaws because that's another thing that he is being seeded in order to do.

02:39:59.156 --> 02:40:01.318
Possible for a lay person to understand.

02:40:01.938 --> 02:40:11.887
Well, there's- He's never gonna get to the stage where he says that P-values as they're currently used on the academic bench and as they're currently used to fuel the publication crisis,

02:40:13.211 --> 02:40:18.594
needs to be fundamentally reorganized around different principles and around testing models for validity.

02:40:18.994 --> 02:40:22.095
He's not going to explain that flaw in the publication system.

02:40:22.436 --> 02:40:27.078
He's going to argue for a sort of peer review system that's just different.

02:40:28.103 --> 02:40:32.486
with blockchain because blockchain is so awesome, Bitcoin, blockchain, Bitcoin.

02:40:32.726 --> 02:40:39.630
A few papers out there showing positive signal from this test when they run it on no template controls.

02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:42.212
That's another scientific word for water.

02:40:43.173 --> 02:40:48.816
So you don't want water creating a positive because that quarantines somebody when it shouldn't.

02:40:49.156 --> 02:40:50.757
Now it's not doing that on all samples.

02:40:50.877 --> 02:40:54.320
So how does a PCR test create a false positive?

02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:59.023
if it's such an accurate and useful thing, at least in the hospitals, according to him.

02:40:59.543 --> 02:41:03.866
What is this bullshit other than, well, then they're not making very good products, are they?

02:41:04.747 --> 02:41:12.432
And yet we are told to rely on these products, even if they're designed by and ordered by and administered by a former porn movie producer.

02:41:17.375 --> 02:41:19.036
But it's the FDA getting in the way.

02:41:19.096 --> 02:41:22.038
It's like 10 pages of EUA stuff to get anything out.

02:41:22.078 --> 02:41:23.239
That's what he said in the first one.

02:41:24.431 --> 02:41:25.092
They would see that.

02:41:25.572 --> 02:41:29.614
If all water samples lit up, we would have known this well back in January.

02:41:30.315 --> 02:41:32.016
This paper was... Water samples?

02:41:32.056 --> 02:41:33.377
You mean sewer samples?

02:41:34.457 --> 02:41:35.118
Stop lying!

02:41:35.882 --> 02:41:41.946
submitted, I think, on the mid-January time frame, which is very early, actually.

02:41:41.986 --> 02:41:54.315
If you look at the timeline of when coronavirus was around, and the body of work that went into this paper probably means they started on this in November, December time frame last year.

02:41:54.856 --> 02:41:56.897
So they were very far ahead of the curve.

02:41:57.198 --> 02:41:59.599
So far ahead of the curve, people are questioning how they know.

02:42:01.394 --> 02:42:02.875
They are known in this space.

02:42:02.915 --> 02:42:05.016
They have been studying coronaviruses for a long time.

02:42:05.816 --> 02:42:09.898
In fact, they even used an old assay that they had for SARS-CoV-1.

02:42:10.518 --> 02:42:12.219
They used an old assay.

02:42:12.359 --> 02:42:16.821
Do you remember what he said that PCR was like?

02:42:17.741 --> 02:42:19.982
PCR is like making chocolate milk.

02:42:21.743 --> 02:42:25.064
So what is this, they're using an old assay from before?

02:42:26.536 --> 02:42:27.317
other than a lie.

02:42:27.977 --> 02:42:29.538
Because it's like making chocolate milk.

02:42:29.558 --> 02:42:35.722
You just put primers in, you find their melting points, you choose the cycle length, and you go.

02:42:37.182 --> 02:42:38.483
What is he even saying here?

02:42:38.944 --> 02:42:43.006
He said in the first podcast that PCR is like chocolate milk.

02:42:45.568 --> 02:42:48.289
And yet now they're making chocolate milk like they made it last time?

02:42:49.770 --> 02:42:51.551
Instead of making new chocolate milk?

02:42:53.712 --> 02:42:56.014
Has PCR as a technique changed?

02:42:59.394 --> 02:43:01.135
He's a liar.

02:43:01.795 --> 02:43:02.556
Stop lying.

02:43:02.656 --> 02:43:03.936
He's a liar.

02:43:04.356 --> 02:43:05.697
Stop lying.

02:43:09.939 --> 02:43:13.541
Probably means they started on this in November, December timeframe last year.

02:43:13.561 --> 02:43:16.122
Uh, so they were very far ahead of the curve.

02:43:16.442 --> 02:43:17.183
So far ahead of the curve.

02:43:17.203 --> 02:43:21.485
People are questioning how they know, but, uh, they are, they are no.

02:43:21.605 --> 02:43:23.726
Oh, so maybe it was around a little earlier.

02:43:23.806 --> 02:43:27.528
Maybe they covered up a lab leak and that's why they started it so early.

02:43:29.489 --> 02:43:30.049
in this space.

02:43:30.069 --> 02:43:32.190
They have been studying coronaviruses for a long time.

02:43:32.250 --> 02:43:39.651
So they, in fact, they even used an old assay that they had for SARS-CoV-1 because they were, I think they discovered that virus.

02:43:39.671 --> 02:43:40.952
So very credible in the space.

02:43:41.812 --> 02:43:43.752
So they had a jumpstart and they ran with it.

02:43:44.412 --> 02:43:46.673
They were very credible in this space.

02:43:46.753 --> 02:43:49.273
Like he's also very credible in the PCR space.

02:43:49.313 --> 02:43:51.354
That's where I find myself in the PCR space.

02:43:51.694 --> 02:43:55.475
He finds himself in the national security narrative creation space.

02:43:56.493 --> 02:44:02.674
But for the love of God, see this liar for who he is and the malevolence in his every word.

02:44:03.871 --> 02:44:06.252
He serves the people that would enslave your kids.

02:44:06.933 --> 02:44:09.254
But that's one flaw that scares people.

02:44:09.294 --> 02:44:14.878
When you see water samples lighting up in other laboratories, it means there's a problem with the assay.

02:44:14.958 --> 02:44:17.939
I've dug into that assay, and I can see where the problem sits.

02:44:18.119 --> 02:44:20.181
It's with the design of their PCR primers.

02:44:20.241 --> 02:44:23.723
These primers are the pieces of DNA sequence that you have to do.

02:44:23.843 --> 02:44:25.924
So if we get the PCR right, it's great.

02:44:26.024 --> 02:44:28.426
If we get the transfection right, it'll be great.

02:44:28.666 --> 02:44:30.067
All this stuff is awesome.

02:44:30.507 --> 02:44:32.368
Pfizer just pulled off an amazing feat.

02:44:32.628 --> 02:44:36.191
design to make the PCR reaction amplify.

02:44:36.411 --> 02:44:39.654
So you need to know a little bit of sequence to design a PCR reaction.

02:44:39.694 --> 02:44:45.038
And in this case, they had a little bit, you need to know a little bit of the sequence in order to design a PCR test.

02:44:45.138 --> 02:44:47.060
Wow, I thought that's interesting.

02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:48.841
Is that part of the making of chocolate milk?

02:44:48.881 --> 02:44:50.963
What the shit is going on here?

02:44:52.825 --> 02:44:54.746
It's a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt.

02:44:54.786 --> 02:44:56.668
He's not teaching the host anything.

02:44:57.912 --> 02:45:00.833
God forbid he would use a graphic or something, right?

02:45:00.933 --> 02:45:06.316
None of these people are able to use slides on Zoom ever, unless it's a peer-reviewed paper.

02:45:09.458 --> 02:45:09.898
Liars.

02:45:10.838 --> 02:45:11.359
Traitors.

02:45:12.599 --> 02:45:17.802
Selling us out to the highest bidders who are probably globalist, weaponized piles of money.

02:45:19.102 --> 02:45:22.044
Otherwise, why drop in the Peter Thiel paradox comment?

02:45:22.444 --> 02:45:23.645
Maybe they all work for Peter.

02:45:23.705 --> 02:45:24.345
It's possible.

02:45:25.672 --> 02:45:26.893
some information from China.

02:45:27.314 --> 02:45:43.447
Peter and Elon, the private interests of the globalists, you know, Peter Thiel, the gay guy, Elon Musk, the gay guy, you know, those guys that are faking it.

02:45:44.769 --> 02:45:45.890
I'm sorry, but it's true.

02:45:46.450 --> 02:45:47.311
I hate to break it to you.

02:45:48.615 --> 02:45:58.104
where they could design some short sequences that would anneal to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and amplify a short 100 base pair region of that virus.

02:45:58.124 --> 02:46:01.987
We're listening to a bunch of people who don't have to protect their kids from this world.

02:46:03.989 --> 02:46:06.511
That's why they are so happily to lie.

02:46:08.913 --> 02:46:11.175
Because they don't have any kids to protect.

02:46:11.255 --> 02:46:15.039
They have no interest in the next generation, except for as lab animals.

02:46:18.592 --> 02:46:19.633
They have no skin in the game.

02:46:21.334 --> 02:46:34.285
Once you start to realize how many of these people don't have skin in the game and how many people had skin in the game, the ones that don't have skin in the game didn't have very much in the game before the pandemic and have risen to prominence, like Epigirl.

02:46:35.646 --> 02:46:43.233
Others of them had an incredible amount of skin in the game, you know, like Judy Mikovits and Robert Malone, and they've also risen to prominence.

02:46:44.395 --> 02:47:11.879
Robert Malone had a whole bunch to lose, including property at the foot of the Shenandoah Mountains, the Shenandoah National Forest, and a horse breeding operation funded by Big Pharma and by the WHO, and by consulting for people who got over $50 billion in grants, sitting on study sections that awarded grants,

02:47:12.875 --> 02:47:15.776
for the NIH and NIAID and for DITRA.

02:47:17.496 --> 02:47:28.639
He called himself DITRA and us being the DOD at the beginning of the pandemic when he was talking to people like bus rider, MD, Paul Cottrell, who is promoted as a hero by George Webb, the fakest of all fakers.

02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:32.460
And they're all associated together.

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:39.882
They're all connected to one another, including this faker, this traitor,

02:47:40.916 --> 02:47:51.563
this poser as a dissident who was put in place as early as possible, as early as anybody else, to control a limited spectrum of debate about a novel virus?

02:47:51.903 --> 02:47:59.008
Well, if those primers react with themselves, they have a harder time reacting with the coronavirus RNA that's present.

02:47:59.148 --> 02:48:09.315
And that looks like what's happening is these primers look like they have some secondary structure in them and they have what's known as a primer dimer artifact that's making them create false signals when they shouldn't.

02:48:09.835 --> 02:48:12.876
As a result of this, they also are less sensitive primers.

02:48:13.016 --> 02:48:19.099
When your primers are busy messing around with themselves, they're not messing around with the target DNA that you want to amplify.

02:48:19.139 --> 02:48:21.500
And so they are less sensitive to amplifying your target.

02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:28.142
And that's been demonstrated in lots of literature as well, that they're not only a source of false negatives, but also a source of false positives.

02:48:28.323 --> 02:48:32.564
So that's a bad way to start the day with coronavirus, particularly early on.

02:48:33.105 --> 02:48:36.026
Many people copied that assay because it was at the WHO.

02:48:37.146 --> 02:48:41.227
They did a similar kind of appeal to authority and said that who said these things work, we're gonna use them.

02:48:41.407 --> 02:48:45.408
And then 20 papers later, we find out that everyone needs to redesign them and there's a problem.

02:48:46.049 --> 02:48:48.029
I don't know how frequently they're used today.

02:48:48.089 --> 02:48:53.991
For instance, the story with your daughter, I have no idea what test they ran on your daughter because it's impossible to figure that out in the United States.

02:48:54.011 --> 02:48:58.672
Yeah, it's impossible to figure that out in the United States because actually all the tests were centralized.

02:48:58.732 --> 02:49:01.533
All the testing was controlled by DITRA for the first year or two.

02:49:02.773 --> 02:49:04.774
Something that they just conveniently leave out.

02:49:05.523 --> 02:49:06.683
but we know for a fact.

02:49:07.624 --> 02:49:10.285
Centralized sequencing, centralized testing.

02:49:10.785 --> 02:49:25.731
So when Kevin McKernan says there's 15 million sequences of this virus, so don't tell me it's not there, he's talking about DOD, DITRA, CDC, FDA, HHS, curated sequencing database.

02:49:26.912 --> 02:49:30.513
He's not talking about open source, even though he claims that's the case, it's not.

02:49:31.274 --> 02:49:34.115
If you use their primers, then you're sequencing their signal.

02:49:37.125 --> 02:49:39.207
He's not explaining how sequencing is done yet.

02:49:39.227 --> 02:49:41.528
He's probably not going to get there because that's not part of this.

02:49:42.129 --> 02:49:48.373
Just like he didn't say anything to do with the potential dangers of pseudouridine substitution in the mRNA.

02:49:48.833 --> 02:49:50.395
He never called it a transfection.

02:49:50.735 --> 02:50:02.603
He never said the transfection hasn't really been working, hasn't been used successfully to augment an immune system, but boy, did they make an amazing feat by manufacturing this DNA and RNA.

02:50:04.084 --> 02:50:05.766
That's what Kevin McKernan just said.

02:50:06.789 --> 02:50:19.061
December 2020 the traitor and liar who's responsible for the murder in the United States and enabling it So we just assumed if the sitter had it that that it was like we were not.

02:50:19.181 --> 02:50:21.023
Oh, yeah Just be at home.

02:50:21.043 --> 02:50:21.923
We'll just quarantine.

02:50:21.963 --> 02:50:30.752
There's no price link nice link Check that out damn How the you of I?

02:50:32.199 --> 02:50:35.840
turned its COVID test into a moneymaker.

02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:37.101
Look at that.

02:50:38.341 --> 02:50:39.502
Isn't that neato?

02:50:42.043 --> 02:50:43.183
Isn't that neato?

02:50:43.423 --> 02:50:46.964
Oh, it's $65 million business as well as doing a public good.

02:50:47.004 --> 02:50:50.305
That sounds exactly like what Kevin McKernan is arguing for.

02:50:51.306 --> 02:50:54.567
And that's how you become a test subject without even knowing it.

02:50:55.868 --> 02:51:12.945
That's how they get to run the first AI program on, can we take all of these unidentified samples from the University of Illinois and cross-list them with their names, and then also look at their data on the Epic database?

02:51:13.911 --> 02:51:17.755
and see if we can connect any genomic data with their medical data.

02:51:17.835 --> 02:51:20.617
I wonder if we could use an AI to try and solve that problem.

02:51:20.657 --> 02:51:34.370
Well, all we need to do is get a hold of the remnants from one of these universities, and we can use our high throughput sequencing machines that we've already had for several decades, and certainly for the last decade, and we can sequence all the human DNA we have.

02:51:34.830 --> 02:51:44.638
We can create a database of it and then we can cross check it against predictions that would be made for the symptoms that they might have, for the attributes that they might have.

02:51:45.038 --> 02:51:49.122
And we have the genetic data from the remnants and the medical data from the EPIC database.

02:51:49.462 --> 02:51:57.829
And they're all freely available because we can get the EPIC database without people's names and we can get the remnants without people's names.

02:51:57.869 --> 02:52:00.531
And then we can use these AI programs to put them together.

02:52:03.055 --> 02:52:07.999
And if you don't think that's what these monsters were doing, then you're just naive.

02:52:09.621 --> 02:52:10.721
They were ready to do it.

02:52:12.183 --> 02:52:16.566
That's why they want you to be arguing about ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.

02:52:16.586 --> 02:52:23.812
That's why they want you to be arguing about who did it and who said it and who released it and whether or not these tests are expensive or not.

02:52:24.333 --> 02:52:26.875
Whether they need to be a week or two weeks apart.

02:52:27.676 --> 02:52:30.258
Whether you should renew your mask all the time or just sometimes.

02:52:33.715 --> 02:52:36.316
because it's all part of the same charade.

02:52:37.536 --> 02:52:42.858
And that Human Genome Project fraud is most definitely aware of it.

02:52:43.798 --> 02:52:50.600
His boss and mentor has said over and over again, Eric Lander, that we just need the genomes.

02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:51.820
Like, we need a lot of genomes.

02:52:51.860 --> 02:52:52.621
We need all the data.

02:52:52.641 --> 02:52:54.321
If we don't have all the data, we can't figure this out.

02:52:54.721 --> 02:52:57.942
If we learned anything from the Human Genome Project, it is that we need all the data.

02:53:00.743 --> 02:53:01.443
Stop lying!

02:53:02.304 --> 02:53:03.144
We are

02:53:04.372 --> 02:53:05.053
grinding this in.

02:53:05.073 --> 02:53:07.375
This is like putting a cigar out on the hand over and over again.

02:53:07.395 --> 02:53:07.796
We will not stop.

02:53:15.356 --> 02:53:20.458
So you have no idea as a person going to get a test, which one's getting deployed on you.

02:53:20.478 --> 02:53:22.079
And they all have different sensitivities.

02:53:22.639 --> 02:53:24.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:26.260
That's a really interesting thing.

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:30.062
You're saying there are multiple tests going on in the background.

02:53:30.242 --> 02:53:30.702
Hundreds.

02:53:31.122 --> 02:53:33.943
You don't actually know which test you are getting.

02:53:34.324 --> 02:53:36.264
And so they would never use that to lie.

02:53:37.125 --> 02:53:38.125
It's just unfortunate.

02:53:38.165 --> 02:53:39.306
It creates a lot of noise.

02:53:41.466 --> 02:53:42.727
And it's because they rushed it.

02:53:44.053 --> 02:53:56.503
because they got EUAs, because they flubbed it, because the whatever, whatever, whatever, but not the central thing that James Giordano told us in 2017, was they seed a few cases and lie about it.

02:53:57.123 --> 02:53:58.484
How would they seed a few cases?

02:53:59.005 --> 02:54:03.929
The PCR test, the sequencing, that's how.

02:54:05.069 --> 02:54:13.613
They would use recombinant DNA or an RNA to do it, which in the virology literature is often called infectious clones.

02:54:13.754 --> 02:54:22.018
Because as Kevin has been seeding throughout this little video, your main question you should be asking is when are you infectious and when are you aren't?

02:54:22.078 --> 02:54:24.019
Because the tests don't tell you that.

02:54:24.859 --> 02:54:25.540
Stop lying!

02:54:27.501 --> 02:54:27.721
No.

02:54:28.481 --> 02:54:28.642
No.

02:54:28.702 --> 02:54:32.163
And that's important because some of them have been thoroughly validated and some of them have not.

02:54:32.603 --> 02:54:42.608
The most thoroughly validated tests will have compared the PCR signals they get to the number of infectious viruses that are there.

02:54:43.048 --> 02:54:50.071
So you can take virus from patients and run it on a Petri dish that has Vero cells grown on it on a lawn.

02:54:50.591 --> 02:54:55.033
And it will create all these plaques that you can use, these little death spots in the lawn.

02:54:55.473 --> 02:55:05.671
Yeah, so plaque assays, the thing from the 50s, he's actually saying is a very valid way of measuring the number of viral particles that can replicate in a sample.

02:55:08.217 --> 02:55:15.924
Not next generation sequencing or nanopore or any of this other shit that he knows exists and could be applied to get a higher fidelity signal.

02:55:15.964 --> 02:55:16.304
No, no.

02:55:16.744 --> 02:55:27.013
He's actually arguing for the 1940s and 50s technique of plaque assays that involves multiple layers of agar.

02:55:30.606 --> 02:55:32.107
Can you see it?

02:55:32.287 --> 02:55:33.568
Tells you how many virions.

02:55:33.588 --> 02:55:37.851
You just count those little plaques and it tells you how many infective viruses you have.

02:55:37.891 --> 02:55:41.234
He agrees with Vincent Racaniello.

02:55:41.334 --> 02:55:43.375
He agrees with David Baltimore.

02:55:43.475 --> 02:55:45.377
He agrees with Robert Gallo.

02:55:45.477 --> 02:55:47.298
He agrees with Stanley Plotkin.

02:55:47.759 --> 02:55:49.820
He agrees with Hilary Kaprowski.

02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:51.521
He agrees with Francis Collins.

02:55:51.561 --> 02:55:53.643
He agrees with Tony Fauci.

02:55:53.723 --> 02:55:58.707
And his opposition to them is wholly a manufactured act.

02:55:59.758 --> 02:56:00.318
He's a traitor.

02:56:00.799 --> 02:56:01.619
In the patient sample.

02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:05.302
You do that in hundreds of patients, and then you also run qPCR on them.

02:56:05.322 --> 02:56:10.065
And then you can correlate what CT level is reflective of which infective load.

02:56:10.425 --> 02:56:12.746
Jafar did this at DDA Realt's lab.

02:56:12.766 --> 02:56:15.068
This is the lab that came up with hydroxychloroquine.

02:56:15.268 --> 02:56:16.869
DDA Realt's lab.

02:56:16.989 --> 02:56:17.769
Great.

02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:18.850
That's wonderful.

02:56:18.930 --> 02:56:21.572
Another, another probably controlled op.

02:56:21.972 --> 02:56:28.075
great work on basically measuring how well their PCR tests correlated with infectability.

02:56:28.155 --> 02:56:29.016
That's right.

02:56:29.076 --> 02:56:30.156
They're promoting that.

02:56:30.256 --> 02:56:34.999
He did something to do with infectiousness and CT count.

02:56:35.739 --> 02:56:40.322
And it was also with hydroxychloroquine, but we ignored that part of the paper.

02:56:40.362 --> 02:56:46.845
And we're mainly talking about the fact that he was looking at viral load and infectiousness or some shit like that.

02:56:47.525 --> 02:56:48.606
That's why they promoted him.

02:56:49.127 --> 02:56:51.108
And their number came out around CQ 33.

02:56:51.229 --> 02:56:54.671
I remember all this.

02:56:54.751 --> 02:56:56.673
I remember every one of these lies.

02:56:57.133 --> 02:56:57.193
Why?

02:56:57.753 --> 02:57:11.083
Because I was told to leave my faculty position that I loved, leave my lab, leave my students, leave my microscopes, leave everything that I had built, everything that I'd worked for, and not come back because I didn't go along with this.

02:57:12.604 --> 02:57:13.725
So I was paying attention.

02:57:15.049 --> 02:57:17.571
Like when you get punched in the mouth, you kind of pay attention.

02:57:17.611 --> 02:57:20.714
I've been punched in the mouth a lot during this pandemic.

02:57:20.754 --> 02:57:23.856
And now I have the feeling that I'd like to punch some other people in the mouths.

02:57:25.118 --> 02:57:27.399
I wish people would visit me in Pittsburgh this year.

02:57:28.285 --> 02:57:29.506
which is virus after that point.

02:57:29.526 --> 02:57:30.967
So they probably don't call anybody after 33.

02:57:31.067 --> 02:57:36.330
Uh, in United States, uh, we haven't seen assays that have been, uh, deployed that way.

02:57:36.430 --> 02:57:39.252
And so some people call out of assays deployed 40.

02:57:40.033 --> 02:57:41.254
Some people call it 37.

02:57:41.654 --> 02:57:47.338
It's hard to find out what they're calling these things that you have to kind of call up each lab and ask like, what, where, where are you calling this at?

02:57:47.398 --> 02:57:52.901
And what is your, uh, what does your EUA documentation say on what your limit of detection is?

02:57:53.021 --> 02:57:53.942
Is it 37?

02:57:54.062 --> 02:57:54.883
Why are you calling me at 38?

02:57:55.003 --> 02:57:57.765
If your limit is at 37, you know, these things do happen.

02:58:01.247 --> 02:58:05.330
He doesn't even talk about the stochastic nature of PCR, that it's got to start.

02:58:05.770 --> 02:58:22.242
And if the reaction doesn't start for three or four cycles because of the very small amount of material that's available for amplification, or if your concentrations of primers are wrong, or any number of other reasons, then the cycle might just not kick off.

02:58:22.842 --> 02:58:25.363
And so then it will go exponential in a later time.

02:58:25.723 --> 02:58:27.803
And so he's not telling you any of these things.

02:58:27.823 --> 02:58:30.644
He's not actually informing anybody about how these work.

02:58:31.104 --> 02:58:45.667
That's why he started with PCR measures if you have RNA molecules related to the virus, which is a gigantic battleship size bullshit lie about what this PCR does.

02:58:45.707 --> 02:58:51.548
It doesn't look for if you have RNA related to the virus, unless you mean one little tiny part.

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:53.708
That makes it really confusing.

02:58:53.748 --> 02:58:58.750
I mean, I received a letter from one of our schools saying we're, you know, oh, we're going to do school testing on all the kids.

02:58:58.950 --> 02:59:00.410
And we're going to use one of these four tests.

02:59:00.810 --> 02:59:01.670
We don't know which one, though.

02:59:02.511 --> 02:59:06.452
We're just going to choose my own adventure as we see fit and find the best pricing.

02:59:06.472 --> 02:59:07.952
And I'm like, well, those were great books.

02:59:08.012 --> 02:59:10.193
I read Choose Your Own Adventure books when I was a kid.

02:59:10.213 --> 02:59:10.753
They were awesome.

02:59:10.773 --> 02:59:11.953
I should buy those for my kid.

02:59:12.273 --> 02:59:14.135
Some of these are saliva tests.

02:59:14.195 --> 02:59:14.655
That's fine.

02:59:14.675 --> 02:59:15.456
That's less invasive.

02:59:15.476 --> 02:59:18.438
Some of these, like, shove something way up your nose, and you can actually do some damage.

02:59:18.979 --> 02:59:20.640
I kind of prefer you work on the saliva ones.

02:59:20.940 --> 02:59:21.561
Oh, yeah.

02:59:21.681 --> 02:59:22.582
Now, here we go.

02:59:22.702 --> 02:59:24.904
Nasal tests are bad, but saliva's great.

02:59:25.064 --> 02:59:26.325
U of I was using saliva.

02:59:26.665 --> 02:59:28.246
They developed their own saliva test.

02:59:29.247 --> 02:59:35.893
The case that I'm working on, they got an FDA for nasal swabs, but then they used saliva, which is pretty funny.

02:59:38.314 --> 02:59:40.455
It's all just one big cluster F of liars.

02:59:40.795 --> 02:59:44.477
Maybe tell us, what was this test validated on?

02:59:44.517 --> 02:59:45.937
What's the validation for this?

02:59:46.437 --> 02:59:54.641
So the message that we received when we went to get our test was, you can do the rapid test, but if you don't have symptoms, it's only 70% good at detecting it.

02:59:57.102 --> 02:59:57.562
Yeah.

02:59:57.783 --> 03:00:02.126
So so then we're like, well, why would we get then the rapid test gives us no information, right?

03:00:02.166 --> 03:00:02.906
Like, yeah.

03:00:03.006 --> 03:00:07.950
Is it possible that we are only 44 minutes into this and it's a minute?

03:00:08.130 --> 03:00:09.571
It's an hour and 20 left.

03:00:10.711 --> 03:00:11.552
Is it possible?

03:00:12.633 --> 03:00:19.978
How is it possible that it has been nonstop narrative curation for three podcasts?

03:00:21.239 --> 03:00:25.562
Three separate appearances in 2020, carefully titrating

03:00:26.249 --> 03:00:41.876
this viewership into a Scooby-Doo narrative where Pfizer does amazing manufacturing feats and pseudo-uridine is just something that they do to make the mRNA last longer, but it still doesn't last long enough.

03:00:41.896 --> 03:00:43.997
That's why you need two shots.

03:00:45.998 --> 03:00:46.678
You heard it here.

03:00:47.758 --> 03:00:48.499
That's what he said.

03:00:48.559 --> 03:00:50.119
The video is still up on YouTube.

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:51.680
He's a traitor.

03:00:53.697 --> 03:00:55.438
And everybody that promotes him is a traitor.

03:00:55.518 --> 03:00:57.800
Everybody that retweets him is a traitor.

03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:08.969
Everybody that coordinatedly lies with him in front of the Senate and in front of other places is a traitor to America and to all the free people on earth.

03:01:10.370 --> 03:01:12.771
The people that think nationalism is okay.

03:01:12.992 --> 03:01:15.574
It's okay to fly the Dutch flag if you like it.

03:01:15.694 --> 03:01:17.375
It's okay to fly the American flag.

03:01:17.415 --> 03:01:22.119
Isn't it interesting that if you fly the American flag, everybody already knows that you're a Republican?

03:01:22.858 --> 03:01:25.200
that you're a conservative, isn't that weird?

03:01:25.981 --> 03:01:28.122
I shouldn't say Republican, I should say conservative.

03:01:30.144 --> 03:01:35.769
Then if we're negative and it's positive, there's 30% of the time you're not gonna know that?

03:01:35.789 --> 03:01:36.629
How does that work?

03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:45.016
I'm actually more fond of those now than I was before, mainly because I feel like picking up the people who are symptomatic is the most important thing.

03:01:45.076 --> 03:01:48.779
This chasing all the asymptomatic people with PCR I think leads to more destruction.

03:01:48.819 --> 03:01:51.862
But why do you need tests to pick up people that are symptomatic?

03:01:52.915 --> 03:01:59.676
I mean, if it's a novel disease that everybody now agrees was very strange, then what do you need a test for it?

03:01:59.716 --> 03:02:05.257
If you're only concerned about picking up people with the strange disease that everybody agrees, it was strange.

03:02:05.737 --> 03:02:07.118
Malik said it was strange.

03:02:07.438 --> 03:02:08.998
Robert Malone said it was strange.

03:02:09.078 --> 03:02:10.398
Meryl Nass said it was strange.

03:02:10.458 --> 03:02:12.099
Mary Holland said it was strange.

03:02:12.979 --> 03:02:15.259
Kevin McKernan said it was strange.

03:02:15.319 --> 03:02:19.100
We've watched them all listen to them all say it in the last two weeks.

03:02:22.981 --> 03:02:27.209
They're going to flip out because their disguises are broken.

03:02:27.730 --> 03:02:29.092
Their illusion is breaking.

03:02:29.974 --> 03:02:35.785
Anybody that watches this stream or any of the other work that I've done in the last two weeks will be permanently freed.

03:02:37.472 --> 03:02:38.453
Please share this work.

03:02:39.033 --> 03:02:44.696
But the rapid tests, I like for that reason, in that they only pick up people who are really hot for the virus.

03:02:44.736 --> 03:02:46.097
And therefore, they are infectious.

03:02:46.157 --> 03:02:48.419
And you should probably, they're actionable, right?

03:02:48.659 --> 03:02:54.562
You don't end up sweeping in all of these people that have the virus in the rear view mirror, which is what we're doing with PCR.

03:02:55.743 --> 03:02:59.926
So you end up with, I think, more targeted quarantines that way.

03:03:01.166 --> 03:03:04.469
So they're frowned upon because they're new, and I get that.

03:03:04.569 --> 03:03:08.631
But I do think they're, Michael Mean is a good person to follow on this out of the brood.

03:03:08.671 --> 03:03:11.653
I think he's got his head on straight about the use of these rapid tests.

03:03:11.973 --> 03:03:13.694
For one, you can do them like in 20 minutes.

03:03:14.235 --> 03:03:17.757
And that means you can do them and maybe catch the pre-symptomatic phase.

03:03:18.458 --> 03:03:22.560
The problem with PCR is there may in fact be a pre-symptomatic window.

03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:23.561
That's still up for debate.

03:03:23.681 --> 03:03:28.224
I think the asymptomatic spread things get nullified, but the pre-symptomatic spread is a concern.

03:03:28.704 --> 03:03:29.766
That may only be a day or two.

03:03:29.806 --> 03:03:33.291
And if your PCR test doesn't get back for four days, then there's no point doing it.

03:03:34.232 --> 03:03:36.175
You'll already be symptomatic by the time you get the answer.

03:03:36.235 --> 03:03:41.022
So the rapid test can tell you right on the spot, am I pre-symptomatic?

03:03:41.643 --> 03:03:44.166
You could probably take them more than once to know

03:03:45.487 --> 03:03:49.629
Is the viral load going up or down?

03:03:49.969 --> 03:03:53.510
There are some of these tests that can give you a number, as opposed to just yes or no.

03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:58.391
And I think those are the more interesting ones, because you can tell if your signal is going up or down.

03:03:59.512 --> 03:04:06.154
So to discern between pre-symptomatic and post, the virus goes up in copy number very, very quickly in the front end.

03:04:06.654 --> 03:04:17.342
So you see a rapid change in the amount of... In copy number or is it the sub genomic RNAs that are replicating and actually very few full genome sequences are actually assembled.

03:04:17.382 --> 03:04:32.134
According to next generation sequencing, the same kind of sub genomic RNA array is produced by synthetic clones in cell culture that's produced whenever they get lucky enough to get something to grow from a sample.

03:04:33.072 --> 03:04:35.514
It's never viral competence.

03:04:35.574 --> 03:04:37.155
It's never full genomes.

03:04:37.215 --> 03:04:44.681
It's always these RNA fragments, which he's not at all saying here, at all, not even close.

03:04:45.722 --> 03:04:51.247
In a podcast where he used replication competence to refer to the RNA.

03:04:52.637 --> 03:04:55.318
RNA shot that he doesn't call transfection.

03:04:55.778 --> 03:05:10.503
I mean, if you can't see how malevolent this is and the implanted contradictions, the implanted walls, the implanted incongruencies that are always going to lead people into this little circle of bullshit.

03:05:12.805 --> 03:05:15.228
that can give you a number as opposed to just yes or no.

03:05:15.268 --> 03:05:20.094
And I think those are the more interesting ones because you can tell if your signal is going up or down.

03:05:21.236 --> 03:05:26.142
So to discern between... But predrome is exactly what James Giordano sold us.

03:05:26.182 --> 03:05:28.484
It's not asymptomatic, it's predrome.

03:05:29.065 --> 03:05:34.686
symptomatic and post, you're looking for the virus goes up in copy number very, very quickly in the front end.

03:05:35.087 --> 03:05:39.788
So you see a rapid change in the amount of RNA if you're in the pre-symptomatic phase.

03:05:40.268 --> 03:05:44.149
But it decays really, really slowly on the tail end, like weeks to months.

03:05:44.709 --> 03:05:52.411
And so you would see... He actually wants us to believe that there is a pre-symptomatic phase, but asymptomatic transmission is dumb.

03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:57.562
Talk about asking layered incorrect questions.

03:05:57.602 --> 03:06:01.784
I mean, this is an Oreo cookie of bullshit that he's throwing at us all the time.

03:06:02.184 --> 03:06:11.729
And he's not even bothering to be kind enough to give us milk to dunk it in because PCR is chocolate milk and dunking Oreos in chocolate milk is so stupid.

03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:13.851
Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense.

03:06:13.891 --> 03:06:17.597
The CT values more or less stay the same or go down if you take them two or three days apart.

03:06:17.677 --> 03:06:23.806
So the rapid ones you could accomplish that with when you do this with PCR in the turnaround time is what it is.

03:06:23.927 --> 03:06:25.850
Oreo cookies are only made of bullshit.

03:06:25.870 --> 03:06:26.390
You know that, right?

03:06:26.410 --> 03:06:27.112
There's no living

03:06:27.812 --> 03:06:29.033
organic material in them.

03:06:29.093 --> 03:06:32.614
So that's why I use it to represent Captain Synthetic here.

03:06:33.154 --> 03:06:35.715
It's only what it is because they're centralizing the testing.

03:06:35.955 --> 03:06:41.497
QPCR could do this on site in an hour, but we don't have those tools approved yet.

03:06:42.658 --> 03:06:46.719
QPCR could do this in an hour, but we don't have those tools approved yet.

03:06:47.279 --> 03:06:48.940
That's weird because the

03:06:49.540 --> 03:06:52.282
There were lots of QPCR testings being done as far.

03:06:52.362 --> 03:06:53.984
Wow, that's a weird statement.

03:06:54.044 --> 03:07:00.589
I'm just... And these things to labs that then go into some centralized lab that doesn't get you, it sits in a queue and doesn't get you an answer for three days.

03:07:00.609 --> 03:07:02.331
So you can't really do those things.

03:07:02.411 --> 03:07:08.596
You can't really take them multiple time points because the centralization is choking up the efficiency of getting the turnaround time right.

03:07:09.437 --> 03:07:20.352
So I do believe the home testing makes sense, like there's several benefits to it, is that you could take it more frequently, you'd only get alarm bells when it really mattered, and you maintain the privacy of all this.

03:07:20.733 --> 03:07:25.219
I mean, I'm really nervous that all of this QPCR data is centralized in government databases.

03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:26.801
that were just built this year.

03:07:26.821 --> 03:07:29.445
I mean, would you trust the DMV with all this data?

03:07:29.605 --> 03:07:32.108
I mean, like, what could you do with that data?

03:07:32.148 --> 03:07:34.351
I mean, to somebody like me, I'm like, I don't know.

03:07:34.391 --> 03:07:36.534
What does that mean that they have that new?

03:07:36.594 --> 03:07:44.223
Is he going to say anything about the remnants having all the details of the microbiome and all the details of the genome of everybody that got swabbed?

03:07:44.904 --> 03:07:53.776
Is he gonna say anything about the fact that the saliva test would give you your whole genome and some idea of what your microbiome might contain all from a saliva test?

03:07:54.217 --> 03:07:58.403
Is he gonna say that's what they're using or is he gonna do something else like super bullshit?

03:07:59.366 --> 03:08:00.106
Where are the odds?

03:08:00.667 --> 03:08:00.947
Ready?

03:08:00.967 --> 03:08:02.927
Hazel swab and all the information.

03:08:03.167 --> 03:08:04.848
I just worry that it's not accurate.

03:08:05.048 --> 03:08:07.949
Like how do we know that they're not manipulating the data?

03:08:09.310 --> 03:08:11.371
I'm only worried that it's not accurate.

03:08:11.551 --> 03:08:14.532
I have no worry that they'll might use it for other reasons.

03:08:14.932 --> 03:08:17.093
I'm just worried that it's not very accurate.

03:08:22.075 --> 03:08:22.475
Wow.

03:08:22.635 --> 03:08:25.116
I mean, this is just a, a, a,

03:08:26.181 --> 03:08:28.404
It's like shooting fish in a barrel with no water.

03:08:29.044 --> 03:08:29.885
They're reading it right.

03:08:30.126 --> 03:08:33.289
Who is the auditor of their spreadsheets on this stuff?

03:08:33.309 --> 03:08:37.835
They have to collect this data from hundreds of labs in their state and then present it on a daily basis.

03:08:39.276 --> 03:08:44.943
It's not something that the whole community can audit and know whether it's ever been hacked or been manipulated or changed.

03:08:45.103 --> 03:09:10.448
You know what's really interesting about this, if you start to think about it, is how many of these people, how many of these people, like, there's some, there's some interesting ones, because I think it's really interesting to think about the idea that if you look at this little diagram that I got, and you think about who these people are and what they have and haven't done, like this one right here, I couldn't, didn't recognize it because I changed the colors.

03:09:14.653 --> 03:09:34.417
But think about the fact that somebody like Charles Rixey or Kevin McCarren could easily be using these videos to show you that they think that Kevin McCarren is actually covering up the deployment of a bioweapon.

03:09:36.458 --> 03:09:37.138
But they don't.

03:09:39.329 --> 03:09:40.449
You do see that, right?

03:09:40.489 --> 03:09:47.973
That even somebody like Andrew Huff or even somebody like Robert Malone could say that you worked for the Human Genome Project.

03:09:47.993 --> 03:09:48.913
You're not to be trusted.

03:09:49.313 --> 03:09:50.674
You're just pushing a narrative.

03:09:53.535 --> 03:09:55.756
You're covering up the release of a bioweapon.

03:09:55.816 --> 03:09:59.997
Why hasn't Kevin McCairn even mentioned Kevin McKernan?

03:10:02.679 --> 03:10:08.361
Why has Stephanie Seneff been on Kevin McCairn's podcast talking about prions like three weeks ago?

03:10:10.293 --> 03:10:21.303
Stephanie Seneff, a member of the illustrious Stephen, Steve Kirsch steering committee that also this guy was a member of.

03:10:22.444 --> 03:10:30.491
Also, Stephanie Seneff, also Mark Girardeau, the bolus bozo.

03:10:33.974 --> 03:10:35.576
Who else was in that steering committee?

03:10:35.636 --> 03:10:36.577
Jessica Rose.

03:10:38.243 --> 03:10:42.105
A guy by the name of Matt Crawford is the one who actually invited me into that group.

03:10:44.746 --> 03:10:50.208
And then tried to make a big show about how Steve was ignoring his DMED data interpretation.

03:10:50.728 --> 03:10:52.429
And Steve got the DMED wrong.

03:10:52.769 --> 03:10:56.990
And then they did a podcast together where Matt was assured that he dunked on Steve.

03:11:03.133 --> 03:11:05.094
It's all too late now.

03:11:06.055 --> 03:11:10.180
They use this fake rivalry shit with me way too often since 2020.

03:11:11.982 --> 03:11:16.508
Faking, storming out of a signal chat because no one will listen to me.

03:11:17.769 --> 03:11:24.317
I'm going to make my own Bitcoin chat and teach everybody the truth about how you hold on for dear life when you buy Bitcoin.

03:11:27.247 --> 03:11:43.449
It's all one big show coordinated by the weaponized piles of money that Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Facebook and social media and crypto and locals and all these fake things.

03:11:45.541 --> 03:11:57.868
all these government-private partnerships, private-public partnerships that are working together to usurp our republics, to control, demolish America.

03:11:57.968 --> 03:11:58.949
These are all traitors.

03:12:00.010 --> 03:12:00.890
They're all traitors.

03:12:00.930 --> 03:12:10.416
And if they're not traitors, then they need to be pushed out of this group with a violent shove, and they need to apologize to us for having been in this group for four years.

03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:16.574
They need to admit that they were doing and saying some pretty stupid shit for way too long.

03:12:16.634 --> 03:12:22.619
And that means that a lot of people died because of it, because that's what I've said.

03:12:27.323 --> 03:12:36.450
And that's what anybody with any integrity would say, given the fact that we were lied to about this, that they murdered people and tried to call it a lab leak.

03:12:39.552 --> 03:12:48.935
So centralization of data that is governing people's freedom, I think everybody should stand up and take alarm to because they could be fabricating this for all we know.

03:12:49.115 --> 03:12:49.876
I don't think they are.

03:12:50.556 --> 03:12:52.116
They could be fabricating it.

03:12:52.396 --> 03:12:54.397
I don't think they are, but they could be.

03:12:54.477 --> 03:12:56.958
Well, they got to tell you the truth, man.

03:12:57.678 --> 03:12:59.259
They've got to say it at least once.

03:12:59.339 --> 03:13:00.979
Otherwise, karma will come and get them.

03:13:01.039 --> 03:13:03.580
Otherwise, the universe will be out of balance.

03:13:05.801 --> 03:13:08.602
They could be faking it, but I don't think they are.

03:13:09.318 --> 03:13:10.258
Why would they do that?

03:13:11.599 --> 03:13:13.959
RNA can definitely pandemic, I'm sure of that.

03:13:13.999 --> 03:13:15.380
I mean, I'm in the PCR space.

03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:17.440
Stop lying!

03:13:17.460 --> 03:13:21.461
I don't have evidence for it, but I think it's freedom.

03:13:21.481 --> 03:13:27.483
I think everybody should stand up and take a long too, because they could be fabricating this for all we know.

03:13:27.663 --> 03:13:35.225
I don't think they are, and I don't have evidence for it, but I think when it comes to them destroying the constitution, that maybe we should look.

03:13:36.465 --> 03:13:38.687
And that's not something that you can really do right now.

03:13:39.127 --> 03:13:41.969
You also can't really get your CQ values out of these tests.

03:13:41.989 --> 03:13:43.369
So you don't know the viral load.

03:13:44.390 --> 03:13:46.591
And that would be very, very valuable.

03:13:46.611 --> 03:13:48.892
But if there's a virus, then they're not faking it.

03:13:49.893 --> 03:13:51.434
What are they faking if there's a virus?

03:13:51.454 --> 03:13:52.675
So he's not really saying it.

03:13:52.715 --> 03:13:56.457
You see, it's like a little tiny tickle.

03:13:57.637 --> 03:13:58.398
You thought you heard it.

03:14:00.643 --> 03:14:01.064
but she didn't.

03:14:17.904 --> 03:14:23.608
DRASTIC just came together again and made one website instead of two.

03:14:23.728 --> 03:14:25.809
It used to be DRASTIC Science and DRASTIC.

03:14:26.249 --> 03:14:44.321
And Charles Rixey came to my house in Pittsburgh to try and convince me to talk about the diffuse proposal and to come back together with DRASTIC, that we would represent the Americans in DRASTIC, nevermind that the rest of DRASTIC is foreign meddlers, half of whom are anonymous.

03:14:46.545 --> 03:15:05.752
One of them offered to help me day trade with Chinese stocks on a fake Slack group that contained Yuri Dagan, the guy who blocked me out of drastic and started a new group of drastic because some of us wanted to talk about transfection as a problem.

03:15:08.533 --> 03:15:08.913
That's all 2020.

03:15:09.293 --> 03:15:10.834
That's all right here right now.

03:15:10.934 --> 03:15:14.115
I'm probably still arguing with drastic about why it is they threw me out.

03:15:15.666 --> 03:15:18.972
in 2020 for talking about transfection.

03:15:19.733 --> 03:15:26.946
That a guy who has worked for the Human Genome Project still can't call transfection and says Pfizer has done an amazing feat of manufacturing.

03:15:27.667 --> 03:15:28.349
Stop lying.

03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:33.084
called that probably were non-infectious, asymptomatic, and after CQA 35.

03:15:33.124 --> 03:15:40.411
And there's a large portion of them that are after CQA 35 that are getting whacked with quarantine that probably shouldn't be in Rhode Island.

03:15:41.151 --> 03:15:42.473
So there's a lot of value to the data.

03:15:42.733 --> 03:15:46.717
And I think part of the problem centralizing it is that nobody can put it to use.

03:15:47.758 --> 03:15:49.279
And that's a real shame.

03:15:50.569 --> 03:15:53.632
So, um, what about this antigen test that people talk about?

03:15:53.773 --> 03:16:01.261
Because people, there are a lot of people being like, I want to go give blood so that that way I can find out if I have the antigens and if I do, I'm home free.

03:16:02.259 --> 03:16:09.240
Oh, so there's a rapid antigen test, which looks for the spike protein to know that you've got, you know, full virus there.

03:16:09.461 --> 03:16:26.544
And that's the reason why I have, I started with on Bobby's podcast with the idea they could have planted the spike protein, because a lot of these rapid tests were looking for the spike protein, and he's just going to say it, and I'm going to back it up again, that if the spike protein is there, then that means the whole virus is there.

03:16:28.004 --> 03:16:30.525
The spike protein is the most abundant

03:16:32.418 --> 03:16:39.168
of any of the RNAs that are detectable by their assays in these transfections and transformation experiments in cell culture.

03:16:39.949 --> 03:16:47.459
The spike protein, the fusion protein, it is the most abundant RNA, and it is assumed to be the most abundant protein that's produced.

03:16:47.479 --> 03:16:49.222
That might not be true, but that's what he would tell you.

03:16:50.287 --> 03:16:58.813
And so what he's going to say is that it looks for the spike protein that says you have virus, but that's wrong because that's the most abundant protein.

03:16:59.213 --> 03:17:05.297
It's actually the least likely to indicate competent virus because it's going to be on empty viruses.

03:17:05.357 --> 03:17:14.684
It's going to be on all of these replication incompetent particles that Robert Malone will tell us about in a few months from this podcast.

03:17:15.179 --> 03:17:20.141
The vast majority of particles in a coronavirus infection are non-replication incompetent.

03:17:20.161 --> 03:17:20.921
They're not infectious.

03:17:20.941 --> 03:17:21.462
They don't do anything.

03:17:21.482 --> 03:17:22.242
They just float around.

03:17:25.543 --> 03:17:27.884
Antigens, and if I do, I'm home free.

03:17:28.764 --> 03:17:34.967
Oh, so there's a rapid antigen test, which looks for the spike protein to know that you've got full virus.

03:17:35.007 --> 03:17:42.510
So the antigen- It looks for spike protein so that you know that you've got a full virus, and then as fast as possible, keeps talking.

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:44.731
And that is an absolute bald-faced lie.

03:17:46.718 --> 03:17:48.419
It's an absolute bald-faced lie.

03:17:49.620 --> 03:17:55.565
The spike protein or an antigen test for the spike protein does not indicate virus at all.

03:17:56.186 --> 03:17:56.766
Not at all.

03:17:57.847 --> 03:17:58.708
But he just said it.

03:17:58.728 --> 03:18:02.871
Antigens, and if I do, I'm home free.

03:18:03.752 --> 03:18:10.357
Oh, so there's a rapid antigen test which looks for the spike protein to know that you've got, you know, full virus there.

03:18:11.377 --> 03:18:12.598
Why did he say it so fast?

03:18:12.658 --> 03:18:17.262
Because he knows it's a lie and he's ashamed for having worked for the people that are enslaving our kids?

03:18:17.362 --> 03:18:17.703
Maybe.

03:18:19.064 --> 03:18:20.285
He deserves to be knocked out.

03:18:21.586 --> 03:18:24.629
He deserves to have fruit thrown at him whenever he's in public.

03:18:24.649 --> 03:18:27.291
He deserves to be recognized by every American.

03:18:30.794 --> 03:18:32.616
He deserves to be on a wanted poster.

03:18:32.656 --> 03:18:33.957
He deserves to be on, uh,

03:18:36.414 --> 03:18:50.457
team worst case scenario like a movie poster where he's gazing off into the distance and right underneath him is Jessica Rose looking the other way and maybe a silhouette of her rapping in Geneva is the way it would be.

03:18:50.517 --> 03:18:59.919
And then Bret Weinstein standing like this with his wife in his arms and Eric Weinstein with a black umbrella and all this other shit.

03:19:01.107 --> 03:19:02.408
That would be appropriate here.

03:19:02.808 --> 03:19:06.351
Antigen tests that are looking at IgG and IgM are a bit different.

03:19:06.491 --> 03:19:09.374
Those look for what antibodies your body has produced.

03:19:09.834 --> 03:19:11.676
Those can be delayed in their production.

03:19:12.556 --> 03:19:14.458
IgM cannot even be specific.

03:19:17.654 --> 03:19:23.357
IgM can be for damage associated molecular patterns that are not specific for anything.

03:19:23.917 --> 03:19:24.897
You liar.

03:19:25.238 --> 03:19:27.218
GM comes first, IgG comes second.

03:19:27.779 --> 03:19:31.140
And they- And IgM comes first and IgG comes second.

03:19:31.180 --> 03:19:42.806
And one of the things that I was teaching for this year while he was doing it, is that there was data from Japan that showed that there was no IgM signal in any infected patients.

03:19:43.286 --> 03:19:45.127
The first signal that came up was IgG.

03:19:46.730 --> 03:20:01.316
which in my naive point of view at that time was at least enough evidence to show you that it wasn't a novel virus and that we were making antibodies in these COVID patients for previous identified damage associated molecular pattern targets.

03:20:04.386 --> 03:20:13.074
He's telling you Francis Collins' lie right here, which is that, well, what happens when you get infected with coronavirus is you make IgM and then you make IgG.

03:20:13.454 --> 03:20:14.635
But that didn't happen.

03:20:15.236 --> 03:20:16.957
And there were papers that showed it.

03:20:18.639 --> 03:20:21.782
And I actually saw these papers from Sukrit Bhakti.

03:20:22.639 --> 03:20:33.402
who explained very well why these papers indicated, from his knowledge of antibodies and the complement system, that this meant that we already had previous immunity to whatever this bullshit is.

03:20:33.802 --> 03:20:36.603
These people are lying to us about a novel virus spreading.

03:20:37.023 --> 03:20:39.623
Otherwise, there would be IgM followed by IgG.

03:20:40.063 --> 03:20:42.824
And he just lied about it right there for you.

03:20:43.124 --> 03:20:45.765
And you wouldn't know it because the immunologist

03:20:46.673 --> 03:20:48.054
Jessica Rose didn't tell you.

03:20:48.314 --> 03:20:53.177
He wouldn't know it because the guy who said he was gonna teach immunology in 2020 never did, Brett Weinstein.

03:20:53.517 --> 03:20:58.521
He wouldn't know it because Robert Malone or Meryl Nass have never been able to explain it to you.

03:20:58.641 --> 03:21:00.582
And Mary Holland's just a lawyer.

03:21:04.141 --> 03:21:05.903
But I just explained it to you right there.

03:21:05.963 --> 03:21:09.366
This might be the most damning five minutes of this whole video so far.

03:21:09.926 --> 03:21:11.087
Because he is a liar.

03:21:11.428 --> 03:21:16.933
And he is lying to you about the antibody progression of this virus because we never observed it.

03:21:18.817 --> 03:21:30.986
And if he really wanted to make his mealy mouse argument that he's been making for the last three hours in these last three videos about there being a preexisting background, this would be this zero prevalence data.

03:21:31.027 --> 03:21:36.070
And the fact that there isn't an IgM bump before the IgG bump would be perfect evidence for that.

03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.971
But is he going to do it?

03:21:39.233 --> 03:21:40.574
No, because he's a little higher.

03:21:41.792 --> 03:21:45.073
They will disappear after a month to six months.

03:21:45.253 --> 03:21:48.354
I think IgM disappears first, and IgG sticks around the longest.

03:21:49.875 --> 03:21:51.515
So those are helpful to tell you if you have the virus.

03:21:51.815 --> 03:21:58.358
The only problem with the antibody tests are that not everybody mobilizes an antibody response.

03:21:58.558 --> 03:22:01.899
In fact, I think only half the people mobilize an antibody response.

03:22:03.140 --> 03:22:07.725
You can take it and not have them and be, well, I still don't know whether I got it or didn't get it.

03:22:08.947 --> 03:22:13.092
But if you do pop positive on those, you know you had it recently, and you're probably over it.

03:22:13.172 --> 03:22:15.014
So there's some use there.

03:22:15.495 --> 03:22:17.778
What they really need to fill the hole are T cell tests.

03:22:17.918 --> 03:22:20.220
I mean, last time we spoke, we were talking about all this.

03:22:20.300 --> 03:22:22.901
We were talking about T-cell tests for four years.

03:22:23.001 --> 03:22:24.042
It's not that easy.

03:22:24.122 --> 03:22:43.955
In fact, we have a video from TWIV when Christian Anderson, the coronavirus hero guy, admitted to Vincent Racaniello and his friends that he went into T-cells, but he found it was so hard and so annoying that he decided to go into infectious disease instead.

03:22:43.995 --> 03:22:45.356
That's the truth, Ruth.

03:22:45.936 --> 03:22:49.159
T-cell immunity that was out there from prior coronaviruses.

03:22:49.700 --> 03:22:57.607
Well, they're now coming up with ways of sequencing your T-cell repertoire to understand whether or not you've built anything that could predict.

03:22:57.967 --> 03:23:08.377
And then it actually already came out in 2020, a paper which showed that and suggested that we were already having T-cells to the conserved regions of the coronavirus.

03:23:08.397 --> 03:23:08.617
You know,

03:23:10.818 --> 03:23:36.728
polyprotein 1A, 1B, and all the sub-proteins that get translated into the replication complex, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, the thing that he still hasn't mentioned, still hasn't talked about with regard to how you detect the virus or what we would make T-cell immunity to, even though somebody like Stanley Perlman actually published a series of papers in early 2000 showing exactly what targets, what epitopes, what

03:23:37.248 --> 03:23:46.776
damage-associated molecular patterns are made memory to after SARS-1, and it is indeed the polyprotein, the open reading frame 1AB.

03:23:46.996 --> 03:23:48.277
Like, come on, guys.

03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:54.522
That you've seen a SARS virus.

03:23:54.722 --> 03:23:54.882
So,

03:23:55.876 --> 03:24:02.840
Those aren't ready yet, but when they do come to market, those I think will be very helpful, because then you'll have a very complete picture of whether or not you've ever been exposed.

03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:04.861
I don't expect that to be cheap, though.

03:24:04.881 --> 03:24:11.025
I expect those will still have a fair amount of cost associated with them, because there's sequencing involved, and it probably won't be done remotely.

03:24:12.130 --> 03:24:26.135
So as coronavirus has just pounded on and pounded on, now all of a sudden there is a new invisible monster called the variant out of the UK that now is even scarier than the one before.

03:24:26.155 --> 03:24:27.555
Is that Delta?

03:24:28.035 --> 03:24:29.916
What are your thoughts on this giant invisible monster?

03:24:29.936 --> 03:24:31.576
It might as well be a Monty Python skit.

03:24:31.656 --> 03:24:38.098
That's such an embarrassing association that they've made that I hope someone goes to jail for.

03:24:38.118 --> 03:24:39.219
That's ridiculous.

03:24:40.339 --> 03:24:41.160
It fully debunked.

03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:45.683
Nobody, no one in the field believes that variant is more transmissible or more virulent.

03:24:45.723 --> 03:24:49.246
In fact, there's evidence that it's less virulent because it's missing ORF8.

03:24:50.707 --> 03:24:52.909
So, ORF8 is a region.

03:24:53.249 --> 03:24:59.734
Oh, so they were tracking certain parts of the virus because open reading frame eight was missing from the new variant.

03:24:59.854 --> 03:25:00.355
Interesting.

03:25:00.835 --> 03:25:05.119
So while they were tracking certain things, they didn't bother to track the fear and cleavage site.

03:25:05.139 --> 03:25:07.200
They didn't bother to track the AIDS inserts.

03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:09.322
They didn't bother to track any of the

03:25:09.802 --> 03:25:11.564
molecular overlap, the mimicry.

03:25:12.064 --> 03:25:33.606
None of these dissidents that are supposedly coming to our rescue with all this knowledge, like Judy Mikovits or Kevin McCairn or Charles Rixey, that have all these spreadsheets and done all this reading, thousands of hours of work, none of them have bothered to track the epitopes that they say are responsible for this being an obvious bioweapon.

03:25:36.147 --> 03:25:44.910
Even though apparently in the sequencing they're watching for all these open reading frames disappearing and reappearing, they're not keeping track of the stuff that's the most indicative of a lab leak.

03:25:44.930 --> 03:25:46.130
That's kind of strange.

03:25:46.751 --> 03:25:47.171
I don't know.

03:25:47.451 --> 03:25:48.551
Or stupid.

03:25:49.232 --> 03:25:50.032
Or fake.

03:25:50.452 --> 03:25:54.393
The genome that one has deleted ends up being a less virulent form of the virus.

03:25:54.633 --> 03:25:58.095
And that variant happens to be in phase with ORF8 deletion.

03:26:00.496 --> 03:26:07.818
We're not finding, even the pro-lockdown epidemiologists, which I do follow on Twitter, just always know what they're thinking.

03:26:09.359 --> 03:26:10.579
Even those folks are yelling.

03:26:10.619 --> 03:26:17.702
He keeps plugging following people on Twitter, that the debate is happening on Twitter, the discussion is happening on Twitter.

03:26:18.102 --> 03:26:27.006
And four years later, we're still being told that Elon Musk is the only one fighting for free speech on Twitter, even though he simultaneously seems to be turning over

03:26:27.506 --> 03:26:36.569
everybody's ID information to an Israeli firm and forcing everybody to ID themselves if they want to be making money on his platform.

03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:51.933
Can you imagine a scenario where we already knew that there was going to be an orchestrated buyout of Twitter, that Elon Musk was going to be elevated to a crusader of free speech?

03:26:53.356 --> 03:26:54.596
that he would already know it.

03:26:54.676 --> 03:27:00.397
And that's the reason why Vance mentioned a Peter Thiel paradox out of nowhere.

03:27:00.417 --> 03:27:08.379
And if you start to see it that way, it starts to become pretty clear what's happening, doesn't it?

03:27:09.739 --> 03:27:16.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it is three hours and 23 minutes in, and I'm going to take a giant break.

03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:18.361
And that means I won't be back until tomorrow.

03:27:20.734 --> 03:27:24.896
I don't want to be unclear about what I'm suggesting.

03:27:25.036 --> 03:27:28.398
I do not want to be unclear about what I am claiming.

03:27:28.578 --> 03:27:30.820
I want to be very clear about my message.

03:27:33.781 --> 03:27:35.162
I don't want to pull any punches.

03:27:43.627 --> 03:27:49.570
I think these people and maybe some of the ones in yellow are part of a national security operation.

03:27:50.339 --> 03:27:59.047
that was orchestrated by weaponized piles of money that are running traitors in our government at all levels.

03:28:00.208 --> 03:28:05.973
And it doesn't take very many people to sabotage a tug of war and for nobody who's actually trying to know.

03:28:07.335 --> 03:28:13.580
Just like it doesn't take much to sabotage a tug of war and have some people really pulling in earnest

03:28:14.386 --> 03:28:22.231
Like maybe Dell, like maybe Brian Hooker, like maybe this lady from NIVC, NVIC.

03:28:23.512 --> 03:28:28.675
Maybe some of these people, maybe even Senator Ron Johnson is really trying to pull.

03:28:31.716 --> 03:28:33.578
But these people are not.

03:28:35.219 --> 03:28:39.041
These people, I am sure, are part of a limited spectrum of debate.

03:28:40.799 --> 03:28:44.180
that is designed to control, demolish America, and they're off their timeline.

03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:48.042
They needed longer to convince us to blow ourselves up, to tear ourselves apart.

03:28:49.403 --> 03:28:54.885
And so they are trying to adapt to the place that we are, and they're not doing it very well.

03:28:54.945 --> 03:29:02.228
And I think it's gonna get worse and worse as I continue to grind, because there's nothing to do about this.

03:29:03.374 --> 03:29:08.395
I'm using their own words, their videos of their own words and comparing them what they said then to now.

03:29:09.055 --> 03:29:11.156
And they're revealing themselves as the liars.

03:29:13.496 --> 03:29:18.457
Because we have the entire context of the pandemic recorded live on the internet.

03:29:19.437 --> 03:29:20.578
And they haven't deleted it yet.

03:29:22.198 --> 03:29:23.878
So it's just work that has to be done.

03:29:24.858 --> 03:29:27.099
And no one else seems to want to do it, so I'll do it.

03:29:27.930 --> 03:29:28.730
And I'll keep doing it.

03:29:29.371 --> 03:29:48.460
And I ain't never gonna stop until my children are effectively clear of this, that my grandchildren are effectively clear of this, that your grandchildren are effectively clear of this, because it is absolutely, absolutely important that we understand that they are misleading the young on purpose and that they have coordinatedly done it.

03:29:49.965 --> 03:29:59.630
It is absolutely important to understand that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, and these people are covering that up.

03:29:59.730 --> 03:30:07.094
It is absolutely important to understand that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and these people are covering that knowledge up.

03:30:07.474 --> 03:30:10.956
It is absolutely important to acknowledge that RNA cannot pandemic.

03:30:10.976 --> 03:30:13.417
We don't have any good biological evidence for it.

03:30:13.877 --> 03:30:21.084
And these people are a part of a coordinated campaign of lying to make sure that murder is never revealed as the real story.

03:30:21.565 --> 03:30:24.768
Ladies and gentlemen, please share this stream wherever you can.

03:30:25.208 --> 03:30:30.434
Stop transfection in everyone that you love and even those people that aren't with us yet.

03:30:31.134 --> 03:30:34.657
because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

03:30:35.357 --> 03:30:36.898

And that's what these people have actually helped me to provide, which is all these subscribers.

03:31:00.013 --> 03:31:00.734
Thank you very much.

03:31:01.576 --> 03:31:07.023
I really appreciate everybody who stayed the length and Who is here every day?

03:31:07.043 --> 03:31:11.048
Love you guys Love you guys
