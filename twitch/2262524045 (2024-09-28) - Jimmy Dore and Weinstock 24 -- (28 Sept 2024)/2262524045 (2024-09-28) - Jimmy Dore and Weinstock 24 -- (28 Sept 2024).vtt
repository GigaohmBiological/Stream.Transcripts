WEBVTT

00:20.443 --> 00:39.095
Stop lying!

00:39.936 --> 00:40.756
Stop lying!

00:58.487 --> 00:59.228
Stop!

01:19.088 --> 01:22.091
Brother Spoon, this is gonna be one of the best shows I've ever done.

01:23.453 --> 01:25.375
So good you clicked on the notification.

01:25.415 --> 01:26.276
Thanks for joining me.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.263
My master asks for you to draw a map of the world.

01:33.844 --> 01:33.965
Oh.

01:37.468 --> 01:37.789
Thank you.

01:59.282 --> 02:02.364
This is the limit of what I know.

02:04.985 --> 02:05.686
The Earth is round.

02:06.186 --> 02:08.408
Like a fruit.

02:13.191 --> 02:14.392
Japan is here.

02:15.272 --> 02:18.554
My country, England, is on the other side of the world.

02:18.574 --> 02:21.736
We came by way of Magellan's past.

02:30.520 --> 02:35.303
We are the first outsiders to use it because the Spanish and the Portuguese kept it secret.

02:39.786 --> 02:42.648
And for us, it was safer to sail this way.

02:44.949 --> 02:48.951
Because we had to avoid the Portuguese base in Macau.

03:00.017 --> 03:01.278
It employs Japanese mercenaries.

03:02.938 --> 03:03.939
I'm told you call them Ronin.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.761
A secret Catholic fortress, used for gun-running.

03:08.241 --> 03:10.002
Employed during an uprising some years ago.

03:10.022 --> 03:14.084
Ronin is employed in the secret hideout where the guns are used.

03:14.104 --> 03:15.184
That gun was used illegally.

03:15.284 --> 03:20.467
Is it an illegal act against the Emperor?

03:20.927 --> 03:21.427
I'm not sure.

03:21.487 --> 03:22.788
I'll send Anjin a detailed map later.

03:29.831 --> 03:37.475
My master asks that later, you write this map and mark the Portuguese bases.

03:38.196 --> 03:39.456
If I may, I will explain now.

03:44.519 --> 03:46.700
This is the way Portugal and Spain carved up the new world.

03:47.881 --> 03:51.723
Seventy years ago, they signed a treaty that split undiscovered land between them.

03:51.803 --> 03:55.985
Your country falls into the Portuguese half.

03:58.247 --> 03:58.907
So it belongs to them.

04:00.532 --> 04:00.892
I'm sorry, sir, but...

04:28.993 --> 04:30.735
I assure you, their arrogance is unbelievable.

04:31.936 --> 04:32.396
Please tell him.

04:33.097 --> 04:34.278
It's written into legal documents.

04:35.339 --> 04:42.386
Each Spanish and Portuguese king has the right to lay claim to any non-Catholic land they discover and to replace its government with Catholic rule.

04:42.507 --> 04:43.107
This is a lie.

04:44.849 --> 04:45.049
No.

04:47.832 --> 04:48.953
Do you swear by your God?

04:50.214 --> 04:50.735
Yes, I do.

05:13.482 --> 05:28.051
Oh The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge in the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America, I don't know

05:28.763 --> 05:35.486
crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of our what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know.

05:37.047 --> 05:55.955
But I know for sure that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to healthcare to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

05:58.092 --> 06:04.838
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

06:05.258 --> 06:08.301
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

06:08.381 --> 06:17.829
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

06:17.869 --> 06:24.455
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

06:31.169 --> 06:31.531
Bye.

06:58.001 --> 07:04.423
A world become one of silence and sun, only a fool would say that.

07:04.684 --> 07:11.886
A boy with a plan, a natural man, wearing a white Stetson hat.

07:12.166 --> 07:22.070
And had that God be gone, there's no one too far upon, if he's holding his

07:42.714 --> 07:49.396
Man in the street, dragging his feet, don't want to hear the bad news.

07:50.016 --> 07:58.839
Imagine your face, there in his place, standing inside his brown shoes.

07:59.119 --> 08:03.540
You do his nine to five, drag yourself home

08:15.865 --> 08:20.790
Talking about a world where all is free.

08:21.011 --> 08:28.178
It just couldn't be, and only a fool would say that.

08:28.399 --> 08:31.402
Anybody on the street has mercy.

09:32.671 --> 09:34.772
It's a bit silly to think about all this.

10:01.604 --> 10:03.527
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

10:04.628 --> 10:09.375
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

10:10.797 --> 10:12.560
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

10:14.102 --> 10:14.863
It's embarrassing.

10:33.072 --> 10:34.493
Good morning, everybody.

10:34.513 --> 10:37.194
It is 10.30 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:37.214 --> 10:39.875
I'm happy to be here again with you on a Saturday morning.

10:40.476 --> 10:46.099
We've got a lot of work to do, as I've been trying to express on the few shows that I have done this week.

10:46.759 --> 10:50.121
Your consciousness is the prime real estate they are definitely playing for.

10:50.141 --> 10:52.062
This month is going to be really important.

10:52.642 --> 10:56.084
And this weekend, there's some really interesting shenanigans going on.

10:56.124 --> 10:58.285
It's a gathering of charlatans, if you will.

10:59.045 --> 11:03.609
and I think it's important to preempt it and that's what this show is trying to do today.

11:04.610 --> 11:08.914
I do have the microphone turned up just a little bit higher so I can use less voice.

11:09.014 --> 11:09.795
I hope that works.

11:11.596 --> 11:14.279
We need to take the power back from these charlatans.

11:14.979 --> 11:17.381
We actually inherited this situation so we can't.

11:17.882 --> 11:20.264
Our parents, you know, they didn't know any better either.

11:20.324 --> 11:21.825
That's the reason why

11:23.291 --> 11:23.951
We got here.

11:24.171 --> 11:29.873
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

11:30.333 --> 11:34.694
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

11:35.074 --> 11:37.314
Viruses are not pattern integrities.

11:38.075 --> 11:43.316
We have to make sure that we dispel this mystery virus idea before our children are away.

11:44.556 --> 11:54.618
We really got to make sure that we understand that it was murder and lies and there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and we still don't really have a lawyer who wants to teach us anything useful.

11:56.479 --> 12:05.520
I really am excited about our show today because we are going to edify these ideas and we're going to do it really, really, really well.

12:06.401 --> 12:07.881
This illusion of consensus

12:08.834 --> 12:14.256
this new kind of totalitarianism curated by these acolytes.

12:14.296 --> 12:22.179
We're gonna break that today, or at least we're gonna take another good shot at it because these weaponized piles of money have definitely convinced us.

12:23.340 --> 12:27.742
They have gotten us to argue with them and they are governing us this way.

12:27.802 --> 12:29.922
That's what social media is doing for them.

12:30.563 --> 12:34.044
If you wanna know who you're talking to, I'm a recovering academic.

12:34.204 --> 12:38.006
I used to be a molecular and cellular neurophysiologist.

12:38.706 --> 12:47.369
You can see my publication record on PubMed, and yeah, the name of this broadcast comes from the methodology I used to use.

12:47.970 --> 13:00.415
There's a long list of reasons why you should be listening to me about these people, and I'm not gonna spend a lot of time trying to convince you of that, but this is a list that you can pause and you can check and you can read.

13:01.636 --> 13:06.267
and question why it is that none of these other people can claim a list like this.

13:07.590 --> 13:08.672
That's really the problem.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.478
That's really what my problem is.

13:11.978 --> 13:21.966
If you want to help out, if you want to find out where you've been or what you stumbled upon here, go to stream.gigaohm.bio, that big address there.

13:22.046 --> 13:25.870
You can find our PeerTube channel there where the rebroadcast will be.

13:25.910 --> 13:30.013
You can find Eclipse channel that is curated by Jeff from Earth.

13:30.654 --> 13:33.096
You can find my calendar and you can download it.

13:33.156 --> 13:36.058
It's a calendar that I'm going to start following if at all possible.

13:36.098 --> 13:37.499
You can find the links to the

13:38.300 --> 13:52.593
The coursework that we're doing here in Biology 101 just started a couple weeks ago, and the introductory lectures are over with, and we're about to dig in deep to the following books there, which are free to download, including Probability Theory by James.

13:53.834 --> 13:59.219
And so if you're following those two things on Tuesday and Thursday, I'm really excited, because it's going to go real quick now.

14:00.141 --> 14:04.793
And there's also an archive, of course, of significant videos that I've found interesting.

14:04.833 --> 14:08.101
And of course, Mark Kulak, Housatonic Live also has a channel.

14:09.511 --> 14:15.516
at stream.gigaohm.bio, and so you can find another mirror of his latest work there.

14:15.776 --> 14:18.718
And so I've been working very hard on this.

14:18.938 --> 14:19.979
Ted works hard on it.

14:20.500 --> 14:27.725
And it's just a good way to archive my work with no algorithms, no other nonsense in your way.

14:28.526 --> 14:31.128
And that's what stream.gigaohm.bio is.

14:31.168 --> 14:37.633
If you want to support gigaohmbiological.com, welcome, welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

14:37.673 --> 14:38.454
Welcome to the show.

14:40.107 --> 14:47.950
I'm gonna fade this music out here and see if we can't make some useful progress into understanding.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.992
So let me just... I think we're getting a transmission.

14:57.012 --> 14:58.853
Just let me switch over here, say good morning.

15:00.374 --> 15:01.614
Make sure this is in focus.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.615
It looks not so great.

15:08.356 --> 15:09.697
There we go, that's a little better I think.

15:09.717 --> 15:11.519
A little soft still.

15:13.140 --> 15:15.282
It's hard for me to focus that camera from behind the desk.

15:16.521 --> 15:20.184
I don't know how this is gonna work out here underneath with all the names and stuff like that.

15:20.204 --> 15:24.026
I'm trying to find ways to thank the people who are subscribing, who are donating.

15:24.086 --> 15:27.589
If you don't see your name there, it might be because you missed it or because it's not there.

15:27.609 --> 15:32.032
I'm still curating that list and figuring out who I need to put on there.

15:32.052 --> 15:45.501
I also recently announced that the website where you can put your email in in any number of boxes actually has been collecting all of those emails and putting them in a place that I didn't know or didn't realize existed until a couple days ago.

15:46.161 --> 15:53.783
That means starting next week, if the pattern holds, I should be able to send you an email whenever I'm planning to go on a few hours beforehand.

15:53.823 --> 15:58.944
Maybe even with a link to the downloads that I'd like you to see before the lecture.

15:58.984 --> 16:01.425
And so it's going to be a really exciting upgrade.

16:01.905 --> 16:04.226
I've never really had a uniform way of doing that.

16:04.706 --> 16:07.127
And I never really wanted to limit it to subscribers only.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.287
And so it has

16:09.188 --> 16:11.650
I think it's going to add something very interesting.

16:11.810 --> 16:16.054
I actually missed the captain coming in there on the screen.

16:17.335 --> 16:19.356
I'm going to play a video up in that corner.

16:20.781 --> 16:25.244
If you can see my mouse here, I'm going to play a video up there in the corner.

16:25.845 --> 16:38.373
It's so small because I don't want to give the person any more screen time or advertisement than they already got from Senator Ron Johnson.

16:39.774 --> 16:43.336
If you're unaware about where we are, this is going to be a very long show.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.818
There's no really way to avoid it.

16:47.449 --> 16:49.693
My voice has been recovering over the last week.

16:49.753 --> 16:52.078
My voice may crash out again in this stream.

16:54.741 --> 16:59.343
But for now it feels like it's going to be okay and so I'm going to take a shot at the fence.

16:59.963 --> 17:04.945
Every once in a while I try to hit a home run stream and I think this one could be it or one of them.

17:06.025 --> 17:13.908
It's just one of those, you know, I try to throw a ladder as deep as I can into the cave every once in a while in hopes that there's still some people down there.

17:14.488 --> 17:17.910
Really, really, really several layers below, several floors below.

17:18.770 --> 17:22.513
that are still looking for a way out, and if they saw a ladder, they might climb it.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.735
And so that's what this stream is all about.

17:25.576 --> 17:43.730
And in order to start throwing that ladder down, I thought I'd throw a ladder down to the people who were, in one way or another, taken or bamboozled by the recent Senate hearing that was put on by Senator Ron Johnson about food and nutrition, and where all these new

17:46.926 --> 17:49.107
people were introduced to us.

17:49.527 --> 18:04.994
And one of the more curious new people that was introduced to us as Americans in our American Senate by an American senator from Wisconsin is some chick from another country named Michaela.

18:05.615 --> 18:08.216
And I'm just gonna play this video for a little while

18:09.338 --> 18:21.628
The thing that I'd like you to pay attention to in the beginning of the video is the absolutely spectacular endorsement that Michaela is able to garner from a U.S.

18:21.708 --> 18:23.669
Senator in the U.S.

18:23.729 --> 18:24.069
Senate.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.171
in a videotaped U.S.

18:27.251 --> 18:35.876
Senate like distributed video of her and is able to promote herself speaking in the U.S.

18:35.936 --> 18:40.678
Senate and being endorsed and and introduced by a U.S.

18:40.778 --> 18:52.004
Senator so that her social media standing and and and perceived importance

18:53.706 --> 19:02.569
It's what I am about to play for you as an American, you should be really upset with Senator Ron Johnson.

19:03.690 --> 19:17.575
The idea that Senator Ron Johnson has regularly put foreigners in front of an American, a part of the American government, even if it's just a side room that nobody's really paying attention to,

19:19.963 --> 19:32.574
The idea that there aren't Americans that deserve a microphone, that there aren't Americans that can represent these ideas and speak in the buildings of the American government is just absurd.

19:32.614 --> 19:47.687
The idea that we need a, I don't even know what I would characterize her as, but she's not someone who lives in a reality that the rest of us do in small town America or whatever.

19:49.995 --> 19:56.656
Um, I I'm just, I'm having a hard time introducing the whole idea because it is that absurd.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.177
Sorry, captain.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.837
You're not, you're not going to want to watch this.

20:00.877 --> 20:02.557
This is really, this is really bad.

20:02.737 --> 20:05.958
Most people don't know that what they're consuming is making them sick.

20:06.118 --> 20:11.719
They know junk food is bad, but they don't realize it's causing chronic disease and neither do their healthcare providers.

20:13.579 --> 20:17.320
Our next presenter is Michaela Peterson Fuller.

20:18.363 --> 20:18.503
Ms.

20:18.523 --> 20:28.026
Fuller is a podcaster, lifestyle and diet blogger, the co-founder and CEO of Peterson Academy, and the founder of Fuller Health and the Lion Diet.

20:28.687 --> 20:35.429
The Lion Diet is a therapeutic and plant-free ketogenic diet that can be used to treat autoimmunity and psychiatric disorders.

20:36.109 --> 20:41.371
On the Michaela Peterson podcast, she discusses health, cultural phenomena, politics, and other topics.

20:41.691 --> 20:41.831
Ms.

20:41.851 --> 20:42.151
Fuller.

20:44.272 --> 20:45.152
Thank you very much.

20:45.172 --> 20:47.573
I'm going to skip my intro.

20:51.372 --> 20:56.878
When I was two, I started to limp, and at seven I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

20:57.499 --> 21:05.507
So at two she started to limp, and at seven she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease.

21:06.989 --> 21:13.556
And nowhere in this diatribe is she going to suggest that it might have been a childhood vaccine that did it to her.

21:14.721 --> 21:24.048
But she is going to claim that her unique lion diet, which is just basically a carnivore diet, has cured her of all of her problems that she's going to list for the next 10 minutes.

21:24.868 --> 21:29.712
Because it's so hard to be this Canadian girl.

21:31.249 --> 21:40.593
with a father in the intellectual dark web, with a father who's been on every media platform in the world, with a father who's selling books.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.434
It's really hard to be her.

21:43.494 --> 21:50.036
It's so hard to be her that Senator Ron Johnson thought it was appropriate to bring her into the U.S.

21:50.056 --> 21:55.118
Senate and let her represent, I guess, represent Americans.

21:55.759 --> 21:56.099
I don't know.

21:58.732 --> 22:05.514
for her to sit in the same square of tables as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:08.535 --> 22:19.478
To get the same seven or eight minutes with which to speak to the American people, to the American government, and into the government's record.

22:25.819 --> 22:27.860
Do you understand how ridiculous that is?

22:30.356 --> 22:34.159
I don't know who it is that did it, Senator Ron Johnson maybe.

22:34.179 --> 22:40.223
I don't know who did it, but it doesn't make any sense to me why any of these foreigners need to be there.

22:42.184 --> 22:43.705
And certainly not that child.

22:47.353 --> 23:01.743
certainly not Jordan Peterson, who after in the middle of 2020 admitted that he had no special insights into the pandemic because he's just a psychologist who's as lost as the rest of us in psychological disarray.

23:03.064 --> 23:16.213
And yet Senator Ron Johnson thought it would be appropriate for that guy with no principles, that foreigner with no principles, who told us to wear the masks and take the shot and get it over with, his appropriate to have there with his daughter,

23:17.878 --> 23:30.301
And it's appropriate for a senator in the United States Senate from Wisconsin to endorse her social media websites, to actually say them out loud and to endorse her diet as curing things?

23:34.942 --> 23:35.682
Stop lying!

23:39.603 --> 23:40.804
You see where I'm going with this?

23:40.824 --> 23:42.044
This is a real big problem.

23:43.339 --> 23:51.544
Because all of these people are involved in the rescue, the republic, join the resistance, unity party bullshit.

23:53.085 --> 23:55.966
And I will use the word bullshit throughout this stream.

23:56.107 --> 23:56.867
I'm very sorry.

23:57.547 --> 23:59.489
No other swear words will be used.

23:59.589 --> 24:00.649
Captain, it's okay.

24:01.210 --> 24:02.650
I won't turn on that video anymore.

24:02.690 --> 24:03.051
Don't worry.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.514
We have a very big problem on our hands.

24:09.775 --> 24:11.856
I hope Bobby said something more useful.

24:11.876 --> 24:14.257
I hope Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:14.317 --> 24:15.398
I shouldn't call him Bobby.

24:16.158 --> 24:17.319
I don't know him that well.

24:18.319 --> 24:19.780
I hope Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:19.840 --> 24:27.804
said something more useful in that meeting than Michaela Peterson Fuller or Jordan Peterson.

24:32.959 --> 24:41.612
First of all, I want to thank you again, Senator Johnson, and Senator, thank you for coming, and all the other political leaders I've seen come in and out.

24:41.872 --> 24:45.637
I'm very grateful to them for finally paying attention to this issue.

24:46.730 --> 24:50.271
I spent kind of 40 years in this space.

24:50.751 --> 24:59.014
I'm going to escape for a second and just start the slide deck over, just in case it's having a little trouble with memory here.

24:59.134 --> 25:02.736
I've got Michaela's video playing up in the background over here.

25:02.756 --> 25:06.657
I don't even know if it really adds anything, but I just thought I'd have that there, so it makes it a little harder.

25:06.697 --> 25:09.438
First of all, I want to thank you again, Senator Johnson.

25:09.938 --> 25:11.279
Senator, thank you for coming.

25:12.399 --> 25:15.320
and all the other political leaders I've seen come in and out.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.401
I'm very grateful to them for finally paying attention to this issue.

25:20.461 --> 25:33.325
I spent kind of 40 years in this space, and for most of that time, the Democratic Party was the party that was fighting this issue.

25:34.757 --> 25:40.825
And today, it's been a complete inversion, and it's now the Republican Party generally.

25:41.906 --> 25:51.698
But I would say the appeal that I would make to Americans is that there is no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children.

26:01.047 --> 26:15.912
Over the 20,000 generations of human beings that have lived on this planet before us, the primary biological drive and spiritual drive has been to make sure that their kids were safe.

26:16.972 --> 26:29.616
And it's extraordinary today that these profit-making corporations have used their capacity to control our government and to control the media

26:30.629 --> 26:34.812
to turn us all against that most fundamental biological drive.

26:35.413 --> 26:43.579
We are destroying our kids, and we're doing it because we're being manipulated to do it through all of the institutions of government.

26:44.780 --> 26:52.286
And as an environmental activist attorney, it was obvious to me... Go do that somewhere else.

26:53.087 --> 26:57.911
And whenever you see the commoditization of the environment of human beings,

26:59.755 --> 27:03.936
There is always a subversion of democracy that is coterminous.

27:05.136 --> 27:06.297
And that's what we've seen.

27:07.357 --> 27:25.161
We've seen all of these institutions, the media, the health agencies, the agricultural agencies, the American press, the medical system, twisted to turn against their fundamental mission.

27:26.258 --> 27:29.660
and our country is supposed to be the exemplary nation in the world.

27:29.680 --> 27:33.843
In 1776, between then and 1792, we became the first democracy in modern history.

27:34.043 --> 27:34.543
By 1860, there were

27:48.343 --> 27:51.724
five democracies that were all based on the American model.

27:51.884 --> 27:54.444
By the time my uncle was president, 130.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.065
By the end of the 1960s, 190.

27:57.145 --> 28:01.506
And all of them were looking to us as a model.

28:02.826 --> 28:14.409
And we have now become the worst country in the world on the key metric by which every success in a nation can be measured.

28:15.632 --> 28:20.433
which is are we giving our children a chance to live better lives than we do.

28:21.353 --> 28:28.294
And is you know our country to me is still the greatest country in the world.

28:29.555 --> 28:31.635
And we have an extraordinary resilience.

28:32.715 --> 28:35.756
We have the worst agricultural practices in the world.

28:36.936 --> 28:42.517
We have the best regenerative farmers the best organic farmers the best

28:43.456 --> 28:46.016
dry land agriculture, no-till agriculture.

28:46.056 --> 28:48.237
We're at the cutting edge of all of those things.

28:48.317 --> 28:53.278
So we have that entrepreneurial spirit that is still alive in our country.

28:54.398 --> 28:58.319
We have the worst healthcare system and the worst health outcomes in the world.

28:59.479 --> 29:04.640
We have the best functional medicine doctors, the best integrative medicine doctors.

29:04.780 --> 29:08.821
All the cutting edge work on those issues is being done in this country.

29:10.228 --> 29:15.232
We have some of the worst business practices in a declining economy.

29:16.433 --> 29:19.595
We have the best entrepreneurs in this country, of any country in the world.

29:20.496 --> 29:23.819
So we have this inherent resilience in our country.

29:24.379 --> 29:33.166
And if we can, as somebody mentioned, I said, we need to stop hating each other.

29:34.307 --> 29:38.770
And that's only going to happen when we start loving our children.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.053
more than we hate each other.

29:41.434 --> 29:46.476
And when that happens we're going to be able to recover and very very quickly.

29:46.736 --> 29:54.038
And so I'm optimistic about it despite this dark cloud that has been portrayed here tonight.

29:55.279 --> 30:01.661
You know we could over the next two decades encounter terrible crises in this country.

30:02.762 --> 30:03.142
We could

30:04.793 --> 30:08.435
We could experience economic collapses from many factors.

30:08.495 --> 30:14.979
We could have other pandemics, other wars, and it could really devastate our country.

30:16.020 --> 30:21.123
As long as we have that resilience, we're always gonna bounce back as Americans.

30:22.423 --> 30:25.485
We're not gonna do that if our kids all have chronic disease.

30:26.426 --> 30:28.167
It's too much of an anchor on progress.

30:29.170 --> 30:48.083
If you have a child that's dependent on pharmaceutical medications for the rest of their lives, that is weakened, demoralized, dispirited, disheartened by these illnesses, it's going to inhibit our capacity to function in any meaningful way in the world.

30:49.204 --> 30:55.588
If a foreign nation did this to our country, we would consider an act of war.

30:56.529 --> 30:57.690
It is un-American.

30:58.345 --> 31:06.049
These companies have been allowed, through the profit motive, to destroy everything that we value in America.

31:06.849 --> 31:10.111
And this is not just economic warfare.

31:10.131 --> 31:11.832
It's not just chemical warfare.

31:13.033 --> 31:15.514
We're all involved in spiritual warfare.

31:18.277 --> 31:35.881
And we have to understand that the core of people who are here today, the leaders who have convened this, the leaders from all of these different groups, all of them, the medical profession, healthy foods.

31:36.901 --> 31:38.982
You mean like Michaela Peterson?

31:39.442 --> 31:41.102
You mean like Jordan Peterson?

31:41.382 --> 31:42.442
A reason for hope.

31:43.323 --> 31:44.863
And they're leading a battle.

31:45.785 --> 31:48.208
do for the heart and the soul of our country.

31:48.549 --> 31:50.011
Come on, Robert.

31:50.151 --> 31:53.015
And that's something we all need to understand.

31:53.035 --> 32:02.869
The American Revolution started with a very, very small core of activists who were able to articulate these new set of values

32:03.960 --> 32:07.483
And they did something that nobody in the world could believe.

32:08.344 --> 32:16.150
A ragtag group of people brought to its knees the greatest empire in the history of mankind.

32:17.231 --> 32:29.101
We can take our country back from these industries and we can restore not only our democracy and the integrity of it, most important of all, we can begin restoring our children's health.

32:35.782 --> 32:36.943
So that's pretty extraordinary.

32:37.123 --> 32:45.649
The reason why I leave us on the spaceship is because you got to really feel that we're somewhere very, very strange right now.

32:47.150 --> 32:50.873
You should almost feel like every time you go on social media, you're like Captain Kirk.

32:50.913 --> 32:54.035
You walk into the room and you're kind of like, what in the hell's going on in here?

32:54.075 --> 32:55.296
And you just kind of back out.

32:57.237 --> 32:59.179
The door opens of social media.

32:59.199 --> 33:01.981
You walk in, you look around, you go, how did it get this far?

33:02.161 --> 33:03.502
And I was just here.

33:05.950 --> 33:23.413
I mean, two weeks ago, we would have never guessed that there would be another Senate hearing, this time about food and the environment and toxins, that would barely mention the vaccine schedule and have a whole bunch of new people that just recently decided to go into book writing or into podcasting.

33:26.254 --> 33:34.155
Even Jordan Peterson and his daughter, who aren't even Americans, were invited and given time, equivalent to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:35.580 --> 33:41.025
a guy whose uncle was president and dad, they were both killed.

33:41.806 --> 33:43.868
He got seven minutes and so did Michaela.

33:51.936 --> 33:53.958
So I gotta really tell you, I think, uh,

33:55.424 --> 34:00.608
I think it's important that we talk frankly about what's going on here.

34:00.648 --> 34:03.591
And I think we need to talk about it very, very clearly.

34:03.891 --> 34:05.492
I guess I don't need to be that small yet.

34:08.615 --> 34:10.316
These people are playing us.

34:11.537 --> 34:21.325
And unfortunately, it is my belief that they have been set up and have been playing us for a very, very much longer time than the last few years.

34:22.646 --> 34:24.788
That a lot of these people were put in place

34:28.393 --> 34:40.303
maybe even five or eight years before the pandemic, because again, the people that run this show knew that this increase in all cause mortality was coming because of all the kids that were born after World War II.

34:41.564 --> 34:46.688
They knew there was gonna be a decade long increase in all cause mortality that would eventually go away.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.792
And so what better, natural,

34:52.512 --> 35:12.069
way to use such an increase in all-cause mortality than to tell a story that would benefit public health and the national security state, the global security state, the global public health security state that wants to get above these pesky nation states

35:15.151 --> 35:18.612
and take away the strongest power in the world, which is nationalism.

35:19.172 --> 35:27.795
People love to fight and believe in flags and fight for the dirt that they like to fight for the dirt.

35:32.136 --> 35:42.959
And so that's a real big problem from the perspective of the globalists, the perspective of the people who are running the show, the people whose mentors have read these books and understand them.

35:44.468 --> 35:55.813
They are interested in taking control of our evolution as a species, and they have identified that our species, like fish, swim in groups in the water.

35:57.774 --> 36:00.855
Humans swim in groups of thought.

36:03.570 --> 36:10.612
And so if we're going to take control of our evolution as a species, we need to take control of our collective way of thinking.

36:10.692 --> 36:22.536
We need to come together under a new, more unified idea of how to think about ourselves as a species and how we as individually fit into that model.

36:23.037 --> 36:29.059
And what these guys think is that there should be some really smart people who actually run that thing.

36:29.099 --> 36:32.900
And the rest of the other people, they're not smart enough to even know.

36:36.621 --> 36:37.822
And they need to be governed.

36:39.583 --> 36:43.426
And since time immortal, we have been governed.

36:43.706 --> 36:52.972
And in the last few decades, the idea of how we're going to govern the globe has become sort of the focus of things.

36:53.533 --> 36:55.394
That's where all these people are coming from.

36:55.454 --> 36:57.996
That's what all these people are thinking about.

36:58.036 --> 37:01.038
That's why those are the books that we're starting with in Biology 101.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.220
Because we need to start to understand how

37:06.206 --> 37:23.699
The sacred irreducible complexity of biology has been really just, it's been twisted, it's been simplified, and our fidelity of understanding it has been exaggerated.

37:25.905 --> 37:27.366
so that we're at the precipice.

37:27.446 --> 37:36.554
We're really at the precipice of having people like that group of people in the Senate tell us about how great creation is and how much we should worship creation.

37:36.594 --> 37:38.215
And don't you ever hear that in me.

37:39.776 --> 37:42.038
Because yes, I am a biologist.

37:42.098 --> 37:54.188
And yes, I claim since I was a kid to be able to look outside and go, wow, it's just all one thing, one system, one creation.

37:56.203 --> 38:12.465
There's no other way to see it other than evidence of a creator and have it inspire a level of humility that fundamentally dictates the way you go about your life and whether you're a servant to those around you or not.

38:13.789 --> 38:26.640
If you can see creation for the beauty that it is, for the irreducible complexity that it is, for the sacred in front of your eyes that it is, then being a servant to everyone around you comes naturally.

38:28.541 --> 38:30.463
Worshiping your creator comes naturally.

38:30.543 --> 38:32.625
Seeking your creator comes naturally.

38:35.667 --> 38:39.090
And the people who say that the COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020,

38:41.289 --> 39:03.289
pretending to kind of have similar ideas but they will tell you to worship creation that the Sun is awesome and that mother nature is awesome or scary and that mankind has a responsibility to take control of whatever levers are available because you know it's ours it's us

39:10.598 --> 39:14.342
And so there's a very easy way to see that they knew that this was coming.

39:14.382 --> 39:32.519
You can research this and you can find out across the Western world, there was actually a potential for some very serious problems because again, weaponized piles of money knew that a decade long increase in all cause mortality was coming and they've known it for several decades.

39:33.803 --> 39:40.187
because they've also been involved in decreasing family size since the 80s or since the 70s.

39:40.747 --> 39:46.470
By decreasing family size, they have created this phenomenon by themselves.

39:49.412 --> 39:51.293
After World War II, big families.

39:52.515 --> 39:57.701
After about 10 years of big families, the governments around the Western world decided, whoa, this isn't good.

39:58.102 --> 40:00.124
We better decrease the size of families.

40:00.184 --> 40:08.013
Not much that dissimilar happened in China, where before the one-child policy, what did they have?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.094
They had big families.

40:09.234 --> 40:11.938
And so they have a very similar inverted

40:13.223 --> 40:22.264
population pyramid with a five to 10 year long spike in deaths and in old people and in end of life care.

40:26.499 --> 40:30.601
And so what better way and what easier way to coordinate this?

40:30.661 --> 40:33.302
They all agree that they all had this problem.

40:33.342 --> 40:35.403
The Chinese have the same problem we did.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.264
That's why they have a one-child policy.

40:38.324 --> 40:40.325
Wake up and apologize to your kids.

40:40.885 --> 40:42.886
We should have been talking about this since 2020.

40:42.946 --> 40:53.011
This is the fact that they have inverted to call COVID-19 and a pandemic.

40:54.383 --> 40:56.445
and they inverted it by murdering people.

40:56.945 --> 41:11.719
They inverted it by scaring people, confusing people, and putting financial incentives in, or group pressure incentives in, or social pressures into the social media that we have acquiesced to using.

41:13.686 --> 41:27.813
and coerced hundreds of thousands of people into taking a transfection, coerced thousands of people into hospitals thinking that they had a novel virus, coerced thousands of doctors into treating people thinking they had a novel virus.

41:30.534 --> 41:37.017
And so there's potential for a lot of people to wake up and apologize, wake up and realize, oh my gosh, I really made a mistake.

41:39.118 --> 41:42.780
Because had I known that all the people that govern me

41:43.718 --> 42:02.844
knew that there was gonna be a sustained 10-year increase in all-cause mortality and just were gonna sweep a few together using ventilators and supplementary oxygen and lack of a feeding tube or too high a pressure in a ventilator to sweep a few together to create some peaks.

42:04.184 --> 42:09.606
And then say on the PBS NewsHour using a very disingenuous graph down here,

42:12.540 --> 42:15.662
to illustrate that there was something novel happening when it wasn't.

42:15.723 --> 42:24.970
It was just an expected increase in all-cause mortality and vulnerable old people and a little military action to sweep them together.

42:26.761 --> 42:31.583
a little sustained misinformation on social media to sweep them together.

42:31.623 --> 42:40.085
And at the same time, of course, they were able to convince us that there is a lab leak and they might be covering it up.

42:40.145 --> 42:43.306
Tony Fauci might've even funded it.

42:43.486 --> 42:46.887
And for four years, we argued about whether they were covering this up.

42:47.007 --> 42:54.890
People are still arguing about it on the town square on X about whether or not emails are still revealing

42:56.109 --> 43:05.614
And this is the Scooby-Doo mystery that I've talked about for a couple years now, that everybody wants to forget is such an apt analogy because that's exactly how we are being governed.

43:06.194 --> 43:15.799
And it is specifically our ubiquitous use of social media that has made us so vulnerable to being governed by liars and by lies that they tell together in groups.

43:17.500 --> 43:24.724
There's nothing more effective than four people sitting around a table agreeing or arguing and then agreeing.

43:25.799 --> 43:32.825
to convince the people that are passively listening that something has been solved, that they learned something, that a question has been answered.

43:32.865 --> 43:41.392
And these are the tools of fifth generation warfare that Robert Malone purports to be saving us from, but is actually a very integral part of.

43:41.412 --> 43:47.978
2020 is the code for healthy vision.

43:49.098 --> 43:51.701
It is also the year we were given the eyes to see.

43:54.517 --> 43:58.298
Today, the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the liars at the levers.

43:58.318 --> 44:01.298
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

44:01.318 --> 44:04.979
They are masters of deception, hell-bent to divide and conquer.

44:05.019 --> 44:06.359
Some radicals on the far right.

44:06.399 --> 44:08.360
It's not just the far-left wackos.

44:08.580 --> 44:13.741
Like magicians, they use the art of redirection to keep us distracted as they trick us.

44:14.981 --> 44:18.742
Nearly every war we have fought was initiated by their propaganda.

44:18.962 --> 44:23.123
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant.

44:24.289 --> 44:29.151
As their empire of lies is collapsing, they are becoming increasingly desperate and dangerous.

44:31.252 --> 44:48.539
Now what we're supposed to believe is that this guy's really interesting voice where he says that he's trying to save everybody by whispering very quietly into the mic is somebody who's getting away with something that the global governance system in the United States government doesn't want him to get away with.

44:49.349 --> 44:59.192
Just like Whitney Webb is releasing all kinds of information that the United States government doesn't want her to release, but because she lives in Chile, she's able to do it.

45:02.253 --> 45:05.514
She's able to get on every podcast at any podcast she wants to.

45:05.574 --> 45:13.076
She repeats everything as if she's memorized it all, but she omits a lot of things.

45:13.176 --> 45:14.517
She never says the Vatican.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.781
She never says DITRA.

45:18.022 --> 45:26.788
She doesn't really work very hard beyond Epstein, Maxwell, Epstein, Maxwell, Maxwell, Epstein.

45:29.249 --> 45:38.976
And Mickey Willis made music videos with Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits in the same video in 2021.

45:41.417 --> 45:55.648
He made music videos with all of these intellectual dark web associates that have been in all of the international news media, including Australian news, Great Britain news, UK news, European news.

45:55.748 --> 46:07.397
Those people haven't been so prominent except for maybe on Tim Poole's podcast every once in a while, but they're doing, you know, tie wearing appearances on Australian news representing America.

46:10.168 --> 46:17.936
Just like Robert Malone and Pierre Kory and Meryl Nass have been all around the world for four years representing America.

46:17.976 --> 46:25.363
They're all with Mickey Willis and these people who are running the Rescue the Republic.

46:25.403 --> 46:28.546
That's what this video is, a Rescue the Republic trailer.

46:30.668 --> 46:33.531
With the real video, you know, like there's trying to save us.

46:37.366 --> 46:39.867
The three nations are seeking to strengthen ties.

46:39.887 --> 46:43.308
The alliance has been formed to chill us all to the bone.

46:43.528 --> 46:46.589
Their reckless war games have united a deadly alliance.

46:47.610 --> 46:53.952
Everything we have fought for, everything we've earned, and everything we love is under attack.

46:53.992 --> 47:00.574
Terror suspects at the southern borders... At what point do we say enough is enough?

47:04.085 --> 47:08.130
Now is the time for the American people to wake up and rise up.

47:09.111 --> 47:12.315
A rebel alliance is forming in the name of liberty and life.

47:12.856 --> 47:20.084
People of every color, culture, creed, and ideology are putting politics aside to secure the eight pillars of peace and freedom.

47:25.091 --> 47:38.628
So Russell Brand is a foreigner, Jordan Peterson a foreigner, Charlie Kirk has been around the world, Zuby is a foreigner around the world, Tulsi Gabbard is WEF, Brett Weinstein is

47:40.253 --> 47:43.994
well, from my personal experience, is one of the worst traitors and liars of all.

47:45.074 --> 47:52.617
Laura Logan is part of the show that Senator Ron Johnson has been putting on for four years now.

47:53.157 --> 48:00.019
He put on the first Senate hearing where Pierre Corey got to go in front of the Senate and tell him how bad New York was.

48:00.099 --> 48:07.321
Robert Malone, of course, is the team leader of these people who seeded the mystery of the

48:07.941 --> 48:20.347
the gain-of-function lab leak, the Scooby-Doo, and also seeded all the narratives of repurposed drugs and whatnot that allowed us not to usefully question the pandemic in the beginning.

48:20.387 --> 48:27.651
Jimmy Dore, I think, is actually just being suckered by these people, just like it's possible that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:27.691 --> 48:27.731
is.

48:29.189 --> 48:31.633
I think it's less likely that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:31.693 --> 48:32.695
is being suckered in.

48:33.356 --> 48:39.786
But Jimmy Dore could very well be fooled by these people, and that's why I chose his...

48:40.882 --> 48:55.676
his interview with Brett Weinstein about this weekend to feature in this study hall because I still have the hope that Jimmy Dore is somebody that they are having need of playing.

48:55.756 --> 49:00.681
They need to control him because if he figures it out, he will gladly turn on them.

49:01.351 --> 49:09.857
And so they needed to go on his show, and they needed to tell him how funny he was, and they needed to control the narrative in his head on his show.

49:09.877 --> 49:11.138
That's why they've all been there.

49:11.558 --> 49:13.400
And that's why he's here now, I think.

49:13.460 --> 49:15.481
And so this is a message for Jimmy Dore.

49:17.643 --> 49:19.244
I really want Jimmy to see this.

49:19.364 --> 49:22.026
This is potentially the end of the West.

49:22.266 --> 49:22.566
Oh, wait.

49:23.947 --> 49:27.890
Sorry, I didn't play the rest of that, which is unfortunate, because it's actually really good.

49:32.737 --> 49:36.801
Now is the time for the American people to wake up and rise up.

49:37.762 --> 49:40.966
A rebel alliance is forming in the name of liberty and life.

49:41.506 --> 49:48.834
People of every color, culture, creed, and ideology are putting politics aside to secure the eight pillars of peace and freedom.

49:50.015 --> 49:52.678
End the weaponization of science and medicine.

49:53.058 --> 49:56.480
If there is risk, there must be choice.

49:56.780 --> 49:59.561
Cease the expansion of surveillance and propaganda.

49:59.721 --> 50:03.003
They are killing us with censorship and propaganda.

50:03.343 --> 50:05.524
Stop central bank digital currencies.

50:05.604 --> 50:09.827
That will allow them to punish us from a distance and cut off our food supply.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.468
Prevent political abuse of our judicial system.

50:12.608 --> 50:17.530
What we are demanding is in fact the restoration of the rule of law.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.171
Secure our national borders.

50:19.531 --> 50:24.774
I'm tired of the United States doing nothing to protect the American people.

50:24.874 --> 50:26.335
Protect our children.

50:26.555 --> 50:30.176
To defend our children and to save an entire generation.

50:30.376 --> 50:32.357
Restore critical thinking in education.

50:32.558 --> 50:35.779
I think that the time for change is now and enough is enough.

50:36.099 --> 50:39.601
And above all, break our addiction to war.

50:39.901 --> 50:47.232
The nuclear threat is an emergency of the highest order, and we are all in the crosshairs of this emergency.

50:48.567 --> 50:56.190
We must set aside our differences, work together to fire those warmongering politicians from both political parties.

50:56.571 --> 51:03.894
Everybody from the left, everybody from the right, everybody from the middle coming together to realize that we have more in common than divides us.

51:04.034 --> 51:08.296
What unites us is so much stronger than anything that divides us.

51:08.536 --> 51:09.717
We're a country of love.

51:10.077 --> 51:11.797
We're a country that care about people.

51:12.038 --> 51:15.659
The one thing that brings us together here today is that we value life.

51:24.932 --> 51:32.674
Every single principle on which the West is based is under simultaneous threat.

51:33.554 --> 51:35.715
We must defend the West.

51:39.476 --> 51:40.956
So that's pretty extraordinary.

51:40.996 --> 51:42.837
And now I'm just going to play an interview.

51:42.917 --> 51:44.357
These are all from this week.

51:46.518 --> 51:49.639
And I get goosebumps from this stuff because these people are creeping me out.

51:50.305 --> 51:52.546
But this is all from this week.

51:52.866 --> 51:55.308
Bret Weinstein was on the high wire about a week ago.

51:55.528 --> 51:56.328
That's what this one is.

51:57.329 --> 51:59.970
This is potentially the end of the West.

52:01.337 --> 52:02.158
It's now or never.

52:03.079 --> 52:06.382
This is, in my opinion, absolutely urgent.

52:07.363 --> 52:13.029
People's fancy rationales for staying on the couch and not voting because they don't think their vote counts.

52:13.469 --> 52:14.511
This is no time for that.

52:14.791 --> 52:23.580
This is no time for what I have done in past elections, which is, you know, to vote my conscience and vote for people that I knew would not be elected.

52:24.255 --> 52:25.516
There is a time and a place for that.

52:25.596 --> 52:27.496
I do not believe this is the time and the place.

52:28.037 --> 52:37.501
This is the moment at which we have to defeat whatever that force is that has taken over our system and targeted all of our rights.

52:39.181 --> 52:43.543
We are in a better position than Europeans are because our constitution is

52:47.386 --> 52:47.966
better thought out.

52:49.948 --> 52:54.090
We are kind of last on the list from the point of view of degradation of our rights.

52:54.591 --> 53:05.378
This is the moment to realize that whatever our ideological differences may be, are completely unimportant if we lose the republic, right?

53:05.818 --> 53:16.365
If we are to fight about the differences between what conservatives and liberals see, it has to be after the republic has been put back on a course with a future to it.

53:18.393 --> 53:26.156
It's really important to understand that there is no explanation for Brett Weinstein's rise to prominence except fake.

53:27.556 --> 53:42.021
It is a planned social media based elevation of someone to be a thought leader because of his connections and his family connections and whoever he knows because it is not for his

53:43.149 --> 54:08.506
Insight or for his heart or for his generosity for his humility It is because some weaponized pile of money or piles would like him to be Or think that he might be a decent shepherd of of sheep and They don't need a lot of these people

54:10.174 --> 54:13.035
Robert Malone doesn't need to be known to everyone.

54:13.256 --> 54:16.257
Robert Malone isn't known to most of the people on my street.

54:16.617 --> 54:17.918
Neither is Brett Weinstein.

54:18.498 --> 54:26.502
These people are who social media gives to anybody who the algorithm detects needs answers.

54:28.603 --> 54:30.624
The algorithm can see if you care.

54:31.667 --> 54:33.868
The algorithm can see what you care about.

54:33.988 --> 54:55.901
And if you care about getting answers to real questions, then you will find Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone, Jordan Peterson, any number of these people, Tim Truth, whoever happens to catch you when the algorithm starts serving you those things that will put you over there in that limited spectrum of debate curated by those people.

54:57.247 --> 55:08.111
But if you don't tell the programmers of social media that you're interested in those questions, then social media will never serve those things to you because that's not how the programming works.

55:11.332 --> 55:14.573
Most people don't know who Dell BigTree is, again, for the same reason.

55:15.674 --> 55:21.216
You must go looking for it in order for the social media programming to give it to you.

55:23.016 --> 55:24.877
And that is not censorship.

55:26.499 --> 55:28.220
That is fifth generation warfare.

55:32.521 --> 55:34.282
And so we can't let them get away with this.

55:35.082 --> 55:40.825
We must force them to talk about 2020 and we gotta force them actually to talk about things before 2020.

55:41.625 --> 55:42.305
That's what I think.

55:44.486 --> 55:53.890
If we don't get them to talk about what happened during 2020, you won't be able to see after five years how ridiculous it is that all of these people

55:54.927 --> 56:00.946
and their associates that are called the rescue to the republic join the resistance.

56:02.031 --> 56:23.433
clown show, are responsible for the narratives about repurposed drugs, about the spike protein, about the fear and cleavage site, about HIV inserts, about gain of function, about lab virus leaks, about databases deleted, about amyloid and prion, about neurological effects like going up the olfactory nerve and mitochondrial damage.

56:23.573 --> 56:24.854
All of these stories

56:25.922 --> 56:51.111
were seeded early in the pandemic, not by biologists with special insight because they've been reading, but by meddlers that were previously put in place before the pandemic and then given these nuggets of the narrative and told to run with it, told to write a sub stack, told to write a book, told to focus on this and you will rise in social media and then they did.

56:53.857 --> 57:06.641
And if you look back at these people's track record, you will see that there is no explanation that involves censorship or, you know, the spontaneous rising of good information.

57:08.842 --> 57:11.723
This is what they planned to do.

57:11.843 --> 57:20.466
This is what Mark Van Ranst lamented that he couldn't have done in 2009 because he didn't have the social media reach that's available in 2019.

57:23.632 --> 57:41.820
What you should see here, if you're thinking carefully and deeply about a national security state operation that has always known that the vaccine schedule was a criminal enterprise, what you should see is a narrative that was seeded with the expected outcomes for transfections to new proteins.

57:47.043 --> 57:49.324
Because that's what this list is.

57:51.215 --> 57:58.418
It is a list of expected outcomes if they started to transfect people to novel proteins.

58:00.859 --> 58:03.140
And of course, they planned to do this all along.

58:03.220 --> 58:13.324
Joshua Lederberg, Kevin McKernan, and his dad, you know, all of these people at the Human Genome Project have always known that without

58:13.979 --> 58:25.846
human genetic information in mass and the ability to collect it, monitor it, sample it, over and over and over again, they had no hope of cracking anything.

58:27.507 --> 58:37.373
And more importantly, in order to understand how to manipulate our physiology, the most basic thing they could imagine doing is transfecting anyone, expressing a protein somewhere.

58:37.393 --> 58:39.294
They've been trying it for decades.

58:42.591 --> 58:59.504
And so if they were going to roll that out as a methodology and pretend that it was rushed so that they could fix it and get everybody to accept the methodology, I'm telling you that they planned already a long time ago to tell you that the old vaccine schedule was bad.

59:01.004 --> 59:13.468
And that's why they put these people in place, so that they could titrate the speed and the calendar and the time frame in which they told you these things, so that they could use it to control, demolish America.

59:15.348 --> 59:16.188
And maybe the West.

59:20.150 --> 59:24.371
And so this narrative was told because they knew that they were planning to say, well,

59:25.690 --> 59:26.911
the adenovirus sucked.

59:26.991 --> 59:28.052
So we pulled that off.

59:28.092 --> 59:29.953
So we were, we pulled that off the market.

59:29.973 --> 59:31.634
So we were definitely being honest with you.

59:31.674 --> 59:35.117
And now years later, we're finding out that, you know, we rushed it.

59:35.177 --> 59:36.598
And so there's DNA in there.

59:36.638 --> 59:39.100
And we got these people that tell you that there's DNA in there.

59:39.140 --> 59:47.946
And then if we just get the DNA out and we test the untested vaccine schedule in five years, we could have really good vaccines.

59:52.062 --> 01:00:11.373
Now you might think that's a little bit weird prediction, but I made that prediction in 2021 when they started rolling out nature papers about how the investigation of genetics and mRNA were actually in parallel with the development of lipid nanoparticles to make a vaccine all along or something like this.

01:00:12.133 --> 01:00:20.218
And it suddenly dawned on me that what they're planning on doing is replacing the vaccine schedule and eventually admitting that the old vaccine schedule wasn't tested.

01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:26.424
and that this new vaccine schedule based on mRNA would be tested.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:41.075
And so that's why somebody with such familiarity with the technology that you're trying to fool people about would need to be involved from the very beginning.

01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:47.920
In fact, involved for many decades before and leading up to the start of the pandemic.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:53.668
And quite frankly, they never expected to get so far off script.

01:00:53.728 --> 01:00:58.230
Otherwise he would have never opened in 2021 with Ditra and Domain.

01:01:00.612 --> 01:01:14.200
He never would have opened with I'm an outbreak specialist, a private consultant, a vaccine tech broker and an inventor of genetic vaccines and been so cocky had he not already known that he was on a script and that everyone was on a script.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.101
And therefore there was nothing to worry about.

01:01:16.921 --> 01:01:18.102
They were risking nothing.

01:01:22.571 --> 01:01:33.643
That's why when they went on the Brett Weinstein podcast, they were so, it was in retrospect is so silly that they were still arguing in 2021 about zero COVID being a realistic goal.

01:01:34.043 --> 01:01:38.588
And that they all agreed that endemic was the worst case scenario.

01:01:38.748 --> 01:01:39.569
Interestingly,

01:01:40.575 --> 01:01:50.864
Even before the pandemic, everybody agreed that if there was a lab leak, if there was a bat cave virus, the worst case scenario would be endemicity.

01:01:50.904 --> 01:01:56.568
They even said it in a documentary on CNN in 2019 that we watched together.

01:01:57.389 --> 01:01:59.771
And it was that journalist Garrett who said it.

01:02:01.773 --> 01:02:06.797
That endemicity in one of these outbreaks is what you really want to avoid.

01:02:09.468 --> 01:02:23.521
And that's a real inconvenient word because it's very, very difficult to differentiate endemicity from a background if you have no data from before 2020.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.003
It's almost impossible.

01:02:27.093 --> 01:02:43.216
to differentiate a virus that came out of a bat cave or was spilled in a mud puddle and then went around the world for five years to become endemic, it's almost impossible to differentiate between this signal and a previously existing background signal that you just weren't testing for before 2020.

01:02:45.576 --> 01:02:47.557
And all of these people know that.

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:50.417
Kevin McKernan knows it.

01:02:50.797 --> 01:02:52.217
The no virus people know it.

01:02:52.657 --> 01:02:53.798
Tony Fauci knows it.

01:02:54.598 --> 01:02:55.838
David Baltimore knows it.

01:02:58.277 --> 01:02:59.697
Joshua Lederberg would have known it.

01:03:01.138 --> 01:03:02.478
Hilary Koprowski would have known it.

01:03:02.538 --> 01:03:04.479
I bet you Margaret Hamburg knows it.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:14.842
And so I am going to take off this for a second so you can see this a little better.

01:03:17.643 --> 01:03:19.884
Why oh why won't anyone?

01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:22.005
Somebody's been asking me for a summary here.

01:03:22.748 --> 01:03:24.209
So I thought I'd give you a summary.

01:03:24.249 --> 01:03:28.292
You can see the pink line is in 2024, we're in our fifth year of this show.

01:03:28.933 --> 01:03:35.778
Why oh why won't anyone tell you or discuss how a background signal could be misconstrued as spread?

01:03:36.459 --> 01:03:40.622
That would be the endemic versus background idea, because we weren't testing before 2020.

01:03:41.063 --> 01:03:47.988
But also the actuarial part, you know, the part about the fact that they knew there was gonna be a decades long increase in all cause mortality.

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:49.850
So if they had a background signal,

01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:53.563
and they had a background expected signal.

01:03:54.884 --> 01:04:07.632
It's very strange that none of the people that are coming to our rescue on white horses have ever been able to articulate any of these ideas and that the only people who are articulating these ideas are people who watch this show or Mark's show.

01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:09.834
Strange, right?

01:04:10.234 --> 01:04:12.215
Because it's a pretty easy thing to discuss.

01:04:12.776 --> 01:04:20.321
Even Denny Rancor, when I was on the Levine show with him and asked him about this actuarial

01:04:21.377 --> 01:04:24.439
underlying cause where, you know, they expected more people to die.

01:04:24.479 --> 01:04:29.703
So they could have just swept a few together with a military operation and called it a pandemic.

01:04:29.763 --> 01:04:34.447
Since there's no epidemiological evidence of spread, according to Dennis, that would make sense.

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:36.669
And he said, nah, they couldn't do that.

01:04:41.472 --> 01:04:49.659
Later on in that same interview, he said that this was all part of a dominance hierarchy and that the CIA bossed all of these people around.

01:04:54.773 --> 01:05:05.977
These people will also not list and define the many ways the methodologies of PCR can be applied to assure highly accurate results that were not used for SARS-CoV-2.

01:05:07.157 --> 01:05:21.682
And the list is really very long that Kevin McKernan or Jessica Rose or Kevin McCairn or any of these people with some biological background before the pandemic could have easily explained to you multiple amplicons, nested primers,

01:05:26.437 --> 01:05:29.861
None of these things were used in the context of COVID diagnostics.

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:43.659
And then nevermind what they focused on or what part of the genes they focused on, any of these things, nothing is discussed except for false positives, you know, and cycling too far.

01:05:46.616 --> 01:05:48.357
These are all just lies.

01:05:49.277 --> 01:05:53.258
And it's very easy to explain from an academic biologist perspective.

01:05:53.278 --> 01:05:57.700
There are ways to make PCR almost ridiculously accurate.

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.702
It also makes it so accurate that the only signal you get is a true one.

01:06:02.742 --> 01:06:12.405
And every lower signal, you might miss a lot of things the way you use PCR correctly on an academic bench.

01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:14.690
and any of these people could explain it.

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:22.897
So we'll not list and define the ways that even in its purest form possible the mRNA products would have never been appropriate for use in healthy humans.

01:06:22.978 --> 01:06:24.399
None of these people are going there.

01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:28.082
They're all going now to the double-stranded DNA contamination.

01:06:28.182 --> 01:06:28.722
None of them

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:32.005
We'll talk about the RNA smear.

01:06:32.685 --> 01:06:34.687
None of them will talk about the fragments.

01:06:35.307 --> 01:06:49.076
None of them will talk about even if it was pure, it would still result in expression across and throughout the body in random places, which is not good because the immune system can't possibly solve all those puzzles without making an error.

01:06:51.598 --> 01:06:55.080
None of those things are discussed anymore by any of these people.

01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:57.102
It's sad, it's the COVID shots are terrible.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.463
Turbo cancer.

01:06:59.585 --> 01:07:09.890
They will not define the countermeasures as transformations, that's the adenovirus, and transfections, that's lipid nanoparticle plus the mRNA, but they still won't do it after five years.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:12.751
They still won't say that we just, we had names for these.

01:07:13.891 --> 01:07:18.353
Because if they said that, then you would realize that all of them engaged in this

01:07:21.845 --> 01:07:29.752
in this malevolent narrative curation that effectively removed your ability to engage informed consent.

01:07:33.035 --> 01:07:40.001
And that's why it's so lame that Brett Weinstein says things like, I think it's really important for informed consent.

01:07:41.062 --> 01:07:48.369
You, he, they were part of the confusion, the fear and the uncertainty and doubt and the bad information

01:07:49.585 --> 01:07:53.267
that led to no one being able to exercise informed consent.

01:07:53.347 --> 01:07:58.390
And this, number four, would have been enough for anybody to exercise informed consent.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:02.792
Hey, by the way, these are already things that we've used in mice and in monkeys for a long time.

01:08:03.353 --> 01:08:09.096
Transformations using adenovirus, transfections using lipid, like lipid, like lipofectamine.

01:08:09.136 --> 01:08:10.076
We've done this already.

01:08:11.097 --> 01:08:12.678
But nobody could say it but me.

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:21.903
And they will not define the term infectious clone as transformation and transfection in cell culture and animals being misconstrued as virology.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.006
Do you see?

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:33.797
the no virus people could steal number five and they could run with it and say, you know, the only virology that these people do is just transfection and transformation and cell culture and animals.

01:08:34.317 --> 01:08:36.099
And Jonathan Cooey has been right about that.

01:08:36.139 --> 01:08:45.810
But that was, that was the letter that I wrote on behalf of CHD to the no virus people, trying to get everybody to come together under one banner, understanding

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:54.736
that the National Security State and the Human Genome Project people and all these molecular biologists are essentially lying to us about RNA fidelity.

01:08:55.777 --> 01:09:03.423
And they're doing it in the literature using the term infectious clones and synthetic DNA and RNA and they won't say it.

01:09:04.284 --> 01:09:05.504
None of them will say it.

01:09:05.524 --> 01:09:14.291
And they also won't say that RNA can't pandemic because it's too clever.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:17.686
It's too acidic.

01:09:18.467 --> 01:09:21.429
It dissolves all the other bad ideas around it.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:31.235
This list right here is the proof that you need to see that these people are not saving our grandkids.

01:09:32.976 --> 01:09:42.141
They are part of a limited spectrum of debate that has been titrating this narrative for five years, and that's why they are all part of this Republic thing.

01:09:45.031 --> 01:10:01.134
These people are responsible for it and many many more That's what this is social media and these acolytes are

01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:13.652
have prevented these fundamental ideas about the irreducible complexity of our biology from making it to general knowledge, common knowledge.

01:10:13.712 --> 01:10:19.636
They have prevented it on purpose because they aren't trying to score this touchdown.

01:10:19.696 --> 01:10:29.763
Mary Holland has had this language in her hands since they hired me for the book, since they hired me after the book at CHD.

01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:37.556
Brian Hooker has had these words in his hand and in his mind and available to him.

01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:42.377
If he ever wanted to say them, credit to me or not, he could have said them, but he hasn't.

01:10:42.817 --> 01:10:50.579
They're being very careful not to say them because these phrases absolutely dismantle the narrative that they have been curating.

01:10:50.619 --> 01:10:57.861
The narrative of a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions more were saved from that could come again because gain of function is real.

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:13.180
And so yes, I have seen that Mike Yeadon has kind of already joined the no virus team, or at least endorses their book.

01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:28.871
And I have seen that he's given a hat tip to Jonathan Engler, who, if you will recall, wrote the worst virology review in 2024 ever, and that Jessica Hockett tried to get me to write that with him.

01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:42.891
They pretended that they understood or wanted to understand what I was trying to say with infectious clones being a semantic game that they play in the virology literature, but they wouldn't.

01:11:44.612 --> 01:11:45.752
Panda members wouldn't.

01:11:46.012 --> 01:11:48.092
Jessica Hockett's not smart enough.

01:11:48.132 --> 01:11:49.452
I guess she's not a biologist.

01:11:50.053 --> 01:11:57.534
And Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal wrote a multi-page substack about virology, basically saying that

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.965
Virology is kind of real, but not really, whatever.

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:03.466
Jonathan Couey's got this one silly idea.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:20.353
It was not characterized well and was not cited well and not explained well at all as the acidic parsimonious explanation for most of what we have experienced.

01:12:21.454 --> 01:12:22.254
We can hit it all.

01:12:24.744 --> 01:12:27.466
And so I don't know what to say about Mr. Sparkle.

01:12:27.506 --> 01:12:28.326
I'm worried about him.

01:12:28.346 --> 01:12:45.958
This is another guy that I'd like this message to get out to because he doesn't have any reason to ignore that the virology in the literature is almost exclusively the application of synthetic DNA and RNA to cell culture in animals, which is transformation and transfection.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:48.880
He has no reason to ignore that.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:13:10.693
He also has no reason to ignore that the same pharmaceutical manufacturing techniques that would be used to make that DNA and used to make that RNA could be used to make the DNA and RNA sequences that we are told represent the ongoing circulation of a novel pathogen that is going endemic as we speak.

01:13:12.435 --> 01:13:23.343
He has no reason to ignore that we can't decide between an endemic background that just appeared and an endemic background that was always there if we have no data from before 2020.

01:13:25.765 --> 01:13:35.813
But somehow it does feel like he's ignoring it and going out of his way to promote somebody that I know to be a liar.

01:13:40.202 --> 01:13:57.547
He also defends Claire Craig, of course, the cancer biologist, the 100,000 Genomes Project person from the UK and co-chair of HEART, who told us that PCR testing during the pandemic was something like food, you know.

01:13:58.168 --> 01:14:02.169
You can get fast food or you can get good food, but you can't get fast good food or something.

01:14:04.414 --> 01:14:22.298
So that was, of course, we're in 2024 right now, but if we go back 10 years and we go back to 2015, of course, Mary Holland and Paul Offit were already established as anti-Vaxxer and Vaxxer, bad guy, good guy.

01:14:23.899 --> 01:14:30.680
And Paul Offit already held Mary Holland's name in his mouth several times on a Democracy Now!

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.641
broadcast in 2015.

01:14:35.011 --> 01:14:42.677
where this limited spectrum of debate was already being defined by these people, where it might be a specific component of the MMR vaccine.

01:14:43.197 --> 01:14:47.401
Not all vaccines are dangerous, just the MMR, because that's the one that hurt Mary's kid.

01:14:50.363 --> 01:15:03.273
Imagine a day, perhaps, when my grandchildren had children of their own, when the threat of cancer is a distant memory, when their children can be vaccinated for cancers as routinely as we vaccinate for measles and mumps.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:08.562
and other cancers can be treated and cured, made into chronic conditions.

01:15:09.643 --> 01:15:26.128
So that was 2016, just one year later after Mary Holland made her public debut as a anti-vaxxer and Paul Offit officially acknowledged her as an anti-vaxxer voice on a podcast that everybody sees.

01:15:28.812 --> 01:15:34.057
And so then a year later, of course, you know, this guy's been working for a decade already.

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:49.490
He's knee deep in it, doing interviews in front of big backdrops like Contagious Infectious Disease Today, working for DITRA and NIH, private broker of vaccine technology for years as an outbreak specialist for Zika, Ebola, SARS, MERS.

01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:50.070
That's 2017.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.131
Interestingly, a year later,

01:15:54.005 --> 01:16:04.029
The real Event 201 takes place, which was a meeting in Hong Kong featuring all these people who would be involved in the mRNA product in 2019.

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:08.031
All of them presenting about a pandemic with coronaviruses.

01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:12.173
You can find the real Event 201 linked on on Hucytonic's website.

01:16:14.014 --> 01:16:17.876
They're not going to talk about that because they want you to think about the Event 201 that happened in 2019.

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:31.278
Of course we can go back to 2016 and we can see that this guy got a book, this James Lyons Wyler dude, The Environmental and Genetic Causes of Autism.

01:16:31.318 --> 01:16:41.327
An interesting thing about this book that I have is that it has a Stephanie Seneff recommendation.

01:16:43.385 --> 01:16:50.687
on the top of it, which I'm very curious about because I think Stephanie Seneff is another one of these people who's not playing a good game.

01:16:51.227 --> 01:16:52.447
I don't think she's a good guy.

01:16:53.507 --> 01:16:56.568
Otherwise, she would never be on a program with Kevin McCarron.

01:16:56.648 --> 01:17:00.369
Otherwise, she would not have served in Steve Kirsch's steering committee.

01:17:00.509 --> 01:17:05.790
Otherwise, she would not be on this book and having made no progress for 10 years.

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:19.939
likely she is curating the Monsanto and glyphosate space, making sure that no useful progress is made there.

01:17:19.999 --> 01:17:33.788
She also curates part of the prion debate because she was the prion expert that John Bodwin chose to have with me and Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose.

01:17:38.306 --> 01:17:41.248
on March 17th, 2023 for a St.

01:17:41.288 --> 01:17:59.337
Patrick's Day stream where Kevin McCairn dropped his pants, fell to the ground, and cried in his underwear because he tried to bring up a few papers about XON1 and about how there's proofreading in coronaviruses.

01:17:59.857 --> 01:18:00.778
And I dunked on him.

01:18:01.798 --> 01:18:04.780
I dunked on him by reading the paper before

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:14.325
the meeting and knowing that Mark Dennison already said that, yeah, they have proofreading, but when they have this protein, they have a lot more recombination.

01:18:14.425 --> 01:18:22.729
And if you know anything about viral genetics, then all the models that they use predict that recombination is very seldom useful.

01:18:22.749 --> 01:18:32.855
I think you can kind of imagine that if you stopped in the middle of one book and started in the middle of another book, the chances of you making a coherent book with that jump, aren't very good.

01:18:37.864 --> 01:18:54.257
And so the guy who got the book deal for the genetic causes of autism, of course, in 2019, there was a video of him on YouTube talking about how vaccines are actually hurting a genetically vulnerable subset of kids.

01:18:55.370 --> 01:19:00.496
and that certain communities around the United States are enriched for these genetically vulnerable signals.

01:19:00.876 --> 01:19:12.329
And if we could just, you know, catalog these little populations and mine them for biomarkers, we would be able to make the vaccine schedule safe by identifying people who might be hurt by it.

01:19:12.349 --> 01:19:14.371
And then the rest of the people will just have to take it.

01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:27.223
He also is emphasizing in 2019 in April that asymptomatic spread of all vaccinated diseases occurs.

01:19:27.403 --> 01:19:28.705
Asymptomatic spread.

01:19:30.627 --> 01:19:33.531
Something that not very many of us were talking about in 2019, right?

01:19:37.407 --> 01:19:39.408
conflicts of interest over the past.

01:19:39.468 --> 01:19:54.714
Remember in that same month we also know that at the Chatham House there was this presentation by this guy who talked about controlling the narrative from day one about one message only and lamenting that he didn't have the social media that we have now back 10 years ago in 2009.

01:19:55.534 --> 01:19:56.155
This is from 2019.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.616
We watched it the other day.

01:19:59.036 --> 01:20:04.438
He jokes constantly about lying to people and trying to exaggerate the danger to get more compliance.

01:20:07.179 --> 01:20:15.425
And of course, Juve Alschner in Germany points out that the Chatham House is really the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is the CFR equivalent of the UK.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:26.473
So just before the pandemic, a guy that CHD parades around as an authority on the biology of vaccination,

01:20:29.554 --> 01:20:54.561
was given a book deal by Skyhorse Publishing in 2015 that published in 2016 about the environmental and genetic causes of autism in 2019 is still advocating for this idea that vaccine injury is because of genetic predisposition, not because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, but because some kids are genetically vulnerable.

01:20:57.011 --> 01:21:05.558
And that same year is a year after the real event 201 in 2018, the year of the event 201 in October of 2019.

01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:09.862
And in the beginning of this year, there was a Chatham House presentation.

01:21:12.364 --> 01:21:14.126
Detailing how to do it right this time.

01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:28.468
And curiously in 2019 is also when Peter Thiel and Joe Rogan and all these people decided that being a podcaster and having the Intellectual Dark Web was a great idea.

01:21:28.948 --> 01:21:40.619
And he decided to do it with two brothers whose dad, whose father was in the Department of Justice of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy and was part of the formation of the FDA.

01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:44.262
The brother, Eric, advises Thiel Capital

01:21:45.916 --> 01:22:02.548
Brett got $500,000 from a university settlement about something woke that was filmed with way too many cameras and produced into way too many nice movies and got to complain about it in front of the Senate, which is, again, interesting.

01:22:03.609 --> 01:22:06.211
Brett also discovered something about inbred mice.

01:22:06.271 --> 01:22:10.374
Apparently, inbred mice aren't a very good model for human biology.

01:22:10.474 --> 01:22:11.315
No kidding, Brett.

01:22:11.855 --> 01:22:15.378
And so then they said, hey, bro, why don't we start podcasting?

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:24.565
And then on the eighth Dark Horse podcast, of course, we have Sam Harris show up.

01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:25.745
And what does Sam Harris say?

01:22:26.126 --> 01:22:33.569
He says that when the next pandemic comes and it's killing 70% of those infected, we won't be able to tolerate anti-vaxxer nonsense anymore.

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.850
This is all in the same 2019.

01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:42.412
It's like we should have seen it coming, but we weren't paying attention.

01:22:43.173 --> 01:22:43.933
We were too busy.

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:59.776
And so James Lyons Wyler and Robert Malone actually are the two people that I know pronounced it COVID for the first year or so.

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:02.457
That's kind of extraordinary.

01:23:02.637 --> 01:23:04.677
The other one who did was Paul Cottrell.

01:23:06.818 --> 01:23:08.238
Everybody else called it COVID.

01:23:09.138 --> 01:23:11.019
But COVID is easy to hear.

01:23:12.059 --> 01:23:14.720
And the people who said it are probably all on the same team.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.960
And they told all the same stories.

01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:18.741
In 2020,

01:23:20.489 --> 01:23:22.011
that they don't want to talk about anymore.

01:23:24.273 --> 01:23:31.160
We had a human genome project, person enthusiastically sequencing the genome of cannabis now.

01:23:32.101 --> 01:23:43.093
One of the candidates for personalized medicine would be plants that were genetically modified or plant compounds that were genetically modified, personalized for you.

01:23:44.755 --> 01:24:08.426
that guy whose father was into microarray technology, who he dropped out of college to join the Human Genome Project, which at the time was at the Department of Energy, which is also where Nukes are, which is also where DITRA is, which is also where Margaret Hamburg was, and her father, and that's really interesting because her father was best friends with Joshua Lederberg, who's actually one of the authors in these books.

01:24:10.054 --> 01:24:25.265
And one of the real godfathers of this kind of thinking that the human race needs to rise above nationalism and national borders to take control of our evolution as a species.

01:24:25.966 --> 01:24:29.228
And that includes taking control of our collective consciousness.

01:24:30.902 --> 01:24:39.368
And so he partnered with all kinds of these people early on in the end of 2020 to write an objection to the WHO test.

01:24:40.248 --> 01:24:45.852
One of those people he partnered with was Claire Craig, but Thomas Binder was on that paper.

01:24:45.992 --> 01:24:47.493
Mike Yeadon was on that paper.

01:24:53.516 --> 01:24:55.337
And so there's no useful resistance here.

01:24:55.377 --> 01:25:04.384
This is a guy with very high credentials coming out very early and often to make sure that nobody doubted the existence of the novel virus.

01:25:04.465 --> 01:25:13.932
Nobody doubted the existence of RNA viruses or their ability to pandemic and nobody doubted the usefulness of PCR in diagnosing their presence.

01:25:16.385 --> 01:25:23.249
And she, Claire Craig, did the same thing in the UK by talking about PCR testing like food in a restaurant.

01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:27.651
You can have fast food, and if it's good, it's gonna be expensive.

01:25:28.212 --> 01:25:32.154
Otherwise, if it's cheap and it's fast, then it's not gonna be very good.

01:25:32.874 --> 01:25:35.656
And if you want fast and good, then it's really expensive.

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:43.460
And so usually there's a trade-off in testing and something, something, I don't know, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected with PCR was the conclusion.

01:25:48.388 --> 01:25:59.194
So again, I can't stress enough how terrifying it is that weaponized piles of money have convinced us about what to argue and with whom to argue about it.

01:25:59.675 --> 01:26:03.117
And that's what we have been doing on Twitter and on social media.

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:10.161
We have not been promoting people that are now coming to our rescue as a unified unity party.

01:26:12.082 --> 01:26:13.563
This is the hog trap.

01:26:14.813 --> 01:26:20.416
We have rushed into the hog trap and ran face first into the back fence.

01:26:23.017 --> 01:26:27.939
And when we turned around, all these people were standing in front of us, blocking our view of our escape.

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.981
And we've been arguing with them ever since.

01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:35.403
Grab the joystick, put on the goggles, sit in the chair, and we're not going to escape.

01:26:40.287 --> 01:26:43.817
And so they will admit that the food, processed food is bad.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.823
They will, whoops, I'll fix that.

01:26:50.598 --> 01:26:56.542
So by the way, I'm going to be speaking to the doctors for COVID ethics in the UK, Stephen Frost's group again on Tuesday afternoon.

01:26:56.582 --> 01:26:58.403
If you want to catch that, it's going to be baller.

01:26:59.563 --> 01:27:01.525
They will admit that the processed food is bad.

01:27:01.565 --> 01:27:03.426
They will admit that the environment is polluted.

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:05.547
They will admit that the cosmetics are toxic.

01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:10.430
They will admit that the old vaccine schedule wasn't tested.

01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:18.435
They will admit that the COVID shots were bad, but they will promise to fix all of these with science.

01:27:20.302 --> 01:27:24.503
They will promise to fix all of these with science.

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:30.844
And now you're going to say, well, come on, you don't have any proof of that.

01:27:30.884 --> 01:27:32.584
You don't know what these people are up to.

01:27:32.604 --> 01:27:36.845
I know that they haven't risked anything and they're not risking anything now.

01:27:37.265 --> 01:27:43.667
And I know that they won't candidly speak about what they were doing in 2020 and the ideas that I was talking about in 2020 and 21 to them.

01:27:43.687 --> 01:27:44.007
They won't.

01:27:47.361 --> 01:27:49.702
They will promise to fix all of these.

01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:50.383
How do I know?

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:59.667
Because Steve Kirsch slipped up on the Steve, on the Stu Peters podcast a couple days ago and revealed the plan.

01:28:01.888 --> 01:28:02.449
Are you ready?

01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:10.773
Because this is the biggest own goal that this Team Robert Malone clown show has ever made.

01:28:10.893 --> 01:28:14.275
It's bigger own goal than Jessica Hockett

01:28:15.353 --> 01:28:25.518
messaging Mark and threatening to call the cops and telling me that if I wanted to work it out with Jonathan Engler, she'd be willing to have a phone call, but she's not going to talk to Mark anymore.

01:28:25.878 --> 01:28:27.679
That was an own goal for sure.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.141
But this one, this is extraordinary.

01:28:36.235 --> 01:28:41.438
are safe and effective, you should go get yours, because that's not what the news media should be doing.

01:28:41.778 --> 01:28:52.783
They should be reporting on what's actually happening and pointing out to people that side effects do occur, and that they should always, before getting any medical intervention, understand the risks and the benefits.

01:28:53.203 --> 01:29:05.729
Now, for all vaccines, it turns out that the accepting extremely rare cases like, you know, maybe this one might have might have been a case, but but I really don't think so.

01:29:06.190 --> 01:29:12.433
And in pretty much every case I know about, the benefits of vaccination never outweigh the risk.

01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:15.334
And people should always be refusing vaccination.

01:29:15.354 --> 01:29:17.975
We've been telling people that for a long time.

01:29:18.075 --> 01:29:21.097
OK, so you do agree that nobody should ever take another vaccine.

01:29:22.718 --> 01:29:27.321
No, people should not take any of the vaccines that are currently approved.

01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:33.325
There may be a time, Stu, in five years from now, that they actually have a safe vaccine.

01:29:33.425 --> 01:29:33.845
No, there won't.

01:29:33.925 --> 01:29:35.866
We can't rule that out.

01:29:35.906 --> 01:29:40.769
What that means is they make billions and billions of dollars off of every one of these shots that they roll out.

01:29:40.789 --> 01:29:44.932
Then, you know, several thousand or a hundred thousand or tens of thousands of people die.

01:29:49.075 --> 01:29:49.595
What did he say?

01:29:51.912 --> 01:29:53.513
What did he say?

01:29:53.533 --> 01:29:54.914
They're safe and effective.

01:29:54.934 --> 01:29:59.217
You should go get yours because that's what the not that's not what the news media should be doing.

01:29:59.557 --> 01:30:10.565
They should be reporting on what's actually happening and pointing out to people that side effects do occur and that they should always before getting any medical intervention understand the risks and the benefits.

01:30:10.985 --> 01:30:23.511
Now, for all vaccines, it turns out that the except in extremely rare cases like, you know, maybe this one might have might have been a case, but but I really don't think so.

01:30:23.972 --> 01:30:30.215
And in pretty much every case I know about the the benefits of vaccination never outweigh the risk.

01:30:30.615 --> 01:30:33.116
And people should always be refusing vaccination.

01:30:33.136 --> 01:30:35.757
We've been telling people that for a long time.

01:30:35.857 --> 01:30:38.879
OK, so you do agree that nobody should ever take another vaccine.

01:30:40.503 --> 01:30:45.105
No, people should not take any of the vaccines that are currently approved.

01:30:45.505 --> 01:30:51.067
There may be a time, Stu, in five years from now, that they actually have a safe vaccine.

01:30:51.187 --> 01:30:51.607
No, there won't.

01:30:51.687 --> 01:30:52.887
We can't rule that out.

01:30:53.187 --> 01:30:55.108
And that's why Bobby Kennedy says he's not gonna take that.

01:30:55.128 --> 01:30:58.309
They make billions and billions of dollars off of every one of these shots that they roll.

01:30:58.529 --> 01:31:06.472
He just said that Bobby Kennedy, in five years, he said exactly what I've been predicting

01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:16.536
that they were gonna tell you that the old vaccine schedule was bad, they were gonna admit it eventually, and that the new vaccine schedule would be good, but we gotta test them, that's all.

01:31:17.677 --> 01:31:23.761
We gotta test all of these things, which is what Bobby has been advocating for for a very long time.

01:31:23.861 --> 01:31:31.967
So if Donald Trump gets elected and Bobby gets appointed somewhere and says, all right, we're gonna test these vaccines, will he also pause the schedule?

01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:41.895
Is he gonna put a moratorium on vaccination for five years until we test all of these things and we figure out which transfections work?

01:31:44.197 --> 01:31:45.718
Or which of the old ones work?

01:31:46.979 --> 01:31:50.381
Or are we just gonna go on with the schedule and we're gonna test some?

01:31:51.662 --> 01:31:54.104
We'll decide which ones need testing first.

01:31:54.624 --> 01:32:01.009
Maybe we'll have to appoint a whole group of people to decide which ones have been tested and which ones actually haven't.

01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:06.011
We'll need millions, if not billions of dollars in funding.

01:32:06.031 --> 01:32:07.372
We'll need a lot of volunteers.

01:32:07.392 --> 01:32:08.452
They'll have to all be human.

01:32:14.134 --> 01:32:16.175
That is an own goal, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:16.235 --> 01:32:28.159
What he just said there, evoking Robert F. Kennedy's name, and that not all vaccines, because in five years we might have a safe one, is what he said.

01:32:31.656 --> 01:32:33.978
And he's on this team, he's in this boat.

01:32:38.321 --> 01:32:51.310
And so that's what makes it very scary that maybe Jimmy Dore has been titrated to the truth just like we have, but in a very different way because these people needed to visit him just like they visited me.

01:32:52.851 --> 01:32:54.372
Jimmy Dore is not a biologist.

01:32:54.893 --> 01:32:56.434
Jimmy Dore is a vaccine injured guy.

01:32:57.594 --> 01:33:06.880
So he's a little easier guy to control because he's primarily focused on the censorship that occurred with regard to the transfections.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:10.242
But he's not calling them transfections because none of these people have taught him that.

01:33:12.044 --> 01:33:15.846
He's had all of these people on his show, but none of these people have told him about me.

01:33:16.527 --> 01:33:18.128
Dan Cohen told him about me.

01:33:19.108 --> 01:33:22.491
We'll see if Jimmy Dore will give me a call after this weekend.

01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:22.971
Who knows?

01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:24.272
Maybe we'll get lucky.

01:33:24.312 --> 01:33:27.354
Maybe we'll get a shot at explaining this to Jimmy.

01:33:29.454 --> 01:33:38.019
So let's watch a video with Bret Weinstein bamboozling Jimmy Dore and see if I can throw a lifeline to Jimmy here.

01:33:51.494 --> 01:33:56.536
All right, yes, Jimmy Dore and Weinstock, 2024.

01:33:57.156 --> 01:33:59.217
Trying to understand the trap we are in.

01:34:00.077 --> 01:34:04.819
I'll just hit escape here and get this video out for you.

01:34:05.779 --> 01:34:06.960
What video am I doing again?

01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:15.803
I was doing the... Oh, I wanted to show you this one.

01:34:17.608 --> 01:34:23.872
Just as a warning, they are gonna go for digital ID, but they're gonna invert the digital ID thing, right?

01:34:23.952 --> 01:34:29.715
First of all, they have this thing in Idaho, where apparently Idaho has banned Pornhub.

01:34:30.196 --> 01:34:46.546
And so Pornhub has decided not to send their data to Idaho anymore, instead of, you know, some kind of age control, because if they had an age control on their website, then Idaho would allow them to bring porn to Idaho.

01:34:47.984 --> 01:35:04.082
Very similar to that, you're going to hear a recent Bill Maher interview with that bald guy from Israel who says that we're all useless eaters and he's going to tell you that bots actually shouldn't have free speech on the internet and that

01:35:04.702 --> 01:35:33.864
algorithmic bots should not be able to control the discourse on the internet with with as much free speech as they want and what that is is the opposite side of the coin that we need to discern between bots and humans on the internet so that only humans have free speech and not bots but that's the same digital id trap just a different side of that trap right it's it's a hog trap it's all the way around you so if you run in one direction and hit a fence

01:35:35.236 --> 01:35:39.378
and then turn around and run the opposite way, you're going to hit a fence again, because it's a hog trap.

01:35:40.338 --> 01:35:41.539
There's only one way out.

01:35:41.619 --> 01:35:43.620
And these people will not show it to you.

01:35:46.702 --> 01:35:53.425
And so just listen to this, because it's really- Did you not say that you think that free speech should only extend to humans, not bots?

01:35:53.845 --> 01:35:54.505
Yes, I did say that.

01:35:54.525 --> 01:35:54.785
Oh, good.

01:35:54.805 --> 01:35:55.546
I got one out of two.

01:35:55.606 --> 01:35:55.666
Yes.

01:36:01.843 --> 01:36:08.486
Meaning, if there are chatbots, there's no free speech for them, which is not something everybody agrees with at this point.

01:36:08.926 --> 01:36:21.451
Yeah, and also, more importantly, no free speech or no free pass for the algorithms that are now managing the social media platforms, which are the most important media platforms in the world.

01:36:23.542 --> 01:36:33.614
Basically, we now have the most sophisticated information technology in history, and people are losing the ability to hold the conversation, to talk with each other, to listen to each other.

01:36:33.835 --> 01:36:36.938
This is not just a US problem, it is all over the world.

01:36:37.759 --> 01:36:50.743
And this is largely because we gave one of the most important jobs, not just in the media industry, in the world, to algorithms which are not regulated and nobody is liable for what they are doing.

01:36:51.323 --> 01:36:57.705
You know, the job of news editors was once one of the most important jobs a human can fulfill.

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:03.107
Lenin, before he was dictator of the Soviet Union, was editor of a newspaper.

01:37:03.507 --> 01:37:08.693
Mussolini, before he was the dictator of Italy, he was editor of a newspaper.

01:37:09.393 --> 01:37:13.017
Now the most important editors in the world are algorithms.

01:37:13.418 --> 01:37:17.762
The algorithms that decide what you will see on the news feed, in Facebook.

01:37:17.803 --> 01:37:19.584
So this is just nonsense, right?

01:37:19.604 --> 01:37:20.786
This is just nonsense.

01:37:20.846 --> 01:37:25.110
This is this guy trying to tell you that AI is scary.

01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:29.014
that AI is a problem, that AI needs to be regulated.

01:37:29.494 --> 01:37:34.678
And the flip side of his argument is that people need to be identified on the internet.

01:37:34.718 --> 01:37:37.420
It's not any different of the trap.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.141
It's the same part of the hog trap.

01:37:39.161 --> 01:37:40.382
You've got to be very careful.

01:37:41.183 --> 01:37:44.325
So I'm having trouble finding this video.

01:37:44.365 --> 01:37:45.666
I thought I downloaded it.

01:37:45.746 --> 01:37:46.647
So just hold on.

01:37:46.667 --> 01:37:47.528
Give me a second here.

01:37:51.391 --> 01:37:52.532
Where did I put it?

01:37:53.352 --> 01:37:55.394
I might just have to quickly download it again.

01:37:56.486 --> 01:38:02.952
Um, I thought I did, but maybe I just have to download it again.

01:38:03.273 --> 01:38:04.514
Give me one second here.

01:38:04.594 --> 01:38:05.975
I don't think it'll take very long.

01:38:06.035 --> 01:38:07.717
It's in my history of my YouTube.

01:38:10.099 --> 01:38:14.283
Um, let's see.

01:38:14.383 --> 01:38:14.703
Oh, wow.

01:38:14.743 --> 01:38:16.405
I've been watching a lot of garbage lately.

01:38:16.425 --> 01:38:16.465
Um,

01:38:23.407 --> 01:38:24.027
Where is it?

01:38:24.267 --> 01:38:27.849
Door, door, door, door, door, door, door, sorry.

01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:29.610
Oh my gosh, where are we?

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:32.211
Come on now.

01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:39.474
Okay, I guess I have to look in the history.

01:38:51.619 --> 01:38:52.059
Where is it?

01:38:55.836 --> 01:38:58.821
Okay, I'm having trouble here so I'm gonna have to do another one like this.

01:39:00.063 --> 01:39:01.044
Sorry about this guys.

01:39:01.064 --> 01:39:05.230
I'm sure this will come up, won't it?

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:06.252
No?

01:39:06.452 --> 01:39:07.574
Oh my gosh, really?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.101
Okay, found it.

01:39:27.681 --> 01:39:32.862
I'm going to download it for you because I don't want to have that bandwidth being used.

01:39:33.882 --> 01:39:36.383
So let's see how quickly this can happen.

01:39:36.543 --> 01:39:37.323
Sorry about that.

01:39:37.343 --> 01:39:38.664
Let's see if I already had it.

01:39:42.305 --> 01:39:43.085
I don't think I had it.

01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:44.105
Oh, it does say one.

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:45.265
Shoot, I didn't have it.

01:39:46.126 --> 01:39:47.206
Okay, I could stop this then.

01:39:51.067 --> 01:39:52.288
It'll convert it in a second.

01:39:52.328 --> 01:39:52.728
Here we go.

01:39:52.768 --> 01:39:59.193
Okay, so I want to watch this one because again, this is Jimmy Dore and I have to admit that I like Jimmy.

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:00.494
I've seen him in person.

01:40:00.514 --> 01:40:10.041
I gave him an annotated book of Bobby's with all my pages marked and a little letter in it and an explanation and my phone call, a phone number.

01:40:10.081 --> 01:40:13.403
And so I kind of have hopes that he's a guy who

01:40:15.672 --> 01:40:24.924
is skeptical enough of the whole system that can continue to sort of peel back the layers of truth until we get to the core of it.

01:40:25.665 --> 01:40:31.573
And in that case, I think we could have something nice happen here.

01:40:35.649 --> 01:40:36.590
Hey, come see us on tour.

01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:42.296
We'll be in Duluth, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, Los Angeles, Tempe, Arizona, and Burbank, California.

01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:44.378
Go to JimmyDore.com for a link for those tickets.

01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:46.340
We have some guests right at the top of the show.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.542
This is going to be exciting.

01:40:48.403 --> 01:40:50.705
Our first guest is Angela McArdle.

01:40:50.785 --> 01:40:57.092
She is a prominent figure in the Libertarian Party, serving as the chair of the Libertarian National Committee since 2022.

01:40:58.733 --> 01:41:00.473
In 2018, she ran for the U.S.

01:41:00.513 --> 01:41:06.875
House seat in California's 34th Congressional District, securing 8.4% of the vote in the primary.

01:41:07.335 --> 01:41:14.557
She was a co-organizer of the Rage Against the War Machine rally in Washington, D.C., which I was a part of, which was a big success.

01:41:14.597 --> 01:41:16.417
Please welcome to the show Angela Mercado.

01:41:16.457 --> 01:41:17.417
Hey, Angela, how are you?

01:41:17.437 --> 01:41:19.498
Hey, I'm doing great.

01:41:19.558 --> 01:41:20.278
Thanks for having me.

01:41:21.065 --> 01:41:23.568
Also you see next to her is Brett Weinstein.

01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:26.911
He's a returning guest, friend of the show.

01:41:26.991 --> 01:41:32.496
He's an American podcaster, author, former professor of evolutionary biology.

01:41:32.556 --> 01:41:45.309
He served on the faculty of Evergreen State College from 2002 to 2017 when he resigned in the aftermath of a series of campus protests about racial equity at Evergreen, which brought him to national attention.

01:41:45.809 --> 01:41:58.300
With his wife, Heather Hying, he co-wrote A Hunter's Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century, and he is the host of the popular Dark Horse podcast, which I'm a big fan of and watch often.

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.202
Please welcome back to the show, Brett Weinstein.

01:42:01.242 --> 01:42:01.903
Hey, how are you?

01:42:02.763 --> 01:42:03.324
Doing well.

01:42:03.604 --> 01:42:04.465
Glad to be here, Jimmy.

01:42:04.764 --> 01:42:19.868
So the reason why I have both of you on is because, well, they've organized this this big to do on September 29th in Washington, D.C., the same place we were at doing the Rage Against the War Machine rally.

01:42:20.288 --> 01:42:21.869
It's called Rescue the Republic.

01:42:22.909 --> 01:42:24.850
And look at all the.

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:27.830
Look at all the cool people that are going to be there.

01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:28.871
Brett's going to be there.

01:42:29.491 --> 01:42:29.871
Look at that.

01:42:30.819 --> 01:42:34.964
Russell Brand will be there, Tulsi Gabbard, Matt Taibbi, Colonel Douglas McGregor?

01:42:36.926 --> 01:42:42.452
Deep State, Deep State, Deep State, Deep State, Deep State.

01:42:43.954 --> 01:42:44.835
I hope he's not.

01:42:45.115 --> 01:42:48.799
He's definitely Deep State because he was in one of those music videos.

01:42:49.668 --> 01:42:52.130
She is intellectual dark web, but you know, whatever.

01:42:52.811 --> 01:43:01.677
He was a witness for the George Floyd trial at the same time that he was speaking in front of the Senate and Ron Johnson about how bad it was in New York.

01:43:02.558 --> 01:43:07.422
This guy is a fake Christian unity religion kind of dude.

01:43:08.414 --> 01:43:10.996
He'll probably open with a prayer on Sunday.

01:43:11.896 --> 01:43:17.839
Brett Weinstein is a guy who's recently declared that this is a spiritual war, even though he's a secular guy his whole life.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:25.143
Robert Malone is a horse breeder and emu breeder who has decided to come out of retirement and save us.

01:43:25.243 --> 01:43:33.268
Laura Logan, another person really connected to these people in a strange way and not sophisticated enough to understand

01:43:34.008 --> 01:43:37.891
what the biosecurity state is lying about, and maybe neither is J.P.

01:43:37.911 --> 01:43:38.372
Spears.

01:43:38.572 --> 01:43:41.714
Maybe neither Pierre Kory just never bothered to ask.

01:43:41.775 --> 01:43:44.557
Maybe none of these musicians can know.

01:43:45.297 --> 01:43:55.706
Maybe Tulsi Gabbard is even not sophisticated enough to understand that transfection and transformation using synthetic DNA and RNA has been misconstrued as high-level virology for decades.

01:43:55.746 --> 01:43:59.089
It's possible, but it's pretty easy to explain to them.

01:44:01.721 --> 01:44:04.702
And so I hope we get an opportunity to do so sometime in the future.

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:21.808
Tennessee.

01:44:21.848 --> 01:44:22.269
I don't know.

01:44:22.369 --> 01:44:23.490
I'm out of it.

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:24.110
J.P.

01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:24.430
Sears.

01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:25.011
Hilarious.

01:44:25.211 --> 01:44:25.952
We love J.P.

01:44:26.672 --> 01:44:27.092
Darius.

01:44:27.112 --> 01:44:28.233
There's your wife right there.

01:44:28.654 --> 01:44:30.735
And then five times August is going to be there.

01:44:30.755 --> 01:44:34.418
I'm familiar with them because of Twitter and that great song they did about COVID.

01:44:34.839 --> 01:44:35.519
Let's see who else.

01:44:35.579 --> 01:44:36.360
And then there's me.

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.382
Look, that's back when I had my dark hair.

01:44:38.402 --> 01:44:38.842
It's nice.

01:44:39.164 --> 01:44:40.885
I like that they picked a nice photo of you, Jimmy.

01:44:40.925 --> 01:44:41.846
Yeah, it's a nice photo.

01:44:42.046 --> 01:44:46.048
And Deepak, not Chopra, just a different Deepak.

01:44:46.649 --> 01:44:49.110
And then Struggles Jennings and Zuby.

01:44:49.130 --> 01:44:50.711
I know Zuby from Zuby.

01:44:51.072 --> 01:44:56.055
So please tell me what this is about.

01:44:56.095 --> 01:44:56.375
Zuby.

01:44:56.395 --> 01:45:07.943
Don't forget that Zuby did like an hour and a half with none other than than Dan Wilson debunked the funk, which was and a hilarious display.

01:45:09.163 --> 01:45:14.065
of this kind of limited spectrum of debate and the elevation of foreigners in America.

01:45:15.726 --> 01:45:16.666
It's just gross.

01:45:19.007 --> 01:45:20.948
And that's what makes it kind of sad, right?

01:45:21.488 --> 01:45:29.951
Is that if we could sit down for an afternoon with Jimmy Dore, we could potentially blow his mind.

01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:52.307
just by showing these people on other programs or earlier than when they talked to him, he would be shocked at how much information is still available and how much of it really edifies this idea that these people were put in place from the beginning and the real censorship we needed to be concerned about is how these people managed to become prominent.

01:45:53.987 --> 01:45:56.988
And it was because it was by design and by programming.

01:45:57.518 --> 01:45:58.861
Either one of you, take it where you will.

01:45:58.901 --> 01:46:03.810
What is Rescue the Republic rally all about September 29th in Washington, D.C.?

01:46:05.412 --> 01:46:06.034
Take it away, Brett.

01:46:07.079 --> 01:46:13.203
Well, we are convinced that this is a pivotal moment in American history.

01:46:13.484 --> 01:46:20.429
And in fact, that not only is the Republican great danger, but Western civilization is.

01:46:20.529 --> 01:46:28.715
And this is the moment at which we have to recover control over our governmental structures and return them

01:46:29.495 --> 01:46:33.396
to functioning in the way that the founders envisioned.

01:46:33.857 --> 01:46:46.321
So at one level, this is obviously an event, you could call it a rally, but at another level, I'm hesitant about those terms because they don't really reflect the gravity of the situation.

01:46:46.561 --> 01:46:53.183
It's a little like calling Woodstock a music festival, which it was, but it was also more than that.

01:46:53.223 --> 01:46:58.225
It was a defining moment for a generation and we believe this is going to be a defining moment for ours.

01:46:59.766 --> 01:47:08.391
So what is the threat to Western civilization and the Republic?

01:47:08.972 --> 01:47:25.683
Well, the West is based on the idea that we are not allowed to rig the structures of the world in favor of our people, that we agree to a level playing field and the structures that protect it from people gaming.

01:47:27.156 --> 01:47:38.239
So what has happened is our institutions have all been captured and the system now has many of the trappings of a democratic republic, but it doesn't function like one.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.940
And that is resulting in a never ending.

01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:56.665
Interestingly enough, the, the name underneath Brett Weinstein here in this video is not Brett Weinstein or Heather Haying or their son Zach's name, but it says Mickey Willis.

01:47:59.616 --> 01:48:01.797
Does that mean he's at Mickey Willis' house?

01:48:02.697 --> 01:48:04.918
Or just using Mickey Willis' laptop?

01:48:04.958 --> 01:48:05.959
What does this mean?

01:48:07.059 --> 01:48:11.301
Because Bret Weinstein is a professional podcaster with a studio in his house.

01:48:12.502 --> 01:48:15.303
Presumably they have their own Zoom account.

01:48:20.014 --> 01:48:21.096
I mean, can you see it yet?

01:48:21.677 --> 01:48:31.154
Extreme of policies that do not serve the public interest and increasingly threats to the central values that we hold dear.

01:48:33.129 --> 01:48:35.550
So what would be some of those central values?

01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:36.830
Oh, good question.

01:48:37.430 --> 01:49:01.116
Well, things like informed consent in a medical context, things like the consent of the governed being the sole basis for the legitimacy of governmental power, a commitment to truth seeking in which we do not tell ourselves stories that we want to hear, but in fact, we pursue the truth that we need to know.

01:49:03.228 --> 01:49:05.429
We need equal protection under the law.

01:49:05.589 --> 01:49:14.413
We've seen egregious overreach of lawfare being used against political rivals, being used against dissidents.

01:49:14.973 --> 01:49:28.059
We need a rational border policy because although immigration can be good, it is not good inherently and having an open border in which we have no idea who's coming across and what they want and whether they even want to be

01:49:28.659 --> 01:49:30.921
Americans is very important.

01:49:31.541 --> 01:49:33.962
There are threats to the family.

01:49:34.062 --> 01:49:37.284
There's an anti-natalism that has taken over our institutions.

01:49:37.464 --> 01:49:52.754
There is an onerous belief that the state knows better how to raise children than parents do and that in fact the state has the right to take children from parents and inflict experimental medical treatments on them that have

01:49:53.690 --> 01:49:58.153
Are you running that bias as what is possible or what they're already doing?

01:49:58.213 --> 01:50:00.034
Are you just informing us here, Brett?

01:50:00.074 --> 01:50:02.596
Because it doesn't sound really like opposition to it.

01:50:02.636 --> 01:50:03.876
It's just the way things are.

01:50:04.617 --> 01:50:05.938
And we'd like to resist it.

01:50:06.398 --> 01:50:09.800
Implications across the child's entire life.

01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:12.882
So that's the beginning of a list for you.

01:50:13.742 --> 01:50:14.383
Great speech.

01:50:14.743 --> 01:50:16.324
That's an important one too.

01:50:16.806 --> 01:50:16.946
Yes.

01:50:17.066 --> 01:50:22.095
Yeah, I wonder if Julian Assange figures into this at all in terms of lawfare.

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.497
You know, I don't know.

01:50:23.517 --> 01:50:26.682
Well, it's just I guess I missed that freedom of speech.

01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.514
Well, I guess I agree with you.

01:50:29.534 --> 01:50:34.095
I think that would be the most important one, because without that, you can't get anything correct.

01:50:34.295 --> 01:50:36.796
And there's been an assault without free speech.

01:50:36.856 --> 01:50:39.476
I wouldn't be able to say that Brett Weinstein is a traitor.

01:50:39.516 --> 01:50:47.178
And it's most likely because his loyalty is to his family and his friends that are connected all the way back to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:50:47.138 --> 01:50:50.859
's dad and uncle and the formation of the FDA.

01:50:51.879 --> 01:50:56.440
Also, his brother's connection to Teal Capital probably plays a role in his prominence.

01:50:57.278 --> 01:51:01.841
But he's a traitor and he's not fighting for my grandchildren or yours.

01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:06.283
He is fighting for the controlled demolition of America and he is part of it.

01:51:06.983 --> 01:51:17.269
He is part of the useful clown show that has titrated us over five years to the point where we are when we could have gotten here in a couple weeks in May of 2020.

01:51:17.409 --> 01:51:26.034
We could have gotten here in a couple weeks in May of 2020 if it wasn't for people like Brett

01:51:27.898 --> 01:51:36.545
If it wasn't for people like Brett and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and Meryl Nass, Jimmy Dore would have never transfected himself.

01:51:38.967 --> 01:51:55.821
And if Jimmy Dore could realize that the fact that Brett Weinstein was wearing a bandana and goggles, and because Brett Weinstein was advocating for zero COVID has a biological possibility, he is part of the reason why he took the shot.

01:51:58.615 --> 01:51:59.516
He's not a hero.

01:52:02.799 --> 01:52:12.308
And in 2020, I wasn't being a hero either because I was fighting them, arguing with them, thinking that they were my path to greater

01:52:14.258 --> 01:52:18.639
influence, that if I could convince them, then we would make progress.

01:52:18.659 --> 01:52:20.960
So I had to argue with Brett in a signal chat.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.500
I had to argue with Chris Martinson in a signal chat.

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:33.643
I had to argue with Alexandros Marinos in a signal chat while they went on Twitter to talk about ivermectin for two years and wouldn't call it transfection even now in 2024.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:38.350
I am upset because I've met these people.

01:52:38.410 --> 01:52:45.197
I've talked to them and they've lied to me about what they thought were good ideas and what they thought and what they were gonna do with them.

01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:47.159
And they didn't do anything with them.

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:56.270
And we are here five years later and this guy and social media is putting this guy in front of us.

01:52:58.041 --> 01:53:05.142
And he is part of a group of influencers that is around Bobby Kennedy, riding his coattails into the Trump administration.

01:53:05.663 --> 01:53:09.903
Whether or not Trump is saving us or not, these people are not for sure.

01:53:09.923 --> 01:53:19.465
And so depending on how pessimistic you are, you cannot dismiss that Brett Weinstein is a traitor.

01:53:19.505 --> 01:53:22.766
And my free speech allows me to say it, and I will say it until I'm done.

01:53:26.428 --> 01:53:45.508
socialist called the Uhuru movement and they're now being accused by the federal government and they're taking to court, they could do 10 years, for working for the Russian government and basically they're just using their freedom of speech and so they're trying to criminalize free speech.

01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.971
Let's go through

01:53:49.372 --> 01:53:55.677
Let's go through, you have on your website, on the website it says there are eight pillars and let's go through some of them.

01:53:56.217 --> 01:54:05.764
It says banish state and media control, banish state media control, surveillance and propaganda versus the censorship industrial complex.

01:54:06.284 --> 01:54:15.011
So that sounds to me like he's totally fine and they're totally fine with private corporations that control social media, controlling free speech.

01:54:15.411 --> 01:54:18.173
He just doesn't want government messing around in it.

01:54:19.249 --> 01:54:19.989
Stop lying!

01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.950
Do you see?

01:54:22.150 --> 01:54:24.772
Isn't Jimmy sophisticated enough to see that?

01:54:24.912 --> 01:54:26.252
That that's not the solution?

01:54:26.312 --> 01:54:37.638
The solution is open social media, federated social media, decentralized social media, not privatized corporate controlled social media and just the government keeping their hands off.

01:54:39.315 --> 01:54:49.564
because then you'll just have people like Elon Musk controlling the debate and Peter Thiel controlling the debate, just like they did with their acolytes for five years already.

01:54:51.205 --> 01:54:53.067
Wake up, Jimmy, I'm trying to help you.

01:54:54.828 --> 01:54:57.871
So, Angela, you want to go ahead and tell me a little bit about that?

01:54:59.972 --> 01:55:00.673
Absolutely.

01:55:00.693 --> 01:55:06.398
I think that anybody who was paying attention over the last four years or so

01:55:07.483 --> 01:55:17.405
understands that the federal government and its extrajudicial agencies, departments, run an aggressive propaganda campaign.

01:55:18.525 --> 01:55:20.126
And they do it through social media.

01:55:20.206 --> 01:55:21.586
You know, they co-opted Twitter.

01:55:21.646 --> 01:55:23.467
We read all about that in the Twitter files.

01:55:23.667 --> 01:55:34.649
Mark Zuckerberg actually just came out and apologized for what we all knew, but had told that, you know, had not happened, which is that he worked lockstep with the federal government to censor things.

01:55:35.185 --> 01:55:42.991
like the Hunter Biden laptop story and certain things about COVID-19 shots during 2020 and 2021.

01:55:44.072 --> 01:55:48.616
And we view that essentially as a censorship industrial complex.

01:55:49.717 --> 01:55:52.619
And certainly we oppose it.

01:55:52.699 --> 01:55:57.003
That's one of the things that we wanna use this event for is to speak out against it and identify it.

01:55:57.083 --> 01:56:02.027
I think it's really critical to identify these things so that people understand what they are

01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:15.447
What they are are coordinated liars across social media that agree to curate a limited spectrum of debate about a novel virus that killed millions and millions more were saved from that could come again because gain of function is real.

01:56:17.694 --> 01:56:27.879
and they are going to slowly tell us that the vaccine schedule is bad, that we really do have bad food, that people are really sick because the FDA didn't protect them.

01:56:27.919 --> 01:56:32.661
And so we need the government to protect us and we need vaccines, but we need them tested.

01:56:32.721 --> 01:56:38.824
And we need to get rid of some of these guns because, you know, I was shot and his dad was shot and his uncle was shot.

01:56:38.884 --> 01:56:42.806
And so, you know, we should really get rid of these guns too, right?

01:56:44.332 --> 01:56:46.456
Can't you see it coming, ladies and gentlemen?

01:56:46.496 --> 01:56:55.614
A landslide win for Donald Trump would not be that different from Chapter 13 and Don't Start the Revolution Without Me by Jesse Ventura.

01:56:58.126 --> 01:57:02.471
where some demagogue gets elected president and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:02.551 --> 01:57:07.316
serves in his administration and then that president gets killed and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:07.396 --> 01:57:10.960
rises to prominence in that administration after the assassination.

01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:17.267
That is chapter 13 in Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, written by Jesse Ventura in 2009.

01:57:17.307 --> 01:57:17.628
That is chapter 13.

01:57:22.594 --> 01:57:32.640
And so now we are talking about having Steve Kirsch say on the Stu Peters podcast that in five years we might have safe vaccines because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.602
is going to get them tested once Trump is elected.

01:57:40.585 --> 01:57:42.005
I have shown it to you all.

01:57:42.126 --> 01:57:43.386
It's all from this week.

01:57:43.446 --> 01:57:49.470
You can find all of these videos still freshly circulating on social media if you are a skilled user.

01:57:51.271 --> 01:58:01.438
There is no doubt that this play is a play, that this theater is a big show, and that these people were put in place in order to enact it.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:17.749
Fifth Generation Warfare is Team Robert Malone, Jessica Rose, Pierre Corey, the Weinstein Brothers, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and the fake free speech on social media.

01:58:17.829 --> 01:58:20.711
It's all the same Fifth Generation Warfare.

01:58:21.431 --> 01:58:22.632
That's how we are governed.

01:58:23.412 --> 01:58:28.834
Coordinated lying on social media and on television and can start to turn away from them.

01:58:29.795 --> 01:58:34.757
So there was just it was unfortunate, I think, the timing of Mark Zuckerberg.

01:58:34.777 --> 01:58:42.221
Does the West need to be saved or does America need to be saved or does Pennsylvania need to be saved or does my community need to be saved?

01:58:42.481 --> 01:58:45.122
I don't really know what the answer to that question is.

01:58:46.603 --> 01:58:47.223
I really don't.

01:58:49.227 --> 01:59:03.138
I don't know if America can be saved given what they are doing, given what they are letting happen, given how they are destroying our economy, destroying our treasury, destroying the dollar, and destroying small-town America.

01:59:03.859 --> 01:59:10.844
I don't know really if it can be saved, but I do know that the unit worth saving is the American state.

01:59:12.565 --> 01:59:16.809
And if 50 states of America are where we end up falling to,

01:59:18.061 --> 01:59:28.464
That may be the default best case scenario for them at this point because they already know that's where they were going I don't know anymore ladies and gentlemen.

01:59:28.504 --> 01:59:44.348
I don't have any good solutions other than knowing first the truth the truth of our irreducible complexity the sacredness of it the evidence that it provides for a creator and the the

01:59:45.293 --> 01:59:48.157
requirement for humility in the face of this knowledge.

01:59:48.277 --> 01:59:57.348
That's what we need to go mainstream because then, then the charlatanism of these people will be visible and exposed for what it is.

02:00:00.511 --> 02:00:02.313
letter to the House committee.

02:00:03.474 --> 02:00:11.861
If he would have done it maybe a couple of months earlier, maybe there would be a different outcome in the Missouri versus, was it the Biden administration, over censorship.

02:00:12.741 --> 02:00:18.026
And did, correct me if I'm wrong, did the court rule that they didn't have standing?

02:00:18.566 --> 02:00:19.427
Was that what it was?

02:00:19.927 --> 02:00:24.031
They didn't actually address whether the Biden administration and the federal government was

02:00:25.252 --> 02:00:30.276
and coercing people to censor, but did they say they didn't have standing to sue?

02:00:31.107 --> 02:00:32.427
Yes, that is correct.

02:00:32.507 --> 02:00:52.294
It was argued that because they could not prove that what the executive branch had attempted to do had actually changed the behavior of the platforms, that they did not have standing because they couldn't prove that they were harmed, which to many of us looks like an absurd rationale.

02:00:52.334 --> 02:00:54.135
But nonetheless, that was what the court said.

02:00:54.915 --> 02:01:00.318
Well, there definitely is a censorship industrial complex, and I've run into it several times.

02:01:00.839 --> 02:01:15.388
And it's not just the FBI and the White House colluding with, you know, Stanford or and Twitter and Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok.

02:01:15.928 --> 02:01:18.370
It's also these fact check organizations.

02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.610
Right.

02:01:18.650 --> 02:01:22.072
So Facebook likes to say we have a third party fact checking organization.

02:01:22.692 --> 02:01:29.874
in which they've labeled almost everything I've said about COVID on Facebook as disinformation, and they put a label on it.

02:01:29.894 --> 02:01:33.055
So now all my friends in Hollywood think I'm some kind of a crazy.

02:01:33.795 --> 02:01:46.978
But if you look into those fact-checking organizations, they're all funded by a billionaire, like Bill Gates, with a political agenda, or a big pharma company like the Johnson & Johnson Foundation.

02:01:48.038 --> 02:01:50.279
These are not fact-checking organizations.

02:01:50.399 --> 02:02:05.422
These are, again, these are organizations with a political agenda, and they've never found one fact I've ever gotten wrong, but they do write articles saying that I'm being misleading, even though my facts are 100% correct.

02:02:07.322 --> 02:02:13.404
So that's a big part of the, is it okay if I call it a rally on September 29th?

02:02:14.651 --> 02:02:14.912
Sure.

02:02:15.592 --> 02:02:18.717
It's actually part of two of our pillars.

02:02:18.757 --> 02:02:30.051
There's the censorship industrial complex, which contains not only the elimination of the right to speak of people, but also the control of information.

02:02:31.492 --> 02:02:36.794
in which things are claimed to be factual or claimed to be false for no reason.

02:02:37.154 --> 02:02:57.281
But this also is connected to the academic industrial complex in which institutions that were once dedicated to fearless truth-seeking have now been so politicized that they will actually make claims that experts in the field should full well know are false, for example, that men can simply become women.

02:02:58.281 --> 02:03:11.348
And we need institutions that are capable of doing scientific work and establishing things to the best of their ability, irrespective of whether or not that favors the powerful.

02:03:12.049 --> 02:03:26.597
And so he's not anywhere near explaining what I'm trying to explain with Biology 101 and Uncertainty 101, that knowledge can be falsely created using the scientific method that is employed in academic circles.

02:03:27.671 --> 02:03:39.741
The testing of null hypotheses and the use of p-values in these logical constructs can create the illusion of knowledge upon which most of biomedical science is based.

02:03:39.801 --> 02:03:41.943
And he's not capable of saying that.

02:03:42.003 --> 02:03:45.786
He just says that, you know, some of these institutions are politicized.

02:03:48.828 --> 02:03:51.631
It's amazing how many words he can use and say nothing.

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:52.671
Or it doesn't.

02:03:53.252 --> 02:03:55.654
So anyway, this is core to our mission.

02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.790
Well, not not.

02:03:56.970 --> 02:03:58.291
I have to push back a little.

02:03:58.331 --> 02:04:01.195
Not only can men become women, but they become much better women.

02:04:01.215 --> 02:04:08.362
I don't know if you watch boxing in the Olympics, but they win awards that they and they're setting track records and swim record their fat.

02:04:08.402 --> 02:04:11.926
They're much better women than than the women that I knew.

02:04:11.946 --> 02:04:15.330
But anyway, so this freedom of speech.

02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:16.151
Here's the thing.

02:04:17.836 --> 02:04:22.817
People, many people, it's like we have to keep teaching people the same lesson.

02:04:23.598 --> 02:04:26.098
Freedom of speech isn't there for speech we all like.

02:04:26.618 --> 02:04:29.939
Freedom of speech is there for speech that may be abhorrent to us.

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.400
Maybe that's even me, like speech that I can't stand and hate.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.421
When I grew up in Chicago,

02:04:36.641 --> 02:04:42.146
The Nazis used to march through Skokie, which is a big Jewish neighborhood, and they were trying to provoke people.

02:04:42.727 --> 02:04:48.091
And of course, the ACLU would go to court for their right to free speech, and they were allowed to march.

02:04:48.712 --> 02:04:51.454
This was documented actually in the Blues Brothers, right?

02:04:52.495 --> 02:04:55.858
They had the Nazis from Skokie in the Blues Brothers movie.

02:04:56.698 --> 02:05:04.145
And we looked at that as a celebration of the United States' free speech and First Amendment rights, and we didn't see that as a negative.

02:05:04.385 --> 02:05:06.807
We could go and counter-protest them.

02:05:07.628 --> 02:05:10.710
So today we find a very similar thing, but the people

02:05:11.551 --> 02:05:14.793
who you think would be for freedom of speech are now against.

02:05:14.853 --> 02:05:23.477
So the Democrats, I was a Democrat my whole life up until 2016, and the Democrats, they're all for censorship.

02:05:23.497 --> 02:05:25.237
They call it content moderation.

02:05:25.377 --> 02:05:31.600
That's what Don Lemon said to Elon Musk, content moderation, which is just called censoring people.

02:05:32.361 --> 02:05:34.422
And now you see on college campuses,

02:05:36.422 --> 02:05:51.307
You see Democrats trying to suppress the pro- whether you agree with the people who are pro-Palestine, protesters or not, they should have a right to speak, correct?

02:05:52.827 --> 02:05:54.168
I mean, that's a blanket thing.

02:05:54.248 --> 02:05:58.869
Even if you are, you know, you think they're terrorists or you think they're... What do you say to that?

02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:03.150
Well, I would argue... Everybody has a right to free speech.

02:06:04.551 --> 02:06:04.991
Go ahead, Brett.

02:06:05.219 --> 02:06:11.523
Yes, it's very simple and laid out eloquently in our founding documents.

02:06:11.683 --> 02:06:19.428
And I would point out that one of the things that makes the Republic so special is that the founders... In our founding documents.

02:06:19.468 --> 02:06:23.851
He's talking about his website, of course.

02:06:23.871 --> 02:06:28.614
...are very careful to protect counterintuitive principles.

02:06:28.875 --> 02:06:30.135
It's what makes the place run.

02:06:31.058 --> 02:06:36.166
Why should people who say abhorrent things have the right to say them?

02:06:37.165 --> 02:06:44.288
because there is no other way to protect things that are not yet commonplace and embraced that need to be said.

02:06:44.448 --> 02:06:50.170
You have to protect speech that is abhorrent in order to protect the speech that you most need.

02:06:50.571 --> 02:06:54.852
And this touches- In case you missed it, Mickey Willis is the screen name he's using here.

02:06:55.393 --> 02:06:59.174
So I don't know if that means he's on his laptop or what, but I just find it extraordinary.

02:06:59.394 --> 02:07:04.897
On another one of our pillars, a rejection of so-called lawfare.

02:07:05.797 --> 02:07:11.243
The fact is the founders were understandably terrified of egregious government.

02:07:11.403 --> 02:07:17.690
One of my viewers actually pointed out that Aaron Siri takes advantage of the CIP and the VICP.

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:27.581
It's a very nice place to work as a lawyer because that's one of the only legal spaces in which you are paid as you work, not whether you win the case or not.

02:07:29.054 --> 02:07:38.391
And a nice viewer of Giggle and Biological pointed out that actually the only other lawyers that get paid like that are working for the Department of Justice.

02:07:42.339 --> 02:07:42.859
overreach.

02:07:43.019 --> 02:07:47.340
And so what they did is they actually hobbled the state in court.

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.201
Why should the state be hobbled?

02:07:49.401 --> 02:07:54.262
When you're arrested, why should the state face such a tremendous burden in prosecuting you?

02:07:54.782 --> 02:08:00.623
Because if they don't have that tremendous burden, the advantages that they have will be abused, which is exactly what we are seeing.

02:08:01.083 --> 02:08:08.945
So just as you have seen the inversion of the Democratic Party to which you and I are and were both members,

02:08:09.645 --> 02:08:14.648
This is the inversion of the values that our society is rightly based on.

02:08:15.549 --> 02:08:22.093
Well, I, you know, I even say in my act that I've stayed the same.

02:08:22.313 --> 02:08:22.994
It's the Democrat.

02:08:23.054 --> 02:08:24.355
I didn't leave the Democratic Party.

02:08:24.375 --> 02:08:24.955
They left me.

02:08:24.995 --> 02:08:26.896
I've always been for bodily autonomy.

02:08:27.497 --> 02:08:28.377
They're not anymore.

02:08:28.437 --> 02:08:33.621
They're for mandating experimental medical treatments, which is the opposite of bodily autonomy.

02:08:33.681 --> 02:08:35.682
Now, that's why they say they're not pro choice anymore.

02:08:36.343 --> 02:08:37.864
Many of them say they're pro abortion.

02:08:38.504 --> 02:08:42.146
Which, that's a shocking term to me.

02:08:42.426 --> 02:08:43.927
I was always pro-choice.

02:08:44.027 --> 02:08:47.989
The red pill, blue pill argument is so silly and so lame.

02:08:48.029 --> 02:08:51.451
And I used to be a Democrat is what all these clowns are saying.

02:08:51.511 --> 02:08:53.192
And it just doesn't make any sense.

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:57.695
If you used to be a Democrat, then you used to be an idiot.

02:08:57.895 --> 02:09:07.200
And if you think that talking about becoming a Republican now or a unity party is, I mean, then you're, only a fool would say that.

02:09:09.002 --> 02:09:11.963
It's always for keeping the government out from in between a doctor and a patient.

02:09:12.303 --> 02:09:16.484
But to be pro abortion to me, it sounds like, you know, I'm pro amputation.

02:09:16.704 --> 02:09:19.345
You know, it's like, oh, let's all celebrate that somebody gets.

02:09:19.445 --> 02:09:20.706
No, it's like it's anyway.

02:09:21.266 --> 02:09:22.746
They talk about abortion like it's Christmas.

02:09:22.826 --> 02:09:23.347
It's crazy.

02:09:23.387 --> 02:09:26.548
But I've always been for bodily autonomy.

02:09:26.588 --> 02:09:28.248
I've always been for anti-war peace.

02:09:28.308 --> 02:09:30.329
I've always been for for free speech.

02:09:31.409 --> 02:09:34.910
And now if you're for those things, they call you a right winger.

02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:42.252
Like if I was against the Ukraine war and I called a right winger or a Putin puppet, I'm for bodily autonomy.

02:09:42.292 --> 02:09:44.632
They call me a right winger and an anti-vaxxer.

02:09:45.153 --> 02:09:46.213
And I'm for free speech.

02:09:46.293 --> 02:09:47.413
I did the same thing.

02:09:47.433 --> 02:09:48.393
They call me a right winger.

02:09:48.613 --> 02:09:50.154
You're a free speech absolutist.

02:09:51.534 --> 02:09:55.495
Yes, I've never heard that term before, but yes, I I certainly am.

02:09:55.876 --> 02:10:04.138
So that's the that's the weird thing that the Democratic Party is now morphed into being the party of the George Bush, Dick Cheney Republicans.

02:10:05.018 --> 02:10:06.799
And it's absolutely.

02:10:07.059 --> 02:10:13.221
And and this is kind of a response to that, right, because there's nobody left to kind of fight for these things in government.

02:10:14.622 --> 02:10:19.043
I think what we've seen is kind of like how you've described the Democrats left you.

02:10:20.258 --> 02:10:31.403
And I think this also is a little bit related to the reactions and the language around the January 6th riots, that they have a very intense reverence for these institutions.

02:10:31.863 --> 02:10:45.488
And it doesn't matter where the institutions take things, mandating medical treatments, criminalizing certain types of speech, weaponizing the judicial system, that's what the institution does and they worship at its altar.

02:10:46.008 --> 02:10:49.070
And so we're trying to level set and say like these,

02:10:51.141 --> 02:11:08.783
It's like an, it's a greater, it's an umbrella of industrial complexes, and it's taken over these institutions, and we cannot worship institution, we need to stand and recenter ourselves around the pillars of the things that make the broader Western civilization, the Republic, great.

02:11:10.021 --> 02:11:15.046
So the broader Western civilization is the Republic or is America the Republic?

02:11:15.146 --> 02:11:21.171
And then she's talking about the broader Western civilization as being a product of America's existence.

02:11:21.952 --> 02:11:25.676
I'm not hearing very accurate language here that sounds like patriotism.

02:11:25.736 --> 02:11:28.178
It sounds more like an enchantment from the globalists.

02:11:28.318 --> 02:11:31.722
We love about the West, not the things that we hate.

02:11:32.162 --> 02:11:36.248
So I find it shockingly bizarre.

02:11:36.268 --> 02:11:42.738
You know, the West includes Spain and Spain takes siestas still, you know, like I don't I don't know.

02:11:42.758 --> 02:11:44.281
I don't like this at all.

02:11:44.821 --> 02:11:46.203
I don't like it at all.

02:11:47.427 --> 02:12:09.822
I really hear traitors here are that the mainstream news media for four years while Trump was president and now they're saying it again is saying that he's going to prosecute his political opponents and he's going to use the justice system and weaponize it against his political opponents even though he didn't he was president for four years and he never locked up Hillary Clinton or did any of that stuff

02:12:10.362 --> 02:12:27.137
and then as soon as he loses the election in 2020 they immediately start prosecuting him and they're doing it on the most and so I even I had Cornel West on my show and I tried to point out to him that they use the same Rico statue which is supposed to be for

02:12:28.178 --> 02:12:47.533
the the mafia that's why everybody was okay with it it's supposed to just be used against the mafia they use the same rico statute and the same grand jury to prosecute donald trump as they did to prosecute stop cop city protesters which people protesting the expansion of so while we're talking about nonsense here i'll try to inject something a little more thoughtful

02:12:48.554 --> 02:13:00.102
and conspicuously missing from their definition of the West that Daniel Hayes and other people, free mayonnaise, we all have an idea of what the West is.

02:13:02.183 --> 02:13:09.808
One of my more recent meetings with somebody influential has been with G. Edward Griffin.

02:13:10.188 --> 02:13:14.571
And in talking to him and listening to him at the Red Pill Conference,

02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:30.815
I liked this explanation that it is mostly at the 30,000 foot level about collectivism versus individualism and individualism believes that the state

02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:53.097
The role of the state is to make it possible for individuals to reach their full potential without interference and with all the resources and things that they need, and that that's how society will succeed, is by empowering the individual, cherishing the individual, and all that the individual can bring.

02:13:53.777 --> 02:13:57.639
Now, that's independent of religion and whatever.

02:13:57.679 --> 02:14:14.265
This is just the idea that an individual person, a sovereign person, is a divine, sacred, irreducible complexity, not a lab experiment, not an animal, not a sheep, not a useless eater.

02:14:17.972 --> 02:14:28.099
And I think that Bret Weinstein is working for people who see us as useless eaters and see themselves as those who are destined to govern us.

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:32.763
Much in the same way that this language is used in these books.

02:14:34.104 --> 02:14:35.625
The same exact language.

02:14:35.979 --> 02:14:36.639
the police state.

02:14:37.379 --> 02:14:42.161
And when I said that to Cornel West, he said, I look like I like Trump more than I'm letting on.

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:46.442
Like he pretended that he couldn't see the connection between what was happening.

02:14:46.482 --> 02:14:57.786
And what's happening is that the establishment, not just in the United States, but the billionaire class that run the Western world, if you go against them, they will immediately throw you in prison now and use lawfare against you.

02:14:57.806 --> 02:14:59.666
They did it to Imran Khan in Pakistan.

02:14:59.706 --> 02:15:03.567
He came out and said, the people of Pakistan don't want to go along with NATO's wars.

02:15:03.587 --> 02:15:04.188
We want peace.

02:15:04.488 --> 02:15:05.368
He's in jail now.

02:15:05.988 --> 02:15:08.970
OK, then they did it to Lulu in Brazil.

02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:13.612
And so then they thought the center right guy, they put Lulu in prison.

02:15:13.752 --> 02:15:13.932
Right.

02:15:13.992 --> 02:15:17.434
He was running for president and they thought the center right guy was going to win.

02:15:17.574 --> 02:15:19.735
But then the far right guy, Bolsonaro, won.

02:15:19.755 --> 02:15:21.216
And they're like, oh, what do we do?

02:15:21.696 --> 02:15:27.139
So the only way they could fix that was they had to let Lulu back out of prison because he's the old Lula.

02:15:27.339 --> 02:15:27.559
Right.

02:15:27.659 --> 02:15:28.039
Lula.

02:15:28.159 --> 02:15:29.420
I say Lulu Lula.

02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:51.785
Back out of prison because he's the only one who could beat Bolsonaro and then as soon as he beats him Bolsonaro they criminalize him and make him he can never be able to run again for president now They're doing the same thing to Donald Trump And I tried to make the case to corner West that if they can do this to a former president of the United States right out in the open they'll do it to anybody who that well I did it to Julian Assange and

02:15:52.225 --> 02:16:11.011
Edward Snowden and they'll do it to Cornel West if he ever becomes a threat to the establishment or Bernie Sanders or anybody that does that and that's what is and they're doing it right out in the open and and everybody seems to pretend it's not happening they're still saying that Donald Trump is the one who's going to do it even is it that kind of mind-blowing?

02:16:13.112 --> 02:16:14.952
Yes they're utterly shameless.

02:16:16.073 --> 02:16:16.673
Sorry Angela.

02:16:17.333 --> 02:16:20.674
Yeah you're you're correct I mean they're they're utterly shameless

02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:23.830
It's like the, what is the 1984 quote?

02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:24.730
The party told you.

02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:30.192
To ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears, it was their final and most essential command.

02:16:30.792 --> 02:16:31.232
There you go.

02:16:31.413 --> 02:16:32.533
We're living it right now.

02:16:32.553 --> 02:16:42.416
I mean, we're trying to not live it, but there are millions of people out there who are living it and we want to help them wake up and we want to give them a place to go to.

02:16:43.237 --> 02:16:48.218
And, you know, values to reference that are outside of strictly party politics.

02:16:48.979 --> 02:16:50.079
You know what we're pushing up.

02:16:50.620 --> 02:17:02.009
I'd like to say is a real unity movement where dissident left, dissident right, libertarians, independents can all come together and say, you know, like, we love free speech.

02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:03.170
We love these values.

02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:06.512
We want to usher in a return to truth seeking and open dialogue.

02:17:06.833 --> 02:17:10.816
We reject lawfare and weaponization of the judicial system.

02:17:11.496 --> 02:17:12.997
You know what was- And I would add- Go ahead.

02:17:13.057 --> 02:17:13.538
Oh, sorry.

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:14.138
No, go right ahead.

02:17:14.218 --> 02:17:18.882
I would add that we are providing a venue where that

02:17:19.415 --> 02:17:40.200
unity movement can come together, but we also need people to show up because, let's be frank, an entity as powerful as we are faced with, that is willing to cheat on every front that we can see, cannot be trusted to leave the election free and fair.

02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:45.561
So if we are to retake and rescue the republic,

02:17:46.181 --> 02:17:52.304
We need to win this election by a decisive enough margin to overcome the capacity to cheat.

02:17:52.644 --> 02:18:01.429
It needs to become clear how many of us there are, how much we agree on, and that we understand the severity of the threat.

02:18:01.949 --> 02:18:12.994
So the way to do that is to show up in Washington between the Washington Monument and the World War II Memorial on September 29th and lend us your voice.

02:18:14.415 --> 02:18:33.798
So the thing that was most encouraging to me was when Bobby Kennedy dropped out of the race and he endorsed Donald Trump and he went to a rally, a Trump rally in Arizona and it was a stadium full of people and I had just come from a stadium full of people in Chicago who were cheering on corruption and more war.

02:18:35.259 --> 02:18:38.060
And it made me, you know, depressed.

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:48.745
And so when I watched Bobby give that speech at Trump's rally, and he was talking about ending the war and investing that money back here, and people cheered.

02:18:49.166 --> 02:18:52.167
And he was talking about environmentalism, and people cheered.

02:18:52.187 --> 02:18:55.629
He was talking about getting the poison out of our food system, and people cheered.

02:18:55.649 --> 02:18:58.490
He was talking about taking on Big Agra, and people cheered.

02:18:58.510 --> 02:19:00.912
He was talking about getting the corruption out of the,

02:19:02.132 --> 02:19:05.575
the corporate captured regulatory agencies, and people cheered.

02:19:05.615 --> 02:19:09.017
I'm like, that's all stuff that I could cheer for, and that's happening.

02:19:09.077 --> 02:19:22.907
So whether you believe that Donald Trump is sincere or not about those things, the thing that's encouraging was that there was a stadium full of Republican presidential voters who were cheering on the same things I would cheer on.

02:19:23.667 --> 02:19:29.030
And that just goes to show you that the establishment wants us divided, right?

02:19:29.410 --> 02:19:33.052
And that's why they want us to always be suspicious of our neighbor.

02:19:33.452 --> 02:19:36.654
Our neighbor's a white supremacist or a Nazi or a communist.

02:19:37.114 --> 02:19:41.857
And you got to be, they are fomenting the division in this country.

02:19:41.897 --> 02:19:47.200
But it was something like that made me realize that we have way more in common that divides us.

02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:54.906
We all agree on so many things and I'll join with anybody, as Frederick Douglass said, I'll join with anyone to do good and no one to do bad.

02:19:55.266 --> 02:20:00.810
So if they are serious about doing those things, I'll join with them and I'll join with that stadium full of people to do those things.

02:20:00.890 --> 02:20:03.072
Unfortunately, I never hear anything.

02:20:03.832 --> 02:20:05.974
ever coming out of the Democratic Party.

02:20:06.334 --> 02:20:10.698
When was the last time you heard a Democrat talk about the captured regulatory agencies?

02:20:10.738 --> 02:20:13.420
When was the last time you heard a Democrat say we have to end the wars?

02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:18.664
They talk about starting them and funding them and standing up and having the most lethal force.

02:20:19.104 --> 02:20:20.165
It's the craziest thing.

02:20:21.026 --> 02:20:26.430
So is that what, Brett, you as a former Democrat, was that encouraging to you to see?

02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:29.550
Oh my goodness, it was beautiful.

02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:37.374
The embrace of Kennedy by these people who you would not imagine were Kennedy Democrats, it really sent the message.

02:20:37.534 --> 02:20:49.139
And I think for all of those of us who have ventured into this unity space, it's hard to convey how... It's hard to convey how

02:20:50.734 --> 02:21:00.903
hypocritical it is that he says that he was so moved to see people from all sides of the aisle embrace Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:02.023 --> 02:21:05.326
When Brett Weinstein interviewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:05.486 --> 02:21:16.856
in his home in November of 2021, and didn't have the principle, or the cojones, or the guts, or whatever you want to call it,

02:21:18.086 --> 02:21:24.449
to release the video until the middle of 2023, almost 14 months later.

02:21:25.629 --> 02:21:29.051
So he was really moved by the contents of that interview.

02:21:29.191 --> 02:21:45.618
So moved by the three hours he spent intimately talking to a guy whose dad worked with his dad, maybe was even his dad's boss, never mentioned their dads and didn't release the video for 14 months.

02:21:48.749 --> 02:21:54.556
But Bret Weinstein is a patriot just trying to get to the truth.

02:21:55.096 --> 02:21:57.079
Fearless truth seeker.

02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:59.001
Stop lying!

02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:11.969
good it feels to be among people who are ready to partner for this most important mission.

02:22:12.770 --> 02:22:19.637
It really feels good to not be petty about ideology and to recognize that we have a shared

02:22:20.518 --> 02:22:27.180
purpose and it doesn't, you know, this really is the inclusive movement that the Democratic Party pretends to be.

02:22:27.561 --> 02:22:31.322
The Democratic Party has actually now become the party of racism.

02:22:31.642 --> 02:22:37.744
If you want to feel that inclusive thing, it's in this unity movement, which yes, contains MAGA, right?

02:22:38.104 --> 02:22:40.625
It's not synonymous with MAGA, but MAGA is there.

02:22:41.226 --> 02:22:47.448
And as you saw those people cheering on Bobby Kennedy, that's what it feels like to be amongst people with a shared purpose.

02:22:48.484 --> 02:22:48.964
Absolutely.

02:22:48.984 --> 02:22:50.926
I think, you know, Jimmy, you were present.

02:22:51.926 --> 02:22:52.206
Really?

02:22:52.587 --> 02:22:57.510
We used to have that happen all the time at bars where a good band played or at church.

02:22:59.391 --> 02:23:04.594
Or, you know, when a when a basketball game is being played and your team wins or, you know.

02:23:06.476 --> 02:23:10.578
Bret Weinstein is one of their charlatans, Bret Weinstein works for the slavers.

02:23:11.899 --> 02:23:14.601
Like one of the origin stories of this broader

02:23:15.595 --> 02:23:24.542
unity movement at the first Rage Against the War Machine rally, which was a coming together of the dissident left and libertarians and independents.

02:23:25.543 --> 02:23:31.968
And, you know, I viewed my job as chair of the National Libertarian Party as to continue that and to grow it.

02:23:32.708 --> 02:23:42.696
And so I want to see those relationships included in this movement and for us to continue to be sort of the guide rails on individual liberties and safeguarding of that.

02:23:43.336 --> 02:23:48.525
We're having another Rage Against the War Machine rally, by the way, the day before Rescue the Republic in the same spot.

02:23:49.006 --> 02:23:52.291
So we encourage everybody to just come on out for rally weekend.

02:23:52.331 --> 02:23:55.196
It's gonna be an epic weekend of events in Washington, D.C.

02:23:56.562 --> 02:23:59.105
So I remember Rage Against the War Machine.

02:23:59.145 --> 02:24:00.226
It was a great time.

02:24:00.847 --> 02:24:08.315
It was great to be around people who were united, even though we have political differences, against war, especially.

02:24:10.377 --> 02:24:16.224
What was interesting to me is the people who are, whose whole life is about being anti-war, who didn't show up at that.

02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:18.749
And I'm speaking about Code Pink.

02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:31.638
And it was really interesting because they disagreed with some of the speakers on stage and some of their other political beliefs, whether it be about LGBTQ or something else.

02:24:32.098 --> 02:24:34.520
They said, we can't participate because we don't agree with them.

02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:37.322
And it's like, well, that's the whole point of that's what gives it power.

02:24:37.362 --> 02:24:41.284
When you can unite with people you disagree with politically, you knuckleheads.

02:24:41.825 --> 02:24:44.847
It's like, oh, I want to stop a nuclear war, but not with those people.

02:24:44.987 --> 02:24:46.628
It's like it's the craziest.

02:24:48.068 --> 02:25:02.693
I would say, I know that the People's Party and some of the people, the thought leaders on the dissident left took a lot of flack for organizing and working with me, the Libertarian Party, especially the Mises Caucus Libertarian Party.

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:05.114
I want to extend the invitation again.

02:25:05.694 --> 02:25:06.795
I don't care what you think of me.

02:25:07.395 --> 02:25:08.996
I don't care if you think I'm an evil whatever.

02:25:09.136 --> 02:25:13.137
I genuinely, I believe in the anti-war effort and movement.

02:25:13.815 --> 02:25:25.025
members of Code Pink, Medea, Benjamin, especially, who I think is a total doll and does an amazing job confronting some of these scumbag operatives in the deep state, come out.

02:25:25.645 --> 02:25:28.628
Even if you don't wanna speak, if you don't wanna have an official presence, come out.

02:25:28.928 --> 02:25:36.755
We want you there, and we love and value the work that you do, just like everybody else who's on the left pushing for the anti-war solution.

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:40.438
We want people who believe in peace at our events,

02:25:40.993 --> 02:25:42.574
on Saturday and on Sunday.

02:25:42.654 --> 02:25:50.299
If you think Sunday might sound a little too right wing, like we've got Russell Brand, we've got left wingers there because this is for everyone.

02:25:50.559 --> 02:25:52.340
This is like, you belong.

02:25:54.221 --> 02:25:58.062
Yeah, I consider myself on the left always.

02:25:58.102 --> 02:25:59.343
Like I said, I haven't changed.

02:25:59.423 --> 02:26:01.504
I've always been for Medicare for all.

02:26:01.544 --> 02:26:05.845
I've been for freedom of speech, bodily autonomy, anti-racism.

02:26:07.586 --> 02:26:11.747
I'm sure there's a couple of things I'm leaving out, but I've been consistent and I haven't changed.

02:26:11.787 --> 02:26:12.747
Sounds very right wing.

02:26:13.027 --> 02:26:15.048
And now I'm considered right wing.

02:26:16.109 --> 02:26:16.549
It's funny.

02:26:18.029 --> 02:26:23.031
Well, I really anything else you you'd like to add before I say goodbye?

02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:26.150
Donate.

02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.831
Donate.

02:26:26.931 --> 02:26:28.332
Donate.

02:26:28.432 --> 02:26:29.152
It's a ton of work.

02:26:29.192 --> 02:26:29.773
Donate.

02:26:29.833 --> 02:26:30.893
It's a lot of work.

02:26:30.933 --> 02:26:33.475
We're all really suffering a lot.

02:26:34.155 --> 02:26:35.376
And we got canceled.

02:26:35.516 --> 02:26:36.497
It's very rewarding.

02:26:36.737 --> 02:26:44.622
And I'm really looking forward to seeing this large gathering of this most important movement.

02:26:44.642 --> 02:26:45.923
And as Angela said,

02:26:47.924 --> 02:26:49.465
Everybody is welcome.

02:26:49.865 --> 02:26:56.329
If you look at our pillars and you resonate with them, which if you're a patriot, you almost certainly will.

02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:58.570
There's nothing you will disagree with on that list.

02:26:59.030 --> 02:27:03.853
If you look at that list, this is your gathering and you should come to it.

02:27:04.193 --> 02:27:12.338
The only people who shouldn't come to it are people who are interested in rigging the system or people who are interested in breaking the law

02:27:13.278 --> 02:27:14.679
violence, or bigotry.

02:27:14.879 --> 02:27:16.080
Those people are not welcome.

02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:19.402
Everybody else is, and I think they'll be very glad that they showed up.

02:27:20.342 --> 02:27:26.726
I did a show in May in Los Angeles at the Zephyr Theater, and it was a live video show.

02:27:26.766 --> 02:27:30.608
And anyway, I have a broad audience, and so I had some MAGA people sitting.

02:27:30.628 --> 02:27:40.534
Hey, Jimmy, you did a show in Pennsylvania earlier this year where we met in person, and I took pictures with you, and I also gave you a book with a lot of this detailed in it.

02:27:41.601 --> 02:27:45.859
You should give me a call because Dan Cohen also gave you my number and all my digits.

02:27:47.526 --> 02:27:52.949
And so you guys really should give me a call and let me give you a little breakdown about what's really going on here.

02:27:52.989 --> 02:27:55.410
That would be really smart for America.

02:27:55.550 --> 02:28:00.912
In the front, and I had some socialists, well, Marxists, as they self-described.

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:04.794
And I know they were Marxists because the guy handed me two books on his way out.

02:28:04.834 --> 02:28:05.894
They always travel with books.

02:28:06.374 --> 02:28:11.997
And they were having kind of an argument because it's a raucous event at our shows.

02:28:12.217 --> 02:28:14.578
And they were kind of yelling at each other and arguing.

02:28:15.259 --> 02:28:22.168
And then the Marxists went and got into the MAGA guy's face and I was like, oh no, this is going to get violent.

02:28:22.488 --> 02:28:23.990
And the next thing I know, they were hugging.

02:28:25.692 --> 02:28:29.677
So I guess maybe they were talking about the Federal Reserve and they agreed.

02:28:29.938 --> 02:28:30.799
And anyway, so.

02:28:32.821 --> 02:28:44.189
That's kind of the message of my show, that we have a common enemy and that enemy is the oligarchy and it's not each other, but they want us to turn on each other.

02:28:45.130 --> 02:28:49.653
I think we need more events like this to happen.

02:28:50.694 --> 02:28:56.378
We need to take back our government and give it back to the people because it's in the hands of a handful of donors

02:28:56.718 --> 02:29:04.540
I mean, right now the Democratic Party is running the most unpopular person ever to run for president and was the most unpopular vice president.

02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:10.281
She couldn't get a vote when she ran in 2020, but she was the darling and the first choice of the donor class.

02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:12.081
They'd anointed her on Martha's Vineyard.

02:29:12.501 --> 02:29:14.861
And then she went to the primary and couldn't get a vote.

02:29:15.282 --> 02:29:19.662
And then they forced her on Joe Biden, made her the vice president, most unpopular vice president in history.

02:29:20.022 --> 02:29:21.203
Even Jimmy Kimmel said that.

02:29:21.883 --> 02:29:21.983
And

02:29:23.243 --> 02:29:26.866
and now we're supposed to believe she's the most popular candidate in the race.

02:29:27.487 --> 02:29:29.148
I don't believe it.

02:29:29.189 --> 02:29:38.137
And when I was at the Democratic convention, nobody seemed to mind that they threw out 14 million votes for Joe Biden and nobody voted for her.

02:29:39.258 --> 02:29:40.599
And who chose her?

02:29:40.699 --> 02:29:41.440
The donor class.

02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:42.000
And who's that?

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.823
That's the military industrial complex in Wall Street.

02:29:45.263 --> 02:29:45.884
Big oil.

02:29:46.084 --> 02:29:48.206
I mean, it's the people we're supposed to be fighting against.

02:29:49.087 --> 02:30:03.303
as Democrats, and they just installed her as a puppet, and I think the transformation of the Democratic Party into the party of George Bush Dick Cheney is complete, except they have a gay pride flag.

02:30:03.743 --> 02:30:04.704
That's the only difference.

02:30:05.915 --> 02:30:11.219
Why is that except Dick Cheney's daughter is a lesbian isn't she like she has no kids.

02:30:11.279 --> 02:30:12.780
What are we talking about here?

02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:30.473
Yes, what's all window dressing and you don't have to be a supporter of You know, I don't endorse Donald Trump for president But like I said when I saw that speech that Bobby gave at his rally, I I will help to work for all those things right so

02:30:31.253 --> 02:30:36.156
And you don't have to be someone endorsing Donald Trump to endorse these things.

02:30:36.917 --> 02:30:40.079
I think these are just common sense things that we all have to get behind.

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:42.781
War is always the last resort.

02:30:42.821 --> 02:30:43.421
How about that?

02:30:43.581 --> 02:30:44.762
End lawfare and abuse.

02:30:45.463 --> 02:30:47.544
Sanctify, recodify, inform consent.

02:30:48.285 --> 02:30:49.806
Secure the monetary freedom.

02:30:50.166 --> 02:30:52.487
I'm a big crypto person.

02:30:52.527 --> 02:31:00.433
I think that we got to watch out for digital IDs and the centralized digital currency is not a good idea.

02:31:01.573 --> 02:31:04.314
So all those things I think are fantastic.

02:31:04.354 --> 02:31:08.015
I think anybody who's, these are like common sense proposals.

02:31:08.035 --> 02:31:09.936
I as a lefty can endorse all of them.

02:31:10.656 --> 02:31:12.737
And so that's why I'm going to be part of this.

02:31:14.678 --> 02:31:17.619
And I just want to say thanks for setting this up and thanks for inviting me.

02:31:18.259 --> 02:31:20.700
And thanks for your leadership, both of you on this.

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:23.961
And I appreciate you coming on to tell us about it.

02:31:25.387 --> 02:31:25.687
Thanks.

02:31:25.807 --> 02:31:29.091
Let's begin rescuing the Republic on September 29th.

02:31:29.611 --> 02:31:31.573
And what is the website people should go to?

02:31:32.574 --> 02:31:34.636
It's jointheresistance.org.

02:31:35.157 --> 02:31:36.318
Okay, jointheresistance.

02:31:36.338 --> 02:31:41.103
I think it's actually, I think it's, okay, jointheresistance.org.

02:31:41.363 --> 02:31:42.704
Okay, everybody check that out.

02:31:43.405 --> 02:31:45.347
All right, Angela, Brett, I appreciate it.

02:31:45.427 --> 02:31:46.248
We'll talk to you both.

02:31:47.409 --> 02:31:51.691
It's really disappointing to see how far they haven't come in five years.

02:31:51.751 --> 02:31:54.852
It's really disappointing to see that Jimmy can't seem to see through it.

02:31:56.553 --> 02:32:00.555
We do need a new consensus about these things, ladies and gentlemen, we definitely do.

02:32:02.215 --> 02:32:15.181
We need a new consensus about the fact that they expected the all cause mortality to go up and that they use murder and lies to use that expectation to create the mythology surrounding the pandemic.

02:32:15.841 --> 02:32:22.403
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:32:22.823 --> 02:32:25.864
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:32:25.944 --> 02:32:35.387
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

02:32:35.407 --> 02:32:42.669
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines, right?

02:32:43.149 --> 02:32:56.500
So if you look back in time, you can see that even when they mentioned by name about transfections, they didn't really define transfections correctly and actually said that the transfection has some efficacy, it's just fading.

02:33:00.603 --> 02:33:07.149
And that was in 2022, almost a year and a half after I first told them to start calling it transfection and they didn't.

02:33:13.123 --> 02:33:16.906
And most of these people I told too to call it transfection and they didn't.

02:33:17.287 --> 02:33:24.493
I told them that infectious clones indeed were just transfection and transformation in cell culture and in animals.

02:33:24.733 --> 02:33:29.117
They are all ignoring it because they are part of this operation to mislead the young.

02:33:30.882 --> 02:33:38.348
That's why this list can be presented and it will not be discussed by any of these people.

02:33:38.408 --> 02:33:42.892
They won't talk about the background signals, the actuarial one, or the genetic one.

02:33:43.492 --> 02:33:50.879
They will not talk about the many ways that PCR on the academic bench is made to be highly accurate and how many of those methodologies

02:33:51.619 --> 02:33:55.983
were conspicuously absent from any COVID diagnostics.

02:33:56.483 --> 02:34:03.109
They will not talk about the many, many ways that even in the best case scenario, transfection was inappropriate.

02:34:03.569 --> 02:34:10.475
They will not talk about how these things had names before the pandemic, transformation and transfection was on Robert Malone's resume.

02:34:11.396 --> 02:34:18.242
And they could have called them that from the beginning and then this would have been informed consent and people would have known not to take it.

02:34:20.066 --> 02:34:24.487
We, they still won't define the term infectious clone in the virology literature.

02:34:24.627 --> 02:34:33.510
Even the no virus people won't point out that the infectious clone term in the virology literature simply means transfection and transformation in cell culture.

02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:34.990
They won't say it.

02:34:36.631 --> 02:34:48.394
Just like they won't say that RNA cannot pandemic because these people are part of a maneuver to titrate us to the truth, to eventually cop to the fact that the vaccine schedule was crap.

02:34:49.642 --> 02:34:57.625
And the new one will be tested by Bobby Kennedy and his new department of public health or something like that.

02:34:57.685 --> 02:35:04.568
And they won't talk about endemicity, even though it was the worst case scenario before the pandemic.

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:10.551
It was the worst case scenario on Brett Weinstein's podcast when Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone came out.

02:35:12.022 --> 02:35:26.502
They won't talk about it because they have no data about this endemicity before 2020, which means you can't differentiate from endemicity in a background signal that was always there and they are confounding with spread.

02:35:27.343 --> 02:35:28.524
And once you realize,

02:35:29.338 --> 02:35:37.185
that they knew more people were going to die, and they knew the background signal was there, then you don't really need any explanations.

02:35:37.285 --> 02:35:38.466
It's just a theater.

02:35:38.967 --> 02:35:43.351
And that's why these people are so certain now, and were so certain in 2020.

02:35:44.291 --> 02:35:51.338
Because they have always been part of the theater, reading a limited script, sticking to a limited script to sell their book,

02:35:52.881 --> 02:35:55.642
And that's why the murder and lies will not be discussed.

02:35:55.683 --> 02:36:02.806
That's why those words won't be used because they are part of a national security operation that's covering up these facts with murder and lies.

02:36:03.547 --> 02:36:08.869
And if you liked what you saw, ladies and gentlemen, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

02:36:08.889 --> 02:36:18.995
And if you're gonna share this after the work, please go to stream.gigaohm.bio slash home, where you can find all the links to all the things that we're doing and all the stuff that we're putting out.

02:36:19.795 --> 02:36:25.298
including the reading for Biology 101, the new schedule that's actually live and we're going to keep to.

02:36:26.178 --> 02:36:29.560
So if you see a stream and you see a time on the schedule, we're going to do it.

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.441
And otherwise, we're going to take it off the schedule.

02:36:31.841 --> 02:36:35.102
We haven't been doing that lately, and we're doing that now for the first time.

02:36:35.142 --> 02:36:36.063
So that's really exciting.

02:36:36.103 --> 02:36:39.685
This was the first of many of such scheduled streams.

02:36:40.885 --> 02:36:46.788
And starting on Monday, I'm going to try very hard to give you an email update at least every week, if not more often than that.

02:36:47.268 --> 02:36:52.685
Thank you very much for joining me and I will enjoy myself at the gym with my boys and see you again tomorrow.

02:38:23.823 --> 02:38:23.943
Mm.

02:38:52.529 --> 02:38:53.271
Stop lying!

02:38:53.652 --> 02:38:56.841
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.
