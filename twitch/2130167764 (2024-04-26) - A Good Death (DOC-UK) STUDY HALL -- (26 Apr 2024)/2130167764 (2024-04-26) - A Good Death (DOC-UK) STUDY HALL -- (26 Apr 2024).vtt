00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm going to pause for just a second here and try to adjust one slide quick and then I'm going to get right back on it. I promise. Let me just adjust this one slide slide here, which I don't know why I didn't adjust it before. Where is it? Where did it go?

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Where did that slide go? Wait, I don't have that slide. Oh, yeah, here it is. Um.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
Hold on one second. Let me just adjust the slide. Sorry. Today is a good.

02:56.000 --> 03:06.000
Okay, I'm just sorry. I just had to, I, of course, I have to ruin everything with this, right? I have to.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm going to pause for just a second.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
I think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more than society.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie. You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:54.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm not sure exactly who he is. His name is J. J. Cooey. And I believe he's a consultant for CHD. And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific division.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It's a discipline from what I understand.

06:25.000 --> 06:40.000
It is not to be believed. They're still recommending it for children and for pregnant women. It is still just transfection. It is still just criminally negligent.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
But Arthur, I'm afraid they're going to keep on going and keep on going until every single one of us decides not to participate anymore.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
We're all going to have to be our little our own little Galileo.

06:54.000 --> 07:04.000
Or these ideas are going to keep spreading. And the truth will be distorted forever.

07:08.000 --> 07:23.000
It's all about your attention and where you place your conscious efforts. We've got to train our children better because these adults have been lying to them and us for a very, very long time.

07:25.000 --> 07:36.000
And we are now seemingly teaching our children that you can just attribute bad motives to the people you disagree with. Call them Nazis and the argument is one.

07:37.000 --> 07:46.000
And this is how they are winning with this biological nonsense, this mythology that they are pushing.

07:47.000 --> 08:01.000
It's also how they've been able to get away with enslaving us using fractional reserve banking that none of us have been aware of long enough to do anything about it.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And in fact, our entire lives are organized around it.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
You don't understand Mr. Brown.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
But some people are never going to see it. That's the problem. Even when they're shown that they're not going to see it because of people like Tony Fauci.

08:17.000 --> 08:28.000
And because of the billionaire class that still believes that their AI could solve all of humanity's problems if it was just given all the data.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
In the meantime, we have a history that we need to document.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
The people like Mark Koolak are some of the few people that are actually trying to document our history.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Not the Wikipedia version, not the omitted version, but the real version.

08:47.000 --> 08:59.000
Because our grandparents actually gave power to charlatans long ago and our parents accepted that power being in the hands of charlatans when they were young.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
And this has been passed on to us as well.

09:03.000 --> 09:13.000
And so in order for us to break out of this bamboozled man, we're going to have to take the power back from these charlatans who actually have it in their hands.

09:14.000 --> 09:23.000
Because our parents gave it to them. And more importantly, maybe for the story, some of their parents, their parents gave it to them.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Not everybody's parents were bad guys though. Not everybody's parents were bad guys though.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
And so we have to, some very complicated familial web of deception we need to cut through.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
And I honestly don't think very many people are trying as hard as Mark Koolak, or myself, and a few others.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Some guy by the name of Eret in Canada that's starting to catch my attention.

10:09.000 --> 10:34.000
I assure you, if I can do biology as well as that man can surf on his knees, I guess I probably wouldn't just be streaming online, but that's the way it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm your online biologist in the pocket. And if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
And where we stay focused on the biology, we don't take the bait on social media and we love our neighbors.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
The way it works is you guys are sharing this stream and people are finding it.

10:54.000 --> 11:04.000
And occasionally somebody subscribes and slowly but surely that list at the beginning of the stream is getting longer and that means my family is getting closer and closer to be okay.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
And we've got a lot of work to do. I've got a lot of work to do really. A lot of, I've got to put my money where my mouth was a long time ago.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
I haven't had a lot of, I haven't had a lot of sub-stack post lately, which is a very big ball drop there.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
So I'm apologizing to everyone, we're going to get some stuff done this weekend.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
It's hard just to keep a few balls in the air. That is the guy, Matthew Ered, Ered.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm interested in that guy. I might have him on the stream, although he seems a lot more well-read in books than I am not well-read in.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
He could easily bamboozle me, but what I've read from him, he's not into bamboozling folks, so that's great.

11:53.000 --> 12:04.000
Because this is really sustained through our active participation and we're going to need help getting out of it and united down to compliance is not something that's going to be easy to exercise unless we have the knowledge to back it up.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
And so I'm a human just like you and I'm trying to find my way out of this hole just like you.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
And I do believe that biology is that way out. So welcome to the show.

12:22.000 --> 12:51.000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the show. This is Giga Ohm Biological, a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

12:52.000 --> 13:11.000
On the 26th of April, 2024, I'm going to steal back that CBS Sunday morning horn that I used to use at the beginning of this stream a while back because I do think it's just a nice thing from my my child that I could so remember watching CBS Sunday morning.

13:11.000 --> 13:25.000
And most importantly, I remember the photo and video montages at the end of that show where they would show like sunrise on a marsh and all the sounds of the birds in the water would be in the background and then they would wish you a good morning.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
I want to start to have Giga Ohm Biological be more of something like that where I don't bring all the doom and gloom all the time.

13:34.000 --> 13:52.000
But start to, you know, again, focus on the exit of this cave. And in that sense, I still do have some very important messages to deliver including the intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
And also the transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
We do have a hypothesis that I also think is worth repeating many, many times.

14:03.000 --> 14:11.000
This little blip here that's at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and can be seen here in the upper graph.

14:11.000 --> 14:20.000
The upper graph is actually all cause mortality where you can see between 60 and 50,000 people every week die in America before the pandemic.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
And if we zoomed out a little farther, you would actually see that this line is actually sloping.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
It's sloping up toward this end of the graph here.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
And the reason why it would be sloping up is because there are more and more people in America every year.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
And so those more and more people, there's more and more people that are going to die every year.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
So that slope is actually something like this. It's like, you know, sloping up into the future.

14:47.000 --> 14:56.000
And so these bumps that were portrayed to us down here at the bottom is starting from zero were already very, very disingenuously portrayed.

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
Because again, there are a certain number of people that consistently die every year from what we label as pneumonia and influenza.

15:03.000 --> 15:11.000
And there are about 50 to 60,000 people, sometimes as many as 70,000 people every week dying in the winters during the flu season.

15:12.000 --> 15:26.000
And so again, the numbers that were on television and the way that they were portrayed were very disingenuous and they were disingenuous on purpose because again, the who had declared a pandemic of a novel virus for which we were all immune.

15:26.000 --> 15:38.000
And the who actually published the parameters by which we could test for it in terms of reverse transcriptase PCR reactions.

15:39.000 --> 15:54.000
And without any evidence that this background was clean without any evidence that the, that these tests would not bring up any background signals or overlap with any other signals that could be misconstrued as this novel virus.

15:54.000 --> 16:11.000
And they declared a pandemic and all the governments in Western culture Western society basically went along with it hook line and sinker and executed a plan that they had been rehearsing for several decades and fine tuning for several decades.

16:11.000 --> 16:27.000
And because this plan included financial incentives because this plan included a worst case scenario response to what could potentially be a billion people dead if we don't respond with the utmost urgency.

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
And we don't get 100% compliance and therefore, because it was a national security priority to get 100% compliance, they could use money.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
They could use coercion and they could use lying in order to do it because it was a national security thing.

16:44.000 --> 17:01.000
It is possible. And the technology does exist and it's called infectious clones that a RNA signal detectable by these molecular diagnostics and detectable by these sequencing technologies could have been present in these places around the globe.

17:01.000 --> 17:12.000
But if it was, and it was president high fidelity, the only way that could have occurred with the same RNA sequences if an infectious clone was used.

17:12.000 --> 17:30.000
Irrespective of how this theater was orchestrated. The reason why the theater was orchestrated is because of a preexisting plan to invert our sovereignty to permissions and to make sure that our populations and mass could be used as experimental

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
animals. So that these.

17:34.000 --> 17:49.000
Transfection technologies could finally be rolled out in the animals they were intended to be used in knowing all along that if we were going to keep using monkeys and mice we were never going to figure out how any of this worked.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
And so they needed us to accept this they needed us to get behind people like Netanyahu who were ready to turn over all of the data.

17:59.000 --> 18:11.000
They needed to get people like Justin Trudeau behind them because he was willing to turn over all the data. They needed to get people in the UK behind them because they have all the data.

18:11.000 --> 18:23.000
And then they needed to get the private corporations the big hospital conglomerates together in America so that they could orchestrate the start of the theater.

18:23.000 --> 18:30.000
People was rolling just like the ball in the beginning of Indiana Jones it ain't stopping.

18:30.000 --> 18:47.000
And that's where we are right now four years later with a bunch of people whose salary and position in the hierarchy is dependent on them not challenging the premises of this national security operation, not the premises of a faith, not the premises of biology

18:47.000 --> 18:59.000
and the premises of a national security operation that they are aware of.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Why is that there right now?

19:06.000 --> 19:15.000
Are we already going to do this? Is that already coming up right now? It is isn't it? Yes. Okay. Let's do the death UK death doc because I think that's a good idea.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
I think 33 will get through it this way and then if we make it farther, we will.

19:22.000 --> 19:31.000
Am I out of focus? I was in focus right? I was in focus right? It's good. I think if I get to, I got to really have a really good camera up there. So sometimes I get out of focus.

19:31.000 --> 19:41.000
Anyway, reach out to super spreaders to find out. I already have contact with Matthew in other directions because of Kara and Jeff from Earth.

19:41.000 --> 19:54.000
I just haven't really followed through with it yet because I have had other balls in the air. I've had some consulting to do which is kind of helping ends meet. That's part of the reason why there are a lot of study halls still.

19:54.000 --> 20:08.000
So, yeah, I'm just very thankful that everything is moving forward. I'm going to zoom out of here. I'm going to pop into here. I do have it slightly sped up.

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
If it gets annoying for you because it is sped up, just please let me know and I will slow it down, but it's not that much sped up.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
And then I'm going to zip over into the corner. I'll see you in a minute.

20:25.000 --> 20:38.000
A good death needs three things. It needs equipment. It needs medication and it needs the staff to administer it. Do you have enough syringe drivers in the NHS to deliver medications to keep people comfortable when they're passing away?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes, right now we do.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
And the second one is with that, that's the syringe drivers to deliver medication, particularly things like medazalam and maufi.

20:48.000 --> 21:08.000
Do you have any precautions put in place to make sure we have enough of those medications to be delivered? Yes, we do.

21:08.000 --> 21:27.000
Of course, what we're trying to do here and what they're trying to do and what we want to pay attention to is what we want to pay attention to is that, of course, we are making the argument, Jessica's making the argument marks, making the argument, a lot of people are not

21:28.000 --> 21:53.000
making the argument that they murdered people in order to start the pandemic. A lot of people. Let's put that very clear. A lot of people that have been in front of a lot of people that have been on stage that have been censored and got on tucker that have been on on tour that have been on cruises off Turkey that have been on stage in Romania that have been in front of the Senate multiple times, none of them.

21:53.000 --> 22:03.000
I mean, none of them. None of them. None of them. None of them. None of them.

22:03.000 --> 22:13.000
Are talking about the people that were murdered in order to see the notion of a pandemic. None of them are talking about it. And this is a problem because the stats are very clear.

22:13.000 --> 22:30.000
People were murdered, even if you shuffle all the stuff around on the table. And there's still some sand in the corner that you can call a respiratory pathogen that we didn't know about before that sand.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
Is gone.

22:35.000 --> 22:43.000
And nobody's talking about it. The rest of the table is covered in murder.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
Everybody's talking about the sand on the floor.

22:47.000 --> 23:03.000
Everybody's talking about the consequences, you know, like the consequences of the shot, but nobody's talking about how it is that they actually managed to scare billions of people into accepting transfection.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Because it's better than whatever else is out there.

23:07.000 --> 23:17.000
And the way they did it is by murdering people and lying about it. And that's the part of this story that the vast majority of these people won't talk about.

23:17.000 --> 23:28.000
They write books about Ivermectin. They will go on Tucker and talk about how their career was ruined. They will complain about how they lost their YouTube monetization.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
But they will not speak out about the murdered Americans.

23:35.000 --> 23:47.000
The justified the start of the pandemic around the world, the Jessica Hockett and others have so eloquently shown us is there.

23:47.000 --> 23:56.000
The Denny Rancor has so eloquently shown us is not there.

23:56.000 --> 24:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to wake up and apologize to our kids for getting there only right now. We need to wake up and apologize to our college kids while they're losing their mind about the artificial circus in the Middle East.

24:10.000 --> 24:26.000
Ladies and gentlemen, do not misunderstand me. I'm sure there are people being killed in Gaza right now because they kill people in order to create the narratives that they lie about to govern us.

24:26.000 --> 24:38.000
I'm sure they killed people in Iraq. I'm sure they killed people in Syria. I'm sure they killed people in Libya. I'm sure they killed people in China. I'm sure they killed people in Russia. I'm sure they're killing people in Ukraine.

24:38.000 --> 24:51.000
Because they kill people and then lie about it in order to govern us. And the pandemic is just a particularly wonderful example of it right in your face.

24:51.000 --> 25:09.000
You are in a dark room, ladies and gentlemen, with people whispering in your ear about what you should find with your hands. You have found a brick wall and they are telling you to run toward the wall.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
Don't believe what you feel. Don't believe what you see. Don't believe your senses about what happened.

25:15.000 --> 25:33.000
There really was a novel virus. It really did kill millions of people. It probably was gain a function. That means it will come again. Trust us. I'm sure there was a novel thing because I treated people. I'm sure there was a novel thing because sick.

25:33.000 --> 25:49.000
We got to break this, ladies and gentlemen. The only way to break it is to start right here. They murdered people and lied about it in order to start the pandemic. New York City is the most shining example of how this might have been done.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
It is maybe the only example that needed to have been done.

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
But yes, they definitely did it in the UK too. Because that's how we are governed.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
I realized something was wrong when I found out last year that my dad had a DNR put in place when he was in his care home.

26:15.000 --> 26:28.000
So I spoke to a whistleblower doctor. She told me they were being put on people who were over 60. They were cast as elderly. She told me they were being put on people with mental health issues, people with physical disabilities, even on children with autism.

26:28.000 --> 26:37.000
So I wrote an article which went viral. David Eich Swativer invited me onto his podcast to talk about what he called the premeditated murder of the elderly in care homes and hospitals across the UK.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Over the next few weeks, many people approached me with heartbreak.

26:41.000 --> 26:57.000
What's the trick? They let David Eich talk about it. Then half the people in the UK won't believe it. Just like you let somebody go on Tucker Carlson. Half the people in America won't believe it. It's a trick. It's a show. It is an enchantment. And we are all trapped in it until we throw it all out.

26:58.000 --> 27:16.000
David Eich is a witting or unwitting player in this already on stage. He should be lifting others up. And maybe that's what this is. Maybe, maybe that's what this is.

27:17.000 --> 27:34.000
But I don't think we should count on David Eich to be the hero. If this is David Eich's movie, well, okay, then we better take it with a grain of salt. But there is also a little bit of this play in here that they have to tell us the truth in order to get away with it and feel okay about it.

27:34.000 --> 27:51.000
If they lie to us without the truth being available, if they don't actually reveal their plan while they execute it, there's something uncouth about that for them. Capital T-H-E-M.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, they murdered people to create the illusion of a pandemic. I am certain of it.

27:56.000 --> 28:04.000
Taking stories of how their relatives and loved ones have been killed in hospital. There were too many not to believe, so I decided to pitch it to the national newspapers.

28:04.000 --> 28:17.000
I contacted 28 editors and got no immediate response. After chasing a few times, a couple of them got back to me. But after much discussion, and even after they talked to some of the people that I'd spoken to, they decided not to run the story. They never explained why.

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
These stories needed to be heard, and I realised that they'd be better captured on film than on paper.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
It's good. It's going to be heartbreaking.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
These dad went into the hospital with suspected pneumonia. Can you tell me a bit about him and what he was like, not only health wise but personality wise?

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
Oh, he was a beautiful person, an incredible soul, gave everything to everybody in his life, you know.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Oh, it's going to be awful.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Yeah, great blues guitar list.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
It's going to be awful.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
They just killed people. That's all they did. They just killed people.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
Everybody knows him in Liverpool and people had to die or there wouldn't be a pandemic.

28:54.000 --> 29:08.000
That's so sad. So dad was in the room on his own. He was awake at the time. But upon going in that room, he was sedated with Madazalan and given morphine. I never woke up.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
How do you know he was given morphine and Dazlan?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
They told us.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Patients who are prescribed end-of-life drugs such as Madazalan and morphine have it administered in one of three ways.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Holy shit.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
Poorly by injection or via a syringe driver. A syringe driver is a device used to administer drugs over a prolonged period, very gradually.

29:26.000 --> 29:40.000
234 is a cocktail of medication drip feeding under the skin and now I know that was given to kill her as quickly as possible.

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
My Dazalan dose is very titration during which a drug should be administered gradually at a small dose leading to a larger dose seems to have been abandoned.

29:48.000 --> 29:58.000
Ravi and his wife Diane were NHS nurses. In February 2021, Diane was admitted to hospital after a bad reaction to the AstraZeneca vaccine.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
My Dazalan have 2.5 milligrams that can kill a person.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
So they always give 2.5 milligrams and they shouldn't do that, especially with baseball like people.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
They need to start with 0.5 and 1 and 1.

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
Oh gosh I hope these people burn in hell and I hope it's a long barbecue.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
And on a syringe driver it's a constant pumping of the drug into the body.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
And that's not a treatment and that's not a cure.

30:21.000 --> 30:27.000
There's only one outcome when they put that into somebody body and keep it going and it kills them and they know that.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
Dr. Mukeshi has said to me, it was end of life.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
End of life and end of life.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
And I witnessed what he said, Diane end of life and end of life.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Nothing, no matter how I shout, what I try to do, it won't be possible.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
It's not end of life and there'll be end of life.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
How was it?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
How was it?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Exactly.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
How was it?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yes.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Mark's 6 year old mum was taken to hospital in August 2021.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
She was complaining of headaches and breathing problems.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
A COVID test proved negative.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
So going back to when you call gambling, what happened when the ambulance arrived?

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
The first responder turned up to his paramedic in one of those, you know, ambulance cars.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
He came in, started giving him oxygen.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
He just turned around and said, this is COVID.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
And I started giving mum oxygen.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
You see, they did it everywhere and this is a very big problem because you can't give people pure oxygen forever.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
You can't give them pure oxygen for very long at all before you will start to damage them.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Why is that?

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
Because we don't breathe just air.

31:45.000 --> 31:53.000
Okay, listen very carefully to this because this is really, really frickin important.

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
If you give somebody pure oxygen through a mask and it's just oxygen, there won't be any moisture in it at all.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
Because in order to produce a can of oxygen, you need to remove everything else.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
That includes the water.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You can't pressurize it.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
It's got no air in it.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
When it is brought from this high pressure to a low pressure, it's cooled.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
It cools itself.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
But it doesn't suck up a bunch of water from somewhere.

32:28.000 --> 32:38.000
And so this cool, dry, pure oxygen, we're supposed to be breathing mostly nitrogen,

32:39.000 --> 32:50.000
is coming in and is changing the balance of gases that are dissolved in our lungs.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Why is that?

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
Well, because the partial pressures of the air are determined by what the air is composed of.

32:57.000 --> 33:05.000
If the air in your lungs is composed of pure oxygen, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and other things in your lungs will be different.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
I am not a physicist. I'm not a gas chemist.

33:09.000 --> 33:30.000
But I can tell you, there are a lot of reasons why breathing pure oxygen just because it's COVID could be potentially devastating for anybody on the other end of that applied without any intelligence or forethought without any understanding of the potential hazards of that.

33:30.000 --> 33:48.000
Now, for some reason or another before the pandemic, Mark Coolack has shown us that there were lots of different technologies available that were designed specifically to monitor the oxygen level in the blood and to titrate the amount of pure oxygen that was being ventilated at any given time in a mask

33:48.000 --> 34:01.000
to prevent the over oxygenation of air flow, to prevent the kinds of things that happen when we you willy-nilly use pure oxygen.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
How many times should I restate that oxygen bars didn't last very long?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
And there's a reason.

34:07.000 --> 34:24.000
He just said that the paramedics showed up. It's obviously COVID that she tested negative. It's obviously COVID and started giving her oxygen if she was already in respiratory distress already had inflammation in her respiratory system,

34:24.000 --> 34:41.000
then giving her pure oxygen may have increased that pain, increased the damage, caused more problems, caused the symptomology to seem to progress.

34:41.000 --> 34:53.000
I think we are on to something so large here, so gigantic here that all these people are going to spin around in their heads about prions had light speed because they have to get us off this subject.

34:53.000 --> 35:10.000
Now we heard it already in the first five minutes of this. Every one of these people was probably given pure oxygen without any other mitigation measure, no humidification, no monitoring, nothing.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Give her pure oxygen.

35:11.000 --> 35:19.000
Okay, I was taken back by that and I was, I was like, I said, sorry, COVID. And he said, yeah, it was really weird. He was kind of boastful about it.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
And so I just said, you haven't even tested it yet. He said, no, he was like, he was certain.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
My mum said, leave the oxygen here. I'll be right with that. He turned around and said, I can't. And she said, well, I won't go to hospital. He said, well, I can't leave the oxygen.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
He said, I have to go. If you don't want to come to the hospital, I have to go. And he just said, you'll die.

35:34.000 --> 35:48.000
The ambulance turned up and they said, we're going to take the hospital. And mum was like, no, I don't want to go to the hospital. And then the woman paramedic said to my mum, well, you need to go to hospital because you might have COVID.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
And then the first responder turned and said, no, it's COVID. Definitely COVID. And it was kind of a weird, it was a weird silence.

35:55.000 --> 36:02.000
It was like he was trying to enforce what he diagnosed as that's it, you know, job done.

36:02.000 --> 36:12.000
I think we'll direct the flat. I ran over and I kissed her. And the paramedic said, you can't do that.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
And I just turned around and I said, that's my mum.

36:16.000 --> 36:26.000
I want you to just make sure you absorb the malevolence of what they did in 2020 that that malevolence.

36:26.000 --> 36:39.000
People giving hugs through plastic sheets and and knocking on the window of the hospital. These people need some serious reeducation.

36:45.000 --> 36:54.000
Wow.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
Just keep listening for oxygen because I bet you it's all over this story.

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
Every one of these people got put in the hospital in a care home on whatever because they were given oxygen because it's COVID.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
It's definitely COVID says the paramedic.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Dad Martin was admitted in hospital in May 2020 with suspected COVID.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Hi, lovely to meet you.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Wow, look at that. So we did have more of your form in because he was cremated.

37:21.000 --> 37:27.000
And we're going to scatter his ashes in places that he loved. Holiday destinations, seaside places he never got to go.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
But there is some ashes that we've laid there.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
That's where we remember him, really nice idea.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And it's just because life takes over. You can't go to a grave every day, can you?

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
At least if you atoll him.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
That's a really good idea. I've never seen that from before in the garden, but it is a really nice idea.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Just closeness, yeah.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
What actually led him to be in hospital in the first place?

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
He said he took bad in March. He said he didn't feel well. So we rang 1-1-1 and they said, oh, it sounds like he's got COVID.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
It's like two weeks. Two weeks later, we still know better.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
So we're talking up to A&E and they put him on the assessment unit.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
He tested.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
So if you tell somebody to isolate for two weeks when they have pneumonia and they don't recover, then they're going to come back in a bad way, right?

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Take a tip for COVID on entry, but they put him on a hot ward where he remained for 16 days.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
So why do they put him in a COVID ward if you tested negative? They won't answer that.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
So he tests negative, but they put him in a COVID ward anyway.

38:23.000 --> 38:34.000
Did they hope that then he would test positive? You see, these are all questions that you don't need to ask because at the heart of it is that they did not treat this man.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
They did not treat him for the illness that they had and they did not respect the result that they got.

38:40.000 --> 38:52.000
So here you can see a scenario where even if the tests were real, even if the tests were high fidelity and the signal was almost in the background and didn't even exist these people

38:52.000 --> 39:06.000
because of what happened on television, because of what they were told in their meeting in the morning, because of what they read on social media, they did it anyway.

39:06.000 --> 39:17.000
And so it is of utmost importance that we start to really understand the breadth and the depth of the operation that was executed on us and the number of lemmings that were involved in it.

39:18.000 --> 39:27.000
The danger that these lemmings represent to us and our children that they need to either be woken up or run off a cliff of their own.

39:27.000 --> 39:40.000
I don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of people who will jump when they're told to jump because those people will also put me on a train when they're told to put me on a train.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
Holy cow, I can't even believe it. We're not even close to it.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
I mean, we haven't even started this movie yet. I'm already terrified of what probably happened in the UK.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
And that's the point that I was making to my wife earlier. I don't think we can help them.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
I don't think we can help the people in Australia. I don't think we can help the people north of our border either.

40:02.000 --> 40:09.000
I think Americans need to get together with Americans. Americans need to expose what happened in America.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
And America needs to change America and change American laws to prevent this from happening again in America.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
And everybody else in the world needs to do it in their own country.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
The Netherlands, the Dutch people need to pull their heads out. The UK, those people need to pull their heads out.

40:25.000 --> 40:32.000
The Australians, you gave your guns away ten years ago. You need to pull your heads out. And in Canada, it's the same damn thing.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
You need to pull your heads out. We can't change your laws. We can't run for your office.

40:37.000 --> 40:47.000
So you're screwed unless you do something. And us making a global effort to oppose the who will do absolutely jack shit.

40:47.000 --> 40:59.000
And I think everybody in the world that's telling us to oppose the who and is excited because some of the text was watered down knows that.

40:59.000 --> 41:12.000
The only way for anyone to make any difference in this is if you organize locally enough to change your own local laws and to exempt your own local system from this shit ever happening again.

41:12.000 --> 41:23.000
I'm 52 years old. I'm sorry. There isn't an adult on the planet that I'm going to defer to to what happens for my grandkids anymore.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
I'm done with this deferring to other adults in the room is what my dad did for his whole life.

41:30.000 --> 41:39.000
What my mom has done for her whole life. And that's what got us Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi in Congress for 30 years.

41:39.000 --> 41:55.000
Why none of our parents were never in Congress. Why these ancient people are still governing us. Why Senator Leahy has Mark just pointed out earlier today or last night at midnight.

41:55.000 --> 42:02.000
Was in office until like 23 for shit sake.

42:02.000 --> 42:14.000
They killed people ladies and gentlemen and call it a pandemic they killed people and called it a pandemic in order to invert our sovereignty to permissions and eventually dismantle our national borders and national sovereignty.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
And maybe we'll even beg for them to do it because everybody's so corrupt.

42:18.000 --> 42:28.000
Isn't that what they're going to do in the Netherlands with their royal family won't that isn't that what they'll do with the royal family and in the UK they'll ruin it.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.000
They'll expose it. And so then the UK citizens will gladly burn the house down.

42:34.000 --> 42:45.000
They'll expose the the Nazi connections of the Dutch royal family and then of course the Netherlands is half immigrants they'll burn the system down no problem.

42:46.000 --> 42:55.000
And now we're going to have some kind of fractionization of America on the lines of Trump Kennedy Biden.

42:55.000 --> 43:01.000
And money and no money or Bitcoin or or or race law or whatever shit.

43:01.000 --> 43:10.000
And then we'll all decide to burn it down to know the solution is for us to come together as peasants.

43:11.000 --> 43:23.000
And take back control of our nations because they murdered people in order for us to believe that there was a pandemic so that they could do what they're doing now they murdered people.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
When a DNA do not attempt resuscitation order is put in place.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
It means that should a person's heart or breathing stop medics will not try to bring them back to life.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
It was about five o'clock in the evening that the doctor rang and he says your dad's very poo low.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
We don't know what to do with him. Can I ask you of opinion on a DNA or we've had an in-depth conversation with your dad.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
He wants a DNA or I really wasn't expecting to have that conversation so they caught me off guard.

43:52.000 --> 43:59.000
But then he said your dad's agreed to be so I said well if that's my dad's wishes who am I to?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
No reason not to believe them either.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
But then we kept drinking my dad's phone and he wasn't answering.

44:04.000 --> 44:12.000
When we eventually got through to him it was about nine o'clock in the evening and he said that they'd scared him by saying that if something happened they wouldn't help him.

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
So I said but you've agreed. He said no I don't know what they're saying to me but that was his exact words.

44:18.000 --> 44:38.000
They murdered people. They murdered people. That's what they did.

44:38.000 --> 44:50.000
If you told people in hospitals, hospital administrators, EMTs and doctors, stories that you knew would result in people dying mistakenly.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
You murdered people.

44:54.000 --> 45:05.000
And unfortunately if you're a doctor and you were told those stories and you didn't have the principles or the wherewithal to see through those stories, you murdered people too.

45:05.000 --> 45:20.000
If you work in a university and you're a biologist and you use transfection on your bench and you didn't speak out about the use of transfection as disingenuously called an investigational vaccine.

45:20.000 --> 45:31.000
And for now you are also in responsible for manslaughter. Yes that's correct.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
Just before Christmas 2020 Michelle's mum and Barry's wife Christine was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
Dad was decorating the house and decided to do up the house and at this old floor that had been down for it since I got married.

45:43.000 --> 45:50.000
My older brother was pulling it up and the dust was really heavy. It was about six o'clock I think my older brother run and said mum's called an ambulance.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
And then the next day we got a phone call from the hospital asking about mum's last wishes.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
I was like what do you mean her last wishes like DNR and I was like I don't get what you're going on about or would she like to be resuscitated.

46:01.000 --> 46:11.000
I said absolutely. My mum's always said if you know if I've got cancer there might be a different thing but otherwise you fight to the bitter end and all they kept saying all over the weekend was she's comfortable she's stable.

46:11.000 --> 46:19.000
That was it. We went up there we sat in this room and he started telling us that mum's this much more. Look at that right there.

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
Do you see that mask?

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
If that's attached to pure oxygen at 60 liters a minute.

46:29.000 --> 46:38.000
Flowing out of those holes so that the only thing that she sucks in is dehumidified pure rarefied oxygen.

46:38.000 --> 46:48.000
Then in two hours she would have acute lung injury that could easily be misconstrued as progressing COVID symptoms.

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
If that's on some kind of device where they're adding.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
Humidifying and there it's not pure oxygen that I'm not talking any I'm not saying anything at all if it's.

47:01.000 --> 47:08.000
If it's you know 40% oxygen and it's got humidification and there's a sensor I'm not saying anything.

47:08.000 --> 47:27.000
But what I am saying is that when people were talking about running out of oxygen tanks in New York hospitals when they were talking about shortages of oxygen tanks when they were talking about the comfort ship in New York City having an oxygen plant

47:27.000 --> 47:42.000
and running out of ventilators I'm having a hard time believing that they were using the extra equipment that's necessary in order to re rehumidify that air or to mix that air with other air because then you need two tanks

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
and a regulator.

47:46.000 --> 48:00.000
You see ladies and gentlemen where we're going with this do you see where we're going with this people who spread this idea who suggested that this was the way to go who pushed this idea into hospital administrations through hospital corporations.

48:00.000 --> 48:15.000
These people murdered people in order to see the mass casualty event that they call the start of the pandemic they did it in the UK they did it in America and then they told people in lockdown New Zealand in Australia that look what you're missing.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
Look what you're missing.

48:20.000 --> 48:32.000
And that's why we can't fight with them because they were lied to in a different way they were told lies about the murder that they don't think happened those people think that that was really COVID.

48:32.000 --> 48:39.000
People like Jiki thinks that there was really COVID in America because he saw it on TV.

48:39.000 --> 48:50.000
And it didn't come to Australia till later because that's what they saw those people need to dig themselves out of their own cave because their own illusion is different.

48:50.000 --> 48:57.000
The images on their cave wall were different than the images on our cave wall.

48:57.000 --> 49:10.000
And in fact they used our experience and showed it on their cave wall distorted because all the images on the wall are distorted.

49:10.000 --> 49:20.000
We are already trying to play some kind of game if we are trying to come together with people around the world about what happened that's impossible.

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
Because what happened around the world was different for everyone.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
And they saw a different side of the lie.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
And since it's all lies then comparing notes ain't going to help unless it's notes about murder.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
We can do for him we advise you to turn off the machine.

49:38.000 --> 49:47.000
And I was like what and he said turn the machine off that's it yeah finish and he said we put something in our stomach and I said you're like putting her down like a dog.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
I said it's like what they do in Switzerland oh no we don't do anything like that it's nothing.

49:51.000 --> 49:58.000
And I asked when are you thinking of doing this then and he didn't answer and he was all about hands and talking and then my brother asked still didn't answer.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
And then I said but when and he went tomorrow at 12 o'clock.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
They just murdered people.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Stuart is a new caller from Norfolk. Welcome Stuart.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Could I ask you to imagine Stuart what's the difference because we here weren't sure if there is a difference between assisted dying in euthanasia.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Yes there is.

50:21.000 --> 50:28.000
Okay, euthanasia is what the doctors like to call with death which can be a decision taken by a doctor without your consent.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
What currently happens over here is involuntary euthanasia.

50:32.000 --> 50:40.000
That means the patient themselves is not involved with the decision making or even if they resist and they're against it the doctor will still continue to make that decision.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
If you want to have voluntary euthanasia that's really the difference.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
So you're saying voluntary euthanasia is assisted dying.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Yes.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
And euthanasia is where can that happen without the patient's consent?

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
It's happening all over the country every single day of.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
Malad noaz is part of the illusion.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Malad noaz is part of the intellectual dark web.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
He was he's been promoted by them for for a few years.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Now he's part of the slow role.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
He didn't realize anything until it was permitted to be realized.

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
Just like a lot of these other people who have now come to some revelation about some aspect of the lie.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
They've only come to that revelation now because the script calls for it.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
And that's why I say to all academic biologists around the world that have ever used

51:28.000 --> 51:36.000
transfection on their bench you are culpable for this global whatever it is crime that

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
was committed against people.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
You're responsible you should have known better.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
How did I know better?

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
I'm just a research assistant professor which is basically the lowest P on you can be on a faculty.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
They laugh at you.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
You're a research assistant professor because you don't have funding of your own.

51:54.000 --> 52:01.000
You're riding on someone else's grants or you're getting their grants producing their data for them.

52:01.000 --> 52:09.000
And so how the hell was I the only one at the University of Pittsburgh school of medicine who knew immediately the

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
exception is transfection whether Bill Gates says so or not.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
I don't need to read the New York Times.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
I don't care why I just know they're all guilty. They're all guilty.

52:24.000 --> 52:34.000
And if they gave their kids this then they're just bad parents. They're just bad people. They're dumb.

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
But I got so angry about when somebody tried to convince me that that Robert Malone didn't know any better.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
He took the shot.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
Well then there's only two answers to that one he's either dumb or he's a liar.

52:48.000 --> 52:57.000
It turns out that according to at least what appears to be an interview with with Stephen Hatfield on the Tommy podcast

52:57.000 --> 53:11.000
it appears that Malone was a liar or that he traveled to Italy without the vaccine card and despite having the vaccine and getting it to travel he didn't bring the card to show it.

53:11.000 --> 53:17.000
So Hatfield made a joke that he didn't have a vaccine card and neither did Robert Malone when they traveled to Italy.

53:17.000 --> 53:26.000
But he told Brett Weinstein in June of 21 that he got the vaccine so that he could travel and because somebody told him it might help him with his long COVID.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
So he lied about long COVID too.

53:29.000 --> 53:35.000
He lied about taking the transfection. He lied about knowing that it was a transfection.

53:35.000 --> 53:44.000
He lied about having long COVID and that lied about the idea that well maybe it'll help with long COVID.

53:45.000 --> 53:56.000
They lied in order to create the illusion of a pandemic and they are continuing to lie about the illusion of a novel virus that killed millions of people because that was their job all along.

53:56.000 --> 54:17.000
It's a national security operation that expands across nations run by global weaponized piles of money that are transitioning us slowly from national sovereignty to some kind of global system of control that's

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
based on fractional reserve banking.

54:21.000 --> 54:32.000
Probably digital functional reserve banking soon great whatever they murdered people ladies and gentlemen one by one they murdered people and lied about it and they continue to lie about it today.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
People were in front of the Senate lying about it.

54:36.000 --> 54:42.000
We've had the political care pathway from 1994 to 2004 names the political care pathway.

54:42.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm going to shock you because I'm going to tell you that it carries on without the acronym of LCP and up to 457 people per day in the UK are euthanized doctors in our hospitals and care homes without the consent of patients or with families.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
A lot better for sure you should do the outcome.

55:04.000 --> 55:12.000
Stuart Wilkie lost both his parents in December 2019 he says they were killed in two separate care homes six days apart.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Your story Stuart starts when your dad first went into hospital.

55:16.000 --> 55:27.000
He went into hospital with a stroke but immediately at the hospital I noticed things that I had a little bit of background knowledge about and they said things like we want the DNA or an M immediately and I said no.

55:27.000 --> 55:37.000
Do not do not attempt resuscitation one of the doctors he was the head of the current holiday department who said look he's had a big stroke here.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
I think we could just let him go and just he won't be able to recognize you very shortly.

55:41.000 --> 55:50.000
This was within like 24 hours of the stroke there was no attempt at having him to rehabilitate and they said if he wanted us to we could withhold fluids from him and then he would just slip away.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Wow.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
He had the knowledge.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Wow.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Care pathway.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
I'd been told it had stopped in 2014 but I knew it hadn't.

55:59.000 --> 56:04.000
They told me he wouldn't be able to walk he would never be able to talk very very shortly he would not be able to recognize me.

56:04.000 --> 56:11.000
I said he's got his brother and my brother in America his son and I know he wants to get back over there and he's also been looking after his grandson.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
I knew he'd been skiing to the age of 80.

56:15.000 --> 56:29.000
He was a fit very fit oxygenarian and this one doctor but in charge of the whole gerontology ward old person's ward had basically put a dictate a fat that were on him that was to stop giving him fluids stop giving him food.

56:29.000 --> 56:40.000
They then put him in an isolation room which is another trend you have to be very careful of with no heating in November right and we're then going into December and they're trying to make out all they've got a problem with it.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
No they've had a problem with it before.

56:42.000 --> 56:54.000
I can almost become I can almost start crying about is if I start to try to imagine how many people were alone.

56:54.000 --> 57:10.000
The Hopi Indians are one of many cultures that I have identified loneliness as the ultimate motivation of human behavior it's the base emotion of everything according to the Hopi Indian.

57:11.000 --> 57:34.000
It's almost weird like maybe part of what we felt part of what we felt in 2020 was actually the manifestation of this pain this loneliness all around the world and people in our own vicinity and around this energy that we couldn't describe where it was coming from could have been this

57:34.000 --> 57:45.000
incurable loneliness and pain that was caused by these people who were separated from their loved ones as they were killed.

57:45.000 --> 57:59.000
And don't think for one second that humanity is so robotic and so mechanical that the suffering of hundreds of thousands of lonely people would not have some impact on our spiritual well being.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
I assure you it did.

58:03.000 --> 58:15.000
But because we were so awash in confusion and fear and selfish worry maybe we all missed it.

58:15.000 --> 58:25.000
Because we were all isolated and skillfully using social media to try and figure out what the hell was going on every one of these people suffered alone.

58:25.000 --> 58:38.000
There's a lot of justice to be fought for ladies and gentlemen and not very many people are fighting for that a lot of people are getting nice sub stacks not writing about holy shit.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
So they were leaving him with one sheet on to freeze him basically.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
How long do you think it's been going on?

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
I have to dispel a little myth. Everybody said that it was abolished and finished. It hasn't stopped.

59:10.000 --> 59:17.000
Basically it'd been exposed. The public had found out about it and the one thing that was supposed to be corrected was the shared decision making.

59:17.000 --> 59:24.000
And this is a problem because the doctors and the nurses have no concept of the word or the phrase informed consent.

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
It's their job to inform the relatives which they're not doing and they don't attain consent themselves.

59:30.000 --> 59:36.000
They have to attain that from the patient or from the patient's relative who has power of attorney and they're not doing that either.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
So what they're doing is involuntary euthanasia. That is legal and the courts are failing to prosecute.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
The law is already there. The 1961 murder act. It starts off with the do not attempt resuscitation form.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
You're immediately told we would never resuscitate this person.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Because of their age usually.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
Yes, absolutely age is going on here. If you ever asked to do a DMA, my advice would be never ever sign a DMA.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Right? Because it's misused and abused.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It can be overridden whether the patient or the family want one or not. It can be overridden by consultable.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Right, but that's also unlawful because of informed consent and what the ethics of the GMC say that they have to require shared decision making and consent.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
They actually dropped off the word informed consent and that was their power anyway.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000
But no doctor can obtain consent without giving the full information first. That includes all the side effects of a treatment.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Any negative aspect, the positive aspect obviously is to give a balanced view.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But it has to make you fully aware of what's involved in taking this decision. But this is the fundamental problem.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Doctors cannot give consent. They have to obtain consent from the patient or somebody with power of attorney.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And that's not happening at all across the board in every hospital every day.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
You've got a BNAR. You've then got a doll's deprivation of liberty.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Doctors' hospitals then think they have got total power to kill that person thereafter.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And that the family members then must all rights to their relatives.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They try to make out that it's a way of a mercy killing or what they call a good death, which isn't even a mistranslation from what it really is.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It's just an easy death. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the condition of the patient at that time.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I have spoken to consultant palliative experts who said fundamentally that's wrong.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You can't predict death, natural death.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And euthanatos comes from a Greek word. Sorry, euthanatos is the Greek word, which it does not mean good.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It means easy death. You can go back to the second century in Suetonius.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
The first description known is of August Caesar, the emperor, dying.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Suetonius described it as he was blessed with an easy death because he died naturally at the age of 75.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I'm used to love euthanatos for that.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Yes. And it's been bastardized ever since and taken over by eugenicists.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
You want to use that word as a cover-up for execution.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And that could be of people with Down syndrome, with autism, or just purely age.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And that's what it's become.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
You are brandy with this. They've got the paperwork, the D.N.A.R. and the Dolls Assessment put on you.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And the next step is they predict your death by giving you anticipatory drugs, the keys in the name, anticipatory.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And do you know what drugs they do?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The standard packet is morphine, medazlam, haloperidol, and chryosin.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
The morphine is heavy pain killer. I will knock you out.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Haloperidol is a heavy one.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Which is now becoming very prevalent.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Which is a sedative only has no effects on pain, but is being overdosed to kill people.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Medazlam is also particularly scary because I used to work in an anesthesiology,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
as an anesthesiology technician at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
which I don't believe exists anymore, but I still bet you can find it on Google.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And at Michael Reese Hospital, I used to eat lunch with a lot of these anesthesiology residents.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
And so I know a little bit about what they know about what they do.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And they used to be really braggy about the fact that propofol was this and that.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Like you could bring somebody under and bring them out.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And it was so cool because it was very different than a lot of these other combinations.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And one of them that they really hate hated was medazlam because they said it has no pain,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
but it knocks people out.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So you can actually have someone suffering in pain, but because of medazlam, they're not really there.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And the worst part about it is that medazlam apparently has some memory effect as well.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
They said, that's what I remember them telling me.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I could be wrong. I haven't looked it up on Wikipedia and I'm not a farm farm D.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
But medazlam is not a drug that you want to fool around with.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And it is used in very small quantities to very big effect.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So, yeah, it frightens me a lot that medazlam is on these lists.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Hammer Peridol has an anti-emitic because it makes you nauseous having the other two.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So there's that effect.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And then they have Hyacin, which is to stop you having death radical wrath because of the secretions.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And they give them together as a lethal injection.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
In May 2020, the pharmaceutical journal reported that a two-year supply of medazlam

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
had been ordered by the UK government from a factory in France.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
The oven-based manufacturer accord said that stock ordered by the Department of Health and Social Care in March 2020

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
had already run out and that they required a further supply.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
According to the article, the DHSC said the request for extra stock was part of national efforts to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Because medazlam was not identified by domain. Just to be clear, medazlam was not identified by domain.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
The accord said that the MHRA asked them to make and sell a further 22,000 packs to the NHS.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Oh, we got it.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But over 2020, supplies have run out again.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Here we go. I'm going to do a medazlam thing. Nice.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Well, now we're going to learn.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You didn't learn anything from me.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Ben and I as a pain.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And it's specifically designed originally for status epilepticus.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And so to prevent somebody who is having a, well, somebody is having a large epileptic seizure,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
it's to calm their body down and to stop all the involuntary movements.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Medazlam was a later development.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
It's like a paralysis thing.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Basically, it is a potent drug with a quick onset.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So it found a place for conscious sedation, which is a...

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It's like you use it for induction. You give them that first and then you use the other drugs to hold them under.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
But then medazlam wears off. That's how I understood it too.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Short intravenous injection.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And it will sedate somebody very effectively for a procedure.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
For a short period of time and then to wear off quickly.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
So it was just what's needed.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
The only thing was that if you used it for that, it would have to be accompanied by a pain medication

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
because it doesn't itself remove pain.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So it will always be the benzodiazepine.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Right. And so that's what you do with...

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
You induce with it, but then you use something else.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And usually that would be the IV intravenous anesthesia that they use during a surgery.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So when you go to surgery, though, I do think they induce with medazlam because it's so quick.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I wonder if there's a doctor in the house that can tell us because I am not a doctor.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I'm mentally wrong. There's what's called a concomitant effect.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So by putting medazlam with morphine together, you've got two respiratory depressants that together

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
slow down your breathing, slow down your breathing, slow down your breathing.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And they know what they're doing when they give that drug.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
There was a gentleman killed in 2014 with 10 milligrams of medazlam.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And the worst thing is I've also found out NHS paperwork that shows you the protocol now during the pandemic

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
is that they're giving breathless patients up to 30 milligrams of morphine and 60 milligrams of medazlam.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Damn!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Which is enough to kill anybody.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Damn!

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So what was happening with the first wave in terms of medazlam

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and the elderly taking out from the hospital's printed care homes and the drug was used.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Yeah.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So when you saw my dad's alarm, how did you say it?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
My hat sunk.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Did you say it on her chart or how did you realise?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
No, he told me.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
He told you, yeah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And he said, it was, we're going to start.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You went off in 2.5 and 2.5.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And I said, right.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And he said, and that's to be over 24 hours.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
The respiratory depressant effect starts at in micrograms at 0.15.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So not even one milligram.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Wow.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
A fraction of that.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
A 70.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And so if you lower somebody's breathing in a cold room, you could also push them toward pneumonia as well.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
There's lots of nasty things happening here.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It's just, are we going to wake up and do something about it?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Are we just going to make another sign and go protest?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Or are we going to sign another petition online?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That's the question because the UK's got to pull their head out.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We've got to pull our own head out.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And that, approximately, of 1 gram is enough to knock some people out.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And the respiratory depressant effect in healthy people starts at that level.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So you're going to become, you're going to have less oxygen to breathe.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
We found out that it was three days before we died.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
He was on the motor's own arm.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
He was on morphine.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
At the time when he died, they said that they hadn't had time to medicate him.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I don't know if you heard that or not.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
She did say Madazzalam, but she said it in whatever accent she's got.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
It was pretty awesome.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I'm going to play it again.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
In healthy people starts at that level.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So you're going to become, you're going to have less oxygen to breathe.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
We found out that it was three days before we died.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
He was on the motor's own arm.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
He was on the motor's own arm.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
He can't even say it.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It can't even say it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But that's definitely what she said.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It was three days before we died.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He was on the motor's own arm.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He was on morphine.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
At the time when he died, they said that they hadn't had time to medicate him.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
But they're actually giving him live-home, chromosome, morphine.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And morphine.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And Madazzalam.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It's actually prescribed to give this medication.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And this is, first of all, it is not evidence-based medicine.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's not medicine at all, really.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
If you start giving things that you...

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So this is a reverend accusing them of murder.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Right?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Let's just not pull punches.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I don't like this.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Let's not say it because of incense people.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
No.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
We need people to understand what happens so that they get shaken out of their psychosis

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and wake, oh my God.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Am I a murderer?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Really?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Yes.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yes you are.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And you should cry about it.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And then you should confess and you should make other people confess.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And then you should all figure it out.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
But yes, you are a murderer.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And these people need to be told that they're murderers by the people that they...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The relatives that they've murdered, but also by people who now realize it.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
No cause side effects.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And then they actually do cause their side effects.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That is, you've gone out of medicine.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
They said that they were going to give them a dasalaam and a moxacodon.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And it was to enhance their lungs.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And they were going to give it as a driver into her leg.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
We were talking about mum's driver.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I'm here to check her on your mum.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Obviously she had her level to drop a bit.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And we're going to increase her dose.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And actually 15 and 15.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Of the dasalaam and the moxacodon.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Morphine and the dasalaam.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I was like, right, so she's on 70 and a half, 70 and a half.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
She said no, she'll be on 20 and 20.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So straight away I thought, well, the doctor I spoke to on Wednesday evening,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
who implemented the driver, told me that she started on 2.5, 2.5.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So either he lied and she was straight away on 5 and 5.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Or within that period that he told me and the call that I received from her,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
it was an extra 2.5 minutes to do both.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And they said 20 milligrams, would you say?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
On both.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
20 and 20.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah, so that's a massive dose.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Well, that's the thing.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So the call ended.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And I was, I was stood there and I was just panicking.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I was panicking.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
We need these people to understand their murderers.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Why?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Because then they will tell us what they were told.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And who told it to them?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
What meetings did they have at the beginning of the pandemic that made them

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
think that this could be even remotely good?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Were they told that the deadly virus was so deadly that they needed to kill the

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
old people who had it and not let them get out?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Were they told that?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Just like the paramedics seem to be told that you shouldn't kiss your mom

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
before she leaves if she's got COVID, but she doesn't have COVID.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
We tested her.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's negative.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah, but this is COVID.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
We need these murderers to understand that they were tricked into

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
medical manslaughter, fooled, coerced, bullied into medical manslaughter so

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
that they, they tell us what happened.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I want to know what happened in New York City.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I want to know.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I'm tired of watching the Kyle Seidel videos over and over again.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I'm tired of rereading the sub stack responses to Jessica's questions

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
from Pierre Corey to try and understand what the hell's going on.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Where are the nurses and doctors in New York City who can explain to us

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:49.000
that, yeah, I definitely saw 5,000 people die.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
That's why I'm still in the corner of my bedroom rocking back and forth in the

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
same clothes I had on a year ago because I've lost my mind.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Where are those people?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Where are they?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Because the only traumatized people I see are victims of murder and their

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
relatives.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And my wife was like, what's wrong?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And I said, that's 2020.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I said that.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So these are dangerous levels now.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And she didn't say they were obviously just, again, justifying it for months

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
anxiety.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And every time we touch the driver, it was on the end of the day because

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
it was bad locked up as well.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Like it was in a box locked up.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So why did it all locked up?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
And I swear to God, every time we looked at one of us, me and my brother

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
in my bedroom, someone would come in and write down on their glove.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And I said, why are you keep writing?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I would just check in what's left in it.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
When they first gave it, they gave the 5mg of a mocks of code on

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and the dazzle out to go by in this driver.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
5mg of each year.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That's a big though.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And by the time she died, it went up to 7.1 or something, weren't it?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
They up to a thing and apparently at 5 o'clock in the morning they gave

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
them more.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But what happened was they were, they hid it from us, you know, they

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
hid what was going on really.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Were you able to speak to any doctors?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
The consultant would come in from time to time and the nurses would just say,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
you know, I said, you know, what's in the driver?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
She said, it's morphine.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I said, right.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
She said, what it's for?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
She said, it's to help.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
It's respiratory system.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Take the oxygen in.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And I knew that medazalan inhibits that.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
That's right.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Take the oxygen in.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000
So imagine that they are repressing the breathing using two different drugs.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You don't need to give to a sick person.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
You're depressing their breathing.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And then what they are breathing is enriched in oxygen, perhaps to a toxic

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
level, depending on how ridiculous they were being treated.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Understand, we're only at the tip of the iceberg if these people aren't aware

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
that giving them pure, high flow oxygen in addition to this story could

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
have been the easiest way that they kept them from ever waking up.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That they got them to ask for the painkiller in the first place.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I think there's still a missing aspect to this story, a big missing piece.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But the nurses just didn't.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
They just didn't want to know really.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
It was like as if they were going through some sort of protocol.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yeah.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Everything was matter of fact.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And even the consultant said to us, it comes from above.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
What we do in here is all protocol.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So my head's racing.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
And I was like, no, I have to say something.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
So I'd gone upstairs.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I was in my study.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And I made the call back to the wall because I had a direct number.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Turned to Mum's ward.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And I spoke to that doctor from the symptoms team.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And I just said, look, I've got to talk to you.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You said, you give them 20 and 20.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
This is a, and I did tell her.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I said, this is a respiratory suppressor.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I said, I know this.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Isn't it dangerous?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And she told her, and she said, no, no, it's perfectly fine.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
She'd been monitored.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And that it won't have any impact in Mum's sort of, you know,

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
lifespan or anything like that.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
There's what's called a paradoxical effect.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And that means the drug itself can induce the symptoms that they then use to claim that

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
your end of life.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
So what do the doctors do when they see those symptoms?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They give you more of the same drug.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
They're actually exacerbating the condition.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
We go back to this isatrogenic cause, physician caused death.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't think many nurses know properly what a paradoxical effect is.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I think a lot of doctors don't know what the paradoxical effect is.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And it's a very harsh thing to get your head around that you are trying to open your

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
mouth to get air.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
But because they've given you drugs, you can't get it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And these people, these are relatives.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I've had to watch somebody come in and give these injections.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
This is torture.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I had a call about half-five.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I went back five, half-five.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
From my same doctor saying, Mum's deteriorated.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I think you need to come in.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So...

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So they basically...

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
They basically suffocated people.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I know.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Like 180.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
They suffocated people alone.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I was just shocked.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I was just like, you know, and then I'm thinking, I don't know,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I don't know if they've got their dose at two.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
They suffocated people alone.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And they told people it was COVID.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
She's now deteriorated.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I was like, what's going on?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And when they said she deteriorated, this was after they've given another 20 minutes.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
After they upped both.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
That was 20 of all things.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Exactly.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And did you make a correlation between that?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Straight away, straight away thinking, hang on.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
If I, you know, what's going on?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Because I thought I had time.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I thought I had time.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
We'd get there and I could see what's going on.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The other thing is if you go to the British national formulary online,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and it's quite easy to look up, you look up the page, Madazalan,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
you will see that it's contraindicated to give Madazalan with opiates.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And that is standard practice in these end of life pathways.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
It should not be given.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It's not medicine.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Why do you think they brought in as the new protocol for the treatment of people with COVID?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It's completely contraindicated, particularly to give it with concomitant use with these drugs.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So when I found this protocol which said, and I'm used to looking through medical papers,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
which then said that you could give up to 30 milligrams of morphine with 60,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
following the execution doses making the comparison there,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
when somebody died a horrible death, but still died with 10 milligrams

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
and some, another morphine drug above that, hydromorphine,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
which about five times the level of what you normally have,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
that in person died but a horrible death.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
But they filmed it.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
There was a Catholic father who witnessed it.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
He'd given the murderer at their last rites, but then he had to witness it.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And he described it as prolonged torture.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
The executioner said he would rather watch 100 hangings

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
than go through watching a human being suffer like that.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
This is the drug they're using on our relatives.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
There is no reason to be giving these medications.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Madazalan should be banned from these pathways.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
If you keep somebody fully hydrated, they will be much more able to drink normally.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Once you bring somebody down, it's like they're trying to take you down the priority scale.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
They're making you more and more susceptible to problems.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
If you're dehydrated, your voice becomes very, very dry.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And your overall body health, everything.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Everything's supposed to be here in your skin condition.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I don't think you can underestimate how much of our problems could be solved

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
if we just had water filters under our sink and people drink a couple bottles of water every day

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
instead of Diet Coke, Tab, Red Bull, and coffee.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
How many people start out basically dehydrated from the very beginning

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
and so their kidneys are working wrong, their everything is working wrong,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
and the soup that their metabolism is supposed to swim around in is short of water.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I'm not trying to sound like some kind of new age person.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I'm just trying to say that dehydration over many days can have all kinds of effects.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It can have effects on the way your muscles work, effects on the way your muscles cramp,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
effects on the way that the hydration of the discs between your spine

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
could easily eventually lead to a condition where you have back problems

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
essentially because you decided not to hydrate with anything but Coca-Cola

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.000
from Chick-fil-A at lunch for the last 30 years.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And we're still trying to find new pills.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Holy man.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Everything deteriorates.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You never had no fluids, you know, like the saline.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
That's like flu, is it?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
They've never had any of that.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So I said, Mum, they said we're not allowed to give you any fluid or any,

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
we're not allowed to give you any drink or any food.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I said, I'll give you a sponge and I put that on you.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So I did that and she was like, okay, but you spoke to her.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I spoke to her and I said, you're right, darling.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
She said, yeah, she should get me out of here.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I said, what's your watermelon?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
She said, get me out, get a wheelchair and get me out of this hospital now.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
She said they're trying to kill me.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I found out from other patients that they weren't giving them food and drink.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And they went to procedures that I knew were linked to the local care partner.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
How can we forgive these people?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
How are these people not being held responsible right now?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:07.000
It's because of the illusion of consensus, ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
the illusion of consensus that there was something bad that everybody agrees on still.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Even the authors of the illusion of consensus podcast agree that there was something.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And it's not about murder.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
The lockdowns hurt people because people committed suicide, but it's not about murder.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Oh, I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, it's about covering up that murder.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's about making sure that you never get away from the novel virus that killed

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
about a million people in America and about 7 million people around the world.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And it's still going on now.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And maybe there's a new variant that will come because the vaccine was so effective.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It pushed it into an evolutionary direction that isn't handy for a lot of us.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
They murdered people so that they could tell us this lie for these many years

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
and they intend to keep telling the lie.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
And so we're just going to have to get the liars out of power.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Give him a sip of drink, nothing else.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
So he thinks he's had a drink, but it's insufficient.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And during the day, you need an older person actually needs more than you think.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
And in fact, the nice guidelines increased that from about one and a half liters to over two liters.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
And they were giving him about, well, typically they would give coffees,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
which are diuretics that were not decaffeinated.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So you've got a drink that is actually causing you to lose fluid from your body.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And they maybe give two or three of those a day.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So that's actually making it worse.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And then they're saying that they're giving him sufficient drink.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But when I asked them what do you think is sufficient drink, they would sort of say,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
well, as long as he's had a liter, that's gone up.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I said, well, has he had a liter?

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
He said, well, it's actually 600.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Well, that's insufficient for your brain, let alone your body.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
And your body needs at least one and a half liters and ideally over two liters.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
That is good health.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
How easy is that for a physician or a nurse to follow?

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I'm sorry.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
But if you've got to drink two liters of water every day, she wasn't getting that at all.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It was literally maybe just some of the luxades.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
We're talking sips.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Never mind that her body is being challenged to hydrate the air that she's breathing

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.000
that's certainly not as humidified as it should be.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Holy balls, you can see it now, right?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I hope you can see it now.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
So Mum wasn't eating.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
She wasn't drinking much.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And the only food that she was getting was terrible.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
It was like jacket potatoes.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
She didn't have the energy to cut.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Did no one come and help her?

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Well, all the nurses were saying in their observations was,

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
you know, Mum needs to eat and drink more.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And I said, right, OK, so what's been done about that?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And they wouldn't let me go and feed him.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And I believe they were trying to starve him and dehydrate him.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They wouldn't let me look at fluid charts.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And I was inquisitive of that.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But...

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Everybody knows what a two-liter bottle looks like,

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
because we buy Coca-Cola and Mountain Dew in two-liter bottles all the time.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Two liters is a lot of water to drink in a day,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.000
and there are very few people who manage it.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And none of us care.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
None of us think that that's very significant.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
There are people who can't drink their tap water in America,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
like lots of people.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
In reality, everybody should have a three-stage, five-stage,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
reverse osmosis water filter under there.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
That's not technology that everybody can't afford.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
That's technology everybody can't afford.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Does anybody sell in those things?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Does anybody repping those things?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I have one underneath mine that I installed myself.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I've installed it at every house I've ever lived in in the United States,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
because it was one of the things that was like absolutely top of the list

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
of fearless terror about moving to the United States.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I can't drink the water out of the tap there. I got a problem.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Well, we had to fix that.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Everybody should fix that problem.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
But ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about murdering people

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
and calling it a pandemic here.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
They were deliberately trying to block me.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So I would go in there regardless and take him in mineral water.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I would take him for a bit of drinks, and I would give him extra.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And I knew I was keeping him going, and they hated it.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I actually had a doctor put their hand on my hand and stopped me,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
trying to do, giving him a drink and a fresh bin.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And I just said, that's a salt.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And I carried on. And the doctor backed off.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Because I said, you can't feed your water.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I was just as I was being looking at the door.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
She was, what do you keep looking at?

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
I said, make sure the nurses are not coming in.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
She went, ah, what are you a bottle or something?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I said, no darling, but they said, I can't feed you. Why not? I'm starving.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I've since found out that he was starved as well.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
His food, daily, what did they call it on the note?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Routine diet. Yeah.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Was this continued? How long before the three days?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And so no water either. No.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
This goes back to the local care pathway.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Designed in 1994 by John Ellen Shaw, and they know this is a way of expediting death.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
If you speak to doctors and nurses, they will deny that.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So of course we don't kill people in hospital. We're there to look after them and help them feel.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
That's what they say.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I've come to the conclusion over this whole process that there are 5% of doctors,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
about 1 in 20, who are, I would say, not only intelligent, very good doctors,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
but they've got empathy, and they will actually properly talk to the family.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
But unfortunately, that's only 1 in 20.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I believe that about 90% of the people involved are just followers that just do what they're told

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and lack that empathy. I think it could be restored. I think they could be retrained.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And then at the other end, I think there's an equivalent 5% 1 in 20.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You've got no intention of doing this.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And they're basically eugenicists, and they want to truncate.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
They want to shorten the life of the elderly, and they're vulnerable and disabled.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
If you want to be a professional nurse, it is necessary to choose a good school of nursing.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Because only in a good nursing school can you get the preparation on which your future as a nurse must depend.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Do you think to say that the nurses who are administering the drugs genuinely believe that they're helping people,

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
or do they know they're killing them?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I think there's a mixture. Some of them are knowingly doing this.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.000
The other ones are told that it's things like mercy killing, or that you just follow orders.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
They don't use that phrase anymore. Do they have mercy killing? It used to be used, though.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
It has come up in conversations. The other ones, again, how can you go to work?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Give a drug to somebody you know kills them, and then go to work the next day and do the same thing.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
You've got to learn from what you've just done. You have to be responsible as an individual for what you are actually doing.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000
If you administer a drug, just because somebody told you wearing a white coat, we're back to the mill room.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.000
A decade ago, the psychologist Stanley Milgram had also looked at how we respond to authorities.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:40.000
In order to understand how people were induced to improve on drugs regimes and participate in atrocities such as the Holocaust,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
he set up an experiment. Volunteers were told they were taking part in scientific research to improve.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Wow, this is a pretty good documentary.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.440
The teacher would ask the learner questions in a word game, and administer an electric

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.360
shock when the answer was incorrect.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.480
He was told to increase the voltage with each wrong answer.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.080
Two-thirds of volunteers were prepared to administer a potentially fatal electric shock

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.120
when encouraged to do so by what they perceived as a legitimate authority figure.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:11.520
In this case, a man in a white coat.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.600
I think sometimes they're following that.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.400
I'm getting my answer.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.800
He was hiring my last voltage.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.080
Can't you check in and see if he's alright, please?

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.160
Milgram's findings horrified America.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.240
They showed that decent American citizens were as capable of committing acts against

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.760
their conscience as the Germans had been under the Nazis.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.200
One of the observations made by the families I spoke to was that the doctors and nurses

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.760
they dealt with, spoke or behaved in a cold, robotic or cruel manner.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.760
But they never had their best interest at heart.

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:43.760
They're like robots.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.840
It's horrible because it's completely changed.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.320
When you question them, they don't like it.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.960
The doctor was really cold to her.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.320
She was like, if you don't do this, you're going to die.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.600
One thing I noticed with all the doctors and organizers that they lacked patience, if

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.640
you ask my father a question, you may have to wait 30 seconds for the answer.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.040
But I could see his brain ticking.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040
I knew he was there.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040
And they never, ever go back.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.360
I mean, I knew my father by then 53 years.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.720
I knew him the best of all, but they don't give you any credibility for that.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.800
That's the same I've learned throughout my experience with this.

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.200
They treat you pretty much as dirt, that they do not accept anything that a relative

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.200
says.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.600
And yet, you think that's a wealth of knowledge that they should use.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:25.040
I felt they were going rogue, that's what it felt.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:26.040
Really?

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:30.800
Yeah, because it felt like everything that I was saying and asking the begging and really

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.880
sort of trying to push, this is the family's wishes of everyone treated, totally ignored.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.680
And she was messaging me saying things like, I said, I do feel like I'm on the 10.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680
She said, I don't know.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.680
I've got to keep my words about me because I'm dealing with these silly people.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.840
We did go and everyone lives us in, I beg them, and she actually said, the only way you'll

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.840
get in is if he's a goner.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.400
And it was the last day when the consultant came in in the morning and told us that Dad's

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.840
unlikely to make it.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:29:03.760
I just, but when I asked her about the COVID x-ray, she put her head down and that was telling

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760
to me.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.120
Did you know to feel like the lack of light calls worked a lot?

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.120
Yes, yes.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120
You can't look you in the eye.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.120
No.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120
My girlfriend said that.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.760
She said, have you noticed, in here, you won't look you in the eye?

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.760
I said, I know.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.760
I said, it's very strange.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.840
It was a very strange environment.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.920
And he couldn't even look at us.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.080
In the little room, we were in the way and even chairs, we all stood up like this.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.640
It was like a stockroom with empty machines and things in.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.400
And he went to a computer and he said, oh, we're filming in this number.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.480
I said, that was my dad's number, about 10 years ago.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.360
I wonder if there were any people that were like this all the time, or you couldn't really

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:41.120
tell where they were looking.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:46.200
So they didn't make eye contact either, really, because they were just always like this.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:52.520
Well, and that was 40 hours later, that was 8 o'clock and we went, we said, can we see

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.520
him?

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.520
And then let us.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.680
And he was still on a COVID ward and he'd been there for five days instead.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:01.040
I said, look, I'm going to call the doctoring.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:05.600
And in the way that she passed, and in all of a sudden, as I opened the door, the nursery,

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.600
what's all these people doing?

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.280
I said, excuse me, my wife just passed away.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.920
I just want to know, she said, why is all these people around the people?

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.560
This is my daughter, my son.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.560
Never mind who's around the bed.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.280
My wife just passed away, get a doctor in here.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.280
We had this flat line.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.280
She said, OK.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.280
Walked off, I thought, afterwards, you know, when we had time to think about it, all you were concerned

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.280
about is the people around the bed.

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.480
But I've just told you, my wife, the flat lines, you know, get a doctor in, wasn't

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.560
concerned about it because they already knew.

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:38.160
I'm arriving in the hospital, she was crying begging for help.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:44.800
All medications stopped, no nutrition, nothing, no machinery attached, no food, nothing, her

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.160
mouth was opened, that's been for air, oxygen.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.960
And they didn't even give her oxygen, nothing.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.960
I turn up, and I'm looking at the wall, her observations are gone, her CPAT machine's

01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:00.200
been taken out, her Sats monitor, there it is right there, that's the one, that's the thing

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:05.640
right there, that little device, but then a much shittier, cheaper version of it that

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.440
they sold on Amazon.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.480
Wow, there it is.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.800
That's the pulse oximeter.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.520
Wonder what that's connected to.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:19.640
Hopefully it's connected to a variable oxygen humidifier thing.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.160
So I went to the nurse and I said, where's all my mum's observation sheets, so I can

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.720
see how she's done today.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.360
And the young nurse turned around, she said, I know you can take those out because your

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:35.240
mum's on out of the corner, and I was like, excuse me, your mum's on out of the corner.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.960
And I just, I was really sort of like the body experience I felt, before I left, I said to

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:43.160
my sister what I was going to do, and she said, I'm going to stay here tonight, my mum.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.120
And I was like, yeah, stay here tonight, my mum, and I said whatever you do, make sure

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:51.880
they do not touch mum's driver, said, if they see you, they're going to increase the

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.520
dose, tell them, hey, right now.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.720
I went home, made some to eat, went back about half past seven that night, and dad said their

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.680
oxygen keeps dropping, and her red was down, I said, lift her up, and I've been holding

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.400
her hands, and her hands were cold, but under her armpits were really hot.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.080
So I called the nurse in, and she said, I'll go and get someone else, and they come in.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.960
And the lady said, you do know the plan, don't you?

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.960
And I said, what's the plan then?

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.160
And she went, I know there's a plan, but I'm not in a position to tell you, she went,

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.720
I'll go and get a doctor, run out of them.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.400
I looked across the bed to dad, I said, what's the plan?

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.800
And then I went out after the lady, and I couldn't find her, and then I spotted her in this room,

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.080
she looked so nervous, her head was down, playing with her hands, she seemed, she'd come out,

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.080
she spoke to the mate, she went to the matron, they were whispering, the mate shouldn't come

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080
over, and she said, did you speak to the doctor's day?

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.720
I said, yeah, but he didn't tell me of any plan, there's the one I was arguing with earlier.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.080
She said, well, I'm sorry to tell you that your mum's passing tonight, and I went back

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.400
in the room, and I was like, apparently dad's mum's dying tonight.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.400
We got, my brother's out there.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.400
Yeah, and it was one o'clock in the morning when she passed away.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400
Five to seven, Friday morning, I got a call from the nurse that I spoke to that night.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.400
She basically said, well, I said basically, she said, your mum's gone.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.400
And I asked her, how did that happen?

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.400
And the nurse told me, she said, your mum pulled off, her height from nasal,

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:07.400
and we were in with another patient, we could get to her.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:14.400
The doctor said that he'd been called for it, 20 past one, that dad had pulled the mask off,

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.400
and he'd gone in 20 minutes.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.400
So they basically said that he'd caused his own death.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.400
At that point, I thought I'd resolved it with the hospital, I resolved the DMAR issue,

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.400
that was supposed to be known to be null and void, and I honestly thought at that point

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:30.400
I'd got him out of serious trouble, but they were still doing bad things to him,

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.400
so then I tried to find another place where I could get into, and just by chance

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.400
a place appeared with another, and we were trying to get in there before Christmas,

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.400
and they were both looking forward to seeing each other.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:41.400
They came in on the Monday morning, having ordered the drug during the night,

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:45.400
which is another pattern, avoided the GP that on the Friday saw my mother,

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.400
and said she was fine, bright, intelligent lady.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.400
Do you know what those drugs were?

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:56.400
Yes, specifically dimorphine and medazoleum, and my mother never showed a chance.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:00.400
What do you think happened to your mum? What do you think she died on?

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.400
I think what happened was, because they neglected her,

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.400
and they gave her a high dose medazoleum, a morphine, that because it is a respiratory suppressor,

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.400
and they dehydrated over such a long time, that those drugs compounded,

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.400
and they magnified in terms of potency, and because you couldn't get the oxygen,

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.400
the drugs just obviously she's just suffocated.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.400
Because of what they'd done to him at the hospital, and then at the home,

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:31.400
and he was literally technically dead, when I went back on that day, knowing that my mother had died,

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.400
they had already started doing stuff on him.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:37.400
So when I was looking after my dad's messes, they did my mother,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.400
and I was looking after my mother, they did my death.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.400
It just seems like meticulously timed, doesn't it?

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.400
Way too well-traded.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.400
But there's no conspiracy theory here, they were in contact with each other, I know that.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.400
You could tell it was orchestrated.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.400
The whole thing was, they knew what they were doing, and they knew the end results.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.400
Why would you treat your mum here, with morphine and medazoleum?

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.400
But on the day that my mother died, right, all was killed,

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.400
they immediately afterwards took advantage of that, and whilst I was dealing with her,

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.400
they ordered the drugs, the end of life drugs from the father.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.400
And then literally the next day, I was running up on my way to the hospital,

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.400
which happens to pretty much everybody, your father's died.

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:25.400
And I was at the roundabout outside the hospital, and I got in there, I'm on crutches, and there.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.400
As I got there, I got another phone call, and they said he's gone.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.400
And I just thought, I can't believe this.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.400
Everything I've tried to do, everything I've tried to do, and they've done this, they've done this.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.400
And I was two minutes too late.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.400
I think if you've been told to...

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400
A long-term girl.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.400
...observations where they tend the family, to me, that's...

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.400
It feels like that's murder by stealth.

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:48.400
When you tell other people this, they don't believe you, though.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.400
Why do you think that?

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.400
Because it's the NHS, it's supposed to save people.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.400
If you make the comparison to the executions that take an hour, maybe two hours to die,

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.400
they say this is prolonged torture.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.400
What's 29 hours of slowly taking down your breathing?

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.400
And I would ask anybody that gives one of these drugs to somebody, or even thinks about giving this drug,

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.400
you'd think how you would feel if you went down from 12th press a minute to 6th press a minute to 3th press a minute,

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.400
and you know the person walks in with that drug, and they put it into your body, it's slowly killing you.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.400
Without your consent.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.400
Without your consent, it's involuntary euthanasia, that is illegal in this country.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.400
He was there the night before, she was fine, she was changed, she called my man out, she spoke to my man,

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.400
she spoke to him.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.400
What was the last thing she said to you, do you remember?

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.400
Yeah, she said, get me out of this hospital.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.400
They're trying to kill me.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.400
They're trying to kill me.

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.400
If you slow somebody's breathing down, this is another myth with the doctors, or even the pathologists,

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.400
they'll say, oh, but there's fluid on the lung.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.400
Well, if you can't breathe, you can't respire, you can't get rid of the fluid.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.400
You know the clock that they're running out?

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.400
That includes water.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.400
Do you want to know the clock?

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400
The clock they're running out?

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.400
Do you know what clock they're running out?

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.400
They're running out this clock right here.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:10.400
We only have to ignore these stories for a couple more years, and they will be something that nobody will want to listen to anymore because the Ukraine war and Israel and the election and whoever else.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400
That's the clock.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.400
The clock is running out.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.400
And a lot of these people have always been running out the clock.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:34.400
The truth is eventually going to come out because you can't murder people and call it a pandemic and get away with it forever, but you can use it.

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.400
You can use it as an excuse to implode Western republics around the globe.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:53.400
You can use it to turn, as James Giordano said, to undermine the trust and faith that the citizens have in their government.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400
Well, you can definitely do that.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:05.400
Ladies and gentlemen, we are under attack and there's nothing that we can do to help Australia or Canada or the UK.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:18.400
Americans need to come together with other Americans and take back our country and investigate the crime that was committed in 2020, 2021, 22, and 23.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.400
And it's still ongoing because people are still lying about it.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.400
That's not the same as Romania.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.400
Yes.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.400
And you just said it fits in with the air hunger.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.400
So it's like a fish out of water and that's a horrible waste.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.400
The idea that this is a good death is a myth that needs to be dispelled.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.400
It's not a good death to be given these drugs.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.400
I believe that Madazayan should be banned for use in the elderly period.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.400
Then it's gone.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.400
That's how the treating X knows.

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.400
Here's where they're going wrong.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.400
It's not pushing up the numbers, ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.400
It is providing the numbers.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:11.400
And that's what I think is probably wrong with this documentary is they still don't see it. They murdered everybody.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.400
Not one of these people had to die.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:22.400
And the ones that had to die would have died in a very different way because they would have treated them differently.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:28.400
And if they were killing people before the pandemic with similar means, that's a UK problem.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:35.400
And an NHS problem and they do definitely need to rise up and figure it out, but we can't help them with that.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.400
And don't let it confuse you. They murdered people in the United States and we need to figure that out.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.400
And we don't have a documentary about that yet.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:57.400
And I think it has to do with pulse ox and supplementary oxygen getting people on the conveyor belt of COVID.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.400
What was part of her death certificate?

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.400
So I had a call a few days after most passing basically saying the death certificate is going to be issued and on that will be COVID-19 and even like this.

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.400
I immediately pushed back on that and I explained and I said, hang on a minute. I said,

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.400
I said, have you come to that conclusion? And she said, based off all the doctor's notes.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.400
And obviously that's what the exam was reviewed and he agreed.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.400
And I said, yeah, but what I said, they said, we haven't got anything you said.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:27.400
What does it say on his death certificate that he died on? COVID-19 pneumonia and what do you think he died on?

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.400
They might desire that. He was killed. Yeah.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.400
What do you think happened to your dad? Do you think he was deliberately killed?

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400
I think he was, yeah. I really do.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.400
Why would they do that?

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.400
To get the numbers up? I'm pretty sure the hospital get paid.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400
Is he put down as a COVID death?

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:48.400
COVID pneumonia and what I have noticed and I'll show you is the word COVID is in capitals and the word pneumonia is in lowercase.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:53.400
And if anyone understands letters and language and numerality, you'll understand what that means.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:54.400
What does it mean?

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.400
It means that pneumonia is a secondary and COVID is the main cause of death.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.400
So his dad was a COVID death sentence?

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.400
Well, it means COVID pneumonia. I think they were saying viral pneumonia, COVID pneumonia. I don't know.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.400
That might not be right.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.400
The mainstream media is not addressing this issue.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400
Why do you think that is?

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.400
I think because it's part of the narrative and I think it conceals so many things that are happening.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.400
People who have actually died not of COVID, but have been put on the end of care pathway.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:24.400
And they are put into hospitals on red COVID wards.

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.400
They show any sign of breathlessness they give in this drug and then the relatives are told they died of COVID.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.400
And they are being cremated with no autopsies being done to show the true cause of death.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.400
When I finally spoke to the coroner, because he passed in hospital things take longer, don't do them passing at home because one passed at home.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.400
And the coroner, at first I said to the coroner's PA, I'm not happy what's on the death certificate.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:50.400
She said, okay, you have to speak to the coroner, Dr Woods.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.400
I said, that's fine. He phoned me up.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:58.400
He said, what aren't you happy with? I said the fact that it's got COVID on the death certificate

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.400
and the consultant couldn't prove that he had COVID except for the PCR test.

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:09.400
He couldn't show me an x-ray of it. And he also said, I can't take it off the death certificate and I can't have this conversation with you.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.400
And I think there's going to be a huge problem in the country post-COVID as well because of these unnatural deaths.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:20.400
But particularly with this adduce of these drugs, this is induced the atrogenic cause death.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:24.400
And the coroners have either got to do their job properly or step aside.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.400
There's 93 of them. I don't know a good one yet.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:31.400
And they need to say this is wrong. The doctors, the good doctors, need to say this is wrong.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.400
I don't like the term whistle-bowers, but we need honest, decent doctors to come out and say this is wrong.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.400
They give these drugs together. They're harmful. That's against the Hippocratic hosts.

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:46.400
It's actually against the, you know, the nurses used to give the nighting hours to not give a harmful drug, right?

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.400
And the doctors are the same. I will not give a harmful drug.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.400
And that is being abused and they're in breach of their hosts, but they're also breaking the law.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:03.400
The fact that the medical examiner and the coroner won't look at any of my evidence and they ignore the fact that the nurses said, you know, we basically let us advocate.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400
I was that not murder.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.400
It's all come down with money and it's just money. Just to save money.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:27.400
You know, they don't want to give people in hospital. They don't want to give people in hospital, in an actual hospital.

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:41.400
They just want either patient has some kind of problem and has reached the age of high age, you know, they think they get rid of other people.

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:47.400
The one question they always ask is, why would the hospitals be doing this? Why would doctors and nurses be killing people?

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:55.400
At the end of the day, elderly people cost money and they have worked out how long it takes to kill them to save money in beds.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.400
It takes 29 hours slowly to kill somebody who has worked with them.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.400
Using them as I am combined with morphine.

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.400
Why do you think this is happening to so many people?

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:11.400
It just seems like money. That's all I can put it down to. It's just the cost to keep someone in hospital for any duration, obviously cost the NHS.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.400
Eximate the money.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.400
Was your home getting a pension? No, you don't get a pension from 65?

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:17.400
Yeah, she was an entitled pension.

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.400
So, you know, that's a saving. The fact that she's not occupying a bed now when oxygen has to save it.

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.400
They saw him as an oxygen. He said oxygen.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.400
Just one that they could save for them. It's all about money.

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.400
You've got to be a little careful about it being all about money because I think that's a easy out.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.400
It was much more than about money.

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:49.400
They killed people to create the illusion of something that was not there and they're still insistent that it's there and that these policies were justified because it was there.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:54.400
And so it's not about money. It's about power. It's about control.

01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:04.400
The money is something that they use to control the winning and unwitting, you know, extras in the show.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.400
These people already had all the money in the world. They didn't need more. It's not about that.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.400
It's about changing the way that we think about the sovereignty over our bodies.

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.400
And that's what this was about too.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:24.400
Changing the sovereignty that he thought that his wife had over her body and that he thought that he would have over her life.

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.400
If she were incapacitated and look what didn't happen.

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:39.400
And when that guy gets in the hospital, is he gonna I mean, you know, they're all it's just running out the clock on these these stories. That's all you got to do.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.400
Run out the clock and drowned it in other stuff.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:49.400
As long as we're damaged. And what's the point of keeping our going because it costs the NHS money to keep my mum going?

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.400
You know, so why would you give someone the Dazzala if your lungs are damaged? That doesn't help someone's lungs.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400
She could have been 30 years on a pension.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.400
Yeah.

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:03.400
And she'd be here as long because we were going to have a move up here possibly.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:10.400
Maybe that's the Medicare problem in the UK. Maybe these pensioners that were about to start drawing, they wanted to get rid of them.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:15.400
That's possible. But again, that's a UK problem in the UK's got to worry about it.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:23.400
We had the Medicare disaster coming with the boomers and we definitely seem to have used COVID to dodge a little bit of that.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:30.400
So, and it's still ongoing because they're giving people over 50 all these different shots with the intention of reducing their lifespan.

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.400
It's not any different than this. It's just a different manifestation of the same plan.

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.400
I'll just give her a better life because I thought everything went on.

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.400
I just talked to my wife about it and she supported me straight away. She just said, yeah, let's get your mum here.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:48.400
Give her the care that she really wants and needs and deserves and live a better life.

01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:02.400
The end of life is really the most crucial time in your life.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:11.400
You can see changes in people when they realize that they're at a point where they might be dying and sometimes the person themselves gets an insight to this.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:16.400
It triggers them to start looking back over their lives, what they've done well, what they haven't done well.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:29.400
And many people at that point ask to see a priest and they want to confess and get rid of what's weighing on their consciences.

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.400
But to do that you have to think very clearly.

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:38.400
You have to be able to look back on your life and see what you've done and what you haven't done.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:45.400
You have to be able to mentally be able to forgive people that maybe you haven't forgiven before.

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.400
And then this all culminates in the last few days.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:56.400
And then you can dive peacefully and knowing that you've set everything right.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.400
Quite different from that is somebody who's put on a cocktail of medications.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.400
There was not a life in it.

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.400
Normally she'd sit there and her arms would pop up and she'd move red and I'm like you're off your face mum and she'd just nod.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400
This day nothing.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.400
I noticed the mouth was all dry so I used to get the little sponge to stick, pull it more.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:19.400
And if I see the wife chewing, like biting on it, I know she was okay she's with me, you know, like nothing.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.400
So I'm waiting her lips with this sponge and I thought, well I don't want to give her too much, go down, I'll start choking.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.400
There was no life.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:27.400
I think that is one of the worst things about this medication.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:33.400
It is given at a time that it is most crucial spiritually in our existence.

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:40.400
It's just the modern world which minimizes death, but death is really where we're all going.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.400
And it's a combination of life.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.400
Now some people want to sort of draw a screen over it and say let's not worry what's the other side of that.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:51.400
But if you have faith, you know what's on the other side and you know you've got to prepare for it.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:04.400
You hear stories of people who aren't spiritual or religious in any way, but when it comes to that point,

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.400
they suddenly want to talk to a priest or find themselves talking about God or heaven or the next life.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.400
Even though they weren't that way inclined in the previous years, right at the last minute,

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.400
they have some kind of revelation maybe or a epitome where they suddenly see the light.

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:24.400
That's right, the end of life is a trigger.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.400
And Medazlan weaponizes this end of life, so-called care.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:34.400
And turns it into something that's alien to medicine, it's alien to spirituality.

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.400
And it's alien to family links too.

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:45.400
Medazlan really needs to be taken right out of the equation in care of elderly people.

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:51.400
To follow your parents, eight people behind going into the church, the two coffins together.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.400
And I just thought it was so unnecessary.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.400
This wasn't natural.

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400
And I'm thinking of that at that moment.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:59.400
And I knew I had to speak first and I had to galvanize myself.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:05.400
And I thought at the moment, if you can hold your head up, you know, I'm all about losing this,

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400
I just had to hold it together.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.400
But I had to speak.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.400
And I knew if I lost it, my brother would lose it.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:18.400
And I turned around to the people there and I just knew then that I had to really act.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.400
And I had to work through it and I was crying inside.

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.400
But it's the needlessness about it. It's the avoidable death.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.400
They're not natural deaths.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.400
It's not a normal. It's not a normal passing.

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.400
You know, I can't accept it.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400
They shouldn't play God.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.400
They don't have no right to decide whether someone should live or die.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:39.400
No, you die, you die. You don't die because someone's helped you along.

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.400
You know, it's not murder.

It's not murder.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:33.400
It's not murder.

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:49.400
We have been manipulated and consciously and intelligently manipulated as populations for generations now, for decades now, and they used a very, very cheap trick.

01:52:49.400 --> 01:53:01.400
They convinced us to think about a mystery that needed to be solved, and that mystery was so ridiculous about a bat-cave virus or a gain of function virus.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:13.400
But what started out as a cartoon became the nightly news, and the arguments spread through the Senate and across social media.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:28.400
And after a year and a half of clowning around, people had become convinced that this was the mystery to solve, and in so solving that mystery, they have accepted that a novel virus is responsible for all the excess deaths.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:33.400
And that's a lie, of course, because they murdered people

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:48.400
in a myriad of ways using a myriad of tricks and a myriad of liars, winning and unwitting participants in a Milgram experiment that they should have done known better about, but it was diabolical.

01:53:49.400 --> 01:54:05.400
And that was a very controversial security operation, so it was going to take a lot of people by surprise, and there was going to be a lot of illusion of consensus about what was happening so that nobody would have the wherewithal to question it in the beginning.

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:33.400
And that was a lie, even if we should have known, because we were aware that the government does this kind of thing, even if we should have known because we are biologists, even if we should have known because we were doctors or nurses, we are able and can forgive ourselves for not knowing right away because of this long list of lies that was rolled out in order to coerce complete and total adoption

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:41.400
of the narrative of a lab league that you would get invested in solving that problem.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:48.400
People have toured the world for years, the same people have toured the world for years.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.400
Why do Americans and Canadians need to speak in Romania?

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.400
Why do they need to be on a cruise off of the coast of Turkey?

01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:04.400
Why do they need to have COVID summits every year in different places like Rome and Stockholm and Belgium?

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:07.400
Why is it always the same people?

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.400
Why hasn't their message ever changed?

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:22.400
Why is it that in November of 2023 when they finally met Denny Rancor and they finally heard somebody explain to them that the excess death can be explained by murder?

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.400
They said, oh wow, 17 million people were killed by the shot. Denny Rancor is a smart guy.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:44.400
And then those same people got in front of the Senate not even a month ago and have still told the same nonsense story about an RNA molecule that started in a mud puddle and is now everywhere.

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:55.400
And they continue to lie about murder. They don't mention the murder. The only murder they mention happened from transfection that they still can't call transfection, but call vaccines.

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:59.400
And they say that they would have worked better had we not used process to.

01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:10.400
And they all agree that an RNA pandemic occurred. Many of them had it very early in the pandemic. Some of them were even in super spreader events.

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:24.400
Some of them say they had long COVID. Many of them say they took the shot unwittingly. All of them are lying. And they are lying because they are trying to cover up the fact that the transfection in healthy humans was criminally negligent from day one.

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:36.400
And there are thousands of academic scientists who should have known better and should be ashamed of themselves. And the biology of an RNA pandemic is about the dumbest cartoon that's ever been drawn.

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:46.400
And any biologist worth their salt should have been able to figure this out if they'd just rubbed their beard for a little while.

01:56:46.400 --> 01:57:00.400
And so I am upset that it took a non MD and a non MD and another non MD to come to the conclusion that the overuse of pulse oximeters and pure oxygen might have actually not been a very good idea.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:09.400
In 2024 we came to this not one MD have brought this up in the beginning.

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:25.400
But there are papers peer reviewed papers from 1989 already that did monkey experiments that show pure oxygen is damaging. There are papers that know this is a concern for the intensive care unit but somehow or another.

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:37.400
Nobody else knows nobody else has known this anybody that's administered anesthesia on an operating table ought to know it. But they don't.

01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:53.400
Ladies and gentlemen, they have been lying to us for decades. They have been seeding this narrative for decades. And then of the last four years they've been making sure that this narrative never gets questioned because it has been presented to us in a million different ways from a million different people.

01:57:53.400 --> 01:58:08.400
And it's all a consensus about the worst case scenario being to gain a function virus that goes endemic.

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:19.400
And they keep repeating it and repeating it we've been in the car with these people lost with these people driving for four years now and it's time we get out of the car.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:24.400
And it's time that we take account of what's actually happened.

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:38.400
This worst case scenario team that has seeded a narrative of worst case scenario to prevent us from ever realizing the transfection was indeed criminally negligent these people need to be held to account.

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:46.400
The way to hold them to account is to have a hypothesis about what really happened they lied about a background signal they lied about the specificity of the test.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:52.400
And they executed a plan that they always intended to execute.

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:56.400
And it is very, very likely that they actually.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:59.400
They did it.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:07.400
And if they actually seeded the molecular biology there's a very easy way to explain it it's called an infectious clone.

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:15.400

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:37.400
Look for some sub stack posts this weekend with some videos that will have subtitles and maybe maybe a transcript or two but subtitle videos for sure.

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.400
And every once in a while we're having trouble with peer to.

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:46.400
And that trouble goes away and then the stream works fine so we'll see how this one went.
