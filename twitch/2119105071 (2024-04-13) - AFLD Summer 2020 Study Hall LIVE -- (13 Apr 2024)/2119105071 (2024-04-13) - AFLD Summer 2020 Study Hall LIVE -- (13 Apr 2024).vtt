01:30.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

02:00.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:00.000 --> 03:21.580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,uni, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not, it's not, it's not, that's not the way life is.

03:21.580 --> 03:26.280
This episode is sponsored by Mank. That's MOOP plus FING.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.400
a month, and if we could accomplish that,

03:29.400 --> 03:31.120
then COVID would be wiped out.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.360
We could do it, and actually any municipality

03:33.360 --> 03:36.360
that could regulate its borders could clear the disease

03:36.360 --> 03:38.200
if we could accomplish that, but I believe it.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
Right.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.040
I believe it.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.320
But you can tell if someone's lying,

03:42.320 --> 03:44.240
you can sort of feel it in people.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.800
And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.480
I don't wanna lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.960
I try not to be a liar, I don't wanna be a liar.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.800
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.840
LAUGHTER

04:01.000 --> 04:04.800
LAUGHTER

04:25.800 --> 04:27.800
You

04:55.800 --> 04:57.800
You

05:25.800 --> 05:27.800
Like

05:34.280 --> 05:36.280
Why aren't you playing?

05:39.720 --> 05:42.520
Man, I'm like an amateur over here. What's going on?

05:47.160 --> 05:53.200
So I'm gonna address this Ibermectin comment in the chat right now

05:53.200 --> 05:56.540
Jonston 72 welcome to the show

05:57.040 --> 06:02.120
I'm only knowledge can dispel the enchantment and so let's just get to the knowledge right now

06:02.840 --> 06:06.220
If you've been here for a while you're here at the top of the wave if not

06:06.220 --> 06:12.840
You might be a skilled TV watcher in need of rescue if you're here now for the first time be aware that we're gonna stay focused on the biology

06:13.280 --> 06:17.040
We aren't gonna take any of their bait on television. We are gonna love our neighbor

06:17.200 --> 06:20.520
So get ready for that this works because people share it

06:20.520 --> 06:23.960
So if you're here for the first time, please think about sharing it if you enjoy it

06:24.520 --> 06:31.120
You can find and share our work at giggleonbiological.com and I say our work because my wife

06:31.560 --> 06:36.080
Makes this possible. My wife is doing a lot of the answering of emails and

06:36.720 --> 06:40.200
Coordinating some of the responses and mail and things that have to happen

06:40.720 --> 06:42.720
And it's made it a lot easier

06:42.880 --> 06:49.880
You know, she makes everything possible at this stage because all of what we are doing here is Mike Bantonberg next day is

06:51.240 --> 06:53.240
Is important

06:53.680 --> 06:57.400
You know, we've got three kids and we've got to find a way to make this work

06:57.400 --> 07:02.040
It's a lot of work to put this stuff together to keep on top of this

07:02.480 --> 07:07.800
And and to produce an hour and a half or two hours every day is is tough

07:08.120 --> 07:13.720
And that's a lot a lot of times why I don't have an hour and a half or two hours produced every day

07:14.120 --> 07:17.760
But I try as much as I can because of these people. Thank you very much

07:18.280 --> 07:22.760
There are also people who subscribe at sub stack. There are also people who just send stuff to

07:23.160 --> 07:29.720
PO box and so this independent bright web is a is an effort of more than

07:30.720 --> 07:32.720
150 or 200 people right now

07:33.200 --> 07:37.720
Including the five people in my family and all of you that share the screen. Thank you very much

07:38.480 --> 07:43.080
It's just, you know, it's an illusion that is sustained by our participation and

07:43.920 --> 07:46.080
Only if we can start to learn to communicate

07:46.840 --> 07:51.520
This more effectively are we gonna be able to pull more people out or help?

07:52.080 --> 07:57.800
Help other people to understand how important United non-compliance is gonna be in the future. I

07:58.680 --> 08:00.680
Think

08:00.680 --> 08:04.480
United non-compliance is gonna be so important in the future

08:05.680 --> 08:09.800
You might have it turned up a little bit too loud. Did you lose sound?

08:12.600 --> 08:17.080
I didn't lose any sound here. Yeah, if anyone else lose sound, I don't think so

08:18.680 --> 08:20.680
So

08:20.680 --> 08:22.680
Let's talk about that for a second

08:22.680 --> 08:27.720
I'm glad you figured it out there Fletch

08:28.800 --> 08:34.280
So I remecked him. What an interesting blow. That was a little grimy there. Sorry about that

08:38.760 --> 08:43.080
Let's just go right here and let's switch up to the desk

08:44.080 --> 08:53.600
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigo and biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you a biologist

08:53.600 --> 08:58.360
That biologist is named Jonathan Cooey. That's me. I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

08:58.720 --> 09:00.720
This is the back of my garage

09:01.880 --> 09:05.960
The light is moving back there a little bit. There's some kids on the trampoline and

09:07.120 --> 09:09.120
Hopefully that won't be too distracting for everybody

09:10.120 --> 09:14.120
Welcome to the show. It's the 13th of April. I believe it's Saturday

09:16.120 --> 09:18.120
Yeah, it's Saturday

09:18.280 --> 09:22.720
We had we've already been to the gym today. That's why I'm a little bit late today

09:23.360 --> 09:27.480
And we have lots and lots and lots of work to do

09:28.640 --> 09:34.080
They have the the cordwood is really stacked up at this stage. There is so much

09:34.680 --> 09:42.640
Just raw material out there waiting to be turned upside down and and inside out so that you can see exactly how

09:43.360 --> 09:44.960
how

09:44.960 --> 09:52.400
How grease the wheels were at the beginning of the pandemic how grease the wheels were even before the pandemic was declared

09:52.560 --> 09:58.560
And how happy everybody was to slide on that grease the moment the pandemic was declared

09:58.560 --> 10:03.240
There was it was nothing but a room of giddy excited CEOs

10:04.080 --> 10:05.920
that we watched yesterday

10:05.920 --> 10:13.160
in fact, it was actually quite alarming to think of the sheer number of hours of

10:14.240 --> 10:20.120
like per hour charge that would be normally accrued in that room all those people

10:21.640 --> 10:23.640
Johnson and Johnson Moderna

10:24.200 --> 10:25.400
Iverm

10:25.400 --> 10:27.160
Ivermectin I was gonna say

10:27.160 --> 10:29.720
Inovio, I mean all these

10:30.760 --> 10:34.000
Regeneron that guy Regeneron. He sure got a lot of was named Ben

10:34.080 --> 10:40.240
Or something like that. He sure got a lot of tips from from Donald Trump to to add his two cents in

10:40.680 --> 10:46.800
It really seemed one thing that was quite obvious that I think Jessica Hockett did a really good job of pointing out

10:47.280 --> 10:49.480
It seemed really

10:49.480 --> 10:53.680
Conspicuous to me that these people were talking so much

10:55.880 --> 11:00.080
Paying so much lip service to the value of the flu shot

11:01.040 --> 11:06.760
Now a lot of these companies don't even really make a flu shot or if they do it's probably not their flagship

11:07.360 --> 11:10.240
You know sort of product and yet all of them

11:10.760 --> 11:17.000
Seemed almost obliged as if you know you got to say that the Emperor's new robes look nice

11:17.000 --> 11:23.720
Or I don't know what what was it that the Arab tail goes like you say a deer is a donkey or something like that

11:23.720 --> 11:29.440
Or a goat is a deer and then that that was like signaling that you were going along with the

11:30.080 --> 11:32.520
With the ruse. I don't know that story. Anyway

11:33.280 --> 11:35.280
It just really felt strange

11:35.880 --> 11:37.880
And also, you know how

11:38.280 --> 11:46.480
It's too bad that this is happening, you know, we've lost six lives in America so far that the tragic news of the sixth

11:47.040 --> 11:53.960
Coronavirus victim was talked about briefly by Secretary Azar and it just all seemed so

11:55.160 --> 11:57.160
contrived and

11:57.240 --> 11:58.760
And

11:58.760 --> 12:07.520
Somebody in the chat yesterday used the term kefabe, you know, this kind of fake wrestling thing. I think that's actually an eric Weinstein

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
Intellectual dark web dude

12:12.000 --> 12:16.040
I think he's the one who said that a lot of this stuff was like that but unfortunately

12:16.800 --> 12:21.880
As clever as he is he's not able to see that this kefabe or whatever the heck it is

12:21.880 --> 12:23.880
So however you say it correctly

12:24.680 --> 12:28.400
That these these people could also have entirely

12:29.280 --> 12:31.280
pantomime the

12:31.680 --> 12:35.840
The bioterrorism threat for for several decades now

12:36.440 --> 12:41.480
Maybe not at first maybe at first they thought yeah in 40 years. We might get it in 20 years

12:41.480 --> 12:42.440
We might get it

12:42.440 --> 12:47.000
But now it's it's come time where they don't they don't have it

12:47.000 --> 12:51.880
It's not there and there isn't this kind of danger and now they need to create it and

12:52.520 --> 13:00.760
That's what this conscious and intelligent this over here this conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is all about

13:00.760 --> 13:07.640
It's not just about baseball and Nike shoes. It's not just about buying toilet paper when they want you to buy toilet paper

13:07.640 --> 13:09.640
It's about what you think

13:09.640 --> 13:14.280
And what you imagine are the the precarious dangers of the world

13:14.280 --> 13:19.080
And of course they don't want you to think about the food that you eat or the products that you buy

13:19.160 --> 13:24.760
They want you to think about imaginary things in mother nature that you have no control over and can't even detect

13:25.240 --> 13:27.240
Without the help of their products

13:27.400 --> 13:33.880
Think about how incredible it is that that we were we really allowed them to do this to us all of us did

13:34.600 --> 13:40.600
Because even if you go back to the youtube videos that I was making in april and may of 2020

13:40.600 --> 13:46.520
You'll see a guy that's fully on board with the idea that something could have been spilled and be spreading right now

13:47.240 --> 13:52.120
We could see waves of it for for for a while. I don't know. I didn't know

13:53.000 --> 13:59.160
And how could any of us have known given the fact that what we saw yesterday there were

14:00.440 --> 14:07.320
Actually billions of dollars of commercial interest ready to perpetuate this narrative

14:08.120 --> 14:10.120
Irrespective of the danger

14:10.600 --> 14:15.480
It was like a damned up. It's like a whole bunch of water behind a dam

14:16.520 --> 14:20.920
And and you've lined up the dynamite's been blown. There's nothing. This is going

14:23.000 --> 14:26.360
And so all the people on the rafts up there like whoa here we go

14:27.160 --> 14:29.160
Finally we've been waiting

14:29.880 --> 14:31.880
And of course that dam is money

14:33.560 --> 14:35.960
Unbridled unchecked un

14:37.240 --> 14:39.240
Unaudited money

14:40.200 --> 14:42.280
I mean we're yelling and screaming about the

14:42.920 --> 14:45.960
The money that was given to small businesses for

14:46.520 --> 14:51.000
For employees to pay for them not being at work and stuff like that and we're worried about that

14:51.400 --> 14:54.600
We're supposed to be worried about people's student loans getting repaid

14:55.080 --> 14:59.880
But we're never supposed to worry about corporate bankruptcies that cost the taxpayers

15:00.360 --> 15:02.920
Millions if not billions of dollars every year

15:03.000 --> 15:08.440
We're not talking about the corporate bankruptcies that are going to continue to go on into the future

15:08.760 --> 15:12.920
That will cost the taxpayer billions of dollars in in

15:13.640 --> 15:15.640
This lost sort of debt

15:16.360 --> 15:24.120
It gets written off because one weaponized pile of money buys a company and overleverages it or you know divides it into a million pieces

15:24.120 --> 15:27.320
Whatever the the people do that the that the movie

15:28.840 --> 15:30.840
Pretty woman was made about for example

15:31.240 --> 15:37.640
Guy buys a company and then sells all of its assets and then fires everybody and and milks it for all it's worth

15:38.360 --> 15:41.400
Borrows against it. Whatever they do. I don't know how that stuff works

15:41.400 --> 15:45.000
But I know it's not friendly. I know it's not great for the economy

15:45.000 --> 15:49.800
I know it's not building anything in america, but we're supposed to not give a shit about that

15:50.040 --> 15:53.560
We're supposed to get mad because some student loans might be repaid

15:54.280 --> 16:01.000
I've got a great and very easy way for us to fix that problem. Why don't we pay back all student loan borrowers

16:01.560 --> 16:05.320
Let's pay back the student loan borrowers that also paid back their student loans

16:06.200 --> 16:08.200
That'll solve that problem on it

16:10.440 --> 16:13.240
I mean at this stage, we've got to be realistic

16:13.240 --> 16:18.760
These people have been jerking us around by our collars for two decades three decades four

16:19.640 --> 16:22.520
Five decades six decades. Who knows how many more?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.680
I had to do it. It was like a sitting right in front of me

16:27.560 --> 16:28.680
So

16:28.680 --> 16:33.240
I just feel as though once we start to really speak this truth to young people

16:33.320 --> 16:36.600
We speak this truth to people that are younger than us

16:36.760 --> 16:38.360
Just think of it that way

16:38.360 --> 16:42.040
Whoever's younger than you if you're 70 years old god bless you

16:42.520 --> 16:44.840
You can tell a lot of people this truth

16:45.480 --> 16:48.920
If you're only 25 years old well, then you know, it's going to be tough

16:48.920 --> 16:50.760
But you can do your friends

16:50.760 --> 16:55.880
You can get your friends you can be on snapchat or whatever it is that the kids like the best

16:56.760 --> 16:59.720
And you can share this information this basic truth

17:00.680 --> 17:04.440
This is a basic truth from 1924

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
Edward Bernays

17:09.960 --> 17:14.840
Before any of this social media ever existed they were already thinking this way

17:16.840 --> 17:18.040
Way before

17:18.040 --> 17:20.200
Allen Dulles said it

17:20.200 --> 17:24.680
I mean way before Allen Dulles said it they were already thinking this way

17:24.760 --> 17:26.680
Don't you see the whole

17:26.680 --> 17:31.240
Impact of this quote and the reason why Vera Sharab uses it every time she gives

17:31.640 --> 17:36.120
And talk about this kind of thing because it's from 1924

17:40.520 --> 17:46.120
And that's how they got us to abdicate and give up this this principle of informed consent

17:46.120 --> 17:48.120
We we don't even know

17:48.120 --> 17:51.800
We can't possibly give informed consent to how we are being governed

17:51.800 --> 17:54.680
We don't understand how our banking system works

17:54.680 --> 18:01.000
So how can we possibly consent to it how can we possibly know if it's morally and if it if it's

18:01.560 --> 18:03.320
If it has integrity, how can we know?

18:05.960 --> 18:11.880
And they've been bamboozling us about that much longer than they've been bamboozling us about our biology and about the

18:12.520 --> 18:16.280
sacredness of who we are they've only just recently gone for that one

18:17.880 --> 18:20.520
And that's I think the most spectacular thing about it

18:20.520 --> 18:23.800
So remember that our hypothesis remains roughly the same

18:24.200 --> 18:30.840
The reason why I want to go over it is because when we watch this video today from the American frontline doctors in 2020

18:31.240 --> 18:37.160
When they got on the steps of the capital and claimed to be the the army on white horses

18:39.080 --> 18:45.400
I want you to see that essentially they don't challenge the tenements of the faith the tenants excuse me of the faith

18:45.400 --> 18:52.760
There was a novel virus it killed millions millions more could be saved

18:54.520 --> 18:57.880
It was likely from a laboratory and so it will come again

18:58.200 --> 19:01.320
It's really that faith that we are fighting

19:01.960 --> 19:04.760
and what really happened is a

19:05.560 --> 19:07.560
organized effort across

19:08.280 --> 19:11.800
Western civilization basically and and beyond

19:12.360 --> 19:16.200
A coordinated messaging system to take advantage of this illusion

19:16.840 --> 19:19.480
That it seems as though they kind of were all in on it

19:20.440 --> 19:25.960
Maybe with a collective agreement like much like bill mar just admitted not too long ago. Check my tweet

19:26.760 --> 19:29.080
Where he said that abortion is kind of murder

19:29.640 --> 19:34.600
But he's not against it because there are eight billion people on the planet. We won't miss you

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
That's almost verbatim

19:39.080 --> 19:42.120
What was said by bill mar not two days ago

19:43.240 --> 19:48.760
And so the truth is now really coming out that these people at the elite levels of governance

19:50.120 --> 19:57.240
These people at the elite levels of governance both in the government but also in the media

20:00.280 --> 20:04.200
Now believe that there's kind of an imperative of biological truth

20:05.320 --> 20:07.320
That the survival of the wisest

20:08.120 --> 20:14.360
Dictates that we start to do something about our exponentially growing population if you will

20:15.960 --> 20:20.200
And so if we have to lie or tell stories a little bit, you know, that's just the way it is

20:22.040 --> 20:24.200
It's better than having a violent revolt

20:25.640 --> 20:28.840
It's better than than than totalitarianism

20:29.640 --> 20:31.400
outright

20:31.400 --> 20:35.960
We might as well have people have their toaster ovens and their and their Netflix, right?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.720
We have to rescue

20:39.720 --> 20:45.240
The college age kids the young adults at the high school kids. We must rescue them

20:45.960 --> 20:48.360
from this false history

20:49.240 --> 20:54.920
We must explain to them what is happening right here. We must explain to them

20:57.480 --> 20:59.480
That this curve right here

21:00.120 --> 21:04.680
You couldn't see this yesterday when I was using this slide this curve right here is not real

21:05.560 --> 21:14.360
And this curve right here in the beginning of 2020 was shown to us has evidence of impending doom something that might continue up

21:16.520 --> 21:22.520
And this curve was largely not generated numbers generated in New York City in America

21:24.920 --> 21:28.760
This is all caused mortality every year here in light blue

21:29.240 --> 21:36.600
This down here in darker blue is is people who die specifically of pneumonia yellow is flu identified

21:38.360 --> 21:44.680
And the deaths to pneumonia if I move my big head since 2014 have been very stable

21:46.360 --> 21:54.600
Very stable until 2020 when they increased with a slope heretofore unseen

21:55.080 --> 22:00.120
In a country that has presumably since 2014 become better

22:02.520 --> 22:12.600
At basic medical care better at treating pneumonia certainly nothing to explain a three or four time increase in the all-cause mortality due to

22:13.320 --> 22:15.320
pneumonia

22:15.320 --> 22:18.600
Unless of course we told everybody that there was a novel virus

22:19.320 --> 22:25.480
And that that novel virus meant viral pneumonia and viral pneumonia doesn't need antibiotics

22:25.880 --> 22:32.120
We could have said something like that like dr. Griffin says on twiv every night for the last four years

22:34.360 --> 22:36.360
Viral pneumonia

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
For which antibiotics are useless. I think at this stage

22:42.200 --> 22:44.920
We should start making a list of people who can be

22:45.880 --> 22:50.280
shown on video or on blog or in a post to have said that

22:51.720 --> 22:53.720
Because it's kind of

22:53.880 --> 22:55.880
It's negligence. It's it's

22:57.880 --> 23:03.960
And if you're a professional at that level then it will it will amount to negligence or some kind of

23:04.680 --> 23:06.680
malevolent

23:07.480 --> 23:13.000
What malpractice or something like that it would be like a doctor going on saying, you know, I'm a doctor

23:13.000 --> 23:17.160
I'm an MD. I work at at at Columbia University

23:17.160 --> 23:23.400
And I think you should drink motor oil tonight. Well, then you are liable for the people that drink motor oil

23:24.840 --> 23:27.800
And I think that some of these people need to be held liable

23:28.200 --> 23:35.080
For having said that viral pneumonia will not is not should not be given antibiotics

23:37.560 --> 23:39.720
Because viral pneumonia doesn't exist

23:39.880 --> 23:41.880
I

23:41.880 --> 23:44.760
Don't I don't think that there is a good

23:45.320 --> 23:47.560
medical definition of viral pneumonia

23:47.560 --> 23:53.640
And I think if you have a case of viral pneumonia and you tested for the presence of other bacteria

23:54.120 --> 23:57.160
I think you would actually find that it wasn't a viral pneumonia

23:57.960 --> 24:03.160
It might be a co-viral pneumonia if you want to be has as has placated

24:03.800 --> 24:09.640
Placating to the viral virology club as you want to be but I don't think that they have the

24:10.280 --> 24:17.720
the ground to stand on to differentiate between a viral pneumonia and a bacterial pneumonia and to make a black and white statement

24:18.200 --> 24:23.000
That this pneumonia will not respond to antibiotics and you should not use them

24:25.560 --> 24:29.560
And there were lots of people pushing that exact line

24:31.320 --> 24:37.240
And scientifically we can follow up on that we could actually do a study and show

24:38.040 --> 24:44.680
Every time you say it's a viral pneumonia and we use antibiotics. It's still you mean you could you could do it

24:45.080 --> 24:47.080
We could show that

24:47.080 --> 24:51.080
We could demonstrate that that was wrong. They're not gonna but that's where we are

24:53.480 --> 24:55.800
And so the hypothesis is really very simple

24:56.760 --> 24:58.760
Why isn't it going? There we go

24:58.760 --> 25:02.840
The who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus. I'm going to blank this out for a second

25:03.640 --> 25:11.240
And it was detectable by a nonspecific PCR test for RNA viruses applied to a low prevalence population on a hot background

25:12.920 --> 25:16.600
On a hot background of RNA and DNA signals that

25:17.400 --> 25:19.800
could easily create false positives

25:20.520 --> 25:22.520
intentionally or unintentionally

25:23.960 --> 25:28.760
And this combination of a an illusion of consensus across

25:29.480 --> 25:32.440
the the who and the cdc and the fda and

25:33.320 --> 25:40.680
Trump's administration the people sitting at that table that illusion of consensus is what allowed this to take on the significance

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
of a national security threat

25:43.720 --> 25:49.400
And that's that that consensus that illusion of consensus that was at that table yesterday

25:49.480 --> 25:57.000
It was part of that momentum that allowed them to easily convert a much larger all-cause mortality portion

25:57.960 --> 26:02.760
Then p and i much bigger than this this was p and i can you see my no?

26:03.240 --> 26:06.040
This was p and i this blue plus yellow

26:07.240 --> 26:10.040
And they converted a huge number

26:10.680 --> 26:13.400
Of these regular deaths and added some

26:14.040 --> 26:15.320
You see

26:15.320 --> 26:17.560
That's what's so amazing here

26:18.520 --> 26:26.600
Is that they increased all-cause mortality quite abruptly and acutely in 2020 and everybody didn't say why didn't it keep spreading?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
What's happening there?

26:30.840 --> 26:37.480
And what they did was that they killed people in hospitals ladies and gentlemen you've got to come to to terms with that

26:39.240 --> 26:41.000
And people died from the

26:41.000 --> 26:47.320
Transfections and maybe what they did was that they rolled down the dosage. These are the hottest doses perhaps

26:51.080 --> 26:55.560
And after that you don't you don't you don't have it because they're trying to adjust the dose

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
This is all an experiment

26:58.200 --> 27:01.400
Without your permission without your informed consent

27:03.240 --> 27:09.400
And it's such an important experiment that i believe it's possible that yes, they could have taken an already hot background

27:10.200 --> 27:11.480
They could have spent

27:11.480 --> 27:17.960
Several years before the pandemic characterizing it so that they knew exactly what they would find if they rolled out pcr tests

27:18.520 --> 27:20.520
aimed at certain

27:21.480 --> 27:23.480
Canonical coronavirus

27:24.280 --> 27:25.480
And

27:25.480 --> 27:27.480
amplicons

27:28.840 --> 27:32.200
And by understanding what that signal would be

27:33.080 --> 27:35.560
They already knew what they would get when they rolled it out

27:36.920 --> 27:38.920
Combination combined that rather

27:39.560 --> 27:44.360
The idea that they would have sequenced those viruses as well sequenced those things and known

27:45.240 --> 27:49.960
Already what was there? This is assuming that all virus that those viruses are even there in the first place

27:50.760 --> 27:57.080
I don't think it's ridiculous for anyone to question the fidelity of that signal

27:58.040 --> 28:00.040
It could easily be

28:00.520 --> 28:03.240
That the fidelity of that signal is not near

28:05.320 --> 28:07.320
What they say it is

28:07.320 --> 28:13.080
And in that case it would be even easier to take a hot background and misconstrue it as spread

28:14.280 --> 28:16.280
And that's what I think all of the

28:16.360 --> 28:18.920
Certainty and insistence that a lot of these

28:19.640 --> 28:23.080
Actors show about the existence of a novel virus and how

28:23.720 --> 28:29.720
Real the sequencing is and how reliable the pcr is or isn't or how it's just about cycles

28:30.200 --> 28:33.320
Don't actually want to confront the reality

28:34.120 --> 28:38.600
That if you just make it about cycles, then you're not really saying it

28:40.440 --> 28:42.440
Which is that there could not be

28:43.080 --> 28:47.400
An RNA molecule sustaining this pandemic as a novel signal

28:47.400 --> 28:48.920
That's not possible

28:48.920 --> 28:53.800
And so if you just come to that stage right there the rest is a criminal investigation

28:54.200 --> 28:56.360
You don't have to explain any more than that and

28:57.000 --> 29:01.560
I believe a lot of the medlers are constantly trying to get us to come up with a specific set

29:02.040 --> 29:06.840
Of circumstances that we believe is most likely so that they can debunk apart or all of it

29:07.560 --> 29:10.840
And make it seem as though we don't know what we're talking about but what we do know

29:11.480 --> 29:17.080
For sure not very much but what we do know is that an RNA molecule no matter what little

29:17.720 --> 29:21.160
Tweaks you make to it or how many fear and cleavage sites you put into it

29:21.160 --> 29:27.960
It's not going to suddenly have the ability to copy itself so well that we could find 15 million

29:28.760 --> 29:31.320
Sequences of it over the last four years

29:31.720 --> 29:37.560
Put them up on a database and call it a phylogeny based on a temporal expansion of a molecule

29:37.640 --> 29:43.320
It started in a mud puddle that's ridiculous and every one of these people knows it

29:45.400 --> 29:51.720
In fact the thicker their resume is the longer they were in the whitehead institute or the longer

29:51.720 --> 29:58.040
They were working for the human genome project the more likely it is that they understand exactly how true this statement is

29:58.760 --> 30:01.960
RNA virology is based on the infectious clone

30:02.760 --> 30:04.680
methodology

30:04.680 --> 30:10.040
Where you find a signature of an RNA that you think is a self-replicating molecule

30:10.440 --> 30:15.400
You try to find and characterize it as best as you can and then you make a dna copy of it

30:15.400 --> 30:20.440
So that you can make sufficient quantities to study in either an animal model or a cell culture

30:21.560 --> 30:23.560
Otherwise it goes nowhere

30:24.360 --> 30:27.720
It doesn't go anywhere. It can't you can't culture these things

30:28.840 --> 30:33.960
And if they could culture what was in the sahomas county man they could culture it because it was a clone

30:35.560 --> 30:41.240
Because a clone is a quantity of and a purity that cannot exist in nature and so for a time

30:41.640 --> 30:47.800
It does appear to self-replicate because of the enormous quantities of subgenomic RNA that get created

30:49.080 --> 30:55.560
And so by any sequencing technology, it's going to look like the genome has been replicated thousands of times, but it hasn't

30:57.880 --> 31:02.040
That's what we got from dissecting the infectious cycle and so we know for sure

31:02.680 --> 31:07.000
That virology is an exaggeration it could be an all-out mythology, but at

31:07.720 --> 31:12.360
Absolute best-case scenario for them as it is it is it is an horrible

31:12.920 --> 31:17.960
Exaggeration of a of a background signal with the intent to bamboozle our children about it

31:18.840 --> 31:22.200
Because they want to invert our sovereignty to permissions. That's where we're at

31:22.760 --> 31:24.760
We're not going to have any human rights. Whoa

31:25.400 --> 31:29.000
We're not going to have any human rights if we don't wake up right now

31:29.240 --> 31:31.240
And

31:31.240 --> 31:33.240
So I want to keep explaining this

31:33.880 --> 31:41.720
Because as we look back to this 2020 video, it's really important to have a hakeen awareness of what we're listening for

31:49.640 --> 31:52.440
If this gets annoying, I won't use it anymore. I got other ones

31:53.240 --> 31:57.320
Renderforest has got hundreds. I just thought this was funny and I really do like that song

31:57.960 --> 32:01.160
Um, so this is afld june 2020

32:01.800 --> 32:04.760
Um and just to but you can tell if someone's lying

32:05.400 --> 32:10.840
You know, you can sort of feel it in people. I want you to use your gut here when I have lied control. I again

32:10.920 --> 32:15.640
I really I really think it's important. I don't think i'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

32:16.040 --> 32:18.920
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

32:19.960 --> 32:21.960
um

32:22.520 --> 32:24.040
I

32:24.040 --> 32:27.320
I've met a lot of them right. I've met a lot of these people I know

32:28.520 --> 32:31.240
And a lot of them have lied to my face. So

32:32.520 --> 32:35.880
The political cut I have on the specialization is always that um

32:36.760 --> 32:41.560
That uh, if you analyze the politics of science, the specializations should make you suspicious

32:41.800 --> 32:44.840
It should because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on

32:45.240 --> 32:48.360
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate

32:48.840 --> 32:54.040
And then one should be you know a little bit suspicious and that's that's uh, that's sort of my starting my starting bias

32:54.760 --> 32:59.480
And so we all should have been much more suspicious of everyone at the start of the pandemic

32:59.480 --> 33:04.280
And I think that once you realize and that the scooby-doo was planned this way

33:04.280 --> 33:07.320
But planned in a much more intricate way than we thought

33:07.960 --> 33:09.960
You will see that actually

33:10.040 --> 33:12.920
We were presented two sides of the coin more than once

33:13.400 --> 33:16.840
We were presented the good guys and the bad guys more than once and

33:17.400 --> 33:20.600
A lot of us just didn't couldn't possibly have guessed

33:21.320 --> 33:23.800
that the operation that was going to be

33:24.440 --> 33:31.480
Used to initiate the controlled demolition of america would be so intricate as to involve so many people masquerading as patriots

33:31.560 --> 33:33.160
But remember

33:33.160 --> 33:39.000
And please remember this very very well. I'm going to go back to the front here because I think it's really important to say it right

33:39.960 --> 33:43.320
Remember this very well think again of a corporate

33:44.280 --> 33:46.280
tug of war between two

33:46.680 --> 33:48.520
departments

33:48.520 --> 33:52.040
And there's 40 people each and they're all pretty equal

33:53.160 --> 33:57.400
It would only take a few people to cheat on behalf of one team

33:57.960 --> 33:59.640
and not pull

33:59.640 --> 34:03.880
In order for one team to be guaranteed to lose and no one in that team would know

34:05.080 --> 34:07.720
You could lean back on the rope but not pull very hard

34:08.760 --> 34:15.080
And because everybody else was pulling really hard your sabotage if there was five of you out of 40 that were cheating for the other team

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
You would likely lose for them

34:18.920 --> 34:25.640
And so i'm not saying that all of american frontlight doctors were bad guys what i'm saying is is that in every one of these groups

34:26.120 --> 34:28.120
There were bad guys

34:28.120 --> 34:33.720
And my guess is those bad guys had influence because they worked together

34:34.520 --> 34:41.240
To create an illusion of consensus even on the inside of these groups to where it would be very hard for anyone

34:41.640 --> 34:46.120
Of these members who actually was seeing through the truth to have any real effect

34:47.240 --> 34:51.400
And that's why you'll see erso in the background but not really in the foreground

34:52.200 --> 34:55.720
And he disappears in marix in there maybe or something like that these

34:56.280 --> 35:01.480
Really good doctors tend to disappear into the background in these louder

35:02.360 --> 35:04.040
more dramatic

35:04.040 --> 35:06.360
censored people get in the front

35:06.520 --> 35:08.520
And

35:08.520 --> 35:11.640
That trick was played on us so many times

35:12.280 --> 35:14.280
Alex berenson

35:14.840 --> 35:16.840
Brett Weinstein

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
Robert Malone

35:20.920 --> 35:26.600
Every one of these examples of censorship where oh i got censored on linked in and so

35:27.000 --> 35:29.240
I had to get interviewed by tucker carlson

35:29.560 --> 35:32.520
And then I got censored on link in so I had to go to this new

35:33.160 --> 35:38.520
Thing that that I didn't know about but I guess I got paid for gab or whatever it is

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
I mean, it's just all absurd

35:41.880 --> 35:47.080
To pretend that these were all random events in a plinko machine of of reality

35:48.520 --> 35:51.000
We were being played by these people

35:52.520 --> 35:58.280
If they wanted to censor Robert Malone, you wouldn't have seen him just like you didn't see me until

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
2023 or 2022

36:01.960 --> 36:03.960
And and that's really what it is

36:05.080 --> 36:08.920
We are up against something very big and very formidable

36:10.200 --> 36:15.320
From the start of the pandemic scientists have tried to determine exactly where and how

36:15.640 --> 36:18.200
This novel coronavirus spread to humans

36:18.680 --> 36:24.360
Did it emerge naturally from the animal world and get transmitted to people in wuhan china?

36:24.760 --> 36:30.280
Or from a security breach at a research lab also in wuhan and of course, that's the trick right?

36:30.360 --> 36:35.240
That's the whole conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits whoops

36:35.960 --> 36:38.600
Of of our habits and of our thoughts

36:39.320 --> 36:42.440
Let us to think that there was a mystery to solve we were we were

36:43.480 --> 36:48.440
Coversed into asking the question is this natural or is this a lab leak? It's got to be a lab leak

36:48.440 --> 36:51.640
I mean the fear and cleavage site. It's going all over the world

36:52.280 --> 36:56.920
Normally a virus wouldn't do that but with a fear and cleavage site who knows how far it would go

36:57.880 --> 37:03.400
How many people do you know had that idea in 2020 how many people were certain?

37:04.120 --> 37:11.160
About that idea in 2020 how many different random people who are certain about the fear and cleavage site?

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
in 2020

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
I can name like six

37:17.080 --> 37:21.640
I wasn't certain about I didn't even know how the hell they were what what is even a fear and cleavage site?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.320
I had to read about it

37:23.320 --> 37:29.640
While these people were already sure that this meant that not only was it a laboratory virus, but man buckle up

37:33.880 --> 37:41.400
And I can't help but keep wanting to remind people of this because it was really a group of people that were sent out with a mission

37:41.400 --> 37:43.400
They were recruited for a mission

37:46.360 --> 37:48.120
To do something

37:48.200 --> 37:53.080
To break up a group to break up a following to distract people from this person to

37:53.640 --> 37:59.560
To water down this person's message to step in front of this person. There was so much of that happening

38:01.480 --> 38:04.040
I suspect that happened with this group up here

38:04.840 --> 38:07.560
That some of them are were pretty good at the beginning and then

38:08.280 --> 38:12.280
Got corrupted or or or somebody stepped in front of them

38:14.200 --> 38:16.440
I think it happened to a lot of people over there too

38:17.400 --> 38:20.120
I think a lot of those people are medlers or medling

38:21.240 --> 38:29.320
And have really taken to having friendships with with certain people so that they can keep tabs and and control their messaging

38:30.440 --> 38:32.440
I think that's really what happens

38:33.640 --> 38:40.440
And people signed on the line because as dr. Giordano said the the real weapon is the internet

38:41.400 --> 38:48.840
And so you need people if the real weapon is the internet ladies and gentlemen fifth generation warfare is liars

38:49.480 --> 38:52.360
And that's the part that gets so frustrating

38:52.840 --> 39:00.120
When they try to pretend that it's going to be an ai trick or it's an algorithmic trick or its censorship that's doing it. No

39:00.920 --> 39:02.600
It's liars

39:02.600 --> 39:04.600
People that are willing to go on camera

39:05.160 --> 39:11.480
Go on podcasts and tell a story because they know that they are assisting the ruling elite

39:13.720 --> 39:17.800
They don't have to know any more than that as long as they think they're getting on with that group

39:18.200 --> 39:20.040
There will be nobody

39:20.040 --> 39:25.320
Leaking there it's going to be no whistleblowers because they're climbing a ladder that they can't see the top of

39:28.360 --> 39:30.840
And whose fellow climbers they fear

39:31.560 --> 39:33.560
And

39:33.560 --> 39:36.600
So tommy's not going to question hat ville

39:39.240 --> 39:44.280
He's happy that hat ville talks to him because he knows that hat villes connected to the ruling elite

39:46.520 --> 39:53.880
And so he feels connected to the ruling elite my goodness why how else could it be be understood

39:56.760 --> 39:59.960
But nobody not a lot of these people understand the

40:00.760 --> 40:03.480
The wickedness of what they are involved in

40:04.760 --> 40:11.880
They might vaguely understand the inevitability that the that the system wants them to feel I don't feel the inevitability anymore

40:12.840 --> 40:17.880
I do wish that there were some people around that aren't around anymore, but I don't feel the inevitability

40:18.680 --> 40:21.640
But I do think that the spread of bad ideas is what got us here

40:22.360 --> 40:24.840
And so let's take a look at this video and see if

40:25.000 --> 40:26.520
um

40:26.520 --> 40:28.520
If we can we can figure this out

40:28.520 --> 40:33.320
Uh intramuscular injection many combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

40:34.360 --> 40:38.680
Transspection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic

40:39.080 --> 40:44.200
Uh, yeah, so what are we going to look for in this talk? We're going to look for

40:44.840 --> 40:50.840
The faith in a novel virus, right? We're going to look for an ongoing RNA viral pandemic. It would be weird, right?

40:51.480 --> 40:52.840
If in

40:52.840 --> 40:59.720
In the summer of 2020 they all agreed that okay, there is a coming disaster. We've got to be careful, but

41:00.360 --> 41:02.840
There is global spread of something, but

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Lockdowns work. I don't know. Are we going to hear that? It's it's going to be curious

41:11.400 --> 41:13.720
But i'm what i'm listening for the faith, okay

41:13.720 --> 41:17.080
I'm listening for the faith and remember the faith also includes

41:17.560 --> 41:22.040
A novel virus for which novel treatments will be needed because we didn't know what to use

41:22.120 --> 41:28.600
We don't know what to use so we've got to rely on doctors who've got ideas on pre from previous

41:29.480 --> 41:31.480
experience

41:31.720 --> 41:37.080
But that's not really saying then that that there's nothing new that they're saying that there's something new

41:37.960 --> 41:44.920
But we've got to let doctors treat people for that something new so listen very carefully so that we can really put this into place

41:47.640 --> 41:50.680
Numbers and fortunately the mortality rate

41:51.240 --> 41:58.280
Of children is about one fifth of one percent so kids are tolerating the infection very frequently

41:58.520 --> 42:00.520
They're actually asymptomatic

42:00.680 --> 42:05.080
I also want to say that children on are not the drivers of the of this pandemic

42:05.400 --> 42:07.320
People were worried about initially of children

42:07.320 --> 42:14.520
We're going to actually be the ones to push the infection along the very opposite is happening kids are being

42:14.920 --> 42:20.680
Are tolerating it very well. They're not passing it on to their parents. They're not passing it on to their teachers

42:21.160 --> 42:23.160
Dr. Mark wool house

42:23.640 --> 42:30.120
From uh from scotlin who is a pediatric infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist?

42:30.520 --> 42:34.760
Said the following he said there has not been one documented case

42:35.480 --> 42:40.600
Of covid being transferred from a student to a teacher in the world

42:41.400 --> 42:50.360
In the world. I think that is important that all of us who are here today realize that our kids are not really the ones who are driving the infection

42:50.680 --> 42:53.320
It is being driven by older individuals

42:53.800 --> 42:56.760
And yes, we can send the kids back to school

42:56.840 --> 43:02.760
I think without fear and this is the big issue right now is is congressman norman alluded to

43:03.160 --> 43:08.280
This is the really important thing we need to do we need to normalize the lives of our children

43:08.520 --> 43:15.960
How do we do that? We do that by getting them back in the classroom and the good news is they're not driving this infection at all

43:16.520 --> 43:20.040
Yes, we can use security measures. Yes, we can be careful

43:20.440 --> 43:25.480
I'm all for that. We all are but I think the important thing is we need to not act out of fear

43:25.720 --> 43:29.160
We need to act out of science. We need to do it. We need to get it done

43:29.720 --> 43:30.760
finally

43:30.760 --> 43:37.560
Uh, the barrier and I hate to say this but the barrier to getting our kids back in school is not going to be the science

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
it's going to be the

43:40.600 --> 43:43.800
national unions the teachers union the

43:44.120 --> 43:49.160
National Education Association other groups who are going to demand money

43:49.720 --> 43:54.920
And listen, I think that is fine to get people money for ppe and different things in the classroom

43:54.920 --> 44:00.600
But some of their demands are really ridiculous. They're talking about where i'm from in california

44:01.000 --> 44:06.200
The utla, which is united teachers of los angeles is demanding that we defund the police

44:06.840 --> 44:13.480
What does that have to do with education? They're demanding that they stop or they shut all private

44:14.440 --> 44:15.880
Charter schools

44:15.880 --> 44:21.400
Uh privately funded charter schools. These are the schools that are actually getting the kids yet educated

44:21.720 --> 44:25.480
So clearly there are going to be barriers. The barriers will not be

44:26.120 --> 44:33.240
Science there will not be barriers for the sake of the children. It's going to be for the sake of the adults

44:33.720 --> 44:35.720
uh, the teachers and everybody else and

44:36.280 --> 44:40.840
For the union. So we that's where we need to focus our efforts and fight back

44:41.160 --> 44:44.840
So thank you all for being here and let's get our kids back in school

44:49.800 --> 44:56.120
Hello, um, i'm dr. Stella imano. I'm a primary care physician in houston texas

44:58.040 --> 45:00.040
You know, um

45:00.040 --> 45:07.800
I actually went to medical school in west african-nigeria where i took care of malaria patients treated them with hydroxyclopin and stuff like that

45:07.800 --> 45:09.800
So i'm actually used to these medications

45:10.680 --> 45:16.520
I'm here because I have personally treated over 350 patients with covid

45:17.400 --> 45:20.440
Patients that have diabetes pictures that have high blood pressure

45:20.920 --> 45:29.080
Patients that have um asthma all people i think my oldest patient is 92 87 years old and the result has been the same

45:29.080 --> 45:34.040
I put them on hydroxycloquine i put it on zinc i put it on zero max and they are all well

45:34.840 --> 45:39.080
For the past few months i've taken care of over 350 patients with not lost one

45:39.560 --> 45:46.200
Not a diabetic not as somebody with high blood pressure not somebody would asthma not an old person who've not lost one patients

45:46.840 --> 45:53.640
And on top of that i've put myself my staff and many doctors that i know on hydroxycloquine

45:53.880 --> 45:56.840
For prevention because by the very mechanism of action

45:57.080 --> 46:01.960
It works early and as a prophylaxis. We see patients 10 to 15 covid patients every day

46:02.920 --> 46:07.640
We give them breathing treatments. We only wear surgical masks. None of us has gotten sick. It works

46:08.360 --> 46:13.320
So right now i came here to washing DC to say america nobody needs to die

46:14.680 --> 46:20.200
The study that made me start using hydroxycloquine was a study that they did in under the air NIH

46:21.080 --> 46:23.080
In 2005 that's how it works

46:23.800 --> 46:30.760
Recently i was doing some research about a patient that had hiccups and i found that i even did a recent study in the nih

46:30.840 --> 46:32.840
Which is our national institute

46:33.160 --> 46:37.240
That is the national nih Institute of health

46:37.720 --> 46:39.720
They actually had a study i'm going to look it up

46:40.120 --> 46:42.040
Type hiccups and covid you will see it

46:42.440 --> 46:47.240
They treated a patient that had hiccups with hydroxycloquine and it proved that

46:47.640 --> 46:50.840
covid is a symptom of hiccups

46:51.240 --> 46:53.240
It's a symptom of hiccups of covid

46:53.240 --> 46:55.240
So if the nih knows

46:55.720 --> 47:01.240
That treating the patient with hydroxycloquine proves that hiccups is a symptom of covid

47:01.480 --> 47:04.440
Then they definitely know that hydroxycloquine works

47:05.000 --> 47:06.280
I'm upset

47:06.280 --> 47:08.680
What i'm upset is that i see people that cannot breathe

47:09.080 --> 47:15.560
I see parents walk in i see diabetics sit in my office knowing that this is a death sentence and they can't breathe

47:15.880 --> 47:17.880
And i hug them and i tell them it's going to be okay

47:17.880 --> 47:21.960
You're going to leave and we treat them and they leave none has died

47:22.520 --> 47:27.880
So if some fake science some person sponsored by all these fake pharma companies comes out

47:27.960 --> 47:30.600
Say, oh we've done studies and they found that that it doesn't work

47:30.840 --> 47:35.240
I can tell you categorically is fake science. I want to know who is sponsoring that study

47:35.320 --> 47:40.600
I want to know who is behind it because there is no way i can treat 350 patients and counting

47:40.920 --> 47:45.240
And nobody is dead and they all did better and then you're going to tell me that you treated

47:45.640 --> 47:47.640
20 people 40 people and and it didn't work

47:48.440 --> 47:52.440
I'm a true testimony. So I came here to Washington DC to tell america

47:52.920 --> 47:54.840
Nobody needs to get sick

47:54.840 --> 47:59.000
This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxycloquine zinc and zitromax

47:59.560 --> 48:01.560
I know you who want to talk about a mask. Hello

48:02.440 --> 48:08.440
You don't need mask. There is a cure. I know they don't want to open schools. No, you don't need to be people to be locked down

48:08.760 --> 48:13.720
There is prevention and there is a cure and let me tell you something. All you fake doctors

48:14.200 --> 48:16.680
Tell me oh, yeah, I want a double-blinded studies

48:16.760 --> 48:21.080
I just tell you speak sounding like a computer double-blinded double-blinded is you I don't know what are your chips?

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
I'm malfunctioning, but I'm a real doctor

48:23.800 --> 48:29.080
I have radiologies. We have plastic surgeons. We have neurosurgeons like sanjay Gupta

48:29.640 --> 48:32.200
Saying oh, yeah, it doesn't work and it causes heart disease

48:32.520 --> 48:36.360
Let me ask you doctor sanjay Gupta. Hear me. Have you ever seen a COVID patient?

48:37.000 --> 48:42.440
Have you ever treated anybody who had doctor cloping and they died from heart disease when you do come and talk to me

48:42.680 --> 48:46.520
Because I sit down in my clinic every day and I see the special walk in every day scared

48:47.400 --> 48:52.600
She's not really wrong about a lot of this stuff right and hydroxychloroquine is a

48:53.480 --> 48:55.480
I thought it was a zinc ionophore

48:56.840 --> 48:58.840
at least one of the things that it does

48:59.800 --> 49:03.960
I just don't think that she's really wrong about a lot of this and so

49:06.760 --> 49:08.760
It's just an

49:09.240 --> 49:13.320
It's such in retrospect. It's just such an interesting second speaker

49:14.120 --> 49:18.600
To choose. I'm not saying that she's a bad person. I'm saying that

49:22.840 --> 49:26.360
They they said that she was like a that she engaged in

49:26.840 --> 49:35.880
Witchcraft and stuff in Nigeria or wherever she's from in some of the newspapers that were debunking this lady and and using her

49:37.080 --> 49:38.600
her

49:38.920 --> 49:46.120
Background as a way of you know getting people to dismiss her and so it's a strange again. It's a strange

49:47.080 --> 49:50.760
Person to open up with if your goal is to try and really

49:51.400 --> 49:54.600
Send a message to the people at home that that

49:56.600 --> 49:59.400
The information they're getting from the CDC is incorrect

50:00.040 --> 50:05.720
And that people are going to die if you don't listen to us. It doesn't seem like the best choice of

50:06.360 --> 50:09.400
Second speaker when the other guy didn't say anything like this

50:10.600 --> 50:14.360
Didn't say anything about hydroxychloroquine and zinc and zithromax

50:15.800 --> 50:18.760
And I find that interesting almost to the point where

50:19.480 --> 50:24.040
They let her say those things so that people would be less likely to take them seriously

50:28.280 --> 50:34.280
I don't know maybe i'm wrong, but it feels very weird to me that this is the second person to the mic

50:34.520 --> 50:41.880
To the scared to death. I see people driving two three hours to my clinic because some er doctor is scared of the tech sex board

50:41.960 --> 50:44.920
Or they are scared of something and they will not prescribe medication to these people

50:45.080 --> 50:48.840
I tell all of you doctors that are sitting down and watching americans die

50:49.880 --> 50:51.480
you're like

50:51.480 --> 50:56.600
The good nazi the good one the good germans that watch juice get killed. I do not speak up

50:57.720 --> 51:00.360
If they come after me they threaten me

51:00.920 --> 51:05.000
They have threatened to I mean i've gotten all kinds of threats or they're gonna report me to the bots

51:05.400 --> 51:08.440
They're gonna I say, you know what? I don't care. I'm not gonna let americans die

51:08.840 --> 51:13.880
And if this is the mountain in this the hill where I get nailed on I will get nailed on it

51:14.040 --> 51:17.880
I don't care. You can report me to the bots. You can kill me. You can do whatever

51:17.880 --> 51:21.800
But i'm not gonna let americans die and today i'm here to say that america

51:22.040 --> 51:28.440
There is a cure for covid all this foolishness. It's not does not need to happen. There is a cure for covid

51:28.920 --> 51:32.280
There is a cure for covid. It's called hydroxychloroquine

51:32.520 --> 51:37.880
It's called zinc it's called zitromax and it is time for the grassroots to wake up

51:37.960 --> 51:41.880
I said no, we're not gonna take this any longer. We're not gonna die because let me tell you something

51:42.280 --> 51:46.520
When somebody is dead they are dead. They're not coming back tomorrow to have an argument

51:47.000 --> 51:50.920
They're not coming back tomorrow to discuss the double blind death study and the data

51:51.320 --> 51:53.320
All of you doctors that are waiting for data

51:53.400 --> 51:57.960
If six months down the line you actually found out that this data shows that this medication works

51:58.360 --> 52:00.360
How about your patients that have died?

52:00.360 --> 52:04.440
You want a double blind death study where people are dying. It's unethical

52:05.480 --> 52:07.240
so

52:07.240 --> 52:10.840
Guys we don't need to die. There is a cure for covid

52:16.360 --> 52:21.320
Okay, so there's a cure for covid definitely does not question the novelty of covid

52:21.960 --> 52:28.600
It doesn't question it at all and in fact it suggests that people should just have to decide

52:29.240 --> 52:33.800
Do I need to advocate for the use of hydroxychloroquine and zinc if I get

52:34.520 --> 52:37.640
covid or can I trust my doctor to know this?

52:38.760 --> 52:40.760
It's setting up such a

52:41.320 --> 52:43.160
a

52:43.160 --> 52:45.160
A schism

52:45.560 --> 52:49.800
Between people and their doctor. It's setting it up right now

52:50.600 --> 52:52.120
It's not

52:52.120 --> 52:55.960
Questioning the treatment based on the idea that look

52:56.680 --> 52:58.680
We know how to treat these symptoms

52:59.160 --> 53:02.920
And these symptoms are not any different than other symptoms that we've had before

53:03.560 --> 53:05.560
We're just told that they're different

53:06.120 --> 53:09.880
No doctor at this at this mic so far has said that

53:11.080 --> 53:16.120
They are definitely sure there's a new thing kids just don't kids just are not

53:16.520 --> 53:21.800
Mortality in children isn't that high children are not super spreaders children don't spread it to their teachers

53:22.520 --> 53:24.840
Normalize the lives of our children

53:26.840 --> 53:30.680
There is a cure for covid right after the nazi comparison she made

53:31.400 --> 53:35.400
Man when you look back at this, this isn't that great. This is not that good

53:36.360 --> 53:38.360
This frightens me now

53:46.920 --> 53:53.640
Dr. Emmanuel also known as warrior before I introduced the next guest. I just want to say that

53:54.520 --> 53:59.640
I wish all doctors that are listening to this bring that kind of passion to their patients and the study that dr

53:59.640 --> 54:03.960
Emmanuel was referring to is in virology which talks about a SARS

54:05.000 --> 54:08.680
Viral epidemic that affects the lungs that came from china

54:09.480 --> 54:11.480
And they didn't know what would work

54:11.480 --> 54:13.480
The studies show that chloroquine would work

54:13.960 --> 54:16.760
It sounds exactly like it could have been written three months ago

54:17.080 --> 54:19.080
But in fact that's studying virology

54:19.320 --> 54:24.920
Which was published by the nih the national institute of health when dr. Anthony fauci was the director

54:25.320 --> 54:30.520
Again the official publication of the nih virology 15 years ago

54:31.160 --> 54:36.520
Showed that chloroquine. We use hydroxychloroquine. It's the same a little safer

54:37.320 --> 54:42.920
Works they proved this 15 years ago when we got this novel coronavirus, which is not that novel

54:43.000 --> 54:46.680
It's 78 percent similar to the prior version the cove one

54:47.480 --> 54:50.680
Not surprisingly it works. I'm not going to introduce our next speaker

54:53.080 --> 54:55.080
Sorry

54:55.720 --> 54:57.720
Dr. Dan Erickson

54:58.840 --> 55:04.680
Dr. Gold asked me to talk about the lock a dr. Dan Erickson is the guy who with his

55:05.480 --> 55:07.480
Black-haired colleague

55:07.880 --> 55:14.360
In blue scrubs said at the end of a table. I think it was in los angeles and said all kinds of very intelligent things about

55:14.840 --> 55:19.960
Our previous immunity and how immunity works and how ridiculous it was that we were doing what we were doing

55:20.440 --> 55:25.720
Um, so it's it's interesting to see him here. I want me. I'm really curious as to what he's got to say

55:26.200 --> 55:31.160
Downs how effective they were and do they cause anything non-financial?

55:31.560 --> 55:35.880
They always talk about the financial, but you have to realize that lockdowns

55:36.200 --> 55:39.160
We haven't taken a 21 trillion dollar economy and locked it down

55:39.640 --> 55:43.160
So when you lock it down it causes public health issues

55:43.720 --> 55:46.520
Our suicide hotlines are up 600 percent

55:47.160 --> 55:52.120
Our spousal abuse different areas of alcoholism are all on the rise

55:52.200 --> 55:56.200
These are public health problems from a financial lockdown

55:56.600 --> 56:00.760
So we have to be clear on that fact that there is it's not like you just lock it down and have

56:01.480 --> 56:07.640
Consequences to people's jobs. They also have consequences health consequences at home. So we're

56:08.520 --> 56:13.400
You know, we're talking about having a little more of a measured approach a consistent approach

56:13.720 --> 56:17.800
If we have another spike, you know coming in cold and flu season

56:18.360 --> 56:22.360
Let's do something that's sustainable. What's sustainable? Well, we can

56:23.560 --> 56:28.600
We can socially distance and wear some masks, but we can also open the schools

56:29.240 --> 56:32.680
And open businesses so this measured approach i'm talking about

56:33.160 --> 56:38.440
Isn't made up it's going on in sweden and their deaths are about 564 per million

56:38.760 --> 56:41.480
UK full lockdown 600 deaths per million

56:41.560 --> 56:47.560
So we're seeing that the lockdowns aren't decreasing significantly the amount of deaths per million

56:47.880 --> 56:53.000
Some of their Nordic neighbors have less deaths for a variety of reason i don't have time to go into today

56:53.080 --> 57:00.040
So what my quick message here in a minute or two is just that we need to take an approach that's sustainable

57:00.520 --> 57:04.040
A sustainable approach is slowing things down

57:04.760 --> 57:09.640
Opening up schools opening up businesses and then we can allow the people to have

57:10.440 --> 57:17.560
Their independence and their personal responsibility to choose to wear masks and socially distance as opposed to putting edicts on them

57:18.200 --> 57:21.960
You know kind of controlling them let's empower them with data

57:22.360 --> 57:28.040
And let them study what other countries have done and make their own decision. That's what i'd like to share. Thank you

57:29.000 --> 57:33.400
I want to listen to that a little bit again because he did say interesting things hold on

57:33.960 --> 57:37.960
Aren't decreasing significantly the amount of deaths per million

57:38.280 --> 57:43.400
Some of their Nordic neighbors have less deaths for a variety of reason i don't have time to go into today

57:43.480 --> 57:50.440
So what my quick message here in a minute or two is just that we need to take an approach that's sustainable

57:50.920 --> 57:54.440
A sustainable approach is slowing things down

57:55.160 --> 58:00.040
Opening up schools opening up businesses and then we can allow the people to have

58:00.840 --> 58:07.960
Their independence and their personal responsibility to choose to wear masks and socially distance as opposed to putting edicts on them

58:08.600 --> 58:16.760
You know kind of controlling them let's empower them with data and let them study what other countries have done and make their own decision

58:16.920 --> 58:18.920
That's what i'd like to share. Thank you

58:20.360 --> 58:23.000
Now that still seems to me

58:23.560 --> 58:29.160
I mean, I'm not saying it's his intention, but that still seems to me to set up a position where if I go to

58:29.720 --> 58:36.280
Home Depot this weekend. I can expect to have a lot of people think it's my personal responsibility to put on a mask

58:37.000 --> 58:43.080
Not my he didn't say my choice. He didn't say anything about sovereignty. He didn't say anything about our rights

58:44.280 --> 58:51.000
As as free human beings. He said let it be let's give them data and then let's make it their personal

58:51.080 --> 58:57.240
You know put it their personal responsibility his basically coercing us. I'm sorry, but it is

58:57.240 --> 59:01.240
It's the wrong language. It's shitty language. I'm going to just say it

59:01.800 --> 59:09.960
And i'm disappointed that that he said that when his original message when he was at that table was all about natural immunity and health

59:10.680 --> 59:16.600
And the microbiome and how this was much more complicated than than what they were telling us on the tv

59:17.000 --> 59:20.840
And now he gets invited and then he's supposed to say these things

59:21.560 --> 59:24.280
A sustainable approach. How long do you want it to go?

59:31.640 --> 59:34.920
I don't I didn't like that that one at all. I didn't like that at all

59:34.920 --> 59:38.520
I would I'm actually very disappointed in that that was not good

59:39.960 --> 59:41.960
That wasn't good at all

59:46.440 --> 59:49.800
Hmm that's shocking to me. That's unfortunate. Sorry

59:52.840 --> 59:55.000
Are there any questions? Are there any questions?

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.280
Why are you guys here so excited why i'm from the south of coda? You might have a question

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.280
Yes, yes, so

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.240
You know south to cody did something interesting and it's interesting that you're from there

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.240
So the governor did not restrict access to hydroxychloroquine

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.200
I'm saying that he didn't say that it's a it's a choice

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.880
I hope i'm not arguing with you maggie, but I just want to clarify

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.280
I don't care if people want to wear masks. That's fine with me wear masks

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.720
But if you start to use words like personal responsibility and let's arm them with data

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.520
Then basically he's saying let's argue about it

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.240
Let's let's have people give each other papers about whether or not they should wear a mask

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.760
And so

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.120
Already making it a question that we have to answer

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:44.280
And then you get somebody like my brother who will say well

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:50.600
It doesn't hurt you it bit better to err on that side wouldn't it be the better to safe than sorry, wouldn't it be

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.880
I mean you got some personal responsibility to the rest of the people around you, don't you?

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.840
That's exactly how my brother got suckered in

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.320
And so I don't think that message was very good. It didn't really help us at all even though it's supposed to sound like it did

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.160
I don't think it did

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.440
Right

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.760
Right and you were I believe you were the only state in the union that did that and

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.560
There's been studies out there that

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.000
To show that it doesn't work they're inaccurate because they're given at the wrong time the wrong dose the wrong patient either too much

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.120
Or at the long time so south dakota did better because it had access to hydroxychloroquine. Thank you so much

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.600
That's the number one question we're all asked every day

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.960
Oh my gosh

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.960
How can I get it so the congressman can't get it. It's tough luck for the average american joe getting it

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.600
It's very difficult. You have to overcome a few hurdles. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.200
Read the science with a critical eye and have eliminated the job science

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.280
Many studies have been retracted as you know

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.200
And number two the pharmacists they show anymore. Oh wow

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.200
There's almost nobody there

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.520
Did something interesting and it's interesting that you're from there

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.440
So the governor did not restrict access to hydroxychloroquine

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.520
Right

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.040
Right and you were I believe you were the only state in the union that did that

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.880
How can we see how can we see this as anything other than a stunt then

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.480
I'm sorry. I guess I was being silly. I thought this was kind of like a rally

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.280
You know like their supporters were there

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.680
But they all just flew there and put on white coats and stood out in the sun and and had somebody film them

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.280
This is the same thing that uh

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.280
That james lion's wiler did somewhere in downtown pittsburgh at city hall or something

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.320
Just put on a suit and went there and gave an announcement about a lab leak or some sh i mean

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240
What is going on other than

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.200
Absolute theater here

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.360
Now it doesn't have to be

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.720
Theater that all these people don't I mean they can take it seriously

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.400
I'm not saying that you know, maybe they some of them actually think wow we have to do this

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.120
There's a great idea. I think it says everything we need to say

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.240
We'll put it up on social media. It's going to go viral and we'll get this message out and they think but

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:26.200
You could also see that as the people with this idea are part of those tug-of-war saboteurs

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.160
Setting it up

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:35.000
This is how we're going to do it and and the people some of these people in the background are good people and some of them aren't

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:45.080
And because of the commitment to the national security priority because of the commitment to climbing the ladder of the elite ruling class

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.600
The people that are the medallors in this group are never ever

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320
Going to break character ever

01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:00.200
Not late at night at the poker table not early in the morning over coffee and breakfast

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Not on the beach in the sun

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360
That's what you're dealing with

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.760
Once you see it, I think it's very very simple and

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.600
There's been studies out there that attempt to show that it doesn't work

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.040
They're inaccurate because they're given at the wrong time the wrong dose the wrong patient

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.120
Either too much or at the long time. So south Dakota did better because it had access to our directive coroquine. Thank you so much

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.280
That's the number one question we're all asked every day. I want you to know that you're not alone

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.680
I've had many congressman ask me. How can I get it? So the congressman can't get it

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.240
It's tough luck for the average american joe getting it. It's very difficult

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.200
You have to overcome a few hurdles your doctor has to have read the science with a critical eye

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.280
And have eliminated the junk science many studies have been retracted as you know

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:07.720
And number two the pharmacist has to not restrict it many states have empowered their pharmacists to not honor physician prescription

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.680
That's never happened before that interference with the doctor patient relationship where the patient talks to the doctor

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.040
Honestly and the doctor answers the patient honestly has been violated

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.000
So you have a very difficult time as the average american

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.920
Some of the information we'll share later this afternoon is to show the mortality rates in countries where it's not restricted

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.240
And the mortality rates where it is restricted. So i friends all over the world now because of this

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.240
And in indonesia

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.040
You can just buy it over the counter. It's in the vitamin section

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.640
And i'm here to tell the american people that you could buy it over the counter in iran

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.200
Because the leaders in iran the moles in iran think that they should have more freedom than americans

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.280
I have a problem with that

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.480
My my colleagues have problems with that. We don't like to watch patients die

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Because the most people have problems

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.480
Ways to be picking up the phone

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120
They can be calling their state

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:01.720
And their federal representatives and senators and say we are the american people

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320
Let me see what we think

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.920
You guys

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.400
Okay, thank you

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.400
Thank you, Julie. That is exactly right

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:20.840
If you hear what you're when you hear this if you're concerned and wondering why you may not be able to get access to it

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.920
We need you to make

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.040
Four calls call your governor call both of your senators and call your congressman

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.680
And tell them that you want to know why

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.640
You're not able to get access to a drug that doctors are telling you will help

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.880
End this and help us reduce the number of hospitalizations and reduce the number of deaths

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.680
Urge them to read dr. Harvey rish's

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:51.000
Study from yale. He's a Yale professor of epidemiology and from there you'll find other studies

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.880
I wanted to ask how do people press the data that they

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440
Looking at every day the numbers are so very

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.760
John Hopkins

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.600
CDC which divides

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.600
COVID deaths in different categories

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
Yeah

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.360
So the only number that I think is worth paying any attention to and even that number is not so helpful

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.840
But is mortality because that's a hard and fast number

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.200
So the case number is almost irrelevant

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.400
And that's because there's a lot of inaccuracies with the testing and also even if the test is accurate

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:34.120
Most people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. So it's not that important to know

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.720
So the case number which you see rising all the time in the news

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.840
Is basically irrelevant and if you had told us a few months ago that that was the number that the medium is going to go crazy over

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.760
We all would have just laughed at that. I mean that's essentially herd immunity. There's a lot

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.480
So here we go. I understand

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:54.520
That you can't get it right in 2020 and so i'm not saying that

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.160
That I know for sure that this is one of the medlers

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.080
um

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.080
But I don't really think

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.360
Well, I mean we're not questioning the novel virus. We're not questioning the need for novel treatments and so

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.040
Um, this is a pretty a hard hard and fast commitment to the basic idea

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.000
Lots of people out there who have tested positive without symptoms or with very mild symptoms

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.240
So the only number that's worth paying attention to is mortality when you look at the mortality

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.840
This is a disease that takes that unfortunately kills our most frail members of society

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:37.080
People with multiple comorbid conditions specifically diabetes obesity is a big one. We don't talk about that, but it is

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.760
It's a fact um coronary artery disease severe coronary artery disease people like that and also if you're older

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.120
It's a risk factor, but the biggest risk factor is if you have comorbid conditions

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:52.120
If you're young and healthy, this is not you'll get a recover if you're under 60 with no comorbid conditions

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:57.880
It's less deadly than influenza. This seems to come as great news to americans because this is not what you're being told

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.400
Um, I would say the answer is it's very difficult to get accurate numbers

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.400
We

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.480
Have a meeting with a frontline doctor

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040
And maybe I need to say that into the microphone

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.640
My message to

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.240
Dr. Anthony Fauci is to have a meeting with these frontline doctors who are seeing real patients

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.280
They're touching human skin. They're looking people in the eye

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.280
They're diagnosing them and they're helping them beat the virus

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:39.080
They're the ones who are talking to the patients have meetings with them and do it every single day and

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.320
Find out what they are learning about the virus firsthand

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.520
And this is it it's important to understand

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.800
We have doctors here who are not emergency room doctors. They're preventing doctor

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.160
Preventing patients from even hitting the emergency room

01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:00.280
So if they're only listening to emergency room or ICU at the very tragic

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.120
end

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.040
Of a person's life. They're they're not getting the full story

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.720
They need to come back and hear the earlier the earlier portion

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:14.520
And they also need to understand what the lockdowns and the fears are doing

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.800
To to patients around this country because there are a lot of unintended consequences

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.800
Which the doctors can speak about

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440
My message to Dr. Anthony Fauci is

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.640
When is the last time you put a stethoscope on a patient?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.720
That when you start seeing patients like we see on a daily basis

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:40.920
You will understand the frustration that we feel and you need to start feeling for American people like we the frontline doctors feel

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.680
I need to start

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.440
Realizing that they are listening to you and if they are gonna listen to you

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.120
You got to give them a message of hope. You got to give them a message

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.600
That goes with what you already know that hydroxychloroquine works

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.320
You mentioned before some remarkable results that you had

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160
We're working on publishing it right now

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.600
We're working on that, but this is what I'll say people like doctors tell me all the time publish the data

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.000
And my question is and that will make you see patients. There's no data around the world

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.960
Yes, my data will come out when that comes out. That's great

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.120
But right now people are dying. So my data is not important for you to see patients

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.880
I'm saying that to my colleagues out there that talk about data data data

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
There is a lot

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.520
On this not every clinician needs to publish that data to be taken seriously

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.200
That media has not covered it. There is a time that is true

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:54.360
And I think that that's one of the arguments that a lot of people were making very early on doctors should have been talking to one another

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.400
And this would have spread very quickly if there was something to treat

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:04.120
And there's something that worked then doctors would have shared this information by themselves. It would have done just fine

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.920
And that was what peter mcculler for example has cited is so strange

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.720
And one of the reasons why they really needed peter mcculler to be under control

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:22.280
Was because very early on he pointed out that why don't all of these prestigious institutions have their own covid protocol

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:33.160
All of these prestigious institutions have their own protocols for everything that's different than the other prestigious institutions has their own special twist on it

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.520
But with regard to covid everybody did it exactly like they were told from the exact same playlist

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.320
And

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.560
None of these people are talking about that problem. There's no talk about misuse of ventilators here

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.840
There's no talk about misuse of oxygenation in people

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.400
No questioning how people are treated just that they should get hydroxychloroquine instead of the other things

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120
that are killing them

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.680
So it's not really

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.880
Saying what needs to be said yet, right and maybe it's too early, but you know

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.800
I'm just pointing out that

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.520
That how far and deep we were and if the consensus was this in the summer of 2020, can you forgive me?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960
For not having figured it out yet

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.880
Because this is part of the illusion of consensus. These people are supposed to be resisting

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
But they have accepted the virus

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.640
They're sure there's a virus. They treat people 15 people a day

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.680
Is what she said or 50

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.800
I don't know

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.480
It's it's it's something to see it really is just see it. I've got a compendium on america's front line

01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:00.200
Doctors.com. Yep. There is a compendium of all the studies that work with hydroxychloroquine the mortality rate was publishing

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:05.640
Detroit less than it was July 4th weekend. They publish it mortality by half in the in the critically ill patients

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.560
the patients who

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.800
Are get it early. It's been estimated that one half to three quarters of those patients wouldn't be dead

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.360
We're talking 70,000 to 105 70 to 100,000 patients would still be alive if we had followed this policy

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440
There's plenty of published aid. I'm sorry

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.880
Dr. Reach published data recently. So there's a lot of data out there. They don't need mine to make it to reach again

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.760
Just a few days ago

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.320
Who's that guy?

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.320
Who's that tall dude?

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.600
As from your perspective, do you feel that this is the power forward?

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.200
Possibly died from some other condition. It was wrongly attributed to probate 19

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.480
Or there's some other reason why she would have died. I will not I will not be able to say that till I look at it

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.480
He was the power forward. The little girl girls

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:58.840
History and whatever happened. I know I've taken care of a lot of family members and I and I see a lot of children

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.120
And they usually get mild symptoms back and I talk about it kids that I've not looked at

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.720
What was the age of the child again?

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.160
Okay, so listen there are children who are dying of this infection

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.320
And the reality is that when they do die they seem to have comorbidities

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:16.120
Really you have to kind of look at the each individual

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.960
Case

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:25.960
Uniquely there have been a little over 30 patients in the entire country in the age category of 15 and below who have died of covid

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.880
Frequently they do have comorbidities like heart disease. They have asthma. They have other pulmonary issues

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.080
So I I don't know we don't know the answer to this nine-year-old girl tragically. She passed

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.680
It could get viral pneumonia and not get antibiotics and die

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.760
They could get sepsis from that they could get I mean

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.640
It's incredible

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.000
There are children dying from this disease says the doctor

01:15:53.480 --> 01:16:00.200
Dang it. This really got us. I mean this really got us then she's no longer with this, but

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.600
There's probably if you dig into it, there's probably a story behind it

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.880
I mean, I think that is it is common knowledge that the with the schools not

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:21.160
Not being open when you think about what your experience in junior high and high school. What do you think about?

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.720
You think about parties and you think about football games party socializing those are the things we think about

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Nobody's nobody's having

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.560
And I will tell you that these are critical years of life to be out mixing with other kids

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.360
Other people and that is been shut down. So yes, there are lots of comorbidities

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.800
Uh that go along with shutting down. We're talking about anxiety. We're talking about depression loneliness

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:49.640
Uh

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.640
Abuse is happening

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120
And kids who have particular

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:02.200
Children who have special needs kids are not doing well either. So there is a long list of complications that occur when you

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.760
quarantine and lockdown people

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.600
Moms go back to school that the elderly grandparents are right. Well, there you know, this is the big

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:29.240
Sure. Yeah, this is a big issue because people are afraid not that their children are going to get particularly ill because I think they're

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.680
Learning the the truth that this infection is is being tolerated well by children

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.080
But certainly they look at their environment. They're a particular unique family

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.840
And I think in some situations that may be an appropriate fear

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:47.480
However, I do think that as a general comment

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.320
A general rule through the country kids can go back to school

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.640
Maybe a few kids here and there they you know, they're a living situation

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.840
Who they're being cared for that can be a potential problem

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.000
But again for younger children in particular, they're not the ones passing on the disease to the adults

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.400
Well, hydroxychloroquine. Yeah, I mean

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.560
Well, you want to give kids that that can be done. Yes, that can be used

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960
Okay

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.600
Okay, we're talking about we can't go to open our businesses we can go to school and

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:33.640
Parents are scared to get treated and I personally have put over a hundred people on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.600
Doctors teachers people health care workers my staff me

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.280
I see over

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.600
15 to 20 sometimes 20 15 10 patients a day. I use a surgical mask

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.360
I've not been infected. Nobody. I know has been infected. That's around me

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:54.840
So this is the answer to this question. You want to open schools everybody get on hydroxychloroquine

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.120
That is the prevention for covid one tablet

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.160
Every other week is good enough and that is what we need to get across the american people

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.200
There's prevention and there is cure. We don't have to lock down schools. We don't have to lock down our businesses

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.760
There's prevention and there is cure. So instead of talking about mask instead of talking about lockdowns

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:20.200
So it would be just crazy right of this lady who treated pneumonia or I mean malaria before in her career

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.040
Just had the answer wouldn't it? It would be just crazy if peter de varro ordered like

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.360
Hundreds of thousands of pills to be put in the national stockpile. It would be crazy if

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.120
Several

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.360
Factories that make the precursor to hydroxychloroquine started on fire

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.760
in 2020

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.760
It would be just crazy wouldn't it?

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.520
I think zebzalenko was giving hydroxychloroquine to

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.560
to people in um

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.320
in uh

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.440
Congress

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.760
Along with zinc of course. Yeah, but all these things put our teachers on hydroxychloroquine

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.840
Put those that are high risk on hydroxychloroquine those that want it if you want to catch covid

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.920
That's cool, but you should be given the right to take it and be prevented

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.360
So that's the message. We don't all this stuff that we're putting together

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:18.200
It's not necessary because hydroxychloroquine has a prevention. It's called hydroxychloroquine is a prevention for covid

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.680
Droxychloroquine

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.480
Cure

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.440
Doctors have used it, but they use it in the wrong dosage. So I keep hearing the drug

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.440
But then what is the right dose?

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.480
Yeah, that you're gonna discuss with you. That's a gonna discuss with your doctor. Well, let me make the product also take that

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:52.520
Yeah, that's a that's a great question because the fear of this drug has driven the the the whole

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.840
Political situation has driven the fear towards this drug. So let's address that this drug is super safe

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.760
It's safer than aspirin motrin towel and all it's super safe. All right

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:09.480
So what the problem is in a lot of those studies they did very very high doses massive doses all through the country

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.120
They did the remap study the solidarity trial

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.440
That was the world health organization trial and also the recovery trial

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:17.560
They used

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:20.600
2,400 milligrams in the first day all you need is

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.720
200 twice a week for prophylaxis

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:30.680
They used massive toxic doses and guess what they found out when you use massive toxic doses you get toxic results

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.040
The drug doesn't work when you give toxic doses. Okay, there are very it's a very safe drug

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.800
It concentrates in the lungs 200 to 700 times higher in the lungs

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.800
It's an amazing drug because in the bloodstream you're not going to get high levels

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.640
But you get massive levels in the lungs

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.520
So you're going to find yourself if you're prophylaxis

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.520
As soon as the virus gets there, it's going to have a hard time getting through because the

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.960
Hydroxchloroquine blocks it from getting in and then once it gets in

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.520
It won't let the virus

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:03.560
It won't let it actually replicate it actually actually bring in zinc and zinc will there it is

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.040
That's up the copy machine called the RDRP. So with with the combination of drugs

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.960
It's incredibly effective in the early disease by itself. It's incredibly effective as a prophylaxis

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.520
So I hope that is that answer the question

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.200
Yeah, I

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.680
I want to emphasize on something that dr. Ursa just said because I love the question

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:29.000
This is a treatment regimen. That's very simple and it should be in the hands of the american people the difficult

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:33.000
Aspect of this is that at the moment because of politics

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:38.360
It's being blocked from doctors prescribing it and it's being blocked from pharmacists

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.120
Releasing it they've been empowered to overrule the doctor's opinion

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.120
Why is this not over the counter as you can get it in much of the world in almost all of latin america in iran in indonesia

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:58.040
In sub-Saharan africa, you can just go and buy it yourself and the dose my friends is 200 milligrams twice in a week

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
And zinc daily

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400
That's the dose

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:08.040
I'm in favor of it being over the counter. Give it to the people. Give it to the people

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.720
This information

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.360
Hi, I'm uh, i'm dr. James there. I just want to add a couple comments to what dr. Gold was saying

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.720
If it if it seems like there is an orchestrated attack that's going on against hydroxychloroquine

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.160
It's because there is when have you ever heard of a medication generating this degree of controversy

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:36.680
A 65 year old medication that has been a the world health organizations safe essential list of medications for years

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.080
Okay, it's over the counter in many countries

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
And what we're seeing is a lot of information

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.920
So I co-authored the first document on hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:50.920
This is back in march and that kind of kicked off a whole series of of a storm on it

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.120
and

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.520
Since then there's been a tremendous amount of censorship on doctors like us and what we're saying and in

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.400
A number of us have already been such a that google document that I co-authored was actually pulled down by google

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.720
And this is after now many studies have shown that it is effective and it is safe

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.320
I wholeheartedly agree with the person in the chat saying that I think zinc is a large portion of it

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.520
Zinc is a co-factor for a lot of enzymes that

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320
regulate

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:23.080
Well stuff in the cell and let's not try to pretend that we understand too many details of this because

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:29.240
We know and acknowledge that a lot of this the sort of underlying science is probably questionable at best

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.760
But we do know

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.880
That many protein machines need other

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520
Big ions as a sort of

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:45.720
Central core that provides a sort of electric potential a ionic potential that otherwise can't be created by a full protein

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.440
But if you can fold the protein in such a way that it can kind of take advantage of

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.760
the extreme

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.080
Sort of polarity of such an ion

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.360
Then you can create a machine using that in an interaction with water

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.520
I found this wonderful video today where this guy's trying to explain how protein folding works

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
and he talks about water like

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.480
wind

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:16.440
Not ever evoking the charge aspect of it never evoking the idea that some amino acids have a different charge distribution than others

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.880
Not evoking the idea of hydrogen bonds and how those might work not evoking the idea of how organized

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.560
Lattices of water could change the way that proteins fold

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.440
And

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:35.880
So if proteins come out of a ribosome into a highly organized lattice of water then there will be a certain way that they will fold

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:42.120
If they come out of a ribosome in an unorganized lattice of water they may fold differently

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.320
If they come out of a ribosome with a number of charged proteins

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.600
localized around the opening of the ribosome they may come out in and yet another shape

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560
And so it's very very

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.800
Interesting to see this because I think as the zinc ionophore has

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.760
Has basically quesareton. I don't know how to say it, but that's how you spell it

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.840
um this green tea extract that um

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.000
that

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.160
Zeb Zolenko was saying was the most effective zinc ionophore

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.520
and

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.600
And zinc itself

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.840
And in fact Zeb Zolenko one of his last videos that he filmed in his car

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.640
Was that quesareton and zinc

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:34.840
Was good against any RNA virus and so this was a national security secret

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:40.360
And if they deploy anything else in the future you still got to turn to

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.320
Zinc and a zinc ionophore and I don't think it's crazy. I think it's actually sound

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.400
Biology because that's about all we know about enzymes is that they they have co-factors

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:58.840
And zinc is one of them and a lot of us could be short on zinc because of the food that we choose to eat

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:09.080
You still can't read that article and there's also this misinformation out there and unfortunately

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.360
This has reached the the highest orders of medicine

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.080
In may there was an article published in the lancet. So this is one of the world's most prestigious medical journals in the world. Okay

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.720
The world health organization

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:29.720
Stocked all their clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine because of the study and it was independent researchers like us who care about patients who care about the truth

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.240
That dug into the study and determined that it was actually fabricated data

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.480
The data was not real

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.560
And it was so we did this so convincing that this study was retracted by lancet less than two weeks after it's published

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.200
It's almost unheard of especially for I think an acetyl cysteine is a

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.520
Antioxidant more than anything else. I'm not really down with that

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:58.440
I'll tell you why I'm not down with nac because I used to use nac to make brain slices in my mice and

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.160
If I replaced sodium

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:09.080
With I you part of part of my replacement was nac and

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560
If

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.720
If you use too much of it the recordings didn't work if you use too much of it other weird things happened and so I don't know I

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.840
Somebody sent me some I'm not

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:29.960
I didn't I'm not taking any of that. I don't know what it does. I don't understand it. It could be great. But um for me

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400
Quasaritin and zinc

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.000
Seems legit

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.560
Hydroxychloroquine probably works in a similar way as far as I understand it's a zinc ionophore

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.560
So again, hydroxychloroquine could be ideally suited for this

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.600
And that's why we're not talking about hydroxychloroquine. We're talking about ivermectin for the last few years

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:55.800
Study of this magnitude. So it's you know, I apologize to to everyone for the fact there is so much misinformation out there

01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.920
It's so hard to find the truth and unfortunately it's going to take looking at other places for for the truth

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:07.000
It's going to be that's why we formed frontline doctors here to try to help get the the real information out there

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.200
I'm dr. James today. Oh

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.440
Yeah, so um most of my thoughts. I actually publish on twitter

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.080
This twitter has been great lately. So my my james tadaro m d t o d a r o

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:28.680
Md but I also have a website medicine uncensored.com which contains kind of a lot of the information about hydroxychloroquine

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.200
I think is is much more objective than what's going on in other media channels

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.680
For twitter there

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.000
So so i'll go ahead and address that real quickly

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:56.520
I would say facebook and youtube have taken the most draconian measures to silence and censorship people

01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:02.040
And this is coming from the ceo of youtube as well as marx dockerburg saying anything that goes against what the world health organization has said

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.960
Is subject to censorship and we all know the world health organization has made a number of mistakes during this pandemic

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.360
They have not been perfect by any means twitter

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:16.200
Although they have some flaws and faults and flags certain contents of they really still remain one of the freest

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:22.760
platforms to share dialogue intelligent discussion regarding this information and many of us here today actually

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:26.200
Connected on social platform mediums like that

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.880
Sure thing sure

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:42.440
Dr. Joe latipo i'm a physician at ucla and i'm a clinical researcher also

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.120
And i'm speaking for myself and not on behalf of ucla

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:54.840
So i i want to say that um so i'm thinking of the people who are behind the screens that that are watching what you guys are broadcasting

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:02.920
And i want to share with you because there's there's so much controversy and and the atmosphere so full of of conflict right now

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:07.640
That what this group of doctors is trying to do

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.440
Fundamentally is really to bring more light

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.920
To this conversation about how we manage

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:24.120
COVID-19 and the the huge challenge and that's what this is that's what this is ultimately about

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.760
And bringing light to something means

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.840
Thinking more about trade-offs about one of my colleagues said um

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:42.120
Unintended consequences and i actually think that's not even the right uh that's not the right word the right word is unanticipated consequences

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:48.920
Really thinking about the implications of the decisions we're making in this really

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.720
You know really extraordinary time that we're in

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.080
So, you know, so i'm sure people are listening to some of the discussion about

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:02.200
um hydroxychloroquine and wondering what are these doctors talking about and you know

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:07.800
These are these are doctors that take care of patients board certified med school great med schools all of that

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.520
You know, how could they possibly be saying this?

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.840
You know, i walk cnn and nbc and they don't say anything about this

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.960
And and that's actually that's the point. There's like there's um

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:25.480
There are issues that are moral issues that really there should be a singular voice, you know, so for me, you know

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:33.240
Issues related to whether people are treated differently based on their sex or race or you know or or you know

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:38.280
There's sexual orientation. I think those are I personally think those are moral issues and there's only one

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.120
Position on those but coven 19 is not a moral issue

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:48.760
Coven 19 is a challenging complex issue that we benefit from having multiple perspectives on

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:56.440
So it's not good for the american people when everyone is hearing one perspective on the main on the main stations

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.560
There's just there's no way that's going to service

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.760
So, you know, so the perspective most people have been hearing is that hydroxychloroquine

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:10.840
Doesn't work, right? That's the perspective that most people have been hearing on the main street television

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.920
And I believe that perspective too

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:20.120
Until I started talking to doctors who would look more closely that some of the physicians behind me here

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.720
Would look more closely at the data and at the studies

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:28.840
So it is a fact that several randomized trials have come out so far

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:34.680
That's our highest level of evidence and have shown that hydroxychloroquine their findings have generally been

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.880
There's no significant effect on health in those on on

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.200
There's no significant health benefit

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:46.840
So that's the fact that the randomized controlled trials have come out to so far that have come out

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.840
In fact, there were two or three big ones that came out over the last two weeks and annals of internal medicine newly journal of medicine

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.080
And I think one other journal

01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.360
It is also a fact that there have been several observational studies

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.960
So these are just not randomized controlled trials but patients who are getting treated with this medication

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.360
That have found that hydroxychloroquine improves outcomes

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.160
So both of those things are true. So there's evidence against it and there's evidence for it

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:19.880
It is also a fact that we are in an extraordinarily challenging time

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.840
So I find this interesting because

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:30.200
Domain already kicked out the name ivermectin domain already kicked out the name remdesivir domain already kicked out the name

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.880
Coxib and already kicked out the name femotadi

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.320
And yet these doctors are

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:41.160
Are very adamant that it's actually hydroxychloroquine

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:49.960
That works and haven't mentioned any of those other drugs that the flcc all uses in combination, right? They use all kinds of different things

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:56.600
And this group is really hydroxychloroquine and zinc hydroxychloroquine and zinc right to the

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.840
Finish line which is an interesting just just note that that's what we have here

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.640
Again, you could see this as

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:12.120
As a certain team a certain side there's a very distinct opinion that's different from the other side that might say

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.720
Ivermectin or or something like that. So I find it

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.120
Given those given those considerations

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.880
How can the right answer be to limit?

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.000
How can the right answer be to limit?

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.680
Physicians use of the medication that that can't possibly be the right answer

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.160
And when you consider that this medication before coven 19 had been used for decades, right?

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:45.560
By patients with rheumatoid arthritis by patients with lupus by patients with other conditions by patients who needed, you know

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.800
Who are traveling to west africa and needed malaria prophylaxis?

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.720
They we've been using it for a long time, but all of a sudden it's

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.360
It's elevated to this area of looking like some poisonous drug

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.080
That that just doesn't make sense

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.120
And and then when you add on to that the fact that we've had two

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.560
Of the biggest journals in the world new normal journal of medicine and lancet as my colleagues say retract studies that found

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.600
Interestingly that hydroxychloroquine

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:23.320
Harm patients right both of these studies and they had to retract these studies, which really is unheard of

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.680
That's that should raise everyone's concern about what is going on

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:36.360
So at the very least we can live in a world where there are differences of opinion about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:43.320
But still allow more data to come, you know still allow physicians who feel like they have expertise

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:49.800
With it use their use that medication and still you know talk and learn and and get better

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.040
At helping people with covid-19

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:58.600
So so why we're not there is is not is not good doesn't make sense and we need to get out of there

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.640
Wow, is that really an anagram?

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.520
That's a little bit of that

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.760
I have seen 350 patients and counting put them on hydroxychloroquine. They all got better

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.240
This one I would say to all those studies

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:18.120
They had high doses. They were given the wrong patients. I will call them fake science

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.960
Any study that says hydroxychloroquine doesn't work is fake science

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.840
And I want them to show me how it doesn't work

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:32.600
How is it gonna work for 350 patients for me and they are all alive and then somebody say it doesn't work guys all them studies fake science

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.680
Thank you

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:43.640
Yeah

01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.440
Yeah, I don't understand I don't understand how you would go to that conclusion

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.000
If the problem was if the schools are shut down and it's causing it and we need to open up the schools

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:10.280
Wow, that's really interesting that dynamic at that. Yeah, I would go to the school

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:16.520
I would open up the schools because the most important thing for children is to socialize and to be with other kids and to learn. Yeah

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.880
Yeah, let's get kids back in school

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.280
Kids back in school your favorite kids back and thank you everyone

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.440
Thank you very much

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:36.200
And we are going to be going back live on continuing our summit so you can continue watching

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.680
Once we get back. We may be running a couple minutes late, but we'll be back right around three o'clock

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.680
Thank you so much everyone and thank you for coming for the the press conference

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.360
Oh, he's given more statements over there

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.320
It's a fake

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.200
So depression is caused by low zinc levels and low and when you go into a hospital now

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.040
Right

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.840
Covid loss of sense of smell loss of taste right

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:15.720
And the reason is because zinc is the natural thing that used to fight the covid what happens is

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:19.000
The zinc stops RNA polymerase

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.480
And the hydroxychloroquine allows the zinc to go into the cells

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.960
I'm wondering to stop the RNA polymerase

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.000
Because there was a

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.720
It was about the period of the science behind it

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.840
So the so you so if you allow the zinc I understand and yeah, let me explain it a little bit better

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.840
The zinc stops RNA polymerase and it's used up by yourselves in the normal fighting of covid

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.680
So if you never took hydroxychloroquine, you'd still be zinc depleted

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.440
We're in a natural state of zinc depletion in the united states, but the covid decreases your zinc even more

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.840
Wow

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.840
Wait

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:03.880
So he's saying that when you fight the novel pathogen when you fight the RNA you use up your zinc

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.040
And because it's spreading around the united states right now

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.120
Everybody's in a zinc depleted state because we've been fighting

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.040
the coronavirus holy balls

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:22.040
That's that's something very special

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.360
And the insistence on needing to say the RNA polymerase that zinc fights the RNA polymerase

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.000
I want to teach you the science behind it RNA polymerase

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.080
If you're not going to tell this lady what a polymerase is what the hell does that mean to her

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920
So

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.400
Wow

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.560
I mean wow

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160
Wow

01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:02.120
Problem with children on psych units that they have losing levels

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.800
No, no, no, we're talking about the covid and how that

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:13.160
Okay, so my question was about if federal funds should be diverted to helping therapists

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:19.080
Social workers and other frontline workers to deal with the psychological issues that were meant to think of all of the

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:26.040
Think of all of the just it's a perpetual list of nonsense questions that you ask

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.080
Once you start accepting the faith in a novel virus that could kill millions of people

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:38.600
There's all kinds of crazy questions to ask what should we do about x y z a b and c

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:47.800
Wow, it's amazing and all these people think that they're engaging and figuring it out together

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:55.160
That shutdowns in the government and school closures cause an increase in suicidal ideation and substance abuse and anxiety

01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.280
But so those environmental factors are what caused those mental health issues

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:07.480
So doesn't it stand to reason that then funds to help those institutions deal with the problem should be receiving more funding

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.960
I'm going to defer to my psychiatry

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:18.040
Yeah, and then I mean first we need to take care of the biological basis

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.200
Which is the zinc?

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.600
Which is the vitamin d lack of vitamin d?

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.080
We're dumping our milk

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.920
We're dumping our milk in the gutters right in the middle pitch right now

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.000
And if we would get that to the kid that's hard to believe if we would get that to the kids out of school

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.280
That would be very helpful. Okay, so I'll defer to my

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.400
So my question. I still haven't gotten a clear answer

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.520
I'm trying to answer it's not you know public policies. Not my answer

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.520
Oh, no, it's not really about it's not my expertise either actually

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.520
I'm wondering since your colleague said that as a result of school closures and government shut

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:57.960
What caused an increase in suicidal ladies and anxiety substance abuse and a variety of other issues

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.560
I'm wondering if federal funding should be diverted to

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.480
Only a couple more minutes. It's only a couple more minutes

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.600
I see it this way

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.840
Harm has already come is what we're saying so the answer the question is harm has already come

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:17.880
Which should we do about that harm and I don't I don't know the inner workings of the government but the actual

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.200
To say that harm has already come and say that we're going to do something about it makes sense

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.720
To me as a doctor, I think if we know harm has come if you and I know we already got run over by a car

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.200
I think it makes sense. So let me go ahead and go

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.720
Yeah, so I think it makes a lot of sense. So I'm going to just say to me makes sense

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.440
And I think it's fair. I appreciate the well-rounded concern. It just kind of stops with concern and it doesn't

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.160
Continue into action

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.440
And the congressman and I'm not sure who it was. Maybe you could actually

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:54.040
Give patience in the you guys. This is not pretty bright part news

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.200
So

01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:02.120
The faith in a novel virus was definitely not questioned at all there right and it wasn't questioned at all there

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:07.000
And they actually were very certain about their particular solution hydroxychloroquine and zinc

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:12.440
Hydroxychloroquine and zinc there was nothing else at play all the ventilation doesn't matter

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.120
We don't need to talk about excess oxygen being given to people who don't need it

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.720
We don't need to talk about the irrelevance of pulse ox or

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.440
Or the role of of core morbidities and any of the other people dying co-morbidities are just in kids

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:34.600
I don't know if you noticed that or not, but that's the only time they talked about co-morbidities in people dying in hospitals was kids

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:41.800
Not adults being given remdesivir or adults that are being ventilated to stop spread or adults that are being given

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:45.640
60 liters of oxygen a minute or whatever it was that

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.600
That we found in in Mark's video that he just recently posted

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.760
And so it doesn't matter because this faith is a lie we've got to figure it out

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:06.120
But if the faith is definitely a lie and staging the pandemic required murder and that means that you need people to explain it

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360
You

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.640
Need people to make sure that you don't see it as murder

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.720
It's just that they're not giving them hydroxychloroquine and zinc

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.920
They don't mean to kill them. They're following the protocols. We've just got to get this out

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.760
If we can get this information out, I'm sure we can turn this train around

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.480
And so a trackable gain of function RNA went endemic and now we're going to

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.600
To fix the problem. That's basically it

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:44.600
That's really where they were and they didn't get any farther than that because that's all they've got and uh, we're fighting that now

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.120
Um

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.720
Not going to do the whole summary here because i'm hungry and I need to eat

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.280
Um, I hope that you understand that we are at a point now

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.280
Where

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:03.400
They have told themselves this lie for so long that AI and computers if we have enough data can solve all these problems

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.000
Can make us

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Reach the transgenic goal of of of immortality

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.200
Of uploading our consciousness, whatever it is

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.680
These lies have been told for a long long time and the people with

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:24.280
With the control over weaponized piles of money actually still believe a lot of these lies are possible in the very near future

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.320
And that's why they want us to teach this mythology of a new world order where

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:36.680
Dangerous viruses can come out of batcaves or laboratories to our children so that they can enslave our children under these

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.920
ideas

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:44.120
And it's not much different than us allowing them to use social media on our children

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:51.880
If your teenager is depressed like mine is it might be because we are allowing them to use social media that depresses them

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:57.400
We are allowing other men to control us with machines. It's not AI

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.120
It's just programming

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:08.040
You don't have to have a magic box that we don't understand what's going on when people are willing to just program things

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.040
To promote certain people and to silence other people

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.600
And then to lie about it. It's just an algorithm, man

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:24.120
Ladies and gentlemen, stop all transfections and humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:36.440
This has been giggle and biological where intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:38.680
And

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.400
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic

01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:47.240
Um, you can find me at giggle and biological.com

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:50.840
We had a little hiccup on stream dot giggle home dot bio yesterday

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920
And we testing it again today to see what happened

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:58.280
Some strip error made the stream not upload to the back server

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.280
So we're trying to fix that now. I don't know if anybody checked

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.960
The stream over there at stream dot giggle and dot bio

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:12.360
I'm gonna start I think in the next month doing a stream exclusively on that one every once in a while

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:16.200
Just to force people to try and use it so I can figure out how well

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.080
It's working for a live stream

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.000
This has been a production of the independent right way of that's a group of people who

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.960
Trust one another because of our track record and trust one another because we say what we mean

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.160
And we mean what we say we correct ourselves when necessary and we're humble enough to do that. Um

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.280
I don't know what's gonna be here

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.640
Oh, that that's funny. That's another new one. I got there

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.080
Check that out

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.520
Anyway, I'll see you guys again soon

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.080
I

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.960
Already got in touch with uh at griffin. I think i'm gonna talk to him tomorrow on the phone

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.280
He's already invited me to the red pill expo

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.600
Um, I'm so excited to talk to him. Um, it's crazy. Thank you very much for helping that happen

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:24.120
Um, there were a couple people who were working on getting me connected with

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.000
With ed griffin and it has actually happened he called me yesterday and uh, we were gonna talk today, but

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.040
Schedules got kind of crossed and so i'm gonna try and call him tomorrow, but for sure

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:43.480
Um, we are connected and that's really something that I mean is in 20 years in the making man 20 years in the making

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:48.120
So it's really exciting. Thank you very much. And uh, I'll see you guys again tomorrow

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:53.080
We're trying to make this a daily thing and i'm not i'm not trying to talk smack anymore. I'm trying to be serious

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.400
Daily
