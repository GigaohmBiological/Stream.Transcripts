WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I

01:22.120 --> 01:25.560
Have no responsibility for the current pandemic

01:30.000 --> 01:48.960
It's gonna be a real quick hit tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I have a special guest coming in town

01:49.600 --> 01:53.720
But I didn't expect so I need to run out to the airport and

01:54.480 --> 01:56.480
green and old friends

01:57.440 --> 02:01.240
I'm really excited about tonight, but I also didn't want to break the streak

02:03.240 --> 02:07.520
I didn't want to break the streak. I don't plan to break the streak anytime soon. I

02:08.240 --> 02:12.920
Think we're on evening number 19. Maybe evening number 20 in a row

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I've been wanting to do this

02:17.280 --> 02:21.600
Time if you've got to meet Bobby today, you know, what's up?

02:22.400 --> 02:25.260
If you got to meet Bobby today, then you know what's up

02:26.520 --> 02:29.440
There's some really big things happening. I don't know what it means

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
Gosh, I hope he's a good guy

02:46.480 --> 02:50.000
We love you mark just get to it when you can my friend

02:56.480 --> 02:58.480
You

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
Schedule for 60 minutes next

03:10.040 --> 03:13.200
He's going on French British Italian

03:13.840 --> 03:18.400
Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
embarrassing

03:23.200 --> 03:25.200
Oh

03:25.200 --> 03:27.860
Yeah, I forgot. I'll change this one. Sorry about that

03:31.840 --> 03:38.040
Mystery captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sure that was some plan they had

03:38.280 --> 03:41.320
first spreading the phony story about cover and

03:41.720 --> 03:45.480
Then stealing the yachts from the marina that night on the beach

03:45.760 --> 03:51.360
Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of shit. Yeah, but like his diving suit

03:51.360 --> 03:53.960
Got covered with that coopy glowing seaweed

03:56.520 --> 04:00.080
And that's where the glowing ghost story came from well

04:08.720 --> 04:13.880
How did Scooby do with that I guess that's another mystery

04:21.600 --> 04:24.720
All right, here we go ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
Oh

04:48.000 --> 04:51.720
Good afternoon good evening good morning and good night wherever you are in this planet

04:51.720 --> 04:56.560
This is giggle and biological high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

04:56.560 --> 04:58.560
It's the 24th of September

04:59.880 --> 05:02.480
2023 and we are still fighting

05:02.920 --> 05:08.760
this limited but lively spectrum of debate about gain a function virus and

05:09.320 --> 05:12.000
About how the protocols just simply don't matter

05:16.160 --> 05:20.240
Thank you Jessica Hockett, thank you Dennis Rancor

05:21.120 --> 05:26.120
Thank you mark you satanic. Thank you Nick Hudson. Thank you

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
To Thomas Binder

05:28.800 --> 05:30.800
Thank you to Peter McCullough

05:31.640 --> 05:36.760
Thank you to Robert F Kennedy Jr. Thank you to everybody who's speaking out against

05:37.400 --> 05:42.240
The scam that is the childhood vaccination schedule in the United States of America

05:42.240 --> 05:48.160
You're dang right, I'm saying it. I'm saying it out loud

05:48.160 --> 05:51.720
I'm not gonna be ashamed of it anymore. This is the way we need to talk

05:52.920 --> 05:55.080
Because they're gonna talk like we're crazy

05:55.640 --> 05:59.920
So we might as well push it all the way over the finish line and all the way into the end zone

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
Because they're gonna say we're cheating anyway

06:04.560 --> 06:06.960
And so we need to dunk the ball we need to

06:07.840 --> 06:11.960
Spike the ball and the touchdown. We need to do whatever they do and rugby to celebrate

06:12.480 --> 06:15.560
We need to take a slide on the grass like they do in football

06:17.520 --> 06:19.320
Because it's time

06:19.320 --> 06:22.120
No more bait on TV. No more bait on social media

06:22.760 --> 06:25.200
Transfection is not immunization and we know it

06:26.320 --> 06:28.560
More importantly, we knew that they knew it

06:29.720 --> 06:33.640
More importantly, we know that they knew it before before it was ever

06:34.040 --> 06:39.800
Transfection when it was just intramuscular injection of chemicals into your muscle

06:40.840 --> 06:42.200
Yeah

06:42.200 --> 06:46.720
Injection into your muscle with the idea of augmenting your immune system. No more

06:48.040 --> 06:52.240
We're gonna finally be honest about this that we've been protecting these companies and

06:53.360 --> 06:55.960
funneling massive profits into their coffers

06:56.920 --> 06:58.440
while they

06:58.440 --> 06:59.960
then

07:00.000 --> 07:08.160
Sort of worked the other way with the CDC and the FDA. This is done and we are going to wake up. I'm convinced

07:09.640 --> 07:14.680
We're gonna wake up because these people definitely have changed our minds about how we think about stuff and

07:16.160 --> 07:21.160
We are waking up to the fact that these people have done this. We are waking up to their inconsistencies

07:22.200 --> 07:28.520
We are waking up to how they changed our mind about this biology. We are waking up about what they did in the hospitals

07:29.960 --> 07:33.640
and what these lies and these exaggerations led to and

07:34.600 --> 07:38.760
how they continue to lie and exaggerate and distract and

07:40.360 --> 07:46.120
Get everybody on social media and on the skilled TV watchers in the world think they're solving the mystery

07:49.160 --> 07:57.720
And of course they've lied to us about the pandemic potential found in coronavirus is ordered invert our human rights into human privileges or human permissions

07:58.440 --> 08:01.200
And they've done this through a carefully crafted narrative

08:02.200 --> 08:06.160
People all over the internet involved in one way or another

08:06.920 --> 08:08.920
with the idea that there's a

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
crazy new novel virus

08:11.480 --> 08:13.480
everybody was vulnerable to and

08:14.680 --> 08:21.640
Therefore we had to shut down the mRNA probably is saving lots of people at least they're really old or sick or core morbid and

08:22.440 --> 08:29.720
And now it's pretty much the conclusion of these people over here that it's a gain-of-function virus and that's why it was so bad

08:31.560 --> 08:35.880
And anybody that's questioning the protocols the spread or the variants is ignored

08:39.160 --> 08:46.160
And so we've been making maps of these people trying to shift these people around Peter McCollum made a huge move a couple days ago

08:47.680 --> 08:51.120
Robert Malone we've watched a few videos with him and

08:51.640 --> 08:54.120
a person who was arrested at the January 6th

08:55.480 --> 08:57.480
Uprising or whatever the hell it's called

08:58.280 --> 09:01.120
We streamed with multiple times multiple times

09:02.040 --> 09:03.560
control

09:03.560 --> 09:10.800
There's no other way to see it because if he was streaming with Crichel and now George Webb is his bad guy

09:13.320 --> 09:16.680
Then this is all one big web of of fiction

09:17.560 --> 09:21.880
All one big story. Are they trying to get people to go away from antibodies?

09:22.320 --> 09:27.600
Are they trying to get big pharma to go away from antibodies and two of these more trustworthy patents?

09:28.680 --> 09:32.160
Or maybe these patents that Robert Malone had are all expired now

09:34.920 --> 09:38.120
Maybe new antibody patents are ever more difficult to get

09:39.240 --> 09:43.080
And so maybe this is the new way forward because there's no way to get

09:43.720 --> 09:49.720
That we have to understand this because that's what these people are involved with that's what this distraction is all about

09:51.840 --> 09:55.440
It's not money. It's only money and so far as money is power

09:56.440 --> 09:59.240
This is for all the marbles ladies and gentlemen

10:02.240 --> 10:07.200
So we've talked about Paul Cottrell and Robert Malone connected to one another we've talked about Peter McCollum

10:07.200 --> 10:12.360
famous case of the M&R and what he just said the reason I mentioned this is you've had the

10:12.960 --> 10:18.320
Your your your change in kind of you around vaccines in general has also

10:19.600 --> 10:25.960
coincided with your I don't know if it's a reacquaintance with or an acquaintance with the case of Wakefield

10:25.960 --> 10:31.360
So what so for the Brits here just to hear this wrong. Do you think he was perhaps right all along?

10:31.360 --> 10:35.000
I think he was right all along and I think he will be vindicated

10:35.640 --> 10:41.240
Absolutely, so do you agree with test and have you as your do you move to my view has changed now?

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
I can tell you if I was a young parent today

10:45.240 --> 10:52.200
What I would do is I would forgo the vaccines. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I can't be I'm a pin cushion

10:52.200 --> 10:57.680
I took all these vaccines know what I am though is I'm now vaccine risk aware

10:58.280 --> 11:04.680
And let me tell you what Andy Wakefield was right and all Andy Wakefield was saying is that maybe it's too

11:04.720 --> 11:09.440
Intense, maybe we ought to just kind of spread him out. That's all he was really saying

11:11.800 --> 11:15.640
This is a gigantic moves right that changed the playing board a little bit

11:15.640 --> 11:20.240
We have to move things around and figure out what's going on here. That's what we're doing

11:20.800 --> 11:23.560
We're paying attention and letting people speak for themselves

11:25.560 --> 11:31.000
Lots of these people here have spoken for themselves throughout this whole three years Paul Catrell for sure

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
Kevin McCarron for sure

11:33.640 --> 11:39.920
Richard Fleming for sure Robert Malone for sure Steve Kerr's for sure all you have to do is look up what they said in

11:40.320 --> 11:45.120
2020 21 22 and you can see that they all deserve red squares

11:45.960 --> 11:51.360
They're not fighting for our freedom. They're not fighting for our sovereignty. They're not fighting to save

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
millions of people from making a mistake

11:55.520 --> 12:00.960
And so none of these people spoke out against the shot none of them are speaking out against the shot

12:01.000 --> 12:03.240
Otherwise, it's really simple. Don't do it

12:04.560 --> 12:11.520
Transfection is an immunization. They're real easy sentences. They don't require an hour-long podcast. You can just say it

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
tweet it

12:15.600 --> 12:17.600
But they don't

12:18.440 --> 12:23.080
You can just say that well the childhood vaccination schedules out of our control because we let it be

12:23.600 --> 12:26.880
Since 1986 you could just say that but they don't

12:26.880 --> 12:28.880
And

12:28.880 --> 12:34.240
Because a lot of these people in this picture don't say it you shouldn't trust them because that's where we are

12:35.000 --> 12:40.960
That's the dividing line. It's not lab leak or natural virus. It's not long COVID or not if you believe in it

12:41.400 --> 12:46.840
It's not whether there's a virus or not what it is is about whether public health is bullshit or not

12:48.440 --> 12:52.720
Whether what these people are selling is real or snake oil. That's what this is about

12:53.280 --> 12:59.120
It's not about some people. It's about the whole plan and the execution of it

13:04.240 --> 13:12.080
I'll stop stop that's escape escape escape what in my world am I doing? I didn't change that fast enough and so I don't have that up

13:13.160 --> 13:15.160
And I needed to be this one

13:16.880 --> 13:22.040
And so you know a breathtaking sign you know that I'm very

13:23.720 --> 13:28.560
I very much plugged this book at the beginning of the pandemic called immune

13:29.000 --> 13:32.960
which is by this YouTube channel kurgesat in a nutshell and

13:34.000 --> 13:37.200
I actually think this book is still pretty good

13:37.960 --> 13:42.800
But I think this channel was co-opted right before the pandemic and I really wasn't aware of it and

13:44.120 --> 13:47.360
Some of their older videos I used in a lot of my presentations

13:47.360 --> 13:51.280
But it turns out that now they're full-on gain a function in their full-on mythology

13:51.600 --> 13:55.600
And I've actually got a second video that I'm just going to remember for you to watch

13:56.480 --> 14:03.600
Where another youtuber actually breaks down their funding in the last three years that it's extraordinary. It's Bill Gates for almost six million dollars

14:04.840 --> 14:06.840
But a lot of other

14:07.240 --> 14:13.520
organizations that are all about population control and vaccines and so this is another example of

14:14.320 --> 14:20.240
How YouTube producers YouTube creators YouTube content has been has been co-opted

14:21.280 --> 14:27.040
In order to make sure that this went off flawlessly. How did they do it with these guys? They gave them a boatload of money

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
For them to make a video like this

14:30.040 --> 14:32.040
Tifik Revolution is taking place

14:33.160 --> 14:39.440
Biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed giving us the tools to eventually gain control over biology

14:39.760 --> 14:49.000
On the one hand solving the deadliest diseases while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs able to devastate humanity

14:49.400 --> 14:51.400
What's going on?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
biotech capability

14:54.280 --> 15:00.480
Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere the cotton in your clothes the vegetables you eat your dog

15:01.280 --> 15:05.640
Humans manipulate living things. We use bacteria to produce insulin

15:05.720 --> 15:10.640
Connect prosthetics directly with our brains and make industrial enzymes to produce paper

15:11.440 --> 15:18.520
Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable diseases while we're working on food crops resistant to climate change

15:19.240 --> 15:25.560
Our mastery over biology has been speeding up so much that within weeks of the first COVID-19 case

15:25.560 --> 15:29.480
The unknown coronavirus was broken down in laboratories and analyzed

15:30.320 --> 15:36.960
Scientists generated a copy of its genetic material to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began

15:37.720 --> 15:40.080
Something unthinkable a decade ago

15:41.040 --> 15:45.840
Where is all this sudden progress coming from? Well, it's complicated

15:45.840 --> 15:50.920
Ha but in a nutshell really expensive things got cheap and knowledge of how to

15:51.120 --> 15:57.280
Impressive things spread freely. So that's where it's it's there's the first bamboo zaman, right?

15:57.360 --> 16:00.640
We've talked about this before you can't equate

16:01.400 --> 16:08.360
The ability to make cheaper and cheaper DNA molecules with the understanding of what those DNA molecules do

16:08.960 --> 16:11.240
So yeah, it's become cheap to make cell phones

16:11.400 --> 16:15.440
And maybe it's even become sequent cheap to sequence DNA

16:16.040 --> 16:21.000
Maybe it's become cheap to make a bunch of DNA using recombinant DNA in

16:22.000 --> 16:28.280
Plasmids and in bacteria, but that doesn't mean you understand what you're copying. It doesn't mean you understand how it works and

16:29.600 --> 16:36.600
We don't and that illusion is created every time somebody gives that talk Kevin McCarron and give that talk

16:36.600 --> 16:43.400
Every biologist that's given a TED talk about this crap is given this thing where it used to cost

16:43.880 --> 16:47.240
$10,000 to sequence a human now it only costs 150

16:48.280 --> 16:50.280
so what

16:50.280 --> 16:55.280
If you could print all the Chinese books in the world for free, but you can't read Chinese and what difference does it make?

16:56.920 --> 17:01.920
Well Chinese books used to be really expensive now, they're really cheap. Well, so what?

17:02.920 --> 17:06.240
That's what we're talking about here only. It's a lot harder than Chinese

17:07.200 --> 17:12.720
They tell you that it's only got four bases and so it's really easy to figure out, but that's an absolute ridiculous lie

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
And that's what they're being paid to tell you

17:18.640 --> 17:25.320
The Human Genome Project starting in 1990 was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety

17:26.000 --> 17:29.360
13 years and three billion dollars later. It was complete

17:29.880 --> 17:34.880
By then the cost of decoding a human genome here. It is about one hundred million dollars

17:35.440 --> 17:41.000
Today, it's 100,000 times cheaper costing only about a thousand dollars. There you go

17:41.000 --> 17:42.760
How is that possible?

17:42.760 --> 17:48.080
Converting DNA into computer data and then studying it used to be a super tedious process

17:48.200 --> 17:53.720
Taking expert humans around three years of manual work and that was Kevin McCarron

17:54.040 --> 18:00.000
Like he actually is the guy who did this. He designed the stuff. You can see him in the laboratories where they're doing it

18:00.000 --> 18:00.840
and

18:00.840 --> 18:04.600
then he sold patents and he started companies and he sold patents and

18:05.440 --> 18:13.080
That's why he has a seven thousand dollar seven thousand square foot house in the suburbs of Boston on the frickin harbor

18:13.800 --> 18:21.120
And so ask yourself why a guy who's made hundreds of millions of dollars probably in his life with his brother and his dad

18:21.120 --> 18:24.200
With all the companies they've started all the patents they've sold

18:25.600 --> 18:29.480
How does a person like that spend all of his time on Twitter?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.480
Coming after a guy with less than 3,000 followers on Twitch

18:34.080 --> 18:39.040
Where the vast majority of users are ladies without their shirt on playing video games?

18:40.040 --> 18:43.160
Why does Kevin McCarron and bother to even talk to me?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.560
Why does Kevin McCarron even bother to tweet about COVID?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.640
because of this

18:54.040 --> 19:00.600
Because of this illusion and the fact that he is still making his living off of this illusion

19:01.280 --> 19:06.000
This idea that cheaply reading DNA translates to understanding it

19:10.000 --> 19:14.440
Today it takes about two weeks and is almost completely automated

19:14.920 --> 19:19.400
Biotechnology has gone from something restricted to the best and well-funded laboratories

19:19.400 --> 19:25.280
Start by the world's top experts to something affordable enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on

19:25.760 --> 19:30.480
What's sped up the process even more is that information in the field is that was so stupid?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.480
That was a guy in a recliner watching TV

19:32.920 --> 19:38.700
Look at he's he's following the directions on a YouTube video on how to make a gain of function virus. It's hysterical

19:39.260 --> 19:40.620
Occasionally work on

19:40.620 --> 19:45.580
What sped up the process even more is that information in the field is shared widely and freely?

19:46.180 --> 19:51.820
Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about a year to be copied in laboratories around the world a few years for any

19:53.020 --> 19:55.580
Why is that hooking that they're doing it in a garage?

19:56.980 --> 20:01.900
That's exactly what Malone said was gonna happen that they're gonna make make shit in their garage

20:03.300 --> 20:05.300
Tell me this is not a joke to you

20:05.860 --> 20:08.500
They are really thinking that we're gonna fall for this

20:09.900 --> 20:14.660
And to work out and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with them in schools

20:15.540 --> 20:21.660
Imagine that your local computer repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11 with just the parts lying around and that

20:21.660 --> 20:27.300
Teenagers are asked to build a new iPhone 5 for homework. Not a crappy homemade version the real thing

20:27.660 --> 20:30.500
This is what's going on right now in biotechnology

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
Technology revolution

20:33.420 --> 20:35.520
Unbelievable and unprecedented rate

20:35.520 --> 20:42.020
Unbelievable faster than cheaper to do you could have made this video in the 1980s, and it would still be the same thing

20:42.900 --> 20:48.180
These are people dancing around with glow-in-the-dark earlomire flasks come on

20:48.780 --> 20:50.780
Are we really this bad?

20:51.140 --> 20:59.100
Has our education really fallen so far that people are gonna fall for a person with an electric guitar in their hand and a glowing

20:59.100 --> 21:01.100
earlomire flask

21:01.820 --> 21:03.820
Holy ships

21:04.020 --> 21:08.060
This speed means we can expect even more wonderful things for humanity

21:08.460 --> 21:14.060
life-saving treatments miracle crops and solutions to problems that we can't even imagine right now

21:14.740 --> 21:17.660
But unfortunately progress cuts both ways

21:17.980 --> 21:23.860
What can be used for good can also be used for bad by accident or on purpose here we go

21:24.100 --> 21:27.100
What if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard? Oh?

21:27.540 --> 21:30.820
For all the good biotechnal do for us in the near future

21:30.820 --> 21:35.620
It also could easily kill many millions of people in the worst case hundreds of millions

21:35.620 --> 21:40.540
Holy shit in the worst case scenario Kevin McCarran said it would be a billion people dead

21:41.980 --> 21:47.540
Then any nuclear bomb the world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus spread

21:47.860 --> 21:50.180
We still don't know for sure if it came from nature

21:50.180 --> 21:55.860
Or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses that's still subject to scientific

21:55.860 --> 21:57.860
All there it is in the end

21:57.860 --> 22:04.420
Covid raccoon million people died and this was still a relatively mild virus that seven million people died

22:04.420 --> 22:10.200
No accounting of any of the protocols the shutdowns the ventilating the nothing seven million people died

22:11.180 --> 22:18.020
Thank you very much for paying us millions of dollars to tell us you tell your story in our pretty colors

22:18.540 --> 22:20.540
This company completely sold out

22:21.540 --> 22:24.460
Of course serious disease in most of those infected

22:24.820 --> 22:31.580
But that might change in the future. Oh, it might wherever the last pandemic came from the next one might very well be our own fault

22:31.580 --> 22:37.620
Oh, it might very well be so if you're still on the fence and you think this one's natural the next one might not be

22:38.060 --> 22:40.060
So that's how the Scooby-Doo works

22:40.740 --> 22:44.500
Even if you don't accept that this one was a lab leak

22:45.100 --> 22:49.680
Because of what happened in the last three years you can't deny that they were lying and

22:50.180 --> 22:53.940
Covering shit up and so maybe the next one will be much worse

22:56.820 --> 23:00.700
In a sense many things going on in biotechnology could lead to this

23:01.140 --> 23:04.500
Most of all how easy it is to work with dangerous viruses

23:05.260 --> 23:11.300
Thousands of scientists can simply order the genetic data of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them

23:11.700 --> 23:18.300
Assembling these into an artificial virus in 2023 costs about as much as a new car including all the lab equipment

23:18.300 --> 23:20.300
Why don't they say a clone?

23:20.300 --> 23:23.420
An artificial virus is an infectious clone

23:23.420 --> 23:26.580
why don't they say that making an infectious clone is easy and

23:27.540 --> 23:31.660
Making a crap ton of it is only a matter of scaling things up a bit

23:32.780 --> 23:37.500
At the same time other scientists are trying to find viruses that hide in nature

23:37.500 --> 23:45.420
Oh, so that's why because they have to tell you that the pandemic potential in nature is being accessed in the laboratory

23:45.420 --> 23:46.740
Do you see?

23:46.740 --> 23:55.820
That's the mythology that there's pandemic potential out there that can be accessed in here and we can recombine it in here and

23:56.060 --> 24:02.900
Create pandemic potential that wasn't found out there. That is the narrative like in wild bats or monkeys

24:03.060 --> 24:06.340
There are probably plenty of potentially deadly pandemics out there

24:07.100 --> 24:14.300
Virus hunters take samples back to the lab to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans and catalog the danger

24:14.660 --> 24:19.540
When a biologist discovers a new virus that usually publish its genetic data to the public

24:20.020 --> 24:27.980
Journals are eager to share descriptions of potentially dangerous viruses other labs go further and make viruses more dangerous

24:28.500 --> 24:35.460
They combine and mutate different viruses to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans or make them

24:35.460 --> 24:40.140
Deadlier than their original forms and again these results are shared freely

24:41.060 --> 24:46.780
Synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild these viruses are sold online to anyone without any or very little

24:46.780 --> 24:48.780
That's exactly what Robert Malone said

24:50.020 --> 24:52.940
Isn't it the people can buy this shit on eBay now

24:53.780 --> 25:01.740
For tracking as the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper and easy to use and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying

25:01.740 --> 25:09.180
It's only a matter of time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomber viruses a superbug that will cause

25:09.180 --> 25:14.280
Millions of deaths and someone uses it maybe because they have bad intentions

25:14.300 --> 25:21.700
Maybe because they're irresponsible or sloppy we're creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized

25:21.700 --> 25:28.180
Or maybe they'll want to cure their dad's Alzheimer's disease and they'll make a virus that infects monkeys and makes them super smart

25:28.180 --> 25:33.740
And then that virus will zoonautically jump back from the monkeys into the humans and wipe the whole planet out

25:33.740 --> 25:39.060
And we'll be left with a small group of humans that has to fight for the planet of the apes

25:40.060 --> 25:45.060
Because that's the actual plot of the new planet of the apes from 2008 9 and 11

25:46.060 --> 25:48.060
Maybe

25:48.420 --> 25:50.420
Iris in their backyard

25:50.420 --> 25:58.220
This is scary. The world would be plunged into an unending crisis as new pandemics pop up year after year or all at once

25:58.420 --> 26:03.780
Killing large parts of the world's population doing unimaginable damage to civilization as a whole. Wow

26:04.180 --> 26:10.740
Possibly undoing centuries of progress. Here we go. What can we do turns out a lot? Oh, yeah

26:10.820 --> 26:16.420
It's not the first time we've faced a challenge like this and we are not helpless think of nuclear technology

26:16.980 --> 26:21.300
Something extremely powerful and dangerous with huge upsides and downsides

26:21.860 --> 26:27.860
Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs. So its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused

26:28.500 --> 26:34.660
From the very beginning it was clear that knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost care

26:35.300 --> 26:39.700
So a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight

26:39.940 --> 26:43.540
Or the countries don't try to hide weapons development behind energy programs

26:44.180 --> 26:51.060
The result hasn't been perfect, but considering the 411 nuclear power stations running today. We've been very successful

26:51.620 --> 26:57.620
Likewise, no researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment. Did they forget about what happened in Japan?

26:58.740 --> 27:04.180
I'm sorry, but isn't nuclear power kind of like an all-or-nothing thing like if you have a meltdown like

27:04.980 --> 27:06.980
I'm just trying to understand is was

27:08.260 --> 27:13.780
Were these meltdowns bad or not? I think they are I think what happened in Fukushima is kind of bad

27:13.780 --> 27:17.780
I don't know maybe I'm wrong but into bomb-making machines on the internet

27:18.500 --> 27:23.300
There's no reason we couldn't handle the rainy dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way

27:24.260 --> 27:26.740
Experts have come up with three sort of bullet points

27:27.780 --> 27:33.220
First we need to delay the next deadly pandemic by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses

27:33.780 --> 27:36.660
Vergenetic data should be treated as an info hazard

27:37.300 --> 27:41.380
Information that poses a danger to society if it's shared without care now

27:41.380 --> 27:47.700
Keep in mind that we are posting the entire genome of all the variants that are currently in circulation. So that all that data is available

27:50.580 --> 27:53.860
Nepovirus all that stuff's online. So what is he talking about here?

27:56.100 --> 27:59.780
In other words, not just anyone should be able to order dangerous DNA online

28:00.020 --> 28:05.860
And if you do you should be tracked so it becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff

28:06.820 --> 28:11.620
The next step is detecting the danger by becoming aware of which viruses are present to runners

28:15.060 --> 28:17.540
This could be as easy as having labs in populations

28:17.540 --> 28:23.140
Don't forget that the who said this that we have to have sewer and genomic surveillance all the time

28:23.780 --> 28:25.780
That's what they want

28:26.020 --> 28:27.620
It's part of this thing

28:27.700 --> 28:29.700
Because then they can say the sewer levels

28:30.100 --> 28:33.860
Of x virus are going up. So we have to change the way that we behave

28:34.580 --> 28:36.580
When the sewer levels go down

28:36.820 --> 28:41.940
Then we'll change back. That's what their plan is. Don't get it. Don't don't misunderstand. That's that's coming

28:42.180 --> 28:46.420
Ntas maintain virus detectors that monitor what's going on in the micro world

28:47.220 --> 28:50.900
If we suddenly see certain microorganisms show up a lot in a short time

28:51.300 --> 28:56.660
We can react quickly and start countermeasures. There it is. There it is the final step destroy

28:57.620 --> 29:03.220
We basically need to build a machine that's ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over

29:03.380 --> 29:09.220
A machine to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over. What do you think that is MRNA?

29:10.500 --> 29:13.300
We can do this with new tools that are being developed right now

29:13.620 --> 29:18.340
Like nano filters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe or specialized new v-lamps

29:18.500 --> 29:22.420
That just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person to person

29:22.740 --> 29:27.220
And of course we need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before in history

29:27.860 --> 29:33.300
If we do these three things the chances are really good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future

29:34.260 --> 29:40.260
Biotechnology like any exciting and powerful technology is neither inherently good or bad

29:41.140 --> 29:44.020
It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways

29:44.740 --> 29:48.740
We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology

29:49.620 --> 29:54.660
Biology the biology of the plants and animals around us and the biology of the micro world

29:54.820 --> 29:59.860
And that is the arrogance that will get all of us in trouble. That's the arrogance that brought us here

29:59.940 --> 30:02.420
It's the arrogance that's bringing us transhumanism

30:03.060 --> 30:06.340
It is the arrogance that is losing the sacred

30:07.620 --> 30:12.260
It's all part of the same big big big giant show

30:13.780 --> 30:20.420
Don't give up the sacred don't let go of the complexity of biology. Don't let go of what's unexplainable

30:20.740 --> 30:24.340
Don't let them take it away from you and your kids

30:25.460 --> 30:27.460
They can lie about all they want

30:27.700 --> 30:33.460
It doesn't change the fact that they don't know they won't know they can't know and they know that they won't know

30:34.260 --> 30:36.260
But they want the power anyway

30:36.980 --> 30:41.620
They want to replace the sacred with worship of themselves

30:43.780 --> 30:49.140
So let's use it to create a future where we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good

30:50.740 --> 30:53.060
This video was supported by open philanthropy

30:53.460 --> 30:59.140
If you want to help and want to have a high impact on the world check out the buyer risk career guide from 80 000 hours

30:59.540 --> 31:05.620
A non-profit organization that helps people find careers that can tackle some of humanities greatest problems in the most efficient way

31:05.940 --> 31:08.660
We're going to pause that there. We're going to escape out of here

31:08.740 --> 31:12.580
I need to go to the airport ladies and gentlemen because I have a friend in town

31:13.220 --> 31:16.580
And so I just want to end with the idea

31:17.860 --> 31:20.020
What the hell is this as the wrong slide, right?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.420
Escape that

31:22.980 --> 31:25.700
I just want to end with the idea that they probably

31:26.900 --> 31:29.300
Lied to us about this graph here

31:29.460 --> 31:34.740
They lied to us about the light blue by not telling us about it and they lied about the dark blue by not telling us why it went up

31:34.740 --> 31:36.740
By threefold during the pandemic

31:38.020 --> 31:41.380
They lied about a virus they paid a lot of money to go along with the lie

31:42.660 --> 31:45.540
And there was likely a molecular seeding of this lie

31:46.500 --> 31:51.380
A seeding of a clone in many places in the world so that the molecular biology would line up

31:52.020 --> 31:55.860
And that they could scare people into following their dumb protocols for money

31:56.580 --> 32:01.140
And those dumb protocols involved not treating people the way you'd have normally treated them

32:02.420 --> 32:05.700
And being afraid of people when you normally would not have been afraid of them

32:06.740 --> 32:11.380
Not recessed dating people when you did not need to to leave them

32:11.860 --> 32:13.380
And

32:13.380 --> 32:16.020
They did that with the intense express

32:16.660 --> 32:24.820
Intent of using that event and this event as a way of justifying an inversion of everything that we know is freedom

32:26.420 --> 32:30.580
And the reason why they're doing it is because they've told each other in secret meetings for years

32:31.140 --> 32:33.140
That this is necessary for population

32:34.100 --> 32:36.100
And to feed the AI

32:36.180 --> 32:41.860
Because the way that we're going to become masters of our biology like Kyrgyzstan that stupid video just told us

32:42.740 --> 32:47.300
Was by collecting all the medical data and all the genetic data and all the data from everybody

32:47.860 --> 32:49.540
It's alive

32:49.540 --> 32:53.940
And the more data we have the more likely it is the AI will be able to do all those things

32:54.820 --> 33:00.260
Control the biology of all the plants and the animals and the fish and the microbes

33:01.700 --> 33:03.700
And it's all a great big mythology

33:04.660 --> 33:07.940
It's a great big mythology to make you sink down into your chair
