WEBVTT

01:22.120 --> 01:25.560
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic

01:45.000 --> 01:48.960
It's gonna be a real quick hit tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I have a special guest coming in town

01:49.600 --> 01:53.720
But I didn't expect so I need to run out to the airport and

01:54.480 --> 01:56.480
greet an old friends

01:57.440 --> 02:01.240
I'm really excited about tonight, but I also didn't want to break the streak

02:03.240 --> 02:07.520
I didn't want to break the streak. I don't plan to break the streak anytime soon. I

02:08.240 --> 02:12.920
Think we're on evening number 19. Maybe evening number 20 in a row

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I've been wanting to do this

02:17.280 --> 02:21.600
Time if you've got to meet Bobby today, you know, what's up?

02:22.400 --> 02:25.260
If you got to meet Bobby today, then you know what's up

02:26.520 --> 02:29.440
There's some really big things happening. I don't know what it means

02:30.360 --> 02:32.360
Gosh, I hope he's a good guy

02:46.480 --> 02:50.000
We love you mark just get to it when you can my friend

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
Schedule for 60 minutes next

03:10.040 --> 03:13.200
He's going on French British Italian

03:13.840 --> 03:18.400
Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
embarrassing

03:23.200 --> 03:25.200
Oh

03:25.200 --> 03:27.860
Yeah, I forgot. I'll change this one. Sorry about that

03:31.840 --> 03:38.040
Mystery captain Cutler and his wife taken into custody by sure that was some plan they had

03:38.280 --> 03:41.320
first spreading the phony story about cover and

03:41.720 --> 03:45.480
Then stealing the yachts from the marina that night on the beach

03:45.760 --> 03:51.360
Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks in the graveyard of shit. Yeah, but like his diving suit

03:51.360 --> 03:53.960
Got covered with that coopy glowing seaweed

03:56.520 --> 04:00.080
And that's where the glowing ghost story came from well

04:08.720 --> 04:13.880
How did Scooby do with that I guess that's another mystery

04:21.600 --> 04:24.720
All right, here we go ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
Oh

04:48.000 --> 04:51.720
Good afternoon good evening good morning and good night wherever you are in this planet

04:51.720 --> 04:56.560
This is giggle and biological high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

04:56.560 --> 04:58.560
It's the 24th of September

04:59.880 --> 05:02.480
2023 and we are still fighting

05:02.920 --> 05:08.760
this limited but lively spectrum of debate about gain a function virus and

05:09.320 --> 05:12.000
About how the protocols just simply don't matter

05:16.160 --> 05:20.240
Thank you Jessica Hockett, thank you Dennis Rancor

05:21.120 --> 05:26.120
Thank you mark you satanic. Thank you Nick Hudson. Thank you

05:26.800 --> 05:28.800
To Thomas Binder

05:28.800 --> 05:30.800
Thank you to Peter McCullough

05:31.640 --> 05:36.760
Thank you to Robert F Kennedy Jr. Thank you to everybody who's speaking out against

05:37.400 --> 05:42.240
The scam that is the childhood vaccination schedule in the United States of America

05:42.240 --> 05:48.160
You're dang right, I'm saying it. I'm saying it out loud

05:48.160 --> 05:51.720
I'm not gonna be ashamed of it anymore. This is the way we need to talk

05:52.920 --> 05:55.080
Because they're gonna talk like we're crazy

05:55.640 --> 05:59.920
So we might as well push it all the way over the finish line and all the way into the end zone

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
Because they're gonna say we're cheating anyway

06:04.560 --> 06:06.960
And so we need to dunk the ball we need to

06:07.840 --> 06:11.960
Spike the ball and the touchdown. We need to do whatever they do and rugby to celebrate

06:12.480 --> 06:15.560
We need to take a slide on the grass like they do in football

06:17.520 --> 06:19.320
Because it's time

06:19.320 --> 06:22.120
No more bait on TV. No more bait on social media

06:22.760 --> 06:25.200
Transfection is not immunization and we know it

06:26.320 --> 06:28.560
More importantly, we knew that they knew it

06:29.720 --> 06:33.640
More importantly, we know that they knew it before before it was ever

06:34.040 --> 06:39.800
Transfection when it was just intramuscular injection of chemicals into your muscle

06:40.840 --> 06:42.200
Yeah

06:42.200 --> 06:46.720
Injection into your muscle with the idea of augmenting your immune system. No more

06:48.040 --> 06:52.240
We're gonna finally be honest about this that we've been protecting these companies and

06:53.360 --> 06:55.960
funneling massive profits into their coffers

06:56.920 --> 06:58.440
while they

06:58.440 --> 06:59.960
then

07:00.000 --> 07:08.160
Sort of worked the other way with the CDC and the FDA. This is done and we are going to wake up. I'm convinced

07:09.640 --> 07:14.680
We're gonna wake up because these people definitely have changed our minds about how we think about stuff and

07:16.160 --> 07:21.160
We are waking up to the fact that these people have done this. We are waking up to their inconsistencies

07:22.200 --> 07:28.520
We are waking up to how they changed our mind about this biology. We are waking up about what they did in the hospitals

07:29.960 --> 07:33.640
and what these lies and these exaggerations led to and

07:34.600 --> 07:38.760
how they continue to lie and exaggerate and distract and

07:40.360 --> 07:46.120
Get everybody on social media and on the skilled TV watchers in the world think they're solving the mystery

07:49.160 --> 07:57.720
And of course they've lied to us about the pandemic potential found in coronavirus is ordered invert our human rights into human privileges or human permissions

07:58.440 --> 08:01.200
And they've done this through a carefully crafted narrative

08:02.200 --> 08:06.160
People all over the internet involved in one way or another

08:06.920 --> 08:08.920
with the idea that there's a

08:08.920 --> 08:10.920
crazy new novel virus

08:11.480 --> 08:13.480
everybody was vulnerable to and

08:14.680 --> 08:21.640
Therefore we had to shut down the mRNA probably is saving lots of people at least they're really old or sick or core morbid and

08:22.440 --> 08:29.720
And now it's pretty much the conclusion of these people over here that it's a gain-of-function virus and that's why it was so bad

08:31.560 --> 08:35.880
And anybody that's questioning the protocols the spread or the variants is ignored

08:39.160 --> 08:46.160
And so we've been making maps of these people trying to shift these people around Peter McCollum made a huge move a couple days ago

08:47.680 --> 08:51.120
Robert Malone we've watched a few videos with him and

08:51.640 --> 08:54.120
a person who was arrested at the January 6th

08:55.480 --> 08:57.480
Uprising or whatever the hell it's called

08:58.280 --> 09:01.120
We streamed with multiple times multiple times

09:02.040 --> 09:03.560
control

09:03.560 --> 09:10.800
There's no other way to see it because if he was streaming with Crichel and now George Webb is his bad guy

09:13.320 --> 09:16.680
Then this is all one big web of of fiction

09:17.640 --> 09:21.880
All one big story. Are they trying to get people to go away from antibodies?

09:22.360 --> 09:27.600
Are they trying to get big pharma to go away from antibodies and two of these more trustworthy patents?

09:28.680 --> 09:32.160
Or maybe these patents that Robert Malone had are all expired now

09:34.920 --> 09:38.080
Maybe new antibody patents are ever more difficult to get

09:39.720 --> 09:43.080
And so maybe this is the new way forward because there's no way to get

09:43.720 --> 09:49.720
That we have to understand this because that's what these people are involved with that's what this distraction is all about

09:51.840 --> 09:55.440
It's not money. It's only money and so far as money is power

09:56.440 --> 09:59.240
This is for all the marbles ladies and gentlemen

10:02.240 --> 10:07.200
So we've talked about Paul Cottrell and Robert Malone connected to one another we've talked about Peter McCollum

10:07.200 --> 10:12.360
famous case of the M&R and what he just said the reason I mentioned this is you've had the

10:13.000 --> 10:18.320
Your your your change in kind of you around vaccines in general has also

10:19.600 --> 10:25.960
coincided with your I don't know if it's a reacquaintance with or an acquaintance with the case of Wakefield

10:25.960 --> 10:31.360
So what so for the Brits here just to hear this wrong. Do you think he was perhaps right all along?

10:31.360 --> 10:35.000
I think he was right all along and I think he will be vindicated

10:35.360 --> 10:41.200
Absolutely, so do you agree with test and have you as your do you move to my view has changed now?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.240
I can tell you if I was a young parent today

10:45.240 --> 10:52.200
What I would do is I would forgo the vaccines. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I can't be I'm a pin cushion

10:52.200 --> 10:57.680
I took all these vaccines now what I am though is I'm now vaccine risk aware

10:58.280 --> 11:04.680
And let me tell you what Andy Wakefield was right and all Andy Wakefield was saying is that maybe it's too

11:04.720 --> 11:09.440
Intense, maybe we ought to just kind of spread him out. That's all he was really saying

11:11.800 --> 11:15.640
This is a gigantic moves right that changed the playing board a little bit

11:15.640 --> 11:20.240
We have to move things around and figure out what's going on here. That's what we're doing

11:20.800 --> 11:23.560
We're paying attention and letting people speak for themselves

11:25.560 --> 11:31.000
Lots of these people here have spoken for themselves throughout this whole three years Paul Catrell for sure

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
Kevin McCarron for sure

11:33.640 --> 11:39.920
Richard Fleming for sure Robert Malone for sure Steve Kerr's for sure all you have to do is look up what they said in

11:40.320 --> 11:45.120
2020 21 22 and you can see that they all deserve red squares

11:45.960 --> 11:51.360
They're not fighting for our freedom. They're not fighting for our sovereignty. They're not fighting to save

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
millions of people from making a mistake

11:55.520 --> 12:00.960
And so none of these people spoke out against the shot none of them are speaking out against the shot

12:01.000 --> 12:03.240
Otherwise, it's really simple. Don't do it

12:04.560 --> 12:11.520
Transfection is an immunization. They're real easy sentences. They don't require an hour-long podcast. You can just say it

12:12.800 --> 12:14.800
tweet it

12:15.600 --> 12:17.600
But they don't

12:18.440 --> 12:23.080
You can just say that well the childhood vaccination schedules out of our control because we let it be

12:23.600 --> 12:26.880
Since 1986 you could just say that but they don't

12:26.880 --> 12:28.880
And

12:28.880 --> 12:34.240
Because a lot of these people in this picture don't say it you shouldn't trust them because that's where we are

12:35.000 --> 12:40.960
That's the dividing line. It's not lab leak or natural virus. It's not long COVID or not if you believe in it

12:41.400 --> 12:46.840
It's not whether there's a virus or not what it is is about whether public health is bullshit or not

12:48.440 --> 12:52.720
Whether what these people are selling is real or snake oil. That's what this is about

12:53.280 --> 12:59.120
It's not about some people. It's about the whole plan and the execution of it

13:04.240 --> 13:12.080
I'll stop stop that's escape escape escape what in my world am I doing? I didn't change that fast enough and so I don't have that up

13:13.160 --> 13:15.160
And I needed to be this one

13:16.880 --> 13:22.040
And so you know a breathtaking sign you know that I'm very

13:23.720 --> 13:28.560
I very much plugged this book at the beginning of the pandemic called immune

13:29.000 --> 13:32.960
which is by this YouTube channel kurgesat in a nutshell and

13:34.000 --> 13:37.200
I actually think this book is still pretty good

13:37.960 --> 13:42.800
But I think this channel was co-opted right before the pandemic and I really wasn't aware of it and

13:44.120 --> 13:47.360
Some of their older videos I used in a lot of my presentations

13:47.360 --> 13:51.280
But it turns out that now they're full-on gain a function in their full-on mythology

13:51.600 --> 13:55.600
And I've actually got a second video that I'm just going to remember for you to watch

13:56.480 --> 14:03.600
Where another youtuber actually breaks down their funding in the last three years that it's extraordinary. It's Bill Gates for almost six million dollars

14:04.840 --> 14:06.840
But a lot of other

14:07.240 --> 14:13.520
organizations that are all about population control and vaccines and so this is another example of

14:14.320 --> 14:20.240
How YouTube producers YouTube creators YouTube content has been has been co-opted

14:21.280 --> 14:27.040
In order to make sure that this went off flawlessly. How did they do it with these guys? They gave them a boatload of money

14:27.920 --> 14:29.920
For them to make a video like this

14:30.040 --> 14:32.040
Tifik Revolution is taking place

14:33.160 --> 14:39.440
Biotechnology has been progressing at stunning speed giving us the tools to eventually gain control over biology

14:39.760 --> 14:49.000
On the one hand solving the deadliest diseases while also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs able to devastate humanity

14:49.400 --> 14:51.400
What's going on?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
biotech capability

14:54.280 --> 15:00.480
Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere the cotton in your clothes the vegetables you eat your dog

15:01.280 --> 15:05.640
Humans manipulate living things. We use bacteria to produce insulin

15:05.720 --> 15:10.640
Connect prosthetics directly with our brains and make industrial enzymes to produce paper

15:11.440 --> 15:18.520
Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable diseases while we're working on food crops resistant to climate change

15:19.240 --> 15:25.560
Our mastery over biology has been speeding up so much that within weeks of the first COVID-19 case

15:25.560 --> 15:29.480
The unknown coronavirus was broken down in laboratories and analyzed

15:30.320 --> 15:36.960
Scientists generated a copy of its genetic material to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began

15:37.720 --> 15:40.080
Something unthinkable a decade ago

15:41.040 --> 15:45.840
Where is all this sudden progress coming from? Well, it's complicated

15:45.840 --> 15:50.920
Ha but in a nutshell really expensive things got cheap and knowledge of how to

15:51.120 --> 15:57.280
Impressive things spread freely. So that's where it's it's there's the first bamboo zaman, right?

15:57.360 --> 16:00.640
We've talked about this before you can't equate

16:01.400 --> 16:08.360
The ability to make cheaper and cheaper DNA molecules with the understanding of what those DNA molecules do

16:08.960 --> 16:11.240
So yeah, it's become cheap to make cell phones

16:11.400 --> 16:15.440
And maybe it's even become sequent cheap to sequence DNA

16:16.040 --> 16:21.000
Maybe it's become cheap to make a bunch of DNA using recombinant DNA in

16:22.000 --> 16:28.280
Plasmids and in bacteria, but that doesn't mean you understand what you're copying. It doesn't mean you understand how it works and

16:29.600 --> 16:36.600
We don't and that illusion is created every time somebody gives that talk Kevin McCarron and give that talk

16:36.600 --> 16:43.400
Every biologist that's given a TED talk about this crap is given this thing where it used to cost

16:43.880 --> 16:47.240
$10,000 to sequence a human now it only costs 150

16:48.280 --> 16:50.280
so what

16:50.280 --> 16:55.280
If you could print all the Chinese books in the world for free, but you can't read Chinese and what difference does it make?

16:56.920 --> 17:01.920
Well Chinese books used to be really expensive now, they're really cheap. Well, so what?

17:02.920 --> 17:06.240
That's what we're talking about here only. It's a lot harder than Chinese

17:07.200 --> 17:12.720
They tell you that it's only got four bases and so it's really easy to figure out, but that's an absolute ridiculous lie

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
And that's what they're being paid to tell you

17:18.640 --> 17:25.320
The Human Genome Project starting in 1990 was the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety

17:25.960 --> 17:29.400
13 years and three billion dollars later it was complete

17:29.880 --> 17:34.880
By then the cost of decoding a human genome here. It is about 100 million dollars

17:35.440 --> 17:41.000
Today, it's 100,000 times cheaper costing only about a thousand dollars. There you go

17:41.000 --> 17:42.760
How is that possible?

17:42.760 --> 17:50.000
converting DNA into computer data and then studying it used to be a super tedious process taking expert humans around

17:50.000 --> 17:53.840
three years of manual work and that was Kevin McCarron

17:54.040 --> 17:59.960
Like he actually is the guy who did this. He designed the stuff. You can see him in the laboratories where they're doing it

18:00.520 --> 18:04.600
and then he sold patents and he started companies and he sold patents and

18:05.440 --> 18:13.080
That's why he has a seven thousand dollar at the seven thousand square foot house in the suburbs of Boston on the frickin harbor

18:13.760 --> 18:19.960
And so ask yourself why a guy who's made hundreds of millions of dollars probably in his life

18:20.000 --> 18:24.200
With his brother and his dad with all the companies. They've started all the patents. They've sold

18:25.600 --> 18:29.480
How does a person like that spend all of his time on Twitter?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.480
Coming after a guy with less than 3,000 followers on twitch

18:34.080 --> 18:39.040
Where the vast majority of users are ladies without their shirt on playing video games?

18:40.080 --> 18:43.160
Why does Kevin McCarron and bother to even talk to me?

18:46.080 --> 18:49.560
Why does Kevin McCarron even bother to tweet about COVID?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Because of this

18:54.000 --> 19:00.600
Because of this illusion and the fact that he is still making his living off of this illusion

19:01.240 --> 19:05.960
This idea that cheaply reading DNA translates to understanding it

19:09.960 --> 19:14.400
Today it takes about two weeks and is almost completely automated

19:14.920 --> 19:19.400
Biotechnology has gone from something restricted to the best and well-funded laboratories

19:19.400 --> 19:25.280
Start by the world's top experts to something affordable enough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on

19:25.760 --> 19:30.480
What's sped up the process even more is that information in the field is that was so stupid?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.480
That was a guy in a recliner watching TV

19:32.920 --> 19:38.720
Look at he's he's following the directions on a YouTube video on how to make a gain of function virus. It's hysterical

19:39.240 --> 19:45.400
Occasionally work on what sped up the process even more is that information in the field is shared widely and freely

19:46.160 --> 19:51.800
Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about a year to be copied in laboratories around the world a few years for any

19:52.960 --> 19:55.600
Why is that looking at they're doing it in a garage?

19:56.960 --> 20:01.880
That's exactly what Malone said was gonna happen that they're gonna make make shit in their garage

20:03.280 --> 20:05.280
Tell me this is not a joke to you

20:05.840 --> 20:08.520
They are really thinking that we're gonna fall for this

20:09.960 --> 20:14.640
To work out and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with them in schools

20:15.520 --> 20:21.640
Imagine that your local computer repair shop could build a pristine iPhone 11 with just the parts lying around and that

20:21.640 --> 20:27.320
Teenagers are asked to build a new iPhone 5 for homework. Not a crappy homemade version the real thing

20:27.680 --> 20:30.480
This is what's going on right now in biotechnology

20:30.480 --> 20:32.480
Technology revolution

20:33.400 --> 20:35.520
Unbelievable and unprecedented rate

20:35.520 --> 20:42.000
Unbelievable faster than cheaper to do you could have made this video in the 1980s, and it would still be the same thing

20:42.880 --> 20:48.160
These are people dancing around with glow-in-the-dark earlomire flasks come on

20:48.760 --> 20:50.760
Are we really this bad?

20:51.120 --> 20:59.080
Has our education really fallen so far that people are gonna fall for a person with an electric guitar in their hand and a glowing

20:59.080 --> 21:01.080
earlomire flask

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
Holy ships

21:04.000 --> 21:08.040
This speed means we can expect even more wonderful things for humanity

21:08.440 --> 21:14.040
life-saving treatments miracle crops and solutions to problems we can't even imagine right now

21:14.720 --> 21:17.640
But unfortunately progress cuts both ways

21:17.960 --> 21:23.600
What can be used for good can also be used for bad by accident or on purpose here?

21:23.600 --> 21:27.080
We go what if you could build a nuclear bomb in your backyard? Oh

21:27.560 --> 21:30.800
For all the good biotech will do for us in the near future

21:30.800 --> 21:35.640
It also could easily kill many millions of people in the worst case hundreds of millions

21:35.640 --> 21:40.520
Holy shit in the worst case scenario Kevin McCarran said it would be a billion people dead

21:41.960 --> 21:47.520
Then any nuclear bomb the world just witnessed how fast the novel coronavirus spread

21:47.840 --> 21:50.160
We still don't know for sure if it came from nature

21:50.160 --> 21:55.840
Or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with coronaviruses that's still subject to scientific

21:55.840 --> 21:57.840
All there it is in the end

21:57.840 --> 22:04.440
Covid raccoon million people died and this was still a relatively mild virus that seven million people died

22:04.440 --> 22:10.200
No accounting of any of the protocols the shutdowns the ventilating the nothing seven million people died

22:11.200 --> 22:18.000
Thank you very much for paying us millions of dollars to tell us you tell your story in our pretty colors

22:18.560 --> 22:20.560
This company completely sold out

22:21.560 --> 22:26.600
Of course serious disease in most of those infected but that might change in the future

22:26.600 --> 22:31.560
Oh, it might wherever the last pandemic came from the next one might very well be our own fault

22:31.560 --> 22:37.600
Oh, it might very well be so if you're still on the fence and you think this one's natural the next one might not be

22:38.040 --> 22:40.040
So that's how the Scooby-Doo works

22:40.760 --> 22:44.520
Even if you don't accept that this one was a lab leak

22:45.120 --> 22:49.680
Because of what happened in the last three years you can't deny that they were lying and

22:50.160 --> 22:53.920
Covering shit up and so maybe the next one will be much worse

22:56.840 --> 23:00.720
In a sense many things going on in biotechnology could lead to this

23:01.160 --> 23:04.480
Most of all how easy it is to work with dangerous viruses

23:05.240 --> 23:11.280
Thousands of scientists can simply order the genetic data of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them

23:11.720 --> 23:18.320
Assembly needs into an artificial virus in 2023 costs about as much as a new car including all the lab equipment

23:18.320 --> 23:20.320
Why don't they say a clone?

23:20.320 --> 23:23.400
An artificial virus is an infectious clone

23:23.400 --> 23:26.560
Why don't they say that making an infectious clone is easy and

23:27.520 --> 23:31.680
Making a crap ton of it is only a matter of scaling things up a bit

23:32.800 --> 23:37.560
At the same time other scientists are trying to find viruses that hide in nature

23:37.560 --> 23:45.440
Oh, so that's why because they have to tell you that the pandemic potential in nature is being accessed in the laboratory

23:45.440 --> 23:46.760
Do you see?

23:46.760 --> 23:55.840
That's the mythology that there's pandemic potential out there that can be accessed in here and we can recombine it in here and

23:56.040 --> 24:02.880
Create pandemic potential that wasn't found out there. That is the narrative like in wild bats or monkeys

24:03.040 --> 24:06.320
There are probably plenty of potentially deadly pandemics out there

24:07.080 --> 24:14.280
Virus hunters take samples back to the lab to learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans and catalog the danger

24:14.640 --> 24:19.480
When a biologist discovers a new virus they usually publish its genetic data to the public

24:20.000 --> 24:27.960
Generals are eager to share descriptions of potentially dangerous viruses other labs go further and make viruses more dangerous

24:28.480 --> 24:35.480
They combine and mutate different viruses to understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans or make them

24:35.480 --> 24:40.120
Deadlier than their original forms and again. These results are shared freely

24:41.120 --> 24:46.720
Synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild these viruses are sold online to anyone without any or very little

24:46.720 --> 24:48.720
That's exactly what Robert Malone said

24:50.000 --> 24:52.960
Isn't it the people can buy this shit on eBay now

24:53.760 --> 24:55.320
for tracking as

24:55.320 --> 25:01.720
The tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper and easy to use and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying

25:01.800 --> 25:09.200
It's only a matter of time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb of viruses a superbug that will cause

25:09.200 --> 25:14.280
Millions of deaths and someone uses it maybe because they have bad intentions

25:14.280 --> 25:16.640
Maybe because they're irresponsible or sloppy

25:16.840 --> 25:23.560
We're creating an environment in which it's increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized or maybe they'll want to cure their dad's

25:23.560 --> 25:28.160
Alzheimer's disease and they'll make a virus that infects monkeys and makes them super smart

25:28.160 --> 25:33.760
And then that virus will zoonautically jump back from the monkeys into the humans and wipe the whole planet out

25:33.760 --> 25:39.080
And we'll be left with a small group of humans that has to fight for the planet of the apes

25:40.080 --> 25:45.080
Because that's the actual plot of the new planet of the apes from 2008 9 and 11

25:47.480 --> 25:48.440
Maybe

25:48.440 --> 25:50.280
Iris in their backyard

25:50.280 --> 25:51.840
This is scary

25:51.920 --> 25:58.200
The world would be plunged into an unending crisis as new pandemics pop up year after year or all at once

25:58.400 --> 26:00.560
Killing large parts of the world's population

26:00.560 --> 26:01.080
Wow

26:01.080 --> 26:07.120
unimaginable damage to civilization as a whole wow possibly undoing centuries of progress here we go

26:07.280 --> 26:13.120
What can we do turns out a lot? Oh, yeah, it's not the first time we've faced a challenge like this

26:13.120 --> 26:16.440
And we are not helpless think of nuclear technology

26:16.960 --> 26:21.280
Something extremely powerful and dangerous with huge upsides and downsides

26:21.840 --> 26:24.160
Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs

26:24.160 --> 26:27.840
So its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused

26:28.280 --> 26:34.600
From the very beginning it was clear that knowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost care

26:35.000 --> 26:43.480
So a lot of effort has gone into making sure no radioactive material disappears from sight or that countries don't try to hide weapons development behind energy programs

26:43.880 --> 26:50.840
The result hasn't been perfect, but considering the 411 nuclear power stations running today. We've been very successful

26:51.440 --> 26:57.560
Likewise no researcher would think to share data on how to turn common laboratory equipment. Did they forget about what happened in Japan?

26:58.360 --> 27:04.120
I'm sorry, but isn't nuclear power kind of like an all-or-nothing thing like if you have a meltdown like

27:04.680 --> 27:06.920
I'm just trying to understand is was

27:08.000 --> 27:13.720
Were these meltdowns bad or not? I think they are I think what happened in Fukushima is kind of bad

27:13.720 --> 27:17.800
I don't know maybe I'm wrong, but into bomb-making machines on the internet

27:18.280 --> 27:23.200
There's no reason we couldn't handle the rainy dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way

27:24.200 --> 27:26.680
Experts have come up with three sort of bullet points

27:27.560 --> 27:33.240
First we need to delay the next deadly pandemic by getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses

27:33.560 --> 27:36.720
Their genetic data should be treated as an info hazard

27:37.320 --> 27:45.120
Information that poses a danger to society if it's shared without care now keep in mind that we are posting the entire genome of all the variants that are

27:45.120 --> 27:47.680
Currently in circulation so that all that data is available

27:50.400 --> 27:53.880
Nepo virus all that stuff's online, so what is he talking about here?

27:55.800 --> 27:59.760
In other words, not just anyone should be able to order dangerous DNA online

27:59.760 --> 28:05.920
And if you do you should be tracked so it becomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff

28:06.600 --> 28:10.040
The next step is detecting the danger by becoming aware

28:15.120 --> 28:17.560
This could be as easy as having labs in populations

28:17.560 --> 28:23.120
Don't forget that the who said this that we have to have sewer and genomic surveillance all the time

28:23.600 --> 28:25.600
That's what they want

28:25.680 --> 28:29.720
It's part of this thing because then they can say the sewer levels of

28:30.280 --> 28:33.760
X virus are going up, so we have to change the way that we behave

28:34.280 --> 28:36.280
When the sewer levels go down

28:36.560 --> 28:41.980
Then we'll change back. That's what their plan is don't get it. Don't don't misunderstand. That's that's coming

28:41.980 --> 28:46.660
enters maintain virus detectors that monitor what's going on in the micro world if

28:47.100 --> 28:50.860
We suddenly see certain microorganisms show up a lot in a short time

28:50.860 --> 28:56.580
We can react quickly and start countermeasures. There it is. There it is the final step destroy

28:57.300 --> 28:59.300
We basically need to build a machine

28:59.300 --> 29:06.500
That's ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over a machine to destroy any pandemic threat before

29:06.500 --> 29:09.220
It has a chance to take over what do you think that is mRNA?

29:10.180 --> 29:15.980
We can do this with new tools that are being developed right now like nanofilters that pull dangers out of the air

29:15.980 --> 29:22.460
We breathe or specialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person to person

29:22.460 --> 29:27.220
And of course we need to get better at getting new vaccines faster than ever before in history

29:27.500 --> 29:33.220
If we do these three things the chances are really good that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future

29:34.220 --> 29:40.220
Biotechnology like any exciting and powerful technology is neither inherently good or bad

29:40.820 --> 29:43.940
It has the potential to be both in breathtaking ways

29:44.460 --> 29:48.780
We have the chance to have a future where we get to truly control biology

29:49.500 --> 29:58.100
biology of the plants and animals around us and the biology of the micro world and that is the arrogance that will get all of us in trouble

29:58.100 --> 30:02.100
That's the arrogance that brought us here. It's the arrogance. It's bringing us transhumanism

30:02.700 --> 30:06.340
It is the arrogance that is losing the sacred

30:07.300 --> 30:12.220
It's all part of the same big big big giant show

30:13.540 --> 30:20.180
Don't give up the sacred. Don't let go of the complexity of biology. Don't let go of what's unexplainable

30:22.060 --> 30:24.300
Don't let them take it away from you and your kids

30:25.220 --> 30:27.220
They can lie about all they want

30:27.380 --> 30:33.380
It doesn't change the fact that they don't know they won't know they can't know and they know that they won't know

30:33.940 --> 30:35.940
But they want the power anyway

30:36.700 --> 30:41.420
They want to replace the sacred with worship of themselves

30:43.500 --> 30:49.060
So let's use it to create a future where we triumph over pandemics and diseases for good

30:50.460 --> 30:55.700
This video was supported by open philanthropy if you want to help and want to have a high impact on the world

30:55.700 --> 31:05.580
Check out the buyer risk career guide from 80,000 hours a non-profit organization that helps people find careers that can tackle some of humanity's greatest problems in the most efficient way

31:05.660 --> 31:08.700
We're gonna pause that there. We're gonna escape out of here

31:08.700 --> 31:16.500
I need to go to the airport ladies and gentlemen because I have a friend in town and so I just want to end with the idea

31:17.660 --> 31:21.540
What the hell is this as the wrong slide right escape that I

31:22.540 --> 31:25.540
I just want to end with the idea that they probably

31:26.620 --> 31:29.260
Lieed to us about this graph here

31:29.260 --> 31:32.140
They lied to us about the light blue by not telling us about it

31:32.140 --> 31:36.460
And they lied about the dark blue by not telling us why it went up by threefold during the pandemic

31:37.740 --> 31:45.500
They lied about a virus they paid a lot of money to go along with the lie and there was likely a molecular seeding of this lie

31:46.340 --> 31:51.620
a seeding of a clone in many places in the world so that the molecular biology would line up and

31:51.980 --> 31:57.900
That they could scare people into following their dumb protocols for money and those dumb protocols

31:57.900 --> 32:01.380
Involved not treating people the way you'd have normally treated them and

32:02.460 --> 32:05.660
Being afraid of people when you would normally would not have been afraid of them

32:06.460 --> 32:11.620
not recessed dating people when you did not need to to leave them and

32:12.620 --> 32:16.060
And they did that with the intense express

32:16.700 --> 32:24.860
Intent of using that event and this event as a way of justifying an inversion of everything that we know is freedom

32:25.620 --> 32:32.580
And the reason why they're doing it is because they've told each other in secret meetings for years that this is necessary for

32:32.780 --> 32:35.260
population and to feed the AI

32:36.020 --> 32:41.860
Because the way that we're going to become masters of our biology like Kyrgyzstan that stupid video just told us

32:42.500 --> 32:48.460
Was by collecting all the medical data and all the genetic data and all the data from everybody it's alive

32:49.180 --> 32:53.860
And the more data we have the more likely it is the AI will be able to do all those things

32:54.740 --> 33:00.460
control the biology of all the plants and the animals and the fish and the microbes and

33:01.540 --> 33:03.540
It's all a great big mythology

33:04.420 --> 33:11.420
It's a great big mythology to make you sink down into your chair and flip the channel of the television back to the next

33:12.060 --> 33:14.060
binge target

33:14.460 --> 33:21.980
It's time to wake up ladies and gentlemen. It's no longer time to to sleep or to wait or to act tomorrow

33:22.620 --> 33:24.620
Now's the time to share this information

33:25.220 --> 33:30.020
Now's the time to speak up with your relatives and friends. We have a few more months

33:30.460 --> 33:32.460
One more month until Thanksgiving

33:33.020 --> 33:35.820
So the Thanksgiving table is coming really soon

33:36.340 --> 33:38.340
Learn this biology ladies and gentlemen

33:38.900 --> 33:40.900
Learn it so you can spread it

33:40.900 --> 33:46.220
This biology is starting to become easier to learn because it's simpler if it's all lies

33:47.460 --> 33:49.460
You go on biological

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
Dot com or giga home dot bio

33:52.340 --> 33:57.580
I will see you tomorrow. I'm sorry the show is so short tonight. I'm hopeful

33:57.580 --> 34:04.780
Yeah, I'm gonna have lots of time tomorrow. Maybe I'll even have my friend who's here join me for the show

34:05.300 --> 34:09.700
Thanks very much for joining me. Sorry was so short again, but we're keeping the streak alive

34:10.540 --> 34:12.540
The daily let's do it
