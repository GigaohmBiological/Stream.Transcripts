Bueller.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.002
Um, he's sick.

02:13.143 --> 02:20.846
My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid is going with the girl who saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night.

02:21.627 --> 02:22.767
I guess it's pretty serious.

02:23.848 --> 02:24.888
Thank you, Simone.

02:30.831 --> 02:34.012
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

03:22.851 --> 03:22.911
you

04:00.836 --> 04:05.017
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:05.477 --> 04:09.678
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:11.638 --> 04:13.199
I think truth is good for kids.

04:13.639 --> 04:14.699
We're so busy lying.

04:14.719 --> 04:17.460
We don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.540
We want everybody to feel good.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.921
That's not, that's not the way life is.

04:24.421 --> 04:28.302
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:30.129 --> 04:30.830
And I have lied.

04:30.850 --> 04:31.912
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:31.932 --> 04:32.854
I don't want to lie.

04:33.355 --> 04:34.697
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:34.797 --> 04:35.839
I try not to be a liar.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.720
I don't want to be a liar.

04:37.281 --> 04:40.006
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:43.783 --> 05:02.315
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:02.335 --> 05:11.922
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

05:15.745 --> 05:28.650
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

05:28.750 --> 05:34.273
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

05:34.573 --> 05:36.514
It's just a big hassle in the end.

05:38.542 --> 05:52.867
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

05:52.927 --> 05:55.427
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

06:12.622 --> 06:24.965
The End

06:56.943 --> 06:58.404
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

06:59.565 --> 07:04.289
We are here for another attempt at dispelling a little bit of the enchantment.

07:05.770 --> 07:06.811
Welcome to the show.

07:08.072 --> 07:11.815
I don't have any coaches, unfortunately.

07:11.835 --> 07:13.156
I'm the coach.

07:15.198 --> 07:16.219
I don't have a team either.

07:18.141 --> 07:21.744
It's just me and my telescope and my

07:23.390 --> 07:26.237
crappy internet and our interesting times.

07:29.584 --> 07:32.852
It is in interesting times that we find ourselves.

07:35.954 --> 07:39.356
And it is really a matter of what is perceived to be true.

07:39.396 --> 07:45.099
We are fighting for everyone to be able to see or enough people to be able to see what's really true.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.401
And so it does really matter what is perceived to be true.

07:50.882 --> 07:53.463
And that's why I'm fighting so vigorously for it.

07:53.763 --> 08:00.046
I know that a lot of people have been characterizing me as just some guy who erratically attacks people.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.688
I don't think there's anything erratic about my behavior.

08:04.728 --> 08:11.109
I think it's methodologically sound and methodical, actually, in the way that I do it.

08:11.809 --> 08:26.613
Because I'm just very curious why so many people, irrespective of how they share my work or pretend to share my work, they don't share the ideas.

08:27.827 --> 08:32.443
They don't seem to be able to take these very succinct questions and just re-ask them.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.904
Throw them at other people.

08:36.105 --> 08:42.290
It's like, yeah, Jay is this, Jay is that, or he has these motives or that motives.

08:42.410 --> 08:43.591
I don't care about me.

08:44.172 --> 08:46.754
Take these questions and start asking them.

08:47.455 --> 08:50.678
Take these incongruencies and start spreading them around.

08:51.378 --> 08:54.381
Don't argue about whether I'm a bad guy or a good guy.

08:54.441 --> 08:56.703
Just take these ideas and run with them.

08:56.983 --> 09:00.066
Steal them from me and spread them around the world.

09:03.183 --> 09:04.904
Use your weaponized piles of money.

09:05.024 --> 09:08.446
Use your 100,000 followers and spread my ideas.

09:08.886 --> 09:10.427
Because you're not spreading my name.

09:12.388 --> 09:14.429
You're not effectively spreading my name.

09:14.469 --> 09:20.493
So just take my ideas and spread them around so that we get out of this so that as many people as possible can see.

09:21.774 --> 09:23.755
Because there's no... there's no...

09:26.035 --> 09:44.440
There's no use in, like, replying here or posting a video on Twitch that you know is going to go away in a few weeks when you know I have my own website, you know I have my own substack, you know I have all these things, but nobody seems to be able to post anything but Twitch.

09:46.058 --> 09:51.721
Nobody recognizes that Jeff from Earth is making all these little clips.

09:52.562 --> 09:57.965
Nobody recognizes that Soothspider's putting up these videos with captions.

09:59.406 --> 10:07.810
And these charlatans and their reflection in the social media meddlers, they are still at it.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.211
They still have all the power.

10:10.292 --> 10:14.114
And if we want to make gentle the life of this world, we're going to have to see through their illusion.

10:16.220 --> 10:20.483
We're going to have to not underestimate how far they're willing to go.

10:20.503 --> 10:23.325
This is for all the marbles.

10:24.286 --> 10:26.988
America remains the last bastion of hope.

10:28.989 --> 10:40.698
As ironic or as ridiculous as that sounds, it's still the case that our Constitution needs demolishing or made to be made irrelevant.

10:43.119 --> 10:44.961
And the way that they are planning to do it

10:47.759 --> 10:52.304
is to create these artificial waves of consensus opinion.

10:53.646 --> 10:56.369
Artificial waves of consensus behavior.

10:58.071 --> 11:06.341
And they are on social media and most of the waves are composed of people like you that don't know they're participating in it.

11:07.352 --> 11:23.676
And if you want your kids and yourself to be able to surf on some kind of surfboard of truth across these waves on social media, you're gonna have to learn to stay focused on the biology, you're gonna have to learn not to take their bait, and you're gonna have to learn to love your neighbor.

11:23.716 --> 11:32.058
Not a random selection of anonymous accounts on one of these social media platforms that seems to agree with you.

11:32.598 --> 11:33.758
Love your neighbor.

11:36.704 --> 11:42.492
Your neighbor could be people that you used to go to college with or used to be friends with before you all had kids.

11:42.552 --> 11:50.563
Your neighbor could be anyone that's alive and breathing and that you can confirm with emails and phone calls.

11:52.332 --> 12:14.711
But if you're spending your time thinking your neighbors are these semi-anonymous accounts run by more than one person or more than one group or more than one AI, you are just turning over your consciousness to coordinated liars that are pretending to run in a consensus from the big wave.

12:16.476 --> 12:20.479
And if you're here for a while, you're on top of this wave, and you're helping share this work.

12:21.240 --> 12:29.246
Maybe even you're on that list of people that is sustaining this work with financial support.

12:29.286 --> 12:31.909
And I really appreciate all of you, as does my family.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.531
It's really, really fantastic.

12:36.732 --> 12:39.375
The momentum that is building, and it's all because of you guys.

12:41.749 --> 12:43.150
It's all because people share it.

12:43.190 --> 12:44.952
It's all because Jeff makes clips.

12:45.012 --> 12:50.016
It's all because somebody, Soothspider, puts captions on.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.879
It's all because you guys take the time, you know?

12:54.259 --> 12:58.263
You could pour yourself a cup of coffee and spend 15 minutes just clip.

12:59.127 --> 13:03.770
paste, cut, paste, cut, paste everywhere you are on social media and you're done.

13:04.851 --> 13:10.355
And if everybody that watches this stream did that, we would have thousands of more viewers by now.

13:10.776 --> 13:12.017
So I'm not saying you're not doing it.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.558
I'm saying that somebody is actively working against us.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.080
The algorithms are pre-programmed against us.

13:17.761 --> 13:25.427
And so we're going to have to be more persistent if we're going to engage in this informed noncompliance and spread the word about it.

13:26.691 --> 13:27.992
This is gig on biological.

13:28.032 --> 13:29.353
Thank you very much for being here.

13:29.693 --> 13:30.754
I'm excited for this show.

13:30.794 --> 13:35.556
It's gonna be really good I

14:03.520 --> 14:04.361
Hello, everyone.

14:04.381 --> 14:07.002
I can't agree more with Garden Variety Human.

14:07.042 --> 14:19.426
We have to talk about these ideas and divorce them from who's speaking about them, but what we're arguing about, we have to divorce the ownership from these questions and just insist

14:20.106 --> 14:22.068
that the correct questions get answered.

14:22.108 --> 14:23.410
But I'm a human just like you.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.472
I have a family just like you.

14:25.512 --> 14:31.479
And to a certain extent, the people that are stealing my ideas, I need to claim credit from.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.601
The people who are promoting them and

14:35.063 --> 14:38.667
You know, all you got to do is send me a message and say, hey, dude, I think this is a great idea.

14:38.707 --> 14:39.508
I'm going to run with it.

14:39.568 --> 14:40.649
I would be fine with it.

14:40.669 --> 14:41.690
But that's not what they do.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.814
Oftentimes they do exactly the opposite.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.317
They don't take my ideas, but they misrepresent them.

14:48.778 --> 14:52.622
And I think I'm going to give a pretty good sort of

14:54.212 --> 15:22.718
presentation about number one the ideas that I want to to spread and that I want to Teach to everybody but also the ways and some crafty ways that these ideas have been Falsely acknowledged falsely amplified and How what an attempt to absorb a message looks like and I think I

15:24.861 --> 15:27.283
I think a great example is this, right?

15:27.323 --> 15:45.594
And so this will serve as a great example for how a message or the message of a messenger can be absorbed, overwhelmed, or just diluted enough so that it's not as, let's say, acidic as it could be.

15:46.074 --> 15:49.456
And that's more or less what this book represents to me and my family.

15:50.137 --> 15:52.879
And so that's going to be a pretty exciting presentation to give.

15:54.020 --> 15:54.941
I don't know who does it.

15:55.061 --> 16:14.282
I don't know who who is responsible ultimately for orchestrating this this This Lollapalooza of liars, but there are witting and unwitting participants there are willing and and coerced participants It's not my job to figure out whoops figure out.

16:14.302 --> 16:14.342
Oh

16:18.585 --> 16:19.746
Oh, I didn't load that up.

16:19.826 --> 16:20.947
Sorry, one second.

16:21.588 --> 16:26.071
I gotta do this, and then I gotta do this, and then I gotta do that.

16:27.993 --> 16:30.655
Restore, and then I suppose I don't have a camera.

16:30.775 --> 16:31.476
Gosh darn it.

16:32.196 --> 16:32.857
Sorry about that.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.820
Sometimes I get ahead of myself here.

16:36.840 --> 16:43.766
And it's a little tricky sometimes when you don't have a staff.

16:45.273 --> 16:46.054
to set up a rig.

16:46.935 --> 16:53.363
So yeah, anyway, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

16:53.904 --> 16:58.330
Transfection in healthy humans is actually criminally negligent and this this could have been known by

17:00.152 --> 17:05.494
thousands of academic biologists around the United States and in the EU and maybe even around the world.

17:06.414 --> 17:28.323
Because these techniques that were misrepresented as investigational vaccines at the beginning of the pandemic already had standard names that were beyond trademarking, transformation and transfection that had been more or less coined by some of these early pioneers in virology and molecular biology, people like Baltimore and Gallo.

17:29.383 --> 17:33.547
So anyway, RNA cannot pandemic, and a lot of biologists ought to know better by now.

17:34.347 --> 17:42.133
But it doesn't seem like anybody really wants to peel back the layers of this onion far enough to get to the stage where they can understand this idea.

17:42.493 --> 17:52.281
They're fine with trying to say that maybe virology has exaggerated some things, or maybe this national security state has exaggerated some things, but they're not really willing

17:52.921 --> 17:57.964
to sort of address why it is that I would say this and say why this is a little too far.

17:58.464 --> 18:04.708
Because if this isn't too far, or this isn't too far, or that's not too far, then why not just say it?

18:05.808 --> 18:13.413
Why spend 45 minutes telling everybody that we screwed up the response to this thing, and we're never really going to know where it came from?

18:13.453 --> 18:15.334
Why spend all those words

18:16.590 --> 18:29.856
when we could say that the national security state has known, the NIH has known, and NIDA has known for a very long time that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system doesn't really work.

18:30.337 --> 18:35.059
But there are some things that kind of predictably happen that we could point to to say it's working.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.281
You know, like antibodies or something like that.

18:39.321 --> 18:43.423
But I mean, we already knew that we didn't really understand what was going on here.

18:44.935 --> 18:49.383
The best we have is a correlative immunity that is somewhat predictable.

18:50.575 --> 18:55.577
which allows them to create the pseudoscience that we do in academia these days.

18:56.097 --> 19:08.943
Again, nobody seems to be able to get to the 30,000 foot level and just say it very simply that all these academic biologists in universities have been using transfection and transformation for at least 10 years now.

19:09.003 --> 19:17.106
So it's strange that when similar technologies were rolled out as investigational vaccines that none of these people demanded a little more detail.

19:17.126 --> 19:17.807
Like, wait a minute,

19:18.547 --> 19:22.650
What differentiates these from all the shit that didn't work before?

19:23.430 --> 19:27.253
Even Robert Malone apparently didn't have the wherewithal to say, hey, wait a minute.

19:27.733 --> 19:31.476
I lost, I gave up these patents like 10 years ago because they sucked.

19:31.896 --> 19:38.260
I got out of transformation and transfection because it sucked, because the immune response was so lame.

19:38.701 --> 19:42.003
So I wonder what these guys did to change stuff.

19:42.043 --> 19:48.207
And apparently his claim very recently is that I guess Peter McCullough or Peter Cullis lied to him.

19:49.967 --> 19:54.828
The guy from Canada who invented the lipid nanoparticle apparently said that they had fixed the problems.

19:55.268 --> 19:56.409
And so that's why he took it.

20:01.970 --> 20:11.532
And so just like any other person with the background and requisite knowledge to know better, Robert Malone knew already at the beginning of the pandemic that transfection in healthy humans was criminal.

20:13.086 --> 20:25.577
I'm sure he was pretty aware that the vaccine schedule in America was ridiculous and also criminal before the pandemic, just like a lot of these people knew, but have never really been able to say it out loud.

20:27.959 --> 20:34.905
And they always stand in front of people like, you know, Brian Hooker or Laura Bono at CHD who would definitely say it out loud.

20:34.986 --> 20:36.507
So they put other people in front of them.

20:37.563 --> 20:45.235
Even somebody like Susan Humphreys, who can say it out loud, they have to put her in a conference with like 40 other people who never say it.

20:49.755 --> 20:51.356
And that's how this magic is done.

20:51.796 --> 20:54.498
That's how these controlled operations work.

20:55.018 --> 20:57.499
They're very much more complicated than you might imagine.

20:58.820 --> 21:15.409
And that's because it is a coordinated group of people that are agreeing to lie, agreeing not to talk about certain things, or agreeing to try and convince this person to stop doing something, or to stop dividing, or stop so erratically attacking everyone.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.211
And it's not erratic.

21:20.651 --> 21:21.692
It is a behavior.

21:22.052 --> 21:22.792
It's a pattern.

21:22.872 --> 21:27.075
You see a pattern where either people are consistently learning throughout the pandemic.

21:27.555 --> 21:42.004
And as they learn, their rhetoric changes or they keep circling back, you know, like a hamster wheel or circumlocution where they keep going around the target, but they don't actually ever, ever approach it directly.

21:45.239 --> 21:52.161
And so even though there were lots of different ways to say these three ideas, no one is taking it and running with it.

21:52.221 --> 21:55.622
No one's saying anything like these things either.

21:55.682 --> 22:02.944
You could make a nice comic about free-range RNA molecules and how, oh my goodness, the barn door is open or something like that.

22:02.984 --> 22:08.225
But that's not going to happen, unless the cartoonist guy hears of me.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.446
Maybe he will, because he's probably a pretty good guy.

22:11.980 --> 22:16.703
So what I want you to do is listen to this video, because I want to make a point about it afterward.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.026
This is one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time.

22:20.066 --> 22:23.468
If you don't know who it is, it's Bobby Knight from the University of Indiana.

22:23.969 --> 22:39.039
And here he's going to be talking about coaching the 1984 Olympic team with all the 1984 Olympic team, in case you don't remember, was the dream team that had all the crazy greats from the 80s, Magic Johnson, Bird, Jordan.

22:42.216 --> 22:56.329
You know, like, like Mullen was on there and Malone was on there and and Robinson was on there and Elijah Juan was on there and just, you know, all the legends and Michael Jordan was fairly young but in his prime basketball.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.833
And so this is him talking about coaching that team.

23:01.866 --> 23:10.272
Somebody made the comparison because I'm angry and because I would throw a chair, I guess, that I'm the Bobby Knight of biology.

23:10.312 --> 23:14.215
But I would argue that I'm definitely not the Bobby Knight of biology.

23:14.255 --> 23:17.498
But I want to use a video of Bobby Knight to make a point.

23:19.019 --> 23:22.081
When today's over, we have to work to change it.

23:22.921 --> 23:29.705
But you, I think, have got to really be a flexible leader if you're going to be an effective leader.

23:30.265 --> 23:31.806
I walked into the locker room.

23:33.748 --> 23:34.128
You know what?

23:34.308 --> 23:35.449
I think you're right about that.

23:36.769 --> 23:40.292
But he's talking about coaching the 1984 Olympic team.

23:40.312 --> 23:42.033
So that might not have been the dream team yet.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.353
I don't know when the dream team was.

23:43.854 --> 23:44.294
So you're right.

23:44.334 --> 23:45.355
You might be right about that.

23:45.395 --> 23:49.337
But he's talking about coaching the Olympic team when Michael Jordan was on the team.

23:49.397 --> 23:52.179
So I apologize if that detail was wrong.

23:52.219 --> 23:52.479
You're right.

23:56.338 --> 24:04.963
After the first half of our game with Spain in 1984 for the gold medal, we're ahead by 29 points.

24:06.204 --> 24:09.506
We've played basketball as well as the game can be played.

24:11.807 --> 24:15.789
Michael Jordan has played 12 minutes out of the 20.

24:16.790 --> 24:20.892
He has 11 rebounds, 9 assists, and 19 points in 12 minutes.

24:23.982 --> 24:33.445
In my opinion, there's nobody that's ever played anything that can compare to Michael Jordan with the possible exception of Jack Nicklaus and Babe Ruth.

24:35.046 --> 24:41.168
Michael Jordan is just the best there ever was at what he does by a considerable margin.

24:44.540 --> 24:56.723
So I'm walking across the floor with this 29-point lead as I look at the scoreboard, and I'm a great believer in the best three minutes of the game for us has got to be the first three minutes of the second half.

24:57.423 --> 24:58.863
But what the hell am I gonna say?

24:58.883 --> 25:00.424
Hey, we gotta get better.

25:00.464 --> 25:01.864
We're 29 points ahead.

25:01.884 --> 25:02.644
We gotta win by 59.

25:04.805 --> 25:07.625
These kids are gonna be a little bit satisfied with themselves.

25:08.986 --> 25:10.306
They know how well they play.

25:11.738 --> 25:14.860
And when I get to the locker room, I still haven't come up with an answer.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.882
I open the door, and the first guy I see is Jordan, sitting in front of his locker.

25:22.504 --> 25:23.644
Idea light flashes.

25:23.704 --> 25:26.306
I say to myself, I'm going to get on Jordan's ass a little bit.

25:27.606 --> 25:34.250
And everybody else is going to say, God, if he's upset with Jordan, how does he feel about me?

25:34.270 --> 25:35.670
12 minutes, 19 points, 11 rebounds.

25:38.226 --> 25:42.428
So I want to, I want to clarify everything so everybody doesn't argue about it it's my mistake.

25:43.428 --> 25:52.071
This is when Michael Jordan was still in college still playing at North Carolina but when they were only taking college kids to the Olympics still.

25:52.811 --> 25:53.251
And so in 1984.

25:54.932 --> 26:02.739
Bobby Knight was the coach of the Olympic team when they took college kids, when Michael Jordan was playing for North Carolina.

26:02.820 --> 26:09.346
And still, they hadn't done the Dream Team yet, because the Dream Team was the first time they ever took pros to the Olympics.

26:09.366 --> 26:12.849
So I apologize for dropping that ball, actually.

26:13.570 --> 26:16.312
And I want to go back a little bit, because it's a really good

26:17.293 --> 26:19.914
Story and I want you to really hear what he's saying.

26:19.994 --> 26:44.742
So they're they're 29 points ahead Michael Jordan is the best player he's ever seen he scored 19 points in 12 minutes and they're going into halftime and he believes as a coach That the second half the first three minutes of the second half have to be the best three minutes of your game That's what he shoots for so he wants to motivate the players in the locker room during halftime even though they're up by 29

26:46.383 --> 26:47.344
What's he gonna say?

26:50.286 --> 26:54.249
You see why I'm not Bobby Knight of biology yet?

26:57.151 --> 27:06.539
In my opinion, there's nobody that's ever played anything that can compare to Michael Jordan with the possible exception of Jack Nicklaus and Babe Ruth.

27:08.220 --> 27:14.285
Michael Jordan is just the best there ever was at what he does by a considerable margin.

27:17.679 --> 27:29.869
So I'm walking across the floor with this 29-point lead as I look at the scoreboard, and I'm a great believer in the best three minutes of the game for us has got to be the first three minutes of the second half.

27:30.569 --> 27:32.031
But what the hell am I going to say?

27:32.571 --> 27:33.572
Hey, we got to get better.

27:33.612 --> 27:34.993
We're 29 points ahead.

27:35.053 --> 27:35.794
We got to win by 59.

27:37.975 --> 27:40.798
These kids are going to be a little bit satisfied with themselves.

27:42.139 --> 27:43.480
They know how well they play.

27:44.895 --> 27:47.998
And when I get to the locker room, I still haven't come up with an answer.

27:49.038 --> 27:53.042
I open the door and the first guy I see is Jordan sitting in front of his locker.

27:55.664 --> 27:56.805
Idea light flashes.

27:56.845 --> 27:59.467
I say to myself, I'm going to get on Jordan's ass a little bit.

28:00.768 --> 28:05.612
And everybody else is going to say, God, if he's upset with Jordan, how does he feel about me?

28:07.414 --> 28:18.400
12 minutes, 19 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists, and I have the stat sheet in my hand and I walk over in front of Jordan and I look down at him and I say, Mike, when the hell are you going to set a screen?

28:21.022 --> 28:27.085
We got four guys out there screening when you're in the game, screening to get you open, screening to get each other open.

28:27.325 --> 28:29.086
Haven't seen you set a screen yet.

28:29.387 --> 28:33.349
The only way I get all five guys screening, Mike, is to get you the hell out of the game.

28:34.039 --> 28:35.680
Now, when are you going to set a screen?

28:35.940 --> 28:39.963
All you've been doing so far, God damn it, is rebounding, passing, and scoring.

28:40.324 --> 28:41.645
You need to screen, Mike.

28:45.688 --> 28:47.649
Now, Jordan, you've all seen the grin.

28:47.709 --> 28:49.430
I mean, it's the greatest grin in the world.

28:50.771 --> 28:56.936
Doesn't quite use all of his grin in this circumstance, but he looks up at me and he grins a little bit and he says, Coach,

28:58.427 --> 29:02.469
Didn't I see last week where you said I was the quickest player you'd ever been around?

29:02.529 --> 29:05.750
I said, Mike, what the hell has that got to do with you screening?

29:06.051 --> 29:10.753
Coach, I think I'm setting them quicker than you can see them out there.

29:15.695 --> 29:23.639
Well, I was flexible enough to look at Jordan and say, then, God damn it, slow them down a little bit so I can see them.

29:26.471 --> 29:39.273
Now, the reason why I bring this video up is because here is Bobby Knight trying to explain how he can motivate people when they're already performing at their finest and how he would do it.

29:39.993 --> 29:45.794
And making, obviously, this is a nice speech and it's part of a longer one and he's making a joke and it is very funny.

29:46.475 --> 29:47.855
It's probably a true story.

29:48.295 --> 29:54.436
What I really am trying to emphasize here is that we aren't working, whoa, why did that happen?

29:56.149 --> 30:01.333
Okay, I got to escape for a second here because I guess there's an automatic transition there that I don't want.

30:06.077 --> 30:12.322
And so what I'm trying to say here is that we aren't working with a dream basketball team.

30:12.402 --> 30:19.808
We're not working with a starting lineup that is now starting in the game because they've played four seasons.

30:20.909 --> 30:24.053
2020 we weren't sure who to put in.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.294
2021 some new people arrived.

30:25.555 --> 30:28.418
2022 we had some new draft picks.

30:28.438 --> 30:36.747
23 though you know we're working with the veterans and the two draft picks we traded one and now in 2024 we sent the dream team to the U.S.

30:36.787 --> 30:37.087
Senate.

30:38.409 --> 30:39.309
That's that's no.

30:43.499 --> 30:55.423
And so when I'm trying to point out that there's weird patterns in people's behaviors, or they're still not saying what needs to be said, it's not because I'm trying to nitpick people so that I can get views on the internet.

30:56.363 --> 31:00.004
It's not because my shtick is to just nitpick everybody.

31:02.745 --> 31:08.987
These people have exhibited behaviors that only can be explained by coordinated traders.

31:09.898 --> 31:30.343
and foreign meddlers who are specifically interested in American opinion and American opinions and aren't very busy saving their home countries, aren't very busy developing home solutions, but really interested in what's going on in the American Congress or the American social media.

31:37.256 --> 31:43.721
I really wish I could be Bobby Knight of biology and that I was just trying to get this team to perform at its finest.

31:43.841 --> 31:45.082
I wish that was the case.

31:48.244 --> 31:54.969
But I'm trying to explain to the spectating public that none of these people are playing basketball.

31:58.492 --> 32:01.234
These people are agreeing to sabotage the game.

32:03.916 --> 32:06.258
It's the Globetrotters versus the generals.

32:18.732 --> 32:22.514
We need to use ridiculous statements that make our things clear.

32:23.855 --> 32:26.397
What they won't talk about, what they can't talk about.

32:26.497 --> 32:29.278
Free-range RNA molecules are what they're talking about.

32:29.298 --> 32:33.281
You know, if you had a fear and cleavage site or two, look out, start the air raid siren.

32:36.325 --> 32:53.734
And it's these bad ideas that are being consciously and intelligently sustained on the internet by a chorus of liars that agrees to walk very close to, but not encroach on the borders of this limited spectrum of debate about a novel virus.

32:53.914 --> 33:03.059
And I'm frustrated about it because a lot of these people spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get me to say certain stuff, or you gotta write stuff up, man.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.701
Nobody can listen to your two-hour videos.

33:06.391 --> 33:07.252
Well then ignore me.

33:11.115 --> 33:14.437
What does it matter what I say if everybody's ignoring me anyway?

33:14.878 --> 33:18.961
What does it matter what I tweet if you have 200,000 followers and I have 10?

33:21.043 --> 33:25.686
But somehow or another, all these people have had enough.

33:25.746 --> 33:30.910
So they're all blocking me or ignoring me or slagging me off after they block me.

33:32.812 --> 33:35.274
And all I'm suggesting is, is that this,

33:41.118 --> 33:49.222
This is a lie that certain people were put in place in 2020 in order to curate its discovery.

33:51.683 --> 34:02.408
And we were supposed to discover it as the solution to a mystery that all of these people agreed we should solve, that has a couple reasonable answers to it.

34:03.413 --> 34:09.614
And we've come to the conclusion after four and a half years that the most likely cause is a lab leak.

34:09.634 --> 34:12.215
But you know, those people are gonna deny it forever anyway.

34:12.255 --> 34:15.956
So it's at some point, it's not even really worth arguing about, right?

34:17.936 --> 34:21.997
And that's essentially the conclusion of these people.

34:22.057 --> 34:23.557
This is not the dream team.

34:23.597 --> 34:30.419
This is not a starting lineup that has evolved over several seasons of coaching and performance evaluation.

34:31.943 --> 34:42.847
This is not the starting lineup of a organically generated best case scenario for regard to what team would rise to the surface.

34:43.447 --> 34:50.990
Who are the sharpest doctors and the sharpest orators with regard to clearing this whole biosecurity lie up?

34:51.890 --> 34:52.551
It's not them.

34:55.492 --> 34:58.673
This is the carefully titrated and filtered team

35:01.636 --> 35:11.764
that is an interweaved globetrotters and generals kind of thing so that it looks like some people are better than others or get it better or do it better.

35:15.567 --> 35:17.189
Even the referees are fake.

35:21.277 --> 35:37.707
And that's why these people were conspicuously present in 2020, conspicuously present in 2020 with conspicuously on target ideas that would funnel everyone's conscious opinion about these things right into a mystery of a lab leak or a natural virus.

35:37.767 --> 35:49.034
And look where we are today, funneled in by people that used to work for the Human Genome Project, which is the Department of Energy, which was a classified

35:50.043 --> 35:59.107
project which took intellectual property from that and made multi-generational wealth from.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.788
Where's the loyalty of this person?

36:01.848 --> 36:13.652
With the United States and with our collective kid's future or with the people that gave him the multi-generational wealth and his family, the multi-generational wealth?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.013
He's got brothers and stuff too.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.914
Come on, they gotta look after their own first.

36:20.367 --> 36:26.952
Apparently he's not too worried about sea levels rising because he's got, you know, the Atlantic Ocean in his backyard.

36:30.135 --> 36:32.577
And he's been promoted by CHD who fired me.

36:33.577 --> 36:37.000
He's been promoted as a hero by Mary Holland who fired me.

36:38.041 --> 36:46.848
Mary Holland, who is all about the UNESCO, you know, human rights and all about free choice in vaccines.

36:48.271 --> 36:51.813
Can't just say that the United States vaccine schedule is criminal.

36:51.853 --> 36:54.355
That would be, that would be too straight and to the point.

36:56.677 --> 37:07.844
That's why when I was gonna be on Bobby's podcast and I gave them my slides, they panicked and decided that, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, no, no.

37:07.884 --> 37:12.367
You're only gonna get seven minutes now and we're gonna put you on screen with a bunch of a,

37:14.364 --> 37:24.054
a unbelievable preeminent panel of experts that will comment on your seven-minute hypothesis, synopsis, whatever.

37:27.377 --> 37:28.418
This is how they do it.

37:30.100 --> 37:42.928
they have orchestrated these little bubbles of opinion and orchestrated these little bubbles of people that then trap other people into thinking that they're listening and that, oh yeah, well, I got an email from him yesterday.

37:42.968 --> 37:43.448
Okay, cool.

37:43.468 --> 37:46.430
Well then we'll work together and then we'll do that tomorrow.

37:46.450 --> 37:47.310
Okay, right on, cool.

37:47.350 --> 37:48.651
Well, we were on this podcast.

37:48.671 --> 37:49.391
Can you share that?

37:49.472 --> 37:50.192
Sure, no problem.

37:50.592 --> 37:51.693
I put out this sub stack.

37:51.713 --> 37:52.353
Can you share that?

37:52.393 --> 37:53.154
Yeah, no problem.

37:53.634 --> 37:56.956
Here's every one of the sub stack articles that I ever write for you to share.

37:57.436 --> 37:58.457
Don't forget to share them.

38:03.629 --> 38:07.071
But these same people can't seem to share my videos because they're so long.

38:07.131 --> 38:10.333
Like, I can't ask people to watch two-hour videos, man.

38:11.093 --> 38:12.894
You gotta write something or make it shorter.

38:14.595 --> 38:15.716
Oh, here's my substack.

38:15.936 --> 38:16.156
Oops.

38:17.477 --> 38:21.239
Can't share that either because that's two-hour videos with subtitles.

38:29.124 --> 38:32.086
We are dealing with dishonorable people, ladies and gentlemen.

38:33.066 --> 38:43.835
We're dealing with people that have loyalties that aren't to our children and our children's children, to America and to our parents who, you know, our grandparents that served.

38:45.116 --> 38:46.938
My grandfather and my father served.

38:46.998 --> 38:57.167
I mean, I don't make a big deal about it, but it's not like people in my family haven't, haven't given a little.

38:59.520 --> 39:09.628
And I find it a little strange, you know, that these people with all these loyalties and all these connections across and overseas, all these, I'm sure he's really a great guy.

39:09.668 --> 39:11.149
I mean, I've known him for over a year.

39:12.250 --> 39:21.657
I trust him with my life, even though I've never sat in a room with him before, but I'm sure, I mean, you know, after all this Zooming together, I know he's great.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.481
And so I'm calling out these people.

39:26.501 --> 39:28.523
A lot of them are Americans, but not all.

39:30.071 --> 39:44.020
And I'm suggesting that if you get enough of these people to agree to work together, then no matter who of these people you choose, you're going to get a mishmash of a shit sandwich that will never get you anywhere.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.262
And if they need to, they'll put you right in the middle.

39:48.598 --> 39:55.100
like they did with this lady and that man and that man, right in the middle of all these other people.

39:55.140 --> 39:57.001
And you'll get to say that vaccines are bad.

39:57.021 --> 40:00.202
You'll get to say that we've been saying vaccines are bad for a long time.

40:00.822 --> 40:03.983
You'll get to say maybe even that you wrote a book about how bad vaccines are.

40:04.383 --> 40:17.728
But because all of these other people have already rehearsed on countless podcasts, the pitch that they wanna say, and because they've all agreed to say in the background that, well, we think that Kevin McKernan's, you know,

40:18.447 --> 40:19.689
video is the most important.

40:19.749 --> 40:27.241
And if it's not Kevin McKernan's, then it's definitely Robert Malone's, or it's definitely Jessica Rose, or it's definitely what Brent Weinstein said.

40:27.261 --> 40:31.048
I mean, these are the things that you should circulate the fastest and the most.

40:33.308 --> 40:42.931
And so then even though Brian is thrilled that he was finally able to be a part of this thing, even though Nancy, I think is her name, is super happy to be a part of it.

40:43.371 --> 40:48.752
Essentially, all the stuff that circulated on the internet wasn't Brian Hooker's presentation.

40:51.673 --> 40:59.495
Did you see CHD sharing specifically, our scientist Brian Hooker was speaking at the Senate and we're so proud of him.

41:02.145 --> 41:03.486
I don't know, check it out.

41:03.566 --> 41:04.987
Maybe it happened, but I doubt it.

41:06.348 --> 41:13.454
It would surprise me very much, let me say it that way, that instead of Brian, it wouldn't surprise me at all that they chose someone else.

41:17.317 --> 41:18.598
And it wouldn't be by accident.

41:20.360 --> 41:26.465
Just like they recorded a whole interview about my experience helping out with this,

41:27.913 --> 41:30.435
And after the video, they said, you know, it wasn't that good.

41:30.535 --> 41:31.915
Like it won't sell the book.

41:31.995 --> 41:34.377
Like we can't really release that video, Jay.

41:35.197 --> 41:47.645
And then about two weeks later, I guess I got fired for saying something about Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and how it seemed like Robert Malone was saying that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:47.665 --> 41:54.589
wouldn't make as good a candidate as Trump because he was a terrible manager and that the example that he was using was CHD.

41:56.104 --> 41:58.185
He said, exhibit one, CHD.

41:58.345 --> 42:09.830
And so then that was strange because I said, you know, I saw at Bobby's announcement in Boston, Meryl Nass and Robert Malone approached each other and just hugged without words.

42:12.025 --> 42:13.045
they know each other well.

42:13.365 --> 42:25.948
And so it's strange for him knowing that, you know, so much of Merrill's time and effort has gone into supporting the work of CHD as their, you know, scientific advisor for so long.

42:26.788 --> 42:41.151
It's kind of strange because as I heard the story, Mary Holland and Merrill Nass went to Robert Malone's farm and stayed there for a couple of days in order to vet him before they decided to support his book or whatever.

42:42.896 --> 42:51.923
I don't know if I'm getting those details exactly right, but I know for sure I was told that Mary and Meryl went to their farm and stayed a couple days in order to vet him.

42:52.983 --> 42:57.487
So maybe that was for Fauci's book and maybe not for Robert Malone's book.

42:57.527 --> 43:00.109
I have no idea, but they published both of those books, so whatever.

43:00.629 --> 43:08.154
But the point is that it's strange that then Robert Malone would turn around and remember, you know, Robert Malone's book.

43:09.135 --> 43:10.436
Sorry, but I just want to point it out.

43:10.456 --> 43:11.537
I'm not trying to be a creep.

43:12.475 --> 43:16.479
Robert Malone's book is published by Children's Health Defense.

43:16.519 --> 43:17.160
It's right there.

43:17.620 --> 43:26.329
So it's kind of a dick move for him to, in December of 2023, to say that Bobby's not as good a candidate as Trump because Bobby's not a very good manager.

43:26.469 --> 43:28.731
Exhibit one, CHD.

43:28.791 --> 43:29.692
So I called it out.

43:29.712 --> 43:30.873
I said it on my stream.

43:30.893 --> 43:32.334
I think it was the 23rd or the 22nd of December.

43:34.156 --> 43:36.918
of last year, I said it's just kind of bullshit.

43:37.058 --> 43:59.890
I had a dude walking on the moon behind me, and a list of all the things that Robert Malone said, and I just thought it's really strange that this guy would be such a creep to the organization that's fighting for children's health, that published his book, that his really good friend that he embraces without saying anything in Boston, that it's a shitty organization.

43:59.930 --> 44:03.392
It's just like, wow, I mean, that's pretty hardcore.

44:04.625 --> 44:12.253
And yet here he is, you know, right in front of the Senate and with Brian Hooker, you know, whatever.

44:12.433 --> 44:13.454
I guess it's OK.

44:14.015 --> 44:15.536
It's not a very good organization.

44:15.556 --> 44:17.539
I mean, it's managed pretty shitty, I guess.

44:18.079 --> 44:21.222
I wonder if he would say it's now managed pretty shitty by Mary Holland or.

44:22.984 --> 44:31.052
Don't forget that Mary Holland was like working as the general campaign manager or something like that for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

44:31.092 --> 44:33.715
until I got hired by CHD.

44:33.735 --> 44:39.761
And then she came back to be the president and CEO of CHD again.

44:39.861 --> 44:46.048
She left the campaign exactly like a week or two after I came to CHD and started working.

44:46.738 --> 44:50.401
Which is notable to me, because you were working for Bobby, right?

44:50.761 --> 44:58.207
And now I think that guy is one of the dudes that replaced her, Del Bigtree.

44:59.861 --> 45:08.307
And so I just got to keep getting all these details out there and somebody else can take all the notes and write it all up because, you know, I guess it's really important that this all gets written up.

45:08.747 --> 45:12.410
I personally think we've got enough in all these notebooks for a really great book.

45:13.351 --> 45:17.934
But, you know, until I write it up, I guess it's just going to be inaccessible in two hour long videos.

45:20.032 --> 45:31.859
So this limited spectrum of debate within which a very lively discussion is happening has been curated for four and a half years, and I still think we need to reveal a few more of those curators.

45:32.939 --> 45:42.385
I think that there are groups even on the internet that are essentially speckled with meddlers that can kind of keep them off of the

45:42.865 --> 45:59.200
escape route off of the escape key and still running in the hamster wheels that we need to run in for a few more years before they have sufficiently undermined our sovereignty so they can just turn on the switches and close the doors.

46:00.521 --> 46:09.425
This has been going on for a long time, and I'm afraid the only thing that they have left is attributing bad motives to us because they can't really discuss our ideas.

46:09.905 --> 46:14.447
That's why they won't discuss these ideas or a different spin on them.

46:14.527 --> 46:15.187
They just won't.

46:16.088 --> 46:23.351
And so I'm very curious because I want to explain some behavior on the internet as patterns.

46:24.591 --> 46:44.626
You know, this pattern of the crack pipe meme with me is fantastic because it started all the way with my number one fan, Kevin McCarron in Japan, and has gone all the way to my, probably the one that provides me with the most humor, Debunk the Funk, Dan Wilson.

46:46.588 --> 46:48.790
It's just too bad I missed him while he was in Pittsburgh.

46:49.130 --> 46:50.411
It would have been great if he would have been

46:51.618 --> 46:53.881
just one year longer in Pittsburgh or something like that.

46:53.921 --> 46:56.924
I could have accidentally ran into him on the street or something.

46:57.725 --> 47:05.293
What they're basically doing, again, is this little train performance where they pretend that they are integral in the operation of the subway.

47:05.353 --> 47:10.039
And so what this guy is doing is he's pretending that he is necessary to stop the train.

47:12.116 --> 47:15.079
and it's also necessary for him to start the train.

47:15.600 --> 47:33.275
And I would argue that people like Pierre Cory and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch and Brett Weinstein were all performing a form of this kind of masquerade where they were pretending to ask meaningful questions, pretending to meaningfully whistleblow on one idea or another, or

47:34.176 --> 47:42.681
or pretending to meaningfully expose the cover-up of the Scooby-Doo mystery that we are all supposed to solve.

47:43.121 --> 47:46.863
And that's exactly what this misleading of the young is designed to do.

47:47.384 --> 47:53.667
These people are part of an operation that is designed to get us to inevitably teach this lie to our children.

47:54.548 --> 47:56.009
And that lie is a pandemic.

47:57.350 --> 48:03.033
Now, it's curious to me because I really have a problem if somebody can't say it.

48:04.178 --> 48:06.300
Claire Craig is an interesting player.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.383
She is the co-chair of the Heart Group in the UK.

48:11.364 --> 48:13.646
She's got more than 200,000 followers.

48:14.226 --> 48:24.295
She was a co-author on the original Corman-Dwarston report that I showed you the video of Kevin McCairn and this Bobby Malhotra guy, who may or may not be a good guy.

48:24.335 --> 48:27.057
He might've been a good guy that needed to be co-opted by the other ones.

48:27.137 --> 48:27.658
I don't know.

48:28.278 --> 48:32.142
But the point is, is that that paper is a very interesting starting point.

48:33.182 --> 48:36.566
And we'll look at that, the author list on that paper in a second.

48:37.487 --> 48:39.969
And she says it's fine to believe in gain of function.

48:40.010 --> 48:42.352
Specifically, this is a tweet from June.

48:44.099 --> 48:46.860
June 8th, which is, I guess, two days ago.

48:47.441 --> 48:49.482
You can believe there is a virus.

48:49.522 --> 48:51.563
You can believe that virus killed people.

48:52.023 --> 48:54.184
You can believe gain of function played a role.

48:54.784 --> 48:57.505
And none of that would contradict what Alan says here.

48:57.906 --> 49:00.607
In fact, it's all easier when a virus is spreading.

49:00.647 --> 49:06.490
Now, I'm not going to now promote another person with the regurgitation of the Scooby-Doo.

49:06.870 --> 49:10.732
What I want to point out is that this one is someone that may, possibly,

49:11.192 --> 49:19.024
have been put in place very early at the beginning of the pandemic to slowly titrate the understanding of the public, and she may not be aware of it.

49:21.007 --> 49:21.368
But in 2024,

49:25.014 --> 49:28.217
I gotta point out that you're not playing, this is not good.

49:28.517 --> 49:30.219
This is dumb.

49:30.319 --> 49:31.540
This is a dumb tweet.

49:31.680 --> 49:38.566
And since she has so many followers, it seems really strange that we shouldn't at least correct her on this.

49:38.987 --> 49:43.491
It would be very bad if our children grew up believing there was a novel virus.

49:44.492 --> 49:49.797
It would be very bad if college kids continue to believe that gain of function played a role.

49:50.836 --> 49:57.901
It will be very bad if we don't answer the question of whether a particular virus is spreading or not.

49:59.162 --> 50:09.450
And Claire doesn't seem to be interested in answering any of these things, even though she is an elevated thought leader in more than one country.

50:10.891 --> 50:13.573
A lot of her followers are American, even though she's in the UK.

50:16.232 --> 50:20.983
They murdered people to make people think there was a virus, Claire.

50:21.444 --> 50:22.506
So it's important.

50:26.007 --> 50:30.769
If you said it like, they murdered people to make you believe there was a virus.

50:30.849 --> 50:34.211
They murdered people to make you believe a virus killed people.

50:34.631 --> 50:38.053
They murdered people to make you believe gain of function played a role.

50:38.573 --> 50:41.254
And none of that would contradict what Allen says here.

50:41.554 --> 50:44.936
In fact, it would be easier if there were viruses everywhere.

50:45.736 --> 50:49.618
Now that might've been a great tweet, but this is bullshit.

50:51.584 --> 50:52.906
And so I called her out on it.

50:52.966 --> 51:00.195
I said, hey, Jonathan Engler, Nick Hudson, those are two people that I've been in contact with for a while now.

51:00.255 --> 51:03.259
I think Nick Hudson tries really hard.

51:03.339 --> 51:05.382
I don't know how to say it any other way.

51:05.402 --> 51:07.064
He's promoted me more than once.

51:08.065 --> 51:35.821
We've had arguments more than once and he's come back and forth more than once and so have I and so I respect the guy And I see him being you know called a meddler I see him and panda just being dismissed as one big group and I treat Nick as Nick and Nick is one of the very few people in 2024 to have mentioned my name on a podcast maybe he did it because he had to but I'm not that pessimistic yet and

51:38.683 --> 51:49.069
Now, with regard to this statement, there were a lot of people behind the scenes that were trying to say, no, Claire's great, Claire's great, come on, we trust her, she's awesome.

51:49.830 --> 51:57.455
Which I don't really agree with, like you just correct people, and if they're your friends, and you know them well, then don't tweet it, but correct her.

51:59.396 --> 52:04.239
And explain to her why it is that having this tweet up would be a bad idea.

52:05.987 --> 52:12.211
When it doesn't get people to think in the direction we need them to think in order for them to extricate themselves.

52:12.271 --> 52:17.674
The point is for people to extricate themselves, not for them to be given the answer.

52:18.794 --> 52:22.056
That's the part that always frustrates me when people say, send me some papers.

52:22.616 --> 52:25.338
No, pull your own head out.

52:29.468 --> 52:31.809
And so I really think this is a problem, okay?

52:31.829 --> 52:34.290
You can't say you can believe there was a virus.

52:34.330 --> 52:37.231
You can't say you can believe that a virus killed people.

52:37.271 --> 52:40.592
You can't say that, but you can believe gain of function played a role.

52:40.712 --> 52:43.073
In fact, it's easier when a virus is spreading too.

52:43.913 --> 52:46.834
What matters is what's perceived to be true.

52:48.115 --> 52:53.537
So you can't just let people believe what isn't true or we're already

53:01.243 --> 53:11.454
And so I'm very curious because Jonathan Engler wanted me to write a, well, at one point.

53:26.198 --> 53:40.539
So Jonathan Engler is the co-chair of the Heart Group, and in 2024 there is this new UK website group thing about some kind of national testimony thing, kind of like I guess the NCI in Canada, I don't know.

53:42.005 --> 53:59.132
And so I want to watch that testimony today because I'm very curious as to what is said and what's not said And so that's this thing that I'm talking about the people's vaccine inquiry And they're gonna do a module on vaccines and then a module for

54:00.356 --> 54:05.078
I don't know exactly what this is, but if you look at it, there's Claire Craig.

54:05.198 --> 54:07.318
Claire Craig is a diagnostic pathologist.

54:07.338 --> 54:14.321
She practiced in the NIH for 15 years, becoming a fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists.

54:14.421 --> 54:19.582
In 2016, she became the day-to-day lead for pathology and clinical data in the cancer arm of the 100,000 Genomes Project.

54:21.263 --> 54:24.024
and she also worked in AI cancer diagnosis.

54:24.984 --> 54:33.445
From May 2020, Claire Craig has worked full-time pro bono on COVID research, distilling the evidence for a lay audience.

54:34.006 --> 54:40.887
And since January in 2021, she's co-chaired the health advisory and recovery team with Jonathan Engler.

54:41.007 --> 54:43.708
So that's who this guy is down here.

54:43.748 --> 54:49.689
And Jonathan Engler has been in contact with me because we met at Panda and because

54:52.031 --> 54:58.755
A couple times we were going to collaborate on something to do with virology.

55:00.036 --> 55:15.465
At one point there was this idea that maybe we would write together with Martin Neal and maybe Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson a little review about what infectious clones were and how they're used in virology.

55:16.305 --> 55:26.713
And we started to build, sorry, I should say, I started to review, build a review that was annotated with notes and explaining why I was choosing these papers and what these papers showed.

55:27.153 --> 55:31.337
And these guys really didn't even open the document as far as I can tell.

55:31.377 --> 55:34.859
Maybe they opened it in the two or three weeks that it existed.

55:34.899 --> 55:39.463
And then at some point I was just like, well, if you guys aren't going to comment or do anything, then I'm just going to stop.

55:40.263 --> 55:42.885
And this was already the second time we tried to write something.

55:42.925 --> 55:46.206
The first time we tried to write something, I tried to write something about the Scooby-Doo.

55:46.667 --> 55:47.607
And it was kind of funny.

55:47.687 --> 55:49.828
I was just testing them to see what they would do.

55:51.149 --> 55:52.190
And they didn't really...

55:53.052 --> 55:54.613
contribute anything, I think.

55:54.713 --> 55:57.075
And so I didn't understand really what happened.

55:57.095 --> 56:01.679
Then the McKernan thing happened again, and now they wanted to write that.

56:01.799 --> 56:12.468
And I put quite a bit of work into assembling some of the stuff that I have in my archives about how to understand clones and what I was doing now for my small mini courses.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.744
And then about two weeks ago, I believe, I was asked to read.

56:20.784 --> 56:23.366
There's the Hart Group, in case you didn't know that.

56:23.526 --> 56:24.287
These are the Hart Group.

56:24.307 --> 56:27.289
There's Jonathan there, if my mouse is there.

56:27.489 --> 56:30.291
And there's Norman Fenton, I believe that guy is.

56:31.392 --> 56:32.833
I know I recognize that dude.

56:33.874 --> 56:35.675
And then there's Claire Craig again.

56:35.715 --> 56:38.317
So those are the two co-chairs of the Hart Group.

56:38.777 --> 56:42.660
And then they wrote Martin Neal and Jonathan Engler.

56:42.920 --> 56:43.921
Martin Neal is there.

56:45.144 --> 56:46.565
Jonathan Engler is here.

56:47.967 --> 56:49.308
And they both have substacks.

56:49.848 --> 56:54.932
They wanted to write something about the Scooby-Doo a while back, and that didn't work out.

56:55.633 --> 57:04.179
And then we were going to write kind of a rebuttal to Kevin McKernan about infectious clones and whether they're significant or not significant.

57:05.340 --> 57:07.322
And then that fell apart.

57:09.352 --> 57:20.357
And then I was given a version of this sub stack, let's say five days ago, but this is, and it's not five days ago, cause this was released on May 30th.

57:20.377 --> 57:25.280
So let's say that I was given it on May 25th, but I think that's being a little bit generous.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.641
I think it was like the 28th or the 27th.

57:28.141 --> 57:28.761
Could be wrong.

57:28.801 --> 57:29.862
It could have been even earlier.

57:29.882 --> 57:32.603
It could have been a week before they published it.

57:32.623 --> 57:33.984
And they asked me if I would read it.

57:35.612 --> 57:46.039
And so just to kind of reenact what happened, so I opened the text and it wasn't already formatted like this, of course, but it already had kind of a summary at the beginning.

57:46.079 --> 57:54.906
A thorough review of the available evidence suggests that the emergence of a novel engineered virus is the least likely explanation for the event known as the COVID pandemic.

57:55.626 --> 58:05.691
And so I scrolled down virology research with the intention of enhancing pathogenicity is nevertheless unethical and unnecessary and as such should cease.

58:06.592 --> 58:13.676
And so I realized that already, okay, you're kind of, we should adapt gain of function, claim of function.

58:13.756 --> 58:18.418
I'm not sure yet, wait, now there's coronavirus fields, virology.

58:18.458 --> 58:19.779
And I thought, wait, are we just gonna

58:20.788 --> 58:26.010
write a review about coronaviruses, and I kept going, and it's super long, and I'm like, wow, really?

58:26.030 --> 58:29.951
And this is all stuff that I covered on my bike rides.

58:31.551 --> 58:40.854
This is all like JC on a Bike 2020, where I'm still calling coronavirus part of the flu, or the flu of coronavirus is what I did.

58:42.234 --> 58:48.696
And so anyway, we get down here, and there's these things where it says to subscribe, they're kind of,

58:50.708 --> 58:53.010
They're kind of dotted with shares and stuff.

58:53.030 --> 58:57.112
So a lot of times you might stop thinking that it's over, but it's not, it keeps going.

58:57.653 --> 59:00.415
Would we recognize a novel coronavirus if we see it?

59:01.355 --> 59:06.239
So they're kind of novel and RNA viruses persist as a swarm.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.821
That's interesting, of course.

59:09.861 --> 59:18.007
We could talk about infectious and non-infectious particles, but remember, I was shown this, but I chose not to help because it was just really,

59:20.416 --> 59:27.659
It was just a mainstream distillation of virology with some objections to the idea of a pandemic having happened, I think.

59:27.879 --> 59:32.861
And so I just kept reading and I wasn't too happy.

59:33.382 --> 59:37.063
You know, the fear and cleavage sites are not really that rare.

59:37.083 --> 59:45.447
I don't know if that's the right statement to make, because again, we're using an awful lot of words and an awful lot of citations to say that RNA can't do it.

59:46.711 --> 59:54.160
And I thought that after all the conversations that I had with these people, that they kind of understood that my take was that R&D can't do it.

59:54.200 --> 01:00:03.410
So if we're going to write a review like this, you'd want to write a review where you started with farewell to virology, for example, is not a completely ridiculous document.

01:00:04.662 --> 01:00:11.405
And the objection to AIDS and the fidelity of understanding that we have of AIDS was not a ridiculous stance to take.

01:00:11.465 --> 01:00:17.448
But instead, they started with, you know, it seems like pages of basic virology is this.

01:00:18.189 --> 01:00:20.450
And we accept most of it, if not all of it.

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:24.792
We just want to agree on the nuances so that we can then argue.

01:00:25.192 --> 01:00:28.694
So we conclude spikes on coronaviruses are nothing special.

01:00:29.682 --> 01:00:33.886
Spike proteins are similar and common to proteins in other viruses, including influenza.

01:00:34.427 --> 01:00:43.235
Furin cleavage sites are common, but the vast majority of the 248 identified have not been studied anywhere nearly as closely as SARS-CoV-2.

01:00:43.836 --> 01:00:45.397
That's a cool point to make.

01:00:45.998 --> 01:00:50.662
ACE2 receptors are used by one other coronavirus, and that is not considered deadly.

01:00:50.702 --> 01:00:51.023
I don't know.

01:00:52.142 --> 01:01:00.584
Okay, arguments that unusual inserts must be manmade might be contradicted by parallel evolution or co-evolution between viruses in the swarm.

01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:05.745
So the inserts might not mean that it's a laboratory.

01:01:05.785 --> 01:01:07.306
So that's an interesting statement.

01:01:07.346 --> 01:01:20.809
So hence we see no reason to believe that the spike protein or the furin cleavage site should be a source of special or unique concern, even though unusual inserts that supposedly make the virus remarkable may be indeed unremarkable.

01:01:21.963 --> 01:01:30.105
given it appears much more likely, if not certainty, that other viruses might contain the same features by co-evolution between viruses.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:46.950
So that's a pretty advanced stance on the existence of a viral swarm in the background and its components from two guys that admit that themselves, that they didn't know anything about virology until they finally sat down and decided to write this one.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:58.429
So, the novelty of the fear and cleavage site, the diffuse proposal is mentioned interesting NAS is mentioned here pre print.

01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:01.576
I guess that's a Merrill-Nass substack.

01:02:01.616 --> 01:02:03.198
Let me get my brain out of the way for a second.

01:02:03.238 --> 01:02:04.519
Yep, Merrill-Nass substack.

01:02:04.559 --> 01:02:09.142
A new study reports 309 lab-acquired infections in the past.

01:02:09.462 --> 01:02:10.203
Okay, that's it.

01:02:10.323 --> 01:02:10.563
Nice.

01:02:11.784 --> 01:02:13.966
So, there have been lab leaks.

01:02:14.006 --> 01:02:20.130
The proposal for the diffuse, I've already told you that that's just a planted document to make it seem like, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

01:02:20.891 --> 01:02:21.692
They were doing it.

01:02:21.752 --> 01:02:22.252
They did it.

01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:25.555
And got me to say in Bobby's book that, yeah,

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:34.680
In neuroscience, you usually submit a grant with the data all done, or at least you have to have representative data for every experiment that you plan to do.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:41.324
So it wouldn't be unreasonable that some of these people, if this was a real grant proposal, that they would have done some of the experiments.

01:02:42.485 --> 01:02:45.627
That's what they really needed me to say in the book.

01:02:47.691 --> 01:03:08.084
And that's the only thing that, the only reason why Charles Rixey came to my house was to get me to do a stream with him about the DEFUSE proposal and allow me to assert my insight from my unique academic academician position that I would know that, yeah, well, when we submit grants, we have all these experiments done.

01:03:08.525 --> 01:03:16.290
So certainly if the DEFUSE proposal says they were inserting fear and cleavage sites and spraying them into bat caves, then certainly they've already done it.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:31.415
And I think that my family would be set up with a nice farm and comfort by now if I'd have just accepted that role.

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:45.545
And instead I'm out in the boondocks renting a house and nobody wants to acknowledge me because I'm so erratic in my critique of people.

01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:48.372
And so we're still here.

01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:52.615
Gain of function, is engineering more lethal viruses possible?

01:03:53.776 --> 01:03:55.937
Hence it looks like these fingerprints are not unique.

01:03:56.538 --> 01:04:02.562
The challenge of enter engineering, so that Wu estimates the cost of creating gain of function virus by comparing the endeavor.

01:04:02.582 --> 01:04:07.185
So it's a lot of questions I don't think we need to ask, but we're definitely asking them.

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:16.212
On the implications of serial passage, which again is part of the graphic that I've been saying for two years now is just this illusion just because you,

01:04:16.832 --> 01:04:25.755
you transfect a cell culture and then can show that cytotoxic effects can be transferred through the supernatant doesn't mean that you're doing virology.

01:04:26.155 --> 01:04:29.476
And yet somehow or another in four and a half years, we can't get there.

01:04:30.636 --> 01:04:37.099
And the I mean, I was quoting the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists on my bicycle at JC on a bike.

01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:38.179
Come on.

01:04:39.735 --> 01:04:41.616
That's what I found so frustrating about it.

01:04:41.656 --> 01:04:43.796
I couldn't believe what I was reading here.

01:04:43.816 --> 01:04:48.638
And then they're asking me to, to pitch in or help out, or maybe you can contribute something.

01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:58.561
Is there actually any evidence that a viable virus has ever been engineered to match some pre-prepared functional specification and which could cause a pandemic?

01:04:59.421 --> 01:05:02.442
What a, what an incredibly complicated question.

01:05:04.065 --> 01:05:10.551
An earlier controversy in 2014 surrounded gain of function with bird flu here and here and here.

01:05:13.674 --> 01:05:17.658
Given loss of function experiments, removal of features virus are commonplace.

01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:20.100
What's the message?

01:05:22.022 --> 01:05:23.423
The summary was again what?

01:05:29.562 --> 01:05:33.464
Novel viruses is a function of how determined we are to able to find them.

01:05:33.504 --> 01:05:42.650
The more we look, the more we find, suggesting that the attribution of novelty to a virus is as much a result of a politicized process rather than something based on objective analysis.

01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:08.130
The features of SARS-CoV-2 do not appear to be as special or unique as claimed.

01:06:15.894 --> 01:06:25.340
There is no good evidence that the many and complex hurdles in front of the deliberately engineering viruses to become more pathogenic or transmissible in humans have ever been overcome.

01:06:35.939 --> 01:06:46.726
The theory that there was a longstanding but here hitherto undetected virus endemic in animal reservoirs is difficult if not impossible to falsify.

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:56.333
Is that saying that they don't have any evidence of whether there was a background signal or not?

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:05.294
Is that just because these two guys are English and so they have to say it as complicated as possible like Brett Weinstein attempts to do all the time?

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:19.584
The theory that there was a long standing but hitherto undetected virus endemic in animal and possibly human reservoirs is difficult if not possible to falsify.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.194
I know this guy who says it a lot simpler.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:37.983
I know this guy that I follow on Twitter that I could share his stream that says it a lot simpler.

01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:43.612
But instead, I'm gonna write this substack and get pissed at that guy for not sharing it.

01:07:46.616 --> 01:07:54.703
There are other explanations which could explain the sudden and rapid global appearance and spread of a specific sequence than the spread of a novel virus.

01:07:55.463 --> 01:08:05.051
The available virology and epidemiology evidence does not adequately support either the lab leak or the wet market theories for the origin of the virus.

01:08:09.474 --> 01:08:14.939
We therefore suggest it would be more apt to refer to claim of function than gain of function research.

01:08:18.456 --> 01:08:20.917
Does this look like a ladder out of the cave to you?

01:08:22.177 --> 01:08:24.417
Does it sound like a ladder out of the cave to you?

01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:27.278
Does it read like a ladder out of the cave to you?

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:33.520
Can you understand why I didn't want to help them fix this document?

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:46.023
Can you understand why I find it very disturbing that they won't just correct their co-chair of heart and say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, at least call it claim of function.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.962
No Jay, don't attack these people.

01:08:52.022 --> 01:08:54.043
Look, think of it like panning for gold.

01:08:55.224 --> 01:08:58.846
If these people are really gold, a little panning ain't going to hurt anybody.

01:08:59.406 --> 01:09:03.789
You're going to swirl around in the bowl, but you're going to remain at the bottom and the rocks will go out.

01:09:08.592 --> 01:09:09.553
I just want to see.

01:09:10.693 --> 01:09:14.916
I just want to understand why it is that when I shake the bowl, they go out so easy.

01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:33.746
why they can't say there wasn't evidence of a novel virus, why they can't say that virology might be standing on shaky ground, that they can't say as a doctor and a pathologist that the whole vaccine schedule might be sketch, but actually say it's okay.

01:09:34.406 --> 01:09:35.508
It's okay for you.

01:09:40.287 --> 01:09:42.590
It's okay, you can believe there was a virus.

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:44.833
You can believe that virus killed people.

01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:46.796
You can believe gain of function played a role.

01:09:46.836 --> 01:09:50.701
In fact, it's all easier when a virus is spreading too.

01:09:51.081 --> 01:09:57.730
What that last line should be, Claire, just to correct it for you, is that it's easier if you believe there's a virus spreading.

01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:01.333
It's easier for the national security state.

01:10:01.393 --> 01:10:03.515
It's easier for them to enslave our children.

01:10:03.555 --> 01:10:13.943
If you believe that viruses, you know, an RNA molecule coated in a lipid protein coat can go around the earth sustainably like a little clock for five years.

01:10:13.983 --> 01:10:22.430
And then we can get 15 million separate estimates of its genome at any given time over those five years, because we have a whole database of them.

01:10:23.471 --> 01:10:25.292
It's not challenging any of these

01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:34.309
these wonderfully ridiculous mythologies that these people claim behind the scenes to be, ah, we listen to you, man.

01:10:34.649 --> 01:10:36.871
Here, this is the third time you presented at Panda.

01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:39.273
We share your work all the time.

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.995
So I'm not, there's nothing in the summary that really looks like it's going to save anybody.

01:10:49.055 --> 01:10:54.276
We saw viral swarms and then we got down here, spike proteins and fear and cleavage sites.

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:58.957
They make fun of it, but not really because you know, it's a, it's a cleavage site.

01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:01.117
It's four amino acids.

01:11:01.237 --> 01:11:03.197
It's, it's four bases sometimes.

01:11:03.237 --> 01:11:05.958
Like what, sorry, it's four amino acids.

01:11:05.978 --> 01:11:06.998
So it's like 20 bases.

01:11:07.038 --> 01:11:08.098
Like, what are you talking about?

01:11:10.459 --> 01:11:10.879
What's this?

01:11:10.979 --> 01:11:11.299
Rose.

01:11:14.864 --> 01:11:16.385
Jessica Rose sub stack.

01:11:17.505 --> 01:11:18.645
I mean, what's this one?

01:11:20.086 --> 01:11:21.286
That's the bio archive.

01:11:21.326 --> 01:11:26.068
That's the, that's the, um, that's the AIDS, AIDS inserts.

01:11:28.148 --> 01:11:32.630
So we conclude that Corona viruses are nothing special, fear and cleavage sites, blah, blah, blah.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.391
So we got lots of conclusions still.

01:11:35.931 --> 01:11:38.752
Not, not nothing that sounds like a ladder to get out.

01:11:38.852 --> 01:11:39.472
So here we go.

01:11:39.492 --> 01:11:40.893
We're on Fauchier and the,

01:11:41.912 --> 01:11:51.159
more fear and cleavage sites, gain of function, enriching in ferrets, mathematics, it's called the curse of dimensionality.

01:11:51.259 --> 01:11:53.661
Oh my gosh, let's ask some more questions.

01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:55.702
RNA viruses are mutation machines.

01:11:56.563 --> 01:12:00.686
So then why not just say that RNA can't go around the world the way that they say it did?

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.148
You can be succinct about it, right?

01:12:03.228 --> 01:12:08.772
Non-monotonicity, any phenotype that cannot be directly matched to a specific,

01:12:09.372 --> 01:12:38.575
genotype hence the problem is not reducible and there's no exist no algorithm can feasibly search the space of possibilities so they might be lying they might not be lying they might be lying about how they're lying oh my gosh does this look like a way out should i try to make it more simple do you think cloned wild type SARS-CoV-2 produced variants gain of function enhancements by blah blah blah studies use such a small sample size no ferrets from either experiments showed fever

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.589
So they're kind of suggesting that maybe something's weird.

01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:45.874
Transgenic mice, still going.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:48.457
You could leave a comment.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.681
Let's turn to animal reservoirs.

01:12:52.563 --> 01:12:55.346
You know, there's been like four different ways for you to click out of reading.

01:12:56.268 --> 01:12:57.049
We're still going.

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.743
Dutch mink farms, sequencing it in mink farms.

01:13:02.324 --> 01:13:08.330
So they're trying to decide whether it's a background signal or not, or they're trying to decide whether it was there before.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.094
We're citing homes, we're citing all these people that we know are just liars.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:17.018
And we're not really being very

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.322
let's say critical of any of these things.

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:23.485
We're just taking them at face value because these guys aren't virologists.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.408
They did all this reading to write this sub stack.

01:13:26.808 --> 01:13:33.514
And now it's getting promoted in the UK media as a groundbreaking review of virology and the pandemic.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:43.844
Really, I regret not being a part of it because then my name would be everywhere, you know, and that's what I ultimately want.

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:53.601
So critical limitation, phylogenetic analysis, assumption that there's no recombination.

01:13:53.621 --> 01:13:58.184
Oh my gosh, they're arguing about the phylogenetic analysis and the assumptions made there.

01:13:58.844 --> 01:13:59.905
We are really far.

01:13:59.965 --> 01:14:00.906
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:01.106 --> 01:14:08.011
Ray, gain of function is routine and involves creating infectious, quote unquote, question mark, sorry, clones.

01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:08.672
Hmm.

01:14:10.233 --> 01:14:16.217
Interestingly, a 2014 Millet and Whitaker paper ruminates on the potential for research on the furin cleavage site.

01:14:16.237 --> 01:14:16.878
Oh gosh.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:28.144
and the gain of function there, modulated two protease cleavage sites by coronavirus from profound impact, furin cleavage site, furin cleavage site, resulting infectious clones.

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:33.826
First paper describes the engineering of full-length cDNA clone from SARS.

01:14:33.906 --> 01:14:38.168
A cDNA clone contains the entire viral genetic information necessary for replication

01:14:38.928 --> 01:14:45.113
Transcription and translation, to put it in another way, they have the potential to be infectious just like the original they clone.

01:14:45.133 --> 01:14:51.238
They use the recovery of infectious viruses been used for the generation of a large collection of deletion mutants.

01:14:51.498 --> 01:14:53.740
The deletion mutant is a genetic anomaly.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:15:00.365
Let's look at finding zoonosis, ability to recover pathogens, synthetic DNA.

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:02.754
Yes, yes, yes.

01:15:02.874 --> 01:15:06.456
Clearly, this is clearly gated function research.

01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:08.877
No, it's recombinant DNA.

01:15:10.438 --> 01:15:12.199
And recombinant DNA is then what?

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:14.420
Applied to a cell culture.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.821
Can you see my arrow?

01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:20.443
A cell culture and in mice, and that's called infection.

01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:32.816
I mean, you can see that right here, and I've been trying to explain that to these people in particular for many months behind the scenes.

01:15:33.516 --> 01:15:41.579
We tried to start writing about it twice, including once that was supposed to be some kind of response to Kevin McKernan that they just ignored.

01:15:42.679 --> 01:15:48.241
But I worked pretty hard on it, annotating papers, explaining my idea, and then after all that work,

01:15:49.793 --> 01:16:02.625
They seem to not really understand what a clone is yet because they are now insisting that this is clearly gain-of-function research and was published 12 years before SARS-CoV-2.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.988
This is also gain-of-function research.

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:12.754
So it seems to me that Martin and Jonathan aren't being very consistent.

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:16.157
Shouldn't they call this claim-of-function research if they're trying to make a point?

01:16:20.563 --> 01:16:22.344
And so gain-of-function is ongoing.

01:16:23.385 --> 01:16:25.266
Implicitly no different from gain-of-function.

01:16:25.286 --> 01:16:26.487
Gain-of-function is ongoing.

01:16:26.527 --> 01:16:29.329
Also there should be obvious cloning viruses is straightforward.

01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:32.851
It should be obvious that cloning viruses is straightforward.

01:16:32.871 --> 01:16:39.816
They've never really explained what cloning viruses means because they're not dissecting it any farther.

01:16:40.779 --> 01:17:04.408
They're kind of talking about it, but what a clone is, is taking that DNA and either converting it to RNA with an enzymatic process and then transfecting a cell culture and taking the supernatant as virology, or taking that cDNA and directly transforming by electroporation or something like that, the cell culture, and then taking the supernatant and calling that virology.

01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:08.910
Maybe you do a few passages before you call the supernatant virology.

01:17:10.322 --> 01:17:16.327
And I've explained that to them before in many different ways, in Panda even, in my Panda presentation.

01:17:16.807 --> 01:17:28.977
So it would be almost impossible for me to understand that it's because I didn't help them with this, that they couldn't get it better than not saying anything about clones that's useful.

01:17:29.998 --> 01:17:32.160
So here's masters in Perlman.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.521
That's also just, right?

01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:34.742
That's just virology.

01:17:35.362 --> 01:17:39.646
So it appears to be the case that like the diffuse proposal, gain of function research,

01:17:40.805 --> 01:17:42.526
was and is still routine.

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.088
But I thought it's claim of function research.

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.749
So wait, so how did it arise?

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:49.930
Wet market or lab leak?

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:55.667
Okay, so the zoonotic event, we're doing a very thorough thing here.

01:17:55.707 --> 01:18:03.451
Here's Rancor's thing and also Engler's thing and some other guy and then we have pre-existing T-cell immunity and who are they citing there.

01:18:04.031 --> 01:18:16.377
Sanity Unleashed, even though I gave supposedly the best presentation on immunology that Dr. Wiseman had ever seen when I presented the first time at Panda.

01:18:16.997 --> 01:18:25.060
That was his actual comment when he was asked to, or was allowed to speak after my first presentation at Panda.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.861
He said, that was the best immunology lecture I've ever seen in my life.

01:18:32.102 --> 01:18:34.663
And, uh, I guess that that's cool.

01:18:34.823 --> 01:18:35.683
You know, that's cool.

01:18:35.903 --> 01:18:39.524
But anyway, um, it's, it's fine.

01:18:39.945 --> 01:18:43.486
I'm not, I want you to see that if they would just get the ideas, right.

01:18:43.506 --> 01:18:44.126
I wouldn't care.

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.880
but now pre-existing endemicity.

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.641
What is that?

01:18:48.721 --> 01:18:50.781
That's a pre-existing background.

01:18:54.162 --> 01:19:01.023
Imagine stealing a march on the science and discovering a coronavirus already endemic in humans, but not in bats or camels.

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:07.825
You keep this secret because you realize this is an exploitable opportunity if you can successfully pull off the bait and switch.

01:19:07.845 --> 01:19:08.925
What do you mean successfully?

01:19:09.935 --> 01:19:13.878
Why make it so complicated that it's in humans and not in bats and camels?

01:19:14.378 --> 01:19:24.645
Why not just make it a background signal that's everywhere that you can pretend is only in humans or pretend is only in bats and camels and that jumps from them to us?

01:19:27.527 --> 01:19:31.690
Is it really that these two guys are so clever

01:19:32.776 --> 01:19:39.938
that they can't distill the lie down to the most easiest, most parsimonious, simplest lie to tell.

01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:47.521
It doesn't have to be a specific discovery of a specific coronavirus that's endemic and we gotta be quiet about it.

01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:55.983
Before anybody else discovers it, we gotta pull the bait and switch and make sure that somebody knows that this coronavirus is actually spreading, but it's not.

01:19:56.923 --> 01:20:01.765
Hopefully nobody will discover that it was always a background signal, a very specific one,

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.581
that's in humans but not in bats and camels.

01:20:10.062 --> 01:20:12.163
It's much simpler than that, guys.

01:20:13.963 --> 01:20:23.947
The background signal for a PCR test just has to be a background signal of any and all RNA and DNA that can be present.

01:20:24.007 --> 01:20:26.908
Just cast your imagination as wide as you want.

01:20:27.408 --> 01:20:31.109
Maybe you need, you guys should back up a little bit

01:20:32.546 --> 01:20:51.706
Maybe Martin Neal and Jonathan Engler should back up a little bit and watch a few presentations or a TED Talk by Nathan Wolfe, where he will explain the plethora of available background signals in DNA and RNA that it's just waiting for metagenomic sequence to pull a new life form out of.

01:20:54.522 --> 01:21:14.993
It would be very unfortunate if you worked so hard on this review but had no idea how Nathan Wolf had represented metagenomic sequencing as the technology that would allow AI and computer machine learning to extract the genetic details out of the background of what he calls black

01:21:17.082 --> 01:21:18.944
black life or something like that.

01:21:19.004 --> 01:21:34.356
Black, I don't remember what it was, but he described it as an almost endless background of DNA and RNA that he was going to mine for heretofore undiscovered life forms that included viruses and other pathogens.

01:21:35.711 --> 01:21:48.177
And if you listen to that TED Talk, what you realize is, is that if every living being in the world is shedding RNA and DNA signals all the time, from plants to fungi to bacteria to mammals to birds to reptiles,

01:21:49.178 --> 01:22:01.150
and that this stuff is floating around in the air everywhere all the time, then creating a false positive on that background would be very, very simple for a group of people that wanted to enslave us on that mythology.

01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:11.000
And you don't need to imagine stealing a march on the science and discovering a coronavirus that's already endemic and accept all of the basic principles of virology

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:22.191
that there are things called coronaviruses and they are endemic and there could be another one is already accepting 90% of virology that the pandemic is based on.

01:22:22.931 --> 01:22:25.133
And so it's not a useful ladder to get out.

01:22:26.415 --> 01:22:30.639
It's a stupid, complicated ladder that doesn't go out of the cave at all.

01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:31.660
It's like circular.

01:22:35.464 --> 01:22:39.986
All that would be needed to do would be to create a test for the virus so that it can now be discovered.

01:22:40.406 --> 01:22:49.630
So in their illustration of what they say they understand and are paying attention to, in their understanding of it, there are viruses.

01:22:49.710 --> 01:23:00.554
It's just that they found a special one and then kept it secret long enough to misconstrue it as when we get the test right, we'll roll it out, and then we'll be testing for the virus, but little do they know it's already there.

01:23:06.758 --> 01:23:10.520
Oh, here's something else besides pre-existing endemicity.

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.841
Intentional spread of non-infectious clones.

01:23:16.902 --> 01:23:17.282
Oh boy.

01:23:18.763 --> 01:23:28.047
So if we set aside pre-existing endemicity, which is the worst case scenario that Garrett agreed about in the CNN video in 2018, and that Brett Weinstein

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:36.533
And Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone all agreed was the thing that we had to worry about.

01:23:36.654 --> 01:23:39.736
And Brett Weinstein was sure that zero COVID was achievable.

01:23:40.597 --> 01:23:49.666
And Steve Kirsch was sure that if we just force drugged everybody with ivermectin and silicoxib for six months that we would reach zero COVID.

01:23:50.066 --> 01:23:53.129
And Robert Malone was the other side of that limited spectrum of debate.

01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:56.953
And he was pretty sure it was already out and it was already gonna go endemic.

01:23:58.226 --> 01:24:02.487
So let's set aside the pre-existing endemicity idea.

01:24:04.368 --> 01:24:10.969
And then all's required is some functional amendments to existing localized viruses from a bat, say, either known or newly discovered.

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:17.211
Because it is from a bat gain-of-function design of a human version would be impossible.

01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:20.332
Hence, deadliness and transmissibility could not be designed in.

01:24:22.492 --> 01:24:27.934
It wouldn't go viral because it isn't infectious and could not cause a pandemic.

01:24:29.568 --> 01:24:44.078
However, you could clone it so it contains novel and deadly-looking features, but you don't care what its functional features are apart from that it because the symptoms will be non-differentiable from other respiratory viruses.

01:24:45.319 --> 01:24:50.023
You would then simply need to distribute these clones artificially to make it look like a virus that spreads.

01:24:50.203 --> 01:24:57.308
Also, despite not being any more deadly than other coronaviruses, it might still poison people and cause some morbidity.

01:24:58.513 --> 01:25:05.155
Then you would invent a vaccine and create a test designed to detect the DNA associated with the virus.

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:10.596
This, in summary form, is the hypothesis of J.J.

01:25:10.776 --> 01:25:11.216
Cooey.

01:25:12.116 --> 01:25:17.957
We understand this hypothesis is partly inspired by the video lecture by James Giordano.

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.227
Where are the numbers?

01:25:52.327 --> 01:25:59.916
Substack is cited, and I guess gigaohm biological is cited, and then James Giordano, and then James Giordano again, I guess.

01:26:00.436 --> 01:26:01.577
Where is this numbers?

01:26:02.438 --> 01:26:03.059
Substack.

01:26:03.099 --> 01:26:05.302
So he keeps citing himself most of the time.

01:26:07.682 --> 01:26:35.189
Acknowledging the operational difficulty involved in continually manufacturing and distributing viral clones, in respect of JJ's thesis, clones may only have been needed to deploy in hotspots in 2020 to trigger a fake pandemic and then subsequent positive SARS-CoV-2 cases from then on, where a combination of PCR tests cross-reacting with other viruses to cause false positives and natural endemic SARS-2 virus circulating at low background rates.

01:26:39.221 --> 01:26:40.041
Oh, my God.

01:26:54.429 --> 01:26:56.250
Let's listen to what he says at this.

01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.631
These are the people that were in the Corman-Drewiston report.

01:27:00.432 --> 01:27:07.095
It's Peter Borger, who's a Nederlander, Bobby Rehesh-Muraltara, Mike Eden, Claire Craig,

01:27:08.547 --> 01:27:11.753
Kevin McKernan, Klaus Steger, I don't know any of those people.

01:27:12.334 --> 01:27:13.396
Thomas Binder I know.

01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:17.322
I also know Ulrich O'Connor.

01:27:20.922 --> 01:27:35.777
Ulrich Kammer was a collaborator from Germany that sent some transfected cells to Kevin McKernan for analysis of whether the DNA incorporates into the genome of some of these cancer cell lines or not.

01:27:36.398 --> 01:27:41.082
Mike Eden, you know, Claire Craig is the person from

01:27:43.769 --> 01:27:49.372
the person from heart that I was calling out here with this statement.

01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:52.914
This is from her tweet over here.

01:27:54.975 --> 01:28:05.941
And I think at this stage, it's important for them to make sure that they don't say things like this because it is important that our children don't grow up believing in gain of function.

01:28:06.001 --> 01:28:08.322
It is important that they don't grow up

01:28:09.935 --> 01:28:13.137
not aware that the first and foremost, it was murder.

01:28:13.678 --> 01:28:20.182
And it disturbs me a lot that somebody who's in the UK where a lot of murder happened, isn't speaking out about it.

01:28:22.023 --> 01:28:38.154
I don't even really wanna mention again, but just to make sure that you see what I see, it's strange to me that this biography includes the 100,000 Genomes Project, and it includes her working on AI cancer diagnostics.

01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:44.494
It just doesn't feel right, even if it is right and okay.

01:28:44.954 --> 01:28:56.964
And this guy is retrained as a lawyer, so he worked as a medical doctor before moving into the pharmaceutical industry and running a company where he did clinical trials, which sounds a lot like

01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:04.412
Sasha Latapova, actually, who worked for the pharmaceutical industry or sold a company to them.

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:13.055
And then years later, he and a colleague sold the business and using a business using automation to streamline clinical trials.

01:29:13.095 --> 01:29:17.596
It's very similar to the kind of thing that Sasha Latapova was involved in.

01:29:17.636 --> 01:29:18.917
And then he retrained as a lawyer.

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:30.098
And now he's co-chair of this and he's also on the executive committee of Panda And so let's see what he testifies In this witness statement.

01:29:30.118 --> 01:29:41.207
This witness statement was published on June 7th 2024 so that's just four days ago and I'm interested to see if he will get to the stage where you know after

01:29:42.068 --> 01:29:48.312
I mean, I've got pages of him communicating with me via direct message on Twitter.

01:29:48.392 --> 01:29:54.616
So apparently he knows what I'm saying, even if he says that, you know, nobody can watch a two hour stream.

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:58.918
I have a feeling, you know, they've seen me present three times at Panda.

01:29:58.959 --> 01:30:00.920
I have a feeling they've watched my stream before.

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:07.084
And so I'm curious as to whether we'll get close to any of these statements in this video or not.

01:30:07.124 --> 01:30:08.925
I'm not holding out any hope.

01:30:09.945 --> 01:30:20.652
But I'm curious as to whether we'll get close to any of these statements or anything like this I'm also really curious as to whether or not Actually took that out.

01:30:20.813 --> 01:30:21.373
That's funny.

01:30:21.433 --> 01:30:31.860
I don't even have that in here anymore if they will if he will have any kind of description of the list of ways that people were injured or murdered

01:30:32.395 --> 01:30:39.840
during the pandemic that had nothing to do with the alleged spreading novel pathogen.

01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:41.982
So I'm curious as to what he says here.

01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:48.667
Remember that I'll preface it by saying that this video is going to have like pre-staged questions apparently.

01:30:49.127 --> 01:30:50.888
And so he's responding to those questions.

01:30:50.948 --> 01:30:55.511
And so he's partially, let's say, boxed in by the questions that he's supposed to answer.

01:30:55.571 --> 01:30:58.514
That could be by his design or their design or whatever.

01:30:58.574 --> 01:31:01.516
But the bottom line is that this group

01:31:02.176 --> 01:31:19.706
that's giving us this is this people's vaccine inquiry he's on the board right so we can assume i guess that he had some say in the questions that he's answering otherwise if he didn't want to answer these questions and he wanted to answer different questions like was there a pandemic or did people lie or

01:31:20.246 --> 01:31:29.130
were people murdered, he could have those questions be the questions that were asked, or Claire Craig could have those questions asked, but instead they've chose to ask these questions.

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:37.354
And remember, it's June 7th, 2024, so maybe it would be time to ask some pretty serious questions, but let's see what we do.

01:31:47.031 --> 01:31:48.912
My name is Dr Jonathan Engler.

01:31:49.392 --> 01:31:57.256
I am the co-chair of the Heart Group along with Claire Craig and I also sit on the exec committee of an international group of scientists called PANDA.

01:31:57.396 --> 01:32:04.160
I started off life in clinical medicine, worked as a doctor for a few years before moving into the pharmaceutical industry.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:11.683
I had a job as a medical advisor designing, analysing and reporting on clinical trials to regulatory standards.

01:32:12.103 --> 01:32:20.127
My colleague at that company and I, we set up a company involved in clinical trial management, which we sold after a decade.

01:32:20.632 --> 01:32:27.803
following which I actually retrained and became a barrister a short period of time before re-entering the business world in the healthcare sector.

01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:36.776
Since 2020 though, I've been heavily involved in analysing and reporting on the response of governments to what they call the COVID pandemic.

01:32:42.213 --> 01:32:43.674
Everybody's being betrayed, basically.

01:32:43.794 --> 01:32:47.115
You can look at the whole thing as a tragedy in three acts of betrayal.

01:32:47.155 --> 01:32:55.298
I mean, clinical trial participants have been betrayed, the public has been betrayed by the regulators, and then the injured are being betrayed by the system.

01:32:55.418 --> 01:32:57.279
The trial participants have been betrayed.

01:32:57.299 --> 01:33:02.361
They went into these trials ostensibly to help other people, and in many cases they've been abandoned.

01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:03.702
To take one example,

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:07.544
An American preschool teacher, she was 41, Breanne Dressen.

01:33:07.784 --> 01:33:15.789
On the day she had the AstraZeneca vaccine, in the trial, she became doubly incontinent and yet her symptoms were dismissed as anxiety related.

01:33:16.409 --> 01:33:20.952
And so what was the question again and how could he have maybe alternately answered it?

01:33:20.992 --> 01:33:21.793
Let's see it again.

01:33:21.893 --> 01:33:23.013
I don't know where I go.

01:33:23.113 --> 01:33:23.453
I can't.

01:33:23.534 --> 01:33:25.074
I wish it had a little preview frame.

01:33:25.134 --> 01:33:25.795
I apologize.

01:33:27.039 --> 01:33:32.605
We set up a company involved in clinical trial management, which we sold after a decade.

01:33:33.586 --> 01:33:37.009
I don't have much control over the video with this platform, so I apologize.

01:33:37.069 --> 01:33:37.870
I can't click through.

01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:40.673
I just want to pause on this question.

01:33:40.713 --> 01:33:42.014
I just want to pause on the question.

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:56.132
How would you summarize the rollout of the COVID vaccines?

01:33:56.312 --> 01:34:03.075
Well, I would summarize it as they murdered people and got people to agree that it was either a lab leak or a natural virus.

01:34:03.715 --> 01:34:11.579
And that mystery solving exercise scared enough people into taking COVID vaccines that they never would have otherwise taken.

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:14.840
That's what I would have said.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.882
I would have said they murdered people and lied about it.

01:34:19.011 --> 01:34:27.075
so that people would be terrified enough to take the COVID vaccines, which are actually transfections and transformations and should have been called that from the beginning.

01:34:29.016 --> 01:34:31.177
Remember these people talk to me behind the scenes.

01:34:31.197 --> 01:34:33.919
They send me DMS to tell me to lay off of their friends.

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:36.520
So it's not like they're not paying attention.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:45.685
They don't, they get the idea of what I'm trying to get people to say, because I think it will be much more effective because those, those things, those ideas, they lead out of the cave.

01:34:48.578 --> 01:34:50.880
How would you summarize the rollout of vaccines?

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.562
They murdered people and lied about it so people would be scared enough to take them.

01:34:55.283 --> 01:34:56.604
That's how I would summarize it.

01:35:01.602 --> 01:35:03.043
Everybody's being betrayed, basically.

01:35:03.183 --> 01:35:06.504
You can look at the whole thing as a tragedy in three acts of betrayal.

01:35:06.544 --> 01:35:14.687
I mean, clinical trial participants have been betrayed, the public has been betrayed by the regulators, and then the injured are being betrayed by the system.

01:35:14.807 --> 01:35:16.668
The trial participants have been betrayed.

01:35:16.748 --> 01:35:21.749
They went into these trials ostensibly to help other people, and in many cases they've been abandoned.

01:35:21.929 --> 01:35:23.090
To take one example,

01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:26.934
An American preschool teacher, she was 41, Breanne Dressen.

01:35:27.174 --> 01:35:35.183
On the day she had the AstraZeneca vaccine, in the trial, she became doubly incontinent, and yet her symptoms were dismissed as anxiety-related.

01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:41.850
AstraZeneca, they're meant to follow up these patients long-term, but basically they stopped contacting her after about 60 days.

01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:44.914
During that period, she was actually fighting for her life in hospital.

01:35:45.234 --> 01:35:52.225
In June 21, she was actually diagnosed with neurological injury following the vaccine and she remains sick to this day.

01:35:52.385 --> 01:35:54.228
There are just numerous stories like this.

01:35:54.389 --> 01:36:00.178
The actual trial designs themselves used to register these products were deeply flawed in many ways.

01:36:04.165 --> 01:36:05.446
Whoa, so what?

01:36:05.846 --> 01:36:15.192
There's a whole list of problems with the... June 21, she was actually diagnosed with neurological injury following the vaccine, and she remains sick to this day.

01:36:15.372 --> 01:36:17.213
There are just numerous stories like this.

01:36:17.374 --> 01:36:23.177
The actual trial designs themselves used to register these products were deeply flawed in many ways.

01:36:24.198 --> 01:36:29.982
Okay, so he says that the... Let me just switch over here.

01:36:31.567 --> 01:36:34.970
So he says the rollout of the vaccines is the first question.

01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:36.932
He says the trial participants are betrayed.

01:36:36.972 --> 01:36:38.353
The regulators betrayed us.

01:36:43.077 --> 01:36:44.978
And so, yeah, okay.

01:36:44.998 --> 01:36:51.083
So then the next question is what was wrong with the vaccine rollout?

01:36:51.144 --> 01:36:52.525
So that's an interesting question.

01:36:52.565 --> 01:36:53.486
It's kind of related.

01:36:54.987 --> 01:36:56.228
It's kind of related to the first one.

01:36:56.248 --> 01:36:57.829
What was wrong with the vaccine rollout?

01:36:57.869 --> 01:36:59.611
It was rolled out on the idea

01:37:00.788 --> 01:37:08.873
that people in the UK were dying because of coronavirus and that we had to roll out this vaccine so that people wouldn't die.

01:37:10.214 --> 01:37:19.260
But people in the UK were being killed by starvation, by untreated urinary tract infections, through cold and through thirst.

01:37:20.256 --> 01:37:22.537
and through secondary pneumonia is not being changed.

01:37:22.557 --> 01:37:25.738
There's videos, there's whole documentaries about it.

01:37:25.818 --> 01:37:33.602
So what's wrong with the vaccine rollout, again, comes back to they murdered people and got people to agree that murder wasn't happening.

01:37:34.622 --> 01:37:49.088
That maybe we were responding wrong, or maybe we were making some mistakes, or maybe we didn't know what to do, but nobody seems to have yet come to the conclusion at heart that first and foremost, they murdered people and lied about it, which is strange.

01:37:50.265 --> 01:37:52.146
because they definitely did that in the UK.

01:37:57.649 --> 01:38:00.791
There's a whole list of problems with the clinical trials.

01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:03.573
These examples are specific to the Pfizer trial.

01:38:03.733 --> 01:38:08.856
We call it the Pfizer trial, although it's actually a product made by a company called BioNTech, which is a German company.

01:38:09.076 --> 01:38:13.839
Everybody just knows it's a Pfizer trial because it was manufactured and sold under license by Pfizer.

01:38:13.919 --> 01:38:15.740
But the product is actually BioNTech's.

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:19.543
So although these issues apply to that particular drug, there are

01:38:20.283 --> 01:38:23.547
overlapping issues, many of them are the same, with all the vaccines.

01:38:23.808 --> 01:38:25.510
The trial wasn't actually double-blind.

01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:31.897
A lot of people say that the Pfizer phase 3 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, but it wasn't at all.

01:38:32.158 --> 01:38:36.322
It was actually what they call observer-blinded, so that everybody at the site knew.

01:38:36.983 --> 01:38:44.967
So again, just to hat tip to Pamela, Pamela says maybe he should have started with the fact that what's wrong with the vaccine rollout?

01:38:44.987 --> 01:38:50.369
Well, they rolled it out as a vaccine and they should have rolled it out as a transfection and transformation.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:58.072
They should have been honest so that people could exercise informed consent, which includes saying no, but did he start there?

01:38:58.092 --> 01:38:59.013
No, no, no.

01:39:00.555 --> 01:39:01.495
No, no, no.

01:39:01.816 --> 01:39:06.020
We don't want to use correct language when referring to transfection and transformation.

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:11.785
We'll accept the fact that these are vaccines, and we'll just argue about whether they work or not.

01:39:13.086 --> 01:39:13.627
Darn it.

01:39:14.247 --> 01:39:15.949
This is very disappointing already.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.030
Shit.

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:22.109
overlapping issues, many of them are the same, with all the vaccines.

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:24.090
The trial wasn't actually double-blind.

01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:30.475
A lot of people say that the Pfizer phase 3 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, but it wasn't at all.

01:39:30.735 --> 01:39:34.899
It was actually what they call observer-blinded, so that everybody at the site knew

01:39:35.299 --> 01:39:59.503
which drug each patient was receiving because the way it was designed was they had to draw up the vaccine from the vial and they were told when they entered the patient they received I mean imagine using this much time to explain why the trials might not have been the perfect trials when we don't need the trials anyway the whole justification for the trials is a great big charade darn it

01:40:00.731 --> 01:40:01.992
What is going on here?

01:40:02.092 --> 01:40:05.193
Why can't any of these people make any reasonable progress?

01:40:05.794 --> 01:40:06.514
Give an instruction.

01:40:06.554 --> 01:40:10.276
I'll give this patient active and give this patient placebo and that was what was drawn up.

01:40:10.456 --> 01:40:17.620
And it's got quite profound implications that the site know which patient is on which drug because it creates bias.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:20.582
So when the patient comes along and says I've got some symptoms,

01:40:21.062 --> 01:40:33.475
whether or not that person is going to be sent for testing because they potentially got the target disease, in this case COVID or not, will be influenced by the knowledge of whether or not the patient received the active or placebo.

01:40:33.655 --> 01:40:35.937
And the same is true for the assessment of any

01:40:36.938 --> 01:40:39.540
adverse events, whether they're related to the drug or not.

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:46.004
It could be highly biased by whether or not the site know which drug the patient is receiving.

01:40:46.484 --> 01:40:51.587
You have to look at what the trial was actually measuring, what the so-called clinical endpoint was.

01:40:51.927 --> 01:40:58.672
So his message is that it's very complicated to understand whether or not a clinical trial was good or not.

01:40:59.485 --> 01:41:00.286
That's his message.

01:41:00.366 --> 01:41:02.247
So, you know, it's, it's tough to know.

01:41:02.267 --> 01:41:04.569
And there's really difficult in there.

01:41:04.649 --> 01:41:05.910
It's pretty specialized.

01:41:06.370 --> 01:41:08.952
And, you know, I had a company for 10 years that I sold.

01:41:09.012 --> 01:41:12.495
And so I can tell you how specialized it is and how complicated it is.

01:41:15.452 --> 01:41:16.453
There's no ladder here.

01:41:16.933 --> 01:41:17.914
There's no ladder here.

01:41:18.874 --> 01:41:24.858
And in this trial, basically they were saying the clinical endpoint was a symptom of infection and a positive test.

01:41:24.918 --> 01:41:28.120
The question really is, what is the relevance of that in the real world?

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:33.563
So what if people get a positive test for something and some mild symptoms?

01:41:33.583 --> 01:41:39.007
You've got to remember in the trial, virtually everybody who was said to be a COVID case basically had a cold.

01:41:39.327 --> 01:41:42.669
It seems remarkable to me that nobody has questioned the

01:41:43.029 --> 01:41:57.979
extrapolation of that claim, which is that it reduces basically cold-like symptoms, to this is going to protect everybody from transmitting a disease and it's going to protect the elderly and vulnerable from harm and so therefore we need to inject everybody as soon as possible.

01:41:58.239 --> 01:42:01.481
It seems to me completely crazy that the extrapolation was made.

01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:09.205
Another point about the way the trial results have been interpreted is this issue of relative and absolute risk reduction.

01:42:09.445 --> 01:42:12.967
The headline figure of 95% reduction is incredibly misleading.

01:42:13.832 --> 01:42:20.658
It's based on 162 cases in the placebo group versus 8 in the active group.

01:42:20.838 --> 01:42:23.380
Indeed, that is a 95% reduction.

01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:28.205
But what that doesn't tell you is what the actual risk reduction for an individual was.

01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:33.649
You've got to bear in mind that that 162 is out of over 20,000 participants in each group.

01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:37.833
So the actual risk to an individual was less than 1%.

01:42:39.054 --> 01:42:41.036
And it reduced it from a little less than 1%.

01:42:41.676 --> 01:42:52.971
You see why it's so annoying that in their essay they can't succinctly explain that a background signal misconstrued as spread using two or three hundred different random

01:42:56.311 --> 01:43:00.212
products produced in China and elsewhere would be so easy.

01:43:00.752 --> 01:43:17.417
But instead, if you accept most of the principles of virology, most of the complications of virology, and try to work with those tools, you inevitably find yourself down a stupid, complicated explanation for something that can be very easily explained by coordinated lying.

01:43:21.425 --> 01:43:33.527
It is just shocking to me right now that we are here in 2024 and we still have people outside of the United States who are pretending to come to the rescue that are actually not doing it.

01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:46.230
We are each in our own traps because we are each trapped in our own

01:43:47.791 --> 01:44:06.774
System our own government our own set of laws and our own set of courts Americans must save America and English people have to save the UK or whatever however you call each other and Dutch people have to save Holland Germans have to save Germany

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:14.040
There's nothing I can do or say beyond the biological truths that can extricate you people.

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:24.091
And so talking about the clinical trials and the details of them just leaves you open for endless debate about whether or not this guy's right about those particular things.

01:44:25.834 --> 01:44:42.178
Instead of saying the very simple and sort of irreducible questions that get right to the heart of this, something like, is intramuscular injection of any combination of substance useful in augmenting the immune system?

01:44:42.218 --> 01:44:44.078
Do we need to ask that question or not?

01:44:47.319 --> 01:44:51.560
Was transfection known by really thousands of people already?

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.400
Is Jay right about that or not?

01:44:54.753 --> 01:44:58.635
I mean, is it possible that he's right that RNA can't pandemic?

01:45:01.637 --> 01:45:09.841
Do you think that that distillation of my idea as represented in their essay is genuine?

01:45:09.961 --> 01:45:11.202
That was their best attempt.

01:45:12.962 --> 01:45:19.686
And now that I'm saying it out loud, of course, they're going to say, we gave him every opportunity to edit the document and he didn't do it.

01:45:21.721 --> 01:45:22.241
It's coming.

01:45:22.862 --> 01:45:24.642
That's the only play they have here.

01:45:25.483 --> 01:45:32.026
They can't backpedal and say, oh yeah, we should have corrected Claire Craig earlier, but she's our friend and we didn't.

01:45:32.426 --> 01:45:40.751
They can't say that, well, I meant to say that they murdered people and lied about it, but that wasn't the question that was asked.

01:45:41.031 --> 01:45:48.635
There's nowhere to go anymore other than to burn the bridge with Jay and say that we gave him the opportunity three times to write with us and he just didn't do it.

01:45:48.715 --> 01:45:51.196
So clearly he must be employed still.

01:45:52.469 --> 01:45:55.810
Maybe he's getting NIH funding like Kevin McKernan says he is.

01:46:03.232 --> 01:46:05.172
I just see patterns, ladies and gentlemen.

01:46:05.232 --> 01:46:08.733
If you think that I'm not seeing patterns, then I don't know.

01:46:08.873 --> 01:46:12.554
There's lots of other people that you can follow.

01:46:12.594 --> 01:46:15.094
There's lots of other people whose work needs sharing.

01:46:16.555 --> 01:46:17.115
So if you don't

01:46:18.168 --> 01:46:23.613
If you're not behind it, if it doesn't make sense to you, if it doesn't ring true, I really suggest to change the channel.

01:46:24.854 --> 01:46:26.255
Stop following my account.

01:46:27.716 --> 01:46:31.640
Because I'm convinced to my bones that this is the right way.

01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:36.584
I'm convinced to my bones that I'm helping people get out of this trap.

01:46:37.825 --> 01:46:40.087
By illustrating that these people are not.

01:46:41.809 --> 01:46:52.531
And if they end up correcting themselves, if they end up being the gold at the bottom of the pan after we've shaken it around, because they're like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, Jay.

01:46:52.571 --> 01:46:54.711
That's the reaction I expect from Nick Hudson.

01:46:55.331 --> 01:46:59.872
That's the reaction I've gotten from Nick Hudson before, where I've tried to call him out.

01:46:59.912 --> 01:47:01.553
He says, easy, man, come on now.

01:47:01.613 --> 01:47:02.913
Remember, we're all on the same team.

01:47:02.993 --> 01:47:05.333
I mean, I'm trying to share you too.

01:47:07.994 --> 01:47:09.174
And I get what you're saying.

01:47:10.973 --> 01:47:15.775
And Nick has corrected, as far as I can tell, course corrected, as far as I can tell, at least a little bit.

01:47:15.835 --> 01:47:18.017
And he has shared my work at least a little bit.

01:47:18.397 --> 01:47:28.102
But this hat tip in that essay and how they talked about non-infectious clones, whatever the hell those are, is just ridiculous.

01:47:30.843 --> 01:47:40.628
Apparently you did hours and hours of reading and didn't really learn anything because you didn't have the requisite biological background to organize a synthesis across everything you read.

01:47:42.574 --> 01:47:45.478
which has taken me like four and a half years to accomplish.

01:47:45.518 --> 01:47:47.822
But yeah, go ahead, put a couple of weeks in.

01:47:52.068 --> 01:47:53.511
So this co-chair of HEART,

01:47:54.753 --> 01:48:00.857
who doesn't want me to admonish Claire Craig because she's really nice and you know, there's lots of different views in heart.

01:48:01.058 --> 01:48:01.698
That's what he said.

01:48:01.738 --> 01:48:03.159
Lots of different views in heart.

01:48:03.679 --> 01:48:04.760
Take it easy on Claire.

01:48:05.421 --> 01:48:11.145
She's got 250,000 followers and she's saying bullshit and this guy won't correct it.

01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:12.206
He corrects me.

01:48:12.746 --> 01:48:14.047
He wants me to settle down.

01:48:14.387 --> 01:48:16.529
He wants me to stop my erratic attacking.

01:48:24.318 --> 01:48:26.639
So let's see here, what else has he got to say?

01:48:26.719 --> 01:48:28.760
What other questions will we ask?

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.801
Down to a little more than zero.

01:48:31.382 --> 01:48:43.688
When you say to somebody, well actually your risk was reduced by less than 1% of having a cold or flu-like symptoms, it starts to put into context how exaggerated the benefits from these products have been.

01:48:44.108 --> 01:48:50.113
A way that some people like to describe the benefits of drugs is in terms of a number needed to treat.

01:48:50.253 --> 01:49:01.162
So you can say that for these products, you would need to treat just over 100 people to reduce the number of people who get cold-like symptoms with a positive PCR test by one.

01:49:01.562 --> 01:49:02.583
And when you put it like that,

01:49:03.363 --> 01:49:07.246
doesn't sound anywhere near as impressive as saying these products are 95% effective.

01:49:07.626 --> 01:49:14.370
But I should also point out that it's long been assumed to be bad practice to only refer to relative risk reduction, i.e.

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:19.694
the 95% number, without giving people a sense of what the absolute benefits to them might be.

01:49:21.675 --> 01:49:24.677
How did the media sway opinion during the vaccine rollout?

01:49:25.316 --> 01:49:33.960
I think the media was incredibly important, both in terms of pushing the government messaging and also suppressing any reporting of any adverse effects.

01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:43.945
Whenever anybody died in... Reporting any adverse effects, so we're really not going to say that they murdered people and lied about it in the UK, are we?

01:49:45.566 --> 01:49:46.706
He's really not going to say it.

01:49:49.027 --> 01:49:50.608
They didn't murder people in Scotland.

01:49:50.728 --> 01:49:52.409
They didn't murder people in old folks' homes.

01:49:52.429 --> 01:49:53.990
They didn't let people die of cold.

01:49:54.935 --> 01:49:56.516
or starvation or water.

01:49:57.437 --> 01:49:59.499
All those people must have been lying in that movie.

01:50:01.801 --> 01:50:02.362
Wow.

01:50:05.942 --> 01:50:09.444
In 2020, if they had a positive test, they died of COVID.

01:50:09.645 --> 01:50:13.187
Even if they fell off a ladder or in a car accident, these were COVID deaths.

01:50:13.207 --> 01:50:15.849
Well, how can somebody falling off a ladder be a COVID death?

01:50:15.889 --> 01:50:18.511
Somebody say, oh, well, you don't know, maybe it affected their brain.

01:50:18.751 --> 01:50:26.056
And yet when it came to deaths being reported after the vaccine, the media would strain to find other explanations.

01:50:26.076 --> 01:50:28.417
So it would say, oh, you never heard of anybody dying suddenly before?

01:50:28.437 --> 01:50:30.499
You never heard of anybody getting myocarditis before?

01:50:30.519 --> 01:50:35.482
You know, every single death after the vaccine would be assumed to be something else.

01:50:35.982 --> 01:50:47.021
and there would be an incredibly high standard of proof needed to convince anybody it was related to the vaccine and that was completely the opposite policy to the 2020 policy of attribution of death to COVID.

01:50:52.549 --> 01:51:00.310
This is the first time in history that an infectious disease has been diagnosed by one single molecular test in this way.

01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:16.813
Throughout history, doctors have been taught to treat symptoms and to assess the patient as a whole and see how ill or unwell they are, what their signs and symptoms are, and that the test results from the lab are basically an adjunct to a proper clinical assessment of a patient.

01:51:17.033 --> 01:51:20.454
During the COVID era, basically, if you had a positive test,

01:51:20.894 --> 01:51:23.657
you were a COVID case, even if you had no symptoms.

01:51:23.737 --> 01:51:29.442
In fact, it was said once that having no symptoms was a symptom of COVID, which is peak insanity in my view.

01:51:35.108 --> 01:51:38.491
We shouldn't necessarily trust the data, take it at face value.

01:51:38.571 --> 01:51:44.777
There are quite a lot of red flags in respect of the trial data, the PCR tests, which can be easy.

01:51:50.089 --> 01:51:52.231
It's very insufficient, that's for sure.

01:51:54.093 --> 01:52:04.904
And doesn't seem to reflect his understanding of virology as in that article where at least he knows there's something in the back.

01:52:05.504 --> 01:52:06.165
Oh my gosh.

01:52:07.066 --> 01:52:11.790
Sorry, I'm getting a little burpy from my coffee, but I just, I don't know what to say anymore.

01:52:16.536 --> 01:52:25.103
He's able on Twitter to regularly hammer people because they're talking about the virus and arguing about the virus and believing in gain of function.

01:52:25.123 --> 01:52:27.866
He's able to ridicule them and make fun of them.

01:52:28.366 --> 01:52:33.471
But that's what the whole project is based on, is this idea that

01:52:34.403 --> 01:52:41.106
we pretty much agree that the Scooby-Doo mystery is solved and that the answer is gain of function was spreading around the world.

01:52:41.607 --> 01:52:57.495
And so if you go on Twitter and your primary thing is to make fun of people that do that, or one of the things you do, then your overarching message isn't this thing where the trial participants were betrayed or the regulators betrayed us.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.161
The first cause is not that.

01:53:04.661 --> 01:53:07.122
The first cause is not the FDA in America.

01:53:08.662 --> 01:53:11.123
The first cause is not Tony Fauci.

01:53:18.585 --> 01:53:24.226
It's so bizarre that they won't challenge the fundamentals of this whole thing.

01:53:26.627 --> 01:53:30.468
It's so bizarre because they know that's exactly what I'm trying to do.

01:53:31.724 --> 01:53:42.227
And instead, we have the forced elevation of yet another new set of actors that supposedly has a groundbreaking take on virology that

01:53:44.047 --> 01:53:51.111
17 pages in, gives an absolutely shitty hat tip to ideas that I've never said out loud ever.

01:53:51.171 --> 01:54:02.877
You can't find one time when I've ever explained it as non-infectious clones being used to do something that a regular circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the background as well.

01:54:07.619 --> 01:54:10.721
And they were actually trying to say, hey, we gave a hat tip to you.

01:54:17.961 --> 01:54:18.442
Dang it.

01:54:20.643 --> 01:54:21.985
I just, I don't believe them.

01:54:22.045 --> 01:54:22.525
I'm sorry.

01:54:22.565 --> 01:54:23.666
I don't believe it at all.

01:54:23.806 --> 01:54:25.448
I think that this is meddling.

01:54:25.488 --> 01:54:36.537
I think it's a sign of meddling because again, they are, they are elevated to where they shouldn't be for being what they've done and what they've brought to the table.

01:54:37.598 --> 01:54:40.421
It's not the dream team that's rising on the internet.

01:54:40.441 --> 01:54:44.965
It's not the dream team that's getting published in the conservative UK woman.

01:54:49.628 --> 01:54:58.712
It's a coordinated Lollapalooza of liars that is elevating certain ideas and agreeing not to really understand other ideas.

01:54:59.173 --> 01:55:11.218
Their description of my infectious clones idea is about as weak as when Kevin McKernan tried to go like, oh, so are you saying that you're gonna spray the RNA around then?

01:55:11.659 --> 01:55:13.319
Or what exactly were you saying?

01:55:13.359 --> 01:55:16.201
Or were you saying that you were gonna convert the DNA into

01:55:16.901 --> 01:55:19.543
RNA using like a T5 RNA polymerase.

01:55:19.623 --> 01:55:20.864
What was it that you were saying?

01:55:28.408 --> 01:55:32.051
We're still not really hearing a clear message here that's going to save people, are we?

01:55:32.972 --> 01:55:41.780
...easily manipulated by changing the so-called cycle threshold, which is the amount of replication of the genetic material before it calls the test as positive.

01:55:42.441 --> 01:55:51.610
Now it's so annoying because I've explained to him and others, including Martin Neal and the rest of Panda, that the cycle count thing is a hamster wheel.

01:55:53.231 --> 01:55:57.155
If there's a background signal, you can design a PCR test to pull it up.

01:55:59.324 --> 01:56:01.085
Nobody's sequencing the primers.

01:56:01.145 --> 01:56:02.645
The primers are produced somewhere.

01:56:02.685 --> 01:56:06.166
You know, all of this stuff could just be controlled.

01:56:07.306 --> 01:56:08.927
You just make the primers you want.

01:56:08.967 --> 01:56:11.107
You substitute them for the primers they think they are.

01:56:11.147 --> 01:56:14.248
You tell them it's a test for the end protein, but it's really not.

01:56:14.288 --> 01:56:18.269
It's for this background signal that's everywhere in a certain number of people, yada, yada, yada.

01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:24.671
The details don't matter because it would be so trivial to do.

01:56:26.363 --> 01:56:30.005
As long as you start with synthetic RNA or DNA, you can put it wherever you want.

01:56:30.385 --> 01:56:31.926
It's very easy to explain.

01:56:35.047 --> 01:56:55.058
And yet somehow or another, we, in 2024, with Jonathan Engler, who claims to follow my work and claims to be part of Heart and Panda and have seen me present three times and tried to get me to write this article with him, doesn't seem to be able to explain that virology is pretty much based on synthetic

01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:09.571
DNA or RNA transfected or transformed into these cell cultures and the fidelity of this PCR test could easily be faked using the same synthetic or DNA or RNA wherever you wanted to find it.

01:57:10.131 --> 01:57:11.492
You don't have to spray it.

01:57:12.053 --> 01:57:14.655
It doesn't have to be in the people in Italy.

01:57:14.695 --> 01:57:16.156
It could be on the swabs.

01:57:16.656 --> 01:57:21.060
If you're sending all the swabs to a central location, it could be on the computer.

01:57:22.389 --> 01:57:27.693
where the computer that is analyzing the data from the test could be falsifying it.

01:57:29.694 --> 01:57:36.600
The possibilities are endless that don't have to involve you discovered a new virus that only exists in humans, but not in camels.

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:42.204
And then you end around the science and claim that what you're detecting is actually not there, but spreading.

01:57:42.684 --> 01:57:43.725
Holy shit.

01:57:48.063 --> 01:57:50.606
Let's see if he's going to say anything useful in this 24 minutes.

01:58:03.562 --> 01:58:17.696
And even if there was a 95% reduction in the number of cold-like symptoms plus a positive test, it's worth pointing out that the analysis being focused purely on COVID misses any what we call off-target effects.

01:58:17.936 --> 01:58:25.824
So it's no good reducing the incidence of your target disease if you then increase the incidence of other things.

01:58:26.064 --> 01:58:26.685
And that's why

01:58:27.065 --> 01:58:31.931
In general terms, regulators have in the past said, well, what we want to do is we want all cause mortality.

01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:39.260
So he has to be aware of the fact that one of the ways that it was probably done in the UK is that they just took these old people and said, oh, yeah, he got COVID.

01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.723
We better put you on supplementary oxygen.

01:58:46.369 --> 01:58:57.578
And ever since we, through Grace's dad, discovered this anomaly and have tried to get people to ask that question, none of them do it.

01:58:59.319 --> 01:58:59.780
None of them.

01:59:01.261 --> 01:59:03.623
None of them, N-O-N-E.

01:59:04.043 --> 01:59:04.764
Just me and Mark.

01:59:07.426 --> 01:59:09.968
It's significant, because he's not doing it here.

01:59:10.008 --> 01:59:10.748
He could say it here.

01:59:10.809 --> 01:59:12.570
We saw it in that UK documentary.

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:16.861
And we made the world aware of it.

01:59:17.081 --> 01:59:18.782
So, I mean, they know.

01:59:19.543 --> 01:59:20.264
Everybody knows.

01:59:20.324 --> 01:59:21.384
All these MDs know.

01:59:21.444 --> 01:59:23.626
He's an MD and a lawyer, so he knows.

01:59:25.167 --> 01:59:36.816
You know, Malik puts people under for knee surgery or foot surgery, but he's not aware that pure oxygen given for a few hours might be particularly nasty.

01:59:39.092 --> 02:00:00.591
analyses and all-cause symptom analyses and on an all-cause basis these products fail to reduce mortality for example so the active versus placebo analysis is tending towards actually increased mortality in the active vaccinated group compared to the placebo group and that obviously is completely the opposite of what people think that they're getting from these products.

02:00:04.312 --> 02:00:05.152
He already said that.

02:00:05.172 --> 02:00:06.373
That was his first answer.

02:00:06.393 --> 02:00:11.334
I want to start off by the example of Stephen Wright, staff member at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

02:00:11.594 --> 02:00:13.375
So it's again about the regulators.

02:00:13.415 --> 02:00:14.875
Did the regulators do their job?

02:00:14.915 --> 02:00:19.217
What about the people that killed people during the pandemic with protocols?

02:00:20.566 --> 02:00:24.110
I know that he writes substacks about it, but this video is what's gonna get around.

02:00:24.150 --> 02:00:30.997
This video is what's got the support of this whole group of people that's got this whole new website.

02:00:31.438 --> 02:00:34.221
His substack doesn't have that, his videos have that.

02:00:34.701 --> 02:00:35.963
The heart group has that.

02:00:41.004 --> 02:00:42.944
And so this video is what's getting seen.

02:00:43.005 --> 02:00:44.845
This video is what's being circulated.

02:00:44.905 --> 02:00:48.666
So this was his chance to say what needed to be said.

02:00:48.726 --> 02:00:53.947
And yet this group apparently has chosen these questions as being the questions to ask.

02:00:54.387 --> 02:00:55.928
Did the regulators let us down?

02:00:58.428 --> 02:01:08.611
Did a coordinated group of traders in America coordinate with people in the rest of the Five Eyes countries to act like there was a dangerous pandemic and get us to fail?

02:01:10.544 --> 02:01:12.409
Any question, you know, like, come on.

02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.991
Wow.

02:01:13.172 --> 02:01:13.613
Wow.

02:01:13.773 --> 02:01:14.214
Wow.

02:01:14.355 --> 02:01:14.756
Wow.

02:01:14.856 --> 02:01:15.237
Wow.

02:01:16.099 --> 02:01:16.661
Just wow.

02:01:18.619 --> 02:01:21.520
and so he was first in the queue to get his vaccine in January 21.

02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:35.323
Unfortunately, he suffered from a catastrophic brain hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia, which is low platelet counts, and he left a widow and two fatherless sons, a huge tragedy.

02:01:35.503 --> 02:01:39.304
It took a long time, though, for the MHRA to take proper action.

02:01:39.544 --> 02:01:46.586
In November of 21, the MHRA... This is a distress signal.

02:01:47.881 --> 02:01:51.024
Hanging the flag upside down is like calling for help.

02:01:54.167 --> 02:01:55.168
It's not an insult.

02:01:56.789 --> 02:01:59.752
It's not a America needs to fall.

02:01:59.852 --> 02:02:01.093
It's America needs help.

02:02:01.974 --> 02:02:08.420
And if all you got is an American flag to signal with, the way to signal to another American that you need help is that.

02:02:12.263 --> 02:02:12.784
We need help.

02:02:14.147 --> 02:02:22.652
acknowledged that there have been over 70 fatalities with the same condition in the first 10 months of use, which works out actually at about one every four days.

02:02:23.253 --> 02:02:27.855
In April, they had estimated the incidence of the condition to be four per million.

02:02:28.216 --> 02:02:32.738
And by February 22, they were then saying it was actually 15 per million.

02:02:32.878 --> 02:02:38.742
But even at that point, they were saying that we need to investigate this further, decide if it's related to the vaccine.

02:02:39.222 --> 02:02:40.344
That was in February 22.

02:02:40.785 --> 02:02:51.000
Meanwhile, winding back in time, it's astonishing to note that in March 21, which is a year before just about, the Danish regulators had already suspended use of the vaccine.

02:02:51.633 --> 02:02:56.115
and already described the relationship between the vaccine and the condition as causal.

02:02:57.195 --> 02:03:00.016
So it's interesting because he's friends with Jessica Hockett.

02:03:00.036 --> 02:03:17.362
He could say that there's somebody in America that does research and she's pretty convinced that the initial event that was misconstrued as the start of a giant global crisis that worst case scenario could kill a billion people, she's kind of convinced that that's a fraud.

02:03:20.711 --> 02:03:22.932
I wonder if he's ever going to throw that in here yet.

02:03:23.913 --> 02:03:28.896
I mean, that would be a pretty significant data set to go back to or data point to go back to.

02:03:28.956 --> 02:03:31.538
And still he's only going back to 2021.

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:37.901
It's curious because they rolled out the shots to healthcare workers in the UK at the end of 2020.

02:03:40.358 --> 02:03:45.362
end of 2020, they already had the healthcare workers so scared that they were going to take the shot.

02:03:45.402 --> 02:03:50.886
Remember there was that one doctor man that like told the prime minister, I ain't going to take this thing.

02:03:50.926 --> 02:03:56.470
I've already been infected because I've on the frontline and it kind of made a very inconvenient video.

02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:59.192
So again, there are choices being made here.

02:03:59.232 --> 02:04:08.339
And remember that the choices that are being made here are partially being made by him and Claire Craig, because they are heads of the heart group and also heads of this

02:04:08.959 --> 02:04:10.741
Looks like people's vaccine inquiry.

02:04:10.781 --> 02:04:14.064
So if he wanted to ask different questions to himself, he could have.

02:04:16.346 --> 02:04:18.668
And these are the questions that they're choosing to answer.

02:04:18.868 --> 02:04:20.770
And it's June 7th, 2024.

02:04:21.491 --> 02:04:26.996
Quote, they said, nothing but the vaccine can explain why these individuals have had this immune response.

02:04:27.456 --> 02:04:33.702
So our regulator has been way behind the curve in investigating potential safety concerns with these products.

02:04:41.431 --> 02:04:47.033
They did, and there were many deaths from this condition between the time.

02:04:50.635 --> 02:05:08.682
Are you saying that rather than pausing the rollout, pausing the rollout, which is the exact language that I used in May of 2021, when I finally published my review that I now call the Scooby-Doo review on my website, where I said we needed to pause all transfections

02:05:11.365 --> 02:05:16.247
rather than pausing the rollout and investigating signals in the data, they continued to roll out the vaccine.

02:05:16.267 --> 02:05:24.671
Well, technically not because we pulled off the J&J shot and we pulled out the AstraZeneca shot and continued with the mRNA.

02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:34.436
So this isn't even really an adequate account of what happened and what normal skilled TV watchers will have perceived as happening.

02:05:35.615 --> 02:05:44.990
So if he doesn't say, well, you know, they made the gesture of taking the J&J shot off the market, which tricked people into believing that there was some kind of regulation going on.

02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:46.813
I'm curious as to what he's gonna say.

02:05:52.403 --> 02:05:52.743
They did.

02:05:53.063 --> 02:06:03.670
And there were many deaths from this condition between the time when, for example, the Danish regulator had suspended it and the time when the UK regulator suspended it.

02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:08.073
Well, actually, and I say suspended because it's never actually officially suspended.

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:11.395
Of course, the AstraZeneca vaccine, they just stopped giving it.

02:06:11.635 --> 02:06:16.719
So it was never officially taken off the list, which I think is a notable point in itself.

02:06:20.714 --> 02:06:23.196
What other shortcomings have there been from the regulator?

02:06:23.236 --> 02:06:26.019
Wow, we're asking a lot of really important questions here.

02:06:26.239 --> 02:06:27.661
They would have been aware of all those.

02:06:27.781 --> 02:06:28.461
Holy crap.

02:06:28.481 --> 02:06:31.184
It's pretty scandalous that they never dug into any of those issues.

02:06:31.284 --> 02:06:35.428
The by distribution is basically how distributed throughout the body a drug becomes.

02:06:35.828 --> 02:06:44.737
And at all times, the regulators and our government have basically told people, don't worry, the injection gets broken down in the arm and it has no systemic effects.

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:55.002
But of course, this is completely nonsensical because the actual platform itself was developed to carry cancer drugs around the body to the target organs.

02:06:55.042 --> 02:06:57.543
And so it's designed to go through membranes.

02:06:57.784 --> 02:07:10.010
There was already preclinical data in rats, which shows that when this product is injected, and I'm here talking, by the way, about the mRNA product, when the product was injected, it becomes distributed around the whole body.

02:07:10.410 --> 02:07:23.918
The adverse events coming in to the yellow card system across a wide range of organ systems, including a huge number of cardiovascular events, is completely incompatible with anything other than distribution.

02:07:24.358 --> 02:07:31.562
So interesting that he's basically making the same point that Jessica Rose made, which is the yellow card system has a signal that it didn't have before.

02:07:32.263 --> 02:07:34.604
The bears has a signal that it didn't have before.

02:07:36.286 --> 02:07:41.409
essentially subconsciously programming you never to question that the old vaccines were better than these.

02:07:42.509 --> 02:07:45.871
Or maybe they weren't, but we have a signal now that we didn't have before.

02:07:51.194 --> 02:08:03.540
And it's curious because one of the people that he really enjoys promoting, Jessica Hockett, who I've lauded as a hero for pointing out the anomaly of New York City,

02:08:05.879 --> 02:08:11.362
She says that she doesn't think the mRNA shot is hurting anybody because she doesn't know anybody who was hurt by it.

02:08:11.782 --> 02:08:20.327
But here he is explaining that there is a very, very hot signal for the fact that these shots, these transfections and transformations hurt people.

02:08:20.847 --> 02:08:25.850
So I hope he's going to go out of his way to correct Jessica on that posit.

02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:32.374
I mean, Jessica was just a person that worked, I believe, in the school system in Chicago.

02:08:36.573 --> 02:08:46.901
Up until very recently, she has been focused on showing that the New York City story is just so ridiculous and how many different ways it can be seen as ridiculous.

02:08:46.941 --> 02:08:49.343
And so she's done a really great work with that.

02:08:49.483 --> 02:09:05.055
And so if she's straying off the foundation a little bit by just reporting her own observations that she doesn't know anybody that thinks they're hurt from the shot or reported to her that she's hurt from the shot, that could just be

02:09:06.428 --> 02:09:07.308
from her point of view.

02:09:09.449 --> 02:09:16.871
But at some point, I hope that like, I am trying desperately to get Jonathan to correct Claire Craig because they're co-chairs.

02:09:18.091 --> 02:09:30.255
I hope that I can get Jonathan to, you know, point out that, hey, there's this video and this testimony that I did, Jessica, and I'm pretty sure that these transformations and transfections have hurt lots of people and they're just lying about it.

02:09:32.688 --> 02:09:35.350
Because I don't think Jessica Hockett is convinced of that anymore.

02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:37.051
And so I don't really follow.

02:09:37.111 --> 02:09:40.733
I don't have enough time to keep track of all of these people.

02:09:40.813 --> 02:09:47.518
When I decide that they're doing pretty good, I tend to leave them alone and watch their patterns from afar.

02:09:48.138 --> 02:09:53.840
And so this was just brought to me because Jonathan said that I had to lay off Claire Craig.

02:09:53.860 --> 02:10:08.626
So I just wanted to explain to Jonathan why I don't think I or she or he should lay off Claire Craig if she's gonna say that it's okay for people to think of gain of function and think of that there's a virus and it's even better if there is a virus.

02:10:08.726 --> 02:10:16.869
I don't think that that's nuanced enough coming from such an organization with such a following internationally, we need to do better.

02:10:17.409 --> 02:10:18.469
That's what I'm suggesting.

02:10:23.331 --> 02:10:25.111
Throughout the body of the product.

02:10:25.251 --> 02:10:36.555
And of course, the fact that the product is distributed throughout the body, it has incredibly profound implications for what safety testing, what preclinical studies would need to be done for this product.

02:10:36.635 --> 02:10:45.738
So ordinarily a new drug, anything that might be, any target organ that might be affected by the product, you'd need specific studies to disprove

02:10:46.178 --> 02:10:48.140
the hypothesis that it might be harmful.

02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:57.667
And yet these products, because of the word vaccine was slapped over them, they were given a free pass from much of the normal preclinical studies that would be required.

02:10:57.968 --> 02:11:00.890
And I think that is a major, major scandal.

02:11:02.891 --> 02:11:04.753
Were there any biodistribution studies?

02:11:04.793 --> 02:11:07.095
Hat tip to Byron Bridle coming.

02:11:08.675 --> 02:11:14.679
There was a study done in rats, which the regulators would have been aware of, which showed widespread distribution.

02:11:14.999 --> 02:11:18.000
It actually was obtained through an action in the states.

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:20.202
You've probably heard the phrase, the Pfizer documents.

02:11:20.402 --> 02:11:33.289
And what's really meant by that is that there was a group of independent scientists and doctors in the states who wanted to see the information used by the FDA to form the basis of their approval of the product.

02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:43.424
Is this a accidental omission of the fact that the first person that was burned on biodistribution was Byron Bridle?

02:11:44.746 --> 02:11:46.609
That Byron Bridle got a

02:11:47.583 --> 02:12:00.751
a report from the Japanese government that showed the biodistribution and that when he started speaking out about it, the Canadian government shut him down at the exact same time was when Pierre Kory came on the Brett Weinstein show.

02:12:00.791 --> 02:12:13.960
And then three weeks later, here comes Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch on the Brett Weinstein podcast to talk about all kinds of things to do with the mRNA, but not that the biodistribution might be a little bit sketchy as the foremost measure.

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.262
It was more about, well, you know, we have three easy ways to end the pandemic was the title.

02:12:21.044 --> 02:12:25.747
This is a pretty big omission because Byron Bridle burnt his whole career.

02:12:27.248 --> 02:12:34.493
Because Byron Bridle is being absorbed by these people, which I showed Steve Kirsch and Kevin McKernan.

02:12:35.532 --> 02:12:42.294
trying desperately to make him feel like he is still fighting, that he is still being heard while they're really just stepping in front of him.

02:12:42.674 --> 02:12:50.575
And stepping in front of him so much that apparently Jonathan thinks that it was something to do with the Pfizer documents, which who was in charge of those?

02:12:51.075 --> 02:12:52.016
Naomi Wolf.

02:12:53.596 --> 02:13:01.798
Naomi Wolf had 2,300 researchers volunteering their time to go through the hundreds of thousands of pages of the Pfizer documents.

02:13:02.984 --> 02:13:07.627
Why would they need to do that when Byron Bridle already exposed it with a single document?

02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:12.971
Holy shit, this is a landslide.

02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:17.755
This is like everything's falling apart like a sandcastle during tide coming in.

02:13:25.162 --> 02:13:35.105
If you recall, this is going back a few years, the FDA wanted this to be buried for 75 years and it took action in court to prise this information out of the FDA.

02:13:35.325 --> 02:13:40.966
And one of the early documents that came out through that process was the report of the biodistribution in rats.

02:13:41.227 --> 02:13:44.387
And it's pretty clear that the regulators would have had sight of that.

02:13:44.467 --> 02:13:49.769
So at the time they were telling people that the product was broken down in the arm entirely and had no systemic effects.

02:13:50.209 --> 02:14:00.713
they would have known that it was being widely distributed in rats at least and that should raise the suspicion and the likelihood that the product would become widely distributed in humans too.

02:14:08.115 --> 02:14:09.415
What was flagged up by the biotech?

02:14:09.435 --> 02:14:14.117
Basically being distributed to every organ system but most worryingly to the

02:14:16.192 --> 02:14:20.075
What was flagged which would have required further investigation?

02:14:20.656 --> 02:14:34.507
Basically being distributed to every organ system but most worryingly to the ovaries and testes which obviously is a major concern particularly the way the product works is it makes the body's cells that take up the product

02:14:34.867 --> 02:14:39.969
It makes this foreign protein called spike protein, though it probably makes a lot of other proteins as well.

02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:47.672
And the body then reacts to the expression of those foreign proteins by attacking and destroying those cells, which it recognizes as foreign.

02:14:47.832 --> 02:14:54.675
This is why we are seeing a major problem with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as a result of these products.

02:14:56.516 --> 02:15:01.217
So I kind of have a problem with that a little bit, just because I feel like, OK, so if

02:15:04.355 --> 02:15:10.256
If we're gonna say that they biodistribute, but then say they're going to the ovaries and testes, that's being a little bit simplistic.

02:15:10.296 --> 02:15:12.157
They could be crossing the blood-brain barrier.

02:15:12.617 --> 02:15:21.278
They could be going to some people's lungs, into some people's fat, into some people's ovaries, into some people's appendix, some people's lymph nodes, some people's bone marrow.

02:15:21.958 --> 02:15:30.200
And so that was already a little bit of a hyper simplification of something that we knew would be just criminal.

02:15:31.533 --> 02:15:33.657
because of how little we actually understood about it.

02:15:33.677 --> 02:15:41.230
He kind of simplified the biodistribution to a couple places, which is not really how the biodistribution should be simplified.

02:15:43.393 --> 02:15:44.135
Just saying, man.

02:15:48.163 --> 02:15:49.064
Absolutely huge.

02:15:49.324 --> 02:15:51.565
Naming is everything, really, with new products.

02:15:51.665 --> 02:16:00.131
The word vaccine made people think that these were just like all the previous vaccines they had, maybe like the flu shots that many people have had for years.

02:16:00.351 --> 02:16:06.916
The word vaccine also meant that the regulators would allow the manufacturers to skip many steps.

02:16:06.956 --> 02:16:08.257
There is a lot of editing.

02:16:08.317 --> 02:16:14.761
I don't know if you are watching on a bigger screen, but I really feel like there are times when you can really see that this one was really bad.

02:16:14.821 --> 02:16:15.182
It was like,

02:16:16.089 --> 02:16:19.091
four clips in a row put together at the beginning there.

02:16:19.311 --> 02:16:21.673
At least it sure feels like there's a little fade in there.

02:16:24.855 --> 02:16:25.755
Absolutely huge.

02:16:26.015 --> 02:16:28.277
Naming is everything, really, with new products.

02:16:28.357 --> 02:16:36.902
The word vaccine made people think that these were just like the previous vaccines they had, maybe like the flu shots that many people have had for years.

02:16:37.063 --> 02:16:41.586
The word vaccine also meant that the regulators would allow the manufacturers

02:16:42.366 --> 02:16:46.508
to skip many steps which would ordinarily be required for any other drug.

02:16:46.548 --> 02:16:49.769
So there are lots of preclinical testing that wouldn't be required.

02:16:49.789 --> 02:16:51.610
That's simply because of the word vaccine.

02:16:51.770 --> 02:17:00.253
The point about the word vaccine is that it suggests something that is locally broken down and that only affects the immune system.

02:17:00.593 --> 02:17:11.678
But the fact is that both Moderna and Pfizer in their regulatory submissions for financial purposes that they have to make to the US Stock Exchange, they call these gene therapies, or they were certainly during

02:17:11.778 --> 02:17:15.159
But do you know what kind of technology does it like that?

02:17:15.219 --> 02:17:16.400
That's a lot of work.

02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:20.441
I mean, that's a lot of work unless there's some AI that does it.

02:17:20.481 --> 02:17:21.862
Maybe you have some AI that does it.

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:45.061
Did he say murder just now?

02:17:45.121 --> 02:17:46.182
I didn't hear him say murder.

02:17:46.222 --> 02:17:46.902
They cut it out?

02:17:49.164 --> 02:17:50.725
What do you mean they cut it out?

02:17:50.825 --> 02:17:51.666
What does that mean?

02:17:54.388 --> 02:17:55.549
What do you mean they cut it out?

02:17:55.589 --> 02:18:03.334
Are you suggesting that the organization is censoring their own leader or you're saying that they cut it out and you have the original video?

02:18:03.394 --> 02:18:03.995
I'm curious.

02:18:04.715 --> 02:18:06.757
If they cut it out, I'd like to see it.

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.121
He didn't say murder.

02:18:09.421 --> 02:18:28.292
When vaccines consisted of a relatively narrow number of technologies, many of which had been around for quite a few decades, it's completely scandalous that you take a brand new product that was developed to treat cancer, and you change the antigen you're expressing, but you have the same basic platform, and then you just change its name to vaccine, and suddenly it becomes functionally a vaccine.

02:18:28.992 --> 02:18:30.173
It's completely nonsensical.

02:18:31.774 --> 02:18:32.814
Okay, no problem.

02:18:32.834 --> 02:18:33.415
You can joke.

02:18:33.855 --> 02:18:34.735
I like jokes.

02:18:35.056 --> 02:18:35.356
It's good.

02:18:36.323 --> 02:18:37.924
Okay, process one, process two.

02:18:37.944 --> 02:18:44.686
When they talk about process one, they mean relatively small-scale manufacture and that's what they use to make the clinical trial material.

02:18:45.106 --> 02:18:54.229
Process two is a different type of manufacturing process altogether because you need to scale up and they use different technology and that's what was used to make the product.

02:18:54.409 --> 02:19:18.693
Now, if this does not reveal the fact that this person is a meddler to you already, I'm going to explain to you why this particular clip, which I hadn't seen until right now, is the definitive answer of whether this guy means well or is just talking to me behind the scenes to try and be able to influence me somehow into focusing on stuff that I don't need to focus on.

02:19:21.718 --> 02:19:30.086
Because what he's about to explain right now, process two should start out with, well, this is how they use synthetic DNA and RNA clones.

02:19:32.438 --> 02:19:35.919
to make any biologic in pharmaceutical companies.

02:19:35.979 --> 02:19:37.419
Remember, he's a pharmaceutical guy.

02:19:37.459 --> 02:19:44.900
He worked in pharmaceuticals and then he had a company for 10 years that he sold that was streamlining clinical trials.

02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.921
The guy knows how antibodies are made.

02:19:46.961 --> 02:19:48.861
He knows how all biologics are made.

02:19:49.241 --> 02:19:54.842
He knows what recombinant DNA is and how it's used to create the RNA of the shot.

02:19:54.882 --> 02:19:59.123
He knows that there's a video out there of Inovio circulating these

02:20:00.123 --> 02:20:04.186
brown liquids full of the bacteria that's growing the spike DNA.

02:20:04.887 --> 02:20:06.768
He knows exactly how it works.

02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:14.894
So is this a reasonable explanation for the difference between process one and process two?

02:20:15.315 --> 02:20:19.398
Or is this somebody who's meddling with us and not giving us a way out?

02:20:19.498 --> 02:20:24.882
Remember, he claims to listen to me and understand me and want everybody to know who Jay is.

02:20:25.342 --> 02:20:26.523
I share your things.

02:20:26.924 --> 02:20:28.565
I try hard to support you.

02:20:35.325 --> 02:20:42.186
When they talk about process 1, they mean relatively small-scale manufacturer, and that's what they use to make the clinical trial material.

02:20:42.586 --> 02:20:46.307
Process 2... Small-scale manufacturer, no details.

02:20:48.948 --> 02:20:59.010
Very simple details that anybody like Kevin McKernan could add here is that there's a limit to the synthetic DNA printing that we can do, which is what they do.

02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:00.090
It's essentially printing.

02:21:01.158 --> 02:21:03.961
We can do it, but there's a limit to how long we can print it.

02:21:04.001 --> 02:21:10.987
That's why we can make primers super cheap, but we can't make a whole coronavirus DNA construct super cheap.

02:21:11.047 --> 02:21:14.830
We have to make five parts of it, and then it's getting cheaper and cheaper every day.

02:21:16.552 --> 02:21:17.373
But there's a limit.

02:21:18.444 --> 02:21:25.527
to the length of DNA that we can make synthetically using these synthetic manufacturing techniques.

02:21:25.567 --> 02:21:40.394
But being a 10-year-plus experience in pharma and in clinical trials, then sold his company and decided to become a lawyer in his spare time, he's not able to get beyond process one is small-scale manufacturing.

02:21:46.749 --> 02:21:50.952
I'm going to go back a little bit to make sure you can hear the ridiculousness of this.

02:21:57.438 --> 02:22:04.283
When they talk about process one, they mean relatively small-scale manufacture, and that's what they use to make the clinical trial material.

02:22:04.704 --> 02:22:15.633
Process two is a different type of manufacturing process altogether, because you need to scale up, and they use different technology, and that's what was used to make the product that went into millions of arms.

02:22:16.213 --> 02:22:27.521
Normally, when you change a manufacturing system, the regulators require you to show that the product made by the changed system is identical to the product which you got your registration on.

02:22:28.101 --> 02:22:35.646
In this particular instance, the Process 2 product was actually only ever tested on 250 people in the original trial.

02:22:35.866 --> 02:22:41.530
So 250 out of the 20-odd thousand only received the Process 2 product.

02:22:42.048 --> 02:22:59.484
Now the regulators did require Pfizer to show that the product made in the bigger scaled up process was actually the same in all material regards, the same as the product made, which nearly all the patients received the process one product, but that data was never forthcoming.

02:22:59.744 --> 02:23:01.606
They never did any proper equivalent study.

02:23:01.806 --> 02:23:06.431
And so actually realize how incredible it is that

02:23:07.171 --> 02:23:30.229
even with Kevin McKernan out there saying there's double-stranded DNA and endotoxins that have contaminated the shot, he's actually explaining that the regulators didn't adequately evaluate the change from the Process 1 methodology that he doesn't have any useful details about to the Process 2 methodology, which his useful details include scaling up

02:23:33.863 --> 02:23:42.448
And he's explaining that the regulators should have better checked the equivalency between these two methodologies, these two general manufacturing practices.

02:23:44.949 --> 02:24:00.218
Maybe we're gonna get to the contamination, maybe, maybe, which would still be very much on narrative, but I just want you to see how awful that whole little alleyway of thinking was.

02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:05.693
that the process one and process two is not something that you need to biologically understand.

02:24:05.753 --> 02:24:08.375
Just understand that one small scale, one's big scale.

02:24:08.755 --> 02:24:11.937
And when you go from small scale to big scale, the regulator needs to check.

02:24:12.398 --> 02:24:13.979
And I don't think they checked very well.

02:24:19.122 --> 02:24:19.523
Okay.

02:24:19.563 --> 02:24:21.124
So what else is he going to say after this?

02:24:21.204 --> 02:24:24.066
Is it going to, is it going to, is he going to, is he going to,

02:24:25.219 --> 02:24:26.480
pull out of the nosedive or not.

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:34.426
In the end, the regulator just said we won't require them to show that anymore because we've now given billions of doses and we've proven it's safe.

02:24:34.886 --> 02:24:41.931
And of course, that is ridiculous because there is a phrase used particularly with what are termed biologics, i.e.

02:24:42.011 --> 02:24:44.353
products which work through complex biology.

02:24:44.473 --> 02:24:47.175
The phrase used is that the process is the product.

02:24:47.555 --> 02:24:51.917
and for them not to have shown that the process is equivalent is pretty scandalous.

02:24:51.957 --> 02:24:59.419
That's not to say that I think that the product made using process one was safe and effective, but it is evidence of more regulatory failure.

02:24:59.639 --> 02:25:07.502
And of course, since the products have been rolled out, a multitude of problems related to the complex biology of the manufacturing process have come to light.

02:25:07.982 --> 02:25:14.965
So the problems are in the complex biology of the manufacturing process, not the complex biology of everybody's immune system.

02:25:18.035 --> 02:25:35.289
For example, the issue of DNA contamination in the final product, which laboratories around the world are now finding, and this has obviously completely unknown biological effects.

02:25:42.642 --> 02:25:43.342
What was the question?

02:25:43.382 --> 02:25:43.923
I didn't see it.

02:25:43.943 --> 02:25:44.463
Sorry.

02:25:44.663 --> 02:25:52.507
And it's incorrect that they can't sue these manufacturers in the final product, which laboratories around the world are now finding.

02:25:52.787 --> 02:25:55.309
And this has obviously completely unknown biological effects.

02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:03.282
Can you comment on the failure to adequately compensate victims who have been damaged by these products?

02:26:03.302 --> 02:26:10.605
A lot of people say, and it's incorrect, that they can't sue these manufacturers, that the manufacturers have immunity from being sued.

02:26:10.685 --> 02:26:12.046
And that's actually not true.

02:26:12.606 --> 02:26:23.731
In the UK, the manufacturers have what's called an indemnity built into the contracts with the government, which means that people can still sue manufacturers, but the government pays the legal bills and pays any damages.

02:26:23.751 --> 02:26:26.472
So basically, as part of the contract, the government has agreed

02:26:26.952 --> 02:26:35.597
to indemnify the manufacturers and effectively hold them harmless for any harms caused by their products, which is extraordinary enough that that exists.

02:26:35.997 --> 02:26:41.380
But in terms of whether people can legally issue claims against manufacturers, yes they can.

02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:48.444
That's kind of where the good news ends, because the bad news is that these claims are very, very difficult to get off the ground.

02:26:49.104 --> 02:26:53.128
because solicitors, a lot of them are unwilling to enter the fray for political reasons.

02:26:53.148 --> 02:26:55.350
They'll be regarded as anti-vaxxers and so on.

02:26:55.530 --> 02:27:02.737
But more specifically, they know that the chances of success are quite low because the courts are generally against these kinds of claims.

02:27:03.138 --> 02:27:11.446
And because they know the chances... So what an interesting thing for this barrister to wax intellectual about when in America, it's a very specific lie.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:18.268
The idea is that you have the right to sue for anything over $20 in damages.

02:27:18.949 --> 02:27:20.491
And that's a constitutional right.

02:27:21.514 --> 02:27:38.209
And if you say that you can't sue these people because of the PREP Act or because of the 21st Century Cures Act or whichever one or combination of gives them the indemnity that allows the federal court to say, nah, the state court to say, nah, I can't see this trial because of this law or that law.

02:27:38.649 --> 02:27:42.793
It's interesting because again, these ideas are specific for each country.

02:27:43.453 --> 02:27:46.255
The trap that America is in is different than the UK.

02:27:46.675 --> 02:28:02.785
And yet somehow this barrister, who should be sophisticated enough to understand this, is both inadequately explaining that the UK is a unique situation, different from Canada, different from America, and trying to alert people of this difference.

02:28:03.446 --> 02:28:12.852
He's trying his best to make it seem as though we're all in the same basic trap that we're never going to get out of anyway, because these regulators are screwing us on both sides of the Atlantic.

02:28:16.169 --> 02:28:21.492
You're never going to hear a lawyer say that, essentially, this is like jurisdiction stripping.

02:28:25.934 --> 02:28:29.796
You ever heard Mary Holland or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:28:29.996 --> 02:28:33.438
or Aaron Seery talk about jurisdiction stripping?

02:28:34.719 --> 02:28:37.421
They very rarely mention the Seventh Amendment.

02:28:37.961 --> 02:28:39.942
And when you mention it, they say it's not time yet.

02:28:46.451 --> 02:28:49.452
The arguments that could be nuclear are never made.

02:28:49.653 --> 02:28:52.374
The explanations that are nuclear are never made.

02:28:52.814 --> 02:29:01.458
Is he going to tell you that there is a kangaroo court called the VICP and the CICP that pays lawyers whether they win or lose?

02:29:01.658 --> 02:29:10.583
And so the lawyers that participate in that system are already exhibiting a conflict of interest if they were ever to say, well, you know, this system isn't very good.

02:29:11.445 --> 02:29:20.629
This system is essentially jurisdiction stripping with regard to the specific subject matter of vaccines and countermeasures.

02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:33.915
Is he ever going to explain that the Health and Human Services Secretary that has the power to declare an emergency under the PrEP Act doesn't even have to justify the emergency in rational basis?

02:29:36.988 --> 02:29:41.070
There's something in legal terms called a rational basis test, and I don't even know.

02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.831
I can't teach it.

02:29:41.851 --> 02:29:42.531
I'm not a lawyer.

02:29:43.592 --> 02:29:46.213
But it means you got to have some good reason.

02:29:48.335 --> 02:29:53.978
And the emergency declared under the PREP Act does not even need to be held to the rational basis standard.

02:29:54.538 --> 02:29:55.539
It can be on a whim.

02:29:55.599 --> 02:30:05.625
It can be just because the Health and Human Services Secretary has decided that, well, I lost too many Star Wars games in my studio, so I'm going to declare an emergency.

02:30:09.059 --> 02:30:26.286
And so as a barrister, it's very interesting that he is like Mary Holland and a lot of these other purported legal scholars that are coming to our health freedom rescue, aren't able to succinctly codify the trap that we're in and how it's different than other people's traps.

02:30:28.427 --> 02:30:30.548
There's no ladders being tossed down here.

02:30:34.577 --> 02:30:36.018
Success are low.

02:30:36.298 --> 02:30:46.464
They're unwilling to lay out all the costs associated with running these cases, which they would have to do because these cases can only really be afforded by people under no-win, no-fee structures.

02:30:46.844 --> 02:30:54.649
And under those kind of structures, the solicitors firms have to lay out for their own work and also the expert fees required to pursue these claims.

02:30:55.149 --> 02:31:06.851
And on the subject of experts, there's also an unwillingness on the part of the mainstream experts to speak against these products, and that's another problem in relation to pursuing these claims.

02:31:07.352 --> 02:31:16.153
It's also the fact that individual judges have, at various times over the last few years, refused to go against the government mainstream narrative.

02:31:16.333 --> 02:31:23.595
So to ask them to basically declare products as defective is quite difficult when you bear in mind that they couldn't even bring themselves to

02:31:24.395 --> 02:31:27.537
to find that lockdowns were harmful to society.

02:31:27.757 --> 02:31:32.319
It's a stretch for them to find in favour of the victims in these kind of cases.

02:31:32.459 --> 02:31:34.960
So everything is basically stacked up against the victims.

02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:38.282
The other thing that's stacked up against them is limitation.

02:31:38.802 --> 02:31:44.905
And limitation basically says that in the UK, personal injury claims have to be issued within three years.

02:31:45.365 --> 02:31:48.307
And we're coming up against or even beyond three years.

02:31:48.647 --> 02:31:49.467
since people were injured.

02:31:49.527 --> 02:32:06.675
So it's interesting because he's not suggesting that we should attack this on the basis that they're using the existence of a pandemic and the illusion of consensus that an emergency occurred in order to justify treating these vaccine injured and killed people the way they treat them.

02:32:07.526 --> 02:32:21.591
Whereas if we started on the pretense that they lied and they murdered people and lied about it, and that's the reason why these countermeasures were ever rolled out in the first place, I think it becomes a different sort of legal space.

02:32:21.631 --> 02:32:23.792
But again, I'm not in the UK.

02:32:23.832 --> 02:32:24.932
I don't know how it would work.

02:32:24.972 --> 02:32:26.212
He's a barrister over there.

02:32:26.533 --> 02:32:30.094
But it seems like, again, we're not really trying to put any teeth on these.

02:32:30.854 --> 02:32:37.699
these things we're not trying to give people useful ways to get out of the trap but just try to describe to them how hopeless it is.

02:32:41.442 --> 02:32:58.855
In many cases there are some ways around that rule in that it can be argued that people weren't aware that they had a claim until some time later and the clock only starts ticking when they are actually aware that they have a claim but even so limitation is the major issue in relation to many of these claims.

02:33:01.192 --> 02:33:02.553
Is there a limitation on murder?

02:33:03.935 --> 02:33:07.257
Are there any other factors which prevent potential claims from being successful?

02:33:07.277 --> 02:33:13.041
To be successful in the claim, you have to show that it's more likely than not that your injury was caused by the product.

02:33:13.542 --> 02:33:18.685
And in relation to these products, the problem is that a lot of- I mean, this is so bizarre.

02:33:18.746 --> 02:33:22.348
It's like all the content that CHD is putting out right now.

02:33:22.408 --> 02:33:24.490
It's like all the content that they've ever put out.

02:33:25.615 --> 02:33:45.516
It's stupid, complicated ways of never really saying that the criminal vaccine schedule is criminal, that you should just stop, that we should have never taken it, that governments and public-private health partnerships around the world are coordinatedly lying about the murder that they've misconstrued as a gain-of-function virus.

02:33:45.957 --> 02:33:48.059
It's really very simple to say these things.

02:33:59.893 --> 02:34:08.618
The injuries are slow burn in the sense that they are related to autoimmune or inflammatory conditions induced by the injection.

02:34:08.778 --> 02:34:19.323
So they occur gradually worsening over a period of months or even years and this makes it quite difficult for experts to say that is definitely linked to the vaccine.

02:34:19.363 --> 02:34:23.346
So take for example the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccine.

02:34:23.526 --> 02:34:24.006
These were

02:34:24.426 --> 02:34:29.330
very definitely an unusual condition that happened in close proximity to the injection.

02:34:29.651 --> 02:34:37.997
And whilst there are some vaccine injuries in relation to the COVID products, which happen soon after, a lot of them happen months or even years after the injection.

02:34:38.057 --> 02:34:48.306
And it's going to be very difficult to prove that these were caused by the vaccine, particularly as the conditions being talked about are suffered by people who haven't received these products as well.

02:34:48.546 --> 02:34:50.488
It's just that they're suffered at an increasing rate.

02:34:58.286 --> 02:35:00.488
As ever, it's political pressure really.

02:35:00.648 --> 02:35:07.375
At the moment, the taxpayer is basically on the hook for costs of defending claims and the costs of meeting any compensation.

02:35:07.655 --> 02:35:15.183
It's only when the government realises that there is political capital to be gained by transferring that liability from the taxpayer

02:35:15.843 --> 02:35:19.285
to the companies themselves, to the manufacturers, that things might change.

02:35:19.545 --> 02:35:23.587
I think if there's enough political pressure on the government, they might see that as an attractive opportunity.

02:35:23.867 --> 02:35:29.590
And they can, of course, in our country, they can make laws, repeal laws, amend laws, as Parliament sees fit.

02:35:29.970 --> 02:35:40.755
So they could easily extend the limitation period, they could easily go to the manufacturers and say, it's a condition of continuing operating, and there's buying products from you that you set up proper schemes of compensation.

02:35:40.936 --> 02:35:43.617
So it's basically, as always, it's all about politics.

02:36:05.396 --> 02:36:13.559
I think these people are lying to us ladies and gentlemen and they brought some new people on stage behind the scenes to try and keep meddling.

02:36:13.579 --> 02:36:20.222
I just I don't know what to say other than we are in trouble until we start to see these people.

02:36:20.842 --> 02:36:38.472
for who they are and start to notice that they have collaborators around the world, most of them in five eyes countries that are slow rolling or slowly titrating this conclusion that benefits the biosecurity state because we will pass this mythology onto our children.

02:36:38.972 --> 02:36:42.755
This is a shot taken from the Senate committee hearing.

02:36:43.195 --> 02:36:49.158
It's kind of ironic that be over the head of Pierre Corey is the phrase, what are they hiding?

02:36:51.663 --> 02:37:06.227
they're hiding each other, and they're agreeing to hide each other because they are a coordinated lollapalooza of liars that will not discuss the overarching biological incongruities that underpin public health around the world.

02:37:06.307 --> 02:37:16.649
That is, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb, and it always has been, no matter how good they get at measuring correlates of immunity

02:37:17.589 --> 02:37:31.333
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent, and there are thousands of academic biologists at medical schools and universities around the United States and the world who have a rude awakening coming to them when they finally realize that I'm right.

02:37:31.913 --> 02:37:33.393
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:37:33.413 --> 02:37:36.314
If you don't like those words, say it in a different way.

02:37:36.414 --> 02:37:38.975
Free-ranging RNA molecules is absurd.

02:37:39.395 --> 02:37:44.376
Ladies and gentlemen, please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group

02:37:44.837 --> 02:37:51.056
by any means necessary and if you have a hard time identifying the meddlers

02:37:53.291 --> 02:37:57.294
come here because that's what we do at Giga Home Biological.

02:37:57.594 --> 02:38:07.061
We shake the pan and the gold stays in the bottom and the rocks that are still stuck in the pan, they go out.

02:38:07.141 --> 02:38:07.902
That's what happens.

02:38:08.462 --> 02:38:14.727
So if you're gold, you stay in the pan and you're not worried about a little bit of swirling.

02:38:15.769 --> 02:38:21.475
And if you're not gold, then you got to tell Jay, come on, man, don't swirl the pot so much.

02:38:21.915 --> 02:38:23.196
We're all going to fall out.

02:38:23.717 --> 02:38:26.420
And we don't all want to fall out because then where will we be?
