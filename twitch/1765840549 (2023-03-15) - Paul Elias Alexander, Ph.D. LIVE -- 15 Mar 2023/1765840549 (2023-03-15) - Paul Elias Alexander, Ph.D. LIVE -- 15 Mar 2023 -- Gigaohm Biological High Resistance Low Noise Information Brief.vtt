WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:35.300
And if I could just get it right every once in a while, right, it would just be a little

00:35.300 --> 00:36.300
better.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.300
Man.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.300
Oh man.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.300
Thanks, Greg.

00:41.300 --> 00:46.860
Greg is there like a rock.

00:46.860 --> 00:51.020
Thanks, Rodney.

00:51.020 --> 00:56.620
And thank you to all my subscribers, those in the past and the present, thank you very

00:56.620 --> 00:57.620
much.

00:58.620 --> 01:04.620
I think we're just going to do the first few slides of this start and give our guest

01:04.620 --> 01:11.180
a chance to catch up some communication problems, but I do think it's going to work out.

01:11.180 --> 01:16.820
And Paul Elias Alexander might join us this morning for a chat.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.580
Let's hope that this works out.

01:27.620 --> 01:52.860
We're going to try and get a really succinct discussion together today about the first

01:52.860 --> 01:59.140
aspect of the mythology of the pandemic, and that is the infectious clone.

01:59.140 --> 02:05.740
And whether or not this is a significant idea or just some, you know, who cares infectious

02:05.740 --> 02:08.740
clones are just the way they do it.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.700
I have a feeling that after this morning, a lot of people are going to finally, even

02:13.700 --> 02:17.540
if you've been following me for a while, are going to have a new level of insight into

02:17.540 --> 02:21.180
the power of this idea.

02:21.180 --> 02:41.700
And I hope we can convert Mr. Alexander to our view as well.

02:41.700 --> 02:56.660
So come on now, don't mess with me.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.140
I forgot I had it set up like that.

02:58.140 --> 03:06.380
I wasn't even going to play any music today, which is also very good, but let me cut over

03:06.380 --> 03:07.380
here quick.

03:07.380 --> 03:09.100
I'm not really sure.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.100
Good morning.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.100
This is Guillaume Biological.

03:11.100 --> 03:16.140
It's a very odd start this morning, some music and then not, and whatever.

03:16.140 --> 03:21.460
Usually, I give everybody a little bit more time to join us on these open study sessions.

03:21.460 --> 03:28.820
But this morning, I have a clubhouse discussion that I'm going to stream this afternoon at

03:28.820 --> 03:29.980
four.

03:29.980 --> 03:34.460
And then I'm presenting an eight to another group of doctors.

03:34.460 --> 03:42.740
And I was hoping to have a chat with one Paul Elias Alexander, PhD, a former Trump

03:42.740 --> 03:53.740
administration consultant or advisor or official, as well as how do I get to talk to is this

03:53.740 --> 03:56.300
the mean that he's here?

03:56.300 --> 03:59.940
I only see one person in the meeting.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.940
Hold on.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.020
Just let me straighten this out.

04:03.020 --> 04:07.540
I still only see one person in the meeting.

04:07.540 --> 04:24.100
I guess he doesn't understand that I'm going to zoom and he's going to zoom with me and

04:24.100 --> 04:25.540
I'm going to stream separately.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.500
I think he thought that we would tell a bunch of people about the zoom.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.620
I'm not sure if that's it.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.620
Let me see if we get here.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.140
Now he's calling me.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.140
Hold on.

04:38.140 --> 04:39.140
Yes, sir.

04:39.140 --> 04:40.140
Yes, sir.

04:40.140 --> 04:41.140
Yes, sir.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.140
Yes, sir.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.140
Yes, sir.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.140
Yes, sir.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.140
Yes, sir.

04:45.140 --> 04:51.820
Yes, I'm looking at you on your streaming, but I'm looking at you and everything, but what

04:51.820 --> 04:52.820
do I have to do?

04:52.820 --> 04:55.580
Oh, you have to join the zoom meeting that I sent you.

04:55.580 --> 05:01.380
I don't think you sent me that.

05:01.380 --> 05:03.300
Okay, well, I just sent another email with it.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.500
You can check it again when you asked me to.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500
Yeah?

05:06.500 --> 05:10.060
He should be here in a second.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.100
I'm really excited because we have been talking about this for a while.

05:13.100 --> 05:19.020
We've been trying to get something on film about the way that this all goes.

05:19.020 --> 05:23.820
So I'm just going to put this music on and we'll wait for him to join us.

05:23.820 --> 05:31.580
The idea is to try and convince people that the natural biology of coronaviruses and

05:31.580 --> 05:38.580
indeed the natural biology of RNA viruses in general is quite prohibitive to what these

05:38.580 --> 05:46.220
people have termed a pandemic where millions of lives are at stake and billions of dollars

05:46.220 --> 05:53.300
are at stake and perhaps the livelihood of all of the seven or eight or nine billion

05:53.300 --> 05:58.620
people on the planet are at stake because of this never ending and, in fact, increasing

05:58.620 --> 06:01.580
danger because of climate change.

06:01.580 --> 06:05.020
That's what we're here to dispel the mythology of.

06:05.020 --> 06:12.300
They have used fine computer models, beautiful computer animation to convince you of these

06:12.300 --> 06:17.420
biological concepts which are inherently and internally contradictory.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.420
There he is.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.420
I see him.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.340
I'm going to put him on the screen in a second.

06:22.340 --> 06:28.620
It is really exciting to have him here because it is only very recently that we became aware

06:28.620 --> 06:31.660
of one another and that we were thinking in such parallel ways.

06:31.660 --> 06:36.940
I took the risk of sending him an email and the next thing you know, we've had a few

06:36.940 --> 06:42.140
phone conversations and we've hashed out some of these broad biological ideas.

06:42.140 --> 06:46.300
I'm going to pause this wasn't my idea there.

06:46.300 --> 06:53.380
And so let me escape out of here and see if I can bring you over to the screen, sir.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.380
This should work.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.380
There he is.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.740
Look at that.

06:57.740 --> 06:58.980
So now you should be able to see everyone.

06:58.980 --> 07:02.460
I'm not sure how far behind the zoom will be.

07:02.460 --> 07:07.460
So you might want to, around the stream will be behind the zoom so you'll probably want

07:07.460 --> 07:11.700
to turn up the zoom and then monitor the stream or something like that.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.340
You should be able to see me on zoom too, right?

07:14.340 --> 07:15.340
I am.

07:15.340 --> 07:16.740
Okay, good.

07:16.740 --> 07:21.300
Would you like to give a very brief introduction as to how you got all messed up in this and

07:21.300 --> 07:25.580
where you are now, what you're doing, plug your sub stack, et cetera, so that people

07:25.580 --> 07:26.580
know who you are.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.660
They all know who I am because there's only a few people here for me right now.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.460
So give them a few minutes.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.140
They'll all start tweeting.

07:34.140 --> 07:38.620
We'll have a few hundred people in the audience in about 15 minutes.

07:38.620 --> 07:42.500
Okay, well, I can speak now.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.020
Yes, please go ahead, sir.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.020
Sorry.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.020
Thank you.

07:46.020 --> 07:52.860
First of all, Jay, thank you very much for allowing me to introduce this session and

07:52.860 --> 07:53.860
your group.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.500
And you're right.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.980
We've had some actually very engaging discussions recently.

07:59.980 --> 08:07.900
And I think I find your depth and breadth fascinating in terms of your understanding

08:07.900 --> 08:14.660
of a lot of the issues around the pandemic and total, but the gene injection itself and

08:14.660 --> 08:18.780
what we are dealing with.

08:18.780 --> 08:25.860
My belief, day one, has always been that this was not a bona fide pandemic.

08:25.860 --> 08:29.420
So I want to put that on the table.

08:29.420 --> 08:34.980
My background training is in epidemiology from the University of Toronto in Canada

08:34.980 --> 08:37.140
Graduate School.

08:37.140 --> 08:43.340
I did a short program, so I'll be brief at Johns Hopkins in a little certificate program

08:43.340 --> 08:45.580
in bioterrorism, biowaphere.

08:45.580 --> 08:51.460
I actually had the pleasure of being taught and met Dr. Donald Henderson, D.A. Henderson

08:51.460 --> 08:59.140
who is credited with eradicating smallpox and he wrote that seminal paper in 2006, basically

08:59.140 --> 09:05.180
saying that lockdowns, school closures, quarantines at the border, all of those things

09:05.180 --> 09:08.300
were devastating and will always fail.

09:08.300 --> 09:14.820
But you incur as least societal disruption as possible in an emergency like a pandemic.

09:14.820 --> 09:21.700
And you basically allow society to live normal with least disruption and basic issues like

09:21.700 --> 09:26.180
hand hygiene and that you only isolate.

09:26.180 --> 09:32.980
You only isolate voluntarily sick and well people with a strong clinical suspicion of

09:32.980 --> 09:33.980
illness.

09:33.980 --> 09:34.980
No one else.

09:34.980 --> 09:40.820
You only must test sick and well people with a strong clinical suspicion.

09:40.820 --> 09:45.020
You only detain people at a border who are sick and unwell.

09:45.020 --> 09:46.020
No one else.

09:46.020 --> 09:52.220
The vast majority of society must live normal and I'm on record three years ago, even

09:52.220 --> 09:58.220
in as part of the Trump administration seeing clearly the all we needed to do with Dr. Scott

09:58.220 --> 10:08.460
Atlas was isolate the ill strongly protective vulnerable always, but you let the vast majority

10:08.460 --> 10:11.860
of society live free unfettered lives.

10:11.860 --> 10:20.060
I went on to an Oxford, I did a graduate program in clinical epidemiology and then I was going

10:20.060 --> 10:24.740
to read for a doctorate of Johns Hopkins in bioterrorism under Henderson, Donald Henderson,

10:24.740 --> 10:31.100
but I couldn't get a proper funding because I was not a US resident at that point.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.260
I am a US resident today.

10:33.260 --> 10:40.300
So I did my doctorate at McMaster in evidence based medicine, Dr. Gordon guy at who founded

10:40.300 --> 10:44.700
the degrees of evidence based medicine supervise me, they might post off with him.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.700
Okay.

10:45.700 --> 10:50.620
So I went into this discussion quickly is I worked at it will have the organization

10:50.620 --> 10:56.140
2008, 2009 as a regional epidemiologist for Europe.

10:56.140 --> 11:07.460
I worked in 2019 back again with the whole Washington in COVID as a pandemic consultant

11:07.460 --> 11:12.780
advisor in April, May of 2020.

11:12.780 --> 11:18.620
I got word from the Trump administration people to come to Washington to join the Trump administration

11:18.620 --> 11:21.660
and I worked as a senior pandemic advisor.

11:21.660 --> 11:27.780
So from a technical point of view, I'm one of those people like Dr. Mike, et cetera,

11:27.780 --> 11:31.820
heavily worked in the area of COVID from day one.

11:31.820 --> 11:36.780
I don't pretend to be a bigger expert than new people in this meeting nor J.

11:36.780 --> 11:41.420
We all have done a lot of work and a lot of us understand things.

11:41.420 --> 11:47.340
I think the lay public has surprised me in the sense that, well, I'm not really surprised

11:47.340 --> 11:53.500
but I'm happy that they are actually more technically sound and engage in more critical

11:53.500 --> 11:59.020
thinking than traditional doctors and academic scientists who this has though their brains

11:59.020 --> 12:08.460
fell out of their buttocks, fell out of the behind because we are in a disaster situation.

12:08.460 --> 12:18.180
We've lost a lot and society and I think basically the pandemic was a fraud and a hoax period.

12:18.180 --> 12:23.500
Just everything that was done about it and while I work in the administration, you know,

12:23.500 --> 12:29.020
I've been part of the group with early treatment, et cetera, and I'm out there fighting and

12:29.020 --> 12:38.060
speaking every day to different crowds as to I'm against, fully against these gene injections

12:38.060 --> 12:42.220
mRNA or DNA platform.

12:42.220 --> 12:49.660
So Jay provides a fascinating place for me because I shared with him some of my thoughts

12:49.660 --> 12:54.620
and we realized that we have a lot of things in common.

12:54.620 --> 13:02.060
The question is, how do we forward, how do we craft a language, you know, we used a correct

13:02.060 --> 13:07.100
term. How do we get people to look below the rock or to peer behind the curtain?

13:07.100 --> 13:15.100
So how do we ask the right question? Because what was done here was wrong, nothing worked.

13:16.060 --> 13:25.580
We have zero, zero evidence, zero none across three years that any lockdown, any school closure,

13:25.580 --> 13:33.820
any mass mandate, any business closure, anything worked, everything failed, nothing worked, zero.

13:35.180 --> 13:40.460
We have this gene injection that we're still pushing on people and coming up with new ways to

13:40.460 --> 13:48.460
push it on people on new gene injection. So the question is, why, if this is not working,

13:49.420 --> 13:55.260
how do we stop it and how do we get the right people now to think like Jay and to at least

13:55.260 --> 14:01.260
consider what he's saying, because remember, we are scientists and as scientists, we don't

14:01.260 --> 14:08.700
run around suing each other if we disagree, we listen, engage, we even evolve our thinking,

14:08.700 --> 14:14.780
my thinking is evolving, good to see of people like Jay, and I imagine you guys here because you

14:14.780 --> 14:20.940
are and Jay are collaborators in some ways. So I appreciate Jay and I'll turn it back over to you,

14:20.940 --> 14:29.180
thank you. Wow, that's crazy. So what do you think and your mind would be sort of the best

14:29.180 --> 14:36.060
overarching start? Do you think we really should start with the gain of function versus infectious

14:36.060 --> 14:43.740
clones and explain to people why the pandemic doesn't have a good foundation in biology,

14:44.700 --> 14:49.580
at least as they've shown it on television? Or do you think that we should start more from the

14:50.620 --> 14:57.740
the numbers and the basic biology that they've simplified to the point of lying to us?

14:58.700 --> 15:03.180
Which do you think is the better one to start with today? Because I'm ready to do either one.

15:04.060 --> 15:11.900
And yeah, I know that we do both. Yeah, we sure sure we can do both. Yes. Okay, good. So I'm just

15:11.900 --> 15:17.660
going to start quick then with sharing my screen and then I'm going to put myself small. What that

15:17.660 --> 15:23.580
might mean is that I have to fool around with how to get you to be large on the screen. So let me

15:24.220 --> 15:35.020
just see what happens when I do this. And then I do this. I do this. I do this. And now I want

15:35.020 --> 15:42.940
you on the screen. How do I do that? I need to get writing here. And then this will get me there,

15:42.940 --> 15:47.420
right? So I want that one to be a different one. Sorry, it's going to take me one second because

15:47.420 --> 15:52.780
I knew this was going to be a problem, but I needed to fix this now and not later.

15:54.220 --> 16:01.500
I might just have to switch back and forth between you and it. I just don't like not having you on

16:01.500 --> 16:07.900
screen. Give me two more seconds because I think we can edit this better if I fix this. I'm going to

16:07.900 --> 16:16.300
add one. So that's what I'll do. I'll escape here. Sorry about that. And I'm going to change this to

16:17.180 --> 16:20.940
this one. Right now I'm logged on the screen. Yeah, I know that's perfect. Now I'm going to

16:21.020 --> 16:29.180
try and change this to something else. I'm going to make this the primary. Right? No, this one.

16:29.740 --> 16:36.460
No, the primary. Yes, that one. Yeah, there we go. Okay. And we're going to close this. No, save it.

16:37.260 --> 16:42.620
And I turn this one on. Yeah, there we go. So we can flip this around like that.

16:42.940 --> 16:50.940
And then I can start this as a slideshow. And now I'm going to switch every once in a while

16:50.940 --> 16:55.500
between these two things. But I think if I have hell screen here and I copy this,

17:00.060 --> 17:03.580
I should have put you up there. Anyway, I'm going to do this like this for now and I'll switch it

17:03.580 --> 17:10.620
back to the thing here. So this should work. Oh, no, it's the wrong one again. Dang it.

17:13.500 --> 17:19.740
Dang it. Sorry, I'm such a clown here. Primary monitor. Let's see if that works. Current slide.

17:19.740 --> 17:25.100
Yes. Okay. So this is a small picture, but the people that are watching have seen it before,

17:25.100 --> 17:33.740
this is the all cause mortality in the United States. In this picture, it is from 2014 all the

17:33.740 --> 17:41.660
way to 2022. And so if I cut, oh yeah, but then I can't cut over here to the big screen shoot.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.420
I don't really like this. Darn it.

17:45.580 --> 17:51.100
Okay. But Jake wants you something. Yes, go ahead. Are you trying to get that

17:51.100 --> 17:58.860
the information screens as big screens? Right now it's large. You are large, right? Or not?

18:00.060 --> 18:04.940
Yeah, behind it, which is fine. I don't know if people need to see me as such as here,

18:04.940 --> 18:08.940
if I ask a question, because I would like to ask questions, but can you just open that

18:08.940 --> 18:13.740
screen or the mode you were enlarging it? Yeah, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna get out of here

18:13.740 --> 18:19.180
and switch between them. Sorry, I think that's the better way to do it. So we go like this,

18:19.180 --> 18:24.140
we go current slide. And I'm you can, they can hear you in the background and this is fine.

18:24.140 --> 18:31.900
Yeah, excellent. Okay, so this is the all cause mortality in America. It is between 50,000 and

18:31.900 --> 18:38.620
70,000 a week, more or less, maybe 68,000 a week over the course of, oh, sorry, Mayor's my mouse.

18:38.620 --> 18:46.860
Over the course of 2014, all the way to the beginning of 2022. And down here in the brighter

18:46.860 --> 18:53.420
blue, what you see are people who've died of pneumonia. And the thing that we've been told is

18:53.420 --> 18:59.420
that somewhere here at the beginning of 2020, a brand new cause of death appeared. And that

18:59.420 --> 19:04.060
we're calling COVID. But what you see in these numbers is actually a very large increase in the

19:04.140 --> 19:09.740
number of people that have died of pneumonia. And it correlates very well with this increase in

19:09.740 --> 19:15.500
COVID, which is in the red there. What you'll also notice is the year on year, I'll move my head

19:16.140 --> 19:23.820
from 2014 all the way to 2020. The number of people that dies of pneumonia is very consistent.

19:23.820 --> 19:30.620
It's somewhere between 5000 and 4000 every year. And a subset of that is depicted in yellow

19:30.620 --> 19:36.860
as the identified or calculated influenza cases every year. That's usually just hand waving done

19:36.860 --> 19:43.100
by the CDC with some testing and a lot of modeling. But then over here, that all changes. There's

19:43.100 --> 19:49.580
a new cause of death now. And that new cause of death is causing an increase in pneumonia deaths

19:49.580 --> 19:56.300
like a doubling or even a tripling in the second wave. And this, these numbers were the numbers

19:56.300 --> 20:02.780
that they showed on PBS NewsHour. They didn't show this number. And had they shown this in the

20:02.780 --> 20:08.700
context of all course mortality, it would have been very hard, hard, much harder for them to sell it

20:08.700 --> 20:15.260
as the disaster it was. What I'd like you to think about is the possibility that there's a better

20:15.260 --> 20:22.140
explanation for why so many people died of pneumonia after two or three decades of there being a very

20:22.140 --> 20:28.380
constant number of people dying of it. Why all of these numbers don't have to be a new cause of

20:28.380 --> 20:35.180
death. And that is because we've seen this all before the who has done this before. The who has

20:35.180 --> 20:43.740
declared a pandemic in 2009 of a dangerous avian flu virus. And in 2020, they declared a pandemic

20:43.740 --> 20:50.380
of a dangerous novel coronavirus. This novel coronaviruses was detectable by what we now know

20:50.460 --> 20:57.740
as a very nonspecific PCR test for this RNA virus. And it was applied, as you said, to very low

20:57.740 --> 21:02.380
prevalence populations, not just people who were sick with symptoms, but everybody that would

21:02.380 --> 21:09.580
drive up through and drive through. And in addition, anybody that tested positive with this nonspecific

21:09.580 --> 21:16.300
diagnostic was in us and was in the system was in a system that had financial incentives for them

21:16.300 --> 21:23.580
to be mistreated for pneumonia, mistreated for respiratory disease, and mistreated for a novel

21:24.300 --> 21:32.220
respiratory disease based on this nonspecific test alone. The financial incentive enabled a

21:32.220 --> 21:38.780
larger portion of all cause mortality than the normal pneumonia and influenza to be prioritized

21:38.780 --> 21:46.700
as a new national security threat that could be addressed with a vaccine. This story was then

21:46.700 --> 21:53.500
perpetuated for three years. I suggest that if the molecular biology of this story is real,

21:54.220 --> 21:59.820
that there was likely something involved in the beginning, a release of something that

21:59.820 --> 22:07.100
allowed the molecular biology to be true, because a natural coronavirus cannot produce the molecular

22:07.100 --> 22:13.180
fidelity that was present from the beginning of the pandemic. In other words, if a virus is spreading

22:13.180 --> 22:18.380
around the world, there should be some sequential change that can be measured. And there's virtually

22:18.380 --> 22:26.300
no difference between Wuhan, Washington, New York, Italy, Spain, Iran. These are all the same virus

22:26.300 --> 22:32.300
for a very long time. And that's statistically and biologically impossible if you believe

22:32.300 --> 22:37.340
the cartoon that they've told you on TV. So the real goal was to make you surrender your

22:37.340 --> 22:43.900
individual sovereignty and to change human rights to basic granted permissions. And the way that

22:43.900 --> 22:51.500
they did this was that they confused you. They specifically confused you over the last 20 years

22:51.500 --> 22:59.420
about the dangers of natural viruses by publishing paper after paper about the pandemic potential

22:59.980 --> 23:08.220
of coronaviruses, paper after paper, where viruses are purported to be enriched. This is a cartoon

23:08.220 --> 23:14.300
that says you take a virus that's green and you pass it through several featuring dishes. And at

23:14.300 --> 23:19.340
the end of these several passages, the virus has become more dangerous. They've also told us they

23:19.340 --> 23:26.460
can do the same thing with animals in gold and hamsters or in ferrets. They can make a relatively

23:26.540 --> 23:34.220
benign flu virus into a very dangerous pathogenic potential virus. And more recently,

23:34.220 --> 23:39.660
they've even led Congress and the rest of us to believe that you can take pieces of different

23:39.660 --> 23:46.300
viruses, assemble them in a laboratory, and then that new virus has the potential to go around the

23:46.300 --> 23:52.380
world like the fuse of a firecracker. And I would suggest that there's really no biological evidence

23:52.380 --> 23:59.020
that any of these are actually possible. It's not likely that there are viruses in mother nature

23:59.020 --> 24:03.740
that can do what they've told us has happened. It's not likely that there are viruses in a

24:03.740 --> 24:09.180
laboratory that can do it. And there are not likely combinations of genes yet to be found

24:09.740 --> 24:15.660
that could do it. And we have to come to this understanding on the basis of basic biological

24:15.660 --> 24:24.140
principles, not cartoons like this, because this is the idea they they want us to be a have a

24:24.140 --> 24:33.340
super national group of organizations and rules that governs us in the event of a pandemic. And so

24:33.340 --> 24:39.260
essentially, they are setting up a mythology upon which a super national organization can

24:39.260 --> 24:44.700
govern us into eternity. And we don't want to let that happen. The way that they've done this

24:45.180 --> 24:49.980
is that they've changed our mind about basically four things over the last three years. They've

24:49.980 --> 24:56.300
changed our mind about the basic coronavirus swarm. They've changed our mind about all cause

24:56.300 --> 25:02.460
mortality by basically not letting us think about it. They've changed our mind about how our immune

25:02.460 --> 25:09.500
system responds to a respiratory virus. And they've changed the literal meaning and the expectations

25:09.500 --> 25:15.980
that we have around vaccination. So let's take a little quick look at this in a little more

25:15.980 --> 25:20.540
detail. A lot of my viewers have seen some version of this before. So I'll go quite quickly,

25:20.540 --> 25:25.340
because I want to get to the clone that kind of ties this all together. They first of all,

25:25.340 --> 25:30.460
they've changed the way that you think about the coronavirus swarm before this. There used to be

25:30.460 --> 25:35.980
about 200 different ways to get a respiratory disease that could lead to a secondary pneumonia.

25:35.980 --> 25:42.620
And these were all just balled up into one thing, P and I. But in 2020, we reformulated all these

25:42.620 --> 25:49.020
different and disparate causes of respiratory disease. And basically, with a very high

25:50.140 --> 25:55.900
financial incentive, convince people to call something and anything that they could find

25:55.900 --> 26:01.900
this new thing, even if it wasn't, because it was a national security thing. It's okay to do it,

26:01.900 --> 26:09.740
because better to take too many than not enough, better to over count than to undercount. And these

26:09.740 --> 26:15.180
strategies have allowed them to scare us into believing that something more significant than

26:15.180 --> 26:21.900
has happened has occurred. The test in the purported sequences are actually the only real evidence

26:22.540 --> 26:29.020
that we have that there is a new cause of death. And since none of these tests and none of this

26:29.020 --> 26:38.220
sequencing was done before 2020, there's no data to provide a baseline. We have absolutely no idea

26:38.220 --> 26:46.060
what would happen if we took the 250 emergency used authorized PCR tests back in time and tested

26:46.060 --> 26:54.540
people in 2019. Would we find similar results? We have no idea, because there was no effort

26:54.540 --> 27:03.100
to categorize the background coronaviruses up until 2020. Shockingly, we spent billions of

27:03.100 --> 27:09.740
dollars trying to characterize those same background viruses and animals and spent virtually none

27:09.740 --> 27:15.420
trying to find them in our background. Ajay? Yes, sir. You could.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.420
Is it possible I can answer a question here? Yes, you bet.

27:20.300 --> 27:27.500
So, in other words, if I understand so far what you're saying is that you are not just

27:27.500 --> 27:34.460
just arguing that the fact that something was released, we're not even discussing intentional

27:34.460 --> 27:41.020
or accidental. That's not this discussion. Something came. The question is,

27:42.380 --> 27:48.300
was it as lethal as they said? In other words, was this a non consequential coronavirus

27:49.020 --> 27:55.500
that was circulating? And then I think you are because you've touched on PCR the way I understand

27:55.500 --> 28:03.260
it is. Technically, we detected something in February or March of 2020, so I'm letting your

28:03.260 --> 28:10.060
group understand how I think, how I argue about this. We detected something in February, March 2020,

28:10.060 --> 28:17.900
that was always there. You're asking me that question? It was always circulating.

28:17.900 --> 28:26.540
Yes, that's what I believe. I believe there's a good possibility that we have been told that

28:26.540 --> 28:35.580
the fidelity of this PCR test is such that it's detecting something new rather than something new

28:35.580 --> 28:44.860
and something old. And that's how the molecular biology can be correct. Because remember,

28:45.020 --> 28:50.940
I'm trying to work under the assumption that these molecular biologists that did sequencing

28:50.940 --> 28:57.420
in Italy and did sequencing in Spain and did sequencing in Wuhan and did sequencing in Iran

28:58.060 --> 29:04.380
were not all working together to come up with the same sequence and then wink at the camera and

29:04.380 --> 29:11.340
say, yeah, it's all here. But more importantly, it had to be. It had to be a very distinct,

29:11.420 --> 29:19.100
uniform molecular signal that would fool multiple governments, multiple health organizations,

29:19.100 --> 29:26.220
multiple groups of very smart molecular biologists. That means the signals can't be fake. They can't

29:26.220 --> 29:34.860
be false positives. They're real. And the only way to get such a uniform, reproducible signal

29:34.860 --> 29:43.500
around the world of the same almost identical genetic sequence of an RNA virus would be

29:44.220 --> 29:49.980
to release it. You had to release a perfect copy in multiple places. Otherwise, it's impossible.

29:51.100 --> 29:59.180
So Jay, again, and I know we're going to do multiple shows to get the public to understand

29:59.180 --> 30:04.620
what your argument, which again, I am on site. So in other words, what we're seeing already

30:04.620 --> 30:10.700
at the beginning here, if I understand you correctly, which is what I'm thinking also is

30:11.580 --> 30:18.220
that something was released. It was actually circulating globally. So that actually opens the

30:18.220 --> 30:25.820
point that our immune systems had seen this in some capacity before. So we had some level of immunity,

30:26.460 --> 30:35.180
some level. But key is this that the PCR test and when we say that it was flawed and fraud and

30:35.740 --> 30:41.980
garbage, it's not that it was really flawed and fraud. It was that it was detecting

30:44.140 --> 30:54.780
real coronavirus, but old recovered coronavirus. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it can be the

30:54.780 --> 31:01.740
best part about this is is that it can be both. It can be that in certain places in the United

31:01.740 --> 31:08.140
States, like New York City and Washington State, there were pockets of extremely uniform symptomology

31:08.780 --> 31:16.780
and high levels of molecular positivity. And so these doctors didn't see ghosts. They saw what

31:16.780 --> 31:24.700
they saw, but there's not seeing it throughout 2020, throughout through 2021, throughout through

31:24.700 --> 31:31.740
to 2023, like they expected they would when we were back in March and April of 2020.

31:32.380 --> 31:38.380
Every one of those people expected that the hospital would eventually be full of the six or eight

31:38.380 --> 31:43.980
people that they had. Everybody in Wuhan expected the same thing. We have 22 people with a weird

31:43.980 --> 31:50.300
pneumonia. They thought it was going to come 2,200, but it never did. And that's the extraordinary

31:50.300 --> 31:56.780
part of the story. The positivity remained. The the detection of the virus was everywhere,

31:57.340 --> 32:05.820
but the standard symptomology of this, you know, altitude sickness with like ground glass capacities

32:05.820 --> 32:12.700
and yada, yada, yada. This was a very small number of cases in 2020 and virtually none now.

32:13.740 --> 32:22.460
And that if we took a very good accounting of it would be suggestive of not a a multiplicative

32:23.340 --> 32:30.060
point release spreading around the world, but an exponentially decaying multiple point release.

32:30.940 --> 32:38.860
And this is this is much safer. This is much more grounded in biology. And it explains why they took

32:38.860 --> 32:46.940
so much time to to lie to us about these basic principles of of of what was causing respiratory

32:46.940 --> 32:52.460
disease before the pandemic and how you treated it. Because again, you you're well aware of this.

32:52.940 --> 33:00.300
The the pivot of how to treat this was 180 degrees, whereas if if you had an unknown respiratory

33:00.300 --> 33:06.460
disease that led to pneumonia, antibiotics and and steroids would probably be somewhere on that

33:06.460 --> 33:14.380
chart and they took both of those away because this novel virus didn't need those and it needed

33:14.380 --> 33:21.420
remdesivir and it needed early ventilation and whatever other cockamamie things that they recommended.

33:21.500 --> 33:26.860
And because of the financial incentive and the top down control on doctors,

33:26.860 --> 33:35.340
this protocol was was instituted nations wide. And so you got a triple tripling in the number of

33:35.340 --> 33:41.500
people dying from what normally was just secondary pneumonia. We're really in trouble.

33:41.900 --> 33:50.700
So really, really what we're saying then is that that spike that we saw in 2020 of the pneumonia

33:52.300 --> 33:58.860
in that that pneumonia curve that is embedded nicely into the what the government releases a

33:58.860 --> 34:06.060
COVID curve is really based on the denial of antibiotics that that that persons deliver that

34:06.060 --> 34:12.380
inference are like illness or respiratory illness across time prior, especially elderly vulnerable

34:12.380 --> 34:20.860
people would have access to. But for the first time, governments, colleges, state boards, doctors,

34:20.860 --> 34:27.580
denied access. In other words, it is it is a fact like they do not resuscitate orders on the

34:27.580 --> 34:35.900
sedation. There was a move to the nine doctors treating patients with antibiotics that you could

34:35.900 --> 34:43.100
not treat and which is what you are saying is this is what people actually needed. Yet they

34:43.100 --> 34:51.420
will deny what they were needed and given the cockamamie, cockamamie, maybe devastating alternative

34:51.420 --> 34:58.620
treatment. That's what you see. Yes, I am saying that and especially early on when I know at least

34:58.620 --> 35:03.820
in the United States, there were many hospitals that were giving the advice that ventilating

35:03.820 --> 35:08.940
people could possibly prevent spread. So they were putting people on ventilators that could talk,

35:09.500 --> 35:17.580
which is crazy. So if we just keep if we just keep up with this here, so first we they change the

35:17.580 --> 35:24.060
way that we think about the the coronavirus swarm so that instead of thinking about us

35:24.060 --> 35:31.260
us having a long history of combating an unknown respiratory disease that leads to secondary

35:31.260 --> 35:35.260
conditions that we knew how to treat for a long time, they convinced us that there was a whole new

35:35.260 --> 35:41.180
paradigm required because this was a novel form of death. And the way they convinced us was really

35:41.260 --> 35:48.620
is primarily with the with the shot. I mean, sorry, not with the shot with the test. So what

35:48.620 --> 35:55.420
what I have here depicted is before the pandemic, you might have had these numbers looking like

35:55.420 --> 36:00.940
this where the different colors represent different causes of death, but then post the start of the

36:00.940 --> 36:07.420
pandemic. Anybody that tested positive for the test was listed as a COVID mortality. And so it

36:07.420 --> 36:14.540
it could have easily, and in fact, I argue that it did, take this same diagram, same number of

36:14.540 --> 36:20.300
people that would have died, and change it into this, which is still the same number of people dying.

36:20.300 --> 36:25.180
But now we're saying that they're dying of different things. So that's a new cause of death.

36:25.180 --> 36:30.220
There's no proof of it in the numbers. The problem is there's no proof of it in the numbers. And in

36:30.220 --> 36:35.820
fact, the PCR tests are the only evidence for this that these numbers were shifted into a different

36:35.820 --> 36:42.140
column. And if they really wanted to show you, they would have been showing you all cause mortality

36:42.140 --> 36:48.780
from previous years to show you the exact magnitude of this new cause of death, and to really teach

36:48.780 --> 36:55.740
you and your kids why this was a national security priority that required everything to be shut down.

36:56.380 --> 37:01.420
The other thing that they did is they've had three years to teach us about our immune system,

37:01.420 --> 37:06.460
and we still haven't gotten past antibodies and neutralizing a virus. And that already

37:07.100 --> 37:14.300
should have told anybody with a basic bachelor's degree in biology that this was nonsense.

37:14.860 --> 37:19.740
They've misled us about seroprevalence, which is antibodies because of national security priority.

37:19.740 --> 37:25.900
And I need my viewers kind of understand it because I stress it all the time, but I like to repeat it.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.700
If you have a secret meeting that tells people that you need to stay on message because our

37:30.700 --> 37:36.700
country is in danger, then people will usually stay on message. And I will argue that because of

37:36.700 --> 37:41.180
the nature of the countermeasures and because of the nature of the prep act and the emergency that

37:41.180 --> 37:46.380
they're working under, that they would have had many secret meetings or at least closed meetings

37:46.380 --> 37:51.660
where they would have told people to accentuate seroprevalence and to emphasize the presence of

37:51.660 --> 37:57.420
antibodies and neutralizing the virus, because this is what our countermeasure does. And we need

37:57.420 --> 38:02.780
as many people to take the countermeasure as possible. This is a national security priority

38:02.780 --> 38:10.220
very different than having the well-being of all of your citizens in mind. This was accomplished

38:10.220 --> 38:16.620
over the course of many years, because again, remember, all of the vaccine technology in America

38:16.620 --> 38:22.940
is based on this idea that a correlate of immunity is antibodies in your blood.

38:23.020 --> 38:27.980
And so most of the vaccines that have been quote unquote tested that are on the American schedule

38:27.980 --> 38:33.740
only meet this bar, which is that you inject a child with the product and the product produces

38:33.740 --> 38:40.700
a predictable antibody in the serum. There's no other real evidence of their efficacy,

38:40.700 --> 38:46.940
and I think we're starting to peel back this narrative in the United States, and we're starting

38:46.940 --> 38:52.700
to see that a lot of us have been taken advantage of by oversimplifying our immune response to the

38:52.700 --> 38:58.780
point of making it really not an explanation anymore. They have taken away your understanding

38:58.780 --> 39:03.500
of the immune system so that you can't exercise informed consent on any of these products.

39:03.500 --> 39:09.340
Just to give you an example, they make a beautiful video of the coronavirus with its big spike

39:09.340 --> 39:14.940
proteins, and then it animatedly goes into the cell. They make a beautiful video about antibodies

39:14.940 --> 39:20.700
lock into place and block the cell from entering. They even make beautiful videos about the the

39:20.700 --> 39:26.780
vaccine that's the same way. And these beautiful videos while very convincing are not necessarily

39:26.780 --> 39:33.180
based in any biology at all. They're a sales pitch. They're a product video. It's a brochure

39:33.180 --> 39:38.620
in 3D. And that's the unfortunate truth of what has happened here. The countermeasures

39:38.620 --> 39:44.220
are exactly that. They are countermeasures which are representative of a shift.

39:44.460 --> 39:52.460
The United States government has a priority of having a warm base of manufacturing that could

39:52.460 --> 39:58.860
respond to a hypothetical biological threat in the form of the flu vaccine, and all of the machinery

39:58.860 --> 40:03.980
and all of the the manufacturing capability that was devoted to the flu vaccine was there,

40:03.980 --> 40:10.220
not because it was doing any real good for the flu, but because this is a national security priority,

40:10.300 --> 40:14.540
we have to have this stuff ready to go in case we really do need to make a vaccine against something

40:14.540 --> 40:20.540
that was coming in the future. They have now shifted. And in fact, this was a plan for about

40:20.540 --> 40:27.180
10 years that they would shift from this egg based recombinant protein vaccine based stuff

40:27.180 --> 40:33.180
to an RNA based platform. This has been coming for a while. They just don't want you to realize

40:33.180 --> 40:38.780
that. And again, it's coming. And it's part of this bamboozlement of your immune system. If they

40:38.780 --> 40:42.620
simplify your immune system to the point where you don't understand it, they can sell you these

40:42.620 --> 40:49.500
products as effective. So the current focus is to say that this transmission saved millions of people

40:50.140 --> 40:55.580
and that lots more people would have died from this virus. And this is effective. It shows the

40:55.580 --> 41:01.980
effectiveness of this original rollout. Sure, it needs, it needs, it needs improvement. We can

41:01.980 --> 41:07.820
make it cleaner. We can get the DNA out of it, but it already worked very well. That's the whole

41:07.820 --> 41:13.020
concept they're trying to sell you. Here's the example from the same video. The lipid nanoparticles

41:13.020 --> 41:20.220
are released. The lipid nanoparticles have mRNA in them. The mRNA gets into a dendritic cell.

41:20.860 --> 41:24.620
I don't know how they're able to target it to the dendritic cell. They don't show it going

41:24.620 --> 41:30.140
anywhere else. It just goes to the dendritic cell. And then here's the terrible part. It goes into

41:30.220 --> 41:40.620
the dendritic cell. The DNA, the RNA is released. The RNA gets transcribed, I guess, into the

41:40.620 --> 41:46.380
protein. The spike pro there goes through the ribosome. There's the spike protein. It gets

41:46.380 --> 41:54.780
folded, I guess. And it goes onto the surface of the dendritic cell. I don't see MHC 2 there.

41:55.740 --> 42:01.740
I don't see a major histocatibility complex presenting it. Maybe that's shown there. I don't know.

42:02.540 --> 42:07.980
But the whole point is, is that they can hand wave all they want. It's a it's in a hand waving

42:07.980 --> 42:13.260
thing where they say the virus replicates like this. The virus makes you sick because of this.

42:13.820 --> 42:20.060
These sequences are evidence of live virus. This PCR test is evidence of spread. And we need to

42:20.140 --> 42:25.820
lock down. These are all hand waving. These are all Jedi mind tricks because none of this is based

42:25.820 --> 42:31.180
in real what I would call biological observations taking the product will protect your grandmother.

42:31.180 --> 42:35.820
We have a duty to society to mask and socially distance. All of these things were brought out as

42:35.820 --> 42:45.020
coercion. They are coercive words and coercive ideas which take away your understanding of the

42:45.020 --> 42:50.780
fact that ventilating people to stop spread killed many. It stops you from thinking about the

42:52.540 --> 42:58.380
application from very early on of remdesivir has killed many more people than it's saved.

42:58.380 --> 43:04.460
The untreated of secondary bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics as we usually would have done

43:04.460 --> 43:09.980
has killed a lot of people shutting down schools has hurt children and led to more suicides.

43:10.060 --> 43:16.940
Masking kids has set kids back years in development and social distancing has fractured families

43:16.940 --> 43:24.300
ruined businesses and and crushed communities. And all of this stuff is completely ignored

43:24.300 --> 43:29.980
under the pretense that there is a cave a bad cave virus or again a function virus that's still

43:29.980 --> 43:37.500
circling the globe and we should keep our head down. And this is very much not true. They have

43:37.500 --> 43:44.140
led us to believe with stories of Fauci's emails and the denial of gain of function research.

43:44.140 --> 43:49.420
You saw Rand Paul he was yelling at Fauci and Fauci was crumbling under the pressure so he was

43:49.420 --> 43:56.300
definitely covering it up. And this is why I put Scooby-Doo on the screen because they have fooled

43:56.300 --> 44:03.020
the left and fooled the right into believing that for three years they've been covering up the real

44:03.020 --> 44:09.340
origin of this virus and that it's definitely a lab leak and the evidence for it is their cover-up.

44:10.300 --> 44:16.860
This leads you to be trapped just like I was a few months ago before I figured out what

44:16.860 --> 44:19.900
infectious clones were. So that's what I was going to do next. Do you want to

44:20.620 --> 44:27.500
you have any questions or anything like that before I break? I could touch base quickly. Sure.

44:28.380 --> 44:34.060
Okay so first of all to one of your previous slides where you were listening out what killed

44:35.180 --> 44:42.460
you know if you would consider I mean it's your project and your but we know for a fact that

44:42.460 --> 44:52.780
the sedatives like my dazzle arm and oh yes killed many of our people in the nursing homes

44:52.780 --> 44:57.500
and any hospital settings because their breathing was already depressed

44:57.500 --> 45:04.140
and that that is in their death. Another thing to Jay is that we have strong evidence that

45:05.260 --> 45:10.780
many of our elderly and vulnerable persons who they put in hospitals in the COVID protocol

45:12.140 --> 45:17.660
they became very malnourishment dehydrated and dehydration and malnourishment killed

45:18.460 --> 45:24.300
many of our elderly along with isolation but what people didn't understand is these elderly

45:24.300 --> 45:29.420
were not fed they were not getting no liquids nothing especially when they put them in the

45:29.420 --> 45:35.420
interbethrin ventilation it's a very critical issue also it's a it's like a complete package

45:35.420 --> 45:40.220
that put our elderly and vulnerable they were already vulnerable because a lot of these who

45:40.300 --> 45:48.700
oveied by had some medical conditions already heart heart illness diabetic problems renal

45:48.700 --> 45:54.940
failure or sorts of issues and then you are putting them in this COVID protocol I want to

45:54.940 --> 46:01.500
remind your viewers something because it's very interesting to you. You touch base on it with the

46:01.500 --> 46:07.420
PCR test you know just so that and I know Jay you are an expert I'm not seeing anything you don't

46:07.900 --> 46:14.060
but I just want to make sure that we set the table properly because you are throwing a lot of

46:14.060 --> 46:20.860
very very heavy bombs here and we need people to understand it when we looked at the data

46:20.860 --> 46:27.820
I did an analysis myself with with Dr. Atlas from it when he was at the Eisenhower building and

46:28.940 --> 46:35.900
we we summarize all of the evidence that any PCR test over 24 cycles

46:36.620 --> 46:37.420
one

46:40.060 --> 46:47.180
Now that you're not detecting prior recovered coronavirus that's not what we argue but anything

46:47.180 --> 46:55.580
over 24 cycles was non infectious non pathological coronavirus and that's the argument so once we

46:55.580 --> 47:02.700
cycle that 40 and 45 which is what CDC said when you come to an above that was not coronavirus

47:02.700 --> 47:11.900
there was Lisa not Lisa anything over 24 was uh was non infectious non-culturable non-leitha

47:11.900 --> 47:16.220
and I want to also because it's very important because we were cycling at 45

47:17.500 --> 47:22.140
so everything in other words when they made the argument that 95 percent of these

47:22.140 --> 47:28.380
positive cases were false positive there's a lot of legitimacy to that we we closed society

47:28.380 --> 47:34.860
down took children out of school closed businesses with largely false positive people

47:34.860 --> 47:40.060
and that's what history I believe will show and I will end this interruption by by telling

47:40.060 --> 47:47.420
people this my office said okay so when I went to Washington my office was in health and human

47:47.420 --> 47:54.460
services health and human services is the umbrella agency that CDC NIH FDA etc reporter

47:55.180 --> 48:02.060
so health and human services is situated right opposite the capital building and for a reason

48:02.060 --> 48:07.420
because many of the people in health and human services spend a lot of time in the capital building

48:07.420 --> 48:16.140
in hearings on a meeting and so they wanted close proximity so like the FDA CDC NIH etc had

48:16.140 --> 48:22.380
sub offices so I worked with all a lot of these people like like uh han redfield

48:22.380 --> 48:28.780
juror all of them fauci etc what I'm trying to tell you is operation warp speed

48:30.140 --> 48:35.340
for the drug and vaccine member operation was it was not just for vaccines it was for all of the

48:35.340 --> 48:44.380
therapeutic and the government needed decision to take the seventh floor of health and human

48:44.380 --> 48:50.940
services and make it the headquarters for operation warp speed operation warp speed was run

48:51.740 --> 48:57.020
out of the seventh floor of health and human services building 200 independence avenue

48:57.020 --> 49:04.860
opposite the capital my office was on the sixth floor I worked directly below operation warp speed

49:04.860 --> 49:10.460
and what I'm telling you that is because you use some terms early and I want the public to

49:10.460 --> 49:18.540
set the table properly when I went on to the seventh floor for various reasons example in

49:18.540 --> 49:26.140
meeting I can tell you that the entire seventh floor of health and human services building

49:26.140 --> 49:33.580
was comprised mainly of united states army personnel and united states navy personnel

49:33.660 --> 49:41.820
operation warp speed was principally a military operation and I am not somebody from any outside

49:41.820 --> 49:47.900
on television or behind a computer writing emails in different email groups speculating

49:48.860 --> 49:54.780
what do these rules was I'm speaking from the inside remember I didn't see anything negative

49:54.780 --> 50:01.820
here I am not railing against the department defense in my statement here I'm just first

50:01.820 --> 50:14.780
speaking of back operation warp speed was a pure military operation HHS CDC FDA NIH had a

50:14.780 --> 50:23.740
seat at the table when they were invited to speak the military ran the pandemic response the

50:23.740 --> 50:31.500
military ran the vaccine development and response the people I spoke to was in heavy military

50:31.500 --> 50:39.340
uniform these were scientists etc from the United States military army navy many of them are

50:39.340 --> 50:44.940
tremendous people I met and worked with I'm trying to make you understand what you said is a fact

50:45.660 --> 50:53.500
people could speculate what you said when you put that to them on your slide DOD yes that's not

50:53.500 --> 51:01.580
guessing that is a fact I was there that's what I wanted to see so with regard to the PCR just

51:01.580 --> 51:09.900
to circle back with that I just wanted to be clear that that so the the issue is for the people at

51:09.900 --> 51:17.580
home that to detect the whole genome of the virus you can't do that with PCR PCR has limits in terms

51:17.580 --> 51:24.060
of the size of fragment that can be amplified so if you were going to try to detect a book

51:25.020 --> 51:30.940
you might only be able to amplify three pages of the book and so you would want to choose

51:30.940 --> 51:35.740
pages from that book that were unique to that book if you chose pages that were very similar

51:35.740 --> 51:43.580
to other books your test wouldn't be very very specific and unfortunately the nature of pandemic

51:44.140 --> 51:52.300
sorry of coronavirus biology is that the the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the end protein

51:52.300 --> 51:59.260
are two proteins especially the RNA dependent RNA polymerase that are highly conserved across

51:59.260 --> 52:06.700
coronaviruses across different species even and so the fact that they two of the markers of the three

52:07.180 --> 52:16.300
in any PCR test from 2020 or 2021 we're targeting proteins that have their own homologous version

52:16.300 --> 52:23.900
in every other coronavirus is something that set the groundwork for an incredible number of false

52:23.900 --> 52:33.420
positives beyond that of just amplifying beyond 30 cycles we're talking about a background where

52:34.380 --> 52:40.860
the that where a amplicon could start amplifying and it won't be false because a lot of these

52:40.860 --> 52:47.100
PCR tests are nested primers so when they amplify something it's real it's a real signal but the

52:47.100 --> 52:53.980
question is have they chosen a signal that's specific for this virus or generalizes across

52:53.980 --> 53:00.140
all coronaviruses and in reality the spike protein is the only protein that is unique to this virus

53:00.780 --> 53:06.300
so the rest of the PCR test is not specific and at some point after the discovery of

53:06.300 --> 53:12.540
amachron we stopped looking for the spike and indeed we were told that amachron is a

53:12.540 --> 53:21.340
PCR test where the spike doesn't amplify and so it is an extraordinary jump to go from PCR

53:21.340 --> 53:27.820
positive to say somebody has SARS-CoV-2 it's impossible actually but it was done en masse

53:28.380 --> 53:31.180
for 2002 and most of 2021

53:36.060 --> 53:43.020
just to get you to perfect so but when what are your thoughts then on the fact that when we

53:43.020 --> 53:48.140
look at the science what was published out there in the literature from other countries who were

53:48.140 --> 53:54.700
using the PCR and they put out data they were saying they were showing that when they correlated it

53:55.260 --> 54:03.100
this deep the amplification the cycles with with infectiousness or for pathological nature

54:03.100 --> 54:12.540
they found the 24 to 25 cycles and above could not predict pathological virus what are your

54:12.540 --> 54:18.300
thoughts oh I have I have I have no problem with that I mean there is okay I'm just trying to make

54:18.300 --> 54:24.540
sure that you understand that within the the range where molecular biologists would agree that

54:24.540 --> 54:34.140
it's a good signal there are also false positives because of this background so it is even worse

54:34.140 --> 54:39.260
than what we we thought in the sense of yeah there are false positives because they overcycled

54:39.260 --> 54:45.420
the test but there are also false positives embedded in what people are calling true positives

54:46.220 --> 54:50.140
because there are coronaviruses in the background that they won't acknowledge

54:50.700 --> 54:57.500
this test is not specific for do you see caught it and so that just makes it worse it's not I don't

54:57.500 --> 55:02.220
know how to quantify that but I think the infectious clone part will really clear it up because it'll

55:02.220 --> 55:08.940
get people thinking also about the infectious cycle and why that matters and so if I start there then

55:09.100 --> 55:16.060
the infectious clone is a really important thing to understand because it's basically how all

55:16.060 --> 55:21.980
of virology is done I want to start everybody on the same cartoon Paul has seen this cartoon before

55:21.980 --> 55:27.420
and so have some of my viewers but anybody that's joining me for the first time this one will be

55:27.420 --> 55:33.740
a good one what they have told you is that the yellow virus this will be SARS-CoV-2 for this

55:33.740 --> 55:38.300
illustration gets into your lungs and when it does so it makes copies of itself

55:39.260 --> 55:43.900
and as it makes more and more copies of itself you start coughing some of those out

55:43.900 --> 55:48.300
and people around you can get sick with the virus that will also replicate in their lungs

55:48.300 --> 55:55.260
make copies of itself and spread spread spread alongside of this story is a little caveat

55:56.060 --> 56:03.900
and that is that in history like historically it is very difficult to take from a patient

56:03.900 --> 56:10.380
enough virus to get it to grow in a cell culture the stories that we have been told are that we

56:10.380 --> 56:15.340
don't have cell cultures that are specific for these viruses it's hard to make a cell culture

56:15.340 --> 56:20.620
and a virus grow together we don't have the right medium we haven't found the right cell type

56:21.580 --> 56:30.140
but in reality it has more to do with the content of this swarm in biology we talk about populations

56:30.620 --> 56:36.780
in terms of with using different terms and when we talk about the population

56:36.780 --> 56:44.460
the genetics of a population we often talk about a swarm because although all of the the people

56:44.460 --> 56:51.020
that have lived in Pittsburgh their whole life are are relatively related to one another as humans

56:51.020 --> 56:57.020
you know that there's all this this genetic variant in between with viruses it's even more so because

56:57.100 --> 57:03.340
of the simplicity of their genome their RNA and every time they make copies of themselves they make

57:03.340 --> 57:09.900
a mistake and so when a virus infects your lungs and makes lots of copies of itself it's not this

57:09.900 --> 57:16.700
picture it's not many many copies of a book or many many copies of a baseball cap it is in fact

57:16.700 --> 57:24.700
many imperfect copies a lot of which depicted here as empty don't even get the requisite number

57:24.700 --> 57:31.180
of genes to be able to replicate themselves they're erroneous they're broken they're missing

57:31.180 --> 57:39.180
something and this is because the nature of viral replication is far from perfect and they've known

57:39.180 --> 57:44.700
this for a long time in fact as long as they've been studying viruses they've seen this signal

57:44.700 --> 57:50.300
and tried to explain it away as part of the infectious cycle and when I say infectious

57:50.300 --> 57:56.540
cycle I mean you have a virus it goes into your lungs it makes copies of itself and then those

57:56.540 --> 58:01.820
copies leave your lungs and go into someone else the details of that story are important

58:01.820 --> 58:08.540
because they underlie the idea of asymptomatic infection they underlie the idea of super contagious

58:08.540 --> 58:16.460
versus not contagious and they also underlie the idea of the fidelity of the genome the idea that

58:16.460 --> 58:22.220
the virus that was in Italy and Spain and New York and Washington and Wuhan and Iran all

58:22.220 --> 58:28.860
had the same sequence at the start and maintained it for quite some time as they spread from all

58:28.860 --> 58:35.180
these places and then at some point it was all delta and then at some point it became all omicron

58:35.980 --> 58:41.820
and that belies a certain level of not belies a certain level of but it implies a certain

58:42.460 --> 58:50.620
uniformity in the biology a certain uniformity in the genetic in the genetic pattern that we see

58:50.620 --> 58:59.180
here stop so that's the issue that we're trying to confront because what they tell us is a virus

58:59.180 --> 59:05.100
from the wild that's really hard to culture is an actuality in their own description of it

59:05.180 --> 59:13.740
a difficult swarm to culture because if you are sampling from a sample that very few of the viruses

59:13.740 --> 59:19.820
are actually fully capable of causing a new infection then that would explain very easily why

59:19.820 --> 59:27.260
they have such a difficulty culturing it one example from the Wuhan lab is they took over 7,000 samples

59:27.740 --> 59:37.180
from wild bats they were able to find six partial sequences using PCR nothing grew so that's the

59:37.180 --> 59:43.820
kind of biology that we've been doing we've been looking for things in the wild that are very

59:43.820 --> 59:48.700
difficult to study because of the nature of the way that they replicate and how imperfect it is

59:49.980 --> 59:56.620
the way that we've discovered that allows us to address this issue is to take a sequence of

59:56.620 --> 01:00:02.460
an RNA virus that we find in nature using our very complicated molecular biological techniques

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:10.620
and to make a DNA copy of it because unlike RNA DNA can be copied over and over again

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:17.340
and it has built-in proofreading because it's double-stranded the best part is is that you can make

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:25.100
many many copies of DNA and it lasts forever in a dish if you combine and in the right circular

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:33.020
DNA called circular called like a bacterial chromosome or just a circular plasmid of cDNA

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:40.220
like I have depicted here you can let bacteria make lots and lots of copies of it now you'll have

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:49.660
lots and lots of copies of the DNA version of this imperfect RNA swarm when you add RNA polymerase

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:58.380
you make thousands trillions of copies of the RNA all of which are identical that's impossible

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:04.780
for the wild virus to do because RNA can't copy itself perfectly but if you start with DNA

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:11.980
and lots of copies of it that are perfect and make your RNA from that now when you

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:17.500
transfect yourselves you're going to get lots and lots of copies the swarm will be very different

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:26.060
than this it will be a pure swarm that pure swarm will allow you to infect animals it will allow

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:32.460
you to freeze stocks and send it to other people and it will allow you to repeatedly create experiments

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:37.580
write grants etc you don't ever have to go out in the wild again you don't have to sample from

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:44.540
another patient again you can just use the cDNA clone that you created in the year 2002 after

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:53.980
the original SARS pandemic to make as much infectious RNA as you want and this has been told to you

01:01:53.980 --> 01:02:02.380
as being standard procedure when it's the only pure form of a synthetic virus or any virus that

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:08.540
exists anywhere there is no pure form in nature because RNA can't copy itself that way there is no

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:18.380
pure form in nature because the assembly process is super unreliable so if you go back into the

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:26.860
history of this stuff and just look for infectious clones or infectious clone and on virus you can

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:33.340
find on PubMed for example of this year this is 2010 you can find like eight papers infectious

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:43.100
clone of old blue dwarf virus of a of a flu virus of avian hepatitis virus of a herpes virus

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:49.580
a feline virus this everything they're all made from DNA copies of infectious clone

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.420
the reason why this is important is because the wild virus is a bit like a mixed tape

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.700
if you've ever made a mixed tape for your girlfriend back in the 80s what you did was you took different

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.180
songs from different albums and you put it on that tape and then you gave it to her like a

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:11.740
Valentine's Day gift and the trick was is that you started out with a with a album that you bought

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.820
in the store that when you made a copy the song would still sound pretty good you could play it in

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:20.620
the car or play it on your walk minute would sound great but your girlfriend couldn't make a copy of

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.180
it because then by then the songs would have too much noise in them you wouldn't want to listen to

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:31.020
it in your earphones that's the nature of imperfect copies you can think of RNA like this

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:39.740
and you can also think of making a cDNA version of of of a virus as being a CD version of a

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:45.980
mixed tape such that you can make as many mixed tapes as mixed CDs as you want and you can copy

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:51.740
that mixed CD into more mixed CDs and you won't lose the fidelity like you do when you're copying

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:57.820
cassette tapes this is the best analogy i can come up with for why understanding

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:04.140
the natural virus remember the natural virus is the cassette tape that's over here in the corner

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:13.260
and we want to understand it by making a cDNA CD cDNA version of it we want to understand it

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:20.460
by putting it into a bacteria and let the bacteria make lots of copies of the cDNA version of

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:27.340
the cassette tape we want to understand it by making lots of copies of the same RNA

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:34.380
perfectly copied from these DNA so that we can understand what the RNA cassette tape does

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:41.580
the way we do it in every paper is that we use electricity to force that RNA into a cell culture

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:48.780
cell culture makes copies of the RNA and we can infect animals we can make cultures of it we can

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:57.180
do plaque assays and this is cassette tapes but back here where the DNA was that's where the

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:05.500
danger is that's the one that tests PCR positive because PCR is not RNA it's DNA and so this is

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:10.220
where it gets tricky this is where it's really important that everybody follows and i don't think

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.620
i've shown this to Paul yet so if you want to pause here for a second we can pause here

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:23.660
and then and then we'll go on to this next part so basically g what you're saying is

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:32.460
in the wild natural natural virus then in the wild when you are infected and you get virus into

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:38.380
the into the nostrils nasal pharyngeal passage down inside the lung deep into the

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:46.460
then you get you infected so you're making multiple copies many many many million billion

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:54.620
that's what they say that's what they say yes yes let's say thousand what we are seeing then

01:05:54.620 --> 01:06:03.420
is because of the very unstable error prone genetic copying mechanism in in in the virus

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:12.220
in this case single stranded RNA single stranded RNA the resulting copies of the virus

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:20.780
are not all the same in other words because they are you you're also what you're saying is

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:28.380
many of them would be broken to be suboptimal in their ability to infect absolutely they are

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:33.500
and i have video of many different virologists explaining this for many different viruses

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:40.620
it's just a known fact they're called non-infectious interfering particles they're called

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.940
they have a couple different names for them and they've tried to characterize the relative

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.500
proportion of infectious particles and non-infectious particles for various viruses

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:58.300
but it's only become possible very recently and that's what i wanted to kind of explain now because

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:04.220
before this they don't they just do plaque assays and they tell you that this gives us some idea of

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:10.060
the concentration of the virus in the culture but none of these are direct measurements of

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:15.900
the number of particles none of them are direct measurements of the contents of the particles

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:22.700
and none of them are are measurements of the ability to really replicate high fidelity because

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:28.700
a plaque assay is just cells cells making a re having a reaction to what you put on them

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:37.980
if something is growing in a plaque assay to call that definitively replication of virus

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:43.020
up until now maybe was a bit of hand waving that they got away with but recently we have these

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:48.780
techniques called nanopores this technique called direct nanopore sequencing that gives us the

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.540
opportunity to look at what's really happening in that in that preparation so that's what i want

01:07:54.540 --> 01:08:05.740
to do here next so the question is um in the natural infectious cycle what's the ratio

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.940
between good particles up here in the colored and bad particles the ones that don't have any

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:17.900
color and depending on this ratio of course we would understand the infectiousness and we would

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:23.580
understand the infectious cycle very differently and so i want to remind everybody of a positive

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:29.580
that i've been making for some time which is whatever viruses are they can't make cells do

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:35.820
something that they don't already do and i'm going to argue that cells are making and using

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.460
vesicles to communicate with one another all the time and that a coronavirus is likely just

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:48.300
an obligate pathogen that briefly hijacks that same machinery to make a few imperfect copies of

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:56.060
itself it's a bit more like a noise or dirt on a record than it is a pathogen per se and i think

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.820
the best way to see it is to see it through nanopore sequencing why is nanopore sequencing so

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:08.940
exciting well at the start of the pandemic even we were told and explained that sanger sequencing

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:16.380
is the gold standard for sequencing any biological entity and certainly for sequencing this coronavirus

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:23.180
sanger sequencing is not something where you can take a long strand of DNA let's say 30,000

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:28.380
base pairs like a coronavirus is purported to be made up and sequence it from beginning to end

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:37.580
like a lot of these other diagnostics they are limited by the need to to amplify the molecules

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:42.780
and make many copies of them before you're able to sequence them and in sanger sequencing you're

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:49.100
limited to the length of the PCR amplicon that you can raise up and i'm going to just throw

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.820
something out there i don't know if this is the correct answer i think the longest amplicons are

01:09:53.820 --> 01:10:01.900
somewhere between 300 and 500 bases it could be a thousand the point is is that the PCR reactions

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:09.340
that are required to do a whole sequencing of the coronavirus is in between 99 and 106 depending

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:19.420
on which product you use 99 amplicons are looked for and amplified and then a computer lines up

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:24.380
all those amplicons and comes up with a consensus sequence that it spits out and says this is the

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:30.620
variant that was inside you and if a certain number of those amplicons don't amplify

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:37.100
then the sequencing reaction will be said to fail direct nanopore sequencing is a new technique

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:44.460
where they use a modified ion channel protein which is a protein that can sit in a lipid bilayer

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:53.340
and allow salts to move through like sodium or potassium if it's open and if it's closed nothing

01:10:53.340 --> 01:11:00.380
can move through and what they've done is taken a couple of different ion channels and modified

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:07.020
them so that when DNA or RNA passes through the channel and there's a voltage on either side of

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:14.220
the membrane the voltage will change in predictable ways as the the the bases pass through the channel

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:19.980
and if they do this enough times they get many reads and there's no limit to the size of the

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:25.900
molecule which is capable of going through the nanopore up to two million bases can be read

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:32.380
continuously in these preparations so this is an exciting new addition to the toolbox of

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:40.220
virology because for the first time now instead of using a gel to look at the total contents of a

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:47.180
infectious an infection in a cell culture we can look at the particles and count them and see what

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:54.620
we see when we look for the RNAs that are produced during infection so the idea is of course depicted

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:01.020
in this cartoon here that the RNA which is this little pearls here are wrapped around the end

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:07.740
protein and then those get all organized into a nice neat genome ball that is invaginated into

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.780
an endosome the endosome already has the spike protein expressed on the inside so that when

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:19.900
the the genome is assembled it's perfect and ready to go so the question is how often does this happen

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:26.940
and what evidence do we have that it happens all the time in this paper that I showed you earlier

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:33.740
that I brought up direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coronavirus genomes they take

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:40.860
and they use let's see if I can see it recombinant viruses and total RNA isolation were performed

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:50.300
as previously briefly full-length cDNA copies of the genomes of human coronavirus 229e and a

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:57.580
couple other ones were engineered into recombinant vaccinia viruses using previously described methods

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:05.100
in those methods they make many copies of the RNA using a virus and a that that infects a certain

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:10.540
cell type it's a little bit more complicated than how it's done now but it works to make many many

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:19.660
perfect copies of the RNA of the HCO that's human coronavirus 229e one of the four that's

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:25.740
known to be endemic so what they're going to do is they're going to put it into a cell culture

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.540
you don't need to see this this is just showing you how they they create the recombinant coronavirus

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:36.140
and lots of it you can check that out later and what they're going to do is put it into the

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.340
cell culture and then they're going to look in the cell culture to see what RNA they can find

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:50.220
because a full genome RNA would be a a virus subgenomic RNA will be RNA that's being used by

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:55.500
the cell to make spike protein and protein and protein and all the other proteins that are necessary

01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:02.300
for the assembly and copy of the virus and a lot of the infectious cycle is hand waving for these

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:07.580
virologists because they don't want you to quantify well really how many viral particles are

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:11.980
there how much of this RNA is actually packaged where does it all go they don't want to answer

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:18.300
those questions but they do have some answers this paper by the way is from 2019 so what they

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:23.900
find when they look are different RNAs and they have them listed here the longest one is RNA one

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:30.460
that's the entire genome that's what you would expect it to be the predominant form in the dish

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:35.660
if all that's happening is it's making lots of copies of the virus then most of the RNA we

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:41.900
should find in there should be full-length genomes packaged in balls ready to infect the next cell

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:48.620
underneath here we have other RNAs of different lengths including the S protein and protein etc

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:56.220
so let's look at what they find in the sample they find the longest leads are 26,000 base pairs

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:00.060
that's pretty good that's almost the full genome that's a pretty good coverage you can never get

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.420
that with Sanger sequencing but they find lots of other small ones and there's lots of errors

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.820
because this isn't perfect but whatever we've got long pieces so that's great let's see how

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:17.180
they come out quantity-wise so if you see the coverage here this is the the number of of amplicons

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:22.220
that they find a number of RNA species that they find so this is 10 to the fourth that's that's

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:31.180
isn't that 10,000 so if you go here they're finding more closer to 60 or 80 or 90

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:41.980
thousand is that what it is of the N protein RNA and I don't know what is that 40,000 of the M

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:51.820
20,000 of the E around a few hundred of the S and actually if we go to the circle diagram

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:58.700
to show the coverage they only found two RNAs that seem to cover most of the genome

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:08.940
two so hundreds of thousands of N protein RNAs are present which would do fine on a PCR test

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:16.620
hundreds of spike protein RNAs are presents which would do fine on a PCR test but full-length

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:22.060
genomes they only found two using this state-of-the-art sequencing technology

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:28.940
that doesn't need amplification is it biased by PCR just throw it all through it can read the RNA

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:36.220
and the DNA and they only found two full-length genomes in a cell culture that was transfected

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:44.620
with a clone that was supposed to have millions of particles of full genomes had two and hundreds

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:53.180
of thousands of the N protein RNA alone what this means is their cartoon of how this looks

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:58.700
has been defined already a long time ago let's look at this old paper when we look at this old

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:05.420
paper and we look at the gel which separates the sub genomic RNAs from the full genomes

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:13.020
and they're looking for all of this to try and quantify the difference they find N protein huge

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:21.500
band S protein huge band E protein huge band M protein huge band full-length genome is a shadow

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:31.740
very much almost undetectable so they've known this for 20 years the viruses don't replicate

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:37.500
like the cartoons that they show in their talks the viruses don't replicate like the cartoons that

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:44.220
they show in their grants that that viruses don't replicate like the cartoons that they show that

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:51.740
underlie pandemic potential of them and so what if we have been misled about the infectious cycle

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:57.820
we clearly we have been PBS NewsHour still talks like it's just a virus with variants and the

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:04.060
variants are consistent across your household and that you can see them and that they're there

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:09.020
they've never explained to you what the swarm is they've never explained to you the contents of

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:14.380
the swarm they've never told you that the vast majority of particles in a in an infection are

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:21.180
not infectious and the reason why they haven't told you that is because then the whole story of

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.620
zero prevalence being paramount will unravel then the whole story of while we got to block all

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:33.580
these particles will unravel the the story of super spreading events will unravel because you

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:39.180
can see if these non-infectious particles can still cause irritation in the people in your house

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:45.500
a sore throat a cough for a couple days you might imagine that that's infectiousness

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:52.220
when it's actually just shedding of non-infectious particles by somebody infected with the coronavirus

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:57.820
and I think that a lot of older doctors have had this feeling in their gut for many many years

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:06.460
that the way that that infectious disease spreads is not as cartoon simple as they've been told

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:12.540
since they started their thing so why are we isolating it the way we are why can't we culture

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:18.380
it this is all explained by under a better understanding of the infectious cycle I think

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:25.020
that's where we are the tv has told us that these are the dangers and in reality the only

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:30.620
dangerous purity if they make enough of one of these and they put it in enough places they can

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:35.900
tell us the story of spread that isn't backed up by any of the biology that they've done previously

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:43.100
but will have all the molecular signatures and the brief the brief fidelity and sort of

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.940
obviousness to the doctors that while there was clearly an illness of course there was an illness

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:55.660
but it was likely an illness caused by a release of a clone so that they could claim a uniform

01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:01.500
molecular signal around the world claim that there was a pandemic for which these non-specific

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:09.900
tests were specific for and then as it went on the explanation would shift from there is a virus

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:15.660
to its different variants to whatever and that all allows them to absorb what's in the background

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.860
so if you want to pause here then i've got those those those best cartoons of the total

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:27.100
explanation i think everybody old up so i could ask a question yeah you bet you

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:35.100
so what we really begin to say because remember i said from my own and from my own

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:41.420
point of view that this was a hoax and a fraud from day one in terms of what we were dealing with

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:46.620
that this was never really a pandemic that this was never really a lethal

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:55.260
pathogen as was presented to us and we shut the world down before and many of us were damaged

01:20:55.260 --> 01:21:00.300
because of what we were seeing and it didn't come forward with a narrative but what you are

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:06.140
you are given a very cogent high-level presentation here basically is saying that

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:13.580
we are potentially looking at a release multiple places across the world

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.860
how am i going so far jig it's perfect i mean this is the only way and i think this is the

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.660
cartoon that i'm about to present really explains why it has to be that way and why

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:31.340
the best part about it i think in and we talked about this that's what got you excited i think is that

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:41.420
it means that very few people are totally wrong it means very few people just totally got it wrong

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:47.660
tony fauci definitely got it all wrong i mean these people for sure but people like you and me

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:54.300
and people that are fighting on one side or the other they have not seen ghosts they are seeing

01:21:54.300 --> 01:22:00.700
real things they are seeing real contradictions there are real incongruencies here and i think

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:08.140
the story or that's let's say this the hypothesis that lines the most of these incongruencies up for

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:15.260
the most people that think that they're arguing against one another is the idea that this virus

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:21.100
was in the background previously or related viruses are in the background from previous and that makes

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:28.060
the test a specific and it's really that simple and once you once you grasp how much that could

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:33.660
explain in combination obviously with the dumb protocols that were instituted on the back of the

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:39.500
test it there's there's almost no need for a virus anymore and the only reason why you need

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:45.660
the virus is to see the molecular pattern to make sure that the molecular biologists in Italy were

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:52.380
like whoa it matches and the people in Iran were like wow it matches and the people in

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:57.900
Washington were like holy man it matches because then they're all fooled they're done

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:05.100
the biology is there and they're not going to question it because this idea was never offered

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:11.420
to them on tv ever once it was forced on them as a novel thing and the biology that they saw in the

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:20.860
very beginning matched up even the doctors that's the trick so let's see this one is this one here

01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.780
so if we first of all i'm gonna the graphics are going to get just a little bit mixed up but

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:32.460
you won't you won't be confused by the first scenario that Tony Fauci presented us to us in

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:38.300
the very beginning and pretended like that this was the only possibility is the natural bat

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:45.820
cave virus i have the planet earth in green because the protocols the lockdown they didn't hurt anybody

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:51.100
the vaccines have saved lives in this story there is a natural bat cave virus that escapes

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.580
in china it travels around the world and as it travels around the world it's changing

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:01.500
those changes are pretty uniform at some point there was a new variant in africa depicted in blue

01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:07.820
that blue omicron variant went around the earth and now that we're here in 2023 a shoot i forgot

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.860
to put the years on here these are every these are meant to be different years so here's the

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:20.780
start of the pandemic then 2020 2021 2022 and 2023 and so this is the tv story right we couldn't

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:24.700
have done anything about it we were trying but we couldn't did jump it's going to jump again

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:29.020
for sure it's because of climate change and there's too many people in yada yada yada

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:35.820
in this scenario novel coronaviruses can jump from other species and they can do pandemics

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:41.740
the pcr false positives were rare asymptomatic spread was real and there was only some over

01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.620
counting actually most of the time we are under counting the variants are evidence of both spread

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:51.820
and the continuing evolution of a single novel virus and we spend money studying viruses on

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:59.260
gain of function research these are all what people on that watch like cnn believe so then maybe

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:03.740
there's some people on fox now or republicans that have been convinced that it's a laboratory

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:09.980
bat cave virus so in this case it was in a lab it doesn't even have to be fixed or changed or

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:16.140
altered it just has to be a virus that was brought from the wild into a laboratory and then escaping

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:23.980
through a lab worker leaking out of a out of the wastewater and again we have the same pattern

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:29.420
but in this scenario let's just throw in the fact that the lockdowns were damaging let's throw in

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:35.580
the fact that the protocols that we rolled out didn't help everybody we can even speculate that

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:40.300
maybe omicron was a second release which is a lot of people's speculation that

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.540
omicron is so different than the previous virus that it has to be a second release

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:51.340
so in this story there are multiple bat cave viruses there is possibilities of multiple

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:59.900
releases but it's a virus itself that can go around the world like a firecracker and so again

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:06.620
and novel viruses can jump from species they can also leak from labs pcr positives are rare

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:12.060
asymptomatic spread is real and there's some over counting variants or evidence of spread

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:17.660
and continuing evolution of the virus and some fringe people even say that omicron was one of

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:23.580
those two but the vast majority of them just say that a lab leak virus could do this for four years

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.900
because we spend money on getting a function research so this is where

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:35.500
we can pause this is basically the trap that most people in america and around the world are in

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:41.260
and this is what i mean by the scooby-doo for the people who aren't living in america scooby-doo is

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:48.460
a show about teenagers that follow a list and series of clues to figure out a mystery and my

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:55.500
suggestion is is that they laid clues for the left and for the right clues in the form of drama

01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.500
in front of congress clues in the form of foyer requests clues in the form of partially redacted

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:07.260
emails so their irrespective of whether you were on the red or the blue team you were eventually

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:14.540
going to be led down a mystery path where you pulled the mask off the bad guy and it's a lab leak

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:21.340
and it could happen again and as long as you come to those two conclusions that it was a

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:27.580
virus and it's a scary one and that it could happen again your children and your grandchildren will

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:35.500
be trapped forever in a biology that is not supported in the literature at all and doesn't

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:40.940
really acknowledge almost half of the things that we know when we look back in in retrospect from

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:45.180
three years and that's what's most important here i'm just going to very quickly

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:51.420
add a few things it doesn't matter if you fight and say that the vaccine is bad

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:58.540
if you accept gain-of-function viruses it doesn't matter if you say that the lockdown hurt people

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.820
and you accept gain-of-function virus you're still stuck and so are your grandchildren

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:10.940
the only way out is to not accept the premise that a virus can be released from a point

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:18.060
and circle the globe for multiple years infecting millions killing millions it's just not possible

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:27.740
and so the scenario three that has emerged that emerged actually very early in 2020 already in the

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:34.220
background was this idea that there are no viruses at all and so this third scenario has

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:39.820
been trapping more and more people that i know based on what i've been saying because people have

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:45.500
started to say that looks like dr cooey doesn't believe in viruses anymore but that's so disingenuous

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:51.260
and so far from the truth it's frustrating but there are lots of people from the very beginning

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:57.420
that have been promoting a narrative of no virus at all and this is also a trap

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:04.380
so the fourth and final scenario is that it's previously in the endemic background so i hope

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:09.180
this comes out right in animation wise so that i can explain it as correct as possible

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:17.340
in the background at the start of the pandemic there were a number of known human coronaviruses

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:24.700
in addition there were a number of unknown human coronaviruses all of which were in circulation

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:29.580
all of which had a geographic organization to one another there might be different ones in

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:34.460
asia than there are in africa and there might be different variants in north america and south

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:40.780
america but there are human coronaviruses in circulation and many of them are related to sars

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:48.700
and the reason why is because the original sars pandemic in 2002 it didn't disappear

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:56.300
the lab releases that occurred in 2003 four six and nine didn't just disappear

01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:02.700
because we locked down or we controlled them and the countless number of lab leaks that have

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:08.940
occurred that have never made the newspapers have also not disappeared but rather have contributed

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:15.660
to the background coronavirus that causes unknown respiratory disease every year for millennia

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:26.540
on this background if you were to release a a infectious clone that was molecularly identical

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:33.340
in several places in the world and simultaneously told people how to test for it

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:43.580
you could claim that there was a pandemic occurring that release would create a very

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:51.580
brief period of time where the pink virus would be available and would produce positives on three

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:59.100
amplicons the end protein the RNA dependent polymerase and the spike but you would get many

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:05.260
false positives that would get you the end protein and the RNA dependent polymerase on

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:10.220
the bcr without triggering the spike because those were the background viruses that didn't

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:19.020
have this spike on it as a result false positives occurred depending on which test you used because

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:27.740
not all tests in 2020 required the spike many required two of three amplicons

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.380
so if you got the spike in the end you were positive if you got the spike and the

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:38.940
RNA dependent RNA polymerase you were positive and if you got the RNA dependent polymerase and the

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:45.020
end you were positive it depended on what product and it depended on what lab was running it

01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:51.900
the point is that at a certain moment in the pandemic it turned out that the pink virus was

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:58.540
gone but it doesn't matter you know why because they called omicron s protein drop out

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.860
so tests that no longer showed the spike protein but still tested positive for the

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:11.740
end and the RNA dependent polymerase were called covid-19 but they were actually

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:19.260
infections of the background coronaviruses that have those same homologous genes but not

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:27.260
the Wuhan spike and they very craftily knew that they could do this they very craftily knew

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:32.860
that this would work because they probably already knew the contents of this background

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:38.940
better than they let us on it's that simple because that's what leads us here to where there are

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:44.300
variants there's an infant story to tell and they can even say that the the countermeasure that

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:51.260
they rolled out forced these variants into existence it's a magic thing where what they did had

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:57.100
had consequences that could be viewed and measured around the world that's how spectacular their

01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:04.620
transfection is but what's unique about this hypothesis is that in this scenario PCR false

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:09.980
positives are not all false but a lot of the positives are just bringing up one of these other

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:15.580
viruses sequences reported that variants are real but not real variants of the Wuhan sequence

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:22.620
this is a very carefully controlled and tie rate titrated narrative about a very a virus that is

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:31.340
changing when we don't know we have no reason to doubt that they already knew this whole catalog

01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:35.900
at the start that they already knew what would be in the background and what they what sequences

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:41.260
they could bring out they could have already arranged them in the correct order so that as

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:46.380
the variants came out that the computers would all necessarily put them in the right file of

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:53.580
genetic order this would be trivial to orchestrate if this background existed and we know it does

01:33:54.380 --> 01:34:00.700
we absolutely positively know it does because before this that's what coronavirus people studied

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:06.780
now this signature was likely created by the deployment of an aerosolized RNA or DNA that

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:11.420
would cause consistent respiratory disease locally and then had a detectable molecular

01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:17.180
signature that could be identified as a coronavirus more importantly to understand if you are infected

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:22.860
with a clone you will have a different viral load than if you are infected with a natural virus if

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:28.220
I can just draw a cartoon on a piece of paper quick because I don't have a slide for this

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:35.180
um can you whoops that's not what I wanted can you see this Paul here yeah okay so

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.820
the thing that I want to explain is the idea of of what happens with a clone versus when you get

01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:48.300
infected with a natural virus so the the point is is that in both of these infections we're

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:55.020
going to get infected by 10 virins okay 10 virions that means 10 viral particles are going to infect

01:34:55.100 --> 01:35:01.340
this guy and 10 viral particles are going to infect this guy the star guy is going to be infected

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:08.540
with a natural virus 10 virins and this one's going to be infected with a clone so a natural

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:14.860
virus in this stupid scenario is a one to ten replication competent that means it's going to

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:22.300
make one two three four five six seven eight nine and one replication competent virion for every

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:28.540
ten that it makes and then a clone of course is going to be pure so one two three four five six

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:36.620
seven eight nine ten and they're all going to be replication competent but the point is is that

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:43.980
once the clone starts replicating in the infection or the natural virus starts replicating in the

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:49.740
infection then what we get afterward depends on the starting state if you start with a clone

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:57.020
and it replicates exactly the same as the natural virus once you release it then these 10 particles

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:08.860
10 will each make 10 copies of themselves but only one of those copies will be infectious

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:15.500
because they're replicating RNA so at the end of one round of replication in a clone infection

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:24.620
you will have I think this works out 90 non-infectious particles and you will have 10 plus 10

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:30.460
so you'll have 20 infectious particles because these 10 are here and you'll make 10 more

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:36.460
does that make sense if you start with a natural virus you're going to start with one two three

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:43.100
four five six seven eight nine plus one replicating virus and that replicating virus is going to make

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:50.220
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten nine imperfect copies of itself and one

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:56.540
perfect copy of itself so can you see why this infection isn't going to be very infectious why

01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:02.060
this infection isn't very dangerous why this infection would be really hard to culture from

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:07.740
but this infection would be a joke this infection would be easy to culture from and this infection

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:17.100
would be a very severe viral load upon the start it's totally different if you were exposed to

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:23.180
a bat cave you would be exposed to this ratio of particles if you were exposed to a clone

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:29.500
you're exposed to a hundred percent infectious particles and that difference extends into the

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:37.020
replication cycles and even in this simple experiment or example where I say that the replication

01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:43.260
competence is one to ten the reality is according to the paper we looked at that the replication

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:51.420
competence could be one in four hundred thousand and that difference means is that the vast majority

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:57.180
of the particles when you're sick that you cough out are immunogenic to the people in your family

01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:03.340
it will teach their immune system about the end protein and about the S protein and about the M

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.940
protein but it won't be replication competent so they'll get symptoms for a little while but

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:14.460
they won't get sick it's the reason why lots of people who had people in their house with the

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:22.540
original infection are also serum positive and this is the beauty of this is that you get to the

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:32.620
stage where you can see that this is mostly almost exclusively lying there's no there's no magic

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:39.180
virus there's no scary laboratories there's no bioterrorism there's no uncontrollable entity

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:47.500
there's no variables it's just very consistent lying and very consistent lying will create a

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:58.780
permanent bioterror bioweapon natural virus risk of a pandemic or that a super national organizations

01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:06.220
or set of organizations could govern the world on into infinity if we accept their cartoon biology

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:19.420
of how this works i think that's about the best summary i can do well another words j what you're

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:29.820
doing is um in your look we spoke before and i told you things that in a minute say what we said

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:37.980
on this call yeah maybe you're subsequent but first of all if if johnnie on his street johnnie

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:44.860
needs to see this a couple of times stuff because it's very shocking in other words because you're

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:50.380
gonna you are asking people to think in a completely not that johnnie on his street would

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:54.940
johnnie and she might understand this better than even medical doctors who actually have two hours of

01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:02.780
immunology and virology and vaccinology and even common sense so but the point i'm making is you

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:11.100
are actually saying what people like myself were arguing which is that from the get-go this was

01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:18.860
benign and mild mild enough this is my argument gee and tell me if it fits with your presentation

01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:27.420
that had we done nothing had we done nothing no lock thumbs no school clothes of nothing

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:36.700
just just isolate anybody who's really sick with symptoms no vaccine nothing no therapeutics

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:42.620
just make sure that people who develop pneumonia which which is most likely elderly people

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:51.260
etc got their antibiotics we have lost a vast vast number of fewer people in other words

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:58.140
every single thing that we did from lock thumbs to to to the therapeutics that we use to the

01:40:58.140 --> 01:41:03.580
vaccines and to how we treated people in the hospital setting which is the situation with

01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:09.740
my dazzle arm the lack of antibiotics they do not resuscitate the pump emitter gram decivir

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:16.940
the ventilation etc the toxic drugs the isolation that is what killed our people not

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:24.620
this benign virus as you just explained it am i correct i i i you're nine nine nine nine nine

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:29.420
percent there in the sense of i do think that that we have to keep

01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:40.860
open the possibility that they that the clone uh molecular entity that they use to create the

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:49.020
signal that molecular biologists and hospitals experienced around the world which is symptomology

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:58.060
and you know culturable virus um was done with a clone and so that means that as i drew in that

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:03.420
picture the people that were infected with the clone or near the release point were likely

01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:09.740
experiencing a very severe respiratory disease but that respiratory disease did not have the

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:16.460
capability of propagating around the world from any of those points and that's what we need to see

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.980
why wasn't the southern why wasn't it two weeks later that hospitals in the south of Italy had

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:26.460
exactly the same as what they had in northern nearly why didn't that happen it's not because

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.820
of lockdown because that's not how viruses work those people were on the train those people were

01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:39.260
going back and forth but somehow where these extremely sharp peaks of death like in new york

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:45.660
city in the beginning happened probably happened where the clone was released and so if my hypothesis

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:55.020
correct then the reason why these early treatments like hydroxychloroquine or ibramectin early in 2020

01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:02.460
were so effective is because where they were being given to people that hadn't a unnatural

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:09.500
viral load that could only be generated by exposure to a clone and that's what makes this very tricky

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:17.020
yeah in other words that's where we back it up to what we're seeing you were right and you were

01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:23.660
wrong and that's what you were trying to see yes we are not coming out we're trying to get people

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:28.700
to think in a different way to appear as you say behind the curtain we're not saying that you

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:35.740
were wrong so in other words what you are just said is early treatment hydroxy ibramectin the

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:43.420
the that mccollinies people fashioned you know multi-sequence combined antivirals corticosteroids

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:53.100
etc had has its place in these types of respiratory illnesses but for most severe illness in other

01:43:53.100 --> 01:44:00.060
words if i am if i'm trying to understand what these slides are showing and what the argument

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:10.940
here is and what what we are asking people to think about is that benign more low level non-consequential

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:24.540
infection cannot really respond to early treatment it may be a wash in other words you know it may

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:30.140
be a wash yes that's what i'm trying to see and and that is why when we say that the vaccine

01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:42.940
cannot work did not work it's in other words if i even back it up one more step what i'm saying

01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:50.780
the one thing that we did here for sure was take lives with the treatment of people and bringing

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:57.900
this gene injection that is seemingly killing people in other words again had we done nothing

01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:04.700
the early treatment have its place and role yet for initial release of clones direct

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:15.580
clue serious serious virus am i i'm trying to just put my yeah so remember that one of the

01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:20.300
arguments i am trying to make or i'll bring it up again not remember i don't want to sound

01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:26.860
condescending it's a lot of disparate ideas that the purity of the virus is more important

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:33.740
than the content of it so they want you to believe that a particular combination of genes

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:42.060
or a particular inserted sequence on a particular spike protein can result in a in a in a

01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:49.180
in a virus that's now capable of producing a pandemic where without that little gene or

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:57.980
without that little insert it wasn't it was just a normal one and this is a is a shiny object

01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:02.780
that they can talk very complicated about and give you all kinds of papers that show that this

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:07.660
particular sequence is really important in this experiment and blah blah blah blah but what they're

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:15.740
talking around is the the what i would argue is the real problem that if you make a pure version

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:23.340
of any of these corona viruses and make it in sufficient quantities then someone who gets

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:32.940
infected with that pure viral swarm will have a noticeably more severe respiratory infection

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:39.740
with a noticeably higher viral load than can be created if you stumble into a bat cave and get

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:48.300
sick and that's because the clone is so pure and so replication competent that it can create

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:56.460
a level of virus replication that's not it doesn't exist in nature if a regular natural virus produces

01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:03.340
one in ten and a clone starts out ten for ten then you are really in trouble if you get in

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:10.220
think of it this way paul if you go out into the sandbox behind your house there is a small

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.700
quantity of uranium and no matter how much you pound on that sand with a hammer it's never

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:23.820
going to result in a nuclear explosion but if you take enough dirt from your backyard and you take

01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:29.260
all the uranium out of it and you put it in one tiny little place you can create a little nuclear

01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:37.900
bomb it is the purity of the virus that they create with infectious clones that cannot even

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:45.260
doesn't it cannot exist in nature and when they release it it exponentially reverts back to this

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:52.700
non-infectious particles swarm and so it's only at these points of release where the biology

01:47:52.700 --> 01:48:01.900
and the math and the epidemiology can add up to this supremely uniform molecular signature this

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:11.740
is the part where most of the mystery gets solved because there's just no way for a virus to to

01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:17.180
to make as many perfect copies of itself as would be required for the story on television

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:26.860
in other words what you're saying is based on how virus operates in the natural environment in the

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:35.980
wild and let's say let's even use that to a mule's ratchet that over time viruses would in their

01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:42.700
replication in the mutations that are coming would mutate downwards into less less lethal

01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:51.100
mowing factors but less pathological versions that's what you're arguing that that left

01:48:51.100 --> 01:49:02.300
in its own that's where we're going to go and if we accept that this was a release of using let's

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:11.980
use it to impure if I clone yes initially that with time the virus would settle down and become

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:18.460
behave like how it should but that initial release likely across the world simultaneously

01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:26.300
or near simultaneously those people who were exposed in the initial waves were the people

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:34.140
who suffered pathology and were our loved ones who died yes but subsequent subsequent to that

01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:43.180
people died principally because of the lockdowns how we treated them within the medical system

01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:51.340
and now this devastating vaccine that we brought that was to me never needed no I think actually if

01:49:51.340 --> 01:50:01.180
you look at the the immunology of it and realize that that the other implication of the hypothesis

01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:09.100
that we're currently discussing is that vaccination to a structural protein of a coronavirus could

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:18.540
interfere with our previously existing immunity to the endemic background and what they may have done

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:26.540
with the people that took the shot is taken their very strong innate and acquired immunity

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:32.700
developed over their whole life to the background coronaviruses and reset it or

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:39.500
or augmented it in a way that doesn't help them in the future and this has been seen with other

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:47.340
viruses when you vaccinate people against dengue fever or a yellow dengue fever and you vaccinate

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:54.780
them with the with the attenuated or weakened virus they make antibodies to the structural protein

01:50:55.340 --> 01:51:01.340
and those antibodies end up making the next infection much worse and the inflammation

01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:07.180
response to the next infection much worse and so there's a possibility that when a lot of people

01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:13.260
are experiencing is that the whatever happened in terms of augmenting their immune system by

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:21.100
exposing them to lots and lots of this imperfect spike protein product has caused their natural

01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:28.140
immune memory to the background coronaviruses to fail and that's why a lot of these people

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:32.620
are getting sick that's why they're getting repeatedly infected you don't have to say they're

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:37.180
getting repeatedly infected with covid they're just getting infected again and it's because

01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:42.140
their immune system is no longer functioning normally other than that i don't know what to say

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:48.380
other than their immune system is not functioning normally my kids haven't been sick really this

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:55.820
school year but um they have friends who are who are twice injected that their mom laughs

01:51:55.820 --> 01:52:00.940
about how often they have to stay at home and they went from strep to something else to something

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:06.780
else and you can just shake your head and say i told you not to do this but people are going to

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:15.980
have to learn that that we have very good understanding of what um what limitations there are to how

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:22.620
we can augment the adult immune system and the kid immune system and we have just thrown all

01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:28.700
of this basic understanding out the window when it comes to vaccines in america and as a result

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:35.420
unfortunately a lot of the other western nations are more or less following behind they're not nearly

01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:43.180
as bad um but the vaccine industry in america is is is just a farce i mean we already know that

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:47.340
it's a farce well j two things quick i want to mention

01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:58.140
findin bosh one yes i'll ask i'll ask you a question too i'll mention um the uk in the report 42

01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:03.180
i'm trying to remember it exactly because there's so many like yourself papers always in our head

01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:09.900
there was one i think report 42 in um 2022 earlier on march and they stopped reporting

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:16.620
and in the report 42 they said that something unique and it was one line hidden deep inside

01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:23.980
of that report that was showing that you vaccinated are actually second and second shot third shot

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:30.940
will become more infected than you unvaccinated but it was a line that was inserted in the in

01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:37.740
the discussion section that unless you found it it was in fine print they said that persons who got

01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:44.300
two shots and then were infected they found that they were not producing end protein

01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:54.060
an antibody that's correct and that that gets yes that's a huge huge evidence it's a huge

01:53:54.700 --> 01:54:00.220
it's a huge red flag again because what they argue is that they've augmented your natural

01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:05.740
immune response and it turns out that at least from a seroprevalence perspective the strongest

01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:11.660
signal in a natural infection is the end protein which if i can remind you what we just

01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:17.900
looked at please remember that this all matches up perfectly if we look at this old paper

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:24.540
ah no that's not the right slide all on one second let me just move it uh if we look at this

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:32.300
old paper here and we look at the the data from their their gel get up here and get it in here

01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:39.260
you can see that already back way back when they've looked at this and the largest portion of RNA

01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:48.700
that's produced during a clone infection in a dish is the end protein RNA that means there is no

01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:55.900
doubt that the most abundant protein in an affected cell is the end protein so it makes perfect sense

01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:02.860
given their own data that the first and most prevalent immune response to this would be the

01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:09.260
end protein here's the problem though Paul the end protein is a highly conserved protein across

01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:15.420
lots of corona viruses because it is the protein around which the genomic RNA is purported to be

01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:22.620
wrapped so if you change that protein too much it won't be able to not up the the RNA in a correct

01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:29.660
way to make the packaging go so the end protein almost can't change so if they made you uh if

01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:35.500
they forced you or or suggested to vaccinate you against that that would have actually maybe been

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:42.700
a very good target for a one shot shot but they knew that they knew that that's been already

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:48.220
discussed a long time ago they've tried the end the the homologous protein of the end protein

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:53.020
with AIDS it's not a suitable target for immunization either that's just already been tested

01:55:54.860 --> 01:56:00.860
it's terrible yeah but i mean it's i mean to a non-birologist like myself

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:06.620
when i look at it i would ask myself for immunologist i would say why then

01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:12.940
looking even though you say it's not a good target they actually chose the most unstable

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:19.500
mutable portion of the virus to pose as a target so it's almost as though jay it was designed to

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:26.060
fail yes yes i totally agree with that it that it was it was designed to because they could get

01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:32.540
more shots in arms they could get they could justify it they could explain the the evolution

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:39.580
of the virus it's all part of the planned story but i think you if you could go back and do the drawing

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:46.700
again because i think in presenting this as the first salvo is the first salvo people need to

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:52.380
understand that concentration of purity that you argued about can you go back with a clean

01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:58.780
pH again sure sure no problem i'll draw it a little better that is what the late person needs

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:04.940
to wrap there because your whole theory this whole theory spins on this issue here

01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:10.300
so i'm going to just draw the same thing with squares these are two people

01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:17.180
um this is a dude here and this is a dude here so the star guy is his lungs are going to be

01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:23.180
infected with a clone and the circle guy is going to be infected with a natural virus

01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:31.820
so the first posit here is that a natural virus when it makes copies of itself it makes

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:36.860
imperfect copies of itself and all virology understands this all virology calls these

01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:43.980
non-infectious particles or defective viral particles something like that and so for the

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:50.700
purpose of this illustration we are going to use a ratio of one to ten meaning that when it

01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:57.660
makes a copy of itself nine copies will be non-replication competent they will be erroneous

01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:02.540
they'll missing something they didn't copy perfectly and so they're not good enough

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:08.540
to make another person sick but one will be a perfect copy we'll color that one in

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:13.820
that one has all the genes necessary to go on and infect another person it might even be better

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:19.260
than the original virus like a new variant but the rest of these can't do anything other than

01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:27.340
irritate the lungs of anybody that they get into now if we make a clone of this wild virus

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:31.340
what we're going to do is we're going to make a DNA copy of it

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:40.460
right we're going to make a DNA copy of it and that DNA copy we can grow up lots of copies of it

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:50.460
in a bottle with bacteria in it and that results in many many many copies of the same RNA

01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:57.260
after we're done with it and so that means rather than getting infected with a natural virus

01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:03.580
we can put as many perfect copies of the virus as we want into our our experimental animal or in

01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:10.300
this case our experimental person so and to make these similar and to understand the difference

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:16.460
between a natural infection and a clone infection we're going to use 10 particles so we're going to go

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:28.380
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten for these particles here being in our friend

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:36.620
the circle and then we're going to take 10 cloned particles that we grew in a dish after we

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:44.700
exposed the dish to the RNA that we made from copies of DNA so perfect copies of this virus

01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:51.020
we took this virus alone this sequence and we made lots of copies of it so this guy gets 10

01:59:51.020 --> 02:00:01.020
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and this is the difference because now we're

02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:07.260
going to go through one cycle of replication meaning that all the all the viruses that can copy

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:15.100
will copy themselves and they will copy themselves in the normal way that the RNA will copy it's

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:20.940
RNA it can't be perfect it's perfect when it's DNA you can make as many copies as you want here

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:26.300
when it's in the in the bacteria and they'll all be perfect or really close to perfect but once

02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:34.860
you translate them into RNA and let the RNA go into your dish or your RNA be passaghed or your RNA

02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:42.220
go into a person or in an animal then it's RNA copying RNA and so then it's going to go revert

02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:49.500
back to the normal ratio of 10 to 1 so then what happens in the first round of replication well

02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:59.500
you get 90 non-replicating particles because each one of these will make 10 nine that can't

02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:05.740
copy and one that can so out of all these 10 there will be 90 that cannot copy that's the open

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:15.180
circle and there will be 10 that can copy themselves so in total after one round of replication in

02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:24.780
this person's imaginary lungs there are 110 particles 20 of which are replication competent

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:34.940
particles and 90 are non-replication competent and all of those can irritate your kids all of

02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:40.700
those can irritate your grandparents all of these can cause new infection in anyone that they get

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:50.780
into now let's look at the natural infection well it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:57.260
after one round of infection in the natural infection most of the particles here are not

02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:04.380
infectious only two of them is infectious most important thing to understand is that this guy is

02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:13.100
only fighting against two infected actively infected cells whereas after one round of replication in

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:21.980
the lungs of a clone infection up to 20 different cells are now making viruses it is a step up

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:32.620
from the natural infection by at least 10 fold and now this is on the very simple math of one for

02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:42.940
every 10 is infectious and what I'm trying to argue is that the the slides and the papers that

02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:49.260
we have looked at suggest and maybe this is maybe the slide that I should use suggest

02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:57.500
that hundreds of thousands of RNAs of the m protein are made hundreds of thousands of the

02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:04.860
m protein hundreds of thousands of the e protein are made all of which could potentially be packaged

02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:14.780
as as as non-replication competent variants because they're RNA they're doing something they're

02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:20.620
in the sample they're measuring them they're counting them as present how else can we explain

02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:27.500
the non-infectious particles if we look further for the long form RNAs they found two

02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:35.740
so for me the best explanation would be go back one slide and say well the ratio of

02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:45.180
n protein containing particles to full genome containing particles is somewhere between 100,000

02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:54.860
to 1 and 500,000 to 1 that changes our little our little calculation on the paper an awful lot

02:03:54.860 --> 02:04:06.060
if a natural infection is one out of 100,000 and a clone is one for one now we have a very very

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:14.940
big problem because a natural coronavirus infection is a viral load with a ratio of one to 100,000

02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:22.540
and we know how to fight that we have normal immune responses to it we have normal inflammatory

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:31.420
responses to it what happens yes but what happens if we are infected with a pure infectious clone

02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:38.940
where the ratio at the start of the infection is one to one now we have a very big problem

02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:46.860
because that means that instead of instead of inhaling a cloud that will only actually irritate

02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:53.820
a lot of cells and infect a couple you inhale a cloud that will infect every cell that it interacts

02:04:53.820 --> 02:05:00.060
with and irritate every cell that it interacts with and that is the exponential difference

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:07.980
between sorry a clone infection and oh yeah I got to escape out of there and and what we were talking

02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:14.860
about is a natural swarm infection and and keep in mind that that everywhere in every laboratory

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:19.820
they are using infectious clones so everywhere that you would get infected in a laboratory you're

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:26.780
going to get infected with a clone not with a natural swarm this this increases the danger of

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:33.020
laboratory work but it actually also shifts it completely away from what they told you it was

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:39.260
which is these people making unique combinations it has very little to do with the unique combinations

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:46.940
and much more to do with the pure nature of of these clones that's where the danger is and maybe

02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:55.980
even worse that's where their utility is the only way that they could usefully convert a harmless

02:05:55.980 --> 02:06:03.580
background of coronaviruses into something that they could monetize and govern us about forever

02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:13.020
is to make us believe that that very safe and and and and and and uh friendly background of

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:19.900
coronavirus is actually a very dangerous set of pathogens that is even more dangerous because

02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:25.500
there are people like peter desak tweaking around with genes and making combinations that wouldn't

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:32.220
exist in nature and it completely distracts you from the fact that the real danger is that they make

02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:41.420
these high purity DNA derived versions of these RNA viruses and if once you understand that then

02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:47.820
you can see that the biology of those RNA viruses is not high enough fidelity it is not

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:53.740
robust enough to produce the pandemic that they've told us it is produced

02:06:53.740 --> 02:07:08.300
so nothing worked because nothing could work yeah something like that indeed are very

02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:17.180
you know like um this this conversation has gone on for longer and i know you allowed me to

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:27.260
sit in and just ask question but for the second um segment would you be allowing the other

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:35.500
participants to ask questions and also um when would we have the second uh what would be where

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:43.740
would we go yet how could we move forward with this um the second one could be a little bit more

02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:49.020
in depth and cover some questions that people can send to you or me in the next 24 hours

02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:56.380
for example another thing that we can focus on is right now we didn't really talk about the

02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:03.580
immunology at all we could do a very brief overview about the real response to a respiratory virus and

02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:09.420
why seroprevalence and antibodies are a distraction which is something that i think everybody should

02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:14.380
understand you shouldn't take my word for it and so i that could be a really good subject

02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:20.540
actually is just do the basic response to a respiratory disease and and uh what we knew before

02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:25.980
2020 and then how they've told us you know that this these products are supposed to work so that's

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:34.940
another thing we could discuss is transfection and why uh why the why i call it a transfection why

02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:40.780
everybody should call it a transfection and why you should be very suspicious of transfection being

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:47.500
used in animals that are supposed to live for 20 more years um i think that might be a couple

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:54.940
good things to hit in other words jay i agree with you so maybe even if not Friday to be as

02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:59.820
Wednesday tomorrow might be difficult you know we could even find time over the weekend i don't

02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:04.780
know if you're cool i'm always not i i meet whenever i meet where you tell me the time and i

02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:14.300
will fire this up i could make myself available Saturday or Sunday and um i like that i like that

02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:20.780
topic and and the way what i'm suggesting is because because i myself want to share this across all

02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:26.460
the groups i'm working with to begin this come because you have i think the main message here is

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:33.900
nobody is right and nobody is wrong and we have to be able to be adults in this discussion or

02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:41.260
we are we are scientists we are we are doctors we are we are the public the public actually is

02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:46.700
more advanced than scientists to me but we are people who are thinking all of us the public all

02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:52.940
of us together we are part of humanity we are part of this society so let's not put distinctions

02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:59.420
behind us here but we are so grateful i'm so grateful but somebody like you amongst other

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:05.500
people that i have known but you have you have you have explained something that is

02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:12.380
that is so very complicated yet so elegant is simple because because you did not overwhelm

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:17.580
our still listener and i guess a lot of your people who follow you are sophisticated

02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:23.900
biochemists and all sorts of different things um skill sets i mean but you did not try to do

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:30.220
that here you're trying to make people understand your thinking you may not be you're not trying

02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:38.460
to force it than anyone you're asking people to think right absolutely i i just i can't stress

02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:44.460
enough you give me the time i'll schedule it i'll blast it out and on the meantime i'm gonna take

02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:49.260
this video and cut all the nonsense out of the beginning and shorten some of the things that i

02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:53.900
just to make sure it's it's crystal and then we'll put that up on youtube and bit shooting

02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.540
everywhere else in a couple hours can you well let me ask you a question can you also give me

02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:04.140
all of the when you take all the edges that you say like they are chatting you know whatever

02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:09.340
doesn't matter to me but it could stay but can you give me a copy because i like of course yes

02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:17.580
absolutely so yeah that's gab twitter everywhere absolutely so but what i'm saying is what you're

02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:25.260
trying to say is that um we need to figure out what really went wrong here because lots went wrong

02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:31.900
and at the end of the day we have a reported one million people in america died alone and the

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:38.540
question is really we need to know how much of that was from real virus and we are beginning to

02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:47.740
argue not that appreciable portion many people we can't discount it this virus this whatever it was

02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:58.060
was devastating to some very vulnerable people no doubt but what we begin to argue is that

02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:04.380
is that the things that went wrong here need a real serious sophisticated thinking now

02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:11.100
with a very elegant explanation but it's sophisticated that you that you willing to step back and say

02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:18.540
you know what my preconceived notions of what happened was wrong oh it's it it it now it has

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:25.100
been updated and i have to be willing to consider at least consider what j is saying what we are

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:31.180
trying to argue because i'm in this discussion with you because i actually accept in total

02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:38.940
what we are seeing i mean they have questions here and there but with all that i've been through

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:45.100
and see and know and read and i'm heavily read in the area i think this is one of the most logical

02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:52.940
explanations because we are trying to make sense of what the hell happened and nothing makes sense

02:12:53.740 --> 02:13:00.540
but this explanation does far and if we can evolve it more and but not any edges and stuff

02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:08.940
i think i think that you have a very very cogent argument to be needed and um we have to get it

02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:14.380
out there i love it i love it do you mind if i quickly before you go play that video that i

02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:21.260
played for you of dr g or donald explaining how he would do it in 2017 okay just going to end on

02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:26.940
that and then we'll we'll be ready for the next one early but i want is high morbidity i want

02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:32.300
people to complain so what do i do i go to demoy ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen i

02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:36.700
have nothing against demoy and i live there for four years i go to demoy i infect a couple of

02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:44.380
sentinel cases in demoy i go to seattle i infect a couple of cases there i go to north carolina i

02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:50.700
go to wisconsin what i'm doing is i'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases

02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:56.060
with a highly morbid condition these individuals complain again this is a central nervous system

02:13:56.060 --> 02:14:01.180
condition so they're complaining of whatever the bug may do it'll produce some cascade of

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:07.260
neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms and then what i do the real bug that i use

02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:11.900
is the internet i take attribution for that yes i'm a terrorist group

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.860
and i have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:23.500
lethality are x y and z these people are really sick with this but then i say others who are also

02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:29.820
infected will show subdramal pre-dram signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety

02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:36.860
sleeplessness agitation what i've now done is i've got every individual who is diagnostically

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:41.900
hypochondriacal and i've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system

02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:48.860
banging on the door the cdc comes back and says nonsense that's not real i come back and say

02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:57.340
that's fake news and as i just want to say that the chat is thanking you profusely for coming

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:04.940
they hope that you will come back and i know you will i can't thank you enough you like a new

02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:11.340
brother i have from another mother i love it i love it i'm so grateful for you joining me

02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:16.060
i think it's good to cut it off sharp here and just try to find a time when we can do it again

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:21.420
very soon and promise me that you will yes part two and i'll be here we just need to

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:27.100
spend a long time on the weekend please we can't we can't let too much time go and when we start

02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:33.660
the next show if you could jay because this is really your and i want to put you out there i want

02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:41.660
to make you center stage this is can you do a quick five-minute recap first of the first show

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:46.860
so that so that so the people we could then hit the floor running again at bill absolutely right

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:53.580
i we will do it yes thank you sir thank you very much thank you to all your listeners for

02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:59.820
bearing with me thank you bearing with me he says can you believe what just happened

02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:03.100
can you believe what just happened

02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:11.100
Paul Elias Alexander was on the stream and we discussed the basic big ideas of an endemic

02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:20.140
background and of a SARS infectious clone being used to see the idea of a pandemic he really likes

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:26.700
it he follows it well this is something that we need to push forward so if you want to help

02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:33.260
and you never did before please sign up for twitter and share it put it on facebook

02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:40.140
send it everywhere in a few minutes i'll have it up on vimeo where i can put a link on my it will

02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:45.580
be on the first video on gig home biological and then you can also use that to link it to places

02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:49.900
and then i'll try to get something up on bit shoot and rumble and stuff after

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:54.780
the afternoon i have a meeting with the writing team so i'm not sure if it'll be until three

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:57.900
but all of this is planned we're going forward and you heard

02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:05.260
Dr. Alexander he's coming back for sure so get ready get fired up i told you that we weren't messing

02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:11.420
around i told you that we were going to do something serious this is it so again thank you very

02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:15.900
much for joining me this is getting a gig home biological high resistance low noise information

02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:20.700
stream brought to you by a biologist i can't thank all my subscribers and supporters and

02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:27.020
people to share my work enough we are finally starting to make progress i feel a real kind

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:32.540
of momentum here and i hope you do too i hope you're as excited as me i don't know if i'm going to

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:40.540
see you until tonight um in fact tonight i the the talk that i'm giving at at eight will not be

02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:46.460
streamed but the the clubhouse meeting at four will be streamed so i guess i'll see you at four

02:17:46.460 --> 02:18:02.380
thanks for coming and i'll see you guys again soon

02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:30.860
so

02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:49.460
So that was the name of the mysterious bear.

02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:51.460
It turned out she was holding.

02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:54.460
I had to tell so many stories about them,

02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.460
so many rumors.

02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:02.460
I thought someone told me that they had a talking bear.

02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:05.460
I thought the bear would never speak it.

02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:21.460
