WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
for the purposes he's Stephen here yet where is he he knows we get underway at

00:08.760 --> 00:16.720
five past on the dock he'll he'll come he'll join us all right everybody welcome

00:16.720 --> 00:22.360
to medical doctors for COVID ethics international and today's discussion

00:22.360 --> 00:26.440
this group is found about Dr. Stephen Frost during the darkest days of the

00:26.440 --> 00:32.200
COVID scam response with a desire to pursue truth ethics justice freedom and

00:32.200 --> 00:36.400
health. Stephen has stood up against government and power over the years

00:36.400 --> 00:40.080
and have been a whistleblower and activist his medical specialist radiology

00:40.080 --> 00:43.920
I'm Charles Cobess the moderator of the group I'm Australasia's passion

00:43.920 --> 00:48.920
provocateur I practiced law for 20 years before changing career 30 years ago and

00:48.920 --> 00:52.160
over the last 13 years I've helped parents and lawyers strategize remedies

00:52.160 --> 00:57.200
for vaccine damage and damage from bad medical advice the latest numbers we've

00:57.200 --> 01:02.960
heard is that is that bad medical advice is now the number one killer in

01:02.960 --> 01:08.120
America I'm also the CEO of an industrial hemp company we comprise lots of

01:08.120 --> 01:12.480
professions here and we're from all around the world many of us thought

01:12.480 --> 01:17.120
that vaccines were okay now many of us proudly say yes we are passionate anti

01:17.120 --> 01:22.320
vexes if this is your first time here welcome and feel free to introduce yourself

01:22.320 --> 01:26.080
at the chat in the chat and where you're from if you publish a newsletter or

01:26.080 --> 01:29.960
podcast or you have a radio or TV show or you've written a book put the links

01:29.960 --> 01:33.960
into the chat so we can follow you promote you and find you and even if

01:33.960 --> 01:37.800
you've done it last week or the week before he putting it into the chat to

01:37.800 --> 01:41.600
make it easy for people to find most of us understand we're in the middle of

01:41.600 --> 01:46.600
World War three and there are various battle lines as part of this war most

01:46.640 --> 01:50.360
of us understand the development of science and that the science is never

01:50.360 --> 01:54.920
settled and then if someone tells you the science is settled you know you're

01:54.920 --> 02:01.240
dealing with a fraud or an idiot some of us believe that viruses exist some of

02:01.240 --> 02:04.840
us believe that viruses are a hoax and some of us are on the fence on the matter

02:04.840 --> 02:08.240
this meeting runs for two and a half hours after which for those with the

02:08.240 --> 02:12.960
time Tom Rodman runs a video telegram meeting Tom puts the links into the

02:12.960 --> 02:18.080
chat if you're able to join we will listen to JJ Kui our guest presenter

02:18.080 --> 02:21.360
for as long as JJ wishes to speak and then we have Q&A there's the third time

02:21.360 --> 02:25.800
that JJ has joined us his previous presentations are available on the

02:25.800 --> 02:29.920
rumble channel Stephen Frost by Longestubbies tradition asked the first

02:29.920 --> 02:34.280
questions for 15 minutes there's no censorship it's a free speech environment

02:34.280 --> 02:40.320
free speech is crucially important in our fight to preserve our human freedoms

02:40.800 --> 02:44.560
if you're offended by anything be offended we're genuinely not interested

02:44.560 --> 02:48.880
we reject the offense industry that requires nobody to say anything that

02:48.880 --> 02:53.360
may offend another I have a standard template of nine potential answers to

02:53.360 --> 02:57.160
somebody who says I'm offended if you want that template put a note in the

02:57.160 --> 03:01.680
chat I'll email it to you it's very useful be ready with your response when

03:01.680 --> 03:06.280
someone says to you I'm offended and also what's Ricky Gervais if you ever

03:06.280 --> 03:12.760
want to be amused by people who claim to be offended we come with an attitude

03:12.760 --> 03:17.400
and perspective of love not fear fear is the opposite of love fear squashes you

03:17.400 --> 03:22.320
love on the other hand expands you we talked before we started we're talking

03:22.320 --> 03:28.560
about Gandhi you know the game plan clearly has to be non-violent non-compliance

03:28.560 --> 03:34.960
with bad government behavior these twice weekly meetings are not just

03:34.960 --> 03:38.480
talk fest an extraordinary range of actions and initiatives have been

03:38.480 --> 03:43.120
generated from linkages made by attendees in these meetings if you have a

03:43.120 --> 03:46.760
solution or product or links or resources that will help you with the details in

03:46.760 --> 03:50.800
the chat the meeting is recorded and he's uploaded on the rumble channel and

03:50.800 --> 03:55.400
they're welcome to our guest presenter Jonathan J. Curie globally

03:55.400 --> 04:00.320
renowned genius and thank you J. J. for giving us your time wisdom and

04:00.320 --> 04:04.560
insights again and thank you Stephen Frost for creating the group and for

04:04.560 --> 04:10.040
organizing JJ to speak to us JJ we are in your hands there Stephen

04:10.040 --> 04:14.080
arrived and there's JJ thanks for coming to speak to us you're very

04:14.080 --> 04:18.360
welcome thank you all for taking the time to listen I'm gonna try and go as

04:18.360 --> 04:22.520
quick as I can because I know that you've heard me before and there's a lot of

04:22.520 --> 04:27.360
buzz about different recent conversations I've had include including one with

04:27.360 --> 04:30.920
Wolfgang Wodach and so it might be that I cover the wrong things here and so I'm

04:30.960 --> 04:35.360
gonna try and fly through it but please keep in mind that I've done a

04:35.360 --> 04:39.200
presentation like this enough so you know I can handle an interruption and it

04:39.200 --> 04:42.680
might be easier if you interrupt when the question is relevant for everybody

04:42.680 --> 04:48.600
rather than waiting until the end and so barring any you know if it becomes a

04:48.600 --> 04:51.400
thousand questions obviously it's probably not good but occasionally I

04:51.400 --> 04:58.400
don't mind at all I need to say well let's JJ I'm happy to do that so

04:58.400 --> 05:03.520
everybody so today because JJ has been with us so many times we'll do it

05:03.520 --> 05:09.680
unusually so if you want to ask a question JJ it's good you watch the

05:09.680 --> 05:14.280
screen JJ if you see your hand come up you know stop when you stop talking and

05:14.280 --> 05:18.200
handle that question does it make sense it does accept all the magic that I have

05:18.200 --> 05:22.800
it makes it very hard for me to watch the zoom so I can't really look at all

05:22.800 --> 05:27.080
handle the hands up okay just put your hands up if you have a question pertinent

05:27.080 --> 05:30.760
to that issue and then at the end when JJ finishes then do we do the normal

05:30.760 --> 05:36.440
price yes fantastic JJ how many times have you spoken to us is it three or

05:36.440 --> 05:40.760
more than three this this could be the fourth time I think so this could be the

05:40.760 --> 05:46.440
fourth time I'm gonna borrow I'm gonna borrow a starting slide from my friend

05:46.440 --> 05:51.240
Vera Sharav I think Edward Bernese's statement is very important here the

05:51.240 --> 05:54.760
conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of

05:54.760 --> 05:58.920
the masses there's an important element in democratic society and those who

05:58.920 --> 06:03.000
manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible

06:03.000 --> 06:07.720
government which is the true ruling power of our country and maybe now with the

06:07.720 --> 06:12.760
internet and with the who and other organizations around public health it

06:12.760 --> 06:17.760
may be that this may be the mechanism by which they plan to rule our global

06:17.760 --> 06:22.040
society and I want to start here all the time just to bring everybody up to

06:22.040 --> 06:26.280
speed I apologize if it's a bothersome thing for those of you outside of the

06:26.280 --> 06:31.400
the UK but I've been trying to explain that we've been fooled into solving a

06:31.400 --> 06:35.320
mystery and I use the example of a cartoon show from the United States

06:35.320 --> 06:40.680
called Scooby-Doo where teenagers solve a mystery every week in the town that

06:40.680 --> 06:44.760
they're driving through and it inevitably involves a monster that needs to have

06:44.760 --> 06:48.520
its mask removed and then the bad guys revealed to be someone that was earlier

06:48.520 --> 06:53.560
in the show what I am suggesting here and something that I want to be very

06:53.560 --> 06:57.560
clear about is it's not in 2020 that this started

06:57.560 --> 07:03.160
but it started a much longer time ago with the co-opting of certain

07:03.160 --> 07:07.720
investigative lines in in primary literature in biology

07:07.720 --> 07:12.760
and so by carefully co-opting certain narratives into the biological

07:12.760 --> 07:19.800
literature and importantly funding investigation into certain ideas in the

07:19.800 --> 07:24.600
primary literature you can seed a series of papers over a series of years that

07:24.600 --> 07:29.480
can imply a danger that's not there it can imply a link that's not there one of

07:29.480 --> 07:35.560
the most spectacular ones from my own field is the preponderance of literature

07:35.560 --> 07:38.920
that's looking at correlations between genes

07:38.920 --> 07:43.880
and autism and often in animal models of autism

07:43.880 --> 07:47.720
and so after many years of funding this kind of research we have

07:47.720 --> 07:53.720
a whole a whole foundation by which anyone who wants to justify the further

07:53.720 --> 07:57.800
investigation into the genetic causes of autism can simply cite all of these

07:57.800 --> 08:01.480
hundreds of papers and build their grand proposal from there

08:01.480 --> 08:05.640
so it's a very dangerous sort of environment in which this this

08:05.640 --> 08:09.880
pseudo-intellectual pursuit occurs because you can't just ask any question

08:09.880 --> 08:13.000
you want you've got to ask a question for which you can get funding

08:13.000 --> 08:16.360
and oftentimes the way that academic biology makes

08:16.360 --> 08:20.920
progress is dictated solely by what questions they're allowed to ask and

08:20.920 --> 08:25.560
with response with regard to RNA viruses that

08:25.560 --> 08:29.960
that general academic pursuit has been hyper controlled for a very long time

08:29.960 --> 08:33.720
and I think if you reflect on all the people that are in involved in

08:33.800 --> 08:37.880
virology and how virology from AIDS onward

08:37.880 --> 08:42.200
has been let's say scripted you can see that there's some

08:42.200 --> 08:46.440
incongruency between the real biology that we can verify and the real biology

08:46.440 --> 08:50.840
that they claim at the same time of course they've been running tabletop

08:50.840 --> 08:56.040
exercises the most famous of one is the most famous example of one

08:56.040 --> 08:59.960
is event 201 but of course we can go back decades and see that there were many

08:59.960 --> 09:04.840
tabletop exercises looking at bioterrorism

09:04.840 --> 09:08.760
what could be done and what could happen now the trick

09:08.760 --> 09:13.400
with this is to understand number three is to understand that they have

09:13.400 --> 09:17.640
gained this out on a table and they've actually run it live before

09:17.640 --> 09:21.560
there was a swine pandemic in swine flu pandemic in

09:21.560 --> 09:27.000
1976 that was part of this there was one in 2009 that was part of this that

09:27.000 --> 09:30.520
afterward was analyzed over and over again especially from different

09:30.520 --> 09:34.440
country's perspectives and how the language barrier in a place like

09:34.440 --> 09:37.160
Belgium played a huge role in the uptake of the

09:37.160 --> 09:43.560
vaccine they analyzed this like a a post-war analysis of the battle plan

09:43.560 --> 09:47.000
and lamented about the fact that they didn't have the kind of social media

09:47.000 --> 09:50.280
reach in 2009 that they have now and that maybe they would have been more

09:50.280 --> 09:55.720
successful in the Flanders section of Belgium the french speaking part

09:55.720 --> 09:59.960
had they been able to to work into that language a little better

09:59.960 --> 10:04.360
all of these things have been gained in such a way so that this time around

10:04.360 --> 10:09.240
the actual presentation of the narrative at the very beginning was hyper-controlled

10:09.240 --> 10:13.800
right down to the three word phrase build back better or new normal

10:13.800 --> 10:17.640
these kinds of things were just as this is the obvious this is the one they

10:17.640 --> 10:20.520
made videos about so that everybody got excited about

10:20.520 --> 10:25.320
look all these world world leaders are saying build back better but nobody

10:25.320 --> 10:29.720
got really suspicious about some of the other things that everyone was

10:29.720 --> 10:33.800
agreeing about including the fact that this was a pandemic

10:33.800 --> 10:38.520
the attributes of the pandemic were actually early on seated in such a way

10:38.520 --> 10:42.600
I believe so that the narrative of worst case scenario was present from the

10:42.600 --> 10:47.400
beginning and that people could already consider in January of 2020

10:47.400 --> 10:50.920
that if these people are lying about it and it is the worst case scenario we

10:50.920 --> 10:54.760
could all lose several people in our lives that billions of people were

10:54.840 --> 10:58.440
going to die and so this worst case scenario was

10:58.440 --> 11:02.680
extremely important number one to make sure that everybody complied from

11:02.680 --> 11:08.360
masks to lockdowns to getting iPads and putting your kids in front of them

11:08.360 --> 11:11.400
all the way eventually to the end of 2020 where the

11:11.400 --> 11:16.600
transfections using a dentavirus or using mRNA and lipid nanoparticles

11:16.600 --> 11:21.800
were taken gladly because of the fear of worst case scenario

11:21.800 --> 11:27.000
they of course told this story under the pretense of a national security

11:27.000 --> 11:30.760
response and so the people that were curating this narrative were also

11:30.760 --> 11:34.360
kind of under some constraints under what they could say

11:34.360 --> 11:37.880
and were required to say that we're at war with this virus and that is

11:37.880 --> 11:43.240
is biblical and finally the whole idea and I really believe this with all of my

11:43.240 --> 11:46.680
heart that one of the main objectives of the original

11:46.680 --> 11:51.560
three years was to make sure that a story about a virus spike protein could be

11:51.720 --> 11:56.040
confounded with the story of transfection to that spike protein

11:56.040 --> 11:59.960
so that when transfection didn't work out as well as they hoped it would

11:59.960 --> 12:02.360
they would be able to blame it on the poor

12:02.360 --> 12:06.360
rust choice of the spike protein as the transfection target

12:06.360 --> 12:10.440
rather than transfection in general and now we can move on to

12:10.440 --> 12:13.240
subsequent generations of this technology

12:13.240 --> 12:16.520
purporting to solve some of the problems that are there

12:16.520 --> 12:22.360
and I will include the double-stranded DNA contamination in this general

12:22.360 --> 12:27.880
ruse to try and confuse us about what effects are coming from where

12:27.880 --> 12:31.640
early but I want is high morbidity I want people to complain

12:31.640 --> 12:35.320
so what do I do I go to Des Moines ladies and gentlemen of people on the

12:35.320 --> 12:37.640
screen I have nothing against Des Moines I live there for four years

12:37.640 --> 12:41.960
I go to Des Moines I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines

12:41.960 --> 12:45.400
I go to Seattle I infect a couple of cases there

12:45.400 --> 12:49.320
okay so we've listened to this video before this video is Dr. Giordano

12:49.320 --> 12:55.000
Dr. I can't remember his first name shoot but anyway it doesn't matter

12:55.000 --> 12:59.640
Dr. Giordano he works for the US Army and he's explaining here

12:59.640 --> 13:06.760
how a seeding of a few annoying cases using a toxin or some other substance

13:06.760 --> 13:09.720
which would cause people to go to the hospital and complain

13:09.720 --> 13:13.560
could be combined with an internet campaign to create the illusion of

13:13.560 --> 13:17.400
spread and then that illusion of spread could be claimed by a

13:17.400 --> 13:21.560
terrorist group and also denied by governments

13:21.560 --> 13:25.960
and you could cause confusion that would cause a rift between the populace

13:25.960 --> 13:29.880
and their government and that would ruin a country over time

13:29.880 --> 13:34.040
now although this is not exactly what I think happened I think that

13:34.040 --> 13:38.680
this presentation from 2017 really puts out an outline which we need to

13:38.680 --> 13:43.240
consider as a real possibility has an alternative to the idea that

13:43.240 --> 13:47.560
either a natural or a lab leak virus has circulated the globe for the last

13:47.560 --> 13:51.080
four and a half years and that it has changed its flavor

13:51.080 --> 13:55.720
several times across the entire globe in a sort of

13:55.720 --> 13:59.800
almost I don't know color changing kind of manner

13:59.800 --> 14:04.600
this story doesn't have any foundation in biology but this one has stories

14:04.600 --> 14:11.000
in has a foundation in military lectures it has a foundation in biology

14:11.080 --> 14:14.920
and it has a foundation in previous tabletop exercises which discussed

14:14.920 --> 14:19.000
these kinds of things so number one a military response with the ability to

14:19.000 --> 14:23.400
drive local mass casualty events I believe that it's very possible

14:23.400 --> 14:28.040
that in the places where the script called for a lot of people to get sick

14:28.040 --> 14:32.360
there was also a military presence to make sure that that appearance was

14:32.360 --> 14:36.600
maintained doesn't necessarily mean that 20,000 people were

14:36.600 --> 14:40.360
killed in four weeks in New York but that seems to be the numbers right now

14:40.360 --> 14:44.040
we don't have death certificates we don't have any firm evidence of where

14:44.040 --> 14:47.160
these 20,000s bodies went but the numbers that are officially

14:47.160 --> 14:51.960
reported are a mass casualty events that begins and ends in four weeks

14:51.960 --> 14:56.280
there's no evidence of spread after that and these numbers need to be corroborated

14:56.280 --> 15:01.080
because again the New York City was a place where lots of people rush to help

15:01.080 --> 15:05.880
including people like Pierre Corey who although he came after that 20,000

15:06.600 --> 15:11.320
event was very quickly in front of the US Senate telling about how this was a

15:11.320 --> 15:17.800
war and that this was crazy deadly and that it was a real battle

15:17.800 --> 15:21.000
and so we've got to be very careful here because it's very likely that the

15:21.000 --> 15:24.760
beginning of the pandemic in these places where these mass casualty events were

15:24.760 --> 15:28.760
occurred people were also co-opted they walked in they said hey this is a

15:28.760 --> 15:31.480
national security thing we don't know how bad it's going to be

15:31.480 --> 15:36.440
it could be worst case scenario we need your help we're glad you came

15:36.440 --> 15:40.200
but we need this message delivered to social media you're a credible guy

15:40.200 --> 15:44.360
i think you can handle it but you're gonna have to stay on script a little bit

15:44.360 --> 15:47.560
because the worst case scenario we need everybody to believe it

15:47.560 --> 15:51.160
so that they comply so that they lock down so that they wear their masks so

15:51.160 --> 15:54.840
that we figure out whether this is really bad or whether it's ongoing

15:54.840 --> 15:57.400
and so they could have scared it and threatened him

15:57.400 --> 16:01.560
not saying that anybody was given a a suitcase of cash and you know

16:01.560 --> 16:04.440
and and and that's how they did this i'm saying that

16:04.440 --> 16:08.520
that the people who ran this used the worst case scenario to co-opt all of

16:08.520 --> 16:11.240
these people to make sure that they stayed on narrative

16:11.240 --> 16:14.680
and at the same time in the background there are financial and legal incentives

16:14.680 --> 16:18.120
to declare covid and at the same time there's this

16:18.120 --> 16:22.920
social media campaign where the worst case scenario of a lab leak is already

16:22.920 --> 16:26.520
being whispered about and at the same time there are people

16:26.520 --> 16:31.560
on regular tv already denying that that's crazy

16:31.560 --> 16:35.080
and now if you institute inside of hospitals

16:35.080 --> 16:40.120
little tweaks to different knobs little tweaks to different procedures so

16:40.120 --> 16:44.040
that the average all-cause mortality goes up

16:44.040 --> 16:46.920
and then you have a couple specific things that when they test positive or

16:46.920 --> 16:50.200
there's a set they're suspected of being covid

16:50.200 --> 16:54.120
you can get a lot of money if you put them on this protocol and you're also

16:54.120 --> 16:58.760
free of legal obligation if you put them on this protocol

16:58.760 --> 17:01.400
then there's going to be a lot of hospitals especially in america who are

17:01.400 --> 17:05.160
going to put them on this protocol if you also combine that with

17:05.160 --> 17:08.200
social policies like do not resuscitate orders to

17:08.200 --> 17:14.120
EMTs or or any countless other ways that they mistreated old people in

17:14.120 --> 17:17.560
nursing homes you can also increase all-cause mortality

17:17.560 --> 17:20.760
under the umbrella of this spreading covid virus

17:20.760 --> 17:24.680
emergency social policies and these covid hospital protocols then need to be

17:24.680 --> 17:28.840
ignored by the people who are perpetuating the worst case scenario

17:28.840 --> 17:32.440
narrative not because they're mean but because this is part of the way

17:32.440 --> 17:35.800
that this would work we didn't know anything then there were no numbers we

17:35.800 --> 17:39.000
can look back now and look like wow you should have known better but we

17:39.000 --> 17:43.720
really can't say it then and that's how i got stuck into this too

17:43.720 --> 17:47.320
that's the reason they convinced the public that a lab leak cover-up was

17:47.320 --> 17:50.680
happening before their eyes i was involved in a drastic twitter

17:50.680 --> 17:54.600
group that also convinced me that i was breaking the story of a lab leak

17:54.600 --> 17:59.880
right before my eyes i felt like i was being a hero

17:59.880 --> 18:05.640
and so they roped us in to figuring this mystery out into fighting about it

18:05.640 --> 18:10.360
and all the while they they also used australia and new zealand as lockdown

18:10.360 --> 18:13.480
examples where they threw people on the ground and forced them to get in

18:13.480 --> 18:16.840
masks and they brought them to trailers away from their house to

18:16.840 --> 18:21.960
to be quarantined they couldn't do that in america but they needed to show

18:21.960 --> 18:25.560
the rest of the world what could be done and what might work what a real lockdown

18:25.560 --> 18:29.160
looks like then they needed people like bret weinstein in america to

18:29.160 --> 18:32.280
complain that while we didn't lock down hard enough otherwise we'd already be

18:32.280 --> 18:36.760
at zero covid zero covid being a real thing that

18:36.760 --> 18:39.640
we talked about for two years that we've all forgotten about but that was a

18:39.640 --> 18:42.280
real debate

18:43.240 --> 18:47.720
and so the way that they they hid all of this activity was to just agree that

18:47.720 --> 18:50.680
we're going to talk about a novel virus we're going to talk about millions of

18:50.680 --> 18:54.360
people died we're going to talk about millions more could be saved you just

18:54.360 --> 18:58.280
listen to me and we're going to talk about gain of function being a real likely

18:58.280 --> 19:02.680
source of it and therefore this danger will come again and again

19:02.680 --> 19:07.160
and if you don't question this stuff you can say anything else

19:07.400 --> 19:12.760
and they have been laying this narrative for decades that cell culture and

19:12.760 --> 19:17.320
animal passage can access pandemic potential and now we can stitch them

19:17.320 --> 19:21.640
together and it's even worse and they want us to pass this idea

19:21.640 --> 19:25.160
onto our children so that they grow up with these boogie men forever

19:25.160 --> 19:29.640
that this mythology governs their behavior

19:30.600 --> 19:33.880
and i believe there are a number of people on the internet that were

19:33.880 --> 19:37.800
recruited before the pandemic for narrative control not even knowing there

19:37.800 --> 19:41.560
was going to be a pandemic just thinking that wow i get to help out with the

19:41.560 --> 19:45.400
the governance structure of america by being the new social media the new

19:45.400 --> 19:48.440
media the new mainstream media i get to be that guy

19:48.440 --> 19:50.840
that's so fun

19:50.840 --> 19:54.600
joe rogan doesn't have a hundred million dollar contract on spotify

19:54.600 --> 19:57.240
for nothing

19:57.960 --> 20:06.360
and so we had guys like this in america in uh february of 2020 listen carefully

20:06.360 --> 20:08.120
hell

20:08.120 --> 20:10.120
biblico

20:10.120 --> 20:11.000
i kid you now

20:11.000 --> 20:13.480
back what we thought of it

20:13.480 --> 20:17.080
people come in or you can't hear it

20:17.080 --> 20:20.440
just try ging ging try ging ging

20:20.440 --> 20:24.440
maybe i have to switch my sound settings we can we can hear it just a bit muffled

20:24.440 --> 20:27.240
to the start oh okay that's good all right i'll play it

20:27.240 --> 20:30.200
sorry it's very quick

20:30.200 --> 20:32.120
biblico

20:32.120 --> 20:35.400
i kid you not

20:35.400 --> 20:36.600
people come in

20:36.600 --> 20:38.200
i get intubated

20:38.200 --> 20:41.880
they die the cycle repeats

20:41.880 --> 20:43.160
you overwhelmed

20:43.160 --> 20:46.360
yeah the the systems overwhelmed all over the place

20:46.360 --> 20:49.960
my daughters in intern in brooklyn first year

20:49.960 --> 20:53.400
resident she starts the icn today

20:53.400 --> 20:57.560
i couldn't sleep last night it's it's scary

20:57.560 --> 21:01.640
nine eleven now what you know here oh sorry he says one more thing

21:01.640 --> 21:05.560
he said nine eleven is nothing compared to this now what's important to see is

21:05.560 --> 21:09.960
that that guy was also featured on tucker carlson

21:09.960 --> 21:12.840
so even though we now know when we look back at

21:12.840 --> 21:16.120
new york city most of the hospitals were empty

21:16.120 --> 21:20.840
that guy was on fox news telling the united states the whole world

21:20.840 --> 21:23.800
that it was biblico like hell

21:23.800 --> 21:28.120
and they had world leaders saying that it was a pandemic and it's we're gonna

21:28.120 --> 21:31.320
it's the new normal we're gonna build back better they had people on the news

21:31.320 --> 21:35.400
saying this they had virologists agreeing that the ace two receptors sir

21:35.400 --> 21:39.800
her ace two receptor uh affinity sure seems to indicate that they enriched

21:39.800 --> 21:45.240
this in a laboratory maybe even with humanized mice

21:45.240 --> 21:50.760
and none of these people acknowledged that there was this huge

21:51.000 --> 21:55.080
propaganda campaign that caused fear and uncertainty and doubt they sent

21:55.080 --> 22:01.640
old attending physicians home because the virus was so dangerous you

22:01.640 --> 22:05.560
didn't want these and people that were near retirement to be in the OR

22:05.560 --> 22:11.080
or into the ER rather they sent old professors home from

22:11.080 --> 22:13.880
universities said don't come in you should just take early retirement

22:13.880 --> 22:18.200
because if you come into a university you could get this terrible thing

22:18.200 --> 22:24.120
and you could die they told people not to resuscitate people because you'll

22:24.120 --> 22:29.240
spread the virus when you give them CPR you better use ventilators with a higher

22:29.240 --> 22:32.120
pressure setting than you've ever used before because otherwise they might

22:32.120 --> 22:35.800
spread the virus you have it these people can talk or that doesn't

22:35.800 --> 22:39.000
matter sedate them invent them because they get

22:39.000 --> 22:43.320
covid money then thirty five thousand dollars a person

22:43.320 --> 22:47.000
and they get no there's no liability for the

22:47.000 --> 22:50.920
for the for the care of that person if they designated them covid

22:50.920 --> 22:54.040
lack of antibiotic use was just built into the protocol

22:54.040 --> 22:56.920
poor use of steroids was just built into the protocol

22:56.920 --> 23:00.600
eventually madazzalam and remdesivir was built into the protocol

23:00.600 --> 23:04.440
the opioid deaths have gone up every year in america since

23:04.440 --> 23:09.240
2017 or something like that but since the start of the pandemic they're going

23:09.240 --> 23:13.240
up much more rapidly these are not excess deaths that can

23:13.240 --> 23:16.200
be discounted but they are excess deaths that very easily hospital

23:16.200 --> 23:21.800
administrators could call covid and did more importantly

23:21.800 --> 23:25.240
these deaths happen across age groups which reduce

23:25.240 --> 23:28.920
the expected lifespan of america and then they can be pointed to us saying look

23:28.920 --> 23:33.400
at what covid did and without any honest accounting of what's actually

23:33.400 --> 23:36.520
happening in america what's actually killing people in america

23:36.520 --> 23:40.840
these deaths are getting mixed up as covid because they only care about excess

23:40.840 --> 23:43.960
and if you compute it wrong all of those are excess

23:43.960 --> 23:47.320
death certificate fraud financial incentives and then we go to track and

23:47.320 --> 23:50.440
trace which happened in america for literally a year they had

23:50.440 --> 23:53.480
whole companies that were making phone calls to warn you that

23:53.480 --> 23:56.920
somebody that you work with was tested positive

23:56.920 --> 24:00.280
and then we go all the way back to the beginning and we find this pcr

24:00.280 --> 24:03.960
fraud this lateral flow test fraud and likely sequencing fraud

24:03.960 --> 24:07.480
which we have all come to accept as being evidence of something which

24:07.480 --> 24:10.600
it's not and we've come to accept that evidence

24:10.600 --> 24:15.080
because no matter who we got into arguments with they just seem to all

24:15.080 --> 24:18.200
be stuck on this novel virus is being real

24:18.200 --> 24:22.840
it's the limited spectrum of debate that we've been trapped in for four years

24:22.840 --> 24:27.160
it's the way that we get our family and friends out is by

24:27.160 --> 24:31.400
alerting them to the idea that this hasn't been a vigorous debate it's been

24:31.400 --> 24:34.520
a very limited debate actually tricked you

24:34.520 --> 24:38.600
into solving a mystery that got you to accept their monster

24:38.600 --> 24:42.360
they started us out in the beginning of the pandemic got a lonely road all by

24:42.360 --> 24:46.600
ourselves with only social media and mainstream media to look to besides

24:46.600 --> 24:50.760
our family and then no matter who you got in the car with

24:50.760 --> 24:53.960
they were going to tell you a story about a novel virus that killed millions that

24:53.960 --> 24:57.000
we should be able to save more people from if we would just give them these

24:57.000 --> 24:59.720
novel treatments and gain a function it's definitely a

24:59.720 --> 25:04.360
possibility and the virus will come again

25:04.520 --> 25:08.840
and so it didn't matter who you chose it was a random card if you got lucky

25:08.840 --> 25:12.920
and chose Mike Eden well and maybe you were losing your mind for three years

25:12.920 --> 25:15.560
because no one else agreed with you if you heard

25:15.560 --> 25:19.320
Wolfgang Wodock before he stops speaking up because of censorship

25:19.320 --> 25:24.360
he might have been gone crazy by now but if you found any of these other people

25:24.360 --> 25:29.240
on TV or on social media you're still hot in the debate about oh my gosh these

25:29.240 --> 25:32.520
people were lying to me Brett Weinstein was hot on this

25:32.520 --> 25:36.760
telling about lab leak and natural virus he even had a member of drastic on his

25:36.760 --> 25:39.000
show named Yuri Dagan who was the first guy to

25:39.000 --> 25:41.880
identify the fear and cleavage site that supposedly

25:41.880 --> 25:45.240
set this from a normal average coronavirus into something that could skirt

25:45.240 --> 25:49.320
the world for five years like a lightning bolt

25:51.720 --> 25:56.280
most recently i got courted by and one of the things that happened not most

25:56.280 --> 25:59.720
recently but most relevant to the story i want to tell you today

25:59.720 --> 26:03.880
is that Charles Rixie a member of drastic and an American came to my

26:03.880 --> 26:07.800
house in Pittsburgh to convince me that my assessment of the diffuse

26:07.800 --> 26:11.560
proposal which is a leaked grant proposal which

26:11.560 --> 26:14.840
supposedly describes the insertion of fear and cleavage sites

26:14.840 --> 26:18.680
into coronaviruses and them spraying them into bad caves by

26:18.680 --> 26:23.880
eco-health alliance was likely a fake i said that a moment that the moment

26:23.880 --> 26:26.680
that anybody showed it to me i said that's got to be a fake

26:26.680 --> 26:31.080
there's no way that anybody would have written that grant proposal and if they

26:31.080 --> 26:33.960
did write that grant proposal they wrote it just so that people would believe

26:33.960 --> 26:36.840
that these experiments would be done they're ridiculous and even if they

26:36.840 --> 26:40.120
did them my current conclusion is there's

26:40.120 --> 26:43.720
this doesn't create pandemic potential but it does create this

26:43.720 --> 26:47.480
ongoing debate about whether that's pandemic potential or not which is the

26:47.480 --> 26:50.040
f these scooby-doo to begin with so this guy

26:50.040 --> 26:53.080
was involved in that he actually came to my house he's one of the people who

26:53.080 --> 26:57.240
claims that he released the the the diffuse proposal to the public now

26:57.240 --> 27:01.320
why is this important with regard to kevin mccurnan well kevin mccurnan is

27:01.320 --> 27:05.960
this guy who worked for the the human genome project he's not a doctor

27:05.960 --> 27:10.200
or a phd but he's a very clever guy he's sold a lot of patents to different

27:10.200 --> 27:14.200
companies a lot of companies he's sold or got bought out because he's got a lot

27:14.200 --> 27:17.800
of ideas about how to sequence dna so there's no question that he's sharp as a

27:17.800 --> 27:21.720
knife the deal is though is that he's been on my stream at least

27:21.720 --> 27:24.520
twice he came on my stream in the first two years

27:24.520 --> 27:28.520
to talk about the transfection to talk about the RNA impurities to talk about

27:28.520 --> 27:30.760
what would happen when they code on optimized

27:30.760 --> 27:35.000
the RNA and so we we we had an ongoing relationship but at some point in time

27:35.000 --> 27:37.800
that ongoing relationship tumbled and stopped

27:37.800 --> 27:40.840
because i said that the double stranded dna

27:40.840 --> 27:44.920
in the shot was probably not the worst thing that's in there and even if that

27:44.920 --> 27:48.520
wasn't in there it would still be bad which is what i thought we agreed on

27:48.520 --> 27:51.720
already with the previous two times we had discussed this

27:51.720 --> 27:55.320
however that kind of fell apart why is that interesting

27:55.320 --> 27:58.760
well it's interesting because after being blocked for over a year it looks

27:58.760 --> 28:04.280
like robert malone is promoting kevin mccurnan and a particular article

28:04.280 --> 28:07.880
it's a particular article about the diffuse proposal and about how the

28:07.880 --> 28:11.880
diffuse proposal has had some extra evidence brought

28:11.880 --> 28:18.840
forth because hey a foyer request reported by emily cough

28:18.840 --> 28:23.640
has um has shown that they ordered some of the enzymes that would have been

28:23.640 --> 28:27.240
needed in the proposal that they had some email conversations about the

28:27.240 --> 28:30.920
contents of the proposal so these these

28:30.920 --> 28:35.640
these other orbiting documents are argued by robert malone

28:35.640 --> 28:41.480
kevin mccurnan a guy by the name of ark medic and jessica rose all to be

28:41.480 --> 28:44.600
further evidence that the diffuse proposal is real

28:44.600 --> 28:48.040
that they actually put fear and cleavage sites into coronavirus is then they

28:48.040 --> 28:52.520
sprayed them into bat caves and so the implication is is that they made it

28:52.520 --> 28:56.440
and that an RNA did circulate the globe for the last four years and is still

28:56.440 --> 28:59.480
circulating now i want to put reference to the

28:59.480 --> 29:03.240
fact that i also wrote an article about this at the time that the paper came

29:03.240 --> 29:07.720
out with none other than charles rick c that guy that came to my house

29:07.720 --> 29:12.280
and robert f Kennedy jr in the the chd defender

29:12.280 --> 29:16.440
in that article i acknowledge that the diffuse proposal has this

29:16.440 --> 29:21.000
methodology in it but i was already at that point telling bobby that you have

29:21.000 --> 29:25.320
to consider the possibility the diffuse proposal is a fake with the design

29:25.320 --> 29:29.160
of trying to get people to buy into this lab leak thing because a lab leak

29:29.160 --> 29:34.200
implies a virus with unknown potential it could be an unknown level of deadly

29:34.200 --> 29:38.920
an unknown level of of stable an unknown level of whatever

29:38.920 --> 29:41.880
because it's not natural and that's the whole

29:41.880 --> 29:45.400
that's the whole beauty of the scooby-doo once you start accepting this as a

29:45.400 --> 29:47.880
mystery you need to solve you're accepting that

29:47.880 --> 29:53.000
that boogie man and so what's interesting about the promotion of this is that it

29:53.000 --> 29:56.760
all seems to be a concerted effort to make diffuse real again

29:56.760 --> 29:59.960
why is that interesting well because i think

29:59.960 --> 30:04.040
this all spun out of control when i started to talk about what clones

30:04.040 --> 30:07.880
are and i think that this has a lot to do with this because

30:07.880 --> 30:11.960
if you look in the comment section of this actual post

30:11.960 --> 30:16.760
you will find a comment about kevin that kevin mccurnan the author of this

30:16.760 --> 30:21.960
makes to a subscriber or follower of me

30:21.960 --> 30:25.160
and so i just want to read this i know it's it's sometimes

30:25.160 --> 30:27.960
annoying to have somebody read something but it's a little low and it's a little

30:27.960 --> 30:30.840
small and i want to make some points about what this is and then we're

30:30.840 --> 30:34.840
going to listen to or we're going to discuss what this is really all about

30:34.840 --> 30:39.720
so this is somebody who said that what about clones and the fact that RNA

30:39.720 --> 30:43.800
can't go around the world um with high fidelity for many years

30:43.800 --> 30:48.200
that was the that's the basic 30 000 foot message that i've had for a while

30:48.200 --> 30:52.120
you're probably familiar with this is common remember this is a response

30:52.120 --> 30:55.720
from kevin mccurnan the guy who has been going around the world

30:55.720 --> 30:58.920
on lots of podcasts telling people that there's double-stranded DNA

30:58.920 --> 31:01.560
contamination in the shot and that that means that

31:01.560 --> 31:04.600
that all these guys are bad guys and that it could explain

31:04.600 --> 31:07.880
all of the problems that we've been having which i really

31:07.880 --> 31:10.600
believe is is a red herring so here we go

31:10.600 --> 31:14.840
this is common jj kui bio babble slash folklore

31:14.840 --> 31:18.680
coronaviruses circulate the globe every year

31:18.680 --> 31:22.760
there is no reason why an engineered version could not do the same given it

31:22.840 --> 31:26.360
was derived from parts of viruses that have been doing this for millions of

31:26.360 --> 31:30.040
years so i have the the virology textbook behind

31:30.040 --> 31:32.920
my head here because i want to emphasize that

31:32.920 --> 31:36.840
kevin mccurnan the guy who worked for the human genome project and now has a

31:36.840 --> 31:39.560
a marijuana genetics company

31:39.560 --> 31:44.040
i mean and lives on the atlantic ocean in a very beautiful house

31:44.040 --> 31:46.920
whose brothers have several companies about

31:46.920 --> 31:51.400
about testing for cancer and his father was an absolutely

31:51.400 --> 31:56.680
giant set their family up really well as a successful business man this guy

31:56.680 --> 32:00.680
is no business no reason to waste any of his time

32:00.680 --> 32:04.200
coming against a guy who's renting his house in pittsburgh and streams

32:04.200 --> 32:06.920
from his garage with less than three thousand people

32:06.920 --> 32:10.600
but here he is already 100 percent on

32:10.600 --> 32:14.840
the virology that the nih and the who

32:14.840 --> 32:18.600
and the cdc and everybody else would love you to believe coronaviruses

32:18.600 --> 32:21.160
circulate the globe every year and there's no reason why an engineered

32:21.160 --> 32:24.600
one couldn't do the same in this case someone spent the

32:24.600 --> 32:27.880
effort to hyper optimize the covid-19 ace-2 binding

32:27.880 --> 32:30.360
affinity so that would spread far and wide

32:30.360 --> 32:33.960
that's weird because the first year and a half we were debating about the fact

32:33.960 --> 32:38.680
that it had a fear and cleavage site which made it very infectious

32:38.680 --> 32:41.960
now he's saying that it was actually the ace-2 affinity that caused that i thought

32:41.960 --> 32:44.440
the ace-2 affinity had something more to do

32:44.440 --> 32:48.360
with with how many uh how many people it would

32:48.840 --> 32:52.120
infect or how easily it could infect people but the fact that it would go

32:52.120 --> 32:54.920
throughout the body and be very uh systemic and that when you

32:54.920 --> 32:57.160
coughed it out it would already be ready to bind

32:57.160 --> 33:01.400
was the fear and cleavage site the fault in this logic is assuming the spread

33:01.400 --> 33:05.400
initiated when chinese claimed it did in 2019

33:05.400 --> 33:08.760
when in fact there's evidence of prior circulation this is also important

33:08.760 --> 33:11.160
because this is the opposite of what i said

33:11.160 --> 33:15.320
prior circulation gives time for it to achieve an endemic state we've already

33:15.400 --> 33:18.680
said that it's likely that the background endemic

33:18.680 --> 33:23.080
RNA signal is being confounded with new spread

33:23.080 --> 33:26.680
the most efficient mechanism would be the package of virus and infect a few

33:26.680 --> 33:30.920
people in the city exactly as giordano's

33:30.920 --> 33:34.840
lecture tells us and exactly as i've been teaching for the last

33:34.840 --> 33:39.960
almost three years so again this is a january 19th

33:39.960 --> 33:45.320
2024 post about my ideas and he says that the the

33:45.320 --> 33:50.280
seeding clone hypothesis is chemtrail retarded

33:50.280 --> 33:54.280
dropping clones everywhere hoping for magical transfection to occur while

33:54.280 --> 33:57.560
having an endless parade of spies dropping spreading these clones around

33:57.560 --> 34:01.000
his keystone cop when packaged virus will

34:01.000 --> 34:04.840
perform all this skullduggery for you so he wants you to believe

34:04.840 --> 34:08.440
that viruses are something very different than clones when virology

34:08.440 --> 34:13.160
acknowledges and and actually thousands of papers

34:13.160 --> 34:17.640
that clones are their best approximation of what they can barely find in nature

34:17.640 --> 34:22.280
so it's a it's a direct inversion of what i have to believe he knows is the

34:22.280 --> 34:25.880
truth about RNA virology you expose yourself to

34:25.880 --> 34:29.000
infinite more disclosure points gonna get cost so leaking the virus provides

34:29.000 --> 34:33.560
camouflage plausible diet ability so here we are again being forced back

34:33.560 --> 34:38.040
into solving the mystery so this is the final insult the keystone cop

34:38.040 --> 34:42.200
clone chemtrail hypothesis requires teams of covert people

34:42.200 --> 34:47.480
and frankly is stupid if you know how to package a virus well this is curious

34:47.480 --> 34:50.440
because that's not the argument that i'm making so i want to clarify that

34:50.440 --> 34:54.600
first um the argument that i'm making is that the

34:54.600 --> 34:59.640
cartoon version of the infectious cycle is incorrect where a virus goes into

34:59.640 --> 35:01.560
your lungs it makes copies of itself and then you

35:01.560 --> 35:04.520
cough it out it's much more complicated than that

35:04.520 --> 35:07.080
one of the very early clues that we had of this

35:07.080 --> 35:10.680
was when robert malone told us that the vast majority of viral particles are

35:10.680 --> 35:13.240
non-infectious they're their their replication

35:13.240 --> 35:17.400
incompetent and so that's what's represented at the cartoon over here

35:17.400 --> 35:21.720
i believe this is also the reason why a lot of the objections of the no virus

35:21.720 --> 35:27.000
camp are actually very much spot on and have a great relevance to our

35:27.000 --> 35:30.440
trying to understand the infectious cycle for real if there is one and i'm

35:30.440 --> 35:34.120
open to the possibility that there isn't so the first thing that i'd like you to

35:34.120 --> 35:38.920
imagine or think about is virus packaging and what that has to do with

35:38.920 --> 35:43.560
this is a cartoon a computer model of viral packaging the idea is again

35:43.560 --> 35:49.080
that little tiny red line there is the mr and a and it's supposed to be coiled

35:49.080 --> 35:53.720
around the end protein and then a bunch of end proteins brings that

35:53.720 --> 35:57.880
full genome of the virus into the endosome and the endosome has the spike

35:57.880 --> 36:01.720
protein on the inside of it and so when you when it

36:01.720 --> 36:05.480
invaginates like that then you get this vesicle forming on the inside of the

36:05.480 --> 36:10.280
endosome and that's supposed to be the free virus now the question becomes

36:10.280 --> 36:15.160
how in the world is this all orchestrated how does your cell just get told okay

36:15.160 --> 36:19.960
take this and wrap this all around and and and put this in there and arrange

36:19.960 --> 36:24.200
this that way the idea that the word hijack

36:24.200 --> 36:30.360
is sufficient to justify this cartoon as being fact is absolutely

36:30.360 --> 36:33.560
unacceptable and that's again part of the no-virus

36:33.560 --> 36:36.600
people's objection that i think is really spot on

36:36.600 --> 36:41.640
and in fact um there's there's almost everything that they say is true it's

36:41.640 --> 36:45.000
just the things that they chose not to say for two or three years that frustrate

36:45.000 --> 36:48.760
me but again it could just be that i was an idiot and stuck with these people

36:48.760 --> 36:53.800
this i want to whoa sorry about that that's from my stream

36:53.800 --> 36:59.160
so i would like to oh come on end i would like to just

36:59.160 --> 37:02.680
give you a brief introduction to RNA viruses to make sure that you

37:02.680 --> 37:05.960
understand where we are this is influenza A

37:05.960 --> 37:09.560
and influenza A if you can see my arrow is right here and it's binding with the

37:09.560 --> 37:13.240
cell it's going to go into the endosome and then it's going to release

37:13.240 --> 37:19.240
into this thing a negative strand RNA and some proteins which can copy it

37:19.240 --> 37:23.000
so the first thing to remember in case you're unaware of this is that flu

37:23.000 --> 37:26.280
and measles are negative strand RNA viruses

37:26.280 --> 37:29.240
that they they can't be read by our ribosomes

37:29.240 --> 37:34.520
so in order for an influenza virus to be a useful particle it also needs to have

37:34.520 --> 37:38.440
all of the accessory proteins present so that that negative strand RNA when

37:38.440 --> 37:43.000
it's released into the cell will be reliably copied into a positive

37:43.000 --> 37:47.240
strand RNA which can be then translated into proteins by our

37:47.240 --> 37:51.080
our ribosomes now that's a pretty interesting

37:51.080 --> 37:54.680
scenario right because then if we go back to this

37:54.680 --> 37:59.640
this illusion here then in a flu virus when a flu virus is

37:59.640 --> 38:03.720
assembled not only do you need to get a full genome in there or in the flu

38:03.720 --> 38:07.320
viruses case actually need to get about eight circular RNAs

38:07.320 --> 38:11.880
into the same virus but you also need to get some of these proteins in there

38:11.880 --> 38:16.440
because if they're not in there then this virus will be useless

38:16.440 --> 38:21.320
so contrast that to the positive stranded RNA virus of coronavirus and you

38:21.320 --> 38:26.120
will see that actually the translation of the full genome occurs

38:26.120 --> 38:29.960
immediately and you produce n proteins and you produce this

38:29.960 --> 38:36.600
primary translating poly protein and so these these

38:36.600 --> 38:41.720
this compound protein something something apparently can copy

38:41.720 --> 38:46.360
sub genomic RNAs right away to genomic RNAs or sorry genomic RNAs

38:46.360 --> 38:49.480
right away to genomic RNAs you see in this picture here this is from like

38:49.480 --> 38:52.920
science magazine so if you think that this is kind of a

38:52.920 --> 38:57.480
a bad picture I agree but here you have just a little cartoon that seems to

38:57.480 --> 39:00.760
indicate that this this amount of protein is capable

39:00.760 --> 39:04.920
of making copies of the single stranded genomic RNA

39:04.920 --> 39:10.040
but it's also capable of making these single stranded genomic RNA subgenomic

39:10.040 --> 39:14.120
RNAs that are little tiny ones here and they don't really

39:14.120 --> 39:17.800
explain much more about it it's again a lot of hand waving but again you can see

39:17.800 --> 39:22.360
the task none of these RNAs are supposed to be packaged

39:22.360 --> 39:26.520
only the full genome should get packaged and

39:26.520 --> 39:31.640
shipped out and yet when we've looked at the expression of these positive

39:31.640 --> 39:36.760
stranded genomes in cell cultures we see that the preponderance of

39:36.760 --> 39:41.000
mRNA's that are produced are actually all these subgenomic RNAs like hundreds

39:41.000 --> 39:45.640
of thousands of times more than any full genomes that are made and so this

39:45.720 --> 39:50.120
seems to kind of to support the idea of what Robert Malone

39:50.120 --> 39:53.480
said which is the vast majority of viral particles don't end up with a full

39:53.480 --> 39:56.280
genome inside of them because the full genome is very rarely

39:56.280 --> 40:00.680
copied with high with very very rarely copied successfully and then every

40:00.680 --> 40:04.920
time it is copied successfully there are a number of errors in it because of

40:04.920 --> 40:09.800
the way that RNA is copied now it is possible

40:09.800 --> 40:13.720
in the realm of possibility that this little area here in the cartoon

40:13.720 --> 40:17.960
will be found to be quite high fidelity and Jay's all wrong and he's an idiot

40:17.960 --> 40:21.400
and he can go home but I really doubt that and more importantly

40:21.400 --> 40:26.440
there's no real there's no real firm molecular evidence for the fidelity

40:26.440 --> 40:29.960
here at this step they can say that it's it's here

40:29.960 --> 40:33.640
or it's there but the bottom line is that it's not like

40:33.640 --> 40:39.000
copying double stranded DNA and so you're already at lower fidelity with that

40:39.000 --> 40:42.200
and so what is actually happening here is most likely that these

40:42.200 --> 40:46.840
these RNAs these viruses are interacting with existing machinery

40:46.840 --> 40:50.760
that already packages things that already puts

40:50.760 --> 40:55.400
RNA or DNA into a package and already has proteins on the outside

40:55.400 --> 40:58.120
because then it would make a lot more sense in other words

40:58.120 --> 41:01.960
it's kind of like a cuckoo clock and if you hijack a cuckoo clock you can't

41:01.960 --> 41:05.320
make it make toast you can make it ring at the wrong time

41:05.320 --> 41:08.760
you could make it make funny noises but you can't make it make toast and I

41:08.760 --> 41:11.880
don't think that a virus can go into a cell and make it do something that it

41:11.880 --> 41:15.320
already doesn't do. Cells already package exosomes and send

41:15.320 --> 41:18.040
signals to one another and so I think that this is just

41:18.040 --> 41:22.440
hijacking of that signal and but what that means

41:22.440 --> 41:26.200
is that what we are doing is we are packaging RNA and the vast majority of

41:26.200 --> 41:29.640
the RNA that we find in there is either low fidelity copy or even a

41:29.640 --> 41:34.680
impartial copy and that's the problem with what they find when they look in

41:34.680 --> 41:37.960
these papers what they find when they look in the wild and so this is the

41:37.960 --> 41:41.800
analogy I come up with they are more like mixed tapes

41:41.800 --> 41:45.720
and so you cannot grow them in the wild. A mixed tape is

41:45.720 --> 41:49.240
from the old days where if you bought this in the store it would sound really

41:49.240 --> 41:51.080
good but if you copied it for your friend it would

41:51.080 --> 41:53.560
already have this hiss and it wouldn't sound very well

41:53.560 --> 41:57.880
so you could make a mixed tape for your girlfriend and put all the songs that

41:57.880 --> 42:01.160
reminded you of her on one tape and it would sound okay

42:01.160 --> 42:05.480
but if you wanted to make a copy of that mixed tape it would sound really awful

42:05.560 --> 42:09.880
and this lacking a loss of fidelity upon each copy

42:09.880 --> 42:14.440
there is a there is a equivalent to that in the copying of RNA

42:14.440 --> 42:17.480
that is orders of magnitude more important than the copy

42:17.480 --> 42:22.120
than in the copying of DNA and that's why an analogy for RNA

42:22.120 --> 42:28.120
versus DNA a useful one might be an audiotape versus a CD if you make a

42:28.120 --> 42:31.560
mixed CD and then you made a copy of that CD it would be a

42:31.560 --> 42:34.680
pretty decent copy to listen to but it's not the same with

42:34.680 --> 42:37.960
audiotape and so I'm making the argument that

42:37.960 --> 42:42.440
like audiotape an RNA signal found in the anus of a bat

42:42.440 --> 42:46.040
or found in the lung of a sick child is not a

42:46.040 --> 42:50.440
culturable signal that can be made infinite quantities of

42:50.440 --> 42:53.960
you can't just grab it and go and then you know put some more in the culture

42:53.960 --> 42:57.400
and pull some more out and that that's always been a problem

42:57.400 --> 42:59.800
for them and the way that they overcome it is a

42:59.800 --> 43:05.000
technique that is who's who's um the credit for

43:05.000 --> 43:07.400
inventing it has been given to Ralph Barrick by the

43:07.400 --> 43:10.280
by the narrative by the tv but in reality these are just

43:10.280 --> 43:15.080
standard bench techniques for putting two pieces of DNA together

43:15.080 --> 43:18.680
and in this case the the DNA that they're putting together that they're

43:18.680 --> 43:22.120
ligating together is actually DNA that is the

43:22.120 --> 43:26.200
copy of a genome that they say they found in the wild so they make this DNA

43:26.200 --> 43:30.200
copy and I put a little CD here to indicate that this is a high

43:30.200 --> 43:35.240
fidelity copy and because a coronavirus genome is so long they need to divide

43:35.240 --> 43:38.680
it in a few plasmids and so that's where the

43:38.680 --> 43:42.840
ligation comes in you have five pieces that you can

43:42.840 --> 43:46.760
that you can grow in a bacterial culture and then those five pieces need to be

43:46.760 --> 43:50.760
ligated together into one genome and that ligation step

43:50.760 --> 43:53.640
requires a sort of puzzle piece to be cut

43:53.640 --> 43:58.280
in both ends of those of those plasmids and then that puzzle piece cut is

43:58.280 --> 44:03.320
actually done by a specific enzyme and so with very clever choices

44:03.320 --> 44:06.920
of codons you can actually make an assembly kit

44:06.920 --> 44:11.160
for coronavirus genomes that you can kind of insert pieces into

44:11.160 --> 44:16.680
and this methodology has been blamed for again that that sewing

44:16.680 --> 44:20.040
icon that I put on the worst case scenario it is

44:20.040 --> 44:24.360
it is the stitching of things together and using this technique to do it

44:24.360 --> 44:29.800
that then leads to a huge quantity of DNA and this is the part where Kevin

44:29.800 --> 44:33.240
McCurnan seems to want to try and obfuscate the

44:33.240 --> 44:38.600
idea of clones the problem is with clones is that when you make this DNA

44:38.600 --> 44:42.440
in a bacterial culture you can make as much as you want

44:42.440 --> 44:46.920
and so when you convert it to RNA there's only one step

44:46.920 --> 44:50.760
from converting it to DNA and RNA so there's a limited amount of errors that

44:50.760 --> 44:53.800
will be made and since you're moving from a

44:53.800 --> 44:58.520
pure template of DNA to a limited amount of errors of RNA

44:58.520 --> 45:04.200
you will produce a purity of this full genome that doesn't exist when you

45:04.200 --> 45:07.560
sample these from nature because when you sample them from nature

45:07.560 --> 45:12.840
the mRNA makes a bunch of subgenomic RNAs that overwhelm the RNA signal and

45:13.320 --> 45:18.200
the full genome is almost undetectable and this gets overcome if you do it this

45:18.200 --> 45:21.720
way because you have a DNA copy of the full genome that you

45:21.720 --> 45:26.360
convert to RNA so there's no subgenomic RNA produced

45:26.360 --> 45:29.960
you're not even using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase you're using an RNA

45:29.960 --> 45:33.080
polymerase that has been commercially optimized

45:33.080 --> 45:37.240
and what this allows you to do is produce cell cultures that are

45:37.240 --> 45:41.880
replicable and everybody can use your your DNA you can just make or RNA you

45:41.880 --> 45:44.840
can just make more of it from the DNA that you made you can make more DNA if

45:44.840 --> 45:49.080
you want you can also make replicable cell

45:49.080 --> 45:52.200
animal models of these infections and you can also share it with people the

45:52.200 --> 45:56.920
worst part about this is just like the mRNA shot you can you can

45:56.920 --> 46:01.560
produce industrial quantities of this it doesn't have to be small batch brewing

46:01.560 --> 46:06.440
you can do a giant batch of this cDNA and then convert it

46:06.440 --> 46:10.760
all to RNA and you will have a large quantity of infectious RNA

46:10.760 --> 46:16.040
that could have never ever ever ever been generated in any other way because

46:16.040 --> 46:20.360
of the nature of RNA copying and fidelity

46:20.360 --> 46:24.200
and so they have indeed used this for all RNA papers

46:24.200 --> 46:28.360
forever this is what they do now they find a signal they make a clone

46:28.360 --> 46:31.640
and now if you want to use my clone i can send it to you

46:31.640 --> 46:35.640
this is an example of a paper that was done in 2019 right before the pandemic

46:35.640 --> 46:39.080
where they use human coronavirus 229e and they make a

46:39.080 --> 46:43.000
clone of it they take this clone and they put it

46:43.000 --> 46:45.960
into a cell culture and they look for the sub-genomic

46:45.960 --> 46:49.480
RNAs to be transcribed and they're trying to look for the

46:49.480 --> 46:53.160
the relative ratio that they're produced in

46:53.160 --> 46:58.200
and so i'm going to skip this slide when they when they find the

46:58.200 --> 47:02.600
this is kind of a hard graph to read but what you're looking for

47:02.600 --> 47:07.720
are these signals here and what level they are relative to the x axis

47:07.720 --> 47:11.720
sorry the y axis hello and so as you go up

47:11.720 --> 47:15.960
in in in the y axis you go up in abundance

47:15.960 --> 47:19.960
and the coverage here so what you're covering is the full genome which is

47:19.960 --> 47:24.280
listed on the bottom so this ORF1a and ORF1b

47:24.280 --> 47:28.200
are where all these magic proteins are which are able to copy the viral genome

47:28.200 --> 47:31.960
but also make the sub-genomic RNAs that are necessary for viral

47:31.960 --> 47:35.320
replication and assembly according to virologists

47:35.320 --> 47:39.080
the interesting thing is is when copying begins

47:39.080 --> 47:45.000
using this clone the vast majority of sub-genomic RNAs that are present

47:45.000 --> 47:49.720
are the n protein the m protein the e protein a protein called number four

47:49.720 --> 47:56.600
and the s protein and in fact when you look for full-length RNAs

47:56.600 --> 48:00.920
they only found two so while there were

48:00.920 --> 48:04.840
somewhere between five and eight thousand copies of the n protein in

48:04.840 --> 48:07.880
some of these transcripts a lot of these are are high numbers

48:07.880 --> 48:11.320
then there are different lengths and different variations of that fragment

48:11.320 --> 48:14.760
there were only two fragments that could qualify as anywhere

48:14.760 --> 48:18.360
near full length now we could have missed some

48:18.360 --> 48:22.040
except the problem is is that we've seen this same signal even in the old days

48:22.040 --> 48:24.760
when we were doing it in old ways when we were still

48:24.760 --> 48:29.720
really just being able to look at MR RNA and looking at whole fractions in

48:29.720 --> 48:35.320
gel pull downs they still saw the the full genome is almost invisible

48:35.320 --> 48:39.640
it's almost impossible to find and so this is a very consistent signal

48:39.640 --> 48:43.320
it's probably not the limitations of nanopore sequencing in that latest

48:43.320 --> 48:46.760
paper because this signals the same

48:46.760 --> 48:51.480
when a coronavirus RNA replicates it very rarely makes a full copy of itself so

48:51.480 --> 48:55.080
how in the world are these things spreading from person to person

48:55.080 --> 48:58.520
it definitely isn't the way that the cartoon describes it that's the reason

48:58.520 --> 49:01.640
why this story doesn't make sense that it's really hard to culture

49:01.640 --> 49:04.760
well if the virus was making perfect copies of itself it would be easy to

49:04.760 --> 49:08.040
culture but it's not it's making very poor copies of

49:08.040 --> 49:12.200
itself many of the copies are non-replication competent that makes it

49:12.200 --> 49:15.560
difficult to culture coronavirus is from the wild

49:15.560 --> 49:19.640
the solution that they've come up with is to take that RNA sequence that they

49:19.640 --> 49:23.400
find in the wild turn it into cDNA constructs that can be

49:23.400 --> 49:26.360
grown in high quantities in a bacterial culture

49:26.360 --> 49:30.520
they can then use any number of ways to convert that cDNA

49:30.520 --> 49:34.040
to RNA you don't have to get into that now and in fact because we're in a talk

49:34.040 --> 49:37.400
with with somebody like Kevin McCurnan it would be really silly for me to try

49:37.400 --> 49:39.720
and wax intellectual about all the details of that

49:39.720 --> 49:44.040
but the point is is that when they do this they are able to create

49:44.040 --> 49:50.040
a purity level of a single copy many many copies of a pure RNA that can't

49:50.040 --> 49:54.120
exist in nature because of the nature of replicating RNA

49:54.120 --> 49:59.720
now the the trick is is that up until now no one has really tried to measure

49:59.720 --> 50:04.440
the infectious ratio of a coronavirus swarm in an animal or in nature or

50:04.440 --> 50:07.080
anywhere else but my guess is it's a lot different

50:07.080 --> 50:10.120
than one to one or 10 to one or even 50 to one

50:10.120 --> 50:13.480
the point is is that if you make an RNA copy

50:13.480 --> 50:18.520
or sorry a DNA master copy you can make lots of copies of the same RNA and you

50:18.520 --> 50:22.680
will have averted this problem that makes it so difficult to culture

50:22.680 --> 50:27.080
coronaviruses from the wild so are you are you suggesting that they're

50:27.080 --> 50:30.440
making um so you know if you put that infectious

50:30.440 --> 50:33.320
clone into a mammalian cell you're going to get a very similar

50:33.320 --> 50:38.520
output to what um SARS does right the the replicated machinery is going to

50:38.520 --> 50:42.600
make this really odd array of different expression from the N gene the M gene

50:42.600 --> 50:46.280
and uh because it has to right if you want to actually stoichiometrically

50:46.280 --> 50:50.520
put one genomic piece of DNA or RNA into a capsid

50:50.520 --> 50:53.880
you have to make like a hundred to a thousand spikes a hundred to a thousand

50:53.880 --> 50:57.320
you know n proteins envelope protein so so they're going to express a lot more

50:57.320 --> 51:00.920
that junk at the end of the molecule just to make that assemble correctly

51:00.920 --> 51:04.520
are you suggesting that that to do an infectious clone release you'd have to

51:04.520 --> 51:07.960
like take the clones grow them in a co-lide like they're doing through the

51:07.960 --> 51:12.040
vaccines and then purify them and then make a lot of T7

51:12.040 --> 51:16.280
like RNA off of it and then infect people with the RNA somehow

51:16.280 --> 51:19.480
because in that case it would be it would be linear it all be one molecule it

51:19.480 --> 51:22.920
wouldn't be all diced up in having this this different type of um

51:22.920 --> 51:27.480
expression profile that we see in nature right so that's that's kind of my point

51:27.480 --> 51:32.440
is that if you did that you would have a an infectious clone would be

51:32.440 --> 51:38.280
and not a accurate representation of what SARS does when it's on its own

51:38.280 --> 51:42.280
so the question becomes ladies and gentlemen what in the world is this

51:42.280 --> 51:45.960
all about why in the world all of a sudden in

51:45.960 --> 51:50.920
January of 2024 do I after being blocked for a year and just kind of

51:50.920 --> 51:54.760
ignoring him do I still get this kind of vitriol when

51:54.760 --> 52:00.120
when we discussed it live over that was in March of 2000 of last year

52:00.120 --> 52:03.640
when we discussed it live he didn't have this went on

52:03.640 --> 52:06.760
there was 15 more minutes of that discussion where we discussed

52:06.760 --> 52:09.880
all of these principles and he didn't think it was crazy

52:09.880 --> 52:14.360
and yet yes sir well what's that uh

52:14.360 --> 52:18.440
we have had Kevin McGurnan on as a guest but that I can't remember what he

52:18.440 --> 52:20.680
looks like was that him then that was him then

52:20.680 --> 52:24.920
absolutely right and so here he is calling me uh

52:24.920 --> 52:30.120
Keystone Cop clone chemtrail hypothesis when we've discussed it many times

52:30.120 --> 52:34.120
and he didn't call it this and so well he seemed a little bit exercised there

52:34.120 --> 52:38.440
I think when he was challenging you uh that's okay I don't have any

52:38.440 --> 52:42.440
problem with that oh no I know I you know I yes okay

52:42.440 --> 52:45.240
I was just calling the first thing that he says is that

52:45.240 --> 52:49.960
in this comment is that co is coronavirus has circled the globe every year he

52:49.960 --> 52:53.640
also says that they hyper optimize the receptor binding domain

52:53.640 --> 52:58.120
and that equals fast spread now that wasn't the way it was it was actually

52:58.120 --> 53:01.800
we turned this off it was actually the fear and cleavage site that was blamed

53:01.800 --> 53:07.480
for that for quite some time um then we have this uh

53:07.480 --> 53:11.720
then we have uh it could not spread as fast as what he said and so it has to be

53:11.720 --> 53:15.080
already endemic but but but I was I've been

53:15.080 --> 53:18.040
explaining that to him that this is a background

53:18.040 --> 53:21.800
and that if there is a background that's being confounded by the PCR then we

53:21.800 --> 53:25.240
would we were just being misled he is purposefully

53:25.240 --> 53:30.200
ignoring that for more than two years

53:30.200 --> 53:33.800
and what so Kevin why just let me go forward let me go forward

53:33.800 --> 53:37.880
ask it at the end ceding clone hypothesis is chemtrail retarded is not a

53:37.880 --> 53:42.360
scientific discussion here this is it a this is a multi-millionaire

53:42.360 --> 53:47.080
wasting his time on his own sub stack trying to trash somebody who has 3,000

53:47.080 --> 53:51.480
followers and was just laid off from chd

53:51.480 --> 53:56.200
like what why does he even need to waste his time doing this unless there is a

53:56.200 --> 54:00.120
reason and the reason is is because this idea

54:00.120 --> 54:05.160
is the right answer you infect a few people with a clone so that you get the

54:05.160 --> 54:07.960
same sequence in any place that you look for it

54:07.960 --> 54:11.240
and if it lasts for a little while or a few days

54:11.240 --> 54:14.120
it doesn't matter I don't know how long it will last I don't know how much

54:14.120 --> 54:19.320
quantity they would use I don't care the point is is that this biology is

54:19.320 --> 54:23.320
real the papers are hundreds and to argue about

54:23.320 --> 54:28.280
whether or not RNA replicates at this at this fidelity or that fidelity

54:28.280 --> 54:32.680
doesn't change the fact that that these clones are used

54:32.680 --> 54:37.640
to make coronavirus biology replicable in each

54:37.640 --> 54:41.880
in each experiment if you don't do that then the moment you do an experiment

54:41.880 --> 54:45.320
with a coronavirus you can't replicate it because it's gone

54:45.320 --> 54:50.040
and so this keystone cop chemtrail hypothesis insult is actually an

54:50.040 --> 54:53.880
admission that this is actually real there's no other way

54:53.880 --> 54:57.640
that this guy with a cannabis company is going to be touring the world talking

54:57.640 --> 55:03.000
about these shots and so leaking the virus is better he's

55:03.000 --> 55:06.040
actually arguing that real viruses have

55:06.040 --> 55:10.440
have attributes that clones don't

55:10.440 --> 55:14.440
and the most important thing and to understand is that in all of his time

55:14.440 --> 55:17.960
and all of his podcasts and all of the microphones he's ever had

55:17.960 --> 55:22.200
he's never once pointed out that on top of all this they were really exaggerating

55:22.200 --> 55:26.200
the danger of whatever it was and that the protocols in America probably

55:26.200 --> 55:30.440
caused mass casualty events that were misconstrued as spread

55:30.440 --> 55:35.320
and so the defense of there are viruses the defense of

55:35.320 --> 55:41.000
the relative replication competence of viruses is irrelevant if you don't

55:41.000 --> 55:44.440
actually acknowledge that there's this giant body

55:44.440 --> 55:49.240
of misleading media coverage that went on for years

55:49.240 --> 55:53.800
and these people ignore all of it and make us focus on clones

55:53.880 --> 55:57.720
and talk about whether or not i'm right or or a little off on the

55:57.720 --> 56:01.880
replication competence of a particular gene in the coronavirus genome

56:01.880 --> 56:06.600
it's absolutely absurd and you can see it here because in that same

56:06.600 --> 56:11.640
video from march of last year uh Jessica Rose says that it's the best

56:11.640 --> 56:15.080
idea she's ever heard and it explains almost everything here is the

56:15.080 --> 56:18.360
the sub-stack that she wrote after that article it says by the way a massive

56:18.360 --> 56:22.520
thank you to Jonathan Cooley, Matthew Crawford, John Bodwin and Mark Gerda Do

56:22.520 --> 56:26.360
for the Thursday night chats you know who Mark Gerda Do is he's the guy who

56:26.360 --> 56:29.400
claims that it's a bolus effect and if you just hit a vein

56:29.400 --> 56:33.480
that that's where autism comes from you know who Matthew Crawford is you

56:33.480 --> 56:37.560
know who John Bodwin is you know who uh Jessica Rose is this

56:37.560 --> 56:42.600
is a description of the Steve Kirsch steering committee that used to meet

56:42.600 --> 56:45.960
on every Thursday night where i would explain this stuff to these people that

56:45.960 --> 56:49.080
now ignore it the only person who covers this

56:49.080 --> 56:53.800
idea is Matthew Crawford. Mark Gerda Do insists that it's still

56:53.800 --> 56:58.200
just injection and missing the vein. John Bodwin is talking about what he

56:58.200 --> 57:01.800
needs to talk about and he's every time he says that the protocols were

57:01.800 --> 57:07.480
murdered somebody cuts him off. We need to wake up to the idea that we

57:07.480 --> 57:11.240
have been lied to and that there are people who are actively lying to us they

57:11.240 --> 57:16.120
are obfuscating the truth about this and they they even go so far as to say

57:16.200 --> 57:21.240
that the viral swarm isn't real even though they have to admit that RNA

57:21.240 --> 57:24.600
cannot be copied perfectly if it can't be copied perfectly the swarm is real

57:24.600 --> 57:26.840
done

57:27.640 --> 57:31.000
and so they have there's an orchestrated campaign to make this

57:31.000 --> 57:34.600
diffuse proposal real so that this fear and cleavage site becomes real again

57:34.600 --> 57:37.880
and so that this cover-up becomes real again and so you think that we think

57:37.880 --> 57:41.160
that our families think that we need to teach our kids

57:41.160 --> 57:45.320
that this was a solved mystery and that Fauci and eco-health alliance are guilty

57:45.320 --> 57:49.080
of this we need to return RNA to real again

57:49.080 --> 57:54.680
we need to return the biology of RNA and clones real again

57:54.680 --> 57:58.760
that's what we need to do and now i'm going to use this analogy and then i'm

57:58.760 --> 58:02.120
going to wrap up but look very carefully at this guy this

58:02.120 --> 58:06.360
Italian guy pretending to stop this subway

58:06.360 --> 58:11.320
and so he gets on and he pulls it to a stop and then he's going to go over here

58:11.320 --> 58:14.760
and he's going to chalk up his his hands and he's going to pretend that he's

58:14.760 --> 58:19.000
doing this now what i want you to understand is that the more people

58:19.000 --> 58:22.920
and please do this thought experiment if you haven't already the more people

58:22.920 --> 58:26.760
that he recruited to do this act the more convincing it would be

58:26.760 --> 58:29.960
especially if you were a young person or you didn't know anything about

58:29.960 --> 58:33.720
electric trains and the bigger the people were

58:33.720 --> 58:38.920
the more animated they were the more lights and and and sparks that that they

58:38.920 --> 58:42.920
had in their in their uniform or or more tools that they used

58:42.920 --> 58:46.520
and more noises that you heard as the train stopped or the train went away

58:46.520 --> 58:49.160
the more convincing it would become that these people

58:49.160 --> 58:53.400
were stopping and starting the train and i want you to think about the pandemic

58:53.400 --> 58:55.960
as something like this that if enough people

58:55.960 --> 58:59.960
were to act like there's a pandemic to agree

58:59.960 --> 59:04.440
to fight about what the pandemic is that you would be bamboozled by it you

59:04.440 --> 59:07.080
would think wow look at all these it must be

59:07.080 --> 59:10.200
and if you were one who really wanted to participate you might even be

59:10.200 --> 59:14.600
invited to hear there here's the tug-of-war pull on the rope

59:14.600 --> 59:18.120
you can help us by pulling on the rope and so you get your position on the

59:18.120 --> 59:21.240
right i yeah jim's raised his hand with a question

59:21.240 --> 59:23.320
oh it's okay good i'll stop right here go ahead jim

59:23.320 --> 59:27.480
well actually jj it was very interesting what you were just saying then you

59:27.480 --> 59:30.520
were interrupted on a key sentence what was that

59:30.520 --> 59:35.800
um well i don't know just that that that um

59:35.800 --> 59:38.920
that all of these people now if you think about how this little

59:38.920 --> 59:42.520
this little cartoon goes the more people that you have standing along the

59:42.520 --> 59:45.800
train the more convincing this this illusion

59:45.800 --> 59:49.160
is and so that people are doing something that matters

59:49.160 --> 59:52.920
and in the in the start of the pandemic do you want to ask your question now jim

59:52.920 --> 59:55.320
go ahead

59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.280
actually i didn't mean to interrupt i just wanted you to address the

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:07.000
uh if you could the different types of spike pro teams that are being

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.960
alleged by a guy named jason mcclellan who supposedly invented the uh

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:18.280
the vaccine um you know i can comment on that a little bit

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.080
are you aware of that guy i'm not aware of that guy but i

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.560
and i don't want to interrupt you i didn't want i didn't mean to interrupt i just

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.360
wanted to get in line early because you're gonna have a lot of questions this

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.720
great talk okay great um so the point would be then

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.840
to get back to this is that the more people you had standing on the train

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.800
that agreed to talk about one thing and that not not question the pandemic

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.520
but just talk about one aspect of it like a novel treatment

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.600
or whether we can build immunity or not or whether T cells are involved or it's

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:50.040
all B cells or is it a natural killer cells

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.960
did the lockdowns work or not i mean are we seeing evidence of masking working

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.360
in in asia or not these debates were all real

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.600
and they were all televised and they were all designed to make sure that you

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.280
didn't question the primary thing that was happening which is that these

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.000
mass casualty events equal spread that these PCR tests

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.720
equal spread and so all of this stuff was scripted it was

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.440
it was gamed it was tabletop exercised for many years they knew

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.120
that they were getting closer and closer to getting it right

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.480
and so i would argue that there are a couple things that we can know for sure

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:33.480
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are underutilized pretty useful drugs

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.640
chances are very good that in a place like america using processed food and

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.080
eating as bad and and exercising as little as they do

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.320
that's something like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin when applied

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.880
to somebody with some immune problem some sickness that it might have some

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.320
general effect even if it's not directly related to whatever that they were

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.280
experiencing the point being that these are underutilized

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.040
pharmaceuticals that have no real danger if they're used properly and even

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.800
their overdosing is probably not that dangerous so you have

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.960
this issue here that if you accept this again this is the mystery

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.520
a novel virus needs novel cures what did they choose they choose novel cures

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.600
that you could argue about without any problem

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.000
and then they also conveniently did really badly design studies that could

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.280
people could argue about people like bret could argue about people like

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.960
p.r. cori could write a whole book about

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.160
i would argue that the double stranded dna is another

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.160
opportunity to make fake helpers join in the vigorous discussion that will

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.080
never question the necessity of the transfection in the first place

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.120
nor will they question the general application of transfection as a

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.760
vaccination methodology because they will say

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.840
like like uh buckholtz did that if this dna is in the shot i would still give

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.080
it to my my parents but i wouldn't give it to my

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.720
daughter he actually said that in front of this

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.920
the the south carolina senate this guy who claims that he was

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.280
whistleblowing on the dna contamination and confirmed that

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.320
kevin mccernan's measurements were right this is a guy who was also very involved

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.840
in the testing for coronavirus for the first two years it's not

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.080
for nothing that he was chosen to be the guy who again stepped in front of

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.240
step to the side of the train and pretend to help stop it

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.520
they praised the methodology and they blamed the rush

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.280
and so the last thing that is is this diffuse proposal and its contents and

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.160
whether or not it's real and whether or not the contents mean that they were

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.240
already done whether these released emails indicate that

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.960
they the experiments were obviously already done

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.240
and just like other aspects of the narrative if you accept this relevance

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.080
or even argue about it you are not arguing about whether r and a can go

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.680
around the planet and change colors

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.440
and they have done this with lots of things

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.240
including meetings all around the world where people are invited and considered

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.320
celebrities and get to go on stage and present their results

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.760
and then somehow or another their results or their objections never

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.760
quite come out of the meeting like they should

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.720
and so in this scenario i just want you to imagine where

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.800
jessica rose is a good guy and and and um

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.400
bairam brittle is a good guy and denny rancor is a good guy and

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.240
and nick hudson's a good guy and ryan and ryan cole's a good guy and they're

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.360
all these people on the stage are pulling

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:29.080
on this tug-of-war but actually when it comes right down to it maybe some of

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.360
these people in yellow aren't actually pulling

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.400
maybe they're not actually going to leave this meeting and tell everybody

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:38.520
everything they heard they're just going to tell everybody some things that they

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.280
heard and that's how they did this throughout the

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.880
entire pandemic by calling me by putting me in signal

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.160
chats and having me give them tutorials on my

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.560
immunology ideas and then not putting them on their podcast

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.920
not telling anybody who they were learning this from correcting themselves

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.120
but not giving credit they did this to everyone

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.160
they're doing it to denny rancor right now they're doing it to nick hudson right

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.760
now nick hudson was at this discussion talk

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.560
conference in romania and budepest and nobody ever said that his talk was

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.280
great and i'm sure it was

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.960
and nobody's ever said that denny rancor was there and that he showed there was

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.320
no evidence of spread they just show that he shows that 17 million people were

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.200
killed by the shot because that's okay to talk about but

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.320
there the fact that mass casualty events don't

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:32.200
have spread away from them is not okay so they don't talk about it

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:37.240
but denny presented that data and that's how this is done ladies and

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.200
gentlemen they are controlling a narrative about this

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.080
potential and any other parts of this narrative are just discarded

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.880
and they keep bringing you back to this faith

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.240
and keep making it about this phase without making it about there being

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.680
no evidence of spread not making it about the projected

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.520
medicare costs that were saved in america and around the world especially in

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.520
america and not making it about strict liability

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:07.000
in america in in our law where the way that we speak about what happens with

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.440
regular pharmaceuticals it's strict liability you're responsible for the

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.440
damage that's done with your product and we have we don't apply that to

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.680
vaccines we could just change that but nobody talks about it

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.000
we have this separate system called ci

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.520
cp and vicp which are two kangaroo courts

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.840
where all of the claims against vaccine manufacturers are brought and

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.280
the u.s. government pays all of those damages they even pay for lawyers that

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.080
bring losing cases

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.840
and in our constitution it says in the seventh amendment that we have the

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.960
right to sue for damages over twenty dollars so that seems to kind of

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.280
contradict because we're not allowed to sue

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.640
vaccine manufacturers we have to use a kangaroo court

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.720
it seems that that's a pretty pretty obvious violation of our seventh

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.720
amendment i know they have it

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.160
but what have you got to mute yourself

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.000
it seems like a regular that's a violation of the seventh amendment but

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.160
nobody ever talks about that none of the lawyers that have been in front of

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.160
this in this group have ever said to you that one of the ways that we could win

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.680
is that we could take a single vaccine injury to

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.840
court in a state and have the state court say no we can't see your

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.200
your claim because of the prep act and then you could

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.720
take that as an appeal to the federal court and have the federal court strike

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:28.120
the prep act has unconstitutional we could be done in months

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.840
but nobody's doing that and that should tell you all you need to know

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.960
with all of this biology that i have to teach

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:43.640
i got laid off and not from from from a university this time

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.080
and so i think the most important thing to understand is this

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.120
teamwork case scenario is real some of them were co-opted some of them were

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.720
forced some of them were coerced some of them did it gladly

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.000
some of them were in place before the pandemic and found themselves between

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.960
a rock and a hard place as part of this

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.320
control mechanism in the media and then wow do i really have to go along with

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.040
this yes you do and we are victims of this

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.640
our children are victims of this because they are being misled to believe that

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.120
something real happened that could happen again

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:21.080
and that thank goodness transfection worked pretty well for grandma

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.200
and it all started with this illusion here

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.000
spike protein and antibodies and the antibodies from infection being very

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.240
much weak compared to the vaccine antibodies this is a picture that's

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:38.120
taken from Francis Collins his own blog in july of 2020

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.640
this is the illusion in a nutshell this is the

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.040
lie in a nutshell the variants go on into the future and your infection

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.240
antibodies are useless

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.320
and depending on who you got in the car with you would have heard all this

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.440
you would have heard arguments about all this if you were lucky enough to get in

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.680
the car with thomas binder well good but then you would have had to survive

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.560
four years with people telling you that thomas binder was crazy

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.920
and that's the new world order that they want to teach our kids that's the new

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.240
world order they want us to teach our kids and our teachers are doing it

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.080
our college professors are doing it the college administrators are doing it

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:23.080
soon this lie like in the book 1984 is going to be forgotten to become truth

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.520
and so it's up to us to teach our kids the way out of this it's up to us to

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.920
teach our kids that they have been fooled by this

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.480
that these changes are real that they are being

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.720
transitioned to submit to a digital id and digital currency the digital id is

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.440
not a big deal because if you have a phone you already have it

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.120
you're being tracked and monitored in ways that a digital id won't even do

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.000
it's the digital currency you need to be afraid of of course but i'm not an

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.720
expert in this stuff i just know that they're probably right people like

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.200
michael edan are probably right this is the

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.680
this is the next stage and they want you to believe that one of their excuses

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.400
for this one of the excuses for this level of control

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.840
is the the ongoing threat of gain of function viruses this is most

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.280
important to understand we cannot let our children get on this train

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.720
where we believe that we've defeated all diseases in the past by vaccination

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.000
that we believe that novel coronaviruses can jump

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.440
want them to believe that asymptomatic is a spread is what they need to think

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.280
about they're already telling people in in america that rsv is

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.120
is asymptomatic and that that they need to be concerned about all of these

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.880
respiratory viruses as being asymptomatic this is a train

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.720
that our kids are currently on and we have very little time to get them off of

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.240
it before they have their own kids and teach them that this is the reality

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.520
and so we need to get them off this train we need to get them out of this

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.520
new world order so that this isn't erased the way to think about this in case

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.960
you're not uh there is that they have told us that we have an

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.840
ongoing RNA viral pandemic that started in 2020 and has been going on for

01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.920
five years five years of sustained RNA transmission that started in a point

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.640
in a puddle at an animal cage and has gone around the world

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.520
since it leaked that's ridiculous but it is a faith that no one questions

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.040
and it is a faith that your children can be trapped in if you don't

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.520
start pointing it out to them that we are in the fifth year of this lie

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.880
i never thought we'd get this far

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.560
and you can see it as a background they don't know what was in the background

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.080
before it could be just noise like on a radio that they've turned really loud

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.520
and then told you there's organization inside of it

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.960
and this RNA signal being confounded as spread

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:41.160
could have been seeded they could have seeded the the sequence using RNA or

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.080
RNA clones or the DNA construct and put it in sewers

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.440
and the PCR would have been positive some people would have probably complained

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.240
because the spike protein and end protein are immunogenic and would have

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.280
annoyed their immune system so a transfection by a clone

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.440
would have done everything and more to create and see the illusion of the

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.680
pandemic without endangering anybody except for the people who bought in

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.560
so the way to see these people that are meddling with us is they don't ever

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.040
talk about the childhood vaccine schedule as being

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.800
as being criminal i heard Pierre Corey on Jimmy Dorr last night saying it was

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.800
criminal and i loved it um so good for Pierre Corey

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.760
advocate for strict liability of all pharmaceutical products that's the way

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.960
you speak to lawyers you just say no i'm not i don't want to talk about

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.480
all this other stuff why don't we advocate for strict liability why don't we

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.920
use the seventh amendment to strike this prep act we need to start saying that

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.200
regularly investigate the use of deadly protocols to create

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.320
mass casualty events that were misconstrued as spread

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.920
and investigate whether or not transfection could have been used to compound

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.800
that problem or to create the molecular illusion of it

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.720
um declare or take your sovereignty back from your

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.080
from them and and and the sovereignty of your children and withdraw from the

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.200
who in the u.n. entirely and if you want to see the medlers they're not

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.560
talking about this stuff they rarely cite the deadly protocols that's

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.200
number three um they rarely use the word

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.000
transfection although Brett Weinstein occasionally does

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.440
they never use the word clone to explain anything and in fact if they use the

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.600
word clone they use it to ridicule me and finally they attack people instead

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.880
of ideas and they are unable to summarize across the entire show and

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.880
that's really evident with somebody like um with somebody like Kevin

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.480
McCurnan who has defended transfection in the past by saying i hope we don't

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.440
throw the bat the baby out with the bath water because of this

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.080
contamination and has also very distinctly

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.040
not spoken up about any of the protocols ever which of course were used to justify

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.920
the rollout of this product and if you really wanted to bring

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.760
everybody to attention and to understand how badly with bamboozled you would

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.640
tell the whole story at least in a nutshell and not just say it's double

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.560
shredded DNA and then my hair's on fire

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.000
and the reason why they're doing in this is because the rich people in in

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.960
private meetings have been saying for a long time we got to start collecting

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:59.320
this data from these people before they're gone

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.440
and since we're going to get rid of them we should start collecting that data they

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.800
want your kids and they want your kids kids so this is a multi-generational

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.920
thing you don't have to think about this going to be over in a couple years

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.280
this is not going to stop because they've convinced themselves that if they

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.120
collect enough data and the AI evolves that we're eventually going to solve

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.080
all this and we're going to become the transhuman futurist that everybody

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.120
wants us to be so please stop transfection human because

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.920
they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.920
that's the end i'm open for questions thank you

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.000
well done jj great sorry that was so long
