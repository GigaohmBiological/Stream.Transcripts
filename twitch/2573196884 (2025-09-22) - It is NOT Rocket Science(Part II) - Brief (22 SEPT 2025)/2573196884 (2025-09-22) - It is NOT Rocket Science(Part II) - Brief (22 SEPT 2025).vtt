WEBVTT

00:03.992 --> 00:05.373
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:05.393 --> 00:07.834
We're going to start with the second half of this show.

00:09.154 --> 00:11.235
Welcome to GigaOM Biological.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.876
This is for all the marbles.

00:13.856 --> 00:16.137
This is for the grandchildren of Earth, ladies and gentlemen.

00:16.157 --> 00:17.138
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

00:17.158 --> 00:20.679
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

00:21.459 --> 00:24.520
I used to be a scientific advisor for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.302
before I realized he was nothing but a scripted national security actor.

00:29.442 --> 00:43.247
And behind him are a number of other national security actors that collectively, I think, represent a treasonous level of contribution to American history that needs to be addressed in a significant way.

00:43.847 --> 00:46.328
And I feel very alone in this, but that's okay.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.750
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea, and I'm sure of that.

00:51.170 --> 00:54.311
Transfection is an old idea, and I'm sure of that.

00:55.311 --> 00:57.712
RNA cannot pandemic, I'm pretty sure about that.

00:58.172 --> 01:03.337
And autism, being a meaningless word by design, is an absolute certainty.

01:03.737 --> 01:05.018
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:05.098 --> 01:12.425
Don't forget that this background signal was based on a biological signal that they saw coming for decades.

01:12.985 --> 01:21.193
And that's why, of course, this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality can be seen in this very simple graph.

01:24.762 --> 01:27.504
And that's what makes it so easy to get through this.

01:27.584 --> 01:31.027
Ladies and gentlemen, please download the PeerTube app and watch me using it.

01:32.448 --> 01:34.890
And our website, stream.gigaohm.bio.

01:35.651 --> 01:38.133
I am very excited that that app is working so well.

01:38.914 --> 01:40.335
Thank you very much for being here again.

01:40.415 --> 01:42.456
We are part of a two-party theater.

01:43.177 --> 01:53.945
which cannot be dismissed as something that only affects the way that certain politicians behave, or the way that certain people behave, or the way that certain courts behave.

01:54.646 --> 02:08.796
This is an all-encompassing national security narrative, a theater which is performed by these people with the express objective of always maintaining control over the American machine.

02:10.069 --> 02:19.194
Think of it as a very large aircraft carrier, a starship destroyer, and nobody is on that ship looking for a job to do.

02:19.635 --> 02:22.576
Nobody's on that ship being randomly assigned what to do.

02:22.977 --> 02:28.960
It is a very fine-tuned, highly, highly organized performance.

02:30.221 --> 02:38.526
And on an aircraft carrier, that could involve thousands of sailors doing their job very skillfully and knowing exactly how to do it relative to the other sailors.

02:40.703 --> 02:52.860
And so there is no way that we can look at the Trump administration and RFK at the head of HHS as, you know, guys that got there because they're grifters or because some dumb people on the Internet voted for them.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.465
We have to see them being there as an intentional

02:57.898 --> 03:05.120
product of a national security theater, and then question why it would be that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.920
would be put in the place that he's been put.

03:07.300 --> 03:14.561
Why would an Indian like J. Bhattacharya, with no qualifications at all, be put at the head of NIH?

03:14.622 --> 03:19.703
Why would an Egyptian UK citizen be put at the head of the FDA?

03:19.763 --> 03:21.283
Why is there a foreigner at the head

03:21.963 --> 03:22.464
of DITRA?

03:22.504 --> 03:24.608
Why is there a foreigner at the head of the U.S.

03:24.768 --> 03:25.008
Emirate?

03:25.048 --> 03:28.253
Why is there a foreigner at the head of Rocky Mountain Laboratories?

03:28.334 --> 03:34.964
Why are there foreigners all over the United States government and with people in our government with foreign passports?

03:35.044 --> 03:36.427
Why aren't we talking about that?

03:39.597 --> 03:58.445
because this whole thing is a national security theater and these people are national security actors and so the diary of a ceo as i told you earlier this morning is a podcast with a staff of 50 employees that's not by accident or because they're so successful that's by design that is a militarily

04:00.723 --> 04:23.477
sponsored or a paramilitary organization on the internet just like a lot of this like rift tv this is a joke ladies and gentlemen these are all people that are sponsored by willy-nilly people that are willing to go along with the script because they know that we are being governed by these people they know it's not real they know that donald trump is just a friend of

04:23.877 --> 04:24.557
Hillary Clinton.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.820
They know that Steve Bannon and Harvey Weinstein go back decades.

04:28.880 --> 04:36.085
They know that Aaron Siri worked for the Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court as a clerk.

04:36.125 --> 04:39.267
They know that he worked for Silverstein after 9-11.

04:39.307 --> 04:41.728
They know that he worked for Oracle as a lawyer.

04:41.769 --> 04:53.256
They know that Aaron Siri is a fraud because they know that he used to work for Goldman Sachs just like Steve Bannon did before he was set up as a movie producer or whatever.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.429
And so this is a really extraordinary time in U.S.

04:57.449 --> 05:00.271
history because- We are joined with, I think, a new guest.

05:00.711 --> 05:02.713
Dan, I don't think I've ever had you on this show.

05:02.853 --> 05:03.413
Dan Cohen.

05:03.973 --> 05:04.514
How you doing, man?

05:04.534 --> 05:05.014
You doing okay?

05:05.575 --> 05:06.555
I'm good, I'm good.

05:07.776 --> 05:11.259
We can finally see into how America is governed.

05:11.299 --> 05:14.581
And now the only question is, who is the actor?

05:14.921 --> 05:18.464
Who are the scripted actors that are left yet to be exposed?

05:19.444 --> 05:20.025
Who are they?

05:21.428 --> 05:23.970
And they can be unwitting scripted actors.

05:24.030 --> 05:28.273
They can be unwitting in the sense of they don't have the requisite knowledge to see through it.

05:28.313 --> 05:33.738
But Dan has been communicating with me behind the scenes for almost three years now.

05:34.398 --> 05:38.181
And so you have to keep that in mind as you listen to him talk.

05:38.401 --> 05:46.668
There's a tweet that you responded to and I kind of want to dig into the tweet because I'm interested in this aspect of Charlie Kirk's death.

05:47.958 --> 05:55.540
I've been fascinated by the way each side has been trying to use them as a cudgel to hit the other side.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.081
It's almost like there wasn't a real... Let's see if I can find it.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.903
There's apparently an announcement right now happening.

06:07.717 --> 06:08.977
So let's see about the announcement.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.398
It's a fairly established, mature pathway.

06:11.478 --> 06:14.178
Again, we have a duty to let doctors and the public know.

06:14.518 --> 06:16.579
We are going to change the label to make it available.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.940
Hundreds of thousands of kids, in my opinion, will benefit.

06:20.080 --> 06:30.202
One study found that with kids with autism and chronic folate deficiency, 2 thirds of kids with autism symptoms had improvement, and some marked improvement.

06:31.141 --> 06:37.443
Mr. President, you told us to do what's medically right, to go bold, and not worry about the corporations and the lobbyists.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.584
Chronic folate deficiency, probably caused by Tylenol.

06:41.665 --> 06:43.445
Tylenol use during pregnancy.

06:43.625 --> 06:44.926
Holy shit.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.946
Look at Bobby.

06:46.026 --> 06:47.167
Look at Bobby.

06:47.247 --> 06:48.687
I'm gonna go back.

06:48.747 --> 06:49.848
I can't believe it.

06:49.888 --> 06:52.368
Since 2000, autism rates have surged by

07:00.089 --> 07:01.750
much more than 400 percent.

07:03.051 --> 07:11.118
Instead of attacking those who ask questions, everyone should be grateful for those who are trying to get the answers to this complex situation.

07:12.539 --> 07:19.124
And the first day all of these great doctors behind me were there, I told them, this is what we got to — we have to find out.

07:19.824 --> 07:28.371
Because when you go from 20,000 to 10,000, and then you go to 12, you know there's something artificial.

07:28.711 --> 07:29.732
They're taking something.

07:30.692 --> 07:38.135
And by the way, I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism.

07:39.696 --> 07:40.736
That have no autism.

07:41.917 --> 07:43.017
Does that tell you something?

07:43.097 --> 07:43.857
That's currently.

07:44.318 --> 07:45.898
Is that a correct statement, by the way?

07:47.439 --> 07:47.699
The Amish.

07:47.719 --> 07:47.879
Yeah.

07:56.092 --> 07:57.993
What a remarkable answer that is.

07:58.033 --> 08:05.800
He's got a whole book about vaxxed versus unvaxxed studies with some clown named Brian Hooker.

08:07.822 --> 08:11.425
And his response was, yeah, there are some studies.

08:11.806 --> 08:16.290
He wrote a whole book with a guy who's supposed to be a whistleblower.

08:17.964 --> 08:29.774
Brian Hooker, who in 2013 didn't use the word autism, didn't like to use the word autism because he thought it was a dumb word that didn't describe vaccine damage, the neurological injury that his son had.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.055
He's got a whole book about it.

08:34.097 --> 08:39.041
That is remarkable bullshittery from our Health and Human Services Secretary.

08:39.121 --> 08:39.461
Wow.

08:42.504 --> 08:43.084
Come on, girl.

08:43.825 --> 08:45.366
I heard none.

08:46.187 --> 08:47.528
See, Bobby wants to, yeah.

08:48.064 --> 08:50.565
The Amish.

08:51.005 --> 08:51.945
Yeah.

08:53.006 --> 08:53.526
Virtually.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.107
Is that a correct statement, by the way?

08:57.647 --> 08:59.107
The Amish.

08:59.868 --> 09:02.228
Yeah.

09:03.269 --> 09:03.789
Virtually.

09:04.389 --> 09:05.810
I heard none.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.530
Yeah, the Amish.

09:07.570 --> 09:10.131
You know, that stuff that Steve Kirsch talks about.

09:10.371 --> 09:11.611
Wow!

09:15.132 --> 09:16.893
I mean, Bobby is really a failure.

09:17.967 --> 09:19.568
Bobby is a scripted failure.

09:20.108 --> 09:27.993
And I don't think he's smart enough to know how much of a fool he's being made of.

09:28.073 --> 09:29.934
He is a fool.

09:30.855 --> 09:33.056
He looks like a chump here.

09:33.977 --> 09:47.385
After 15 years of taking half a million dollars a year from salary alone, from children's health defense, this fraud of a man pretending to be a patriot sent by God

09:49.036 --> 09:51.598
says there's a few studies that suggest it.

09:51.758 --> 10:08.970
Even though he released this book in 2023 with Brian Hooker, you know, that dude who was working for 16 years for the US government to try and transform and transfect plants to make medicine, who then came out in 2013 or 14 saying that his kid had autism.

10:09.010 --> 10:13.354
You know, kind of like when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker were starting to break shit apart.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.935
Oh my gosh.

10:16.396 --> 10:17.997
Can you see the clown show here?

10:21.292 --> 10:25.954
Bobby wants to be very careful with what he says, and he should, but I'm not so careful with what I say.

10:26.514 --> 10:32.297
But you have certain groups, the Amish as an example, they have essentially no autism.

10:33.937 --> 10:42.881
First, effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of, well, let's see how we say that.

10:44.142 --> 10:46.263
Acetaminophen.

10:46.284 --> 10:48.105
Acetaminophen.

10:49.005 --> 10:51.447
He doesn't know how to say acetaminophen?

10:51.507 --> 10:58.331
He didn't... He didn't learn how to say Tylenol before the freaking announcement?

10:58.492 --> 11:01.313
Wow, that is so super clown show.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.434
Okay.

11:04.155 --> 11:07.117
Which is basically commonly known as Tylenol.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.900
During pregnancy can be associated

11:11.909 --> 11:16.390
with a very increased risk of autism.

11:17.550 --> 11:22.872
So taking Tylenol is not good.

11:24.072 --> 11:25.572
I'll say it, it's not good.

11:25.592 --> 11:35.255
So are we saying that taking Tylenol causes autism and therefore Mary Holland was full of shit for 10 and a half years?

11:37.270 --> 11:42.292
Are we saying that poly Tommy was, has been full of shit about the MMR or about the DTP?

11:42.392 --> 12:00.420
Or are we saying that all of them have been wrong, including the health and human services secretary, Bobby Kennedy, who's on camera all throughout the last decade saying all kinds of stupid shit that has nothing to do with Tylenol and some kind of deficiency and foliate.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.974
It's remarkable, don't you think?

12:03.434 --> 12:07.241
After 25 years, Sherry Tenpenny never got here.

12:07.942 --> 12:10.206
After 20 years, Brian Hooker never got here.

12:10.526 --> 12:14.734
And now that we're here, we're not saying, wow, we sure screwed that up.

12:17.156 --> 12:19.877
It's so bizarre what's happening right now in America.

12:19.937 --> 12:39.643
It's so bizarre, unless you understand that it's all one giant national security theater and America is designed, it is scripted that America is going to have a civil car crash in the form of Donald Trump's administration being completely discredited from top to bottom as 100% fraudulent.

12:43.615 --> 12:51.939
For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.

12:52.939 --> 13:00.823
That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it.

13:01.063 --> 13:01.903
I guess there's that.

13:02.404 --> 13:05.225
It's a small number of cases, I think.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.386
But if you can't tough it out, if you can't do it,

13:11.351 --> 13:13.433
That's what you're going to have to do.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.457
You'll take etylenol, but it'll be very sparingly.

13:17.477 --> 13:22.282
It can be something that's very dangerous to the woman's health.

13:22.362 --> 13:24.084
In other words, a fever that's very, very

13:25.647 --> 13:33.410
dangerous and ideally a doctor's decision because I think you shouldn't take it and you shouldn't take it during the entire pregnancy.

13:33.450 --> 13:40.193
They may tell you that toward the end of the pregnancy you shouldn't take it during the entire and you shouldn't give the child a Tylenol every time he goes.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.714
He's born and he goes and has a shot.

13:43.794 --> 13:45.915
You shouldn't give a Tylenol to that child.

13:47.057 --> 13:54.218
All pregnant women should talk to their doctors for more information about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant.

13:54.258 --> 13:58.359
So ideally you don't take it at all, but if you have to, if you can't tough it out.

13:58.379 --> 14:06.781
So are we going to blame the FDA for taking so fricking long to figure out that Tylenol during pregnancy can screw shit up?

14:07.221 --> 14:14.483
Are we going to blame it on the FDA, the only, the only organization in the administrative or executive branch that is supposed to do it?

14:14.543 --> 14:16.603
I don't know what's going on here, but it's ugly.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.882
If there's a problem, you're going to end up doing it.

14:20.943 --> 14:31.411
The other thing that I can tell you that I'll say that they will maybe say at a little bit later date, but I think when you go for the shot, you do it over a five-time period.

14:32.071 --> 14:40.458
Take it over five times or four times, but you take it in smaller doses and you spread it out over a period of years.

14:42.159 --> 14:47.023
And they pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace.

14:48.266 --> 14:48.867
I don't see it.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.348
I think it's very bad.

14:51.969 --> 14:54.951
They're pumping, it looks like they're pumping into a horse.

14:55.691 --> 15:06.139
You have a little child, a little fragile child, and you get a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess, 80 different blends, and they pump it in.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.623
So, ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol.

15:12.578 --> 15:23.723
And on the vaccines, it would be good, instead of one visit where they pump the baby, load it up with stuff, you'll do it over a period of four times or five times.

15:23.783 --> 15:30.186
I was — I mean, I've been so into this issue for so many years just because I couldn't understand how a thing like this could happen.

15:30.226 --> 15:31.767
And you know it's artificially induced.

15:31.827 --> 15:40.131
It's not like something that — when you go from all of those, you know, healthy babies to a point where

15:41.112 --> 15:44.095
I don't even know structurally if a country can afford it.

15:44.815 --> 15:48.558
And that's the least of the problems, to have families destroyed over this.

15:48.658 --> 15:50.240
It's just so, so terrible.

15:50.920 --> 15:57.586
I also, and we've already done this, we want no mercury in the vaccine.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.908
We want no aluminum in the vaccine.

16:00.825 --> 16:03.345
The MMR, I think, should be taken separately.

16:03.385 --> 16:14.207
This is based on what I feel, the mumps, measles, and the three should be taken separately.

16:14.247 --> 16:24.769
Remember that separating the measles, mumps, and rubella into three shots was exactly what Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield were arguing about for autism awareness back in the year 2000 in the UK.

16:29.511 --> 16:51.668
This is a national security hamster wheel that was started in the UK and then recycled in America and this fake health freedom movement and all these actors that are behind it are just charlatans and if he's too dumb to know that's possible but I think in general what you have here is a guy who is a scripted actor

16:52.228 --> 17:00.313
He does, is allowed to improvise within the script, but this guy is not sophisticated enough to understand the biology behind these lies.

17:00.853 --> 17:17.403
He is only sophisticated enough to know how the country is actually ruled, including knowing that he is lifelong family friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton, not their, you know, arch nemesis, which is of course would be absurd.

17:18.643 --> 17:36.169
person that a lot of what has been put out is And It seems to be that when you mix them there could be a problem So there's no downside in taking them separately.

17:36.769 --> 17:38.209
In fact, they think it's better.

17:38.369 --> 17:46.652
So let it be separate the chicken pox is already separate because when that got mixed in I guess they made it for for a while it really was bad and

17:47.402 --> 17:48.688
So they make chickenpox.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.095
Individually, they're...

17:51.025 --> 17:53.786
Okay, when you mix them, something maybe happens.

17:54.346 --> 17:57.366
So there's no downside in doing it.

17:57.626 --> 17:59.587
It's not like, oh, if you do it, bad things.

17:59.647 --> 17:59.827
No.

17:59.907 --> 18:08.689
Now we're going to say Paul Thomas was right that, you know, a delayed schedule or spread out schedule is the only thing we need to do.

18:09.249 --> 18:14.850
And so we are actually on the dumb script of CHD right here.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.511
And so we need to take these people to court.

18:18.351 --> 18:24.874
as frauds, as scripted frauds that are endangering our country and engaged in treason.

18:25.174 --> 18:31.097
That's what we need to do because they're on somebody's script and this script is absolute shit.

18:31.857 --> 18:33.458
They are treasonous.

18:35.278 --> 18:39.020
Anybody that's stuck on this script is treasonous.

18:40.081 --> 18:43.022
Traitors, ladies and gentlemen, traitors.

18:43.849 --> 18:44.650
only good side.

18:44.970 --> 18:48.252
And it may not have that much of an impact, but it may have a big impact.

18:48.992 --> 18:51.174
So let those be taken separately.

18:51.254 --> 18:55.976
And then hepatitis B is sexually transmitted.

18:57.938 --> 19:11.446
There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born hepatitis B. So I would say wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take hepatitis B.

19:12.409 --> 19:19.740
And I think if you do those things, it's going to be a whole different, it's going to be a revolution in a positive sense in the country.

19:20.988 --> 19:30.317
The FDA will be updating the label of an existing drug to reflect potential benefits in reducing some autism symptoms.

19:30.357 --> 19:36.002
This gives hope to the many parents with autistic children that it may be possible to improve their lives.

19:36.023 --> 19:39.186
That's one of the things that I'm very, very happy about.

19:39.526 --> 19:44.891
This was mostly going to be on how not to have the child affected.

19:45.626 --> 20:00.592
But we've learned some pretty good things about... Keep in mind that Polly Tommy was on a newspaper, like a picture in the newspaper because her little boy was cured by secretin injections according to Andrew Wakefield's recommendation.

20:00.812 --> 20:02.632
And that was already 10 years ago.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.053
So what's going on here?

20:05.493 --> 20:11.136
Because we're not going to say secretin here, but already 10 or 15 years ago, Polly Tommy said secretin.

20:11.616 --> 20:12.216
Hi, big dog.

20:12.336 --> 20:12.696
How are you?

20:12.996 --> 20:13.336
What's up?

20:14.137 --> 20:14.797
What's up, big dog?

20:15.652 --> 20:16.553
What's up, big dog?

20:17.053 --> 20:17.814
How you doing, big dog?

20:19.256 --> 20:20.016
What's up, big baby?

20:21.117 --> 20:21.858
What's up, big baby?

20:23.740 --> 20:24.601
You're such a big baby.

20:27.383 --> 20:34.430
Certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby, and the baby can get better.

20:35.591 --> 20:37.874
And in some cases, maybe substantially better.

20:40.708 --> 20:47.313
Not gonna be easy, but it sure sounded like he said some elements of genius can be given to a baby But maybe he meant genes.

20:47.573 --> 20:47.993
I don't know.

20:48.234 --> 20:49.074
I really don't know.

20:49.214 --> 21:06.367
It's kind of sketch Get better is that can be given things about certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby and the baby can get better and in some cases maybe substantially better and

21:07.814 --> 21:17.340
Uh, not gonna be easy, but, uh, be a lot easier if it didn't happen in the first place, as these great parents fully understand, right?

21:17.800 --> 21:18.881
They fully understand.

21:18.921 --> 21:25.725
I feel so terribly for... I have so many friends with autistic children, it's just... it's a tough situation.

21:25.866 --> 21:28.727
I have so many friends!

21:28.867 --> 21:32.310
I have so many friends with autistic kids.

21:32.610 --> 21:34.431
I have so many black friends.

21:34.531 --> 21:35.752
How could I be racist?

21:36.584 --> 21:44.126
Vending the autism fever, the NIH will be announcing 13 major grant awards from the autism data science initiatives.

21:45.006 --> 21:47.386
And to be honest with you, to me, that's the least important.

21:47.426 --> 21:48.907
It's not even a money thing at this point.

21:48.927 --> 21:49.807
There's so much money.

21:51.027 --> 21:53.548
But they have to do, and they have to move quickly.

21:54.608 --> 21:59.089
When the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let's do it now.

21:59.149 --> 22:01.549
I was just saying to Bobby and the group, let's do it now.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.790
Nothing bad can happen.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.050
It can only good happen.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.631
But with Tylenol, don't take it.

22:08.251 --> 22:08.952
Don't take it.

22:10.352 --> 22:16.696
And if you can't live, if your fever is so bad, you have to take one because there's no alternative to that.

22:17.176 --> 22:19.998
Sadly, first question, what can you take instead?

22:20.538 --> 22:22.879
It's actually, there's not an alternative to that.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.761
And as you know, other of the medicines are.

22:25.781 --> 22:31.044
There is no alternative to Tylenol to reduce fever.

22:44.085 --> 22:45.025
Holy shit.

22:45.686 --> 22:46.886
Absolutely proven bad.

22:46.926 --> 22:51.508
I mean, they've been proven bad with the aspirins and the Advils and others, right?

22:52.029 --> 22:53.109
And they've been proven bad.

22:53.649 --> 22:56.050
So I'd like to ask Bobby to get up to the podium.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.951
So wait, aspirin is bad now?

22:58.191 --> 22:59.852
Advil has been proven bad?

22:59.912 --> 23:02.033
But now Tylenol's added.

23:02.053 --> 23:03.294
There's no alternatives.

23:03.394 --> 23:05.755
Wow, this is just so stupid.

23:05.855 --> 23:06.995
It's so stupid.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.016
And it's by design.

23:09.036 --> 23:12.578
I'm gonna say a few words and then Dr. Botticeria and

23:13.547 --> 23:25.592
Dr. McCary, Dr. Oz, Dr. Fink, followed by two incredible mothers that have experienced firsthand what this country is going through, what parts of the world are going through.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.253
And I will say there are parts of the world that don't take Tylenol.

23:29.033 --> 23:35.116
I mean, there's a rumor, and I don't know if it's so or not, that Cuba, they don't have Tylenol because they don't have the money for Tylenol.

23:36.377 --> 23:39.219
And they have virtually no autism, okay?

23:39.259 --> 23:40.219
Tell me about that one.

23:41.220 --> 23:46.303
And there are other parts of the world where they don't have Tylenol, where they don't have autism.

23:47.303 --> 23:48.104
That tells you a lot.

23:49.164 --> 23:50.525
And I want to say it right now.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.346
And you know the way I look at it?

23:52.906 --> 23:53.426
Don't take it.

23:54.107 --> 23:54.627
Don't take it.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.789
There's no downside in not taking it.

23:59.056 --> 24:02.039
So I'd like to ask Bobby to come up and say a few words.

24:02.079 --> 24:05.122
I hope I didn't ruin his day, but that's the way I feel.

24:05.142 --> 24:07.504
I've been very strong on this subject for a long time.

24:07.524 --> 24:09.186
You know, life is common sense, too.

24:10.147 --> 24:14.531
And there's a lot of common sense in this, and I wish things like this were brought up.

24:14.651 --> 24:16.653
And this group has worked so hard on it.

24:17.307 --> 24:24.952
But I'd like to be a little bit more, a little speedier in the process of a recommendation, because there's no harm in going quicker.

24:25.313 --> 24:26.553
There's absolutely no harm.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.014
At worst, there's no harm.

24:28.255 --> 24:28.895
Thank you very much.

24:28.935 --> 24:29.495
Bobby, please.

24:29.776 --> 24:30.836
Thank you, Mr. President.

24:34.599 --> 24:43.025
To meet the President's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch an unprecedented all-agency effort to identify all cause of autism.

24:44.329 --> 24:47.012
including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures.

24:48.113 --> 25:03.107
At present, Trump's urging NIH, FDA, CDC, and CMS are turning over every stone to identify the ideology of the autism epidemic and how patients and parents can prevent and reverse this alarming trend.

25:04.406 --> 25:11.530
We have broken down the traditional silos that have long separated these agencies, and we have fast-tracked research and guidance.

25:12.530 --> 25:21.795
Historically, NIH has focused almost solely on politically safe and entirely fruitless research about the genetic drivers of autism.

25:23.056 --> 25:28.661
And that would be like studying the genetic drivers of lung cancer without looking at cigarettes.

25:28.921 --> 25:31.263
And that's what NIH has been doing for 20 years.

25:32.424 --> 25:40.550
As a result, we don't have an answer to this critical question, despite the cataclysmic impact of the epidemic on our nation's children.

25:41.711 --> 25:49.735
We are now replacing the institutional culture of politicized science and corruption with evidence-based medicine.

25:49.755 --> 25:56.399
NIH research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses with no area off limits.

25:57.259 --> 26:01.722
We promise transparency as we uncover the potential causes and treatments

26:02.882 --> 26:06.045
and we will notify the public regularly of our progress.

26:06.805 --> 26:13.871
Today we are announcing two important findings from our autism work that are vital for parents to know as they make these decisions.

26:14.811 --> 26:17.333
First, HHS will act on acetaminophen.

26:18.274 --> 26:35.185
The FDA is responding to clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including later diagnosis for ADHD.

26:35.625 --> 26:36.746
So it's funny, right?

26:36.786 --> 26:39.028
Because Brian Hooker says that his

26:39.628 --> 26:45.915
His son was transformed after having five vaccines on the same day when he had an ear infection.

26:46.296 --> 26:53.264
Pauly Tommy tells a story of acute changing in their in their kids behavior and in their function of their bowel.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.387
This is really not that at all.

26:57.407 --> 27:03.492
He's talking about autism because you're taking Tylenol during pregnancy.

27:03.892 --> 27:12.378
Even Pauly Tommy in the movie Vaxxed actually said that she was told to give the kid Tylenol after her vaccines, and that might've played a role.

27:12.678 --> 27:19.483
Pauly Tommy said that 10 and a half years ago in the movie, or 10 years ago in the movie Vaxxed on April 1st, 2016.

27:25.987 --> 27:28.369
Bobby Kennedy is a scripted fraud.

27:29.610 --> 27:32.152
Bobby Kennedy is a scripted fraud.

27:32.312 --> 27:37.335
Donald Trump is a scripted fraud and lifelong family friend of the Clintons.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.438
Dr. Oz is frickin' Dr. Oz.

27:43.940 --> 27:46.102
He might as well be Dr. frickin' Phil.

27:47.942 --> 27:48.362
Autism.

27:49.442 --> 27:56.484
Scientists have proposed biological mechanisms linking prenatal acetaminophen exposure to altered brain development.

27:57.285 --> 28:01.686
We have also evaluated the contrary studies that show no association.

28:01.706 --> 28:12.569
Today, the FDA will issue a physician's notice about the risk of acetaminophen during pregnancy and begin the process to initiate a safety label change.

28:14.037 --> 28:19.399
HHS will launch a nationwide public service campaign to inform families and protect public health.

28:20.360 --> 28:31.704
FDA also recognized that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well-documented adverse effects.

28:32.785 --> 28:37.747
HHS wants, therefore, to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment

28:38.867 --> 28:50.978
and the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration and only when treatment is required.

28:51.979 --> 29:04.350
Furthermore, thanks also to the politicization of science, the safety of acetaminophen against the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in young children has never been validated.

29:05.211 --> 29:17.874
Prudent medicine, therefore, suggests caution in acetaminophen use by young children, especially since strong evidence also has associated it with liver toxicity.

29:18.655 --> 29:21.515
Some studies have also found the use of acetaminophen in children.

29:21.555 --> 29:25.116
So let's think about the biology of this bullshit for a second.

29:25.156 --> 29:28.617
How is Tylenol acting on the developing brain of the fetus?

29:30.318 --> 29:31.718
Crossing the blood-brain barrier?

29:32.238 --> 29:34.099
Crossing the placental barrier?

29:35.143 --> 29:38.426
Not processed by the mom's liver before it gets there?

29:39.086 --> 29:40.307
Do you see the problem here?

29:43.910 --> 29:44.490
Do you see it?

29:46.612 --> 29:56.199
The lack of specificity, the lack of fidelity in their answer, the lack of, you know, details in the answer that just kind of glossing over.

29:56.539 --> 29:58.901
It looks like Tylenol is correlated with something.

29:59.738 --> 30:08.560
You could probably correlate it also with the car they're driving, or the fast food they ate, or what team they cheer for with the kind of science that they're probably doing.

30:10.780 --> 30:24.903
Ladies and gentlemen, America is being undermined by a two-party theater that is just a national security theater with one cast, one script, and one destination for this giant cruise ship, and that is hell.

30:25.734 --> 30:31.278
where your kids are experimental animals for the Human Genome Project.

30:31.719 --> 30:34.881
That's why these guys are all about AI and medicine.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.362
They're all about data sharing.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.803
They're all about data farms.

30:37.823 --> 30:39.304
They're all about Larry Ellison.

30:39.324 --> 30:40.685
They're all about Peter Thiel.

30:41.066 --> 30:42.947
They're all about the Human Genome Project.

30:42.987 --> 30:48.932
That's why the Research and Development Director, College Dropout,

30:50.490 --> 30:59.473
apprentice to Mark Lander and Francis Collins, Mr. Kevin McKernan is behind this guy.

30:59.753 --> 31:17.359
That's why Dr. Robert Malone is behind this guy, and Dr. Merrill Nass, and the Mary Holland Esquire, and Tony Lyons of Sky Horse Publishing that Steve Bannon calls brilliant every time he introduces him on his war room show.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.542
This is one malevolent show, ladies and gentlemen.

31:21.582 --> 31:37.671
It might be easier for you to cognitively think of the Trump administration as a stooge Republican administration that's actually just a bunch of Democrats that know that they are driving this car into the tree

31:38.591 --> 31:43.132
For the Democratic Party on purpose, but it's not a Democrat Party.

31:43.172 --> 31:46.533
It's not a Republican Party It is a globalist party.

31:46.594 --> 31:48.314
It is a party of the billionaires.

31:48.374 --> 32:07.940
It is a party of weaponized piles of money And This man is a fraud that man is a fraud This man is a fraud that guy over there is a fraud and wherever the hell Jay Bhattacharya is my taco Eating friend is also a fraud

32:11.717 --> 32:14.638
can potentially prolong viral illnesses.

32:15.798 --> 32:20.159
FDA will drive new research to safeguard mothers, children, and families.

32:21.079 --> 32:36.703
In addition to a possible cytomedicine connection to autism for pregnant women, infants and toddlers are... Turkish military... Research has revealed that folate deficiency in a child's brain can lead to autism.

32:37.643 --> 32:43.929
We have also identified an exciting therapy that may benefit large numbers of children who suffer from autism.

32:44.769 --> 32:54.838
Peer-reviewed literature has documented that up to 60% of folate-deficient children with ASD can have improved verbal communications if given Lucavorin.

32:55.799 --> 32:58.801
I have instructed NIH, FDA, and CMS

32:59.733 --> 33:02.134
help doctors treat children appropriately.

33:02.234 --> 33:12.239
Jay will help tell that story, which started with sound science, the kind that restores faith in government.

33:12.279 --> 33:19.362
This announcement also represents a historic collaboration between NIH, FDA, CDC, and CMS.

33:20.262 --> 33:24.124
We expect this to be the first of many announcements over the coming years.

33:25.004 --> 33:32.490
and deliver actionable information to parents on underlying causes of autism and the potential paths for prevention and reversal.

33:33.651 --> 33:39.215
Finally, autism is a complex disorder with multifactorial ideology.

33:39.995 --> 33:46.560
We are continuing to investigate a multiplicity of potential causes with no areas of taboo.

33:47.141 --> 33:49.403
One area that we are closely examining

33:50.343 --> 33:52.364
as the president mentioned, is vaccines.

33:53.244 --> 34:01.488
Some 40 to 70% of mothers who have children with autism believe that their child was injured by a vaccine.

34:01.508 --> 34:12.293
President Trump believes that we should be listening to these mothers instead of gaslighting and marginalizing them like prior administrations.

34:13.213 --> 34:16.575
Some of our friends like to say we should believe all women.

34:17.675 --> 34:23.144
Some of these same people have been silencing and demonizing these mothers for three decades.

34:24.144 --> 34:36.330
Because research on the potential link between autism and vaccines has been actively suppressed in the past, it will take time for an honest look at this topic by scientists.

34:37.091 --> 34:44.875
But I want to reassure the people in the autism community that we will be uncompromising and relentless in our search for answers.

34:45.876 --> 34:49.217
We will perform the studies that should have been performed 25 years ago.

34:50.818 --> 34:53.480
Whatever the answer is, we will tell you what we find.

34:54.221 --> 34:57.123
We are researching this issue to all three agencies.

34:57.184 --> 35:00.686
Jay will discuss one of our research initiatives at NIH.

35:01.587 --> 35:14.738
This model of unleashing... That is part of your plan... No prior administration had, so I'm just here to express my gratitude and I am looking... 20 years...

35:17.427 --> 35:19.369
FDA also recognizes the spectrum.

35:19.589 --> 35:28.056
It seems certain that there will be a wide range of biological contributors to similar results from any other chronic conditions that plague Americans.

35:32.359 --> 35:33.220
Thank you, Secretary Kennedy.

35:34.261 --> 35:34.981
Thank you, President Trump.

35:35.241 --> 35:45.009
It is with the utmost sincerity and with as much emphasis as I can put on it as a man

35:46.358 --> 35:48.599
Jay Bhattacharya is a complete fraud.

35:49.659 --> 36:02.882
Three times I was flown out to California to go to a broken science initiative meeting, and three times I met this guy and talked to him about the pandemic and what I was teaching, and three times he told me how great I was.

36:03.442 --> 36:05.003
But the third time when I met him,

36:05.831 --> 36:13.055
was right before the election and he told me to keep my mouth shut about Robert Malone because he was about to be appointed NIH director.

36:13.715 --> 36:18.397
And at the time I thought, holy shit that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard and now there he is.

36:19.658 --> 36:20.919
So he actually told me.

36:21.670 --> 36:33.500
before Trump was elected, before Bobby was appointed, before any of that had happened, he told me that he was going to be NIH director, and he asked me not to talk about Robert Malone anymore on my stream in 2024.

36:34.300 --> 36:38.904
That man is a traitor to my American children and yours.

36:39.344 --> 36:43.668
He is a fraudulent man who does not have the requisite expertise to

36:45.567 --> 36:53.893
argue his way out of a wet paper bag using basic biological principles, nevermind running something called the national institutes of health.

36:57.596 --> 37:03.040
I would have a very hard time not punching his lights out if I were to ever see him again in person.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.263
So I don't need any more invitations to broken science.

37:07.343 --> 37:08.344
That's for darn sure.

37:12.024 --> 37:15.085
Thank you very much.

37:15.445 --> 37:32.672
Am I being clear enough about the fact that I am an American who lost a job at a top 10 American university medical school at the start of the pandemic for speaking out about transfection being an old technology and that we would never use it on our healthy old people?

37:33.755 --> 37:42.229
And now six years later, my name is being ruined because it's in that stupid book of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

37:42.369 --> 37:44.874
after I already told him that his book was wrong.

37:46.656 --> 37:52.418
And yet he still listed me as an expert as somebody who would testify, I guess, to whatever shit is in that book.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.419
But if you read the quotes of me carefully, you can see that that's wrong.

37:56.279 --> 38:07.623
So if there's any real journalists out there, any real newspapers out there, any real political magazines, or any real talk shows that want to know the truth about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:08.023 --> 38:11.404
and the inside workings of CHD, Children's Health Defense,

38:11.784 --> 38:17.487
and how fraudulent these people are like Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass.

38:17.648 --> 38:18.348
I'm your man.

38:20.569 --> 38:25.992
Because I'm looking for an attorney to help me sue CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:26.073 --> 38:38.520
for tricking me and using me and now tarnishing my reputation by listing me as an expert in that shit fake book called the Wuhan Cover-Up.

38:40.714 --> 38:44.897
This is our health and human services secretary, ladies and gentlemen, and he is a fraud.

38:45.017 --> 38:48.980
And I am one of the few people that can professionally and personally testify to that.

38:49.481 --> 38:52.543
And I would be happy to do it in any court of law on earth.

38:54.505 --> 38:57.707
And by the way, Jay Bhattacharya is equally fraudulent.

38:58.068 --> 39:03.592
I don't think that he could have an in-depth discussion about anything biological.

39:05.805 --> 39:14.033
autism data science initiative to turbocharge autism research, devoting an additional $50 million to the cause of studying autism.

39:14.614 --> 39:23.463
Nearly 250 research teams from across the country applied, sent in their applications, and were peer-reviewed by the NIH review panels.

39:24.623 --> 39:33.707
The NIH peer reviewers chose the 13 best projects focused on root causes and therapies with replication and validation studies to guarantee gold standard science.

39:34.328 --> 39:46.793
The studies feature a new kind of science called exposomics, where scientists consider environmental and medical factors, nutrition, events during pregnancy, in combination with biology and genetics to answer vital questions about autism.

39:47.353 --> 39:50.775
Science like this, conducted in partnership with families and physicians,

39:51.095 --> 39:55.639
There's no reason for me to watch that anymore.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.600
Those guys are frauds.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.342
I might watch it later just to see what they do.

39:58.362 --> 39:59.824
I want to get back to this part of the show.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.445
Thank you for being so patient.

40:03.171 --> 40:10.593
This is an interview that took place before the Charlie Kirk memorial service, about a week and a half ago or so.

40:10.633 --> 40:11.894
You can find it on YouTube.

40:12.374 --> 40:15.094
And so the real question is, who are the scripted actors now?

40:15.755 --> 40:18.776
I've been interacting with Dan Cohen for about two and a half years.

40:18.816 --> 40:23.397
He knows my story backwards and forwards from many, many phone calls, many, many hours on the phone.

40:23.937 --> 40:28.638
It's just that I guess I haven't written it in Substack, and so therefore he can't really report it yet.

40:28.678 --> 40:31.059
It's still just a work in progress.

40:31.139 --> 40:36.700
But in the meantime, he's been adopting a lot of my language, and so that makes me very excited and proud.

40:37.361 --> 40:41.902
And so I just wanted to share that with you, and that's what this show, this second part of the show is all about.

40:41.922 --> 40:46.043
Been this kind of deification or desecration.

40:46.963 --> 40:52.867
and depending upon the side that you're on, using that club to beat the head of the other side.

40:53.587 --> 40:54.328
It is very weird.

40:54.348 --> 40:55.208
It's very strange.

40:56.029 --> 41:03.974
The images that they've come out with, Jesus taking Charlie Kirk away to somewhere, all of this stuff is very strange.

41:04.054 --> 41:04.855
It's very bizarre.

41:06.656 --> 41:08.017
Let's start there, though.

41:08.517 --> 41:09.317
Give me a take on this.

41:09.458 --> 41:16.002
And just to give reference point, it was this tweet that you were responding to from Sarah Bills.

41:18.365 --> 41:20.107
right here.

41:20.147 --> 41:25.392
Sarah says, why was Charlie giving multiple members of the Trump administration his quote, final wishes before he died?

41:25.872 --> 41:27.614
First Miller, now Noam.

41:28.394 --> 41:30.957
And you point out, he says, because they're following the same script.

41:31.517 --> 41:35.901
Once you see that they're national security state actors, then you can't unsee it.

41:36.755 --> 41:41.099
We are governed by highly paid liars via cable TV, social media, and podcasts.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.684
And just to be clear, Sarah wasn't saying that he knew he was going to die.

41:46.044 --> 41:55.054
His point was, how are all of these people all of a sudden bringing this up as if, you know, I was the last person to talk to Charlie and Charlie told me X or Y?

41:55.494 --> 41:56.595
Break down your comment for me.

42:01.258 --> 42:16.432
So my comment that these are national security state actors, I mean, well, Sarah firstly was pointing out that the Homeland Security Secretary, what's her name, the former governor of

42:17.649 --> 42:20.092
of like, well, no, yeah, Christine Noem.

42:20.372 --> 42:20.612
Yeah.

42:20.892 --> 42:22.935
Um, and then, and then who was the other one?

42:23.015 --> 42:24.576
JD van, who was, who was the other person?

42:24.596 --> 42:26.198
She was, it was, let me see.

42:26.838 --> 42:29.441
It was Christine Noem and it was Miller.

42:29.741 --> 42:31.103
Um, Steven Miller, of course.

42:31.423 --> 42:31.623
Yeah.

42:32.104 --> 42:35.968
Um, both said that he, uh, um,

42:37.009 --> 42:42.491
that, sorry, I have to switch my brain from a completely different subject that I was just working on.

42:42.871 --> 42:56.514
Both said that Charlie Kirk had told them in, you know, right before he was killed, that he was, you know, we need to crack down on the terrorist left, things like that.

42:56.534 --> 43:06.097
That's not an exact quote, but which is obvious, you know, fodder for just right wing

43:07.901 --> 43:13.783
You know, everyone, the kind of narrative that the left is crazy and they celebrate killing and we need to crack down on them.

43:13.843 --> 43:19.205
And, you know, and they're not only they celebrate killing, but but, you know, they're killers even.

43:20.046 --> 43:21.006
And that.

43:21.706 --> 43:27.268
So what my point and Sarah said, look, they're saying the same thing, which is very strange.

43:27.308 --> 43:33.470
And she clarified, I'm not saying that Charlie Kirk knew he was going to die, but it's strange that they're both saying that.

43:33.650 --> 43:35.931
And my point is, yes, these are

43:36.747 --> 43:38.792
These people are scripted.

43:39.554 --> 43:43.503
They are saying that for a very specific political reason.

43:44.726 --> 43:45.487
Kristi Noem

43:46.144 --> 43:47.725
was put in that position.

43:47.905 --> 43:55.028
You know, if you look at, she's like a, she's a grandmother, but she got like a nice haircut, got like plastic surgery, got Botox.

43:55.088 --> 43:56.648
Christine Noem is a grandmother?

43:56.668 --> 43:57.789
Are you serious?

43:58.049 --> 43:58.309
Yeah.

43:58.889 --> 44:00.030
And yeah, exactly.

44:00.070 --> 44:02.171
She's, you know, she's an older lady.

44:02.631 --> 44:06.653
I mean, she's into her sixties, I believe.

44:07.153 --> 44:07.893
I had no idea.

44:08.874 --> 44:09.034
Yeah.

44:09.054 --> 44:09.774
I had no idea.

44:10.174 --> 44:12.195
And they made her kind of like, you know,

44:13.649 --> 44:15.550
Hot, quote unquote.

44:15.590 --> 44:31.954
They tried to make her look physically attractive and put her in this position as Homeland Security for this theater where she goes out with ICE agents and cracks down on criminals and does all these appearances on social media in particular.

44:33.175 --> 44:35.215
Stephen Miller is saying the same thing.

44:35.595 --> 44:39.977
So this is clearly a script that went out.

44:41.664 --> 44:46.192
My point is I think actually a fundamental thing that people need to understand.

44:46.212 --> 44:49.678
Yeah, you can see like, you know, that she's 60.

44:50.279 --> 44:53.544
She's I mean, we can look up exactly Christy gnome age.

44:55.537 --> 44:55.757
She's 53.

44:56.578 --> 44:57.459
So she's not she's not 60.

44:58.801 --> 44:59.782
But she is a grandmother.

45:00.623 --> 45:02.345
She still looks good for 53.

45:02.445 --> 45:02.705
Jesus.

45:02.765 --> 45:03.066
Yeah.

45:03.506 --> 45:12.917
But I mean, if you look at pictures of her, like from before, if you look up Kristi Noem, like age, you can find pictures of her from before where she looks much more

45:13.646 --> 45:14.947
plain like home.

45:15.007 --> 45:15.808
She looks her age.

45:16.148 --> 45:17.469
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.730
But you know, and she got plastic surgery.

45:19.830 --> 45:24.514
Clearly, she got like, she clearly does like Botox, you know, lip enhancements, these kind of things.

45:25.594 --> 45:27.296
That's not just because of vanity.

45:27.436 --> 45:39.024
That's because they're trying to market her for, you know, kind of conservative audiences to bring them in to this whole like, MAGA

45:40.546 --> 45:42.447
farm and support Trump.

45:43.007 --> 45:54.932
So, you know, having like a good looking older woman to go and do these appearances on social media where she's out there with the ICE agents, getting the criminals, this kind of thing, that is all propaganda.

45:56.653 --> 46:00.375
And it's a theater is how I describe it, national security state theater.

46:01.095 --> 46:05.357
And really, this is the main thing that I think people

46:06.681 --> 46:12.764
on all sides of the political spectrum have to understand about social media.

46:13.605 --> 46:19.147
We just assume that, you know, like, yeah, they're like social media is pretty normal.

46:19.187 --> 46:23.170
Like we have our X accounts, we have our whatever, Instagram, whatever you use.

46:23.550 --> 46:30.953
I mean, in particular, you know, a lot of people I think who are in journalism, who are in our spheres use X in particular.

46:32.646 --> 46:43.570
But, and we are kind of under this sort of illusion that there is some amount, there's free speech or some amount, or it was censored, but Elon restored it.

46:43.590 --> 46:47.192
And even if we don't really like Elon and his politics, now we have free speech.

46:47.212 --> 46:50.073
Because a lot of the people who were... What is he laughing about?

46:50.113 --> 46:50.933
What does that mean?

46:51.634 --> 46:53.554
When he said illusion, it was really funny?

46:53.595 --> 46:54.575
That's so bizarre.

46:55.035 --> 47:00.257
Banned, you know, we're brought back and, you know, it's a place of free exchange and all these things.

47:00.857 --> 47:02.078
When in reality,

47:03.055 --> 47:27.311
It is, not only is this a corporate platform, it is military-grade social engineering made to, where it is, where there is a lot of inorganic activity and scripted national security state actors that are

47:28.291 --> 47:36.828
difficult to identify and that are put in place to rise at certain points in order to kind of steer

47:39.645 --> 47:42.527
how people think in order to engineer their mind.

47:42.967 --> 47:48.630
Because the most important thing is this, you know, little, our consciousness, that's what they're really fighting for.

47:48.990 --> 47:52.332
How we think, how we perceive reality, and then that, you know.

47:52.352 --> 48:02.858
Your consciousness is their prime real estate is an interesting thing I've had on my slides since like 2020 or so, like, and Jamaril is falling asleep.

48:03.817 --> 48:14.523
determines what we do with our day-to-day on a day-to-day basis.

48:15.844 --> 48:29.132
So the thing is, the more we get good, quote-unquote, at social media, the more we build a big following and we feel like we're interacting with

48:31.923 --> 48:43.351
important people, maybe some journalist who you used to really look up to, and all of a sudden they're favoriting and retweeting your posts, and maybe you're DMing with them.

48:43.991 --> 48:47.213
A lot of that is so incredibly easy to manipulate.

48:48.034 --> 48:50.215
For example, I'll give an example.

48:51.196 --> 48:52.357
The account Syrian Girl,

48:53.358 --> 48:56.120
Maram Sousley, she's Australian-Syrian.

48:57.801 --> 49:11.153
She said, well, Charlie Kirk followed me recently on X. And that is proof that he was changing his position on Israel.

49:12.111 --> 49:17.913
Now, Charlie, and that went viral, that got like several thousand retweets and many more likes.

49:19.194 --> 49:28.558
Charlie Kirk follows like, I think it was like one hundred eighty five thousand people on Twitter.

49:29.098 --> 49:31.199
I just follow is like literally anything.

49:32.639 --> 49:33.780
So, number one,

49:34.838 --> 49:38.261
If that is somehow meaningful, I just don't see it.

49:38.281 --> 49:40.904
I think that's, at best, I would say wishful thinking.

49:41.424 --> 49:42.906
Yeah, that's her point of view.

49:42.926 --> 49:43.847
It's like her little window.

49:44.928 --> 49:56.339
And secondly, especially, you know, bigger figures like Charlie Kirk, they're not spending all day like a lot of social media users who are really good at X.

49:56.837 --> 49:59.498
They're not spending all their time on social media.

49:59.558 --> 50:00.918
He's like a political actor.

50:00.998 --> 50:05.519
He's flying here and running Turning Points USA or this kind of thing.

50:06.800 --> 50:09.100
So there are people that manage those accounts.

50:09.780 --> 50:24.444
So there's no indication that Charlie Kirk himself, it was Charlie Kirk's account, could be run by literally anybody, could be run by his assistant, his hired social media intern,

50:26.129 --> 50:31.893
Or the US military, or a paramilitary organization, or a private contractor working for DITRA.

50:32.734 --> 50:34.855
Like, get there, get there, Dan.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.116
Uh-oh, raining.

50:36.796 --> 50:40.739
It could be run by somebody directly working in the national security state.

50:40.799 --> 50:41.299
There you go.

50:41.339 --> 50:44.801
And this is the kind of thing where it's like, oh, Charlie Kirk's calling me.

50:45.182 --> 50:47.363
He must be having some kind of change.

50:47.583 --> 50:54.968
Oh, he's, you know, so this is the point that I'm trying to make, is that all of these platforms

50:55.643 --> 51:00.447
not only at TikTok, Facebook, you know, they're for different generations now.

51:00.527 --> 51:02.869
It's like boomers who use Facebook.

51:03.329 --> 51:21.603
It's like a lot of kids who use TikTok and, you know, like, I don't know, Instagram and and YouTube and Rumble is now the like alternative platform, you know, but Rumble is like another one that this is, you know, you can have they can make certain podcasts

51:22.165 --> 51:31.235
or shows rise to be, you know, all of a sudden you're getting 10, you know, you're the one that's out front to get tens of thousands of viewers or whatever live.

51:31.315 --> 51:36.782
So all of this is basically an invented reality in many ways.

51:36.862 --> 51:38.243
And it's very difficult.

51:38.323 --> 51:41.347
It's like WWE or WWF where like,

51:42.441 --> 51:45.984
you know, it's how do we know what's fake and what's real?

51:46.264 --> 51:51.008
Like it's scripted, but there are things that are happening that are real, but, but we don't know.

51:51.449 --> 52:08.743
And the overwhelming majority of social media users do not understand the level to which it is, it is scripted and these political actors and political of the single uniparty that rules this country.

52:09.484 --> 52:09.564
Um,

52:10.419 --> 52:13.141
are these people are following scripts.

52:13.561 --> 52:21.465
The national security state is thinking generations ahead in its plans of what it wants to do.

52:22.266 --> 52:27.529
You and I are reacting to the news on a daily basis of what's happening.

52:27.589 --> 52:31.851
We are not understanding there is a major long-term agenda

52:33.582 --> 52:36.303
And big question, of course, what are those agendas?

52:36.483 --> 52:38.424
And that's a huge question.

52:38.504 --> 52:42.025
But my point is social media is their terrain.

52:42.145 --> 52:43.145
It is their theater.

52:43.365 --> 52:44.426
It is their matrix.

52:44.746 --> 52:45.786
It is not ours.

52:45.906 --> 52:51.748
And it is not a public square that they just kind of bought and are making money off of.

52:52.209 --> 52:55.130
It is their form of controlling our minds.

52:56.430 --> 52:56.650
Yeah.

52:57.330 --> 52:58.591
I used to be a software engineer.

52:59.151 --> 53:00.791
I was a software engineer for like 10 years.

53:02.719 --> 53:09.524
Any platform that there's a layer of code between you and that platform, I can control.

53:10.665 --> 53:23.955
And I say that to say, whether you have sock puppet accounts, whether you have certain algorithms that push certain things over other things, those things are manipulated or can be manipulated in a way that serves certain agendas.

53:24.636 --> 53:33.361
Now I made this point earlier, I want to make it again because this video is kind of where, this is where we picked up or left off in the morning show or the early afternoon show.

53:35.942 --> 53:49.050
He's missing the biggest point, which is again, more like the Milgram experiment or the Ash experiment where you have, I don't know which one's which anymore, but the one where people lie coordinatedly.

53:49.861 --> 53:56.401
You know, you have a whole room full of people that agree to lie about something, and then you have one person that doesn't know that they're all in on it.

53:57.549 --> 54:04.194
They're not going to be able to argue with that group of people about which line is longer when 25 people in the room say, no, it's number three.

54:04.634 --> 54:07.276
And you're alone in that room saying, nah, I think it's number two.

54:07.316 --> 54:08.597
It's obviously number two.

54:09.237 --> 54:11.099
You're going to have a lot of trouble with that.

54:11.179 --> 54:22.547
That is an illusion that can create it in a military fashion on social media with a combination of sock puppets and actual people scripted to say stupid shit.

54:24.192 --> 54:25.213
And that's where we are.

54:25.453 --> 54:32.559
The pandemic was largely, if not exclusively created by people on social media saying stupid shit.

54:32.979 --> 54:38.263
And then people like me going along with it and then being amplified as long as we were going along with it.

54:39.945 --> 54:41.306
We were all set up.

54:42.547 --> 54:51.074
It doesn't matter if you saw through one side or the other side, you participated in it because you think you saw through it when actually you didn't.

54:52.557 --> 54:54.979
You just saw one show or the other show.

54:58.301 --> 54:58.902
So yeah, you're right.

54:58.982 --> 55:02.264
It's not reality in the reality sense of the word.

55:02.865 --> 55:04.206
There's always a space.

55:04.386 --> 55:16.435
There's a rift between you trying to hit at real reality versus the code base that's there to give you, let's say, a view, a take on what that reality is.

55:16.495 --> 55:17.376
No, I totally agree with you.

55:17.416 --> 55:19.857
I mean, I give you, especially political actors,

55:20.698 --> 55:21.842
they tend to be on script.

55:22.544 --> 55:28.081
So for example you had all of the drones that go into Ukraine and then all of a sudden you see

55:30.326 --> 55:35.790
80 on my site, maybe like 30 internet sites coming up saying, Donald Trump is weak.

55:36.450 --> 55:38.411
Donald Trump allows NATO to be attacked.

55:38.812 --> 55:45.556
And they're saying almost the exact same thing with maybe a different tone, a different letter, a different word here or there.

55:45.576 --> 55:46.637
They don't script.

55:46.877 --> 55:58.925
They have a very specific agenda of what they want to accomplish in referencing that particular event, creating hysteria around that particular event, trying to get a following on that particular event to get it to bubble up on the side of the thing.

55:59.775 --> 56:05.877
Those people, they know that this wasn't an attack on NATO.

56:06.497 --> 56:10.178
That doesn't stop them from pushing it out there in order to try to pull Donald Trump in a particular direction.

56:10.719 --> 56:11.899
It's scripted, agreed.

56:12.819 --> 56:14.720
And it's not just that, it can be all sorts of things.

56:14.780 --> 56:27.104
I mean, Cuban Twitter, if you remember, where I think the CIA created this kind of Twitter-like thing that they controlled, that they wanted to use to try to overthrow this Cuban state.

56:28.084 --> 56:30.345
it only got like 30, 40,000 people on it.

56:30.465 --> 56:35.728
But even that, it's like 30, 40,000 people on a device created by the CIA to overthrow Cuba.

56:36.868 --> 56:38.529
I agree with you.

56:38.669 --> 56:39.590
No, I totally agree with you.

56:39.750 --> 56:41.431
I don't think people look at it in those terms, though.

56:41.791 --> 56:43.192
Let me add, let me add something.

56:43.552 --> 56:44.252
I mean, yeah.

56:44.432 --> 56:49.495
So like people understand, you know, a lot of anti-imperialists know about that episode in particular.

56:49.555 --> 56:52.496
Well, yeah, that episode in particular, where they had that

56:54.678 --> 57:02.186
Just to reiterate, Robert Malone was involved in the Arab Spring operation, which was largely based on Twitter or some other WhatsApp thing.

57:03.407 --> 57:15.479
And now he is one of these advisors behind RFK and CHD and the fraudulent anti-vax fake health freedom movement that's part of this fraudulent Trump administration.

57:15.519 --> 57:17.181
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been set up.

57:18.647 --> 57:21.449
And it's vital that everybody starts saying it out loud.

57:21.489 --> 57:25.712
If we're not going to just say it out loud, that the Trump administration is just a joke.

57:26.873 --> 57:27.714
And it's a setup.

57:28.454 --> 57:31.096
They're on the same team as Obama and the Clintons.

57:32.137 --> 57:33.318
We're never going to get out of this.

57:33.638 --> 57:36.080
And our kids are never going to be able to see it for what it is.

57:36.980 --> 57:44.346
Yeah, Twitter kind of thing that they operated, I think it was like ZunZuneo or something like that in Cuba to overthrow the government.

57:44.506 --> 57:47.508
Social media was clearly a weapon for regime change.

57:48.101 --> 57:58.245
So if it is a weapon for regime change and social engineering against Cuban sovereignty, well, what does that mean that we are using it every day?

57:58.345 --> 58:05.048
How are we being engineered in a far more sophisticated way than it was like a decade or so ago?

58:05.568 --> 58:08.410
Another thing I might point out about that is.

58:10.090 --> 58:16.353
The idea that, OK, so like we all see that there are coordinated groups of liars,

58:17.234 --> 58:22.556
You know October 7th perfect example the 40 beheaded babies hopes these kinds of things.

58:22.596 --> 58:46.623
We're like everyone who is Paying attention or is critical basically Saw that as an basically obvious hopes and saw that it was coordinated that was very clearly I mean it was we know that that came from Netanyahu's office and was handed out, you know, okay, that was very obvious So we know these things happen

58:47.385 --> 58:49.726
And those are, those are the most obvious ones.

58:50.067 --> 59:02.513
What I would suggest, the example that you gave about like, um, these, you know, drones in the, in the Poland in order to convince Donald Trump to be more aggressive towards Russia or whatever.

59:03.454 --> 59:08.476
I think that Donald, the idea that Donald Trump is, um,

59:10.305 --> 59:21.795
Anti has these anti-interventionist instincts very and is pushed by Hawks Very well could be and probably is part of the script.

59:22.296 --> 59:33.906
Yes That's most security state script because it's a point because you know, Donald Trump speaks from both sides of his mouth all the time he says, you know, we don't we don't seek regime change in Iran and

59:34.987 --> 59:35.887
You know, we don't want war.

59:35.907 --> 59:37.408
We're going to negotiate with them.

59:37.729 --> 59:49.077
And then he uses those negotiations to give Israel the element of surprise for Israel to launch this war, which then Trump, of course, supports in every way, and then actually even joined in.

59:49.665 --> 59:51.006
The same thing with Hamas.

59:51.226 --> 59:51.646
The U.S.

59:51.706 --> 59:54.748
was, you know, oh, we got really tired of Joe Biden.

59:54.788 --> 59:56.249
You know, everyone's, oh, Trump is here.

59:56.269 --> 59:58.431
We got the temporary ceasefire.

59:58.871 --> 01:00:01.313
And then negotiations with Hamas.

01:00:01.373 --> 01:00:02.534
And this is great.

01:00:02.614 --> 01:00:04.635
And wow, finally, some sense here.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.576
And then the element of surprise.

01:00:06.656 --> 01:00:07.417
Boom, you know.

01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:11.269
So that to me is all, that's coordinated.

01:00:11.429 --> 01:00:12.651
That's not an accident.

01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:13.672
That's not a lie.

01:00:14.252 --> 01:00:14.753
Exactly.

01:00:15.113 --> 01:00:15.654
Precisely.

01:00:15.914 --> 01:00:16.475
Precisely.

01:00:16.595 --> 01:00:16.855
Yes.

01:00:17.355 --> 01:00:18.477
They got those guys together.

01:00:18.497 --> 01:00:19.438
Boom.

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:19.718
Hit them.

01:00:19.738 --> 01:00:26.044
You know, so these are the same, these are scripts, national security state scripts.

01:00:26.124 --> 01:00:28.727
This is not happening again and again by accident.

01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:30.389
And if it were one time,

01:00:31.072 --> 01:00:41.200
you know, that Trump got played or got rolled, then I'd say, Oh, okay, you know, that might carry some water, this idea that, you know, he's being pressured like that.

01:00:41.881 --> 01:00:47.025
But the reality, I think, you know, fool me once, shame on you, right?

01:00:47.085 --> 01:00:57.434
Fool me like 30 times, like, then at some point, you know, I'm just a goldfish, like, going into the, you know, the side of the bowl again, and again, like think, think, think,

01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:00.562
And that's basically, I think, where we're at.

01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:12.744
And people who and I'm not, you know, accusing you of this, obviously, but like, even myself for a long time, I really thought that, yeah, like Trump really does have these anti interventionist instincts, like he's a good he sells it really well.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:19.346
And I think this is broadly accepted in anti imperialist thinking.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:25.070
I gave him the benefit of the doubt when he first got in office and was like, all right, let's see what he does.

01:01:25.771 --> 01:01:27.211
But then you're bombing Yemen.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.712
You're trying to attack Venezuela.

01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:30.832
You just murdered 11 people in a Venezuelan boat.

01:01:30.932 --> 01:01:33.073
We just found out about the North Koreans that you murdered.

01:01:33.533 --> 01:01:35.874
I mean, you can go down the list on these things.

01:01:35.954 --> 01:01:38.435
This is not a person who's anti-interventionists.

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:41.796
He may be trying to do it on the cheap, but anti-interventionists, no.

01:01:42.205 --> 01:01:55.594
And he sells it quite well, you know, I mean, it's like, you know, but Biden said, you know, ... But we're back to talking about Donald Trump as an independent actor that's not really under our control.

01:01:56.475 --> 01:02:03.040
We're back to talking about these things as being independent forces or independent actors that aren't under our control.

01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:12.334
So we're not quite saying that Donald Trump is a scripted national security actor yet, which we need to say, because he is.

01:02:22.432 --> 01:02:28.133
Biden in AOC, Genocide Joe, and the future of the Democratic Party in AOC don't care.

01:02:28.213 --> 01:02:30.914
These people are scripted national security state actors.

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:32.614
With Biden, it was too obvious.

01:02:32.934 --> 01:02:34.674
With Kamala, it was too obvious.

01:02:34.934 --> 01:02:38.195
That's why she lost, because she couldn't sell the story to the public.

01:02:38.575 --> 01:02:40.035
Trump is a great actor.

01:02:40.055 --> 01:02:41.296
He was in Home Alone.

01:02:41.516 --> 01:02:42.836
He did pro wrestling appearances.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:03:11.598
This guy is really an actor, and if you look at who created the image of Donald Trump as a sort of conservative, populist, billionaire who really is gonna take the establishment and stick it to them, it was Steve Bannon.

01:03:12.218 --> 01:03:15.761
Steve Bannon, the former Goldman Sachs banker,

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.171
who crafted Donald Trump's strategy.

01:03:20.371 --> 01:03:27.714
He was his media strategist, and he basically engineered his campaign to get him into the White House.

01:03:28.354 --> 01:03:32.195
And Donald Trump is really a longtime Democrat.

01:03:32.695 --> 01:03:36.117
I mean, there's a quote from him in like 2006 or 2005, where he says, I identify as a Democrat.

01:03:40.663 --> 01:03:43.847
you know, as if it's like an identity thing.

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:51.177
And so he's a longtime Democrat, a corrupt New York State, New York City real estate

01:03:52.747 --> 01:04:06.218
Vogel, who was given everything and is just kind of disgusting, dirty guy, who is everything that conservative, rural, you know, Bible-thumping America hates and reviles.

01:04:07.059 --> 01:04:19.228
But somehow this guy, you know, they put a red hat that says, Make America Great Again, and fashioned him into this image and sold it to middle America.

01:04:21.038 --> 01:04:24.906
That mirage, that script is still in play right now.

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:26.350
Agreed.

01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:31.481
I think, though, if I'm being honest with you, I don't think Donald Trump would have won.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.781
He had no political opposition in real sense.

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.763
But even now, does he have any real political opposition?

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:48.787
It's almost as if the Democrats went with this idea that Donald Trump is Satan, Donald Trump is the devil, Donald Trump is Mussolini, he's Hitler, he's gonna put Liz Cheney against the wall and shoot her in the face.

01:04:48.807 --> 01:04:51.408
So you shouldn't vote for Trump.

01:04:52.409 --> 01:04:54.610
We have all this lawfare that was effectively used.

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.412
And then when he wins, you have nothing to fall back on.

01:04:59.209 --> 01:05:03.871
He basically, you threw any and everything that you can think of you as hysterical as you can be.

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:05.272
They say never go for retarded.

01:05:05.472 --> 01:05:06.593
Well, they went for retarded.

01:05:07.273 --> 01:05:10.355
And at the end of it all, he's still standing.

01:05:10.675 --> 01:05:12.696
And so at that point, it's like, okay, well, what do you have else to throw at him?

01:05:13.056 --> 01:05:13.736
You've done everything.

01:05:14.116 --> 01:05:15.237
You've tried to throw him in jail.

01:05:15.617 --> 01:05:17.478
You've called him everything but a crowd of God.

01:05:17.618 --> 01:05:19.039
You hit him with everything but the kitchen sink.

01:05:19.799 --> 01:05:20.740
And none of it worked.

01:05:21.519 --> 01:05:28.946
And he was able to get this kind of political coalition of Republicans where he could consolidate his political power with effectively the Republicans.

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:32.689
Now, they may have limits.

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:48.083
So we're still talking about Donald Trump as somebody who's just smarter than or better than other people and inevitably won, and therefore now is driving the bus, which I said as a long time ago, and I will really try to reiterate it now,

01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:53.146
Donald Trump is not driving the aircraft carrier.

01:05:53.206 --> 01:06:17.623
The reason why the planes take off and land, the reason why, you know, everything runs fine, the reason why the battleships are where they are relative to the carrier, the reason why mom is where she is in the water when all these planes are landing and the way that they're parked and all the meals are served and all the people are where they're supposed to be all the time is because this is a well-oiled, orchestrated, well-orchestrated machine.

01:06:18.561 --> 01:06:34.107
The American government is a well-orchestrated, well-oiled bureaucracy that doesn't function just because, completely differently, just because, oh, Donald Trump is now in the driver's seat, and therefore, this machine is now doing all kinds of things that it wouldn't normally do.

01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:37.428
But we are led to believe that's the case.

01:06:37.948 --> 01:06:47.552
We are led to believe that at the moment's notice, this aircraft carrier can do a left turn, and turn around, or go underwater, or fly away.

01:06:49.746 --> 01:06:57.589
And even the best aircraft carrier metaphor is bad because we really should be thinking of it like a cruise ship.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:03.830
Aircraft carriers can go pretty fast and can turn pretty sharply relative to how big they are.

01:07:05.031 --> 01:07:11.033
The average ship of that size with the kind of, you know, like a cruise ship cannot do that.

01:07:12.313 --> 01:07:18.495
And that's really more what the American system is like, the American economy, the American government.

01:07:20.299 --> 01:07:21.721
You must think of it that way.

01:07:21.781 --> 01:07:29.331
You must think of it that way, that there's no way they can blame everything on Donald Trump or on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:29.411 --> 01:07:31.554
unless all of this was all ready to go.

01:07:33.664 --> 01:07:37.785
all of this, you know, strip mining of America.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.686
Basically, this is all ready to go.

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:40.986
It's already happening.

01:07:41.006 --> 01:07:45.648
It was already going and these people aren't putting up any meaningful resistance to it.

01:07:45.688 --> 01:08:00.733
That's why they're talking about dyes and in Froot Loops instead of the wholesale destruction of the real estate market in America and the vacuuming up of private homes in America by moneyed interests all over the United States.

01:08:00.793 --> 01:08:01.893
This is not a joke.

01:08:03.618 --> 01:08:11.761
And these two guys still seem to be convinced that at the head of the operation is still some kind of mad genius named Donald Trump.

01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:13.242
He's just an actor.

01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:15.643
He's not a really great actor.

01:08:15.683 --> 01:08:31.449
And therefore he's able to get control of the largest bureaucratic apparatus on earth ever imagined with the most expensive and most expansive military on earth and just able to take control of it because he's a great actor.

01:08:32.864 --> 01:08:34.285
That's not what happened.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:46.031
They're using a great actor and people on social media that agree that that must be what happened in order to convince America that that's what's happening.

01:08:48.253 --> 01:08:50.094
But that's not at all what's happening.

01:08:50.154 --> 01:08:51.434
He controls nothing.

01:08:55.797 --> 01:09:00.900
Actually, if Trump is like, hey, I need you guys to sign a deal to end the Ukraine war, they're gonna tell Trump to F off.

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:08.571
But in regards to just basic politics, Trump has been able to consolidate power and destroy his political opposition.

01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:13.554
It's not like Democrats are like, here's the plan that we're going along with, and here's the policies.

01:09:14.514 --> 01:09:16.535
There's nothing coming out of them, nothing at all.

01:09:17.036 --> 01:09:18.937
Let me put this out there.

01:09:19.637 --> 01:09:19.817
Yeah.

01:09:21.878 --> 01:09:29.383
So Trump, so the opposition, the Democratic opposition to Trump, from when he was a candidate until- I mean, for example,

01:09:30.453 --> 01:09:44.337
Steve Bannon being ultimately behind Donald Trump and being a Goldman Sachs investor and being connected to 9-11 narratives and, you know, film companies and all this other stuff, that's all Mark's stuff.

01:09:45.077 --> 01:09:54.120
It's hard for me to imagine that Dan didn't learn all of that by working with Mark on the Li Min Yan article, but he also didn't credit Mark with that either.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:00.102
He has been saying, the way I like to say it, the way that I think about it, the way that I phrase it,

01:10:01.192 --> 01:10:06.673
Which is fine, I have said many times, I just want people to take this language and run with it.

01:10:06.733 --> 01:10:22.437
But it's remarkable that somebody who's known me for almost three years in the background, has been trying to get me to write something with him in the background for that long, would now take all of my verbiage and kind of just represent it as his own.

01:10:23.057 --> 01:10:30.259
And Mark's story about Bannon and that kind of represented as his own insight into this

01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:40.769
you know, social media, national security script, which, again, it's hard for me to swallow this as, but it's, it's all good.

01:10:40.809 --> 01:10:41.649
This is how it works.

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:47.275
And immediately when he got into power, of course, when he when he won, immediately they launched Russiagate.

01:10:48.292 --> 01:10:59.939
Now for anybody who was watching critically and wasn't being partisan, you can see that it was obviously phony from the start.

01:11:00.639 --> 01:11:01.600
And what did it do?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.622
It strengthened Trump in the eyes of middle America.

01:11:08.183 --> 01:11:09.964
Was that part of the script?

01:11:10.425 --> 01:11:14.627
Was that intended to fail, to make Donald Trump

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.770
look better.

01:11:17.551 --> 01:11:18.931
Oh, you think all of this is theater?

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:21.272
You think that this is just Punchy Judy?

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:25.954
I mean, somebody pulling the strings for the Punchy Judy parts.

01:11:27.094 --> 01:11:30.976
Steve Bannon is deeply connected in Hollywood.

01:11:31.656 --> 01:11:34.357
Where did Trump derangement syndrome come from?

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:39.619
Hillary Clinton wanted to find a way in order to A, make herself

01:11:40.842 --> 01:11:42.203
Yeah, and Russiagate was a way to do it.

01:11:42.223 --> 01:11:43.224
You're talking about Russiagate.

01:11:43.524 --> 01:11:43.724
OK.

01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:43.885
Yeah.

01:11:43.985 --> 01:11:45.326
Which, you know, I brought up Russiagate, obviously.

01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:45.566
OK.

01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:50.470
Russiagate, obviously, Hillary Clinton and intelligence agencies.

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:50.950
Right.

01:11:51.310 --> 01:12:02.760
Now, did Donald Trump ever really deviate from what Hillary Clinton would have done or what the intelligence agencies, you know, what the deep state, the establishment wanted him to do?

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:03.801
No.

01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:06.303
So we don't know that.

01:12:06.863 --> 01:12:10.046
I mean, keep in mind, Hillary Clinton was talking about putting air defense in Syria.

01:12:10.902 --> 01:12:15.485
Hillary Clinton was easily going to get further involved in Ukraine without any issue.

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:16.886
Donald Trump did that.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:23.129
Donald, when Obama was president, the, of course, the Maidan coup happened.

01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:31.074
Trump, Trump came in and Obama said, I will only send defensive weapons to Ukraine, not lethal weapons.

01:12:31.675 --> 01:12:33.616
Trump said, no, we're sending lethal weapons.

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.057
He escalated it.

01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:37.418
Why?

01:12:37.438 --> 01:12:40.280
Because just to be clear, it wasn't in a vacuum.

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:50.053
They were screaming bloody murder that Donald Trump was effectively an errand boy for Vladimir Putin, that any and everything that he did... He's the president.

01:12:50.093 --> 01:12:55.556
Why does he have to listen to what the screeching Democrats are saying?

01:12:55.596 --> 01:12:57.117
At that point, he had won.

01:12:58.499 --> 01:12:58.900
Seriously?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.241
I mean, come on.

01:13:00.762 --> 01:13:07.330
You know that these guys, when they are under political pressure, which, what he was, I mean, they were literally trying to impeach him.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:08.651
They impeached him twice.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:10.694
First time was nonsense.

01:13:10.714 --> 01:13:11.795
Second one was fair game.

01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:17.302
I guess I'm saying it's, I don't think- He thinks the impeachment was real.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:19.840
Right?

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.821
That's the problem.

01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:25.683
He doesn't see the timeframe and Dan needs to relate to him the timeframe.

01:13:26.283 --> 01:13:29.325
The timeframe is that whole period there.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:33.507
Pre-COVID, first term, it's all the same show.

01:13:34.147 --> 01:13:37.588
He was the same Clinton insider.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:41.090
That's why Gottlieb was his FDA director.

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.111
Come on, guys.

01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:44.472
Come on, Dan, you can do it.

01:13:45.772 --> 01:13:46.773
It's not unreasonable.

01:13:47.762 --> 01:13:52.026
when a massive wave of political pressure is being applied.

01:13:52.046 --> 01:13:53.387
Hell, they even had an investigation.

01:13:53.507 --> 01:13:56.450
If Mueller would have found anything, they would have taken another one from him.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:14:05.397
See, he's again, assuming that the Mueller investigation was real, that the hearings were real, and they're not.

01:14:05.477 --> 01:14:07.379
They're a national security theater.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.160
He still doesn't get it.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.802
I don't know if Dan gets it either, really.

01:14:11.743 --> 01:14:12.323
Put him in a cage.

01:14:12.483 --> 01:14:15.506
And that's exactly, they found nothing, all of it,

01:14:16.172 --> 01:14:25.175
failed, all the impeachments, all of the Russiagate stuff, it all failed and it all consolidated him as the man.

01:14:25.255 --> 01:14:27.396
It brought him back to the White House again.

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:28.356
I agree.

01:14:29.396 --> 01:14:30.176
I agree with you on that.

01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:33.998
I'm just pointing out that human beings do respond to political pressure.

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:38.259
And anything that Trump did, they were trying to get Donald Trump.

01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:52.003
You and I are, we subject, we are subject to pressure, but like the halls of power, like they're not, they don't give a shit how much we, we demonstrate against, you know, against the genocide or the coup in Venezuela.

01:14:52.423 --> 01:14:54.966
None of that makes a bit of difference.

01:14:55.006 --> 01:15:02.633
We could be out there unless we are actually stopping the machinery, you know, physically blocking it from happening.

01:15:03.106 --> 01:15:05.047
We can protest all day long.

01:15:05.248 --> 01:15:06.248
They do not care.

01:15:06.449 --> 01:15:07.349
Biden didn't care.

01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:08.690
Trump doesn't care.

01:15:09.251 --> 01:15:10.992
They, you and I are subject.

01:15:11.392 --> 01:15:12.073
Absolutely.

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:15.375
The puppets in the puppet show are not actually hitting each other.

01:15:16.236 --> 01:15:17.837
Absolutely.

01:15:18.457 --> 01:15:28.365
And you know what people think about us, like that influences us, those powerful, you know, the U S government does, doesn't care.

01:15:28.465 --> 01:15:32.528
The, the Republicans don't care if like, you know,

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.327
if, you know, they call him Putin's puppet and say there's a pee tape, they can say that all they want.

01:15:41.129 --> 01:15:51.139
They like, and if you look at what I was gonna say before, if you look at Trump, the whole phenomenon of Trump derangement syndrome, like

01:15:52.904 --> 01:16:06.213
think about kathy griffin beheading that beheading trump remember that all that kind of stuff so get ready to make sure that you see that there's still a

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:08.929
still not there yet, right?

01:16:08.969 --> 01:16:32.480
Because Dan should be saying, first of all, the whole concept that all of these people on social media agreed that there was such a thing as Trump derangement syndrome and that everybody started talking about that was a scripted phenomenon that was then reinforced by the beheading of Donald Trump in wax by

01:16:33.896 --> 01:16:43.804
Kathy Griffin, the promotion of that image on both sides of the narrative and Snoop Dogg's controversial music video.

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.465
It's all part of that.

01:16:45.786 --> 01:16:47.327
You watch, you know, The View.

01:16:49.849 --> 01:16:55.553
A lot of that came from, like, Hollywood and, you know, media personalities and especially Hollywood.

01:16:56.274 --> 01:16:57.755
Steve Bannon is

01:16:58.410 --> 01:16:59.611
deep in Hollywood.

01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:03.293
He was a Hollywood producer for years after he left Goldman Sachs.

01:17:03.353 --> 01:17:09.137
He was in Hollywood for several years working on documentaries where he was the executive producer of numerous documentaries.

01:17:09.477 --> 01:17:11.718
He has stakes in production firms.

01:17:12.118 --> 01:17:18.622
He's connected to like Seinfeld, the Seinfeld show, for example, like he is deep in Hollywood.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.287
Trump derangement syndrome, those kind of antics

01:17:27.421 --> 01:17:29.633
came from Hollywood and what does it do?

01:17:29.653 --> 01:17:30.377
It makes...

01:17:31.149 --> 01:18:00.401
middle america look at these insane hollywood liberals and be like baby hat they want to be had our president like yeah i don't love trump he's kind of you know sleazy but like look at these you know make you know this guy's changing this guy's really changing just the same way that charlie kirk was really changing you know it's what i'm saying i i'm just at a point where i just see this stuff and there's and there's very compelling evidence that this stuff is scripted these are scripts

01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:03.583
I don't doubt that some of it is scripted.

01:18:04.424 --> 01:18:06.465
You would have my complete agreement on some of it.

01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:14.972
It's hard to tell where the distinction is between... Okay, part of it is the script can change.

01:18:16.019 --> 01:18:18.800
You know, it's like a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:27.601
Like, the script has to correspond to reality, or else... I've also said choose-your-own-adventure many times in my stream describing it that way.

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:32.963
There's an enormous amount of verbiage right now that is directly giga-ohm biological.

01:18:33.003 --> 01:18:33.643
It's awesome.

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:37.003
You know, it's not gonna work, you know?

01:18:37.424 --> 01:18:38.464
Yeah.

01:18:39.144 --> 01:18:44.245
So, you know, like, did they want Donald Trump to win?

01:18:45.464 --> 01:18:49.248
I don't know, you know, maybe they would have been perfectly happy if Hillary Clinton won.

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.149
Did they want, you know what I mean?

01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:56.775
I think you're leaving out incompetence, like meaning these people may just be stupid too.

01:18:57.255 --> 01:19:10.127
Like, if you get my point, like when they're going after Donald Trump and they're using Hillary Clinton is going with this whole Russiagate stuff and intelligence state goes with the whole Russiagate stuff and this stuff gets stovepiped into the FBI where they have an investigation.

01:19:11.144 --> 01:19:14.206
As a person, just as a human being, that's pressure.

01:19:14.466 --> 01:19:22.231
That is political pressure where you know they are trying to rip you out of office and anything that they can do to rip you out of office and anything that they find.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:28.694
Every narrative at that point that's created goes under this model of Trump is doing this because he's working with Putin.

01:19:28.794 --> 01:19:32.076
So it's like, well, Trump doesn't put sanctions on Putin for,

01:19:33.257 --> 01:19:46.183
you notice right it's the host's video that sucks dan's video is pretty continuous i hope my video is continuous so it's just the host's video which i find kind of remarkable is he in a hotel room like

01:19:47.248 --> 01:19:47.948
So bizarre.

01:19:48.008 --> 01:19:49.569
He was falling asleep earlier.

01:19:49.749 --> 01:19:50.969
It's strange.

01:19:51.409 --> 01:20:01.393
Stealing the election because he's working with Putin, as opposed to the common sense thing of, well, if you pass sanctions on Russia for stealing the election, it implies that Donald Trump didn't win the election on his own.

01:20:01.873 --> 01:20:06.935
But everything was put under that lens, even the whole, well, why doesn't Trump give offensive weapons?

01:20:07.745 --> 01:20:09.206
Well, obviously he's working with Putin.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:15.169
Like, none of this stuff was necessarily associated with reality, but all of it was fit through a context.

01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:21.733
I'm saying that Trump, like any other person, is stuck with that, the gravity of the context.

01:20:21.773 --> 01:20:23.113
And you can see the effect on him now.

01:20:23.554 --> 01:20:33.499
When Donald Trump is going out and giving press briefings, and he spends like 15 minutes saying, well, I put in javelins, I've been difficult on Putin, I passed sanctions, I did all of this.

01:20:33.999 --> 01:20:34.940
He's not saying that for his health.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:54.466
he's saying that because he is still stuck with this idea that some people believe that he was working with the russians and anything that he does in that context needs to be see he thinks that donald trump is calculating what to say based on what he feels and his ego and all this other stuff and it's wrong

01:20:55.512 --> 01:21:03.978
He has the problem still that he can't see that Donald Trump is not a actor acting on his own.

01:21:04.038 --> 01:21:05.999
He's an actor reading a script.

01:21:06.039 --> 01:21:08.241
He doesn't seem to understand yet.

01:21:09.062 --> 01:21:09.462
Wow.

01:21:09.802 --> 01:21:13.725
Somehow justified by showing how much of a badass he was towards the Russians.

01:21:14.405 --> 01:21:15.226
It bit into him.

01:21:16.462 --> 01:21:21.646
I'm saying, I agree with you that some of this stuff is scripted, but the behavior is getting across something else.

01:21:22.486 --> 01:21:24.868
This is not like Trump reading a script.

01:21:25.269 --> 01:21:35.396
This is Trump dealing with, for all intents and purposes, seemingly trauma of that first term of the shit that they were throwing at him.

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:40.780
Tell me if you think I'm wrong on this.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.822
I think this is a case of,

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.742
again, fool me once, shame on me, shame on you.

01:21:47.543 --> 01:21:55.549
We're like, in the first term, I really, I was on the same page with, you know, what, with what you're saying, like, yeah, bring him all the time.

01:21:55.589 --> 01:22:05.357
And, you know, he doesn't really want even met with Putin and all this stuff, you know, and, but, um, like, Trump, you know, Trump is a candidate.

01:22:05.697 --> 01:22:11.302
I mean, of course, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's candidate talk, but you know, I'm going to end the Ukraine war on the first

01:22:11.707 --> 01:22:12.791
the first day, blah, blah, blah.

01:22:13.272 --> 01:22:18.569
I mean, honestly, you could end the Ukraine war quite easily if you wanted to.

01:22:20.108 --> 01:22:22.910
But he's like announcing new sanctions all the time.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:25.072
And then he says, this is Biden's war.

01:22:25.132 --> 01:22:25.752
This is Biden's war.

01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:26.533
This isn't my war.

01:22:26.573 --> 01:22:29.495
You know, he said that's like his go to every time.

01:22:29.935 --> 01:22:31.737
That is obviously a script.

01:22:31.877 --> 01:22:34.619
That's obviously like a rehearsed thing for him to say.

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:36.260
This is Biden's war.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.361
Like, no, this is your war.

01:22:37.481 --> 01:22:43.426
And it was your war when you decided to send when you sent offensive weapons in your first term and you escalated it.

01:22:43.866 --> 01:22:45.127
So this is a bipartisan.

01:22:45.147 --> 01:22:46.448
This is a uniparty war.

01:22:46.488 --> 01:22:48.930
This is not, you know, just a Democrat thing.

01:22:49.238 --> 01:22:54.845
agree all you know you were campaigning with lindsey graham at the same time that you were telling people

01:22:57.122 --> 01:23:01.044
in the, you know, I just see this as like, right.

01:23:01.164 --> 01:23:07.628
Yeah, it's like right wing Obama, that it's like, you know, people were tired of Bush.

01:23:08.308 --> 01:23:19.334
And, you know, we got like, of like this, like country ass idiot, who is clearly like stupid and went to war on Iraq on a series of lies.

01:23:19.454 --> 01:23:23.456
And, you know, we shed all this blood and treasure and killed all these Iraqis.

01:23:23.836 --> 01:23:24.957
And now we get like,

01:23:26.098 --> 01:23:35.386
a good looking, like, black dude, as a time when identity politics are becoming like more important.

01:23:35.426 --> 01:23:38.569
And wow, we have like a minority as president.

01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:43.493
And, you know, and he says, like, change and all this stuff.

01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:46.416
And like, people were immensely hopeful.

01:23:47.157 --> 01:23:47.297
And

01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:49.699
It was a huge letdown.

01:23:49.899 --> 01:23:52.780
He was the quintessential establishment candidate.

01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:54.881
And it's the same thing with Trump.

01:23:55.021 --> 01:24:07.705
It's like, these are the, you know, generational kind of scripts that I'm saying that it's like, okay, you know, we have this goal that we want to do, say, 50 or 100 years or whatever it is, this is what we're trying to do.

01:24:08.225 --> 01:24:10.326
How are we going to maintain

01:24:10.965 --> 01:24:12.906
this theater until then.

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:19.328
Okay, we need to invade this country, we need to invade this country, we need to roll out this program domestically, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:24:19.628 --> 01:24:21.328
Look at these social phenomenons.

01:24:21.428 --> 01:24:24.349
It's like, that's how they see us.

01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:27.330
And we have to keep the image of democracy.

01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:33.932
And sometimes we have to make this party look really stupid and crazy so we can have this one rise.

01:24:34.132 --> 01:24:35.373
I just see it as-

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:41.206
in this case?

01:24:41.988 --> 01:24:44.355
They, that's a great question.

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:48.846
I can craft the exact same thing with individual actors.

01:24:50.014 --> 01:24:59.098
Like meaning you have a moneyed interest that pushes on political parties to do X or Y. The money interest pays for both.

01:24:59.758 --> 01:25:11.343
So you get this kind of weird unit party thing in the way that it functional or operates, even though they have to mouth certain things from their own constituencies, even though ultimately they back very similar policies.

01:25:12.003 --> 01:25:14.144
Like I don't need a they for that in that case.

01:25:14.864 --> 01:25:15.865
You get Donald Trump.

01:25:16.605 --> 01:25:26.273
having to go at Jeb Bush and then leans into the whole anti-war thing, even though obviously he's still trying to do primacy for the United States, regardless of what comes out of his mouth.

01:25:27.515 --> 01:25:32.399
So he thinks the whole system can just be coordinated by money donations, right?

01:25:32.439 --> 01:25:42.087
So the entire cruise ship and all the food that gets served and all the cleaning that happens and all the parties that get thrown, or better yet, which I really like better,

01:25:42.547 --> 01:25:52.812
The aircraft carrier and all the things that need to happen in order for that aircraft carrier to launch and land a hundred planes a day happens because people are paid lots of money.

01:25:53.793 --> 01:25:55.934
Otherwise that whole place wouldn't work.

01:25:57.014 --> 01:26:00.376
Even though it's an aircraft carrier where nobody needs money.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.418
Nobody needs the money that they're at when they're at work.

01:26:04.518 --> 01:26:08.320
Nobody has any incentives to work hard except for the fact that what?

01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:11.822
They wanted to be a part of it.

01:26:13.069 --> 01:26:16.873
They believed in the idea that this was something that they should do, want to do.

01:26:16.933 --> 01:26:19.956
They wanted to be a part of that team of a thousand sailors.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.163
And so I want you to see that still they're not there yet.

01:26:27.203 --> 01:26:29.846
They don't see how it's possible that the U.S.

01:26:29.886 --> 01:26:36.913
government could be controlled by scripted actors because they don't see that it is nearly all of them

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:48.952
And more importantly, behind certain scripted actors like Donald Trump, surrounding certain scripted actors like Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:49.032 --> 01:27:00.934
or Jay Bhattacharya or any of these other people are a series of scripted national security actors behind them, acting as advisors and coaches.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:05.975
That's how they do it.

01:27:06.155 --> 01:27:07.095
That's how they've done it.

01:27:08.106 --> 01:27:09.687
Bobby Kennedy may be a victim.

01:27:09.747 --> 01:27:11.228
He may be just a dum-dum.

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:12.088
That's possible.

01:27:12.689 --> 01:27:14.370
Donald Trump is just an actor.

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:16.091
That's very, very likely.

01:27:18.257 --> 01:27:22.200
And so we need to wake up and understand that this is not real.

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.461
These people are not real.

01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:28.064
And social media is a military weapon that we cannot use safely.

01:27:28.545 --> 01:27:29.525
Neither can our children.

01:27:29.986 --> 01:27:32.488
Biden who's like, oh, I'm working tirelessly to stop the war.

01:27:32.968 --> 01:27:33.588
Okay, no, you're not.

01:27:34.069 --> 01:27:34.769
You're just lying.

01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:40.073
Like some of this stuff is just them doing this stuff for political expediency to get from point A to point B. I don't know.

01:27:40.514 --> 01:27:41.594
For one, I don't think the US has 50 years.

01:27:43.362 --> 01:27:45.262
for them, they can plan out whatever they want.

01:27:45.483 --> 01:27:47.183
I don't think this is gonna last 50 years.

01:27:48.143 --> 01:27:53.664
And I don't know- But how can you make a statement like that without some kind of, what is it?

01:27:53.704 --> 01:27:55.405
A financial thing that's gonna happen?

01:27:55.865 --> 01:27:57.385
A racial thing that's gonna happen?

01:27:57.425 --> 01:27:58.466
A class divide?

01:27:58.926 --> 01:28:05.827
What kind of bullshit statement is that to say without any real details about what you think is happening?

01:28:05.867 --> 01:28:08.088
Because I think it's a controlled demolition.

01:28:10.424 --> 01:28:15.435
I think the controlled demolition has been happening for some time, probably since 9-11 or a little before.

01:28:17.319 --> 01:28:20.887
They want to destroy the US as we know it, like vulcanize it, you know?

01:28:21.837 --> 01:28:23.138
That's the other interesting point.

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:36.365
Did you read the article, and we can end on this one, where the guy, I think it was a Russian guy, who was pointing out that Trump's plan is to devalue the dollar, that the debt is so high that it is impossible to pay back.

01:28:36.985 --> 01:28:46.550
And so the goal is to get all of these countries on cryptocurrency where the debt can be manipulated in a way where the dollar can be devalued to such a degree what the US can at that point.

01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:51.433
Basically, you're crashing the US market, crashing the US economy.

01:28:52.935 --> 01:28:53.715
I didn't read that, no.

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:56.276
I mean, it's a compelling argument.

01:28:56.336 --> 01:28:57.776
I would love to read that.

01:28:58.297 --> 01:29:02.158
Yeah, and you'd find the thing, the article for it.

01:29:02.258 --> 01:29:04.778
Let me say one more kind of... Please.

01:29:05.899 --> 01:29:11.640
How about the ancient European royal bloodlines are in charge, but they need Sherpas.

01:29:12.701 --> 01:29:13.221
How's that?

01:29:15.622 --> 01:29:16.422
One more thing about that.

01:29:18.142 --> 01:29:20.483
I think one of the big reasons

01:29:20.882 --> 01:29:25.587
for COVID, in fact, was you brought up the national debt.

01:29:25.688 --> 01:29:31.314
And we're talking about what are the long term plans of our ruling class?

01:29:33.256 --> 01:29:39.904
COVID, obviously, I mean, we could talk about this for like an hour easily.

01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:55.596
If you look at our population pyramid, and especially population pyramids in the West in general, but not only in the West, also in China and Russia and Japan, but we're talking about, of course, the United States.

01:29:57.262 --> 01:30:00.885
We have a rapidly aging population.

01:30:01.045 --> 01:30:03.346
The boomers are dying out.

01:30:04.047 --> 01:30:07.489
They are causing a huge strain on the health care system.

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:11.272
They are not producing and contributing to the tax base.

01:30:11.972 --> 01:30:17.977
And, you know, our generation, I'm 40 now, I guess, you know, I don't know how old you are somewhere.

01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:19.798
I'm much more ancient than you are.

01:30:19.918 --> 01:30:20.198
Really?

01:30:20.218 --> 01:30:21.539
Oh, congratulations, bro.

01:30:21.599 --> 01:30:22.479
I just had a birthday.

01:30:22.599 --> 01:30:23.720
I just had a birthday August 31.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.240
All right.

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.280
All right.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.021
Congratulations.

01:30:26.081 --> 01:30:31.703
But like our generation, and, you know, younger than us, we're not having as many kids.

01:30:32.544 --> 01:30:49.531
Obviously, our, you know, our population is not growing, we have an inverted, basically an inverted population, you know, a healthy population pyramid looks like this, a triangle, a lot of young people, a lot of babies, aging, you know, and then people die off and

01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:50.351
Okay.

01:30:51.172 --> 01:30:53.414
Ours is basically the opposite.

01:30:53.514 --> 01:31:06.945
And they've been seeing for decades, they've been able to see that the boomers, post-World War II, everyone has a lot of kids, are going to become burdens on the system.

01:31:07.325 --> 01:31:11.068
And everyone's been saying, social security is going to, you know, can't pay for this.

01:31:11.088 --> 01:31:14.110
Social security is not going to exist when, you know, you and I retire.

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:17.873
And our national debt is enormous.

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:18.674
Now,

01:31:19.744 --> 01:31:24.912
COVID with what I would I argue is a

01:31:28.092 --> 01:31:51.711
a fake pandemic, a pandemic that did not actually happen, but was projected through social media, through cable TV, but especially social media, was used to kill a lot of, in particular, older people in order to sculpt those population pyramids to keep the system intact.

01:31:52.772 --> 01:31:54.454
and to keep this whole thing going.

01:31:54.914 --> 01:31:56.636
And this is actually not my theory.

01:31:56.676 --> 01:31:58.197
I can't take credit for this at all.

01:32:00.739 --> 01:32:14.811
If you want to talk to one of the most interesting people I know, this is the theory, the observation of of a guy named Jonathan J. Cooey, who

01:32:16.087 --> 01:32:18.129
was an academic.

01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:32.300
He was an academic biologist working at the University of Pittsburgh, who was fired for pointing out that the covid shots were actually an old technology that that biologists use all the time called transfection.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.602
But it wasn't a new technology at all.

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:43.669
And he was basically researching on his own, doing all kinds of research and streaming on his own.

01:32:45.171 --> 01:32:47.132
to figure out what's going on with the pandemic.

01:32:47.493 --> 01:32:50.495
He was then hired by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

01:32:52.716 --> 01:33:05.965
Kennedy, RFK brought him on to help him write his book, The Wuhan Lab Leap, or The Wuhan Cover-Up, which is all, you know, the case that the COVID-19 came from the Wuhan lab.

01:33:06.686 --> 01:33:14.191
And in the middle of writing that, Cooey realized the whole thing doesn't even make sense, that the thesis

01:33:14.887 --> 01:33:26.733
that it came that COVID was COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was a novel virus came from a laboratory, or was even a novel virus at all, didn't make any sense.

01:33:26.933 --> 01:33:28.114
And we were being fooled.

01:33:29.034 --> 01:33:31.015
We were being lied to that there was a pandemic.

01:33:31.395 --> 01:33:35.077
When he went to RFK to say this, you know, this is what I figured out.

01:33:35.617 --> 01:33:36.518
RFK fired him.

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:38.299
Yeah.

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:38.579
RFK

01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:44.153
RFK doesn't have the scientific literacy to be able to evaluate that argument.

01:33:44.473 --> 01:33:46.254
He just told them this isn't the place for that.

01:33:46.574 --> 01:33:50.838
So it's like he hired him to write this book, he hired this scientist to write the book.

01:33:51.618 --> 01:33:54.540
And then and then scientists came and said, No, no, we got it all wrong.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.401
And he's like, you're out.

01:33:55.821 --> 01:34:02.526
Now, RFK, of course, was brought in as he's now Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, right?

01:34:02.546 --> 01:34:05.649
That is part of a script is what I'm saying.

01:34:05.729 --> 01:34:06.069
So like,

01:34:07.222 --> 01:34:09.063
I highly recommend you interview Cooley on this.

01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:10.064
Yeah, I disagree with you on that.

01:34:10.804 --> 01:34:11.504
I'll be blunt.

01:34:11.584 --> 01:34:12.325
I just disagree with you.

01:34:12.545 --> 01:34:14.766
I mean, like, I've known too many people who died from COVID.

01:34:15.206 --> 01:34:18.808
I've known too many people who died from COVID.

01:34:18.908 --> 01:34:20.369
Holy shit.

01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:24.071
For it to not be real.

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:24.711
Like, I don't know.

01:34:24.731 --> 01:34:27.232
I don't know how social media was killing people with COVID.

01:34:27.713 --> 01:34:28.313
I'll say it that way.

01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:34.943
Well, that's why this would be a this would be a long conversation to get to get into.

01:34:35.283 --> 01:34:40.765
But I mean, what I can say, okay, I'll give you I'll give you a clear, clear example.

01:34:41.125 --> 01:34:43.065
It took me it took me a couple of years to figure this out.

01:34:43.466 --> 01:34:46.507
When I mean, I was, you know, I got the shots.

01:34:46.607 --> 01:34:47.687
At first, I was like,

01:34:48.072 --> 01:34:50.914
I was paying attention was going on in China as an anti-imperialist.

01:34:50.994 --> 01:34:53.797
And I was like, man, this is really serious.

01:34:53.857 --> 01:34:55.018
We need to be masking.

01:34:55.058 --> 01:34:56.199
No one's masking around here.

01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:57.099
This is crazy.

01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:00.202
You know, like we need to lock down.

01:35:00.282 --> 01:35:02.604
Look, China locked down and they're beating the virus.

01:35:02.684 --> 01:35:06.967
And, you know, I I'm telling you, I came from the complete other side.

01:35:07.548 --> 01:35:09.590
I was what I would say was completely taken in.

01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:14.994
It took me when I started to realize maybe this is not what it

01:35:16.351 --> 01:35:37.296
appears is I saw, and I can show you all this stuff, but the US government issued, the FDA in particular, issued a new protocol for how a death certificate is written.

01:35:37.996 --> 01:35:44.578
Normally, how a death certificate has always been written in this country is it is a medical opinion.

01:35:45.307 --> 01:35:50.230
So you can have all kinds of medical opinions, right?

01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:57.854
It's a medical opinion from either a doctor, but usually it's like a coroner or something like that.

01:35:59.233 --> 01:36:05.339
And how it works is you have, it's a sequence of events that led to the death.

01:36:05.519 --> 01:36:07.682
So you have the immediate cause of death.

01:36:08.282 --> 01:36:12.246
And that is a sequence that leads back to like the underlying cause of death.

01:36:12.306 --> 01:36:16.490
So say you died of, you know, some viral, some infection.

01:36:18.052 --> 01:36:21.996
Well, you had that you died of that infection, that's the immediate cause of death.

01:36:22.662 --> 01:36:26.684
because your body couldn't fight it because you had, you know, cancer.

01:36:26.724 --> 01:36:27.585
Something else going on.

01:36:27.625 --> 01:36:27.805
Yeah.

01:36:28.065 --> 01:36:28.265
Right.

01:36:28.685 --> 01:36:29.366
And so that's me.

01:36:29.786 --> 01:36:31.667
And so the underlying cause of death was cancer.

01:36:31.687 --> 01:36:33.348
But the virus was the thing that actually did that.

01:36:33.368 --> 01:36:33.548
Right.

01:36:34.068 --> 01:36:36.670
And what actually killed you at that moment.

01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:47.996
But, you know, so it's like, you know, something that you and I or anyone with a healthy, normal immune system could fight off because you were very sick with cancer or heart disease or diabetes or whatever it is.

01:36:48.437 --> 01:36:49.877
You you can do that.

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:50.978
Your body couldn't fight it off.

01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:55.195
So what goes into the records, you know, is the underlying cause of death.

01:36:55.715 --> 01:37:14.994
Now, the FDA, I believe it was the FDA, I have to look to be sure, but I'm pretty sure it's the FDA, issued orders in February, March of 2020, that instructed hospitals, coroners, you know, all of these that deal with death certification, and it's mostly not doctors who deal with death certification, by the way.

01:37:16.155 --> 01:37:21.818
It instructed them to completely change how a death certificate is written.

01:37:22.318 --> 01:37:29.682
So now, firstly, the immediate cause of death is what you should focus on, not the underlying cause of death.

01:37:31.002 --> 01:37:38.526
And secondly, anywhere that COVID-19 is listed, that will be considered the underlying cause of death.

01:37:40.067 --> 01:37:42.648
And this is only applied to COVID-19.

01:37:43.855 --> 01:37:46.476
So like for everything else, it's the same protocol.

01:37:47.016 --> 01:37:55.899
But for this specific thing, it's where we've completely flipped upside down and then said anywhere COVID is is found.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.100
We're gonna call that a COVID a COVID death.

01:37:58.861 --> 01:38:00.861
No, but by definition, that means COVID was real.

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:06.824
I'm saying that, according to their definition.

01:38:07.344 --> 01:38:12.105
So if you I'm not saying that doesn't mean that that it's real.

01:38:12.185 --> 01:38:13.446
It means that

01:38:14.261 --> 01:38:21.445
what they are saying is we want you to change how you count completely in a completely different way.

01:38:22.105 --> 01:38:31.170
Now, if you look at, that doesn't mean COVID was real, that can, what I would say is that they were testing for things that were not a novel.

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:32.070
No, he just did.

01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:32.931
They were finding.

01:38:34.852 --> 01:38:38.394
Arthur Vandeley in the chat, he did just drop my name.

01:38:38.694 --> 01:38:40.455
He did just drop it a little while ago.

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:42.306
We watched it.

01:38:42.486 --> 01:38:45.008
He did drop it about at about 40 minutes in.

01:38:46.029 --> 01:38:49.652
Don't say anything about margarita pizza because I'm starving right now.

01:38:49.692 --> 01:38:51.733
My children are not answering my texts.

01:38:52.554 --> 01:38:55.156
I might just end up falling out of the screen.

01:38:55.196 --> 01:38:58.939
And if that's happened, it's probably just because I'm having a sugar crash right now.

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:02.542
We're things that already I need dinner.

01:39:02.582 --> 01:39:05.144
They were using PCR tests, which no one knows.

01:39:05.385 --> 01:39:06.946
Did you ever know what a PCR test is?

01:39:06.966 --> 01:39:09.368
Do you know what PCR stands for to this day?

01:39:10.832 --> 01:39:12.473
I knew at one point, I don't remember now.

01:39:12.774 --> 01:39:14.875
What I mean, the COVID thing was a while back.

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:16.916
I'm not I'm not trying to call you out.

01:39:16.957 --> 01:39:18.538
But what I'm saying is myself too.

01:39:18.698 --> 01:39:22.200
I'm like, we're sticking these things up our nose all of a sudden overnight.

01:39:22.961 --> 01:39:29.806
It's accepted that this thing called a PCR test, which no one knows what the hell that even stands for, let alone what it actually is.

01:39:29.886 --> 01:39:34.549
Scientifically, we don't have the scientific literacy to even know what that is, or being shoved up our nose.

01:39:34.609 --> 01:39:40.013
And that proves that tells us whether or not we have this virus, even if we're not

01:39:42.259 --> 01:39:46.002
have an infection, even if we're not physically sick, maybe you're still contagious, right?

01:39:46.302 --> 01:39:47.283
That was what we were told.

01:39:48.484 --> 01:39:51.186
In fact, those were non-specific.

01:39:51.786 --> 01:40:02.074
Those tests were made to find any tiny amount of a particle of any kind of coronavirus.

01:40:02.615 --> 01:40:10.241
So if I give you an analogy, say the police want to find the Batmobile,

01:40:11.981 --> 01:40:16.404
So they're like, the Batmobile's around here somewhere, and we're gonna use this test.

01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:19.145
And the Batmobile, we all know what the Batmobile is, very specific.

01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:23.988
So what they do is, we found a tire, okay?

01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:25.609
It's nonspecific.

01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:26.649
We found a tire.

01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:27.850
Damn, that wasn't my case either.

01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:30.592
And there are Batmobiles everywhere.

01:40:30.912 --> 01:40:32.593
We found many Batmobiles, right?

01:40:32.713 --> 01:40:37.996
I can tell you, in medicine, oftentimes, the test is looking for something that is

01:40:39.687 --> 01:40:43.751
Meaning you don't need something that says, we found this specific thing.

01:40:44.511 --> 01:40:46.934
What you're looking for is, do we have this particle?

01:40:47.314 --> 01:40:53.239
And predominance of the people with this particular particle will have X or Y. I understand your point.

01:40:53.319 --> 01:40:57.083
You're saying that a non-specific tire can be for any car, not just for the Batmobile.

01:40:57.623 --> 01:41:00.005
And when they found the tire, they're saying, hey, we have the Batmobile here.

01:41:00.726 --> 01:41:01.647
I understand your point.

01:41:01.867 --> 01:41:04.768
And everybody has, you know, and then everybody has this.

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:12.153
So what I'm saying, and again, this is I was completely taken in when I was like going through this, but everybody didn't have it.

01:41:12.493 --> 01:41:13.193
I never got COVID.

01:41:13.213 --> 01:41:14.354
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:41:15.214 --> 01:41:19.657
What I found, I didn't, I didn't, supposedly, I had Omicron.

01:41:20.638 --> 01:41:24.040
But I was, I, you know, it's fine.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.723
What, what I what I'm saying is, if you take, simply take

01:41:30.353 --> 01:41:35.456
the, let's assume that the PCR is real, and that COVID was real, let's just assume it was real.

01:41:36.797 --> 01:41:57.289
If you take the normal way that is used for everything else to this day, to quantify debts, to certify a debt, that protocol, and it has to be the only way you could do, you know, you could, you can have a, you have to apply the same definition to everything.

01:41:57.369 --> 01:41:59.871
Otherwise, you're going to have, you know, none of it makes sense, right?

01:42:00.529 --> 01:42:02.049
So they took a completely different one.

01:42:02.869 --> 01:42:28.094
If you took that normal way and applied it to COVID-19, and I went through the CDC's death certificate data, which is all available online in a database called Wonder, about 90%, according to them, according to their data, would not be considered COVID deaths, meaning if, like,

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:30.436
So that's the overwhelming majority.

01:42:31.337 --> 01:42:32.618
Would not be COVID deaf.

01:42:33.058 --> 01:42:33.459
I hear you.

01:42:33.599 --> 01:42:41.465
That was the first thing for me to get from completely agreeing with you to where I am today.

01:42:41.885 --> 01:42:46.288
I know we're going maybe longer than we planned to.

01:42:46.308 --> 01:42:46.769
No, you're fine.

01:42:46.789 --> 01:42:49.971
This is a big, big, big, big question.

01:42:53.345 --> 01:42:56.187
That was part of the National Security State Theater, is what I'm telling you.

01:42:56.267 --> 01:43:17.758
And I know what I'm saying sounds crazy to a lot of people, but what I would ask you, Jamaril, and your audience, is to not immediately dismiss, because really no one else is saying this, and certainly not on Twitter, or on right or left, or maybe it sounds more right-wing, I don't know, whatever.

01:43:18.962 --> 01:43:29.402
Don't immediately dismiss it, because it might sound crazy, but... Don't take this wrong, but a lot of people died.

01:43:30.925 --> 01:43:37.748
And you can say that they changed the mechanism, fair enough, but they would have to change the mechanism all across the world.

01:43:37.888 --> 01:43:44.730
In Brazil, they would have had to change it in Israel, they would have had to change it in Russia, China, et cetera, where all of these people were also dying.

01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:48.612
I don't think that the FDA was operating in any of these other countries.

01:43:48.952 --> 01:43:56.235
The World Health Organization issued, okay, for one thing, the World Health Organization, a lot of different countries had a lot of different protocols.

01:43:56.515 --> 01:43:58.936
However, in particular in the West,

01:43:59.741 --> 01:44:28.520
the World Health Organization issued its protocols and guidelines and actually wrote a piece not long ago showing that the figures who wrote the protocols for the World Health Organization were part of a basically massive lie to make the lab leak theory appear as if it were

01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:30.442
Oh, look, I don't doubt you on that.

01:44:30.683 --> 01:44:31.603
Fauci was full of shit.

01:44:32.184 --> 01:44:33.405
Agree.

01:44:33.746 --> 01:44:37.790
You can look at the emails that they were trying to hide and bury.

01:44:37.930 --> 01:44:39.251
Fauci was totally full of shit.

01:44:39.752 --> 01:44:41.754
We were totally engaged in function research.

01:44:42.254 --> 01:44:42.775
Oh, no, no, no.

01:44:42.795 --> 01:44:43.676
What I'm saying, no, no, no.

01:44:43.756 --> 01:44:46.779
I'm saying that the lab leak theory is bullshit.

01:44:47.439 --> 01:44:55.184
And it was and it's and it's scripted National Security State Theater to make us think that it was the real narrative that they were hiding from us.

01:44:55.525 --> 01:45:00.268
What I showed in a recent piece that was read this on my on my website, Uncaptured Media.

01:45:00.288 --> 01:45:03.090
I have my own my own site, Uncaptured Media.

01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:04.130
Yeah.

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:08.974
If you remember, I mean, you know, this is going this is going back to like July 2020.

01:45:11.755 --> 01:45:16.959
There was a supposed Chinese whistleblower named Li Mengyan.

01:45:18.055 --> 01:45:31.170
who came out on the Tucker Carlson show and said, you know, so primetime Fox TV, this is not like, you know, and said, COVID is a bio weapon.

01:45:32.251 --> 01:45:34.173
I just fled from Hong Kong.

01:45:35.194 --> 01:45:35.434
And, um,

01:45:37.588 --> 01:45:47.441
I'm telling you that COVID was a bioweapon from a Chinese lab and she, you know, was then seen as she was the the

01:45:50.539 --> 01:45:52.100
The first LabLeak whistleblower.

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.120
She was the original LabLeak whistleblower.

01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:58.742
And at that point, it was considered like right-wing and, you know, maybe racist or whatever.

01:45:58.862 --> 01:46:03.903
Dan did a long article with Housatonic, Mark Kulak.

01:46:03.983 --> 01:46:10.485
Mark Kulak wrote a lot of it, then Dan kind of cleaned it up and put it on his substack and they published it together.

01:46:10.605 --> 01:46:13.186
So that's where this is all coming from right now.

01:46:13.226 --> 01:46:14.146
This is Dan Cohen.

01:46:14.766 --> 01:46:17.027
And they were calling it the China virus and all this stuff.

01:46:17.947 --> 01:46:23.362
She, what I found, and I show this in the investigation, is that

01:46:26.303 --> 01:46:30.286
Li Meng Yan lied about who she was.

01:46:30.887 --> 01:46:34.289
She made it appear as if she had never been in the United States.

01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:38.553
It's weird because I don't think that he found any of this stuff.

01:46:38.573 --> 01:46:39.994
This is all Mark's work.

01:46:40.014 --> 01:46:42.576
So hopefully Mark's name is coming pretty soon.

01:46:43.416 --> 01:46:51.683
She was actually married in the United States and she is married into one of the most prominent families

01:46:52.427 --> 01:47:03.924
in the biomedical apparatus here in Washington in particular, whose work was substantially funded by Anthony Fauci's NIH.

01:47:04.665 --> 01:47:07.809
And I don't believe every random thing that I hear on this stuff.

01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:12.674
Well, but as you point out, the narratives get created all the time.

01:47:12.714 --> 01:47:16.037
But this was the narrative that was created.

01:47:16.057 --> 01:47:22.682
And at that point, everyone thought, no, it's just respectable people.

01:47:22.722 --> 01:47:24.203
This guy can't grasp it.

01:47:24.344 --> 01:47:26.065
He's shorting out in his head.

01:47:26.105 --> 01:47:28.147
He's like, I don't believe everything that I hear.

01:47:30.048 --> 01:47:32.811
Everything that you hear is part of the script.

01:47:34.349 --> 01:47:36.070
Your hat is too tight on your head.

01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:39.433
I'm going to show you what a good hat looks like.

01:47:39.573 --> 01:47:43.316
I probably came from nature, a bat cave or whatever.

01:47:43.396 --> 01:47:48.700
And it was considered right wing and racist to say that it came from a lab.

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:57.447
And it slowly became accepted, especially because of scripted actors and social media.

01:47:57.827 --> 01:47:58.688
This is what I'm saying.

01:47:58.708 --> 01:48:03.612
To tie this all the way back to the beginning of the conversation,

01:48:05.768 --> 01:48:11.883
The better, the more you can, the more that we, I don't, and I'm gonna say we, cause I'm part of this too.

01:48:12.284 --> 01:48:14.690
The more that we consume social media.

01:48:15.621 --> 01:48:28.433
And the more that we use it and think that we are good at it and that we are necessarily seeing the lies like, you know, and some of the lies are... In reality, this is way too early, right?

01:48:28.453 --> 01:48:37.321
This would be like a clockwork orange or the edge from U2 as my Halloween costume or my, you know, time travel hat.

01:48:38.141 --> 01:48:52.434
Um, but actually there are many, many houses on our street already that have the full, um, menagerie of inflatable, scary things on their, on their lawns and inflating them at night already.

01:48:52.474 --> 01:48:54.376
It's not even October yet.

01:48:54.436 --> 01:48:56.718
Like what, what in the world is going on?

01:48:58.359 --> 01:48:59.260
Oh, sorry.

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:02.950
They're so obvious.

01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:07.911
The October 7th lies, the drones in Poland, these lies are so obvious to us.

01:49:08.591 --> 01:49:10.832
Other lies, we get taken in by.

01:49:11.312 --> 01:49:14.672
And it's very, extremely difficult to know.

01:49:14.712 --> 01:49:20.873
And especially when it becomes like our profession, you know, that like, we're like, this is what we do professionally.

01:49:20.913 --> 01:49:22.894
This is what we devote our lives to all this stuff.

01:49:22.954 --> 01:49:24.774
It's really easy to get taken in.

01:49:24.974 --> 01:49:30.675
And then, you know, when your job depends on it, it's, I mean, I'm sure you- Dan and Mark got hooked up by me.

01:49:32.373 --> 01:49:34.394
I introduced them as far as I know.

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:42.700
You've heard the quote, never try to convince a man of something upon which his job depends.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.061
It's that kind of thing.

01:49:45.141 --> 01:49:49.123
So like, we become part of the script, and we don't even know it.

01:49:49.464 --> 01:49:57.889
I'm not saying that, you know, you tomorrow, you have to accept, you know, what I'm saying everything about COVID, just because I'm telling you, what I'm saying is like,

01:49:58.993 --> 01:50:00.114
Please have an open mind.

01:50:00.214 --> 01:50:02.675
Please take this stuff into consideration and go check it out.

01:50:02.735 --> 01:50:04.356
You know, go go into the rabbit hole.

01:50:04.436 --> 01:50:05.777
Look at some of the stuff I've published.

01:50:06.197 --> 01:50:09.839
Interview this cat, Jonathan J. Cooey, on this stuff.

01:50:09.939 --> 01:50:12.661
Ask him, why did you get how did you get in touch with RFK?

01:50:12.741 --> 01:50:17.063
You know, why did he who are, you know, interview him, ask him every question you want.

01:50:17.163 --> 01:50:21.185
One guy against like that's like saying somebody ran an experiment.

01:50:21.606 --> 01:50:25.008
The person came up with a result, but nobody else came up with the result.

01:50:26.008 --> 01:50:26.428
Is he right?

01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:27.249
He could be.

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:31.669
Am I going to believe one random guy?

01:50:32.009 --> 01:50:34.610
I'm not going to believe one random guy.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:35.731
Nice.

01:50:35.911 --> 01:50:36.431
I love it.

01:50:36.491 --> 01:50:40.453
That was awesome.

01:50:40.493 --> 01:50:41.853
That was awesome.

01:50:42.733 --> 01:50:43.614
He's just one guy.

01:50:43.654 --> 01:50:44.734
He's just one guy.

01:50:44.934 --> 01:50:48.796
Basically, everybody said Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.

01:50:49.036 --> 01:50:51.237
At that point, you were crazy if you didn't say that.

01:50:51.597 --> 01:50:54.698
As I pointed out, he could be right.

01:50:56.005 --> 01:50:58.726
Yeah, I'm not I'm not saying you have to blindly accept him.

01:50:58.886 --> 01:51:16.852
I'm not even saying you have to say he's the most important guy I'm telling you my opinion that I think he's one of the the sharpest minds in the country and is a real It's a real basically a threat to the system and that's why we haven't heard of him That's why he's not invited on on big podcast.

01:51:16.892 --> 01:51:22.514
That's also whoa That's like I'm like I'm up there with Whitney Webb now.

01:51:22.614 --> 01:51:23.615
Holy crap

01:51:24.776 --> 01:51:28.464
In part, he doesn't try to engage with social media because he sees it as a theater.

01:51:32.577 --> 01:51:37.019
So, I mean, it's very, very easy to be co-opted into the script.

01:51:37.399 --> 01:51:45.083
And it's like, when you step into the matrix, whatever, it's hard to know what is organic, what is inorganic, what's fake.

01:51:45.123 --> 01:51:48.605
And all of a sudden- No, he has not reached out yet.

01:51:48.685 --> 01:51:48.945
No.

01:51:49.405 --> 01:51:53.387
You know, like I was, I really, I'm telling you, that happened to me.

01:51:53.627 --> 01:51:57.429
I really thought- I mean, honestly, it is very difficult to find a floor.

01:51:57.909 --> 01:51:58.249
Agreed.

01:51:58.789 --> 01:51:59.470
And it is easy to,

01:52:03.359 --> 01:52:06.761
let's say fold ourselves in the narratives one way or the other.

01:52:07.381 --> 01:52:08.462
So I agree with you on that.

01:52:09.082 --> 01:52:09.602
I do agree.

01:52:10.263 --> 01:52:13.144
So I'm just saying all this stuff needs to be re-examined.

01:52:13.304 --> 01:52:21.068
And like the fact that, you know, what happened in COVID, with COVID is considered like- Where's Dan Cohen in the chat?

01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:23.930
Why does everybody keep saying that Dan Cohen is in the chat?

01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:25.871
I do not see Dan Cohen in the chat.

01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:29.773
So if he's in the chat, I already blocked him a long time ago.

01:52:29.833 --> 01:52:30.854
How is that possible?

01:52:31.656 --> 01:52:33.518
Dan Cohen 3000.

01:52:33.558 --> 01:52:35.399
Where is Dan Cohen 3000?

01:52:35.439 --> 01:52:36.540
I see fun times 2000.

01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:40.144
Oh, listed as a viewer.

01:52:40.304 --> 01:52:41.265
Oh, he is in the chat.

01:52:41.385 --> 01:52:41.825
Oh, wow.

01:52:41.845 --> 01:52:42.366
Okay, wow.

01:52:42.446 --> 01:52:42.746
Great.

01:52:42.826 --> 01:52:43.126
Hi.

01:52:43.206 --> 01:52:43.747
Hi, Dan.

01:52:44.468 --> 01:52:45.008
Very nice.

01:52:45.288 --> 01:52:45.729
Shout out.

01:52:45.789 --> 01:52:46.269
Thanks, man.

01:52:46.630 --> 01:52:49.112
That is part of the multi generational

01:52:50.583 --> 01:53:03.167
plan that we are living through, of how that restructured society carried out all kinds of things that most people are not even aware of, but a lot of people suffered from.

01:53:03.547 --> 01:53:05.948
No, Dan, just let me make clear, Dan is not blocked.

01:53:06.008 --> 01:53:06.949
I can see Dan.

01:53:07.009 --> 01:53:09.349
It's just that I didn't see him chatting.

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:12.991
So everybody was saying that he was in the chat, but I couldn't see him chatting.

01:53:13.051 --> 01:53:13.831
I didn't notice it.

01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:17.594
He has a different color, so it's, yeah, anyway.

01:53:17.774 --> 01:53:19.315
In a multitude of ways.

01:53:19.776 --> 01:53:22.438
And to say that that was like, well, that was like years ago.

01:53:22.598 --> 01:53:23.319
Yes, it was.

01:53:23.479 --> 01:53:29.485
But I mean, our society has been completely restructured since then, and it's still extremely relevant.

01:53:29.905 --> 01:53:36.131
So I know like right now, you know, Gaza and Ukraine and Charlie Kirk are like,

01:53:37.418 --> 01:54:04.274
more way to go dan that's all i can really say i mean it was really hard for me at first in the beginning of the interview to hear a lot of my verbiage or what i imagine is my verbiage because i'm not paying attention a lot but um and and wonder if if there was going to be a shout out i i really think that mark deserves a shout out as well um but thank you very much for that uh wonderful uh hat tip i don't think i'm one of the

01:54:05.234 --> 01:54:17.751
sharpest front and center in our minds, but you know, we have to be thinking in not only like reacting to the headlines and what's happening, but react, you know, longer term.

01:54:19.107 --> 01:54:25.131
And we can end it on this, but I think from your point of view, this is kind of like, what does a mass destruction in Iraq?

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:28.854
Like the ramifications go for decades.

01:54:29.134 --> 01:54:37.099
I mean, we're still dealing with the ramifications of this kind of project for a new America that was kicked off by Bush lying us into a war.

01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.181
They just got Syria, you know.

01:54:39.361 --> 01:54:39.601
Yeah.

01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:40.242
Yeah.

01:54:40.822 --> 01:54:42.363
After 20, yeah, after 20 something years.

01:54:42.623 --> 01:54:42.783
Yeah.

01:54:42.963 --> 01:54:47.306
And I think your point is like the restructuring of the state in the way that COVID has affected

01:54:49.447 --> 01:54:56.609
all of this will have long-term repercussions and that our assumptions for it need to be re-examined.

01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:57.810
I do get the point.

01:54:58.050 --> 01:54:58.890
I'm not discounting you.

01:54:59.010 --> 01:55:00.470
I don't want you to think that I'm just blowing you off.

01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:00.831
I'm not.

01:55:01.491 --> 01:55:06.472
I do get where you're coming from with it, the point that you're making associated with it.

01:55:07.252 --> 01:55:15.395
Like in the same way that media can kind of get on a bandwagon and run with a particular thing and people have a certain idea of the world, well, the same thing would be true for the way COVID was

01:55:16.295 --> 01:55:19.278
introduced and the way that we dealt with this thing that was introduced.

01:55:19.699 --> 01:55:20.099
No, I get it.

01:55:20.379 --> 01:55:20.700
I do get it.

01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:21.521
I'm not discounting.

01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:24.043
I swear to God, I'm not.

01:55:24.364 --> 01:55:24.644
I get it.

01:55:24.704 --> 01:55:26.105
And like, honestly, I get that.

01:55:26.205 --> 01:55:32.492
I get like, you know, people react strongly to it because it's an emotional thing.

01:55:32.512 --> 01:55:34.454
People are like, yeah, like I know people that died.

01:55:34.614 --> 01:55:34.894
Like my

01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:39.613
You know, people like I know people that died around me, you know, my whatever, like.

01:55:40.754 --> 01:55:44.136
So it's it's not just like a passing headline or whatever.

01:55:44.176 --> 01:55:46.278
It's a personal thing we all live through.

01:55:46.338 --> 01:55:50.722
You know, people went through crazy isolation or this or that, and maybe they lost their job or whatever it is.

01:55:50.762 --> 01:55:58.367
So I'm not saying I don't I don't, you know, take like offense to people being like, you know, being like, what?

01:55:58.428 --> 01:55:59.468
That sounds crazy, man.

01:55:59.488 --> 01:56:00.189
What are you saying?

01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:03.191
I'm all I'm all I'm saying is like,

01:56:05.546 --> 01:56:15.151
Like, just- It's unfortunate that this guy's video is so bad that you can't really get a good feeling for what he's feeling or not feeling or seeing.

01:56:15.211 --> 01:56:17.032
It cuts out at all the wrong times.

01:56:17.692 --> 01:56:19.413
It is incredibly annoying.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:22.741
Let's be clear, I never said that.

01:56:23.461 --> 01:56:27.001
I patiently listened.

01:56:27.021 --> 01:56:27.942
No, I don't even blame you.

01:56:28.102 --> 01:56:32.482
Okay, you had a minor reaction, but I don't blame you for that.

01:56:32.523 --> 01:56:33.583
I'm not even saying that.

01:56:33.663 --> 01:56:35.943
Ladies and gentlemen, I think Dan did a really good job.

01:56:35.983 --> 01:56:40.564
I'm just going to cut him off there because I want to get to the next thing before I need to find food.

01:56:41.124 --> 01:56:49.446
Remember that virology and the myth of it is in danger right now because, for example, this is the head of virology at Harvard.

01:56:50.046 --> 01:57:07.075
I don't think that if he's unlucky and he would happen to sit down at a bar at a virology conference and I would happen to be there, I don't think he could have a conversation with me without needing to walk away.

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:11.970
I think Vincent Racaniello is in exactly this.

01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:24.037
I think a lot of people that go to virology conferences are in a situation where if they were to sit down next to me at a bar with their little lanyard on and I started talking to them, they would have a very bad evening.

01:57:25.678 --> 01:57:27.379
And so all of that is to come.

01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:31.382
All of that's going to happen because I'm not going anywhere.

01:57:31.522 --> 01:57:38.926
And I have supporters out there that are at least keeping the lights on and keeping the sandwiches in the kids' lunchboxes.

01:57:39.006 --> 01:57:40.387
And so I'm going to keep doing this.

01:57:41.748 --> 01:57:52.354
I think that we are victims of a national security theater that is primarily motivated by the Human Genome Project and its endless shortcomings.

01:57:56.693 --> 01:58:03.705
And these people descend from a group of mentors that goes all the way back to the 40s and 50s and the Manhattan Project.

01:58:06.610 --> 01:58:10.256
And that's why the loss of David Baltimore is so crucial.

01:58:11.192 --> 01:58:17.078
to understand its significance because David Baltimore and I would have a much more difficult conversation.

01:58:17.799 --> 01:58:26.789
I mean, Joshua Lederberg and I would have a much more difficult conversation and I could very easily be outclassed by those two in theory.

01:58:28.356 --> 01:58:39.683
There aren't very many people left on the playing field that can hold the, carry the water that David Baltimore could carry and certainly cannot carry the water like Joshua Lederberg could have carried the water.

01:58:40.224 --> 01:58:55.554
And, and Kevin McKernan has already exposed himself as a scripted actor by plugging Rixey and by plugging no-see-um technology and trying to blame Barrick and also being associated behind the scenes.

01:58:57.082 --> 01:59:03.064
with the operation and advising of Children's Health Defense, and I would testify to that in a court of law.

01:59:04.945 --> 01:59:14.109
And so we have been bamboozled by a national security state theater that included the anti-vax movement that killed Brandi Vaughn and Tony Barker.

01:59:16.553 --> 01:59:26.602
And so this is a national security theater using scripted conversations and they are conversations being had by scripted actors and all the actors trust the script.

01:59:27.503 --> 01:59:40.174
Pandemic biology and RNA virology are definitely part of the script, but the main overarching motivation is the Human Genome Project and the inversion of our children's sovereignty to that of experimental animal status.

01:59:40.234 --> 01:59:43.317
Now, what Mark has so eloquently

01:59:43.957 --> 02:00:05.937
outlined on his archive website and with his latest week or two of shows is that these people go back into show business for decades and that means that they're still working with each other essentially meeting each other at parties and award shows and the bottom line is is that these are people who've known each other for years and years and years

02:00:08.126 --> 02:00:18.599
And people with that level of familiarity, that level of professional trust, that level of consistent behavior with each other,

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:43.031
can be the foundation for a very successful military campaign, a very successful business campaign, a very successful basically undermining of a conservative, a inflation of a fake conservative movement on the lawn of every brain of every social media user in America and around the world.

02:00:46.152 --> 02:01:02.693
Now, just to take the pressure off of an evening like this and end on a good note, I want you to think and give another example of what could be done with people that have known each other their whole lives and how, you know, also good things come out of lifelong friendships.

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.824
Everybody, pretty much when you travel to Texas, they look up best barbecue, and then if you're in that top 10, they're gonna come to your restaurant.

02:01:15.765 --> 02:01:18.206
Texas Monthly, it's a magazine for Texas.

02:01:18.667 --> 02:01:23.430
They have an issue that comes out every four years, and it ranks the best barbecue in the state.

02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:28.293
I think they go to in the 400s, like, different barbecue restaurants throughout Texas.

02:01:29.127 --> 02:01:30.207
So it's a huge thing.

02:01:30.227 --> 02:01:33.608
It'll take your business from like one to 10.

02:01:33.728 --> 02:01:36.889
I mean, we maybe used to do about 12 racks of ribs.

02:01:36.969 --> 02:01:39.369
Now we're cooking 40 to 50 racks of ribs.

02:01:39.689 --> 02:01:40.650
This is pretty crazy.

02:01:44.231 --> 02:01:46.431
They don't tell you before that you got number ones.

02:01:46.471 --> 02:01:47.771
There's no like heads up.

02:01:48.111 --> 02:01:51.332
But the day it happened, we celebrated maybe for like an hour.

02:01:51.352 --> 02:01:53.253
Then it was like, all right, we know it's coming.

02:01:53.313 --> 02:01:54.333
So we got to get to work.

02:02:00.182 --> 02:02:01.942
The barbecue is called Goldie's.

02:02:01.962 --> 02:02:04.803
I think they won it four years ago.

02:02:04.823 --> 02:02:06.283
We only open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

02:02:06.603 --> 02:02:09.804
But it's a long process to get ready for just those three days.

02:02:10.564 --> 02:02:11.444
It's all in there.

02:02:11.464 --> 02:02:13.545
What's up?

02:02:16.265 --> 02:02:20.786
On Mondays, we're pretty much just doing a lot of stuff for the sides, our desserts.

02:02:20.806 --> 02:02:22.507
We knock that out, too, that day.

02:02:22.527 --> 02:02:24.487
Try to get ready for the week.

02:02:25.967 --> 02:02:27.728
Joe's going to be making a rib place.

02:02:27.868 --> 02:02:29.148
I think PJ's got the mix.

02:02:33.624 --> 02:02:41.487
Everything's gonna be made from scratch here, so that's why it takes a little bit longer to, like our banana pudding, I mean, we're stirring it constantly while it's on the stove.

02:02:41.627 --> 02:02:44.669
Everything just takes a long time, because we all do it from scratch.

02:02:45.869 --> 02:02:50.151
When we bake our bread and we cut it on the weekend, this is like all the end pieces.

02:02:54.068 --> 02:03:00.234
Lots of half and half, butter, vanilla, sugar, a little bit of salt.

02:03:00.794 --> 02:03:01.275
It's like 35 minutes.

02:03:01.295 --> 02:03:04.037
Just pour it all over.

02:03:04.098 --> 02:03:09.743
How much butter is in here?

02:03:10.023 --> 02:03:15.169
It's a lot of butter, but this is enough crumble for about 180 portions for the banana pudding.

02:03:16.018 --> 02:03:20.779
For the volume we're cooking right now, we really got to be in on Monday to get ready for that week.

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:25.001
Like Tuesday, Wednesday are also like extremely long days where we take up the whole kitchen.

02:03:25.061 --> 02:03:33.723
So you can't really do some of that side prep and dessert prep before on those days.

02:03:36.464 --> 02:03:38.205
Then I'm definitely fasting now.

02:03:42.385 --> 02:03:46.272
I like seeing the customers, like, their reaction, like, when they try a sample.

02:03:47.374 --> 02:03:52.202
I like when they, like, they come from all over the state and all over the country.

02:03:52.222 --> 02:03:53.604
I'm like, they really came here.

02:03:54.546 --> 02:03:55.047
That's fire.

02:04:05.094 --> 02:04:09.296
So every week, we spend about $8,000 to $10,000 alone on briskets.

02:04:09.796 --> 02:04:13.918
Brisket is pretty much the most important meat in Texas barbecue.

02:04:13.938 --> 02:04:14.318
$10,000 on brisket.

02:04:14.338 --> 02:04:16.259
That's why they like to say brisket is king.

02:04:16.279 --> 02:04:19.080
That's kind of corny, but it really is, though.

02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:23.682
If you have a Texas barbecue restaurant, the brisket has to be the best thing on the menu.

02:04:25.063 --> 02:04:30.225
Tuesday, Chuck, Johnny, Lane, and Zane will trim all the briskets.

02:04:30.245 --> 02:04:32.906
That's like an eight- to nine-hour shift right there alone.

02:04:33.766 --> 02:04:34.887
It's crazy how they do it.

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:37.850
It's got one big table and just piles of briskets.

02:04:37.930 --> 02:04:39.891
Yeah, just trimming it up for eight hours straight.

02:04:41.453 --> 02:04:45.056
We're trimming it down to a certain amount of fat that we know that we can render, basically.

02:04:45.777 --> 02:04:49.300
We make the sausage out of the scrap and the tallow out of the fat.

02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:53.964
How many are you guys gonna have to go through today?

02:04:53.984 --> 02:04:53.964
120.

02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:57.307
So one half the brisket is a completely different muscle.

02:04:58.027 --> 02:05:25.408
then the other half which is like this this top part right here and you can kind of see it right here too so that's cooking it a little tricky you're basically leaving two different cuts of meat on and trying to cook them evenly the same when one has like not as much fat another one has a lot of fat you want these like nice round edges that are more aerodynamic in the smoker and don't crisp up as much dude chuck is the brisket she has the brisket shift like she's the badass that they feature at the end of the movie it's awesome

02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:30.295
Same with the front of the brisket, you kind of make this nice and round as well.

02:05:30.315 --> 02:05:34.200
So what you're saying is a brisket is like a car.

02:05:35.222 --> 02:05:35.382
Yeah.

02:05:35.903 --> 02:05:38.606
What we're trying to trim it down to is to look like that.

02:05:38.947 --> 02:05:42.852
Like there's a nice fat band on top and then the meat's right underneath.

02:05:43.192 --> 02:05:44.793
They all make it look pretty easy.

02:05:45.513 --> 02:05:46.214
It's not, though.

02:05:46.254 --> 02:05:48.835
I mean, we're just pretty good at what we do.

02:05:49.276 --> 02:05:54.619
To get as good as they're doing, I mean, they probably all trimmed into thousands of briskets at this point.

02:05:55.019 --> 02:05:57.801
I'm good also, but I'm just a little bit slower than them.

02:05:58.481 --> 02:05:59.421
They're all really fast.

02:05:59.902 --> 02:06:00.682
I can be Zane, though.

02:06:00.722 --> 02:06:01.503
Zane's not that fast.

02:06:01.663 --> 02:06:04.745
What would you say is your record time in trimming a brisket?

02:06:04.825 --> 02:06:05.945
A minute.

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:07.446
A minute?

02:06:07.566 --> 02:06:08.026
Yeah, a minute.

02:06:09.267 --> 02:06:10.348
Lane, what's your fastest time?

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.860
59 seconds.

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:14.300
59 seconds.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:14.861
Zane?

02:06:14.881 --> 02:06:15.881
30 seconds.

02:06:16.381 --> 02:06:16.942
30 seconds!

02:06:17.262 --> 02:06:19.863
Nah, there's no way Zane can do it in 30 seconds.

02:06:19.943 --> 02:06:21.284
It'll be all scalped up.

02:06:22.484 --> 02:06:24.245
You see the wing's nice and round now.

02:06:24.485 --> 02:06:26.606
There's not a whole lot of pointy edges.

02:06:26.626 --> 02:06:29.768
See how Zane looks all weird and different from mine.

02:06:30.668 --> 02:06:32.129
This is how it's supposed to be.

02:06:32.169 --> 02:06:32.969
That's how it's supposed to be?

02:06:32.989 --> 02:06:34.270
How is it not supposed to look?

02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:36.531
This is a little unlaid here.

02:06:45.814 --> 02:06:51.760
You gotta take a break here and there, you know.

02:06:52.561 --> 02:06:53.982
Gotta hydrate between the trims.

02:06:54.002 --> 02:07:01.670
You want a crisp brisket?

02:07:01.930 --> 02:07:03.111
Do I want a crisp brisket?

02:07:03.652 --> 02:07:04.193
Hell yeah.

02:07:08.812 --> 02:07:15.302
sell this brisket for like half of what you just keep it flat the entire time that was great

02:07:25.246 --> 02:07:26.808
Another margarita for us.

02:07:26.908 --> 02:07:30.491
I just got a statement on the scallops.

02:07:30.511 --> 02:07:32.153
The fat is trimmed down perfect.

02:07:32.253 --> 02:07:33.634
I like the front of the plate.

02:07:33.674 --> 02:07:34.776
I think it looks good.

02:07:34.796 --> 02:07:36.257
The Mohawks trimmed down nice.

02:07:36.317 --> 02:07:37.478
The three scallops?

02:07:37.538 --> 02:07:37.939
Yeah.

02:07:38.039 --> 02:07:40.821
All right.

02:07:40.922 --> 02:07:41.542
This is hard.

02:07:42.283 --> 02:07:43.764
I got to give it to you guys.

02:07:44.165 --> 02:07:44.565
It's not easy.

02:07:44.585 --> 02:07:44.885
Thank you.

02:07:44.905 --> 02:07:45.266
Thank you.

02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:50.034
The way we trim, we'll probably lose about 30% of what's on the brisket.

02:07:50.254 --> 02:07:52.716
When you put it on the smoker, it shrinks about half.

02:07:52.857 --> 02:07:56.000
So at that point, yeah, you're down to about a third of the original weight.

02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:59.764
That's how we calculate, like, what the prices of, like, our brisket is.

02:08:00.244 --> 02:08:01.846
That's why we try to make it as good as possible.

02:08:01.886 --> 02:08:05.670
We don't want people going home paying that much money for subpar brisket.

02:08:22.577 --> 02:08:25.079
So on Wednesday, we do a lot of stuff on Wednesday.

02:08:25.099 --> 02:08:27.121
That's the day we start sausage.

02:08:27.161 --> 02:08:30.865
So that's when we're doing about 200 to 250 pounds of sausage.

02:08:31.385 --> 02:08:37.311
And then also, that's when we trim all our pork ribs, anywhere from 120 to 150 pork ribs.

02:08:37.411 --> 02:08:40.214
I think we also trim beef ribs that day, too.

02:08:40.774 --> 02:08:43.337
So that's the day we kind of do a lot of different stuff.

02:08:44.667 --> 02:08:45.547
Is this from yesterday?

02:08:45.807 --> 02:08:45.987
Yeah.

02:08:46.647 --> 02:08:48.288
What do you use the tallow for?

02:08:49.148 --> 02:08:53.309
We'll use the tallow just to hold up the briskets overnight and to make them look shiny.

02:08:55.369 --> 02:08:56.229
Dan, what are you doing?

02:08:56.949 --> 02:09:00.890
So we're grinding the brisket herrings from yesterday to make sausages.

02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:04.831
Everything got marinated with the spices and everything.

02:09:04.851 --> 02:09:08.471
So we'll grind it through and then they'll get cooked tomorrow.

02:09:08.871 --> 02:09:09.711
Are you trying to grind too?

02:09:09.731 --> 02:09:12.372
I always grind and grind, baby.

02:09:12.692 --> 02:09:12.972
All right.

02:09:15.595 --> 02:09:17.876
Sausage, that's the tricky one.

02:09:17.956 --> 02:09:20.678
That's the one that you really gotta do it a lot to get good at.

02:09:20.698 --> 02:09:23.099
At this point, I mean, I do enjoy making sausage.

02:09:23.119 --> 02:09:25.980
That's probably the thing I was best at when we started the restaurant.

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.281
It is tedious, but it is fun.

02:09:28.342 --> 02:09:31.183
It's a good feeling after you finish all the sausages up, yeah.

02:09:32.143 --> 02:09:34.985
The sausage wings, they like to pop a lot, like PJ's doing right now.

02:09:39.831 --> 02:09:40.952
Uh-oh.

02:09:41.032 --> 02:09:42.292
I just popped some, too.

02:09:42.492 --> 02:09:43.453
You know, it happens.

02:09:43.873 --> 02:09:44.353
It happens.

02:09:44.513 --> 02:09:45.674
Is that what that bin is for?

02:09:45.914 --> 02:09:47.655
Yeah.

02:09:47.675 --> 02:09:48.475
Hey, open up that bin.

02:09:48.895 --> 02:09:49.836
It's not too bad.

02:09:49.936 --> 02:09:51.256
I just got one popped in.

02:09:51.296 --> 02:09:52.757
It's also the meat for it right here.

02:09:52.817 --> 02:09:54.258
It's all the stuff that got mixed up.

02:09:54.278 --> 02:09:55.818
I thought you guys were number one.

02:09:56.439 --> 02:09:58.620
No air bubbles.

02:09:58.640 --> 02:09:59.940
They didn't do this thing.

02:10:03.022 --> 02:10:03.962
Never in my life seen that.

02:10:06.477 --> 02:10:07.578
Making sure they're tight.

02:10:07.938 --> 02:10:11.919
I hear that the team likes to call you the Glizzy Gobbler.

02:10:12.059 --> 02:10:14.920
No, no one's called me the Glizzy Gobbler before.

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.241
It's fine though.

02:10:16.301 --> 02:10:17.801
I mean, I'm not mad about it.

02:10:17.821 --> 02:10:18.422
It's whatever.

02:10:18.442 --> 02:10:23.984
How many sausages total do you think you guys are making?

02:10:24.044 --> 02:10:23.984
480?

02:10:24.084 --> 02:10:24.824
480 sausages?

02:10:24.844 --> 02:10:27.025
That's a lot of glizzies.

02:10:36.138 --> 02:10:36.718
Where you guys going?

02:10:36.738 --> 02:10:38.679
P-City.

02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:39.940
Lunchtime?

02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:40.820
Yes, sir.

02:10:43.102 --> 02:10:46.163
Once a week, we like to go to another barbecue restaurant.

02:10:46.403 --> 02:10:49.005
We go hang out with the pitmasters.

02:10:49.025 --> 02:10:50.125
We're all pretty close.

02:10:50.405 --> 02:10:59.070
But yeah, you just want to go check out other barbecue restaurants, see what they're doing, see how we're still comparing, still trying to learn stuff, even at this point, see how we can make our food better.

02:10:59.850 --> 02:11:02.131
So that's the Flaco's half-baked potato salad.

02:11:02.211 --> 02:11:06.352
It's like a twice-baked, but Flaco is always baked, so we call it half-baked potato salad.

02:11:06.652 --> 02:11:08.093
We got a regular potato salad.

02:11:08.113 --> 02:11:09.553
This is a spicy vinaigrette slaw.

02:11:09.573 --> 02:11:10.174
Thank you so much.

02:11:10.374 --> 02:11:13.195
I do think I would weigh about 250 if I lived in Texas.

02:11:13.395 --> 02:11:14.015
My goodness.

02:11:14.215 --> 02:11:17.416
Cheese salad burritos, pork belly burnin' poppers.

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:21.217
We got the brisket elote right here, and then all your standard fare.

02:11:21.237 --> 02:11:23.038
We got ribs, turkey, brisket.

02:11:23.378 --> 02:11:24.578
Our pork ribs are super good.

02:11:24.598 --> 02:11:25.519
This is my favorite.

02:11:25.539 --> 02:11:29.040
The corn, the brisket, everything just goes perfect together.

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.521
What was it like when you both got on the list?

02:11:32.081 --> 02:11:32.762
It was a shock.

02:11:33.182 --> 02:11:38.405
You know, you try to put your best foot forward all the time, but I think just making the list, you're still surprised.

02:11:38.445 --> 02:11:41.366
It's still such an honor that people recognize you for what you just had.

02:11:41.386 --> 02:11:42.927
So, it was definitely a shock.

02:11:43.167 --> 02:11:43.667
It was a good shock.

02:11:43.687 --> 02:11:45.408
Look at those pieces of meat!

02:11:46.609 --> 02:11:46.709
Oh!

02:11:46.989 --> 02:11:48.930
So, you're probably the best ribs I've had from Pepperson.

02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:53.002
Whatever their glaze is, it's a nice sweet one.

02:11:53.022 --> 02:11:56.963
It's not like super fall-off-the-bone, it's got a good bite to it.

02:11:57.084 --> 02:11:58.624
It's cooked really well, too.

02:11:59.225 --> 02:12:01.025
It's a high-season cutback.

02:12:01.166 --> 02:12:01.646
Mm-hmm.

02:12:02.826 --> 02:12:04.527
You should get half of your poppers on the menu.

02:12:04.567 --> 02:12:04.967
Yeah.

02:12:05.468 --> 02:12:06.548
Freshly seasoned real well.

02:12:07.188 --> 02:12:08.289
EJ, what do you think?

02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.950
It's kind of sweet.

02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:10.710
I like it.

02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:12.551
It's not fall-off-the-bone.

02:12:12.751 --> 02:12:13.692
It's got a good bite.

02:12:19.355 --> 02:12:24.659
So those three guys have known each other since elementary school, and this is what they can accomplish.

02:12:24.699 --> 02:12:34.988
They can become the best barbecue restaurant in Texas because they do it better and better and better every day until they got so good at it.

02:12:35.028 --> 02:12:37.169
All of us, we all went to the same elementary.

02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:39.451
I've known Lane since kindergarten.

02:12:39.531 --> 02:12:44.055
Johnny moved in third grade to our elementary school, so we were all friends before that.

02:12:45.854 --> 02:12:48.661
He can bring tears to your eyes if you think about it.

02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:50.826
Johnny worked at Franklin.

02:12:50.866 --> 02:12:52.089
He worked at Valentino's.

02:12:52.289 --> 02:12:54.675
Lane worked at Micklewaite and Freedman's.

02:12:54.735 --> 02:12:55.978
I also worked at Freedman's.

02:12:58.314 --> 02:13:22.325
Now I want you to think about how dark it is that the entire Trump movement might just be a sort of elaborate improv comedy theater that is being put on by a bunch of people who all go back 30 years to comedy and acting and Harvey Weinstein and Steve Bannon's film companies.

02:13:23.763 --> 02:13:29.927
Actually, it was like, all right, we should team up together and have our own barbecue restaurant and just run it the way we want to run it.

02:13:30.968 --> 02:13:33.309
Since then, we've been hanging out every day.

02:13:36.692 --> 02:13:39.133
Thursdays, me and Lane get there, like, in the early morning.

02:13:39.714 --> 02:13:44.757
Lane is touching up the briskets, which is pretty much just going back over the briskets, making sure it's trimmed correct.

02:13:45.657 --> 02:13:47.619
And then I will be on the other side of the table.

02:13:47.699 --> 02:13:49.200
I'll start seasoning all the briskets.

02:13:50.583 --> 02:13:51.463
Goldy supplement?

02:13:51.763 --> 02:13:52.023
Yep.

02:13:52.103 --> 02:13:56.005
I can't tell if they're interested.

02:13:56.045 --> 02:13:58.405
You can't tell if they're interested.

02:13:58.505 --> 02:13:59.165
Why not?

02:13:59.325 --> 02:14:00.326
It's a secret.

02:14:01.446 --> 02:14:01.926
I'll give you $3.

02:14:02.446 --> 02:14:07.008
I'll tell you after breakfast.

02:14:07.068 --> 02:14:08.648
Put them over here.

02:14:08.788 --> 02:14:13.169
Let them sit a little bit so the salt and all sinks into the meat too a little bit.

02:14:13.269 --> 02:14:13.950
For example.

02:14:19.848 --> 02:14:19.969
you

02:14:30.353 --> 02:14:34.034
Texas barbecue, especially for the briskets, you wanna do it low and slow.

02:14:34.074 --> 02:14:36.755
We start off at about 200 degrees.

02:14:36.775 --> 02:14:43.838
It doesn't get any hotter than 300, and that's a long process, so it takes about 12 to 14 hours just for the briskets.

02:14:44.758 --> 02:14:45.959
Same thing with the pork ribs.

02:14:45.979 --> 02:14:49.380
That's about a six-hour cook, so it's really long cooks.

02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:53.642
You get a lot of smoke on it, but it just gives it that great smoky flavor, though.

02:14:56.483 --> 02:14:57.543
It's pretty hot.

02:14:57.923 --> 02:14:59.904
It's hot in that smokehouse for sure.

02:15:00.124 --> 02:15:08.046
So in the summer, it's not really my favorite time to be out there smoking briskets or just being in that pit room, especially when it's like over 100 degrees.

02:15:08.126 --> 02:15:12.627
I think our pit room's at about like 115 when you're in between both those smokers.

02:15:12.687 --> 02:15:17.568
You open a door, you get a big gust of like heat and then smoke like fills your eyes up.

02:15:17.608 --> 02:15:22.169
It's pretty crazy, but I think that's why people love smoking this way, yeah.

02:15:32.961 --> 02:15:35.483
I think I like really how long it takes.

02:15:35.543 --> 02:15:36.644
I really like a long cook.

02:15:36.664 --> 02:15:38.826
It's just you and the fire just hanging out.

02:15:39.166 --> 02:15:40.607
It's really relaxing, honestly.

02:15:42.989 --> 02:15:44.530
It's got to be hot as balls.

02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:46.512
This is what it's got to be hot.

02:15:46.532 --> 02:15:47.973
That's right on the dot.

02:15:48.514 --> 02:15:50.756
That scales off a little bit.

02:15:50.856 --> 02:15:53.638
We are shaping the bread loaves right now.

02:15:53.698 --> 02:15:55.339
We've got our polka dot right there.

02:15:55.379 --> 02:15:57.161
That was made a couple of days ago.

02:15:58.268 --> 02:16:00.790
Usually at a barbecue restaurant, bread is like a throwaway item.

02:16:00.810 --> 02:16:02.090
You always see it in the trash.

02:16:02.151 --> 02:16:03.631
Like, it's just a waste of money pretty much.

02:16:03.671 --> 02:16:07.594
So we wanted to make it so good that people, like, didn't do that.

02:16:08.234 --> 02:16:10.496
We do about 50 loaves a day.

02:16:11.036 --> 02:16:13.318
People always come up and ask if they can buy the bread.

02:16:13.338 --> 02:16:15.259
We're like, no, we give our bread out for free.

02:16:16.019 --> 02:16:17.420
Richard, do you like dealing with bread?

02:16:18.741 --> 02:16:20.962
Depends on the type of bread we're talking about.

02:16:21.002 --> 02:16:22.563
What kind of bread do you like?

02:16:22.583 --> 02:16:25.185
The blue one.

02:16:26.269 --> 02:16:33.332
You ever taught me that move?

02:16:33.452 --> 02:16:33.912
I did.

02:16:33.932 --> 02:16:36.133
I taught everybody that move, but nobody did it.

02:16:36.193 --> 02:16:37.213
What is that?

02:16:37.774 --> 02:16:38.494
That monitor.

02:16:39.494 --> 02:16:39.914
For what?

02:16:40.314 --> 02:16:43.156
For the smash we're about to play.

02:16:43.216 --> 02:16:43.756
Smash?

02:16:43.896 --> 02:16:44.176
Yeah.

02:16:44.376 --> 02:16:44.956
Ooh.

02:16:45.016 --> 02:16:48.098
You got it at a pawn shop?

02:16:48.138 --> 02:16:48.378
Yeah.

02:16:48.718 --> 02:16:49.898
You got it at a pawn shop?

02:16:49.938 --> 02:16:50.218
Yeah.

02:16:50.378 --> 02:16:52.239
I just went and bought it.

02:16:52.359 --> 02:16:53.660
If I beat you, I get a chubby sandwich?

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:53.920
Yeah.

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:54.380
Oh yeah.

02:16:55.666 --> 02:16:58.207
If you beat me, I'll make you guys cookies.

02:16:58.247 --> 02:16:59.827
Oh, that's a great deal.

02:17:00.108 --> 02:17:00.828
That's a great deal.

02:17:02.208 --> 02:17:04.269
After all the meets go on, we like to just hang out.

02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:05.429
We goof around.

02:17:05.489 --> 02:17:06.610
We brought a Switch up here.

02:17:06.630 --> 02:17:09.011
We were playing Smash Bros all day, pretty much.

02:17:09.331 --> 02:17:10.191
Johnny's the best.

02:17:10.231 --> 02:17:11.672
He does play the most, too.

02:17:12.132 --> 02:17:14.213
He kind of no-lifed it for a little bit.

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:17.694
I'd say Lanez is probably second.

02:17:18.114 --> 02:17:18.654
I'm last.

02:17:18.694 --> 02:17:19.354
I'm terrible.

02:17:19.915 --> 02:17:20.695
I might get better.

02:17:20.715 --> 02:17:20.975
I don't know.

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.501
Why you standing up?

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.262
No, there's nothing standing up.

02:17:24.282 --> 02:17:27.265
There's nothing standing, man.

02:17:27.765 --> 02:17:28.886
Oh, let's go!

02:17:28.906 --> 02:17:30.047
What's happening?

02:17:30.988 --> 02:17:36.152
All you gotta do is take your mouth off.

02:17:36.173 --> 02:17:43.379
Johnny, don't hit me.

02:17:43.419 --> 02:17:44.359
Don't hit me.

02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:45.060
No!

02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.601
We got stuff on the line this game?

02:17:46.962 --> 02:17:47.822
Cookies and chocolate.

02:17:47.902 --> 02:17:49.564
Cookies and chocolate.

02:17:57.364 --> 02:18:00.287
Oh yeah, hit him.

02:18:00.307 --> 02:18:06.172
Why are you making cookies, Alvin?

02:18:07.273 --> 02:18:10.516
You know, Johnny pulled some real cheeky moves.

02:18:10.937 --> 02:18:16.181
I wouldn't say it's the most sportsmanlike thing I've ever seen, but I think I can beat him though.

02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:19.925
Maybe I was sandbagging a little bit because I love making cookies.

02:18:30.075 --> 02:18:31.536
I'm about to pull the beef ribs.

02:18:32.036 --> 02:18:34.138
I've been on since 8 a.m.

02:18:34.198 --> 02:18:44.305
What I do is I probe them, and if it feels like butter or cake batter, then I know they're pretty much done.

02:18:44.785 --> 02:18:46.546
I'd say they're my favorite meats.

02:18:46.847 --> 02:18:49.268
They're just so rich and so good.

02:18:49.609 --> 02:18:50.529
So good.

02:18:50.649 --> 02:18:51.970
Oh, my gosh.

02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:53.771
So I like briskets better.

02:18:53.791 --> 02:18:56.233
Isn't it hot over there?

02:18:56.253 --> 02:18:57.174
Yeah, it's pretty hot.

02:18:58.331 --> 02:19:02.474
That means that the fat is rendered, and these are just going to be so delicious because of that.

02:19:03.314 --> 02:19:05.736
All around, perfect beef ribs.

02:19:05.996 --> 02:19:09.138
I want to do a Homer impression.

02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:13.861
Chuck is our head pit master here.

02:19:13.881 --> 02:19:15.382
She's a really quick learner.

02:19:15.402 --> 02:19:18.164
She does finish the briskets and the beef ribs, too.

02:19:18.524 --> 02:19:21.446
So, I mean, that is the main attraction to the restaurant.

02:19:22.506 --> 02:19:26.329
Her shift is critical just because, like, it kind of comes down to that last pull.

02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:29.071
If you pull too early, it's going to be undercooked.

02:19:29.091 --> 02:19:30.152
That's when it's going to be tough.

02:19:30.372 --> 02:19:31.814
If you overcook it, it's going to be mushy.

02:19:31.834 --> 02:19:34.156
It's not going to have a good, like, mouthfeel.

02:19:34.276 --> 02:19:36.197
There's, like, a sweet spot right in between.

02:19:36.237 --> 02:19:37.919
So that's what we try to shoot for every day.

02:19:37.939 --> 02:19:40.201
I think they're beautiful.

02:19:40.561 --> 02:19:40.841
Yeah.

02:19:40.861 --> 02:19:41.141
Hi, Alvin.

02:19:41.281 --> 02:19:41.702
I love you, Alvin.

02:19:41.762 --> 02:19:47.246
I didn't know they could talk.

02:19:48.828 --> 02:19:50.249
Who said that?

02:19:51.073 --> 02:19:55.114
My job is basically controlling fire, so I love that.

02:19:55.134 --> 02:19:57.514
I mean, it's only getting higher.

02:19:57.614 --> 02:20:00.455
Right now it's at 133 and it keeps on going up.

02:20:00.535 --> 02:20:03.996
It'll get to 160, like just this area right here.

02:20:04.316 --> 02:20:05.236
Chuck, I'm sweating.

02:20:06.016 --> 02:20:08.096
It's a nice job.

02:20:14.118 --> 02:20:15.098
Alright, get some.

02:20:15.218 --> 02:20:16.038
Friday morning.

02:20:18.739 --> 02:20:20.399
This makes me really happy to watch.

02:20:25.543 --> 02:20:32.848
It's hard for me to think of a better way to share than to feed people.

02:20:32.868 --> 02:20:34.729
I mean, they're really lucky.

02:20:34.989 --> 02:20:35.990
I mean, that's crunch time.

02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:39.512
So that's when we got to start getting the restaurant ready for service.

02:20:44.887 --> 02:20:46.729
Everybody's pretty much everywhere in the restaurant.

02:20:46.929 --> 02:20:52.034
So Del, he'll start portioning banana puddings, like, in the actual dining room.

02:20:52.435 --> 02:20:55.297
We'll have stuff on, like, the cutting board that's not in the kitchen, too.

02:20:55.458 --> 02:21:00.723
So it's a little hectic, but now we got it down pretty much to a science where everybody knows what they got to do.

02:21:01.484 --> 02:21:04.146
It's a lot of stuff, but we knock it out pretty quickly.

02:21:05.908 --> 02:21:07.229
Have you tried one of the puddings already?

02:21:07.269 --> 02:21:08.631
No, I haven't tried any of them.

02:21:14.401 --> 02:21:15.402
That's pretty.

02:21:15.542 --> 02:21:24.686
I'm wrapping some turkeys up right now.

02:21:24.726 --> 02:21:31.609
Put a little bit of butter in there.

02:21:31.669 --> 02:21:32.649
A little bit?

02:21:32.669 --> 02:21:35.270
A little bit lighter on the butter.

02:21:44.997 --> 02:21:47.579
Yeah, these are pretty much done.

02:21:47.679 --> 02:21:50.201
He's wrapping up for the last bit of it.

02:21:50.481 --> 02:21:53.123
Most of the time you get smoked turkey, it's gotta be dry.

02:21:53.143 --> 02:21:55.624
We do not do that.

02:21:55.664 --> 02:21:57.125
Look at the size of that!

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:12.427
Usually people get here around six or seven, that's where we get our first couple customers.

02:22:12.908 --> 02:22:16.789
And it's always nice to see, like, you're like, all right, so we're gonna have some customers today.

02:22:16.829 --> 02:22:19.170
Like, right when we pull in, it's like, all right, I think it's gonna be a good one.

02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:20.930
How long have you guys been waiting for?

02:22:21.471 --> 02:22:24.372
We got here about five after seven.

02:22:24.632 --> 02:22:29.533
I definitely ate light yesterday, would have liked to have slept a little bit better.

02:22:29.934 --> 02:22:34.715
I didn't want to be so far back that we might miss out on something, you know, that gets sold out.

02:22:35.435 --> 02:22:36.236
Mission accomplished.

02:22:39.841 --> 02:22:41.061
How did you guys hear about this place?

02:22:42.462 --> 02:22:43.102
Texas Monthly.

02:22:43.122 --> 02:22:45.123
What's going on, guys?

02:22:45.543 --> 02:22:48.904
You would have only had to get here 45 minutes earlier to be first in line.

02:22:48.924 --> 02:22:50.144
We actually were before you.

02:22:50.204 --> 02:22:54.265
We just left to get coffee.

02:22:57.646 --> 02:23:01.487
After we got number one, I'd say half the line is maybe not even from Texas.

02:23:01.507 --> 02:23:03.328
We get a lot of people from out of state now.

02:23:04.172 --> 02:23:08.336
It's a good feeling that people are waking up this early, waiting in the line before we open up.

02:23:08.396 --> 02:23:12.640
I mean, we open up at 11, so people are waiting, you know, five hours before we open up.

02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:13.121
Jeez.

02:23:28.334 --> 02:23:34.906
Every morning, we'll cut ourselves an actual tray of our food, pretty much to see how we're doing, see if everything's, like, tasting right.

02:23:51.297 --> 02:23:53.018
What do you think, Blaine?

02:23:53.538 --> 02:23:54.478
It's good.

02:23:54.999 --> 02:23:58.440
I've only had brisket so far, and that's it.

02:23:58.660 --> 02:23:59.181
Made my day.

02:23:59.201 --> 02:24:01.181
Everything's spot on?

02:24:02.202 --> 02:24:03.863
Everything's tasting good.

02:24:03.883 --> 02:24:05.443
I think it's going to be a good day.

02:24:06.164 --> 02:24:06.264
No.

02:24:17.169 --> 02:24:20.590
Johnny, what do you think?

02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:21.771
Is that good?

02:24:22.711 --> 02:24:24.231
I think it's amazing.

02:24:24.771 --> 02:24:26.252
Do you want to give it to the customer?

02:24:26.632 --> 02:24:26.972
Oh, yeah.

02:24:27.552 --> 02:24:27.972
Oh, yeah.

02:24:36.595 --> 02:24:39.276
Right at 10.59 is when you got to get your game face on.

02:24:39.296 --> 02:24:40.216
That's when we're all ready.

02:24:40.236 --> 02:24:41.757
We're sitting behind the cutting board.

02:24:42.417 --> 02:24:45.678
And pretty much for the next four hours, we're going to be slammed with customers.

02:25:02.964 --> 02:25:04.545
I figured out a little extra four grams for ya.

02:25:04.765 --> 02:25:07.707
One and a half, half, half, 2.1B for an ounce.

02:25:07.727 --> 02:25:09.849
1.2B for an ounce!

02:25:09.989 --> 02:25:11.730
So your total today is $53.

02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:14.692
Alright man, you do this for years to go today.

02:25:14.912 --> 02:25:15.773
Ah, for here please.

02:25:16.909 --> 02:25:19.250
That first hour, that's the crazy hour, for sure.

02:25:19.570 --> 02:25:25.113
We try to move as fast as possible, because, I mean, it's 100 degrees out there, so you really got to be quick at this.

02:25:25.413 --> 02:25:27.614
When I'm super tired, I got, like, three hours of sleep.

02:25:27.694 --> 02:25:29.375
That line will literally get me going.

02:25:29.415 --> 02:25:31.976
Like, I can get through the day, like, especially when it's super busy.

02:25:31.996 --> 02:25:33.577
That's why I love it.

02:25:33.617 --> 02:25:35.738
You have a good day so far?

02:25:35.798 --> 02:25:36.539
All right.

02:25:36.599 --> 02:25:37.199
One beef rib.

02:25:37.539 --> 02:25:38.680
One beef rib!

02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:39.980
Half pound pork rib.

02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:42.421
I'm going to throw the sausage on the house, I'll lay off the trash.

02:25:42.442 --> 02:25:42.882
1.6 beef rib!

02:25:46.924 --> 02:25:48.965
Cheese grits or coleslaw?

02:25:49.045 --> 02:25:50.205
You said here to go?

02:25:50.485 --> 02:25:51.585
Pound, pound, half.

02:25:51.845 --> 02:25:52.525
Three smalls.

02:25:52.545 --> 02:25:54.426
Can you just sign the screen for me?

02:25:56.186 --> 02:26:03.688
In an hour, we go through, shoot, probably about 20 briskets, like 18 racks of ribs, maybe like five or six turkeys.

02:26:04.128 --> 02:26:09.889
We're in a good flow, too, where, I mean, it looks easy, but this is because we've done it so many times.

02:26:11.021 --> 02:26:12.281
We'll do little samples.

02:26:12.301 --> 02:26:13.102
We call them samples.

02:26:13.442 --> 02:26:14.422
They're burning.

02:26:14.722 --> 02:26:15.062
It's great.

02:26:15.082 --> 02:26:20.484
It's like the best part of the brisket, but we give those out for free pretty much to everybody in line.

02:26:20.504 --> 02:26:30.267
So that's kind of like a thanks for waiting in the line, and then also this is what you're about to eat.

02:26:30.467 --> 02:26:32.327
Three pounds of turkey, three brisket, three turkey.

02:26:32.427 --> 02:26:33.808
Any sausage?

02:26:34.048 --> 02:26:34.668
One sausage.

02:26:34.688 --> 02:26:35.828
Nice.

02:26:36.128 --> 02:26:37.269
Any sides?

02:26:38.269 --> 02:26:38.529
Yeah.

02:26:39.053 --> 02:26:42.294
For the first two hours, like, you know, it's a breeze.

02:26:42.314 --> 02:26:43.015
Like, I don't feel it.

02:26:43.195 --> 02:26:46.236
And then it's when it's, that third hour is when it kicks in.

02:26:46.256 --> 02:26:47.097
That's when it kicks in.

02:26:47.157 --> 02:26:49.077
I'm like, oh man, it's a little tiring.

02:26:49.297 --> 02:26:52.359
You got tallow going everywhere, you're slicing away.

02:26:52.379 --> 02:26:55.680
Especially like at that final hour is where I'm pretty dead.

02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:58.862
But, I mean, it's all worth it to see the customers happy, so.

02:26:58.882 --> 02:27:02.503
All right, you're all set, man.

02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:03.364
Thanks for coming out.

02:27:07.714 --> 02:27:08.815
Definitely worth the wait.

02:27:08.895 --> 02:27:12.537
I haven't tried everything, so the verdict's still out, but it's up there.

02:27:12.597 --> 02:27:13.897
Somebody's got a dishwasher.

02:27:13.937 --> 02:27:17.019
Gotta make sure everything's clean.

02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.951
Yeah, we're all filled out.

02:27:53.971 --> 02:27:55.111
Everything?

02:27:55.832 --> 02:27:56.372
Yes, ma'am.

02:27:56.872 --> 02:27:57.793
Everything.

02:27:58.673 --> 02:28:00.674
Yeah, we should have been here earlier.

02:28:00.794 --> 02:28:01.634
Yeah, sorry about that.

02:28:01.894 --> 02:28:04.315
We'll be open tomorrow and Sunday.

02:28:04.335 --> 02:28:05.195
Okay.

02:28:14.682 --> 02:28:17.223
After service stops, like, we're not done working.

02:28:17.243 --> 02:28:22.865
Like, we still, me, PJ, and Della up here cleaning up, and then, like, they're back there still on the pits.

02:28:29.927 --> 02:28:34.689
What I like so much is seeing everybody, like, super happy that we cooked something really good.

02:28:34.749 --> 02:28:38.290
It's great to hear people come back after eating and be like, this is the best barbecue I've ever had.

02:28:38.770 --> 02:28:42.571
I mean, that's probably the most satisfying part of it.

02:28:42.691 --> 02:28:44.172
I mean, that makes it worth it pretty much.

02:29:21.184 --> 02:29:22.665
We weren't trying to get number one.

02:29:22.685 --> 02:29:24.587
That's not why we opened up the barbecue restaurant.

02:29:26.388 --> 02:29:29.551
We pretty much was trying to cook the best barbecue we could.

02:29:31.633 --> 02:29:34.415
It was a really good feeling, though, to see that we got rewarded.

02:29:34.735 --> 02:29:35.916
Like, our hard work paid off.

02:29:35.976 --> 02:29:41.101
What's for you after Goldie's?

02:29:41.121 --> 02:29:44.584
Are you going to keep working here, or what's the plan?

02:29:44.604 --> 02:29:46.745
I mean, they would want me to stay here, but...

02:29:48.686 --> 02:29:59.309
Now she's really good at it, but remember the guy said that he taught her right so they taught her and

02:30:16.912 --> 02:30:24.098
These elementary school friends that all worked at different barbecue places that got together to do their own barbecue, they taught Chuck.

02:30:24.178 --> 02:30:32.405
And now Chuck is going to go on to start her own barbecue based on all the experience that she got from these lifelong friends.

02:30:32.465 --> 02:30:38.210
Think about the powerful nature of that friendship and the beauty that it creates on a daily basis.

02:30:49.704 --> 02:30:51.807
A lot of people do think what we do is easy.

02:30:51.987 --> 02:30:53.769
I know I used to think it was easy.

02:30:56.693 --> 02:30:59.357
But, I mean, we're going to have this title for the next four years.

02:30:59.377 --> 02:31:00.258
We're going to keep this up.

02:31:21.561 --> 02:31:28.133
I've been on the rescue ship for about six months now and I'm still really happy with what I get to do.

02:31:47.856 --> 02:31:50.577
I'm very thankful that I get the chance to do this.

02:31:51.057 --> 02:31:55.278
I'm very thankful for my friend Dan Cohen and for my friend Mark Kulak.

02:31:56.799 --> 02:32:16.585
I'm very thankful that with the help of Mark, I've been able to get to a better understanding of biology and how a weird sort of pseudobiology has been used and implemented and agreed upon by a bunch of people on a national security script that have basically brought us to believe that racism and COVID

02:32:17.375 --> 02:32:20.542
have gone endemic in America in the West, and we have to fix that.

02:32:20.662 --> 02:32:27.495
But in reality, biology tells us that endemicity is a myth, especially with regard to an RNA molecule.

02:32:28.592 --> 02:32:31.254
I think it was just a background that they lied about, ladies and gentlemen.

02:32:31.795 --> 02:32:32.575
I love you very much.

02:32:32.655 --> 02:32:34.777
Thanks for joining me again for the evening show.

02:32:34.877 --> 02:32:36.078
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:32:36.118 --> 02:32:37.339
It is for all the marbles.

02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:41.123
Don't take the red hat team seriously.

02:32:41.203 --> 02:32:43.204
Don't take the blue hat team seriously.

02:32:43.705 --> 02:32:46.127
Understand that there's a very succinct way to say things.

02:32:46.187 --> 02:32:47.448
Dan Cohen's on his way.

02:32:47.948 --> 02:32:50.170
Mark's very, very far along this.

02:32:50.411 --> 02:32:52.893
I'm a long ways on this road.

02:32:53.473 --> 02:33:02.280
And we're all trying to understand exactly how our legs are trapped in the jaws of this awful apparatus called social media.

02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.021
Let's get our kids out, ladies and gentlemen.

02:33:04.482 --> 02:33:05.883
One of the ways out is PeerTube.

02:33:06.323 --> 02:33:10.066
Thanks very much for considering downloading the app and following me there.

02:33:10.586 --> 02:33:15.670
This has been GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:17.812
And like I said, it's not rockin' science.

02:33:17.852 --> 02:33:19.253
I will see you again tomorrow.

02:33:19.773 --> 02:33:20.734
Thanks for being here.

02:33:21.234 --> 02:33:23.296
I guess I can try and do something like this.

02:33:23.496 --> 02:33:25.801
I can play that out.

02:33:26.242 --> 02:33:26.804
Thanks again.

02:33:27.265 --> 02:33:28.207
Sorry for the goofy hat.
