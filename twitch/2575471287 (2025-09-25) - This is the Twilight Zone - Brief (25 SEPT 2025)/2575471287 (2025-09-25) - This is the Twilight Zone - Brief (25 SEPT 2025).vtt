WEBVTT

00:00.236 --> 00:00.799
bzzzzzzz

02:20.215 --> 02:21.076
Good morning, everybody.

02:21.116 --> 02:21.937
Welcome to the show.

02:22.017 --> 02:28.343
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:29.644 --> 02:40.735
I'm gonna try and fool around with this for a minute here, and maybe get this just a little bit smaller, and therefore it can be higher in a way.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.418
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.519
Sorry it's taken me so long to get back online.

02:46.539 --> 02:54.983
I've been fooling around with some functionality like this, but also just kind of trying to make it more interesting for me and more positive for me as an experience.

02:55.523 --> 03:02.046
I'm trying to take things to a different direction and a different level to try and make my points in a different, more positive way.

03:02.166 --> 03:08.889
And part of that was that barbecue show that I did yesterday or the day before or the day before that.

03:09.870 --> 03:14.034
which I ended with a barbecue that was from Texas.

03:15.275 --> 03:18.638
And it was formed by three guys who went to elementary school together.

03:18.678 --> 03:21.941
And so the overarching message was about friendship.

03:22.862 --> 03:26.826
Today, I'd also like to keep that message alive about friendship.

03:27.446 --> 03:31.169
staying focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media.

03:32.230 --> 03:38.696
I really hope that today my program can be quick and less than two hours so that I can get out of here for the gym.

03:39.677 --> 03:43.820
Jimmy Kimmel revisited, then we're gonna just tie it up with the Goldie thing.

03:44.941 --> 03:51.167
And then a little bit of a guess who and when, which I think is kind of fun to always remind people where we are in the timeline.

03:51.767 --> 03:55.549
And then finally a little segment that I'd like to call Ian Carroll Admits It.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.932
And then we'll see if we can close it out.

03:59.012 --> 04:00.733
So again, thanks for being here.

04:00.753 --> 04:02.754
I will see you again soon.

04:02.794 --> 04:09.618
Let me see if I can transition through all of these different thingamabobbers here.

04:13.040 --> 04:13.721
Does this work?

04:14.181 --> 04:14.441
Yes.

04:14.901 --> 04:18.123
And then that should... No, that did not work.

04:18.864 --> 04:20.205
Because I clicked over here.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.227
That should be, aha, there it is.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.029
I think truth is good for kids.

04:47.450 --> 04:51.215
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

04:51.755 --> 04:53.998
We want everybody to feel good.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.681
That's not the way life is.

05:06.462 --> 05:25.283
thing but you can tell if someone's lying you know you can sort of feel it people fifty thousand dollars he says that's hilarious you know um that is absolutely funny two of these monitors came out of the garbage can of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine when they claimed the room was damaged by water

05:26.244 --> 05:51.785
um wow what a funny thing 50 don't take it 50 000 don't take it don't take it don't use tylenol don't take tylenol don't take tylenol fight like hell not to take it i think you shouldn't take it don't take tylenol the baby goes gets a shot they say here take your cup of title i've heard that for years take tylenol don't take tylenol don't have your baby take tylenol don't give tylenol

05:52.904 --> 05:53.604
to the baby.

05:53.864 --> 05:55.725
Don't give Tylenol to the baby.

05:55.965 --> 05:57.625
Don't give your baby Tylenol.

05:57.965 --> 05:59.266
Don't take Tylenol.

05:59.566 --> 06:01.727
Don't take Tylenol.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.487
Don't take Tylenol.

06:04.787 --> 06:05.428
Don't take it.

06:05.668 --> 06:06.328
Don't take it.

06:07.028 --> 06:09.189
So that's it.

06:09.209 --> 06:11.269
There's nothing much to say.

06:11.629 --> 06:13.170
Don't take Tylenol.

06:13.190 --> 06:13.970
Just don't take it.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.331
And I just say it again.

06:16.571 --> 06:19.052
Don't take Tylenol.

06:19.452 --> 06:20.012
Don't take it.

06:27.250 --> 06:34.692
But none of that compared to the headache he is creating with his buddy RFK, blaming autism on Tylenol.

06:35.372 --> 06:37.532
His press conference yesterday was an all-timer.

06:37.872 --> 06:44.814
Trump, Bobby Brainworm, and Dr. Oz strongly recommend that pregnant women stop taking Tylenol immediately.

06:45.174 --> 06:48.494
And the president was very persuasive making his case.

06:48.874 --> 06:53.355
When the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let's do it now.

06:53.415 --> 06:55.756
I was just saying to Bobby and the group, let's do it now.

06:56.835 --> 06:58.057
Nothing bad can happen.

06:58.197 --> 06:59.378
It can only good happen.

07:00.299 --> 07:01.901
But with Tylenol, don't take it.

07:02.522 --> 07:03.222
Don't take it.

07:04.143 --> 07:04.664
That's right.

07:04.784 --> 07:06.466
Follow the advice of Donald Trump.

07:06.846 --> 07:10.230
And you, too, can look like a glazed ham with deep vein thrombosis.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.312
It can only good happen.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.542
The End

07:39.666 --> 07:47.569
Tonight, MERS, SARS, bird flu, mutating superbugs are threatening to wipe out mankind.

07:47.749 --> 07:49.170
Do we think we rule the planet?

07:49.470 --> 07:49.650
No.

07:49.990 --> 07:50.750
They rule the planet.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.311
Their attack is always vicious.

07:53.511 --> 07:55.952
The majority of the exposed people will die.

07:56.312 --> 08:00.334
It could lead to a viral armageddon, a bio-pocalypse.

08:00.754 --> 08:06.836
If you've got the lab, if you've got the scientists necessary, effectively, you could come up with a zombie-type virus.

08:07.877 --> 08:08.037
Whoa.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.902
And it could be your next door neighbor who starts it all.

08:11.922 --> 08:15.405
You need a table and a sink, and that's a laboratory.

08:15.785 --> 08:19.848
Once the biopocalypse strikes, we may not know what hit us.

08:20.049 --> 08:21.570
What the hell is that?

08:21.950 --> 08:23.372
Until it's too late.

08:23.392 --> 08:25.994
You're going to have a huge death toll before you ever catch up with it.

08:48.755 --> 08:50.416
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

08:50.476 --> 08:56.918
Again, this is Giga Home Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:57.018 --> 08:59.039
I'm coming to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.079
Did I say that already?

09:00.860 --> 09:03.040
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.441
RNA cannot pandemic.

09:05.021 --> 09:09.144
Transfection is a crime and autism is definitely a myth.

09:10.265 --> 09:14.127
It is really extraordinary where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.970
I can't stress enough how the trap door is closing.

09:18.370 --> 09:26.275
You gotta get off social media because if you're there using it skillfully, you are following people that are working against you.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.497
There's no other way to say it.

09:28.937 --> 09:34.321
It's just not a safe place for us and it's definitely not a safe place for our grandchildren.

09:35.802 --> 09:38.864
You gotta understand why the cheese is free on social media.

09:38.924 --> 09:43.987
You gotta understand why the cheese was free during the pandemic.

09:44.908 --> 09:50.431
The reason why the cheese was free during the pandemic is the exact biology they want you to ignore.

09:50.932 --> 09:54.374
Because they are all one cast on one script.

09:54.934 --> 10:02.279
And that's why yelling at the stage or tweeting at the stage or posting things on Facebook doesn't change what they do.

10:02.299 --> 10:04.521
Because that's not how theater works.

10:05.181 --> 10:10.647
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm trying to make or be a contributor to making America real again.

10:10.667 --> 10:21.497
An independent bright web that doesn't use or rely on Rumble or YouTube or Spotify or anything like that, but we just have a website and you can download things.

10:22.658 --> 10:24.320
I'm really excited about this.

10:24.340 --> 10:34.813
I'm really excited about the fact that we have a nice way for people to start training to challenge themselves to understand why intramuscular injection can never be questioned as a methodology.

10:34.853 --> 10:40.159
Virology can never be questioned as a science and public health can never be questioned as a reason.

10:40.199 --> 10:41.260
Those are the things that

10:41.901 --> 10:44.363
All of these narratives prevent us from doing.

10:44.784 --> 10:52.591
And instead of arguing about or discussing these things, we'll argue about pandemics or autism or any other myths that they put in front of us.

10:53.672 --> 10:58.916
And again, it's about the biology that they ignore, the biologists they ignore, the ideas they've ignored.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.679
And if you want to know the truth, you got to start there.

11:02.719 --> 11:05.122
You got to start with the stuff they're not talking about.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.604
I think that's really the way forward.

11:07.644 --> 11:08.304
That's the way

11:09.425 --> 11:29.924
That we all figure this out that we all get there I Gotta I gotta say the most important thing the most important thing is to show your children the truth It's really most important to show your children the truth that

11:31.401 --> 11:35.666
We need to apologize to our children for having fallen for this for so long.

11:36.127 --> 11:45.457
Having gone along with it for so long that Nancy Pelosi has an unbridled 25-year-plus career in Congress.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.721
We went along with this because the cheese was free.

11:49.562 --> 12:09.088
for a lot of people, and those people encouraged us to go along with it, pretended that what they were doing was helping us, when in reality, they were just helping with the controlled demolition of America, like all the other ones on television and on social media.

12:10.168 --> 12:11.349
Show your children the truth.

12:11.409 --> 12:15.090
The only reason why we fell for it is because of social media.

12:17.310 --> 12:26.035
America needs to stay focused on the biology, America needs to stop taking the bait on social media, and America needs to start getting to know their neighbors again.

12:27.035 --> 12:31.778
And regardless of what side of this little goofball show you're on,

12:32.498 --> 12:34.779
you need to come to the realization that you've been fooled.

12:34.839 --> 12:38.682
Because you still probably think, you know, oh, I saw through Donald Trump.

12:38.702 --> 12:41.524
But you still think Donald Trump is an independent actor.

12:41.884 --> 12:44.866
Oh, I saw through... I saw through Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:44.926 --> 12:46.166
I knew that he was a goofball.

12:47.187 --> 12:59.354
But then you still think that he's an independent actor doing things despite what most intelligent people and most technocrats in America, most leaders of corporations want him to do.

12:59.855 --> 13:01.636
And that would be just preposterous.

13:02.276 --> 13:03.357
Don't take Tylenol.

13:03.898 --> 13:04.738
Don't take it.

13:04.758 --> 13:06.240
With Tylenol, don't take it.

13:06.840 --> 13:07.381
Don't take it.

13:07.401 --> 13:08.281
That would just be preposterous.

13:08.301 --> 13:09.042
Don't use Tylenol.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.403
Don't take Tylenol.

13:10.463 --> 13:12.045
Don't take Tylenol.

13:12.285 --> 13:13.846
Fight like hell not to take it.

13:14.046 --> 13:15.147
I think you shouldn't take it.

13:15.268 --> 13:16.469
Don't take Tylenol.

13:16.669 --> 13:18.010
The baby goes, gets a shot.

13:18.050 --> 13:20.112
They say, here, take a couple of Tylenol.

13:20.212 --> 13:21.133
I've heard that for years.

13:21.193 --> 13:21.913
Take Tylenol.

13:23.455 --> 13:26.277
This is all the same show, ladies and gentlemen.

13:26.397 --> 13:33.862
All these organizations, all these people are all infused with national security actors.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.043
It sucks.

13:35.623 --> 13:36.724
It really does suck.

13:37.204 --> 13:38.285
But that's the way it is.

13:39.566 --> 13:48.993
And the more you come to understand it as such, the more you will see that fighting on social media is exactly what they want.

13:50.632 --> 13:56.899
Because on social media, they can create any illusion they want to, including the illusion of the truth getting out.

13:57.319 --> 14:04.967
They can also create the illusion that this is like a 50-50 divide in the United States, just like the last election was, you know?

14:05.428 --> 14:08.291
And the truth is out in 50% of the people.

14:08.351 --> 14:12.015
But if you thought that, if you think that, you would be wrong.

14:15.137 --> 14:32.830
Ladies and gentlemen, please download the PeerTube app and explore the possibility of using an app that doesn't take your data, and using an app that allows you to view GigaOM Biological without using your data, and more importantly, using the website that I pay for.

14:34.343 --> 14:49.186
There's also a feed of Mark Kulak's latest stuff that shows up on the same Peertube app because right now Mark helps to pay for that stream.gigaohm.bio and I host, or we host, some of his videos there.

14:49.266 --> 14:51.346
That's the current status.

14:51.406 --> 14:57.367
The new status soon will be, you know, stream.housatonic.history or something like that.

14:57.947 --> 15:00.088
And then on the Peertube app you'll just have two

15:01.451 --> 15:07.768
Peertube platforms that you follow, one with a big G and an ohm symbol and one with an H.

15:08.703 --> 15:15.966
And that's the way forward because then we can also get one for the Liberty Perspective or, you know, Dan could make one for example.

15:15.986 --> 15:21.627
And then you would choose what you put on your phone and what you follow and what shows up.

15:22.468 --> 15:28.110
And more importantly, you would never ever ever get served something else by the algorithm.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.430
You'd never get served up something with...

15:32.171 --> 15:47.115
i don't know um like russell brand's face you know you would never get served up anything like that uh thank you for joining me thank you for being here we're still trying to figure out what in the hell happened in 2020 during this black swan event

15:49.736 --> 15:50.656
or whatever they call them.

15:51.877 --> 16:02.601
And I'm still trying to figure that out because basically my academic career hit a rock and a hard place at very high velocity around 2020.

16:03.341 --> 16:16.867
And ever since then, I've been trying to find Americans and international actors on social media that would try to help get the truth out about what happened here or what didn't happen here.

16:17.347 --> 16:25.649
And the remarkable thing is, I think my voice is just, there we go, testing, test, test, test, test, test, test.

16:26.709 --> 16:31.610
We are really in a weird situation because it doesn't seem like very many people are interested in that anymore.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.151
And it might only be because that's by design.

16:34.191 --> 16:35.311
So I want to get going quick.

16:36.451 --> 16:39.012
I don't know how well I'm going to be able to do this show.

16:39.052 --> 16:40.212
I might have to repeat it again.

16:40.822 --> 16:58.025
but like i said i just want to remind everybody you know it's been a long time it's six years we're in the sixth year um it's ugly because one half of our country supposedly if you look at social media and you follow people on social media or podcasts on social media it is likely

16:58.786 --> 17:04.430
that you have come to the conclusion or come to, you know, one of two set points.

17:04.490 --> 17:26.624
And this could be true from the perspective of Germans, Australians, New Zealanders, English people, you know, people from the UK in general, people from Scandinavia, all may more or less sort into this, you know, money and power and drugs and women and blackmail

17:27.811 --> 17:32.954
are used to control governments of the world and therefore all of humanity.

17:32.995 --> 17:36.777
And so the elite pedophiles are at the heart of this.

17:37.137 --> 17:42.941
And if you go to Dutch conspiracy websites or German conspiracy websites, you'll find the same thing.

17:43.001 --> 17:48.465
I'm not saying that everybody does that, but I have and do, and I know what's there and it's the same shit.

17:48.985 --> 18:06.034
It's, this is about the grandchildren of earth because the pedophiles, because of the bankers, because of the Venetians, because of, we must support Trump because he's like the other, you know, populist right movements, the Christian right movements.

18:06.074 --> 18:12.377
They're all around the world right now, supposedly, but I would suggest that they only really exist on the internet.

18:13.820 --> 18:18.223
And so on one side of the coin again, Trump is not an elite pedophile.

18:18.323 --> 18:27.549
COVID was definitely real and vaccines can work, but they sure didn't work this time with this new stuff because there's a DNA contamination.

18:27.609 --> 18:30.992
Now on the other side of the aisle, humans are already a plague.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.072
There's too many of us.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.694
We've been busy with population control for a while.

18:35.114 --> 18:40.298
And COVID was probably just a way for them to depopulate us more because this is about the grandchildren of earth.

18:40.718 --> 18:45.582
And Trump is the accumulation of everything wrong with the world and certainly everything wrong with America.

18:46.062 --> 18:51.386
It shows how ridiculous the American system is if such a jackass can get elected.

18:51.786 --> 18:55.089
It shows you how broken the American populace is.

18:55.129 --> 19:00.933
And that's what probably a lot of people think in the greater Western world, like in Australia and New Zealand.

19:00.953 --> 19:02.214
They think we're just retarded.

19:02.694 --> 19:05.875
and certainly in the Netherlands they think that.

19:05.915 --> 19:08.956
I know that from personal family conversations.

19:09.416 --> 19:13.398
So Trump is indeed an elite pedophile even if he didn't go to the island for a long time.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.539
COVID was real and vaccines definitely work and questioning them can kill people.

19:21.240 --> 19:44.903
And of course, what I'm suggesting, the main overarching message here is that the American public is governed by national security actors, American public, and therefore the American culture in general, and every vibe and image and song that it sends around the world is actively controlled by the national security state.

19:45.851 --> 19:57.963
and citizens are actively divided on false premises so that the things that are really going on behind the scenes can go on behind the scenes without us really having any effective scrutiny on those things.

19:58.844 --> 20:06.171
The pandemic was the accumulation of a long con, and the reason why this long con had to happen

20:07.000 --> 20:21.842
is because somewhere between 1950-odd, something like that, and now, there was a collective realization by the National Security State that a few genomes was not going to work.

20:25.069 --> 20:43.277
that the genome and inheritance and heredity and the regulation of the pattern integrity of life over time and the existence of each pattern integrity is not going to be cracked with the simple model of bacteria and bacteriophages.

20:45.018 --> 20:51.161
And if it was cracked, it was cracked in a way that revealed that the human version of heredity

20:52.310 --> 20:57.054
and temporal regulation of the pattern integrity across time was going to be an uncrackable nugget.

20:57.734 --> 21:05.060
Because as they understood it, the genetic code would never be capable of encoding that kind of density of information.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.202
And certainly, at least we would have no idea how that would happen.

21:09.143 --> 21:13.026
And so the central dogma became questioned.

21:13.046 --> 21:20.832
And also at the same time, people like Joshua Lederberg came to realize that one of the only ways this was going to work was when we had the computers

21:22.113 --> 21:31.284
with the capability of storing a genome, never mind hundreds or thousands of genomes, in a format

21:33.001 --> 21:35.722
that was interfaceable with a computer.

21:35.782 --> 21:59.126
And even then, I don't think Joshua Lederberg understood that simple neuronal networks modeled virtually would be able to start to provide a rudimentary way that algorithms or machine learning could learn and store and crack codes for visual identification of shapes and this kind of thing.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.687
And so it really became enticing to think

22:02.267 --> 22:06.291
that all we had to do was keep building these algorithms and we would get better and better at it.

22:06.331 --> 22:07.593
We'd have more and more insight.

22:08.373 --> 22:17.283
And more importantly, we needed to build the computers necessary because it was just like a, you know, in theory, you can build a computer big enough to do the job.

22:19.349 --> 22:20.830
And that's what they're doing right now.

22:20.970 --> 22:32.856
And don't underestimate the amount of infrastructure that exists for the videos and for the Netflix and for the Paramount Plus and for the Disney Plus.

22:33.437 --> 22:44.403
It's all really just technology developed under that false pretenses when in reality, the speed of that data transfer, the size and the management of those,

22:45.123 --> 22:57.828
those size of data sets and that size of data farm is all something they needed to learn in order to crack this problem that they probably identified already 20 years ago when they announced the Human Genome Project DUN.

22:59.449 --> 23:05.851
And so all the people that were there when the Human Genome Project was announced DUN are essentially involved in this.

23:06.591 --> 23:12.934
They have to be because it was at that time that they had to put people or start putting people in place

23:15.563 --> 23:29.704
to be ready for this shift when the technology was available the infrastructure was available for the first test run and included in that whole long con was SARS-1 and MERS

23:32.987 --> 23:50.272
and the debates about these things on 60 Minutes with Peter Daszak, but also all of the movies that start with some kind of contagion two-minute intro, like Planet of the Apes or the movies about contagion, like World War Z and such.

23:53.453 --> 23:54.733
And so the whole

23:56.007 --> 24:23.705
The whole farm is being bet on the idea that future computers and future data centers and future machine learning algorithms will be provided the necessary density of data of human genomes and medical data and whatever else is possible so that they can make meaningful progress in understanding exactly what is coded in the chromosomes and DNA that we don't already understand because it was low-hanging fruit.

24:24.725 --> 24:25.446
That's the trick.

24:28.106 --> 24:34.311
And so this DNA making evolution real has to be unlearned.

24:35.091 --> 24:47.400
And yet my son is in freshman biology in high school, and one of the units that's coming is the central dogma, DNA to RNA to protein.

24:49.420 --> 24:58.165
And so the assumption is, is that all the meaningful understanding that we need could be achieved if we just understood this one part right here.

24:58.705 --> 25:02.147
And since it's right there, we should be able to understand it.

25:02.167 --> 25:07.370
But we have to see is that between about 1940 and 1960 or 70, they realized that that wasn't going to happen.

25:15.848 --> 25:20.209
And it wasn't until 1983, ooh, what the hell happened there?

25:20.969 --> 25:38.995
It wasn't until 1983 that they started having meetings about coronaviruses and trying to really push this narrative that there were animal viruses that were equivalent to bacterial viruses and we could just ignore the bacteria and the bacterial viruses and study these guys.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.236
And David Baltimore was involved in that transition.

25:45.302 --> 26:02.976
getting a Nobel Prize for finding one of those enzymes, and then being sort of given almost biological sainthood by calling the whole map of all these special enzymes that go against the central dogma being exclusive purview of viruses.

26:03.056 --> 26:07.539
And since he got the Nobel Prize for that, how are we going to argue with him?

26:07.559 --> 26:14.105
And of course, that Nobel Prize also supports the illusionary mechanism of HIV and AIDS.

26:15.086 --> 26:40.268
It supports the illusionary mechanism of XMRV or any of these other stories that these people from this all the same cast, Fauci, Mickiewicz, Gallo, you know, it's all around that transition where we weren't gonna figure out the laws of the biological universe like we thought we were.

26:41.141 --> 26:48.726
Like when Max Delbruck was having all of these things at Cold Spring Harbor and the phage group was meeting, and that's this book.

26:50.588 --> 27:03.177
They all thought that investigating bacteria and their phages was going to crack the code of how life works.

27:04.193 --> 27:08.375
they did some damn elegant experiments and they didn't figure it out at all.

27:08.835 --> 27:19.639
And in fact that was one of Max Delbruck's, you know, I don't think he was ever very happy about how they didn't make any progress in that regard.

27:19.679 --> 27:23.221
I think there are other people who would probably, if they were honest, be very

27:24.970 --> 27:28.233
admit very much that that's what was happening at that time.

27:28.694 --> 27:41.586
And then instead you have these go-getters like David Baltimore emerging from this same time and remaining grandfathers of virology all, I think, just using recombinant DNA and RNA to pretend.

27:43.493 --> 28:03.332
It's a bold statement to make, but I think that's why this same false narrative governed by national security actors put people like Andrew Kauffman and Tom Cowan and the Baileys and Alex Zeck out there for the last five years, because those people are on a narrative where

28:05.222 --> 28:16.720
the reasons behind, the nuance behind what was done in order to misconstrue a background as having, you know, really a lot to do with us and nothing to do with bacteria.

28:18.405 --> 28:24.651
over the course of 20 years and instead there's no virus without ever getting any more complicated or nuanced than that.

28:24.691 --> 28:41.347
Those people are some very malevolent actors that now have a website together and charge for telemed visits just like Pierre Cory does, just like Peter McCullough does, just like Mary Talley Bowden does.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.882
It's all the same kind of fraud.

28:44.942 --> 28:59.536
And it goes back all the way to when, again, the greatest physicists in the world decided that it was time to go into biology and see if the last remaining laws of creation could be discerned.

28:59.597 --> 29:00.918
And they were the ones to do it.

29:00.978 --> 29:01.979
And they failed.

29:04.401 --> 29:05.102
They failed.

29:06.618 --> 29:13.261
And instead, our national security state then started telling us stories about animal viruses and human viruses.

29:13.322 --> 29:17.424
And that illusion is what is here.

29:18.044 --> 29:19.985
And so it's not that there are no signals.

29:20.065 --> 29:22.626
It's not that PCR doesn't work or works.

29:23.207 --> 29:25.228
It's that an entire background

29:25.868 --> 29:40.540
of genetic signaling and noise, which might be the very basis for our existence, has been misconstrued as a background of pathogenic signals that we really don't understand because Nathan Wolf hasn't finished his work yet.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.683
And Peter Daszak is still just trying to scratch the surface.

29:52.216 --> 29:54.580
And so it's been murder and lies.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.603
It's about population pyramids.

29:57.163 --> 30:01.289
It's a fake health freedom movement that was put in place by a military exercise.

30:02.677 --> 30:18.583
And so that's why they want you to think that the shot is a military exercise or something like that, instead of just realizing that the whole messaging campaign, the whole illusion of consensus about the virus and the spread and the sickness was created.

30:18.663 --> 30:21.103
That's what they really needed the military for.

30:21.744 --> 30:24.965
And that's why all these ridiculous actors are in front of us.

30:25.885 --> 30:32.029
all the way down to the guy who does Anduril and the autonomous missiles and stuff.

30:33.190 --> 30:40.275
That guy is a super clown, just like Elon Musk is, just like Peter Thiel is, just like Jeff Bezos is.

30:40.315 --> 30:41.676
These are not real people.

30:42.236 --> 30:55.565
These are characters that were inserted into the narrative and made to seem like impossibly successful, mostly so that the rest of America would think that that kind of success wasn't attainable for me because I got to go to work tomorrow.

30:57.461 --> 31:03.045
And all of this can be dispelled based on the biology that these people simply won't talk about.

31:04.466 --> 31:19.516
And I'm very, very excited to say that I don't think anybody else on Earth has a program where they've gotten this close to saying these things correctly, like intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s, like transfection of healthy humans is a crime.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.007
Like, RNA cannot pandemic.

31:26.107 --> 31:28.249
Like, autism is a meaningless word by design.

31:28.289 --> 31:31.132
And like, a man who thinks he's a woman is not normal.

31:31.172 --> 31:39.899
Like, the cosmetic transformation, regardless of specific details, results in a transitioning or trans man.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.361
And now this, it's just, it's just, it's done.

31:43.742 --> 31:51.409
So yes, social media has made you believe that you can tweet the right thing and the Star Trek episode will change, but that's not true.

31:52.628 --> 31:55.689
Breaking news on Jimmy Kimmel and autism.

31:56.169 --> 31:59.010
Jimmy Kimmel coming back to late night television.

31:59.170 --> 32:02.231
ABC chose to bring back their low rating nighttime host.

32:02.331 --> 32:07.433
We are in for a monologue that will be a marker in late night show history.

32:07.653 --> 32:08.514
It's going to be a moment.

32:09.194 --> 32:10.254
Yeah, no question.

32:10.274 --> 32:11.895
A huge moment in American history.

32:11.955 --> 32:14.756
It's one of the most pivotal moments in broadcast history.

32:14.816 --> 32:20.598
He will be delivering what is being dubbed the most anticipated monologue in late night in years.

32:25.679 --> 32:27.921
So see what they're admitting here.

32:28.021 --> 32:30.563
First of all, this is completely scripted.

32:32.304 --> 32:37.908
All of the news channels saying that this is gonna be the monologue that everybody remembers, it was scripted.

32:39.049 --> 32:43.593
Just like them throwing him off the air was scripted.

32:45.174 --> 33:01.339
And now listen to who he mentions, how he mentions them, what he says, and understand that this man, first and foremost, is an actor who's willing to get into a fat... What is that?

33:01.359 --> 33:02.239
A rodent suit?

33:02.800 --> 33:03.540
A mouse suit?

33:06.321 --> 33:07.121
He's an actor.

33:07.721 --> 33:09.902
First and foremost, he's an actor.

33:14.787 --> 33:18.050
From Hollywood, it's Jimmy Kimmel Live.

33:18.830 --> 33:26.056
Tonight, Glenn Power and music from Sarah McLachlan with Cleto and the Cletones.

33:27.097 --> 33:30.240
And now, Jimmy Kimmel Live.

34:21.246 --> 34:22.867
I'm glad somebody tweeted that.

34:22.887 --> 34:30.233
Uhhh, b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-

34:48.467 --> 34:52.288
The rest want Trump out and Bobby out, and it's not 50-50.

34:53.609 --> 34:58.170
Even if in your little neighborhood it's 50-50, understand it's much worse than that.

34:58.690 --> 35:03.592
And I don't think that this can be a message that will hurt us if I'm wrong, but if we're

35:04.716 --> 35:13.279
If you're wrong about what you're assuming is 50-50, and in fact it's only like 90-10 or 80-20, we're in big trouble.

35:13.599 --> 35:20.621
Very, very big trouble should the rhetoric on social media and in mainstream media change after the midterms.

35:20.702 --> 35:24.403
And make no mistake about it, that's one of the things I expect to happen.

35:37.230 --> 35:37.630
Thank you.

35:37.690 --> 35:38.311
Thank you.

35:39.751 --> 35:52.419
Anyway, as I was saying before I was interrupted, if you're just joining us, we are preempting your regularly scheduled encore episode of Celebrity Family Feud to bring you this special report.

35:52.779 --> 35:54.800
I'm happy to be here tonight with you.

36:02.245 --> 36:02.625
I am not...

36:16.929 --> 36:17.770
Please be seated.

36:19.753 --> 36:24.259
I'm not sure who had a weirder 48 hours, me or the CEO of Tylenol.

36:26.723 --> 36:27.684
It's been overwhelming.

36:27.724 --> 36:29.987
I've heard from a lot of people over the last six days.

36:30.428 --> 36:30.849
I've heard from...

36:31.670 --> 36:38.631
Now I will agree with Reginald there, they are overdoing it, but what happens when they, there's Reginald there, way overdoing it.

36:38.671 --> 36:40.852
What happens, how is that happening?

36:40.932 --> 36:50.714
Anybody that's been in a studio like this knows that very specifically there's a freaking stage manager, maybe more than one, that can go like this and then go like that.

36:51.414 --> 36:54.115
And so this is all just ridiculousness, right?

36:54.155 --> 36:55.755
Of course it is, and that's a good point.

36:58.576 --> 37:01.220
all the people in the world over the last six days.

37:01.340 --> 37:04.805
Everyone I have ever met has reached out 10 or 11 times.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.969
Weird characters from my past are emailing.

37:08.009 --> 37:14.238
The guy who fired me from my first radio job in Seattle, where we are not airing tonight, by the way.

37:14.298 --> 37:15.199
Sorry, Seattle.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.761
His name is Larry.

37:17.941 --> 37:25.025
In 1989, Larry tried to force me to do a bit called Jokes for Donuts, where people would call in with a joke, and I would give them donuts.

37:25.505 --> 37:29.287
I refused to do it, and then I made a lot of fun of Larry for suggesting it.

37:29.307 --> 37:32.989
And eventually, Larry fired me, and I had to move back in with my parents.

37:33.069 --> 37:35.770
But even he wrote in to cheer me up.

37:35.870 --> 37:36.751
Thank you, Larry.

37:36.851 --> 37:38.552
And I want to thank everyone who checked in.

37:38.572 --> 37:42.814
It was a long week to list all of them.

37:44.485 --> 37:50.607
Some that I do especially want to mention are my fellow late night talk show hosts, my friend Stephen Colbert.

37:53.668 --> 37:55.928
He's found himself in this predicament.

37:56.308 --> 38:06.971
My friends Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon, John Oliver, Conan O'Brien, James Corden, Arsenio, Kathy, Wanda, Chelsea, even Jay reached out.

38:07.532 --> 38:08.652
Did he say Kathy?

38:09.884 --> 38:11.105
I think he said Kathy.

38:28.996 --> 38:41.105
My boyhood idols, Howard Stern and David Letterman, were very considerate and kind, and I feel honored to be part of... Think about including Howard Stern in your boyhood idols.

38:43.607 --> 38:45.548
I mean, that is just remarkable.

38:45.628 --> 38:46.649
What a dumbass.

38:46.709 --> 38:49.491
That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

38:51.112 --> 38:52.373
It's not really, though.

38:52.413 --> 38:56.156
If you realize he's an actor, he's in show business, and...

38:57.948 --> 39:04.214
That dickhead that he just mentioned, Howard Stern, was very successful in show business, so of course he admires him.

39:05.495 --> 39:07.978
Who knows what goes into doing a show like this?

39:08.018 --> 39:09.700
And I also want to thank all of you.

39:10.689 --> 39:12.651
What goes into a show like this?

39:12.931 --> 39:14.812
How big do you think his staff is?

39:14.872 --> 39:20.336
How much do you think they get paid to dedicate their lives and every day to this show?

39:20.376 --> 39:22.258
What goes into making this show?

39:22.738 --> 39:23.499
Stop lying!

39:24.199 --> 39:25.560
Stop lying!

39:25.881 --> 39:27.542
You know what goes into making this show?

39:27.942 --> 39:29.463
Everything that I do.

39:29.824 --> 39:30.264
All of it.

39:30.304 --> 39:33.366
The programming, the slides, the cameras, everything.

39:33.406 --> 39:34.167
It's not a $50,000 setup.

39:34.187 --> 39:35.208
It's a Craigslist setup.

39:37.355 --> 39:40.618
And nobody on the internet does it better than me all by themselves.

39:40.738 --> 39:42.459
Nobody does it better than me.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.103
Everything else here is smoke and mirrors.

39:46.263 --> 39:51.147
Everything that you see on the internet, any podcast you see is smoke and mirrors.

39:51.187 --> 39:55.491
They have producers and they have marketeers and they have editors.

39:56.031 --> 40:01.056
No one, no one, no one with more than 5,000 subscribers on the internet

40:01.616 --> 40:06.858
and a decent following on YouTube or lots of views on Rumble is anything but a puppet.

40:07.098 --> 40:14.660
They are raised up either because they've already passed the audition and their message is ridiculous, or they are being tested.

40:16.660 --> 40:25.203
You wanna see something real, you gotta go to a real analyst, somebody with a previous career, and somebody who had principles when it mattered in 2020.

40:27.791 --> 40:33.615
None of the people that are in front of you with a big podcast nowadays are people who had principles in 2020.

40:34.355 --> 40:38.698
From Matt Taibbi all the way to Brett Weinstein, they're all just frauds.

40:49.912 --> 40:55.377
who supported our show, cared enough to do something about it, to make your voices heard so that mine could be heard.

40:55.757 --> 40:56.758
I will never forget it.

40:56.838 --> 41:09.590
And maybe, maybe, maybe most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway.

41:09.610 --> 41:14.995
People who I never would have imagined

41:17.003 --> 41:28.432
Like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who, believe it or not, said something very beautiful on my behalf.

41:28.913 --> 41:30.934
I hate what Jimmy Kimmel said.

41:31.094 --> 41:38.420
I am... Jimmy Kimmel is pretending not to cry right now, and he mentioned Candace Owens and how many other retards?

41:40.262 --> 41:42.283
Thrilled that he was fired.

41:42.443 --> 41:43.164
Shapiro?

41:43.885 --> 41:44.405
Come on.

41:44.425 --> 41:44.965
No, not that.

41:46.474 --> 41:47.175
the other part.

41:47.575 --> 41:59.383
But let me tell you, if the government gets in the business of saying we don't like what you, the media have said, we're going to ban you from the airwaves.

41:59.483 --> 42:15.935
So what I'm suggesting, and I hope it makes good sense to you, is that all of these people have been scripted to take this position, just like Mark Maron has been scripted to take the position, you know, kind of this side of Joe Rogan, you know, finally getting his act together or pulling your head out or

42:16.308 --> 42:18.431
you know, not pulling the same crap all the time.

42:18.451 --> 42:33.932
And this case, Tucker Carlson and Ted Cruz and a few other people have been scripted to rise essentially in this narrative where everybody comes to the help of Jimmy Kimmel, unless they're mean or something, you know, and we have to come together.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.860
We have to come together under free speech.

42:37.920 --> 42:43.602
It's not that dissimilar to how the health freedom movement said we have to come together under a big top tent of health freedom.

42:44.102 --> 42:48.203
Now America has to come together and agree that free speech is free speech.

42:48.763 --> 42:52.743
And, and, and we, we all, we all fight for it or something like that.

42:52.803 --> 43:00.525
But this is going to go, this is going to go all the way until free speech on the internet is different than free speech on the street.

43:02.608 --> 43:06.009
Free speech on the street is very different than free speech on the internet.

43:06.029 --> 43:13.652
We're going to have to regulate free speech on the internet because, you know, it can echo in ways that we can't control because of those darn algorithms.

43:15.673 --> 43:21.235
If you don't say what we like, that will end up bad for conservatives.

43:21.675 --> 43:24.316
I don't think I've ever said this before, but Ted Cruz is right.

43:24.737 --> 43:28.138
He's absolutely right.

43:29.660 --> 43:31.081
All of us, including him.

43:31.301 --> 43:32.082
I mean, think about it.

43:32.602 --> 43:36.585
If Ted Cruz can't speak freely, then he can't cast spells on the Smurfs.

43:38.466 --> 43:45.491
Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects, some of the things they say even make me want to throw up.

43:45.571 --> 43:49.054
It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration.

43:49.074 --> 43:50.755
And they did, and they deserve credit for it.

43:50.775 --> 43:52.616
And thanks.

43:52.957 --> 43:56.239
For telling your followers that our government

43:57.435 --> 44:03.739
cannot be allowed to control what we do and do not say on television, and that we have to stand up to it.

44:04.019 --> 44:07.081
I've been hearing a lot about what I need to say and do tonight.

44:07.521 --> 44:11.183
And the truth is, I don't think what I have to say is going to make much of a difference.

44:11.243 --> 44:12.184
If you like me, you like me.

44:12.224 --> 44:13.104
If you don't, you don't.

44:13.144 --> 44:15.386
I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind.

44:15.726 --> 44:18.808
But I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human.

44:19.228 --> 44:25.672
And that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man.

44:31.766 --> 44:34.168
He's an actor and I do not believe him.

44:36.038 --> 44:36.779
He's an actor.

44:37.119 --> 44:38.460
This is not genuine.

44:38.520 --> 44:42.104
This is for 20 million followers on YouTube.

44:42.604 --> 44:50.271
If there's anything funny about it, I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion.

44:50.311 --> 44:51.012
And I meant it.

44:51.132 --> 44:51.813
I still do.

44:52.554 --> 44:59.740
Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual.

45:00.461 --> 45:07.966
That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both.

45:08.026 --> 45:12.349
And for those who think I did, uh, point a finger, I get why you're upset.

45:12.429 --> 45:16.091
If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.

45:16.212 --> 45:25.037
I have many friends and family members on the other side who I love and remain close to, even though we don't agree on politics at all.

45:25.097 --> 45:28.980
I don't think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.061
This was a sick person

45:30.621 --> 45:32.903
who believed violence was a solution.

45:33.044 --> 45:37.408
Hey all the students out there in the audience, what happens as you listen to this?

45:37.468 --> 45:38.529
What's happening here?

45:39.370 --> 45:40.511
What's the enchantment?

45:41.432 --> 45:51.002
The enchantment is that the killer is a real killer and that he actually killed Charlie Kirk with the gun or whatever he shot him with because

45:52.128 --> 45:59.572
Kimmel is sad about it and admits that that guy's a crazy guy, you know, just a disturbed individual.

46:00.012 --> 46:16.762
And so not that dissimilar to a lot of these other enchantments that have been cast on us where the story or the argument or the apology is all based around a drama which exists inside of this bubble.

46:17.881 --> 46:28.316
And in this case, the bubble is that Charlie Kirk was shot by a guy on the roof who has a furry for a transgender boyfriend or something like that.

46:28.757 --> 46:31.321
And then whether or not people will accept that or not.

46:32.748 --> 46:55.050
And just outside of it are all these weirdos talking about drones, or talking about audio analysis of where the shot came from, or talking about phones that fold up into guns, or guns that fold up into phones, talking about stolen security cameras and memory cards.

46:56.795 --> 46:59.976
And all of you are separate from one another.

46:59.996 --> 47:12.318
All of you are wasting time separate from one another on things that none of these people, which is like a majority of Americans, will ever see or consider worth their time.

47:14.679 --> 47:22.580
And there's a very vanishing few people that are still doing that, but those people are in grave danger.

47:23.701 --> 47:25.761
And they're my fellow Americans, so I want to help.

47:26.775 --> 47:29.118
And it isn't, ever.

47:29.639 --> 47:30.741
And also selfishly.

47:35.703 --> 47:38.205
I am a person who gets a lot of threats.

47:38.246 --> 47:43.991
I get many ugly and scary threats against my life, my wife, my kids, my coworkers, because of what I choose to say.

47:44.391 --> 47:48.715
And I know those threats don't come from the kind of people on the right who I know and love.

47:48.775 --> 47:50.237
So that's what I wanted to say.

47:50.317 --> 47:55.001
So he knows people on the right, and he loves them, just like the people on the left.

47:55.481 --> 47:57.183
Who are these imaginary people?

47:59.185 --> 48:00.426
I don't think he knows anyone.

48:01.533 --> 48:03.674
And more importantly, what does he get threats for?

48:03.714 --> 48:09.016
Let's not forget that this is the guy who said, if you're unvaccinated, oh yeah, over here's the waiting room.

48:09.416 --> 48:10.257
Oh, you're vaccinated?

48:10.317 --> 48:11.217
Oh, come right in.

48:12.458 --> 48:13.638
You need a heart transplant?

48:13.698 --> 48:14.238
Come right in.

48:14.278 --> 48:15.239
You need a heart transplant?

48:15.259 --> 48:16.519
Oh no, you're not unvaccinated?

48:16.619 --> 48:17.220
See you later.

48:19.080 --> 48:25.243
And so it's not for nothing that this man, it's because he has been at the center of this on purpose.

48:26.854 --> 48:28.975
because he's an actor and this is his job.

48:29.675 --> 48:32.196
It's podcasts and late night TV.

48:33.157 --> 48:40.680
Say on that subject, but I don't want to make this about me because, and I know this is what people say when they make things about them, but I really don't.

48:40.740 --> 48:44.202
This show, this show is not important.

48:44.342 --> 48:49.484
What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.

48:49.804 --> 48:55.707
I mean,

48:57.071 --> 49:10.819
I've had the opportunity to meet and spend time with comedians and talk show hosts from countries like Russia, countries in the Middle East, who told me they would get thrown in prison for making fun of those in power, and worse than being thrown in prison.

49:10.859 --> 49:13.040
They know how lucky we are.

49:13.080 --> 49:22.445
So not only does he have a lot of friends on the right who he loves, but he knows a lot of people in other countries where they would go to prison if they talked about their leaders like he talks about his leader.

49:22.859 --> 49:23.599
Stop lying!

49:24.300 --> 49:25.801
It's just ridiculous.

49:25.861 --> 49:29.082
Our freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country.

49:29.542 --> 49:41.408
And that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Steven off the air and tried to coerce the affiliates who run our show in the cities that you live in to take my show off the air.

49:41.448 --> 49:42.209
That's not legal.

49:42.229 --> 49:43.809
That's not American.

49:43.849 --> 49:45.250
That is un-American.

49:45.310 --> 49:45.971
And it is so dangerous.

49:45.991 --> 49:50.453
I want you to think about this.

49:53.578 --> 50:02.942
Should the government be allowed to regulate which podcasts the cell phone companies and Wi-Fi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?

50:03.362 --> 50:04.582
You think that sounds crazy?

50:05.823 --> 50:07.264
But that's where we're going.

50:07.604 --> 50:09.384
Of course that's where we're going.

50:09.965 --> 50:13.326
Especially if you use one of these platforms.

50:14.446 --> 50:15.507
Because they can do it.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.443
In fact, you allow them to do it.

50:18.524 --> 50:29.381
Unless you host your own videos and your own website like I do, you are leaving yourself at the mercy of these people who can just program you invisible.

50:30.082 --> 50:31.344
And you would never know.

50:35.014 --> 50:36.575
Ten years ago, this sounded crazy.

50:36.955 --> 51:01.432
Brendan Carr, the chairman of the FCC, telling an American company, we can do this the easy way or the hard way, and that these companies can find ways to change conduct and take action on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead, in addition to being a direct violation of the First Amendment, is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public.

51:01.872 --> 51:04.574
Ted Cruz said he sounded like a mafioso.

51:05.354 --> 51:15.139
Although, I don't know, if you want to hear a mob boss make a threat like that, you have to hide a microphone in a deli and park outside in a van with a tape recorder all night long.

51:15.499 --> 51:17.420
This genius said it on a podcast.

51:18.201 --> 51:24.964
Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one.

51:25.484 --> 51:28.466
And that's saying something.

51:28.766 --> 51:30.367
You have to see.

51:32.591 --> 51:37.893
The FCC has a tradition of meddling where they shouldn't under many administrations, but it wasn't always like this.

51:37.933 --> 51:44.295
There was an FCC commissioner back in 2022 who worked under Joe Biden who was spot on.

51:44.375 --> 51:46.155
He wrote, President Biden is right.

51:46.435 --> 51:51.097
Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech.

51:51.417 --> 51:56.238
It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people into the discussion.

51:56.518 --> 52:01.500
That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.

52:01.960 --> 52:02.840
You know who wrote that?

52:03.841 --> 52:14.225
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who later was appointed chairman of the FCC by this former crusader for free speech.

52:14.505 --> 52:18.687
If we don't have free speech, then we just don't have a free country.

52:18.867 --> 52:20.188
It's as simple as that.

52:20.828 --> 52:30.292
If this most fundamental right is allowed to perish, then the rest of our rights and liberties will topple, just like dominoes, one by one, they'll go down.

52:30.632 --> 52:32.513
That was also in 2022.

52:32.953 --> 52:36.454
And I wonder, how did that guy turn into this guy?

52:36.594 --> 52:38.814
Who would you like to see replace Kimmel on late night?

52:39.455 --> 52:40.215
A lot of people.

52:40.275 --> 52:41.375
Anybody could replace him.

52:41.395 --> 52:43.336
The guy had no talent.

52:43.396 --> 52:44.796
Look, he was fired.

52:44.836 --> 52:45.716
He had no talent.

52:46.797 --> 52:47.677
He's a whack job.

52:48.157 --> 52:49.097
But he had no talent.

52:49.197 --> 52:53.499
And more importantly, the talent he had, because a lot of people have no talent, they get ratings.

52:54.339 --> 52:55.179
But he had talent.

52:55.401 --> 53:03.786
First and foremost, that guy is an actor with years and years of on-camera, on-screen experience.

53:06.587 --> 53:07.188
An actor.

53:10.450 --> 53:16.713
Well... I do tonight.

53:22.677 --> 53:24.458
So he does have ratings tonight.

53:25.478 --> 53:31.559
And see, that's the clapping seals that don't realize that they were played.

53:35.300 --> 53:36.100
But they were played.

53:43.941 --> 53:46.462
Guillermo, do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now?

53:47.562 --> 53:47.962
20 million.

53:48.042 --> 53:48.582
That's right.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.322
Yeah, that's why we're wearing these glasses.

53:50.722 --> 53:52.143
Thanks for being a subscriber.

53:52.223 --> 53:54.483
If you're not, help us get to 20 million and one.

54:01.471 --> 54:03.632
It's about herding cats, ladies and gentlemen.

54:03.672 --> 54:06.314
What you see here are a bunch of cat herders.

54:07.254 --> 54:11.316
It's 350 million humans in America.

54:11.396 --> 54:17.940
And let's say, let's say 75 million of them need herding.

54:19.426 --> 54:39.310
and now you see what they're doing here this is just herding cats and it is the collective herding of cats that has been prioritized as a national security priority now remember this film that i showed you the other day under the pretense that friendship is deep trust and understand that in this picture

54:43.504 --> 54:52.638
In this picture, many of the people, including Joe Rogan and Jimmy Kimmel and all of them around here, are longtime friends.

54:53.079 --> 54:58.187
And the farther down you go, the less maybe, the more recently they were recruited.

54:59.224 --> 55:24.487
But nonetheless, there are layers and layers of scripted actors that just have agreed to accept the script, just have agreed to play a character, just have agreed to make sure that you never question X, Y, and Z. And if you're just willing to stick to the script that's given, like Joe Rogan is, then they can give you hundreds of millions of dollars and just talk to the people that we send to you.

55:26.348 --> 55:34.855
Now, it might seem oversimplified to say that we are being ruled by podcasts, and it is, because we are also being ruled by late night talk shows.

55:35.816 --> 55:36.616
That's really it.

55:37.337 --> 55:38.237
There's nothing else.

55:38.418 --> 55:43.742
Everything else is something that you watch as a clip on social media, a video, or a short.

55:45.902 --> 55:49.146
And so ultimately it's how do they get in your feed?

55:49.607 --> 55:51.829
And which one of these people did you choose?

55:51.889 --> 56:02.983
And once you choose one of these lower tier people, you're kind of stuck wasting hours and hours because all these lower tier people do is argue about what those higher tier people are doing.

56:04.963 --> 56:11.047
And the one thing that I want to give to everybody with a family member that fell for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:11.087 --> 56:18.391
and the anti-vax movement or the health freedom movement is that all of these people from layer three on down were aimed at them.

56:19.752 --> 56:21.793
Hundreds of people are not on this picture.

56:22.233 --> 56:32.259
They were all aimed at our family and friends with the idea of confusing them, wasting their time and their energy on skepticism that would never rise

56:34.161 --> 56:47.351
to the level of national or worldwide scrutiny would never rise to any meaningful place because it was never, it was not scripted, but it was here in order to make sure that you would never get there.

56:53.556 --> 56:56.498
And so that's why I showed you this barbecue restaurant.

56:58.669 --> 56:59.891
Oops, it's not really playing.

57:00.171 --> 57:01.293
Let me just escape here.

57:01.313 --> 57:03.036
Gonna have a little crash.

57:03.456 --> 57:07.543
Testing the... testing the memory there.

57:26.917 --> 57:29.818
All of us, we all went to the same elementary.

57:30.058 --> 57:32.019
I've known Lane since kindergarten.

57:32.099 --> 57:36.661
Johnny moved in third grade to our elementary school, so we were all friends before that.

57:39.802 --> 57:41.263
Everybody started getting barbie jobs.

57:41.523 --> 57:43.404
Johnny worked at Franklin.

57:43.424 --> 57:44.664
He worked at Valentino's.

57:44.864 --> 57:47.225
Lane worked at Micklewaite and Freedman's.

57:47.285 --> 57:48.546
I also worked at Freedman's.

57:50.708 --> 57:56.960
Eventually it was like, all right, we should team up together and have our own barbecue restaurant and just run it the way we want to run it.

57:57.867 --> 58:12.033
Now what I want you to imagine for just one second, work with me here on this analogy, that these guys are all the guys who started Goldie's Barbecue and it became the number one barbecue restaurant in Texas.

58:12.093 --> 58:21.837
Now what I want you to imagine is a military organization that was interested in, and a weaponized pile of money that was interested in taking over

58:22.774 --> 58:27.978
effectively the barbecue restaurants and barbecue scene in Texas.

58:28.798 --> 58:42.447
And what they did was they paid these three guys to each split up and open their own barbecue chain and then use social media and actors on social media.

58:43.648 --> 58:52.334
And these guys themselves, after they gave each other a hug and all their families knew that they were in on it, they started talking shit about each other.

58:53.160 --> 59:01.584
And then social media amplified the fact that, you know, former Goldie's barbecue guys are now having a tussle over whose ideas it was.

59:01.924 --> 59:09.308
And now suddenly everybody's interested in going to these barbecue restaurants and evaluating for themselves, which one actually got it right.

59:11.812 --> 59:23.702
It's just a thought experiment to try and show you what three guys with enough trust, because they've known each other since elementary school, could do with a few years of pretending that they don't like each other.

59:24.183 --> 59:28.467
Pretending that they're, you know, got stabbed in the back by that Zane guy.

59:28.847 --> 59:29.988
Zane's such a dick.

59:30.388 --> 59:35.713
But then everybody wants to go to Zane's restaurant because, you know, the other guy's talking about it.

59:37.950 --> 59:47.136
And what I want you to see quite clearly is that in this picture, Guillermo, do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now?

59:47.156 --> 59:47.537
20 million.

59:47.637 --> 59:48.157
That's right.

59:48.257 --> 59:48.497
Yeah.

59:48.557 --> 59:49.918
That's why we're wearing these glasses.

59:50.318 --> 59:54.782
In this picture, there are people who could have just agreed, you know what we ought to do?

59:54.842 --> 59:58.044
We ought to split up and see how much damage we can do.

59:59.515 --> 01:00:12.243
Behind these people, there might be somebody like Steve Bannon who said, hey, I got an idea for how all you guys that have known each other for this long could split up and create a movement on both sides.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:23.690
I want you to see how easy it is because all of these people are, in fact, long-time friends.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.792
The ones that really matter are, in fact, long-time friends.

01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:31.835
And so it is professional friends of 30 years that are working against us right now.

01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:38.559
You know, spy friends for the last 30 years that are working with show business actors.

01:00:39.753 --> 01:00:58.958
that understood that the transition to social media was gonna happen and that they could help each other transition flawlessly from traditional media to social media podcasting and have millions of followers in the process if they just help this national security narrative for a few years.

01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:01.767
And that's what they did.

01:01:02.308 --> 01:01:14.434
Just like lifelong friends could, if they wanted to, start a barbecue restaurant and kick some ass, those same friends could split up and pretend that they don't like each other for a little while and make all of them rich.

01:01:14.954 --> 01:01:16.055
And that's what they did.

01:01:16.155 --> 01:01:27.641
They could split up on social media for a little while, split up in showbiz for a little while, and then give each other shout outs in their shows after they have a fake fight or they get fake fired.

01:01:29.704 --> 01:01:41.534
And that's why none of these people are able to talk succinctly about population pyramids or about murder during the pandemic, manslaughter during the pandemic, or just pneumonia numbers and how the hell we lost control of them.

01:01:45.737 --> 01:01:48.179
That's why this line is not level.

01:01:48.279 --> 01:01:49.720
They saw this coming.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.521
It's right there.

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:52.903
When I was in high school and in college, it was coming.

01:01:53.163 --> 01:01:53.683
They knew it.

01:01:54.224 --> 01:01:55.825
And they put these people in place.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.008
They put these narratives in place.

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:02.140
But they put people in place like Dave Baltimore.

01:02:04.182 --> 01:02:07.566
They put people in place like Robert Malone and Tony Fauci.

01:02:09.288 --> 01:02:10.369
And Paul Offit.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:11.370
I'm Amy Goodman.

01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:12.952
And I'm Nermeen Shaikh.

01:02:13.052 --> 01:02:16.476
Welcome to our listeners and viewers around the country and around the world.

01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:23.656
The federal government has confirmed over a hundred people across 14 States have now developed measles.

01:02:23.736 --> 01:02:40.439
So what I'm showing you here is that on February in 2015 democracy now with the same Indian lady that they still have in the same old white haired lady that they still have was reporting about a measles epidemic that was more or less being blamed on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:44.720
would be written about in Rolling Stone, et cetera, et cetera, and would be,

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:52.645
On one side of the narrative, this MMR vaccine and causes autism and a person by the name of Mary Holland.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:56.508
Also on the skeptic side would be Rand Paul.

01:02:56.788 --> 01:02:58.289
This is all 10 years ago.

01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:04.698
and Paul Offit on the NIH side, the Fauci side.

01:03:04.798 --> 01:03:12.602
And that same set of people was on about a month ago in 2025 and has been on many times since.

01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:13.883
It's the same cast.

01:03:14.363 --> 01:03:17.705
And they never seem to win any ground from one another.

01:03:18.025 --> 01:03:23.768
They never seem to change or fine tune the argument that they're making in order to better

01:03:24.348 --> 01:03:32.473
put forth their position or discredit the position of the people that they purport to be opposite of.

01:03:32.973 --> 01:03:45.940
And this is a sign that this is a multi-decade, you know, so it is a multi-decade, you can say it any way you want, it's a national security operation and they're all involved.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.182
Mary Holland, Democracy Now!, Rand Paul,

01:03:50.123 --> 01:03:54.869
Paul Offit, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Brian Hooker, they're all in on it.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:04:05.022
Wittingly or unwittingly, there's no way to explain it any other way because they may have made no progress in 10 years, except for in who follows them.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:14.682
which is concentrated in California, began when an infected person visited Disneyland in Anaheim in December.

01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:22.105
On Wednesday, Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, Los Angeles County's interim health officer, updated reporters on the outbreak.

01:04:22.813 --> 01:04:28.580
The outbreak of measles that we're currently experiencing is the largest that we've had in this county and in this state.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.683
Okay, so let's go again and just see 2016.

01:04:32.084 --> 01:04:32.905
We're back at 845.

01:04:33.245 --> 01:04:37.490
The Tribeca Film Festival was first launched to help revitalize Lower Manhattan after the 9-11 attacks.

01:04:38.271 --> 01:04:45.776
Tonight it kicks off with a celebration of its 15th year Oscar winner Robert De Niro and producer Jane Rosenthal co-founded the festival and they're with us this morning.

01:04:45.796 --> 01:04:46.856
Good morning guys good to see.

01:04:47.437 --> 01:05:00.605
So this did start Robert as you well know as a response to 9.11 as getting the city back up on its feet downtown and now here you are 15 years later when you started it did you imagine it as an ongoing festival or something that was just for that moment in time.

01:05:01.408 --> 01:05:10.370
Well, you'd like to think that it would go on be part of the New York part of the tradition part of the fabric of the city and it looks at this point like it could be.

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:17.431
And so that's great we had no idea that we were sure with anything at this point.

01:05:17.511 --> 01:05:29.353
Yeah, we're all happy after 15 years Jane it does feel like an institution, it's one of the film festivals that you hear mentioned that's important that's got to exceed even your your wildest hopes back then.

01:05:29.953 --> 01:05:35.936
I did it certainly has and I'm actually happy that I'm not it's in an institution because of it.

01:05:36.796 --> 01:05:44.400
It's it's been really extraordinary and we're so thrilled that this year we can kick off with a story about the Met gala and in a winter.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:51.783
We also have other films to be screening at the Whitney and at the Guggenheim about Elizabeth Murray and Mario Cotter on

01:05:52.223 --> 01:06:00.448
So as a new New York institution where bringing in some of the you know bedrocks of New York.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:11.814
We're just talking Robert about how democratize filmmaking has become over these 15 years people with an iPhone or a laptop can put together a movie you guys are doing something with snapchat I know you want to explain step by step.

01:06:16.637 --> 01:06:19.560
But it is remarkable how somebody with a phone can make a short film.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.823
I wonder if he has any interest in Snapchat.

01:06:22.883 --> 01:06:23.984
So this is funny, right?

01:06:24.004 --> 01:06:25.645
To see this is 2016.

01:06:25.705 --> 01:06:28.408
This is actually the same week that Vaxxed was released.

01:06:28.448 --> 01:06:30.670
This is a few days after April 1st, 2016.

01:06:36.664 --> 01:06:42.548
In 2006, we were actually one of the first festivals to screen a film that was made on an Nokia phone.

01:06:43.289 --> 01:06:47.532
And it was actually amazing how it looked when it was projected, because it had this tension.

01:06:47.572 --> 01:06:50.014
It felt like a cinema verite, like a Russolini film.

01:06:50.415 --> 01:06:56.579
So we've always been about technology and about pushing the boundaries with technology, as long as you can tell a good story.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:01.123
So technology is great, but if you can't tell a good story, then forget it.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:09.527
There was a bit of controversy, some headlines at the beginning of this year's festival when it was announced that this film called Vaxxed would be screened at the festival.

01:07:09.947 --> 01:07:11.508
Later, the festival pulled it.

01:07:12.088 --> 01:07:16.650
Was it because of the backlash were you surprised that people reacted the way that they did?

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:18.171
I was shooting a movie.

01:07:18.231 --> 01:07:19.732
I was in the middle of a lot of stuff.

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:24.485
I think the movie is something that people should see.

01:07:25.305 --> 01:07:35.031
There was a backlash which I haven't fully explored, and I will, and I didn't want it to start affecting the festival in ways that I couldn't see.

01:07:35.811 --> 01:07:59.846
but definitely there's something to that movie and there's another movie called so del was on nbc news today his face right sears was there like this is some serious exposure trace amounts and these there are there's a lot of information about things that are happening with the cdc the pharmaceutical companies there's a lot of things that are not said i as a parent of a child who has autism

01:08:00.586 --> 01:08:04.089
I'm concerned and I want to know the truth and I'm not anti-vaccine.

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:05.971
I want safe vaccines.

01:08:06.451 --> 01:08:09.154
When you get some people... Does that sound familiar at all?

01:08:09.274 --> 01:08:11.035
I just wonder if that sounds familiar.

01:08:11.315 --> 01:08:15.479
Can't get a certain type of shot and they can die from it.

01:08:15.819 --> 01:08:16.820
You know, even penicillin.

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:18.822
So why should that not be with vaccine?

01:08:18.982 --> 01:08:19.503
Which it isn't.

01:08:20.174 --> 01:08:37.523
So you said you see what public for the first time saying that your 18 year-old son does have autism that have been a very private thing for you and part of the reason you wanted this film shown was to start that conversation absolutely believe you'll now have a role in that conversation going for possibly yes, because the thing is that the shut it down there's no reason to it.

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:42.645
If you're scientists, let's see let's hear everybody doesn't seem to want to hear much about it.

01:08:43.046 --> 01:08:47.448
It shut down and you guys are the ones that should be the investigating do the investigating.

01:08:47.853 --> 01:08:52.356
I think the film was controversial because people felt that the filmmaker had been discredited.

01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:54.617
Even he, I'm not so sure about.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:56.018
At the end of the day, even him.

01:08:56.559 --> 01:08:57.960
Jane, I'm at the end.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:05.084
One thing, um, it wasn't, it wasn't, there weren't sponsors or donors that were threatening to pull out of the film festival.

01:09:05.164 --> 01:09:10.488
It was our filmmakers and we're known for having... It was the filmmakers who wanted it pulled.

01:09:11.087 --> 01:09:12.769
amazing documentary films.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:22.520
You can take a look at our lineup, whether it's what we're starting with tonight or some other documentaries that are equally controversial that we have at the festival.

01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:25.404
So it was our filmmakers that were pulling out.

01:09:25.644 --> 01:09:28.808
There's another amazing film about... I find that amazing and we're going to talk about that.

01:09:29.028 --> 01:09:38.534
But there's another amazing film that was done by Roger Ross Williams that won the audience award at Sundance called Life Animated about autism.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:42.597
And it's a really beautiful film about the Susskind family.

01:09:42.857 --> 01:09:44.778
It's a beautiful film, but it's another thing.

01:09:44.898 --> 01:09:45.759
It's the result of.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:50.122
It's not questioning how some people got autism.

01:09:50.802 --> 01:09:56.605
how the vaccines are dangerous, if not given a dangerous to certain people who are more susceptible.

01:09:57.145 --> 01:10:01.507
And they don't, nobody seems to want to address that or they say they've addressed it and it's a closed.

01:10:01.627 --> 01:10:03.768
So it's really the same narrative, right?

01:10:03.788 --> 01:10:08.250
10 years ago, here he is on the today show saying that it's genetic susceptibility.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:14.614
But it doesn't seem to be, because there are many people who will come out and say, no, I saw my kid change like overnight.

01:10:15.134 --> 01:10:18.256
I saw what happened, and I should have done something, and I didn't.

01:10:19.017 --> 01:10:23.019
So there's more to this than meets the eye, believe me.

01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:25.681
Is that the experience you had, Robert, something changed overnight?

01:10:26.581 --> 01:10:50.111
it my wife says that I don't remember but there was I my child is autistic and every kid is different but there is something there there's something there that people aren't addressing and for me to get so upset here today on the today show with you guys means there's something there that's all I wanted was the movie to be seen people can make their own judgment but you must see it and other there are other films all I remember

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:58.982
What I really want is for people to see that that graph right there shows murder of my fellow Americans for two and a half years while all of these people lied about it.

01:10:59.062 --> 01:11:01.585
The fake health freedom movement lied about it.

01:11:01.645 --> 01:11:03.407
They were put in place to lie about it.

01:11:03.427 --> 01:11:08.273
Other things that also just document and show, you know, it's not such a simple thing.

01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:27.112
do you regret pulling it now and some part of me doesn't part of this is let me let it go for now and I'll deal with it later in another way but as I didn't want the festival to be affected in a way because it was like a knee jerk reaction and especially from the filmmakers frankly that that I that I you know.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:37.489
the other filmmakers who were in the whatever they were and I didn't I didn't want to want to ask him, but now I will see that Robert is nearly consensus in the scientific community that there's no link there.

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:44.797
Do you believe that's not true, I don't I believe it's much more complicated than that it's much more complicated than that there there is a link.

01:11:45.377 --> 01:11:50.742
And they're saying there isn't but there are certain things doesn't the obvious one is by Marisol which is Mercury.

01:11:51.463 --> 01:11:52.664
a base preservative.

01:11:52.905 --> 01:11:58.990
But there are other things that I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but I know because I've seen so much reaction

01:12:00.106 --> 01:12:02.648
about just let's find out the truth.

01:12:02.868 --> 01:12:04.670
Let's just find out the truth.

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:05.971
Stop lying.

01:12:06.431 --> 01:12:09.794
I'm not anti-vaccine as I say, but I'm pro safe.

01:12:09.894 --> 01:12:12.055
He's on their script.

01:12:12.155 --> 01:12:13.136
That's all you need to see.

01:12:13.156 --> 01:12:14.477
He doesn't have to be lying.

01:12:14.517 --> 01:12:18.861
I might not have should have played that, but he's on the script that he's provided.

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:24.785
He's not saying anything that Brian Hooker of 2016 wouldn't have also said.

01:12:24.825 --> 01:12:26.727
Now, Brian Hooker would have said something different in 2013,

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.663
but not in 2016 vaccine.

01:12:31.963 --> 01:12:37.208
And there are some people who cannot take a vaccine and they have to be found.

01:12:37.248 --> 01:12:50.880
There are some people who can't take a vaccine and that's why other people are obligated to take a vaccine is also a fricking narrative talking point that has not changed in more than 15 years.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.121
Wake up.

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:57.644
out and warned that you just don't give a kid a bunch of shots and then something happens.

01:12:58.005 --> 01:13:01.967
Some parents, you know, even in this document, they say, I knew I shouldn't have done it.

01:13:02.027 --> 01:13:03.028
I knew I shouldn't have done it.

01:13:03.068 --> 01:13:04.049
I talked to the doctor.

01:13:04.069 --> 01:13:05.009
He's the doctor.

01:13:05.069 --> 01:13:05.750
I should listen.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:06.330
I should listen.

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:07.051
I did it.

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:08.351
the next day.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.693
Imagine how the parent feels.

01:13:10.893 --> 01:13:20.299
The worry is that people who hear those words and wonder about it will then not have their child vaccinated, which has led to a higher incidence of things like mumps and measles, that kind of thing.

01:13:20.319 --> 01:13:22.281
I don't know if those statistics are accurate.

01:13:22.321 --> 01:13:23.221
I'm not the one to say.

01:13:23.521 --> 01:13:27.164
The question would be, right, what would they do to somebody who did this?

01:13:27.264 --> 01:13:36.190
If this is accidental, that they didn't script this, that this was done live with all those people outside, and he just got to say a lot more than they planned him to say,

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:38.311
That would be extraordinary, wouldn't it?

01:13:38.351 --> 01:13:41.173
Because there are people who can say, cut, let's go to a commercial.

01:13:41.574 --> 01:13:42.895
There are people who can do that.

01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:49.500
So in my humble opinion, he already agreed to stay on script and that's why they haven't cut.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.544
That's why that guy had the question that he could say, well, there is a consensus that this isn't true.

01:13:56.713 --> 01:13:57.755
It's a script.

01:13:58.255 --> 01:13:59.477
I would question even that.

01:13:59.557 --> 01:14:02.020
There's a kind of a hysteria, the knee jerk reaction.

01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:03.002
Let's see.

01:14:03.502 --> 01:14:06.486
As I say, everyone should have the choice to take vaccines.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:11.613
Some places it's becoming mandatory, but it does benefit the big drug companies, funnily enough.

01:14:12.213 --> 01:14:29.117
If you want to start to look at facts and statistics, one of the things that you do need to look at in this movie, Vaxxed, is the contradictions of facts and statistics right off the top with what's stated, with what the rise is, what the graph is, and then people saying something different.

01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:34.298
So you need to read the reviews of that movie, make your own decision.

01:14:35.058 --> 01:14:36.398
Clearly the festival has about

01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:39.260
100 other movies that are in the festival.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:59.337
This was only going to be screened once they've certainly had their voice and their their time and there's amazing films about other issues of social impact whether it's the criminal justice, but don't forget that having a child with autism can mean almost anything to these people if they are on script.

01:15:00.198 --> 01:15:02.019
Is it a learning disability is it ADHD.

01:15:03.635 --> 01:15:06.057
Is he some other way neurologically damaged?

01:15:06.477 --> 01:15:12.661
Everything in childhood that is neurological is called autism, I assure you.

01:15:12.681 --> 01:15:20.807
And that's part of the reason why so many of these people are very, very confident that it's just the way we diagnose it that has changed.

01:15:23.089 --> 01:15:38.495
system, an amazing film called The Return, another film about her herbal life, Whistleblower Story, another film about drone warfare, National Bird, which is, it really asks a lot of questions about how we go to war.

01:15:38.595 --> 01:15:49.139
Certainly the festival is about having conversation and there's also some fun films too, Family Fang with Jason Bateman and Nicole Kidman.

01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:51.200
So we've got a lot for you at the festival.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.040
It's always fun.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:56.184
And by the way also highlighted by the 40 year anniversary of taxi driver.

01:15:57.913 --> 01:16:03.836
Yeah, I'm I'm I'm very curious and interested to go and okay, so they had to have him on again.

01:16:05.017 --> 01:16:07.978
They had to have him on again to speak again a week later because.

01:16:08.538 --> 01:16:14.421
Headlines last week when he appeared on today with me and Savannah to talk about the 15th anniversary of the Tribeca film festival.

01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:22.385
The conversation turned into a broader discussion about the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, a claim that's been widely discredited by the medical community.

01:16:22.665 --> 01:16:28.890
Well soon after that interview there I sat down with Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal the co-founders of the Tribeca Film Festival.

01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:40.118
We talked about the future of film the 40th anniversary of taxi driver and I asked De Niro about how he felt about pulling the anti-vaccine documentary vaxxed from the festival lineup.

01:16:40.598 --> 01:16:49.385
And so they did the interview again and this time they got it right and this time the producers going to say that there are all kinds of inconsistencies in the film that's why we pulled it.

01:16:51.187 --> 01:16:53.768
I still have mixed feelings about it.

01:16:53.788 --> 01:16:56.189
I wanted it to be in.

01:16:56.909 --> 01:17:01.451
We decided to pull it, because I didn't want to pull the festival in a direction.

01:17:01.571 --> 01:17:04.372
But it was from filmmakers, according to Jane.

01:17:04.512 --> 01:17:07.214
And so I said, let me just let it take it out.

01:17:07.354 --> 01:17:10.615
But I'm not 100% sure that was the right thing to do, ultimately.

01:17:10.995 --> 01:17:15.717
Next time, I'll know hopefully more clearly about when presented with a situation like this.

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:19.238
But there is something definitely there with Vax.

01:17:19.478 --> 01:17:20.459
And there is something.

01:17:22.236 --> 01:17:27.399
going on with the CDC, the pharmaceutical industry.

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:32.661
People should read the reviews of the film because there are things in the film that put aside the point that you're making.

01:17:32.701 --> 01:17:40.585
There are some issues in the film from its consistency, from somebody saying one thing 20 minutes in and then reverses their point of view.

01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:43.706
know there are inaccuracies in any film any documentary.

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:59.830
And so I don't really and I'm not defending it that way I don't I don't know, but there are accuracies with things that you have to question and that's my reason for having the film for question to question certain things or open it up for discussion pros and cons.

01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:09.493
There's something that is not quite kosher in all of this that's all I can say, but in a sense with this controversy probably more people will see this movie.

01:18:09.853 --> 01:18:12.094
Yeah, as they should, as they should.

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.034
It's almost like a plan.

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:17.575
It's almost like it was a plan.

01:18:18.475 --> 01:18:29.578
You know, they would get this movie and it would get a bunch of, you know, or they would cancel this guy named Steve Kimmel and then he would get a bunch of, he would get a bunch of, now it's going to be all over the United States.

01:18:29.598 --> 01:18:30.838
I wonder what they would do.

01:18:37.242 --> 01:18:38.043
I wonder what they'd do.

01:18:38.303 --> 01:18:40.424
I don't know what country he lives in, but I don't have a leader.

01:18:40.604 --> 01:18:41.925
I have an elected representative.

01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:10.726
We don't have leaders or great leaders.

01:19:11.908 --> 01:19:13.171
We have representatives.

01:19:13.552 --> 01:19:14.575
Who is this yo-yo?

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:15.940
for that.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.961
With that said, I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Earth.

01:19:22.041 --> 01:19:23.762
I did not agree with that decision.

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:24.782
And I told them that.

01:19:24.902 --> 01:19:26.442
And we had many conversations.

01:19:26.902 --> 01:19:27.963
I shared my point of view.

01:19:28.003 --> 01:19:28.823
They shared theirs.

01:19:29.263 --> 01:19:30.203
We talked it through.

01:19:30.643 --> 01:19:35.724
And at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company.

01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:38.305
We have short attention spans.

01:19:38.385 --> 01:19:41.685
And I am a tiny part of the Disney Corporation.

01:19:41.725 --> 01:19:43.366
They welcomed me back on the air.

01:19:43.406 --> 01:19:44.546
And I thank them for that.

01:19:50.626 --> 01:19:56.030
that unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk.

01:19:56.090 --> 01:20:03.136
The President of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs.

01:20:03.577 --> 01:20:09.441
Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.

01:20:09.942 --> 01:20:10.322
He was... Somehow...

01:20:15.057 --> 01:20:29.380
able to squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he's openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows, who don't make millions of dollars.

01:20:29.661 --> 01:20:35.082
And I hope that if that happens, or if there's even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.743
Jimmy Kimmel has 21 million subscribers on YouTube.

01:20:40.783 --> 01:20:46.488
He has an ABC affiliated talk show that gets broadcast all around the world.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:48.951
I think people watch him.

01:20:50.872 --> 01:20:52.694
It's as loud as you were this week.

01:20:53.034 --> 01:20:55.256
We have to speak out against this guy.

01:20:55.276 --> 01:20:58.959
He's not stopping.

01:21:01.212 --> 01:21:02.453
And it's not just comedy.

01:21:03.313 --> 01:21:05.355
He's gunning for our journalists too.

01:21:05.415 --> 01:21:06.115
He's suing them.

01:21:06.135 --> 01:21:07.056
He's bullying them.

01:21:07.136 --> 01:21:16.862
Over the weekend, his foxy friend, Pete Hegseth announced a new policy that requires journalists with Pentagon press credentials to sign a pledge promising.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:26.128
Please understand that the stage manager can just say, if you want to hear yourself in the audience, you have to scream loud.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:30.494
The microphone is up there and it's up there.

01:21:31.095 --> 01:21:38.647
And so if you want to hear yourself on national television, you need to scream loud when I go like this and you need to stop when I go like this.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.001
That's all he's got to say.

01:22:00.302 --> 01:22:02.123
And so again, now you see it, right?

01:22:02.183 --> 01:22:10.609
This is the theater, the theater that Donald Trump is a bad guy and now he's cracking down on us because, you know, when it comes to free speech for him, it's fine.

01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:14.292
You know, the whole bullshit, this theater is not going to get better.

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:15.293
It's going to get worse.

01:22:26.124 --> 01:22:29.366
Walter Cronkite must be spinning in his grave right now.

01:22:29.947 --> 01:22:30.607
He's dead, right?

01:22:32.108 --> 01:22:35.270
Look, I never imagined I would be in a situation like this.

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:37.131
I barely paid attention in school.

01:22:37.732 --> 01:22:47.599
But one thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American.

01:22:47.659 --> 01:22:49.820
That's anti-American.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.362
And I am so glad we have

01:22:53.567 --> 01:22:59.631
Some solidarity on that from the right and the left and from those in the middle, like Joe Rogan.

01:22:59.992 --> 01:23:05.876
Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one.

01:23:05.936 --> 01:23:08.938
Maybe we can get a little bit closer together.

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.699
We do agree on a lot of things.

01:23:11.079 --> 01:23:17.564
We agree on keeping our children safe from guns, from reproductive rights for women, Social Security.

01:23:19.591 --> 01:23:22.754
affordable health care, pediatric cancer research.

01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:26.196
These are all things that most Americans support.

01:23:26.757 --> 01:23:32.301
Let's stop letting these politicians tell us what they want and tell them what we want.

01:23:34.223 --> 01:23:39.247
Yeah, I mean it.

01:23:39.267 --> 01:23:42.289
Yeah.

01:23:45.351 --> 01:23:45.752
There was a...

01:23:50.615 --> 01:23:53.476
A moment over the weekend, a very beautiful moment.

01:23:53.536 --> 01:23:54.496
I don't know if you saw this.

01:23:54.617 --> 01:23:58.558
On Sunday, Erica Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband.

01:23:59.258 --> 01:24:00.159
She forgave him.

01:24:01.099 --> 01:24:03.280
That is an example we should follow.

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:11.083
If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do,

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:12.751
There it was.

01:24:13.411 --> 01:24:14.813
That's, that's it.

01:24:15.313 --> 01:24:19.778
A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow.

01:24:20.519 --> 01:24:23.322
It touched me deeply.

01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:33.633
There's no way that guy's crying because she forgave his killer, but the enchantment signified by this sound effect

01:24:36.129 --> 01:24:38.570
The enchantment is, is that there is a killer.

01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:39.610
He was caught.

01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:40.691
He's on the left.

01:24:40.771 --> 01:24:42.351
He's got a furry boyfriend.

01:24:43.832 --> 01:24:53.415
And Charlie Kirk is a good guy following the teachings of Jesus and his wife forgave the killer because that's what Jesus would do.

01:24:57.205 --> 01:25:01.386
I know it sounds very dark, ladies and gentlemen, but this is a national security theater.

01:25:01.466 --> 01:25:03.207
These are not real Christians.

01:25:03.267 --> 01:25:05.068
This is not a real Christian.

01:25:05.588 --> 01:25:09.449
This is a guy who was on The Man Show with Joe Rogan.

01:25:09.489 --> 01:25:17.051
This is a guy who will literally read any lines as long as it involves millions of dollars and being in front of a live audience.

01:25:21.164 --> 01:25:22.124
It touches many.

01:25:22.864 --> 01:25:29.506
And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that, not this.

01:25:29.906 --> 01:25:31.326
So thank you for listening.

01:25:31.986 --> 01:25:35.127
And I'll have more to say when we come back.

01:25:35.687 --> 01:25:45.549
What about also those who say that you're being, in recent months, awfully thin-skinned?

01:25:45.689 --> 01:25:46.830
I've always been thin-skinned.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.690
I've been thin-skinned from day one.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.059
Welcome back to Jimmy Kimmel Live.

01:25:52.119 --> 01:25:58.445
We are still on the air in most of the country, except, ironically, for Washington, D.C., where we have been preempted.

01:25:58.745 --> 01:26:01.368
We are off the air in Nashville, New Orleans.

01:26:01.628 --> 01:26:04.370
Here's the thing that I want you to understand, okay?

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:11.517
As a friend of several theater majors at DePaul University and knowing a lot of these theater majors well,

01:26:12.978 --> 01:26:21.486
I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you, they spend their whole day, a lot of their day, generating emotions on command.

01:26:21.906 --> 01:26:34.377
And if there's anything that he would be good at, at this stage, after all this professional experience doing these monologues, he would be very good at controlling his emotions in front of the camera.

01:26:34.777 --> 01:26:40.261
And he could have practiced this, he could have gone over it many times, and he would have never really fallen

01:26:40.962 --> 01:27:08.303
to the point where he was crying unless he allowed himself to get there again because actors can do that they can do it very easily because they've trained themselves to hold a few sad memories over here and a few funny ones over here or whatever they've done in order to make sure that this thespian change can be done on command and certainly when you know and he's preparing for it and they put on those suits

01:27:09.366 --> 01:27:22.512
the banana and the gopher, that these guys are willing to do anything, including making light of what was supposed to be a sincere apology that millions of people around the world were waiting to hear.

01:27:25.433 --> 01:27:30.315
But somewhere buried in there, he says he believes in the teachings of Jesus Christ.

01:27:32.116 --> 01:27:33.957
And I just can't stress enough how

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:43.598
Just the very saying of that on network television already goes against all of the teachings of Jesus Christ.

01:27:45.039 --> 01:27:52.681
The private relationship you're supposed to have with God the Father is not something that you're supposed to just throw around.

01:27:56.696 --> 01:28:05.729
That's why when people gave a warning about how fascism would come to America, it would be a cross, carrying a cross wrapped in a flag.

01:28:05.749 --> 01:28:06.770
That's not a joke.

01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:07.571
That's real.

01:28:07.631 --> 01:28:09.173
That's predictive programming.

01:28:09.213 --> 01:28:11.737
That's telling you what's about to happen.

01:28:16.909 --> 01:28:19.111
And it's just not Christianity.

01:28:19.331 --> 01:28:26.916
Jesus himself is quoted as saying, you know, render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and right now, Donald Trump, his Caesar.

01:28:28.291 --> 01:28:31.372
He can't also be our Christian savior.

01:28:31.392 --> 01:28:42.157
I mean, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., just because he says he prays 30 minutes a day and Donald Trump is the answer to those prayers, doesn't mean that we have to accept him as a Christian savior.

01:28:43.338 --> 01:28:54.943
If these people tell us that Charlie Kirk is a Christian savior, that doesn't mean that we have to, in fact, it goes against most things that you would come to understand if you read the New Testament.

01:28:56.063 --> 01:28:57.044
It's bizarre to me.

01:29:00.195 --> 01:29:18.702
I see it as completely bizarre, and the only way to explain the contrast between this data and this behavior is a military organization, a militarily organized script which has spanned over a decade of theater.

01:29:20.148 --> 01:29:23.029
Portland, Oregon, Salt Lake City, and St.

01:29:23.089 --> 01:29:26.329
Louis, where none of my wife's family is able to watch the show tonight.

01:29:26.369 --> 01:29:27.930
So sorry, Aunt Sharon.

01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:29.030
Sorry, Aunt Maureen.

01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:31.090
You'll have to go to YouTube, I guess.

01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:34.211
But I am glad to be back at work.

01:29:34.391 --> 01:29:36.132
It was touch and go for a minute.

01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:38.292
Guillermo did something very sweet, actually.

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:41.833
He called me, and he offered to sell his le boo-boos.

01:29:42.113 --> 01:29:44.954
I will never forget that gesture, my friend.

01:29:45.314 --> 01:29:46.474
Guillermo.

01:29:49.916 --> 01:29:50.837
I've done a lot of talking.

01:29:50.877 --> 01:29:53.519
Is there anything you would like to share with the audience tonight?

01:29:54.179 --> 01:29:54.420
Sure.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.423
I would like to say, listen, this world needs more people like Jimmy Kimmel.

01:29:59.824 --> 01:30:02.686
He is the best.

01:30:02.766 --> 01:30:04.867
He's a great man, a great father.

01:30:05.668 --> 01:30:06.429
And thank you, Jimmy.

01:30:06.509 --> 01:30:07.109
And I love you.

01:30:07.149 --> 01:30:08.350
And I stand with you all the way.

01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:09.151
And I love you.

01:30:10.979 --> 01:30:30.504
so it's so many great men in america right now it's kind of amazing that america is is is being destroyed right so many once in many generations great men in america it's really remarkable right that that guy's also an actor

01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:37.874
If you stand with me all the way, why did Ryan Seacrest call me and tell me you keep texting him over and over again?

01:30:37.914 --> 01:30:38.635
Never, never.

01:30:38.675 --> 01:30:39.938
That was wrong Mexican.

01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:40.439
Oh, I see.

01:30:40.499 --> 01:30:41.160
Yeah.

01:30:42.836 --> 01:30:45.198
So it's not racist when Mexicans are racist.

01:30:45.958 --> 01:30:51.602
We were in the middle, and in a lot of ways still are in the middle, of an unprecedented fix.

01:30:51.782 --> 01:31:00.168
After almost 23 years on the air, we're suddenly not being broadcast in 20% of the country, which is not a situation we relish.

01:31:00.248 --> 01:31:09.114
So we reached out to the chairman of the FCC, Brendan Carr, and he has, to his credit, agreed to join us from his office in Washington.

01:31:09.554 --> 01:31:10.314
And here he is now.

01:31:10.374 --> 01:31:12.496
Thank you, Chairman Carr, for being with us tonight.

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:19.612
Are you seeing the checkmate here?

01:31:22.013 --> 01:31:24.214
Why would he be on this show right now?

01:31:26.234 --> 01:31:28.915
Other than he is a scripted actor.

01:31:29.855 --> 01:31:35.496
Who's correcting a mistake that he started in 2016 on the Today Show.

01:31:36.517 --> 01:31:41.998
Correcting a mistake that he corrected a week later on the Today Show with the help of his then producer.

01:31:44.051 --> 01:31:51.798
And he's helping to correct the mistake now by steering the clapping masses back to the destination.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:32:02.408
See it clearly how under attack America is, how deceived we have been and how over what timeframe we have been deceived.

01:32:07.961 --> 01:32:14.566
You tell Whoopi over there she better show a little respect, or the only view she's getting is from under George Washington.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:16.207
The bridge, not the guy.

01:32:18.248 --> 01:32:19.509
Excuse me, sir?

01:32:19.589 --> 01:32:21.370
Yeah, hi.

01:32:22.271 --> 01:32:22.871
Well, what is this?

01:32:22.911 --> 01:32:23.792
You sneak up on me?

01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:26.554
You don't sneak up on a person.

01:32:26.614 --> 01:32:28.695
It's not nice.

01:32:28.995 --> 01:32:29.596
I'm sorry.

01:32:29.636 --> 01:32:30.276
What is your name?

01:32:30.296 --> 01:32:32.878
Because I was expecting to talk to the chairman of the FCC.

01:32:33.719 --> 01:32:34.819
You don't need to know my name.

01:32:34.919 --> 01:32:36.901
And I am the new chairman of the FCC.

01:32:38.408 --> 01:32:41.791
You were appointed FCC chairman by Donald Trump?

01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:43.352
Sir Trump, yes.

01:32:43.712 --> 01:32:46.754
I used to do some work for the man here and there in Atlantic City.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:50.197
But did I just hear you on the phone threatening Whoopi Goldberg?

01:32:50.957 --> 01:32:52.298
No, I would never threaten Ms.

01:32:52.338 --> 01:32:52.919
Goldstein.

01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:54.240
I was just teaching her a lesson.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.821
Now, why did he just use two Jewish names there?

01:32:56.861 --> 01:32:57.942
Why does he call her Ms.

01:32:58.022 --> 01:32:58.683
Goldstein?

01:32:58.723 --> 01:33:01.785
Is that also a Jewish joke that they're allowed to make?

01:33:01.885 --> 01:33:06.849
Because, you know, everybody's got to have this subconscious idea that the Jews are involved.

01:33:07.734 --> 01:33:08.535
Is that funny?

01:33:09.615 --> 01:33:25.905
Or is this a very nasty, malevolent, military, scripted, bullshit theater here with very distinct cognitive cues put in, including calling Whoopi Goldberg Goldstein.

01:33:27.326 --> 01:33:28.887
Please tell me you see this.

01:33:29.027 --> 01:33:30.848
This is how malevolent it has become.

01:33:30.948 --> 01:33:33.089
It is very dark right now in America.

01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:35.311
It's about consequences.

01:33:36.693 --> 01:33:38.655
Well, pardon me for saying so.

01:33:38.775 --> 01:33:40.035
Maybe you're the wrong guy to talk to.

01:33:40.076 --> 01:33:44.979
But it seems like the FCC is using mob tactics to suppress free speech.

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.321
What the f*** did you just say to me?

01:33:49.822 --> 01:33:51.163
I didn't mean any offense.

01:33:51.484 --> 01:33:55.026
You know, you can't curse, or we'll get fined by the FCC.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:56.987
I am the f***ing FCC.

01:33:57.048 --> 01:34:00.310
I can f***ing say whatever the f*** I want.

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.750
No.

01:34:01.471 --> 01:34:05.714
Well, this sounds a little like threats and intimidation to me, Chairman.

01:34:06.624 --> 01:34:07.184
Stop that.

01:34:07.945 --> 01:34:15.611
Look, it's just me, Jimmy, the chairman of the FCC, gently suggesting that you gently shut the fuck up.

01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:18.213
But you can't say that.

01:34:18.233 --> 01:34:20.514
That's a violation of free speech.

01:34:21.375 --> 01:34:21.775
Oh, yeah.

01:34:21.915 --> 01:34:22.496
About that.

01:34:23.396 --> 01:34:24.998
Speech, it ain't free no more.

01:34:25.018 --> 01:34:26.078
What?

01:34:26.199 --> 01:34:27.299
It's not free no more?

01:34:27.319 --> 01:34:28.340
Yeah.

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:29.581
We're charging by the word now.

01:34:30.582 --> 01:34:31.843
You're charging by the word?

01:34:31.923 --> 01:34:33.064
How much are you charging?

01:34:33.849 --> 01:34:40.516
Depends on what you want to say, like you want to say something nice about the president's beautiful thick yellow hair or how he can do his makeup better than any broad.

01:34:40.877 --> 01:34:44.300
That's for... So it's actually all one show.

01:34:46.322 --> 01:34:55.432
Because in 2013 when Brian Hooker would not use the word autism, he didn't like the word autism because his son was neurologically injured.

01:34:57.082 --> 01:35:01.483
Joe Rogan was already pushing the narrative that would come.

01:35:01.503 --> 01:35:05.465
It could lead to a viral armageddon, a biopocalypse.

01:35:05.905 --> 01:35:11.867
If you've got the lab, if you've got the scientists necessary, effectively you could come up with a zombie-type virus.

01:35:16.489 --> 01:35:24.453
Tonight, MERS, SARS, bird flu, mutating superbugs are threatening to wipe out mankind.

01:35:24.513 --> 01:35:25.974
Do we think we rule the planet?

01:35:26.274 --> 01:35:27.735
No, they rule the planet.

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:30.136
Their attack is always vicious.

01:35:30.337 --> 01:35:32.678
The majority of the exposed people will die.

01:35:33.138 --> 01:35:37.162
It could lead to a viral Armageddon, a bio apocalypse.

01:35:37.463 --> 01:35:38.384
You've got the land.

01:35:39.145 --> 01:35:49.896
It is absolutely impossible that this person is a virologist, but instead this is a stand in for Robert Malone in 2013 who probably helped with this script.

01:35:50.617 --> 01:35:53.580
There's no other way to explain the presence of this man.

01:35:54.994 --> 01:36:01.036
And there's another guy that's also in the video that also fits the, you know, American with white hair or blonde hair.

01:36:01.716 --> 01:36:17.440
This is absolutely positively a test run where they figure out that history channel shows and sci-fi channel shows don't have the kind of reach and don't have the kind of convincing nature that a podcast has.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:23.842
And in fact, this show clearly demonstrates the transition to Joe Rogan podcasting.

01:36:25.202 --> 01:36:36.255
This show on the Sci-Fi Channel about a coming pandemic with Robert Malone-esque characters telling us all about how it would happen is not by accident.

01:36:36.996 --> 01:36:44.965
It is because ever since the Human Genome Project was understood to be essentially unachievable as it was on paper.

01:36:46.335 --> 01:36:56.043
that the rules of life were not going to be discerned in the next few years without a drastic change in the way we did experiments and in what animal models we did those experiments.

01:36:57.504 --> 01:36:58.826
They need your grandchildren.

01:36:59.426 --> 01:37:12.117
And Joe Rogan is part of a multi-decade media campaign to change our minds about biology enough so that they could invert the sovereignty of our grandchildren to the status of experimental animal.

01:37:13.401 --> 01:37:41.711
If you've got the scientists that's the only way that you can explain this timeline of bullshit See that 2013 look at this timeline where Jimmy Kimmel is now on stage and doing a bit with with Robert De Niro who was involved in the promotion or anti-promotion of Vaxxed back when it was introduced

01:37:43.240 --> 01:38:09.160
therefore indirectly involved in the murder of Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn, because they had to be killed in 2020 so that the cast members of this theater, which were put in place on the internet in this time period, could take over the narrative and be promoted across social media when everybody would be forced to lock down and inevitably resort to social media to find the truth.

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:17.921
That's Joe Rogan.

01:38:19.103 --> 01:38:20.604
Governance by scripted actors.

01:38:20.684 --> 01:38:23.187
That's Jimmy Kimmel, governance by scripted actors.

01:38:23.287 --> 01:38:26.390
That's Kathy Griffin and Snoop Dogg.

01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:29.513
That's Trump derangement syndrome by scripted actors.

01:38:29.573 --> 01:38:31.836
So when were these voices recorded?

01:38:34.059 --> 01:38:38.082
Just see if you can play the game of when were these voices recorded.

01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:43.667
Just start in the chat tweeting what year you think these voices were recorded.

01:38:44.688 --> 01:38:47.390
So Dr. Malone, I was at the grocery store yesterday and

01:38:49.326 --> 01:38:50.406
Something interesting happened.

01:38:50.667 --> 01:38:52.887
I saw an unusual amount of people with masks.

01:38:53.288 --> 01:38:58.089
Dozens of people wearing, not a majority, but I'd say 15% of people wearing masks.

01:38:58.649 --> 01:39:03.471
And I go every Sunday, you know, just get groceries for the family, the way I can chip in.

01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:08.393
And it's totally different because two weeks ago, there was almost nobody wearing masks.

01:39:12.715 --> 01:39:13.195
Oops, sorry.

01:39:15.677 --> 01:39:21.181
What has changed, Dr. Malone, except that the Mockingbird Media decided to press a button?

01:39:21.921 --> 01:39:23.402
Well put, Mockingbird Media.

01:39:23.422 --> 01:39:24.823
I agree.

01:39:25.764 --> 01:39:27.365
It's not just the Mockingbird Media.

01:39:28.305 --> 01:39:41.214
It's the pharmaceutical industry, particularly Pfizer, but also Moderna, has cooperated again with the federal government and is getting the support of the federal government, including Mr. Biden.

01:39:42.176 --> 01:40:02.877
to promote the logic that we have two scary variants on the horizon that are causing this is let's stay grounded in the data there has been a modest uptick in hospitalizations attributed to COVID but they're still running so far nobody got it right yet 21 24 25 they are all

01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:08.073
Incorrect, but thanks for playing.

01:40:08.513 --> 01:40:12.677
Far, far below any of the major peak levels.

01:40:13.638 --> 01:40:22.547
And, uh, the variants that are being identified appear to be more infectious, but still not particularly pathogenic.

01:40:23.328 --> 01:40:28.253
I think the thing that is particularly fascinating here in addition to the fear porn, of course,

01:40:29.567 --> 01:40:35.931
and the willingness of entities like Lionsgate Media to impose max mandates.

01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:40.474
And then upon the outcry of many, have pulled that back.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:43.756
And this is also happening with some of the schools.

01:40:44.596 --> 01:40:55.163
But we have, once again, the development of new booster, quote unquote, products aimed at these new variants.

01:40:55.843 --> 01:40:58.245
And then the all unexpected,

01:40:59.335 --> 01:41:25.032
was Mr. Biden casually commenting that he has asked Congress for additional funds to develop a coronavirus vaccine that, quote, works, which of course implies the acknowledgement that the prior ones did not work, and that he would potentially want to mandate this for all Americans, including those that have previously received vaccine.

01:41:25.052 --> 01:41:27.894
Now, they appear to be dialing back on that a little bit,

01:41:28.647 --> 01:41:46.739
But it is amazingly concurrent with the upcoming primary season, which, of course, has got a lot of us skeptics concerned that there may be more shenanigans having to do with voting practices, et cetera, all rolled up into this new thing.

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:52.943
Meanwhile, back at the World Health Organization, they don't seem to be particularly alarmed about these new variants.

01:41:53.924 --> 01:41:58.327
So we've got Biden wants more money to build a vaccine that'll work.

01:41:59.182 --> 01:42:05.527
And just to recap, there has never been a coronavirus vaccine for humans that has been safe and effective.

01:42:06.307 --> 01:42:10.991
This has been a constant source of frustration after billions and billions of dollars invested.

01:42:12.172 --> 01:42:15.254
And so somehow Mr. Biden thinks this is going to be solved.

01:42:15.795 --> 01:42:19.818
I don't think we're going to make it to I don't know how the timing is here.

01:42:19.878 --> 01:42:21.379
So I'm also checking that right now.

01:42:21.419 --> 01:42:23.981
I just have a GoPro seven up there on the on the rack.

01:42:25.058 --> 01:42:30.622
Um, and, uh, so we'll see how that works, but I don't think we're going to have time to do the rest of the show.

01:42:30.662 --> 01:42:34.265
So I have to do it after basketball, which is fine because we're already at one 42.

01:42:34.805 --> 01:42:40.430
It's nice to have it broken up into little pieces, but I will listen to the rest of this and then play you out with a little journey.

01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:50.057
Um, and then I'll be back after the basketball, hopefully at around five o'clock or so, depending on the schedule of the family in a moment with the snap of the fingers.

01:42:51.138 --> 01:42:54.160
And, uh, that he'll be able to mandate deployment of this.

01:42:55.003 --> 01:42:59.730
But as I recall, they stopped the emergency declaration.

01:43:00.331 --> 01:43:05.077
And so if they're going to roll this out under EUA, they're going to have to have another emergency declaration.

01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:06.219
It's all very confusing.

01:43:07.028 --> 01:43:15.454
So calling for a new vaccine, one that actually works, and he says, I signed off this morning on a new plan to ask Congress for new funding.

01:43:16.355 --> 01:43:18.256
So Dr. Mullen, you said something interesting.

01:43:18.376 --> 01:43:19.838
Can you just elaborate on it?

01:43:19.898 --> 01:43:26.402
You say that coronaviruses, we have difficulty traditionally inoculating against coronaviruses.

01:43:26.943 --> 01:43:33.608
If that's the case, why is it that our federal government continues to push boosters and now wants to go after another vaccine?

01:43:33.628 --> 01:43:34.909
I thought the first one was 100% safe and effective.

01:43:36.997 --> 01:43:39.819
Right, so we know that that was a false narrative.

01:43:40.579 --> 01:43:45.943
It was actively promoted and you used a key word in a subtle way at the opening of this segment.

01:43:46.023 --> 01:43:47.764
You used the term mockingbird.

01:43:49.029 --> 01:43:54.113
And we seem to have a resuscitation of Mockingbird in so many different sectors.

01:43:54.133 --> 01:44:06.063
Of course, what you're referring to is Operation Mockingbird, which was halted after, I think, the Church Commission, and then reinstituted by Mr. Obama as he was leaving office.

01:44:06.143 --> 01:44:16.532
There's a great essay about this that Bobby Kennedy recently tweeted about that got a lot of attention from Tablet Magazine that covers the history of this new

01:44:17.532 --> 01:44:22.254
censorship industrial complex that is very much tied to our intelligence community.

01:44:23.035 --> 01:44:27.557
So I'm trying to be very gentle here, and perhaps I shouldn't be.

01:44:27.577 --> 01:44:38.862
It looks to me like we have another concerted bush of fear porn, and the cynics would say, or those of us perhaps that are increasingly awake,

01:44:39.489 --> 01:45:09.089
that this seems to be being manipulated for other purposes other than public health because the signs and indications are that this is a more infectious, equally or less highly pathogenic pair of variants, which absolutely do avoid increasingly the existing vaccines as predicted we would have by deploying a leaky vaccine into the teeth of an ongoing pandemic

01:45:09.835 --> 01:45:20.599
or epidemic, it is absolutely predictable that what you will get with a single-stranded RNA virus is virus that is able to more effectively evade the vaccine.

01:45:21.399 --> 01:45:23.420
And on top of that, we have this.

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:26.361
Of course, whoops, that's not what I wanted.

01:45:26.441 --> 01:45:26.801
Darn it.

01:45:26.841 --> 01:45:28.081
I had that ready to go.

01:45:28.601 --> 01:45:35.844
Of course, what that also means is this whole thing with, you know, Herod von den Bosch was completely correct, which is just hilarious.

01:45:35.904 --> 01:45:36.504
I mean, come on.

01:45:37.435 --> 01:45:48.098
problem of original antigenic sin or the effects of repeated boosting that have been well documented to understand.

01:45:48.598 --> 01:46:04.662
Make sure you understand that's the that's the narrative that I wrote in my review, worked on for five months under the tutelage help of whatever coaching of editing of Piper Stover, who probably was giving all of that to these scripted people.

01:46:05.549 --> 01:46:12.971
She was just one of these people who was working me, like Kevin McCarron did, like Paul Cottrell did, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:13.011 --> 01:46:15.872
did, like all of these people in Drastic did.

01:46:16.492 --> 01:46:35.138
I just happened to be one of the few people that's touched all of these individual actors because I kept seeing through them, all the way to Nick Hudson of Panda and Jonathan Engler of Heart, and the fraud of all frauds on the internet, really, Jessica Hockett from Chicago.

01:46:36.513 --> 01:46:39.554
These are the worst actors on the internet.

01:46:39.874 --> 01:46:48.977
And I'm afraid that Robert Malone and, you know, I don't know who Charlie Kirk is or where he went or what happened to him or whether he was shot and who shot him.

01:46:49.618 --> 01:46:57.620
But I know for sure that he was in the same network of actors that Robert Malone and Brian Hooker and Mary Holland have come involved in.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.221
And I know that in that network, people die.

01:47:02.162 --> 01:47:03.422
Brandy Vaughn died.

01:47:04.203 --> 01:47:05.423
Tony Bark died.

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:18.914
who result in the situation in which people who are repeatedly booted have a higher probability of clinical infection, hospitalization or death.

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:22.236
It's a paradox, but it's not for those of us who are immunologists.

01:47:23.237 --> 01:47:32.342
So the government is absolutely digging itself deeper and deeper into a hole and seems to be throwing a Hail Mary.

01:47:32.502 --> 01:47:36.945
Oh, we're going to magically make this new vaccine appear that will actually work.

01:47:37.625 --> 01:47:41.966
and it will be done in a short period of time, and you'll all have to take the jab.

01:47:43.006 --> 01:47:48.107
Dr. Malone, can you just comment on the lack of wisdom in our expert class?

01:47:48.267 --> 01:47:50.688
It's striking and scary, Dr. Malone.

01:47:51.608 --> 01:47:55.929
I would say what it seems to indicate is widespread conflicts of interest.

01:47:57.009 --> 01:47:58.530
Many people have wisdom.

01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:00.830
They may not share it with you.

01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:04.951
They may only talk about it with their friends or colleagues in private.

01:48:05.997 --> 01:48:12.182
I think we've seen a lot of examples of conflict of interest determining what people's public face is.

01:48:13.242 --> 01:48:22.549
We clearly have a failure of wisdom and insight and forethought in many of the responses of our federal government over these days.

01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:24.970
I think that's pretty rampant.

01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:31.735
And as a consequence, we're having rampant blowback, unintended consequences in every single sector.

01:48:36.674 --> 01:48:40.535
something that comes about just because you have deep knowledge.

01:48:41.296 --> 01:49:01.022
I think the passage of time and the school of hard knocks and a willingness to think deeply, look inside, and I think also recognize the value of the divine and the wisdom of the

01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:13.349
various teachings that we receive through the Judeo-Christian tradition and also help us in developing wisdom and I do my best.

01:49:14.687 --> 01:49:23.193
including seeking counsel from you from time to time to try to stay balanced and keep on track and not overreact.

01:49:23.213 --> 01:49:23.894
Stop lying!

01:49:23.914 --> 01:49:24.514
Stop lying!

01:49:24.995 --> 01:49:26.276
Stop lying!

01:49:26.456 --> 01:49:28.017
Stop lying!

01:49:28.037 --> 01:49:28.457
Stop lying!

01:49:28.597 --> 01:49:29.118
Stop lying!

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:57.170
Just a small town girl Livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy

01:50:15.168 --> 01:50:22.901
Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train going anywhere

01:50:43.473 --> 01:51:10.961
A singer in a smoky room The smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting Up and down the boulevard There's shadows searching in the night

01:51:14.847 --> 01:51:21.793
Streetlights, people, heaven must have found them all

01:51:44.002 --> 01:52:05.617
Everybody wants a thrill Paying anything to roll the dice Just one more time Some will win, some will lose Some of all just sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends

01:52:10.439 --> 01:52:34.002
Strangers waitin' Up and down the boulevard There are shadows searchin' in the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find a good time

01:52:58.476 --> 01:53:10.389
Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feeling Streetlight people Don't stop believin'

01:53:31.903 --> 01:53:36.318
Believe it Hold on to that feeling
