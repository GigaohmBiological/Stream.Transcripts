WEBVTT

00:04.233 --> 00:06.395
uh uh uh

00:30.773 --> 00:31.414
uh

01:07.643 --> 01:16.529
Concerned, but one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

01:18.789 --> 01:21.472
A condition that we will not call autism.

01:21.632 --> 01:23.174
I don't like the word autism.

01:24.075 --> 01:25.116
He was vaccine damaged.

01:25.497 --> 01:26.918
He was neurologically damaged.

01:27.659 --> 01:30.362
A condition that we will not call autism.

01:30.502 --> 01:32.044
I don't like the word autism.

01:32.945 --> 01:33.986
He was vaccine damaged.

01:34.006 --> 01:39.653
I think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:41.463 --> 01:42.183
And I have lied.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.224
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:43.244 --> 01:44.184
I don't want to lie.

01:44.664 --> 01:46.005
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.145
I try not to be a liar.

01:47.185 --> 01:48.026
I don't want to be a liar.

01:48.606 --> 01:51.367
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:59.491 --> 02:05.113
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:05.894 --> 02:25.281
know until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone you know and you know it's it's not it's you know measles plus and okay i can tolerate what you think about measles because you know not that many people die from it it's it's just a big hassle in the end but no when when we have this new pandemic that

02:25.709 --> 02:36.619
is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

02:36.679 --> 02:39.182
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

03:03.243 --> 03:14.872
This, this is serial passage and he said that their proposal was to use serial passage to alter or to perform these gain-of-function research experiments.

03:16.133 --> 03:16.894
Serial passage.

03:17.294 --> 03:23.038
The stuff that I just recently came to the conclusion probably wouldn't work to do what they say would work.

03:23.139 --> 03:27.522
Now these guys are telling you a story that that's exactly how it worked.

03:28.697 --> 03:48.798
has nothing to do with a shitty PCR test, has nothing to do with crappy protocols or lying to doctors about the danger or the amount of unhealthiness in America, the lack of vitamin D or putting hydroxychloroquine on the back burner or not allowing people to use ivermectin or

03:49.588 --> 03:54.110
None of these things matter to Charles Rixey and Andrew Huff.

03:54.150 --> 04:04.275
The only thing that matters is that Serial Passage works, and they proposed it in a proposal, and that obviously means that not only does it work, but they did it.

04:07.796 --> 04:11.538
And I'm telling you that a coronavirus can't sustain a pandemic.

04:23.103 --> 04:30.887
in such, and it's written so eloquently by Dr. Daszak, that you can't really tell that it's gain-of-function.

04:30.907 --> 04:39.972
So he avoids the specific term gain-of-function, but it's actually there in sort of eloquent scientific language.

04:41.213 --> 04:48.256
And that proposal was funded in 2013, and a number of interesting things happened with that proposal.

04:50.629 --> 04:57.680
Basically, without that work, without the USAID predict program, you wouldn't have the relationships in place to start doing this gain-of-function work.

04:59.758 --> 05:13.261
When this proposal, the understanding the risk of bat coronavirus emergence is submitted to NIH, a domestic ban on gain of function goes into place, which is sort of pushed by the White House and the Obama administration.

05:13.981 --> 05:24.743
So all these things are happening simultaneously, but basically they find a way to outsource the research outside the control of the United States domestically to do the work.

05:25.824 --> 05:27.664
Yeah, but just to clarify,

05:28.410 --> 05:41.358
when they made their proposals to Antony Fauci and his government departments, they were understanding what this funding was for.

05:41.398 --> 05:44.099
I mean, Antony Fauci was himself a scientist.

05:44.499 --> 05:48.942
When he reads a proposal like that, he understands that this is gain-of-functioning

05:49.022 --> 06:05.466
Yes, he understands that what they are going to imply with it is that coronavirus is potentially dangerous to the entire world and therefore requires an emergency use authorized rollout of new technologies that otherwise would not have been able to bring to market.

06:06.147 --> 06:11.028
Just like that 2019 video where he says we might have to do it in a very disruptive way.

06:14.805 --> 06:23.514
I can't implore you enough to see that the narrative that they are leading Kim.com through is the exact narrative they always intended to tell.

06:25.393 --> 06:30.435
It's the exact narrative that Tony Fauci's emails were intended for you to buy.

06:31.015 --> 06:45.019
And that's why both sides of the equation, the people out there that thinks that this is real pandemic and that the vaccines work great and that everybody should take them, all of those people now believe it's a laboratory leak.

06:46.779 --> 06:50.000
And all the people on the dissonance side believe it's a laboratory leak.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.601
And now mission accomplished.

06:51.721 --> 06:54.762
Nobody understands that coronavirus could never have done this.

06:55.922 --> 07:20.383
there was never any danger really except for wherever a clone might have been released and it could have been released in Iran and Wuhan wherever absolutely could have been but it cannot be the point release of a clone at a minimum quantity that spontaneously through normal RNA viral swarming spread around the world for three years that is impossible

07:23.018 --> 07:49.163
And it doesn't matter what set of genes you put together, it doesn't matter how crafty you are, the virus will eventually return to a quasi-species defined by the minimum required replication-competent genome, plus maybe a few genes which impart a noticeable fitness advantage to those virions that have them.

07:50.469 --> 07:58.971
But even then, we are talking about a much more complex gene sorting and genetic entity than what is a RNA infectious clone.

07:58.991 --> 08:06.773
And the only thing we understand from a laboratory perspective, and a countermeasure perspective, and from an immunological perspective.

08:08.193 --> 08:10.414
And the reason why is because that's the way they like it.

08:18.820 --> 08:33.686
I just wonder if it's not important here just to point out, oh darn it, the progression that I feel like I have made that other people haven't made in this same space.

08:34.406 --> 08:37.187
Hopefully this will be in focus.

08:38.367 --> 08:47.771
You have a situation where you have people that are masquerading as anti-vax people, as health freedom people who have

08:48.925 --> 08:58.929
come to the conclusion that this fight should be fought on the front of freedom, on the front of free speech, and on the front of free choice.

09:01.269 --> 09:16.475
And by sticking to those very abstract ideas and fighting for a big top tent of health freedom, none of these people have made any progression in their understanding of what we're actually up against.

09:17.830 --> 09:24.515
And that is precisely the same lack of progression that occurs if you jump to the conclusion that there are no viruses at all.

09:26.076 --> 09:33.922
And just go on talking about the invisible rainbow and go on talking about how water at the molecular level is organized.

09:33.962 --> 09:35.583
Yeah, good, thanks.

09:37.165 --> 09:40.547
Look, these guys, this is the end of 2022.

09:43.271 --> 09:43.631
Okay.

09:44.091 --> 09:45.972
This is when I'm just figuring it out.

09:46.032 --> 09:53.935
This, I just said that I just recently figured out that I don't think serial passage could do any of the things they claim it could do.

09:54.395 --> 10:02.118
And I had just recently made that, that graphic where I said that that wasn't possible in animals or in cell culture.

10:02.138 --> 10:04.059
I was taking a big risk at that time.

10:04.139 --> 10:10.181
From my perspective, I thought I was going out on a limb and you know, somebody would correct me or that's kind of what I hoped.

10:12.199 --> 10:13.940
And this is in December of 2022.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.862
This is when I'm still working for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:18.082 --> 10:19.943
I haven't been hired at CHD yet.

10:24.185 --> 10:30.068
So, this is still this narrative spinning out of control.

10:30.149 --> 10:32.390
There's a time here where he's going to talk about

10:33.464 --> 10:40.692
evaluating a proposal for EcoHealth Alliance, and he's going to say, I'm really surprised that they wanted me to review that.

10:40.753 --> 10:48.021
He's changing a script to fit the terrible place that they are, the off-rails

10:49.153 --> 11:11.930
way out of bounds place that they are, where they're trying to recover a narrative that was supposed to be pretty easy to lay down, that a gain-of-function virus with all these different inserts had bypassed 100,000 years of evolution to become the most infectious coronavirus we've ever found, which is supposed to be a narrative that hides that none of that is possible.

11:14.881 --> 11:23.808
that intramuscular injection is never medicine, that they've just been, well, they've been lying to us.

11:25.669 --> 11:43.483
And this is all they had left back in 2022 was people like Andrew Huff, who has a Skyhorse publishing book, Charles Rixey, who has a Excel sheet, and this guy who apparently has a website because his name is .com.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.027
Right?

11:47.828 --> 11:48.529
Oh, absolutely.

11:48.549 --> 11:51.311
And so you look at it from my personal perspective.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.673
So this is my field.

11:53.073 --> 11:57.617
Gain of function has been a hot debate ever since ferrets started dying from H1N1.

11:59.379 --> 12:03.202
Ever since ferrets started dying from H1N1.

12:03.242 --> 12:07.106
I mean, the jokes are too thick for 2022 frog throat Cooey to even follow.

12:12.608 --> 12:17.729
The narrative is still too thick for this guy right here in the white hat to even follow yet.

12:18.430 --> 12:23.211
I'm still trying to compute how much of this is gonna really fall apart.

12:23.671 --> 12:35.334
I'm still considering the possibility in 2022, in December of 2022, if you look at my notebooks, I'm actually considering the possibility that Bailey and them are not so wrong after all.

12:36.415 --> 12:37.715
That's where I am right now.

12:39.861 --> 12:48.544
That's how honest this intellectual progression, this journey through hell that I've been on, where I thought I knew everything in 2020.

12:48.944 --> 12:55.067
I thought I was in the top 1% of people who understood the real big questions in biology.

12:59.308 --> 13:02.510
And I was lost like all my other academic colleagues.

13:02.550 --> 13:06.131
And I've come a long way in these five years because of the hard work I put in.

13:07.657 --> 13:16.081
And now I find myself really trying hard to catch myself in a mistake because I haven't made one in a very long time.

13:17.162 --> 13:22.964
And I know only one person on earth besides me that feels that way right now, and that's Mark Kulak.

13:24.105 --> 13:29.007
So if you've been following me or you've been following him, I hope you're enjoying the show.

13:29.047 --> 13:30.168
It's about to get a lot better.

13:33.642 --> 13:39.565
50% of the scientists in my field agree with it, and 50% of the scientists in the field disagree with it.

13:39.805 --> 13:47.689
So this is his field, and what he's specifically saying is that some virologists think we should do gain-of-function, and some people think we shouldn't.

13:48.249 --> 13:53.252
And the ones who think we shouldn't know that it's super dangerous and could potentially kill everybody.

13:53.692 --> 13:56.353
Again, just on narrative.

13:56.914 --> 13:59.575
Nothing about RNA-infectious clones being even better.

14:02.148 --> 14:03.028
Like, that's the point.

14:03.588 --> 14:12.270
If you released a small amount of the most dangerous coronavirus that Peter Daszak could have conceived, it would never go around the earth.

14:13.210 --> 14:29.953
The only way that it could go around the earth is insufficient quantities, and these guys either are too unsophisticated to understand that, or they are purposefully telling you a story that they've been telling you consistently for more than a year and a half without pivot, without flex.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.891
I used to call it a very brittle narrative.

14:34.552 --> 14:36.154
Because that's what I hear here.

14:36.334 --> 14:40.538
A very brittle narrative that involves the same Scooby-Doo nonsense.

14:40.578 --> 14:41.840
They were tapping my phone.

14:42.300 --> 14:45.364
They were sending drones over my property.

14:45.804 --> 14:48.167
They were trying to stop the selling of my book.

14:51.806 --> 15:00.048
And now, for some reason, they've decided to promote these guys on a platform like Kim.com and let it sit on Twitter.

15:00.809 --> 15:01.429
It's fine.

15:02.229 --> 15:03.409
But I can't be back on.

15:04.129 --> 15:05.190
I can't be discussed.

15:05.610 --> 15:10.531
Charles will never mention me again, even though supposedly we were allies for more than a year.

15:11.392 --> 15:19.394
Charles will never say that I'm a intelligent, smart guy anymore, even though we were supposedly friends for more than a year.

15:19.454 --> 15:19.894
He won't.

15:22.110 --> 15:33.124
Because I'm going against the narrative that he is, for whatever reason, sure needs to be sustained, defended, and accentuated over all other parts of the narrative.

15:33.584 --> 15:37.008
No PCR discussion, no sequencing discussion, no treatment discussion.

15:37.629 --> 16:06.603
no censorship discussion nothing in fact he can't talk about the censorship anymore because he the first three things i mentioned there are just i mean it's it's like i keep hitting the home run over and over because i say pcr sequencing protocols pcr sequencing protocols the pcr was fake the sequencing of the virus is fake and the protocols are bullshit probably murdered well i will say very soon after this date this is more

16:07.486 --> 16:09.067
than two and a half years ago.

16:10.688 --> 16:16.953
More than two and a half years ago that these people have known I've been around saying this stuff and angry about it.

16:17.433 --> 16:20.936
And their solution to that problem was to tell everybody he's just angry.

16:20.956 --> 16:22.277
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

16:22.998 --> 16:24.999
And everybody's had the same solution.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.242
It's a, it's a remarkable place we're in right now.

16:28.362 --> 16:33.966
He's seeing a huge rise in his stardom and that of Andrew Huff.

16:36.556 --> 16:41.117
I still have 2000 followers on Twitch after, come on.

16:43.358 --> 16:44.678
It's right in front of your face.

16:44.738 --> 16:45.799
All you got to do is see it.

16:49.099 --> 16:50.580
All you got to do is see it.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.860
Boy, that guy was right.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.001
Oh my goodness.

16:53.041 --> 16:53.721
Was he right?

16:54.301 --> 16:58.162
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

17:00.012 --> 17:00.712
And I have lied.

17:00.732 --> 17:01.773
I'm sure I'll lie again.

17:01.793 --> 17:02.713
I don't want to lie.

17:02.733 --> 17:04.553
I don't think I'm a liar.

17:04.653 --> 17:05.694
I try not to be a liar.

17:05.734 --> 17:06.574
I don't want to be a liar.

17:07.154 --> 17:09.915
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

17:14.897 --> 17:19.778
I will have some extra homework for you, Housatonic, for being 15 minutes late.

17:19.838 --> 17:20.778
Thanks for being here.

17:20.878 --> 17:22.679
Thanks for joining on the show, everybody.

17:22.739 --> 17:25.100
Good to see everyone in the chat.

17:25.180 --> 17:25.540
It's June 3, 2025.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.900
This is Gigo and Biological.

17:35.348 --> 17:55.764
I don't care how you get there.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.486
I don't care what you do to get there.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.068
The goal is to live.

18:15.506 --> 18:17.567
Well, good morning everybody.

18:17.627 --> 18:18.388
Welcome to the show.

18:18.408 --> 18:24.053
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

18:25.134 --> 18:29.836
I'm sure you find yourself right in the middle of your daily grind, your hamster wheel.

18:29.856 --> 18:40.099
I am very blessed to have this show be a part of my daily grind as well as some on the hardwood time with my sons every day.

18:40.119 --> 18:47.061
I live quite an awesome little temporary existence right now.

18:47.121 --> 18:48.842
I understand how temporary it is.

18:49.582 --> 19:05.141
because so much of what I'm doing is dependent on social media and yet at the same time I feel in my heart it is imperative that I urge you to get your children off of social media now and to start more vigilantly

19:06.442 --> 19:22.386
not using social media because it is only through social media that myths like the autism spectrum disorder will be sustained to make sure that kids never question intramuscular injection, never question virology, never question public health.

19:22.847 --> 19:31.369
In fact, social media is the only way that the pandemic and the gain-of-function myth have been seeded so successfully in our minds.

19:32.369 --> 19:34.851
And if you don't understand the trap you're in, you won't get out.

19:35.372 --> 19:38.514
The cheese is free on social media because that is the trap.

19:39.795 --> 19:42.517
And it is an illusion we are in right now.

19:42.677 --> 19:46.120
Even the folding of proteins is an illusion.

19:46.700 --> 19:53.806
And the biology that they will ignore forever because we are the opposite of what they're doing is gigaohm biological

19:54.386 --> 19:55.967
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

19:56.027 --> 20:02.630
I hope I can get you a little closer to walking in the right direction, climbing your way out of this cave.

20:03.331 --> 20:06.552
I do really believe that biology is the way out.

20:07.213 --> 20:08.814
I really do think that

20:09.914 --> 20:10.675
It is important.

20:11.356 --> 20:11.916
Who am I?

20:11.996 --> 20:12.997
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.059
I'm Chief Biologist at Giga Owen Biological.

20:15.600 --> 20:21.245
You can find my previous work and career evidence on the National Library of PubMed.

20:22.166 --> 20:27.090
And you can find some of my work distorted pretty poorly on a substack called Woodhouse 76.

20:28.431 --> 20:31.173
I'm quoted six times in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

20:31.133 --> 20:35.516
's Wuhan cover-up book, and I used to be good friends with Jayanta Bhattacharya.

20:35.576 --> 20:45.043
I have a YouTube channel called JC on a Bike, which is a wonderful history of my thinking during the pandemic, especially when I was still employed by the University of Pittsburgh.

20:45.063 --> 20:51.888
So I've stopped streaming there, and instead I am on a channel called JC in the Woods.

20:52.762 --> 20:54.645
You can find me there right now live, I believe.

20:54.785 --> 21:04.161
Don't be afraid to check that out and maybe even use that as a way of sharing my work because some people are afraid to go to stream.gigaohm.bio.

21:04.201 --> 21:04.862
It looks funny.

21:05.796 --> 21:09.659
There's no place to sign up, and so they don't trust it as much as YouTube.

21:09.759 --> 21:16.603
So maybe a way to introduce people in America to me and other places is to use JC in the Woods or JC on a bike.

21:16.663 --> 21:18.585
It's just that I'm not going to be live there anymore.

21:20.346 --> 21:26.030
If you are here for the first time, you might be a skilled TV watcher or a skilled social media user.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.912
But I assure you, if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave.

21:29.952 --> 21:35.236
There isn't very many other places besides Gigaohm where you can stay focused on the biology.

21:35.296 --> 21:37.797
We're not taking the bait on social media.

21:38.478 --> 21:42.461
And we're trying to learn to love our neighbors, trying to figure out who they are, for goodness sakes.

21:43.261 --> 21:47.584
The way this works is we've got a few people, about 110 people, that give money to the stream.

21:47.644 --> 21:49.826
Some small, a few people give quite a bit.

21:50.723 --> 21:55.704
And that results in a family of five having a father that has a news program.

21:55.925 --> 22:00.766
That's basically the narrative, the story.

22:01.266 --> 22:03.187
It's the best I can do in an elevator pitch.

22:03.667 --> 22:07.088
I've got a website, gigombiological.com.

22:08.137 --> 22:15.601
I've got a soapbox at gigaohm.bio, and I've got this peer tube thing at stream.gigaohm.bio.

22:15.641 --> 22:17.021
And then I've got this link, Stuff.

22:17.141 --> 22:25.606
Basically, Stuff is the link you need, because that's where you can find the stuff that you can download, the papers we're reading, the population pyramid report.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.428
And you can go to Gigaohm Biological and find a way to support me too.

22:29.508 --> 22:31.609
But right now, I need people to share.

22:33.169 --> 22:34.230
It's the beginning of the month.

22:34.310 --> 22:37.591
Monthly rent is paid so I don't need to raise a lot of money here today.

22:38.352 --> 22:39.773
What I need to do is get the word out.

22:39.873 --> 22:42.714
So let's keep building the independent bright web.

22:42.794 --> 22:49.497
Let's keep spreading the word about this imaginary script that these people are following on social media.

22:49.517 --> 22:52.218
You got to remember it's not just one of these dudes.

22:52.278 --> 22:57.441
It's hundreds of them on social media and it's our use of social media that allows them to perform this

22:58.141 --> 23:02.084
And more importantly, allows us to feel like we're helping them stop the train.

23:02.805 --> 23:03.625
And you're really not.

23:03.945 --> 23:08.829
And it doesn't matter if you also chalk up your hands or, you know, even if you got big gloves on.

23:08.849 --> 23:09.529
It doesn't matter.

23:11.091 --> 23:12.291
This is a script.

23:12.772 --> 23:14.193
These people are scripted.

23:14.793 --> 23:22.099
There's no other explanation for Brett Weinstein's lies and Heather Weinstein's lies about me, lies of my omission.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.121
other than this is a scripted bullshit show.

23:25.721 --> 23:47.355
And it is no different than the scripted bullshit show that is the Tommy podcast, where many of these meddlers have shown up many times, including Robert Malone himself, along with several co-shows with Steven Hatfield, probably one of the most treacherous and untrustworthy people in this narrative.

23:48.235 --> 23:50.998
that few people talk about, but actually he's a nuclear bomb.

23:52.218 --> 23:57.263
He's a millstone around the neck of all of these people, just like Sasha Latupova is, essentially.

23:58.223 --> 24:05.990
Also just an admission of guilt, of traitorism, or at least of being puppeteered by people who are definitely traitors.

24:06.730 --> 24:08.791
And so that's how we got Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:08.951 --> 24:10.532
at HHS Secretary.

24:10.592 --> 24:14.833
It's a combination of a media stunt, Steve Bannon with two Ns.

24:14.933 --> 24:15.314
Darn it.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.294
What is that all about?

24:16.834 --> 24:18.615
How come nobody ever corrected that before?

24:18.655 --> 24:19.595
It's two Ns, right?

24:20.596 --> 24:21.476
I think it's two Ns.

24:21.536 --> 24:23.677
I'm going to reshuffle that out there.

24:24.137 --> 24:28.259
Brett Weinstein and his dad and his brother, Robert Malone and his wife,

24:29.319 --> 24:36.502
Kevin McKernan and his associates that include people like Rob, Jessica Rose and Pierre Corey, etc.

24:37.423 --> 24:38.903
You did correct me on that before.

24:38.943 --> 24:40.524
Maybe you did, but I missed it.

24:40.564 --> 24:41.144
I'm sorry.

24:41.344 --> 24:48.087
Left-hand monkey wrench would be the guy to correct me because he's in the chat like all the time and one of the first.

24:49.308 --> 24:49.968
Don't forget.

24:51.989 --> 24:53.029
Don't forget this.

24:53.129 --> 24:54.270
This is all a big show.

24:55.762 --> 25:08.866
That's what we're really, that's the message we're really trying to put out in the last few shows, is this is all just a really big, slightly reduced size show.

25:09.026 --> 25:09.947
That's better.

25:12.608 --> 25:21.651
And so yesterday, we took a look at this, you know, what can now only be recognized as a pathetic performance by this guy.

25:23.514 --> 25:38.408
and this guy, who is now at the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a quite powerful position in the FDA, which we have come to the conclusion seems to be the target of a sabotage operation.

25:38.468 --> 25:46.676
More or less, they seem to be either eliminating the FDA, purposely running the FDA into the ground, or undermining its previous

25:48.012 --> 25:50.193
reasonably well understood mandate.

25:50.693 --> 25:54.655
Now, I said this yesterday, but I want to repeat it again at the beginning of this stream.

25:56.256 --> 26:12.124
It cannot be underestimated how important it is to hear and see and document for yourself that from the very beginning of the pandemic, people on all sides of the narrative were discussing the question of safe, safety, and effectivity.

26:12.564 --> 26:13.405
Safe and effective.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.105
Is something safe and effective?

26:15.145 --> 26:15.706
What does that mean?

26:17.403 --> 26:32.962
And that very discussion should not be dismissed as just people on the same script, because that script specifically applies to concepts and their definition, which pertain specifically to the mandate of the FDA.

26:34.443 --> 26:39.567
And so that script cannot be just dismissed as a script with convenient words.

26:40.128 --> 26:53.038
It's with words which have exact meaning for, coincidentally, what these guys are now talking about with reference to, is America really better off after 50 years of the FDA or not?

26:54.019 --> 26:55.600
That's a question worth considering.

26:55.801 --> 26:57.622
Isn't it, my Indian friend?

26:58.203 --> 27:00.565
Yes, my Indian friend, it is worth considering.

27:00.905 --> 27:02.146
It's a very deep question.

27:05.069 --> 27:08.263
So I am a little bit alarmed that I have to bring this message.

27:08.323 --> 27:08.865
It feels...

27:09.793 --> 27:34.505
Quite frankly, from my 50 years of brutal multicultural training that started in college and pretty much went through until I was out of academia, it feels almost racist to point out how many Indian people are currently in American government, seemingly rising to fame and prestige and apparently also very podcast notoriety.

27:35.565 --> 27:38.286
And I can't dismiss it anymore.

27:38.326 --> 27:39.367
I'm sorry, but I can't.

27:39.427 --> 27:46.470
Because this guy, as an anecdote, I guess I could kind of tolerate, except I just don't believe him.

27:47.010 --> 27:48.491
I don't believe his resume.

27:48.811 --> 27:50.112
I don't believe his history.

27:50.532 --> 27:55.634
And I don't believe this shtick that he puts on now any more than I believe this guy's shtick.

27:58.996 --> 28:22.234
And it's maybe easy to see one of these people as frauds, but once you start to see them all as interwoven together frauds, interwoven together scripted bullshit, and realize that for the last five years, and certainly the last five years since I realized that it was a population pyramid thing.

28:23.815 --> 28:26.557
And the reason why I realized that in 2021 had something to do with this

28:29.815 --> 28:35.580
this geopolitics guy with the beard that always talks about China and India.

28:35.640 --> 28:50.752
He talks a lot about the population pyramids and whether China's gonna collapse or not and this kind of thing, but it never dawned on me until, it's Peter something, I think, but yes, Peter Zelhan, that's his name.

28:51.312 --> 28:57.877
And I was watching one of his videos and it dawned on me, holy shit, wait, if the population pyramids are inverted,

28:58.758 --> 29:05.602
and this is a problem for economies, then a way to manage it would be murder and lies.

29:06.162 --> 29:11.865
And it suddenly snapped in my head why Denny Rancourt

29:12.754 --> 29:14.656
was where he is.

29:14.996 --> 29:16.658
It suddenly snapped in my head.

29:17.198 --> 29:18.399
What is he up to?

29:18.459 --> 29:19.260
What is he doing?

29:19.300 --> 29:22.323
And it made perfect sense to me from that moment on.

29:22.783 --> 29:32.052
And then trying to articulate, and more importantly, trying to imagine in my head, realistically, how much of a signal it could be.

29:33.903 --> 29:38.548
And when you see this map here, and you see the signal that's coming.

29:38.608 --> 29:42.231
Now look, this is 65 to 69 right there.

29:42.391 --> 29:45.955
And we have the line is right about at 4 million people.

29:46.595 --> 29:52.801
So 4 million people are in retirement age in America right now in that five year category.

29:53.562 --> 29:58.626
and they have stopped paying taxes and they've started drawing on social security.

29:58.806 --> 30:03.930
And if they're sick or need medications or whatever, they're drawing on Medicare and Medicaid.

30:04.450 --> 30:05.971
And that is right there.

30:06.011 --> 30:11.295
So if we start the advancement at 4 million, this right above the A there.

30:11.696 --> 30:15.138
And if you go over to this side, you can see it's 65 to 69.

30:15.198 --> 30:16.799
And then where my finger is 60 to 64 is at

30:20.396 --> 30:21.377
about six million.

30:21.417 --> 30:24.679
Now just watch as this bump moves upward.

30:25.079 --> 30:27.721
This is not math that no one could do.

30:27.741 --> 30:31.043
This is not math that no one bothered to do.

30:31.563 --> 30:40.149
More importantly, this is the most important math that any of the ruling class people can do.

30:41.365 --> 30:51.613
It's also coincidentally some of the most important math that any military strategist would be doing if they were trying to think about their adversaries in the future.

30:53.054 --> 31:06.264
Because an adversary with an inverted pyramid and a very awful inverted pyramid might be in big trouble and it might not be a big deal if they build up their military and have a bunch of planes that nobody can fly or maintain.

31:09.488 --> 31:14.531
Watch the carefully how it goes from 6 million and 4 million.

31:16.812 --> 31:17.892
Now it's growing already.

31:17.932 --> 31:19.113
Look at that one right there.

31:19.173 --> 31:20.354
Look at it exploding.

31:21.294 --> 31:26.457
Those are all people who are stopping paying taxes and starting to pull taxes out especially.

31:26.477 --> 31:27.357
I mean, look at that.

31:28.017 --> 31:30.319
Look at these age groups expanding there.

31:30.839 --> 31:36.962
There is nothing else to see but a biological certainty that with

31:38.055 --> 31:44.137
A bunch of people on social media on the same script they were able to use to get away with murder.

31:47.378 --> 31:52.019
And as I said yesterday, I'll repeat again, this population report would have come out in 2020.

31:52.099 --> 31:57.820
The signal that we were about to see would be obvious in it, but instead it came out in 2025.

31:58.941 --> 32:05.562
And the signal that we're talking about that was especially pronounced in many other smaller Western nations is now gone.

32:06.123 --> 32:07.263
How convenient is that?

32:12.304 --> 32:17.186
And so we have a list, and I think it is a very succinct explanation for what happened.

32:17.306 --> 32:34.475
Number one, because again, remember, in a system-wide orchestration that ends up in a signal that you can barely see on that background of dark red there of all-cause mortality, but it can only see it if you show it the way the PBS NewsHour shows it.

32:36.638 --> 32:53.208
that was sculpted that was number one expected because you can see it here and i'll show you very clearly the dip here is at 50 000 and if we get up here over there at the end of the graph i'll use my arrow put the arrow over here that right there is almost at 60 000 so the dip

32:55.109 --> 32:59.633
every year in the summertime went from below 50,000 with a maximum of around 60,000 or maybe 70,000 in 2016.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.134
Look, these numbers have changed, but the dip here, it's not going below 60,000 anymore.

33:13.911 --> 33:17.533
So the rise in all cause mortality is still really available.

33:17.593 --> 33:18.633
It's visible right here.

33:18.673 --> 33:21.014
And what did Denny Rancourt do specifically?

33:21.515 --> 33:29.999
He went around the world declaring that there was no increase in all cause mortality until after the shots were rolled out.

33:32.160 --> 33:32.880
Stop lying.

33:33.380 --> 33:41.644
That's exactly what he said while he was on stage with Robert Malone and Steven Hatfill and all these people in Romania in November of 2023.

33:44.775 --> 33:47.777
These people are not just traitors to their own nations.

33:47.837 --> 33:50.518
They are traitors to all the grandchildren of earth.

33:52.220 --> 34:03.346
They are traitors because they, they are aware that they are part of an elaborate ruse and they think they're going to get a seat on the arc, whatever that is.

34:04.487 --> 34:06.368
They think they're going to get special treatment.

34:06.388 --> 34:08.029
They think they're going to get 10 Bitcoin.

34:08.049 --> 34:09.470
They think they're going to get something.

34:12.304 --> 34:23.916
because this explanation has been available and has been trumpeted from the rooftops for more than two and a half years now.

34:24.156 --> 34:35.047
Understand the video that I started this stream with is a video that completely and totally predates my friendship with Jessica Hockett.

34:37.130 --> 34:48.180
which was a renewed relationship between the head guys at Panda, Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson and their friend, Martin Neal.

34:50.282 --> 34:57.448
That video with Kim.com and Rick C and Huff, his before Jessica Hockett ever even reached out to me.

34:59.619 --> 35:05.104
Think about how remarkable that is, how much of this bullshit is still to come after December of 2022.

35:05.305 --> 35:09.208
And in December of 2022, I was already here.

35:10.970 --> 35:17.016
Mark was already pointing out that, look, the opioid deaths are creating a signal that everybody is ignoring.

35:17.076 --> 35:21.040
And it's a really important signal because it's a drop in life expectancy.

35:23.888 --> 35:31.851
that would never otherwise be present if it wasn't for this opioid crisis being allowed to just go on in the background.

35:32.471 --> 35:36.052
Because, you know, it just affects people that nobody cares about anyway.

35:36.472 --> 35:38.813
It's the attitude that people like Meryl Nass have.

35:41.254 --> 35:45.475
It's the attitude that a lot of these elites or would-be elites have.

35:46.595 --> 35:48.516
Because it's the attitude you have to take.

35:49.525 --> 36:04.955
if you're gonna assume that murder and lies might be necessary to govern the United States during this crucial transition period, this crucial population transitional period.

36:06.796 --> 36:18.884
You can see it very clearly, you can hear it very clearly if you sit down at a table with these people and they explain to you that there is an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, that if it's not properly managed, could actually bankrupt our country.

36:20.174 --> 36:42.258
And the transition to a population pyramid that's a little more off balance over the next 30 years could cost us everything, or we could use it to our favor to try and reorganize the whole Western world around a pseudo-global governance structure where nation states are kind of dependent on one another and govern, you know, kind of like the EU.

36:44.813 --> 36:55.239
And if you want to be in on it, you want to be in on the transition to this digital currency, you might want to be in on this national security thing because we're just going to ask somebody else if you don't want to join in.

36:55.739 --> 37:00.382
And all you really got to do is just not say anything about the opioid crisis for a while.

37:00.982 --> 37:15.212
And if you're Jessica Rose, all you gotta do is just do a podcast or two where you say that you've done some research and you don't think it's the opioid crisis at all that's responsible for the reduction in life expectancy in America.

37:15.352 --> 37:16.813
It doesn't seem to be that at all.

37:17.153 --> 37:29.341
And if you're Pierre Corey, you just have to go on Jimmy Dore and laugh about it and make jokes about the fact that, you know, unless these crispy chips were introduced in the third quarter of 2021, I don't think so.

37:38.411 --> 37:48.724
And so what's so dark about that one particular little clip that Housatonic has been so good about accentuating is that it also kind of pre

37:51.712 --> 38:13.162
It hints at the idea that what's coming in the next year is this pivot of this health freedom movement from not even really focusing on the COVID shot anymore, but focusing on seed oils and petroleum-based dyes and all this other nonsense that they've now got people running in a hamster wheel about and kept them there for the last three or four months.

38:14.571 --> 38:20.316
And so what I find so striking about that December, 2022 videos, I'm still already very good.

38:20.476 --> 38:40.173
I've already started to always rank order my replies so that when I'm critiquing Huff or I'm critiquing Rixey, what I specifically say is they don't say anything about PCR testing fraud or lateral flow testing fraud or sequencing fraud, or

38:40.914 --> 38:42.295
the deadly protocols.

38:42.875 --> 38:45.377
They just talk about gain-of-function viruses.

38:45.557 --> 38:49.940
Gain-of-function viruses, gain-of-function research needs to be prohibited.

38:50.020 --> 38:54.043
And so I could see it already in December of 2022.

38:54.723 --> 38:59.967
There was just more progress to be made in understanding the limits of molecular biology.

38:59.987 --> 39:02.068
And I'm still making progress on that front.

39:02.768 --> 39:07.051
If I wasn't, I would already be teaching the course and I would already have it there.

39:07.091 --> 39:08.872
But I'm making sure that

39:10.094 --> 39:13.696
I go forward and I'm in shape to do what I'm about to do.

39:14.457 --> 39:24.342
I only would be here if it wasn't for the very, very strong work of Mark Kulak out of Boston at HousatonicITS.com.

39:25.023 --> 39:26.704
If you're not following him, please do.

39:27.124 --> 39:36.970
Of all of the people that I put up on this little screen here of meddlers, I've had personal interaction with almost all of them, and I think the only way that they have power

39:37.490 --> 39:40.013
is because on social media they can perform.

39:40.453 --> 39:49.923
And so if you don't use social media, you can't be spellbound by their interactions with each other, by their arguments with each other, by their backstabbing each other.

39:49.983 --> 39:50.984
It all goes away.

39:51.965 --> 39:58.131
And you'll never be possibly caught up arguing with one person in their many anonymous fake accounts.

39:58.972 --> 40:17.109
uh all of which happens in condition that we will not call autism i don't like the word autism um he was vaccine damaged and it all happens because on social media there's children's health defense people and health council for health people and brownstone people that are agreeing with wellness company people or

40:17.689 --> 40:34.458
arguing that wellness company people are shady, and promoting heart and panda people, or ICANN people that are promoting children's health defense people, or the Canadian Inquiry just has to do a few more interviews and they'll finally have their 10,000 page report on how the hell this happened.

40:35.298 --> 40:43.943
And the FLCC Alliance, Honest Medicine by trademark, has become Independent Medical Alliance, you know,

40:45.017 --> 40:47.258
This is what social media allows to happen.

40:47.318 --> 40:54.401
None of these organizations, none of these nonprofits, none of these rescue the Republic, join the resistance.

40:55.481 --> 40:58.062
None of this stuff would have happened without of social media.

40:59.483 --> 41:10.347
They would have never been able to accomplish any of this nonsense if there wasn't social media to make it look like it was cool, make it look like they had momentum, make it look like that the word about vaccines was getting out.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.511
I assure you, it's still not getting out.

41:15.551 --> 41:18.193
The only people that hear it are the people that already have heard it.

41:18.953 --> 41:24.717
Just like on your social media site, this is the best test that you can do, okay?

41:27.219 --> 41:29.840
How much on social media do you see of the NBA?

41:31.761 --> 41:35.824
How much on social media do you see of a particular baseball team?

41:37.042 --> 41:56.193
Because I will offer you the possibility to understand that some people, because of the way that they engage with social media, see a lot of NBA stuff and a lot of a particular NFL football team or a National League baseball team.

41:58.214 --> 42:00.636
Or maybe they get a lot about the Colorado Buffaloes.

42:03.993 --> 42:10.035
And you and I have been working hard in a particular way to interact with social media in a particular way.

42:10.055 --> 42:21.460
And what we get, if we are just getting the output of a machine learning algorithm that is somewhat adaptive to our choices, then we're getting whatever keeps us there.

42:21.700 --> 42:28.363
And in this particular case, it might just be this kaleidoscope of shitheads.

42:29.551 --> 42:33.613
that has a very, very prominent presence on social media.

42:33.653 --> 42:49.860
And so if you're interested in following Jikki Leaks and the rest of this mouse army, then I bet you, you've seen a lot of Brownstone retweets and you've seen a lot of door to freedom stuff and you know, the world council for health and all of their worldwide chapters make sense to you.

42:52.861 --> 43:00.867
But if you like the Pittsburgh Pirates and you like to argue about the batting averages of certain people and whether they matter or not, then you're gonna see a lot of that on social media.

43:01.407 --> 43:05.770
But if you're like me or Mark Kulak, you will see virtually nothing of anybody.

43:07.811 --> 43:08.892
And nobody will see you.

43:10.854 --> 43:14.536
But because you can only scroll through one list, you don't know that.

43:14.616 --> 43:15.617
No one can see that.

43:15.657 --> 43:16.858
It seems like it's working.

43:16.898 --> 43:19.860
Yeah, I get a lot of ads, but oh yeah, there's one guy I know.

43:20.660 --> 43:21.421
It doesn't matter.

43:23.083 --> 43:26.486
You might as well be in a phone booth, screaming and yelling.

43:27.667 --> 43:29.629
It's as easy as a few variables.

43:29.669 --> 43:37.935
They just switch those off and switch those on and it feels just the same to you, but nobody can hear and see you at all and nobody cares.

43:39.457 --> 43:46.463
And these people operate on the opposite side of that system, where their accounts are amplified.

43:47.691 --> 44:01.999
where the anonymous bot accounts and the anonymous accounts which are maintained by real people are all supportive of their work and their ideas and that games the algorithm in a known way because they're instructed how to game the algorithm.

44:04.721 --> 44:12.265
And not that we can't figure out how to game the algorithm, but it doesn't have to work for us the way it works for them when it's programmed to work for them.

44:13.015 --> 44:18.481
And you've got to get it in your head that social media has been programmed to work against us.

44:18.682 --> 44:20.924
It is not a free press.

44:21.405 --> 44:24.288
It is not a town square.

44:24.448 --> 44:28.653
Social media is a military programmed control suite.

44:30.335 --> 44:33.559
It is a narrative control software.

44:34.591 --> 44:42.696
And there's just different versions of them that they've tricked us into thinking, oh, Gab's gonna be free this time, or Locals is where the real free people are working.

44:43.217 --> 44:44.317
No, no, it's Substack.

44:44.397 --> 44:46.459
Substack is where all the free press is.

44:50.281 --> 44:52.302
And that's why she's on X now.

44:55.324 --> 44:57.906
That's why Pauly Tommy is still working.

45:02.977 --> 45:03.278
Darn it.

45:03.318 --> 45:05.480
I gotta always it always runs out right there.

45:05.520 --> 45:05.920
It's funny.

45:07.221 --> 45:22.335
That's why Pauly Tommy is still working Because that's why Brian hooker is still working not just he's just saying autism just building a big health tent of health freedom Same as Mary Holland.

45:22.355 --> 45:23.156
They're not they're not

45:24.428 --> 45:26.232
They're not fighting against each other.

45:26.372 --> 45:27.154
Brian's not.

45:27.434 --> 45:28.176
None of this.

45:28.256 --> 45:29.399
It's all one network.

45:29.579 --> 45:32.566
And once you get in it, you either go along with it or they'll throw you out.

45:33.688 --> 45:34.409
Or they'll kill you.

45:40.188 --> 45:43.249
And with social media, maybe they didn't think they had to kill me anymore.

45:43.309 --> 45:45.250
Maybe they didn't have to kill Brandy Vaughn.

45:45.870 --> 45:46.270
I don't know.

45:46.370 --> 45:49.391
She was the only one who was using her own money to put billboards up.

45:49.431 --> 45:50.052
That's for sure.

45:50.612 --> 45:52.373
So what do we really got to think about here?

45:52.533 --> 45:53.693
What really got us here?

45:54.493 --> 45:55.814
What are we really talking about?

45:56.997 --> 46:01.680
Make sure that you understand all of these connections, understand these very well, right?

46:01.720 --> 46:04.362
This is not just conjecture here.

46:04.402 --> 46:16.249
There's just a mountain of evidence and metadata that suggests that we're right, that these guys are behind him, that he might just be a puppet, a real, a real tragic Truman show, really.

46:17.070 --> 46:23.654
And if you watch him standing behind Jay Bhattacharya from that talk or that, that announcement the other day, boy, it's scary.

46:25.188 --> 46:30.670
I don't see anybody swinging from chains or dropping to the floor and doing pushups with his shirt off anymore.

46:31.310 --> 46:32.991
I see a guy who can barely stand up.

46:35.812 --> 46:38.693
And I think that's why there's this fake anti-vax movement.

46:38.893 --> 46:44.775
I think this fake anti-vax movement was never really, I never really thought they were gonna have to do that much.

46:45.395 --> 46:53.658
If you look at the SPARS pandemic document and you go to about page 45 and start reading and you hear them talking about the post pandemic,

46:54.738 --> 47:10.723
narrative control on social media about how the COVAX, or whatever they called it, they called it something like that, vaccine that supposedly was released to, you know, to save people from the SPARS pandemic, also had some side effects.

47:10.783 --> 47:23.067
And there's this hypothetical imaginary character called Epi-Girl that apparently exposes the vaccine injuries on social media, and then the government has to cop to the fact that they hurt some people.

47:23.507 --> 47:44.095
So yes, there is a document, S-P-A-R-S, the SPARS pandemic document that talks about a respiratory coronavirus hypothetical scenario that includes a social media person kind of exposing the people or whistleblowing on the hidden costs of the rollout of the vaccine.

47:44.155 --> 47:48.097
Now, this seems like a much more elaborate show than that.

47:48.157 --> 47:50.618
And I would argue that that's exactly what you see.

47:51.772 --> 47:56.356
You see a show much more elaborate than the original script called for.

47:57.817 --> 48:11.069
The real original script probably only needed people like Andrew Huff and Charles Rixey, but at some point in time, shit went off the rails and they actually brought in Robert Malone and he went public.

48:11.880 --> 48:16.947
And from that moment on, I assure you, this script has been way off the rails.

48:17.027 --> 48:26.700
And you can see that from Robert Malone's attitude change from literally podcast to podcast, where you start with the baseline of the June

48:28.041 --> 48:44.473
21st 2021 podcast with Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch, and then you move on to the August podcast with Paul Cuttrell, and you see a very, very, very, very different Robert Malone.

48:45.902 --> 48:57.870
Because in those situations, he's talking to two completely different audiences in his mind, and two completely different set of people are seeing him as the character that they know.

48:59.171 --> 49:06.516
One was Paul Cottrell, a guy connected to George Webb, probably already briefed on Robert Malone's script from 2020, and

49:09.272 --> 49:16.974
Brett Weinstein, somebody they probably never thought they would need to actually bring so prominently in.

49:19.935 --> 49:21.796
It's really, really remarkable.

49:24.437 --> 49:32.199
Where we are right now is that this might be, that lady right there, Mary, might be the most dangerous kink in their armor.

49:32.359 --> 49:34.120
She was just on Joe Rogan yesterday.

49:35.151 --> 49:38.693
I haven't seen the episode yet, but you see how close that is, right?

49:38.733 --> 49:45.356
Because that lady is on Twitter right now pretending that I'm an anonymous account and that she doesn't know who I am.

49:46.077 --> 49:50.999
Even though she was on my podcast in 2021, the same year.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.000
Maybe it was 2022.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.401
I have to check.

49:54.441 --> 49:55.421
I still haven't uploaded it.

49:55.581 --> 50:01.824
I apologize that, but I think it was 2021, the same year that Kevin McKernan was also on my stream.

50:02.805 --> 50:04.746
It was right before or right after him, I believe.

50:05.694 --> 50:07.935
But see, we'll put all these people on the timeline.

50:07.955 --> 50:10.515
When did I have Jessica Rose on my stream for the first time?

50:10.575 --> 50:10.735
When?

50:11.215 --> 50:11.995
You will see it.

50:15.076 --> 50:22.338
And now we're so close to breaking this because Mary is possibly somebody who could understand how she's been used.

50:22.438 --> 50:22.998
Possibly.

50:23.318 --> 50:23.658
I don't know.

50:25.299 --> 50:26.819
I still haven't lost all my hope.

50:34.391 --> 50:35.812
Mmm, what's happening here?

50:35.852 --> 50:37.252
I gotta reset this, my bad.

50:37.272 --> 50:43.475
It goes there and that goes there and then this will work.

50:46.016 --> 50:49.718
Because we're all kind of ticked off, I think, about the COVID vaccines and so on.

50:49.778 --> 50:50.918
Not all, but many of us.

50:51.499 --> 50:51.919
However,

50:53.083 --> 50:53.844
They're not all bad.

50:54.184 --> 50:56.246
They do make some drugs that have helped a lot of people.

50:57.107 --> 50:58.628
America's drunk on Ozempic.

50:59.790 --> 51:04.494
But I mean, there are some actual serious drugs that can help people.

51:04.975 --> 51:16.626
And so one of the concerns behind people who back big pharma is how much is all of this, some of the stuff we're talking about, going to slow down the approval process for new drugs or drugs in testing?

51:16.806 --> 51:18.507
We're speeding up the approval process.

51:18.988 --> 51:25.833
We made an announcement last week that we are reducing the requirements for some perfunctory things, like animal testing.

51:25.913 --> 51:33.079
Why are we testing every single drug in chimpanzees and dogs, usually beagles, because they're obedient?

51:33.739 --> 51:34.740
That's so sad.

51:34.780 --> 51:36.621
It's sad and it's unnecessary.

51:36.721 --> 51:43.745
So it's unnecessary to test things in animals I thought that all the things that I ever learned as an academic biologist.

51:43.765 --> 51:53.151
We had very good moral reasons for testing on animals and that we were supposed to use the the least complex

51:54.272 --> 51:58.654
Organism that was required to test the hypothesis.

51:58.694 --> 52:22.127
We wanted to test you don't use monkeys to test Something that you could test in mice or even better something you could test in a cell culture So what he is telling you is the truth though we are at a point where our rudimentary knowledge of human physiology is actually limited by the fact that a lot of our

52:23.052 --> 52:28.659
Our assumptions are based on physiology that we've only measured in other model systems.

52:28.719 --> 52:33.924
Now, that is historically not because we are animal killers.

52:34.065 --> 52:41.193
That is historically because it's easier and more justifiable to dissect a frog than it is to dissect a baby.

52:42.299 --> 52:57.914
And I can't stress how malevolent it is that this guy is being used to talk about something that is actually quite nuanced and actually quite a sophisticated bioethics topic.

52:59.545 --> 53:03.068
so dismissively as to say, well, we don't need these tests anymore.

53:03.088 --> 53:15.918
And he's talking about one very small niche and one tiny little corner of the regulatory market where something that's approved in another country has to do some things in America in order to get approved in America.

53:15.958 --> 53:17.559
And some of those might be animal tests.

53:18.059 --> 53:23.065
That is such a small fraction of what he's actually talking about.

53:23.105 --> 53:34.117
By eliminating animal testing, what he is admitting is that most of this stuff is gonna be done either in humans or even worse, it's gonna be done using AI and model systems.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.222
Some of these drugs are already proved in other countries in humans.

53:38.642 --> 53:44.526
So you have a drug already in use in humans in other countries and we're requiring animal testing before.

53:44.966 --> 53:51.791
So we are now, we've put out a release that we are now taking steps to reduce the animal testing requirement.

53:51.831 --> 53:53.212
It's cruel to the animals sometimes.

53:53.332 --> 53:54.273
It's unnecessary.

53:54.813 --> 54:05.400
And we live in a modern world where we have computational modeling using AI that can evaluate a molecule and predict its toxicity in humans better than the animal testing.

54:05.560 --> 54:06.861
That's pretty convenient.

54:06.901 --> 54:22.457
I mean, I know a guy, Robert Malone, who worked on this domain program, which I think was a Ditra-based program, that was in like three weeks in January of 2020, was able to go through the entire catalog.

54:23.178 --> 54:31.686
of FDA pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals and identify candidate compounds that would interact with a couple key viral proteins.

54:32.407 --> 54:40.074
So this sounds like either a descendant of that technology or perhaps the conventional spinoff of it.

54:40.134 --> 54:41.195
Really exciting, wow.

54:42.156 --> 54:47.260
We also have something called organ-on-a-chip technology, where say liver cells are grown in the lab.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.762
Sounds like a terrible appetizer.

54:49.858 --> 54:51.900
Yeah, I personally cannot eat liver.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.622
I've operated on the liver too much.

54:53.802 --> 54:55.964
That's one food I cannot do.

54:56.004 --> 54:57.125
No one wants organ on a chip.

54:57.266 --> 54:58.487
Yeah, organ on a chip.

54:58.767 --> 55:00.949
So in the lab, they grow these cells.

55:02.011 --> 55:03.192
and then they introduce the drug.

55:03.292 --> 55:12.956
And you can actually see whether or not it injures the cells better than if you inject some bunny rabbit that is not gonna talk to you and say, my liver hurts.

55:13.457 --> 55:19.039
So these new technologies have the promise of replacing some of this routine animal testing.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.160
You would cut.

55:20.200 --> 55:29.684
So now they're signaling to you that they are going to invest billions of dollars in these technologies which have never worked

55:31.519 --> 55:48.905
The only application where I know that this has been done in the past and really done with a lot of money and investment and intention is in neuroscience, because culturing brains, culturing an embryonic brain, even culturing a neuronal network is all

55:49.705 --> 56:07.422
Stuff that they've been doing for the last 10 if not 20 years trying to figure out if it was possible figure out what is possible and so Claiming that these are new technologies or he put liver cells on a chip these are the kinds of sort of

56:09.142 --> 56:27.317
not real advances that also, you know, just from a practical perspective, the robotics, for example, a lot of the stuff that McKernan is responsible for with regard to the progress of the Human Genome Project is just a question of brute forcing the same reactions and being able to do more reactions per day.

56:27.377 --> 56:33.562
And I'm not saying that they're not technological advances, but they are technological advances that are

56:34.554 --> 56:38.757
are irrelevant to the biology that they either push forward or don't.

56:39.097 --> 56:52.748
And in this case, you know, being able to sequence a lot of DNA or longer pieces of DNA more cheaply with more accuracy hasn't resulted in any significant gains in our understanding

56:53.729 --> 57:01.114
of how our biology is encoded in DNA as a real pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

57:01.154 --> 57:13.602
We're just thinking about genes as proteins and then assuming that if you make all these proteins in the right order, they'll just self-assemble into that beautiful teenage girl that you had a crush on when you were in high school.

57:14.183 --> 57:15.284
And that's just absurd.

57:16.384 --> 57:17.805
We don't understand any of that.

57:17.985 --> 57:28.647
And now this guy, a surgeon, who can make jokes about not being able to eat liver because he used to do surgery on liver, this is not good.

57:29.348 --> 57:32.549
This is part of an absolute sabotage of the FDA.

57:32.729 --> 57:33.489
I presume

57:34.309 --> 57:38.131
because that was the target or one of the targets of this operation all along.

57:38.151 --> 57:44.053
I mean, this is a multi-decade operation with the idea of taking over the FDA.

57:44.233 --> 57:49.296
I don't know about the rest of it yet, but for sure, one of the targets is the FDA.

57:50.576 --> 58:00.161
Six months out of that approval process, you lower R&D costs for pharma companies and inventors, which could lower drug prices for everyday Americans.

58:00.561 --> 58:01.941
And it reduces animal use.

58:01.961 --> 58:03.182
There's too much animal use.

58:03.697 --> 58:15.949
You know what's weird is that the times that we've gone to the doctor, my wife and I, since we've been back to the States, since I brought Phila back here in 2016, we've been to the doctor a few times.

58:20.256 --> 58:25.380
I went to the dentist one time and took x-rays and then they asked me how old I was.

58:26.140 --> 58:30.584
And I said I was 49 or 48, I think I said.

58:30.784 --> 58:31.704
I can't remember anymore.

58:31.725 --> 58:32.325
I might have even been 47.

58:34.028 --> 58:36.430
And they said, when's the last time you've been to the dentist?

58:36.450 --> 58:38.651
And I said, probably at least 16 years ago.

58:39.332 --> 58:50.419
And they were like, holy shit, you have no cavities and maybe you should just, we'll clean them and you come back in another 16 years, whatever you're doing, you should keep doing it.

58:51.980 --> 58:59.125
And the other thing that happens when we go to the doctor, when they ask you if you're on any medications and we say no, and they kind of pause.

59:02.153 --> 59:08.759
And now he's talking about doing a favor for Americans by making their medications cheaper.

59:09.059 --> 59:13.243
I don't think that sounds very MAGA to me or very MAHA to me.

59:13.883 --> 59:15.625
It sounds very HAHA to me.

59:17.679 --> 59:23.462
Are there any other areas where AI can come and help as we move into the 21st century?

59:23.762 --> 59:27.204
Yeah, we're bringing in a team that is really exciting.

59:27.244 --> 59:38.890
They're going to introduce AI into the review process to help the reviewer, to make the reviewer's work stream much more streamlined and summarize things.

59:39.431 --> 59:43.873
There are parts of the drug application that are so perfunctory, that are outdated.

59:44.313 --> 59:45.354
That could be streamlined.

59:45.374 --> 59:48.515
That could be abstracted with AI to help the reviewer.

59:48.655 --> 59:55.057
So here, like all other aspects of government that Trump is taking on, you're saying there's actually too much red tape.

59:55.378 --> 59:58.559
And we're red taping the wrong things, it sounds like you're saying.

59:58.779 --> 01:00:00.240
Why does it take 10 years?

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:06.042
It doesn't sound like he's going to look back at PCR as a diagnostic and question anything, is he?

01:00:06.842 --> 01:00:08.323
Which means there's a whole

01:00:09.684 --> 01:00:16.891
There's a whole industry and a whole sector of the market of diagnostics that will never be regulated again, essentially.

01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:22.176
That's not even on the gun range.

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:26.360
It's not even among the targets you can choose.

01:00:27.689 --> 01:00:28.730
They don't even notice it.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:29.910
It's not even there.

01:00:30.531 --> 01:00:32.011
It's as if it never existed.

01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:42.537
A lot of the same way that Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn and Andrew Huff and all of these people in the health freedom movement insist that it must be a gain-of-function virus.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:43.518
I mean, obviously.

01:00:45.699 --> 01:00:47.820
Without ever looking at the definition,

01:00:49.454 --> 01:00:59.280
by sequencing or PCR without ever looking at the definition of murder by supplementary oxygen or by opioids and adding the numbers up, just doing the math.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:12.308
They're just going to wait and rely on, you know, Dowd to say what he says, or Nick Hudson, the actuary, to say what he says, or Denny Rancor, the physicist, to say what he says, because I couldn't do the math myself.

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:14.109
It's pretty hard to figure out.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.922
is to bring a drug to market in the United States because of the regulatory steps.

01:01:22.542 --> 01:01:24.283
I mean, people are dying.

01:01:24.343 --> 01:01:28.045
People need cures and meaningful treatments.

01:01:31.327 --> 01:01:32.507
People are dying?

01:01:32.547 --> 01:01:35.349
They need meaningful cures and treatments?

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:37.830
Wow.

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:41.592
I mean, what are you going to say with this?

01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:50.016
My predecessor in this role was focused, as he stated, his number one goal was fighting misinformation.

01:01:50.136 --> 01:01:57.141
Well, our number one goal is delivering cures and meaningful treatments and healthier foods for Americans.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.362
That is our focus.

01:02:00.003 --> 01:02:03.806
And so you've heard about consolidation, or changes, or cuts at the FDA.

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:07.808
Those were not cuts to scientists, or reviewers, or inspectors.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:08.989
Absolutely none.

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:18.475
They were cuts to communications staff, FDA's lobbyists to Congress, and to the IT systems here, where there's a lot of opportunity for efficiencies.

01:02:18.575 --> 01:02:28.282
Yes, definitely there's been pushback on IT systems here, the efficiencies of the patenting system, the efficiencies of the approval system.

01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:29.263
This is not good.

01:02:30.303 --> 01:02:36.187
using AI for the application process, for the approval process, for the screening process.

01:02:36.868 --> 01:02:38.709
This does not sound good at all.

01:02:38.749 --> 01:02:46.515
This sounds like sabotage of the FDA's mandate to make sure that everything is safe and effective that's sold in America.

01:02:46.823 --> 01:02:49.065
the number of people who were ousted.

01:02:49.085 --> 01:02:56.049
I think it was your predecessor who said the FDA, as we know it, is gone, that the experts are gone.

01:02:56.169 --> 01:03:01.673
People with decades of institutional knowledge have been turfed, suggesting there might now be a safety issue here.

01:03:02.314 --> 01:03:03.154
There is a mass.

01:03:03.374 --> 01:03:08.318
Make no mistake about the fact that it's my understanding from my friends in the U.S.

01:03:08.358 --> 01:03:15.563
government that a lot of the senior members of the FBI took the offer to retire and are gone.

01:03:16.607 --> 01:03:24.891
A lot of senior members of many different departments in the government, when offered early retirement by Elon Musk, actually took it.

01:03:27.072 --> 01:03:35.516
Not because, you know, they're lazy or whatever, but because it was a legally absurd offer.

01:03:38.038 --> 01:03:39.819
And many of them are gone now.

01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:43.581
The senior leadership of the FBI is essentially gone now.

01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:49.725
That's the real explanation for why Comey did what he did with the seashells in the sand.

01:03:51.386 --> 01:03:57.830
It was an overt signal to everybody who knows what they're seeing there that the FBI is effectively non-existent anymore.

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.330
It's got no leadership.

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:02.292
And that's why you have like, who, what's his name again?

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:06.034
Is it a Chinese guy at the head of the FBI or was it a Russian?

01:04:06.094 --> 01:04:06.795
I can't remember.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:16.563
His his mind his name will come to my I'll remember it's like Igor Chang or something like that, right or is it is it?

01:04:17.204 --> 01:04:21.526
Guangzhou Guangzhou Skiborovich or something?

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:25.688
I can't remember who the who the guy of the the head of the FBI is.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.309
But anyway, the FBI is done.

01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:31.543
massive growth of FDA employees under the Biden administration.

01:04:32.003 --> 01:04:45.775
And when the media reports that there were cuts, which many were early retirements, people took early retirement, none were to scientific reviewers or inspectors or law enforcement at the FDA.

01:04:46.996 --> 01:04:49.678
They were to IT communications, legislative affairs.

01:04:50.159 --> 01:04:52.661
And so what you're not hearing in the mainstream.

01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:54.202
That's just absurd.

01:04:54.382 --> 01:04:58.505
I mean, to say that none of them were important people, just the IT people.

01:04:58.945 --> 01:05:02.568
And so since the IT people left, we're going to institute some AI.

01:05:02.668 --> 01:05:04.089
I mean, what the?

01:05:06.431 --> 01:05:07.591
This is just, this is just dumb.

01:05:07.852 --> 01:05:13.516
I mean, now remember what we saw yesterday on Face the Nation.

01:05:14.522 --> 01:05:18.204
This guy is good at what he does.

01:05:18.244 --> 01:05:19.985
He's an excellent bullshitter.

01:05:20.886 --> 01:05:24.108
He's excellent at staying his, this guy's good.

01:05:24.428 --> 01:05:26.909
I'm not gonna say he's not good, but he's awful.

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:33.015
is that there was a 100% increase in the number of FDA employees since 2006.

01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:36.999
You have about 18,000, and it's been cut about 3,500 since you and Kennedy got here.

01:05:37.419 --> 01:05:40.162
So you're saying we had more like 9,000?

01:05:40.382 --> 01:05:43.004
We had 9,500 employees at the FDA in 2006.

01:05:43.104 --> 01:05:43.364
Oh, wow.

01:05:43.525 --> 01:05:44.365
Doubled.

01:05:44.806 --> 01:05:54.614
And so when you report that there were cuts and you don't report that there was a 100% increase in employees in the preceding years,

01:05:55.535 --> 01:06:00.500
that the number of employees doubled in the preceding years, that is misleading.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:10.451
And the people who we've gotten rid of, losing them is not going to slow down drug approval or safety procedures because they were, sounds like, more administrative people.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:15.922
There were no cuts to scientists, reviewers, or inspectors, or law enforcement.

01:06:16.002 --> 01:06:21.665
And my goal is to make sure that every one of those people has all the resources they need to do their job well.

01:06:22.386 --> 01:06:31.410
Now, cuts are never perfect, and so we have done an assessment, and there are some individuals that we have invited back.

01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:33.932
There were a couple people who were

01:06:34.552 --> 01:06:42.275
taking the early retirement, and we were told of their, sort of, how well they performed here, and we encouraged them to stay.

01:06:42.675 --> 01:06:44.576
And we encouraged them to stay.

01:06:44.596 --> 01:06:55.960
You see, what you don't need to, I think instead you need to figure into your equation about what's actually happening with the Trump administration, is this is just a hint.

01:06:57.261 --> 01:07:02.883
But I can tell you from friends that I have, that this is not a joke.

01:07:04.252 --> 01:07:06.514
A lot of people took this very seriously.

01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:15.079
And when they got that letter after years of service to multiple administrations, they said, you know what?

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:20.262
You're gonna send a letter like this to me about early retirement after 15 years of service, I'll take it.

01:07:21.323 --> 01:07:22.464
See what you're gonna do now.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:30.209
And I think you can't really underestimate how much narrative control is required in order for them to keep this hidden.

01:07:31.325 --> 01:07:34.126
because it affects senior leadership at the FBI.

01:07:34.766 --> 01:07:40.449
It affects senior leadership probably at the CIA, if there's anything of that organization left.

01:07:40.989 --> 01:07:46.451
It's affected a lot of places in the government because, you know, let's screw it.

01:07:47.332 --> 01:07:58.236
If you already know that people have been, you know, looting the place and you already know that it's gonna get much worse before it gets better, why wouldn't you take an early retirement?

01:08:01.713 --> 01:08:06.035
I think that things are much worse than we are being allowed to see.

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:25.325
And I think one of the main reasons why you should think that is because of how much time this guy already occupies on national public media, Sunday morning shows, walking this bullshit line that I told you they were gonna walk already in 2021.

01:08:27.646 --> 01:08:29.927
It's remarkable and also terrifying.

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:39.154
But to not report that the agency has doubled since 2006 before this cut, in my opinion, is not telling the whole story.

01:08:39.174 --> 01:08:39.854
No, it's dishonest.

01:08:40.795 --> 01:08:41.435
It's dishonest.

01:08:42.056 --> 01:08:43.196
Is it swampy here?

01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:50.901
And by that, I mean, we had a report that when Secretary Kennedy came over and addressed the troops last Friday, some people got up and walked out.

01:08:51.041 --> 01:08:53.943
They were disgusted by him, which seems like a bad sign.

01:08:54.878 --> 01:08:56.059
Yeah, I was in that room.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.940
Nobody got up and walked out.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.741
Oh, nobody got up and walked out.

01:08:59.821 --> 01:09:05.205
So again, now we're setting up this narrative where some people believe that lots of people got up and walked out.

01:09:05.405 --> 01:09:07.766
And other people believe that nobody got up and walked out.

01:09:07.826 --> 01:09:14.751
And it's, it's these little games that are only possible with social media.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.192
because again, if he just tells this story, it doesn't matter.

01:09:19.252 --> 01:09:22.214
The point is, is that X users already heard this.

01:09:22.494 --> 01:09:32.441
And, and Megan Kelly is something that is saying something that was already on their mind because the script already put it on social media a few days before this interview.

01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:39.066
Do you understand how malevolently it's designed and how militarily it's deployed yet?

01:09:40.233 --> 01:09:51.943
because I feel like that's one of my jobs now, whether I like it or not, is to try and demonstrate to people how an illusion of consensus on X can be reinforced by a few questions on a podcast.

01:09:52.403 --> 01:09:54.665
And it might be so subtle that you never noticed it.

01:09:54.705 --> 01:09:59.149
Just like when Joe Rogan says that, you know, he eats a certain pasta or something like that.

01:09:59.209 --> 01:10:06.495
It's a subtle advertisement, but advertisements hidden inside of the dialogue of a podcast are not what's dangerous.

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:07.396
It's the myths.

01:10:08.803 --> 01:10:13.367
biological myths, the societal myths, the economic myths.

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:17.250
I can't even say myths anymore because there are so many freaking myths.

01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:30.260
And they're all reinforced by this illusion of consensus about what questions are important to ask and what answers are important to consider without actually choosing one.

01:10:32.455 --> 01:10:41.882
Now, we did stream it, so if somebody was watching it in their office and got up to go to the bathroom during the speech, maybe that constituted getting up and walking out.

01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:42.283
I don't know.

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:55.433
I was in that room, and there was incredible energy in that room because he talked about how agencies that are set up to defend public safety sometimes become captured by the organizations that they are set out to regulate.

01:10:55.713 --> 01:10:59.216
And he talked about the EPA has had a history where they have cycled.

01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:00.958
It's almost as if

01:11:01.718 --> 01:11:07.479
This guy has a better media presence than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:07.519 --> 01:11:10.000
can have, and so they're substituting him in.

01:11:12.221 --> 01:11:14.841
He's talking about what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:16.802
said, but I thought Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:11:16.822 --> 01:11:29.985
was this fantastic orator that is descended from a long line of fine orators that have included senators and presidents and attorneys general.

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:32.511
Am I wrong about that?

01:11:35.412 --> 01:11:37.353
And at times have been captured by the industry.

01:11:37.834 --> 01:11:46.419
And he encouraged people at the FDA to speak up, think independently, and that he had his full support behind them.

01:11:46.479 --> 01:11:48.640
So it was an incredible talk.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.263
And of course, you're gonna hear a clip or a phrase pulled out out of context.

01:11:53.803 --> 01:11:58.666
But I was in that room, nobody walked out, and it was incredibly a strong message.

01:11:58.686 --> 01:11:59.467
The FDA is strong.

01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:01.048
And we're going to continue to be strong.

01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:03.010
And that's because we believe in the scientists.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.912
How's your relationship with Bobby Kennedy?

01:12:05.513 --> 01:12:05.833
It's good.

01:12:05.853 --> 01:12:10.258
How's your relationship with Bobby Kennedy?

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.662
I don't know what to say, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:14.702 --> 01:12:19.166
I really don't know what to say other than you've got to see it for the show that it is.

01:12:19.266 --> 01:12:23.471
And not everybody needs to know that the script is bad.

01:12:25.054 --> 01:12:30.039
Some people just accept that they're scripted, like Megyn Kelly accepts that she's scripted.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.061
She's done that career for a long time.

01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:38.308
She's never been somebody who's seeking her own answers and putting out her own interpretation.

01:12:38.348 --> 01:12:43.393
And so there was a question in the chat a few minutes ago about how do we know if anything is real anymore?

01:12:43.433 --> 01:12:48.318
The only thing that you can do is to trust and verify.

01:12:49.585 --> 01:12:58.210
The only thing that you can do is go with your gut and your heart, listen to the words that people say and decide whether or not you think they're lying to you or not.

01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:02.833
And I think that that's the way forward.

01:13:02.893 --> 01:13:13.399
I think then if you trusted your friends, you trusted your neighbors to do the same thing, then eventually what would rise to the top are people like me.

01:13:14.554 --> 01:13:26.121
who although we make mistakes, although our interpretation of past events in current context will change, we strive to remain honest.

01:13:27.322 --> 01:13:38.830
And we are sort of focused on maintaining a unblemished record of integrity rather than trying to protect some facade of having always been right.

01:13:41.211 --> 01:13:43.893
And I think that's where my whole

01:13:45.305 --> 01:13:50.347
problem for them really went off the rails was when I decided to go public and say, you know what?

01:13:50.488 --> 01:13:51.328
I was a shithead.

01:13:51.628 --> 01:14:02.093
I was, I was pushing a lab leak so far as to write a review about lab leaks and write a review about how spike protein vaccines might cause the lab leak to mutate.

01:14:03.434 --> 01:14:12.058
And I'm sorry, because me doing that was part of the reason why maybe my friend Nathan thought, well, you know, if this wasn't a lab leak,

01:14:13.806 --> 01:14:21.011
Maybe it would be, you know, maybe I could kind of skip the vaccine, but since it's kind of like maybe a lab leak, maybe I should avoid getting it.

01:14:23.513 --> 01:14:27.435
That's the reality that I live with and I will live with for the rest of my life.

01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:31.098
Because like it or not,

01:14:32.182 --> 01:14:35.385
blame it on all these actors on social media, it doesn't matter.

01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:53.921
I didn't figure it out until it was too late for Nathan, and too late for my father-in-law, and too late for my sister-in-law, and too late for my friend Annie, and too late for many other people who aren't dead, but probably are suffering or will suffer more, and could be dead in the future.

01:14:55.842 --> 01:14:58.805
I have to live with the memory of having Nathan laugh at me

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:03.244
when I said that I still think you could just drop dead from it.

01:15:04.685 --> 01:15:06.967
And that the only hope you have is that it was a placebo.

01:15:09.549 --> 01:15:12.211
And he laughed at me and said, but what if people don't die?

01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:14.713
Then how do you make a living going forward, Jay?

01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:16.234
How does this sustain itself?

01:15:17.955 --> 01:15:20.537
And 34 days later, he dropped dead.

01:15:21.918 --> 01:15:22.619
Something like that.

01:15:22.739 --> 01:15:23.679
Maybe it was 44 days later.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:37.289
It's all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen, but it's very malevolent scripted bullshit that has been altered and fine-tuned.

01:15:39.872 --> 01:15:48.282
And a lot of that altering and fine-tuning took place before the pandemic, and it took place because of Brandy Vaughn, around Brandy Vaughn.

01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:57.584
to try and build a fake anti-vax movement despite Brandy Vaughn, so that at the start of the pandemic, they would have control over that narrative.

01:15:57.624 --> 01:16:00.004
And I guess at some point they decided, you know what, kill her.

01:16:02.285 --> 01:16:04.085
Because we're not going to be able to do this.

01:16:04.986 --> 01:16:12.388
And then two weeks after she was dead, Brian Hooker was on a stream with a bunch of people telling everybody all about how COVID worked.

01:16:13.686 --> 01:16:20.049
all about how the testing worked, all about how antibodies worked, all about how asymptomatic transmission worked.

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:27.654
And coincidentally, nobody on that fricking stream said anything about injection versus ingestion.

01:16:27.734 --> 01:16:37.539
Nobody like Brian Hooker with 16 years experience as a geneticist in plants, making medicine in plants for a genetic laboratory of the government.

01:16:39.039 --> 01:16:44.822
was never going to tell anybody in that Zoom chat that this is a transfection and you shouldn't take it.

01:16:45.182 --> 01:16:47.924
He was just going to complain that they hadn't tested it enough yet.

01:16:49.364 --> 01:16:50.065
Stop lying.

01:16:50.745 --> 01:16:54.527
This guy who in 2013 would not use the word autism.

01:16:54.567 --> 01:16:55.968
He didn't like the word autism.

01:16:56.308 --> 01:16:57.749
His son was vaccine damaged.

01:16:57.789 --> 01:16:59.209
He was neurologically injured.

01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:00.930
He didn't like the word autism.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:02.451
He won't use the word autism.

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.072
He was vaccine damaged.

01:17:05.768 --> 01:17:18.814
And now Brian Hooker is spouting scripted bullshit for the last few years about a big top tent for health freedom in hopes that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when he got somewhere important, he would fix the problem.

01:17:23.936 --> 01:17:26.397
Like it or not, Brian Hooker is a traitor to our children.

01:17:27.153 --> 01:17:42.823
And he could do us a huge favor by confessing to the fact that he put his eggs in the wrong basket, that he should have stuck to his principles in 2013, that he better off would have collaborated with Brandy Vaughn instead of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:42.883 --> 01:17:50.048
And he should apologize to all the children that have been injured by the vaccine schedule that he had no effect on.

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:55.752
No effect.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.941
Mary Holland has had no effect.

01:17:59.021 --> 01:18:11.809
She saved virtually no one while she's been singing harmoniously with a high salary with Paul Offit on all these shows for so long.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:16.152
That many people out of this picture are bad.

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:21.916
That many people have had personal interaction with me and I can verify are bad.

01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:26.831
They deserve a cream pie in the face, all of them.

01:18:28.993 --> 01:18:37.479
Only Wolfgang Wodach and Thomas Binder have been completely supportive of my narrative.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:49.668
And in fact, I should really color in Sukrit Bhakti because he says that now that there's, you know, no debate about RNA camp pandemic, we should stop talking about it, which is of course bullshit.

01:18:50.069 --> 01:18:51.910
It's what we should be teaching our children.

01:18:56.946 --> 01:18:59.007
And so what was this scripted bullshit for?

01:18:59.027 --> 01:19:00.127
You want to know what it was for?

01:19:00.147 --> 01:19:01.588
You got to ask the right questions.

01:19:02.688 --> 01:19:04.309
What was this murder and lies for?

01:19:04.349 --> 01:19:05.730
You got to ask the right questions.

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:16.354
Like why in 2013 did a guy who worked for a government laboratory genetically modifying plants to produce medicines, why did he not use the word autism?

01:19:16.414 --> 01:19:18.555
Why did he not like the word autism in 2013?

01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:18.975
But now he does.

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:46.356
You got to ask yourself how it's possible that Mary Holland and Paul Offit were on Democracy Now in 2015 arguing about a certain kind or part of the MMR vaccine causing some damage to her son and essentially promoting the idea of Wakefield and seeding the narrative in America that it's some component of the MMR vaccine that's causing autism.

01:19:48.046 --> 01:20:01.950
You also would need to explain why on April Fool's Day, ICANN was conceived and became a legal entity on the same day that the Vaxxed movie produced by Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield was released in America.

01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:10.752
You also gotta ask yourself why in 2018 the World Mercury Project became Children's Health Defense.

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:33.563
when in 2018 learntherisk.org was putting billboards outside of Paul Offit's hospital and Larry Cook's little stop mandatory vaccinations website was being promoted by Paul Offit and ZDogg in a stunt

01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:51.090
which I think Mark Hulak has nailed as a stunt that it was where some fake anti-vaxxers came outside of the window with a perfect shot at the at the monitor and at Paul Offit and at them lying and then they happened to drop blinds that you could still see through.

01:20:51.110 --> 01:21:03.136
You also got to ask yourself why in 2019 there are so many weird coincidences like like Sasha Latupova's daughter being on Alex Jones three times.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:12.858
Like Brett Weinstein at the end of 2019 having Sam Harris on to say that there's the next pandemic, we won't be able to tolerate any anti-vaxxers.

01:21:13.959 --> 01:21:22.948
With Peter Thiel on the first podcast of Eric Weinstein saying, you know, he doesn't trust science because the specialization allows people to exaggerate and to lie.

01:21:23.468 --> 01:21:25.190
And so he starts with skepticism.

01:21:28.775 --> 01:21:41.743
Where in 2019, James Lyons Weiler is going around the United States telling people that vaccinated diseases, vaccination preventable diseases are still circulating asymptomatically in those people who are vaccinated.

01:21:43.784 --> 01:21:50.829
And that damage to vaccines has a complex bouquet of genetic and environmental explanations, causes.

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:55.700
You got to go down to 2020 when Brandy Vaughn is killed.

01:21:56.141 --> 01:22:07.098
And then two weeks later, Brian Hooker is telling us all about his knowledge of the coronavirus and coronavirus biology and immunology to coronavirus and vaccine testing.

01:22:10.796 --> 01:22:22.966
And then you gotta accept the next five years of bullshit where all these people have us on this never-ending hamster wheel where they never question the basics of the biology of the pandemic.

01:22:23.586 --> 01:22:30.111
They always accept the novel virus that millions were killed, that millions more were saved from, that might lead to gain of function, therefore it could come again.

01:22:30.131 --> 01:22:38.338
And it's all based on bad biology, evolution because DNA, intramuscular injections, the best invention we've ever come up with.

01:22:39.935 --> 01:22:41.956
It's as good as the wheel or the airplane.

01:22:42.496 --> 01:22:45.437
Pandemics are real and we can make them.

01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:51.780
Not only can Mother Nature do it occasionally if she's a bitch, but we can make them now.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.901
And it's really easy because of the Human Genome Project.

01:22:56.562 --> 01:22:58.643
You are a human, you're not a person.

01:22:59.143 --> 01:23:02.845
You're definitely not a man or a woman or a young man or a young woman.

01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:07.527
You're certainly not a future mom or a future father.

01:23:08.988 --> 01:23:11.029
You're not even a father or a mother right now.

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:11.809
You're a human.

01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:14.511
You should think of your kid as a human.

01:23:14.811 --> 01:23:16.592
Not your kid, but our kid.

01:23:17.312 --> 01:23:20.194
And finally, we all descend from the same puddle.

01:23:21.694 --> 01:23:30.739
So accept that you're just the consequence of your genes and accept that your life means nothing because you're the consequence of billions of years of evolution.

01:23:30.799 --> 01:23:31.239
Give it up.

01:23:31.279 --> 01:23:32.480
You can't change anything.

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.682
And these are all lies that take away the sacred

01:23:37.856 --> 01:23:41.737
Everything sacred that should be present in our lives.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:50.019
Everything sacred that we should be handing down to our children is effectively erased if you believe bad biology 101 and evolution because DNA.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.300
That's the thing we need to fight.

01:23:54.501 --> 01:24:01.923
If our children grow up understanding this bullshit as the bullshit that it is, then our future is set.

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:06.044
Our grandchildren are going to be fine and these slavers have no chance of winning.

01:24:06.903 --> 01:24:08.807
It doesn't matter how good their iPhones get.

01:24:10.591 --> 01:24:11.994
I believe that with all my heart.

01:24:12.195 --> 01:24:12.736
I really do.

01:24:13.237 --> 01:24:17.166
It's been a long strange trip, but I believe more than ever.

01:24:17.884 --> 01:24:19.605
that we are gonna get our way out of this.

01:24:19.645 --> 01:24:20.526
We are gonna push our way.

01:24:20.546 --> 01:24:22.687
Hey everyone, Dr. Z. Welcome to the ZDoggMD show.

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:24.468
Today, I have a special guest.

01:24:24.488 --> 01:24:30.312
Look, I moved back to the Bay Area so I could talk to smart people at places like UCSF and Stanford and in the Bay Area.

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:37.017
We're gonna keep reviewing this video because I want to explain to you why Jay Bhattacharya is not my friend anymore.

01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:46.643
I want you to understand how it is impossible that somebody who on my stream defers to me as a biologist whose work he can't evaluate

01:24:48.117 --> 01:24:56.163
could be possibly, in September of 2020, so sure about so much viral biology?

01:24:57.024 --> 01:24:58.144
As you said, at Stanford University.

01:24:58.164 --> 01:25:01.247
I've been at Stanford on the faculty for about 20 years.

01:25:01.767 --> 01:25:05.870
I've an MD and a PhD in economics, and I study health policy and health economics.

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:11.514
I've been working on infectious disease economics and epidemiology for 20 some years now.

01:25:12.486 --> 01:25:21.311
So the reason I wanted to have... That's actually an admission that his CV is bullshit and it has been manufactured out of some whole cloth.

01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:22.911
It's a joke, actually.

01:25:24.312 --> 01:25:28.975
That's not how he presented himself to me as an infectious disease expert and economist.

01:25:29.015 --> 01:25:29.975
What does that even mean?

01:25:29.995 --> 01:25:33.497
Does that mean he knows how to make money on a pandemic?

01:25:36.383 --> 01:25:39.184
Or does that mean he knows how to make money on the concept of a pandemic?

01:25:39.204 --> 01:25:39.725
What is that?

01:25:40.085 --> 01:25:41.465
Wow.

01:25:41.565 --> 01:25:46.988
What you just said, you have the MD, Stanford trained and a PhD in economics.

01:25:47.808 --> 01:25:50.689
All of his degrees are from Stanford.

01:25:50.909 --> 01:25:54.191
All of them, which is really not how people usually do it.

01:25:54.639 --> 01:26:02.063
which means you can see in a way that many frontline healthcare people, including public health people, aren't able to see the bigger picture.

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:17.653
Now, you came to prominence during the pandemic as one of the co-authors of the Stanford Seroprevalence Study, which raised all kinds of interesting... I mean, tell me about that experience, because I was talking about your piece early on, saying, hey, this is true,

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:33.103
The actual... So make no mistake about it, there is a mountain of evidence about the pandemic at the start of the pandemic, which comes from or to us via Indian sources.

01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:44.330
The first paper about the virus sequence and the fear and cleavage site was written by a husband and wife team in Drastic, who are Indian.

01:26:45.595 --> 01:27:02.205
the anonymous person that found the PhD and master's thesis that supposedly had the viral precursor sequences in it and had this outbreak in the mine in Wunan province, Moyang province, sorry.

01:27:03.466 --> 01:27:10.850
That PhD thesis, that master's thesis was found in Mandarin by an Indian who read Mandarin.

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:14.072
And that was the seeker in drastic.

01:27:17.116 --> 01:27:41.410
Now we also have a Indian guy at Stanford who gives us three, not one, but three seroprevalence studies and also helps Major League Baseball define the presence of infection in their organizations and teaches them how to do it, teaches them that the virus is real, teaches them that the virus may be spreading and you don't know it.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.823
This is expert class, military level narrative dissemination.

01:27:51.104 --> 01:27:54.306
Make no mistake about it, these are also two Indian men.

01:27:55.947 --> 01:28:02.290
Infection fatality rate of this disease is actually much- The HIV paper came out of India.

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:06.572
Don't forget the HIV that got retracted because it was crazy.

01:28:07.884 --> 01:28:09.105
lower than we thought.

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:13.568
It's still higher than flu, but it's not, you know, as high as they've been saying in China.

01:28:13.608 --> 01:28:14.869
I mean, what was that experience like?

01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:16.150
I mean, that was incredible.

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:28.579
Piper Stover is on a podcast in December of 2019 talking about biotechnology with the former Obama administration ambassador to India.

01:28:32.475 --> 01:28:34.117
It's getting uglier by the second.

01:28:34.297 --> 01:28:38.360
If you add all these things up, it cannot be like, oh, wait, wow.

01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:38.881
Oh, wow.

01:28:38.941 --> 01:28:41.964
Those, those line up pretty good actually, don't they?

01:28:45.239 --> 01:28:49.321
It's just an amazing, in some ways dispiriting, but also exciting experience.

01:28:49.341 --> 01:28:51.803
So can I go back just a little bit?

01:28:51.943 --> 01:28:52.543
Absolutely.

01:28:52.563 --> 01:28:57.826
So what got me into it was I had done some work during the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.

01:28:58.006 --> 01:28:59.827
I remember that one.

01:29:00.107 --> 01:29:01.708
I mean, it was a big deal at the time, right?

01:29:01.908 --> 01:29:12.794
But luckily it didn't turn out to be as bad as COVID, but especially at the beginning, people were really, really panicked over the high fatality rates, the case fatality rates that were coming up all around the world.

01:29:13.274 --> 01:29:14.854
I remember I was on practice.

01:29:14.874 --> 01:29:18.595
And so they are in agreement again, and I just want to illustrate it.

01:29:19.635 --> 01:29:23.776
They are in agreement that case fatality rate is a number that needs to be measured.

01:29:24.476 --> 01:29:28.097
And if you don't measure it accurately, you could make the wrong decision.

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:39.900
And so all the words that they're using here are making their listeners that are passively engaged in this illusion to assume

01:29:40.799 --> 01:29:44.983
that these numbers are valid or validating them is important.

01:29:45.084 --> 01:29:49.268
And more importantly, once we know that number, we will know what action we should take.

01:29:49.308 --> 01:29:56.876
Because if that number is high enough, as jackass number one will say, then that would be reason to lock everybody down.

01:29:59.003 --> 01:30:02.486
to Stanford and everybody was like, we're all going to die.

01:30:02.566 --> 01:30:04.207
It was a kind of a catastrophization.

01:30:04.668 --> 01:30:08.031
Yeah, no, it's actually in the early days, there was good reason.

01:30:08.051 --> 01:30:11.874
There were these case fatality rates that looked like, you know, Ebola.

01:30:11.934 --> 01:30:13.055
I mean, it just, it looked terrible.

01:30:14.557 --> 01:30:24.846
So in other words, if we could fix the case fatality rate at some crazy number, we could trigger all kinds of responses that would otherwise never be triggered.

01:30:26.584 --> 01:30:31.666
Essentially, we are already being technocratically governed, if that's the way this works.

01:30:32.767 --> 01:30:37.368
Just publish the right paper, and you trigger the PrEP Act, and now all bets are off for five years.

01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:53.915
Think about that, because that's essentially what they did with EcoHealth Alliance, and sending the fat man, Peter Daszak, over to China with some money, some USAID money, and now all of a sudden you have, well, I guess it's out there.

01:30:54.355 --> 01:30:55.636
Holy cow, it's crazy.

01:30:57.273 --> 01:30:58.073
Seems real to me.

01:31:12.788 --> 01:31:21.511
in H1N1, and the infection fatality rate, which turned out to be about 100 times less than the initial case fatality rates in the H1N1 case.

01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:30.294
So from Mark's work, you also know that Li Min Yan is tied to Sri Lankan families that are tied to the National Cancer Institute, that are tied to

01:31:31.555 --> 01:31:47.290
the real event 201 in 2018 and you know that the original SARS was actually identified or described or somehow some very scientific understanding of that phenomenon was contributed by people associated with Li Min Yan.

01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:54.937
This is all very bizarro world unless you see it as all one malevolent show that has been orchestrated over more than a decade.

01:31:55.868 --> 01:32:15.879
That's why Mary Holland and Paul Offit have been going at each other ineffectively for more than 10 years running with no progress on either side because it is the exact hamster wheel that they want us to pass down to our children.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:22.303
And it's the exact hamster wheel that we get out of if we stop listening to this argument

01:32:24.016 --> 01:32:27.558
So let me reiterate that for people who don't understand some of that terminology.

01:32:27.578 --> 01:32:37.444
So case fatality rate is when someone is actually tested for a disease, presents to care, and is diagnosed with the disease, and then how many people die out of that group.

01:32:38.565 --> 01:32:47.610
Infection fatality rate is, well, of all the infections that exist, including ones that we weren't able to openly diagnose, what's the rate of fatality in that group?

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:50.852
And it was 100X different in H1N1.

01:32:52.713 --> 01:32:54.875
And so this got you interested then.

01:32:54.955 --> 01:32:56.897
So they're on a script, you see.

01:32:56.977 --> 01:32:58.659
He's not, didn't know that.

01:32:58.699 --> 01:32:59.660
He knew that already.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:00.701
He was already there.

01:33:00.761 --> 01:33:01.701
It's like a lead in.

01:33:01.761 --> 01:33:03.323
It's like a toss back and forth.

01:33:03.383 --> 01:33:11.170
It's like Dr. Kendra and Dr. Hooker in that Zoom meeting where Kendra's like, hey, Dr. Hooker, isn't that about B cells and T cells?

01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:13.412
What do you know about antibodies and B cells?

01:33:22.486 --> 01:33:24.489
I mean, when COVID came around, I imagine.

01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:26.551
It looked like a repeat to me, right?

01:33:26.611 --> 01:33:30.817
So it looked like the people were finding enormously high case fatality rates.

01:33:30.877 --> 01:33:32.679
I think like World Health Organization said 3.4%.

01:33:32.719 --> 01:33:39.467
There was a piece published in JAMA in February that said, you know, Journal of American Medical Association that said 2.2%.

01:33:42.267 --> 01:33:48.356
And these are, now I know we did a lot of this, so I'm just going to fast forward to a random point and see what we find.

01:33:48.436 --> 01:33:49.758
Cause I haven't watched it yet.

01:33:49.898 --> 01:33:50.960
I have to confess.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.021
I haven't watched it yet.

01:33:52.101 --> 01:33:52.241
So.

01:33:53.004 --> 01:33:53.844
I don't know what there is.

01:33:53.944 --> 01:33:59.807
I could actually miss the biggest nugget by doing this, but I also wanna be done in about 20 minutes.

01:33:59.887 --> 01:34:01.067
So just see what I get.

01:34:01.087 --> 01:34:02.428
These are terrifying numbers.

01:34:02.448 --> 01:34:10.471
These are the kind of numbers that would cause you to lock down the entire planet instantly because you're gonna lose that percentage of your population if everybody gets infected.

01:34:10.972 --> 01:34:14.413
So it's kind of like what Kevin McCarran was saying in March of 2020, right?

01:34:14.453 --> 01:34:21.436
It's just like what Kevin McCarran has been saying since March 2020, still saying in 2024 and every year, it's the worst case scenario.

01:34:25.632 --> 01:34:32.615
And all you need to do is believe that the worst case scenario is possible, and then you can justify almost anything.

01:34:33.616 --> 01:34:36.217
That's one of the key issues to understand here.

01:34:36.797 --> 01:34:50.383
The way that the national security state is set up to respond, you just have to believe the worst case scenario is possible, and then all of these preparatory activities, all of these layers of the response are justified.

01:34:51.325 --> 01:35:04.558
The very language of the PREP Act is assuming that the gain of function is real and that bioweapons can be made which can kill the entire planet like Kim Dotcom thinks are much better than nukes.

01:35:08.723 --> 01:35:09.443
okay, we're gonna go forward.

01:35:09.463 --> 01:35:10.724
Millions and millions of people dead.

01:35:10.884 --> 01:35:11.064
Right.

01:35:11.124 --> 01:35:13.365
If that number is, in the United States alone.

01:35:13.546 --> 01:35:14.386
Alone, right.

01:35:14.546 --> 01:35:15.907
If the number is right.

01:35:17.267 --> 01:35:18.548
But that was what happened to H1N1.

01:35:18.568 --> 01:35:22.290
I thought, okay, well, do we really know how many people actually have it?

01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:30.374
And now, you're on team denial because you did science that doesn't support the press narrative of X, Y, and Z. Yeah, I mean, I think,

01:35:31.895 --> 01:35:35.118
what I was taught in public health.

01:35:35.218 --> 01:35:35.999
That was a nice one.

01:35:36.059 --> 01:35:43.845
So he, XYZ, he can't even be specific enough to say what it is that he's not supposed to talk about or what it is that he contradicted.

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:44.886
And that's on purpose.

01:35:44.966 --> 01:35:49.510
That lack of specificity makes this enchantment more effective.

01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.011
Why?

01:35:50.451 --> 01:35:56.176
Because it allows the listener to fill in what X, Y, and Z are and assume that they're getting it right.

01:35:57.731 --> 01:36:08.138
It's neuro-linguistic programming, ladies and gentlemen, and you can just catch it by going to a random portion of, I just went forward random and got it instantly.

01:36:08.318 --> 01:36:12.361
Because we actually give people the right information, the true information.

01:36:13.502 --> 01:36:20.487
unduly stoked panic just in order to get the result we want, which is essentially you're gonna comply with this order or that order.

01:36:21.047 --> 01:36:21.708
We don't do that.

01:36:22.668 --> 01:36:28.072
We tell people, okay, here are the risks, here are the, and people are, you know, we have to trust people to.

01:36:28.432 --> 01:36:32.315
So they're being honest about the real risks of the virus.

01:36:32.355 --> 01:36:35.357
They're being honest about the real biology of immunity.

01:36:35.397 --> 01:36:40.521
They're being honest about nothing because they're making everybody accept

01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:48.824
that there is a virus that you have to consider the danger of and that actually, like it or not, he could be wrong about.

01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:53.206
React to that appropriately.

01:36:53.486 --> 01:36:56.268
Not many times they won't, but many times they will.

01:36:56.708 --> 01:37:05.952
But on net, if you want to maintain trust in the public health community, the absolute first thing we have to do is tell them the absolute truth about what we know and what we don't know.

01:37:06.365 --> 01:37:24.183
And yesterday, for example, when Vinay Prasad made fun of people trying to mask kids at daycare centers, but not when they're in the nap, actually kind of implied that if they masked them during their naps, then it would make sense and be a consistent policy, and then he wouldn't have any problem with it.

01:37:24.623 --> 01:37:30.429
But it's the lack of consistency in the masking policy that made it questionable and lost the trust in the system.

01:37:33.762 --> 01:37:46.473
So make sure you understand how complex this web of lies is if they are scripted to make you feel like you came really close to saying something profound, but you didn't, because that's what they've been doing since day one.

01:37:47.154 --> 01:37:54.260
It's felt like they're really saying what I'm thinking, but actually they're just telling you that there is a virus that could kill millions of people.

01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.761
I mean, billions, perhaps.

01:37:56.201 --> 01:37:59.144
Just depends on the numbers that people calculate.

01:38:01.092 --> 01:38:05.273
So what you've nailed here, again, is something I talk with Vinay Prasad on the show about, which is authenticity.

01:38:05.353 --> 01:38:06.553
We suck at it in medicine.

01:38:06.973 --> 01:38:10.434
We prevaricate, we think we don't trust the public to do the right thing.

01:38:10.814 --> 01:38:12.774
We are paternalistic to a fault.

01:38:12.814 --> 01:38:17.015
So when Monica was on the show yesterday, she said, you know, I'm an HIV researcher, I believe in harm reduction.

01:38:17.415 --> 01:38:19.776
So Monica is also on his show a lot.

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:26.157
She's also an Indian who purports to be some kind of infectious disease expert, and she's on all the time with this guy.

01:38:27.594 --> 01:38:37.217
How dare us preach at people, wear a mask, you dummy, you stupid person, and do you wanna kill grandmothers and this and this and this?

01:38:37.237 --> 01:38:40.519
That's not the way to communicate public health.

01:38:40.579 --> 01:38:45.960
You communicate the uncertainty, but you- He doesn't disagree with the idea or the intention.

01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:47.861
He just thinks they're the wrong words.

01:38:49.082 --> 01:38:49.842
Stop lying!

01:38:51.428 --> 01:38:54.471
to communicate what we know and her whole thing as well.

01:38:54.491 --> 01:38:58.776
If mass reduce inoculum and it's a low risk intervention, then maybe you guys should do that, right?

01:38:58.796 --> 01:38:59.537
But it's your decision.

01:39:00.117 --> 01:39:01.058
I don't wanna mandate it.

01:39:01.178 --> 01:39:11.950
And so that Monica Gandhi spent hours and hours on his podcast talking about inoculum and what that means in her lingo is that it depends on how many viruses you're exposed to.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.401
You know, Stephen Hatfield will tell you that kids carry a lot of viruses.

01:39:16.421 --> 01:39:17.442
They're really infectious.

01:39:17.462 --> 01:39:19.242
They have a very high viral load.

01:39:19.282 --> 01:39:20.723
And so they're really dangerous.

01:39:20.743 --> 01:39:23.024
You got to wear an apron when you're interacting with them.

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.445
They should have a separate shitter.

01:39:27.986 --> 01:39:35.909
And so she spent a lot of time talking about how, you know, if you're like a teacher and you get a very high inoculum, then you could have a very severe case.

01:39:35.949 --> 01:39:39.470
But if you get a very low inoculum, then it could be a little bit more like a vaccine.

01:39:40.583 --> 01:39:42.464
Holy shit, these people are awful.

01:39:42.704 --> 01:39:46.447
And if we get 80% compliance according to our data, maybe that's a tipping point.

01:39:46.487 --> 01:39:48.528
But you know, again, it's a hypothesis.

01:39:49.188 --> 01:39:51.590
Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, I'd amend that a little bit.

01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:53.151
So I mean, I agree with that actually.

01:39:53.491 --> 01:39:54.351
But the only thing I'd amend.

01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:55.372
He agrees with that.

01:39:55.392 --> 01:39:56.573
He's not a biologist.

01:39:57.293 --> 01:40:01.257
He doesn't know jack shit about virology, but he's an expert on H1N1.

01:40:01.597 --> 01:40:05.601
And yeah, it's just crazy.

01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:12.328
It's absolutely crazy how awful this guy played me, how many times he just lied to me.

01:40:13.849 --> 01:40:16.552
Because in 2020, he is an expert on all this shit.

01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:22.989
And it's related to the harm you really, really are seeing.

01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:29.697
So if we really are seeing it's a 3% mortality disease, yeah, then I'm okay with more aggressive.

01:40:31.379 --> 01:40:34.323
But if on the other hand, we're really uncertain about that 3%, which we were.

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:38.492
If we really don't know, we should tell people.

01:40:38.792 --> 01:40:40.493
Look, it's looking like 3%, but we don't know.

01:40:40.553 --> 01:40:41.134
Let's see.

01:40:41.774 --> 01:40:50.461
The fact that this man is on this podcast in 2020 talking about this bullshit makes him a traitor to our American kids.

01:40:52.062 --> 01:40:56.666
The American government has currently been infiltrated more or less by a Trojan horse.

01:40:57.206 --> 01:41:00.449
The Trojan horse is Secretary Kennedy.

01:41:02.802 --> 01:41:12.784
and everybody that he brought in, or let's say allowed to be brought in because everybody was cheering because Bobby Kennedy's HHS secretary, good thing that, oh, we win.

01:41:17.125 --> 01:41:22.666
Meanwhile, this guy, this liar is the head of NIH.

01:41:22.726 --> 01:41:28.867
And I will say liar because he played me for years pretending that he was my friend.

01:41:30.262 --> 01:41:34.783
met me at multiple barbecues, pretending he was my friend.

01:41:34.803 --> 01:41:36.463
He just happened to show up there again.

01:41:37.203 --> 01:41:38.224
Good to see you, Jay.

01:41:38.984 --> 01:41:47.585
And the last time that happened, he took three separate moments to tell me, man, you got to teach more biology and stop saying Robert Malone's name.

01:41:47.605 --> 01:41:49.566
You know, it's just not, it's not really helpful.

01:41:49.606 --> 01:41:50.526
It's not constructive.

01:41:50.946 --> 01:41:55.867
And I could soon be the head of NIH and I could really help your family once I get there.

01:41:56.846 --> 01:41:58.967
just got to stop mentioning Robert Malone.

01:41:59.027 --> 01:42:10.369
Now for me to make that story up would be pretty diabolical and pretty malevolent and pretty off sort of the last five years of just trying to tell the truth and see what happens.

01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:13.690
And so there you have it.

01:42:14.931 --> 01:42:15.931
This guy admitted

01:42:16.946 --> 01:42:20.067
without actually saying it, that Robert Malone is behind this.

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:21.668
Robert Malone is behind him.

01:42:21.788 --> 01:42:44.217
Robert Malone is behind the hijacking of, and probably the sabotaging of the FDA, effectively to allow the back rollout of PCR diagnostics, the generation of all these remnant streams, and more importantly, the introduction of all these new technologies that are better than the first generation, that he actually joked about with,

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:54.078
The previous generation of mRNA vaccines, he's joking about it because he always knew that's where this was going.

01:42:54.179 --> 01:43:02.490
Just the same way he always knew that using an AAV, an adenovirus, an ADV to transfect people was gonna be bad.

01:43:03.703 --> 01:43:05.605
but it would be a great story to tell everybody.

01:43:05.625 --> 01:43:08.087
We'll pull that off the market and make us look like champions.

01:43:08.127 --> 01:43:11.910
And then later on, five years later, we can tell them that, well, we rushed it.

01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:15.834
And so there was endotoxin and DNA in the shots.

01:43:15.894 --> 01:43:19.057
So they weren't perfect, but the next round will be even better.

01:43:20.199 --> 01:43:22.920
Or maybe we'll put it in a different place using electroporation.

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:31.882
This guy is a puppet of a intelligence operation that basically put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:31.902 --> 01:43:38.783
at the head of HHS so he could do whatever the F they wanted to with the organizations in HHS.

01:43:40.204 --> 01:43:45.445
That's why Marty Makary is so good on camera and so good at being on Face the Nation.

01:43:46.772 --> 01:43:48.354
and why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:43:48.394 --> 01:43:51.898
is not on Face the Nation and PBS NewsHour, but just clips of him are.

01:43:53.579 --> 01:43:56.683
It's very bad, ladies and gentlemen, but we can wake up as a country.

01:43:56.743 --> 01:43:57.624
We can wake up.

01:43:58.463 --> 01:44:00.725
Here's what we're doing to try to figure it out, right?

01:44:00.785 --> 01:44:15.195
We should just be honest about what we don't know I think that's to me has been the most shocking thing that we've done that the public health people and doctors have dawned this mantle of Absolute knowledge in an in a place where I've read a lot of this literature We there's a lot we don't a lot.

01:44:15.275 --> 01:44:17.917
I don't know even though I've been reading the literature scientifically, right?

01:44:17.937 --> 01:44:20.019
So we just don't know we should say that and

01:44:20.279 --> 01:44:22.620
Why is it bad to say that when we just don't know?

01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:30.283
You know, and what it does, there's a side effect of that, that we're seeing now, which is when doctors and public health officials say, don't wear a mask.

01:44:31.864 --> 01:44:35.345
And then in the next breath, wear a mask of any kind.

01:44:35.445 --> 01:44:38.386
I don't care if it's just lace panties over your face, wear that.

01:44:39.227 --> 01:44:40.787
We look like idiots.

01:44:40.947 --> 01:44:49.071
And on top of that, the public then, which isn't as dumb as they're portrayed by the intellectual elite, goes, now, wait a minute.

01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:50.251
And they should.

01:44:50.332 --> 01:44:51.152
And they should.

01:44:51.172 --> 01:44:55.055
And then what happens is, and you see it in the comments to my own videos, right?

01:44:55.095 --> 01:44:59.097
If I do a video kind of leaning in one direction, a billion people comment the other direction.

01:44:59.137 --> 01:45:01.839
If I lean in that other direction, a billion people comment.

01:45:02.119 --> 01:45:04.561
The public just is trying to find truth.

01:45:04.781 --> 01:45:09.904
And just like Joe Rogan's guest a few weeks ago revealed, they can do experiments with it, right?

01:45:09.944 --> 01:45:20.330
They can see what happens if they change a few words in a post and show those posts to half the people and change the words to different words and show those posts to the other half of the people.

01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:24.972
And I hate to break it to you, ladies and gentlemen, but they did these experiments already years ago.

01:45:25.032 --> 01:45:26.253
They already know how to do it.

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:29.502
They knew how to do that before the pandemic.

01:45:29.762 --> 01:45:32.683
That's the reason why the pandemic was successful.

01:45:33.243 --> 01:45:37.004
Because when we went to resist it, we fractured.

01:45:38.344 --> 01:45:39.645
And then we fractured again.

01:45:40.425 --> 01:45:53.949
And then we rolled in our own little hamster wheels about natural immunity, or lab leak, or amyloidosis, or the VAERS data, or cardiac problems, or whatever the hamster wheel was that we got caught in.

01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:56.150
And those hamster wheels were only possible

01:45:57.130 --> 01:46:02.653
because they already knew and had already weaponized social media against us.

01:46:03.254 --> 01:46:11.939
The actual buyout of Twitter was also just an orchestrated stunt to get more people to accept Twitter as the freest version of social media.

01:46:22.888 --> 01:46:23.388
And it's tough.

01:46:23.428 --> 01:46:24.789
I mean, you know, that's okay.

01:46:24.949 --> 01:46:26.310
Like we're having a conversation.

01:46:26.851 --> 01:46:27.892
There's stuff I'm learning from you.

01:46:28.192 --> 01:46:29.513
I hope there's some stuff you're learning from me.

01:46:29.613 --> 01:46:32.235
And we basically, that's what science is.

01:46:32.555 --> 01:46:36.339
It's a conversation that leads to more data, that leads to more conversation.

01:46:36.819 --> 01:46:37.399
That's what it is.

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:44.325
So what you just said is absolutely reasonable and rational and Buzzfeed attacks your family.

01:46:44.785 --> 01:46:45.886
Yeah, so I mean,

01:46:47.148 --> 01:46:48.190
That was tough, I have to say.

01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:49.473
I mean, that was probably the hardest part.

01:46:49.513 --> 01:46:50.194
That was tough.

01:46:50.274 --> 01:46:51.417
They attacked his family.

01:46:51.457 --> 01:46:54.362
I guess they told a story about his wife or something like that.

01:46:54.402 --> 01:46:55.504
And so that was pretty tough.

01:46:56.581 --> 01:47:01.784
You know, didn't lose his faculty position, didn't lose his job, got the head of the NIH.

01:47:01.824 --> 01:47:03.585
You know, it's pretty tough being him.

01:47:03.945 --> 01:47:09.208
It's pretty hard to be Jay Bhattacharya, lots of racism in America.

01:47:10.769 --> 01:47:14.291
The whole work on this was just feeling like I dragged my family into something.

01:47:14.531 --> 01:47:16.432
If there's one thing to go after me, it's another thing.

01:47:16.792 --> 01:47:19.234
Ten minutes ago, he said it was an exciting time.

01:47:21.738 --> 01:47:24.062
He likes these cloak and dagger games, I guess.

01:47:24.082 --> 01:47:28.410
He likes being an intelligence agent and finally getting called on stage.

01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:30.914
Man, I've been waiting for this for 20 years.

01:47:31.535 --> 01:47:33.459
But in any case, let's leave me aside.

01:47:35.499 --> 01:47:39.243
So we put this paper out.

01:47:40.283 --> 01:47:43.306
Let me see if I can try to get us back on narrative.

01:47:43.686 --> 01:47:45.428
I got to remember what Robert told me.

01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:53.235
Find this number, 0.2 to 0.3, and then a whole series of studies start coming out from around the world to find the same number.

01:47:55.407 --> 01:48:01.532
Many of them published, you know, it's the... So the signal couldn't always have been there.

01:48:01.632 --> 01:48:03.974
It's just a new signal that's everywhere on earth.

01:48:04.014 --> 01:48:06.476
Do you see how much of a liar this guy is?

01:48:06.536 --> 01:48:21.609
Because after six years of being my friend or five years of being my friend, where I tried desperately to explain to him that even his own data doesn't tell him anything because he didn't invent the fricking test or define the test that he used, he just bought something.

01:48:23.248 --> 01:48:24.350
ordered it from China.

01:48:29.437 --> 01:48:33.583
And if these things were all confirmed all around the world, they don't tell you anything.

01:48:33.623 --> 01:48:35.966
If you don't have any data before 2020, you lying traitor.

01:48:39.147 --> 01:48:45.471
It doesn't take anybody with that many degrees from Stanford very long to understand what I'm trying to say there.

01:48:45.891 --> 01:48:51.014
And yet it seems to have taken at least three barbecues and three years for him to still not understand it.

01:48:51.374 --> 01:48:53.535
But he's really sharp in this video.

01:48:54.456 --> 01:48:58.318
September, 2020, he's an expert on all things virology.

01:48:59.909 --> 01:49:02.171
peer-reviewed literature, I think, now has established it.

01:49:02.592 --> 01:49:03.933
So let me ask a question, though.

01:49:04.373 --> 01:49:04.734
So what?

01:49:05.154 --> 01:49:08.437
Two to three times a flu is still catastrophic, man.

01:49:08.978 --> 01:49:11.160
Well, how do you respond to that?

01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.141
No, it is.

01:49:12.161 --> 01:49:14.503
And there's also, I'd amend that, there's also no vaccine.

01:49:14.743 --> 01:49:16.605
Right, no vaccine and we didn't have treatment.

01:49:16.645 --> 01:49:17.786
Yeah, absolutely.

01:49:17.806 --> 01:49:19.888
It is worse than the flu for those reasons.

01:49:19.908 --> 01:49:20.268
Thank you.

01:49:20.809 --> 01:49:22.390
Because I think that the denial of

01:49:23.294 --> 01:49:27.856
I think a lot of people perceive a denial, this comparison with flu is very charged.

01:49:27.976 --> 01:49:29.556
And the truth is, yeah.

01:49:29.716 --> 01:49:30.497
It's worse than the flu.

01:49:30.517 --> 01:49:41.161
And I think- I started to suspect Robert Malone pretty early, but he never really confirmed anything until the change in the scheduling of my Defender podcast.

01:49:41.221 --> 01:49:49.004
So my Defender podcast, which was in the end of 2022 or October of 2020, I don't remember exactly the date off the top of my head, but it was 2022.

01:49:50.024 --> 01:49:52.405
That Defender podcast was originally

01:49:54.193 --> 01:49:55.374
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:49:55.534 --> 01:50:00.859
called me and asked me if I would record a podcast with him and scheduled it for the following week.

01:50:01.019 --> 01:50:02.560
And it was going to be an hour.

01:50:04.042 --> 01:50:04.802
That's what he told me.

01:50:04.842 --> 01:50:06.504
We usually record for an hour.

01:50:07.524 --> 01:50:09.126
So you can have as much time as you want.

01:50:10.501 --> 01:50:25.811
And then only a couple of days before the scheduled recording date, his nephew, who's the producer of the show, called me to say that you're only going to have seven minutes, and we're going to have at least two people, Robert Malone and Meryl Nass, respond to your presentation.

01:50:26.831 --> 01:50:32.095
And then they added even two more, with Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose.

01:50:32.695 --> 01:50:38.339
And I got seven minutes, and I was just, I'm still shocked.

01:50:39.292 --> 01:50:58.025
I felt so discombobulated and so confused for those three days before the podcast occurred as I tried to distill down the number of slides I had that Robert Malone was making fun that at some point I started with 130 slides and he asked if that was a joke.

01:50:59.006 --> 01:50:59.966
I have those emails.

01:51:01.207 --> 01:51:03.189
This is all real time

01:51:04.255 --> 01:51:09.498
awakening to these people's meddling and their lying and their two-faced behavior.

01:51:10.759 --> 01:51:12.060
I didn't want to know.

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:13.941
I thought they were good people.

01:51:15.542 --> 01:51:19.905
I thought I was joining a team of patriots.

01:51:23.095 --> 01:51:29.442
for older people, it is absolutely, we should treat it like it's much worse than the flu because it is worse than the flu.

01:51:30.102 --> 01:51:32.705
So for instance, nursing homes, right?

01:51:32.745 --> 01:51:38.231
So I just looked at a paper that said that nursing homes often share staff workers.

01:51:38.832 --> 01:51:39.512
So like one,

01:51:40.479 --> 01:51:42.320
often share staff workers.

01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:50.345
So now we're talking about whether or not the staff workers at old folks homes are responsible for transmission of the virus between homes.

01:51:50.765 --> 01:51:54.407
It has nothing to do with clearing the ICU using dexamethasone.

01:51:55.646 --> 01:51:57.006
Nah, nothing to do with that.

01:51:57.367 --> 01:52:09.530
Staff worker works in nursing home A also works in nursing home B. We should be using our testing resources to make sure that when shared staff workers move back and forth, they don't bring the virus back and forth with them across these.

01:52:09.570 --> 01:52:13.791
So we should be testing staff workers to make sure that they're safe to move around.

01:52:13.851 --> 01:52:16.952
That means that we should also be testing people on Hollywood sets.

01:52:17.412 --> 01:52:22.934
That means that mandating the vaccine when it comes out won't be crazy.

01:52:25.768 --> 01:52:38.679
And so if he calls for a vaccine or makes a story about how we don't have a vaccine yet, so some of these measures are necessary, you will see him for the naked traitor that he is.

01:52:39.957 --> 01:52:40.477
nursing homes.

01:52:40.497 --> 01:52:48.701
That seems like a completely reasonable outcome of the fact that older people are much more vulnerable, especially people with comorbid conditions.

01:52:49.061 --> 01:52:51.842
And you've been a big advocate of protecting vulnerable groups.

01:52:51.862 --> 01:52:58.906
Yeah, that's the whole point of this is to learn who really should we be using our relatively limited resources to protect.

01:52:59.646 --> 01:53:04.008
And when we raise alarm, who should we be doing it for?

01:53:05.424 --> 01:53:06.805
their cost of raising alarm, right?

01:53:06.825 --> 01:53:10.847
So like if I panic you, you may take actions.

01:53:11.047 --> 01:53:13.609
That's the whole point of the raising the panic and the alarm.

01:53:13.969 --> 01:53:20.973
But those actions will have very little effect or much less effect on the spread than the cost that you pay and society pays for those actions.

01:53:21.333 --> 01:53:23.334
The spread is real.

01:53:23.975 --> 01:53:25.716
Don't make any mistakes here.

01:53:25.756 --> 01:53:27.717
The spread is very real to Jay.

01:53:28.737 --> 01:53:35.361
And the problem with those costs are they're often intangibles, like the- And the murder in New York City stopped, right?

01:53:35.381 --> 01:53:46.568
There was five weeks of either mass death, like a bomb went off, or it was just mass murder, or death certificate fraud, or something like that, a combination of things.

01:53:46.748 --> 01:53:48.709
That's already long over in September of 2020.

01:53:50.254 --> 01:53:53.696
I have had fans who've become fans of my show since we started.

01:53:53.736 --> 01:54:01.219
In September, 2020, we're bringing the college kids back and we're debating whether or not that's good or whether we're gonna kill half a million people.

01:54:01.959 --> 01:54:16.566
Richard Ebright is arguing in November of 2020 that if we opened all of these schools without the testing and stuff, we're gonna kill a quarter million Americans by Christmas.

01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:20.711
That's what the context is of this conversation.

01:54:38.325 --> 01:54:44.507
the medical establishment was complicit with because they are seeing it on the front lines in a very biased way.

01:54:44.807 --> 01:54:48.828
Oh my God, my ICU is full of people who are dying, including some young people.

01:54:49.428 --> 01:54:54.649
And therefore anything we can do to get the public to behave is gonna be important, right?

01:54:54.690 --> 01:54:56.210
And then what ends up happening is these...

01:54:56.770 --> 01:55:01.034
poor individuals who have a tendency to anxiety are losing their minds.

01:55:01.234 --> 01:55:08.301
So they tell me, I watch your show because you seem rational and you have opposing viewpoints and you're not just saying we're all gonna die.

01:55:08.321 --> 01:55:12.405
And I think, why should I be the one who's doing that?

01:55:12.425 --> 01:55:13.526
Well, you have a good audience.

01:55:13.546 --> 01:55:15.387
Yeah, but that ought to be the general.

01:55:16.028 --> 01:55:17.469
You have a good audience.

01:55:18.190 --> 01:55:19.111
You could be useful.

01:55:20.641 --> 01:55:27.948
I don't really understand it, but it seems like people want, especially the press, seems to want to create this panic.

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:39.849
So every time there's a study that comes out that a child has died, which has happened, absolutely, for this disease, you're gonna get this panicked headline from the press.

01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:48.936
Now, one of the things I've learned from the seroprevalence studies, again, from around the world now, not just mine, is that there's a very wide range of clinical presentations from this disease.

01:55:49.536 --> 01:55:51.278
It ranges from somewhere between 30.

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:55.703
A very wide clinical presentation of this disease.

01:55:55.763 --> 01:55:58.386
It sounds a little bit like autism spectrum disorder.

01:55:58.427 --> 01:56:00.529
You know, it's a wide clinical presentation.

01:56:00.569 --> 01:56:07.918
You can have people that can have YouTube channels, or you can have people with 12 times a day projectile diarrhea that bang their head into the wall.

01:56:08.719 --> 01:56:11.021
I mean, it's a wide spectrum of stuff.

01:56:11.421 --> 01:56:13.583
And with COVID, it can be anything.

01:56:13.643 --> 01:56:17.506
I mean, really, you know, I mean, urinary tract infection could be viral.

01:56:17.546 --> 01:56:19.207
You better not give antibiotics for that.

01:56:19.487 --> 01:56:23.150
It could also be multi-system inflammatory sepsis shit.

01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:25.071
Like, it can be a lot of stuff.

01:56:25.171 --> 01:56:29.575
And, you know, I'm just an economist and whatever, but I'm an expert in all of this stuff.

01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:33.838
Cause I did three seroprevalence studies and used to work for the major league baseball owners.

01:56:35.118 --> 01:56:38.059
80 to 40% of the people that get it have no symptoms whatsoever.

01:56:38.239 --> 01:56:42.141
They can't remember, they have the antibodies, but they have no symptoms that they can remember from it.

01:56:45.042 --> 01:56:48.003
Even, you know, maybe even a larger part have relatively mild symptoms.

01:56:48.043 --> 01:56:48.663
It's like a cold.

01:56:50.183 --> 01:56:55.105
And a small fraction have this horrible viral pneumonia that kills them, right?

01:56:56.125 --> 01:57:00.867
We focus all our- This horrible viral pneumonia, which is a horrible lie.

01:57:03.308 --> 01:57:04.969
There is no viral pneumonia.

01:57:05.089 --> 01:57:05.729
It's a lie.

01:57:06.429 --> 01:57:07.130
Understand that.

01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:08.670
Viral pneumonia is a myth.

01:57:10.731 --> 01:57:16.493
Our attention on the viral pneumonia and none on the fact that 998 people are gonna recover from it.

01:57:16.953 --> 01:57:20.015
Yeah, that's a feel good hit of the summer right there.

01:57:20.055 --> 01:57:24.996
Like that's a positive story and they're gonna develop immunity and this whole panic about, well, no, we're never immune.

01:57:25.257 --> 01:57:26.177
That's another press thing.

01:57:26.517 --> 01:57:28.639
Yeah, that's insane.

01:57:28.679 --> 01:57:29.920
No other virus does that, right?

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:30.500
Exactly.

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:41.068
And the related piece to that, like you said, one story about a child, M-I-S-E-A, HIV, I guess strep throat, you also can't have a vaccine.

01:57:41.308 --> 01:57:42.489
Oh yeah, HIV.

01:57:42.549 --> 01:57:50.355
The other thing that he's an expert in and did a lot of epidemiology for, like a lot of other Indians that we know that were in this, like Murthy,

01:57:51.624 --> 01:57:57.014
Vivek Murthy and like, you know, Rochelle Walensky, both trained in HIV, both Indians.

01:57:57.115 --> 01:58:00.522
They were pretty prominent role at this time too, weren't they?

01:58:04.065 --> 01:58:09.828
Holy shit, if you don't see it now, we got a big problem on our hands, and I'm a racist, crazy person.

01:58:10.209 --> 01:58:14.211
Actually, it's a legitimate scientific question, but it's the one we now have an answer to.

01:58:14.351 --> 01:58:14.591
Right.

01:58:14.691 --> 01:58:16.652
You do develop immunity to this virus.

01:58:17.393 --> 01:58:25.698
And the thing is, because we have now millions of cases, and we can- You do develop immunity, the exact same myth about the novel virus that

01:58:27.119 --> 01:58:37.509
Mike Eden was making the argument of, wait until you watch my stream with Mike Eden and Paul Alexander again, because Mike Eden is squirming.

01:58:38.150 --> 01:58:39.711
He is struggling.

01:58:40.132 --> 01:58:50.662
He is looking at a script to his left and trying to figure out how in the hell do I use this shitty script to respond to this guy because it ain't working.

01:58:52.321 --> 01:59:19.711
Tomorrow I will show you a video of me talking to Mike Eden and him looking like a traitor Today I'm showing you a video of Jay Bhattacharya that is Not very good for his track record and not very good for him as my friend He's looking really

01:59:20.729 --> 01:59:32.573
like a liar, like a traitor, and part of a very elaborate Trojan horse operation, probably scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, using Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:32.633 --> 01:59:34.873
as the ultimate Truman Show Trojan horse.

01:59:36.394 --> 01:59:40.755
Look, and there's been like, I think, two documented cases of actual reinfection.

01:59:41.095 --> 01:59:42.535
One was like, it was totally mild.

01:59:42.576 --> 01:59:43.756
The other was more severe.

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:46.237
And so you could think in a population there's variants, right?

01:59:46.417 --> 01:59:47.117
Don't forget,

01:59:48.035 --> 01:59:52.918
The UK never controlled China with the opioids, but they definitely ruled India.

01:59:54.319 --> 01:59:57.901
They definitely ruled China, or sorry, Canada, excuse me.

01:59:58.221 --> 02:00:02.004
They definitely ruled Australia and New Zealand.

02:00:02.064 --> 02:00:03.765
In fact, they're still on their money.

02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:16.732
And so it does feel more and more to me like protectorates of former colonies of the British crown have been used to undermine the American experiment.

02:00:17.172 --> 02:00:25.742
And that traitors, American traitors, seem to be cooperating with Indians or people associated with these other Five Eyes crowny countries.

02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:27.852
I don't have an explanation.

02:00:27.932 --> 02:00:29.135
I just know it's a crime.

02:00:29.635 --> 02:00:31.739
I know it's a multinational operation.

02:00:31.779 --> 02:00:36.828
And I know a lot of the people on the screen that I use are definitely involved.

02:00:36.868 --> 02:00:39.734
And that's why I've had them on the screen for this many years.

02:00:43.091 --> 02:00:44.632
But still... Well, two out of millions, right?

02:00:44.872 --> 02:00:49.275
And as you said, the first case that was a reinfection, it looked like the guy was protected.

02:00:49.355 --> 02:00:52.457
Mild, yeah, which is what you would expect, even with a cold.

02:00:52.757 --> 02:00:57.240
Like you get a cold one year, you may get it again the next year, but it's gonna be minor, mild.

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:05.145
Yeah, if it's the same virus, even if the antibodies fade, you may have T-cells or other mechanisms of immunity that make it...

02:01:05.265 --> 02:01:05.865
T-cells.

02:01:05.905 --> 02:01:06.685
Yeah, that's right.

02:01:06.746 --> 02:01:08.806
I wonder who, oh yeah, that's right.

02:01:08.846 --> 02:01:10.607
Ryan Cole also said T-cells.

02:01:10.667 --> 02:01:12.507
And also, yeah, T-cells.

02:01:12.528 --> 02:01:13.228
Yep, that's good.

02:01:13.268 --> 02:01:17.949
That'll get them running for another year or two while they learn the subtle immunology of that.

02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:28.093
Or if they don't learn the subtle immunology of that and they just take our word for it, they'll just say T-cells every once in a while and it'll be good enough, which is exactly what most or all of them did.

02:01:29.353 --> 02:01:31.134
Because if you take the time to learn

02:01:32.037 --> 02:01:43.143
what T-cells actually are, how complicated they are, he'll start to appreciate the immune system as much more than whatever they're talking about, which is an antibody production line, I guess.

02:01:45.224 --> 02:01:45.805
Much more.

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:49.627
So it's not that you won't get sick, but you'll get sick much less.

02:01:49.827 --> 02:01:50.267
Right.

02:01:50.287 --> 02:01:53.089
It won't create a severe illness.

02:01:53.249 --> 02:01:56.270
Paul Alexander's not Jamaican, and he's Canadian.

02:01:56.290 --> 02:01:56.891
Sorry.

02:01:58.148 --> 02:02:04.302
Now one thing that's gonna come up, and this comes up a lot, again, in the catastrophization camp, but what about the long haulers?

02:02:04.322 --> 02:02:06.286
He is from an island, but it ain't Jamaica.

02:02:06.366 --> 02:02:07.549
I can't remember which one it is.

02:02:08.012 --> 02:02:13.196
the terrible damage to the lungs and the cardiac damage and the brain damage and all the other things.

02:02:13.777 --> 02:02:15.558
You know, those happen with influenza.

02:02:15.718 --> 02:02:16.459
Exactly right.

02:02:16.479 --> 02:02:21.102
So my son, my young son, 13 year old now, a couple of years ago got the flu.

02:02:21.223 --> 02:02:24.745
Now he'd had the flu vaccine and he still got the flu, right?

02:02:24.805 --> 02:02:25.386
Which happens.

02:02:25.466 --> 02:02:26.006
Yeah, it happens.

02:02:26.166 --> 02:02:27.628
I mean, and it was fine.

02:02:27.648 --> 02:02:30.790
Like it was a little worse than I thought you normally would get.

02:02:31.090 --> 02:02:34.413
And he was getting better and he woke up one morning and he couldn't walk.

02:02:34.713 --> 02:02:35.274
Oh my gosh.

02:02:36.694 --> 02:02:42.155
I was going through all the panic things that if you, when you go through medical school, you always have.

02:02:42.175 --> 02:02:43.436
You're like Guillain-Barré.

02:02:43.476 --> 02:02:44.256
That's exactly right.

02:02:44.536 --> 02:02:45.236
Oh, there we go.

02:02:45.276 --> 02:02:47.857
Now we're going to make up a story about vaccine injury.

02:02:47.897 --> 02:02:49.657
They all worked out.

02:02:49.717 --> 02:02:54.818
My son woke up after a flu vaccine, couldn't even walk, but it was just normal and it went away.

02:02:55.298 --> 02:02:57.319
And I'm like, oh God.

02:02:57.899 --> 02:03:00.579
So it turned out it was a benign myositis.

02:03:01.659 --> 02:03:02.160
Thank God.

02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:03.840
And within a week he was walking again.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.761
Flu has all kinds of strange side effects.

02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:09.682
It has neurologic side effects, it can have cardiac side effects.

02:03:10.682 --> 02:03:12.863
We put these in context, right?

02:03:12.903 --> 02:03:24.647
These are things that happen, absolutely can happen, but we have a lot of information about how frequent they are, are they likely, how long-lasting they are, if it was Guillain-Barre it would have been terrible.

02:03:24.927 --> 02:03:26.868
Funny that flu can do all that shit, huh?

02:03:27.008 --> 02:03:27.248
Funny.

02:03:28.088 --> 02:03:30.229
benign myositis at last week and he's okay.

02:03:30.789 --> 02:03:37.311
So that's funny because my daughter had a viral syndrome when she was three and couldn't walk and again benign myositis.

02:03:37.451 --> 02:03:40.031
Holy shit, that's got to be a lie.

02:03:40.091 --> 02:03:41.292
That's ridiculous.

02:03:41.612 --> 02:03:42.692
Oh my gosh.

02:03:42.752 --> 02:03:45.373
Have you ever heard of benign myositis before?

02:03:46.053 --> 02:03:48.214
What a bunch of bullshit.

02:03:48.814 --> 02:03:49.234
Wow.

02:03:51.112 --> 02:03:52.392
But again, you go through the panic.

02:03:52.412 --> 02:03:57.135
So the point being, these things happen with viral infection.

02:03:57.435 --> 02:04:00.978
This is a new viral infection that we don't have a vaccine for.

02:04:01.158 --> 02:04:06.201
The point being that these things happen with a viral infection.

02:04:06.941 --> 02:04:08.002
Holy shit.

02:04:08.795 --> 02:04:20.503
or that is novel to the degree that it's novel, although we seem to have some innate immunity from cross-reactivity to coronavirus, and yet we are spinning it as if the world is ending.

02:04:20.603 --> 02:04:26.468
And the thing is, that would be fine if we thought it was actually gonna cause less harm to spin it that way than not.

02:04:26.568 --> 02:04:27.929
I can't, I can't.

02:04:28.029 --> 02:04:28.889
I know that you could.

02:04:28.949 --> 02:04:30.210
If you wanna, you can go see it.

02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:31.311
It's bad biology.

02:04:31.571 --> 02:04:33.373
It is, these people are traitors.

02:04:34.253 --> 02:04:36.274
And we need to start teaching our kids the way out.

02:04:37.474 --> 02:04:42.015
This has been Gigo and Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:04:42.095 --> 02:04:43.316
I'm actually gonna end it right here.

02:04:43.376 --> 02:04:46.236
I should be playing music and stuff, but I need to get lunch in me quick.

02:04:47.017 --> 02:04:48.697
And I need to get to the gym with my kids.

02:04:49.877 --> 02:04:51.038
I might do a stream later.

02:04:51.098 --> 02:04:52.658
I'll definitely do a stream tomorrow.

02:04:52.758 --> 02:04:56.539
Mark seems to be on a multi home run per day streak.

02:04:56.639 --> 02:05:00.440
So I guess if I don't make anything later this afternoon, I'm sure Mark will.

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:01.681
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:05:01.741 --> 02:05:02.721
I'm just gonna fade out.

02:05:03.281 --> 02:05:04.102
I love you very much.

02:05:04.142 --> 02:05:16.970
If you want to support this work, if you like what I'm doing, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support my family and this absolutely fundamental work to American history and to Americans' future.

02:05:17.711 --> 02:05:18.531
I love you very much.

02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:19.592
Thank you for your support.

02:05:19.672 --> 02:05:20.653
I'll see you again tomorrow.
