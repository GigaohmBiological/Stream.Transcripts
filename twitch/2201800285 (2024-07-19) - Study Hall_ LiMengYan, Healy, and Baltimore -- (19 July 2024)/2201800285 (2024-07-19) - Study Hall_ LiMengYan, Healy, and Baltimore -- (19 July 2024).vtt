WEBVTT

00:07.895 --> 00:08.443
Buzzer.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.514
Oh, look, JC on the bike was timed out by Risa.

02:08.774 --> 02:10.375
Oh, timeout JC on the bike.

02:11.436 --> 02:12.317
JC on the bike.

02:13.157 --> 02:14.298
It's JC on the bike.

02:15.139 --> 02:17.320
It's JC on the bike, yeah.

02:17.981 --> 02:24.105
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning, and I know just the one.

02:25.031 --> 02:27.354
Look it round, it's JC on the bike.

02:27.955 --> 02:30.098
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

02:32.642 --> 02:41.114
So what I argued, and I believe I came up with this independently, but I believe Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar, as has Jonathan Cooey.

02:43.690 --> 02:50.455
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.918
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

02:53.998 --> 03:03.445
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

03:03.465 --> 03:10.050
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:13.689 --> 03:16.771
So SARS-1 and its descendants have gone endemic.

03:16.791 --> 03:17.772
That's what I was just saying.

03:17.812 --> 03:21.154
The current PCR test is not specific for SARS-CoV-2.

03:22.034 --> 03:26.397
And that is known because it's the German company that originally produced it knows that.

03:26.437 --> 03:29.058
They've chosen a short sequence that they think is relevant.

03:29.519 --> 03:34.281
It is a short sequence that just comes from one of the open reading frame one proteins.

03:34.942 --> 03:37.583
We are being duped by a nonspecific test.

03:38.524 --> 03:43.407
And we would have gotten these numbers or numbers very similar to them with or without this pandemic.

03:44.189 --> 03:49.131
Because we've never looked for SARS viruses as they are spread through our population.

03:49.151 --> 03:50.131
We've just never looked.

03:50.972 --> 03:52.892
Nobody sampled for it until this year.

03:54.013 --> 03:55.693
That's a huge point to make.

03:56.574 --> 04:01.256
Because the SARS virus originally appeared in 2003 and disappeared in 2004.

04:02.016 --> 04:04.857
But it didn't really disappear, it just became not a problem.

04:06.209 --> 04:14.552
descendants of that virus of various virulence and infectivity have circulated in the time since.

04:14.652 --> 04:15.712
They didn't disappear.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.574
And this test is not specific for any one of them.

04:21.394 --> 04:30.037
And no one has ever done a study about how many descendants there are, how many people are infected, how many animals have been infected by it, etc.

04:33.218 --> 04:33.378
So

04:33.988 --> 04:57.971
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people, is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us, to ruin maybe America, I don't know, crash the dollar, I don't know, steal the rest of what limited treasury value we have left, I don't know, but I know for sure

04:58.359 --> 05:15.824
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

05:15.844 --> 05:19.365
Follow the rules.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.446
Protect yourself at all times.

05:20.966 --> 05:22.846
Follow my instructions.

05:22.886 --> 05:23.827
Keep it clean.

05:23.847 --> 05:24.827
Touch gloves if you wish.

05:24.867 --> 05:25.227
Let's do it.

05:26.437 --> 05:36.045
sweaty palms this is so crazy like goosebumps this is so crazy i feel so nervous like what in the world man

06:00.546 --> 06:02.489
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

06:03.570 --> 06:08.337
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

06:09.739 --> 06:11.682
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

06:13.064 --> 06:13.805
It's embarrassing.

07:06.695 --> 07:10.958
So I am gonna try and mix up the beginning a little bit.

07:10.998 --> 07:16.762
I'm not always gonna do that elaborate beginning with a new song and listen and DJ and stuff like that because

07:17.822 --> 07:25.708
Um, well, I don't, I think we should save that for the shows where I'm trying to make some kind of summary, um, and differentiate from them.

07:26.169 --> 07:30.252
Um, the last couple of times, the one that's titled, uh, pause the program.

07:31.195 --> 07:56.064
I think is one of the better sort of cracks at the fence I've ever taken because it really summarizes how this was an international kind of operation where media messaging across the globe was weaponized primarily against America, but of course, against the rest of the Five Eyes countries in order to turn them against America, make fun of America, belittle America.

07:57.084 --> 07:58.025
blame America.

07:58.205 --> 08:01.347
And so that operation is ongoing.

08:01.387 --> 08:16.235
And I think a lot of the collaborators in that operation are essentially the same people that are now masquerading as the leaders of the dissident movement in America and their followers and those people that they have bamboozled into following them.

08:16.915 --> 08:26.582
even though in reality they are actors on the same stage that Tony Fauci, Peter Daszak, Ralph Baric, all of these people are on.

08:26.643 --> 08:41.254
Today, for a study hall, I wanted to watch a video of David Baltimore from only a couple years ago, but in order to process this video correctly, I think it's really important for me to give a good enough introduction to it

08:42.934 --> 08:47.736
First of all, just to mention the CrowdStrike Microsoft blue screen problem.

08:48.497 --> 08:53.599
It turns out that this could be a very big deal for some parts of our infrastructure.

08:54.639 --> 09:03.363
I just happened to need to go to PennDOT, which is Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation for some standard renewal kinds of things.

09:04.143 --> 09:08.825
And unfortunately, they couldn't take credit cards, at least that's what they thought.

09:09.705 --> 09:19.535
And so I went back home to get some checks and then I came back and then there was a sign on the door saying their computer system was blue screened and they weren't going to be able to do anything today.

09:20.096 --> 09:23.579
And when I went in to talk to them, they seemed pretty naive as to what was going on.

09:23.599 --> 09:26.842
They're just, we're all kind of standing around and the whole place was empty.

09:28.404 --> 09:36.774
And so this turns out to be something related to at least a majority of it seems to be related to this CrowdStrike antivirus software.

09:36.834 --> 09:40.158
The crazy part about it is, is because of the

09:41.383 --> 09:44.705
Access that this program has when you use it as an antivirus software.

09:44.725 --> 09:49.467
It's I guess at the kernel level Which means that the update that they pushed?

09:50.708 --> 10:00.953
Pushed something into a place of your Microsoft computer that that Microsoft can't push a fix for as I understand so what it may require is

10:01.693 --> 10:09.715
is for every individual machine that uses this CrowdStrike software to need to be rebooted in safe mode.

10:10.195 --> 10:13.916
And then you have to go and manually delete this SYS file.

10:14.696 --> 10:27.919
If that's the case, then some of these companies and some of these corporations that use this on their encrypted servers and this kind of thing could really be in a load of trouble, at least from the perspective of if that's a,

10:28.519 --> 10:39.681
a five minute, a 10 minute operation on a standard computer, then that's a lot of manual stuff that your typical junior analyst might need a little, you know, reminder on how to do.

10:39.781 --> 10:53.963
So that's an interesting development that happened today that you should be aware of that has resulted in, for example, maybe I'm stupid for saying this, but I can't text my family right now, they're out of the country.

10:54.203 --> 10:57.904
And when I text, there's no message of delivered and I can't call.

10:59.305 --> 11:02.587
And so I've heard that there's airlines disrupted from this.

11:02.647 --> 11:13.853
Those airlines, it's very easy for me to imagine that their infrastructure is far from ideal and that their tech and IT infrastructure is far from ideal.

11:14.294 --> 11:22.198
And so there could be lots of little nodes, for example, that people aren't even aware of that, oh my gosh, how do I access that node and fix that one?

11:23.459 --> 11:24.259
I have no idea.

11:24.299 --> 11:26.700
I'm not an IT guy, but I do have friends who are.

11:28.540 --> 11:35.461
And so I know as going through it this morning, I mean, I was in line at the DMV outside, you know, chatting with people and stuff.

11:35.642 --> 11:36.782
I tried to get there early.

11:37.242 --> 11:47.904
And so when it happened, it already, in retrospect, I could see that the DMV people themselves didn't understand what was going on when they came out and said, we're having some system trouble right now.

11:47.964 --> 11:51.905
So maybe we can't take credit cards, but if you have your checkbook, we can do that.

11:52.907 --> 11:57.130
So as this develops, I guess I would just say pay attention.

11:58.291 --> 12:00.733
I don't know how many retailers are affected by this.

12:01.833 --> 12:06.817
I don't know how that's going to go for airlines and travel and how long that will back things up.

12:08.138 --> 12:10.219
But it's something to at least keep on your radar.

12:11.730 --> 12:16.812
if there was gonna be some kind of Klaus Schwab cyber collapse.

12:17.672 --> 12:24.114
It's at least in the realm of possibility that it's something like this that would, you know, let's say start it.

12:25.194 --> 12:28.656
I'm getting a message from somebody who I know needs to travel in the next couple of days.

12:30.076 --> 12:32.397
He says he's only on, it got a 15 minute delay.

12:32.457 --> 12:34.918
So somebody I know who is flying.

12:34.998 --> 12:38.499
So maybe I'm just being a little crazy here and nevermind that.

12:39.804 --> 12:46.867
So I want to get right away to the first subject of the day on the study hall, which is Li Min Yan.

12:46.887 --> 12:58.111
Now Li Min Yan is somebody that I actually met very early on in the pandemic, not in person, but because she or her handlers contacted me and asked if I would like to interview her.

12:58.151 --> 13:05.474
And then that interview went south really quick because the audio of her was echoey and

13:06.394 --> 13:06.894
I don't know.

13:06.914 --> 13:16.440
I could never figure out if it was my setup, because I had never happened again, or if it was their using some person to stream her to me.

13:17.401 --> 13:27.347
But it very much felt like her handler was this billionaire guy, and it kind of felt like I talked to him, but I don't even remember anymore for sure who I talked to before she came on the line.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.487
But there was some echo.

13:29.028 --> 13:35.592
It wrecked the interview, but it sure made me convinced that I was intimately involved in something very scary.

13:36.152 --> 13:39.776
and very exciting and a lot of cloak and dagger happening.

13:40.717 --> 13:43.440
And so I got sucked in also by Li Min Yan.

13:44.301 --> 13:48.706
And Li Min Yan, of course, you know, appeared many, many times on the Steve Bannon show.

13:49.247 --> 13:52.150
And so I thought it would be interesting to watch that now.

13:53.581 --> 13:57.465
I want to bring in now Dr. Li-Ming Yan, formerly from Hong Kong University.

13:57.565 --> 14:08.196
Dr. Yan, thank you so much for joining us in the War Room, and thank you for all the efforts you've done to expose to the American people, to the Chinese people, and to people throughout the world exactly what went on

14:09.057 --> 14:13.700
in Wuhan and with the Chinese Communist Party overall in their handling of this.

14:14.680 --> 14:28.008
First question we have to ask you, how does it feel now that more and more people are starting to realize this was a lab-enhanced virus that came out of the Wuhan lab and that everything that you've been telling people since you got here is actually true?

14:28.028 --> 14:33.470
How does it feel now that the establishment is having to kowtow to Dr. Yang?

14:33.490 --> 14:34.111
How does it feel, ma'am?

14:35.356 --> 14:36.317
Good morning, sir.

14:36.377 --> 14:37.317
Thank you for having me.

14:37.717 --> 14:51.606
So I want to tell people, yeah, I'm happy to say that things got changed and also more and more facts are verified and people realize it come from the lab, it come from Wuhan, it come from Chinese Communist Party.

14:53.087 --> 14:57.229
Now, she comes from Wuhan, it comes from the Chinese Communist Party.

14:57.369 --> 15:00.771
Everybody's finally realizing, I believe this video is from September 2020.

15:03.153 --> 15:11.699
And I know a friend of mine has been using newspapers.com to try and figure out when she started to appear in the media.

15:12.299 --> 15:20.845
And he's already seen an interesting signal around May or April in Canada, at least, which I think he can better explain than me.

15:20.925 --> 15:21.646
But essentially,

15:23.166 --> 15:28.747
Her appearance is around the time when a lot of these other people started to stream a lot, started to do the rounds.

15:29.527 --> 15:36.349
Even Kevin McKernan started to sort of make his rounds on small and large podcasts in April of 2020.

15:38.189 --> 15:45.651
So Dr. Yan actually says in this video, and I will start it at the beginning again, that she started speaking out in January of 2020.

15:46.831 --> 15:50.112
And so that will be admitted in a second here.

15:50.132 --> 15:51.512
Let me just move it back.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.334
and then started again.

15:53.354 --> 16:08.610
So much for joining us in the War Room and thank you for all the efforts you've done to expose to the American people, to the Chinese people, and to people throughout the world exactly what went on in Wuhan and with the Chinese Communist Party overall in their handling of this.

16:09.571 --> 16:12.314
First question we have to ask you, how does it feel now

16:13.836 --> 16:19.700
Soothspider says that her accent is Mandarin and not Cantonese despite coming from Hong Kong.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.302
I assume that Hong Kong should have a Cantonese accent.

16:23.543 --> 16:27.947
Also remember Soothspider, it might be interesting if you have that kind of insight,

16:28.607 --> 16:42.620
for you to take a look at the phone call video where Paul Cottrell gets a phone call supposedly from, I think it's Taiwan, but it might've been Hong Kong, where Remdesivir is the only thing that's working.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.003
And we never really identified who that whistleblower was.

16:46.403 --> 16:51.107
It would be very interesting if comparing voices, you thought maybe it was Li Min Yan.

16:52.268 --> 16:54.931
Anyway, let me play this again or keep this going.

16:55.472 --> 17:04.863
More and more people are starting to realize this was a lab-enhanced virus that came out of the Wuhan lab, and that everything that you've been telling people since you got here is actually true.

17:04.883 --> 17:10.330
How does it feel now that the establishment is having to kowtow to Dr. Yang?

17:10.350 --> 17:10.971
How does it feel, ma'am?

17:12.213 --> 17:13.094
Good morning sir.

17:13.274 --> 17:14.215
Thank you for having me.

17:14.595 --> 17:16.336
So I want to help you.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.118
Yeah I'm happy to say that things get changed.

17:19.419 --> 17:24.883
And also more and more facts are verified and people realize it comes from the lab.

17:24.963 --> 17:26.064
It comes from Wuhan.

17:26.124 --> 17:28.486
It comes from Chinese Communist Party.

17:28.846 --> 17:30.147
And I know it will happen.

17:30.647 --> 17:32.249
And that is the truth.

17:32.309 --> 17:33.129
That is a fact.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.152
I keep telling people that no lies are perfect.

17:36.552 --> 17:40.735
And this is finally can be verified by independent sources.

17:41.176 --> 17:45.099
That's why I dare to tell it from the last January.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.522
That's why I dare to come to you as tell it in front of

17:49.402 --> 17:54.727
the whole world because I know what they have done and they know what they have done.

17:54.987 --> 18:02.593
And they also know they will get punished one day, but they just try to deny and try to get void of the punishment.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.276
That's interesting because she says that she knew it would happen.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.698
Now, of course, she's not a native English speaker.

18:08.718 --> 18:18.206
I don't know if she really means that she knew it would happen already a long time ago, like throughout her career, like when she was, you know, working before the pandemic.

18:18.906 --> 18:24.828
Or if she means, you know, since the start of the pandemic, she knew that this would eventually happen.

18:24.868 --> 18:28.809
It sounds like she kind of always knew that a lab was eventually going to leak.

18:29.369 --> 18:30.870
Labs aren't perfect, she says.

18:30.930 --> 18:33.310
I know she's very hard to understand, but I can understand her.

18:34.771 --> 18:37.012
So if you need any, you know, I can translate.

18:38.112 --> 18:38.552
Oh, darn.

18:40.473 --> 18:41.393
That's not what I wanted.

18:43.297 --> 18:52.327
But I want to also emphasize that without the great effort and help and support from the heroes like you, sir.

18:52.607 --> 18:57.092
So she's going to say here, without the help of the heroes and people like you, sir,

18:57.853 --> 19:10.220
So that's very hard to hear because the R's don't come out very well, but she's going to now try to compliment all the people on our side who have come to her aid and help her get this message out.

19:10.361 --> 19:12.522
All the media outlets that have helped her.

19:12.542 --> 19:15.784
This is a very interesting part of this video.

19:16.289 --> 19:41.108
also emphasize that without the great effort and help and support from the heroes like you sir, like war room people, but I want to also emphasize that without the great effort and help and support from the heroes like you sir, like war room people, and like the National Pulse, and also like Dr. Navarro, like Tucker Carlson, all these people, I mean

19:41.368 --> 19:44.831
Dr. Navarro and Tucker Carlson.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.334
So that's another couple that he mentioned.

19:47.394 --> 19:52.559
So she was probably on videos with Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.501
Maybe she was on with Peter Navarro.

19:55.601 --> 19:56.022
I don't know.

19:56.082 --> 20:00.826
But it's interesting to mention him because Peter Navarro was in the

20:01.886 --> 20:25.442
the little meetings that happened around remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and whether or not to give them EUAs and how to give them EUAs that Janet Woodcock, Rick Bright, Jared Kushner, Peter Navarro, Little Circle, it's interesting that now she's mentioning him on Bannon's program.

20:25.916 --> 20:44.683
I cannot name all of them, but without all this kind of help, apart from the heroes like Yuser, like war room people, and like the National Pulse, and also like Dr. Navarro, like Tucker Carlson, all these people, I mean I cannot name all of them, but without all this kind of help,

20:45.023 --> 20:55.292
the truth cannot be exposed so fast, because the Chinese Communist Party is a big regime, and they know how to manipulate people and information.

20:55.652 --> 21:05.841
So the thing is, I'm happy to say that it's in good progress, and I know that we will reach the day to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable very soon.

21:07.645 --> 21:10.326
Dr. Yan, by the way, you're beloved by this audience.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.667
I want all the audience to get to our social media later.

21:12.707 --> 21:13.888
You're beloved by this audience.

21:13.908 --> 21:15.349
They were so glad to see you.

21:15.369 --> 21:16.369
No, that's not what she said.

21:16.389 --> 21:18.450
Get rid of the punishment.

21:19.291 --> 21:32.537
But I want to also emphasize that without the great effort and help and support from the heroes like you, sir, like war room people and like the National Pulse and also like Dr. Navarro, like

21:32.857 --> 21:35.638
It's hard to hear it, but she says the truth cannot be exposed so fast.

21:54.437 --> 21:57.619
Yeah, oh my gosh, I'm not reading the chat.

21:57.739 --> 21:59.520
I'm not not reading the chat.

21:59.820 --> 22:03.742
...regime, and they know how to manipulate people and information.

22:04.102 --> 22:14.308
So the thing is, I'm happy to say that it's in a good progress, and I know that we will, I mean, reach the day to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable very soon.

22:16.089 --> 22:18.771
Dr. Yan, by the way, you're beloved by this audience.

22:20.232 --> 22:33.921
Now, one thing you might notice here, which I find interesting when I look back on that smile, is that this does not appear to be a person who is actively trying to avoid assassination by the Chinese Communist Party.

22:34.421 --> 22:44.088
Now, I come from Pittsburgh, and early on in the pandemic, somebody by the name of Bing Lu was killed, like right down the street or up the street from me.

22:44.128 --> 22:45.529
And I know it sounds crazy.

22:46.189 --> 23:05.227
now that right up the street from me supposedly lived this this shooter um of Donald Trump in in Butler Pennsylvania last weekend like really a walk from my house but we moved houses two and a half years ago from a house that we were trying to buy and actually lost during the pandemic because of my

23:05.905 --> 23:06.946
My job being ended.

23:07.386 --> 23:22.759
And from that house was a very short drive to where this Bing Lu was shot, supposedly by another Chinese national who was dating or cheating or his girlfriend was cheating with or something like that.

23:23.319 --> 23:30.645
It was a lover's quarrel where this guy died, but he happened to be working on a small protein inhibitor of something.

23:33.274 --> 23:44.496
And so it's a very interesting story that goes along with Li Min Yan, because Li Min Yan is supposedly whistleblowing on more or less her own country.

23:44.816 --> 23:57.799
And it was very much hyped that she was being protected and kept in an undisclosed location so that she couldn't be wiped out, you know, couldn't be erased, if you will.

23:58.464 --> 24:00.329
And so it's very interesting.

24:00.490 --> 24:03.538
It doesn't seem like she's under any duress right now.

24:03.618 --> 24:05.323
She's very, very happy.

24:06.277 --> 24:31.417
to social media later you're beloved by this audience they were so but glad to see on tucker carlson again last night so glad sees retractions there's a lot of talk in washington i want to give the audience inside baseball there's a lot of talk in washington you get jim jordan and and senator ran paul hammering fauci but there's a lot of talk in washington that did that actually to try to force to have hearings and have you as one of the major witnesses i just want to make sure

24:32.498 --> 24:36.081
hearings came up on Capitol Hill and they were done in a fair manner.

24:36.161 --> 24:47.410
Would you be open to testifying in front of a committee about the source of this virus and everything you know as a fact witness of what happened in late December of 2019 and in January of 2020?

24:47.450 --> 24:48.972
Would you commit to that?

24:54.085 --> 24:55.906
Oh, I'm very happy to do so.

24:56.107 --> 25:08.495
And actually, I hope they can do it as a live broadcast so people can watch it and they can see how people provide evidence, no matter from my side or from the other side.

25:08.796 --> 25:12.518
And people can see who is lying and who really have some evidence.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.680
We should have done it before, too.

25:16.281 --> 25:16.761
Wow.

25:16.901 --> 25:22.926
So we should have a live broadcast so we can see who has evidence and who doesn't, who's lying and who isn't.

25:24.246 --> 25:29.490
And so it sure seems like to me that solving the mystery of the origin of this virus is paramount.

25:31.171 --> 25:40.859
And in 2020, it sure seems like to me that there were a lot of these people that were very vested in making sure that we were invested in solving that mystery.

25:40.939 --> 25:47.364
Now, it's curious what my friend Mark found with, I don't think a lot of work,

25:48.444 --> 25:58.487
It's not to say that he doesn't know what he's doing, and he doesn't have good places to look, and he isn't a very skilled archiver, but I guess he's going to say the same thing in this video.

25:58.507 --> 26:07.449
Oh yeah, first of all, I want to back up a little bit and point out that one of the things, if you want to see how this machine works,

26:08.409 --> 26:27.535
Pay close attention to the comments under rumble videos and the comments under YouTube videos because there is another place where Scrolling gives them the ability to if they want to to create an illusion of consensus underneath every video They don't need to do it for motorcycles

26:28.407 --> 26:30.868
They don't need to do it for small engine repair.

26:30.908 --> 26:33.790
They don't need to do it for used car reviews.

26:34.591 --> 26:45.397
But if they wanted to do it for public health topics, if they wanted to do it for public health experts or political pundits, they could definitely do it.

26:45.777 --> 26:50.540
Here's an example where the first comment on Rumble, three years old, is she is a lion.

26:51.688 --> 26:54.770
Ooh, she's a lion.

26:54.890 --> 26:55.590
Great.

26:55.610 --> 26:56.210
I don't know.

26:56.330 --> 26:56.910
I have nothing.

26:56.930 --> 26:57.531
I have nothing.

26:57.591 --> 26:58.151
I know nothing.

26:58.211 --> 27:01.272
Maybe she's from, maybe she's from Venice then.

27:03.493 --> 27:08.015
So she is an NIH funded universal flu vaccine scientist.

27:10.697 --> 27:13.378
I didn't know that when I was put in contact with her.

27:13.418 --> 27:18.000
I just was told she was a virologist from Hong Kong and a whistleblower.

27:19.926 --> 27:29.811
Her primary and principal investigator, the one that she was working with before the pandemic, is named, last name of Kuhn or Poon.

27:30.512 --> 27:31.952
Poon is his last name.

27:32.473 --> 27:33.773
He was on the Lancet letter.

27:37.195 --> 27:39.817
And her history is never questioned.

27:39.897 --> 27:41.778
It's just, she's a whistleblower.

27:41.818 --> 27:42.718
She's a hero.

27:43.599 --> 27:46.000
She's beloved by this audience, he says.

27:47.469 --> 27:55.900
But we're not making clear that if she was who she says she was, then she should fear for her life from both sides of the Pacific Ocean, right?

27:55.940 --> 28:03.631
She should be afraid of the NIH people that she was just recently presenting with before the pandemic.

28:04.421 --> 28:23.207
and she should be also worried about the Chinese Communist Party wanting to assassinate her when she goes to Starbucks I just wanted to record it just for the purposes of showing people that we are not messing around anymore

28:24.653 --> 28:39.285
The backstory here is Li Mengyang, this Chinese scientist who was so upset about this background signal she saw or whatever, this evidence of coronavirus and leaking out of the laboratory in 2020.

28:39.766 --> 28:47.272
And how, of course, the most likely thing to do is to is to contact the Steve Bannon network, which was happy to.

28:47.592 --> 28:48.093
I also.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.621
I also remember hearing that she left her family behind.

28:51.681 --> 28:53.382
I do remember that very well.

28:53.462 --> 28:53.942
Very good.

28:54.142 --> 28:56.964
Give her a flight to Los Angeles, supposedly in 2020.

28:57.804 --> 29:03.767
And she was able to get on the news and talk about how dangerous it was and cleavage sites and probably all kinds of crap like that.

29:04.367 --> 29:08.309
But anyways, it was considered to be super conspiratorial to give her any airtime.

29:08.349 --> 29:09.789
So, of course, people wanted to watch it.

29:10.610 --> 29:12.651
And I have some questions about her backstory.

29:13.471 --> 29:17.393
And it makes me wonder, does anyone else actually do research about this stuff?

29:17.413 --> 29:18.053
Does anyone?

29:19.500 --> 29:36.855
So what we have is her presenting in 2018, this is while she is listed here anyways, with the University of Hong Kong, combined use of live attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines to enhance heterosubtypic protection.

29:37.996 --> 29:42.380
And you will be shocked at how this goes.

29:43.621 --> 29:45.542
It's only a 15-minute presentation.

29:46.602 --> 29:48.103
This is her presenting at the end.

29:48.123 --> 29:51.265
So that's definitely, I mean, I'm pretty sure that's definitely her.

29:51.325 --> 29:54.126
Again, the part is on that particular site.

29:54.766 --> 30:02.550
This was recorded during the Keystone Symposium Conference on framing the response to emerging virus infections.

30:03.431 --> 30:07.613
It's amazing that it was an emerging virus that gave her an opportunity to become so popular.

30:08.533 --> 30:12.275
What's truly incredible about this presentation

30:13.663 --> 30:15.703
Don't have any coffee in your mouth, because you'd be shocked.

30:16.564 --> 30:24.925
The best protection against a lethal challenge of heterologous influenza vaccines is a combination of activated and inactivated vaccines.

30:25.765 --> 30:33.667
But we need further research, which will focus on developing alternative vaccine strategies for universal protection.

30:35.167 --> 30:41.048
It's amazing that she also has the foresight that what we need is a universal flu vaccine

30:42.259 --> 30:44.320
above and beyond just recombinant DNA.

30:44.420 --> 30:48.663
It's almost as if she's saying we need an mRNA or a DNA vaccine.

30:49.744 --> 30:51.405
Wow, who would have thunk it?

30:52.846 --> 31:01.312
But I'm not familiar with this event that she's presenting at here, with this virtual Keystone Symposia, which is really just a platform to record these things.

31:02.092 --> 31:04.093
It says that it's October 14th or 18th.

31:05.945 --> 31:08.486
This event, I guess, took place in Hong Kong.

31:09.447 --> 31:18.711
So if I create an account and if I do some searching on here, if I search search 2018, it'll show content sorted.

31:19.812 --> 31:25.515
And let's see, on November 9th, 2018, we see that she's presenting.

31:25.555 --> 31:29.677
This is the combined use of live, attenuated, inactivated influenza vaccines.

31:30.897 --> 31:38.386
Let's see, two events before, actually afterwards, on January 28th, we have preparing for the next pandemic, emerging infectious disease threat.

31:39.407 --> 31:40.168
Unbelievable!

31:40.669 --> 31:45.795
This platform is also giving a place for Mary and Koopmans of the Erasmus Lab.

31:47.000 --> 31:47.680
And One Health.

31:48.401 --> 31:53.084
Now, of course, this is a online platform used for sharing videos.

31:53.384 --> 31:56.486
It does not mean that they were sitting side by side.

31:56.606 --> 31:57.726
Please, I understand that.

31:58.547 --> 32:05.951
But this platform chooses, let's see here, Li Menyang, Marion Koopmans, Scott Weaver.

32:06.311 --> 32:08.052
He's done a lot of work with Robert Malone.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.714
You bet your bottoms he has.

32:11.134 --> 32:11.955
What else we got here?

32:12.475 --> 32:13.876
Oh, Kizmekia Corbett.

32:15.265 --> 32:15.666
isn't

32:34.153 --> 32:48.147
In fact, I think at the same presentation that Lee Min Yang presented at, Kizmekia Corbett of the NIH and NIAID working for Fauci also presented at.

32:49.569 --> 32:56.716
Lee Min Yang, well, she's just some outsider, innocent little student, just was so overwhelmed with concern.

32:58.356 --> 33:01.759
Because if you look at this platform, oh my goodness, who's after that?

33:02.039 --> 33:03.160
Janet Woodcock.

33:03.820 --> 33:04.841
Are you kidding me?

33:04.861 --> 33:08.444
Of course, again, it's a different event.

33:09.225 --> 33:12.087
But this is the people who this platform supports.

33:12.887 --> 33:14.128
Janet Woodcock again.

33:15.089 --> 33:17.671
Oh my goodness, Hugh Rosen of the Scripps Institute.

33:19.012 --> 33:21.694
Oh my goodness, Patrick Soon-Shiong.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.697
The guy who bought the Wimber Laboratory.

33:26.278 --> 33:27.659
Ha ha ha ha ha.

33:28.510 --> 33:33.055
The Wimber Laboratory that has something to do with what George Webb says is what Nazi art in mountains.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.339
Nothing to do with the high-speed link.

33:37.501 --> 33:41.465
Of course, the Internet2 organization was connected with Bob Gallo.

33:42.475 --> 34:00.124
between Walter Reed and Winbur that was set up by Robert Malone and his wife, Jill Glasper Malone, 2000-2001, which would have been really handy if Walter Reed was collecting a whole lot of cancer data or breast cancer data, and it would have been particularly valuable if cancer rates were expected to go up in the U.S.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.204
military because the U.S.

34:01.245 --> 34:07.548
military would have been, I don't know, maybe picked to take an experimental anthrax or smallpox vaccine.

34:08.248 --> 34:19.258
because of an unexpected major biological terrorism event in New York City in the fall of 2001, which I have like a stack of books all predicting.

34:21.360 --> 34:26.084
In other words, Li Menyang is just part of the show, everyone.

34:27.405 --> 34:28.466
Just part of the show.

34:29.741 --> 34:34.484
And the fact that this Chinese billionaire on the run, whatever, is the person that found her.

34:34.504 --> 34:42.449
And you know, I've researched him before, and he's also connected in with that super popular, like the Oprah Winfrey of China.

34:43.330 --> 34:46.612
I've talked about her before, and she also with the Columbia and so on.

34:47.092 --> 34:48.653
I have a whole series of shows on that.

34:48.813 --> 34:49.874
It's all fake.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.758
It's fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.

34:57.042 --> 34:58.743
The narrative is crumbling.

34:58.783 --> 35:03.307
The tree is tipping, and I'm ready to order a stump grinder at this point.

35:03.407 --> 35:05.169
This show is over, everyone.

35:05.429 --> 35:06.690
It was all fake.

35:09.953 --> 35:22.484
And I just can't help but think of how many more people would be alive today if people weren't lying about the gain-of-function virus, lying about it.

35:23.612 --> 35:26.914
causing a drug epidemic to go unresolved.

35:27.695 --> 35:33.539
Lying about the gain-of-function virus so that people continue to take injections they didn't need.

35:34.220 --> 35:36.021
Lying about the virus.

35:36.881 --> 35:41.224
So hospitals were getting away with murder with high-flow oxygen.

35:42.085 --> 35:42.665
Lying.

35:42.685 --> 35:47.989
Because Mechia Corbett, Li Menyang, fall, November 2018.

35:53.976 --> 36:04.963
Now, I'm not sure how to really summarize that any better than to say that there's Grampy.

36:05.183 --> 36:12.728
It really means something important about who these people are and what they've done to us and our families.

36:13.988 --> 36:17.611
It means something very, very important when we say charlatan.

36:18.536 --> 36:29.825
when we realize that likely Steve Bannon and Giuliani, who are in a photograph with her, with that Chinese billionaire in the background in a mirror,

36:31.385 --> 36:50.199
If we see this for what it is, there is a connected group of people behind the scenes that has orchestrated the shepherding of this narrative, the shepherding of these different disparate groups of Americans and made sure that they never came together on the narrative, made sure that

36:50.859 --> 37:14.717
the Scooby-Doo mystery that needed solving would drive a further wedge in between the American public and each other so that these communities would be severed even as they directed our attention to imaginary communities on the internet and imaginary illusions of consensus on the internet that included Steve Bannon and Lee Mignet.

37:16.161 --> 37:20.082
This is an extraordinary finding, great work by Mark.

37:20.142 --> 37:38.825
It's too bad that none of these other people that have suggested that it was China or suggested that it was bad guys that have released something on us, never really did any research to find out that Li Min Yan could have easily been coordinating with Tony Fauci and NIH and whoever else in the U.S.

37:38.885 --> 37:44.906
government wanted this to happen and wanted to blame it on China by coming on American media and blaming it on China.

37:45.306 --> 37:52.112
But none of them were ever able to look into her and find out who she was so that they could show that America is obviously to blame.

37:52.152 --> 37:53.713
And here's another puppet they used.

37:57.446 --> 38:25.209
And yes, I admit that I also wasn't able to do it, but it was the illusion of consensus created by all of these people who didn't ask any questions on their big podcasts, never asks any questions because they had to stay focused on VAERS, never asked any questions because they had to stay focused on the PCR details of the PCR space, never asked any questions about Li Min Yan because he knew already that she worked for them.

38:25.629 --> 38:26.230
It had to be.

38:27.366 --> 38:30.829
How can it be any other way with given Mark's seven minute video there?

38:33.811 --> 38:38.355
And how can we be here now when they were joking about having her give a testimony?

38:38.375 --> 38:40.637
Why wasn't she testifying right here?

38:41.077 --> 38:42.879
Did she risk life and limb for nothing?

38:44.120 --> 38:46.842
Did the Communist Party of China finally catch up to her?

38:46.882 --> 38:48.043
What happened to Li Min Yan?

38:51.172 --> 38:56.857
How come she didn't get a Congressional Medal of Honor or whatever it is they give foreigners when they do stuff for the United States?

38:56.897 --> 38:57.918
What's going on here?

38:59.239 --> 39:00.520
How did we forget about her?

39:00.620 --> 39:06.846
And when we look back to 2020 and find her and realize that, oh my gosh, she's not a whistleblower.

39:08.748 --> 39:15.554
She might even be the voice that called Paul Cuttrell from somewhere to say that Remdesivir was working over there.

39:17.745 --> 39:23.889
just like she might very well be the lady that we saw in the, in the Meadow Biota video.

39:23.929 --> 39:27.272
But if she's not the lady that we saw in the Meadow Biota video, what does it matter?

39:27.312 --> 39:31.935
Because she's the, she's definitely the lady that we just saw in Mark's video.

39:36.516 --> 39:44.463
This is collapsing now, and what I want to keep pushing on the tree in the right direction, I want to first have a little bit of fun here.

39:44.483 --> 39:53.892
I'm not going to put the sound on, but just realize what you're watching right now is me study hauling Joe, study hauling me, study haul myself, which is kind of a

39:54.873 --> 39:57.435
sixth wall or seventh wall kind of thing.

39:58.195 --> 40:13.385
And so we might be witnessing a sort of inception moment here with the crowdsource, CrowdStrike, whatever it's called, blue screening event, along with the fact that I am able to study haul, Joe's study hauling myself, study all myself, which is

40:14.305 --> 40:20.048
something that would never happen if it wasn't for the internet and how it's been weaponized against us.

40:20.488 --> 40:21.369
Shout out to Joe.

40:22.249 --> 40:28.392
He had a really good show that at the very, very end, he listens to a little bit of the review of the Gabe Mason interview.

40:28.932 --> 40:30.673
And so thanks a lot for that shout out, Joe.

40:31.494 --> 40:33.916
And that's the Liberty Perspective on Rumble.

40:34.516 --> 40:50.391
So I want to just start with the idea again and remind you that what these people have done is they have groomed our understanding over these years in a very rapid way with a very rapid application of these techniques.

40:51.280 --> 41:06.981
where groups of fake people are creating a lollapalooza of liars that it doesn't matter what stage you choose to listen to, the lab leak stage or the natural virus stage or the, I don't know, deattenuating

41:08.904 --> 41:16.615
virus stage or the flying aid stage whichever one you listen to in the end the presuppositions of the state are always reinforced by their music.

41:17.236 --> 41:22.644
Now I just want to go back in time a little while so that you can see how far we've come in the last

41:23.705 --> 41:31.309
10 to 15 years because it's way farther than most of us imagine because of the intense trauma that was the COVID panic.

41:32.369 --> 41:39.072
This is a former NIH head by the name of Bernadine Healy talking, I believe, in around 2008.

41:39.912 --> 41:44.855
It might be just a hair bit earlier or a hair bit after 2008.

41:44.895 --> 41:45.115
Oh, darn it.

41:55.928 --> 41:57.511
It's Joe Marshall is his name.

41:57.571 --> 42:00.756
Joe Marshall of the Liberty Perspective on Rumble.

42:01.397 --> 42:01.998
Sorry about that.

42:05.982 --> 42:10.104
Well, I think the 2020 vision is just where we should be going.

42:10.664 --> 42:19.409
I think it's concise, I think it's dramatic, and it'll save a lot of lives and improve quality of life for women and for men.

42:20.649 --> 42:24.531
You know, it really is quite thrilling to see this kind of continuity.

42:24.591 --> 42:30.514
So often in science we tend to look at study, one study and another study, and get confused about the two.

42:30.914 --> 42:34.556
Here, we're seeing an approach which is very integrated.

42:34.596 --> 42:52.843
It doesn't mean there aren't differences of opinions or interpretation, but it does dramatically mean that we have, through this incredible base of science, that it's continued to be based on the issue of men and women.

42:53.363 --> 42:58.584
And men have been brought into it, as inevitably they did the first 20 years, maybe were catch-up.

42:58.944 --> 43:08.127
We had to demonstrate that there were differences between men and women, and there were consequential differences that affect morbidity and mortality.

43:08.627 --> 43:09.527
That has been shown.

43:10.367 --> 43:13.048
We've seen how to save lives because of it.

43:13.448 --> 43:16.589
And now we move into the second phase, taking advantage of

43:17.049 --> 43:31.715
the interdisciplinary work, the multidisciplinary work, and moving out into issues like social determinants, the ecological so-called issues that really have never been addressed in any major clinical trial.

43:31.815 --> 43:36.757
So I think that women's health has led the way, not just for women's health,

43:37.617 --> 43:42.919
but also for all of medicine in terms of taking this holistic approach.

43:43.559 --> 43:48.942
I'll tell you, years ago, I used to use the word holistic, and people wrinkled their nose.

43:49.042 --> 43:50.642
It was kind of a new age.

43:51.083 --> 43:54.284
It was seen as sort of something new age to talk about holistic.

43:54.864 --> 43:59.686
Now I'm actually hearing from basic scientists that we have to look holistically.

43:59.746 --> 44:09.030
We have to integrate what goes on within the cell, what goes on within the organism, what goes on in the public health environment, in the social environment.

44:10.070 --> 44:15.253
And that is truly exciting to see this culture change.

44:15.853 --> 44:20.775
And you have to have a culture change if you're going to affect any lasting change.

44:22.423 --> 44:24.684
Now, why is that interesting to me?

44:24.744 --> 44:30.987
I want some people in the chat to... I don't know why this is continuing.

44:32.748 --> 44:33.368
Oh, it's just there.

44:34.089 --> 44:43.093
I want some people in the chat to hear, and you can rewind it later, to hear if that's actually a different set of enchantments.

44:43.273 --> 44:45.534
It's a different set of spells being cast.

44:45.574 --> 44:47.475
It's a different stage of the enchantment.

44:48.015 --> 44:50.877
And so it almost sounds like she's not really saying anything.

44:51.653 --> 44:59.135
the holistic approach and integrating across fields and interdisciplinary and men and women.

45:00.990 --> 45:04.573
And so the whole enchantment there was completely different.

45:05.274 --> 45:09.338
The spells that were being cast at that time were incredibly different.

45:09.378 --> 45:14.402
And if you can see how different they are, then you can see exactly what they're doing to us.

45:14.462 --> 45:21.188
Because this is not grassroots or spontaneous evolving of our understanding of ourselves.

45:21.609 --> 45:23.270
This is a forced move.

45:24.150 --> 45:32.176
by those people who have control over these conscious and intelligent manipulation of our organized habits and opinions of the masses.

45:32.236 --> 45:32.596
You see?

45:34.177 --> 45:35.118
That's what's happening.

45:35.518 --> 45:41.883
That's why if you look back and you see these people in the past and you listen to them in the past, they're casting different enchantments.

45:42.303 --> 45:45.185
And the enchantment that's being cast right now is extraordinary.

45:45.605 --> 45:49.909
Let's hear one more example of her talking about autism

45:50.709 --> 46:12.905
And I want you to hear how the enchantment that she casts is one about genetics and one about vulnerability and one about the diversity of our genetic backgrounds and our vulnerability to different things and how we definitely need to study the genetic diversity of humans if we're ever going to solve some of these big problems.

46:13.646 --> 46:16.428
Once you see it and hear it for the different

46:17.288 --> 46:27.275
very different enchantment than it is, you're gonna be ready to hear David Baltimore and his current sort of take on this enchantment.

46:40.184 --> 46:41.805
Sorry, I'm sending a message.

46:41.825 --> 46:45.728
There we go.

46:45.788 --> 46:45.988
Yes.

46:47.585 --> 46:48.306
I think it's playing.

46:48.766 --> 46:49.587
Maybe I paused it.

46:51.728 --> 46:52.689
Wait, I don't hear anything.

46:52.949 --> 46:54.831
Okay, I gotta escape for a second.

46:59.154 --> 46:59.674
Escape!

46:59.694 --> 47:00.555
There we go.

47:01.115 --> 47:02.636
I think it just got a little tired there.

47:02.697 --> 47:03.117
Let me see.

47:07.140 --> 47:08.121
Oh, I put the volume down.

47:08.361 --> 47:09.942
Wow, you're terrible at this.

47:10.743 --> 47:11.043
Here we go.

47:13.820 --> 47:38.138
This is the time when we do have the opportunity to understand whether or not there are susceptible children, perhaps genetically, perhaps they have a metabolic issue, mitochondrial disorder, immunological issue, that makes them more susceptible to vaccines, plural, or to one particular vaccine, or to a component of vaccine, like mercury.

47:38.638 --> 47:45.383
The fact that there is concern that you don't want to know that susceptible group is a real disappointment to me.

47:45.943 --> 47:48.305
If you know that susceptible group, you can save those children.

47:48.805 --> 47:55.290
The reason why they didn't want to look for those susceptibility groups was because they were afraid that if they found them,

47:56.030 --> 48:00.713
however big or small they were, that that would scare the public away.

48:00.853 --> 48:06.936
It sounds like you don't think the hypothesis of a link between vaccines and autism is completely irrational.

48:07.096 --> 48:09.498
So when I first heard about it, I thought, well, that doesn't make sense to me.

48:10.373 --> 48:27.425
The more you delve into it, if you look at the basic science, if you look at the research that's been done in animals, if you also look at some of these individual cases, and if you look at the evidence that there is no link, what I come away with is the question has not been answered.

48:28.775 --> 48:32.380
So I think it's very interesting what Girl Rocks says in the chat.

48:32.420 --> 48:35.024
I'm sure that Pamela would have been thinking the same thing.

48:35.084 --> 48:38.749
How is it that everyone would not be susceptible to mercury poisoning?

48:39.791 --> 48:44.197
How is it that everyone would not be susceptible to a dysregulation of your immune system?

48:45.680 --> 49:02.227
And so this is really the early stages of trying to, again, get people to ask the wrong questions so that the question that they ask isn't, are intramuscular injections of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system actually dumb?

49:03.067 --> 49:03.967
Is that possible?

49:04.807 --> 49:07.048
That's not a question that she wants to ask.

49:07.488 --> 49:20.410
Instead, the question we assume that they work great, just like Brett Weinstein assumes that they are just the greatest technology since airplane or the wheel, but maybe some people are vulnerable.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.611
Maybe there's a genetic predisposition.

49:23.011 --> 49:29.072
Maybe as Judy Mikovits said, there's a latent virus that gets activated by the vaccine and causes autism.

49:32.133 --> 49:42.192
This enchantment has been developing over many, many years since we were children and this enchantment was being cast in a much more mundane way on our parents.

49:46.365 --> 50:10.471
And so if I can remind you of any stream in particular to watch to try and think about how significant it is that understanding the history of these ideas and understanding who is responsible for crafting our collective understanding of these ideas, we can see why it is so suspicious that Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits are in front of us right now.

50:12.321 --> 50:16.286
And we can see why it's so suspicious that all of them have forgotten about Lee Minyan.

50:17.988 --> 50:23.134
It's suspicious why Pierre Cory was a witness for the George Floyd case.

50:23.555 --> 50:30.403
It's suspicious why Pierre Cory and Peter McCullough had to go all the way to Australia to testify in front of their parliament.

50:33.382 --> 50:55.079
It's suspiciously why Jessica Rose was able to tour the world and surf on three continents for four years for simply pushing a narrative about the spike protein and about VAERS, and has never really usefully questioned the childhood vaccine schedule in America, even though she works on CHD and gets her own show there.

50:58.422 --> 51:13.432
That's why CHD is about health freedom and about freedom of speech and about Merrill Nass' medical license and not about stopping the criminal vaccine schedule in America or returning strict liability to these products.

51:14.152 --> 51:28.182
That's why they never use those words, because they are part of this crafting of our understanding and curating of the narrative and making sure that we don't ask the questions that will immediately get us out of the trap.

51:31.323 --> 51:32.463
I'm David Baltimore.

51:32.563 --> 51:38.465
I'm the Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology.

51:38.865 --> 51:46.968
I was president of this wonderful school for nine years and so also carry the title President Emeritus.

51:50.700 --> 51:57.382
The idea that we might modify inheritance of an animal or human beings is an old idea.

51:58.602 --> 52:14.647
When genes were first discovered, we assumed that there would be methods developed for modifying specific genes, and in particular genes which have mutated away from optimum behavior.

52:17.428 --> 52:18.048
But we didn't know how.

52:20.220 --> 52:30.844
And as time has passed in the modern era, in the last, let's say, 50 years, ideas have popped up for how you might do this.

52:31.084 --> 52:37.547
But they were too sloppy to use in human beings.

52:38.507 --> 52:42.489
OK, so I just want to take you back again and make sure that you hear what I hear.

52:43.993 --> 52:53.078
The two phrases that I want you to hear him say again are, genes were first discovered and mutated away from optimal behavior.

52:53.298 --> 52:55.880
So if I just, I think I have this on, yeah.

52:56.360 --> 53:01.903
These two phrases in particular, genes were first discovered and mutated away from optimal behavior.

53:01.943 --> 53:10.008
The reason why I want you to listen to that is because those are the presuppositions of the narrative that this

53:11.243 --> 53:16.306
public health state would like you to accept, the Human Genome Project wants you to accept.

53:17.187 --> 53:24.712
That there are genes, we can find them, and once we find them, then we have the cause of things, the cause of behavior.

53:25.512 --> 53:26.753
The cause of behavior.

53:26.833 --> 53:30.815
If we change the genes of a mouse, we change the behavior of the mouse.

53:30.875 --> 53:34.558
Now, this is to a certain extent true.

53:36.383 --> 53:49.947
But we do not, we do not, we do not, we do not want to assume that that model is as high fidelity as what he wants you to hear.

53:50.908 --> 53:58.690
And then I'm going to give you a very brief metaphor that's just our analogy that's just come into my mind and hopefully it'll be okay.

53:59.311 --> 54:00.471
But if we found

54:01.892 --> 54:06.917
that when you take a screw out of a grand piano, that a certain note stops playing.

54:06.957 --> 54:12.141
And then we said, see, this screw is where the note is.

54:12.802 --> 54:15.584
And so if we change this screw, we can change the note.

54:16.045 --> 54:22.931
So we change the screw and the note changes.

54:26.533 --> 54:32.186
But did the note really change or did we, when we put the screw back in, we didn't tighten the cord enough?

54:32.266 --> 54:34.111
We didn't tighten the wire enough?

54:34.191 --> 54:35.574
We didn't set it up correctly?

54:35.614 --> 54:36.556
We didn't retune it?

54:39.315 --> 55:00.585
I know this isn't a perfect analogy, but what I want you to understand is that just because we can delete a sequence in ourselves or in our mouse, and then a certain thing, a certain function disappears, that doesn't mean, okay, now we understand that function and we understand the root cause of that function is this gene.

55:01.713 --> 55:11.990
any more than we understand how to build a piano if we unscrew a screw and now the middle C doesn't work and say, see, now we understand it.

55:12.090 --> 55:13.833
I know exactly how to fix this thing.

55:15.267 --> 55:29.293
And now again, please understand that's not an apt analogy to capture the irreducible complexity that is us or even a mouse when he's talking about genes were first discovered and mutated away from optimal behavior.

55:29.353 --> 55:37.376
These are already cartoon versions of what we might be able to make analogies about how genes work if

55:39.577 --> 55:46.379
The instructions on a pattern integrity are contained in the DNA of every one of your cells.

55:46.539 --> 55:59.783
If that's true, and I'm willing to accept it on a grand idea scale, if that's true, the way that that DNA becomes or encodes what it is that we are,

56:01.098 --> 56:04.281
is absolutely positively not understood at all.

56:04.441 --> 56:15.750
Not even in the most rudimentary sense other than, well, if we take all of this genetic material and put it over here and let it grow, it grows into the same thing that this would have grown into over here.

56:16.170 --> 56:18.852
That doesn't mean we understand it at all.

56:19.453 --> 56:26.358
And even if we can take little screws out of the piano and show that certain keys stop working, it still doesn't mean we understand

56:27.543 --> 56:31.347
Beethoven's music and what Beethoven hears when he plays a piano, you see?

56:32.448 --> 56:42.419
Even though we're actually trying to say that because we can make Beethoven unable to play middle C by unscrewing this screw, we now understand how Beethoven writes music.

56:43.558 --> 56:51.880
You see, that's where the irreducible complexity is completely vanishing from this, guys, because that's what reductionist biology does.

56:52.300 --> 57:08.284
It assumes that everything is a machine, everything is a bunch of chemicals, and if you put the right chemicals together, you get a firework, and if you put the right chemicals together, you get a firework that has little spouts like this, and if you put the right organic chemicals together, you get that little pattern integrity over there.

57:09.597 --> 57:17.139
And this is a gross oversimplification and an exaggeration of the fidelity of our understanding.

57:17.180 --> 57:23.842
And that is codified nicely in how he says, when genes were first discovered and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

57:23.862 --> 57:25.702
So let's listen to that again, okay?

57:26.062 --> 57:30.764
Because that's really important to try and get your head around as we listen to the rest of this one.

57:31.684 --> 57:33.745
Hope you don't feel like I'm wasting your time.

57:37.678 --> 57:50.226
you demon I must have taken something out there no I got it there something else is there I'm sorry I'm gonna see if I can get this oh I

57:53.115 --> 57:54.257
I'm David Baltimore.

57:54.357 --> 58:00.286
I'm the Millikan Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology.

58:00.687 --> 58:08.779
I was president of this wonderful school for nine years and so also carry the title President Emeritus.

58:12.512 --> 58:19.173
The idea that we might modify inheritance of an animal or human beings is an old idea.

58:20.393 --> 58:36.436
When genes were first discovered, we assumed that there would be methods developed for modifying specific genes, and in particular genes which have mutated away from optimum behavior.

58:39.217 --> 58:39.837
But we didn't know how.

58:42.710 --> 58:55.620
So how would we be able to tell, for example, whether a gene had mutated away from optimum behavior or the mechanisms by which that gene results in function has changed?

58:55.740 --> 59:03.286
In other words, how would we know whether the record was printed badly or whether the record player you're using is crap?

59:04.226 --> 59:06.168
The record player is set at the wrong speed.

59:07.679 --> 59:18.062
And so again, by saying that genes were discovered and genes do this, and then they mutate away from optimum behavior, he's still talking like the special cancer virus program.

59:18.102 --> 59:21.623
He's still talking about how nuclear weapons change the world.

59:23.543 --> 59:26.124
And now soon genetics is gonna change the world.

59:26.184 --> 59:28.585
He sounds like he's in the 50s and 60s again.

59:29.125 --> 59:33.406
And he's still talking about the idea that the way that this works is mutation.

59:35.475 --> 59:49.724
which is again a very limited, limited spectrum of debate that does not at all address how poorly that can encompass any of the irreducible complexity that would begin to, you know, better explain our world.

59:49.764 --> 59:50.404
Let's keep going.

59:51.545 --> 59:52.866
Hopefully that won't advance.

59:55.683 --> 01:00:04.970
As time has passed in the modern era, in the last, let's say 50 years, ideas have popped up for how you might do this.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.152
But they were too sloppy.

01:00:07.732 --> 01:00:08.973
It is a DNA helix.

01:00:09.353 --> 01:00:11.675
It is.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:13.857
This is the same room.

01:00:14.717 --> 01:00:16.659
And so that was just off the table.

01:00:16.759 --> 01:00:19.581
It's even got the same lamp still as the lyre in the video.

01:00:21.482 --> 01:00:23.304
About four or five years ago,

01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:31.856
People realized that there was in bacteria a kind of immune system.

01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:40.902
Bacteria use it to fight off viruses, because they, like us, are plagued by viruses.

01:00:41.823 --> 01:00:52.331
But this immune system worked entirely at a molecular level to characterize the genes of the invading virus.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:01:14.598
and to basically cut the genes of the invading virus at specific sites that distinguished the invading genes from the resident genes in the bacterium and allowed the bacterium to fight off attack by virus.

01:01:17.096 --> 01:01:27.738
But this ability to cut at a specific place was exactly what we needed if we were going to modify the genes of a

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:47.909
say a mouse, because the way that a mouse cell works, in fact most cells work, is that when there's been a cut through their DNA, the genes that control the behavior of the organism,

01:01:48.908 --> 01:01:51.471
They work very hard to repair it.

01:01:52.772 --> 01:02:00.181
And the cell repairs it actually, whether it can do it precisely or not.

01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:04.766
And so it makes little mistakes in the process of repairing it.

01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:07.369
And that can inactivate.

01:02:08.615 --> 01:02:10.557
the gene that was cut.

01:02:12.559 --> 01:02:17.784
And so we have now a very precise way of inactivating a gene.

01:02:18.265 --> 01:02:31.038
And it turns out that by another set of tricks, you can not only inactivate a gene, but you can modify the gene one place at a time, one spot at a time.

01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:36.441
And that's now what CRISPR-Cas9 is.

01:02:37.601 --> 01:02:47.465
So CRISPR is a name for the protective system that bacteria have.

01:02:48.026 --> 01:02:52.828
And I don't want to go into what it stands for because... He doesn't want to go into what it stands for.

01:02:52.888 --> 01:02:53.228
Why?

01:02:53.408 --> 01:02:56.770
And that is, first of all, this is a DNA double helix.

01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:59.111
Now, why doesn't he want to explain what CRISPR means?

01:02:59.191 --> 01:02:59.471
Say it.

01:03:00.051 --> 01:03:00.831
It's meaningless.

01:03:01.231 --> 01:03:02.031
It's meaningless.

01:03:02.151 --> 01:03:04.172
Okay, so let's see what CRISPR really means.

01:03:13.774 --> 01:03:15.094
CRISPR.

01:03:16.695 --> 01:03:17.975
CRISPR.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.215
Let's see what CRISPR means.

01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:27.897
Wikipedia says, clustered, regularly, interspaced, short palindromic repeats.

01:03:32.355 --> 01:03:36.838
clustered regularly, interspaced, short palindromic repeats.

01:03:39.619 --> 01:03:48.344
And it delivers the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic RNA guide into the cell to be cut at a desired location.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:57.410
So CRISPR in the viruses is supposedly something that helps the virus as an immune system, he said.

01:03:58.322 --> 01:04:13.191
But in reality, what CRISPR does is it cuts that specific, clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats, and then moves those sequences from the phage genome to the bacterial genome.

01:04:14.772 --> 01:04:23.097
And so what he is describing as fending off attack and the immune system of the bacteria remembering

01:04:24.045 --> 01:04:37.053
the phage so that it can fight it off is actually, I think, probably equally well described by saying that phages are a way of sharing genetic information between bacteria.

01:04:37.133 --> 01:04:40.935
And the way that the bacteria incorporate that is that there are

01:04:42.259 --> 01:04:52.234
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats that are used interspaced between that useful genetic information that is being shared between bacteria.

01:04:52.775 --> 01:04:56.120
And that's why they cut there and then copy the stuff in the middle.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:05.684
Now they have taken that little machine and they have used it in combination with Cas9 to do RNA-directed cutting.

01:05:06.064 --> 01:05:12.828
And it may be that after some modifications and some tweaking, they are able to, to a limited extent, do that.

01:05:14.141 --> 01:05:36.879
But what you heard there was a very disingenuous representation of what bacteriophages might be, or are, or should be considered, and a very, very, very succinct description of them as pathogens of bacteria that need to be fought off by a sort of immune system of bacteria called CRISPR-Cas9.

01:05:40.669 --> 01:05:54.021
and no different than what Joshua Lederberg and Dr. Wolf were doing in that 1994 article by trying to get us not to think about genetic engineering, but about gene therapy.

01:05:55.062 --> 01:06:04.410
Here we have a wonderful, wonderful example of David Baltimore making sure to curate the narrative around viruses and the Baltimore scheme.

01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:10.463
so that we never ask useful questions about what CRISPR-Cas9 is or it isn't.

01:06:11.063 --> 01:06:18.886
And we make sure that we think of bacteriophages as pathogens rather than a natural signaling mechanism of bacteria.

01:06:18.966 --> 01:06:32.431
Essentially part of the pattern integrity that is bacteria in the same way that exosomes might very well be a part of the natural pattern integrity that is ourselves, our immune systems and our healthy and

01:06:34.973 --> 01:06:56.632
whatever tissue I mean think about this carefully try to absorb what he's saying here and realize that he is kind of descendant of the same mentor chain that that Bernadine Healy is and yet if we just look back a decade ago the rhetoric and the enchantment is so very different

01:07:06.698 --> 01:07:17.901
But it involves an RNA molecule, a genetic molecule, that specifies the precise spot.

01:07:18.761 --> 01:07:23.782
And Cas9 is a protein that can cut the DNA.

01:07:24.442 --> 01:07:32.704
And so CRISPR directs the system to a specific spot, then it's cut in that specific spot.

01:07:33.103 --> 01:07:36.704
prepared there and either modified or inactivated.

01:07:38.825 --> 01:07:41.345
The science is advancing very rapidly.

01:07:42.265 --> 01:07:45.486
New ways of editing are coming up.

01:07:46.026 --> 01:07:47.147
Exponential, of course.

01:07:47.947 --> 01:07:50.047
Are cleaner, more effective.

01:07:53.748 --> 01:08:02.540
and new ways of using the technology are being invented continually.

01:08:03.341 --> 01:08:08.569
So it will just get more and more powerful over time.

01:08:09.864 --> 01:08:16.686
we're going to see, I think, some pressure to use that technology in people.

01:08:17.906 --> 01:08:30.550
And where the medical need is great, I think we'll find situations in which the benefit-risk ratio is very much in favor of the benefit.

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:37.832
And at that point, I think there's a moral argument to be made that we have to do that.

01:08:39.389 --> 01:08:42.751
because we can improve the lives of people.

01:08:46.613 --> 01:08:49.234
There are two kinds of challenges.

01:08:50.074 --> 01:08:50.955
So that's interesting.

01:08:50.995 --> 01:09:04.502
What if we had a transmissible, a self-replicating RNA that could alter lots of people at once and we could, I don't know, aerosolize it and distribute it and it would help people?

01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:07.183
I guess we would be under the moral obligation to do it then.

01:09:09.491 --> 01:09:25.505
If we thought it would help people, if we had a 99.999% chance that it was going to work just fine to release a gene drive that would change humans' genetics permanently, I guess we should do it then, according to David Baltimore.

01:09:26.846 --> 01:09:29.248
Just a lowly virologist, you know, nobody big.

01:09:29.528 --> 01:09:30.589
He's not influential.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:33.372
He doesn't have any, any, any say in this stuff.

01:09:33.392 --> 01:09:34.553
He's just an average guy.

01:09:37.782 --> 01:09:39.623
in using the technology.

01:09:40.603 --> 01:09:52.989
One is an off target that we have to do that because we can improve the lives of people.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:10:00.572
There are two kinds of challenges in using the technology.

01:10:01.532 --> 01:10:01.952
One is

01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:28.248
an off-target effect where you want to modify a gene at a certain position and you inadvertently cause a change somewhere else in the genome, needn't even be at all nearby to where you plan to cause an alteration.

01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:38.237
You have to be very careful of that because we're now talking about mutations that will be passed on to later generations.

01:10:38.938 --> 01:10:45.808
And so you don't want any adventitious errors created in the genome.

01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:50.974
Now there are little errors created all the time in our genomes.

01:10:51.634 --> 01:11:03.883
You compare the genomes of two identical twins and they do differ because there are events like this occurring all the time.

01:11:04.123 --> 01:11:11.689
So it's an interesting admission if the genomes of identical twins are not the same anymore when they're adults.

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:16.266
and that the manifestation of them is different, even metabolically.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:26.769
If we can see differences there, then that seems to indicate that genes aren't just genes and that genes don't just determine the behavior until they mutate away from optimum.

01:11:27.949 --> 01:11:41.173
That it's a different kind of emergent property or emergent properties or several layers of emergent properties that are horribly, horribly simplified by talking about genes and their discovery.

01:11:42.267 --> 01:11:52.154
And yet this guy is fine with that because that's the extent to which they want us to understand their limited, very, very limited grasp of our biology.

01:11:52.534 --> 01:11:54.696
I want to increase the frequency of those.

01:11:55.676 --> 01:11:57.498
So that's one.

01:11:57.698 --> 01:11:59.399
The other problem

01:12:00.718 --> 01:12:14.901
is that if the edit is done as the cells are dividing in the embryo, you could have a situation in which the embryo becomes what we call a mosaic.

01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:20.222
Some of its cells are edited, some of its cells are not edited.

01:12:21.803 --> 01:12:22.583
At that point,

01:12:24.955 --> 01:12:29.776
You haven't, you've created a problem and you haven't solved the problem you wanted to solve.

01:12:30.636 --> 01:12:36.197
Because there are still cells in there that can pass the mutation on to the next generation.

01:12:37.178 --> 01:12:45.159
And there are cells that are, have been edited and are like cells in other people.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.480
So we've got to figure out how to avoid mosaicism.

01:12:50.201 --> 01:12:52.221
And that actually is not easy.

01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:54.744
And I don't.

01:12:55.324 --> 01:12:59.265
And so he's actually talking about methodological problems.

01:12:59.405 --> 01:13:08.488
That's the two things that are standing in the way of there being no ethical reason not to modify humans, even if they don't want it.

01:13:09.028 --> 01:13:10.948
We'll be under a moral obligation to do it.

01:13:10.968 --> 01:13:11.829
What are the problems?

01:13:12.449 --> 01:13:14.409
One of the problems is off-target effects.

01:13:14.449 --> 01:13:15.710
That we can probably solve.

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:17.710
The other one is mosaicism.

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:19.050
And what did he say?

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:21.071
When you modify a zygote,

01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:33.617
and some of the cells change and some of them don't, you could have a mosaic organism with cells that have a different genetic background than other cells.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:35.238
Some will be altered, some won't.

01:13:35.699 --> 01:13:46.449
So the two things we have to solve are how to modify all the cells in a zygote, and number two, how to get rid of off-target effects.

01:13:47.455 --> 01:13:58.260
And so there's no discussion of ethics at all, no discussion about our limited understanding of these things, no discussion of the irreducible complexity.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:12.566
Instead, a very brass tacks discussion about the landmarks we need to get to before Ray Kurzweiler can upload his brain into the ether forever and avoid all future diseases and live for eternity.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:29.298
We just have to get these off-target effects done and figure out how to adequately transfect or transform a zygote, which in case you don't know what that is, it's a multicellular blob of cells before they become like a real embryo with a shape.

01:14:29.318 --> 01:14:34.100
I think it's a problem that has been solved yet.

01:14:36.381 --> 01:14:38.322
I think people who work with this technology

01:14:40.567 --> 01:14:50.437
As the cells are dividing in the embryo, you could have a situation in which the embryo becomes what we call a mosaic.

01:14:51.318 --> 01:14:55.762
Some of its cells are edited, some of its cells are not edited.

01:14:57.364 --> 01:14:58.125
At that point,

01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:05.322
you haven't, you've created a problem and you haven't solved the problem you wanted to solve.

01:15:06.182 --> 01:15:11.723
Because there are still cells in there that can pass the mutation on to the next generation.

01:15:12.704 --> 01:15:20.705
And there are cells that are, have been edited and are like cells in other people.

01:15:21.446 --> 01:15:25.026
So we've got to figure out how to avoid mosaicism.

01:15:25.727 --> 01:15:27.767
And that actually is not easy.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:34.459
And I don't think it's a problem that has been solved yet.

01:15:36.774 --> 01:15:53.462
I think people who work with this technology are reasonably comfortable that off-target effects can be assayed and minimized, brought down to the level of spontaneous alterations.

01:15:54.863 --> 01:15:55.983
He's being very careful.

01:15:56.003 --> 01:16:01.786
There's real questions about whether we know how to handle the mosaicism.

01:16:03.228 --> 01:16:10.453
And if we don't find a way to handle the mosaicism, then we may have to look at a very different kind of technology.

01:16:11.774 --> 01:16:12.715
I wonder what that would be.

01:16:12.855 --> 01:16:17.158
There are really two classes of problem with germline modification.

01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:19.720
One is the mechanics of it.

01:16:20.461 --> 01:16:21.121
That's what he just said.

01:16:21.161 --> 01:16:23.163
Do we have it working precisely?

01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:27.146
Have we solved the problems of mosaicism?

01:16:28.747 --> 01:16:31.829
Can we do it with precision and safety?

01:16:33.612 --> 01:16:38.473
But then you have to ask the question, do we want to do it at all in human beings?

01:16:39.993 --> 01:16:44.154
And that's an almost religious question.

01:16:45.575 --> 01:17:00.378
Because if you treat human beings as inviolable, as being given to the Earth by higher forces,

01:17:02.657 --> 01:17:09.120
and believe that humans are perfect, then you don't want to modify them.

01:17:10.761 --> 01:17:25.187
Even if they're not healthy, or even if their lives could be better, at least from my point of view, there are people who believe that nothing like that should be done.

01:17:26.587 --> 01:17:36.270
So those are people who would say there should never be gene modification, gene editing, no matter how good it looks.

01:17:39.271 --> 01:17:51.874
And then there are, I think, lots of other people, a majority of people, who believe that if there is a way to make the lives of people better, we should do it.

01:17:53.723 --> 01:17:54.303
those people.

01:17:54.423 --> 01:17:57.465
And that's really, unfortunately, complete bullshit.

01:17:57.525 --> 01:18:06.190
Because if these people wanted to make our lives better, they would start by protecting our environment, stop polluting our environment, stop, stop

01:18:08.186 --> 01:18:09.507
raping our waterways.

01:18:09.587 --> 01:18:13.829
They would stop polluting us with their processed food.

01:18:14.329 --> 01:18:17.990
They would encourage small farmers to grow organically.

01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:20.131
They would encourage everyone to have a garden.

01:18:20.191 --> 01:18:25.874
They would encourage school lunch programs to go back to the way they were when I was a kid.

01:18:26.414 --> 01:18:36.443
They would be doing all kinds of things that are very low-hanging fruit to make our lives better if making our lives better was exactly what they wanted to do.

01:18:37.003 --> 01:18:47.152
These lying pieces of shit saying that they want to make our lives better because their genetic technology is, you know, expensive, but we don't want to keep it all for ourselves.

01:18:47.532 --> 01:18:49.474
We want even the poor people to have it.

01:18:50.254 --> 01:18:50.975
Stop lying!

01:18:51.796 --> 01:18:52.796
It is gross.

01:18:53.217 --> 01:18:54.218
It is gross!

01:19:01.224 --> 01:19:07.087
Now I have to make another distinction with germline modification.

01:19:07.927 --> 01:19:09.668
One is the mechanics of it.

01:19:10.929 --> 01:19:13.110
Do we have it working precisely?

01:19:14.971 --> 01:19:17.112
Have we solved the problems of mosaicism?

01:19:18.693 --> 01:19:21.834
Can we do it with precision and safety?

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:28.418
But then you have to ask the question, do we want to do it at all in human beings?

01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:34.086
And that's an almost religious question.

01:19:34.326 --> 01:19:34.786
Almost.

01:19:35.527 --> 01:19:59.058
Because if you treat human beings as inviolable, as being given to the earth by higher forces, and believe that humans are perfect, then you don't want to modify them.

01:20:00.706 --> 01:20:04.227
Even if they're... Believing humans is perfect is not what we believe.

01:20:04.287 --> 01:20:16.049
We believe biology of animals and plants and bacteria and us are all one continuum for which we have very little real grasp on.

01:20:18.969 --> 01:20:28.591
Other than it is a web of pattern integrities that we best not mess with and that there is an enormous amount of irreducible complexity that underpins it.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.638
That is very different than saying we come from somewhere, blah, blah, blah.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:43.924
And that's the level of sophistication that I think we need to get our high school biology kids at.

01:20:44.525 --> 01:20:54.710
Our matriculating freshmen in college need to understand biology in a sophisticated enough way so that when they hear this guy, they think, well, what a bunch of bullshit is that?

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:58.752
I don't just believe it's all fairies and smoke.

01:21:02.344 --> 01:21:08.726
I understand that there are just an enormous amount of things that we're not gonna understand about our own biology.

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:30.551
And I understand, and I want all these children to understand that the toxins in our environment, the shitty food that they make us eat, the way that we don't exercise, the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, the habits that we form in our children are all far more destructive than the Baltimore scheme of viruses and what we have to face with regards to dangers from them.

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:47.160
And the idea that these people want to misconstrue the public good of genetic modification with the public good of just giving us clean water, fresh air, and good food to eat is ridiculous.

01:21:49.761 --> 01:21:50.361
Not healthy.

01:21:50.942 --> 01:22:02.266
Or even if their lives could be better, at least from my point of view, there are people who believe that nothing like that should be done.

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:13.335
So those are people who would say there should never be gene modification, gene editing, no matter how good it looks.

01:22:16.336 --> 01:22:28.959
And then there are, I think, lots of other people, a majority of people, who believe that if there is a way to make the lives of people better, we should do it.

01:22:30.791 --> 01:22:36.515
Those people now have to make another distinction.

01:22:38.237 --> 01:22:49.665
That distinction is between a modification that is only in your own body and a modification which is inherited by your offspring.

01:22:52.207 --> 01:22:54.189
And that that's a fundamental difference.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:23:09.420
not because of the mechanics of it, but because of the moral status of the individual.

01:23:11.431 --> 01:23:19.455
And that in some way, by modifying the genes, you've modified the essence of the individual.

01:23:19.775 --> 01:23:21.836
Now that's an interesting point for him to make.

01:23:21.876 --> 01:23:28.140
In other words, if I want to modify myself as a 53-year-old man to make myself into a superhero X-Man, that's fine.

01:23:29.008 --> 01:23:35.173
But if I modify myself in a way that modifies future generations that come after me, that's a very different thing.

01:23:35.253 --> 01:23:57.532
Now, that doesn't even acknowledge the fact that we don't really understand the mechanisms of inheritance to the extent to which we can say safely that if we modify somebody and that modification includes their gametes, that that modification will have no ramifications on their offspring or the reproductive process that leads to healthy offspring.

01:23:58.308 --> 01:23:59.950
We wouldn't know that until it failed.

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:03.353
We wouldn't know that until it careened out of control, right?

01:24:03.433 --> 01:24:09.219
I mean, you wouldn't know if making somebody super smart could also make their...

01:24:11.693 --> 01:24:13.814
their wives have like triplets all the time.

01:24:13.854 --> 01:24:28.524
You wouldn't know that until you actually went through the replication process and realized that, oh my gosh, now the modification of his math ability has inadvertently led to large litters of miniature children.

01:24:28.584 --> 01:24:29.424
How would you know that?

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:30.285
You wouldn't know that.

01:24:30.325 --> 01:24:35.108
And you can make all the conjecture you want about how we know it won't happen because we've done it.

01:24:35.128 --> 01:24:35.508
We don't know that.

01:24:38.396 --> 01:24:50.119
And so it's interesting that he brings up the idea that modifying an adult or modifying an individual is very different than modifying a germline and all the offspring that come down from that.

01:24:51.462 --> 01:25:03.225
So he's kind of hinting at gene drives here, which is a cool technology that nobody ever talks about that's far more dangerous and is the real gain of function that we should be afraid of.

01:25:03.305 --> 01:25:12.208
Nothing to do with viruses, but just to do with molecular tools being created by people who have no idea what these molecular tools might do to a

01:25:12.808 --> 01:25:18.791
you know, a continuum of pattern integrities that has been developing over thousands, if not millions of years.

01:25:18.811 --> 01:25:24.794
And we're just going to, you know, mess around with that molecular pattern integrity over millions of years by just tweaking some stuff.

01:25:24.834 --> 01:25:26.915
Because, you know, gene drives are cool.

01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:36.439
And again, there are people on both sides of that question.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.521
And I think it'll come down

01:25:41.089 --> 01:25:53.542
to how well can you do it and what kinds of modifications can be made that would improve the health and well-being of people.

01:25:56.865 --> 01:25:59.148
But we're going to debate those questions.

01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:04.180
over the next years and decades.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:12.041
And there are always gonna be people on both sides of the issue.

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.102
So we're gonna have to decide to go one way or another.

01:26:18.082 --> 01:26:28.284
I think it's pretty clear where I would go, but I don't have any more important status than anybody else in this discussion.

01:26:29.595 --> 01:26:37.727
And so it really will come down to what the majority of people think is the right way to behave.

01:26:39.673 --> 01:26:46.217
The social problems are not solved by genetic tricks.

01:26:47.897 --> 01:26:51.660
They're endemic to the culture of our society.

01:26:54.401 --> 01:26:54.781
Endemic?

01:26:54.801 --> 01:27:02.786
In fact, the general worry is that if we develop the ability to... What did he describe as endemic?

01:27:03.906 --> 01:27:09.790
have any more important status than anybody else in this discussion.

01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:11.612
He doesn't have any more important status.

01:27:11.632 --> 01:27:16.335
It really will come down the next years and decades.

01:27:17.816 --> 01:27:24.181
And there are always going to be people on both sides of the issue.

01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:27.263
So we're going to have to decide to go one way or another.

01:27:30.239 --> 01:27:40.461
I think it's pretty clear where I would go, but I don't have any more important status than anybody else in this discussion.

01:27:41.741 --> 01:27:55.424
And so it really will come down to what the— Except his whole status in this discussion is determined by the fact that he defines virology.

01:27:56.226 --> 01:27:57.847
He defines the AIDS virus.

01:27:58.047 --> 01:27:59.968
He defines retroviruses.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.289
He defines virology.

01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:16.816
Without him around to say, yes, that's the way it is, without TWIV around to say, yes, that's the way it is, we would be more capable of reinvestigating virology and its purported fidelity.

01:28:17.496 --> 01:28:25.240
And whether it was an exaggeration or not, that RNA can indeed pandemic if you add the right fear and cleavage sites or HIV inserts.

01:28:27.418 --> 01:28:29.119
because that is what he protects.

01:28:29.159 --> 01:28:51.699
He might not have any special say in whether we genetically modify our children or not because I'm not a special guy, but he is a special guy because the reason why we are where we are right now, where transfection and transformation are being rolled out in mass as methodologies of medicine,

01:28:52.757 --> 01:29:10.429
under the guise of countermeasures that worked but didn't work, but were rushed and will work better next time, that fit the category of new kinds of vaccines that people like Li Min Yan were arguing for in 2018 at conferences where other NIH theater members were presenting.

01:29:12.951 --> 01:29:18.415
Understand, ladies and gentlemen, that this illusion is breaking fast like a bubble pops.

01:29:21.564 --> 01:29:23.345
Don't get soap in your eyes and miss it.

01:29:25.867 --> 01:29:30.029
The majority of people think this is the right way to behave.

01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:38.474
The social problems are not solved by genetic tricks.

01:29:40.135 --> 01:29:43.857
They're endemic to the culture of our society.

01:29:46.952 --> 01:30:02.982
In fact, the general worry is that if we develop the ability to modify the germline, that only wealthy people will be able to take advantage of that.

01:30:03.822 --> 01:30:14.308
And so it may exacerbate the difference between the opportunities available to the wealthy and to the impoverished.

01:30:16.209 --> 01:30:24.094
And that's something that we're very aware of and really attends all medical advances.

01:30:26.796 --> 01:30:29.617
and is not specific to this advancement.

01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:40.064
Because this is happening with the light of publicity, it is a problem that people are talking about and that we have to think about.

01:30:43.086 --> 01:30:50.571
I believe that it's a good thing for science to be done in a transparent way

01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:58.715
that is available to and understood by the general public.

01:30:59.956 --> 01:31:10.723
Now, at a certain level, there are very few people who can fully understand the implications of new scientific advances.

01:31:12.204 --> 01:31:14.905
But everybody can get an idea of what's going on.

01:31:15.706 --> 01:31:20.949
And I think we have to reach out from the scientific community to the general public to

01:31:21.633 --> 01:31:25.896
so that there is an increased understanding of what's going on.

01:31:26.516 --> 01:31:28.557
So they can exercise informed consent.

01:31:28.597 --> 01:31:41.265
The publicity that surrounded this basically irresponsible act has a plus side which is it's introduced

01:31:42.642 --> 01:31:43.823
the general community.

01:31:44.143 --> 01:31:45.904
He called it an irresponsible act.

01:31:46.564 --> 01:31:49.666
To what's actually going on in modern science.

01:31:49.746 --> 01:32:02.854
And it takes some very dramatic situation for people to pay attention long enough to understand what's what's happening.

01:32:05.596 --> 01:32:10.338
And so this is a teaching moment, and that's good.

01:32:11.419 --> 01:32:11.879
That's good.

01:32:11.899 --> 01:32:15.341
That will spread the understanding.

01:32:15.361 --> 01:32:16.361
It sure is a teaching moment.

01:32:16.641 --> 01:32:28.967
Of what's going on, and it makes the lives of scientists a little more difficult, because we now have to answer to a much wider range of people than ordinarily we pay any attention to us.

01:32:30.656 --> 01:32:41.369
It takes some very dramatic situation for people to pay attention long enough to understand what's happening.

01:32:44.132 --> 01:32:47.135
And so this is a teaching moment.

01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:48.837
And that's good.

01:32:49.938 --> 01:32:50.359
That's good.

01:32:52.589 --> 01:32:56.090
spread the understanding of what's going on in it.

01:32:56.550 --> 01:33:07.473
It makes the lives of scientists a little more difficult because we now have to answer to a much wider range of people than ordinarily we pay any attention to us.

01:33:09.093 --> 01:33:09.833
But that's not bad.

01:33:15.811 --> 01:33:38.271
So the illusion is that from bat caves or from laboratories, a virus could spread around the world and cause a calamity that would require us to advance our methodologies of transfection and transformation as fast as possible in order to counteract the now understood to be laboratory leaked virus.

01:33:39.338 --> 01:33:47.383
This New World Order is an illusion, it's a mythology, and it's based on this idea, that the mystery virus has caused all these excess deaths.

01:33:47.824 --> 01:33:56.149
And the only way they were able to show this to you was because they didn't show you it in the context of all-cause mortality, they just showed it to you as starting from zero.

01:33:56.649 --> 01:34:02.293
These people showed it to you starting from zero, and also these people showed it to you starting from zero.

01:34:02.653 --> 01:34:08.617
And they all went along with it, just like Lee Min Yan and Steve Bannon went along with it.

01:34:09.037 --> 01:34:15.761
all went along with the same story that the mystery virus is causing these excess deaths and it's not true.

01:34:16.501 --> 01:34:21.364
It's not true because fear, uncertainty, doubt, and confusion killed a lot of people.

01:34:21.404 --> 01:34:27.487
It's not true because do not resuscitate orders were given very early in the pandemic because you didn't want to spread anything.

01:34:27.947 --> 01:34:32.110
Pulse oximeters and supplementary oxygen were used to toxic levels.

01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:41.400
that got people to get on ventilators, that got people to not use antibiotics because, you know, antibiotics don't work for a viral pneumonia.

01:34:43.463 --> 01:34:50.571
And so once we stopped treating viral or bacterial pneumonia the way we used to treat it, the deaths from pneumonia skyrocketed.

01:34:53.148 --> 01:35:09.603
poor use of steroids to navigate these things included what Robert Malone described as dexamethasone as an immune system hammer so that they could get people out of the hospital and send them back to care homes where they would die of secondary pneumonia without really knowing it because again,

01:35:10.885 --> 01:35:13.667
dexamethasone is like a hammer for the immune system.

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:24.515
And then we were told stories about midazolam and about euthanasia in the UK and about remdesivir, but we were never told stories about oxygen toxicity leading to ventilation.

01:35:25.816 --> 01:35:32.561
We were never told stories about murder in hospitals in America, just euthanasia in the UK.

01:35:33.342 --> 01:35:36.264
But those people were gonna die of COVID anyway, right?

01:35:37.981 --> 01:35:42.485
The opioid deaths completely ignored, even though they are a giant deal.

01:35:43.807 --> 01:35:47.330
Because opioid deaths are not the same as heroin.

01:35:48.932 --> 01:35:50.854
Because heroin is made by farmers.

01:35:51.494 --> 01:35:53.176
Heroin is made by poor people.

01:35:54.377 --> 01:35:56.679
Just like cocaine is made by poor people.

01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.404
Fentanyl, car fentanyl, are made by pharmaceutical companies.

01:36:05.069 --> 01:36:08.792
Death certificate frauds were used to create the illusion of the pandemic.

01:36:09.372 --> 01:36:13.455
Financial incentives were used to create the illusion of the pandemic.

01:36:13.615 --> 01:36:21.160
Track and trace companies, masks, closures, mandates were used to create the illusion of the pandemic.

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:31.967
PCR fraud, lateral flow testing fraud, and likely sequencing fraud, all combined to create the illusion of something that was just murder and lies.

01:36:35.438 --> 01:36:38.040
And those murder and lies are not supported.

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:47.388
I mean, the murder and lies that they told are not, their stories are not supported by epidemiological evidence of spread anywhere in the world.

01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:55.235
And conveniently in America, projected Medicare costs in the coming years were greatly avoided.

01:36:56.778 --> 01:37:05.389
by the deletion of our old people that were going to be a weight on the system to the tune of $500,000 for every person in their last six months.

01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:12.277
This was an ongoing, oncoming crisis that was already projected in the late 90s, early 2000s.

01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:24.115
And yet nobody, not CHD, not Aaron Seery, nobody is talking about strict liability for all pharmaceutical products, including vaccines.

01:37:24.575 --> 01:37:38.884
Nobody's talking about how the CICP and the VICP and the PrEP Act and all these other laws actually combine to create a Seventh Amendment violation where you can't sue for damages anymore.

01:37:40.148 --> 01:37:43.311
You could call that jurisdiction stripping if you wanted to.

01:37:43.351 --> 01:37:49.376
And that idea has got a whole history in American legal system that nobody talks about.

01:37:49.456 --> 01:37:55.962
No one, none of these hero lawyers at CHD, none of these hero lawyers at ICANN, none of these hero lawyers anywhere.

01:37:56.442 --> 01:38:02.608
None of them are talking about using the term strict liability, using the term jurisdiction stripping.

01:38:03.228 --> 01:38:05.871
because they are not trying to save us.

01:38:05.971 --> 01:38:07.312
They are working against us.

01:38:07.752 --> 01:38:15.600
They are part of exactly the same illusion that is now convincing everyone around the world that transfection in healthy humans worked, but it was rushed.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.662
And so some of this contamination may have hurt people.

01:38:19.403 --> 01:38:23.905
But free-range RNA can definitely cause a pandemic because that's still going on now.

01:38:24.005 --> 01:38:25.145
COVID is still real.

01:38:25.665 --> 01:38:34.649
The Olympics and the Tour de France and these swimmers from Australia all wearing masks because it's still going on right now.

01:38:36.314 --> 01:38:38.656
And the real truth is, is that it's murder and lies.

01:38:38.736 --> 01:38:43.179
The transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and they knew that.

01:38:43.219 --> 01:38:49.963
That's why they had to lie about it, make it a crisis, use the PrEP Act, declare an emergency because RNA cannot pandemic.

01:38:50.383 --> 01:39:04.473
That's the same reason why somebody like Li Min Yan, who was intimately related to these people on a professional level before the pandemic, suddenly was a whistleblower that came and went as fast as the year 2020 that none of these people want to talk about.

01:39:06.411 --> 01:39:29.419
Because in 2020, we were fooled into solving a mystery of a novel virus, a mystery of a gain-of-function virus, a mystery of a gain-of-function spike protein that might be damaging our immune system, might be causing cardiac arrest, might be causing clotting, might be damaging our mitochondria, might be causing amyloid, might be causing prion disease, might be doing all of these things because it's got fear and cleavage sites and HIV inserts.

01:39:29.479 --> 01:39:31.080
And this is all a lie.

01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:50.724
It's all a lie that was told not just by these people, ladies and gentlemen, but also by these people and their people, their clown shows that they put out there that still can't talk about this, can't summarize this at all.

01:39:51.425 --> 01:39:52.646
It's just a bioweapon.

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:54.467
It's just an incapacitating agent.

01:39:54.527 --> 01:39:55.828
It's just the spike protein.

01:39:55.868 --> 01:39:57.109
It's just amyloidosis.

01:39:59.022 --> 01:40:00.944
Biology is the way out, ladies and gentlemen.

01:40:01.004 --> 01:40:08.290
Pause all childhood vaccinations in the United States of America because the vaccination schedule in America is criminal.

01:40:08.771 --> 01:40:12.854
Demand strict liability for all pharmaceutical products and this problem goes away.

01:40:13.274 --> 01:40:18.879
Investigate the intentional murder of Americans in 2020 onward to convince the world of a pandemic.

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.382
Reclaim sovereignty over your body and that of your children.

01:40:23.371 --> 01:40:28.375
and the CDC withdraw from the WHO and the UN entirely.

01:40:28.916 --> 01:40:34.580
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:40:35.061 --> 01:40:41.106
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

01:40:41.326 --> 01:40:44.248
I think that's the show for the C this afternoon.

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.811
There may very well be another show today.

01:40:49.264 --> 01:40:54.487
because I'm feeling it and because I found a podcast that I wanted to listen to.

01:40:55.088 --> 01:40:57.389
So I may do another stream.

01:40:57.449 --> 01:40:58.970
I don't think I have anything after that.

01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.590
No, I don't.

01:40:59.610 --> 01:41:01.692
So I'm going to go back to it.

01:41:03.333 --> 01:41:05.454
And you're running slow again, you demon.

01:41:09.116 --> 01:41:10.557
Here we go.

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:11.077
Cut.

01:41:13.004 --> 01:41:14.946
Thank you very much for joining me, ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:14.966 --> 01:41:22.252

and gigahomebiological.com if you want to find a way to support this little stream.

01:41:35.383 --> 01:41:36.844
It would be very much appreciated.

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:42.949
If you know anything about the ongoing cyber problem, send me an email, let me know what's up.

01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:52.836
Otherwise, I'll either see you later today or definitely tomorrow for a very long study hall on an audio-only podcast.

01:41:53.717 --> 01:41:57.540
I'm going to try out a new set of things.

01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.240
I'm going to try

01:41:59.361 --> 01:42:00.181
this thing out.

01:42:01.082 --> 01:42:06.424
We'll use this thing to kind of represent the podcast and then we'll take notes and we'll see what happens.

01:42:07.424 --> 01:42:08.665
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:42:08.685 --> 01:42:10.866
I look forward to seeing you again.

01:42:10.886 --> 01:42:12.366
I don't know if it'll be this afternoon.

01:42:12.446 --> 01:42:12.927
It's sunny.

01:42:12.987 --> 01:42:19.489
I should get to the basketball court again or my sons are going to come back and I'll be way out of shape.

01:42:19.569 --> 01:42:20.430
Thanks for coming.

01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:21.110
See you soon.

01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:28.084
Ah, I can go check the P.O.

01:42:28.144 --> 01:42:28.784
box today.

01:42:28.824 --> 01:42:29.866
That's a good idea.

01:42:29.886 --> 01:42:30.867
I'll go check the P.O.

01:42:30.927 --> 01:42:31.428
box now.

01:42:31.468 --> 01:42:32.649
That's a fun little ride to take.

01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:34.191
Hopefully the P.O.

01:42:34.231 --> 01:42:42.321
box works, and it wasn't using CrowdStrike as a... as a, um... as a antivirus, and I won't be able to get that door to open.

01:42:42.401 --> 01:42:44.423
That key shouldn't have any... Anyway.

01:42:45.164 --> 01:42:45.625
Love you guys.
