WEBVTT

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
You schedule for 60 minutes next

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
It's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's embarrassing

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm going to need a sound check from you characters for a second please

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Sound check

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
Let me know that's okay and we'll get this thing show on the road

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Christie says it's good, I'm a little low

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
That might be, but it'll be alright

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
I'll turn myself up after the start

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Music

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Same old, same old here at Gigo and biological

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
The illusion of consensus about the faith in a novel virus

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
We're trying to dispel that fame by calling it what it is, it's a lie

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And that's how we do it around here

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
We tell the truth about intramuscular injection

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
We tell the truth about transfection

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And we tell the truth about

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Viruses not being patterned in degrees

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Music

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There was no spread in New York City, ladies and gentlemen

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Infectious clones are the only real thing you need to understand

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
placebo batches were likely distributed in transfection

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And healthy mammals is dumb

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
That means actually that the protocols were murdered in a function of mythology

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
The Scooby-Doo is real and there's this spectacular commitment to lies

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That's what it really means

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's lies about this faith

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And I think that's something that a lot of people still just have a little trouble with

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
But it is a collection of ideas that hasn't been touched by anybody else

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And that's what we seem to have zeroed in on

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
With a few other people around the world actually

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It's not just Gigo and biological

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Gigo and biological is on this spaceship with a few other people

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
And I'm going to give a shout out to a few of those people throughout the evening tonight

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm cutting this right, good evening ladies and gentlemen

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
This is Gigo Home Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Brought to you by a biologist

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
It's the 29th of November, 2023

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
You are seeing a video produced live in the back of a garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
It's evening here, but it might be morning or new afternoon or night where you are

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So wherever you are, hello and I wish you all the best

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
It is almost the fourth year of this drama

06:48.000 --> 06:57.000
Almost the start of the fourth year of this elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated on the planet

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And that's not to say that there isn't real biology involved

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
But it is a hoax about a pandemic about a runaway RNA molecule

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And that's what we're really here

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
That's the mythology that we're here to dispel

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Well, that was a very abrupt sound change

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
My apologies for that, I'm going to have to fix that somehow

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Just in case you're here for the first time

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I'm the same guy and is in that white suit there

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I spent about 20 years of my life being a neurobiologist

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I was really a microscope jockey

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
And you can look me up on PubMed

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
So you can kind of maybe read about some of the things that I did, some of the studies that I contributed to

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
And the reason why we call it giga-ohm biological is because the electrical seal that was involved in making the recordings that I did

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
When I was a biologist

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Was of the giga-ohm level of resistance

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
And so, in just kind of a geeky way, I took that name and turned it into an online news program

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
And here we are three years later

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
And I've been explaining to my viewers over the last couple years

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
That what I think has actually been done to us, including myself

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Is that we were tricked into solving a mystery of their own design

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And their own design

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
I don't know who they are, it's an amorphous, you know, totally haphazard, egotistical yuppies

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I don't know what it stands for, but they

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Is this amorphous group of oligarchs, rich people, of weaponized piles

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Of money that have, you know, somewhat coordinatedly

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Bamboozled us into believing that Mother Nature poses this threat

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
And that this threat can also be accessed, you know, through laboratory passage

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And through animal passage and through cell culture

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And through all kinds of genetics tools that we now have, like CRISPR-Cas9

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
And all of this mythology accounts or adds up to an illusion of consensus

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
About a worst-case scenario, about what might have happened

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
And even if it's not what happened this time, it's definitely what could happen in the future

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
And therefore, we need to fundamentally reorganize the way that we deal with public health threats

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
We need to fundamentally reorganize how our entire economies function

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
Because this is just one aspect of a greater climate change, climate crisis

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
That's going to require digital ID and digital currency

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
That's where we're going, that's the entire narrative

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
A lot of people were saying it in 2020 and they were called crazy

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
And then more people started saying it in 2021 and they were called crazy

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
And now we're here in 2023 at the cusp of 2024

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
And people are still saying it and people are still calling them crazy

09:46.000 --> 09:55.000
Michael Yeden said it in front of a, let's say, conservative party in Germany

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
And it seems that in some ways his video was edited from the main archive

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Although there is mention of him in a highlight reel, an hour-long highlight reel of that meeting

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
But they don't really say what he said then

10:11.000 --> 10:21.000
So maybe the world responded to our video, maybe the world responded to Uwe's protest of them editing him out

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
But it responded in a pretty lame way and there's still no video of his speech

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
And his speech basically is, you know, right in line with what we're saying

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
Not to say that Mike and I talk very much, but the times that we have communicated

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
We've been pretty much, you know, right in line with each other

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Anyway, I think this is, you know, for the people that are here all the time

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
This is really, really, really old at this stage and it's getting kind of really old, old

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
But I'm starting to think of it kind of like a jazz show

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
And you can have the same songs and even the same set list and it can be a different show every night

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And at this stage, this is how it's going to have to be for a while

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Before we really get this message out, because over the next few weeks, what we're hoping for

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Although it could just be, you know, a firework, you light it and it doesn't do anything

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Because it's soaking wet in the rain

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
When Bobby's book comes out and we maybe get a little bit more

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
We get a little bit more chance to get our message out

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
We can be very clear and concise about the possibility space that we are trying to call attention to

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
And not get trapped somehow into the role of a divider or the description of a divider

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
Or the, I don't know, somebody who thinks that he knows everything

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Somebody who's a self-appointed expert with Dunning-Kruger syndrome or whatever the heck they call it

11:57.000 --> 12:07.000
So, I really think it's important at this stage for all of us that watch, that share here on GIGO and biological

12:07.000 --> 12:19.000
To be articulate enough to be certain that the possibility space that we are trying to describe is real and valid

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
And at the same time be humble enough to show and describe how wide that possibility space is

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
And therefore we can't be certain about what parts are right and wrong

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
We just know for sure that the truth is in this space and not in this space

12:37.000 --> 12:46.000
The truth is not to be found in the reality where RNA can go around the earth for three and a half to four years straight

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
Starting from a puddle, that's not a real reality

12:51.000 --> 13:01.000
So if you're arguing with a sort of biological cartoon that is essentially that, you're already off base

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
And so we've got to be able to bring people to understand that that's the reason why you're wrong

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
It's not that you listen to Fox News and you should be listening to MSNBC

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
It's not that you think it's a lab leak and it's not a lab leak

13:15.000 --> 13:25.000
It's that by being over here in this mythological biological space where a single RNA molecule or maybe 50

13:25.000 --> 13:33.000
That are leaked, that are sprayed, released, sneezed, found, inhaled

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't know what verb you want to use, but if those molecules are activated and then they get to do their thing

13:39.000 --> 13:49.000
Apparently they can create trillions of copies of themselves and coat the lungs of the world in their progeny

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
And that biology doesn't exist, that biology doesn't exist

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
That's why there's so much good to be had in the no-virus argument

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
The no-virus discussion because so much of this illusion is it can be captured in this idea

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
That there isn't such a thing

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
But to say that there are no such things on smaller scales

14:16.000 --> 14:24.000
To say that there are no such things on even maybe an individual, an individual basis

14:24.000 --> 14:35.000
That we're not shedding proteins and exosomes that are in the size scale of viruses that could be distorted or misconstrued as viruses

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
And so that when you say there's no virus you've got to be very precise

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
You must be very precise, of course there are signals in this size range

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Of course some of those signals are DNA and RNA based

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
Of course some of those signals are coated in proteins

14:53.000 --> 15:04.000
But are they all pathogenic? Are they all evidence of a pathogen? Are they all the cause of the symptomology that they correlate in time with?

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Or presence of? That's a different question

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
And I think the no-virus people have been very crafty

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
About taking that very important set of questions

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
And isolating them in such a way so that they're not useful enough to bridge the gap between this mythology and the truth

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
Wow, did you hear how well I just said that? That's exactly what it is

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
They take these no-virus ideas and they isolate them so that they are not useful

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
In bridging the gap between the mythology of viruses and the truth of whatever the real biology is

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
And the real biology is not zero, no signals

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
The real biology is not that there's nothing at this size scale or that there is no intracellular communication

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Or that there is no pathogenic signals at this size scale

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
It's just a question of have they been mischaracterized? Have we been misled about their significance?

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Have we been misled about how they can be combated? Or what kinds of therapeutics are necessary

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
And this is all different questions than there are no viruses

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
And that's what they'll magical about what they did

16:22.000 --> 16:32.000
That's what makes me certain that some of them, wittingly or unwittingly, participated in the establishment of this confusion

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
This chaos that's allowing them to try to establish this new order

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
And that's what it is, it's like it's just like Ovid

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Where chaos is the natural state of things and order is imposed

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
So if you want to do a new order, you have to pass through chaos

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
We're living through a Greek tragedy being orchestrated by, I guess, them, whoever they are

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
And how many teams are there? I don't know, but I tried to explain it yesterday

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
That really doesn't have to be everybody that's pulling and pushing on the train is really working together

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
Necessarily, they could be working together the lie to the kids in the subway station

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
But they don't have to be working together with each other, they could be competing

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
And in the end, after the kids leave, one group's going to kill the other group, I don't know

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Wow, I just went way off there

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Anyway, the point is that we have this illusion of consensus

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Which has established this enchantment across the earth

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
It's something that is really spectacular to behold

17:40.000 --> 17:48.000
And I would give a lot to understand how this enchantment looks and feels from another perspective

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
Like if I had lived in Norway during the pandemic, what would have happened to me

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
If I would have lived as a Chinese person, you know, how are they experiencing this?

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
Is there anyone like me in China that thinks that, you know, are there no virus people in China?

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
Are there no virus people in India? I mean, these are things I wonder

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
Are they controlling all of these populations with the same narrative control set?

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
You know, with like a no-virus person and a virus person, so then, you know, I just wonder

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
There's a book or two to be read there

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
So I want to give a big shout out to my friend Mark Koolak, I'm going to see if I can do this switch

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
He's done a few videos where he's talked about a woman by the name of Margaret Liu

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
And I think I've been kind of convinced that it's worth looking into her as well

18:44.000 --> 18:53.000
And so rather than watching one of his videos, I thought I would try to sort of contribute to this catalog of this archive

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
By adding a study hall of my own

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
So here's one of the ones that Mark has

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
This one, I believe, is on Huzatonic Live 2

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
It's got an amazing 617 views

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
So it's really, I mean, changing minds all over the world

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
And then there's another video, actually, and that should come out like that

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And that one is on Huzatonic Live 3

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
And that one has 477 views, so another one that's just absolutely changing the world

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
But you can help, you can watch them, you can learn from them, you can see why

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
So these are farther back in time

19:31.000 --> 19:37.000
The one that I want to go to, actually, is one that she gave in January of 2021

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
And I don't know if you'll remember exactly what was going on in January of 2021

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
But I certainly do

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
The transfection was just being released as an investigational vaccine

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
And so we're going to see a wonderful sales pitch by this lady

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
For the COVID vaccines

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And I think it's really going to be a really fun video to watch with you

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
On this Wednesday evening

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
And this is where I'm calling it a way back Wednesday

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Because it's going back to 2021, so it's not really way back

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah, so let's just play this

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Recording, it's right now

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
There she is up here

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, what the hell?

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Hold on a second, I don't know why I jumped ahead there

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
I'm going to turn my thing off here, get my head out of the way

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And I think that should be working

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Sorry about that

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I am going to speed it up, I think it's probably okay

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
She does have an amazingly normal American accent

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
So it shouldn't be too hard for you guys to understand her

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeeha

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Here we go, oh, I think that'll work

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Recording, it's right now

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
So, yeah, the recording started, okay

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Okay, great, so I'm going to talk about at least at both vaccines

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
And the coronavirus because both of them are important

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I just wanted to make sure I have disclosures

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm on the SAB of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
But I will say that everybody was so busy

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
We actually haven't had an SAB meeting

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
And I haven't talked specifically about the data

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
With anyone except in some virtual symposia

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
That I've helped organize, you know, I run a session or something

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
And although the vector is one that Jenner's been working on

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
For over a decade, so I have been involved with that

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I'm also the scientific lead for the WHO group

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
That's drafting guidelines for mRNA vaccines

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
But again, I won't be presenting anything that is confidential

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
The guidelines actually are on the WHO website now

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
For public comment because we get comment from all of the worldwide regulators

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
And people working on this

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
So I just want to start by putting this into context

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
You know, events like 9-11 and Pearl Harbor

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Are seared into our, if not our memories

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
You know, because I don't think we were around for Pearl Harbor

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
But certainly into our consciousness

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And they're great tragedies

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And yet you look at how many people died from COVID

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Basically last week on one single day

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It was 4200, so greater than either of them

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
And if you look at the dates, the deaths to date

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
As of yesterday, it was over 400,000

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
And actually topped the total number of US World War II deaths

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
So, you know, people keep saying, oh, this is just influenza

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
This is not just influenza, influenza

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
In an average, you may have 30,000 to 60,000 deaths

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Which is still too many

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
But this is not the same thing

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And so we stir, what the heck was that? Oh no

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
So we start with this idea right away, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
That this is not influenza, this is a different virus

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
This is a different thing, she's laying it down right away

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And remember where these deaths are coming from

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Remember what we know now

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
What we know is that in April, March and April

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
In New York City, there was an extraordinary change in the behavior of people

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
That resulted in lots and lots and lots of people dying all at once

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
A mass casualty event

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And there were a few other places in the United States

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Where mass casualty events occurred, but no real evidence of spread

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And that's where these numbers come from

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Deaths from COVID, deaths from COVID, you know, deaths from 9-11

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
I mean, this is really dark kind of analogies that they're making

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And they're doing this on purpose, that's the point to realize

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
In retrospect, if you see it for what it is

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
A national security exercise

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Where once they decide, and this is key

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Once they decided to pull the trigger

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
Part of the exercise is to get the public to be convinced

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
That the worst case scenario is occurring

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That's part of the exercise

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
That's part of the drill or it's part of the plan

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Because if you don't convince them

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
That it's the worst case scenario

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
And it is, then you're screwed

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And if you convince them that the worst case scenario

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
They'll follow all the directives and even if it's not

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
You'll still look like you're successful

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So all the ways that you game that out

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
That's what you do

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And so

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
If she's playing along

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
If she's not playing along, this is the line

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This is the line everybody is told to tell

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
This is the ones they're told in the briefings

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
It's just that

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Depending on how you judge this

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
You know, you can go look at some of those videos that Mark has archived

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
And decide for yourself if this is somebody who's just

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You know, a casual player

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Or if this is an insider

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
And somebody who is really on point with her messaging

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
As we watch this video, try to keep track

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Excuse me, of the number of times that you feel that she's like

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Extremely on point

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Like now, extremely on point

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Comparing deaths in the U.S. from COVID to other causes

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
This is very dramatic to compare it to 9-11

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
To compare it to Pearl Harbor

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
That's in a World War II deaths

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
That's some serious spectacular smack talk here

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
On purpose

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
And it also, because it's affecting people of all ages

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
And has a disproportionate effect on people of color

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And people in lower socioeconomic statuses

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
It's actually, in a sense, even a greater tragedy

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Because of that, because it just amplifies all of the social injustices

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That are ongoing in our country and around the world

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
This is going to be actually my take-home message

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
But I thought I'd put it up front

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So even if you've had a vaccine or when you get a vaccine

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
You still need to keep doing everything you're doing now

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Masked distancing, avoiding interactions

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And I'm going to explain why

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Part of that's because of these new, straightening that front

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
So even if you've had a vaccine or when you get a vaccine

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
You still need to keep doing everything

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
So that's pretty spectacular, right?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I mean, that is, that is

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
That is spectacular now that we look back at that one

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
I mean, even after you reached how does she know that?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
She knows that, why? Because

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Because she knows that MRNA is not going to do it

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Like, she knows that the antibodies don't do it

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Like, that's the funny part

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Oh, my goodness, it's amazing

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
The thing you're doing now, mask distancing, avoiding interactions

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
And I'm going to explain why

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Part of that's because of these new strains that have arisen

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Okay, so for a vaccine, you basically

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Usually people think about wanting antibiotics

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Antibodies are these little Y-shaped proteins

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
That will bind to a virus

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
And by, in this case, by binding to the spike

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Which is what binds to the receptor on the cell

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It prevents the virus from getting into the cell

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
So this is pretty straightforward

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And there are lots of antibodies that can be effective

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And some that bind to the virus

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
But don't, in fact, prevent the virus from getting in

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
So the kind of antibody you want

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Are neutralizing antibody

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And that's just important to know, because when you look at the

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Papers and so on about a vaccine

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
They usually will report both regular antibodies

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And then they specifically look at neutralizing antibodies

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I want to go to also emphasize

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
That it turns out this receptor for the virus

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Is present on essentially every cell

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, not maybe your red blood cells

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
But it's present on cells of your heart, your eyes, your kidneys

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
Your blood vessels, your liver, your gut, as well as your lungs

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So this explains one reason why

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It's so important to prevent infection

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Because this isn't just like influenza where people get pneumonia

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
They get lung infection, they get a cold like thing

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
This can have an impact on your whole body

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And this is one reason that some people have

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
What's called long COVID

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
They keep having issues

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Whether it's their brain that they have brain fog

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Or things like that, or whether it's people who have worse

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And kidney failure

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Now, I think one of the things that would be fun to talk about right now

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Just if you don't mind

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Is the idea that

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
Whether these claims matter

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And I actually think they do and I'm going to tell you why they matter

27:34.000 --> 27:40.000
The ACE2 receptor is also a receptor in circulation

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Which they don't, she doesn't seem to live list here

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
And that means something

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
I don't really, physiologically understand exactly the difference between the membrane bound one

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And the one that's in circulation

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
But the point is that

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
If you were hit

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Transfected with a clone

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And that's what you'd have to call it

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
If you were hit with a lipid nanoparticle that had the

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Let's say the whole coronavirus genome

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And so it's essentially a synthetic coronavirus

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
If you were hit with that

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
You were hit with liposomes that have this RNA in it

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Which can be manufactured as a clone

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Using the same recombinant DNA technology that they use to make the RNA

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
You could make a SARS-CoV-2 infectious clone

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And you could make as much of it as you wanted

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
In theory you could

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Just like they made as much as they wanted to

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Of the mRNA, yes it's a little bit longer

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
But it's not impossible

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That's one possibility

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
But understand that the other possibility is even

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
A little creepier

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And that is that they could have transfected people just with the spike protein

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
If the spike protein interferes with ACE2

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Can stimulate ACE2

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It's an agonist for it

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
And it could bring in things

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It is a transfection agent

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Which can bring things in

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
They could transfect people with anything

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
And so what you have here is sort of like a dual narrative

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Almost as if, you know, we're going to tell you that there's this pathogen out there

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
And it has all these attributes

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Which are actually ideal

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
For transfecting many different organs in your body

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Which means that when we transfect people with this agent

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
They'll have many different syndromes

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Many different symptomologies

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
But they'll always test positive for our toxic spike protein

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
They'll always test positive for a nucleocapsid protein

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Because there's always coronavirus around

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
So we have these overlapping signals in the background

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
And maybe ones that we add to the foreground

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
To produce the symptomologies in places that we need the symptomologies to be

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
To produce the sequences in the places where we need to be

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And anywhere we need to have the whole sequence we can just put it there

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Because as you saw from Peter Cullis' talk yesterday

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
We can put any size DNA we want

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Any size RNA we want inside of a small lipid nanoparticle

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And many, many copies of it

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
So of course we could transfect a cloned RNA sequence

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Of a purported SARS virus

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Put it in a lipid nanoparticle and spray it

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And apply it

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
And people who inhaled it would have this RNA in their lungs

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
And if this RNA needed a way to get in

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Maybe one of the ways to get it in would be

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
ACE2 but it doesn't need to be

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Because lipid nanoparticles don't need that kind of stuff

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
You see

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
So they tell you this amazing story of a widespread receptor

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
To try to give you the idea that this thing can do all kinds of stuff

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
It's telling you a story about a mythological virus that's a

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
I remember people describing SARS

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
SARS-CoV-2 as a Swiss Army Knife

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh my gosh, do you remember

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
People described the spike protein as a Swiss Army Knife

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
A Swiss Army Knife that allowed it to do all this stuff

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
And this was just one blade, the ACE2 blade

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
It was a magnificent, magnificent performance over those two years

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And it went from top to bottom

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
There were lots of people that were on the dissident side

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
That were complaining about the spike protein

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Because of how it was targeting

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
The ACE2 with such exquisite fidelity

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
High affinity

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Crazy high affinity

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Think about this

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
See it for what it is

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
It is amazing

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Because if you hear Peter tell you how easy it would be

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
To do the things that I've said that they could have done

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Which is put a clone in a few places

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
So that they would get what looked like

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Culturable virus from certain people

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
That they could claim was almost identical to

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
Culturable virus that they got from other people

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
In a different part of the planet

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Even where people were trying to debunk the story like in Iran

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
They found that sequence

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
How would they do it?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
It's very, very simple

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
Lipid nanoparticle with the RNA or the DNA that they wanted to be there

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
They might not have needed to use the RNA

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
They could have used the DNA, but why would they use the RNA?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
That's the question, the question is easy

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
They would use the RNA because it would be less dangerous

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
That's what I think

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Lipid nanoparticle with DNA in it

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
I bet you that ain't even close to fun

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I bet that's not even

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
There's a reason why there's no talks on the internet about DNA in lipid nanoparticles

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I don't know why

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
But my guess is there's a reason why they aren't talking about that

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
I think there's a pretty good reason why they're not talking about that

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
So that's where we are ladies and gentlemen, that's where we are

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
We are about one inch away from the bricks

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
And although we can't see them, I can smell them, I can smell the moisture behind them

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
I mean, we are looking at the back wall of the theater right now

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen, when we look in retrospect

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's just amazing

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So she used to work for Merck

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
There's a few other things we should know about her that maybe we'll find out as we watch those other videos

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Or the kids, you know, there's no

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
They'll get on in the website right now

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Sometimes they don't even know they had COVID and then a few weeks later it turns out they have the syndrome

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
And it's probably because the virus can infect so many tissues

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
And sometimes people's only presentation might be a little abdominal pain or diarrhea

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Or not even diarrhea, but a little bit of abdominal pain, things like that

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So I just wanted to emphasize this

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
First of all, you can be alert to symptoms

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
It's not just the cough

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, wow

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh, wow

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So she worked for VICO

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
That's interesting, I know another person who worked for VICO, I think that was Robert Malone

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
That's interesting

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Huh, for DNA flu vaccines

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
In 1993 already, holy cow, are you kidding me?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Holy Moses

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
She went to Harvard

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Gene Therapy at Chiron Corporation

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
International Vaccine Institute

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
Senior Advisor of Vaccinology at Bill Gates Foundation

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I mean, whoa

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
See, so that's handy

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
And you can find that all on Mark's page with Margaret and Lou

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah, so you know, that's

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
That's pretty good here, I'll drop the link in here, see if you guys can figure that out

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I'll just keep this playing, kudos to Mark

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
The other point I wanted to make is that

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
Even though a lot of people can't get COVID and be asymptomatic

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Your risk of getting serious disease increases, both with age

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
As everyone knows, that's why we're starting immunization with people

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And older age groups are moving down

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That's not me breathing, that's somebody up there

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know who it is

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
And what's important is that, you know, these aren't just people who, like you say, oh, how they're really sick

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Actually, it includes, you know, many regular people walking around

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That you don't think about them being sick, have type 2 diabetes

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Or they have hypertension, which I've had for years

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Hypertension increases your risk for more serious illness

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Okay, so what are the vaccine technologies?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Well, there's a whole bunch of them, actually at the end

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
I'm gonna give you a WHO website that lists all the different ones in development

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
But I'm only gonna really focus on the ones that are the closest

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Either are already authorized for users, the closest to getting there

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Because these are the ones that are of most interest to us

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
So the first one are the, this is the, these are the two vaccines that have gotten, oops, sorry, that have gotten approval for use

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Now I want to emphasize just that these aren't licensed yet, they've got emergency use, authorization

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
And so that, it's a distinction because it means that they will, they will always continue to gather more information

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
But in this case, they really will continue very seriously to gather more information

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
So what this is, this is the little piece of RNA, and RNA is the, basically

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
So did you hear what she said there?

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Yeah, it is an informative illustration, indeed

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
She said that they're gonna continue to gather information, that, that, that piqued my, my ear

37:16.000 --> 37:26.000
And remember the talk of different doses, the talk of placebo batches, the talk of maybe different preparations, this is all real

37:26.000 --> 37:36.000
And so if they rolled out small batches of things they wanted to test their toxicity on test the effects of, I guarantee you they did it

37:37.000 --> 37:45.000
This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to test out a lot of different formulations with no questions asked

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
No batches kept track of, come on

37:49.000 --> 38:01.000
This was the absolute open door, perfect time to do all of that, and you can bet your bottom dollar, they did it because then they could also, they could also use that as a story

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
To point to, you know, mistakes in manufacturing or contamination

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It's useful mud in the water

38:12.000 --> 38:22.000
The intentional, like, obfuscation of the results on purpose that they would know because they know what they did

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
But we wouldn't know because we assumed that they tried to make a uniform product base

38:28.000 --> 38:38.000
Are you seeing the illusion yet? I think you are, I think everybody is, I think that's why there's a hundred people watching right now because it's really easy to see it

38:38.000 --> 38:46.000
It's like getting a coded message that then tells the body how to make a protein, so this mRNA codes for the spike protein of the coronavirus

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
And so in your body, your body is the thing that takes this message and turns it into a protein that now becomes the antigen that makes a specific immune response

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Your body sees it and says, oh, this is a foreign protein, I have to make antibodies against it

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
It turns out mRNA is really unstable, it breaks down very quickly, and so in order to deliver it, they had to put it inside this protective lipid nanoparticle

39:04.000 --> 39:13.000
So I like to say that this is like having chocolate that's put inside candy coating, and so the reason you have M&Ms instead of eating chocolate chips most of the time, although I have been known to eat chocolate chips directly out of the back

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
Usually you prefer to have it in a candy coating to protect the chocolate from melting, so that's what was done to mRNA the specific lipid nanoparticles

39:21.000 --> 39:31.000
Okay, so it turns out that if you give mRNA, which is in fact the vaccine, then your body makes the protein, which is now the antigen that actually induces the immune response

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
There actually are efforts to use DNA as well, and those are also in clinical trials, and this is something that I have worked on for a long time

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
That quite honestly we dealt with a lot of the safety and immunologic issues that made it then easier to move mRNA along faster

39:43.000 --> 39:53.000
So we dealt with a lot of the immunological issues that made it easier to move mRNA along faster

39:53.000 --> 40:02.000
So we dealt with a lot of the immunological issues, the safety issues that allowed mRNA to move faster

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
So they're kind of saying the DNA still has these problems, but with RNA we were able to get rid of them

40:08.000 --> 40:16.000
Wow, that is spectacularly wrong, that cannot be true, that is hand waving

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
The antigen that actually induces the immune response, there actually are efforts to use DNA as well, and those are also in clinical trials, and this is something that I have worked on for a long time

40:24.000 --> 40:29.000
But quite honestly we dealt with a lot of the safety and immunologic issues that made it then easier to move mRNA along faster

40:29.000 --> 40:39.000
No, no, so she's saying that her early work on DNA made it easier, they dealt with a lot of the safety issues, and so that made it easier for RNA to come forward

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
Okay, so I misunderstood that, don't make sure you hear that correction

40:44.000 --> 40:57.000
Sometimes people say, wow, this has all been too fast, but in fact, we've been working on DNA vaccines for not quite that almost 30 years, and mRNA for about the same period of time, but definitely over the past 15 years, and so even though the vaccines got developed really quickly

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
The technology had been worked on for decades

41:00.000 --> 41:13.000
So the other two, without success, that are getting close to having vaccines is first of all viral vectors, and this technology uses a different virus, in this case people are usually using an adenovirus, which is a kind of virus that causes the common cold

41:13.000 --> 41:24.000
And what they do is they remove enough of its own gene so that you don't have replication, so it's not infectious anymore, and instead you put in a gene for whatever you want, like the spike protein, and so what happens is you can take advantage of the

41:24.000 --> 41:36.000
outside of the virus, which has all these special proteins that bind the cells and help it deliver its payload from the inside into the cell, but you will never get either COVID because this gene only codes for the spike, it doesn't code for the whole protein

41:36.000 --> 41:46.000
And likewise you won't get an infection with this outside virus that the adenovirus in most cases because the rest of the adenovirus genes aren't here, so that it can't replicate itself either

41:46.000 --> 42:02.000
So isn't it interesting that she's able to explain how the coronavirus binds to a receptor, and she had a diagram for it, and she had the receptor and the binding and all kinds of stuff, and then for the adenovirus, it's supposed to do the same thing, but it's not really

42:02.000 --> 42:16.000
important, what receptor it uses or how it gets in, no details are really given, do you find that curious, I kind of find that curious, I kind of find that really curious

42:16.000 --> 42:26.000
Why doesn't she have to tell us how an adenovirus vector enters cells, what receptor does it use, what is the physiological mechanism that they blame for that?

42:26.000 --> 42:44.000
Isn't that, don't you find that fascinating, I find it extremely fascinating, especially because I, to the best of my knowledge, used adenovirus based vectors for all the transfections basically that I did in mice, there were only a few that weren't

42:44.000 --> 43:00.000
So, yeah, there's many questions I've got there, also remember that she already dropped at once that RNA is very, very wimpy, RNA is very fragile, so it had to be in the lipid nanoparticle

43:01.000 --> 43:23.000
That's not really technically true, RNA is not particularly fragile, RNA is very susceptible to enzymatic degradation, specifically RNases, which are pretty ubiquitous on our skin and in our plasma, we have a lot of these enzymes all over the place

43:23.000 --> 43:39.000
So, the voodoo of working on a molecular biology bench is you clean the whole bench with ethanol and you wipe it all down and then you wear gloves because you don't want any RNases to get in your sample and degrade your RNA

43:39.000 --> 43:51.000
But it's not because of temperature or something, you're not like worried that, oh, don't turn on the fans in here, the heat's too high, you'll degrade my RNA

43:51.500 --> 44:14.000
It's very funny because it's weird to describe RNA as being fragile, it's not fragile, it's degradable, and there's lots of enzymes around because we want no free RNA around, so there are enzymes everywhere to get rid of it, but it's not fragile, it's not like, that's weird

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Okay, I went off on a tangent again, I'm never going to get done

44:18.000 --> 44:27.000
It's kind of like a Trojan horse, but in a good way, another vaccine that is coming along that is behind the next two adenovirus vaccines or recombinant proteins, and that's what's called NOVAX

44:27.000 --> 44:37.000
So, a recombinant protein is basically a way of putting it into cells in a manufacturing facility and having those cells produce the protein, then you purify the protein and you give it to people

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
So you can see how these technologies actually take longer than simply making a piece of DNA or making a piece of RNA

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
So I'm going to just go through these because they're not the two that are coming up next

44:47.000 --> 44:54.000
One of the issues is that these are complicated to make because you have to grow the virus and yet your virus isn't replicating

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
So somehow you still have to make it produce enough and then you have to purify it and still have it stable and so on

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
Wow, so you're not going to explain it any better than that, you have to make a lot of virus

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
But you don't want it to be replicable virus

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
Now, I just want to throw out a little anecdote here because it's actually really interesting

45:18.000 --> 45:28.000
I was on a call and I don't know if I streamed it or not, but I was on a call where Byron Bridal got to ask a question at the end

45:28.000 --> 45:39.000
and he stated that a light went on when I was giving my talk because of the replication in competence

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
and the ratio of it

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
and he has tried to make a denivirus-based vaccines

45:47.000 --> 45:56.000
and there is a certain amount of replication competence that you need in order for this vaccine to work

45:57.000 --> 46:06.000
and they could not get to the stage where there was enough the ratio of replication competence in competence

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
they could never get there

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
Now, I'm not going to be able to adequately describe the methodology that he was doing

46:13.000 --> 46:21.000
but I do remember very distinctly that this turned on a light bulb in his head and he realized, yeah, that's true

46:22.000 --> 46:32.000
we had trouble making a high fidelity uniform sample of an adenivirus

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
we did, it was really hard to do it

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
most of the particles did nothing and he realized that, he knew that

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
and it was a problem for him as he worked on an adenivirus and adenivirus vaccine

46:45.000 --> 46:53.000
it makes me believe, and I recall thinking this at the time, that this guy has got to be a good guy

46:53.000 --> 46:59.000
because actually this would mean that he kind of failed at making the vaccine that whatever he was trying to make

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
because his quality control expectations were biologically based

47:04.000 --> 47:14.000
he had this idea of what he wanted to use and he was unable to create it

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
because of the limitations of the system that he was using

47:18.000 --> 47:25.000
and it revealed the limitation of the biological source, you know, what this is in the wild

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
and how it had to be with coronavirus

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
let's let her keep going, obviously I want to keep going here

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
but I also want to keep narrating and keep you understanding why we went back to this video and why it's such a goldmine

47:41.000 --> 47:52.000
they are laying down the narrative now, they haven't actually pulled the J&J shot, they haven't actually pulled the AstraZeneca shot yet

47:53.000 --> 48:00.000
so she's still selling you this narrative that each one of these has its pros and cons

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
you know J&J and AstraZeneca are one shot, Moderna is going to be two shots

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
and the second shot might be worse than the first shot but you might get better antibodies from this one than that one

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
because this one is only one and we don't know if this one will last as long as these two

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
and they both need to have cold but this one needs to be colder

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
and so they're trying to set down this thing where you have all these different questions that you have to find answers for

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
and none of them matter because you shouldn't be taking this crap anyway

48:32.000 --> 48:41.000
but instead of the focus of this being informed consent and really making a decision about whether or not you needed

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
and trying to give you a real good idea of the biology and the risk of this

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
it is just all about well you know which one of these blouses will look better on you

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
which of those two shoes do you like, you like the black ones or the white ones

48:56.000 --> 49:05.000
like it's extraordinary because they did this under duress, under lockdown, under threat of

49:05.000 --> 49:11.000
I mean Brett Weinstein had been doing a whole year of his podcast where he's got a bandana around his neck

49:11.000 --> 49:21.000
talking about bushmeat and saying that Ivermectin is a great prophylactic for this crazy virus that other people are taking a vaccine for

49:21.000 --> 49:34.000
so people were really coerced, they were corralled, riled up and driven around like lemmings in all different directions with fireworks and scary stuff

49:34.000 --> 49:46.000
TikTok videos and then you got these people who are supposed to be the you know people in the ivory tower and they're academy-gicians

49:46.000 --> 49:59.000
they're casting the spell of the state, they're casting the spell of the theater, they're actually main players in the game, in the big show

50:00.000 --> 50:09.000
which is why I use the Monday night football theme because this is a big show, it is an absolutely huge, huge show

50:13.000 --> 50:20.000
it's just a gigantic show and it was done all over the world like this

50:21.000 --> 50:30.000
the reason I mention that is because the two that are coming along next to AstraZeneca chat-ox vaccine in the Janssen and Janssen both have had manufacturing problems

50:30.000 --> 50:39.000
and that's what slowed down their development, they had thought they would be ready earlier so for example the Janssen vaccine is what's, they're using an adenovirus 26 that's a common cold virus

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
their results are expected to be released by the end of January and Tony Fauci just said yesterday he thinks that the decision may be made in as short as two weeks from then

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
although usually it takes three or four weeks for the FDA and the committees to go through

50:50.000 --> 51:00.000
and are you noticing that she called it a common cold virus, the adenovirus is a common cold virus, the corona virus is a common cold virus, the rhinovirus is a common cold virus

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
there's a lot of different viruses that were common colds but before the pandemic the common cold was corona virus

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
let's give no mistake about it

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
I mean let's just be serious here

51:18.000 --> 51:29.000
anybody find an immunology book and show me maybe you'll find a paragraph where they say that common colds are caused by corona virus, rhinovirus and others

51:29.000 --> 51:42.000
but to say this as without the precision of saying adenovirus is one of the viruses thought to cause the common cold

51:42.000 --> 51:51.000
but to say that this is a common cold virus to differentiate from corona virus which is also common cold viruses

51:51.000 --> 51:58.000
as least as far as the biology pre-pandemic goes, I'm not, again when I say a lot of these things you know nitpickers out there

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
I'm trying to be as precise as possible but it's hard to be precise in a land of mythology

52:04.000 --> 52:14.000
so sometimes I'm just trying to say that if the TV understanding of what happened before the pandemic versus what's happening after the pandemic should be somewhat congruent

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
then I like to point out the incongruencies there

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
and for the 20 years before the pandemic let's face it, common cold corona viruses

52:23.000 --> 52:33.000
that's what they basically told you in biology books and medical textbooks and if they didn't they listed things and when they listed things the first thing they listed was the corona virus

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
and the idea that adenovirus is a common cold virus is a little bit of a stretch

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
you know thousands of pages of data to make a decision

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
the nice thing about this vaccine is it might be one dose but I do want to emphasize is that even though the one dose may be enough to make your antibody tighter behind enough at the end

52:54.000 --> 53:01.000
it still is going to take time to get there so just like now the two vaccines that are being used take two doses and they're always very careful to say you need to wait

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
you know a week or two in fact two weeks is better and longer is even better probably before you can consider self protected

53:07.000 --> 53:12.000
but just because this is a one dose vaccine what they've said is by day 71 after the vaccine they have these nice high titers

53:12.000 --> 53:21.000
so you shouldn't assume that because it's one dose you're protected faster necessarily it's simply that it's a lot easier to administer one dose than to have people have to come back for two doses

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
so you have this one that Janssen J&J is probably going to be the next one the US has ordered 100 million doses now the reason that's important is for example the Pfizer vaccine the US also ordered 100 million doses

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
but because it's a two dose vaccine that's only enough for 50 million people where this would be enough for 100 million people

53:35.000 --> 53:45.000
one of the key things about both of the recombinant vector vaccines is that they only need regular refrigeration and they're very stable so you've probably heard about already being used vaccines the mRNA vaccines have to have

53:45.000 --> 53:53.000
super cold freezers and the Pfizer one has to be minus 70 degrees Celsius which is most hospitals do not have freezers like that so these are the advantages

53:53.000 --> 54:02.000
like most hospitals we're going to run out of ventilators most hospitals we're going to run out of ventilators most hospitals don't have a minus 80 freezer

54:02.000 --> 54:11.000
so there's lots of logistics that the government's going to have to figure out and more of this rollout is going to be able to save us

54:11.000 --> 54:18.000
it's spectacular if you see it now for what it is January 2021

54:18.000 --> 54:41.000
Margaret Lou, former Vicoll scientist, former Merck scientist giving a talk at a at a cancer group worked on AstraZeneca's Chadox vaccine advised others spectacular absolutely spectacularly on narrative

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
I wouldn't doubt it if she already knows that they're going to pull the adenovirus vaccines in a year that she already knows that that's the plan

54:49.000 --> 54:59.000
that she already knows that they're going to come out and say oh we don't need those minus 80 freezers anymore whoops

54:59.000 --> 55:14.000
turns out they're great turns out these things are very robust it's just fine it's no problem it's fine you have to use microfluidics in order to get a uniform lipid nanoparticles in size and loading

55:14.000 --> 55:27.000
but once you use a microfluidics particle thing you're going to understand that if you put it in a vial and then ship it in a truck it'll all be fine when you take it out you just got to shake it a little bit

55:27.000 --> 55:45.000
I mean and what happens when the lipid nanoparticles become they they glop together in larger liposomes what does that become it becomes toxic oh wow crazy so all these things you know all these things are just compounding

55:45.000 --> 56:01.000
on top of this and what are we talking about we're talking about refrigeration one or two doses is it going to be convenient for you to come back in a few weeks or should you take the more convenient single shot adenovirus while it's available

56:01.000 --> 56:15.000
don't forget though they're going to run out because there's only 100 million doses so you know make your decision while you can and do it wisely you know create create as much demand as possible Margaret please

56:15.000 --> 56:25.000
is of these particular vaccines now I want to just highlight one last thing about the AstraZeneca vaccine their study was the smallest to date in terms of the number of people they only did a little over 11,000 people

56:25.000 --> 56:37.000
but what was interesting there were two things that were interesting about it is first of all they actually have people swab their noses so they have data on whether or not the people were infected and had virus that they could transmit

56:37.000 --> 56:49.000
whereas the mRNA vaccines that are used in the US when they did those studies all they looked at was if somebody had symptoms then they tested them for virus and so that's why we you know know people that the 95% efficacy means that those people don't get sick

56:49.000 --> 57:00.000
95% of the time I mean there's still is a risk of getting sick but what we don't know is whether those people are in fact infectious themselves and that's a pretty honest vaccines all these vaccines are given by intramuscular injection

57:00.000 --> 57:09.000
and what that means is that you have a systemic antibody response you've got antibodies in your blood so it means that you can protect your lungs your kidneys all these other tissues from getting the virus

57:09.000 --> 57:17.000
but those antibodies in your blood don't usually make it out into your mucosa so you don't have those antibodies in your gut you don't have them in the mucosa of your lungs

57:17.000 --> 57:26.000
there's a special type of antibody that's called IgA and it's called secretory IgA and vaccines that are given intramuscularly don't generate that kind of immunity so this really isn't something that you can just say

57:26.000 --> 57:39.000
oh well if it protects cancerous disease obviously should protect against getting infected because it's a different mechanism and so that we do need to assume that even if you have the any of these vaccines that you still can be infected and not know it and you can be transmitting

57:39.000 --> 57:51.000
now we that's really awesome I didn't think that she was going to say that that's absolutely spectacular I think it's very spot on

57:51.000 --> 58:06.000
it's hard for me to understand why she thinks that these vaccines will be so useful then other than her story about how there's ACE2 receptor everywhere so if you protect your internal organs

58:06.000 --> 58:35.000
then you protect yourself from serious disease but I think that's not how this works but that's the biology that she's laying down and it's fairly congruent so far which is nice and it became congruent right there when she said the real immunology of intramuscular injection any injection intramuscularly with a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

58:36.000 --> 58:47.000
and she basically admitted why they'll end up knowing from the AstraZeneca study whether or not people are infected in asymptomatic because they looked for it whereas Pfizer and Moderna did not look for it

58:47.000 --> 58:58.000
I'm not going to talk about this that's first point about the first dose seem to be better because it's a really intriguing scientific thing that I put in here because this is something that has interested some of the people who who are affiliated with with the group

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
and it's an interesting point that may be important for some other cancer treatment for example but we won't discuss it but I did just put it on because it was an interesting point

59:06.000 --> 59:21.000
okay so I'm going to go back now to the two vaccines that are approved in the US with emergency use authorization so they reduce the risk of symptomatic coded disease and as I said we don't know if they prevent asymptomatic infection so therefore we don't know if vaccinated people even if they're feeling totally fine can transmit the virus

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
so I just wanted to put up the details actually aren't important but in case you were wondering they're both approximately

59:27.000 --> 59:39.000
it's really important to understand that asymptomatic spread is a super lame mythology that really it grows inside of people's heads like a little like a little weed

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
and it can fill the void of any imagination and make the virus much much much much more real than it can be

59:47.000 --> 01:00:06.000
asymptomatic spread is more RNA asymptomatic spread is more RNA from that puddle than we detected do you see why it's so ridiculous not only was this RNA able to go around the world and we could track it everywhere

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:15.000
but there are hundreds and thousands of other people that we didn't track it in because they didn't have symptoms but it still went through them

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:31.000
that is spectacularly compounding on an already very bad biological idea that a puddle of RNA in China can turn into a puddle of RNA in every corner of the earth

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
now that puddle of RNA extends to people that don't even have symptoms and so it's potentially every everywhere

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and that's the magic of this illusion that's the magic of the enchantment that she just lays down here

01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:00.000
not yet known if it prevents asymptomatic spread is a semantic enchantment which makes you accept that there is asymptomatic spread we just don't know if the vaccines can prevent it

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:12.000
it's very akin to if you accept the mystery you accept the monsters if you accept their emergency then you accept their monsters and one of their monsters is asymptomatic

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:21.000
or asymptomatic infection here we go but therefore we don't know if vaccinated people even if they're feeling totally fine can transmit the virus

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:31.000
so I just wanted to put up the details actually aren't important but in case you were wondering they're both approximately 95% effective and after the second dose although they looked at different time points

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000
and the important thing is although they're both mRNA they actually are different and so I'm going to talk about whether you can mix a match later but just to point out they did their studies differently

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000
now what's really important is they tried to both of them get enough people who were older and enough people from different racial and ethnic groups because it wouldn't have been useful if they said or texting were great in people under 55 if the target population

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:03.000
includes the people who are most seriously affected and that includes older people or if they'd only done it in white people because this disease has disproportionately not only affected but has disproportionately killed people of color

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:13.000
so what was important was that they did do a really good job of looking at different racial and ethnic groups the Moderna vaccine looked like it was slightly less effective than people over 65 but the reason they couldn't tell

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and they don't they don't say don't use it in older is because there were just so few people that got sick in both groups in the placebo and in the infected group that while it clearly was effective and it definitely was effective in preventing

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:38.000
you know very very serious disease and death they just can't make a strong a statement as as the Pfizer group but in fact it still is something that should be given to older people because it still has I mean most vaccines like the flu vaccine on a yearly basis usually

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000
is around 50% effective and sometimes 30% effective especially in older people but it's still worth getting the flu vaccine so getting this high degree of efficacy was really astonishing

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:57.000
okay so people wonder are they safe well there's no serious long term effects that have been associated with it and and it's just the usual adverse events that have been seen so you know you get sore arm and things like that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and but it is important to know that the side effects sometimes are worse after the second dose so just be prepared for that when you have your second dose they haven't looked at people are pregnant or lactating but the animal studies have been fine and frankly the risk to the mother and the fetus is much greater from the disease so people need to talk to people

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:41.000
that's spectacular there been a couple other adverse events but basically the bottom line they don't think that the bill did you hear that people need to talk to their own physicians but there's no contraindication to getting there from the disease but the animals just be prepared for that when you have your second dose they haven't looked at people are pregnant or lactating but the animal studies have been fine and frankly the risk to the mother and the fetus is much greater from the disease so people need to talk to their own physicians

01:03:41.000 --> 01:04:04.000
the risk to the mother and fetus is much greater from the disease than it is from the vaccination that's that's really rich there is a dividing fetus inside of a mama and this before the pandemic was the most sacred time in any humans life

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and it was a time that was so sacred that you just basically step away don't mess with it you don't put any lotions on you don't eat any raw fish you don't drink coffee or wine you don't smoke you don't you just take care of yourself you eat right you don't put makeup on anymore

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and yet it's just okay to intramuscularly inject a lipid nanoparticle that we have no idea where it's going to go we can't keep it anywhere about 70% of it's eventually going to end up in the liver

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:56.000
and express a foreign protein in the tissues that take it up no big deal if it should happen to cross the placental barrier and go into the very rapidly dividing fetus no big deal

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:22.000
the risk is much lower than the virus that comes from the outside right the virus comes from the outside and has to get through your immune system that includes epithelial cells and mucus and non specific antibodies for

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:40.000
nanoselectans and this kind of thing it's all these things are just bypassed with an intramuscular injection of a transfection agent and that's fine the risk is much lower even though we haven't tested it on people who are pregnant or lactating the risk is much lower

01:05:41.000 --> 01:06:00.000
what a statement to make in January of 2021 while everybody's confused and terrified that's what she said my my review on the website was already ready to go in January of 2021 pause the transfections five reasons why

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:20.000
and then those reasons slowly became mainstream ideas until now when everybody's saying them and I'm not saying them anymore I've come to realize that those were all part of a elaborate Scooby-Doo hoax but I knew them very well and I figured out how the biology lined up

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:38.000
already in January of 2021 and I had it published already ready to go all about enrichment all about non sterilizing immunity all about transfection and auto immunity and all about why we should pause it and definitely not do it in healthy humans

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:56.000
maybe an old people is what I thought back then and now we're almost in 2024 and all of those ideas are now becoming mainstream people are briefing Congress about how the variants are a result of the imperfect vaccine

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and I had written it up with 66 citations from the primary literature in 2021 and it's still on my website now under the link review

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
transfections are not immunization is the title of it like

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:43.000
there's no contraindication to getting there there've been a couple other adverse events but basically the bottom line for this is that they don't think that the bells palsy instances that they've seen they've only seen four in each of the trials was greater than what normally happens out of 30,000 to 40,000 people

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:58.000
everybody's heard a lot about these anaphylactic reactions and they have a hypothesis of why that's occurring but nevertheless this still is a rare event and the disease is much worse they think it might be caused by this part of this lipid nanoparticle this component called polyethylene glycol the thing that's a little weird

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:07.000
about it is it turns out polyethylene glycols in a lot of things that we all use toothpaste it's in laxatives it's in many many drugs so if you happen to know that you're allergic to it then you should wait and get a different

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:18.000
so what does it mean to be allergic to it does that mean you have IgE antibodies to it or you have IgG antibodies to it I don't know the answer to that question I'm asking all my smart viewers if they know

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:36.000
but I do believe an allergy to peg would mean that you produce antibodies of some type to it you have some maladaptive immune memory to peg maybe you're a vapor and you have a immune allergy and allergy to peg I don't know really how this works

01:08:37.000 --> 01:09:02.000
but but the main thing is just be alert peg is also in Miralax the the laxatives that they give to a lot of kids and they actually give this laxative to an awful lot of autistic kids and there are a lawful lot there's actually an 80,000 member Facebook group of parents that have had kids have acute psychotic episodes after using Miralax for about a week

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:14.000
basically what Miralax does is it completely dehydrates your gut in order to clear a constipation and in dehydrating your gut it actually completely kills your microbiome

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and it turns out that when you do that to a child they often have a psychotic episode isn't that weird and then what the crazy part is is that their normal digestion doesn't come back necessarily

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:39.000
wow weird huh ladies and gentlemen we are in big trouble because our health care system is out of control

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and usually they ask people to stay around for 15 minutes after they're immunized because this is the only out of all of the components that they think might be causing it

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
okay so this is what the CDC guidelines are if you're not so if you're specifically allergic to any of those components then don't get an RNA vaccine get a different one when they come out

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
but if you have other allergies such as food allergies you know better or other things they say CDC says get vaccinated

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
if you have allergies to other vaccine the CDC says discuss with your physician but in fact most people have allergies to things like eggs in some of the flu vaccines

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
so that really shouldn't be a problem but that's what they say is discuss with your physician

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:26.000
so here's how I'm going to go through some of these questions now and then we can answer other ones if I haven't covered them all can you get COVID from the vaccine no because the vaccines don't deliver a live SARS coronavirus in fact the mRNA vaccines only make this one spike protein

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000
remember can the vaccines change my genes no remember when this was such a big deal like that was such a sales pitch

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000
this is like an idiot thing oh I understand that so I get it

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:51.000
this is supposed to make you think you understand it so can I get COVID-19 from the vaccine no why and because it only makes the spike protein

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:05.000
so that makes logical sense to the average carpenter it makes sense to the average teacher that's fine I teach poetry you know it's fine I'm an art teacher that's great that makes sense

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:18.000
but in there there's no nuance that's just dumb simple right and the same thing does the vaccine change my genes that's just dumb simple no it doesn't but we can give it to pregnant women

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:29.000
we can give a transfection or transformation agent to pregnant women that well doesn't matter because there's no cells really dividing in a oh oh oh okay

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:58.000
so that's a whole other story does it change your genes can also be a very disingenuous like an Obi-Wan Kenobi trick so when Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke Skywalker that Darth Vader was some bad guy and he didn't tell him that he was his father when they later cleared it up when Obi-Wan's ghost finally told the truth he said yeah well he wasn't he wasn't

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:27.000
he killed your father from a certain point of view and so Darth went Darth Vader became real then his father died and so what he told him was true from a certain point of view and from a certain point of view can the vaccines change my genes no they won't change your eggs no they won't change your sperm so then they won't change your genes that's what she would say and so from a certain point of view maybe it's true from a certain point of view if

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:44.000
there's no DNA contamination sure that's true from a certain point of view if the RNA is done right that's true if it's from a certain point of view if the LNP stays in your muscle of course it's not going to change your genes there's no division in there

01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:06.000
but these things are true from a certain point of view and they're dumb simple presented here in January 2021 in order to convince people that it's not a matter of choice that you have to feel obligated to take one of these things and it would be silly for you not to

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and so then they steer the debate into this very controlled spectrum which is about which one should you do what are the pros and cons of each one and now she's going to introduce you to the idea that you may just need one of these every year

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:37.000
and the reason for that is that this is a one-way street RNA DNA goes to RNA RNA goes to protein it doesn't go backwards the only time it goes backwards is in certain viruses like HIV where in fact the virus provides a specific enzyme that goes the other direction

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:53.000
but even then so you said well what about people who are HIV infected could they you know have it go backwards the thing is that the RNA has to have a particular structure on its ends and so the HIV RNA has that particular structure for its RNA but the mRNA that's being put in in the vaccine does not so it just can't it just doesn't

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:03.000
have this structure moreover what I'm showing here is that the usual mechanism is you have DNA inside your nucleus and then it gets turned into RNA mRNA which then goes out into the cytoplasm

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:15.000
so when you get an mRNA vaccine the mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and there's actually no mechanism to get mRNA backwards into the nucleus but probably the biggest reason why this won't happen is the mRNA is so unstable that it actually breaks down very quickly

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I mean this is why the Pfizer vaccine you know the RNA is so unstable here she is again RNA is unstable and I'm feeling it now she just said Pfizer so I'm feeling it she's going to say something about temperature which is going to be the dumbest thing ever right because remember it's not temperature

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:47.000
it's not physical shaking of the bottle it's actually enzymatic degradation that you need to worry about with RNA because there are enzymes all around the natural world that are designed to degrade RNA

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:57.000
it has to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius and once the files are open they have to be used right away much less once they're in your body at 98 degrees in Oferonite it really breaks down quickly

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Wow so just at your body temperature the RNA is spontaneously falling apart what a weak ass therapeutic right what a joke how does that jive with what you understand about the RNA now how spectacular is that

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
it seems pretty harmless to me if it can float around only for a few hours in my body how much arm could it really do

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Wow I mean just wow think about that

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Do I need both doses yes now everybody says and there's been a big debate of well after the first dose you get a little bit of protection but the reality is you really need that boost to get it higher and this is really important as I can explain when I tell you about the new strains because the higher your neutralizing antibody titers are the more protection for you

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:52.000
and also the more you will shut down virus replicating and therefore there will be fewer mutant viruses so how is you how are you stopping virus replication with antibodies in circulation

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I don't really understand how that works do the antibodies bind to the epithelial cells of the lungs from the inside and then label them for cytotoxic T cell elimination

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:16.000
or do they somehow activate the internal zinc finger proteins that degrade the viral proteins like what do those antibodies do to help reduce viral load and viral spread

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I don't know what she's talking about I don't know why she would say this because out of one side of her mouth she says that these things don't do anything to help you with a respiratory disease because they don't cross your gut they don't cross your lungs

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:42.000
so they can't get into the mucosal there there's no way for them then what how do they stop the virus from replicating in that and defeat epithelial cells how does that work

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I don't think she really understands that she's contradicting herself and she tells this story to try and convince people that this is the debate they should be having these are the questions they should be asking

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
and these people are confused and not sophisticated enough to see the contradiction or to hear it

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.000
right so I mentioned already the J&J vaccine is probably going to be a one dose vaccine but it still takes time

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I want to show you data from the Pfizer because this is what people are looking at so they're saying oh see we have oops sorry keep trying to make my arrow come up and then it doesn't

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000
so so they're saying look the the protection just keeps going up and up after the days after dose one but what you have to notice is there's a second dose given right here

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:31.000
and so who knows what this protection level sorry the protection is this one which people don't keep getting disease versus these are the number of cases for the people who got placebo but this protection only increases

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:40.000
because these people have had the second dose if they hadn't had the second dose we don't know what the red curve would look like so that's why you can't assume that one dose is enough

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:51.000
remembering of course that they're doing that 14 day window so between the first dose and the second dose and then 14 days later they're still unvaccinated

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:03.000
and they were shifting those people over right so there is no that's not a good graph that was never a good graph and they were just a silly thing

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:22.000
that was one of the most that was one of the most egregiously overused graphs from the New England Journal of Medicine in in recent memory this one was shown by so many people so many times has evidence for

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:31.000
you know it had to be explained away just extraordinary the red curve would look like so that's why you can't assume that one dose is enough

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:42.000
but then people have asked okay what happens if like I can't make it on time to get my my second shot and because it's three weeks between first and second for Pfizer and four weeks for Moderna well they want it to be as close as possible

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:50.000
because that's how they were tested but the CDC says that a delay up to six weeks can is okay if you get you know if there's some delay that happens

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
and then the question is come can I mix and match and they say well try to get the same one but if you don't know what you got or the first one isn't available then it's okay in exceptional

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:07.000
situation so they don't recommend mixing and matching which is kind of the approach the UK is said oh it doesn't matter but it's probably they feel comfortable and if it's probably okay

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:17.000
okay so here then the big question how long will any protection last people don't really know because protection from getting the disease you know people don't know whether you get protected against second disease or for how long

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:27.000
but there have been a few studies not very many but a few that have looked on looked at how long do people's antibodies last and what about their lymphocytes how long can they keep making antibody even if you don't have circulating antibody

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and so not enough times it allows to really know because the vaccines really only started the trial started in in the summer and really only people got their second doses in the fall so we actually just don't know but

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:46.000
it also one thing is now because the people who got the placebo's in the studies are now going to get the vaccine we're not going to actually have the usual two year data to really be able to follow up but

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:54.000
it looks like by studying lymphocytes and antibody levels it is probably months to years that to a year sorry that are cited as duration that's what the Moderna group just published is they think it's at least a year

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.000
so we might need to have annual vaccines just as we do for influenza just to boost the response what we don't know though is that different vaccines may have different

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
durations of immunity or different efficacy in some populations even older people or people of different racial backgrounds but at least for now you know the thought is that

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:20.000
at least it will be months maybe a year maybe more probably the bigger issue and the bigger reason why we don't worry about it as much is that the sides having antibodies which is what all of this response

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:29.000
that people have been looking at is we also know that you get T cell responses both helper T cells that help the antibody response and cytolytic T cells that kill cells that are infected by the virus and so

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:40.000
at least these technologies that are at the forefront also seem to induce cytolytic T cells and so we don't yet know how much protection that we'll offer but it does mean we probably have another arm of immunity that's contributing

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000
to really big questions that have arisen because there's these new strains of virus so what are the new strains there are kind of

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:59.000
you know what I actually I forgot to take out that slide because I split up this slide so at any rate there's actually five different strains that have really made the news the first one was one called D614 G was a single mutation

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:09.000
and it looks like it infects more easily than the original one and maybe why it became the predominant strain but it didn't really seem to affect anything so people didn't worry about it as much except that it spread the infection more

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
more worrisome or the UK mutation which just this past week or so they've announced they think not only is it more infectious but maybe 30% more deadly.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's complicated there's many parts of the mutation. There's a California variant that is shown up in LA area they think it might be behind a California surge because they think it makes the infected cells produce more virus.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:38.000
The one that's really worrisome though, even though the UK ones more deadly is the South African variant and then there's a Brazil variant which has now been found in one person in the US that's related to the South African variant although probably a rose separately.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Now I want to point out that the US has a horrible sequence ratio of only 0.3% of viruses. The UK is probably doing about 10%. And so, you know, this is something that is really a shame that we don't have better testing for diagnostics and we don't have more sequencing.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Sorry, I messed up goofed up on I did this so let's go back now to this this port part here that this is my key point here is that although it looks like the existing vaccines probably protect against all these strains.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It turns out that even though the Moderna says well our level of neutralizing antibody is still adequate for protection, but it turns out it is six times lower against the African strain.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
So it will still probably work, but there's not as much wiggle room for the protection.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And booster third dose raise the time.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And I'm also developing a modified vaccine that specifically is directed against the South African variant. Now what does that mean for you and me what that means is that we all need to do everything we can to make sure the virus doesn't spread, because not only will if these spread.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:45.000
It's, it will be potentially disastrous as before people get vaccinated, but it means that that the virus can continue to mutate and new scarier strains can arise. And so, you know, we need to roll out the vaccine as quickly as possible since they are effective right now.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And we want to make sure as many people shut down producing virus as quickly as possible. So in January of 2021 they were already seeding the narrative that of course, that of course, cared funding bullshit already started to seed in the background that I had already started to

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
do in the background.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:19.000
That this imperfect vaccine against a single protein was going to force the virus to change at that protein and going to mutate away and everybody that got the vaccine was going to be focused on that protein and be completely vulnerable to new variants.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I was pushing that story in 2020 and 2021 I wrote a review about it.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And in January of 2021 it was ready to go it didn't get published tell me but that's another story.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And in that review is exactly this story that she's talking about right now that that is explained even better but in a bad way that we shouldn't be transfecting people because even if it works like you plan it to work it's going to go south.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Assuming that the virus behaves as you say it does.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.000
That was when I was still keep in mind this is where we're going here.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:13.000
That was when I was still convinced or rather not aware of how attributes of patterned integrity were being applied to the idea of a virus.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:24.000
People biologists thought they understood this because they understood these biological principles that can be applied to patterned integrity.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And they applied them to viruses because they were told to they were sold at that's good that that's is the illusion of consensus of virology is that that viruses are basically living things they're obligate pathogens that's

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:48.000
already bad language for an RNA molecule coded in a lipoprotein you shouldn't call it that.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It's not engaged in any form of homeostasis.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000
It's not engaged in any form of energetic consumption.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000
At best it's a signal. At best it's a packet of information.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But it is not a pattern integrity.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And yet here we are talking about it as a pattern integrity attributing vert attributing behavior that is only possible with a pattern integrity to a virus and claiming that it has the fidelity to go all around the world and that we can track these

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:36.000
these single mutations and that these single mutations are also preserved because they're so good.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And somehow we can.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:49.000
We have really believed that we have been led to believe this by this illusion of consensus that started already way way way earlier than the pandemic.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And illusion of consensus about pandemic potential in nature and in laboratories.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And that pandemic potential is the mythology because this can only exist in a world where that potential has already been accepted.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But Peter Dasek's job was on 60 minutes already years ago.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
That's with the role of the SARS virus already 20 years ago.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.000
That was the role of the mayor's virus already 20 or 12 years ago.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:35.000
To see the narrative of pandemic potential that it lurks in bad caves and in viral laboratories around the world.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Once the mythology was seated to their satisfaction or once the the necessity to capitalize on this mythology.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Was came upon us then then they've executed their plan.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000
They pulled the emergency lever all the people that are naive went along with it all the people that are in on it definitely stuck to their lies.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And here we are.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And it started back then about lies about what you should worry about with the shot.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Should you take the one shot the identity virus.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Maybe you want to do two shots maybe that won't fit into your schedule.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:25.000
You won't be having a CVS you'll have to have the J&J you get the J&J earlier.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
We also need to do everything we can to make sure that we just don't let the virus increase because then it will just mutate more.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Some questions I don't know whether any of you have already had COVID but the question should I get the vaccine.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000
If you were treated with monoclonal antibodies you should wait 90 days because those monoclonal antibodies will stop up all of the antigen made by the vaccine and so the vaccine just won't do any good.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
If you were sick it's recommended you still get the vaccine because some people don't make antibodies after infection and it isn't known how long they mean response last after infection.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And then some people have gotten COVID twice. And so you really want the vaccine if possible.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Okay, so this is really the most important part for that I wonder if that's true I wonder if you still get the vaccine antigen made by treated with monoclonal antibodies you should wait 90 days because I wonder if you were treated with monoclonal antibodies what would happen.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I don't know that those antibodies would just mop up all the spike protein and then negate the effects of the transfection I think it's possible that if you had monoclonal antibodies and you got transfected you'd clot out.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:33.000
So you have an immune response to the transfected cells which would be devastatingly cytotoxic.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Your entire endothelial cells that get transfected would be immediately destroyed because those antibodies would land on there the neutrophils would see them the neutrophils would destroy them you'd have, you know,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:01.000
the last days release he got all this fibrinogen getting broken down or is it fibrin getting broken down into fibrinogen or the vice versa and then those little micro clots start and the next thing you know you're where you where you are anyway after two shots.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I think she's being very disingenuous there by saying that those monoclonal antibodies will mop up all the spike protein and negate it.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
That's pretty funny.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
We'll stop up all of the antigen made by the vaccine.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
No they won't.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But if you were sick.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
No they won't.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Because some people don't make antibodies after infection and it isn't known how long they mean response last after infection.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And then some people have gotten COVID twice.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And so you really want the vaccine if possible.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Okay, so this is really the most important part that I think of is what's next.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
After any immunize can I not wear a mask.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Well, we've talked about this that some people still got infected with the vaccine.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It's about 100% effective. It's 95% and we don't know how long it's 95% effective maybe three months out or four months out it drops down to 70% or 60%.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
We just don't know.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000
The other reason is because as I said you still might be infected and just transmitting virus about you still could be affecting other people so yes you still need to do everything.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And then so they reversed it completely you know you're you could be sick all the time and not know it that that part of the narrative was so important and it's important to realize that so many people still believe that crap.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So many people have been misled to believe that crap.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
That they should test and if they test positive and they have some symptoms they better isolate because COVID is special.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:29.000
It's more special than a dentaviruses and rhinoviruses and RSV viruses and norovirus it's more special than all of them because it has its own tests.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And when those tests come out positive you must respect the test.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000
It's extraordinary what they did to us ladies and gentlemen because more than half of the planet is still fully under this spell.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000
They are actively offering for free tests to every household still.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
To protect yourself during the holidays.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
The protection against the new strains may not be quite as good even though it will protect.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So we all just need to make sure there's less fiber circulating.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
There's one other point which is that if people see you not wearing masks they're less likely to wear masks.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And so this is part of the sort of caring for others in our whole community.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Can I socialize with other people if I had a naked.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:16.000
You are being coerced we were coerced into being a participant in the illusion of consensus.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
We were coerced.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Other people won't believe our mythology if you don't perform.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
That's what she just said.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Other people won't believe our mythology if you don't perform the masking thing.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And we didn't understand it then.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
So many of us didn't understand it then.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So many of us didn't have principles then.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And so many of us understood that it was wrong but didn't know how to react.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:55.000
But lots and lots and lots of people knew exactly it was wrong and they reacted exactly like they were told.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
People with podcasts reacted exactly like they were told.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.000
And they wore masks on their podcast and bandanas around their neck.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And they told stories about the nine months that they haven't seen their families.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And they waxed intellectual about all the ways that the government was hiding there and what they knew about the novel nasty.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Maybe it was a lab leak.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Holy man ladies and gentlemen once you see it for what it is we are about to enter 2024 there is no excuse anymore.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:41.000
For not having the due diligence to sit down on your butt and get on the internet and research this history yourself.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
By just watching videos.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
That's all you got to do the time machine is right there in your lap.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
It's right there in your hand.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Go in the time machine and find the stories that these people told.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Find the recitation of the mythology.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Find these would be priests and acolytes.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And listen to them profess their faith in a novel virus that killed millions of people that millions of more can be saved from.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
If you would just shut up and wear your mask.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:29.000
And who a year from now are going to be believing with wholehearted goodness that they are sure that this must have come from a laboratory which explains the nightmare that we went through in 2020.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000
What a wonderful theater they have pulled upon us ladies and gentlemen what a wonderful theater.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I have seen the

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
testing test can I visit people.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000
My feeling is above for all of these things because people are asymptomatic the test are notoriously inaccurate the results come back really slowly you should still for now and with the levels that we have assumed that you and everyone else is infected if you want to socialize.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.280
And what's interesting is that they, and I apologize

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.680
because I actually have a talk at 10

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.000
with a group of Italian physicians,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.200
but we should have plenty of time

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.760
because to answer all the questions,

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.720
that's why you heard the alarm.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.600
What's interesting is once the vaccine was introduced,

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.840
you know, this essentially went down to zero,

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.480
except for now people who weren't getting immunized

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.040
are still getting it, which is because it's still present

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:15.880
in the world.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.360
What's interesting though is that the rate started to fall

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.840
before the vaccine was introduced,

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.480
and that's because people didn't know exactly

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.320
how it was transmitted, but they started socially distancing.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.760
They started not, you know, hanging out in place.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.360
So wait, are you telling me that when they didn't know

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.520
that it was oral fecal,

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.560
like you had to get other people's poop in your mouth?

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560
When they didn't know that,

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.120
then they were less careful about swimming pools

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.080
and washing their hands and sanitation

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.480
and using chlorine and water and stuff.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.040
And then after they figured that out,

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:51.040
like stuff changed and then the polio virus disease thing,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.320
pathogen went away, isn't that weird?

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.240
What else went away?

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.960
Was there some use of DDT that was changed

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.840
around this time as well?

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.920
It's just so convenient, isn't it?

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.880
Isn't it just so convenient?

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.400
I just think it's spectacular that she ends her

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.640
one hour sales pitch on all these new genetic therapies,

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.880
all these new test products.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.760
She goes back to plug in the original OG,

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.720
greatest story mankind's ever told.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.160
The greatest invention of all time,

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.520
besides the airplane, the nuclear bomb,

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.320
and the wheel is the polio vaccine.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.960
This is where they thought they might get it.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.160
Turns out it's fecal oral root transfer.

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160
So it was a lot of little kids,

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.000
and that's how they would get it.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:45.960
But then this was actually my,

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.680
I think most important slide which is that,

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.760
so you saw that that was in the 60s and late 50s

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.480
that had already started falling in the United States.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.160
But look at the rest of the world.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.280
It wasn't until 30 years later, 40 years later,

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.240
that the incidence of polio started falling.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.280
So we just can't let this happen again,

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.800
that the rich countries,

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:04.200
or the rich people in rich countries are protected,

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:06.640
and poorer people, or people who are at more at risk,

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.480
such as-

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.920
Do you remember this story about how poor people

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:10.760
were at more risk,

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.720
so we really had to get these vaccines

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.800
all over the world to these poor suffering individuals?

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.840
Now recall that Denny Rancor shows

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.680
that all the major casualty events

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.320
actually occurred in poor people,

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.480
in poor counties,

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.080
correlated with income.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.320
Mental illness too.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.680
You know, the vulnerable,

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.360
the people who go into the hospital

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.560
and just have to kind of accept whatever they're given.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.120
You know those people,

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.960
that's who COVID killed,

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:45.880
through protocols and lies,

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.320
financial incentives driving people to death.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.280
We definitely need affordable access

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.080
to vaccines worldwide when they are available,

01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.720
not 30 years later, right?

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.920
Rush them out, baby,

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.160
five billion doses, here we come.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.800
That's where this video is.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.600
Five billion doses, here we come,

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.840
they just rolled them out.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.080
People of color in the US

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.640
don't get access to the vaccine.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.000
So, and it's not just about humanitarian reasons,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.960
which all of you are fully into,

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.040
but it's frankly even just part of self-preservation

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.120
because we're a global village now.

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:21.960
It just takes one person,

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.440
the one guy who came back from Brazil

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.520
who brought the new virus strength to Minnesota.

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.320
And we've seen this time and time again

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.120
with influenza with SARS-1,

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.600
people get on airplanes and this is what happened,

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.600
this is the virus.

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.480
It's a global village.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.280
She froze for a second here.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.360
I think I'm gonna wrap it up at that one.

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.680
The question and answer is not very exciting.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.400
She doesn't admit anything like Peter Cullis has

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.440
for us so many times.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.040
I just wanna say one more time or remind you

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:55.840
that there are a couple different programs

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:59.280
that videos that Mark Gulak has made.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.040
One of them is on Housatonic Live 2

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.960
and it is a big shot AIDS vaccine video

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:08.280
with Margaret Liu and her bio.

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.080
And then there's another one that I believe

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.760
is on Housatonic 3.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.760
And that one is a thing that she does on CSPAN,

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.280
it looks like.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.120
I'm not really sure what it is,

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.480
I haven't watched it yet.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.960
But it's like 43 minutes long

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.560
so it's probably pretty interesting as well.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.280
You can see how long she's been in this game.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.240
She did mention that she was working on DNA vaccines

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.280
before the RNA vaccines.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.920
And she did say that their work on DNA vaccines

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.200
paved the way safety-wise for the rollout

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.560
of the RNA to be so quick.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.600
I would say that that's a little hand-waving

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.920
because I don't think DNA became very safe.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.440
So to say that DNA's work made it possible for RNA,

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.040
I guess it just made it easy for them to say

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.520
that RNA is different than DNA, I don't know.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.000
Anyway, shout out to Mark for already having been on this

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.960
and already put in a lot of work with also a page

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.520
which I guess I could throw up here really quick.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.440
Just flash this over here.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.040
If you go to this page here,

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.840
you can see her and that link

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.440
and then all the stuff that Mark has archived about her.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.040
It's always really impressive to see the kinds of things

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.840
that he's able to archive on people.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:25.160
And again, remember that this archive is really A to Z.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.840
So you can go all through this and follow

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.240
and look at all the work that Mark has done

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.560
with regard to archiving all of these humanoids.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.720
I guess you would go here to research

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.600
and then you get these ABCs here

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.360
and so then you can do anything you want.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.720
You can go like S and then all these people are S, right?

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.160
And you can just find out if any of these people ring a bell.

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.120
I mean, you see the kinds of work that this guy has put in

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:58.480
to kind of cataloging the recent American history

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.840
that we are all victims of or experiencing

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.240
or living through.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.840
I think you'll see why Mark and his work

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:09.840
is some of the stuff that I'm most happy with.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.800
I don't really have a lot of other places

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:13.480
to look for this kind of information

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.400
and so it's really nice to have it all in one place.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:20.040
So again, shout out to the Mark Housatonic,

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.880
just a great friend and a great colleague in this fight.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.560
So yeah, that's Mark is right there.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:31.320
This is a map of people and I think the best way

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.120
to think about how this map really works

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.880
is to think about the novel virus

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.240
and the fact that none of these people really question it.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.720
Think about the millions of people

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.200
that were killed by the virus

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.160
that these people keep repeating

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.480
and keep thinking about the idea that gain of function

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.560
might be a mythology

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.520
and none of these people seem to be aware of it.

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.760
So that's really the amazing thing.

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.600
It's a game of chess that's being played all around the world

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.160
and these people are the players.

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:56.320
They all know it's a rigged game

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.960
and they're rigging it against us.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.840
They're all pretending to stop and start the train.

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:01.720
That's what this is.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.560
That's what this agreement not to do the correct math,

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.200
the agreement to blame all excess deaths on the virus

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.920
instead of trying to do the correct math

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.480
that people like Jessica Hockett

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:15.040
and the Jonathan Engler and Nick Hudson

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.960
and Panda are trying to do

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.120
where we look at what they did with protocols

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.080
and we look at what they did with antibiotics

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.880
and we look at what they didn't do, what they added

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.760
and we see that there's really no room

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:28.200
for a particularly dangerous virus.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.240
There's no room for a new cause of death

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:33.640
because we've got all the deaths covered already.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.120
And so the latest addition to this

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.200
is to say that not all of the people

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.440
that were participating in this narrative

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.400
were necessarily on the same team

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.920
but they are all on a one side of the stage.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.760
I mean, you can imagine a scenario, right,

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.160
where you go to a play and all of the characters

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.040
that are all of the actors in the play,

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.680
all of the stage hands and the lighting crew,

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.960
they don't all go out to drink afterward.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.560
There might be two or three groups of friends in there

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.200
that get along well in terms of the production

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.440
and they can put on a fine show

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.120
but when everybody goes to the bar after the show,

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.640
some of them go one place and some of them go the other

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.640
and they used to date and so now they fight

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.280
and they're not really comfortable hanging out anymore.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.120
And so there's no doubt that the people

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.500
that are the ruling class of the earth,

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:34.300
the oligarchs, the bankers, the weaponized piles of money,

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:37.660
however they became large enough to be weaponized,

01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:41.700
Bill Gates, et cetera, Peter Thiel, et cetera.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.420
They don't all have to be on the same team

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:48.140
as long as they agree that it is to their collective advantage

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:53.220
to perform this, to sustain this act

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:56.980
that there is a natural phenomenon

01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:00.780
that also can have a synthetic component

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.580
and that bioweapons exist

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.540
and therefore all of these changes need to be made.

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:11.220
And as long as they all keep performing,

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:13.900
as long as they all stick to these various narratives

01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.220
and don't question the faith in a novel virus,

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.100
don't question the faith and gate of function

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.380
then this can go on in perpetuity.

01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:25.780
Most importantly, it can go on in perpetuity

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.700
for our children because the TV and social media

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.860
is repeating this over and over,

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:34.100
this consensus about a novel virus

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:35.380
that killed millions of people

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:37.420
that we had to lock down for,

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.060
this is the faith that's a lie.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.700
And we must teach our children the truth

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.460
or they themselves will have already accepted it

01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.420
and there's nothing we can do.

01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.220
We must teach them the truth

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.460
because they wanna invert our rights,

01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.180
our sovereignty into permissions

01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.540
because they want the data from our children.

01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.740
Please stop all transfections and humans.

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.820
They are trying to eliminate the control group

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:06.500
by any means necessary.

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.660
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.660
with the intent of augmenting the immune system

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.580
is dumb and transfection and healthy.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.700
Humans is criminally negligent

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.300
and viruses are in pattern integrity.

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:22.060
So like I said, December is gonna be a wonderful month.

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.860
We're gonna start teaching again,

01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.580
so we gotta keep these study halls going

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.940
because this is the way that we catch up and we learn

01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:32.780
and we keep playing the same song in a different way.

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:36.100
I'm a bit like a jazz concert with the same set list

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:38.740
but you can go to it over and over again.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.060
I hope you don't mind that for now.

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:43.060
Obviously the book comes out next week

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.620
so there's lots of things to capitalize on

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.860
in the coming weeks.

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:51.780
So get ready for a lot of new stuff, a lot of fun stuff.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.980
I'm just gonna keep on working every day

01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.060
so thanks for joining me.

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.340
I'll be here tomorrow.

01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:59.540
Same time, same channel, whatever time that is,

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.780
I don't know, but tomorrow night

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:03.500
I have early basketball practice

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:07.060
so chances are it's gonna be after 7.30.

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:09.420
It's not late basketball so after 7.30,

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.900
maybe 8.30, something like that.

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:13.020
Thanks very much for joining me.

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:17.660
This is the only member of the independent Bright Web.

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.100
If we call it interdisciplinary Bright Web,

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.660
we might be able to recruit Mark Hewson-Tonic

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:26.140
as he seems to like that a little better.

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.820
But independent, whatever it is,

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.700
it's giggled and biological.

01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:33.900
Thanks for joining me.

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:36.740
Definitely working safely.

01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.100
Goodnight guys.
