00:00.000 --> 00:06.980
Music.

00:06.980 --> 00:18.600
Music.

00:18.600 --> 00:26.160
Music.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.060
And they're able to run it for Trey, look at her drive.

00:30.060 --> 00:34.560
Gains are shoots, heads in!

00:34.560 --> 00:38.560
Despite a rear contest from Spencer Dunwoody.

00:38.560 --> 00:42.840
Young, back track, five to two, young.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.360
Let's it go!

00:44.360 --> 00:46.360
And heads!

00:46.360 --> 00:47.960
Whoo!

00:47.960 --> 00:51.460
Ice cold!

00:51.460 --> 00:54.720
11 point advantage, largest lead right now for the Hawks.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.720
Trey's left a long at the corner.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.720
Now it's a 14 point advantage.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.720
Yeah, and you can see Trey's just feeling good.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.720
Those look out against the Admiral.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.720
It's a little crossover.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.720
Young has his shot blocked on the foul on the magic.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
Yikes!

01:13.720 --> 01:17.720
59-45.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.720
Trey floats it home and gets it and won.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.720
25 and a good job.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.720
Sometimes if you pop a guy in the mouth, man,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.720
that wakes him up.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.720
Trey will get the contact and the bucket.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.720
Well, that's what you get when, and Brian, you know this.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.720
Trey escapes the double.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
Goes back at it.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
Still working.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
Still fighting.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
Get it!

01:41.720 --> 01:45.720
That's a little keep missing shot.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
Very young.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.720
Steps back over Williams.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
Take that!

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
Butter!

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
18 games.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.720
Now, we mentioned a couple of times double pressure.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.720
What a move, by the way.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.720
Body Trey Young, he has now 15.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.720
We mentioned how they got four seconds.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Three.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.720
Trey driving.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.720
And one.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.720
Donovan.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Ten seconds to go.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.720
Atlanta has a timeout where they use it now.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.720
Here's Young and a five.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Butter up and down.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.720
Atlanta takes a one point range.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.720
Trey.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.720
Steps back, connects, believe.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.720
At 12.1.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.720
Trey for three.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.720
Good game.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
Shot clock at eight.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.720
Good defense by Horford.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.720
Forcing Young back out on the perimeter.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.720
Sights and crayons gone.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Young in transition.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.720
Little in and out dribble through the foul.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.720
Count it.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.720
Trey Young in one.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.720
Here comes Trey Young.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
Trey 11 points in that first half.

02:43.720 --> 02:48.720
Dancing against Bob.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
Trey.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.720
Boy, he's working kissboard over.

02:52.720 --> 02:53.720
Come on.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
In the east.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.720
Here's Trey Young.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.720
Jumper Good, Stern.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.720
Isolation.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.720
Young.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.720
Step back for three.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.720
Bottoms.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.720
Shooters in the game and possession of the ball.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.720
For Atlanta.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.720
Trey Young, the floater.

03:10.720 --> 03:17.720
The floater.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.720
The floater.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.720
Got it.

03:21.720 --> 03:27.720
That's got a little pepper to it.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Hacers just led by 7.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.720
62.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.720
55 and Young.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.720
Young, the floater for the lead.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.720
Good job, Chad.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Trey Young once again.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
Prudgson had an open three.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.720
Neither guy could connect.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
Big time crossover.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
And bucket by Young.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
Fanny Pollan.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
You're in the first half.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.720
He's in the last night for the thunder.

03:51.720 --> 03:57.720
Young trying to shed lead to young.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.720
Young, a step back three over Bancero.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.720
Got it.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.720
That's his first three tonight.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.720
Boy, they went home.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
Off's looking for some life.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.720
Here's this game.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.720
Funny I talked to Domossa about his family.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.720
You know, we hear so much about our beat.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.720
Banched has ten points.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.720
Here in this opening quarter, Trey Young.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.720
Man, top shot.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.720
I think 60% of two games on averaging 23 big games.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.720
Trey scores again.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.720
Trey working that dribble.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.720
Trying to stay in front of him.

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
Back up three.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
Good.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
Trey Young.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.720
Hello.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.720
Trey with a floater.

04:41.720 --> 04:45.720
It's hard to shoot an air ball right back to the basket.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.720
Trey to the basket.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.720
The third quarter.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
Shooter trying to guard Trey Young.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.720
Floater again.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
Trey through the double.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
Scores it.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
Hi, Art.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
Botakawa.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.720
It's good ball movement.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.720
Trey will float it and hit it.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.720
Real life that, you know, there's other parts of scoring.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.720
Trey, Banches hits.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Big thing guy.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.720
And what he's doing is going straight to the rack.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.720
Trey drives the reverse.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.720
It's coming custom.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.720
Yeah, he's a left-handed guy, but he's chasing left-handed.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.720
Here you go.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.720
Get to the basket.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.720
Go.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.720
Go.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.720
Go.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
Go.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
Go.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
Go.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
Go.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Go.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
Go.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
Go.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
Go.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.720
Go.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
Go.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
Go.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
Go.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.720
Go.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.720
Go.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720

05:47.720 --> 05:48.720

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
Go.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
Go.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.720
Go.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.720
Go.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.720
Go.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.720
Go.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.720
Go.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.720
Go.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Go.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
Go.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.720
Go.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
Go.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
Go.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
Go.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
Go.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720

09:01.720 --> 09:08.720

09:08.720 --> 09:26.000
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.960
His name is J. J. Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD and I believe he has

09:32.960 --> 09:42.960
a Ph.D. and some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

10:02.960 --> 10:32.800
Good morning everybody.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.940
It's 10.15 in the morning, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

10:37.940 --> 10:38.940
Good to see you, Jeff.

10:38.940 --> 10:42.800
Good to see you, Daniel Pamela in the first three there.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.240
Annie, nice to see you.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.480
And Hittari Mama all the time in the chat.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
I will agree with you.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.840
I don't think that Trey is like the best NBA player of all time.

10:54.840 --> 11:01.440
I think Trey is the example of somebody who's absolutely normal doing an NBA level of basketball

11:01.440 --> 11:07.080
with a normal body, a normal gift.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
He's not 6'10".

11:08.080 --> 11:14.720
He can't jump out of the gym and he still competes with these giant people, these freaks

11:14.720 --> 11:15.720
of nature.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.520
That's what I like about Trey.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
Everybody doubted him.

11:18.520 --> 11:24.120
If he walked into a room you wouldn't even know he was an NBA player and the guy is

11:24.120 --> 11:33.880
a master and it's just wonderful to see human skill at that level, un, un, un, un augmented

11:33.880 --> 11:41.720
by, you know, freakish jeans or something like that because, you know, there are freakish

11:41.720 --> 11:47.000
jeans out there that are, I mean, LeBron James is not a normal biological specimen.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.480
If he was in the room next to me, he might even say that he might be of a different species

11:52.480 --> 11:54.880
like he's gigantic compared to me.

11:54.880 --> 12:00.160
There's a whole different skeleton, a whole different athletic ability, a whole different,

12:00.160 --> 12:04.960
he's got a photographic memory that I don't have for the physical things that he does.

12:04.960 --> 12:09.720
Like he can remember an entire game play by play.

12:09.720 --> 12:15.240
These people are all exceptional and what makes Trey young so exceptional is that he

12:15.240 --> 12:20.160
is minus all of these physical gifts.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.760
I'm sure he's fast.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.160
I'm sure he's faster than me or you.

12:24.160 --> 12:33.160
But the guy is not gifted like so many of these people in the NBA are and he still hangs

12:33.160 --> 12:34.160
with them.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.160
I just find it amazing.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.160
I find him really inspiring.

12:36.160 --> 12:42.160
My son's fired him really inspiring I think because of that same reason.

12:42.160 --> 12:46.160
But there is no question Luca is really cool too.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.160
I really like him a lot.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.520
I love his style.

12:51.520 --> 12:58.280
One of the hidden blessings of the pandemic has been the entry of basketball into my family's

12:58.280 --> 13:07.680
life after many many years of being something that I used to hide within.

13:07.680 --> 13:14.920
Basketball was something that gave me a lot of identity and foundation when I was young.

13:14.920 --> 13:21.920
And so it's been something that since my kids have taken it up my boys it's really

13:21.920 --> 13:29.860
been something that's really lit in a new fire in my life and I want to make gentle the

13:29.860 --> 13:32.200
life of this world.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.920
I want to be able to focus on coaching basketball.

13:35.920 --> 13:42.360
I want other people to focus on art and creating music and all of the things that humans are

13:42.360 --> 13:44.800
really meant to do.

13:44.800 --> 13:52.160
I want to be not to be cowered in our little houses afraid of the future.

13:52.160 --> 13:57.720
I want my kids to look forward to the future and right now I got to be really honest with

13:57.720 --> 14:02.480
you ladies and gentlemen my kids don't look forward to the future and so when I see this

14:02.480 --> 14:10.800
video right here and I think of myself as a father what kind of opportunities do I have

14:10.800 --> 14:15.560
to do this for my children if our if our schools are messed up what opportunities

14:15.560 --> 14:22.160
do I have to do this for my children if our tax and student loan and university systems

14:22.160 --> 14:23.160
are all ruined.

14:23.160 --> 14:28.120
What do I have a chance to do this for my son and for other kids as a teacher if we

14:28.120 --> 14:36.880
don't straighten our priorities out as beautiful as I find that image I feel like this image

14:36.880 --> 14:42.480
is much more important than our children are there at the bottom of that wave our

14:42.480 --> 14:49.840
college kids are at the bottom of that wave and we need to risk our lives to save them

14:49.840 --> 14:55.440
we need to risk our livelihoods to save them we need to risk everything to save them we

14:55.440 --> 15:01.480
need to tell the truth right now about these lies and we tell the truth by staying focused

15:01.480 --> 15:06.360
on the biology not taking the bait on television and social media and loving our neighbor not

15:06.360 --> 15:11.640
fighting with them not arguing with them not taking one side or the other but realizing

15:11.640 --> 15:18.280
that that that act of taking a side is exactly what they want you to do the only side to

15:18.280 --> 15:23.840
take is the side of the peasants the side of the blue collar people that work every day

15:23.840 --> 15:30.120
and that have worked every day and they want to fracture us and the only way to do it is

15:30.120 --> 15:36.080
to share this stream if you can I mean that's not the only way to do it there are lots of

15:36.080 --> 15:40.520
people fighting you just got to find them it's not as many as you think it's not the

15:40.520 --> 15:45.760
ones that have millions of subscribers it's not the ones that have had substacks or books

15:45.760 --> 15:53.200
about one topic you know like the bears or like ivermectin or or the lies my government

15:53.200 --> 15:59.920
told me these are all people that have been put in front of us in order to sustain this

16:00.000 --> 16:06.640
new world order mythology about a gain of function virus that escaped from a laboratory and now

16:06.640 --> 16:12.480
we're facing the consequences of it the paradigm is about to shift ladies and gentlemen as the

16:13.040 --> 16:18.320
as the masses start to wake up drop their own hands from their eyes throw their phone in the

16:18.320 --> 16:26.160
garbage delete some apps and stop sustaining the illusion by participating in it once you

16:26.160 --> 16:31.840
have the knowledge you can engage in non-compliance and that's what giga-home biological is all about

16:33.520 --> 16:38.400
helping to happen united non-compliance by learning the biology this is giga-home

16:38.400 --> 16:52.000
biological 29th of october 2024 so thanks for joining me

16:56.160 --> 17:13.840
that was supposed to be a long cut i apologize are still learning how to do this beginning here

17:14.960 --> 17:19.120
this is giga-home biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by

17:19.120 --> 17:24.960
a biologist and a basketball fan i started the video today a little early i'm going to try and

17:25.040 --> 17:30.080
do that a little early to make sure that i'm ready to go and that i push the button and i got to do

17:30.080 --> 17:35.280
it um even if i'm you know the slides don't quite come out right or something like that 10 10 in

17:35.280 --> 17:39.600
the morning during the week is going to be our new time that we're going to try and hit every day

17:40.240 --> 17:45.520
did i say october i meant april um i don't know what's going on it's it's early and i'm still

17:45.520 --> 17:50.880
finishing my second cup of coffee so maybe there's still some gears that need to get the oil um

17:50.960 --> 17:57.360
anyway i thought i'd start with tre again because of what i said earlier um for me he's been kind

17:57.360 --> 18:02.720
of an inspirational guy in the mba um there's a few interviews that if you dig them up you can

18:02.720 --> 18:10.400
really find a very humble um he's a professional it's crazy to think that someone as young as him

18:12.000 --> 18:18.720
entering the mba could be um to rise to such an occasion but he's a family man

18:19.360 --> 18:25.280
um he's a real nice guy and you know he's very humble because there's an interview that i saw

18:25.280 --> 18:29.600
with him that kind of inspired me to use him to start this show where he said that when he first

18:29.600 --> 18:36.080
got into the mba it was a real big adjustment because he's leading grown men you know that are 28 or

18:36.080 --> 18:42.880
30 years old they got kids this is their life and so the kind of pressure that he faced was not

18:42.960 --> 18:48.800
only pressure for his own game and for living up to the hype being a little tiny guy and

18:48.800 --> 18:55.280
way too skinny and everybody underestimating him but also meeting the challenge of being teammates

18:56.080 --> 19:03.840
with other men that are other professionals and it's crazy because sometimes we talk about these

19:03.840 --> 19:09.040
guys like they're you know you know obviously they make a lot of money but they're professionals

19:10.000 --> 19:15.440
and moving from one company to another or one branch to another one team to another

19:15.440 --> 19:19.600
they're professionals they're trying to get the most out of their body while their body can still

19:19.600 --> 19:25.200
give it to them knowing that once their body has been used up by this machine no one's gonna care

19:26.720 --> 19:31.840
nobody cares about michael jordan anymore nobody talks about him nobody you know it's a

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
when they're not making any money off of them anymore and trey as long as they can make money

19:38.000 --> 19:41.600
off of them of course they're going to hype him the moment that he fails the moment that he

19:41.600 --> 19:45.600
falls apart there's five other guys they're going to replace him with and they'll hype them up just

19:45.600 --> 19:56.480
as quickly and i just i think it's really important to see that we are in the midst of what is essentially

19:56.480 --> 20:05.600
a rigged game it's not about whose biology is the best whose jump shot is the best who's got the

20:05.680 --> 20:13.360
best explanation who's got the the nicest and succinct most reasonable explanation it's not

20:13.360 --> 20:18.720
going to be who's asking the right questions and how they ask them that's why jessica hockett

20:18.720 --> 20:23.360
asking good questions about new york city no matter how many good questions she asks she's

20:23.360 --> 20:31.440
never going to be in the starting lineup because it's not like the nba it's not a meritocracy where

20:31.440 --> 20:35.680
no matter who doubts you when you score the points you score the points and then the hype

20:35.680 --> 20:42.960
starts because they want to make money off of that it's not a an organic system where no matter who

20:42.960 --> 20:47.520
has the right answer it doesn't matter they're the ones who are going to rise they're the ones

20:47.520 --> 20:53.360
who are going to get on tucker they're the ones who are going to get the sub stack or or get the

20:53.360 --> 20:57.280
start the nonprofit it's not like that or the book deal

21:00.320 --> 21:06.960
and it's been made to seem like it's that it's made to seem like people are getting censored

21:06.960 --> 21:17.760
and despite censorship they're rising no that's not the way this works

21:18.160 --> 21:26.080
and so unlike the nba where treyong despite the doubt got the chance rose to the occasion

21:26.640 --> 21:30.960
has been fighting through the injuries fighting through all of the things that everybody was

21:30.960 --> 21:36.080
right about his body is gonna take more of a beating and not going to be able to handle it

21:36.080 --> 21:42.640
as well as somebody like LeBron James who may never actually push his body to its physical limit

21:43.440 --> 21:46.720
when playing basketball with other guys that are no bigger than him

21:48.400 --> 21:55.600
but I guarantee you when an average sized human being like treyong bumps against guys like

21:56.560 --> 22:03.360
LeBron James who are a couple sigma from average there's a different stress on his on his

22:04.000 --> 22:10.480
joints and I can guarantee you that when I come up against and when Jessica comes up against and

22:10.560 --> 22:17.040
when Mark comes up against somebody who is who has been financially successful and retired

22:17.040 --> 22:24.560
for 20 years somebody who has started and sold companies 10 or 15 years ago to places like Pfizer

22:24.560 --> 22:35.200
or or BioRAD or or applied BioSystems is going to be more resilient in a in a battle for for the

22:35.200 --> 22:41.360
truth than somebody who is renting their house somebody who has lost a son during the pandemic

22:41.360 --> 22:46.160
somebody who is dependent on the success of of a restaurant

22:50.320 --> 22:54.960
and that's what you're dealing with here the people who are telling the truth the people who

22:54.960 --> 23:01.760
have actually put it all on the line you're never going to hear from them because this is not a

23:01.840 --> 23:10.080
meritocracy this is not like the NBA and no matter how good we are despite all the odds that's what

23:10.080 --> 23:16.320
makes treyong so cool when you watch that video you see holy man that is really a little guy among

23:16.320 --> 23:22.320
very big people and he's doing well what he does well like what he he it's amazing

23:23.920 --> 23:30.160
and that's really what Jessica Hockett is that's what Mark Koolack is and that's humbly I submit that's

23:30.240 --> 23:39.440
what I am because without my teammates without my kids without my wife supporting us and risking

23:39.440 --> 23:45.520
it all and putting it all on the line for this this wouldn't happen this is not something that

23:45.520 --> 23:52.960
well you know we're we're we're pretty much okay because Jay sold like five patents while he was

23:52.960 --> 23:57.440
working for the University of Pittsburgh and so we got plenty of money in the bank and we own our

23:57.440 --> 24:03.520
house and we live on the on a vineyard are we we live at the at the foot of a national park or

24:03.520 --> 24:11.920
we live on the shore of of the Atlantic Ocean in in a compound or in a in a you know

24:13.280 --> 24:18.160
and so I don't care what my husband does in the basement you know he he rants and he goes crazy

24:18.160 --> 24:26.400
but you know it doesn't matter because we're okay and yet there are people on the internet

24:27.440 --> 24:32.960
who are in that position who have decided to attack people like Mark and people like myself

24:32.960 --> 24:39.520
and make fun of people like Jessica and people like Nick Hudson and and and Jonathan Engler

24:39.520 --> 24:47.040
they they they attack those people from a position of comfort from a position of well you could just

24:47.040 --> 24:53.600
mind your own business with your hundred thousand followers and your and your mansion and wherever

24:53.600 --> 24:59.840
it is you could just mind your own business but instead they've gone out of their way to slander

24:59.840 --> 25:05.920
us out of their way to misalign us and out of our out of their way to misrepresent our true motives

25:05.920 --> 25:10.720
which is just asking questions and wondering why these people that are so brilliant that they've

25:10.720 --> 25:15.840
been in front of the Senate multiple times haven't asked any of these questions seem to slip their

25:15.840 --> 25:24.400
mind every time they get a chance to get in front of a mic and that's what I find most

25:24.400 --> 25:30.480
frustrating about this if this was a meritocracy if this was about message if this was about being

25:30.480 --> 25:36.640
right or wrong or being able to admit you don't know then none of these people would be where they

25:36.640 --> 25:45.760
are none of them but they're all there and social media has created this illusion of consensus

25:45.920 --> 25:52.400
that they have actually usefully move the ball forward in some kind of dissident movement that

25:52.400 --> 25:59.440
opposes something what do they oppose what list of things do they actually oppose that's probably

25:59.440 --> 26:04.480
the best question that you could ask any of these people when you're in a meeting with them or you

26:04.480 --> 26:10.240
have the chance and their attention on social media what exactly do you think the problem is

26:11.040 --> 26:18.000
what exactly would you say we're doing wrong and how should we go because I'm pretty I'm pretty

26:18.000 --> 26:23.200
clear I think about what I think is wrong I think that there is an illusion of consensus about the

26:23.200 --> 26:28.560
effectiveness of the vaccine schedule particularly in America and I think it has become a criminal

26:28.560 --> 26:35.520
enterprise and I think that there are a lot of people who could have said it much more succinctly

26:35.600 --> 26:42.560
than they have for the last five or ten years and I'm starting to become very very curious as to

26:42.560 --> 26:50.880
why because after finally pulling my own head out in 2022 it's only taken me about two years to

26:50.880 --> 26:58.960
eclipse all of these previous messages and some of these you know supposedly leading voices that

26:58.960 --> 27:04.960
have been there for several years before the pandemic still aren't there and able to let's say

27:05.520 --> 27:12.000
succinctly elevate or pitch their stance the best they can say is health freedom

27:13.840 --> 27:15.840
the best they can say is free speech

27:19.120 --> 27:23.760
they never say strict liability they never say the prep act they never say transfection they

27:23.760 --> 27:30.640
never say RNA can't pandemic or RNA isn't a pattern integrity those aren't organisms

27:30.640 --> 27:37.280
you they don't say any of these things they instead accept them the novel virus the millions of people

27:37.280 --> 27:44.080
dead the imperfect but effective transfection cure and the fact that it was gained a function

27:44.080 --> 27:49.440
so it will come again the fact that mother nature has many more of these and they will come again

27:49.440 --> 27:57.760
this is all outside of us frightening fear bullshit stories that they pushed on our parents

27:57.760 --> 28:02.720
now they're pushing on us and they want us to push on our kids and the only way out is for

28:02.720 --> 28:07.120
each and every one of us to do the heavy lifting of learning enough of this biology

28:07.120 --> 28:12.560
so that we can't be bullshitted anymore that's a lot of work for some people

28:13.280 --> 28:21.760
but I do think that I and some others are are in a position where we can give a real 30,000

28:21.760 --> 28:28.000
foot view of that biology in a way that will allow people to pick and choose what they want

28:28.000 --> 28:34.560
to learn in more depth what they want to check in more depth with more review with more research

28:34.560 --> 28:40.720
on their own but everybody's going to learn need to learn to be a student again or none of us

28:40.800 --> 28:46.560
are going to be able to break out of this mythology that is that is really has a hold on us based on

28:46.560 --> 28:52.640
social media I mean the tv too but the tv is social media now and the tv reports social media

28:54.240 --> 28:58.400
and so intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

28:58.400 --> 29:07.840
immune system is dumb and no matter how many times people say that you know mr. couille is crazy

29:08.720 --> 29:12.880
you will notice that they never address this statement even though I'm telling you night

29:12.880 --> 29:16.880
after night after night after night and morning after morning that this is the most important

29:16.880 --> 29:21.760
message this is the most important message if there's anything I want anyone to take away

29:21.760 --> 29:26.400
from this if the college kid only came here for five minutes I want them to read that first

29:26.400 --> 29:31.600
statement and have it sink in and then had them go how in the world can he say such a broad

29:31.680 --> 29:39.280
generalized statement about immunology is that really possible that no one and not one m.d

29:40.400 --> 29:47.120
not one representative of the human genome project not one retired pharma exec ever and not

29:47.120 --> 29:53.920
as addressed this basic idea wouldn't that be the easiest way to bury me oh there's this thing

29:53.920 --> 29:58.400
that he opens up with every time and it's just the dumbest thing ever and I can tell you exactly

29:58.400 --> 30:02.080
why it's dumb you know why they don't say it because it ain't dumb

30:04.960 --> 30:10.880
because that statement right there is untouchable because this statement in red is absolutely

30:10.880 --> 30:16.800
untouchable they will not they will not touch it because someone like kevin mccernan

30:17.680 --> 30:23.120
who's who cut his teeth in the human genome project is very well aware that in the english

30:23.920 --> 30:30.240
specific to bench biology and bench molecular biology transfections a real word and it has a

30:30.240 --> 30:37.440
real definition which includes the technology that they have foisted on on the world

30:39.600 --> 30:46.160
and called it in fact in investigational vaccines he knows that Brett Weinstein knows that because

30:46.160 --> 30:53.440
I tried to convince him to start using the word in early 2021 already and for almost nine months

30:53.440 --> 31:00.800
on signal please just stop calling it vaccine did he stop no

31:05.440 --> 31:12.080
I tried every single person that I've ever talked to since about the end of 2020 stop calling at a

31:12.080 --> 31:18.240
vaccine just call it a transfection that's why I wrote the review in 2021 to at least have people

31:18.240 --> 31:24.880
understand that if you just called it a transfection you could really get wheels turning in people's

31:24.880 --> 31:31.120
mind that don't turn when you call it a vaccine how hard is it to understand that using the right

31:31.120 --> 31:38.880
words is important and what you need to hear if you haven't heard it is that I've talked to these

31:38.880 --> 31:46.400
people face to face on signal on my phone in messages and voice and zoom

31:48.640 --> 31:54.800
and we're in 2024 and none of them none of them still none of them have turned over the

31:54.800 --> 31:58.480
leaf of saying well I'm never going to call these things a vaccine again I'm going to make sure I

31:58.480 --> 32:06.000
call these things transfections even if what we think of as vaccines don't work we want to keep that

32:06.000 --> 32:10.960
language specific enough so that we know what we're talking about and it can't be confused as

32:10.960 --> 32:17.920
people approach trying to understand this but of course that's not the goal the goal is not to

32:17.920 --> 32:22.400
get people to understand it that's why being precise is exactly what these people don't do

32:25.440 --> 32:30.400
so start with these three things start with these three things with Brett Weinstein start

32:30.400 --> 32:35.520
with these three things with Chris Martinson start with these three things with with Alex

32:35.520 --> 32:40.400
Berenson start with these three things with Joe Rogan start with these three three things with

32:40.400 --> 32:47.040
Alexandros Marinos start with these three things with with Peter McCullough or Pierre Corey or anybody

32:47.040 --> 32:56.720
else on the internet and they will walk away ignore or nothing they will beg you to talk about

32:56.720 --> 33:05.840
something else and the reason why is because this puts all the debates to rest ivermectin who cares

33:09.680 --> 33:11.840
hydroxychloroquine i could give a

33:17.600 --> 33:23.280
they're lying ladies and gentlemen and they're if they're not lying they're ignoring and that's

33:23.360 --> 33:24.400
how you can see it

33:27.440 --> 33:31.520
now i think what's happening is the latest thing that we've done with regard to

33:32.320 --> 33:40.320
the the past few videos we've done is that we've really identified that this not only is this

33:40.320 --> 33:46.320
hypothesis excuse me this still can't do it this maybe i should do it this hand this hypothesis

33:46.320 --> 33:48.640
that we have over here is

33:53.200 --> 34:05.120
it's edified by almost every detail in the story almost every detail that even the medlers agree on

34:05.680 --> 34:10.080
edifies this hypothesis and yet they all ignore it as if it doesn't exist

34:11.200 --> 34:15.600
as if i didn't propose this hypothesis almost two and a half years ago maybe three

34:15.600 --> 34:20.320
and if you give credit to the video in may where i still didn't understand clones but kind of

34:20.320 --> 34:28.480
said this anyway i've been proposing this since may 2020 that there could be a hot background and

34:28.480 --> 34:35.360
we wouldn't know in other words what i've been proposing is simple that what they say is happening

34:35.360 --> 34:40.320
is not likely to have happened and there's lots of other easier explanations for what's happening

34:40.320 --> 34:46.320
and it's weird that we have no real way of discerning between these easier explanations

34:46.320 --> 34:53.680
like a hot background or an a specific test versus the explanation that they gave us which is

34:53.680 --> 35:00.000
high fidelity tests and a new virus there's no way to tell because we have no data from before

35:00.000 --> 35:08.000
january of 2020 and they have conveniently twisted that around we found out from the staffers of

35:08.080 --> 35:13.280
ron johnson for example that that oftentimes still echoes in people's head oh yeah but

35:13.280 --> 35:17.840
i think that means then that we just didn't have enough tests so before that that we weren't

35:17.840 --> 35:23.360
testing then it was totally going around except it didn't kill anybody until they announced it but

35:23.360 --> 35:31.120
that's okay because again it is about this cognitive dissonance where as long as most of the pieces

35:31.200 --> 35:36.880
fit i'm just not going to try anymore and that's how they got you they got us

35:38.480 --> 35:47.120
by lying about it lying about a million details simplifying oversimplifying so that

35:47.120 --> 35:51.840
millions of details were lost thousands of details were lost and other details that weren't

35:52.400 --> 36:00.080
relevant or were were were sidebars were focused on and then they elevated those people that were

36:00.080 --> 36:05.280
focused on the sidebars so that you would never actually get at the heart of what was going on

36:05.280 --> 36:12.720
which is that they murdered people they lied about death they fabricated deaths and all that

36:12.720 --> 36:17.760
rolled into one they lied about and said it was a pandemic of a novel virus for which we were all

36:17.760 --> 36:22.240
vulnerable that we had great high fidelity tests for and that these financial incentives wouldn't

36:22.240 --> 36:27.120
bother anybody and that these new protocols weren't going to hurt anybody and that all it is really

36:27.200 --> 36:32.320
is a novel virus going around and that although the molecular biology seems really ridiculous

36:33.280 --> 36:37.440
we assure you that this is just the way mother nature is and watch it go

36:39.200 --> 36:46.480
and this lie is designed to invert your sovereignty to to permissions it's to take away your

36:47.120 --> 36:49.920
freedom of your grandchildren that's really the plan here

36:49.920 --> 37:03.440
and so yesterday we have been working for a while now on trying to sort out this this problematic

37:04.960 --> 37:10.000
background biology that you know we don't know for sure where where it begins and ends we're not

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
really sure if it goes all the way back to AIDS and farther we need to figure it all out now we

37:16.080 --> 37:21.520
need to revisit it all and some of the ways that i've been doing it is try to revisit these people

37:21.520 --> 37:29.120
who have been awarded prizes for the discoveries of these these things which are somehow all related

37:29.120 --> 37:35.520
to the present situation and i'm talking about prions i'm talking about viruses i'm talking about

37:35.520 --> 37:43.440
them the enzymes of viruses the the biology of viruses and the methodologies around viruses and

37:43.520 --> 37:49.920
then the people who provide the illusion of consensus that these things exist that they exist in this

37:49.920 --> 37:55.680
form that they exist in this dogma and that these dogmas are correct and that these experimental

37:55.680 --> 38:03.200
results support the idea of these models and so there are a group of old men who have been given

38:03.200 --> 38:14.160
Nobel Prizes whose names include Bob Gallo and Stanley Prusner and David Baltimore and the people

38:14.160 --> 38:22.160
that are around them like Hilary Kaprowski and Stanley Plotkin and the people these people all

38:22.800 --> 38:30.720
are connected to the narrative which we can very succinctly very succinctly express which

38:30.720 --> 38:37.360
people from CHD don't seem to be able to express that people that have big substacks that covered

38:37.360 --> 38:42.000
various for four years don't seem to be able to express that people who work for the human genome

38:42.000 --> 38:49.760
project before or after dropping out of their PhD program and and and sold companies for for

38:49.760 --> 38:55.440
millions of dollars don't seem to be able to get to it's not just the idea that these aren't

38:55.440 --> 39:01.520
investigational vaccines but they're transfections it's getting at the idea that the vaccine schedule

39:01.520 --> 39:10.560
in America is criminal and I'm trying to be very precise there because I'm trying to challenge

39:10.560 --> 39:16.720
people who might be doubtful of this to go and investigate for themselves by just simply taking

39:16.720 --> 39:22.640
a step of like oh I don't know why don't you compare the vaccine schedule in America to the

39:22.720 --> 39:26.480
vaccine schedule in any other western country that you respect

39:29.680 --> 39:34.880
because it doesn't seem like any of these dissidents are able to do it Robert Malone will never do it

39:34.880 --> 39:40.560
Merrill Nass is now fighting the who she's never going to do it and it's a very simple

39:41.120 --> 39:46.080
comparison how many shots do we give our American children and how early do we give them

39:46.080 --> 39:50.880
how insistent are we how much do we push them how many financial incentives are there

39:50.960 --> 39:55.920
and let's look at Norway Sweden the UK let's look at at the Netherlands

39:59.120 --> 40:01.120
how many shots do they get in Africa

40:05.200 --> 40:10.880
ladies and gentlemen the bottom line is is that giga-owned biological

40:12.320 --> 40:18.320
Mark Hewson tonic at Hewson tonic ITS somebody like Jessica Hockett trying to make something

40:18.320 --> 40:25.040
happen on Twitter we are all capable of very succinctly expressing the things that we are

40:25.040 --> 40:29.840
concerned about Jessica Hockett very succinctly asks questions about what happened in New York

40:29.840 --> 40:35.360
City and why no one will talk about it. Mark asks questions about why no one will talk

40:35.360 --> 40:42.000
about the 500,000 plus people killed by opiates and overdosing in the United States and why

40:42.000 --> 40:47.040
no one will talk about the protocols that don't just include Remdesivir and Madaz Lam and all

40:47.040 --> 40:52.240
these other things but include high flow nasal oxygen for hours that we've all known it could

40:52.240 --> 40:59.280
be damaging and why aren't we talking about it and I would like to call like a lot of other

40:59.280 --> 41:05.360
people call attention to the criminal vaccine schedule in America and not lose focus by talking

41:05.360 --> 41:11.760
about the presidential election or talking about free speech or talking about uh I don't know what

41:12.640 --> 41:16.560
I want to talk about getting rid of the prep act I want to talk about getting out of the UN and

41:16.560 --> 41:21.760
the who I want to talk about strict liability for all pharmaceutical products and I want to talk

41:21.760 --> 41:26.720
about why intramuscular injection in many combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

41:26.720 --> 41:35.600
immune system is dumb and a lot of these people who write a sub stack every day or two sub stacks

41:35.680 --> 41:41.920
every day and share cartoons every day they can't speak so succinctly about the problems that we

41:41.920 --> 41:47.600
need to address the actual acute problems it's not Ukraine unless you're talking about the money

41:47.600 --> 41:51.600
going out the window it's not Israel unless you're talking about the money going out the window

41:51.600 --> 41:55.680
it's not banks unless you're talking about the money going out the window it's not

41:55.680 --> 41:59.520
the military industrial complex unless you're talking about money going out the window and the

41:59.520 --> 42:04.240
only money that we're exposed to fight about is whether or not we should pay for people student

42:04.240 --> 42:10.560
loans or not. Forget about weaponized piles of money and all the bankruptcies that they

42:10.560 --> 42:17.040
engage in in order to gain even more wealth and extract even more wealth. Completely ignore

42:17.040 --> 42:23.760
that stuff. Just like they wanted you to argue about the lab leak or a natural virus

42:23.760 --> 42:27.440
instead of arguing or paying any attention to what these protocols might have done in

42:27.440 --> 42:34.160
2020 or 2021. All doctors were distracted by the same story, the same illusion of consensus

42:34.960 --> 42:39.920
on the screen that we should argue about questions that we're never going to get at the heart of the

42:39.920 --> 42:48.480
lie. And I think we really need to reconsider the possibility actually take seriously the

42:48.480 --> 42:56.560
possibility that a lot of this biology has been distorted and misrepresented as being exclusively

42:56.560 --> 43:05.920
virology. And that's what really gets me fired up is I really think.

43:08.480 --> 43:12.720
And I noticed this already too late, but this yellow for some reason bleeds through the green

43:12.720 --> 43:17.440
screen. So I hope it's not too annoying, but I'm going to keep my trade jersey on ice tray.

43:18.080 --> 43:28.800
Uh, what I wanted to say was just to recover what we did yesterday with regard to with regard

43:28.800 --> 43:35.280
to the classification of viruses and what it really means. The Baltimore classification of

43:35.280 --> 43:40.480
viruses is what that what I'm referring to. And

43:41.040 --> 43:47.840
And it is used the term Baltimore classification is used because they're the first people to put it

43:47.840 --> 43:54.880
together. And for me, that's actually kind of an interesting statement to make. Um, because it's

43:54.880 --> 44:01.040
not necessarily a great idea. So I want to I want to emphasize why I think it's not a great idea. And

44:01.040 --> 44:06.640
this comes from what happened yesterday. So if you didn't see yesterday's stream, I would suggest

44:07.600 --> 44:12.960
watch it first and take it with a grain of salt. Of course, I'm not suggesting that I know for sure

44:12.960 --> 44:19.920
any of the alternative biological ideas that I presented in that video. I just thought it was

44:19.920 --> 44:25.680
very interesting. So let me first start with the Baltimore classification is the idea that there

44:25.680 --> 44:31.200
are many viruses. There are DNA viruses and there are an viruses and there are many different various

44:31.280 --> 44:38.320
kinds of actually six different kinds of viruses. And they all have various pathways

44:39.040 --> 44:46.960
with with whatever that lead to MRNA. And then the MRNA can be translated to proteins.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.680
Now the idea is, did I just spell proteins wrong? I did, didn't I?

44:53.680 --> 45:02.960
No, I didn't. Oh, wow. My brain just had a complete dyslexic amendment there. Um, anyway,

45:03.680 --> 45:11.200
the the idea is, is that there are one, two, three, four, five, six kinds of viruses,

45:11.920 --> 45:19.600
two of them use, um, DNA and four of them use RNA. Um, and I'm spearing my ink all over the

45:19.680 --> 45:25.120
place while I look like an amateur here. And my handwriting is terrible. Uh, the point being

45:25.120 --> 45:32.640
here, the Baltimore classification is a virology genetics chart. And it's the idea is, is that

45:32.640 --> 45:39.840
there are two DNA virus types. There are four RNA virus types and they differ based on the form of

45:39.840 --> 45:46.560
their, of their genetic material. So there's a single stranded DNA, double stranded DNA, double

45:46.560 --> 45:54.480
stranded RNA, positive, negative, and, and something else, I don't know, maybe it's, uh,

45:57.040 --> 46:02.160
positive, negative, I don't remember, it doesn't matter. There's, there's six kinds of viruses,

46:02.160 --> 46:09.680
and they all have different ways of getting to, um, MRNA. And two of these pathways, and I won't,

46:10.240 --> 46:17.120
I won't bother to draw it out directly. Um, two of these pathways use reverse transcriptase to go

46:17.120 --> 46:24.720
DNA to RNA, or so RNA to DNA. And then DNA goes back to RNA through the, through the cellular machinery

46:24.720 --> 46:32.880
to mRNA. So reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that takes RNA and goes back to DNA. And so

46:33.520 --> 46:39.280
in the same sort of Baltimore classification, I would argue that we should have been

46:39.360 --> 46:47.760
instead, we should do the kui classification or the kui, um, gene scheme. I don't know what

46:47.760 --> 46:57.760
I'm going to call this. This is just me improvising here. Um, I might have to open this. Uh, the kui

46:57.760 --> 47:05.040
gene scheme instead, I would like to rather talk about biology and thinking about biology. And so

47:05.040 --> 47:12.480
if we think about biology, the traditional idea is that you go DNA to RNA to protein.

47:14.000 --> 47:22.000
And this is, see, I spelled it right. This is the traditional basic biology 101 DNA translated

47:22.000 --> 47:26.960
to RNA translated to protein. And that would be the way that I would explain it to my kid,

47:26.960 --> 47:34.000
or you would explain it to a, to a first grader. And so DNA is the genetic material. This would be

47:34.080 --> 47:37.600
like the printer instructions. And then somewhere in here is the ribosome.

47:39.520 --> 47:47.360
And that's the printer. And now Mark and, and, and, and myself kind of agree on the idea that

47:47.360 --> 47:53.440
the ribosome is the key. More than anything else, they want to understand the ribosome. The ribosome

47:53.520 --> 48:03.920
is actually RNA plus protein. So it's a, it's a ribonucleic acid protein enzyme machine.

48:06.320 --> 48:12.480
It makes it very cool. There's lots of subunits. And so it's not going to be something that's

48:12.480 --> 48:17.120
going to be figured out anytime soon, because of course there's transfer RNAs and there's different

48:17.120 --> 48:22.080
variants and yada, yada, yada. There's thousands of them in every cell. But this is the interesting

48:22.080 --> 48:29.360
part because as, as you'll hear in a wide variety of TED talks, you are all basically proteins.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.760
The proteins are all the machines in your body. The ribosomes are RNA plus protein,

48:33.760 --> 48:38.880
but they're also the most important machine in your body. Now the interesting thing about

48:38.880 --> 48:47.440
molecular biology is that enzymes are kind of like tools in the toolbox. And our ability to

48:48.240 --> 48:54.720
dissect molecular biology depends on the tools in the toolbox. So we started out with very few

48:54.720 --> 49:01.040
tools in the toolbox other than the ability to chemically identify, for example, RNA

49:01.040 --> 49:06.480
or DNA or proteins and analyze them, purify them, sequence them was very difficult.

49:07.360 --> 49:19.280
Then we found tools like DNA polymerase, which is an enzyme that can copy DNA. And so once we

49:19.280 --> 49:24.000
were able to get our hands on this tool, then we could do stuff that we couldn't do before.

49:25.520 --> 49:31.600
Another tool that was very interesting, of course, is this tool up here, the reverse transcriptase.

49:31.680 --> 49:38.800
Reverse transcriptase allows us to go this way. And so reverse transcriptase allowed us to take

49:38.800 --> 49:44.400
the RNA in a cell or the RNA in a sample or the RNA in a blood or wherever we found it and

49:44.400 --> 49:49.600
make DNA of it. And then DNA, once we get that, we can make a lot of it, you see,

49:50.320 --> 49:56.560
because we had RNA DNA polymerase. So this tool combines very well with this tool to do a lot of

49:56.560 --> 50:04.000
things in molecular biology. Now, what I need you to understand is that this thing right here

50:04.880 --> 50:13.200
that contains this whole sequence here, this is like a motorcycle. Okay, this is the motorcycle.

50:14.160 --> 50:20.480
And in trying to understand the motorcycle, we have very limited set of tools. This might be,

50:20.480 --> 50:29.040
for example, a Phillips screwdriver and DNA polymerase might be a Torx wrench with a couple

50:29.600 --> 50:38.320
drivers on it. But that doesn't mean that we understand how the motorcycle goes. We know the

50:38.320 --> 50:42.480
smoke comes out the end. We know that when you turn the handle, it revs up and what goes really

50:42.480 --> 50:49.840
fast and you can shift it and whatever. But this screwdriver allows us to take the quarter panel

50:49.840 --> 50:56.080
off or the side panel off, allows us to take the fairing off, it allows us to remove the starter.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.960
But we still don't know how the starter works. We have no idea it's an internal combustion

51:00.960 --> 51:05.600
engine. We have no idea that there's gas in the tank and that it's being slowly combusted to

51:05.600 --> 51:12.640
make the noise. We have nothing because we were just given the motorcycle. We ride around on it.

51:14.480 --> 51:18.720
And now we've been given a couple tools and we've been, we're trying to figure out how it works

51:18.800 --> 51:25.280
with no knowledge, none, no knowledge at all. Just that it makes noise and it goes fast and it's

51:25.280 --> 51:31.600
really fun to ride and we've had this screwdriver and a wrench. Now what I find very interesting

51:31.600 --> 51:37.120
is that for this wrench right here, the reverse transcriptase wrench, somebody got the Nobel

51:37.120 --> 51:43.760
Prize for that one. And what that does again is it allows it to go backwards. So we're going

51:43.840 --> 51:49.760
reverse transcriptase allows us to go backwards from RNA to DNA. Nobody got a Nobel Prize for RNA

51:49.760 --> 51:54.640
polymerase or even though our DNA polymerase, even though that's also an interesting discovery,

51:54.640 --> 52:04.960
a very neat machine. Interestingly, viruses are actually exclusively have the sort of,

52:05.520 --> 52:12.160
how do you say it? They have the monopoly on all of the enzymes that work on RNA. They have a

52:12.160 --> 52:18.400
monopoly, it says right here, they're all viruses, all four RNA virus types have a monopoly on

52:19.520 --> 52:26.160
it's weird, they have a monopoly on, oh yeah, that's a retrovirus. So the fourth kind of RNA

52:26.160 --> 52:33.120
virus is a retrovirus. So they convert their RNA, they convert it to DNA first, then that DNA

52:33.120 --> 52:39.600
gets converted to RNA and then gets translated to protein. So the sixth kind of RNA virus is a

52:39.680 --> 52:45.040
retrovirus. And then you have positive strand RNA, negative strand RNA and double stranded RNA

52:45.040 --> 52:52.000
viruses. I knew I would get there eventually if I just kept talking. So the point is that we don't

52:52.000 --> 53:00.480
and we will not anytime soon be able to adequately understand with high fidelity the DNA RNA protein

53:00.480 --> 53:06.880
with ribosomes in the middle sort of machinery. That's a loss cause that's not going to happen

53:06.880 --> 53:12.640
anytime soon, given the approach that we are taking and given the amount of exaggeration and

53:12.640 --> 53:19.280
lies we are telling. The vast majority of people are not even investigating any of the meaningful

53:19.280 --> 53:25.520
working parts here, but instead are just doing small little things like turning screws,

53:26.480 --> 53:31.600
loosening bolts, and the motorcycle behaves a little differently, but essentially it's still

53:31.600 --> 53:39.840
working. So I guess we understand. And so what I find very interesting is that all of these proteins,

53:39.840 --> 53:46.400
sorry, all of these enzymes, the machinery that supposedly allows all these different forms of

53:46.400 --> 53:55.920
aberrant RNA signals to propagate in nature are the exclusive domain of viruses. Even though I

53:55.920 --> 54:05.120
think most people would agree that mammals, primates, and humans in particular, are kind of a

54:05.120 --> 54:13.760
the culminating species or species set of evolution, we are the most complicated life forms on the

54:13.760 --> 54:21.520
planet. I mean, who else would you argue is more complicated than us than mammals? I mean,

54:21.600 --> 54:25.600
what I mean, I'm not saying that we're more complicated than a dolphin or that we're more

54:25.600 --> 54:33.520
complicated than orangutan. I'm saying that though that level of species is as good as it's gotten so

54:33.520 --> 54:43.360
far after however much time has happened, however much creation has exist, that's the ultimate machine,

54:43.360 --> 54:50.800
right? So if we're the ultimate pattern integrity, how is it that our machinery is limited

54:50.800 --> 54:58.320
to copying DNA and also reading DNA and RNA and reading RNA into proteins, that's all we can do.

54:58.320 --> 55:07.520
But these viruses that according to David Baltimore needed cells before they could even exist somehow

55:07.520 --> 55:15.760
have the monopoly on all these magic enzymes that we don't have. All different ways of creatively

55:15.760 --> 55:22.160
using these different types of genetic signals, they can do all kinds of creative stuff with them.

55:22.160 --> 55:30.320
But us, you know, mammals with all our complexity are just limited to DNA RNA and protein and in

55:30.320 --> 55:37.520
that direction only. And the crazy thing about that ridiculous statement is that reverse transcriptase

55:37.520 --> 55:47.520
was found in tumor exosomes. So it was essentially an endogenous protein that has now been told to

55:47.520 --> 55:56.000
us is in retroviruses like AIDS. And that these are foreign things, they are from other places

55:56.800 --> 56:04.160
rather than an aspect of our innate biology rather than an aspect of our innate

56:05.120 --> 56:11.200
homeostatic system that includes small genetic signals like this. They have told us that we

56:11.200 --> 56:19.120
use none of them except when we have cancer or if we've got AIDS. Other than that, these things

56:19.120 --> 56:27.760
are all outside of us and fit inside of Baltimore's classification. And in my humble opinion as a

56:27.840 --> 56:34.640
biologist, the moment that we found any of these enzymes in the wild, we should have assumed based

56:34.640 --> 56:39.840
on the kui gene scheme that they must be used as part of our pattern integrity as well.

56:42.080 --> 56:46.800
That they're just another layer of complexity that we have that we have grossly underestimated

56:46.800 --> 56:53.360
by saying to our children that it's just DNA to RNA to protein. That we don't make any copies

56:53.360 --> 56:58.560
of our RNA that we don't copy RNA at all. Only viruses do that and they have four different

56:58.560 --> 57:06.000
ways of doing it, but we never, we never copy our RNA. That's the statement that is made

57:06.000 --> 57:10.800
by accepting the Baltimore classification of six different kinds of viruses that can all do

57:10.800 --> 57:17.120
special things with their special enzymes, but we can't. We never do that. Why would we

57:17.200 --> 57:25.920
be mammals regulate our RNA? That would be crazy. Why would we make copies of our RNA? Why would

57:25.920 --> 57:31.840
we ever use an RNA dependent RNA polymerase? What a ridiculous statement that would be according

57:31.840 --> 57:37.360
to David Baltimore and Vincent Rancic-Rack and yellow only viruses have those special enzymes.

57:39.680 --> 57:45.280
And once you start to see the ridiculousness of that statement and the fact that you have to

57:45.360 --> 57:52.320
take their word for it, that when they find an RNA polymerase, RNA dependent RNA polymerase,

57:52.320 --> 58:01.040
that it is definitely not yours. It's from a virus and that is the basis for all of this story.

58:01.040 --> 58:08.960
It's pretty holy shit. And I don't know how to better explain it other than that,

58:09.840 --> 58:17.200
that they have bamboozles us, including David Baltimore, to accept that all of these special

58:17.200 --> 58:23.040
enzymes and all these special ways of manipulating the various forms of genetic material that we,

58:23.040 --> 58:28.240
I guess, all agree are important. These special ways are all monopolized

58:28.560 --> 58:39.440
by things that aren't even patterned integrities. We're all evolved in the context of things that

58:39.440 --> 58:48.000
aren't even patterned integrities. We're supposed to believe that, that these things that he says

58:48.000 --> 58:54.240
couldn't exist until cells existed are completely independent of the organisms that he says they're

58:54.320 --> 59:02.720
obligate pathogens of. There is a magnificent contradiction there, a magnificent contradiction,

59:02.720 --> 59:10.800
which basically suggests that you can make a cuckoo clock do things like make toast,

59:13.040 --> 59:17.520
because these viruses can come in and do things that we can't do. And they can make us do those

59:17.520 --> 59:23.520
things that we don't have the machinery to do. We don't know how to copy RNA, but man, oh man,

59:24.160 --> 59:29.200
if they come around and inject their stuff into us, now we copy RNA and we're forced to do it.

59:32.640 --> 59:37.040
I think I see it, ladies and gentlemen, I bet you I bet you dollars to donuts that they're

59:37.040 --> 59:42.720
going to start ignoring us more than they have ever ignored us because we are so on this.

59:45.200 --> 59:48.480
Let me just pull up that video again from yesterday and see if we can't

59:49.280 --> 59:55.920
we can't complete that exercise from yesterday. Is this on here?

59:57.680 --> 59:58.160
Let me see.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:07.520
Where would it be? That would be it. No, that's a different one. This one, and it's the 29 one.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:15.360
Here we go. I got it. First transcriptase. And I'll put it over here. Oh, I got to slide this over.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:25.280
Okay, so this is where we left off. I'm just going to tap it back a couple seconds here.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:31.360
So this is the basic scheme that we were talking about a minute ago. And so my argument is again,

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:38.800
here we see tumor causing RNA viruses, tumor causing RNA viruses. So they they found reverse

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.200
transcriptase inside of, and they say tumor causing, but that's not what happened, right?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.160
That's a magic trick and an enchantment that I didn't even see yesterday or I didn't identify

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:58.800
yesterday. But even the proof that these these viruses caused the cancer as part of their illusion.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.760
This is what started back in the 70s when all this stuff was happening was this idea that that's

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:12.400
Bob Gallo that cancer is caused by viruses. That's not at all what's happening there. And in fact,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.080
those viruses are probably signaling. It could be aberrant signaling, but nonetheless, it's

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.600
signaling. What I said yesterday in the stream and suggested was that these signaling pathways

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:33.680
could be very heterogeneous and very small signals in health and very difficult to discern as

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.480
independent signals when they're in circulation. And it could be very, very difficult forever

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.760
for us to ever penetrate this. And if you talk to the people who have studied exosomes as

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.920
endogenous signaling, they will tell you that that's the challenge, that it's a real super

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.920
highway of information that it's so varied, that it would be very hard to find patterns within it.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.920
But it could be, follow me well here, it could be that during a pathogenic state like cancer,

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:11.680
these signaling pathways become much more homogenized. They've become one signal and very loud. And so

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.240
instead of all different insects in the background, you just have 30 crickets. And so wow, now you

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.320
hear them. But if it was only one cricket and 100,000 other different kinds of insects, there would be

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:30.480
no pattern of what lives in your backyard. It would just be an assortment, right? And so it would be

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:37.920
harder to understand the ecosystem than if it was just crickets and and toads and and garter snakes.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.840
Now you can kind of understand how they are related to one another. And so in the context of trying

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.840
to understand how the human body, how the mammalian system signals within itself and signals between

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.320
species or between cons specifics, if it's a signal like that, would be almost impossible.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.520
It's curious because there was this guy, I think it's Ian Lipkin or or or another guy,

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:14.640
Lipstitch. One of these two guys was working on a kind of nano molecular tool set and taking money

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:22.560
from the Chinese. And it seemed like basically a nano reader for viruses. But if you understand

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.440
that the human body in health and in disease, the tissues and the immune system

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:35.520
are likely communicating using exosomes, then the application would actually be much more

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.040
interesting when applied to that, where you would start to read the background signal,

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.600
almost like a widespread radio sampling antenna.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:59.440
And so I think it's a very, very interesting idea to to ponder, ponder the idea that this scheme

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:08.960
of DNA and RNA viruses is actually a scheme which hides the fact that mammalian systems,

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:19.120
mammalian animals, bodies, engage in a plethora of exosomal communication in health and in disease,

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.600
and that they have known it for some time. They actually probably discovered it accidentally when

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:34.560
they infected people, quote unquote, they contaminated people with similar signals from related species.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.920
And specifically, I'm talking about the possibility that monkey exosomes from monkey immune systems

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:55.920
or from monkey tissues were injected into humans and they had the the unexpected outcome of revealing

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:03.280
that our own immune system uses retroviruses. And if we were to contaminate that system with

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:08.880
retroviruses from a related species, we might actually ruin that system. We might

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.320
actually damage it. And that's probably what happened. That's probably what AIDS is or represents

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:21.520
is this discovery. And so it's possible, ladies and gentlemen, that there are examples

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.920
where this communication system of exosomes goes wrong in the gut

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:38.880
or elsewhere. And we have measles. It's possible. But it is very unlikely. It is extremely unlikely

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:47.680
that all of this machinery, all of this biology is exclusively outside of us and occupies a zone

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:54.320
of interest that has nothing to do with pattern integrity, but has to do with molecular molecules

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:03.280
that sustain themselves. It's just highly unlikely that this is the truth. This is a mythology

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:10.960
that I think really undermines our ability to appreciate the irreducible complexity of ourselves.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:16.640
In other words, if this was the truth down here, the kui gene scheme, where actually,

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:25.680
the reality is, is that we can copy our RNA in certain contexts, because we do have RNA-dependent

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:34.480
RNA polymerases. It would be very scary if our immune system communicates T cell to B cell or

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:43.520
or, or, or iscine fill to B cell or hascine fill to T cell using retroviruses. That would be pretty

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:51.440
terrifying to find out that maybe part of the way that we select who we are attracted to is based

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:59.440
on the contents of MHC molecules and the composition of exosomes which we receive when we kiss or when

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:09.280
we touch. Never mind when we make love. And this would result in a very much more complex

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
view of our biology, a more wonderful appreciation of how, how complicated we are.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.320
And they do not want us to know that because then that would undermine all of their public health

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.840
model. It would undermine all of their, their value to us.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.720
And it would actually restore our reverence for the sacred. We would start thinking of our bodies

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:44.800
and our minds as temples instead of as, as, as things to be improved as, as things that are imperfect

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:52.560
from the start, depending on how we feel or our lived experience. I think that's what's dangerous

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.200
about the Baltimore classification. I think it's very possible that we have not only reverse

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.400
transcriptase working in certain contexts that we don't understand. We may even have RNA-dependent

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.320
RNA polymerases that work in certain contexts that we don't understand. We may even have RNAs

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:15.040
which are transmitted through our body with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in order to make sure that when

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.520
that RNA reaches its target, that it's just not one molecule, that it becomes more than one molecule.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:29.840
If you send arc RNA from one neuron to another, is that going to be sufficient to change anything

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.120
over there? Are you going to need to also make a few more copies of that RNA?

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.240
Or are you going to package a bunch of those RNAs into an exosome and send it out,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.160
and in packaging those RNAs, you had to copy them locally. There are lots of different scenarios

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.400
where it's extremely easy for me to imagine why we would use RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:58.880
local and distant signaling in our bodies in various systems. And yet for some reason or another,

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:06.400
not only are they exclusively in viruses, but in all these cases of different RNA-dependent RNA

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.680
polymerases needed, no one has won a Nobel Prize for those. None of them, none of those discoveries

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:20.320
are Nobel Prizes, nobody gives a shit. And in fact, in this video that we are about to start,

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:27.920
in all of the times when he's had a chance to say RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are exclusively

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.720
in viruses, he has not said it. He won't even say RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, he will just

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:42.240
say polymerase. Unless it's reverse transcriptase, then he'll say the whole name. And I see it as a

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.160
huge red flag. I think this is the heart of the illusion. And why there are no viruses is the

01:09:48.160 --> 01:10:00.160
perfect, perfect trap. Why making fun of these people in that very simplified way is the perfect

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:09.680
trap. Do you see it? Let's listen to David Baltimore. Let's finish this video.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:19.600
Viruses to test whether they might have a polymerase. And as I said, in a few days found

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.680
what we were looking for. The reverse transcriptase is an enzyme now that's understood in great detail.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:41.120
You can see how the DNA or RNA are threaded through the polymerase from its structure.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.760
So let me say a few words about what the discovery of reverse transcription

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:56.160
allowed. It allowed various kinds of understanding and it allowed various kinds of technology.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.280
The understanding was the understanding that RNA tumor viruses are retroviruses,

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:10.080
that they reverse transcribe their genome and integrate it into the host cell. And that

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:17.040
really said that cancer was a consequence of genetic alteration of cells.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.680
And so now he's not being very precise here because RNA tumor viruses as far as he's

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:29.840
implying are from outside the body. They're not exosomes. Be very clear here about the

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.480
story that he's telling and he's trying hard not to say any more than he has to because he knows

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:45.840
it's a big LIE lie. And the other thing is that how do you think about how fast you went through

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:53.360
that shift? This should be a pretty big discovery. The RNA tumor viruses were renamed

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.920
retroviruses, but they're not from outside. They were discovered in tumors coming from tumors.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:08.000
They are endogenous signals. This is ridiculous. If they cause the cancer, then when they're

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.800
releasing these retroviruses, wouldn't you have to stay away from people with cancer? It's just

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.960
ridiculous. And yet he's going to go through it like it's just yeah, that's the way it is. We

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.760
found viruses associated with cancer. We made this great discovery. And now we're going to talk

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:31.120
about AIDS because AIDS also has a retrovirus and it comes from monkeys from bush meat, right?

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.240
Brett Weinstein. Holy cow. Do you see it?

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:45.840
And the other thing is that reverse transcription allowed biotechnologists to capture

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.760
the genetic information. See, now this is why I wanted to do that intro, which was so,

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.640
what's the worst piece of paper I've ever put ink on? It looks terrible, but

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.080
I'm actually better writing when I'm not talking. So that's why it looks so bad. But the real point

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:10.400
to make about that is that if we think about life on Earth in general and trying to understand

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.760
how life on Earth exists as a pattern integrity, we would be trying in earnest to understand

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:23.120
common mechanisms that are present with regard to DNA, RNA, ribosomes, and protein production.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.760
And all the steps in various ways in which that could be regulated, how it could be altered,

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.080
how it could be changed, how it expresses itself in a complex way. And yet for ourselves, we are

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.440
told that it's DNA to RNA to protein and that one of the proteins that's really important are antibodies.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.320
We are told that there are viruses everywhere, but don't focus on bacteriophages, even though we

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.280
have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in our skin, in our lungs, and in our gut.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.600
Don't worry about bacteriophages. We don't need to talk about them at all.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.400
Never mind that reverse transcriptase was found in exosomes coming from tumors.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.280
Think of all of these things in the Baltimore classification as viruses being outside of you.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.720
That's the enchantment, ladies and gentlemen, that's the enchantment. It's not to say that

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:22.240
there are not aberrant signals at this, at this regime that can cause disease. It's very possible,

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.480
especially if, especially if, listen carefully, your body does signal using these signals.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:35.280
If your body does signal using retroviruses, if your body does signal using exosomes with RNA

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:42.240
and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase in it, that are not only is our biology more complicated,

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.080
not only is our immune response more complicated, but it is actually

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:53.680
impossibly complicated relative to their understanding of it. And they have no ground to stand on them.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:15:03.120
This simple idea is falling apart right before your eyes, and this guy gave this lecture in

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:08.400
2018 right before the pandemic just to lay the foundation. They made two different versions

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.680
of it, a simple one and a longer one. And I think this is the thing that's going to fall apart.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.680
This is where biology falls apart right here, the Baltimore classification scheme. It's not that

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:32.240
there are no viruses unless you're very precise and say viruses as this ubiquitous thing in nature

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:40.160
outside of us, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pathogenic signals, that's a lie.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:49.840
If you then stated that instead there's this unbelievably hot background of exosomic signaling

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:58.240
that involves DNA and RNA and various proteins that that can amplify RNA and DNA, copy DNA,

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.880
it caused its integration. These signals are everywhere. There are signals like this in the

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.640
regime of bacteria. There are signals like this in the regime of fungi of plants and of mammals

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:18.160
and of insects. And this level of complexity is so deep that the only thing you can do is

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.680
stand back and appreciate it, try to measure it, maybe try to look at it, but not

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:32.320
to understand it as exclusively outside of you is really absolutely and totally wrong.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:39.440
It's incorrect and it's a lie. And it's what's scarier is the idea that what they're implying

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.440
is a fraction, right? So even if some of these people would give it to me what they would say,

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:52.320
and this would be like a pie diagram, right? For the, come on, pen. Here we go. Come on,

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.520
pen. Don't fail me now because this is the reason why you're a cheap pen. You see the difference

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:05.840
between a cheap pen and a not cheap pen is that this one, for example, it's nib will not hold ink

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:13.440
at all. And if you stop writing, it will dry like, oh my gosh, are you kidding me? Now watch this.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.720
Here's another pen that I haven't touched in weeks. We're just going to get that pen out.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.960
It's got a much nicer nib and it's going to write immediately. So in case you're worried about

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.200
fountain pens, my first advice would be just stick with with with regular pens and you'll never

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.520
have this problem. But if you really like to write and draw and you get into fountain pens,

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.560
by one advice would be don't waste any time with cheap nibs. The most important thing is the tip.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.880
So if we look, oh, look at that thing writes right away. How surprising is that? So if we make two

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:56.960
pie diagrams and we say this is the TV and this is a kui, then we might put pathogenic viruses right

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:05.760
here. Maybe there are some times when the X is almost signaling of mammals and other animals can

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:13.600
be aberrant. And so for example, if you inject people with exosomes from other primates,

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:23.760
you might cause disease that might fit in here. If you ate the brains of some animal,

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:30.160
you might you might get in here where some of these exosomal signaling mechanisms might go

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:37.520
wrong in you. That's possible. But the vast majority of this stuff is just endogenous signaling

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.480
that we can't really understand because it not only comes from us, but it comes from everywhere,

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.600
including all of the bacteria that are in our world and have bacteriophages that are sending

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.240
signals in this same regime. The TV on the other hand, would like you to believe that all of those

01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:08.720
signals are barely anything. And most of those are actually RNA retroviruses, right? And some of

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:17.600
those are kind of like AIDS or associated with tumors. And then everything else is mother nature's

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:26.240
pathogens. And now my argument here, and again, I apologize for the worst graphics in the history

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:32.800
of the show, but my argument here is that this difference in the representation and the illusion

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.560
of consensus about what's real and what's not is very, very stark. Robert Malone would would

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.040
ascribe to this. Meryl Nash would ascribe to this. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would ascribe to this.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:50.240
Peter McCullough would probably ascribe to this. There are lots of people who would say, yes,

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:59.520
the pathogen catalog is worth two volumes. And the exosomal communication is worth a sliver

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:07.760
and barely relevant here. Whereas I would argue, and I think any biologist that actually has

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.600
read into this would understand that if all living beings, including bacteria and fungi,

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:21.440
are accepted to send out exosomal signals to, to use these signals both for themselves and to

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:28.960
communicate, that it would be very impossible to adequately assess the total fraction of this

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:35.680
signaling regime that is pathogenic, but it is not all of it. It's not the vast majority of it.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.040
And somewhere in here in the TV thing, of course, is gain a function stuff, which could be even more

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.080
extra deadly viruses out here that would have never existed in mother nature if we didn't create

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:57.200
them. And those don't exist in this scheme. They don't exist in this scheme. Because again,

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:03.760
evolution has existed in the context of this communication for millennia. And so we're very

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:10.080
robust in terms of the limited ways in which this thing could go pathogenic. And we're very

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.360
resilient to it. The TV would like you to believe that we have almost no resistance to any of

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.800
these pathogens until we see them for the first time. There are no common mechanisms

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.880
shared with our previous ancestors that that encountered their previous ancestors of this

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:34.800
background signal. And that assumption is based on the idea that exosomal signaling doesn't really

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:41.600
exist. It doesn't, it doesn't happen in the TV biology. It's just all outside of us.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.400
And the fact of the matter is there is an endogenous signal for all of these organisms from bacteria

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.120
all the way up to us and that endogenous signal needs to be ignored in order for the model of

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:59.840
pathogens to exist. In order for the Baltimore classification scheme to be worthy of textbook

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:07.600
pages, you have to ignore the fact that all organisms known on the planet use exosomes or some

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:14.160
form of short and long term genetic communication that could be classified under an umbrella term

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:25.280
exosome, a small membrane bound genetic signal. I mean, they make them. And this scheme needs

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.440
you to accept that they don't. They don't make any of these signals. These signals are all from

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.160
outside of us. I know that this is maybe beating a dead horse, but I think this is the breakthrough

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:44.000
that happened yesterday, the really important bridge that we can now express. The incredulousness

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.400
that we can now express really, do you really believe that RNA dependent RNA polymerases are

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:57.680
exclusively the tools of viruses in the wild that we don't have any of these kinds of tools?

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:03.600
Do you really believe that reverse transcriptase is only used by retroviruses that are in the wild

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:09.440
that we can only get from bushmeat? Do you really believe that? And that somehow they only show up

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.520
when we have a tumor and that Howard Teman is just dead for nothing.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:26.800
From individual genes as messenger RNA that was reverse transcribed in the laboratory,

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.800
and that became a central methodology of biotechnology. There he is. And so again,

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.760
what I'm emphasizing to you is that what virology does is it covers up for the limited toolbox that

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:48.560
molecular biology has and gives them excuses to experiment on it without us knowing what they're

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:55.280
doing. We have absolutely no clue. No one on the planet except for people watching this show right

01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:02.560
now will think today. Hmm, I wonder if any of these viral enzymes have any role in mammals.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:10.240
I wonder if these enzymes have any role in plants in fungi or in insects or in reptiles and amphibians.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.040
I guess not. They're just all viruses.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.480
I guess all these other complicated life forms on the planet like reptiles, amphibians, birds,

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:27.280
mammals, even bacteria, we don't we don't bother with any of this other fancy enzymes, you know,

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.400
like RNA dependent RNA polymerases. We don't bother to copy RNA. That would be crazy.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.560
We don't use RNA for anything other than internal signaling to go from the nucleus to the ribosome

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.240
and make some protein. That's it. That's how simple you are. And that's what makes you vulnerable

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:52.320
to all these incredibly diverse virology things. I think I see it. I think I see through this

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.920
bullshit. And I think that is the main bullshit that somehow or another we are very simple in our

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:04.720
genetic ways and that these virus these viruses have evolved all kinds of things that can bypass

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.320
our very sophisticated ways or our very simple ways. Excuse me. It's it's extraordinary.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.240
And how little they have learned in the past 30 years, they have been right about this

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.600
ship since they found it. It's not really changed. The model is not changed in that time. You know,

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.240
they haven't learned anything new. They were right from the beginning. Also learn from

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:35.440
work on the structure of the human genome that as much as 45% of the human genome

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:42.400
arose by reverse transcription over historic time. So again, now they're trying to say to you

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.600
that it happens, but it's still outside of you. Reverse transcription is something that happens

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:56.000
despite us. Mainly by the copying of mobile genetic elements, which are like viruses, except

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.560
they don't have an extra cellular existence. They simply are part of cellular life.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.920
Oh, so you're telling me that the cuckoo clock does make cuckoo clock noises. I see.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.600
They're just part of regular cellular life. So what if there is also an RNA dependent RNA

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.880
polymerase with an RNA that can be produced by one cell and sent to another cell so that that

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:24.560
cell makes a few more copies of that RNA and makes the protein that it codes for? Why wouldn't that

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.760
be something that we would have inside of our infinitely complex pattern integrity of a body?

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.120
I don't think Bunkminster Fuller would think that was a crazy idea. I don't think any biologist

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:43.040
with an imagination would think that, oh, wow, look what I found in this little cell culture.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:49.680
I'm sure it's exclusive to what I found in the cell culture. This enzyme is exclusive to what

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.400
I've just found in the cell culture. There's no way I would ever look for this enzyme inside

01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.880
of us. That would be stupid, obviously, because I learned already in biology 101 that we're just

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.000
DNA to RNA through a ribosome to protein. None of these other things happen inside of us.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.600
That's just viruses. Oh, I'm going to keep repeating this until I'm blue in the face,

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:19.440
because I think it's so right. And finally, the discovery of reverse transcription

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.280
set the base for 10 years later, the discovery of that the

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:35.280
AIDS epidemic was being caused by the spread of a virus, HIV. And there is where we see what

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.240
Elena Papadopoulos or whatever told us was that actually the presence of reverse transcription

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:48.720
was the primary indicator of the presence of the AIDS virus. It's true. Just like testing for

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.400
the antibodies is how they told you you had AIDS for many, many years.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.400
Doing an in vitro assay for reverse transcription was one of the primary ways that people like David

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.640
Baltimore demonstrated the presence of a retro virus. Do you understand that?

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:14.000
That a cell culture cannot express reverse transcriptase. It's not possible. They've ruled it out.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.320
We don't have it. It doesn't work except for intumor viruses where they found it.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.560
Where Howard Teman and David Baltimore both found it. Where Howard Teman had worked for years

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.800
and years to find it. And then David Baltimore, because he was a molecular biologist, a pretty easy

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.320
experiment for him to do. So he practically scooped him in a couple of weeks. And now for some reason

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.160
or another, the guy who scooped the dude who worked very hard to find that reverse transcription

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:48.880
happened in tumor viruses, tumor exosomes. That guy's dead. And the guy who scooped him

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.280
in about two weeks, because as he said, well, I'm gonna, you know, for me, it was a real easy

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.520
experiment. So I just did it. And I did it. He's now the guy who got the Nobel Prize and the guy who's

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.760
still alive and the guy who's still telling us right before the pandemic that this is the way viruses

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:15.200
work. Right before an RNA pandemic. I wouldn't know about Howard Teman if it wasn't for my friend

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.920
Mark Koolack. I wouldn't know about Stanley Plotkin if it wasn't for my friend Mark Koolack.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.840
I wouldn't know who Hillary Kaprowski was if it wasn't for my friend Mark Koolack.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.880
I would have had no idea who Cina Vivari was or why him writing a paper with Allison

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:34.000
Tatura would be interesting in 2019 if it wasn't for my friend Mark Koolack.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:41.680
And I don't think very many people on the planet right now allow me to dunk for a second would have

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:48.960
any have approached this with this concept of hey, wait a minute, why would none of these RNA

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:57.280
enzymes even get an award? Why is it that this guy won't even say RNA dependent RNA polymerase?

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:05.920
Why is it that he won't say exosomal signaling in 2018 when we know there was a whole I mean,

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:11.920
we know the NIH made a whole little video set about exosomal signaling and how ubiquitous it was.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.680
Why doesn't he ever talk about bacteriophages except for when he wants to prove to you that

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:25.360
there are viruses then he shows you a bacteriophage experiment. But when it comes to pandemics when

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.480
it comes to sickness when it comes to illness, it's only viruses outside of you. It can't be

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:40.000
exosomes and it can't be bacteriophages. Not one human condition is caused by bacteriophages.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.120
Can you believe that? Is that even possible? Given what we now accept as a symbiotic relationship

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:53.120
with our with our gut that has to do with neuronal communication through the vagus nerve that has

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:58.400
to do with interaction with the immune system in in payers patches where the bacteria actually

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.280
goes in for a little while every night, how we really to believe that none of these conditions

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.800
that we experience as sickness can be caused by bacteriophages really

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.520
that bacteriophages are just something that are there that prove that there's something there

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:20.560
that we can use as you know we we use this we found this this methodology work so we use it for this

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.920
to works on bacteriophages therefore it must work on these.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:34.480
I think that's really the lie. I think the lie is that we have exosomes in our body from maybe all

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:40.000
healthy tissues but certainly probably from the immune system that either use retroviruses or

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:47.280
RNA viruses RNA viruses that contain an RNA transcript with an RNA dependent RNA polymerase

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.040
encoded with it so that when that little signal hits a cell that cell will not only have RNA but

01:31:53.040 --> 01:32:00.000
it'll make a little extra and that express the protein that's there that could be a very easy way

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:09.600
for interferon to be expressed in cells neighboring cells that need to be activated or a way for

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.840
neighboring cells to up regulate their immediate immune response or signaling regime by sending

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.640
an RNA dependent RNA polymerase with an RNA signal to your neighboring cells also to put it into

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:30.480
circulation to activate an immune response would not be a crazy concept and yet somehow or another

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.760
they want you to believe the only time that exosomes are present are when you have cancer and then

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:42.400
they are they are signaling and causing the cancer but otherwise they're not there at all and

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:51.600
otherwise all these signals come from outside and that incredible simplification involves ignoring

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:58.720
everything that we suspect about ourselves as being this irreducibly complex

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.040
magnificent creation it's extraordinary ladies and gentlemen because I think this is where it

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:15.680
breaks this is the break right here and this I think this this much more nuanced take on the lie

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:24.960
is the kind of thing that the no virus stance was meant to prevent people from reaching

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:32.480
if you say that there are just no viruses and they're lying and you focus on isolation and

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:39.360
you focus on purification you're never going to get to this where you fully understand that no

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:47.280
they have taken parts of our own irreducible complexity our own sacred biology and told us

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:53.360
a lie that this sacredness exists outside of us and instead of being part of our sacredness is

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:59.840
actually pathogenic it's actually part of the world's resistance to our existence part of the

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.960
garden of Eden's condemnation of ourselves it's a lie it's just a lie it's a lie meant to

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:12.400
confuse our children it is a lie meant to reverse our sovereignty or invert it

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:21.440
and it's a lie that a very small number of old men are guilty of telling us and I think he knows it

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.800
I do I think David Baltimore has known that this lie existed for as long as Tony Fauci and as

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.560
long as Bob Gallo and as long as Tony Stanley Prouzner have known that these are lies they are

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:42.000
lies about our sacred biology in order to disguise an effort to control us an effort to

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:54.080
rein our growth in to find a way of governing us as farm animals basically treating us as experiments

01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.880
and it's not even us right this was a multi-generational game it's not for us it's not even for our

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.680
kids it's for our kids kids and the opening that we have right now is that people like David

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:12.800
Baltimore aren't going to live forever and when they're gone there are people that are less capable

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.800
of sustaining this lie because the illusion is sustained partially by these old men and their

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:28.160
collective chorus together because they're lies they can't cover up the lies once they're gone

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.520
people can repeat their experiments and debunk them and when they're not there to speak up who will

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.600
you see it it's coming very soon it's coming right now it's already happening right now

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.320
they're trying to put new people in front and those new people are dropping the ball

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:54.000
as we speak there's nobody that can take this mantle because even if this guy were to dare to

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.920
do an interview with me which he won't the people that the surrogates that they are putting in front

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:07.040
of these people to try and and and and put a lid on this discussion the surrogates have only two

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:12.720
choices they either have to be extreme no virus people or they have to be extreme virus people

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.800
and so the two kinds of people that have opposed this idea since we proposed it

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:28.080
in general terms have been the no virus people and have been people from the the extreme molecular

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:38.000
biology like like buckholtz and and kevin mccernan and so for me it's just it's just more

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:45.520
more support for the idea that what giga ohm biological has done what mark kulak and what

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.400
jessica hockett and nick hudson and and jonathan angler and the few people who have been

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:56.160
really repeating over and over again what happened in 2020 what were you doing in 2020 why didn't you

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:02.880
say this in 2020 what in the world went on in 2020 what in the world went on in 2020 the only

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.520
people that are asking that are the people that you can't see that you can't hear that are not

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:14.480
amplified that are not getting anywhere the only people who don't want to forget 2020 are us

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.720
everybody else wants to forget 2020 i've got david boltimore wants you to forget 2020

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:26.160
tony fauci wants you to forget 2020 rann paul wants you to forget 20 the only thing they want

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:32.160
you to think about in 2020 was the theater the acting the lab league cover up now you can talk

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:39.040
about that all you want but if you scrutinize what all these people were doing in 2020 you will

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:45.280
find liars you will find people who seeded the worst case scenario about a lab leak about it

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.440
about it can't let this go endemic that we've got to go for zero covid that we need 60 days lockdown

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.880
how many of these people have ever visited the pope how many of these people are connected to

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.000
the vatican how many of these people are connected to weaponized piles of money

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.520
once you ask questions like that you see that they all are

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:10.400
none of these people are putting their family and their livelihoods on the line none of these

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:17.040
people have lost a job actually none of these people have actually lost a house they've even

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:24.720
lied about losing houses that they actually sold for a profit that's the depth and the breadth of

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.560
this operation these people are governing us by lies and it was before the pandemic that's why

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.480
lying about the pandemic isn't as extreme as you might assume it would be

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.120
they were lying before the pandemic so to continue to lie into the pandemic is not that big a deal

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.480
it's just the same shtick because it's part of the same governing structure

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.400
and the only way that you could get this guy to make such a lame video like this

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.400
and to edit it twice would because they knew they had to set this up just like they were setting up

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.080
the lady from mit to give lectures about prions

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:10.080
because all of this biology needed to be in place needed to be well understood amongst the

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:15.040
academic academicians out there so that if they had questions they could find these videos

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:21.840
and so that other creators could make their own videos about their shirt their certainty

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.160
about prions and their certainty about the spike protein and their certainty about the novel coronavirus

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.760
that's why this was made in 2018 it wasn't for educational purposes it was part of the set up

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:45.440
make no mistake about it they put hundreds and hundreds of videos out there as part

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:51.360
of the setup they put tens if not hundreds of creators out there as part of the setup and the

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.560
ones that that caught on were supported the ones that were not did not caught on maybe they weren't

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.840
but they put a lot of extra out there and whatever stuck to the wall they went with

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:14.800
all kinds of worst case scenario actors tenured ones and non-tenured ones fringe and non-fringe

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.720
everywhere you cannot underestimate how many people they set up in order to make sure that

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:25.600
regardless of where the narrative went they would go where they wanted it to go with people that

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:32.640
either went along or were censored enough so that nobody saw them and i think if you look at my

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.120
personal track record i don't know we're just having a random stream here this morning if you

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.360
look at my personal track record i think what's best about it is that you can see that there were

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:48.560
very particular medlers that tried to co-opt me tried to make sure that i stayed on the lab leak

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.520
narrative that i got really excited about the lab leak cover up and i bought it hook line and

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.720
sinker for a very long time because they were very good at stroking my ego they were very good

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:04.000
at pretending that there were rivalries within this discussion that i was aware of or participating

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.440
in and people arguing and then wow i've got to choose which one of these two guys is right and

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.880
now i think i'm going to be friends with this guy because i don't like what this guy said

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:19.760
they did that to me behind the scenes not on social media on front but in signal chats where

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.000
people would argue about what i said and then storm out of the signal chat saying that nobody's

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.080
listening to me and then i would have to decide whether i like those people in the signal chat

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.960
or the guy that just left and if i chose the guy that i just left with then that guy would become

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.400
my friend for a little while and treat me and and lead me down another path and and waste my time

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.880
with another thing until suddenly i questioned that and then he would go online and say that i was

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:49.360
an idiot or block me and that happened a lot and i think a lot of these people got played like that

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.240
i think Peter McCullough is one of these people who basically can't tell you how many times he had

01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:00.400
a meeting with somebody who told him he got no choice that's why he looks scared that's why he

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.040
looks upset that's why he looks stressed because at first he said okay i'll go along with it because

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.040
it's worst case scenario and i don't know if worst case scenario is real or not but once he

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.800
figured out that they were lying about worst case scenario and how motivated they were to make

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:17.360
sure that worst case scenario set in and how much damage it was doing and how much they were willing

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:21.040
to lie about it he started to have second thoughts but where do you go

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:26.480
where is he supposed to go when he's already in front of everybody when they can make a phone call

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.320
and say hey peter you better get on that podcast or uh you know

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.160
you know that guy in Canada named plumber you should look him up would hate to have you fall

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:47.760
on a sidewalk that's that's the kind of stuff that we're dealing with here this is a national

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:54.000
security issue and they will pull out all stops in order to make sure that we have

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:01.040
complete compliance with the acceptance of what happened just like after 9-11 there will be no

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.720
tolerating alternative narratives and any alternative narrative will either be controlled

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:11.280
opposition or it will be completely banished from consciousness

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.600
and only released when it's time and so when we are dealing with the controlled demolition of

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:25.920
america i think that's what you're now seeing is that this narrative was intended to be used

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:30.720
as part of the demolition of america and the fact that they've lost control of the narrative

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.680
that they have not succeeded in getting us where they needed us to get so that we could get to the

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:41.360
next place they are in big trouble they are off the script and if we continue to push like

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:50.560
we're pushing now and we continue to learn how to how to articulate the right questions

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.720
which for example might be where does exosomal communication fit in the scheme of

01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:06.400
baltimore viruses where is it where do bacteriophages fit in the scheme of baltimore viruses

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:13.440
how many bacteriophage types are there in terms of the six kinds of viruses all these questions

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:18.400
are questions that are relevant to ask anybody that opens their mouth and says that they know

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:24.640
something about viruses you know if you worked for the human genome project all these years and now

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.280
you have a cannabis sequencing company and you also claim to know all kinds of things about

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.480
coronaviruses i'm kind of sketched out i don't think that's true i think it's really weird that you

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.920
would even care nevermind that you would attack someone to discredit someone to try to interfere

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:51.760
with their their relationship with their employer despite having you know millions of dollars in

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:58.320
your family and multiple companies between you and your brothers and a house on one of the

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:07.120
expensive most expensive plots of land in america that person actually chose to use their time and

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:13.840
energy on social media to attack someone who's renting their house in pittsburgh and wants to

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:20.240
talk about some of the alternative possibilities that this biology might represent you could just

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:25.520
ignore me you could just go play with your ten thousand dollar cats

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.160
but instead he chose to block me on twitter and then attack me on twitter then to call

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:41.360
and complain at my employer and about what that i was questioning the dogma of viruses that i

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.320
was questioning the fidelity of RNA virology

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:54.160
think about that and now that person has been in front of the united states senate talking about

01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:06.560
dna contamination along with his buddies the robert melones and the the harvey rashes

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:15.920
and the piercories and the the jessica roses that have all done very well

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:20.720
in terms of financial independence world travel

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.800
fame and fortune during the course of the pandemic despite not really doing anything

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.680
despite not really accomplishing anything despite not giving any solutions to anyone

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.560
despite just getting a lot of money

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.240
they've not lost any jobs

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.200
if they did they lost a job and then started a business and now that business is hopping

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.120
i'm still relying on a guy by the name of greg james to be generous enough to give

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:06.640
me another donation in a month or or steffin colan to give me another donation in a month

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:11.920
i've got like two or three people that my family relies on their generosity alone

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:15.840
and then about a hundred people that that give me maybe ten dollars a month

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:23.600
and that's it i don't have thirty five five thousand or fifty five thousand or a hundred

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.040
thousand subscribers on sub stack give me five dollars each i don't have a wellness company

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:35.360
paying me to plug their their uh emergency kit i don't have an energy drink

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.240
i don't have anything mark doesn't have that mark is supported by his viewers

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.880
what you need to see ladies and gentlemen is this is the time right now where we need to rise up

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:59.040
and we need to choose who we elevate and yes i am arguing that we should start elevating

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:06.000
actually working hard to get the giga ohm biological stream to be financially successful

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.160
not just for my family and because i like doing what i'm doing but because we're doing what's right

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.480
because we're saying what needs to be said and if we're going to be resilient enough to keep

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:25.040
saying it in the coming months and the coming years then we're going to need to be a hell of a

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:32.640
lot more than a family of five who can barely make rent when we're up against people that can

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:39.120
travel the world when we're up against people who live in multiple countries with multiple passports

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:45.440
and they can go to Oslo to promote their book because it just got translated into Norwegian

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:55.120
that can go on on on cruises off the coast of turkey to discuss the strategy with other dissidents

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:05.440
whose husband and wife have been in and out of the the biosecurity apparatus for 20 years and now

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:14.720
claim to be some kind of conservative patriots they're all liars and there are very very few people

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.360
really fighting for our grandchildren around the world

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.680
my message the other day was that americans have to fight for america and dutch have to fight for

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:29.440
nataland and and english people have to fight for england and that canadians have to fight for

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:34.240
canada and that's definitely true it doesn't mean we can't all support each other it doesn't mean

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:40.320
we can't all talk to one another but it does mean that there's not a lot i can do to help

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.960
canadians other than to say go get them there's not a lot i can do to dutch people

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:51.520
than to say kamador there's not a lot i can say to the people in south africa except for

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.040
you know should support nick hudson

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.320
and there's not a lot i can say to americans except you should listen to jessica hockett's

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:08.720
questions you should go to mark kulek's website and start reading and you should share this stream

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:14.720
especially the streams that hit you the hardest because these messages this information and

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.960
these questions need to be asked shared and passed around until they change the world

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:31.520
that's how important this is that the world sees david baltimore as the fraud that he is

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:39.360
sees the baltimore classification system as the fraud that it is and sees the simplification

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:47.840
of our own biology has been dna to rna through a ribosome to proteins has been a horrible simplification

01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.520
a malevolent simplification of our irreducible complexity

01:50:52.080 --> 01:51:02.000
i want everyone to see that that is the overarching goal of giga ohm biological to restore the

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.400
reverence for the sacred biology by actually redefining it to be defining it the right way

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:14.720
as to what it really is rather than you know we're really simple and everything around us is

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:23.200
really scary and complicated no we are the most beautiful and complex expression

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:33.360
of a pattern integrity that mother nature has ever conceived and all the machinery that surrounds

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.720
us in nature is likely represented in some form inside of our own pattern integrity and that's

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:44.880
what makes us so exceptional we are nature's gain of function it doesn't get any better than

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:52.480
this we are nature's swiss watch so there's no reason to believe that we don't use jeweled pivots

01:51:52.480 --> 01:52:00.400
only only viruses are smart enough to use ruby pivots in their watches we just use quartz

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:10.160
even though we are the most beautiful the culmination of of millions of years of evolution according

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:16.960
to these people we are very much less sophisticated than our our tiny little pathogenic neighbors

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:26.160
the viruses and that that virus was a retrovirus like the tumor viruses that up to then were the

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:37.760
only ones known so it's been particularly gratifying to me that this discovery has reverberated down

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:44.640
through time in so many different ways and it really speaks to the importance of basic research

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:55.280
so we look at the life cycle of a retrovirus any retrovirus what it does is to make its way

01:52:55.280 --> 01:53:02.800
into a cell by fusing to the surface so you see the the very very basic cartoon is that this

01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:09.520
comes from somewhere outside of you and then does this and the only bamboozlement that needs to be

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:16.000
here is that we don't do this none of our cells do this they only do it when they're forced to do

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:24.880
it by a retrovirus a much simpler more parsimonious and beautiful explanation would be

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.280
that our own body uses retroviruses and occasionally there are pathogenic

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:38.800
signals erroneous signals in this regime and our body is challenged to avoid that problem

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.960
has evolved to avoid that problem but if you intramuscularly inject retroviruses from another

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:52.960
species you might have some problems but of course that's not here this has nothing to do with how

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.120
do the retroviruses get in these people that's just from gasex and needles

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:04.960
special needles right needles with vaccines in them i think but anyway

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.880
this is it this is it right here this is the the start of the cartoon show

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:19.040
this is a cell and popping the core of the virus into the cell itself there that core

01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:28.080
acts as an enzyme to make a DNA copy of the RNA in the virus that in turn integrates itself

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:33.920
great question pamela what if exposure to a chemical or a toxin causes this signal to become

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:39.360
pathogenic that's totally plausible but we're not gonna we're not going to spend one dime of

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.200
grant money we're not going to write one grant call about that or we're not going to fund one

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.680
grant application that would propose to study that of course not of forming what's called the

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:57.040
pro virus and the pro virus then acts as a template to make proteins or to make RNA to make proteins

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.040
and those proteins come together to form new virus particles that bud out from the surface of

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:11.680
the cell and become a free living virus looking for a new potential host it's a very interesting

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:19.120
life cycle because the virus is actually finding its way into the chromosomes of the cell turning

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:29.280
itself from a free living virus into genes of the cell and that is a unique and remarkable way of

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:37.200
the virus hiding out allowing its transmission from one cell to the next cell he wants you to

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.240
believe that only viruses can do that we don't have any machinery that might for example be

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:49.280
able to take a gene from one T cell and send it to another T cell that would never happen

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000
that's ridiculous we wouldn't even want to ask that question it couldn't be that the 30 odd

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.480
independent cell types in the immune system communicate with a wide variety of RNA viruses

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.960
and also retro but that would be ridiculous it wouldn't it would be ridiculous to think that

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:12.560
any of our healthy tissues would communicate with retro viruses or with with RNA by that would be

01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:21.200
insane the Baltimore classification system says that the tools necessary for retroviral activity

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:29.440
are exclusively outside of us are exclusively viral just like the tools for RNA exosomes are

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:38.080
exclusively outside of us they are the monopoly is held by RNA viruses it's just a magnificent

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:44.800
it's a magnificent mythology so the next cell without the virus having to do anything because

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:53.040
every time the cell duplicates it duplicates the pro-viral DNA here it is budding off the surface

01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:03.520
of a cell and so let me just talk for a minute about how awful the AIDS epidemic has been

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:14.720
how powerful HIV has been this these are statistics from 2005 and I put them in here because that

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:21.520
was sort of the peak of the epidemic by that time 65 million people had been infected all around

01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:30.640
the world the bulk in Africa there were 25 million who had been killed by the virus 40 million people

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:37.840
were living with HIV many in India many in China but so let's make sure we understand that these

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:42.480
are all estimates they are not that they tested millions of people and confirmed that they had

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:54.720
antibodies to AIDS keep that in mind the bulk in in Africa there were at that time 13,000 infections

01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:08.080
per day for five million people infected every year it was a really devastating epidemic for

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:16.080
the world now if we look at it now or at 2015 when the last statistics were available

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:27.600
we see is a epidemic that is waning some but still really serious so by now 75 million people have

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:35.840
been infected 35 million have been killed and there are still on the order of 40 million people

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:47.360
living with AIDS I've shown the 2005 numbers in parentheses but there are now as opposed to 2005

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:56.800
18 million people on anti-retrovirals chemicals that prevent the growth of retroviral of retrovirus

01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:01.440
I should have like a cha-ching sound for that like not the ding but like you know a cash register

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:10.800
sound there and those people are largely very healthy and are also not transmitting virus

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:16.240
because the virus has been knocked down so effectively and that's part of the reason why

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:23.840
transmissions are down so the number of infections is now about 50% of what it was

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:35.680
the number dying is only 30% of what it was and these retrovir anti-retrovirals are making

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:43.360
all the difference but they're extremely expensive even expensive in Africa although much cheaper

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:50.800
than here they're there why would they be cheaper in Africa that's so odd that's just sad I don't

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:56.400
know what to say and it's increasing the lifespan of people who are infected it's lowering the

01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:04.960
infection rates but it's not clear that it is the final answer final answer would be to make a

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:13.600
vaccine that could prevent the transmission of of HIV and we many many other people in the

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.880
community are working on finding a way to vaccinate people but this virus as opposed to

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:27.920
any other virus has been recalcitrant to our attempts to make a a vaccine

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:37.920
so HIV is the classic non-equilibrium virus it's as I say endemic and African monkeys

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:45.360
it got a foothold in the human populations maybe 90 years ago for a long time it was

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:55.360
found only in villages in Africa then as as transportation became more and more it's weird

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.680
that Luke Montignet doesn't agree with the idea that you know you didn't really need to give

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:05.840
them retrovirus you need to give them clean water and nutrition it's very funny very very funny

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:12.000
this is not so cut and dry and don't forget how many people died on weird airplanes that

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:19.760
knew us stuff about AIDS like all of the Dutch experts in HIV died on one airplane that flew

02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:27.040
over the Ukraine and got shot remember that that's not that's not random there was also

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:32.480
an AIDS expert in Canada who died a rather weird death that I think Mark Koolack could

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:38.640
tell you a little bit about there's even a lady who worked for him that also had like a three

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.280
antibody cocktail that was working really well that that somehow just disappeared right before

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.000
the beginning of the pandemic there's a lot of interesting things out there that are omitted

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.800
from the big story that there's double-stranded DNA in the shots and we should get mad about it

02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:01.280
commonly used to take people from one continent to another it's seeded the other continents

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:10.240
and became a worldwide epidemic it grows in one of the key cell types of our immune system and so

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.360
it actually knocks out our immune systems and that's what why it's a lethal virus and this is I think

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:24.160
the main argument that I would use to say that it's very unlikely that our T cells would be vulnerable

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:31.920
to retroviruses unless they used them unless retroviruses were part of the normal T cell signal

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:38.800
and then we expose them to related retroviruses from related species and then that path that

02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:45.840
that's pathogenic that I can believe that causing some kind of semi-transmissible

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:52.240
symptomology disruption of the immune system I totally can understand that that's possible

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.400
it's possible especially if those aberrant signals end up expressing inside of that

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:04.160
host immune system and throw the whole thing off that signal could be a contaminating signal if

02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:10.320
you're if you share blood I don't see why not because again we're talking about a retrovirus so if

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:16.720
if those retrovirus signals are specifically a mechanism by which one T cell can amplify a

02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:21.760
genetic signal and many other T cells well that's a pretty powerful way to regulate the immune system

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:29.680
that if you just you know haphazardly exposed it to other related T cell signals from another

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:35.760
species you can permanently screw up the signaling of someone's immune system so much so that maybe

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.840
their immune system could screw up the immune system with somebody else's I don't know

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:47.280
but the idea that these retroviruses exist separate from us and are capable of sneaking in

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:53.600
and doing things to T cells that they don't already have the machinery for doesn't make any sense

02:03:53.600 --> 02:04:00.720
you can't make a cuckoo clock make toast you can't make a T cell make retroviruses when it

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:05.760
doesn't already use retroviruses for something else that just doesn't make biological sense to me

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:16.960
when it makes a lot more sense that that would be a vulnerability given intramuscular injection

02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:21.680
of certain combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system being dumb

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.480
another reason why I don't think they want to go back to that general statement ever why none of

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:36.560
these cowards that that claim to be arguing with me or debunking me will address the main messages

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:42.720
of this stream because the main messages are untouchable transfection is criminally negligent

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:48.080
in healthy humans RNA cannot pandemic an intramuscular injection of any combination

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:52.880
of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is just as dumb as it seems

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.680
we die of some infection not of HIV infection

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:08.560
isn't that another argument to say that wow so then why don't we get cancer when we have AIDS

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.800
why doesn't cancer go bananas when we have AIDS maybe because the T cells aren't really wiped out

02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:20.240
they're down regulated because it's a signal that they kind of understand and afterwards you see

02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:23.360
it's just it's not the same thing as a pathogen

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:37.040
and with that I finished with this discussion of viruses and of HIV

02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:44.880
and there it is I saw I didn't even know it was gonna end I just finished the discussion of HIV

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:50.880
and viruses are you sold watch the first part from yesterday are you sold I don't think I am I

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:57.920
mean it's really it's really very extraordinary where we are because that is the extent to which

02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:05.360
that's the extent to which we are expected to accept this stuff we are we are intended to accept

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:11.440
it at face value there's the Baltimore classification system those enzymes are not found in you you

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:18.160
just have a very simple pathway from DNA to RNA to through a ribosome to proteins and that can go

02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:23.520
wrong and it can be prions and that's it there's nothing more to understand because all the other

02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:30.320
special ways the DNA and RNA and proteins can come to exist are all monopolized by the scheme of

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:39.920
viruses called the Baltimore classification system I'm really convinced that this is not right I'm

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:45.280
really really convinced that this is not right and that was not how I was supposed to do those buttons

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.440
I think that the principle of informed consent requires understanding and I don't think they've

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:56.160
allowed us to understand what's going on I think that they have been manipulating us since the

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:02.720
before the pandemic since the early 20s as Edward Bernays so nicely revealed I think that what they

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:06.960
have done is tricked us into solving a mystery about a bad cave or a gain a function virus and

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:12.000
by doing so we've accepted that a novel virus is responsible for all these excess deaths and

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.080
all this suffering and all these bad decisions when in reality that mystery was the operation

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:27.760
that mystery solving exercise that eventually became from a cartoon to the the the CBS and PBS

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:34.000
NewsHour that was the operation that was the mystery solving operation that got you to accept

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.480
that there was a novel virus that killed millions of people and it's that that they are lying about

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:44.240
they are lying about it because when in reality it wasn't a novel virus but it was novel protocols

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.680
it was feared uncertainty and doubt it was do not resuscitate orders it was encouraging people to

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:54.560
use pulse oximeters that were sold on Amazon as an indication of whether or not they had the novel

02:07:54.560 --> 02:08:00.640
virus they were the use of ventilators to stop spread the lack of antibiotic use because you know

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:06.000
viral pneumonia doesn't respond to it the use of the poor use of steroids the use of remdesivir

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000
and medazolam to confuse and kill the opioid deaths that were allowed to go crazy and to flood

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.360
our streets with these drugs and not care and all to drive up the all-cause mortality so that

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:23.600
they could point to it on TV as being the novel virus and anything that that was misconstrued as

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.400
not being the virus would be said to be the rush or the lockdown or the crisis or the mistakes that

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:33.840
we made and not have anything to do with the financial incentives that caused the fraud in the first

02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.640
place never to do a tracking trace and masks and closures it all implied a danger that wasn't

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.840
there not about the molecular fraud that took place around the world to indicate the spread

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.960
that was probably just a hot background or a combination of a hot background and bad specificity

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:56.880
we're supposed to exclusively focus now on the botched response and the botched countermeasures

02:08:56.880 --> 02:09:02.000
and that's what these people's job was that's why they've been touring the world for three or four

02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:06.400
years that's why they've been giving all these talks with the same people traveling with the

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:11.600
same groups that always seem to be organized by Robert Malone all the time every guest list is

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.320
the Robert Malone guest list and the only time they ever invented ever invited

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:23.360
Daddy Rancor was to Romania where no one would hear it no one would see it and they could control

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.320
the response and so when they came back from Romania they told everybody that wow Daddy Rancor

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:34.400
smart he seems to think that 17 million people were hurt by the shot and they completely ignore

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.960
that Denny Rancor also said that there's no evidence of a spreading risk additive pathogen

02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:44.320
which means there was no pandemic they lied about it and after that months and months later

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:50.400
they came in front of the Senate and still told the exact same story these people who wrote a

02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:56.000
wrote blog posts about Denny Rancor's data about the shot and ignored his data about the lack of

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.760
spread are still ignoring the data that shows there's no spreading pathogen in New York or

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:08.560
anywhere else they are ignoring the dominance of protocols and murder and fraud and misleading

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:13.760
numbers and they are exclusively focused on the novel virus that killed millions of people and

02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:21.440
the spot response to it being a mistake so that you will accept that RNA can pandemic that you

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:26.000
will tell that story to your kids and you will tell the story that transfection was rushed but it

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.720
kind of worked and so i'm assuming that this RSV vaccine or this flu vaccine that they want to

02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.960
give you to get on a college campus it probably works the reality is is that transfection was

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:42.000
always criminally negligent and it remains so and the reality is is that RNA can't pandemic

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.640
and infectious clones the methodology that's used to create RNA virology as a field in the first place

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:55.520
explains how the lie was created and why they had to have so many aspects of the lie around the

02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:03.120
world in order to get away with it the lie has been codified in books one of which i participated

02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:08.080
in writing but if you look at all of the quotes that i have in that book you will find that this

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:13.200
truth is revealed that they lied about it that they didn't need a virus that they never needed a

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:23.040
virus they always knew it wouldn't work that's the reality they lied about it

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:30.160
they kidnapped our kids and they lied about it they have had a teamwork case scenario in place

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.320
since the very beginning to make sure that we would never question the right things and that's

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:38.480
why this stream is so important that's why this hypothesis is so important because i think they

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.440
lied about the molecular biology in very understandable and explainable ways using very

02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:49.920
understandable and explainable methodologies to confound a background signal into a spreading

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:56.000
novel pathogen that they knew was not there and if it was there it was there and placed by them

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.640
using an infectious clone they've had this plan to invert our sovereignty for quite some time

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.000
just very aggressively gone for it so ladies and gentlemen this is for all the marbles thank you

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.960
very much for joining me if you want to share this stream or subscribe you can go to giggleandbiological.com

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.000
i will probably not be on this afternoon again but i will definitely be on tomorrow at 10 10 in

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.320
the morning thank you very much for joining me this has been giggle and biological a high resistance

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:38.240
low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

02:12:53.280 --> 02:13:06.240
it is it totally is sound like cause list it's right

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:17.680
i'll show you it is totally is going back there it is right there pulse oximeters and O2 you see

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:24.000
right there i even have it in different uh different print because it's a new edition it's

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.360
definitely there see it love you guys thanks a lot see you tomorrow

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:44.640
yeah it is the lawn lore stream i apologize i think my woman started lowering if she likes to

02:13:44.640 --> 02:14:02.400
m all alone

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.640
You
