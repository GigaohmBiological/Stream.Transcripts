WEBVTT

00:26.789 --> 00:29.250
It is much more likely it's a lab leak.

00:33.452 --> 00:37.953
Viral phylogenists and molecular virologists would disagree with you.

00:38.373 --> 00:39.874
I believe it's a lab leak.

00:46.894 --> 00:59.544
In case you missed it, ladies and gentlemen, I was on Kim Iverson's show last night, which, when I woke up this morning, had 137,000 views, which doesn't really even seem to be possible.

01:00.285 --> 01:08.351
We're talking about several orders of magnitude more people have heard some of our work than probably have ever heard it before in the last four years.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.363
There's reason for hope.

01:11.443 --> 01:12.724
There's reason to get excited.

01:12.764 --> 01:15.065
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.827
I'm a biologist out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:18.327 --> 01:20.309
I'm coming to you live out of the back of my garage.

01:21.229 --> 01:23.270
Occasionally, you'll hear a little blower in the background.

01:23.290 --> 01:27.333
That's because there's still a heater in here, and it's actually cold this morning.

01:27.753 --> 01:36.559
You can find my academic work on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, by using my last name and my first two initials, J and J.

01:37.961 --> 01:48.723
Dr. J can also be found in a whole list of papers having to do with COVID-19 because I was part of this group called drastic at the beginning of the pandemic and played a lot of

01:49.537 --> 01:53.900
played a large role in me going with the Lab League for so long.

01:53.940 --> 02:05.466
I've presented my understanding to Panda no less than three times, once to NCI, once to that group in Germany, once to the trustees of the wellness company.

02:06.207 --> 02:12.010
I was a staff scientist under Brian Hooker and Mary Holland at Children's Health Defense in 2023.

02:13.691 --> 02:23.677
And from 2022 and 2023, I was the scientific advisor for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States of America.

02:24.237 --> 02:27.419
And I helped him complete this book, The Wuhan Cover-Up.

02:27.919 --> 02:40.746
You can see a pretty good representation of the kind of stunned state that my family and I find myself in from the Red Pill Expo that I gave, the presentation that I gave on June 16th, 2024.

02:43.348 --> 02:47.513
And I am producing a biology basketball show in the background right now.

02:48.534 --> 02:51.037
It's one of the things that's really keeping me excited.

02:52.398 --> 03:02.570
If you like what you see and you want to see more, go to stream.gigaohm.bio.com You can also find my good friend Mark Kulak's work there under the Housatonic channel.

03:03.591 --> 03:08.253
If you want to communicate with us or start communicating with the viewers, you can go to GigaOM.bio.

03:08.773 --> 03:14.796
My wife, Phila, is about to be on that there as well, just kind of helping out with communicating.

03:15.276 --> 03:24.360
And finally, we do have a headquarters at GigaOMBiological.com where you can kind of span out and find all of this stuff, although those links are also available on GigaOM.bio.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.842
And we may transition slowly to GigaOM.bio being the headquarters headquarters.

03:30.282 --> 03:31.163
Good to see everybody.

03:31.363 --> 03:32.203
I'll be here in a minute.

03:35.625 --> 03:54.620
I don't care how you get there.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.343
I don't care what you do to get there.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.885
The goal is to win.

04:04.648 --> 04:05.589
What time is it?

04:05.649 --> 04:06.409
Game time!

09:21.021 --> 09:22.602
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

09:22.642 --> 09:23.582
Welcome to the show.

09:23.642 --> 09:26.204
A spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required.

09:26.244 --> 09:38.650
I'm going to explain to you why this one slide is probably enough to understand all the things that I was trying to tell Kim Iverson on her show and many times stumbled around and failed to do because what I'm trying to relay

09:40.720 --> 09:53.556
to people who are not in academic biology, were never in academic biology chasing tenure, is how few people would be required in order for this magic trick to be pulled off.

09:55.839 --> 09:59.083
I think we're really close to a critical breaking point.

10:00.124 --> 10:05.810
And so I want to keep working and keep working on trying to bring people to understand the big picture.

10:05.970 --> 10:12.616
Also because I've been encouraged to do this by some of my closest advisors.

10:13.537 --> 10:19.001
People that I trust have given me some tips and I'm going to go forward with those tips right now today.

10:19.582 --> 10:27.230
Because I think it's really important to separate myself from these charlatans and keep focused on that biology.

10:27.290 --> 10:38.142
We always go through this same reiteration on this show where we talk about people and then we talk about their ideas and then we focus on their ideas and then we have to remind you that these people are the people that

10:38.723 --> 11:01.969
that lied to us about these ideas and so I think this time could be different because they have enlisted people who are unwittingly participating and so the whole thing could shatter based on the idea that a lot of these people really didn't expect it to be this long and so I have a lot of hope that we can crack this by simply breaking some of these people but on the other hand

11:02.569 --> 11:04.291
Maybe we don't even need to worry about that.

11:04.351 --> 11:10.035
Maybe we can focus on history and biology and the truth and loving your neighbor.

11:10.676 --> 11:21.585
And that will result in the exact same thing that we all agree is the goal, which is people learning biology and the people who should have known better being held responsible.

11:22.046 --> 11:27.911
And so again, let's seek truth together so that we can dispel the illusion that actually requires our participation.

11:28.411 --> 11:30.613
Remember that intramuscular injection is dumb.

11:31.013 --> 11:36.016
Remember that transfection in healthy people would have been a crime five to ten years ago.

11:36.036 --> 11:38.358
An RNA cannot pandemic.

11:38.418 --> 11:45.943
This three-word phrase is the one that all the academic biologists that happen to stumble upon this stream need to consider deeply.

11:47.024 --> 11:55.610
If they had asked you this on your oral exam, can an RNA molecule go from a mud puddle to all of the white-tailed deer in North America?

11:56.110 --> 11:58.690
and all the lungs of all of the primates on earth?

11:59.091 --> 12:00.571
The answer would be no, of course.

12:02.691 --> 12:06.812
Ladies and gentlemen, I think the truth is available, and it's a scary one.

12:07.592 --> 12:08.612
The truth is the U.S.

12:08.652 --> 12:13.113
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise, and they've known that for a long time.

12:13.913 --> 12:21.034
And maybe they were never intending on this kind of knowledge to become general, but I think it's about to.

12:21.534 --> 12:24.335
It's about to become well understood by the world

12:25.575 --> 12:32.117
that actually a huge con, a long con has been running for some time.

12:32.157 --> 12:34.718
I'm really excited to see everybody in the chat.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.039
I'm really, really happy to be here.

12:37.119 --> 12:39.059
This is GigaOM Biological.

12:39.079 --> 12:41.900
Let me switch over here to the desk.

12:44.061 --> 12:44.841
Whoa, I don't need you.

12:46.302 --> 12:47.142
Good morning, everybody.

12:47.202 --> 12:51.145
It's Gagoan Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by Biologists.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.587
It's the 21st of March, 2025.

12:53.987 --> 13:04.175
First and foremost, to my sister from another mother, I'm sorry you're not here to see this stream, but happy birthday, Brandy Vaughn.

13:05.896 --> 13:10.060
I'm sure we would have been best friends had we ever been able to meet in person and

13:12.481 --> 13:15.062
Yeah, anyway, happy birthday to Brandy Vaughn.

13:16.183 --> 13:18.104
This is for all the marbles.

13:18.584 --> 13:20.085
It's for your grandchildren.

13:20.105 --> 13:23.287
And so I know this is a hard message.

13:23.347 --> 13:26.108
It's not a message for everyone, but it is a message of hope.

13:26.329 --> 13:28.450
And it is a message for anyone that's willing to

13:29.230 --> 13:31.311
open their mind long enough to understand.

13:32.292 --> 13:48.363
A friend of mine expressed it very aptly by saying that when you're in a maze and you keep finding the same ends, you really only have one choice but to move backwards toward the beginning and try to start all over.

13:49.503 --> 13:53.326
And in this case, I think there's a lot of people, there are a lot of people who have been

13:53.923 --> 14:02.455
led to run into the maze, headlong and blind, and have now found themselves in a very nasty little trap of dead ends.

14:03.116 --> 14:10.286
And if you continue to search these dead ends, you will be in this maze forever, and more importantly, your kids will be.

14:11.424 --> 14:25.190
And it's important that we go back to the beginning, go back to the beginning where these ideas came from, where these impetuses came from, and to understand them on timescales that are far, far longer than social media wants you to focus on.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.471
That's why I say it's about the grandchildren of Earth.

14:28.111 --> 14:40.196
We need to be focused, for example, in my humble opinion, on making sure that our grandchildren do not know what social media is or understand it as something that was really ridiculous.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.656
And thank goodness our parents got rid of it.

14:45.297 --> 14:46.478
Or our grandparents did.

14:47.998 --> 14:52.360
So the murder and lies part of this story, I'm going to switch down here to the bottom.

14:53.321 --> 14:54.281
Pardon me for a second.

14:55.242 --> 14:55.962
Do this and this.

14:58.103 --> 15:04.670
The murder and lies part of this, which I try to summarize very succinctly as saying that pure oxygen causes ARDS.

15:05.311 --> 15:19.706
So from the very beginning of the pandemic, even when we didn't have testing, we were already running out of ventilators and we were already supplying New York City with as much oxygen as the oxygen plant on the ship Comfort could provide.

15:20.767 --> 15:30.592
And this oxygen was being applied very willy-nilly, as adequately described by Kyle Seidel in his videos on YouTube.

15:30.612 --> 15:32.513
60 liters a minute were applied.

15:33.893 --> 15:47.580
And so pure oxygen can cause acute damage, lung damage, called acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is also the exact same set of symptoms that is often associated with the SARS-1 virus and now the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

15:48.120 --> 16:01.585
The second thing to understand is that PCR as applied in 2020, 21, 22 was never a useful diagnostic tool and very well could have been a legitimate thing picking up a legitimate background signal that was always there.

16:02.506 --> 16:13.170
And that would have been enough to provide all of the necessary background signal to enact what has now become an absolute disaster.

16:14.309 --> 16:34.127
And the basis of that was, and can be found on the 2020 and 2021 TWIV streams with Dr. Griffin and Dr. Vincent Racaniello, because those two guys talk regularly for almost two years straight about how antibiotics are very inappropriate for a viral syndrome.

16:34.547 --> 16:36.609
And so anybody with COVID, if they have

16:37.009 --> 16:50.463
a urinary tract infection or pneumonia should not be willy-nilly treated with antibiotics, but instead should be treated with things that are antivirals, like Remdesivir or any of these other drugs that they were testing.

16:52.099 --> 16:58.882
And so the debate about the repression of early treatment and this kind of thing was part of this hamster wheel.

16:59.242 --> 17:16.549
And all of the questions that we were asking, all of the debates we were having about the toxicity of the spike protein, or whether or not this was a lab leak, and they were covering it up completely did not ask any of the most relevant questions like, why are people really dying in hospitals?

17:21.792 --> 17:26.717
And so why murder and lies is actually the big question here, right?

17:26.757 --> 17:38.369
Because I've been focused mostly on trying to get you to see the monster, try to get you to see the malfeasance, try to understand why these people are liars and showing you all examples of how they've lied to me.

17:38.409 --> 17:43.154
And it comes off very much like to a lot of people, like I'm whining.

17:43.888 --> 17:51.442
But for me, it's kind of just processing the amount of betrayal and also regularly reassuring myself that I'm not crazy.

17:52.421 --> 17:58.324
But what's interesting about this is that the sort of goal has already been there in the background.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.806
It's always in my intro.

18:01.866 --> 18:09.671
And I sometimes feel as though it goes without saying that you must understand why they are murdering and lying about it.

18:09.751 --> 18:10.811
But apparently it's not.

18:10.911 --> 18:20.337
And so because I think it's something that maybe Kim would also wanna know or her viewers would also wanna know, I will point out again that in the beginning of all of my

18:21.078 --> 18:27.196
shows for a very long time now, I've had this slide which kind of graphically depicts world population.

18:28.659 --> 18:35.981
And it suggests that there is only one chance in history to collect the data they need for their God to solve all of humanity's problems.

18:36.461 --> 18:38.962
And then the slide pivots to their AI.

18:39.782 --> 18:46.124
Now, I use the term AI here, the abbreviation for artificial intelligence, loosely here.

18:46.564 --> 18:50.525
I do not think it is an appropriate set of words to describe

18:51.625 --> 18:53.307
machine learning algorithms.

18:54.268 --> 19:08.460
Instead, I think it is one of these kinds of semantic enchantments that is also ubiquitous throughout public health and this whole impetus for world health initiatives.

19:09.080 --> 19:15.223
So the main trick to understand is that they bamboozle us with the language that they choose.

19:15.623 --> 19:21.706
And I've done a few shows where I've stolen other people's words to describe it and called it slave speak.

19:22.406 --> 19:24.027
AI is slave speak.

19:24.127 --> 19:29.810
If you use the term artificial intelligence, you're essentially accepting the idea

19:30.310 --> 19:39.252
that somewhere in the future there will be a thing worthy of calling artificial intelligence or even better general artificial intelligence.

19:43.393 --> 19:46.074
And so that's important to hear.

19:46.994 --> 19:56.257
I think that just like solving the game of Go, in fact that's why they spent so much time and so much energy describing to you

19:57.403 --> 20:06.172
the idea that they solved the game of chess by making chess computers play each other, and then they had enough games they could actually solve the problem.

20:06.192 --> 20:08.574
They could make an algorithm that was better than a human.

20:09.095 --> 20:12.938
Then they did it with the game Go, kind of, sort of.

20:14.640 --> 20:20.186
But what they're doing there is they're showing you, they're teaching you, they're telling our kids, what is the plan?

20:21.485 --> 20:37.088
And the only thing that they leave unspoken, because they say that in their private meetings and their private dinners while they're smoking cigars, is what the ultimate goal of such an AI, such a machine learning algorithm application would be.

20:37.148 --> 20:46.870
What's the ultimate goal there in the sense of, you can climb a big hill, you can climb a mountain, or you could climb the largest mountain on Jupiter,

20:48.297 --> 20:54.321
So you could put a machine learning algorithm on chess, or you could put it on Go.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.043
Go has got so many more permutations.

20:57.124 --> 20:58.905
It's a much harder game to solve.

20:59.305 --> 21:00.586
And wow, we solved it.

21:01.066 --> 21:05.610
Maybe we could put machine learning algorithms on the protein folding problem.

21:05.650 --> 21:13.716
And then when we solve that problem, we could give the guys who solved it using artificial intelligence a Nobel prize.

21:14.830 --> 21:31.589
And slowly but surely, the population of the world is starting to be convinced that AI is a really useful tool that can do all kinds of crazy things, you know, like read MRIs better than doctors can, or read x-ray scans better than doctors can.

21:33.123 --> 21:43.708
And this is all part of the enchantment to get people to accept the fact that the AI is so powerful and so wonderful and such a great resource that we should just surrender to it.

21:43.748 --> 21:50.951
That we should give all of our information and data to these people who will then turn around and use it for all of us.

21:51.551 --> 21:54.012
Use it for all future generations.

21:56.616 --> 22:22.962
Now, the important thing to understand here that I would never understand as well as I do if it wasn't for my collaboration with Mark Kulak is that these ideas and Uwe Altschner and a lot of other people through this run that have pointed out how long these ideas have been discussed in books like The Phenomenon of Man or The Survival of the Wisest or Man and His Future.

22:24.608 --> 22:53.321
And so you can see a direct mentor chain through these people as they've formulated a plan of action where eventually they would, as a ruling intelligent class, the survival of the wisest, as our friend Jonas Salk so eloquently states, would have control of and be the stewards of human evolution.

22:55.663 --> 23:03.831
Because up until now, we've just been kind of rambling through space and time, you know, with not any real good focus.

23:04.531 --> 23:15.462
You could almost hear in some of these books how they believe that selecting people and breeding people together to make smart, strong people, why would that be crazy?

23:18.047 --> 23:23.471
And these are the same mentors of the people who mentored the people who are in front of us now.

23:24.072 --> 23:38.924
And it isn't by coincidence, this direct lineage of ideas and mythologies requires this unbroken lineage, this unbroken mentorship.

23:40.051 --> 23:41.532
And so it's very important.

23:41.972 --> 23:43.473
What are the murder and lies for?

23:43.913 --> 23:54.199
They are part, they are for one of the largest, maybe the largest and most continuous human project imagined.

23:55.100 --> 24:00.223
Because people have been working on this human genome project for a couple generations now.

24:00.963 --> 24:07.767
Because before they knew what the genetic material was, they already knew they were going to find it.

24:14.011 --> 24:16.452
They already knew they were going to find it.

24:18.533 --> 24:22.114
And when they found it, they already knew what they were going to do with it.

24:23.154 --> 24:24.915
They already knew what they had to do with it.

24:25.015 --> 24:32.037
They imagined that they could learn a lot about DNA in the 50s if they just irradiated flies.

24:32.418 --> 24:37.379
They also imagined they could accelerate evolution because evolution was just mutation, right?

24:37.919 --> 24:41.621
These people haven't always known

24:42.788 --> 24:56.620
Except for the fact that they've always known that they want it all That they need it all That they need the control of the world of the species.

24:57.160 --> 25:08.850
Okay the species That's maybe the best way to say it they don't want control the world they want control of the species and so let's just

25:10.478 --> 25:12.539
Recall, this is a geneticist.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.380
This is a geneticist.

25:15.161 --> 25:16.282
This is a geneticist.

25:18.543 --> 25:20.844
This is a HIV virologist.

25:20.925 --> 25:23.746
This is a bioweapons expert.

25:23.906 --> 25:25.687
This is a vaccinologist.

25:25.768 --> 25:30.510
That is a computer scientist and glyphosate expert.

25:33.712 --> 25:37.615
Geneticist, geneticist, kinda geneticist, geneticist.

25:39.727 --> 25:47.649
descended from, I mean, direct descendant, direct descendant of the Human Genome Project.

25:49.589 --> 25:53.210
And they are both now kind of controlling this maha right.

25:53.230 --> 25:59.471
The genetic testing company 23andMe went from biotech superstar to the brink of collapse.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.712
Its most valuable asset might be its DNA data.

26:03.132 --> 26:08.693
NPR's Bobbie Allen reports on what might happen to the genetic information of millions of people.

26:09.284 --> 26:10.525
It was an idea that caught on.

26:10.725 --> 26:15.408
Pay about 100 bucks for a saliva kit, and weeks later, learn all about your ancestry.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.610
The company behind this, 23andMe, was a hit.

26:19.110 --> 26:26.214
It was worth billions, Oprah raved about it, and countless people took to social media to share their experience, like TikToker Danielle Edwards.

26:26.714 --> 26:28.055
Okay, I did it, y'all.

26:28.095 --> 26:30.437
I finally took my 23andMe kit.

26:31.757 --> 26:37.741
Don't forget, also, Joe Rogan talked about it all the time, and this was like a Google the sister of the YouTube person.

26:39.381 --> 26:39.921
in this tube.

26:40.262 --> 26:44.244
More than 14 million people spit in a 23andme tube.

26:44.264 --> 26:45.645
14 million spit parties.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.366
The company was part of the zeitgeist.

26:47.786 --> 26:50.028
But there was one big business problem.

26:50.328 --> 26:52.929
Nobody needed to do a 23andme test twice.

26:53.209 --> 26:54.390
It was one and done.

26:54.930 --> 26:57.352
And now 23andme's stock is worth pennies.

26:57.752 --> 27:00.534
Financial news networks like CNBC have been blaring the news.

27:00.894 --> 27:06.537
It has since lost 99.9% of its value from its $6 billion market cap peak.

27:06.677 --> 27:08.397
Then there were two other big blows.

27:08.737 --> 27:12.159
Last year, the company was hit with a major data breach of customer passwords.

27:12.439 --> 27:15.180
And last week, its entire board of directors resigned.

27:15.781 --> 27:21.063
Some analysts say 23andMe could go out of business by next year, which raises the question.

27:21.661 --> 27:24.784
What's going to happen with the genetic data it has from millions of people?

27:25.224 --> 27:28.146
Even if the company goes under, that data could change hands.

27:28.487 --> 27:29.808
That may surprise some customers.

27:30.088 --> 27:33.010
They might believe that the information is more protected than it actually is.

27:33.351 --> 27:34.251
That's Anya Price.

27:34.512 --> 27:38.875
She's a law professor at the University of Iowa's College of Law who focuses on genetic privacy.

27:39.496 --> 27:45.561
She says federal health privacy protections like HIPAA don't apply here, since 23andMe is outside of the health care realm.

27:46.101 --> 27:50.204
What the company does depends on what customers agreed to when they signed up for the service.

27:50.544 --> 27:54.568
Some states, like California and Florida, do give consumers rights over their genetic data.

27:54.888 --> 28:00.792
If customers are really worried, they could ask for their samples to be withdrawn from these databases under those laws.

28:01.052 --> 28:06.657
When I asked 23andMe what it plans to do with all the genetic data if it goes out of business, a spokesman wouldn't say.

28:07.077 --> 28:14.763
But he did mention a partnership with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, which has been analyzing the data to try to find medical breakthroughs.

28:15.774 --> 28:20.186
23andMe says 80% of customers opted into this kind of research when they signed up.

28:20.765 --> 28:22.306
Company says the data is anonymous.

28:22.926 --> 28:27.528
Prince thinks if people now are second guessing that decision, they might be out of luck.

28:27.768 --> 28:32.070
I couldn't go to GSK and say, hey, my sample was given to you.

28:32.090 --> 28:34.611
I want that taken out if it was anonymized, right?

28:34.631 --> 28:38.173
Because they're not going to reidentify it just to pull it out of the database.

28:38.293 --> 28:48.017
The 23andMe spokesman said the company is committed to being transparent with whatever happens to customer data, saying its core value is, quote, behind every data point is a human being.

28:48.577 --> 28:50.158
Bobby Allen, NPR News.

28:52.455 --> 28:54.036
So that I find very interesting.

28:54.096 --> 29:05.544
It's kind of mainstream understanding now that as much as 13 million genomes and the data associated with them is now free to use and available, maybe even already being shared.

29:06.704 --> 29:12.368
Or maybe Glasgow SmithKline is keeping it all to itself and selling it to the highest bidder behind the scenes.

29:14.530 --> 29:18.112
Or maybe part of the deal was to give it to the Human Genome Project anyway.

29:19.313 --> 29:20.874
Maybe the whole thing was just a scam.

29:21.806 --> 29:30.833
to get all those genomes, and as they said, when people stopped spitting in tubes, they just crashed the stock.

29:33.075 --> 29:33.936
And now what have they got?

29:34.136 --> 29:35.096
They got all their data.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.602
Now, this might seem like a trivial example, and it is.

29:42.742 --> 29:55.567
But I need you to understand from the perspective of what's actually trying to be accomplished and why the Human Genome Project actually goes on for as long as it does, why it extends all the way back to this.

29:56.287 --> 30:03.850
Because the whole premise was already understood, in my humble opinion, by a guy by the name of Joshua Lederberg.

30:03.890 --> 30:06.191
Joshua Lederberg already understood

30:07.171 --> 30:28.755
the complexity of the problem and already understood that the only way a pattern would be found is if all that data could be seen much like the only way that you can see a protein is if you make it pure and then allow it to crystallize in a perfect matrix so that you have so much of it arranged so perfectly that the signal is loud enough to see it.

30:29.847 --> 30:32.288
It's very similar to how they sequence DNA.

30:32.688 --> 30:40.131
Of course, there can be a pure sequence of a single molecule in a reaction, and you can sequence it, but the way that you sequence it is what?

30:40.571 --> 30:41.612
You make a lot of it.

30:43.192 --> 30:54.737
The whole impetus for PCR, from the perspective of these people early on, like Carey Mullis, was to make enough of a pure DNA molecule so that one could sequence it.

30:55.563 --> 31:06.591
They understood that a single molecule was not something they were ever going to invent a microscope big enough or a detector long enough to be able to read it accurately and go along it and record it.

31:07.752 --> 31:21.142
But they did know from proteins and from other experiments like crystals, that if they had enough of a pure molecule, then there might be signals there that would rise above the noise and create patterns that they could discern.

31:25.512 --> 31:31.037
And so now we are at a stage, ladies and gentlemen, understand we are at a stage where they need the data.

31:31.338 --> 31:33.440
They need to even understand how big is a genome?

31:34.140 --> 31:36.102
How much genome data is there really?

31:36.142 --> 31:37.324
How much do we want to store?

31:37.364 --> 31:40.447
That's one of the questions that the Human Genome Project was trying to answer.

31:40.827 --> 31:41.708
How do we store it?

31:41.768 --> 31:42.709
How do we collect it?

31:42.769 --> 31:43.450
How do we know?

31:43.870 --> 31:44.811
How do we verify?

31:46.380 --> 31:49.943
That's all part of this PCR application to sequencing.

31:49.983 --> 31:53.447
Almost all of this technology is PCR-based.

31:53.487 --> 31:54.267
Sequencing is.

31:54.648 --> 31:56.169
The PCR diagnostic is.

31:56.670 --> 32:00.573
Any kind of reconstruction of a genetic plasmid uses PCR.

32:01.074 --> 32:05.118
There are so many ways that PCR is used.

32:07.133 --> 32:17.760
in commercial and academic settings to do all these genetic tricks that you could almost say that a lot of what molecular biology is is just renaming PCR.

32:19.261 --> 32:21.302
Now, they need to store it.

32:21.363 --> 32:27.246
They need to store the data somewhere so that the computer, the machine learning algorithm here can access it.

32:28.047 --> 32:35.052
So depending on how big the database is, you know, the number of games of Go and how do you store that, its moves and its positions,

32:35.913 --> 32:41.016
You have to store that data, you have to store it in a uniform way, and then it has to be able to go through the machine learning.

32:41.576 --> 32:47.419
That problem has been solved numerous times with progressively larger problems.

32:49.033 --> 32:53.617
And now, for a long time already, they have been applying it to the human genome.

32:53.717 --> 33:02.424
I'm trying to understand how can we organize the data of a human genome so that we can compare it to another human genome.

33:02.784 --> 33:04.806
And to what extent is that possible?

33:05.266 --> 33:07.068
What kinds of things do we have to watch?

33:07.108 --> 33:09.470
This is not a trivial problem.

33:10.796 --> 33:13.578
This is a problem that's taken a couple decades to seize.

33:14.038 --> 33:20.682
And now, once you have that data, you can start to make predictions that can be validated.

33:21.223 --> 33:30.889
But we are nowhere near this stage because we don't even have the data stored in a way so that a machine learning algorithm can adequately access it and replay it.

33:32.550 --> 33:40.135
Because first, we need to collect the genetic data and learn how to interface it with medical data.

33:41.175 --> 33:43.838
And of course, that's going to be a huge waste of resources.

33:43.898 --> 33:53.510
It would be a lot better if our babies would just be sequenced at birth, and then all of their electronic medical data would always be correlated with their genetic data from birth to death.

33:54.211 --> 33:58.776
And that is the model that would be ideal in order to collect the data

33:59.457 --> 34:16.941
that they need to store and feed through the machine learning algorithm that will eventually make predictions that can be validated and we can start to work the magic that Joshua Lederberg predicted we'd be able to do when he formulated this idea a long time ago.

34:18.801 --> 34:20.221
So murder and lies for what?

34:20.582 --> 34:22.302
I really think it's for the data.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.843
Because only together can we seize the moment to defeat cancer.

34:27.941 --> 34:32.583
So today is about you, the fighters and the survivors.

34:32.603 --> 34:32.583
2016.

34:33.103 --> 34:40.206
The caretakers and the researchers, the philanthropists and the patient advocates.

34:41.107 --> 34:48.370
It's about the millions of Americans, their loved ones and all those around the world who are confronting cancer.

34:49.790 --> 34:54.172
It's about hope, but ultimately it's about action.

34:55.745 --> 35:07.409
Because of all of you and many others watching at home, we've made incredible progress this year, progress that Joe will talk about in detail.

35:09.870 --> 35:16.032
So now it's my pleasure to introduce a man of action, the man President

35:16.716 --> 35:21.418
Now, remember, we're not talking about whether this is the real Joe Biden or not.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.418
But I think this is definitely the real Joe Biden.

35:24.458 --> 35:25.519
That's the real Jill.

35:26.039 --> 35:27.659
And I think we've always had the real Jill.

35:27.679 --> 35:29.740
But when I listen to this, but it's funny.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.961
But don't worry about that now.

35:32.001 --> 35:34.642
What I want you to worry about is what he says about four minutes in.

35:39.163 --> 35:45.065
Gina McCarthy, EPA, Dr. Francis Collins, NIH director and the guy who

35:45.945 --> 35:51.047
is most responsible for the Human Genome Project, an incredible achievement all by itself.

35:52.208 --> 35:59.371
The National Cancer Institute Director, Doug Lowery, who has been a great, great ally and educator of mine.

36:00.412 --> 36:02.713
FDA Administrator, Robert Califf.

36:02.873 --> 36:04.994
Anne McCarthy, EPA.

36:05.714 --> 36:08.816
My husband, our Vice President, Joe Biden.

36:22.347 --> 36:31.853
Gina McCarthy, EPA, Dr. Francis Collins, NIH director and the guy who is most responsible for the Human Genome Project.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.275
Incredible achievement all by itself.

36:35.416 --> 36:38.758
The National Cancer Institute director, Doug Lowey, who has

36:39.642 --> 36:42.663
has been a great, great ally and educator of mine.

36:43.703 --> 36:59.788
FDA Administrator, Robert Califf, and Acting Administrator for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Andy Slavitt, and Tyler Jacks, Elizabeth Jaffe, the co-chairs of the Blue Ribbon Commission.

37:00.548 --> 37:06.370
I wish I could, and the public deserves to know every one of you in this room.

37:07.372 --> 37:20.339
And I mean every one of you, because you're the ones that have done such remarkable work to date, and you're the ones that are going to be responsible for what I believe will be an enormous amount of progress we'll make soon.

37:21.300 --> 37:31.126
First of all, when Barack Obama asked me to head up this moonshot, there were some skeptics out there that said, well, here we go again.

37:31.966 --> 37:33.907
Nixon declared a war on cancer in 1971.

37:33.947 --> 37:34.648
There's a big difference.

37:37.424 --> 37:45.550
In 1971, President Nixon's interest and concern was real and genuine, but he had no army.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.551
He had no resources.

37:48.332 --> 37:50.153
No clear strategy existed to win.

37:50.993 --> 38:04.303
But 45 years later, after decades and decades of funding, new research, training scientists and physicians, treating millions of patients because of so many of you,

38:05.103 --> 38:09.704
We now have a powerful new technology.

38:09.744 --> 38:12.164
This is in 2016 when he's vice president.

38:12.204 --> 38:16.385
This is in 2016, a few months after Vaxxed came out.

38:16.425 --> 38:24.906
This is in 2016, in the same month where Brandy Vaughn brags about her first billboard on the San Francisco Bridge.

38:24.926 --> 38:30.027
Technologies and tools, we have an army.

38:30.787 --> 38:34.348
And with this moonshot, a clear strategy and road ahead.

38:35.503 --> 38:36.864
The moonshot does two things.

38:37.904 --> 38:44.587
One, first, it injects, and because of all of you, an incredible sense of urgency back into this fight.

38:45.487 --> 39:01.555
Part of it is that what I said to the president when I walked out in the Rose Garden that day and said, I regret, it was spontaneous, I said, the only thing I regret announcing I'm not running for president, I'd like to preside over the end of cancer as we know it.

39:01.675 --> 39:04.336
Not we'd solve it all, but the end of cancer as we know it.

39:05.336 --> 39:10.998
And some wags, particularly in some of your professions, said, you know, like, here we go again.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.378
Here we go again.

39:13.258 --> 39:13.918
But you know what?

39:15.799 --> 39:23.361
What happened is that because of you, there is a fundamental new sense of urgency.

39:24.461 --> 39:25.622
I think you all can feel it.

39:25.642 --> 39:26.482
You've generated it.

39:27.042 --> 39:28.843
It's not only here, but it's around the world.

39:29.663 --> 39:31.803
And the second thing is, back in 1971,

39:35.410 --> 39:40.093
when there was no army, there was not all this, we didn't even know then there were 200 different cancers.

39:41.414 --> 39:46.617
What's happened is- 200 different cancers, okay.

39:46.857 --> 39:56.163
Is that we had a set of rules, a culture that was established for research and cooperation that is not applicable to 2016.

39:57.724 --> 40:03.107
The change in the cultural system that's needed to win this fight is kind of what we're all about.

40:04.557 --> 40:11.687
The change in the cultural system, I think, is code for, you people are too sovereign.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.691
You people got too many privacy rights.

40:18.632 --> 40:28.319
Jill and I, as Jill mentioned, every family is facing, everybody knows someone, if not their own family, facing cancer.

40:28.979 --> 40:30.740
And we know what it does to a family.

40:31.541 --> 40:39.346
Our family learned as much as we could, which all of you do, and some of you who are in the profession are survivors and or you've lost someone.

40:40.267 --> 40:43.909
And what do you do even if you have no background in cancer?

40:44.709 --> 40:46.651
It's your child, your husband, your wife.

40:47.657 --> 41:00.943
You try to learn everything you can, everything you can about the disease, both for purposes of hope and deciding on what you can do.

41:01.583 --> 41:02.584
What is it you can do?

41:02.604 --> 41:06.725
Is there anything you can do that speeds the progress?

41:06.765 --> 41:14.709
Because the one thing that every single cancer patient needs is a little bit of hope, hope.

41:15.990 --> 41:18.271
My mother used to say, where there's life, there's hope.

41:19.551 --> 41:34.435
What we learned from the world's best nurses, physicians, and researchers is that even if we couldn't save our son, the science, the medicine, the technology are progressing faster than ever.

41:36.115 --> 41:38.916
So we'll be able to save countless sons and daughters.

41:40.305 --> 41:47.649
As I've been saying repeatedly, I didn't realize this until Bo was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma.

41:48.350 --> 41:49.571
We knew it was the death sentence.

41:49.891 --> 41:50.731
We're not slow.

41:51.432 --> 41:51.852
He knew.

41:51.872 --> 41:53.573
We all knew.

41:55.274 --> 41:55.954
But there was hope.

41:57.395 --> 42:05.580
We just thought there was hope because cancer in the last six years reached an inflection point that didn't exist seven, eight, 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.

42:08.168 --> 42:17.594
By inflection point, we find there's a recognition that the cancer system established five decades ago needs to be re-imaged for the 21st century.

42:18.534 --> 42:24.097
That too often our cancer culture and system still plays by the rules of 71, not 2016.

42:25.658 --> 42:26.899
But so much has changed.

42:27.599 --> 42:28.120
Let me explain.

42:28.200 --> 42:33.223
Five years ago, oncologists weren't routinely working with immunologists.

42:33.343 --> 42:36.004
Immunology was sort of a voodoo science 10, 15 years ago.

42:37.492 --> 42:39.153
No, I'm not joking.

42:39.213 --> 42:43.295
I'm a bit pejorative, but truly, truly.

42:44.876 --> 42:45.637
Engaging.

42:46.117 --> 42:48.678
He knows all about the history of immunology, I'm sure.

42:49.018 --> 42:51.700
Immune system to kill cancers.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.842
There were three things that were done routinely.

42:55.382 --> 42:56.703
Find the tumor, excise it.

42:57.443 --> 43:00.645
What you couldn't get out, make sure you radiate the margins.

43:01.645 --> 43:06.248
And number three, which kills a lot of healthy parts of your brain or your body,

43:07.253 --> 43:22.544
and then engage in significant doses, depending on the seriousness of the cancer, of chemotherapy, which kills an awful lot of those cells that we need to engage those T-cells to kill.

43:23.044 --> 43:29.309
Oh, so cancer therapy kills the T-cells, but we need to engage the T-cells in order to kill the cancer.

43:29.329 --> 43:30.029
Are you hearing yet?

43:30.530 --> 43:31.010
It's coming.

43:31.971 --> 43:32.451
The cancer.

43:33.905 --> 43:40.508
So with immunologists and virologists, geneticists, chemical engineers, and others, they're now all working together.

43:40.548 --> 43:42.088
Why would we have virologists?

43:42.328 --> 43:48.231
I thought, are we saying that Bob Gallo was right, that cancer's caused by viruses?

43:49.051 --> 43:49.711
What in the hell?

43:49.832 --> 43:52.973
Working together and beginning to work even more closely together.

43:53.413 --> 43:56.594
It's becoming more routine than the exception now.

43:57.895 --> 44:00.296
Today, there's recognition that by aggregating

44:01.420 --> 44:08.108
and sharing data from millions of patients, genomics, family histories, lifestyles, treatment outcomes.

44:08.709 --> 44:10.812
We have now what we didn't have before.

44:11.112 --> 44:16.418
How would we ever get lifestyles and treatment differences and genomic data?

44:18.461 --> 44:19.582
How would we ever do that in 2016?

44:30.336 --> 44:32.496
We have a super computing capacity.

44:33.597 --> 44:42.398
We can actually do a million billion, a million, you all know it, but the press, a million billion calculations per second.

44:42.639 --> 44:43.879
Oh, wow.

44:44.419 --> 44:45.619
That's crazy.

44:45.659 --> 44:48.140
We finally have the computers to do it.

44:48.800 --> 44:55.341
Now that we have the computers to do it, Peter, I mean, Joshua Lederberg told us we would need the computer.

44:55.361 --> 44:58.982
Now that we have the computers, I mean, how can we not do it?

45:00.011 --> 45:03.196
We can't take time for everybody to understand why.

45:03.596 --> 45:11.448
It's for cancer, it's for autism, it's for all the genetic diseases that Kurtzweiler said we're gonna cure in 10 years.

45:11.488 --> 45:12.510
We're almost there.

45:19.580 --> 45:27.707
us, at least theoretically, if we aggregate enough data to be able to find new patterns and causes and successful treatments of cancer.

45:28.408 --> 45:31.350
Why does one treatment work on you and not on me?

45:31.390 --> 45:32.371
We have the same cancer.

45:33.492 --> 45:43.681
Because of technological advances and analyzing cancer genes and other genes in the body, we're closer than ever before to understanding what causes specific cancers, how to attack them.

45:45.778 --> 45:53.025
A few years ago, it took more than $2.7 billion to sequence the first human genome, as the doc knows.

45:54.306 --> 45:56.768
Now it takes less than a day and costs under $1,000.

45:56.888 --> 46:01.773
This is the exact selling point that these people do.

46:02.193 --> 46:05.977
He's just doing it from a politician's podium.

46:07.540 --> 46:10.743
This has been the selling point for decades, ladies and gentlemen.

46:10.803 --> 46:12.905
They have been preparing for this for decades.

46:13.265 --> 46:17.388
They didn't start collecting your genomes when they didn't have the computers.

46:18.089 --> 46:21.111
They didn't even bother talking about it when they didn't have the computers.

46:21.212 --> 46:27.357
Once they understood the task, then they focused on the computers first and the storage first.

46:29.397 --> 46:35.163
Do you really think that they're floating ships out in the ocean to store all the YouTube videos?

46:35.624 --> 46:40.149
To make sure that all the YouTube videos are available and are streaming all the time?

46:40.529 --> 46:43.112
They've got all those servers docked in boats?

46:45.835 --> 46:49.359
Because you know, we never have enough videos on a server.

46:51.305 --> 46:57.971
Is that really why we put so much effort into the internet, so much effort into all the storage on the internet?

46:58.031 --> 46:58.391
Really?

46:58.932 --> 46:59.352
Really?

47:00.072 --> 47:07.959
Because content providers and content creators need storage space, you know, like I need my peer tube.

47:16.086 --> 47:17.728
New technologies, new therapies.

47:18.499 --> 47:21.582
as I said, like immunology, targeting cancer cells.

47:22.062 --> 47:34.194
I'm going to move forward because I think you need to understand that these pharmaceutical companies are in on it because they too stand to benefit from a database like that.

47:36.943 --> 47:44.952
These global pharmaceutical companies are in it with the social media companies, because of course, part of the data they need is your behavior.

47:44.992 --> 47:51.939
Your consumer behavior tells them, of course, how to sell things to you, but it also tells them what you consume.

47:51.980 --> 47:54.562
And they can use that as data as well.

47:54.602 --> 47:55.844
And this is not a joke.

47:58.391 --> 48:12.422
If they are going to use the current world population's next generation of kids and the one that comes after it, our grandkids, and use them to the fullest extent that the Human Genome Project requires.

48:14.261 --> 48:24.250
then they need us to acquiesce to social media, to digital enslavement, to digital monitoring, and also to genetic and epigenetic monitoring.

48:24.330 --> 48:27.973
Anything, everything you can imagine, they need all the data with a capital D.

48:30.182 --> 48:35.044
And that's why all of these front groups are sabotaged because they are part of this.

48:35.464 --> 48:52.811
The idea is to run out the clock slowly so that our children just walk in blindly while they're looking down at their phones and scrolling and wake up one day under a vaccine passport where they can't go anywhere unless they meet the requirements and submit.

48:55.458 --> 49:13.655
And that, I believe, is why this, what I call loosely a lollapalooza of liars, was put in place to control the dissident movement, the skepticism of the pandemic, to make sure that that skepticism was neutered in a way that would never come to the right conclusion.

49:14.516 --> 49:17.758
The easy one, you know, the Brandy Vaughn biology.

49:18.513 --> 49:19.654
Happy birthday, Brandy.

49:20.494 --> 49:34.864
Instead, we have this fake populist movement that I think somewhere near the helm sits Steve Bannon, simply because he's the one who gave us Li Min Yan.

49:34.904 --> 49:36.725
He's the one who gave us Stephen Hatfield.

49:36.745 --> 49:38.366
He's the one who gave us Miles Guo.

49:38.907 --> 49:44.430
And he's the one who suggested that this guy should be vice president, just like this guy said he should be vice president.

49:44.791 --> 49:47.973
And he's definitely part of this team, who the former,

49:48.513 --> 49:57.468
Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project has been helping to advise from whenever, but certainly from the beginning of the pandemic.

49:59.042 --> 50:18.363
This is the guy that helps write the script that keeps people off of the important things like the real scrutiny of PCR or the real scrutiny of how they treated pneumonia or the real scrutiny of the use of supplementary oxygen and stay focused on the sequences or the DNA contamination, etc, etc.

50:18.823 --> 50:19.945
Maybe it even integrates.

50:22.662 --> 50:44.332
While Bobby is focused on ending the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies, I am going to assemble the best technologists and scientists in the world, and we will use the latest in AI and computation to examine the health records databases of our nation and those other nations who are also on a quest to solve chronic disease.

50:48.393 --> 50:49.714
Do I need to say any more?

50:52.025 --> 50:53.646
It's not like they're lying to you.

50:54.826 --> 50:56.186
It's not like they're hiding it.

50:57.227 --> 50:59.588
It's just that the fire hose is so thick.

51:00.528 --> 51:04.089
There's so much water being sprayed in your face that you can just miss it.

51:06.630 --> 51:11.812
But in reality, this is the trap, the limited spectrum of debate.

51:11.912 --> 51:15.193
Both sides were ready and willing

51:17.918 --> 51:21.423
and telling us this is a video from March 29th, 2024.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.540
I don't even know what to say.

51:31.580 --> 51:32.421
Should I play it again?

51:32.521 --> 51:34.742
I mean, really, what do I say here?

51:35.562 --> 51:57.230
While Bobby is focused on ending the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies, I am going to assemble the best technologists and scientists in the world, and we will use the latest in AI and computation to examine the health records databases of our nation and those other nations who are also on a quest to solve chronic disease.

51:58.590 --> 51:59.971
So it's a global project.

52:01.220 --> 52:09.888
They're gonna get the databases or maybe from the UK where, you know, Claire Craig was already collecting a hundred thousand genomes to do pathology on.

52:12.350 --> 52:14.132
Nobody's in this narrative by chance.

52:14.192 --> 52:15.914
That's the part that hurts me the most.

52:16.034 --> 52:17.275
Everyone has a timeline.

52:17.355 --> 52:25.283
I have a timeline where it took me a very long time to figure it out because there were just so many meddlers, ladies and gentlemen, so many people trying to keep you off center.

52:26.485 --> 52:34.971
But I can tell you from listening to 2013 Brian Hooker, that Brian Hooker in 2013 actually understood something.

52:35.971 --> 52:40.935
I might just escape out of here for a second and restart the slide deck just to make sure that we're okay here.

52:43.086 --> 52:49.772
In 2013, Brian understood very well that he says that doesn't say autism.

52:49.832 --> 52:51.454
He calls his son vaccine injured.

52:51.474 --> 52:53.395
He doesn't like the term autism in 2013.

52:54.256 --> 52:58.440
He questions the entire idea of vaccination, the whole principle in 2013.

52:58.880 --> 53:01.383
And he says, it's many shots.

53:01.443 --> 53:02.323
It's not just the MMR.

53:05.498 --> 53:08.901
And so it's very curious what we found the other day when we went to 2020.

53:11.183 --> 53:12.384
Let's just do a timeline.

53:12.664 --> 53:13.805
Happy birthday, Brandy.

53:34.286 --> 53:41.132
Now the reason why I like Brandy so darn much is because Brandy was the one that said it best in 2016.

53:41.192 --> 53:53.002
I've never found anyone else who's said it like this except for myself, which is that you have to just do the thought experiment of comparing injection of a pharmaceutical versus ingestion.

53:54.643 --> 54:00.308
And if you understand how much more dangerous and ridiculous it is to inject anything versus ingest it,

54:01.348 --> 54:08.217
or wipe it on your skin or inhale it, then you understand the basic biology of why intramuscular injection is dumb.

54:08.638 --> 54:16.628
And certainly intramuscular injection with the intention of augmenting the immune system of a perfectly healthy child is absurd.

54:16.689 --> 54:17.550
It's malevolent.

54:19.918 --> 54:22.240
And Brandy was able to say it in 2016.

54:22.340 --> 54:32.327
Brandy was running in the same circles as Mary Holland, as Judy Mickiewicz, as Del Bigtree, as Polly Tommy, and as Andrew Wakefield.

54:32.667 --> 54:40.913
She is contemporary to them in 2016 and is as is her organization founded in 2015 called Learn the Risk.

54:40.993 --> 54:47.718
And here she is excited about a billboard that she got up on the street in San Francisco.

54:53.860 --> 55:01.067
CHD doesn't make billboards that say all vaccines are dangerous or all vaccines do harm.

55:01.788 --> 55:03.109
Or what does she say here?

55:04.891 --> 55:06.873
Vaccines do more harm than good.

55:07.594 --> 55:09.996
Every shot contains toxic chemicals.

55:11.237 --> 55:14.380
There is no such thing that CHD does.

55:14.741 --> 55:16.162
ICAN does not do that.

55:17.133 --> 55:25.542
Brian Hooker doesn't have any billboards that say all shots do more harm than good, even though 2013 Brian Hooker understood that.

55:29.833 --> 55:35.758
And three years later in May, 2019, there's a photograph of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:35.818 --> 55:43.664
and Del Bigtree and Brandy Vaughn and James Lyon Weiner and Judy Mickiewicz.

55:44.324 --> 55:57.575
And so they all know that for three years, she has been putting up billboards in many states around the United States, has been on the news for her anti-vaccine billboards showing dead babies

56:00.353 --> 56:00.933
They know.

56:02.654 --> 56:05.516
That's why they're standing in this picture with her.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.156
They know how she says it.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.958
They know that she says it very differently than they do.

56:10.798 --> 56:13.840
It's not just about the MMR like it is with Wakefield.

56:13.920 --> 56:23.525
It's not just about, you know, an adjuvant like it is with Mary Holland or with Pauly Tommy or with all, sorry, with James Lyons Wyler.

56:24.588 --> 56:30.571
And we've found evidence that Pauly Tommy was coming onto the side of Brandy, understanding that, you know what?

56:30.611 --> 56:33.552
The real important message is the unvaccinated kids.

56:34.072 --> 56:45.177
Brandy had an unvaccinated kid because she had her kid in France and breastfed her kid and never gave him shots and really never even thought about it until she came back to California during these mandates being put in.

56:47.398 --> 56:51.660
It was lucky because this is not an autism mom.

56:53.311 --> 56:55.032
Why does she have to risk anything?

56:56.373 --> 56:58.173
She could have just moved out of California.

56:58.494 --> 57:00.054
She could have just homeschooled her kid.

57:00.935 --> 57:08.379
Instead, she risked everything to put it on billboards because she didn't want other kids to be injured.

57:08.759 --> 57:10.600
She had a vaccine-free kid.

57:10.660 --> 57:11.520
I don't have that.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.181
You don't have that.

57:13.681 --> 57:14.442
She had it.

57:16.002 --> 57:21.065
And she felt that it was so important that she dedicated her entire life and her savings

57:22.301 --> 57:29.927
to putting it on billboards, to raising the money to put it on more billboards, while these people talked about the MMR or adjuvants or choice.

57:33.189 --> 57:38.193
And I'm frustrated because they played the same game with me, even after I figured it out.

57:39.174 --> 57:43.197
So Brandy Vaughn died in December of 2020 on the 7th.

57:46.505 --> 58:06.136
And we will listen to a video of 2020 Brian Hooker, who in 2013, I believe, would have understood exactly what Brandy was saying in 2015 and 16, and would have been totally gung-ho about the idea to simplify it down to intramuscular injection seems pretty dumb, especially in a healthy child.

58:06.216 --> 58:07.296
Let's just stop doing that.

58:10.838 --> 58:12.379
And here's Brian Hooker in 2020, of course.

58:15.433 --> 58:17.435
It was so great, so great.

58:19.316 --> 58:23.140
So my first stop after I finished seeing my patients today was to Costco.

58:23.520 --> 58:27.563
I bought like six roasted chickens and a bunch of frozen vegetables.

58:27.603 --> 58:29.645
And I was like, fuck it, we're going to be fine.

58:30.066 --> 58:31.126
Lock it down.

58:31.146 --> 58:31.827
That's right.

58:31.887 --> 58:32.908
Lock it down.

58:35.074 --> 58:36.895
I wasn't having this much fun in December 2020.

58:37.935 --> 58:39.076
I had just lost my job.

58:39.096 --> 58:42.797
I was actually on the phone with Scott, Dr. Scott Jensen a little bit ago.

58:42.837 --> 58:45.698
He's actually... I'm not going to play this part of the video.

58:45.718 --> 58:48.179
I just wanted you to see where it starts and where it goes.

58:48.239 --> 58:51.861
I might just fast forward it a little bit here so you can see the whole picture of people.

58:52.401 --> 58:58.464
So there's two people in this video this Dr. Kendra here that I think you can see me circling and then Dr. Brian Hooker.

58:58.504 --> 59:07.809
Dr. Brian Hooker is the guy that I showed you in 2013 a couple days ago was totally down with the idea that vaccination itself was pretty

59:08.989 --> 59:25.837
pretty dubious, pretty dodgy, and would have definitely agreed with 2015 or 2016 Brandy Vaughn when she explained the difference between injection versus ingestion and explained how many different things are in these shots that nobody cares about.

59:27.638 --> 59:28.898
And that all shots are bad.

59:30.639 --> 59:36.942
And I think Brian Hooker and Brandy would have been very, very active and good colleagues on those ideas.

59:38.084 --> 59:54.958
Despite the fact that Brian Hooker in 2013 had 16 years of experience as a geneticist manipulating plants, genetically modifying plants with transformation and transfection.

59:55.278 --> 01:00:00.102
2020 Brian Hooker doesn't say anything about transformation and transfection.

01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.725
Put together over a period of 10 to 14 weeks.

01:00:05.345 --> 01:00:07.668
So we really have no long-term safety studies.

01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:17.179
We don't know what happens when you take messenger RNA, you know, that they're using in these formulations and you put it into human bodies.

01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:21.344
We do know that there's a higher propensity of things like Bell's palsy.

01:00:22.433 --> 01:00:25.235
and other neurological diseases.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:33.862
So what I'm suggesting here, number one, is that Brian is absolutely positively more technically advanced than what he's explaining here.

01:00:34.322 --> 01:00:37.425
And he does not need to recite the script that he's given.

01:00:38.991 --> 01:00:42.412
which said there might be a higher propensity for Bell's palsy.

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:49.554
What he could say right now is that I have 16 years in biotechnology where I was transforming and transfecting plants.

01:00:50.054 --> 01:01:00.417
And I quite frankly can't understand the rationale where we think that we have a grip on this and our own biology well enough to start using these things willy nilly in healthy people.

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:03.618
This just seems absurd, but he's not saying that.

01:01:04.258 --> 01:01:08.599
He's reading a script that he was given that says the safety studies were too short

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:22.879
Meaning that if the safety studies were longer, and then he's going to say something absolutely remarkable, which is his vaccines were given to his son during an ear infection.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.444
Which kind of sort of implies that if you give vaccines when you don't have an ear infection, maybe you won't get autism.

01:01:30.612 --> 01:01:37.773
And then he's going to go on to get interrupted by Dr. Kendra, who's going to say that, you know, there's fifth generation warfare around already.

01:01:38.113 --> 01:01:41.194
She's not going to use those words, but she's going to say the same thing.

01:01:42.234 --> 01:01:59.317
And then he's going to come back and fill in the rest of the biology that they've been given on a script in order to enact some kind of limited spectrum of debate in front of these people that think that a spontaneous conversation is happening instead of a carefully scripted, uh, uh,

01:02:00.539 --> 01:02:04.303
catch and return conversation that they are engaged in right now.

01:02:04.823 --> 01:02:10.108
It's absolutely positively a national security exercise.

01:02:10.128 --> 01:02:11.689
I died from these vaccines.

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:19.656
And, you know, I went through the clinical trial data directly when it became available for the FDA.

01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:26.342
And what I saw was that, you know, they're supposed to be giving these vaccines to seniors in nursing homes.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.762
And these are already chronically ill individuals.

01:02:30.102 --> 01:02:33.103
You're not supposed to vaccinate six people, even under.

01:02:33.343 --> 01:02:36.825
Oh, so maybe it's okay for younger people then, but just not old people.

01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:43.529
Again, this is a guy who in 2013 was questioning the whole idea of injecting anyone.

01:02:45.967 --> 01:03:03.438
This is a guy that between 2013 and 2020, absolutely positively met Brandy Vaughn and heard her speak several times, maybe even shared a stage with her, was in the same movie as her and is in an organization that definitely knows who she is because those people are on stage together.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.361
You know, a very, very flawed system of medical care.

01:03:08.381 --> 01:03:09.861
You're not supposed to do that.

01:03:10.202 --> 01:03:11.342
That's what happened to my son.

01:03:11.422 --> 01:03:13.964
He was vaccinated when he had an active ear infection.

01:03:14.434 --> 01:03:17.518
And that sent him tremendously downhill very, very quickly.

01:03:18.038 --> 01:03:23.925
And so it really seems to suggest that as long as you don't vaccinate with an ear infection, maybe things will be okay.

01:03:25.527 --> 01:03:31.774
That's not 2013 that Brian, that would, I think, say the vaccine schedule needs to end.

01:03:32.294 --> 01:03:35.218
If I'm allowed to say that, I would like to say it on the radio right now.

01:03:38.854 --> 01:03:40.475
These people aren't there by accident.

01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:41.616
They have been co-opted.

01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:46.839
They've been offered, you know, you're either going to go along or we're going to get somebody else to go along.

01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:53.562
I'm not saying Brian's a bad guy, but I'm saying Brian could tell us the truth and this would end in a moment.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:59.126
Intramuscular injection of medicine is the most ridiculous rationale.

01:03:59.466 --> 01:04:00.106
There is none.

01:04:00.526 --> 01:04:02.788
There's no biological basis for that idea.

01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:12.900
And it comes from these kind of old men that had no idea what they were talking about, just had an idea that they were given and were dreaming about.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:20.447
And so, you know, I think this is a great way to clear out nursing home beds.

01:04:20.467 --> 01:04:21.348
You're going to kill people.

01:04:21.909 --> 01:04:24.770
You are absolutely going to kill people with these vaccines.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.872
The population that was most underrepresented was the geriatric population.

01:04:30.932 --> 01:04:38.114
Wouldn't it be crazy if they rolled out placebo and then Brian turned out to be wrong from the perspective of most people in America who took it?

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.335
Wouldn't that be crazy?

01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:44.536
It's going to be catastrophic.

01:04:44.556 --> 01:04:46.697
And then it turns out not to be catastrophic.

01:04:46.737 --> 01:04:47.777
Wouldn't that be nuts?

01:04:50.180 --> 01:05:00.086
In fact, the phase 2 clinical trials where they did safety data, they literally had 22 individuals that they tested that were above 68 years of age.

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:01.687
And this is the primary.

01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:10.652
Now they're sending out millions of vaccinations across the United States for people who are on long-term care.

01:05:10.893 --> 01:05:12.534
And it's a disaster.

01:05:12.694 --> 01:05:15.796
It's an absolute disaster waiting to happen.

01:05:15.856 --> 01:05:17.597
It's already happening in the UK.

01:05:17.757 --> 01:05:19.638
And I know it will only be worse here.

01:05:21.943 --> 01:05:24.626
Yeah, it is scary.

01:05:24.686 --> 01:05:32.433
And it's amazing how many people are willing to just jump in line and take this vaccine that, I mean, you're basically a guinea pig for it.

01:05:32.593 --> 01:05:39.440
There's been no... This is a man who has 16 years of experience transforming and transfecting plants.

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:48.026
So he could point out right now that putting mRNA into a human is called transfection.

01:05:48.066 --> 01:05:54.889
And actually, I know colleagues who do it in academia all the time, in mice, in rats, and in monkeys.

01:05:55.049 --> 01:05:57.511
And it would be ridiculous to do this in healthy humans.

01:05:58.251 --> 01:05:59.292
I'm an expert in it.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:10.918
He could say that because he started out his 2013 interview by saying he has 16 years of experience in biotechnology, working on genetically modified plants to make medicine.

01:06:13.288 --> 01:06:16.611
He worked for a government laboratory for the Department of Energy.

01:06:17.812 --> 01:06:23.017
And he was an expert, self-declared expert in the FDA approval process in 2013.

01:06:24.218 --> 01:06:31.584
And now this guy is reading a script where the safety studies are too short and the vaccine during, what?

01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:37.089
Trials on it, no long-term trials.

01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:38.731
There's no peer review studies, nothing.

01:06:39.744 --> 01:06:42.366
and yet you literally are a part of the study.

01:06:42.406 --> 01:06:45.048
You are the study, because you're getting the vaccine first.

01:06:45.728 --> 01:06:48.590
Dr. Kendra Becker, would you like to expand on some of the- Here we go.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.931
Sure.

01:06:49.291 --> 01:07:07.243
I'm actually giving a lecture on the different COVID vaccines that are being released on the 21st, which I think- If you're giving a lecture on the vaccines, then you are either an absolutely bamboozled person who just wants to be in the spotlight,

01:07:09.247 --> 01:07:19.209
or you are a malevolent actor because anybody that was humble enough to read before they gave a lecture would not be calling them vaccines.

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:28.411
Anybody that was humble enough to read before they gave a lecture would be calling these things not vaccines.

01:07:28.471 --> 01:07:29.812
And already right now in 2020,

01:07:32.904 --> 01:07:59.239
In December of 2020, yours truly, Jonathan Cooey, still research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, not yet off the list until October in, or sorry, July in 2021, was already saying that these were transfections, was already thrown out of DRASTIC because DRASTIC is focused on the origin of the virus and we're not gonna talk about the shots.

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:11.502
While I was pleading with them, hey, we got so much media coverage right now, we could tell everybody that these are not vaccines, that they are transfections and that we could expect autoimmunity, that this is gonna be a disaster.

01:08:12.242 --> 01:08:14.123
Nada, zippo, zilch.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:27.066
While the 16 years of experience biotechnologist is on a stream talking about the vaccines and telling us the limitations of them.

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:29.585
Maybe we shouldn't give them to old people.

01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:31.665
Maybe we shouldn't give them to kids with ear infections.

01:08:32.406 --> 01:08:33.226
Maybe they'll fade.

01:08:33.586 --> 01:08:36.127
It's Monday in Dunedin, Florida.

01:08:36.187 --> 01:08:38.968
So if anybody wants that information, I can pass that flyer around.

01:08:39.429 --> 01:08:43.970
And specifically, you know, speaking to what Brian said, you're absolutely correct.

01:08:44.131 --> 01:08:50.213
I mean, the studies on these were so flimsy and any vaccine going forward, the phase three

01:08:50.748 --> 01:08:55.189
Phase three trials start when they start dispensing it into the general public.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:56.929
In this case, this vaccine was rushed.

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:59.410
Understand what I'm trying to point out here.

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:06.612
There is no previous skepticism of the previous vaccine schedule.

01:09:08.232 --> 01:09:17.134
There's no good biological skepticism of the previous vaccine schedule upon which these two actors are building.

01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:25.013
That would be normal if you were Brian Hooker and had been fighting this fight against the vaccine schedule lie since 2013.

01:09:26.574 --> 01:09:28.015
You'd probably open with that.

01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:38.159
But instead, they are opening with a carefully scripted back and forth where they only cover the same talking points that Robert Malone would cover.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.782
Only the same talking points that Kevin McKernan has covered on the Vance Crowe podcast three times.

01:09:50.595 --> 01:09:54.576
so quickly using state-of-the-art technology that's never been used before.

01:09:55.617 --> 01:09:59.358
We know- It's not state-of-the-art technology that's never been used before.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:04.040
It is state, it is technology that was used to produce biologics before the pandemic.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.201
And now they don't have to go through the final step of purifying the protein.

01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:14.123
They can stop at the DNA and use an enzymatic reaction to convert that DNA to RNA.

01:10:14.163 --> 01:10:14.984
And then who cares?

01:10:16.624 --> 01:10:18.505
It's not a new process.

01:10:19.721 --> 01:10:22.443
and it's not a new technology, and Brian knows that.

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:43.157
The important thing that one of my friends pointed out to me is that my description of what happened during the pandemic basically requires previously existing technologies to be renamed, maybe with a little malevolent intent.

01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:45.079
That's it.

01:10:46.385 --> 01:10:56.532
No magic tricks, no, you know, oh my gosh, they have all this new technology that they've unleashed, like nanoparticles and nanomachines, and they're monitoring us with 5G.

01:10:57.933 --> 01:10:58.674
Maybe someday.

01:11:00.515 --> 01:11:03.737
But for now, all they're doing is renaming old technology.

01:11:05.839 --> 01:11:10.662
Essentially, transfection and transformation have become both virology and medicine.

01:11:12.784 --> 01:11:14.405
And Brian is 100% down with it, apparently.

01:11:15.948 --> 01:11:27.335
even by the small number of clinical trials that they've done, that it ramps up autoimmunity, that it causes anaphylactic reactions, and that it really kind of amplifies and ramps up the immune system.

01:11:27.796 --> 01:11:38.482
So in a country where, you know, 50% of our children carry a chronic medical diagnosis, we're going to go ahead and continue to amplify what's going on in their immune system.

01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:40.684
I think it's dangerous and unsafe.

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:42.445
And furthermore,

01:11:42.904 --> 01:11:51.406
The amount of, and we've talked a lot about predictive programming and fear-based, you quote, education and things that have been going on in the mainstream media.

01:11:51.806 --> 01:11:59.067
But furthermore, we have a vaccine that's 90% effective for a virus that is 99.99% curable.

01:11:59.387 --> 01:12:07.429
I mean, I just, survivable, I- So what they are agreeing on is that the questions being asked in the mainstream media are the right questions to ask.

01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:11.785
We should be asking who dies of the virus.

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:14.591
We should be asking about how old are they.

01:12:14.951 --> 01:12:18.157
We should be asking about whether they have comorbidities or not.

01:12:18.973 --> 01:12:29.102
And all these questions presuppose the existence of the virus, presuppose the need for a vaccine, accept the idea that there is a crisis in the works.

01:12:29.582 --> 01:12:38.089
And I believe that it is impossible for Brian and this Kendra person to be on this script by accident.

01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:40.912
This is not just because they've been reading the wrong newspapers.

01:12:44.207 --> 01:12:48.450
The thinking on all of this is a far greater problem than the vaccine.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.570
You know, I'm a capitalist.

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:53.632
People want to put out a crappy product and people want to buy that crappy product.

01:12:54.133 --> 01:12:55.253
That's up to them.

01:12:55.353 --> 01:12:56.514
That is not up to me.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:13:08.680
If the government wants to tell children's parents that they need to be hit in the head with a baseball bat three times before they're 12 years old and two times before they're six months, well, you know, I don't care.

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.881
It's fine with me.

01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:12.342
I'm just not going to do it to my kids.

01:13:18.143 --> 01:13:25.845
I think this is the most, this is the shittiest attitude and exactly the opposite of my friend, happy birthday, Brandy Vaughn.

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:36.847
Brandy Vaughn had a perfectly healthy kid that never been injected once and she could have just gone off on an island and lived happily ever after because Merck would have loved it if she'd have shut up.

01:13:38.348 --> 01:13:47.570
Seeing as Merck, her former employer owns a majority of the childhood vaccine schedule, that she was now telling you was bullshit.

01:13:55.302 --> 01:14:08.549
But when the government starts mandating and dispensing what they're calling health care for no apparent reason, without any sound scientific backing, that's when we start talking about tyranny.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:10.651
And that's the conversation I think we need to have.

01:14:11.761 --> 01:14:14.183
We're in a very, very scary predicament at this point.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.584
Can I just ask a question about the efficacy?

01:14:16.624 --> 01:14:28.092
Because as I understand it, and this is claimed efficacy, because when Bill Gates was talking about this in April, these Moderna vaccinations and the trials, they said 50% efficacy.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:29.973
They're all doing it.

01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:32.675
None of these people are using the right words.

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.356
They're using the slave speak.

01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:40.700
By using the word vaccine, you're already using the slave speak.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.144
By talking about mandates or choice, you're already using the slave speak.

01:14:45.204 --> 01:14:46.765
And Brian must know that.

01:14:47.306 --> 01:14:50.428
Certainly 2013 Brian knew that was bullshit.

01:14:50.748 --> 01:14:53.330
He wouldn't even use the slave speak of autism.

01:14:55.332 --> 01:14:57.454
Can you please see the significance of this?

01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:10.480
Because if we can break this cycle of using slave speak, using the words and their definitions, you're not going to get out of this maze if you keep running down the dead end of autism.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:15.284
You're not going to get through this maze if you keep running down the dead end of no mandates and choice.

01:15:15.704 --> 01:15:21.369
You're not going to get out of this maze if you keep running down to the dead end of maybe it's an adjuvant.

01:15:22.009 --> 01:15:48.750
And yet those are the dead ends that it appears that Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and CHD and Andrew Wakefield and Del Bigtree are all happy to run us back and forth between free speech, adjuvants, free speech, adjuvants, choice, free speech, adjuvants, autism, when the truth is right there.

01:15:50.678 --> 01:15:53.185
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:15:53.686 --> 01:15:55.010
It's not medicine.

01:15:56.394 --> 01:15:58.840
It is complete loss of sovereignty.

01:16:04.366 --> 01:16:11.528
As I understand that the efficacy is not an infection rate, it is producing these antibodies that they claim will be there.

01:16:11.588 --> 01:16:16.390
So they don't know whether you can be infected or it's going to lower the infection or even mortality rate.

01:16:16.650 --> 01:16:21.252
So really with this efficacy, when they say it's 90% effective, that's not from getting you infected.

01:16:21.432 --> 01:16:28.274
Do you think that Brian is not capable of saying that their model of immunity is nonsense?

01:16:29.691 --> 01:16:40.794
that I've been a biologist for my whole life and I have 16 years of biotech knowledge to know that this whole model of an antibody is just dumb and they shouldn't be talking about it.

01:16:40.854 --> 01:16:44.715
It's just a very simple marker that they can point to and claim efficacy.

01:16:45.235 --> 01:16:47.036
Why wouldn't he explain that right now?

01:16:47.096 --> 01:16:48.756
Why would he instead say this?

01:16:49.236 --> 01:16:52.277
As I understand it or even lowering a mortality rate that

01:16:52.677 --> 01:17:00.462
if you believe the World Health Organization, we've played the video many times, it is a 99.4% survivable virus, probably better than that.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:07.507
So you guys as doctors, please talk about when, when they talk about efficacy, they're not talking about infection or mortality rates.

01:17:07.727 --> 01:17:10.269
They are only talking about the antibodies, correct?

01:17:10.949 --> 01:17:17.253
Well, the whole thing is, is all, it's just a big word soup and it's a bunch of blobby blobby blobs.

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:22.157
I mean, it's the same kind of ridiculous predictive programming they use with the measles vaccine.

01:17:22.837 --> 01:17:24.179
Brian, you can speak to that.

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.721
I mean, don't you remember the marketing that went on with Merck?

01:17:26.761 --> 01:17:30.244
They saved 21 million children with the MMR vaccine?

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.166
I mean, come on.

01:17:32.487 --> 01:17:36.591
These numbers are... This is not random that she's bringing up the MMR vaccine.

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:45.940
This is a multi-year script that also includes a Rolling Stone article about the MMR vaccine in Samoa with a certain character in it.

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:56.008
And this is a part of that narrative that will later on appear in 2025 as a measles outbreak in Texas with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:17:56.048 --> 01:18:00.032
as Health and Human Services Secretary instead of Vice President.

01:18:02.334 --> 01:18:03.835
Don't make any sense whatsoever.

01:18:03.895 --> 01:18:08.159
And they don't even have to because vaccines are 100 percent liability free.

01:18:08.567 --> 01:18:11.212
So they can put whatever they want on the outside of that label.

01:18:11.693 --> 01:18:15.018
It doesn't matter what's inside your little microchip, your little nanos.

01:18:15.219 --> 01:18:18.765
We could talk about all the different ingredients in there, which are equivalently scary.

01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:22.489
And not to mention the fact that now it's a double jab, right?

01:18:22.529 --> 01:18:25.111
You got to go and then you have to be back on day 28.

01:18:25.612 --> 01:18:26.092
That's what they're.

01:18:26.252 --> 01:18:28.434
So this is really stupid, complicated.

01:18:28.494 --> 01:18:31.477
If you could just say that intramuscular injection is dumb, right.

01:18:32.137 --> 01:18:40.505
And teach people about how their immune system is organized and why that makes perfect sense and why they can think, you know, bad food's bad, but at least you're eating it.

01:18:41.606 --> 01:18:41.746
Um,

01:18:44.657 --> 01:18:45.478
And yet they can't.

01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:55.648
And the reason why they can't and why they have to stick to the stupid, complicated model is because that's how this fifth generation warfare works in a broad perspective.

01:18:55.668 --> 01:18:59.231
They either get you to accept a stupid, simple explanation,

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:06.186
antibodies equals immunity, or they get you to accept a, sorry, that's dumb simple.

01:19:06.787 --> 01:19:18.098
Otherwise, they get you to accept a stupid, complicated version of the story that you yourself feel lacks a level of sophistication to scrutinize it.

01:19:18.618 --> 01:19:31.889
And that's what somebody like Kevin McKernan can do to almost anyone as he talks about first his long lineage of mentors all the way back to Mark Lander and Tony Fauci and Francis Collins.

01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:36.833
And then he talks about all the things that he invented and all the patents he has and all the companies he spun off.

01:19:37.513 --> 01:19:45.180
And before you know it, he's said so many things that you don't understand that when he says that PCR is fine to detect a coronavirus, you're like, oh yeah, I guess so.

01:19:46.857 --> 01:19:59.183
And so what's happening here is that these people that aren't on script or helping the people on script are passively absorbing what appears to be people agreeing about what the most important questions to ask are.

01:19:59.683 --> 01:20:07.367
And one of those questions is definitely not, is intramuscular injection a good way to administer medicine at all?

01:20:08.267 --> 01:20:11.889
That would be a question that would make all of these questions irrelevant.

01:20:12.929 --> 01:20:16.331
They're saying for the Pfizer vaccine, you better be back on day 28 or you're

01:20:16.747 --> 01:20:18.989
immunity, quote unquote, is going to win.

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:21.290
So that is correct.

01:20:21.911 --> 01:20:37.402
And, and the immunity, um, itself, you know, if you look at the presence of what they call neutralizing antibodies, which were, are the ones that supposedly are going to go after COVID-19, um, you, you can see that one booster is not going to be enough.

01:20:37.442 --> 01:20:45.768
This is, this is a quite a business enterprise because they're going to come back in three months and say, you know what, you have to get the vaccine again.

01:20:46.226 --> 01:20:48.467
and then you have to get two doses of the vaccine again.

01:20:48.507 --> 01:20:49.127
You can tell.

01:20:49.507 --> 01:20:51.128
It's okay for him to say that, right?

01:20:51.168 --> 01:20:52.788
Because again, this is the script.

01:20:52.808 --> 01:20:54.829
They want you to understand this is coming.

01:20:55.749 --> 01:20:58.110
They want you to understand this is gonna be the argument.

01:20:58.811 --> 01:21:03.012
He said three months, because now it's six or a year, so that seems more reasonable.

01:21:04.213 --> 01:21:06.353
Ladies and gentlemen, it is that malevolent.

01:21:07.194 --> 01:21:13.776
And you know he's reading a script when he brings up T-cells in a moment, and the way that she helps him bring it up.

01:21:15.532 --> 01:21:32.499
already just by the documentation that was submitted to the FDA that yeah you do produce some neutralizing antibodies to that the immune system does work absolutely fine and they've proven that but that because it's such a horribly imperfect imperfect

01:21:33.064 --> 01:21:37.508
immunity, then the antibody titers drop off precipitously.

01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:39.109
And so you're back.

01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:46.716
So the imperfect immunity in Brian's mind is defined in exactly the same way as the immunity itself.

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:49.378
It's the presence or absence of antibodies.

01:21:50.359 --> 01:21:55.304
He's actually teaching these people in this Zoom meeting the slave speak.

01:21:56.164 --> 01:21:57.445
The slave speak is

01:21:58.385 --> 01:22:04.811
that immunity can be measured by antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers in particular.

01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:15.020
And the fact is, is that these new vaccines aren't as good, what's in the back of your mind, as old vaccines because the antibodies fade away.

01:22:18.003 --> 01:22:24.509
You don't hear him say it, but I guarantee you the subconscious of all these people's minds is hearing that.

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:30.593
because this is skepticism that's being applied specifically to the antibodies for this virus.

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:37.977
Nobody's saying that this is the model for all vaccines and they don't give a shit, even though this guy could say it, right?

01:22:39.077 --> 01:22:40.258
He's been at it since at least 2013.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:54.026
Back at square one, you're basically just getting poisoned in a vial with perhaps some type of short-term immunity that they don't know whether it's going to reverse severe,

01:22:55.305 --> 01:22:56.447
prevent severe cases.

01:22:56.507 --> 01:22:59.392
They don't know if they're going to create a- Why is it poison?

01:23:00.473 --> 01:23:01.275
I don't understand.

01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:02.797
You didn't say that it was poison.

01:23:02.917 --> 01:23:03.699
Why is it poison?

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.781
asymptomatic carriers with this particular vaccine.

01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:10.061
Asymptomatic carriers.

01:23:10.081 --> 01:23:14.223
It's completely a crapshoot and they're gambling.

01:23:14.303 --> 01:23:22.985
So by saying that we don't know if we're going to create asymptomatic carriers, he's reinforcing the idea that that is a possibility.

01:23:23.686 --> 01:23:27.347
And in effect, reinforcing the idea that's been around already for a whole year.

01:23:28.652 --> 01:23:39.059
That is, the reason why we have to lock down, the reason why this dangerous virus can be described as a honey badger, is because it's asymptomatic for so long.

01:23:39.119 --> 01:23:41.420
Some people are only asymptomatic.

01:23:45.043 --> 01:23:55.670
I mean, if the vaccines make asymptomatic carriers more prevalent, then this could be even a bigger disaster, and we'd have to call in somebody like Geert Vanden Bosch to explain to us what's going on.

01:23:58.704 --> 01:24:00.965
with the United States population.

01:24:01.506 --> 01:24:06.788
And 58% of the United States population has already said, yeah, they will get the COVID-19 vaccine.

01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:09.890
So this is a cataclysm that we've never seen medically.

01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:16.614
So I also want to point out today, Santa Clara County is doing door to door virus testing.

01:24:17.134 --> 01:24:17.314
Now,

01:24:17.941 --> 01:24:25.810
they are targeting lower income populations, in my opinion, because they are less likely to have the resources to fight back.

01:24:26.011 --> 01:24:29.355
It'd be crazy if they were doing door to door genome collection, right?

01:24:29.395 --> 01:24:30.276
Wouldn't that be nuts?

01:24:31.477 --> 01:24:34.601
Now, my question is, they're going to do this virus testing.

01:24:35.177 --> 01:24:46.091
And if this vaccine is only producing these antibodies, then why aren't they testing the people that may have been infected and produce the antibodies in the first place to see if they even need the vaccine?

01:24:46.611 --> 01:24:52.278
So another great question to ask is why don't we test people for antibodies after they've had it?

01:24:53.308 --> 01:25:00.410
Maybe we can put somebody who worked for pharmaceutical companies in front of people on social media in 2020 to make that exact claim.

01:25:00.931 --> 01:25:07.393
And his name is Mike, that's right, Mike Eden.

01:25:07.433 --> 01:25:16.656
We're gonna bring in Mike Eden in your starting lineup and he's gonna talk all about natural immunity and how we already have antibodies.

01:25:18.573 --> 01:25:20.654
And if we were infected, we'd have antibodies.

01:25:20.714 --> 01:25:23.594
And these people should be testing for natural immunity.

01:25:31.036 --> 01:25:32.476
That's not even talked about, correct?

01:25:33.237 --> 01:25:34.657
Of course it's not even talked about.

01:25:34.717 --> 01:25:39.498
And even Trump has said multiple times, once you get it, then you're, you're immune for life.

01:25:39.598 --> 01:25:41.098
Now, I don't know that that's the case.

01:25:41.279 --> 01:25:43.159
I know that I had COVID in February.

01:25:43.618 --> 01:25:45.940
And I tested positive for antibodies in May.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:53.324
And so she's sure that the tests work, and the tests work because the antibodies showed up.

01:25:54.165 --> 01:25:55.186
And so here we are.

01:25:55.406 --> 01:26:01.410
It really requires only Kendra and Brian to know that they're reading a script.

01:26:04.147 --> 01:26:05.728
It only requires those two.

01:26:06.448 --> 01:26:09.669
Everybody else is now, wow, I guess there is something going around.

01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:11.189
I mean, she says it, he says it.

01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:12.250
They're taking tests.

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:13.050
The tests work.

01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:14.230
She's got antibodies.

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:15.251
I mean, crazy, right?

01:26:19.332 --> 01:26:22.533
And now think about all the podcasts that these people did.

01:26:23.353 --> 01:26:29.015
All the podcasts they did, all the stub stacks they wrote, all the tweets they tweeted.

01:26:31.647 --> 01:26:34.868
It's all one national security operation.

01:26:36.388 --> 01:26:41.910
And it is the longest, most expensive science project ever in reality.

01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:43.910
The Human Genome Project.

01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:49.052
I have not retested since May, but I know that I had them three months after and that at the time.

01:26:49.488 --> 01:26:54.235
was the research that was, they said that that was the sweet spot as far as seeing antibodies.

01:26:54.957 --> 01:27:04.592
So the other thing is, and correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Hooker, but isn't it- Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Hooker, as she looks down and to her right at the script.

01:27:05.973 --> 01:27:11.674
It's the B cells that actually create the antibodies in our, in our... That's the hilarious part.

01:27:11.794 --> 01:27:21.076
She knows so little about immunology that she can't even give you a, you know, dendritic cell to T cell to B cell to antibody kind of thing.

01:27:24.717 --> 01:27:27.638
She had to look down to make sure she said it right.

01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:33.619
Is it B or T that I have to say and then Brian's going to say T and which one's which and what do they do?

01:27:35.845 --> 01:27:39.506
She aware of how many different kinds of T-cells there are depending on who you talk to?

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:40.307
Of course not.

01:27:40.887 --> 01:27:42.948
She's reading a script, so is Brian.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.749
Immune system, but this vaccine targets T-cells, correct?

01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:49.830
This vaccine also targets T-cells.

01:27:50.190 --> 01:28:03.435
The absurdity of Brian Hooker saying that intramuscular injection of a lipid nanoparticle filled with RNA targets anything makes him malevolent.

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:14.004
The fact that Robert Malone said that Peter Cullis told him that they'd fix the targeting problem makes him malevolent.

01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:34.888
Anyone that got in front of Byram Bridle, who was trying to tell the world that they cannot target this lipid nanoparticle to any tissue, and that depending on how unlucky you get, it could go to your bone marrow, or to your ovaries, or to your testes, or to your heart lining, or to your brain.

01:28:39.429 --> 01:28:47.773
There is no other conclusion to come to because I worked for this guy for a half of a year and he pretended to be the first time he'd ever heard transfection.

01:28:48.213 --> 01:28:54.436
Wow, we should do a whole podcast about this, Jay, and you can explain how it's always been transfection.

01:28:55.716 --> 01:29:00.678
Because I didn't do it when I could have done it and saved all of the college kids in America.

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:08.802
That's what Brian Hooker should have told me when I did my podcast for CHD before they fired me for talking about Robert Malone.

01:29:12.045 --> 01:29:31.991
We could have avoided all of this if it wasn't for the coordinated effort of people who asked the wrong questions consistently in groups of people to convince them of the existence of the virus, the problem, the crisis, and the choices that needed to be made.

01:29:35.792 --> 01:29:39.253
Nobody is in this narrative by chance because

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.389
Social media allows it.

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:51.213
They can make it seem like it's all big random argument, but it's not little happy accidents.

01:29:51.393 --> 01:29:54.555
It is all by design, by military programming.

01:29:56.647 --> 01:30:00.470
understand, ladies and gentlemen, that testing has become a remnant stream.

01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:02.472
They sell remnants.

01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:13.820
In America, there is still the impetus to circumcise young baby males in order to get their foreskin and use it for culture, to sell it to the highest bidder.

01:30:14.281 --> 01:30:22.067
There is still ongoing the sale of cesarean section placentas because they are sterile.

01:30:28.325 --> 01:30:43.075
And this is going on in the same hospitals that are now testing everyone and everyone and everyone all the time under the pretense that PCR is a great medical standard, despite the fact that the FDA is now toothless.

01:30:44.156 --> 01:31:03.480
under an emergency till 2029, and the person that is in office at the HHS is not interested in ending this remnant stream, but as his running mate in 2024 declared, he would be interested in combining this data just like

01:31:05.364 --> 01:31:18.212
2016 Joe Biden wanted to do the genomic data and the habits and the consumer and the behavior and the medical data all together from all these countries says Shanahan.

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.774
Because we all want to solve the problem of chronic disease.

01:31:22.814 --> 01:31:25.556
We all want to solve the problem of cancer.

01:31:27.417 --> 01:31:27.997
No, we don't.

01:31:28.157 --> 01:31:30.459
We all want to solve the problem of the human genome.

01:31:32.213 --> 01:31:43.838
The vaccine schedule is the inversion of your sovereignty so that your children accept the next step, which is all of your data.

01:31:45.198 --> 01:31:54.862
And more importantly, all of what gets injected into you will be designed and tracked and monitored in real time.

01:31:56.257 --> 01:32:04.121
You know, they actually tried to do this with the homeless people in Austin, you know, where Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield have their big ranches.

01:32:05.242 --> 01:32:15.548
In Austin, they tried to do it with blockchain to track all the medical and financial data of homeless people during the pandemic.

01:32:16.715 --> 01:32:19.677
They're going to do it to our kids, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:19.717 --> 01:32:21.117
It's the Human Genome Project.

01:32:21.718 --> 01:32:29.862
That's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and nobody tells you about it except for some actor like Denny Rancourt.

01:32:31.643 --> 01:32:40.548
No one in America, no actuary is going to tell you that there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that even Ted Turner was worried about back when he looked young.

01:32:42.927 --> 01:32:45.568
that all of these Western nations were gonna have to deal with.

01:32:45.609 --> 01:32:49.551
Let me make myself micro for a second and look at this data.

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:53.193
That's not a biological phenomenon over there.

01:32:56.315 --> 01:32:56.935
That's murder.

01:32:57.775 --> 01:32:58.556
That's lies.

01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:12.573
And it's on the back of an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, which makes it even more malevolent, as Kim Iverson so eloquently said, because that means they knew.

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:13.953
They did just, what?

01:33:14.793 --> 01:33:15.954
But the data's right there.

01:33:15.994 --> 01:33:17.514
You can see it in this graph.

01:33:17.594 --> 01:33:23.695
Moving up, they knew that the hospitals were gonna be full of old people, that we were gonna need more old folks homes.

01:33:24.936 --> 01:33:26.796
And old people die of pneumonia.

01:33:27.734 --> 01:33:29.375
It has a little bump every winter.

01:33:29.435 --> 01:33:31.076
See, it's every winter there's a little bump.

01:33:31.116 --> 01:33:32.137
It's okay, it's fine.

01:33:32.617 --> 01:33:37.561
You don't need to explain that to understand that what's happening during the pandemic is not this.

01:33:38.101 --> 01:33:40.863
And what's happening now seems to be this again.

01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:49.029
This is how they sculpted the murder with sophisticated.

01:33:49.049 --> 01:33:51.731
This is how they sculpted this anticipated rise.

01:33:53.427 --> 01:33:58.694
They neglected the opioid crisis to get the decrease in life expectancy.

01:33:58.854 --> 01:34:07.246
They use supplementary oxygen at the door in hospitals and attributed any symptomatic progression to COVID.

01:34:08.473 --> 01:34:15.319
That's how simple it is because supplementary oxygen is toxic and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:34:15.339 --> 01:34:30.193
And so any doctor that hears this message and understands that in 2020 or 2021, they were using supplementary oxygen without understanding it, they need to understand that they may be guilty of manslaughter or murder.

01:34:30.213 --> 01:34:33.076
Maybe it's manslaughter, I don't know what it is, but you're guilty of something.

01:34:34.349 --> 01:34:48.017
And the only reason, the only excuse you have is that they, in a military style, precision, they put people on social media to make sure that you didn't understand, including the supplementary oxygen part.

01:34:49.658 --> 01:35:00.865
They probably put people on the administration or made sure that the administrators of hospitals understood that under no circumstances should you talk about this, that we need to have more supplementary oxygen.

01:35:01.636 --> 01:35:04.217
And they might not have had the sophistication to understand it.

01:35:04.257 --> 01:35:09.318
And then they sent the old, the old attendings home and they let the residents run the hospital.

01:35:09.378 --> 01:35:10.138
And then here we are.

01:35:12.459 --> 01:35:21.601
And what I'm suggesting is that they put people on the internet, a team of performers that pretended that something else was going on and argued about it very, very vigorously.

01:35:23.862 --> 01:35:26.022
And those are the people that I came into contact with.

01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:29.623
Those are the people that I think are controlling people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:33.408
controlling him with an illusion of consensus.

01:35:33.468 --> 01:35:38.051
No matter who he talks to in this picture, they're all gonna tell him, oh yeah, definitely a virus.

01:35:38.091 --> 01:35:39.512
That Jonathan Cooey guy's nuts.

01:35:43.956 --> 01:35:46.278
Even though I think we almost got there.

01:35:46.318 --> 01:35:47.398
We almost broke it.

01:35:48.179 --> 01:35:49.140
That's why it's in the book.

01:35:52.338 --> 01:35:58.721
So remember on my website, you can download the McKinsey Global Institute PDF of the dependency and depopulation.

01:35:58.781 --> 01:36:06.784
You can see why this problem is ongoing and coming along and has been anticipated and what the consequences might be.

01:36:06.904 --> 01:36:13.066
Our children are going to inherit a different earth than we grew up on, and certainly our grandkids will.

01:36:13.707 --> 01:36:21.890
And so we need to send them into that future with the knowledge and understanding that we have been able to

01:36:23.413 --> 01:36:49.922
together during the last five years and make sure that the illusion of consensus created by these actors is not something that they inherit as an understanding of the world, but instead understand American history as having dodged a bullet with regard to this operation, whatever it is, that's supposed to invert our sovereignty on a global level to experimental animal status.

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:54.200
These people have put themselves in front of us, and so they're easy to see.

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.262
All you have to do is look at their time frames.

01:36:58.163 --> 01:37:10.432
I'm being told by people that I trust that Edward Bernays and that Noam Chomsky might not be good guys, that they might be on the same team as this impetus to control the species.

01:37:13.223 --> 01:37:22.032
But nevertheless, I would like to point out that the words that they use to describe what's going on can help people to understand what is happening.

01:37:23.334 --> 01:37:32.263
I do think that Edward Bernays' words are worth reading and understanding, even if there's a darker part of them that is not codified here.

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:45.398
that this is the bleached or safe message of Edward Bernays and the much more malevolent version of it that he would say in the presence of the overclass is different.

01:37:45.758 --> 01:37:47.540
Same with Noam Chomsky.

01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.961
Maybe he could say it even better.

01:37:49.762 --> 01:37:52.885
when he's with his cigar-smoking Epstein Island friends.

01:37:52.965 --> 01:37:53.465
I don't know.

01:37:53.886 --> 01:38:02.473
But I do think for somebody who doesn't understand what's going on, these are an interesting way to start thinking about it and realize that it's all been out there.

01:38:02.493 --> 01:38:06.796
They've been telling us for generations already that this is how we would be governed.

01:38:06.856 --> 01:38:14.402
And social media has allowed this governance by limited spectrum of debate to become very, very weaponized.

01:38:15.535 --> 01:38:17.158
Very, very, very dangerous.

01:38:17.779 --> 01:38:28.916
And that's why I think terms like Lollapalooza of liars or team worst case scenario can provoke the right idea of how bad it is if these people are willing to lie to us in concert.

01:38:30.913 --> 01:38:57.476
That's why it's important, again, to realize who said what when, who brought out who when, and who has ties to what with whose dad, and whose dad's worked for what, and who's made millions doing what, because these all line up in the wrong way, all the way to Shanahan and her statement about how we're gonna use AI to solve all of humanity's problems.

01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:02.302
Transfecting healthy people is nuts.

01:39:03.582 --> 01:39:06.183
Brian Hooker in 2013 might've said that.

01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:09.524
Brandy Vaughn, happy birthday, might've said that.

01:39:10.564 --> 01:39:18.647
Brandy Vaughn said injection versus ingestion was the comparison that you needed to do in order to understand how malevolent the vaccine schedule was.

01:39:19.087 --> 01:39:22.948
Brian Hooker was a contemporary of hers, so I have no doubt that he's heard that argument.

01:39:23.468 --> 01:39:24.569
But in 2020, he chose not to offer it.

01:39:27.768 --> 01:39:43.922
not to tell people that it was transfection, not to even question PCR as a diagnostic, even though as a 16-year veteran of transforming and transfecting plants, he most certainly used PCR on an almost daily basis, if only to find out which plants took up his gene.

01:39:45.723 --> 01:39:52.169
And so he could have told you why PCR as a diagnostic is a fraud or why overcycling was not the point.

01:39:53.462 --> 01:39:58.005
He could have told you that the only thing that these people have is synthetic recombinant genetics.

01:39:58.045 --> 01:39:59.666
They can make a lot of DNA.

01:39:59.706 --> 01:40:03.568
That's all he knew for sure and could have told you in 2020, I know.

01:40:03.588 --> 01:40:09.171
He could have told me that he knew this when I worked for him, but he didn't.

01:40:10.532 --> 01:40:14.894
He just plays dumb because he's just building a big top tent of health freedom.

01:40:14.914 --> 01:40:17.416
He's not trying to save or stop anything.

01:40:19.077 --> 01:40:20.818
Save anyone or stop anything.

01:40:22.369 --> 01:40:24.211
So they can make pure quantities of DNA.

01:40:24.231 --> 01:40:26.372
If they wanted to find it anywhere, they could put it there.

01:40:26.532 --> 01:40:27.493
That's the bottom line.

01:40:29.475 --> 01:40:32.637
We can talk about all the different ways that that could manifest itself.

01:40:32.958 --> 01:40:41.324
But if you have Brian Hooker in 2020 calling transfection a vaccine, that makes Brian

01:40:42.338 --> 01:40:42.839
culpable.

01:40:43.519 --> 01:40:46.602
It makes Brian part of it because he was sophisticated enough.

01:40:46.802 --> 01:40:51.106
He has the experience to know that he should have called it transfection or transformation.

01:40:51.546 --> 01:41:00.574
He had the experience like I did to know that there was a difference between the adenovirus transformation and the lipid nanoparticle transfection.

01:41:03.697 --> 01:41:06.640
And I think that it's terrible that he didn't tell us.

01:41:08.387 --> 01:41:10.989
because during that same year, I was trying to tell everybody.

01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:14.171
I think the only way they got away with it is with a placebo.

01:41:14.211 --> 01:41:16.532
I think that maybe is the way they've always got away with it.

01:41:17.953 --> 01:41:27.540
I think they get away with it because they even use endemic as a word that you can describe like the culture at work has racism kind of endemic to it.

01:41:30.762 --> 01:41:33.364
The culture of Congress has corruption.

01:41:33.404 --> 01:41:34.965
It's like endemic to Congress.

01:41:36.499 --> 01:41:38.119
This is a mythology.

01:41:38.319 --> 01:41:40.040
It is a enchantment.

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.820
It is a semantic enchantment.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:46.021
A molecule cannot go from a mud puddle to endemicity.

01:41:46.682 --> 01:41:48.022
RNA cannot pandemic.

01:41:48.062 --> 01:42:00.965
But a background could be misconstrued as a pandemic just using nonspecific PCR tests, especially if the goal was to just get everybody to submit to medical and genetic testing in perpetuity.

01:42:01.465 --> 01:42:04.906
You know, like the Human Genome Project has wanted for like 25 years.

01:42:10.213 --> 01:42:11.755
Thank you very much for joining me, everybody.

01:42:11.775 --> 01:42:13.177
See you again very soon.

01:42:13.337 --> 01:42:15.239
I don't know if I'm taking the weekend off yet or not.

01:42:15.259 --> 01:42:17.101
I probably am, but I don't know.

01:42:18.763 --> 01:42:22.748
We'll see how the wave of stuff comes from Kim's show.

01:42:22.888 --> 01:42:25.571
Please share that one far and wide and share this one as well.

01:42:25.992 --> 01:42:26.613
Thanks for being here.

01:42:26.633 --> 01:42:27.274
See you again soon.
