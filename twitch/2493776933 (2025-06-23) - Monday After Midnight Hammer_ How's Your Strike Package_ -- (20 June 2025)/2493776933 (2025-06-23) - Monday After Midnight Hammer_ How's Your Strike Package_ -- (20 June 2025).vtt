00:31.338 --> 00:35.260
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

00:37.061 --> 00:37.761
And I have lied.

00:37.781 --> 00:38.822
I'm sure I'll lie again.

00:38.842 --> 00:41.603
I don't want to lie, you know, and I don't think I'm a liar.

00:41.723 --> 00:42.764
I try not to be a liar.

00:42.784 --> 00:43.644
I don't want to be a liar.

00:44.204 --> 00:46.926
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:38.408 --> 02:58.817
I don't care how you get there.

02:58.837 --> 03:01.539
I don't care what you do to get there.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.100
The goal is to win.

03:09.675 --> 03:25.169
Oh man, somebody give this guy a hand here.

03:26.761 --> 03:27.361
Sorry about that.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.123
A little miscue there.

03:29.603 --> 03:30.404
Welcome to the show.

03:31.264 --> 03:36.227
First and foremost, please remember that the main goal is to get yourself off of social media.

03:36.688 --> 03:37.909
You don't need to use it at all.

03:38.929 --> 03:46.875
And when you do use it, you've got to use it very intentionally, following a very few people who are willing to be your filter or willing to

03:47.435 --> 03:52.238
protect you from the insanity there, the absolute malevolence.

03:52.418 --> 03:56.101
They have only one chance, they imagine, in history to collect this data.

03:56.581 --> 04:06.688
I'm going to make a couple arguments to support that today, give you a couple more examples of how these people have orchestrated the entire narrative to get us right where we are right now.

04:07.849 --> 04:12.732
First and foremost, the way that they did it was this myth of autism spectrum disorder.

04:12.772 --> 04:15.414
Yes, a myth of autism spectrum disorder

04:15.934 --> 04:25.742
is used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

04:26.582 --> 04:40.072
And you can say exactly the same thing about how they'd like college kids to be locked up in their dorm rooms, scared of pandemics and gain of function, because that way they can sample them and treat them like experimental animals forever.

04:41.393 --> 04:51.759
Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not understand why the cheese is free on social media, why the cheese is free for COVID, you will never escape.

04:52.220 --> 04:55.281
In fact, your children will be enslaved by this.

04:55.321 --> 04:56.682
But there's an easy way out.

04:56.842 --> 04:58.643
It's to learn biology for yourself.

04:59.244 --> 05:02.025
It's to learn what's true and what has been exaggerated.

05:03.346 --> 05:08.309
This is the biology that they love to ignore, gigaohm, biological.

05:11.547 --> 05:20.017
Yes, there's a guy that doesn't seem to be able to get on Twitch there, but I see Mark Housatonic of Housatonic Live.

05:21.118 --> 05:23.601
That guy is definitely worth watching, worth following.

05:23.941 --> 05:28.566
I'm going to follow up on his, let's call it a discovery of the

05:29.227 --> 05:38.193
the coinkydink between the Whittemore Institute and Mikovits and CFS and BabyGod.

05:38.834 --> 05:41.095
What an interesting set of keywords.

05:41.135 --> 05:45.418
And by the way, they killed a lot of people in Scotland, and there's a great substack about it.

05:45.658 --> 05:51.342
And him and I are friends, and I'm going to start promoting... Gosh, that's a terrible word.

05:51.883 --> 05:56.126
I'm going to start showing a few of those more moving testimonies.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.928
from the Scottish Inquiry.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.989
He sent me some useful links.

06:01.409 --> 06:02.490
I did receive them.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.631
I just have to work them in this week.

06:05.351 --> 06:10.734
I already had this deck pretty much done, so it's not gonna be today, but it'll be either tomorrow or Wednesday.

06:10.774 --> 06:11.775
Thank you again for that.

06:13.596 --> 06:19.059
And yeah, we're just standing here all by ourselves, but we are part of this.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.081
We are the guardians of this.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.841
If you've been here for a while, you know that.

06:25.001 --> 06:28.522
You know how you stay focused on the biology.

06:28.562 --> 06:33.203
You know how you don't take their bait on social media by trying to recognize it better.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.403
And you learn to love your neighbor.

06:35.483 --> 06:36.923
Learn to know who your neighbors are.

06:38.764 --> 06:42.104
If you gotta have neighbors on the internet, I guess you better damn well know who they are.

06:43.144 --> 06:44.265
That's really the trick here.

06:46.105 --> 06:50.386
This is what it looks like to stay focused.

06:50.406 --> 06:51.106
Watch his eyes.

06:51.386 --> 06:51.686
See that?

06:52.884 --> 06:53.624
Watch his eyes.

06:54.305 --> 06:54.665
See that?

06:55.245 --> 06:56.446
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

06:56.466 --> 06:58.026
You gotta stay focused on the biology.

06:58.046 --> 07:01.168
I wonder if you've ever seen a bald eagle catch a fish in slow motion.

07:03.629 --> 07:04.790
Watch his eyes.

07:05.530 --> 07:07.311
You gotta stay focused.

07:08.471 --> 07:15.034
You get hit in the head with the basketball at the shooting machine if you don't stay focused and that ball comes out and your eyes aren't on it.

07:16.675 --> 07:17.916
Look at those eyes.

07:20.143 --> 07:22.506
Magnificent snapback.

07:23.046 --> 07:24.288
Oh man, is that nice.

07:24.348 --> 07:26.811
Staying focused on the biology is what we try to do here.

07:27.251 --> 07:29.474
The voice that you hear is Jonathan Cooey.

07:29.634 --> 07:33.619
I am a former academic magician, academagician.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.882
Coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.264
I've got a nice little setup here though.

07:38.284 --> 07:39.225
It used to be a wood shop.

07:40.086 --> 07:42.628
And so I got a private room where I can get as loud as I want to.

07:43.128 --> 07:44.509
It's like having a second bedroom.

07:44.549 --> 07:52.575
So after all this time, I went from having my own little room at the University of Pittsburgh to having my own little room in the suburbs.

07:53.195 --> 07:55.957
Basically doing my own work, having my own rig.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.639
But this rig projects to the world.

07:59.360 --> 08:07.165
And I'm very, very humbled by the amount of support that I get that we can manage to do this for so long.

08:10.310 --> 08:14.895
My work is represented a lot of places and misrepresented a lot of places.

08:16.277 --> 08:17.759
I like the Wuhan cover-up book.

08:19.501 --> 08:24.006
I like the fact that I used to be a staff scientist for Children's Health Defense, but was fired by them.

08:24.747 --> 08:30.773
And I like the fact that I've had a lot of conversations with Jay Bhattacharya, so I know exactly

08:32.788 --> 08:36.613
I think I know a lot about the breadth of his understanding.

08:36.693 --> 08:40.338
You can find my original YouTube channel at JC on a Bike.

08:40.378 --> 08:41.760
It remains alive.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.104
I'm not streaming there right now simply because I don't want to risk it as a

08:46.070 --> 08:47.391
as a historical memory.

08:47.411 --> 08:53.613
I am instead streaming on JC on the Woods, although I'm not monitoring it, so I don't know for sure if I'm there, but I assume I am.

08:55.374 --> 08:58.115
Mr. Diggins catches me there a lot, tells me that it's working.

08:59.036 --> 09:03.978
And how it works is that there are about 110 people on Earth that support this work.

09:04.038 --> 09:06.599
I have a couple big subscribers, a couple big supporters.

09:07.259 --> 09:14.926
in the sense of they give me some reasonable percentage of my rent every month, which is something that isn't really fun.

09:15.827 --> 09:25.376
I don't know how many people enjoy this kind of work where you're asking for donations and working off of those donations dependent on them.

09:26.156 --> 09:27.838
I don't know anybody who would enjoy that.

09:27.918 --> 09:29.099
I certainly don't enjoy it.

09:29.179 --> 09:29.640
However,

09:31.710 --> 09:34.232
I feel like the work that I'm doing is actually paying off.

09:34.812 --> 09:41.157
You can see a map of where this all was and where we all are and where we're standing at GigaOMBiological.com.

09:41.177 --> 09:47.361
You'll find links for the live stream, links for our Biology 101 books and maps, and what we're going to get started on soon.

09:47.381 --> 09:48.242
And then, of course, stuff.

09:52.443 --> 09:56.469
I have been remiss in putting more on there that I said I was going to put on there.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.694
It has something to do with the host of my website.

10:00.714 --> 10:01.656
I'm not going to say anymore.

10:01.676 --> 10:06.422
I don't want to give too much away, but I will get to that or at least fix it so that I can.

10:06.582 --> 10:08.385
In the meantime, it is GigaOMBiological.com.

10:09.986 --> 10:32.158
RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injections are not medicine transfection and transformation would have been a crime if they'd have told you what it was and population pyramids they're real and they're used to to make decisions and that's why they didn't show you the population pyramid before the pandemic that's why that was a more privileged

10:33.138 --> 10:34.158
Privileged kind of thing.

10:35.479 --> 10:36.759
I'm very excited to be here.

10:36.779 --> 10:37.299
I got it.

10:37.599 --> 10:42.001
I got an unorganized show And I'm unshaven.

10:42.081 --> 10:59.286
So get ready for a less than optimal Morning appearance here, but I am on reasonably on time Which I'm gonna try and congratulate myself on even though it's not really that big a deal Hello, welcome to the show the captain's here again and

11:02.989 --> 11:12.596
I'm still stunned at how easy it is for me to go back into people's timelines and find places where these people appeared in person together.

11:13.637 --> 11:30.150
And then now to, for example, have, you know, Alex Zeck and Christine Massey and Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman having interacted with me while I was employed at CHD.

11:31.768 --> 11:54.585
trying to get me to represent CHD's scientific position about viruses, and trying to bring the two organizations together under the idea that RNA can't pandemic, that everything has been exaggerated, that the PCR test can't be this high-fidelity measurement, and that most importantly, what they definitely could do if they wanted a high-fidelity signal

11:55.643 --> 12:02.548
is make a synthetic construct at high purity, in high quantity, and put it in places.

12:05.010 --> 12:10.934
Now, it's extraordinary to me to find Alex Zek on stage with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

12:10.955 --> 12:11.335
in 2021.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.236
It's just, it's extraordinary.

12:13.376 --> 12:22.263
And it is extraordinary to think that that event and the event that followed the year afterward were associated with or even organized by Peggy Hall.

12:23.976 --> 12:31.018
It's all one malevolent team that has orchestrated this fake health freedom movement.

12:33.279 --> 12:41.122
And for whatever twisted reason or fate, it seems to be that there's only a couple of us that are destined to

12:42.990 --> 13:09.558
Expose it as a as the fake haha joke on on our our grandchildren that it is I'm still just horrified at how long I thought I was Successfully exposing what was going on and what was being done to us when in reality I was running in their hamster wheel chasing them around in circles and They knew it

13:11.266 --> 13:14.269
And it is so many people.

13:15.550 --> 13:17.672
So many people that have tried to text my wife.

13:17.752 --> 13:19.634
So many people that have tried to come to my house.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.396
So many people that have come to my house.

13:21.436 --> 13:34.128
So many people that have talked to me late at night and tried to counsel me on how to get the book done or how to turn this into money or how to set up a business with airport lockers and collectible cards.

13:35.609 --> 13:36.510
How to day trade.

13:40.356 --> 13:44.840
This fake health freedom movement is based around biological myths.

13:45.861 --> 13:52.988
And these biological myths have their foundation and have their roots in mentors that are from the 50s.

13:53.188 --> 13:58.973
Mentors that are from the same time that we still thought that radiation was cool.

13:59.554 --> 14:04.979
Radiation caused mutation and therefore we could use radiation to accelerate evolution.

14:06.701 --> 14:11.023
These were real ideas back in the 50s, back when we were trying to make things go boom.

14:12.965 --> 14:19.388
And a lot of those people, once their usefulness in making things go boom, they had to find something else.

14:19.448 --> 14:25.552
Where were they going to look for these last to be found universal laws of how shit works?

14:25.632 --> 14:27.313
Well, they became biologists.

14:28.223 --> 14:41.352
And they took their skills and their mathematics and their ability to generalize across, you know, particles and model particles mathematically and apply it to the molecules of life.

14:42.553 --> 14:45.736
And presumably these guys are the guys that had the toolbox to do it.

14:45.836 --> 14:47.077
And these are the guys that

14:47.904 --> 15:13.341
inevitably are responsible for there to being such a myth as endemicity, both the process by which a molecule surrounded by a fat bubble can go from a relatively small concentration to a concentration which is to be found everywhere on Earth, sustained there for eternity, or at least a significant amount of time.

15:14.687 --> 15:30.399
These are chemical consequences or chemical, let's say, phenomenon that we don't really have a lot of empirical data to support, yet it is a widely accepted phenomenon as fact.

15:30.939 --> 15:41.087
This is one of the reasons why bad biology is so hard to defeat, because it is based on a lot of assumptions that are accepted as fact.

15:41.954 --> 15:46.478
Endemicity as a process and an endpoint is accepted as fact.

15:47.059 --> 15:51.583
In fact, it's so accepted as fact that they've made Hollywood movies about it.

15:54.866 --> 15:58.309
Now, I'm going to switch down over here if you don't mind.

16:00.379 --> 16:09.223
This idea of endemicity being a myth is just one of these things that we can come to start to understand on a large and a small scale.

16:09.263 --> 16:14.305
The idea of going viral on the internet is actually an enchantment.

16:14.585 --> 16:26.390
A virus on the internet is actually enchantment because that, in many ways after five years, I can see is closer to being a real phenomenon

16:27.429 --> 16:36.832
and aptly described the computer virus than an actual virus, the mythology of the biological phenomenon.

16:36.972 --> 16:46.555
And so endemicity as a myth is so important to understand its effects because it is the basis for virology.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.355
It is the basis for pandemics.

16:48.415 --> 16:50.416
It is the basis for a PCR test.

16:51.056 --> 16:53.597
It is the basis for public health.

16:53.697 --> 16:56.338
It is the basis for pandemic preparedness.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.137
The process and endpoint.

17:02.200 --> 17:11.670
And so if you see how powerful it is that everybody can go around teaching you what this is without giving you any biological justification that this exists.

17:13.092 --> 17:13.773
The process.

17:16.479 --> 17:23.464
You know, paint can go endemic if you're not careful, so you've got to really close the lid of every can you have.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.244
Well, at least, no.

17:24.784 --> 17:28.227
Just the cans of paint that have fear and cleavage sites in them.

17:28.527 --> 17:30.528
That paint, boy, you really got to be careful.

17:30.728 --> 17:31.669
Don't spill that shit.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.832
That's a very apt description.

17:36.957 --> 17:56.882
for what now is claimed to have happened, and not only claimed to have happened by Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak and Nathan Wolf, but also claimed to have happened by Harvey Reich and Robert Malone and Norman Fenton and Jessica Rose and Claire Craig and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:57.962 --> 17:58.982
and Richard Ebright.

17:59.903 --> 18:01.263
You see, the list is endless.

18:02.279 --> 18:19.388
all of these people would argue, argue vociferously for the idea that something that was released in a mud puddle or leaked from a laboratory or sprayed in a bat cave has now essentially gone endemic.

18:21.689 --> 18:24.550
And we've got, we've got to dispel this myth.

18:24.890 --> 18:25.691
Stop lying.

18:27.232 --> 18:27.412
So

18:28.587 --> 18:33.491
Medical remnants are extremely valuable because of electronic medical records, okay?

18:33.531 --> 18:57.531
So you've just got to understand that electronic medical records can be hacked, they can be sold, they can be de-identified and sold, and they will be and have been and will be even more in the future de-identified and sold so that anybody that buys medical remnants and uses the standard technology to sequence those remnants knows who they came from, can find out very quickly

18:58.211 --> 19:00.673
This process is all underway right now.

19:01.494 --> 19:14.366
This is the primary reason why none of these people that I'm calling meddlers will ever question the idea of using a single pair of primers as a way of testing for a virus.

19:14.426 --> 19:16.088
They'll never do it again.

19:17.089 --> 19:21.933
Jessica Rose is never going to have a second thought about the next generation of PCR testing.

19:26.004 --> 19:33.186
Jessica Rose will never look back on the foundations of the mythology and realize that we have no PCR data from before 2020.

19:35.146 --> 19:46.469
And so why are we all so excited about it when the FDA could go back and open all those EUAs and we could reevaluate them all and we could test them all again and go, holy shit, these didn't work at all.

19:47.998 --> 19:50.519
And then we could ask ourselves, where did those remnants go?

19:50.579 --> 19:52.059
Where did all those swabs go?

19:52.099 --> 19:53.239
Did they throw them in the garbage?

19:53.259 --> 19:56.500
Were they burnt in a barrel behind the back in the back of the building?

19:58.241 --> 20:07.083
Or were they packaged up very neatly and shipped away to some other location previously arranged?

20:08.126 --> 20:13.408
maybe even provided by the people who encouraged the people to open the testing situation in the first place.

20:14.629 --> 20:24.372
Any testing outfit that opened up that didn't have a molecular biologist that was at the local university helping to open it up is fraud.

20:25.873 --> 20:32.956
There's nobody at the start of the pandemic that can make any excuse for opening up a testing place or a track and trace place

20:34.286 --> 20:47.220
Even if you had piles of money in your shed, it doesn't make sense for that to be the first response unless you're a real, real, real, real, real insightful asshole.

20:49.182 --> 20:55.326
And so these are all things that we could investigate, that we could look into, that we could reopen.

20:55.866 --> 20:58.847
And that would only require using the FDA in the right way.

20:59.188 --> 21:05.271
And that's exactly why we have foreigners at the head of the FDA that came in the Trojan horse of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:05.311 --> 21:05.471
show.

21:07.379 --> 21:13.641
all set up by Steve Bannon and Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone years ago already.

21:13.681 --> 21:27.165
The whole fake anti-vax movement was first rehearsed in the UK with Polly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield, and then they came over in the United States and repeated it with much more assistance from a Columbia professor named Mary Holland.

21:27.905 --> 21:46.521
some remote blogger about anthrax named Merrill Nass, and some guy who used to work for the government labs for 16 years genetically transforming and transfecting plants to grow medicines, Brian Hooker, they all got together and made a big top tent of health freedom, and here we are today.

21:47.697 --> 21:52.520
where the NHS is just announcing what I already told you and Mark already told you they were going to do.

21:53.161 --> 21:57.344
They need a remnant stream and they need your acceptance of it over there.

21:57.404 --> 21:58.284
They're going to just get it.

21:59.045 --> 22:00.606
They can already kill people over there.

22:02.547 --> 22:03.748
So, I mean, this is easy, right?

22:10.461 --> 22:14.488
And so what lessons can be learned from the management of the COVID-19 pandemic?

22:14.508 --> 22:15.910
I just thought I'd read this paper to you.

22:15.930 --> 22:19.476
It's a really interesting paper with some interesting authors.

22:19.496 --> 22:20.678
It's glorious.

22:24.378 --> 22:32.565
The background is in 2019, a cluster of patients with a novel acute respiratory illness was identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

22:33.046 --> 22:44.016
The infectious agent causing this illness was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the respiratory disease associated with the dubbed coronavirus disease 2019.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.940
Estimates of the severity of COVID-19 were alarming.

22:49.580 --> 22:53.685
Meanwhile, reports of the virus transmissibility were disturbingly high.

22:54.206 --> 23:02.455
Indeed, one case series estimated that 41% of the cases were nosocomial arising from hospital-associated transmission.

23:02.495 --> 23:03.036
Remember that?

23:03.997 --> 23:17.441
It was later estimated that the incidence of post-viral fatigue and other post-infection sequelae dubbed long COVID when associated with COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2 times greater than for influenza.

23:17.902 --> 23:18.582
Stop lying!

23:19.542 --> 23:24.145
The worldwide concern rapidly increased as cases were identified in other parts of the world.

23:24.205 --> 23:34.091
And on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared that there was a global COVID-19 pandemic or public health emergency of international concern.

23:36.412 --> 23:40.515
Computer models projections based on these early estimates were alarming.

23:40.555 --> 23:45.158
They predicted that unlike major interventions urgently implemented, oh, sorry,

23:46.092 --> 23:58.437
They predicted that unless major interventions were urgently implemented, most of the population would become infected within months, overwhelming the hospital capacity and resulting in many deaths.

23:59.157 --> 24:14.443
In response to these model predictions, governments around the world quickly implemented an unprecedented array of quote unquote, non-pharmaceutical interventions, stay at home measures in desperate effort to urgently reduce the spread of the virus.

24:15.916 --> 24:25.618
Governments modified the stringency of the NPIs, that would be non-pharmaceutical interventions, throughout the pandemic, sometimes introducing new measures.

24:26.458 --> 24:38.081
Example, the use of face masks was only introduced mid-222, 220, or increasing their stringency, but other times removing or reducing the extent of these measures.

24:39.062 --> 24:39.902
Sorry, I can't read it.

24:40.122 --> 24:41.023
It's very unclear.

24:41.803 --> 24:43.244
It's almost like a human wrote this.

24:44.084 --> 24:53.608
By early 2021, several pharmaceutical companies are announced that they had successfully developed COVID-19 vaccines that were safe and effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness.

24:55.518 --> 25:05.490
Many countries began vaccine vaccination programs typically starting with health care workers and the elderly, but eventually becoming population wide to maximize the

25:11.203 --> 25:24.252
percentage of population that was vaccinated, many governments introduced policies and strategies throughout 21 and 22 encouraging people to get vaccinated and discouraging people from remaining unvaccinated.

25:24.833 --> 25:34.840
Although many countries had reached high levels of COVID-19 vaccination by the mid to late 2021, again, before anybody really found principles besides me,

25:36.040 --> 25:42.104
The incidence of COVID-19 continued among both vaccinated breakthrough cases and unvaccinated.

25:42.144 --> 25:52.691
However, many speculated that even if the vaccines might be less effective against preventing infection than originally thought, they might potentially reduce the severity of disease and or the chances of death.

25:53.611 --> 26:01.436
Hence, the population-wide vaccine programs were continued and previously vaccinated people were encouraged to take additional booster doses.

26:04.685 --> 26:17.156
Finally, on May 5th, 2023, the WHO declared that while COVID-19 was here to stay, that means endemic, it was no longer a global health emergency.

26:17.236 --> 26:27.706
Hence, over subsequent weeks and months, governments that had not already done so proceeded to lift remaining non-pharmaceutical interventions or vaccine requirements.

26:28.689 --> 26:35.772
Since this declaration, the world is still coming to terms with the consequences of both the pandemic and the responses to the pandemic.

26:36.193 --> 26:44.677
However, in our opinion, there is already enough data and evidence to show that there were significant opportunities for improvement with the ladder, i.e.

26:45.117 --> 26:49.859
how the world collectively responded to the COVID-19 pandemic.

26:50.679 --> 26:56.182
Sounds like a very insightful summary of exactly the bullshit narrative of a Scooby-Doo.

26:57.918 --> 27:05.380
It sounds like an incredibly insightful summary written by somebody very uninformed.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.240
Very, very behind the ball.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.621
Very, very much on script.

27:10.561 --> 27:11.721
Is it Jeffrey Sachs?

27:13.122 --> 27:15.022
The guy who ran the Lancet Commission?

27:15.822 --> 27:18.263
Could this have been written by Brett Weinstein?

27:19.980 --> 27:23.403
Maybe this was, who else could this have been?

27:23.964 --> 27:25.866
Who else would be on this kind of paper like this?

27:26.326 --> 27:27.607
Maybe this is Steve Kirsch.

27:32.532 --> 27:32.932
Weird.

27:33.633 --> 27:37.536
Let me see who's the people on this paper here.

27:37.557 --> 27:38.878
Let me see if I can make that work.

27:42.092 --> 27:44.113
Let me see who's the people on this paper.

27:44.193 --> 27:44.934
Zoom in, please.

27:45.554 --> 27:46.915
Oh, look at here.

27:47.016 --> 27:48.877
Look at what the computer is showing us.

27:49.157 --> 27:49.878
Oh, wow.

27:49.978 --> 27:50.779
Claire Craig.

27:51.479 --> 27:52.240
She's from Heart.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.441
It's actually listing Heart there.

27:54.502 --> 27:57.224
So she just, I guess she just works for Heart.

27:57.244 --> 27:57.764
10, where's 10?

27:59.878 --> 28:02.899
Health Advisory and Recovery Team, London, UK.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.780
Yep, that's Hart.

28:04.620 --> 28:07.282
Norman Fenton, number 12, who do you work for?

28:07.322 --> 28:13.845
Hmm, School for Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University, London, UK.

28:14.565 --> 28:18.047
Stephen Hatfill, wow, I know that name from somewhere.

28:18.127 --> 28:25.270
Stephen Hatfill, number 14, London Center for Policy Research, New York, New York.

28:27.864 --> 28:48.347
let's see terese laurie number 18 the evidence-based medicine consultancy limited bath uk the evidence-based medicine consultancy limited hmm harvey reich number 23 what a joke that guy is uh

28:49.867 --> 28:54.193
School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States.

28:54.253 --> 28:54.974
Way to go, man.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.276
Jessica Rose.

28:56.496 --> 28:57.858
Oh, where is she faculty now?

28:59.430 --> 29:23.626
24 brownstone institute austin texas united states of america i think austin texas is also where andrew wakefield lives it's also where polly tommy lives it's also where that shithead uh barry weiss decided to start her fake organization and fake university like oh wow austin texas is a intellectual shithole

29:24.446 --> 29:51.263
and that's where the brownstone is based wow cool so jessica rose is technically an american now and carol sir saratka that's a name i also remember i'm not saying he's a bad guy but he is at the faculty of what what 29 sorry buckingham uk okay i just don't remember who carl so anyway it's pretty remarkable right because claire craig was actually

29:52.185 --> 30:02.033
the lead pathologist for a organization or funding experiment or something like that called the 100,000 Genomes Project in the UK before the pandemic.

30:02.093 --> 30:08.538
So she is like the UK version of Kevin McKernan, at least from the perspective of what she's into.

30:09.298 --> 30:15.663
I don't know if she has the technical expertise that the inventor extraordinaire Kevin McKernan does.

30:15.723 --> 30:16.924
I mean, that guy's a wizard.

30:17.004 --> 30:17.925
I have no doubt about the

30:20.166 --> 30:24.107
the breadth and depth of his knowledge in molecular biology exceeds mine.

30:24.167 --> 30:39.532
It definitely exceeds Claire Craig, but she was part of something that is very, very in the wheelhouse of what anybody like Craig Vettner or those kinds of people, they would want is this collection of genomes, the normalization of collecting that data.

30:40.333 --> 30:44.754
And so these people have the audacity of putting out a paper together

30:46.596 --> 30:59.520
I mean, Stephen Hatfield, Robert Malone and Jessica Rose on the same paper in 2025 is kind of like a real slap in the you are stupid face.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.862
Like they really don't think you can see shit.

31:03.762 --> 31:07.943
They really don't think anybody's gonna see this because it's probably in a really shitty journal.

31:08.504 --> 31:11.985
It'll probably only be promoted by people like Nick Hudson on X.

31:13.101 --> 31:29.430
And and panda and all these and it's not like you know, this is gonna be on the Danny Jones podcast anytime soon Although it is very curious that this week there will be an ACIP meeting and Robert Malone is on that committee now So it'll be very curious how visible he is how vocal he is that kind of thing?

31:31.191 --> 31:37.894
So, you know just to remind you, you know Harvey Reich Was on that paper.

31:37.934 --> 31:41.316
We just saw Jessica Rose Stephen Hatfield

31:42.438 --> 31:50.225
Robert Malone, those people all found themselves on stage with a lot of other people in a weird place in November of 2023.

31:51.206 --> 32:03.196
I think this is probably the most incriminating photo that I've found on the internet because there's no explanation for why these people would go here to do what they did there.

32:04.326 --> 32:08.348
There's just simply no explanation for why they wouldn't have done it anywhere else.

32:08.428 --> 32:16.031
Unless all of them were birdwatchers and all of them were really interested in a bird that was only gonna be in Romania.

32:16.111 --> 32:26.056
Then maybe I can imagine a scenario where all the people that look like this would be in the same place at the same time.

32:26.096 --> 32:29.517
Because the only thing I can come up with really is birdwatchers.

32:29.717 --> 32:31.318
What else could they possibly be?

32:33.706 --> 32:37.068
maybe insect enthusiasts.

32:37.128 --> 32:38.528
It could be an insect conference.

32:39.569 --> 32:42.830
I mean, they, you know, they look like people who could go on a hike.

32:42.930 --> 32:45.092
That's why I'm saying birdwatching conference.

32:45.112 --> 32:48.613
So, you know, if they were all in Romania for something like that, it would make sense.

32:49.193 --> 32:58.398
But if these people are trying to do anything for their home countries, and they have collectively decided that this is the best place to do it,

33:01.806 --> 33:20.522
Now this is in November of 2023 that this ACIP member, this soon to be candidate for governor in Ohio, this ultra dipshit, Nick Hudson, one of my personal worst, worst favorite people on earth,

33:22.189 --> 33:32.397
Why is Byron Bridle over there except to be bamboozled by all these people surrounded by them in a context where they can say whatever they want and nobody will hear it?

33:35.188 --> 33:40.249
And it'll go down in their, all their memories is like, wow, we really did something over there, didn't we?

33:40.289 --> 33:41.850
Man, everybody was listening to me.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.791
But then we go back to America and nobody says Byron Bridle's name anymore.

33:45.871 --> 33:53.192
Nobody says that Byron Bridle was speaking out when Robert Malone blew the whistle on himself to take all the spotlight away from Byron Bridle.

33:53.212 --> 33:54.533
The timing was just gross.

33:55.213 --> 33:56.333
Nobody's gonna say that.

33:56.373 --> 33:57.893
That's why he's there.

33:58.014 --> 33:59.414
That's why this happened.

34:00.182 --> 34:20.607
But if you don't understand how awful it is that now, in 2025, a lot of these people are putting out a paper together, including a guy who works at the CDC, a Brownstone fraud, Ditra, Hu, Gavi, Salve, Merck,

34:22.614 --> 34:31.625
I mean, never mind the Vykal, and never mind Inovio, never mind all that shit.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.649
Never mind the Winburr Institute.

34:37.032 --> 34:39.615
The only person that's missing here is Judy Mikovits.

34:39.796 --> 34:41.358
If she would have been on this stage,

34:42.682 --> 34:44.964
I don't know, I guess it wouldn't matter, no one would give a shit.

34:45.084 --> 34:48.027
I could put Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:48.107 --> 34:54.813
and Alex Zek and Andrew Kaufman and Judy Mikovits on this stage and still nobody would give a shit.

34:55.113 --> 34:56.274
That's how sad it is.

35:01.039 --> 35:03.401
So why do I not like Denny Rancor?

35:03.441 --> 35:08.645
Well, because he seems to be put in place just to make sure that nobody sees

35:09.502 --> 35:12.343
that there is an explanation for this.

35:14.224 --> 35:16.865
There's an explanation for it and it's called murder.

35:17.545 --> 35:25.228
And this guy's out there telling you that there was no rise in all cause mortality until after the shots were rolled out.

35:27.088 --> 35:31.690
There is no rise in all cause mortality until after the shots rolled out.

35:31.770 --> 35:32.990
That's what he says now.

35:33.650 --> 35:34.891
That's not what he was saying here.

35:41.331 --> 35:50.216
He was saying that it was poverty level, household income, serious mental illness, obesity, and the excess mortality is a direct correlation across all states.

35:50.236 --> 35:54.458
You see, there was a different paper and a different set of conclusions.

35:54.518 --> 35:58.520
And then he went to Romania and came up with a little bit different set of conclusions.

35:59.901 --> 36:03.142
And all those people came back from Romania and said, Denny Rancourt is great.

36:03.182 --> 36:05.844
He says 17 million people have been killed from the shot.

36:07.418 --> 36:14.561
doesn't say that there's no evidence of spread and doesn't explain that the no evidence of spread is because there was an expected rise in all-cause mortality.

36:15.181 --> 36:20.723
And since it's an expected rise in all-cause mortality, then it's not an unexpected rise in all-cause mortality.

36:20.763 --> 36:25.745
The unexpected rise in all-cause mortality apparently only starts when the shot rolls out.

36:27.746 --> 36:34.148
But what he's not telling you is that that expected rise in all-cause mortality is still a rise in all-cause mortality.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.407
And that rise in all-cause mortality was anticipated.

36:38.887 --> 36:42.608
He told you that it was true with and without vaccines.

36:42.648 --> 36:45.029
He told you it wasn't correlated with age.

36:45.529 --> 36:51.271
Those two things add up to the opioid crisis and the population pyramid.

36:51.391 --> 36:51.871
That's it.

36:53.531 --> 36:55.552
It's so simple, it's awful.

36:56.012 --> 36:57.493
It's so simple, it's gross.

36:57.733 --> 37:02.334
It's so simple that it's inexcusable that nobody's ever done the math at this point in time.

37:03.971 --> 37:12.418
Because if it's not correlated with age, which is what he was telling us in his earlier papers, this paper only goes till 2021.

37:12.478 --> 37:15.980
You see, there was an evolution of Denny Rancourt.

37:18.022 --> 37:28.290
And that evolution of Denny Rancourt was supposed to put Denny Rancourt in a position to then say, no, according to my 150 figures and my longest paper ever written,

37:29.878 --> 37:34.282
There was no rise in all-cause mortality until the shots came out.

37:34.922 --> 37:36.063
This man is a traitor.

37:36.624 --> 37:37.745
He is a paid liar.

37:38.823 --> 37:47.625
And I am a hundred percent sure of it because again, the anticipated rise in all cause mortality and the primary source of drop in life expectancy needs to be hidden.

37:48.065 --> 38:01.688
And that is what he does because he will as explicitly said in the both presence of me and on another podcast that he does not think that he does not see any explanation for this.

38:01.728 --> 38:02.508
He's not aware.

38:02.888 --> 38:04.529
He doesn't think it's the opioids.

38:05.369 --> 38:06.709
He's figured that in already.

38:10.745 --> 38:14.148
The same scam might be being pulled on many countries at once.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.869
They might have done this in Scotland.

38:15.909 --> 38:17.510
They may be doing this in Canada.

38:17.550 --> 38:19.071
They may be doing this in the UK.

38:19.111 --> 38:19.752
I'm not sure.

38:21.874 --> 38:26.057
I'm using the CDC numbers because those are the numbers that Denny Rancourt loves to use.

38:27.278 --> 38:29.379
He uses all the numbers that he's provided.

38:29.439 --> 38:32.102
There's no work he does himself.

38:33.138 --> 38:42.007
It's all a weird kind of thing that these people are pulling because after many, many discussions, there's no, what is this?

38:43.108 --> 38:45.009
I can do that with a PowerPoint line.

38:49.073 --> 38:54.959
There was a background, ladies and gentlemen, it's an irreducibly complex genetic background upon which they can bullshit.

38:56.465 --> 39:05.155
And they timed their bullshitting with this bump in the population pyramid that more or less correlates with the prosperity after World War II.

39:06.376 --> 39:15.446
The reason why that bump is not sustained in a pyramid shape all the way down is because they encouraged people not to have so many kids and indeed family size dropped.

39:17.113 --> 39:25.502
So there is a coming decrease in fertility in our society as these people pass out of childbearing age.

39:25.542 --> 39:32.770
And that decrease in fertility is going to be pointed to as all kinds of things going wrong, but it's already in the population pyramid.

39:33.210 --> 39:39.217
They can continue to tell you stories about this biology as long as they don't tell you about this biology.

39:41.072 --> 39:56.042
And the most important thing to see here is that that signal that they used with Murder and Lies, that they sculpted with Murder and Lies, that anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, the big families after World War II, this is all foreseen.

40:00.822 --> 40:02.844
And it was a problem that needed sculpting.

40:02.884 --> 40:04.146
And you can see it right there.

40:04.206 --> 40:08.391
You can see it right there because we had pneumonia under control for years.

40:08.431 --> 40:09.692
And then we lost control of it.

40:09.752 --> 40:11.014
Now we got control of it again.

40:11.926 --> 40:21.928
And so an anticipated rise in all cause mortality was sculpted using murder and lies in order to create the illusion of a pandemic so that we would teach this mythology to our children.

40:22.388 --> 40:24.748
There's a whole list of ways that people were killed.

40:25.369 --> 40:37.851
One of the most malevolent and dirty ways that people were killed is that they get put on the path to acute respiratory distress syndrome simply by being given supplementary oxygen.

40:39.159 --> 40:52.366
And Mark and I suspect that this is how Grace Shara ultimately was put into this category, was that it was induced ARDS.

40:52.566 --> 40:53.567
It was called COVID.

40:55.087 --> 40:57.028
And supplementary oxygen can do that.

40:57.269 --> 40:58.609
Ventilators can make it worse.

40:59.310 --> 41:03.012
Ventilators can do it by themselves, of course, if you're ventilating people that can talk.

41:03.872 --> 41:17.862
And a lack of antibiotic use in response to any type of infection or systemic symptoms, because viral syndromes can't be treated with antibiotics, would result in a lot more people dying.

41:18.002 --> 41:19.323
A lot more people dying.

41:21.124 --> 41:23.266
And now at the same time, if you set up

41:24.346 --> 41:30.288
the American public with a CDC policy in 2016, which oh, that's awesome.

41:30.308 --> 41:30.968
Bring it over here.

41:31.748 --> 41:33.949
I got a huge pile of mail here.

41:34.169 --> 41:34.709
That's great.

41:36.289 --> 41:45.772
That you set up the American public where you put a bunch of people on the street, you put a bunch of desperately addicted people in search of a fix.

41:47.290 --> 41:58.039
at a crucial time when you're also shutting down society and shutting down these fundamental infrastructures, then leave the opioids on the street and more importantly, put deadly ones out there.

41:58.059 --> 42:05.244
And now you're really sculpting with murder and lies because you're reducing life expectancy in America by the opioid crisis.

42:05.284 --> 42:13.431
And at the same time, managing your old people with a simple trick, supplementary oxygen and ventilators, maybe even dexamethasone and back to the,

42:14.051 --> 42:17.853
the old folks home like Robert Malone explained to Paul Cottrell in 2021.

42:22.535 --> 42:27.057
And so this background signal can be misconstrued as something going endemic.

42:27.897 --> 42:31.139
All they have to do is spectacularly commit themselves to that lie.

42:31.919 --> 42:38.782
They can pretend that transfection worked if they rolled out a bunch of placebos and stuck to that lie.

42:40.427 --> 42:43.969
and they will stick to the lie of the PCR forever.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.349
That's how you can see it.

42:46.009 --> 42:47.830
None of them will ever talk about it again.

42:49.731 --> 42:50.771
These tests are rubbish.

42:52.212 --> 42:52.712
It's junk.

42:55.133 --> 43:08.819
Community mayors are spending thousands of dollars on this crap, trying to screen their employees and their nursing homes for something that's not going to turn positive for a week, even though you're infectious.

43:11.690 --> 43:18.853
I said, dude, you need these capture antigen things, where you're not looking for antibodies, you're actually looking for the virus.

43:20.194 --> 43:21.134
So they're expensive.

43:22.555 --> 43:28.918
But the antibody is what's on the membrane, the antibody specific for the COVID virus.

43:30.538 --> 43:35.621
So patient sample, mix it up, but the whole virus is coming through.

43:35.641 --> 43:38.862
And if it latches one of them,

43:40.427 --> 43:42.849
another antibody comes through and it turns color.

43:43.069 --> 43:44.750
You get like the pregnancy test kit.

43:46.511 --> 43:54.456
The first one of these I saw, we, 2021, we had to go to Rome to speak to the Italian Senate.

43:56.258 --> 43:59.560
And I'm not vaccinated.

43:59.580 --> 44:01.101
I don't have a card.

44:01.881 --> 44:03.142
Neither did Dr. Malone.

44:03.362 --> 44:05.824
He didn't have a card.

44:06.690 --> 44:08.691
So, yeah, I know you can't come in, yeah.

44:09.192 --> 44:10.393
So we're raising hell.

44:11.894 --> 44:15.877
So they go in and take us to see the Senate doctor.

44:15.897 --> 44:19.519
And he's got these little rapid flow can, he rips it open.

44:19.539 --> 44:28.425
And I'm reading this thing, antigen test kit, not antibody, antigen, the protein.

44:28.706 --> 44:30.987
It's testing for spike protein.

44:32.308 --> 44:33.729
And it's accurate.

44:34.430 --> 44:35.771
It's a lateral flow test.

44:36.854 --> 44:37.494
just so you know.

44:37.934 --> 44:43.957
And it's as accurate as the PCR test would have been if you ran it at a CT of like 30.

44:45.438 --> 44:57.003
And so he went to Rome and the guy showed him a test that he'd never seen before and then claims that it's as accurate as a PCR test at a certain cycle count.

44:58.964 --> 45:01.225
I mean, can you hear that it's all one enchantment?

45:02.065 --> 45:28.238
Grover or Tickle Me Hatfill has just unbelievably recounted an experience which implants and fortifies, edifies the concept that there are tests out there, the tests work, the threshold or the cycle count that you choose determines the accuracy of the PCR test.

45:29.431 --> 45:31.212
But lateral flow tests work different.

45:31.252 --> 45:33.312
They test for the antigen, for the protein.

45:33.392 --> 45:33.832
Whoa.

45:35.793 --> 45:39.314
They're as accurate as the PCR test cycled out to 45, man.

45:39.354 --> 45:40.314
That's crazy, right?

45:41.635 --> 45:46.136
That's like a six-cylinder engine with a double turbo and twin headers and blah, blah, blah.

45:52.118 --> 45:53.098
It's pretty remarkable.

45:54.919 --> 45:58.440
That's that guy right there standing right in front of Nick Hudson.

46:01.189 --> 46:16.335
who worked with Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler to waste my time for more than a year before he used Panda and a couple lame ass bench warming virologists named Mary and Jennifer.

46:16.515 --> 46:24.378
I think Jennifer was from Hawaii and Mary the virologist actually did a stream with Kevin McCairn once, which is just, it's absurd.

46:25.543 --> 46:39.105
And those two joined Panda not too long after my second presentation, then the third presentation, and then Nick Hudson lost all of those, never posted those on Rumble, he just posts all the other ones, you know, like Mark Giraudeau, he's so smart.

46:39.965 --> 46:54.688
So we have all these people, and they've all been coordinated on the same script, and they've all been in places together so that even if there are some well-meaning people in here, you know, even if Brian Hooker's really just that dumb,

46:59.142 --> 47:01.183
It's impossible that they're all just random.

47:01.963 --> 47:05.345
They are on a script provided by Kevin McCarran and Robert Malone.

47:05.545 --> 47:10.027
They are national security operators, part of a controlled demolition of America.

47:10.707 --> 47:21.792
They might even just be Democratic DNC operatives that have used Robert F. Kennedy as a Trojan horse to get their shitheads in power, but it doesn't really make

47:22.697 --> 47:24.038
complete sense that way.

47:24.098 --> 47:26.779
It doesn't feel like the Democrats are doing this.

47:26.839 --> 47:40.965
It really feels like it's a third party outside of Republicans or Democrats that are now kind of taking over the Republican movement, whatever Trump was, because of course Trump isn't going to be anything in three more years.

47:42.073 --> 47:43.534
And so what is that gonna become?

47:43.594 --> 47:45.815
And that's what this fight is for right now.

47:45.895 --> 47:53.318
How do we take this amorphous mass of cats and try to keep it together and keep it moving in the way that we want it to move?

47:53.398 --> 47:56.279
And so these people have all been briefed on that.

47:56.619 --> 48:02.882
These people have all been more or less understood that the big top tent of health freedom is something you can never question.

48:03.362 --> 48:06.404
And the big top tent of the pandemic is something you can never question.

48:06.424 --> 48:09.225
The big top tent of autism is something you can never question.

48:11.058 --> 48:14.842
Got to be really careful, you know, because we don't want to win.

48:14.942 --> 48:17.564
If we win, then, you know, we have to get all day jobs again.

48:18.565 --> 48:21.128
In condition that we will not call autism.

48:21.268 --> 48:22.829
I don't like the word autism.

48:23.450 --> 48:24.731
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

48:24.992 --> 48:33.560
And so a guy with 16 years of experience in biotech, um, you know, transforming and transfecting plants to make medicines.

48:35.239 --> 48:37.780
In 2013, did not call it autism.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.781
He didn't like the word autism.

48:40.081 --> 48:41.982
His son was vaccine damaged.

48:43.363 --> 48:45.164
He was toxically damaged.

48:45.184 --> 48:46.004
He was poisoned.

48:47.125 --> 48:55.089
And then in 2022, he was building a big top tent for health freedom at the Freedom Crusade with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:55.829 --> 48:57.510
and Mikovits and all them.

48:59.611 --> 49:08.337
And so then he's in front of the Senate in 2024 saying autism and still building that big top tent of health freedom right after he fired me.

49:11.107 --> 49:15.449
And so it's really Brian Hooker's spectacular commitment to these lies is all that's required.

49:15.489 --> 49:19.310
Cause you can hear in 2013, he wasn't talking like this.

49:19.670 --> 49:21.471
He would never have talked like this.

49:21.831 --> 49:23.192
We will not call autism.

49:23.352 --> 49:24.892
I don't like the word autism.

49:25.532 --> 49:26.833
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

49:27.173 --> 49:32.055
He was neurologically damaged condition condition that we will not call autism.

49:32.215 --> 49:33.755
I don't like the word autism.

49:34.416 --> 49:35.676
Um, he was vaccine damaged.

49:35.896 --> 49:40.378
And so the only way to explain this is that this is a, an orchestrated script.

49:42.930 --> 49:47.694
that's very carefully omitting all of the biological principles that would have freed us.

49:48.175 --> 49:55.041
And if you look back in time, you can see that they've pulling this shit off for a really long time using symbology.

49:55.101 --> 49:56.122
That's not good.

49:59.425 --> 50:03.208
This is California jam for, for chiropractor either.

50:03.248 --> 50:09.134
I think Brandy Vaughn has spoken at and Tony Barker has spoken out, but you can't find that on their websites.

50:10.629 --> 50:12.531
Russell Brand was there in 2020.

50:12.832 --> 50:15.214
He was there in a couple, three years.

50:15.274 --> 50:17.437
Del Bigtree's been there multiple times.

50:17.998 --> 50:19.479
She's been there multiple times.

50:19.539 --> 50:20.921
He's been there multiple times.

50:20.961 --> 50:26.848
Look at the, how can Zach Bush have been on the same stage as these people and they all not be on the same team?

50:29.039 --> 50:38.325
How can they all be singing these separate songs on separate street corners, claiming that you have to donate to their nonprofit in order to save the world?

50:38.365 --> 50:39.766
How is that even possible?

50:39.806 --> 50:40.967
How does that make sense?

50:42.948 --> 50:45.070
That it's been going on for so long.

50:49.673 --> 50:53.856
The freedom crusade in 2021, this guy was already using his symbol.

50:56.582 --> 51:02.785
on stage, the same stage as Sherry Tenpenny, as Robert Malone, I mean, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:03.306 --> 51:10.109
So the idea that the NoVirus group is in opposition to CHD is just, it's just wrong.

51:10.189 --> 51:11.310
It's not real at all.

51:13.011 --> 51:18.013
CHD and the NoVirus people were working together to fool me.

51:19.154 --> 51:22.576
Like they probably work together to fool everyone on the internet.

51:23.769 --> 51:32.937
with their clever use of anonymous accounts and their clever promotion of parallel, similar ideas, but not really.

51:34.038 --> 51:40.484
So that no matter where you find yourself, skeptical of CHD or not, you still find yourself trapped by the same show.

51:40.544 --> 51:46.609
That's why they were on the same stage in 2021 and then separated to do no more damage, you know, like the Ghostbusters.

51:48.615 --> 51:57.180
That's why these two jackasses were on stage together posing, you know, Venom Man, the guy that was on Red Pill stage about an hour before me.

52:01.102 --> 52:07.445
The guy that's on all the, you know, all the conservative media telling everybody about all the poisons that these guys are making.

52:09.126 --> 52:12.268
And this is the guy who didn't use the word autism, didn't like the word autism.

52:12.368 --> 52:13.709
It's he was vaccine damaged.

52:13.749 --> 52:15.430
He was neurologically damaged and it's,

52:16.249 --> 52:18.971
It's a neurological condition that we will not call autism.

52:19.031 --> 52:20.373
I don't like the word autism.

52:21.774 --> 52:38.708
This is him smiling in 2022 after two years of murder in America, after two years of murder in America, after a year of a rollout of a shot, boy, it's, it's a real good time in America, ain't it?

52:41.607 --> 52:42.648
Judy Mikovits.

52:43.028 --> 52:45.070
Look at this Alex Zek child.

52:45.650 --> 52:50.374
Here he is in his May 2021 podcast, I guess right after this.

52:52.075 --> 52:52.675
Same year.

52:54.917 --> 52:55.938
Now look at what he does.

52:56.158 --> 52:58.620
Look, look at what he's done since 2021.

52:59.861 --> 53:01.502
Just get my big head out of the way here.

53:02.743 --> 53:06.866
So in January of 2024, you had Mark, Mark Bailey on.

53:10.154 --> 53:15.801
And then in 2024, in March, he had Tom Cowan on with the New Biology Clinic.

53:19.045 --> 53:25.093
Then in March of 2024, this guy was talking about water fasting, healing your mind, body, and spirit.

53:26.414 --> 53:37.139
Then in 2024, in April, he had this Daniel guy on who was just recently featured with Sam Bailey on, what's her name?

53:37.299 --> 53:40.120
Peggy Hall, the Healthy Americans podcast.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.241
So it's all one show.

53:42.221 --> 53:48.484
It's not just because they're all on each other's podcasts, it's because they were also on CHD five years ago.

53:48.524 --> 53:49.664
It's all the same show.

53:50.225 --> 53:53.406
This guy is the vitamin A dude, the toxic bile guy.

53:54.582 --> 53:57.966
who's got a great following on Twitter and sticks right in his lane.

53:58.647 --> 54:01.890
Just kind of jibber-jabs, but not really does anything dangerous.

54:02.050 --> 54:03.552
That's exactly what they need.

54:04.013 --> 54:06.055
This is Vanny Hari, isn't she?

54:06.676 --> 54:08.077
Wasn't she in front of the Senate?

54:08.177 --> 54:10.420
Wasn't she also in front of Congress?

54:11.221 --> 54:13.844
Isn't this like the foodie food lady or some shit like that?

54:15.402 --> 54:17.824
It was definitely somebody that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:17.864 --> 54:18.525
brought forward.

54:18.925 --> 54:24.570
And then Alex Zek says, how to think imperialism, rationalism, and mysticism.

54:24.590 --> 54:25.851
Who the hell is this guy?

54:27.392 --> 54:28.073
What has he done?

54:30.936 --> 54:32.777
What life experience does he have?

54:33.157 --> 54:36.578
Then Mr. Tom Cowan, rethinking DNA in November 24.

54:37.618 --> 54:47.881
Meredith Miller, twice on my stream, recommended to me by Stephen Frost of the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International, one time even featured in a video that Robert Malone made.

54:51.877 --> 54:54.838
I'm not saying that Meredith Miller knows that she's being used.

54:54.918 --> 55:01.860
I'm saying that Meredith Miller has never supported me, has heard my story, I think, but not really because I've only interviewed her.

55:04.681 --> 55:08.823
And she's got a very cool, neat, tidy story.

55:10.523 --> 55:11.764
And maybe it's real.

55:11.844 --> 55:12.604
Maybe it's true.

55:16.718 --> 55:23.060
Alex Zek, reframing infectious disease paradigm in January, 2025, because he's just been reading so much.

55:23.941 --> 55:26.022
He can tell you exactly how to redefine that.

55:26.442 --> 55:33.545
And then in February of 2025, Kaylee and Alex Zek are parenting, relating and life balancing and more.

55:33.785 --> 55:37.146
Ask us anything because they're just experts on it.

55:38.476 --> 55:44.279
I wonder if it's the same philosophy that Doc Malek has for relationships.

55:44.859 --> 55:47.460
Five miles a day running and something else a lot?

55:47.600 --> 55:48.201
I can't remember.

55:49.901 --> 55:56.945
Dr. Andy Kaufman exposing medical myths, psychedelic drugs, virology, diet, and more with the long hair.

56:00.927 --> 56:05.409
And then finally, in May of 2025, we have Roman Bystranik.

56:06.389 --> 56:07.690
This is the co-author.

56:08.743 --> 56:12.666
of this absolutely, at this point, old, awful book.

56:13.787 --> 56:25.738
It's a great book, but it's from 2013, and the authors of this book haven't made any progress beyond sharing the one graph in this book that shows that infectious disease went down with sanitation, not with vaccines.

56:26.887 --> 56:28.208
It's the only thing they've ever done.

56:28.928 --> 56:29.348
That's it.

56:29.868 --> 56:31.189
That's our story.

56:31.209 --> 56:31.929
Thank you very much.

56:32.029 --> 56:32.610
Mic drop.

56:33.030 --> 56:34.070
That's what they did here.

56:34.531 --> 56:36.551
And then they just keep repeating it.

56:36.592 --> 56:44.915
It's like the same comedy routine for the last 24 years or 14 years or whatever the hell it is.

56:45.075 --> 56:45.976
It's appalling.

56:47.716 --> 56:52.579
There's no excuse for that guy being on this show except that it's all one malevolent network of liars.

56:54.915 --> 57:02.690
And even if they plan to eventually titrate us to the truth, that intramuscular injection of any of those other forms was just so stupid.

57:03.611 --> 57:04.533
But this new one's good.

57:06.076 --> 57:07.098
It will never be the truth.

57:13.072 --> 57:22.536
And so what they have done is essentially they've conjured a new gold standard diagnostics and a new gold standard countermeasures toolkit without a scientific basis in reality.

57:23.177 --> 57:41.205
You or rather your family and friends and most of the English speaking world, the Western world has come to accept PCR as a new gold standard diagnostic and has come to accept transfection as a pretty well-proven scientific tool.

57:42.571 --> 57:51.057
that has all kinds of uses, curing cancer, curing genetic diseases, reprogramming cells, the whole nine yards, they can do it.

57:52.578 --> 57:56.801
They can even create self-replicating RNA, apparently, and they can probably spray that.

57:57.341 --> 58:09.590
So they've conjured a new gold standard of diagnostics, a new gold standard of toolkit, and they've also basically conjured a new level of danger.

58:10.729 --> 58:13.011
in both the natural world and in the laboratory.

58:13.732 --> 58:25.622
Without any basis in scientific reality, this all occurred because of an elaborate theater that was almost exclusively on the internet and almost exclusively on a couple platforms.

58:27.464 --> 58:28.785
That's really the reality of it.

58:29.806 --> 58:31.047
Why did that disappear like that?

58:31.067 --> 58:32.228
Did I not time that right?

58:34.370 --> 58:34.570
Oh yeah.

58:36.144 --> 58:39.618
We're going to take a brief musical break and then we'll be right back.

58:40.161 --> 58:40.783
I hope you enjoy it.

59:14.002 --> 59:15.946
but you can tell if someone's lying.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:34.366
I don't care.

01:00:34.406 --> 01:00:35.635
I'm not gonna change.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.631
Get your mic up, get your mic up, get your mic up.

01:02:37.711 --> 01:02:43.853
Hey, ladies and gentlemen, they are all scripted bullshitters on Robert Malone's and Kevin McKernan's bullshit script.

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:47.735
It's been a long, strange trip getting here all by myself.

01:02:49.215 --> 01:02:50.656
I am not here really by myself.

01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:55.658
I'm actually also here with a guy by the name of Mark Kulak, a guy by the name of Joe Marshall.

01:02:56.978 --> 01:03:02.921
The other day, I was already showing you that I think, without a doubt, Peggy Hall's long list of

01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:08.208
of Koinkydinks makes it likely that she's all just part of this same show as well.

01:03:08.348 --> 01:03:10.010
Also likely scripted very early.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:19.083
Lots of connections with Judy Mikovits who of course you know if you don't know anything about what Mark Kulak is doing please go find out about his last few shows

01:03:20.184 --> 01:03:23.206
And check out this stuff in Nevada because it's really crazy.

01:03:24.147 --> 01:03:27.248
This birth rate implosion and this old Jeffrey Tucker thing.

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:31.050
He's a funny guy, but he's also one of these frauds that's been put in place.

01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:36.473
Again, you heard that Jessica Rose is a Brownstone fellow working out of Austin, Texas.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:37.594
What a joke.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:42.679
Dr. Drew has got to be the most obvious fake on the internet.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.664
Here's something that I find interesting that I'm just going to put out there right now.

01:03:47.865 --> 01:03:49.808
Simply because this is 2025.

01:03:50.428 --> 01:03:55.294
This was basically, I believe, Sunday morning right after the bombing in Iran.

01:03:55.715 --> 01:03:57.977
I think this is one of the worst Americans alive.

01:03:59.138 --> 01:04:00.739
I think that she's a total fraud.

01:04:00.759 --> 01:04:02.700
I think she's a scripted fraud.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.921
And I think that she's an absolute buffoon.

01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:17.385
I don't think that she knows how awful the things that are happening are and how horribly played a lot of these people are and how horribly she is being played by a lot of these people.

01:04:17.505 --> 01:04:22.647
I do not intend to play this video, but I do want you to see her face.

01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:25.629
And I do want you to hear who she's talking to.

01:04:25.669 --> 01:04:38.724
She's talking to an Israeli national and a Turkish national, which is kind of interesting because again, remember, in 2022, there was a cruise with Robert Malone and his wife and a bunch of these dissidents off the coast of Turkey.

01:04:39.545 --> 01:04:42.568
Dr. Oz, who's the head of CMS in the U.S.

01:04:42.608 --> 01:04:47.835
government under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is actually a Turkish citizen who has served in the Turkish army.

01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:54.483
And so now we're going to have a child who works as part of a fake news organization, a fake

01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:58.610
What is this called, free press or some bullshit?

01:04:59.391 --> 01:05:09.107
And the University of Austin, which is also just as fraudulent as Donald Trump's university, probably, in the sense of it's like a bunch of

01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:16.410
pseudo-intellectuals who don't really know what it means to teach or be an academic or anything like that.

01:05:17.091 --> 01:05:19.713
They're probably just using AI to write their courseware.

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:23.976
This is just a awful joke on America.

01:05:23.996 --> 01:05:32.542
It's also an awful joke on Barry Weiss because these people will say that it's an honor to talk to her and that's just part of the enchantment.

01:05:32.582 --> 01:05:35.864
And she is such, such a played puppet here.

01:05:35.904 --> 01:05:37.766
It's kind of pathetic, but anyway.

01:05:39.005 --> 01:05:39.425
Here we go.

01:05:39.525 --> 01:05:40.246
New York City.

01:05:40.786 --> 01:05:44.368
Haviv Retagor, what time is it there in Jerusalem?

01:05:44.888 --> 01:05:45.348
345 in the morning.

01:05:46.389 --> 01:05:46.949
345 in the morning.

01:05:47.229 --> 01:05:49.111
And Mike Duran, where are you calling in from?

01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:49.751
Where in Turkey?

01:05:51.172 --> 01:05:51.532
Izmir.

01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:55.174
And it's presumably 8.45 in Erzmir as well.

01:05:55.274 --> 01:05:57.496
So somehow Mike Duran is- 3.45, yeah.

01:05:57.756 --> 01:06:00.039
Yeah, well, Mike Duran apparently sleeps in a suit and tie.

01:06:00.759 --> 01:06:02.241
Haviv is more normal.

01:06:02.922 --> 01:06:10.409
But I am very, very, very grateful for all of you guys, for the two of you joining us in what is the middle of the night for this

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:12.410
absolutely historic event.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:19.752
So about 45 minutes ago, the president of the United States, Donald Trump, posted this on Truth Social.

01:06:20.272 --> 01:06:24.833
We have completed our very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran.

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:37.595
So she's just going to read what Trump says on Truth Social and on X, again, making the enchantment known that social media is where messaging is done.

01:06:37.695 --> 01:06:39.716
Social media is where the truth is given.

01:06:41.214 --> 01:06:44.517
This enchantment must be broken, but it won't be broken by these people.

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:45.357
They're paid by them.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:50.881
And now again, remember this is thrilling.

01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:51.741
This is exciting.

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:53.463
This is a historic moment.

01:06:56.124 --> 01:07:02.669
We've dropped eight or ten 30,000 pound steel bombs on a mountain in Iran.

01:07:03.473 --> 01:07:05.735
including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.

01:07:06.195 --> 01:07:08.657
All planes are now outside of Iranian airspace.

01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:12.200
A full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.

01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:14.422
All planes are safely on their way home.

01:07:14.862 --> 01:07:17.084
Congratulations to our great American warriors.

01:07:17.124 --> 01:07:19.526
There's not another military in the world that would have done this.

01:07:19.886 --> 01:07:20.767
And this is all caps.

01:07:21.127 --> 01:07:22.208
Now is the time for peace.

01:07:22.348 --> 01:07:25.651
And then characteristic Trump, thank you for your attention to this matter.

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:29.694
So the US has entered the war and has bombed.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.395
Is this funny?

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:33.570
I guess it is.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:34.451
I mean, I guess.

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:36.291
I don't find it funny at all.

01:07:38.432 --> 01:07:40.873
Even if they're completely lying about it, I don't find it funny.

01:07:41.413 --> 01:07:48.876
The most important thing to understand here is that there's nothing to be learned from this podcast, okay?

01:07:49.856 --> 01:07:52.877
I could substitute another video in here over the audio

01:07:53.795 --> 01:07:58.598
And you would probably learn more from a different video laid over this audio.

01:07:58.678 --> 01:08:04.923
The combination of the two might make you realize something that just this video alone will never make you realize.

01:08:05.483 --> 01:08:14.929
Iran, certainly the most consequential decision that this American president has made in terms of foreign policy in this administration and probably in the second as well.

01:08:15.149 --> 01:08:20.733
And I know it's middle of the night for you both, but I would first love to begin with your reactions to this moment.

01:08:21.233 --> 01:08:23.075
And Mike, maybe let's start with you, because

01:08:23.915 --> 01:08:44.516
Went live with you the night the war began last Thursday It feels like a very very long time ago and you admitted to you admitted to her No, it was a few days later But the point is you admitted as someone who has followed this story more closely than just about anyone to being shocked by Israel So I want to start tonight by asking you are you shocked by Trump?

01:08:44.576 --> 01:08:46.158
Are you shocked by what just has gone down?

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:49.397
No, this time I didn't get fooled.

01:08:49.637 --> 01:08:51.998
I saw it coming and I said that I did.

01:08:52.618 --> 01:08:56.080
Because it really didn't make sense not to do this.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.222
Because the Israelis had made clear that they had to destroy Fordo.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:06.004
And you cannot destroy the Iranian nuclear program without destroying Fordo.

01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:14.388
That's the underground bunker where they have the... Now, I would go so far as to say that I wonder, they tell stories.

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:16.389
I want you to hear the story that they told

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:27.678
three days before this happened on the Wall Street Journal because I have a lot of doubts about the physics of a 30,000 pound steel bomb being able to go 200 feet through solid stone.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:32.442
I don't care how far you drop it from, that sounds fishy to me.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.584
It might be true, but it sounds fishy to me.

01:09:35.664 --> 01:09:38.427
Could it go 200 feet deep in topsoil?

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:43.791
Maybe, but in a granite mountain or in a mountain of any, you know,

01:09:44.215 --> 01:09:45.677
whatever kinds of rock there are.

01:09:46.458 --> 01:09:51.923
Now I'm thinking, I don't know, 200 feet's a long ways to go.

01:09:52.344 --> 01:10:03.016
Think about a bullet being stopped by gelatin and how thick 200 feet of gelatin would be when the biggest, hold on one second, I gotta answer this call.

01:10:36.781 --> 01:10:37.681
Okay, sorry about that.

01:10:38.161 --> 01:10:42.243
So my point is here, shoot, I really did have to answer that, though.

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:48.045
My point is here that you can't learn anything from this.

01:10:48.225 --> 01:10:58.208
This is a person who works under assumptions that are wrong, talking to two people who are there specifically to reinforce her wrong assumptions.

01:10:58.248 --> 01:11:03.310
And then he's gonna she's gonna bring on other people that are there to reinforce reinforce her wrong assumptions.

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:11.136
And so it'd be very much the same as if, I don't know, somebody like Jessica Rose was hosting a podcast and then said, we have two guests today.

01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:15.039
One is Robert Malone, and one of them is Peter McCullough.

01:11:15.399 --> 01:11:16.480
It would be just as dumb.

01:11:16.721 --> 01:11:18.842
You weren't going to get any information from that.

01:11:19.162 --> 01:11:21.104
You're not going to get any information from this.

01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:26.217
And these wrong assumptions, they go everywhere.

01:11:26.277 --> 01:11:30.699
This is a GBU-57, known as a massive ordnance penetrator.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:40.965
At 20 feet... Minus three days before they did this, the Wall Street Journal released this highly technical video designed to make sure you understood what a MOB was.

01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:52.137
feet long and weighing 30,000 pounds, it is the world's largest non-nuclear bomb and can destroy targets buried deep underground, earning it the name Bunkerbuster.

01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:55.879
To destroy Iran's heavily fortified nuclear facilities.

01:11:56.039 --> 01:12:03.485
So if you say that a virus is a gain-of-function virus because X, Y, and Z, because you added a furin cleavage site,

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:08.768
and it can now go around the world like the most contagious virus ever, it doesn't make it true.

01:12:08.888 --> 01:12:17.712
Just like if you call it a bunker buster bomb and you say in a cartoon that it can go 200 feet through reinforced concrete, it doesn't mean that's true.

01:12:20.694 --> 01:12:24.936
Experts say these are the conventional weapons with the best chance of success.

01:12:25.636 --> 01:12:26.557
This is a big sucker.

01:12:26.757 --> 01:12:30.459
It is called the massive ordnance penetrator, which basically sums up what it is.

01:12:31.107 --> 01:12:37.290
Here's why the MOP represents Israel's best chance at destroying Iran's facilities, and why it can't do it alone.

01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:42.492
The MOP is the largest bunker-buster bomb in the US arsenal.

01:12:42.932 --> 01:12:48.935
It's designed to penetrate hardened targets and plow through almost 200 feet of rock before detonating.

01:12:49.315 --> 01:12:54.357
Due to the MOP's weight, it can only be carried by the biggest bombers, such as B-2s.

01:12:55.798 --> 01:12:56.879
One bomb is unlikely.

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:17.491
In a sense, you're trying to create an earthquake.

01:13:18.512 --> 01:13:28.681
You're trying to crack the mountain and to channel that seismic energy down to make whatever is under there, whatever facility is under there, shake around a lot.

01:13:29.222 --> 01:13:34.727
The MOP is equipped with advanced guidance systems, including GPS, to allow for accurate targeting.

01:13:35.267 --> 01:13:41.193
It is also fitted with a delayed fuse, which allows the bomb to explode after it has penetrated its target.

01:13:41.707 --> 01:13:44.649
going to wait until it gets down in there before it blows up.

01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:53.593
Because if you want to maximize the energy, every foot counts in order to get it deeper to burrow down and have the effect.

01:13:54.193 --> 01:13:59.656
Since it launched its campaign against Iran's nuclear program, Israel has damaged critical nuclear infrastructure.

01:13:59.776 --> 01:14:02.378
I think they can steer by those four fins in the back.

01:14:02.418 --> 01:14:06.500
They steer kind of the way that Musk's rockets steer.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:08.180
and killed scientists.

01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:13.882
Iran has denied trying to build nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is peaceful.

01:14:14.282 --> 01:14:22.205
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran already has enough highly enriched uranium to make around 10 nuclear weapons.

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:29.447
Satellite images have shown damage at nuclear facilities, including Iran's largest enrichment facility, Natanz.

01:14:30.108 --> 01:14:37.590
But one key location remains unscathed, the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, where Iran produces highly enriched uranium.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:43.512
It's hidden in the mountains and is believed to be buried up to 295 feet below ground.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:47.974
It's harder to hit, deliberately so, because the Iranians buried it under a mountain.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:48.935
Look, the U.S.

01:14:48.995 --> 01:14:51.077
put NORAD under Cheyenne Mountain.

01:14:51.257 --> 01:14:53.940
It's way down under a lot of granite and a lot of rock.

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:58.044
And you want to raise the threshold for adversaries to hit something.

01:14:58.084 --> 01:14:59.846
Sometimes it's just really useful to bury it.

01:15:00.567 --> 01:15:07.013
While Israel has bunker busters, none of the ones in its arsenal are powerful enough to penetrate deep enough to hit Fordow.

01:15:07.802 --> 01:15:11.484
This is why the Israelis probably need U.S.

01:15:11.524 --> 01:15:11.984
assistance.

01:15:12.404 --> 01:15:24.069
The Israelis have a lot of bombs, but they need things that can kind of crack the mountain and create a wedge to create the tremors and to create the vibrations that will be helpful to destroy the facility.

01:15:25.205 --> 01:15:29.771
In addition to lacking the weapons to destroy Fordow, Israel also lacks the heavy bombers.

01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:33.135
Its ally, the U.S., has both.

01:15:33.535 --> 01:15:37.480
Fundamentally, there's a choice here to be made about whether it is in U.S.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.647
national interest to take out Fordow, to take out the Iranian nuclear program once and for all.

01:15:48.996 --> 01:15:54.938
So I'm going to take out the Iranian war program once and for all with these big bombs that go like 200 feet into the ground.

01:15:54.978 --> 01:15:55.978
But I don't really know.

01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:58.959
I don't really know that that's possible.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:01.480
Let me see.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.660
Did I put that in here?

01:16:05.321 --> 01:16:07.482
I just want to go quick to YouTube.

01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:08.362
I still have time.

01:16:08.642 --> 01:16:14.584
So I want to show you this one more video that I think I can find on my

01:16:17.279 --> 01:16:35.598
in my history because i just started watching it no is that the wrong ah shoot um let me see gotcha

01:16:36.735 --> 01:16:37.775
Four days ago, here we go.

01:16:37.795 --> 01:16:42.836
The Bunker Busters are gonna have a very low rate of success, no question about it.

01:16:43.236 --> 01:16:57.359
This is a simulation of what's claimed to be the Bunker Buster bomb, the GBU-57, which is alleged to be able to go up to 200 feet into the ground, even through reinforced concrete, before it will then explode.

01:16:57.379 --> 01:17:05.120
What you're seeing is a simulation of what's claimed is that because of the surface of the missile itself, it will be able to burrow

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:12.223
deep down inside there and then get into like it's, you know, showing here some kind of underground facility and then will explode.

01:17:12.303 --> 01:17:13.204
That's the claim.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:14.644
Now, tell us the reality.

01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:23.708
Well, if why don't we go to my slides for the moment and go to start with slide 1616, Gary.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.751
Thank you, Jen.

01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:32.192
This is a photograph of one of these bunker busters.

01:17:32.212 --> 01:17:32.932
They weigh about 30 pounds.

01:17:34.987 --> 01:17:38.111
most of their weight is steel.

01:17:39.994 --> 01:17:47.564
In fact, I think it's about 5,000 or 6,000 pounds of explosives in this 30,000 pound munition.

01:17:47.684 --> 01:17:52.431
And you need a lot of steel because you want it to have a lot of weight.

01:17:53.371 --> 01:18:06.679
And you also need to protect the explosives inside it so that they don't get predetonated before the munition penetrates deep enough into the ground.

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.021
If we go to slide 18, we'll see a diagram

01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:19.732
of how this munition is allegedly supposed to work.

01:18:20.032 --> 01:18:21.113
I say allegedly.

01:18:21.133 --> 01:18:40.538
This is another example of contractors making claims that, or people who are working for contractors or people who do not understand the details who are advising higher level

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.025
political decision makers.

01:18:43.045 --> 01:18:45.346
This is a real problem I've talked about in the past.

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:55.571
You have people who don't know what they're talking about, bringing the information up to people who are political decision makers, who may or may not care about the details.

01:18:56.411 --> 01:19:00.553
And the result is you get a big disconnect in what they think they're capable of doing.

01:19:00.713 --> 01:19:05.436
I think it's a mistake to say it that way, to assume that these people don't know what they're talking about.

01:19:05.476 --> 01:19:07.977
They know exactly what they're talking about is bullshit.

01:19:09.053 --> 01:19:12.034
They know exactly that what they're talking about is bullshit.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.875
It's not like they're just dumb.

01:19:14.395 --> 01:19:16.235
It's not like they're just reading a script.

01:19:16.275 --> 01:19:20.057
They know that the script is bullshit because they've never learned beyond it.

01:19:20.737 --> 01:19:21.737
They're not required to.

01:19:21.777 --> 01:19:23.138
They're encouraged not to.

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:29.980
To what is actually the case, and it may be that Trump

01:19:31.259 --> 01:19:31.900
the 3 p.m.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.003
we're going to see some of these munitions dropped on Iran.

01:19:35.063 --> 01:19:36.063
I don't know if that's true.

01:19:36.103 --> 01:19:36.884
I'm just guessing.

01:19:37.224 --> 01:19:38.145
It's a wild guess.

01:19:38.586 --> 01:19:41.128
Yeah, that's kind of the implication from what I was told.

01:19:41.148 --> 01:19:43.250
This might be our entry into this war.

01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:44.831
That's what really worries me.

01:19:45.532 --> 01:19:46.512
And you know what it's funny?

01:19:47.353 --> 01:20:02.606
that we have seen Trump in the last 24 hours dismiss the concerns that what Iran might do to us, because he says, no, we're protected, which implies to me just what you just said, that someone's telling him, oh yeah, we got all kinds of good air defense.

01:20:02.626 --> 01:20:05.969
And by the way, these bunker busters definitely can go 200 feet.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:12.535
But one other thing from this diagram you're talking about here, this also implies that Iran built these bunkers

01:20:13.215 --> 01:20:15.116
that they didn't do any creativity, i.e.

01:20:15.196 --> 01:20:23.841
it's just straight down, so it's a not... One million views already after four days, this MIT professor saying that this is a myth.

01:20:23.901 --> 01:20:25.422
You see what I'm talking about here?

01:20:26.402 --> 01:20:27.943
We are being set up.

01:20:29.264 --> 01:20:31.385
The Trump administration is a theater.

01:20:31.845 --> 01:20:33.186
RFK is a theater.

01:20:33.266 --> 01:20:35.107
This whole shit is a theater.

01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:38.674
We are exactly on script right now.

01:20:38.774 --> 01:20:40.495
None of this is out of control.

01:20:40.615 --> 01:20:42.356
None of this is not understood.

01:20:42.716 --> 01:20:44.417
Nobody's making any guesses here.

01:20:44.457 --> 01:20:46.038
They're reading the script they're given.

01:20:48.319 --> 01:20:55.163
Now, I don't know about these two guys in particular, but I assure you the general gist of this is a theater.

01:20:55.223 --> 01:21:00.045
That's the reason why we have a former Fox News host at the Department of Defense.

01:21:01.386 --> 01:21:02.707
It's a joke on our grandkids.

01:21:05.169 --> 01:21:32.046
little shaft that you can drop it into as opposed to being offset or maybe multiple angles before where it is we don't even know for sure under the ground where this thing may end up being so correct me if i'm wrong but you're kind of shooting blind anyway you've preempted me and that's good sorry you and no you and gary do it all the time it's great uh uh in this diagram what you see is a depiction of a of a penetrating warhead that goes uh

01:21:33.441 --> 01:21:57.547
I mean how different is this than the then the multi-layered multi-story caves that Al-Qaeda was supposed to have in the mountains of Afghanistan that had like tanks and missiles inside of them and Internet and a bar and sometimes they even had a full-court basketball hoop that was on the floor right below the hangar Like come on Don't you remember that they went on frickin?

01:21:58.927 --> 01:22:01.608
free the meet the press

01:22:03.257 --> 01:22:08.840
and showed diagrams of the bunkers and the caves that Al-Qaeda had built.

01:22:13.223 --> 01:22:14.204
This is no different.

01:22:15.404 --> 01:22:28.152
No different than showing a elaborate computer-generated model of virus infection and of transfection of antigen-presenting cells and the production of antibodies and they're blocking the spike protein.

01:22:28.592 --> 01:22:31.154
I mean, this is all the same level of bullshit.

01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:34.046
This one just has even less animation.

01:22:36.847 --> 01:22:42.871
Into the ground around 60 meters and, uh, and then detonates at its maximum depth.

01:22:43.231 --> 01:22:51.135
I mean, we're not even talking about having an, a two meter sized exhaust port directly above the tunnel that you want to bomb.

01:22:52.455 --> 01:22:57.158
You know, like in a death star situation where you'd be like, you know, bulls eyeing wamp rats.

01:22:58.413 --> 01:23:11.477
In this case, they just have best guesses about based on where the roads are or the tunnels are, or their best guess of where these things went, or maybe I guess they might've sent somebody with a seismograph over there or a ground lidar at some point.

01:23:11.517 --> 01:23:24.422
I mean, what in the world are we believing here other than we can hit three places relatively close to each other with one of these, three of these bombs, and then three of them over here close to each other,

01:23:25.302 --> 01:23:29.144
implying some kind of directed accuracy, and that's about it.

01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:37.868
Our best guess of where to bomb them, and hope that the shakeup is, hope we shake these places a lot, you know, where these centrifuges are, because they don't like shaking.

01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:52.735
Now, the detonation of the 6,000 pounds of explosives can create a cavity of probably around 10 or 15 meters in radius.

01:23:54.057 --> 01:23:58.081
So maybe 20 or 30 meters in diameter now.

01:23:59.462 --> 01:24:02.645
If there's a tunnel below it that's another 20 meters below it.

01:24:03.433 --> 01:24:06.475
it could probably punch through the top of the tunnel too.

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:16.602
But the tunnel's gotta be within 10 or 20 meters of the location of the explosion.

01:24:17.483 --> 01:24:25.708
In other words, what if a tunnel is offset by... So why are we doing this with meters when it's 200 feet in the diagram?

01:24:25.748 --> 01:24:28.050
Should we just help him with that here?

01:24:32.313 --> 01:24:34.555
It's 60, 61 meters.

01:24:35.876 --> 01:24:36.176
Okay.

01:24:36.236 --> 01:24:43.482
So it's got to go down and get within 10 meters of the tunnel before it's going to probably do any damage to it at all.

01:24:43.502 --> 01:24:46.285
And remember the rock has got to go somewhere.

01:24:46.365 --> 01:24:51.749
So the rock can only go down into the tunnel or it can go up and out the original hole.

01:24:54.371 --> 01:24:57.454
Provided how good, how deep it goes up to 200 feet.

01:24:57.534 --> 01:25:01.217
I mean, come on that up to 200 feet can also mean five feet deep.

01:25:05.859 --> 01:25:06.460
Oops, 30 meters.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:09.041
We don't know where that tunnel is.

01:25:09.282 --> 01:25:10.682
We have no idea where the tunnel is.

01:25:12.003 --> 01:25:32.596
And so unless there's a big cave under there where it might penetrate to or the tunnel or the big cave is very shallow, then you might actually have a situation where, you know, you could do quite a bit of damage.

01:25:33.425 --> 01:25:41.572
But, you know, there's not necessarily any reason to believe that the Iranians would design something this way.

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:45.236
So, I mean, look, this release simulation, really?

01:25:45.256 --> 01:25:48.619
Are we really going to fall for this shit?

01:25:50.135 --> 01:26:01.899
Now, just to, in the case of the Fordow nuclear facility, let's just take a quick look at slide 19.

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:04.280
I know Gary loves this stuff too.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:04.980
He does.

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:05.860
I do too.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.681
He does.

01:26:09.341 --> 01:26:13.663
Notice that this really feels more and more like controlled opposition.

01:26:13.723 --> 01:26:17.364
I mean, a million point four views, an MIT professor,

01:26:18.578 --> 01:26:28.656
you know, kind of curating a limited spectrum of debate about what's possible with ordinances, but then kind of explaining it in a kind of, I don't know, sort of way.

01:26:28.837 --> 01:26:29.458
I don't know.

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:30.460
I'm not feeling it.

01:26:33.181 --> 01:26:41.188
The structures that are underground are under... Oh, it's got big-time Tom Cruise vibes, though.

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:41.449
Big time.

01:26:41.489 --> 01:26:51.618
In other words, the surface of the ground is not flat and perfectly perpendicular to something that's coming on a perpendicular trajectory.

01:26:52.679 --> 01:26:53.640
That's relevant.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:59.703
You see what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen?

01:27:00.364 --> 01:27:02.405
What we're dealing with here is a real big deal.

01:27:03.946 --> 01:27:08.829
Because an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality was sculpted using murder and lies.

01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:14.793
And they are still running the clock out on this awful, murderous operation.

01:27:15.595 --> 01:27:27.722
that has almost completely been obfuscated by the Grace Shara trial, another thing that took too long to get nowhere, and then now those people are the ones we're supposed to listen to?

01:27:27.862 --> 01:27:31.724
A lawyer who lost his case, now we're supposed to listen to that jackass?

01:27:34.426 --> 01:27:41.850
A guy who didn't say anything about supplementary oxygen and the decades of research about it in critical care textbooks?

01:27:43.613 --> 01:27:47.235
animal research showing that pure oxygen ain't no good thing.

01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:48.396
It ain't medicine.

01:27:49.156 --> 01:27:51.137
It's a toxin, a drug.

01:27:52.478 --> 01:27:56.521
Ladies and gentlemen, it was a national security operation from day one.

01:27:56.561 --> 01:28:05.466
PCR has become accepted as a diagnostic standard, and that means that there are remnants that are there, that are the DNA, just like the NHS has said they're gonna do.

01:28:05.486 --> 01:28:10.689
The Scooby-Doo mystery about the virus, that was an enchantment, and we cannot pass that on to our children.

01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:19.333
We can't pass on a mythology about how we can sequence viruses in the background, that there's a test that can test for 17 different viruses.

01:28:19.793 --> 01:28:24.576
We cannot accept the fact that intramuscular injection is more or less okay.

01:28:25.076 --> 01:28:27.277
It just matters what you put in sorta, kinda.

01:28:28.758 --> 01:28:37.843
We can't accept this illusion that RNA has military potential and it's just out there in a bat cave waiting to be found.

01:28:39.139 --> 01:28:40.939
understand that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:28:40.999 --> 01:28:47.041
is a total distraction and everybody that he's put in place or allowed to be put in place is the actual problem.

01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:52.302
Many of these people don't even have an American passport and certainly it's not their only passport.

01:28:52.762 --> 01:28:55.163
Solving America's health problem is not on the agenda.

01:28:55.203 --> 01:29:01.084
Turning American citizens and their children into experimental animals is most certainly on the agenda.

01:29:02.062 --> 01:29:15.067
That's why Donald Trump was very happy to start spending money on developing an AI data center in Nevada and in Texas and wherever the hell else they're gonna build one outside of the new NSA headquarters, I don't know.

01:29:16.388 --> 01:29:21.714
And he was so focused on that, I guess he couldn't submit a budget after having four years to prepare one.

01:29:22.434 --> 01:29:23.816
Stop lying!

01:29:24.497 --> 01:29:25.818
It's a show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:25.858 --> 01:29:27.820
America is being controlled, demolished.

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:38.311
They timed their show perfectly with a known biological signal in the population pyramid, an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that they've seen coming since the 90s.

01:29:39.827 --> 01:29:48.333
and they've been putting people in place since the late 2010s to make sure that the narrative on the internet could be controlled in a military way.

01:29:49.554 --> 01:29:53.917
Those people are the performers that are best and most aptly described by this video.

01:29:54.798 --> 01:30:03.764
The anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was about to come into the station was going to be stopped and controlled by these people.

01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:05.526
And so they did it.

01:30:06.343 --> 01:30:15.025
They got together and wrote books about ivermectin and talked about the censorship and the free speech and the lockdowns are lame and signed the Barrington Declaration.

01:30:15.425 --> 01:30:19.686
Here's a door to freedom and we are here to rescue the Republic with rock music.

01:30:20.147 --> 01:30:31.890
All of these people, hundreds of them on the internet faking stopping something, faking fighting something, faking being censored for something, when in reality it was an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:32.930
The train was coming.

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:35.191
They all knew the train was coming.

01:30:35.231 --> 01:30:37.451
They all knew that the guy's brakes worked.

01:30:37.952 --> 01:30:40.413
And then they told you that it didn't, because it's a new one.

01:30:40.433 --> 01:30:42.433
We've never seen this train before.

01:30:42.453 --> 01:30:43.454
The train has no brakes.

01:30:43.494 --> 01:30:44.694
You need to help us stop it.

01:30:45.094 --> 01:30:49.296
And they performed this over and over again for five years, and they're still doing it now.

01:30:51.277 --> 01:30:55.018
And you can probably think of the Israeli thing like that.

01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:56.659
You can think of Ukraine like that.

01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:58.119
You can think of Libya like that.

01:30:58.159 --> 01:30:59.560
You can think of Iraq like that.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.921
You can think of a lot of this stuff just like this.

01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:04.861
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:31:04.921 --> 01:31:07.382
Intramuscular injection is not medicine.

01:31:07.982 --> 01:31:11.824
Transfecting healthy people is a crime and population pyramids is a problem.

01:31:12.324 --> 01:31:13.264
They have been managing.

01:31:13.424 --> 01:31:15.405
Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:15.805 --> 01:31:19.147
We're about to take on Bad Biology 101 in a pretty good way.

01:31:19.187 --> 01:31:20.328
I'm really excited about it.

01:31:20.888 --> 01:31:28.273
I threw my back out yesterday on the frickin' basketball court, though, so I'm... I'm... I'm... That sounds slow to me.

01:31:33.714 --> 01:31:50.424
It went out a little bit so it's not terrible like I can stand up right now I can sit down on the big stool right now But I can feel it in my spine and so I got to take it easy for the next probably week To make sure I get all the way back to 100% normal It's gonna set me back just a little bit but not that much

01:31:50.984 --> 01:31:51.965
because I'm so close.

01:31:52.185 --> 01:31:53.326
I'm really, really excited.

01:31:53.766 --> 01:31:55.708
Don't talk to me about old age, baby.

01:31:56.108 --> 01:31:57.690
There's no age limit for dunking.

01:31:57.710 --> 01:32:05.817
You can call them peasants or poor people or... Maha is a joke on America, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:05.857 --> 01:32:06.557
Don't forget it.

01:32:07.518 --> 01:32:12.082
This has been GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:32:12.102 --> 01:32:12.803
See you tomorrow morning.
