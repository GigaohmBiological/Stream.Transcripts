I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

02:00.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

02:30.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:00.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:30.000 --> 03:48.620
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:48.620 --> 03:56.520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

03:56.520 --> 04:00.600
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.120
And I have lied.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.200
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.920
I don't want to lie, you know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.000
I try not to be a liar.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.920
I don't want to be a liar.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.240
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.160
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.320
His name is J. J. Cooey.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.600
And I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

04:36.200 --> 04:43.240
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

04:56.520 --> 05:18.200
I would say if that dark horse interview is real, then we should see a very incredulous

05:18.200 --> 05:24.160
Brett Weinstein trying his best to defend the vaccine schedule from scrutiny.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.640
If not, I wouldn't believe it.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.520
I don't know what to tell you other than that.

05:29.520 --> 05:36.000
I haven't watched it because I am completely done with Brett Weinstein, but it's possible

05:36.000 --> 05:44.440
that that forest is a good guy and that Brett is, you know, sort of slowly leaking the truth.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.840
As I've said before, we could have been here in 2020, but we're not.

05:47.840 --> 05:53.600
We were here here in 2024 because we've been under an enchantment.

05:53.600 --> 05:59.040
There's no way to slow roll an entire globe of people to the truth without a coordinated

05:59.040 --> 06:03.680
theater, without a coordinated group of liars.

06:03.680 --> 06:08.000
Because we've had Galileo's around, we've had people who knew the truth from the beginning

06:08.000 --> 06:17.760
and they were silenced and they were replaced by an illusion of consensus.

06:17.760 --> 06:25.760
So your consciousness as prime real estate is exactly what Brett Weinstein represents.

06:25.760 --> 06:30.240
And the fact of the matter is that people like this guy have known for decades that

06:30.240 --> 06:36.000
the way to control people is to control both sides of a debate, to occupy both sides of

06:36.000 --> 06:42.880
an argument, to be the home team and the away team.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.160
And once you're the home team and the away team, then essentially you can win any argument

06:47.160 --> 06:50.640
by attributing bad motives to the away team.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.080
You see how that works?

06:53.080 --> 06:59.040
And all this truth has been available to us for decades already.

06:59.040 --> 07:04.040
Once we break through this, the main illusion, which is the illusion of fractional reserve

07:04.040 --> 07:10.320
banking and that somehow just through the meritocracy of hard work, these bankers have

07:10.320 --> 07:12.920
become ultra rich.

07:13.920 --> 07:19.920
Right, that's what we're here and here.

07:19.920 --> 07:31.680
So as we've got to get as many people to see as possible, we've got to show as many people

07:31.680 --> 07:36.920
as possible so that as many people who can see will see.

07:36.920 --> 07:47.280
There is a plan, there is definitely a plan, it's not a good plan, I don't think it's

07:47.280 --> 07:52.680
a good plan at all, don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a good plan, it's not,

07:52.680 --> 08:01.040
it's not a good plan, but they have a plan, right, I'm not, they have a plan.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.840
And we've got to take the power back from these charlatans if we want to stop the plan,

08:04.840 --> 08:08.120
we've got to take actually, we've got to take the power back, we've got to take our

08:08.120 --> 08:16.400
kids back, our kids minds back from these people and try again to make gentle the life

08:16.400 --> 08:28.280
of this world, make, make peace again, pursue peace again.

08:28.280 --> 08:33.480
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you might be here at the top of

08:33.480 --> 08:39.600
the wave, helping your friends and family, helping your kids understand what just happened

08:39.600 --> 08:46.840
and how to navigate it should it happen the next time, that's really what giga ohm biological

08:46.840 --> 08:53.920
intends to do and help other people and organizations who are trying to do the same, dispel the

08:53.920 --> 09:02.320
immunomethology that has been hoisted upon us over the last few decades, and we're going

09:02.320 --> 09:07.600
to do that by staying focused on the biology, by not taking debate on TV and social media

09:07.600 --> 09:11.400
and loving our neighbors.

09:11.400 --> 09:16.680
We are seeking out the sacred in our biology again, ladies and gentlemen, and so doing,

09:16.680 --> 09:22.920
we need the help of other people, and we are of course doing it because of other people

09:22.920 --> 09:27.760
that we love, we care about, and so please share this stream with as many people as you

09:27.760 --> 09:37.520
can, we are trying to make the message happier and more hopeful every day, clearer and more

09:37.520 --> 09:42.880
understandable every day, and it takes a lot of repetition, it's kind of like a really

09:42.880 --> 09:51.440
good jazz performance, requires 500 rehearsals or so, we're on our, let's say, 600th show,

09:51.440 --> 09:54.360
I don't know what it is, I would have to actually count it up.

09:54.360 --> 10:00.560
We've been rehearsing for a while or practicing or it's not even, it's not the right word,

10:00.560 --> 10:10.360
we've been studying for a while, and so although our understanding has shifted, and in recent

10:10.360 --> 10:16.680
times it's shifted quite drastically for me, no pun intended, because I brought my hand

10:16.680 --> 10:21.400
down from my eyes, I brought my phone down from my eyes, I realized that so many of the

10:21.400 --> 10:27.720
people that were telling me stories were not friendly, I didn't even know some of their names.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.920
Ladies and gentlemen, the only way out of this trap is United of Noncompliance, the only way

10:34.920 --> 10:40.200
out of this trap is to learn the biology ourselves and teach it to our children, I am a human just

10:40.200 --> 10:48.360
like you, a multiracial American who was brainwashed when he was young to try and define himself as a

10:48.360 --> 10:56.120
hyphenated, something American, and multiculturalism was a word that they used in college when I

10:56.120 --> 11:01.720
was in college, and I fell victim to the same trap that a lot of the next generation also fell

11:01.720 --> 11:07.640
victim to, which is that here you can have four years of what essentially is free college for now,

11:07.640 --> 11:13.240
and on 8% interest when you become an adult when we kick you out of here, and there's no guarantee

11:13.240 --> 11:18.600
of any income, there's no guarantee of any whatever, it's just basically a glorified library

11:18.600 --> 11:26.200
card with some glorified lecturers, people that definitely didn't know as much as we thought they

11:26.200 --> 11:32.920
did, and now lots of Americans are in debt to that system and we're not supposed to blame the

11:32.920 --> 11:37.000
government for giving away the free money called Pell Grants, we're not supposed to give away

11:37.000 --> 11:42.840
or blame the government for subsidizing those loans to 18 year olds that were told for their

11:42.840 --> 11:49.480
whole life that college was the only way, and we're not supposed to blame the universities that

11:49.480 --> 11:54.280
realize that holy shit we can charge whatever we want if they're gonna give us half Pell Grants

11:54.280 --> 12:02.200
and half guaranteed student loans, well then heck I guess $15,000 a year isn't crazy after all,

12:02.840 --> 12:08.360
and now we have universities that charge in the upwards of 60 or $70,000 a year, I don't know what

12:08.360 --> 12:16.120
Carnegie Mellon costs when I was still working there, but holy cow, and this is all government

12:16.120 --> 12:21.640
subsidized, weaponized piles of money because universities are weaponized piles of money,

12:21.640 --> 12:27.160
they're gigantic endowments, they're gigantic piles of grant money that are collected by the

12:27.160 --> 12:32.040
people that work there, and so this is the, I think that's the music that got me bounced last time,

12:32.040 --> 12:37.160
so I'm gonna draft that down and hopefully I'm trying to figure out why they they blanked my

12:37.160 --> 12:42.680
stream the other day, I think they blanked the intro because of the Tucker clip, so we're

12:42.680 --> 12:50.280
gonna see what they blanked today, it's May 3rd, 2024, welcome to the show, right on time 10-20,

12:50.280 --> 13:06.200
this is Giga on biological

13:07.000 --> 13:22.840
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show, coming to you live from Pittsburgh,

13:22.840 --> 13:27.480
Pennsylvania, it's 20 after 10, I still don't have my timing right of course, but at least I hit

13:27.480 --> 13:33.160
the button before 10-10, now if I can get around 10 o'clock then this whole thing will be perfect

13:33.160 --> 13:39.160
and I'll get to this part at 10-10, like I intended to, so that your watch will look its best when

13:39.160 --> 13:44.520
the screen, when we start the show, thanks for joining me, this is the only place really

13:45.480 --> 13:50.920
on the internet where you can find somebody who is in earnest seeking the sacred biology again,

13:51.720 --> 13:55.560
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

13:55.560 --> 14:01.560
immune system is dumb, exploring that concept and trying to understand it is a great way to get

14:01.560 --> 14:06.680
to the finish line as fast as possible, but it's a great deal of work, so if you need help and you

14:06.680 --> 14:11.080
want to come back for it, this is the place, um, transfection in healthy humans is criminally

14:11.080 --> 14:18.360
negligent, it's kind of a subset idea of the first one, but it's a more succinct way of telling any

14:18.360 --> 14:25.800
of your friends that are doctors or academic biologists or vet techs or veterinarians or anybody that

14:25.880 --> 14:32.520
purports to know something about biology and also something about COVID, they should have known better

14:32.520 --> 14:36.920
and should have known what transfection was before the pandemic and should have known that in calling

14:36.920 --> 14:43.000
it investigational vaccine doesn't make it any better, certainly doesn't make it appropriate

14:43.000 --> 14:48.120
for healthy elderly people that we would like to live and have around for another 15 years

14:48.120 --> 14:52.920
and it certainly doesn't make it appropriate for young children, never mind pregnant women,

14:53.720 --> 15:01.240
and finally RNA cannot pandemic is a great way to challenge your academic biologist friends,

15:01.240 --> 15:05.560
you know the people you used to work with in neuroscience for example in Norway and in the

15:05.560 --> 15:12.280
Netherlands and all over the world, hi my name is Jonathan Cooey and you can find me on PubMed,

15:12.280 --> 15:20.040
please look me up and then email any of my co-authors, any of them that you find and send them my stream

15:20.040 --> 15:22.520
and maybe even send them to this clip right here.

15:26.440 --> 15:31.800
Hey guys, it's been a long time since I've seen you when I was a patch clamp physiologist

15:32.840 --> 15:38.840
going to seminars with you, I guess you experienced the pandemic like I did which is pretty crazy,

15:38.840 --> 15:46.280
right? Four years ago we were told a biological mythology, a story basically about an RNA molecule

15:46.280 --> 15:50.840
that started out in a mud puddle and is now everywhere including in zoo animals and most of

15:50.840 --> 16:00.200
the whitetail deer in North America. This story is essentially a lie and it is based on some facts

16:00.200 --> 16:07.400
and a lot of fiction and you as an academic neurobiologist may not have been in a position to

16:08.120 --> 16:13.880
let's say drop everything and start reading and you may not have been aware that your former colleague

16:13.960 --> 16:19.880
Jonathan Cooey was actually let go by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 2020 because

16:19.880 --> 16:25.880
I spoke out against transfection as an investigational vaccine and told people we were nuts for not

16:25.880 --> 16:34.040
speaking out against it and I think you as an academic neurobiologist working in a Nobel Prize

16:34.040 --> 16:40.920
lab in Norway are working in a prestigious university like Erasmus in the Netherlands or

16:40.920 --> 16:45.000
working at the University of Pittsburgh now or wherever you find yourself

16:47.320 --> 16:51.560
should have known the definition of transfection because you've probably used it in your mice,

16:51.560 --> 16:57.640
you've probably used it in your rats in order to express the channel red opsin or or express the

16:59.240 --> 17:06.200
the marker for your for your interesting gene. Maybe you looked at early immediate

17:06.760 --> 17:10.440
early genes like like ark and you had a mouse that could

17:11.880 --> 17:19.800
transiently express GFP wherever ark was expressed and so you understand what's going on when they

17:19.800 --> 17:24.600
say that they're going to use a lipid nanoparticle with RNA and it injected into a muscle

17:25.800 --> 17:31.560
and you understand how imprecise that must be given the fact that you know how imprecise

17:31.640 --> 17:33.160
injection in the brain can be

17:38.920 --> 17:43.480
and given how you know how lipid nanoparticles work or maybe you don't but you could have

17:43.480 --> 17:49.000
figured it out. Transfection in healthy humans was actually criminally negligent and they lied to

17:49.000 --> 17:53.480
us about how the pandemic started in New York City which you can find very easy

17:53.880 --> 18:01.800
and convinced people around the world with a self-contained media campaign that we were

18:01.800 --> 18:09.080
forced to watch because we had to stay at home and unfortunately a combination of very bad

18:09.080 --> 18:16.760
recommendations which included pure high flow oxygen given to people before they eventually

18:16.840 --> 18:26.200
got on a ventilator and many other sort of illusions to create a mass casualty event in

18:26.200 --> 18:31.000
New York City that they then said was evidence that if we didn't all lock down there was going to

18:31.000 --> 18:36.120
be a worst case scenario so we all locked down and then they told us that the worst case scenario

18:36.120 --> 18:43.800
was avoided because we all locked out and most of you should have been smart enough in 2020 to

18:43.880 --> 18:48.440
know that this was a lie most of you should have been smart enough to know that this wasn't possible

18:48.440 --> 18:51.160
and I myself what the hell happened to my focus

18:55.720 --> 19:01.880
the most of you should have known that this was the case most of you should have known that

19:01.880 --> 19:06.200
this was not all possible but it took me a very long time to figure it out

19:09.000 --> 19:13.080
and so I don't blame any of you for not knowing it I'm just trying to explain to you that you

19:13.080 --> 19:18.600
could have known and you can know now because a lot of the work has already been done for you

19:18.600 --> 19:23.640
a lot of the work has already been done over the last four years by me and by a few other

19:23.640 --> 19:30.440
people have been trying to parse out what exactly happened you can forgive yourself for it not

19:30.440 --> 19:35.080
coming to light in your life because of the focus you have on your career you can forgive

19:35.080 --> 19:38.920
yourself for your focus on your family and you can forgive yourself for not having done the

19:38.920 --> 19:41.160
requisite reading to understand it because it was a lot

19:43.480 --> 19:47.800
I've bought a lot of books and I've read a lot of papers I've printed out a lot of papers I've

19:47.800 --> 19:53.800
highlighted a lot of papers over the last four years but I assure you that the words on this

19:53.800 --> 20:03.960
screen are actually real and so you as a biologist maybe you know me from from great conversations

20:03.960 --> 20:10.840
on the roof of a convention center at an SFN maybe you know me from great conversations at a

20:10.840 --> 20:15.960
had a meeting in Italy or in Sardinia or any of the other places maybe even in Swalbard if you got

20:15.960 --> 20:23.320
if we were lucky enough to meet there and I would hope that in all of those places I never made an

20:23.320 --> 20:29.160
impression that I was some kind of crazy person or that I didn't really understand the subtleties

20:29.160 --> 20:35.640
of what we were trying to do as neuroscientists I am willing to wager that I made a pretty good

20:35.640 --> 20:41.560
impression on you in terms of my understanding of the big questions and my interest in yours

20:44.280 --> 20:50.760
and in that respect if you can possibly remember it please understand that it is not with with

20:50.760 --> 21:01.000
it is not willy nilly that I put these words on the screen and that I I'm hanging my family's

21:03.320 --> 21:11.160
future on the words on this screen and so to all the people in Norway in the Netherlands and in

21:11.160 --> 21:15.480
the United States and everywhere else where you have gone since we have been friends since we have

21:15.480 --> 21:23.720
met over my lifetime and 20 years as a neurobiologist I'm begging all of you just think deeply about

21:23.720 --> 21:30.040
these words think deeply about what you know about the mechanisms by which DNA is replicated

21:30.040 --> 21:36.360
RNA is replicated and then find the papers that fill in the holes of what you don't understand and

21:36.360 --> 21:42.760
realize that according to their cartoons and the infectious cycle works in a way that doesn't make

21:42.760 --> 21:50.040
sense according to their cartoons the way that these entities work they're not organisms

21:50.840 --> 21:57.880
they're not species they're not patterned integrity they don't consume energy they don't engage in

21:57.880 --> 22:02.440
homeostasis and so how in the world could an RNA pandemic

22:02.440 --> 22:12.680
a transfection to to usefully augment the immune system is not the same as a

22:12.680 --> 22:19.160
transfection to put a channel adoption into a particular set of neurons in the brain and then

22:19.160 --> 22:31.240
to sacrifice the animal five weeks later I guess that's my plea to neurobiology around the world

22:31.240 --> 22:36.680
to people that that worked in the fields that I have patch clamp physiologists people that work on

22:36.680 --> 22:41.560
transgenic mice people that transfect mice on a regular basis to express channel adopts in

22:41.560 --> 22:50.360
somewhere or to express some kind of pre-dependent protein expression so you can modify a it you

22:50.360 --> 22:58.200
all use the tool and you all know it's an acute modification of that animal's physiology to ask

22:58.200 --> 23:03.080
a question that also requires you essentially to sacrifice the animal because it's not going to

23:03.080 --> 23:14.040
live a long healthy life after you do that anyway I don't know how to give introductions

23:14.040 --> 23:18.520
anymore so I that when just came to me I don't know why I decided to give an introduction for the

23:18.520 --> 23:23.640
neurobiology people out there but I was colleagues with lots of people I met lots of people they all

23:23.720 --> 23:31.080
know my name they all could send me an email and ask me how I'm doing but they don't because they're

23:31.080 --> 23:35.880
all very busy in their own careers right they're all climbing that all their own local ladder

23:37.320 --> 23:42.200
if I was still that's the mistake they made what they should have done was giving me a

23:42.200 --> 23:47.800
tenure position at Pitt and grant money to work on rats and I would have been you know riding my

23:47.800 --> 23:53.240
bike and still I'm so excited I get to do experiments today again I got a new microscope to build

23:53.240 --> 24:02.360
again but instead they told me to go home and put me into the hands of a bunch of retards like

24:02.360 --> 24:08.040
oh sorry for that word a bunch of monkeys like drastic who for a while had me going

24:09.720 --> 24:15.000
or put me into the arms of people like who did I stream with for March and April of 2020

24:15.320 --> 24:26.280
uh Kevin McCairn um Adi ads and Paul Catrell like every weekend for five or six weeks in a row

24:27.240 --> 24:32.920
in retrospect that is just an absolute clown show but I did pretty well on those streams but my

24:32.920 --> 24:39.800
goodness what a what a wonderful wonderful team worst case scenario was assembled around the world

24:39.800 --> 24:46.040
to execute this this operation it was really it's really incredible um this was a national

24:46.040 --> 24:51.880
security operation I don't know if it would qualify as a global security operation but it's a global

24:51.880 --> 24:58.680
group of weaponized piles of money and even governments could be thought of as weaponized piles of

24:58.680 --> 25:03.880
money especially governments that can print their own um and so if you think about these

25:03.880 --> 25:08.200
weaponized piles of money trying to undermine national sovereignty and trying to undermine

25:09.800 --> 25:15.080
western republics let's not call them democracies let's call them what we want them to be which is

25:15.080 --> 25:23.000
republics um with a with an operation which convinced everyone in the world that a pandemic

25:23.000 --> 25:28.200
occurred or attempted to convince everyone in the world that a pandemic occurred and we've heard

25:28.200 --> 25:35.400
them lament on screen um people like Mark von Rancz or people like uh Bill Gates or Tony Fauci

25:35.880 --> 25:41.480
or or or Rick Bright we've heard them all lament that people never take it seriously enough

25:41.480 --> 25:47.640
you know flu isn't sexy enough anymore and so uh this plan has been in the works for a long time

25:47.640 --> 25:52.840
I think the sparse pandemic document we worked on that the last couple days in and out um and

25:52.840 --> 25:58.360
it's got a couple really good examples um which are just the tip of the iceberg for how this was

25:58.360 --> 26:03.640
done but essentially they've controlled all the voices that you've ever seen and that's why you

26:03.640 --> 26:10.840
are very rare you're one of the 3100 people or so that actually know that I exist um and the rest

26:10.840 --> 26:18.920
of the world has no idea because the vast majority of the the way that information moves around our

26:18.920 --> 26:26.200
world is just programmed a certain way it's not AI magic it's not a bunch of oh well I guess this

26:26.200 --> 26:32.840
is the way it works no they can just turn switches and flip switches that are assigned to your accounts

26:32.840 --> 26:38.120
and then your accounts don't go and they can actually make other accounts seem to go

26:40.360 --> 26:46.440
and so it's all a great big illusion of course but we're still actively trying to engage in twitter

26:46.440 --> 26:52.120
and facebook sharing and all this other stuff and this is all part of their their illusion

26:52.840 --> 26:57.320
and they knew that from the very beginning of course they've gained this at a table and so

26:57.320 --> 27:02.520
they've had people in place so that we would ask the wrong questions and we would never figure it

27:02.520 --> 27:07.320
out that there was actually probably just a hot background and so that they rolled out a pretty

27:07.320 --> 27:12.680
non-specific PCR test and told you that this was evidence of a novel spread pretty much no one

27:12.680 --> 27:18.200
would be able to see through it especially if you had enough people in all the right places

27:18.200 --> 27:24.440
to take the stand that no no this works this is real and we told you this was gonna happen

27:24.440 --> 27:31.880
that's the point and so then they added financial incentives to that where they paid 30 000

27:31.880 --> 27:37.160
dollars for a covid death and they added legal incentive to that because they told people especially

27:37.160 --> 27:42.840
in new york city curiously enough that if you treated people for covid that there was no malpractice

27:42.840 --> 27:46.440
because you know it's a novel thing and we don't know what we're doing so you can't be blamed if you

27:46.440 --> 27:54.280
make mistakes now the interesting posit that i have to this hypothesis which i think a lot of people

27:54.280 --> 28:01.480
hate is that there are certain people that were co-opted or certain people that were put in place

28:01.480 --> 28:03.320
very early to make sure that the

28:06.760 --> 28:12.520
skepticism of the existence of a novel virus could be a controlled position as well

28:13.400 --> 28:19.080
and this is the the what has now come colloquially called as the no virus group or the no virus

28:19.080 --> 28:25.160
position and very typically the people that are associated with this very early on in fact by

28:25.240 --> 28:33.640
none other than kevin mccairn the raccoon commander um was very certain already in march of 2020

28:33.640 --> 28:42.920
that the no virus position as portrayed by andy coffman repeated the name over and over again

28:43.480 --> 28:52.920
needed to be destroyed snuffed out eliminated and the same had to happen for the people that said

28:52.920 --> 28:59.080
that the covid virus was caused by 5g these people also needed needed stomping

29:02.200 --> 29:07.720
and that's why i think that all of these people on both sides again not all of them but

29:08.680 --> 29:13.000
collectively all of them because they're winning and unwitting participants once you believe

29:13.640 --> 29:20.760
that that the guy to follow is is mike eden and then mike eden says well i'm kind of

29:20.760 --> 29:26.520
starting to become convinced that there are no viruses then you might move closer to the

29:26.520 --> 29:31.080
no viruses just because mike eden says so and he's a pretty trustworthy smart guy and i totally

29:31.080 --> 29:38.760
agree with that but i actually when mike eden was starting to go that way i sent an email to

29:38.760 --> 29:47.080
him and said like dude be careful because this is a trap because all of these past people i got

29:47.240 --> 29:51.640
unclipped for just one second because i i don't have my bookshelf over here i moved it out of the way

29:59.480 --> 30:05.560
i have this bookshelf on wheels because it's a real pain in the ass it's in the way all the time

30:06.760 --> 30:15.080
um but it's got all my stuff on it i can keep it away and i want the old book where is the old

30:15.640 --> 30:23.800
book that i have where you can go even nothing else but yeah here so

30:27.640 --> 30:33.960
what i'm oh i got to plug in again now i'm sorry i use wired monitors because it's just better

30:35.400 --> 30:40.120
and and well i have to use wired monitors i could use speaker monitors too but then you'd hear the

30:40.120 --> 30:46.040
echo in the room and i would have to play with that instead um so my argument is that

30:47.480 --> 30:53.880
that it is much more likely that something exists at that time scale this is a book that was thrown

30:53.880 --> 31:00.040
out of a library thrown out of the squib institute for medical research in princeton new jersey in

31:00.840 --> 31:09.800
june 18th 19 oh no this was added to the library in june 18th 1984 and then it was discarded

31:12.440 --> 31:18.520
and it's called the molecular biology and pathogenesis of corona viruses and it is from

31:19.160 --> 31:24.680
the state university of utrecht in utrecht the netherlands i could show it on here of course

31:25.640 --> 31:33.640
uh i need to go like this and then like this and then like that so it's this book here

31:37.320 --> 31:40.520
and it's got a lot of stuff in it um

31:42.360 --> 31:49.560
oh that was the other volumes in that series so here's the preface the present volume contains

31:49.640 --> 31:55.960
the proceedings of an embl workshop organized in june of 1983 at the institute of virology

31:55.960 --> 32:01.560
veterinary faculty at the university of utrecht in the netherlands some 70 scientists from 11

32:01.560 --> 32:05.080
countries followed the invitation to present and discuss their recent data on the structure

32:05.080 --> 32:11.080
replication genetics and pathogenesis of corona viruses now what i am suggesting see that they're

32:11.080 --> 32:18.040
they're usually three polypeptides now it's not what we know now we think it's like 27 or something

32:18.040 --> 32:23.400
like that which is curious isn't it right we've added all these things maybe we were just maybe

32:23.400 --> 32:29.400
we just took exosomes that were pretty simple and then we made them more complicated because

32:29.400 --> 32:35.720
we wanted to test out to see if that we could we could we could work out how how gene modification

32:35.720 --> 32:42.280
might work or genetic modification might work i don't anyway so look you have a nested set of

32:42.280 --> 32:48.680
five to six mRNAs in the expression of their large positive and single-stranded RNA genome

32:48.680 --> 32:53.720
to generate these subgenomic RNAs through specific fusion of non-contiguous sequences

32:55.480 --> 32:59.800
to mature by budding from intracellular membranes okay that's something that

32:59.800 --> 33:06.360
is different than budding from the outside which is what what in 2018 a few days ago we listened to

33:07.240 --> 33:13.560
to uh to David Baltimore tell us they're either budding from the outside of the cell or the cell

33:13.560 --> 33:18.280
is being broken because they're making so many viruses so that's interesting because coronaviruses

33:18.280 --> 33:23.400
don't do either of those they're supposed to be born in endosomes and then the endosomes are

33:23.400 --> 33:31.800
releasing them um and cause persistent infection with neurological involvement sometimes immunopathological

33:31.800 --> 33:38.760
conditions interesting you can see that this is a really good that there's real old book like

33:38.760 --> 33:46.280
you know this is almost like it's typed all this stuff is like typed it's really cool um and so in

33:46.280 --> 33:55.960
here are proceedings about what they what they worked on and so my and now this one's also out of

33:55.960 --> 34:03.000
focus that's so weird i don't know what's going on i these aren't that's not usually a problem i'm

34:03.000 --> 34:10.680
sorry i'll figure i'll fix this i will fix the focus

34:14.680 --> 34:23.240
that should be okay looks a little better um so i guess my what i wanted to say was and where i'm

34:23.320 --> 34:29.800
going with this i'm going to go back to the front where i'm going with this is trying to suggest

34:29.800 --> 34:40.040
that the no virus position if it's part of the same slow walk that Brett Weinstein was engaged

34:40.040 --> 34:46.040
in so Brett Weinstein was first wearing masks and first wearing the thing and first saying that

34:46.040 --> 34:53.000
zero covid for like until June 21 at least that zero covid was a viable goal that we should go for

34:54.360 --> 34:59.000
you know to avoid Laurie Garrett's prediction of oh the worst case scenario with one of these

34:59.000 --> 35:02.920
pandemic viruses is that it goes endemic and we have to suffer with it forever

35:05.720 --> 35:12.520
and so of course you could tell that exact story about a signal that was already there

35:13.160 --> 35:17.720
and that nobody cared about nobody paid any attention to they just called it pneumonia and

35:17.720 --> 35:25.880
influenza in statistics you could take that signal and characterize it well with molecular

35:25.880 --> 35:34.200
techniques whatever you want or you could just come up with an illusion of consensus that these

35:34.200 --> 35:39.560
molecular signals are associated with that and that if you don't have symptoms but you have the

35:39.560 --> 35:43.000
molecular signal that's just asymptomatic spread

35:45.480 --> 35:49.080
isn't that incredible that's asymptomatic spread stop lying

35:52.360 --> 36:00.440
and so that entire story that entire story was curated by people on television like Tony Fauci

36:00.440 --> 36:05.640
arguing with people in the Senate like Rand Paul about lab leak or natural virus

36:06.600 --> 36:15.560
this this intellectual idea was curated by people who said that there are no viruses at all that

36:15.560 --> 36:24.360
that the whole idea of germ theory is completely wrong there are no bacteria even are sometimes

36:24.360 --> 36:33.800
is is dropped in there and now if it's the same slow roll follow me if you've been here and you're

36:34.520 --> 36:41.560
you're still with me here if it's the same slow role then eventually we're going to get to the stage

36:41.560 --> 36:46.760
where they are very precise and they're going to say no no we were just talking about SARS-CoV-2

36:47.400 --> 36:53.640
they haven't isolated SARS-CoV-2 of course there are exosomes we don't know what else is there

36:53.640 --> 37:00.200
they're just lying oh no gain a function is fake of course gain a function is fake

37:00.520 --> 37:10.200
no no they probably just put the sooner or later these no virus people if this slow roll is correct

37:10.200 --> 37:17.640
they're going to also say things like maybe there was a background signal maybe there was a they

37:17.640 --> 37:23.400
confounded an existing background signal with a test that worked it's not a place they're at yet

37:24.200 --> 37:30.680
they are still at the place where there are no viruses we have not proven their existence there

37:30.680 --> 37:38.520
are no signals at this size scale so what were these people all doing in the 80s where were they

37:39.080 --> 37:46.920
what RNAs were they measuring what RNAs are they measuring here i'm not saying that this is

37:46.920 --> 37:53.240
great biology or look at these signals they're undeniable what i'm suggesting is is that there

37:53.320 --> 38:00.360
are hundreds of people that were looking at the RNA signals that can be found in these in these

38:00.360 --> 38:08.200
preparations can be found in these in these in these methodologies and trying to understand

38:08.200 --> 38:14.120
what they were and they weren't all liars they could have been misled and i think one of the main

38:14.120 --> 38:17.800
things that they were misled about is that the signal that they were studying was a pathogenic

38:17.880 --> 38:21.160
one rather than an innate one or an exogenous one

38:23.560 --> 38:27.880
other than that they're just measuring the RNA and trying to characterize what happens when they

38:27.880 --> 38:35.720
move it from one place to another and under the assumption that it's pathology instead of taking

38:35.720 --> 38:41.400
an endogenous signal from one organism and putting it into another and then that causing

38:41.400 --> 38:46.200
some obviously predictable immune reaction

38:49.240 --> 38:56.840
and so the no virus there there is no SARS-CoV-2 unless it is very well done very well explained

38:56.840 --> 39:00.440
can immediately tumble into something that nobody will listen to

39:02.360 --> 39:07.160
and indeed i would argue that that's the one thing that they've done so well and i'm i'm

39:07.160 --> 39:11.800
saving it because i have been watched it and i just know it exists that there was some point

39:11.800 --> 39:15.560
a c-h-d video where i think maryll nask kevin mccurnan

39:17.880 --> 39:23.560
andy koffman and somebody else all got together and argued about a very limited you know we're

39:23.560 --> 39:27.240
only going to argue about isolation and purification we're not going to talk about anything else

39:29.160 --> 39:31.480
and they never they they reached an impasse

39:31.480 --> 39:39.800
it's all a big show ladies and gentlemen it's all a big show

39:41.560 --> 39:46.600
and i do think that giga ohm biological is very close with this with this hypothesis right here

39:47.240 --> 39:54.520
the identification of infectious clones as the primary methodology by which all RNA virology

39:54.600 --> 40:01.880
is accomplished and standardized and the realization that these same methodologies have

40:01.880 --> 40:07.960
already been scaled up inside the pharmaceutical industry for at least two decades because we've

40:07.960 --> 40:12.440
been making monoclonal antibodies with very similar techniques process twos

40:15.320 --> 40:20.280
and so it is not ridiculous at all because we even have videos from the beginning of the pandemic

40:20.280 --> 40:23.800
where enovio was doing process two to make the spike protein

40:25.240 --> 40:33.240
spike protein RNA and DNA quite frankly and so they had had already started production of

40:34.520 --> 40:43.080
en masse the DNA and the RNA think about that because the DNA and the RNA is all you need for

40:43.160 --> 40:50.840
a PCR reaction to be positive if the end protein of this coronavirus is not specific

40:50.840 --> 40:55.480
and not very you know unique which i don't think it is

40:58.120 --> 41:03.800
then uh then you just have a nonspecific test in the background and and there is no there are no

41:03.800 --> 41:08.520
viruses there are no coronaviruses viruses haven't been isolated or purified

41:08.520 --> 41:16.680
is a really weird kind of parallel but not exact attempt to explain why they're lying

41:19.480 --> 41:25.560
and so maybe i hope i'm not blowing it i'm probably going too long here let's just get

41:25.560 --> 41:31.800
started because i got a lot of i got a lot of uh

41:32.280 --> 41:40.760
you see the thing is that's that this mod RNA guy in the chat is uh a lot of fun

41:42.520 --> 41:48.920
because he he's he's always engaged in the same thing he's always trying to get me to defend virus

41:48.920 --> 41:54.920
isolation and sequencing with controls it's it's isolation that these no virus people are

41:54.920 --> 42:00.200
concerned about in purification that these people are concerned about and the way that they dissect

42:00.760 --> 42:09.160
the the experiments with regard to metagenomic sequencing

42:11.560 --> 42:20.440
the way that they dissect the the uh isolation and purification of viruses is totally correct

42:20.440 --> 42:24.600
and there's nobody who would deny that because people have been saying that for a while

42:25.560 --> 42:29.320
and they aren't the first people to say it right people said that about AIDS

42:31.880 --> 42:40.200
and so the argument that i'm making is that it is very very dangerous to say that there's

42:40.200 --> 42:44.520
nothing at this size scale that none of these signals are real because people have

42:46.200 --> 42:51.640
in lots of different contexts been looking at the things at this size scale for many decades

42:51.640 --> 42:57.720
something is there and for some reason or another somebody like david baltimore

42:58.280 --> 43:05.720
was encouraged to waste his time making a hour-long video explaining the generalities of virology

43:05.720 --> 43:13.400
in 2018 even though we know most of those generalities aren't true and we know that exosomal

43:13.400 --> 43:21.160
communication exists maybe we have to do another show on exosomes because

43:21.720 --> 43:30.440
to make to make clear that these these departments existed in the early 2000s that these

43:30.440 --> 43:35.400
investigators existed in the early 2000s and everybody was fired up about it in the early 2000s

43:35.400 --> 43:41.560
and then all of those investigators got absorbed into exosomes associated with cancer

43:42.760 --> 43:50.040
it's the literal truth because that's where the money was and using exosomes to diagnose cancer

43:50.040 --> 43:58.360
you can't get money for studying exosomes in health there's there's no grants but there's

43:58.360 --> 44:05.240
millions if not billions of dollars available for um for studying exosomes in the context

44:05.240 --> 44:12.120
of cancer and so there you go there it's gone now you're a cancer researcher and you've got tenure

44:12.120 --> 44:16.040
and you've got money and you have your respect and you have your own little niche

44:16.600 --> 44:23.160
it's exactly how it works so the reason why i want to visit tom kawen is because i think

44:23.720 --> 44:33.080
tom kawen is potentially um a medler in the sense of play to roll in maybe containing

44:33.800 --> 44:40.440
mark and sam bailey for example um i have revealed on the show before and i could show it again

44:40.440 --> 44:45.400
that i emailed sam bailey very early in the pandemic because i was very impressed with

44:45.480 --> 44:49.960
her analysis of the pcr test and i actually was saying the same thing at that time

44:50.760 --> 44:55.880
that it could be a combination of a hot background or just a non-specific test

44:56.600 --> 45:03.320
um and at that time she was also saying the same thing not really saying there are no viruses

45:03.320 --> 45:12.280
she didn't care about isolation or or purification at that time and so i contacted her and she was

45:12.280 --> 45:16.360
pregnant and gonna have a baby so she said after that maybe in six months or so she could

45:16.360 --> 45:24.440
contact me again and then by the time those six months had expired kevin mccairn my what i thought

45:24.440 --> 45:33.800
was kind of a colleague um had was playing these these meme videos where her mouth was full of hot

45:33.800 --> 45:42.920
dogs and there were you know like bimbo bailey kind of thing and really full on the the no-virus

45:42.920 --> 45:50.520
attack like you gotta we gotta snuff these people these idiots out and so because i had used what

45:50.520 --> 45:56.280
i thought was adenovirus to transfect my mice for me and i still still think it's adenovirus um

45:57.480 --> 46:03.640
it's the name we have for those those constructs um to transfect my mice or in this case

46:03.720 --> 46:15.400
transform um oh no it was actually transfect i feel as though uh i was vulnerable to accepting

46:15.400 --> 46:21.720
you know the virology as it stood and so this this seemed like a kind of sidebar to distract

46:21.720 --> 46:26.440
from the idea that it could be a lab leak and so if you told everybody that there was no virus

46:26.440 --> 46:33.320
that this would make sense that wow okay so then lab leak is also crazy right that never dawned

46:33.320 --> 46:37.400
on me it dawned what dawned on me was is that you could say there was no virus and then that would

46:37.400 --> 46:42.920
keep a lot of people away from ever suspecting that this was actually a man-made disaster

46:44.040 --> 46:50.120
that was a very enticing mystery for me to solve and people like kevin mccairn made sure that i

46:50.120 --> 46:55.640
thought it was an enticing mystery that people at drastic made sure that i that i thought that i

46:55.640 --> 47:01.400
was on it that i was one of the best in terms of you know being at the front edge of of solving this

47:01.400 --> 47:09.960
mystery and i didn't understand that i was being played that i was being lied to by multiple people

47:11.560 --> 47:15.720
even though i should have i mean drastic is almost exclusively people who don't use their

47:15.720 --> 47:24.840
own name especially at that time and on the far spectrum of this me being kind of on the side of

47:25.320 --> 47:32.120
of adi ads and paul katrel and kevin mccairn at the in in april and may

47:34.120 --> 47:42.360
was to oppose uh anti-coffman because he says there are no viruses and that he says this is all

47:42.360 --> 47:46.280
pleomorphic cycle or something like that and he would go off and i'll be like oh i don't want

47:46.280 --> 47:50.120
anything about that that's crazy all i know is that our immune system is probably better off

47:50.920 --> 47:56.520
just hopefully you know be healthy i didn't know that was the only thing i knew for sure

47:59.000 --> 48:03.240
but in the meantime all these people just like the people who knew fear and cleavage site was a

48:03.240 --> 48:08.760
lab leak in february these people knew there was no virus and so i had to look that up actually

48:08.760 --> 48:15.000
i'm going to change that now i had to look that up it was 2023 it was just a year ago so we can do

48:15.000 --> 48:23.000
that like that and then i can resume the slideshow there we go um so we're going to do 2024

48:23.000 --> 48:29.640
versus 2023 so from 2024 i have selected a tom kawin question and answer video which i found on

48:29.640 --> 48:37.720
sub stack thanks to one of you guys um and then i'm going to watch at higher speed the video that

48:37.720 --> 48:44.600
supposedly was made in response to my email that i wrote when i was still a um scientific

48:44.600 --> 48:51.560
advisor for uh Robert F Kennedy jr and before i had actually started working for chd um i was

48:51.560 --> 48:57.160
still helping with the book and uh mary holland actually asked me to write a response to christine

48:57.160 --> 49:02.280
massy and the response that i wrote was basically what i've been trying to teach for the last

49:03.160 --> 49:08.840
you know year or so which is that i think that there's a way for all of us to be right

49:09.720 --> 49:15.320
i think that you guys are right about there being no sarsko v2 virus isolated or spreading

49:15.320 --> 49:20.120
around the world i think you're right about the pcr test being used to create that illusion

49:20.920 --> 49:25.080
but i also think you might underestimate how easy it would be for them to create that

49:25.080 --> 49:31.080
illusion with real molecular signals that they could use infectious clones to see the narrative

49:31.080 --> 49:35.000
and it wouldn't need to spread it would just need to be culturable it just need to be

49:35.000 --> 49:40.760
sequenceable and it would convince even more people that would otherwise be able to see through

49:40.760 --> 49:46.680
the illusion because this would be seen as sort of like gold standard proof that was beyond a

49:46.680 --> 49:51.960
reasonable doubt and that i thought we could come together on this idea and it would be very

49:51.960 --> 49:58.840
exciting and they laid into it what did they do they got immediately mad and they wanted

49:58.840 --> 50:02.440
they wanted me to send papers to show that infectious clones were real

50:03.720 --> 50:07.080
and and called me uh and just another one of these people

50:10.680 --> 50:15.240
and so there was no bridge there was no attempt to understand there was oh wow you want to you

50:15.240 --> 50:19.480
want to listen to us you think a lot of things we know nothing at all was an immediate attack

50:19.480 --> 50:20.760
slander bang boom

50:20.920 --> 50:31.320
um and there was a little bit of a conversation with mary and um christine massy that was recorded

50:31.320 --> 50:38.680
on somewhere and i think it was uh a doctors for covid ethics meeting and mary said it very

50:38.680 --> 50:44.920
subtly um that we don't think that it's it's a nuanced enough position and that's basically what

50:44.920 --> 50:48.040
i said in my email that i wrote for them on their behalf

50:50.520 --> 50:58.440
and she rejected them and so here we are now still separated rather than coming together on the

50:58.440 --> 51:04.040
idea that they lied to us that we've been lied to collectively we're still separated we're still

51:04.040 --> 51:10.360
fighting about this and so maryll nass even writes a sub stack about how we shouldn't be fighting

51:10.360 --> 51:16.360
but then she seems to signal that she's talking about people like mike eden or jessica hocket

51:16.360 --> 51:18.680
or mark kulek or jonathan cooey

51:20.120 --> 51:26.440
she's not talking about the no virus people anymore as being dividers or or could bring us

51:26.440 --> 51:32.520
together when they have a tremendous following of people who are already very skeptical already

51:32.520 --> 51:38.840
very open-minded and already willing to understand that they've been lied to but it's not a simple lie

51:40.760 --> 51:45.560
and if you give people a simple explanation that is not sufficient then you're not giving them

51:45.560 --> 51:51.000
the freedom you're not giving them the informed consent that you claim you are and i would argue

51:51.000 --> 52:00.040
that maybe Andy Kaufman maybe Tom Cowan maybe that was their role for 2020 and 2021 to make sure

52:00.040 --> 52:05.960
that people like Sam Bailey and and Mark Bailey or make sure that people like Stefan Lanka would

52:05.960 --> 52:11.480
have somebody in front of them so that the real message of wow they're lying to us would never get

52:11.480 --> 52:18.600
out and instead would be clouded by this you know all this technical talk about what is isolation

52:18.600 --> 52:24.520
and control and what is what is purification and control and we only want to argue about these

52:24.520 --> 52:29.560
two things because if these two things aren't right and they don't have any proof and these

52:29.560 --> 52:36.520
foyas are real then then there's no discussion anymore yeah technically that's true

52:38.840 --> 52:44.280
but it doesn't seem like a very genuine way to bring everybody on your side when reality is is

52:44.280 --> 52:49.560
that they lied to us and we might not know all the lies we might not have all the details

52:50.520 --> 52:55.640
and there might be some technologies we don't fully understand there might be some

52:59.880 --> 53:06.760
there might be some things we don't understand so let's go let's do this i know that was a terribly

53:06.760 --> 53:11.160
long introduction 52 minutes i'm should almost stop this video and start it again

53:11.880 --> 53:18.600
um so that we can get it right so this is just taken from very recently i think it's just last

53:18.600 --> 53:24.040
week even here we go okay hello everybody thanks for joining me again for another wednesday webinar

53:24.040 --> 53:29.480
today may first 2024 oh no it's a couple days ago there we go the significance of mayday is but

53:29.960 --> 53:36.040
it's got something to do with workers i think okay uh don't think there's any announcements

53:37.560 --> 53:42.600
so let me get right into it today i wanted to talk about a subject that i've talked about before

53:43.240 --> 53:49.080
but this week on tuesday one of the weekly webinars now there's not very many of them that i actually

53:49.080 --> 53:54.200
watch is uh the bailey's sam and mark i believe it comes out every tuesday morning at least for me

53:55.080 --> 54:01.960
and i want it to piggyback a little bit uh on the uh on the webinar they did i get on hypermectin

54:02.920 --> 54:09.720
but i also think i think that there's really no argument mr and a man mod r and a this is a

54:09.720 --> 54:16.200
response to a chat i don't think that there can be any argument made that pcr can work

54:17.000 --> 54:22.680
i don't think there can be any argument made that sequencing works um i don't think there

54:22.680 --> 54:29.480
can be any argument made that that growing large amounts of dna in a bacterial culture works i

54:29.480 --> 54:35.400
don't think there is any argument that can be made that if you take and construct what they call an

54:35.400 --> 54:39.800
infectious clone and then apply it to a cell culture that the cell culture may react to it

54:40.600 --> 54:48.680
um it may cause things to change uh i also think that this is enough for them to with an illusion

54:48.760 --> 54:55.320
of consensus between virologists uh wittingly and unwittingly to create the illusion that this is a

54:55.320 --> 55:01.000
significant threat to our well-being when it's not and that they can create the illusion that

55:01.000 --> 55:05.960
none of these signals are our own none of these signals are endogenous they're all pathogenic

55:05.960 --> 55:14.840
obligate pathogens from outside and that's of course a mythology but if the goal is to slow roll us

55:14.840 --> 55:21.000
to that truth while they controlled demolition the entire republic of the west

55:21.960 --> 55:27.640
um then these people may be a part of it because eventually we do have to get to the truth

55:27.640 --> 55:32.920
it's just that we don't want to get to it too fast and because if we get to it too fast that

55:32.920 --> 55:38.040
all of us won't be in the cage when we finally learn the truth that's really what i believe

55:38.040 --> 55:46.600
they're doing to us we could have had everything and know everything that we know right now in 2020

55:46.600 --> 55:53.640
because mary holland maryll nass robert f Kennedy jr and all the people that work for chd

55:53.640 --> 55:58.760
knew that the vaccine schedule in america was criminal and if compared to any other vaccine

55:58.760 --> 56:06.520
schedule in world would be obviously criminal so they could have told us that right away in 2020

56:06.520 --> 56:11.560
said it unequivocally this is the time to realize that the public health apparatus is

56:11.560 --> 56:16.360
crucially it's crucially corrupt but they didn't

56:22.360 --> 56:26.840
instead we thought we talked about mandates and we talked about censorship and we're still

56:26.840 --> 56:33.080
talking about mandates and censorship they're not actually going for the throat because it's

56:33.080 --> 56:39.320
not time to go to the throat yet because not all the pigs are in the cage

56:41.480 --> 56:53.640
not all the brains are trapped not everybody is locked in once everybody's inside the gate

56:53.640 --> 57:00.600
will close and it'll be over for our grandchildren and at that time there will be everybody will

57:00.760 --> 57:05.720
be inside and then everybody will say see the no virus people were right there was never a

57:05.720 --> 57:11.480
SARS-CoV-2 they were lying about it see kui was right there was a background signal

57:12.280 --> 57:17.000
see and it'll be too late i'll be dead

57:20.200 --> 57:27.320
my kids will be gone and the only people that will remember will be a few old people on their

57:27.320 --> 57:30.200
rocking chairs who just happened to catch me when they were in college

57:32.680 --> 57:39.320
just like i'm talking about Ted Gunderson or Mike Rupert or Ed Griffin for that matter

57:39.320 --> 57:42.120
who i'm going to get a chance to meet in june god willing

57:44.360 --> 57:50.360
and then their stories will also disappear like elders lost

57:50.440 --> 57:58.520
it's a slow role ladies and gentlemen and certain people were put in place to make sure the role

57:58.520 --> 58:04.040
would be slow they stepped in front of other people who were speaking out stepped in front

58:04.040 --> 58:07.640
of other people and that stepping in front of other people is the trick to see

58:10.440 --> 58:15.960
and i don't know who did it but i suspect we could figure it out if we wanted to i suspect

58:15.960 --> 58:19.080
each of us could figure it out if we wanted to okay tom sorry go ahead

58:19.080 --> 58:23.080
i think that they everybody who's interested in the subject of ivermectin

58:23.080 --> 58:28.200
should absolutely go watch that video that webinar or whatever it is that just came out with

58:28.200 --> 58:32.280
i think it's dr sambailey.com i'm not sure exactly that's exactly the right website

58:32.920 --> 58:38.200
but absolutely that should be checked out and i just wanted to not correct anything not by any

58:38.200 --> 58:43.960
means but just to emphasize some things just which i have actually been over before

58:44.680 --> 58:49.560
the reason of course is i'm continually well i don't know if i'd use the word shocked or

58:49.560 --> 58:54.600
surprised because not too much shocks or surprises me anymore but let's just say

58:54.600 --> 58:59.480
interested in how many of the people that i know who are allegedly in the health freedom

58:59.480 --> 59:04.680
space and community are either taking ivermectin so-called prophylactically

59:05.400 --> 59:10.760
or have taken it for nice illness that they've had in the last four years good for you tom claim

59:10.760 --> 59:17.960
to be covid i wouldn't have expected that maybe maybe i would but it's just there's so many of them

59:18.520 --> 59:24.200
that i think it's still worth revisiting that subject because i guess the bottom line here is

59:24.200 --> 59:31.960
this is one of those clever they they being the perpetrators or the controllers or whatever you

59:31.960 --> 59:37.960
want to call them have a very clear strategy with so many things so many things of there's a

59:37.960 --> 59:43.640
conventional narrative and then there's the alternative narrative which always cast

59:43.640 --> 59:49.160
so is he so versions and usually there's so do you think that he was saying this already as long as

59:49.160 --> 59:55.800
we've been saying it the idea that they have so many plans in place

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:06.360
actually most of the time when these people encounter anybody they insist on talking about

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.280
only one damn thing and that's isolation or purification of viruses that's it they only want

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.400
to talk about whether you believe sometimes they even tell you that unless you'll say that there's

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.960
there's no virus i don't even want to speak to you that's how they roll

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:30.280
and so there is no effort to connect there is no effort to come to some collective understanding

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.720
and he will now tell you that they've never engaged in any insults or or been short with

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:43.160
anybody or been less than cordial it's just all of us being really uh mean and stuff like that

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:49.080
jay cooey being really mean being one of them you'll see in a minute when we watch the their

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:56.440
response video to my email you're gonna love it elements of intrigue and collusion and criminal

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.800
activity against the dominant uh people in the dominant system and that becomes the alternative

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:08.760
narrative close my window here and that's the only two things you're allowed to believe

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.400
so in this case the of course the alternative uh sorry the conventional

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.760
narrative for co for covid is caused by a virus and the only possible uh you know preventative

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.680
treatment or thing you can do to stop the virus at the end of the day because we know hand washing

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.640
and masks and social distancing and all that don't really work so you have to do the vaccine

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.880
and then along comes the so-called freedom community and you don't need me to name any

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:39.320
names here but most of them have been in lockstep about this saying oh no there's this pandemic

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.960
for sure and it's caused by a virus for sure now we think it's a lab leak virus or a lab

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:49.480
created virus we've been over that but even a bigger scandal is whatever whichever virus it's

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.000
caused by it certainly is effectively treated by this safe and effective we've heard that one before

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.600
drug called ivermectin which is cheap and it's a miracle drug and so the reason that they've

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.840
suppressed that uh the treat the the successful almost miraculous treatment of this viral infection

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.800
with this miracle drug called ivermectin is because there's seemingly some clause that says

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:18.760
if there's an effective treatment for this pandemic or this situation then you can't fast track or

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.520
some administrative words of the vaccine so they had to the narrative the alternative narrative

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:30.200
goes you had to get rid of the ivermectin story unfortunately for us poor people because ivermectin

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.480
is such a wonderful drug and anyways there was a nobel prize given for the discovery of ivermectin

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.640
which if you know anything about the nobel prize process that should make red the strongest red

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.920
flags go off uh you know joining the ranks of uh i want to show you something this reminds me

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:53.000
enders and a whole bunch of other nobel prize winners um so uh and they've suppressed the

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.800
research and the anecdotal experience and the experience of numerous hard-working frontline

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:05.800
doctors all out there saving lives with this wonder drug called ivermectin and the only reason

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.960
the government and the pharmaceutical companies are suppressing this antiviral wonder drug is because

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.360
if they allowed that to get out people would have an easy treatment for covid and then they wouldn't

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.280
be able to fast track the vaccine and then they wouldn't be able to kill us all with the vaccine

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:26.440
so if you're an alternatively leaning person that's your that's what you're meant to believe

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.520
and of course neither of those have any relation to reality and just to give you an idea you hear

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.640
many many doctors you know going on their various platforms and talking about

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:46.360
I really got to say I think um the only thing I can say is kudos to tom for explaining it so well

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:54.760
um you know that I've been saying this for quite some time now um and the only thing for me is that

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:59.880
I just didn't understand how many people were involved in it I still at some point thought that

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:07.880
CHD and the people at the top of CHD were all just in it to win it and they once they had my

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:14.680
information they were gonna crush of course now you know what happened with me and CHD uh whatever

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:21.400
I said on December 23rd apparently got me fired I want to show you this newspaper that I have from

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:33.000
Norway it is um it is the address vison address vison uh and it is uh from how the hell's the date

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:43.640
holy shit uh 10 10 uh 10 10 0 9 um and so this is the the time when the peace prize was given to

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:52.360
to uh to this guy um Barack Obama and the reason why I want to show you this is because

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:06.040
well I got to look at the page it's on 18 you know there are newspapers in the world that's funny

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:11.320
on 18 here we go there it is so check this out I just want to show you this because

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:18.920
um it's funny and he mentioned Nobel Prize right so first of all star star for that

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:25.160
explanation on what ivermectin in early treatment was um actually thomas binder and i have also

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:33.160
explained that very well and actually mike eden was cited by maryll nass in her second to latest

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:41.880
substack um where she said that that mike eden attacked uh uh test lorry for advocating for

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:48.440
early treatment uh for a disease that didn't exist and and kind of said that this kind of

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.600
division wasn't uh wasn't was gonna ruin us because there definitely was a covid and then

01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:00.520
today she did a substack restacking uh a couple other articles that she wrote about why there's

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:08.840
really a covid oh the insistence the insistence is revealing the certainty is revealing check

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:17.240
this out this is this is yours truly in the uh Norwegian newspaper standing in the road of uh

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:27.960
trondheim and here oh shit that was a aberrant aberrant mouse click there i apologize um here

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:36.920
it is jonathan jkui 37 oh man look how fat i am and healthy um from wisconsin and matt burt from

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:44.200
illinois we only met each other that day and never talked again um we were both uh our obama

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:49.480
sympathizers but we both say that it's a really big mistake and i'm actually quoted in here as

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:57.480
as uh saying that it undermines it is not a not a candidate for the nobel peace price says

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:05.000
hentia new biologist jonathan kui from wisconsin um so i don't know if that got me on a shit list or

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.200
not but anyway there's that that's one of my most favorite little things i got from uh

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:18.120
from norway my time there that was a fun interview um so yeah tom kawen sorry we we are we're having

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.160
fun because he's actually doing really well a crucial point i can't emphasize that enough a crucial

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:29.960
point is that ivermectin is an anti-viral agent that is crucial to the whole story so of course

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:35.800
nobody asked them ever and up to this point not that i've looked extensively but i've never heard

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.800
extensively but i've never heard any of them not cori not col not kirsch he's not a doctor

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:49.160
not mr cola not melone not big tree nobody's saying here's how we have proven that ivermectin

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:58.120
is an anti-viral agent absolutely a magnificent point um wasn't ivermectin

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.480
identified by domain as being a potential candidate wasn't that the whole

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:11.320
am i wrong is is mark in the chat was it was it also on domain because that might be one of the

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:18.440
only reasons why they think it works um that is an interesting uh observation he's definitely not

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:28.840
wrong um anti-viral is very very specific term um that doesn't mean very much in the context of an

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.040
infectious cycle cartoon that we know is wrong therefore there is a plausible rationale thanks

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:39.560
mark we're using it for covid now that's curious because why didn't anybody ask them why didn't

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.600
anybody ask peter mccullick how does he know that ivermectin is an anti-viral agent i would like that

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.640
to be struck from the record because peter mccullo is advocating for hydroxychloroquine at the beginning

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:55.480
of the pandemic not ivermectin and it's actually pere cori who has a book about ivermectin that's

01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:01.480
a mistake that's annoying since it's one of the things that his clinic regularly uses and sells

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.920
for people who are suffering from the viral infection called covid so that could be his

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:11.720
clinic could sell it the wellness company also distributes it uh it's also been associated

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.160
with zeb zalenko although i would suggest to you that that's also wrong because zeb was not

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:23.960
advocating for ivermectin he was actually near his death advocating for zinc ionophores and zinc

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.480
supplementation that's it and he didn't even specify what zinc ionophore you could choose

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:35.960
he gave you a list there's a green tea extract there is a thing called quesareton however you

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:42.600
say it and then i think hydroxychloroquine is also thought to be a mobilizer of zinc although i am

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:50.440
not an expert on the the chemical attributes of hydroxychloroquine oh the sam went over this but

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.520
i wanted to emphasize this uh because this is again something i've talked about before

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.840
but everybody should know this in their back pocket they should know it cold so if you run

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:05.320
into anybody who touts ivermectin or treating covid you can pull this out and ask them the first

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.600
question you ask them how do they who how when did they demonstrate that ivermectin is an anti-viral

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.760
agent so here's how the story goes our old friend leon kailey who's the quote virologist from

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.160
australia who wrote one of the most important papers which i won't pull up but it's on sam's

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:29.080
webinar uh wrote one of the most important covid papers because it was the paper that described

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:35.320
the i believe the first case of isolation of sars kov-2 outside of china that is to say in australia

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:41.320
so how did he do it of course he took one person who was diagnosed with covid how was he diagnosed

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:47.400
based on the christian drossden pcr primers even though christian drossden says in his paper

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.360
we designed or came up with these primers without ever having access to the virus

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.320
which is an amazing slight of hand if you think about it no it's not see this is where i think

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:06.200
they go wrong and so what i would very respectfully like to explain is that if the proxy that is

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:13.880
accepted by the consensus is the presence of the sequence then looking for a sequence

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.320
can be done using primers designed from that sequence you don't need to have

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:26.200
that sequence in the house you don't have to have the infectious cloned copy of that sequence you

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:34.200
just have to know the sequence and there is some truth to this and it works with endogenous genes

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:40.840
with endogenous RNA and and we we know how to do that the question is whether or not the fidelity

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.160
of these primers in this test on whatever background is present is real

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:53.240
the question is whether or not this signal was present before 2020 or not or would have been

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:59.400
present with any with with the same frequency that it was measured once we started rolling

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:08.120
out these many many tests and so he's very right but he's also very wrong

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:13.720
and it's that subtle wrongness that whether it's whitting or unwitting we've got to correct

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:20.440
because PCR works it is highly precise if you use nested primers it's ridiculously precise

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.000
and if we wanted to demonstrate that the nicotinic receptor content of of a certain

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.440
internor on subclass in the brain of a mouse was upregulated in a certain context we could do it

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:39.240
and we would measure the mRNA in single cells and we could show a difference between the transcript

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.720
count in a one neuron versus an inactivated neuron that's possible

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.880
and with very vigorous controls that's even publishable

01:12:52.520 --> 01:13:01.640
but none of that rigor that underlies the specificity of PCR in the context of academic biology was

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:07.240
applied in the context of the pandemic because it was an emergency because we had to cut corners

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:13.080
and so that opened the door for lies and exaggeration about the fidelity of these products in the

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:19.800
first place but by distracting people and saying that well he didn't even have the virus so how

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.960
could he how could he design primers is misrepresenting how this biology works

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:33.720
and completely distracting you wittingly or unwittingly from the possibility whatever that is that

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:41.080
there was a background signal that could be distorted as the spread of something and there aren't very

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.920
many examples that work very well for this but if I try the best one I can come up with is automobiles

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.320
if you could somehow convince people that there are no automobiles in the world

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:59.160
and then give them a test and say if you go down to your garage

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:07.000
and you look for wheels you may be an asymptomatic carrier of an automobile

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.080
you could be very specific about it if you wanted to at first so that it that you didn't know

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.280
whether you had it or not it might be that the the specific version is a Toyota

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:26.760
the deadly version is a Toyota then it changes to Kia and so if the test is for rubber wheels in

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.560
your garage then a lot of people test positive if they test but it would all depend on whether

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.760
they were given a test or not everybody else would just not know that they had an automobile because

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.960
they've been convinced that there are no automobiles in the world until they brought a test to their

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:47.640
garage and they found out they had an automobile and then we could sequence them we could say wow

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.520
it's currently the Toyota going around and you wouldn't have the resolution because you were

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.840
just measuring for wheels but you would assume it was a Toyota because if it is it could kill

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:05.320
your grandparents and then slowly but surely they can roll out this this this evolutionary tree of

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:14.520
wow it's gone from Toyota to Kia to and and now the latest variant is a Chevy and because you

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.440
weren't testing for Chevys at the beginning of the pandemic then you didn't find them

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:28.040
and so as we move forward and farther and farther it seems like this this idea of an automobile has

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:37.800
spread everywhere they're literally everywhere holy shit I guess it went endemic and the only

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.440
trick that's necessary there is if you could possibly convince the entire world that there

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.680
were no automobiles that they didn't exist they don't you don't know what they are we don't

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.560
understand them but everybody's vulnerable we all need transportation

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:58.440
little did you know that you've been riding around in an automobile and you didn't know it that's

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:06.520
the illusion of a coronavirus pandemic if my hypothesis is true and that is that there is a

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:12.600
signal out there that could easily be distorted as a high resolution high fidelity measurement

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:20.120
of a spreading pathogen when it really wasn't and there's good molecular biological tools

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:29.320
and good method logic oh I mean microbiological methodologies with which to construct that illusion

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:36.920
and so by saying things as simple as well he didn't have the virus so how could he make PCR

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:44.440
test that just shows that either he doesn't understand how PCR works as a tool in an academic

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:52.040
bench setting where there are adequate controls and the the goal is is the highest fidelity possible

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.280
versus what happened during the pandemic

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.920
and it misleads people into thinking that there's a real simple way to object to this when it's not

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.240
that simple and all the academic biologists know that that's part of the reason why they keep their

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:18.520
mouth shut I hope I'm not wasting my time here this is a real important message to get right but

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:26.680
it might take me more than one try because it is a very subtle nuanced message I don't know what

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:33.400
the truth is but it is more complicated than these people often projected as and that frustrates me

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:39.080
that's all I'm saying I would love to talk to them about it how can you develop a test using a piece

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:45.160
of something when you never had access to something to the something that obviously is irrational

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.520
illogical and ridiculous but anyway so they used that to claim this person had covid then they took

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.400
some of their mucus otherwise known as snot didn't look for any virus in it didn't purify it

01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.920
meaning they didn't extract a virus from that did the usual inoculate that on monkey kidney

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:05.720
cells take away the nutrition and the antibiotics and the fetal calf serum you the monkey kidney

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:11.960
cells broke down and in some bizarre Orwellian use of the word isolation that becomes the first

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:19.160
isolate which has a name outside of China right so that's called the isolation of SARS-CoV-2

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:25.320
which again is totally illogical ridiculous and anti-scientific how is isolation obtained

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:31.720
through the process of adding stuff to mucus then turns out this same by the way

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.400
that was the same paper which we've again gone over many times where they showed electron microscope

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:43.640
images of the SARS-CoV-2 virions that's individual viruses that they obtained from this culture

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.720
with the comment that they didn't look like the usual coronavirus spiked virions until they added

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:55.160
trypsin to digest away the outside protein coat and there when they digested it then it looked

01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.160
like it had spikes which is it's amazing that they get away with this but they do and so he was the

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:08.040
guy who did that but but that's just cutting the fear and cleavage site of the protein so that

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:13.320
it changes configuration instead of being a little knob becomes longer and floppier

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:22.120
which again I'm not willing to say that all protein biologists are lying we've been studying

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:28.280
the fusion proteins of these exosomes for a long time and we know that there are a lot of common

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:34.520
mechanisms and hinges in these tertiary structures of these proteins and that certain

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.680
regions of these proteins are highly conserved because of that functionality

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:47.320
now again I think it's possible here that this slippery slope is now suggesting that all these

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.240
protein people are lying that all these measurements that we've made are bullshit

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:58.520
that these proteins themselves don't exist so that when we treat them with trypsin we shouldn't

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:04.600
expect them to change configuration a virologist can listen to this and then say yeah but I mean

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.360
come on we know that they change configuration when you expose them to trypsin rixie would say the

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:19.080
same thing mccaren would say the same thing and so it's a difficult place for me to be here because

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.240
again I don't want to attack anybody anymore I don't want to say any but I just think we've all

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:30.360
been so thoroughly confused and he's there he's very close he knows that they've got everything

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:36.280
covered so if he knows that they've got everything covered I wonder if he suspected of anybody in

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:45.960
his group was also covered or part of the cover up so maybe it's not Tom maybe it's Andy

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:53.960
Andy Kaufman gave some talks that included the word exosome in early 2020 and then never again

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.320
and I noticed that his talk at the red pill conference has nothing to do with viruses at all

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:07.720
in in in june I can't believe I'm on the same speaker card as Andrew Kaufman and Mickey Willis

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:14.440
in june it's it's absolutely insane but I'm gonna try my best to express my

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:23.240
frustration with the lack of nuance and the lack of of sophistication with regard to opposing

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:29.160
this mythology and I agree with the general strategy of start with the idea that they've

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.040
lied or exaggerated just like peter teal said in 2019 that I play over and over because I think

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:40.040
it's important to realize that that's the truth that the specialization has allowed people to really

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:46.120
just go off in any direction they want and create all kinds of of models of reality that

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:53.000
don't need to be verified and virology is is is one of the most glaring examples of that and so

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.880
there are many of these objections are very right and then some of them are done so awkwardly that

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:07.480
they end up undermining the other good arguments that they make and I just am I can become suspicious

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.320
as to whether that's on purpose or by accident in other words we found stars from pieces of

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.800
wood but only after we called a carpenter who to cut the outside pieces out so that would look

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:23.880
like stars that's the level of scientific discord here so then he takes this broken down cell

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:28.600
culture of monkey kidney cells he inoculates that onto another culture of monkey kidney cells

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:34.840
doesn't doesn't use a control or says he uses a mock control which has nothing in it so nothing

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:41.800
from any inoculated monkey kidney cells and doesn't actually describe the the actual details of the

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.080
mock infection so we have no idea that everything else was even the same as in the so in the experimental

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:53.400
group which means it is not a scientific paper so then he takes this monkey broken down monkey

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:58.520
kidney cell again takes away the nutrients adds it to to the monkey kidney a new batch of monkey

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.000
kidney cells and then takes away the nutrition adds more antibiotics more fetal calf serum

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.200
and in this time he adds a little bit of ivermectin and then he finds that the kidney cells

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:14.920
took longer in the added ivermectin group than in the no added ivermectin group which he claims

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:20.600
shows that ivermectin killed the stars cove two or inhibited the growth of the stars cove two

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:27.400
virus just to be clear at no point in this did any virus actually get discovered or found or

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:32.200
identified there was no point in this experiment where you could even possibly conclude that it

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.080
was inhibiting the growth of the virus all you can say is that when you take broken down monkey

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.720
kidney cells with snot in it and you inoculate that onto other monkey kidney cells and the one

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:47.080
you add ivermectin and the other you don't the one you add ivermectin took longer to break down than

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.400
the one that you didn't add ivermectin so he's more or less right i'm sure i would could look

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.240
at the paper but i'm sure he's more or less right and i think that this is indeed part of

01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:01.400
the illusion that they intended to create they also did experiments right with hydroxychloroquine

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:07.880
or with ivermectin where it was obvious that they weren't testing it in the right context or with

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:15.800
the appropriate dose or with real people and so then all of these these objections were were visible

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:23.160
like it wasn't even it was like so hamfistedly done that at first it seemed like wow they're

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.560
so desperate but then when you look at it in retrospect it looks much more like it was just

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:34.200
orchestrated and then they gave these torches to the people that were part of the controlled

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.480
opposition here you you carry the torch of hydroxychloroquine for a little while here you carry the

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:45.080
torch of ivermectin for us and write a book here you carry the torch of verus for a while and focus

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:51.000
exclusively on that and if we have to we'll pull Malone out and he can carry the torch on

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.800
objecting to the RNA claiming that he invented it and he'll just slow roll his objection from a

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:11.720
beach in hawaii all the way up to the senate in 2024 so he's kind of on it you know and that's

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.720
really great it's too bad we could have been here a year ago at least we could have been here a year

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.800
ago with with mary holland and maybe even bobby kennedy in a zoom meeting but we aren't

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.720
i wanted that real bad but for some reason it just didn't happen

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:37.240
and for some reason instead mary holland and christine massy met on a on a doctors for covid

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:44.760
ethics show and that's all oh and then there's the response video that we're going to watch later

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:49.480
which is just fantastic that's what you can say so if you want to take ivermectin based

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.560
on the fact that in case that your problem that you're experiencing symptoms with

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.720
is because you have monkey kidney cells with fetal bovide serum and antibiotics

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.280
and viral transport medium breaking down in your body and you want to prevent it from breaking

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:10.200
down as quickly then you might have some rationale for taking ivermectin but in order to say that

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.520
you have to say that that is the problem with covid and i think you would have a damn hard time

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:23.080
proving that so the question then uh is uh so so that before i say that that is the entire basis

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:29.000
for the claim that ivermectin is an antiviral agent which is the basis for the claim that it's

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.440
an effective treatment or something called covid which is the basis for the claim that there was

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.040
some sort of conspiracy against the wonderful wonder drug safe and effective ivermectin so that

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.760
they could bring in a vaccine which is what you were sold when you decided to take ivermectin

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:50.840
by the health freedom community that's the story now some people will complain and comment and

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:56.280
criticize but i or my friend or my 20 friends they took ivermectin and they felt better

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.880
so how could you explain uh maryll nass was giving ivermectin that's part of her story right

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.640
in that well first of all that's uh that has nothing to do with the proof which i just went

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.160
through that ivermectin cannot possibly be an antiviral agent so that is independent we already

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:19.720
know that that's the case ivermectin has no relationship to anything to do with viruses nor does anything

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:26.360
else but you do have this observation see i hate that it's just not it's not nuanced enough and

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.880
it's getting people to not think it's turning people's brains off instead of making them

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.640
realize that in order for them to understand the lie there's still some work to be done

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:43.080
so how do you explain that well it turns out that ivermectin is a a interestingly and very toxic

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.440
to the nervous system this has been documented over and over again it's also functions shout

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:53.400
out to tim truth i think he's really been hammering this home and doing a good job of it i think

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:58.200
mark has also given him a little props for that shout out to tim as an anti-fertility agent

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:03.320
which may be one of the reasons why it's so widely used in africa it's also widely used in

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.920
animals i just found out yesterday that most horses and most dogs who are treated by conventional

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.760
vets uh take ivermectin basically once a month and there's lots of neurological problems including

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:20.360
seizure and disorientation and other neurological problems that come about through the continual

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.840
use of ivermectin so it is it is not a benign chemical that's what it is

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.160
being take make no mistake about that is a pharmaceutical made chemical just like many others

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:37.160
and it seems to have two effects one is it has a prednisone-like effect which means that i can

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:42.760
guarantee that anybody who has so-called flu-like type symptoms or symptoms which we associate with

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:48.360
covid which is basically an inflammatory response due to some sort of insult not a new disease by

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:54.520
any means but lots of people get inflammatory responses due to a wide variety of insults

01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:00.600
and if you take prednisone you will feel better you will also have made yourself dramatically worse

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.280
because all of these so-called flu-like or so-called covid-like or so-called detoxification

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.800
like symptoms are your body's way of doing a house cleaning and it's no secret that you can

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.320
stop those those house cleaning responses with strong pharmaceutical drugs and you will think

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:23.080
you feel better but actually now you've only stopped your body from doing its detoxification

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:30.040
house cleaning strategy and you will ultimately be a lot worse because that's how you heal so make

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.560
no mistake about it ivermectin stops the healing process oh i like that idea Brett Weinstein's

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:41.880
brain being affected by ivermectin is very good i like that pam that's wonderful just like prednisone

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:48.680
just like hydroxychloroquine just like giving you know monoclonal antibodies none of them work

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:54.840
with how we actually heal and another interesting i would say a hypothesis which i can't prove

01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.040
is that one of the ways that all of these drugs work is they stimulate the sympathetic nervous

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:05.400
system and it turns out that the healing response is basically a parasympathetic nervous system

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:10.920
response so when we're relaxed and we're not stressed and when our digestion is working

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.640
and when we're healing that is essentially in controlled by the parasympathetic nervous

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:20.760
system when you give somebody prednisone or hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin you stimulate

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:26.600
the sympathetic nervous system response which then stops the healing causes the nervous system

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:32.760
symptoms like seizures that you see with with ivermectin in particular and you you essentially

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:38.200
have stopped your body from healing and so that's how it works so the argument that aunt Fred or

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:43.240
uncle harry or whoever you felt better is no different you would be better off probably taking

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:48.120
high dose of prednisone if your only goal is to make yourself worse but feel better today i would

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:55.000
be interested to hear what somebody like perechory or maryll nass would respond to this argument because

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.680
i'm not an MD i defer to them when it comes to knowing how these drugs work because i don't know

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:06.920
how president prednisone works and so this is a very cool argument that i would love to see

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:13.000
fielded um to other mds what i'd also like to hear these mds comment about is high flow

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.280
pure nasal oxygen given to people in the hospital and how many symptoms could have

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:24.120
resulted from that i would like to know how many of these people have ever thought about

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:29.080
the use of these silly devices to make people decide to go to the hospital is actually also

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:35.640
part of the problem i wonder if if having these kinds of protocols in place could have fooled

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:40.040
people into believing that there was a novel symptomology present every once in a while

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.360
and that he could explain that to them so that they wouldn't just need to hear over and over

01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:52.280
again stories about viral isolation experiments being dumb because all the discussion of viral

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:56.760
isolation experiments being dumb still doesn't explain the bomb that went off in new york city

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:02.280
that was used to convince these people and er not these people but people in in australia and

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:08.920
new zealand that their lockdown worked the bomb going off in new york city and then going back

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:17.960
to baseline was used to explain to america that the lockdown worked and so we better get on with

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:24.440
explaining the lies that actually underlie this thing rather than just focusing over and over again

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:32.840
on isolation and how virology is an illusion because it is yes it is an exaggeration for sure

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:40.520
and a lot of them might even be lies but molecular biology is not a lie pcr and sequencing reactions

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:46.360
when done correctly are not lies they're very high precision molecular tools that when used

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:52.600
correctly give us great insight into what's present at in in preparations that we cannot

01:32:52.680 --> 01:33:06.520
otherwise measure but to say so little about how that technology could enable them to distort

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:13.000
already pre-existing signals into something that they are not but instead just say over and over

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.920
again something dumb simple like there are no viruses it's really it's really it's annoying

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:27.560
to me because it's not he's not teaching my children the truth he's giving them a dumb simple

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.080
explanation that will be dismissed by most people

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.400
that would be a good way to do it i just got a message saying that jessica hockett just recorded

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:46.760
a video with wolf gang wodock and vivian from um the coronavirus investigative committee in

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:53.240
germany which is very exciting i look forward to that video so i saying this because unfortunately

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.120
especially in the people who one would hope no better and think more deeply about this

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.880
they still buy the hydroxychloroquine ivermectin story this is a boondoggle for the pharmaceutical

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:10.680
industry especially in veterinary medicine and it is the only wonder draw wonderful part about

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.800
it is the wonder that anybody fell for this story we will at some point and hopefully i'll

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.320
have some other input on this get into even the question of does ivermectin even work for

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:25.880
so-called parasitic diseases whether they're even our parasitic diseases because all the

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:31.640
evidence points to that is not how it works and i even heard an anecdotal story of a description

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:37.320
of a of a study which i haven't seen so it's maybe unfair of me to mention this but it's a bit like

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:42.520
the maggots did the maggots kill the dog but they've interestingly take maggots are now used even

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.320
in conventional medicine to clean up wounds because maggots seem to have a good ability to

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:53.240
distinguish between dead and dying tissue and healthy tissue and they only eat the dead and dying

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.680
tissue leave the healthy tissue alone and that prevents quote infection because the other way to

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:03.720
do it is to have microorganisms like yeast and bacteria and parasites eat the dead and dying

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.800
tissue so if you get the maggots to do it then those other things have no food and you get a very

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:14.280
clean wound and so they did a uh investigation of who was better able to effectively debreed

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.600
a wound that means to take away the dead part and leave only the healthy living tissue

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:24.200
surgeons or maggots and i think it should be no surprise that the maggots won hands down even

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:30.920
with surgeons using microscopes um okay i was going to show you something about interesting

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.400
interesting i'm what they say about ivermectin on wikipedia they talk about how it works using

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:40.760
glutamine gated chlorine channels and that's how it uh increases the flow of chloride items and

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:45.800
hyperpolarizes the cell membrane paralyzed and killing the invertebrate uh it's safe for mammals

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:51.000
at normal therapeutic doses used to cure parasite infections because mammalian glutamate gated

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.960
chlorine channels only occur in the brain and spinal cord the causative causative ivermectin's

01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:01.160
usually do not cross the blood brain barrier and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:06.680
bind ligand gated channels so the problem with this of course is there are no channels in the

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:12.200
cell membranes or in nerves or in muscle cells and there is no blood brain barrier the nerves

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:18.280
don't work because of hyperpolarization and the flow of chloride ions so this whole thing is

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:26.520
simply just a story that has no holy shit okay so there there is again where i just i can't take

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:33.320
it i cannot take it because unfortunately ladies and gentlemen i'm a patch clamp physiologist

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:44.440
i descend from the the the i've actually had dinner with and a long conversation with burt

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:52.280
sacman the guy who got the nobel prize for investigating in and inventing uh the patch clamp

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.360
measurement and technique so that you could measure the voltage across a a plasma membrane

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:11.240
and if there's anything more beautiful than the electrochemical properties of a a lipid bilayer

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:18.440
and how amazing it is at that size scale that so much energy can be usefully harnessed

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.800
and how much we actually understand about it using real measurements back when old school

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:34.440
biology was old school biology he's discounting some of the most beautiful experiments that have

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:42.200
ever been done in biology including the squid axon experiments and what we understand about

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:50.360
myelination by saying that there is no blood brain barrier there is no ion channels that is

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:59.080
incredible that is absolutely incredible because the details of the biology that we understand

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:06.200
about ion channels and ligand gated ion channels is extraordinary i've measured in real time

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:15.960
flickering calcium activated potassium channels and then exposed them to calcium and seen the

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.400
amount of conductance from the inside into the outside of a cell sorry from the outside of the

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:30.360
inside of a cell increase 10 000 fold and then when i turned my own little knob to stop the

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.160
the flow of calcium i saw it go back down to flickering picohamps

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:45.080
the only thing we did was transfect HEK cells with the DNA that encoded a small conductance

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:51.400
potassium channel and expressed thousands of the same channel then we took that membrane

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:58.920
and we ripped it in half and had it across a very small glass opening so that nothing could flow

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:05.960
and we could measure that nothing was flowing and when we exposed that outside to calcium

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:12.600
those channels opened and there was electrical current carried by potassium flowing until we

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:19.160
removed the potassium and we could do it over and over and over again and these experiments have

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:26.040
been done over and over again with increasingly higher fidelity as we progress through the science

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:31.240
of biophysics and the science of of of these membranes

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.640
and so unlike virology which started out in the 40s

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:45.880
progressed to the 80s and then pretty much uses the exact same techniques they used in the 80s now

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.360
which is what he just explained a minute ago is bullshit that we're still using

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.040
psychopathic effects to indicate the presence of a virus is bullshit

01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:01.720
and so he's totally on top of it until suddenly he decides to throw out everything we know about

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:09.960
membrane physiology everything we know about protein subunit assembly we have actually

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:15.640
crystallized some proteins and we have actually accurately measured the function of some proteins

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:22.680
we have and to discount all of that science because some people have been lying about virology

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:36.440
for 40 years is the worst choice ever and again is he giving my kids anything or your kids anything

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.520
if he tells you that there's no blood brain barrier there are no ion channels there's no

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:46.600
ion flow how do we get to the point where we understand ourselves as Tesla wanted us to

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:52.200
understand ourselves as frequency and harmony if there aren't electrical signals that are flowing

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.720
in our neurons the hell is he talking about

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:07.320
what does he think the electricity of our body is if it is not the ionic conductances in the

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:13.800
electromagnetic forces that are created by the beauty of a lipid bilayer

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:21.560
what a crazy statement to make to somebody who has been a biophysicist for 25 years

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:27.000
wow he didn't make it to me but for me to hear that this is right in my wheelhouse i could talk

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.520
about this for four hours i could use only the data that i myself have made i could use the papers

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:38.520
that i've published to show you that ion channels work like that should we do it right now let's

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:43.800
just do that right now let's just stop right here let's go over here and i'm going to do it in real

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:48.440
time so you can see i'm not full of shit here we go let's go pub mad where the hell are you

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.960
let's go kui

01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:02.360
jj and one one hyphen will work enter there's my papers look at them all just you don't have to

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:09.080
worry because i'm the only jj kui in the list it's only one long list of papers that includes what

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:15.000
it what is it 19 results so i'm not a not some kind of big scientist you can see my whole track

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.440
records right there starting in 2002 where i had two papers with a guy who i really wish i could

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:27.480
see again collard huwamad um collard huwamad was a guy who took me in when i did not have a job i

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:35.320
just lost my my bartending position um because of being arrogant um and that was my only job i

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:42.360
had just quit teaching and i was kind of spiraling and uh he hired me um taught me to patch clamp

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.760
it was actually in the next door lab that um at the university of chicago that i met hybrid

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.440
mansfelder and when hybrid mansfelder was done with his postdoc he went back to the netherlands

01:42:54.440 --> 01:43:00.040
where he started as a ten-year track professor and he came back to the university of chicago and

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:06.280
gave a talk to say goodbye and uh i said yeah it's really cool i'm glad you i'm sorry you're leaving

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.000
or whatever um and he said why don't you come to the netherlands it'd be my first phd student i was

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.880
like huh what don't tease me man this was in 2001 i said don't tease me man i will i will leave in a

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.840
month and he said i'm not teasing you let's fly you out there next month and you can do an interview

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:29.960
and then you can decide and so i did that in october i i flew for an interview in november

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:37.080
17th 2002 i moved to the netherlands to do my phd with hybrid mansfelder who i again i met at

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:43.800
the university of chicago has a research technician working for collard hohamad and uh with yinjin

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:51.800
and uh and and john drexler who's also still a long lost friend of mine who i uh i miss a lot

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:57.960
um this is where i really realized what biology was all about and how people get in it together

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:04.600
and work hard together um and and put their ideas on the line together and this was a really great

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:11.560
team um yinjin who was an extremely skilled experimentalist who helped me to understand

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:17.400
how to use the equipment and and how to do it well and also showed me what eight hours a day looks

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.120
like when you're a scientist it's actually 10 or 12 and how focused you have to be when the

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.920
experiments are working you just got to stay um and so i learned a lot from working with yinjin

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.520
i also worked learned a lot from working with john because he was our molecular biologist he did

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:39.320
all the transfections was doing all of the the cell culture and so the the experimental

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:45.480
preparation that i was working on was essentially curated by uh collard and by john and so i did

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:52.840
the recordings and and yinjin did the recordings um and so in this paper uh let's let's do this one

01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:00.520
um this is the first paper that i published where's the other one there's there's a giant patch

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:07.480
paper two where's oh next what no where's the giant patch paper

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.880
oh there it is way up here uh that's 2002 oh it's not an order i see sorry i thought

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.920
that was as an order so i went down to the bottom display options should be not summary

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:31.560
best batch no it should be publication date there we go so the most recent one came out that's nice

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:38.840
i'm really impressed that they actually did this my old boss is is brian hooks there that's the guy

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:44.920
at the university of pittsburgh who um asked me to not come in anymore um and he was actually

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:52.360
wearing three masks when fauci told us to wear two um and uh kaffrin rough um this is a really

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:57.400
great scientist at the university of pittsburgh got a really neat idea about how neurons could be

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.760
neurovascularly coupled and how um interneurons might regulate regulate that coupling

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.120
and so i did some experiments with her on some of her knockout mice before i left there and some

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.240
of her uh some of the experimental preparation to try and show that this was indeed the case

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:18.600
they were really fun experiments to do she was really a fun person to work with and so i suspect

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.000
actually it was her that had the integrity to include me on this paper because i think if it

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.840
was his choice he would not include me because they published um my data they mac hooks but i

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:39.400
show you brian if i go here and then uh and then it loads and then i go on brian hooks um what you

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:46.840
will see is that they published um my my data right here and i'm not even on it so this bio archive

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:53.320
pre-print right here is almost all my data um or maybe it's not that one which one is it's this

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:59.400
one sorry this one so sandra is somebody who did a lot of my mouse work um and she was a technician

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:06.760
in our lab um and then this uh roman he's a guy who came after i was in the lab um i never really

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:13.400
got along with him um at some point i just was fed up uh and uh gotten a shouting match with him

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:20.120
during the pandemic um but this is the guy who supposedly finished the rest of the recordings

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.920
but if you look at this paper um almost all the data in it is mine and i'm only in the

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:31.720
acknowledgments as doing the experiments that's pretty that's pretty shitty um that's extraordinarily

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:38.840
shitty from the perspective of brian hooks who i consider to be really uh one of the worst people

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:43.560
that i know in pittsburgh if i saw him on the street i think he would actually turn around and

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:49.000
walk fast the other way that's how little class or integrity he actually has and interestingly

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:57.480
enough he were he was in the united states navy um for 20 years as a submarine uh first lieutenant

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:05.320
and became captain after he kind of retired um married a chinese woman um while a postdoc and

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:12.280
she took a job um with mckenzie um at the start of the pandemic which is kind of interesting after

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:20.280
her postdoc at the university of pittsburgh kind of failed and so we have a 20 year navy guy that

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.640
i was working for at the university of pittsburgh with a wife who took a job at the at mckenzie

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.560
complaining to i guess the head of the department that i shouldn't be there anymore and then ending

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.600
my neuroscience career not only that but then not publishing the data that got him

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.080
his own god dang arrow one is all my data the reason why he has funding in his lab is because

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:47.560
of my data then when he published the paper he didn't even include my name on it thank goodness

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:55.240
somebody like kathryn ruff and somebody like like where is sarah ross the other p.i from pitt

01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:00.840
probably had the integrity to include me on the paper even though you look at this paper and my

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.240
experiments are probably only one figure whereas in this paper they might be five

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.400
what's jessica ross's story that sounds like this one

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.160
what's matt crawford's story that sounds like this one

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.680
what's robert melone's story that sounds like this one oh wait no robert melone was working

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:37.400
on domain program in 2020 not losing his job a 20 year career in something completely different

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:42.360
for speaking out about the biology that every one of these frickin people including all these

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.280
authors should have known because we all use transfection every day

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.960
and all of these people are sophisticated enough to know that the bullshit that that guy just said

01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.080
about there being no ion channels and no brain blood brain barrier and all this

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:07.080
they're sophisticated enough to know that's bullshit but they're not sophisticated enough to

01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:12.920
know that transfection called an investigational vaccine is bullshit they're not sophisticated enough

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:18.760
to know that r&a can't pandemic well that's outside of my expertise

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:28.120
but tom kauen gives them a real easy ball on a tee to say well obviously this guy doesn't know what he's talking about

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:36.920
clink and so what goes out of the park with that it goes out of the park is the the objection to basic virology

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:46.360
do you see how malevolent that could be if this is done on purpose rather than just unwittingly

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.640
awkward and and and clumsy naively clumsy

01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:01.640
i've actually touched these experiments ladies and gentlemen did i just delete that close that

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:06.440
window to get this back darn it i didn't actually show you the paper so let's go back to that again

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:11.240
i need history and this one is that one

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.960
come on here we go i'm going to put it back over here sorry about that

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:24.440
this is my story as told on pub mad we put publication date we go down to the bottom

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.680
and the second to the last paper is this giant patch recordings

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.280
i'm very proud of this paper because it took a lot of my own

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:38.840
dog on it okay i got to do this over here so you can't see my passwords

01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:43.720
uh okay confirm your institution seriously

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:56.520
and then my phone is going to beep if there's anything that i hate more than

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:03.640
then six factor identification and passwords i can't really know what else it would be

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:05.800
there we go

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:11.560
okay so here we go bringing this back over we're going to view the pdf

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.240
Devin Ryan is a student that we had in the lab john Glover is a student we had in the lab

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:21.640
i taught them both the patch clamp Devin Ryan went and did his PhD in Germany somewhere and

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:27.080
contacted me when i was still in Holland um Joseph Young is interestingly enough a

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:35.400
PhD uh physicist who actually worked with us um for some of our analysis and actually

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:40.920
Joseph Young is so cool because you know what he worked on he had this apparatus that would

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:48.840
compress water into such a small container that it would glow like uh the what what seems to happen

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:53.960
with these shrimp when they can move their claws so fast that they create like a spark of light

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:58.840
in the in the i don't know if it's their claws or their tail they create a spark of light in salt

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:03.960
water he was actually working on how you compress light with a laser or some other shit i'd have

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:09.480
to send him an email again um to create that light and how that light is generated which i think

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:15.400
is still a very interesting phenomenon that could have some a ram big ramifications for our

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:21.240
understanding of of the world that we don't yet get how that works um anyway Joseph Young

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:26.040
another really cool person that i met at the University of Chicago so here's this paper and

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.200
what we're doing is we're taking glass electrodes that are already very small and we're going to

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:36.440
make them much larger and that i use this apparatus underneath the microscope which is detailed here

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:43.800
so that i can perfuse across this end and then what i did was and this was all pretty much relearned

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:47.720
by looking at other people's papers and then trying to replicate what they described

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:53.000
i created these pipettes under a microscope with my own hands and with own manipulators

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.720
and and heat so a wire that was very close to it that could heat it and then i could break it

01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:03.240
and shape it and then polish it and then i would take individual human embryonic kidney cells

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:09.240
which were expressing only one kind of potassium channel because that's what they were transfected

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:14.760
by john drexler and i would use suction so that's what was also cool

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.400
the one little contribution that i did in my

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:30.280
in my career and one little thing that i'm very proud of which actually has no it's not very special

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:36.120
but it really helped me a lot um part of what i learned at the University of Chicago with regard

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:41.320
to patch clamp is that the creation of the seal and that's where giga ohm biological comes from

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:47.000
giga ohm is the measurement of the the resistance of the seal that gets created

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:56.200
when you suck a lipid bilayer onto the end of a glass pipette and it extrudes all the water so

01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.000
let me just draw a little picture here for you so that we i can give you an idea of what we think

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.760
is happening here what we think is happening here this is sidebar is that the electrode

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:12.360
and the cell membrane if we were to look right here where they come together if we were to look

01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:20.040
right there and and magnify it a little bit what we actually see is the pipette and then we see

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:27.480
the lipid bilayer and what's imagined we don't know if this happens but this is what of what

01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:34.040
physicists have hypothesized is happening is that when a giga ohm seal happens

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:41.320
it is because of the positive charge of the lipid nanoparticle a lipid lipid bilayer

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:47.720
and the borosilicate glass so we use borosilicate glass because when you put it in water it actually

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:55.160
becomes charged and so what this creates is a charge bias here and water can actually get

01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:02.360
excluded it's like pushed out and once all the water is gone that means there's no space in here

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:08.280
and that means that no current can flow so no matter how much what we have is then a cell

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:16.520
and it's in a bath and down here in the bath is one wire right this is like one positive wire and

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:21.880
then we have another wire that's inside of the glass pipette which glass doesn't conduct electricity

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:28.840
and so no matter what voltage i put across this this lipid bilayer nothing flows there's no current

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:36.440
and so if i look at look at this paper what you see here at the top um oh i don't i can't point

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:43.960
with my pen when i'm on this screen um what you see here at the top is a when there's no calcium

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:51.000
present essentially when i try to push stuff through i get nothing to go through and the scale

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.800
here is two nano amps i think it might even be 10 nano amps which has a gigantic amount of current

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:05.560
that's like uh i think that's let's see if it's nano amps yeah one nano amp so that's very big

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:11.880
typically speaking when we talk about a single ion channel we talk about picot amps and so then

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.320
we go up to nano amps so this is a thousand times it's tens of thousands of channels here

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:22.120
essentially because it might be three or four picot amps that are are going through an individual

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:30.120
channel and when i expose the the patch to calcium at different voltages we see all kinds of different

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:37.240
conductances that we can predict mathematically depending on the concentration of potassium

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:44.760
outside and inside the pipette because we are in complete control of that we control the calcium

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.840
of the potassium that's in the cell we already know and we already know what we put in here

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:55.720
because i filled the pipette and so i control the potassium here and i control the potassium here

01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:03.080
and mathematically this these curves and this conductance describes the biophysics of the

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:10.600
potassium channel as it opens in response to calcium as the conductance occurs and then wanes

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:17.480
as the proteins slowly close because of the nature of how they work they don't stay open but they flicker

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.600
and the flickering is greatest at the beginning and then the flickering goes away so if you could

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:28.280
see the individual channels here it would be much like a pixelated staircase it's not a smooth curve

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:34.040
it only becomes a smooth curve because collid and john have found a way to express only one type

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:40.200
of channel in this cell so that we can start the biophysics of this one channel of which hundreds

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:47.400
of thousands perhaps different types of channels are expressed in any neuron and so it's very unfortunate

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:53.560
that he would make such a statement because it's really completely and totally untrue and the worst

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.920
part is is that it becomes this thing that any academic biologist who might have been tempted

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:03.960
by the first part of this discussion where it's like oh really they don't and they don't

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:10.120
isolate as much as i thought oh that's cool they actually are completely discounting that

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.640
thank you very much completely discounting that argument now

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:18.680
because he says the ridiculous thing is that there are let's just listen to it again to make

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:25.240
sure i get the whole list right a side panel panels so the problem with this of course is there

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:30.280
are no channels in the cell membranes or in nerves or in muscle cells and there is no blood brain

01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:36.600
barrier the nerves don't work because of hyperpolar polarization and the flow of chloride ions

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:42.040
so this whole thing is simply just a story that has see what's crazy about this is we know that

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:49.720
nicotine is especially poisonous to to insects because they use acetylcholine gated channels as

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:57.080
their primary channel suite in their in their nervous system we have nicotinic channels but we

01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:03.560
don't rely primarily on them to conduct nerve impulses therefore nicotine has other effects

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:12.680
and so it wouldn't be ridiculous for a chloride channel based agonist or antagonist to have an

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:18.760
effect on parasites which use chloride channels in ways that we don't and for him to discount this

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.320
possibility by simply saying that there are no ion channels there are no neurons there are

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:30.040
no electricity there's no ion flow actually discards this and it discards this

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:40.520
and i'm sorry ladies and gentlemen but i did these experiments with my bare hands okay i might

02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:45.160
be mistaken about what happened but i would sure like an explanation for what i did for these three

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:51.640
years what i was doing and why it was that until i figured out how to make the pipette shape correct

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:56.280
until i figured out how to coat it with the right wax and until i figured out how to

02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:02.360
use a device which i was going to show you a minute ago to to find control the air pressure

02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:09.880
so that i could make that giga ohm seal without damaging the cell look at these traces

02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.480
this is multiple nano amps now i'm sure about this one because i remember this was a really

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:23.080
big one um scale bars five nano amps we're talking about tens of thousands of the exact

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:28.520
same kind of channel here and giving us a measurement with no you can't even see the

02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:34.520
error bars because they're so perfect this is real the air bars are just lost in tiny inside

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:39.800
of those little tiny signals this is some of the most high fidelity biophysical measurements that

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:46.440
have ever been made on earth bar none and that's me tooting my own horn before i even had my phd

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:51.720
this was when i was a technician i had just gotten kicked out of a bartending gig and one year later

02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:59.240
i was doing this thanks to colin huwamad and yinjin chao and john drexler and none of this is bullshit

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:06.120
all of this is real biophysics and so to say that there are no ion channels is really ridiculous

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:12.200
and it undermines his very real position that there might not be high fidelity coronavirus is

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:17.800
like they told us don't you see how magically malevolent it could be if he knows he's doing this

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.760
and if he doesn't know he's doing it we better get him to correct it quick snow value

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.080
okay it's enough about ivermectin again for anybody who really wants to see the references

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:34.680
and get more in detail in this please watch sam and marx video i think it's dr sambailey.com

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.440
this week on ivermectin so let's get to some of the questions

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:45.400
what have you seen work for poison ivy elimination treatment comfort it's the um

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:53.640
the thing is really quite simple right what we used to control the air when we patch clamp was

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:59.960
a syringe or even actually if you go to universities now the reality is is that most people will

02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.720
still be using their mouth so they use their mouth and they used to suck on a on a hose or

02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:13.000
blow on a hose to create and let me just explain it when you do the experiment that i just oh i'll

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.960
do it like this because i have the the picture is there at least i hope it's still there yeah so

02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:25.960
um when you do this experiment um what you do is you you use air pressure

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.720
to control the cell so this cell has been dissociated it's not stuck to the glass here it's

02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:37.640
actually rolling around and so by controlling the flow the air pressure inside of this pipette

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:42.600
which is filled with water but if you put pressure on it it will blow out and if you suck on it it

02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:48.760
will start to suck in from the bath and because this is microscopic it's not like the pipette's

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:53.560
gonna fill up with water anytime soon or it's not like the pipette will exit and empty with water

02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:58.680
pretty soon but the problem was is that all these patch clamp physiologists when i was getting

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:04.600
taught none of them absolutely none of them and i shit you not none of them were doing anything

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.480
but they're god dang mouths they had a hose and it was connected to the back of the manipulator

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.320
that was holding the pipette and then they had the hose and they would blow into it and then they

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.400
would could they would turn a valve and then whatever pressure was in there was what they were

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:22.360
using to blow then they would approach the cell and they would open that valve and then it would

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:29.240
start to suck and the cell would roll in or the membrane would get get would touch the glass

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:35.880
but what i learned from doing this giant patch experiment was was that the differential between

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:42.680
the pull and push of that positive pressure really dictated whether you would get a very good seal

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:46.760
or whether the seal would be kind of shitty now the other thing that's really interesting that

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:52.040
you'll probably like uh is a little note to understand is that when you're making a recording

02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:57.080
from a neuron like i used to do all the time there was a real art to it in the sense of you

02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:03.640
would get next to the neuron and you would have this position right here now this position is

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:09.880
not wholesale yet you have to break this membrane here so that this and this are the same and that

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:14.600
your electrode that's in your glass pipette is actually inside the neuron that's what's so cool

02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:21.080
about patch clamp physiology now in breaking this membrane it actually becomes very important

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:27.560
whether the membrane looks like that or whether the membrane looks like this where this isn't

02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:35.640
there so i guess i should just draw it again down here and what i realized very early on in my work

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:41.720
with with collard is that the control of the air pressure by your mouth often resulted in

02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:46.920
like this which meant that when you tried to break this open so that you were making a recording

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:52.280
here a lot of this shit would actually be in the way and more importantly it would get in the way

02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:57.160
during the experiment and your your fidelity of recording would go up and down because there

02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:03.640
was stuff in the tip of your pipette so after a couple years of working with collard i had gone

02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:13.480
through from from syringe to machining myself this thing that i could hook up to the air hose

02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:20.120
and when i turned this of course it's moving out so it's a very subtle control of the airflow and

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:25.080
then i added this valve on the top so that when i opened it when i pushed this button i could go

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:32.600
to neutral and so neutral suction like air pressure turns out to be the best way to form the gigaseal

02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:35.800
but most people couldn't get there because they were using their mouth so they were going

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.080
sucking right away and they would get this bottom configuration here instead of something that looks

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:46.680
very clean like this one and i i over time figured out how to do it right and everybody

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:51.160
that's worked with me or learned from me has started to use a device to control their air pressure

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:55.960
rather than their mouth because their mouth is just stupid but lots of people use their mouth

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.720
because that's how they're taught and that's what happens in biology you do it how you're taught

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:05.080
so again we're off on a tangent here but the tangent is a very good one because

02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:11.320
tom kawen brought us to this tangent i just can't believe that he said that i can't believe he said

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:15.320
it so i'm going to say it one more time and then we're going to go on to this let's eat poison ivy

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:20.200
so that we don't get poison ivy anymore hold up it's tough question let's just say i'm in principal value

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000
the source and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand buying ligand gated channels

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:31.720
so the problem with this of course is there are no channels in the cell membranes or in nerves or

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:38.200
in muscle cells there is no blood brain barrier the nerves don't work because of hyperpolarization

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:44.120
and the flow of chloride ions so this whole thing is simply just a story that has no value

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:51.160
okay enough about ivermectin again for anybody who will control for the calcium channel is

02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:56.680
the calcium so i'll show you again just because i i want to risk i like the fact that you're asking

02:07:56.680 --> 02:08:04.200
about it so in in a here this is when no calcium is present there's no current right this is like

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:09.560
the zero line it's just staying there so you can see me turn on the current but there's really

02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:13.720
nothing flowing it's just kind of leak and then you see when i turn off the current you see a

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:18.520
little leak in the other way but when i have this is what i do this is what you don't see i

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:24.440
shouldn't show you this so here's the cell i roll it in with air pressure it makes a giga ohm

02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:32.920
seal and then i used a second pipette with heavy suction and i went like this and i tore the cell

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:40.040
off so what's left here is not an open membrane but it's that half of the cell so this is called

02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:45.880
an inside out patch or an outside out patch it's a very niche skill that not very many people ever

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.480
bothered to try and learn how to do and college challenged me and i figured it out

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:56.680
but what you're doing is you're making a seal on the on the cell like this and then you used a

02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:07.000
second pipette that's sucking and then you move it past very quickly and it removes this part of

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.320
the cell and then what you're left with is this patch which has potassium channels in it

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:21.880
and so in the control experiment there's no i put it in front then i take this i take sorry

02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:26.920
i take this pipette which i've now created by removing the outside of the cell i take this pipette

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.280
and i put it in front of this gigantic tube so this is this pipette but now at a lower magnification

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:42.840
and this tube is is connected to a bunch of of reservoirs that i control with a valve

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:49.800
with with electronic solenoid valves and so i'm blowing whatever i want to blow

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:56.280
i'm blowing with this huge pipette i'm blowing on this channel whatever i want to do it

02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:03.000
and so i can control the potassium i can control the sodium and i can control the calcium and

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.080
whether calcium is present or not and over here i've got a lot of potassium

02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:15.000
over here i have almost no potassium and so if these are potassium channels and they open then

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:21.080
the potassium will flow from the high concentration to the low there should be a huge flow of potassium

02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:26.440
when these channels are open and these channels according to their physiology only open when

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:32.920
calcium is present so i would start by perfusing a no calcium solution

02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:40.920
with low potassium and you would see this which is no current and then when i would switch the valve

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:48.520
and and chlori sorry calcium would be present then i would get this nano amp of potassium current

02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:53.160
and we could show it's potassium because you can block it with potassium channel blockers

02:10:53.160 --> 02:11:00.520
because we can change the potassium concentration and in real time and show that mathematically

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:09.160
speaking the the driving force in the Nernst equation as calculated by the the the potassium

02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:14.680
concentrations that we ourselves have created on the inside and the outside of that patch correspond

02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:20.120
mathematically to the prediction of the Nernst equation that's very hard to dispute that these

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:27.240
are doing what we say they're doing and it's not just me of course there's a couple generations

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:32.840
of biophysicists that have been working on trying to get at the heart of how these channels work

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:38.920
using any kind of this is a preparation that very few if any other people have ever used i don't know

02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:45.160
if you can find another paper where someone used recombinant sk channels in human embryonic kidney

02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:51.000
cells in giant patch recordings to show the bio membrane the sorry the biophysics of potassium

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.600
channel this might be the only time anyone tried to test it at this fidelity when we did it

02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:01.400
the results were beautiful the people at the biophysics conference were like holy shit

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:08.360
where did you find this technician and call it had to answer i got him with a with a classified

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:15.160
ad because i really did apply or respond to a classified ad in the chicago tribune in order to

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:26.440
meet this guy anyway let's go on wants to see the references and get more in detail in this

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:31.880
please watch sam and marx video i think it's doctor sambailey.com this week on ivermectin

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:38.200
so let's get to some of the questions what have you seen work for poison ivy elimination treatment

02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:44.840
comfort it's a tough question poison ivy is tough so it's we're told it's through the

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:50.360
the contact on the skin of a chemical they're called urushial i'm not sure how to spell that

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:57.880
and this chemical gets absorbed through the skin and then can go into your bloodstream we're told

02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.920
and then you have systemic poison ivy so there's definitely a difference the difference is if the

02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.880
original exposure and all the symptoms are contiguous with that exposure in other words

02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:13.000
not on one arm and then the other arm and the other arm didn't have exposure so if everything

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.880
is on one arm that's still localized poison ivy and if it spreads to someplace that it's not

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.200
contiguous with then it apparently must have got there through the blood or the lymph

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:27.720
so that's called systemic poison ivy so the things that i have used and seen for that some

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:34.200
of them i've used and some of them i've only heard of uh there there is a a a over-the-counter

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:41.720
stuff called zinfel i think or something you'll you'll see it starts with a zin and it's a

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:46.600
it's apparently a chemical that breaks down the urushial and so it's not a bad idea to if you know

02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:51.640
that you've been exposed to poison ivy and you tend to react strongly to it i mean this again

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:57.000
anything that's coming out to your skin it's basically the plant world is serving as the vehicle to

02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.360
help you create an elimination reaction so the skin eruption and the itching and the

02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:07.720
the pus and the vesicles that is the body's way of getting this stuff out but you can also temper

02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:12.280
you can also break down the chemical by rubbing your body in the area that was exposed with this

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:16.440
over-the-counter thing i'm sure you'll be able to find out what it was and that breaks down the

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:22.440
urushial and then it stops uh your body will stop reacting so that's the first thing there's also

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.840
some plants uh that people have used and i'm not an expert on this i think they're called

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:32.120
julweed and maybe plantain and so you can chew those or make a paste and rub that over the

02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:36.520
area where you've been exposed and i believe you can even eat those although i would check on that

02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:42.840
and that apparently will stop the symptoms uh quickly in in many people so that's the second

02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:49.480
thing that i've seen and done uh the thing that i've heard that works is to actually take some of

02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:54.120
your own urine that you actually make an antidote and you can make a compress with that and put it

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.680
on the affected skin and then you can drink it which contains the antidote to the poison ivy

02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:03.640
and that apparently will make the symptoms and even a systemic problem go away very quickly

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:09.080
i've also seen good results sometimes not all the time by taking homeopathic cell salts i'm not

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:15.640
sure which one to use for that but also to take just homeopathic roostox which can help make the

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:21.320
symptoms go away quicker so those are the basic things that i've seen i've also seen people uh eat

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:25.320
a little bit of poison ivy and apparently the native american people did that in the early part

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:30.520
of the season before the heavy part of the poison ivy season or poison oak season and apparently by

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:37.080
eating it then your body develops resistance somehow to poison ivy exposure i've never done

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:42.280
that myself but i've heard that that works so if anybody else has any effective poison

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:48.040
boy i think poison eating poison ivy sounds like a very very bad idea but uh you know

02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:53.480
go with what you go with ivy treatments i would like to hear them so you can send those in the

02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:58.760
comments okay uh tom in your fantastic book cancer and new biology of water you mentioned

02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.480
luis curve ran who among others showed that in living beings cosmic background radiation

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:08.520
is sufficient to change elements into other elements it's loud um okay i don't know that he said

02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:14.120
that cosmic background radiation it's the radiation or the energy flow in living beings that changes

02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:18.200
elements into other elements so i'm not sure he said cosmic background radiation but i know what

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:23.560
you mean your idea that a dome with antenna and pillars in water in a cell or in the tajma hall

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:27.960
are the receiver of energy aligns with these findings are we here at the source of the secret

02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.600
of life i would only say that we're getting towards it what we're realizing is that the usual

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:41.000
a biochemical reductionist materialistic model of everything but in particular life

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:47.720
is severely lacking and that we are bio energetic electrical electromagnetic beings that have

02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:53.960
no ion channels that use ions and don't use electromagnetism at all apparently i don't

02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:59.480
know what he's talking about here i think this is clear obfuscation of the truth

02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.200
not for one second am i going to say that we understand everything about the brain but

02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:09.640
what little we understand we do understand that the symphony of electrical signals

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:15.000
has at least partially conducted by proteins which can selectively gate

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.480
ionic conductances and we've done these experiments enough to know it that that we know

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:25.720
and that's what's the frustrating thing about the world that we're in right now

02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:30.360
we actually have been we're being led off of a cliff where we think we know nothing

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:36.360
that the free will doesn't exist and that that everything you know is wrong into a certain

02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:42.360
extent it's true but all of our biological observations don't need to be thrown out all of

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:51.240
our biologists aren't completely wrong they have formed their ideas sometimes in the maladaptive

02:17:51.320 --> 02:18:01.320
context or the bonsai the bonsai pot of reductionist science that has caused us to

02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:06.440
miss a lot of these big ideas caused us to lose sight of the sacred and the irreducible

02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:12.920
complexities that really are at the heart of our love of biology and our appreciation for it i

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:20.360
totally agree but to say that we know nothing that some of the things that we know are useless

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:23.400
when we know when that's certainly not the case

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:31.320
is exactly the trick here there is no way impossible there's no way you're ever going to

02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:38.440
get me to believe that and accept that biophysics is on the same level of shaky ground that

02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:45.160
molecular virology is that is just ridiculous we could be wrong about a lot of things we could

02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:54.760
have oversimplified a lot of things but the forces and the sources of flow and charge

02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:01.240
and our basic understanding of the biophysics of the lipid bio the lipid

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:09.240
bilayer is crucial ladies and gentlemen can you can you just follow along for a minute here

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:16.200
can you just try to follow along for a minute impromptu lecture here lipid

02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:23.960
bilayer is an incredible thing that for whatever reason all life on earth that's any worth any

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:32.600
complication at all is made up and what's so cool about the lipid bilayer is that that that ions

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:38.360
can't go across it that stuff can't go across it but electromagnetism can't

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:46.760
and so the concentration of potassium inside and outside matters and when it's different

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:53.480
there is an electrochemical force that exists across this lipid bilayer because of its narrowness

02:19:54.360 --> 02:20:00.600
if the lipid bilayer was five times as thick the electromagnetic forces that it could contain

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:06.760
and and the potential that could exist across it would be very much reduced because these

02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:11.960
little magnets couldn't and their little concentration gradients couldn't affect each other as well

02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:21.560
and so isn't it brilliant that life has come up with with with protein shapes that can create

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:28.760
cat ionic binding sites and ionic binding sites inside of them that that

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:38.680
give them the selectivity for a particular ionic species so that potassium a thousand times more

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:44.520
than sodium for example will go through a particular channel and that's that potassium or sodium will

02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:50.280
go through a different channel at the same ratio a thousand to one or ten thousand to one and

02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:56.760
the properties of the assembly of these subunits we've identified some of the key amino acids that

02:20:57.720 --> 02:21:03.720
provide these ionic gates and we've looked at the change in their orientation as they gate

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:09.240
and we may not we may not have a perfect understanding of how all these things work

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:17.480
but we do have a very basic understanding of why at this size scale water is so freaking cool

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:23.800
and we do have an interesting understanding of why at this size scale ionic concentrations

02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:30.440
can exert electrochemical forces across this barrier but the useful concentration on one side

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:39.000
or the other won't change if a few ions flow because the volume outside of a cell is your whole

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:44.600
body and the volume on the inside of the cell is just the inside of the cell so if the inside of

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:51.480
the cell is a highly controlled environment then very carefully orchestrated electrochemical

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:59.080
gradients can be used to create can be used to power and can be used to energize and metabolize

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:07.880
and he's suggesting that all of this understanding is irrelevant to to us being electrochemical

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.120
beings or something like that

02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:17.800
ladies and gentlemen i'm sorry but i can't help but come to the conclusion that this guy

02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:23.800
really doesn't know what he's talking about and some for some reason or another is so arrogant

02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:30.200
that um hasn't bothered to understand that there could be people lying about stuff and other people

02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:36.440
are not lying about stuff maybe just miss miss understanding the fidelity with which they understand

02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:45.480
it and that a no virus position or a no blood brain barrier or a no ion channels or a no electrical

02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:52.520
impulses stance on how the body works is not really compatible with what he just said of some

02:22:52.520 --> 02:23:00.040
sorts everything but in particular life is severely lacking and that we are bio energetic

02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:05.560
electrical electromagnetic beings of some sort have you ever thought about the possibility that

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:11.720
that putting biophysicists and pigeonholing them into neuroscience in a few other places

02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:18.680
has hampered our ability to understand the role that electromagnetism and electrochemical forces

02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:25.400
have in our metabolism has kept us away from understanding how toxins in our environment could

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:33.240
affect our neurochemical metabolism and so they keep these people focused on ion channels of

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:38.920
one particular type so that they never realized that wow this is really a big broad biology that

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:44.760
we should be advocating for the you know this is part of the sacred biology no instead

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.160
they're all at the biophysics conference they're never talking about things unless there's a

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:56.760
particular genetic disease related to their particular channel and so is he presenting some

02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:03.560
useful solution to try and reconcile what these people have observed with what these people have

02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:07.720
lied about observing so that we can all come to a collective understanding of where we are

02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:14.920
and steady's offering very dumb simple explanations for why these people are wrong

02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:23.640
three generations of biophysicists are all wrong about proteins and membranes and all

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:28.200
wrong about electrochemical gradients that go through ion channels and all wrong about

02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:33.800
how action potentials are generated even though we have 30 years of consistent observation of

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.840
these phenomenon that have never contradicted each other

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:44.440
unlike virology which he's totally right about do you see what i'm saying unlike virology which

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:51.320
he's totally right about that haven't advanced in their methodologies at all haven't tried to test

02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:57.160
their presumptions at all whereas biophysicists and protein ion channel people have been trying

02:24:57.160 --> 02:24:59.960
to test their presupposition since the start of their work

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:08.040
i think it's a good place to stop right now we're at 220 i don't want to i don't want to take too

02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:13.480
long i will cover the other video which is right here i'm going to show you it in case you want to

02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:19.560
watch it earlier um it is on rumble it is called at least on this link it is called Dr. Cowan Dr.

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:25.480
Kaufman Dr. Bailey and more why contagious viruses don't exist and then very interestingly here

02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:31.480
in the chat or in the in the description it says yet another scientist this time jj kui

02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.640
makes the claim that contagious viruses exist while knocking the terrain theory claim which

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.360
says they don't but as per usual the people have put a great deal of time into research

02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:44.760
and research to show there are no such thing as contagious virus handily puts this scientist

02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:50.040
in his place and so it's actually the four of them the five of them that all respond and they're

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.680
actually responding sorry i'm talking to the camera you can't see me they're actually responding

02:25:54.760 --> 02:26:00.680
to my um the email that i wrote on behalf of chd at this time so this is from a year ago

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:06.600
we will watch this um and you can see it right down here the comments are very obvious right uh

02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.320
how is he not right when dr. david martin has proven the origin of this new virus huh

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:18.520
after the first segment's obvious this is a hispiet piece and i'm surprised that Andy Kaufman

02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:23.320
involvement so what's interesting about that is i think that at least my impression is the

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:29.480
Andy Kaufman might be the most the person who i have the most skepticism for because he number one

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:34.600
kind of steps in front of the breggans as a psychiatrist supposedly speaking out against

02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:40.280
psychiatry and then he also steps in front of a lot of these no-virus people and i have a picture of

02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:47.720
him shaking andrew komo's hand in 2019 for a grant that he got for making biosurveillance devices for

02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:53.880
prison populations in new york city so if anybody is connected to the shitheads who did this to us

02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:59.080
in new york city it would be Andy Kaufman and the other flag for Andy Kaufman for me is that the

02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.280
first person i ever heard his name from was none other than kevin mccaren in march of 2020 and you

02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:11.800
know all i feel about about that fella um i mean these are all team worst case scenario members and

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:17.640
so i i suspected at least one or more of these were co-opted at some point to be part of the

02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:23.720
worst case scenario narrative and and they may be all in on it at this stage all in on the idea of

02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:29.640
making sure we don't get to the finish line early enough to make a difference and that's why their

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:35.000
narrative will slowly change that's why kevin mccaren and charles rixie a year ago or six months

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.560
ago on matt crawford show said that yeah of course it's clones but now they want to you to believe

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:46.360
that clones can spread that r&a can spread all it wants if you put the right sequences in there

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.560
which turns out to be the same dumb story they were saying in 2020 already but just morphed a

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:57.480
little bit to accept some of the biology that i've exposed and to kind of absorb it again to step in

02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:04.200
front and they're all going to do it it's going to continue until we finally get to a critical

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:12.120
mass of people like mike eden nick hudson jessica hawkin mark kulak and myself and that all understand

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:18.920
that this was one great big lie and it's a lie based on an ongoing deception that started much

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:24.760
earlier about r&a viruses and how much fidelity r&a virology has or doesn't have

02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:33.080
how much these proxies of pcr's are actually indication of anything real is up for debate and

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.880
i agree totally with these people about that the once they say there are no ion channels in that

02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:42.840
we don't understand anything but we're electrovings it just doesn't make any sense to me anymore

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.600
when they start giving credit to people who freeze water and capture images of emotion in the water

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:55.560
it doesn't really hold hold it just doesn't work and if you have somebody who's focused on foyas

02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:01.880
for five years and and foying police departments for whether they have any evidence of isolating a

02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:09.480
virus that's just ridiculous and so me calling out foyas as being ridiculous was a reason to

02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.880
hate on me me saying that there might be a way for all of us to be right because infectious

02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:19.720
clones are a methodology was a reason to hate on me and now we're in 2024 and we're still not

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:25.160
really making any progress even though i've fully admitted that i was bamboozled for two years and

02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:30.040
i've apologized for it and admitted that i've even lost friends because i didn't get my head out fast

02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:36.520
enough and the only thing that anybody can do is ignore this stream because that's all they've got

02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:42.520
left is ignoring this stream ladies and gentlemen this has been giga ohm biological a high resistance

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:46.600
low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist um

02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.600
um

02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:02.680
ladies and gentlemen uh intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent

02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:08.600
of augmenting the immune system is dumb uh transfection and healthy humans is criminally

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:16.120
negligent and RNA cannot pandemic uh start there and give people to pay attention to those messages

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:20.760
this has been giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:26.440
biologist i'll be on a 10 10 tomorrow on saturday to do that response video because i promised

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:30.600
i was going to do it with do it tomorrow and now i've got i've got work to do tomorrow again so

02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:36.920
i'll see you again at 10 10 tomorrow thanks for being here and uh thanks for sharing and if you

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:41.480
have the means please go to giga ohm biological and find other ways to support the channel thanks

02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:47.960
very much shout out to mark he's still working hard and shout out to Jessica who was just interviewed

02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:52.760
by the corona committee in germany today i'm looking forward to that interview by with wolf

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:58.760
gang and uh with vivian i also got an email from wolf gang this morning every time i get an email

02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:07.960
from that guy it feels like uh things might be okay um and um and nick hudson was on rustle brand

02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:13.160
so i'm gonna watch that this afternoon with great interest to see um what what ideas he

02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:23.880
mentioned and how far he got with it thanks again guys i'll see you soon

02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:40.360
you

02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:09.960
