WEBVTT

01:19.394 --> 01:19.455
you

03:18.029 --> 03:18.092
you

03:41.431 --> 03:48.496
I just realized that my Housatonic live ad is not in this deck, so I'm gonna do a vocal one right here.

03:49.517 --> 03:55.941
First in the chat, Housatonic ITS is a guy that you should check out on YouTube and on other social media platforms.

03:56.682 --> 04:00.624
Housatonic is run by Mark Kulak out of Boston, Massachusetts.

04:01.365 --> 04:01.965
Rock on, Mark.

04:27.205 --> 04:31.347
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

04:33.428 --> 04:34.989
I think truth is good for kids.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.489
We're so busy lying.

04:36.509 --> 04:39.251
We don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:39.711 --> 04:41.332
We want everybody to feel good.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.733
That's not, that's not the way life is.

04:46.194 --> 04:50.076
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:51.906 --> 04:52.628
And I have lied.

04:52.648 --> 04:53.670
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:53.690 --> 04:54.633
I don't want to lie.

04:55.134 --> 04:56.477
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:56.577 --> 04:57.619
I try not to be a liar.

04:57.639 --> 04:58.501
I don't want to be a liar.

04:59.063 --> 05:01.789
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

05:17.646 --> 05:19.549
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.032
His name is J.J.

05:21.172 --> 05:24.938
Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for C.H.D.

05:25.799 --> 05:27.962
and I believe he has a P.H.D.

05:27.983 --> 05:32.570
in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

05:35.955 --> 05:36.556
The

06:05.976 --> 06:07.119
The End

06:31.806 --> 06:34.990
Good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

06:35.050 --> 06:39.996
It's May 27th, and yes, the Ulschner Kulak session yesterday was something else.

06:40.737 --> 06:43.941
The Enchantment took a broadside blow yesterday.

06:44.522 --> 06:50.349
Pretty impressive landing, given that it was all improvised and all off-the-cuff discussion.

06:51.050 --> 06:59.377
with a couple people that have been working hard on their own and just happen to be in synergistic agreement with GigaOM Biological.

06:59.857 --> 07:18.571
And I think you're going to start to see this spread as more independent Galileo Galileis are identified in their own disciplines, in their own angles, and the Interesting Times are going to become Capital I Interesting Times very soon, because our consciousness

07:19.412 --> 07:20.793
is starting to become free.

07:21.654 --> 07:23.916
It used to be prime real estate that was for sale.

07:23.936 --> 07:25.257
We didn't even really realize it.

07:25.297 --> 07:43.711
And now the pandemic has made it clear exactly how much of this escape is gonna require us to understand what really is true rather than what we've been made to perceive as true over the last generation or two by men like him.

07:47.699 --> 07:50.260
I love this goldfish with a shark fin on it.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.201
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no evidence of spread in New York City or in any other geographic region.

07:58.322 --> 08:04.223
Infectious clones is a term that you can search on PubMed and understand what RNA virology is not.

08:04.243 --> 08:16.506
Placebo batches are something that have never been mentioned, but would be the easiest way to roll out transfection in healthy humans, knowing it was criminally negligent, but wanting to fool people.

08:19.434 --> 08:34.054
protocols were definitely murder we're just not talking about all the different ways that the protocols were murder we're just talking about a few very limited spectrums of debate regarding that murder and then we're not even using the M word

08:35.814 --> 08:44.618
Gain of function is definitely a mythology and we have been fooled into solving a mystery about a gain of function lab leak or a natural virus.

08:44.678 --> 08:55.403
And all it took was a spectacular commitment to these lies by the people on TV and social media that most of us are paying attention to for all of this to occur.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.224
Once you start to understand it, it becomes kind of scary.

09:00.905 --> 09:05.047
Once you start to see them for who they are, it does become a little scary.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.352
And now all they have left is to attribute bad motives to us.

09:17.032 --> 09:42.499
And you will see it more and more that the insults are becoming more and more the focus instead of the simple biological and common sense principles that Mark and Uwe and myself and Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal are trying to put forth on the internet.

09:44.301 --> 09:55.410
And it is with great trepidation that I say the names of some of these non-Americans, as I am very, very skeptical of foreigners trying to help with America.

09:55.470 --> 10:08.360
But you heard Uwe Altschner last night, yesterday, explain better than I've heard any foreigner explain why America's system, the American republic is the republic

10:09.457 --> 10:16.403
that needs to be saved because it is the republic that was a problem from its establishment.

10:17.524 --> 10:28.272
Andrew Jackson was fighting against the same powers that we are fighting against, even if they've morphed and changed their weapons, their weapons have become more effective.

10:29.093 --> 10:31.435
We can still, we still have time to show our kids.

10:33.115 --> 10:38.462
Obviously, there are people who are not going to see this, but our kids are wide open right now.

10:38.522 --> 10:40.866
Their brains are wide open from this mess.

10:41.980 --> 10:58.645
And rather than letting these transhumanists put ideas into our kids' head, we need to take this opportunity while our kids' eyes are wide open, while their minds are wide open, for us to explain how the transhumanist god of artificial intelligence is a myth.

10:59.365 --> 11:07.668
It's not going to solve any of the biological irreducible complexity that we should find sacred, that we should have reverence for.

11:08.288 --> 11:11.489
And in fact, this all is one big joke.

11:12.745 --> 11:17.688
And if we teach the biology to our kids, they're going to be able to see it for the joke that it is.

11:17.728 --> 11:26.954
If we teach the history to our kids, they're going to be able to see these tyrants for who they are, these charlatans, because that's what they are.

11:26.974 --> 11:34.339
And we do not want our children to inherit these charlatans and the power that they have over us.

11:35.532 --> 11:36.232
And it's up to us.

11:36.352 --> 11:48.537
We have to decide whether these people are going to be the idea setters, the thought leaders that our kids look up to, or if it's going to be the ones that we direct them to.

11:52.250 --> 11:59.056
And in the end, we're trying to arm our children to be able to work their selves out of this, work their way out of this themselves.

11:59.076 --> 12:01.838
That's how we make gentle the light of this world.

12:02.538 --> 12:10.145
We teach our children to critically think and to see this wave of lies for what it is in America and around the world, because that's what it is.

12:10.205 --> 12:13.868
It's a wave of lies that has been carefully orchestrated.

12:13.948 --> 12:17.470
It's not a spontaneous wave of human behavior.

12:18.331 --> 12:22.318
and human instinct, this is a highly orchestrated wave.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.675
Even though it looks like a lot of waves on the ocean, it's not.

12:27.036 --> 12:32.620
It's a very predictable one that benefits the people that understand how it's produced.

12:33.261 --> 12:41.107
And so if we can teach our children how this wave is produced and how we've been governed by it, I think that we can reach the shore safely.

12:42.008 --> 12:44.630
And that's the goal here.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.992
If you're here for a while, you've been at the top of the wave.

12:47.012 --> 12:49.113
And if not, you need to stay focused on the biology.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.315
You need to stop taking their bait on social media.

12:51.335 --> 12:53.237
And you need to love your neighbor.

12:55.452 --> 13:00.555
The way this works is that people share the stream and people go to GigaOM Biological and find a way to support.

13:02.096 --> 13:18.868
I'm more focused on sharing right now because the steady pressure that myself and others have been putting on this narrative is starting to bend it too far, beyond its structural integrity, and the reed has started to snap.

13:20.396 --> 13:25.260
The flimsy foundation on which this story is based has started to snap.

13:26.121 --> 13:38.354
And if we keep pushing, there's going to be a giant paradigm shift where all these interconnected stories now suddenly fit together in a very different way.

13:39.965 --> 14:00.118
And when that happens, it's going to be something where those of us who are engaged in informed non-compliance, those of us who have dropped our hands from our own eyes and are engaged in resistance are going to be, we're going to be empowered.

14:00.338 --> 14:02.080
And so get ready, it's coming very soon.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.841
This is GigaOM Biological.

14:09.497 --> 14:09.577
do

14:33.619 --> 14:34.900
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.441
It is the 27th of May 2024.

14:37.942 --> 14:41.724
I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

14:42.184 --> 14:42.925
Welcome to the show.

14:42.965 --> 14:47.748
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

14:48.428 --> 14:53.051
That biologist is Jonathan Cooey, and welcome to the broadcast.

14:53.571 --> 14:54.732
I'm a human just like you.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.454
I've got a wife and three kids, and that's about it.

14:57.674 --> 14:59.695
I'm fighting for their futures.

15:01.736 --> 15:09.420
and what little bastion of freedom is left in America and trying to preserve it for their grandkids.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.882
There aren't very many people that are actually doing that.

15:12.982 --> 15:16.444
Most of the people that have risen on the internet are actually working for the slavers.

15:17.465 --> 15:20.507
And so it's very important that we stay focused on the biology,

15:21.567 --> 15:27.752
and the big picture message that we are trying to send out on a daily basis.

15:28.332 --> 15:31.054
The noise that you hear in the background is the wind in the trees.

15:31.174 --> 15:33.776
In the garden, it's better with the door open.

15:33.796 --> 15:35.457
I apologize if that's a little noisy.

15:36.778 --> 15:41.662
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

15:42.322 --> 15:46.886
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

15:48.172 --> 16:03.648
As I've said many times, we're going to spend the next year or two laying a foundation of many courses that people can share with their family and friends in order to get through these basic biological ideas and the observations.

16:05.126 --> 16:10.270
in the past, let's say, 20 years that edify these concepts as being correct.

16:11.311 --> 16:16.936
I think that's really GigaOM Biological's main focus for the next four or five months.

16:16.996 --> 16:25.763
And so in the background, we're doing a lot of work that should support the, it's not something you can do just spontaneously.

16:25.803 --> 16:29.246
If we're going to do these small mini courses, and they're going to be worth the

16:31.357 --> 16:39.342
worth the hype, then they need to have content that's been well thought out and put together in a meaningful way.

16:39.402 --> 16:44.905
And so that's what we're doing in the background as we continue to put these streams out.

16:45.165 --> 16:48.046
And these streams are also something that I think are important.

16:48.066 --> 16:48.467
I'm always

16:49.667 --> 16:56.672
curating a list of videos and articles that I think are important not to forget and downloading what I can.

16:56.732 --> 17:15.325
It's not the same sort of public resource that someone like Mark Kulak has created at markhusatonicits.com where you basically have a self-assembled Wikipedia of news articles and clips and archived videos and all kinds of things that

17:15.945 --> 17:22.067
might otherwise be curated by the state or some other nefarious actor, globalist, whatever.

17:22.988 --> 17:32.971
Here you have Mark taking what he feels are relevant people and documenting their history and also interlinking the people who've mentored other people.

17:33.692 --> 17:44.976
And after four or five years, he's really come up with quite a resource that surprisingly few of these people on this screen have ever acknowledged as being even in existence, which is pretty comical.

17:56.729 --> 18:01.194
So today, I don't know how do you say Happy Memorial Day.

18:01.494 --> 18:04.257
I'm thankful for all the people that have

18:05.816 --> 18:21.247
participated in every attempt to preserve our republic, irrespective of the kinds of globalist international conspiracies that underlie all of these basic narratives in our history.

18:21.287 --> 18:28.932
There's no doubt that there are patriots in every generation, and Memorial Day is to remember those people that

18:30.831 --> 18:38.820
you know, signed a piece of paper and sort of gave away four years of their life in service of their country, which is not something that a lot of us have done.

18:39.681 --> 18:40.982
And my father did it.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.307
And my grandfather did it.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.209
But not everybody's done it.

18:47.950 --> 18:52.334
And so it's also an interesting time to be alive now where

18:53.583 --> 19:14.176
serving in the US military as noble of an idea as this is in light of the the current status of the globe I wouldn't I wouldn't fault anyone for thinking that you know you might have served in the 80s but you don't want to serve now

19:16.704 --> 19:24.947
I don't really know what to say about that because I know that everybody that signs that piece of paper is doing it for a combination of reasons, but they all have to be patriots.

19:25.887 --> 19:41.152
Nobody would, at least as far as I can imagine, nobody goes into that recruiting office with the idea that they're going to sign away that for the pay that they get or the uniform or whatever.

19:41.353 --> 19:43.793
And so anyway, this is a very special day.

19:43.853 --> 19:44.894
It's a very important day.

19:47.691 --> 19:53.876
But I also want to take the time to highlight something that I don't think anyone talks about enough.

19:53.916 --> 19:56.038
Surprisingly little, almost zero.

19:57.319 --> 20:06.266
And that is that there are weaponized piles of money and there are multinational corporations that are intertwined with those weaponized piles of money.

20:06.887 --> 20:11.130
Their technologies are intertwined with those weaponized piles of money.

20:11.831 --> 20:15.314
And Palantir, the company Palantir,

20:16.249 --> 20:20.891
and its involvement in anything should be a red flag.

20:20.931 --> 20:26.452
Palantir was involved in the data collection of Cambridge Analytica.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.854
They were involved in the data collection during COVID in the UK.

20:30.394 --> 20:34.975
They were involved in the data collection during the vaccination campaign in Israel.

20:35.455 --> 20:41.998
And they were involved in the data collection of a lot of the data that associated with the sequencing and the

20:43.098 --> 20:51.423
the PCR positivity and all this stuff, everything they can get their hands on, they get their hands on with regard to data.

20:52.123 --> 20:57.687
And Palantir gets many contracts, not only with these multinational corporations, but also with governments.

20:58.707 --> 21:03.550
And so they have a tremendous power that is simply unacknowledged.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.331
No one ever says the name.

21:05.791 --> 21:07.693
When Robert Malone says that all these

21:08.763 --> 21:14.545
If I say weaponized piles of money, one of the companies I'm always talking about is Palantir.

21:14.565 --> 21:18.346
I'm always talking about Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, whatever they're called.

21:18.406 --> 21:20.767
All these giant piles of money.

21:20.907 --> 21:22.528
And just list them.

21:22.568 --> 21:24.169
If I don't know them all, that's fine.

21:24.969 --> 21:28.050
But Palantir is a very, very interesting

21:29.614 --> 21:43.692
Entity and so I thought one of the first ways to introduce thinking about Palantir on the show might be to watch the founder of Palantir talk about it on 60 minutes and

21:44.753 --> 21:53.540
I try to read between the lines, and I'm not very good at that with regard to military stuff or governmental stuff or anything.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.343
I'm pretty good at it with biology, but I'm not pretty good at it with everything else.

21:57.423 --> 22:09.593
And so I feel like this is also kind of an illustration for my supporters to understand how much humility I think you should have

22:10.524 --> 22:12.266
when approaching these kinds of things.

22:12.326 --> 22:20.452
Because again, with biology, we're talking about concepts, ideas, observations that have been made.

22:21.093 --> 22:37.286
And I'm coming at it with what I consider almost a lifetime of experience of spending daily thought on something biological, daily thought on something within the realm of the scientific method and biological observation.

22:37.306 --> 22:37.667
So I've been

22:39.639 --> 22:41.239
I've been jumping rope for a long time.

22:41.500 --> 22:57.244
So it's a little different with regard to technology, information technology, spying, finance, and trying to expand our understanding.

22:57.284 --> 22:59.525
This is trying to build an understanding of the illusion.

23:00.205 --> 23:08.848
What happened yesterday with Mark Kulak and Uwe Altschner is just a tiny moment in time where

23:09.625 --> 23:17.088
You see on the screen and you hear these ideas that you've never thought about before and they're gonna change you just like they're changing us.

23:20.289 --> 23:24.811
If anyone in our high schools, for example, would have had the

23:27.600 --> 23:37.606
Imagine if our world history teacher would have said, you know what they don't tell you, but what I've thought about a long time is it doesn't really make any sense that they just killed all these Jews because that's simple.

23:38.026 --> 23:39.547
Like why would they waste that resource?

23:39.687 --> 23:44.910
I bet you anything that on a lot of those people, they did a lot of medical tests before they burnt them.

23:44.970 --> 23:47.792
So then there would be no evidence of all the medical testing that they did.

23:51.718 --> 24:16.114
They might have only buried the ones that they gassed and then, you know, and, and had to get rid of fast or, or were dissidents, but not testers, or, you know, I don't know the answer, but imagine if there was a history teacher in your past, which would have just had an enthusiasm for history and, and really thought about things and then just went, wait, that doesn't make sense.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.036
I betcha.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.088
And that's where we are right now.

24:23.148 --> 24:46.228
We're, crazy enough, real time realizing that one of the craziest aspects of the World War II historical narrative is that there exists a significant number of people that have managed to rise into media awareness that deny the Holocaust ever occurred.

24:47.935 --> 24:57.259
Very similar to how very early on in the pandemic, arising through media awareness, is this group of people who says there's no viruses at all.

24:59.699 --> 25:14.025
Even arising very quickly in the awareness of people who say we have to fight them, like Kevin McCairn was so convinced in March, even March 11th of 2020, that the main battle besides

25:15.333 --> 25:19.837
advocating for a harder lockdown and making everyone make masks at home.

25:21.037 --> 25:28.043
The main battle was to fight against these people who said there is no virus and say that the 5G is doing it.

25:29.984 --> 25:36.750
That was his actual message in March of 2021, along with, I guess, NeuroCOVID.

25:39.892 --> 25:44.856
And once you see it from this far away in retrospect, these meddlers,

25:46.906 --> 25:47.888
They are exposed.

25:48.489 --> 25:55.283
And it is most likely that these meddlers would be supporting, supported by, or

25:56.977 --> 25:59.840
coached to ignore something like Palantir.

25:59.960 --> 26:19.198
Otherwise, the ubiquitous presence of Palantir in the antibody space before the pandemic, in the mRNA space, in the data collection space, in these key locations like the UK and in Israel, these presences are completely ignored.

26:19.895 --> 26:34.669
by Kevin McCairn, and Charles Rixey, and Meryl Nass, and Robert Malone, and Jessica Rose, and Pierre Cory, and all of these people who have written books about very specific things.

26:36.158 --> 26:54.034
don't seem to notice that there's this one American multinational company with connections to the highest levels of intelligence in America, and also other countries, collecting all the data for the pandemic, connected to all of these weaponized piles of money.

26:54.714 --> 27:00.800
And all of these people that are pretending to be good guys like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, etc.

27:06.426 --> 27:13.813
Let's check this out because I think it's gonna be really insightful for you to see this video with me What happened there?

27:13.933 --> 27:20.039
Oh, yeah, you go like this And we go like this and we go like this.

27:20.780 --> 27:27.226
Oh my gosh, it's terrible I'm uh, I'm a little bit out of practice here.

27:27.266 --> 27:27.947
Sorry about that.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.108
That goes there.

27:29.208 --> 27:29.448
Yes.

27:29.468 --> 27:29.488
I

27:32.449 --> 27:37.337
Anyway, let's get this up and see if we can enjoy a little movie.

27:38.278 --> 27:39.039
Clicky click.

27:39.740 --> 27:40.802
Full screen, please.

27:40.982 --> 27:41.463
There we go.

27:42.184 --> 27:47.372
So I got to get my head out of the way for just one second and then we will, it'll play.

27:52.768 --> 27:53.669
Alex Karp is here.

27:53.709 --> 27:56.230
He is the co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies.

27:56.731 --> 28:04.056
The company's data mining software is used by various government agencies in the United States, including the CIA, FBI, and NYPD.

28:04.076 --> 28:06.938
It's also used by hedge funds and other financial firms.

28:07.418 --> 28:11.981
Karp is a Stanford graduate and co-founder of the company with ex-PayPal engineers.

28:12.541 --> 28:15.303
I am pleased to have him here at this table for the first time.

28:15.703 --> 28:18.205
He does not do many television interviews.

28:18.685 --> 28:20.547
And for that, I'm also pleased to have him here.

28:20.587 --> 28:20.907
Welcome.

28:21.345 --> 28:22.126
Thank you for having me.

28:22.406 --> 28:24.488
Let me talk a bit about the background, which is interesting.

28:24.708 --> 28:25.769
Stanford Law, wasn't it?

28:26.190 --> 28:26.990
It was Stanford Law.

28:27.811 --> 28:30.414
And then you went to Frankfurt?

28:30.854 --> 28:32.135
Then I went to Frankfurt and got a PhD.

28:32.155 --> 28:33.376
A PhD in neoclassical?

28:34.277 --> 28:38.061
Social philosophy, which is a fancy way of saying a quick path to being unemployed.

28:38.661 --> 28:42.124
Certainly to be the highest educated, least earning person on the planet.

28:42.605 --> 28:43.566
And why did you do that?

28:44.338 --> 28:46.579
Um, so that that's gotta be BS, right?

28:46.679 --> 28:47.920
Social philosophy.

28:47.960 --> 28:54.324
That's how you think about social stuff, you know, like interactions between people, maybe governance.

28:54.404 --> 28:58.006
It sounds a lot like a euphemism for eugenics, really.

28:58.026 --> 29:05.350
Um, and, and to super downplay it like, oh yeah, this was like the dumbest thing ever.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.492
I went to Frankfurt, you know, where Peter Thiel's from.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.715
I decided to go to school there and do a philosophy and,

29:16.209 --> 29:22.991
A philosophy in, in, or sorry, a degree in philosophies of governance by lying.

29:23.351 --> 29:24.872
Governance by mythology.

29:24.952 --> 29:26.172
That's what you should hear there.

29:26.252 --> 29:27.032
That's what that is.

29:27.973 --> 29:29.373
Governance by mythology.

29:30.293 --> 29:36.335
Even if the mythology is true or, or is based on true principles, it's still governance by mythology.

29:37.455 --> 29:39.116
Oh, I'm going backwards on the wrong computer.

29:39.156 --> 29:40.576
Let me see if I can get that back.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.137
So pleased to have him here.

29:42.157 --> 29:42.477
Welcome.

29:42.932 --> 29:43.712
Thank you for having me.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.073
Let me talk a bit about the background, which is interesting.

29:46.293 --> 29:47.354
Stanford Law, wasn't it?

29:47.774 --> 29:49.835
It was Stanford Law.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.996
And then you went to Frankfurt?

29:52.436 --> 29:53.736
Then I went to Frankfurt and got a Ph.D.

29:53.816 --> 29:54.957
in neoclassical?

29:55.857 --> 29:59.619
Social philosophy, which is a fancy way of saying a quick path to being unemployed.

30:00.239 --> 30:03.700
Certainly to be the highest educated, least earning person on the planet.

30:04.161 --> 30:05.141
And why did you do that?

30:06.226 --> 30:08.868
Well, the same reason I got involved in founding Palantir.

30:08.988 --> 30:10.270
I was really passionate about the issues.

30:10.790 --> 30:14.554
I largely wasn't putting money ahead of what I thought was important.

30:16.216 --> 30:18.759
Some of the ideas I dealt with were actually quite important.

30:18.779 --> 30:21.242
What does it mean to know something?

30:21.582 --> 30:22.923
What does it mean to communicate it?

30:24.585 --> 30:27.006
What is the foundation of Western society?

30:27.967 --> 30:30.028
Can we participate as citizens and how?

30:30.668 --> 30:34.409
I was very passionate about those ideas, just like I'm passionate about my business.

30:34.510 --> 30:37.671
Think about the questions that he just asked right there.

30:37.711 --> 30:41.333
It's almost like we have to go back because that is just extraordinary.

30:42.193 --> 30:43.734
What are the questions he's asking?

30:45.134 --> 30:45.995
He's unemployed.

30:47.115 --> 30:47.896
Why did you go?

30:47.916 --> 30:50.917
It largely

30:52.697 --> 30:55.359
I wasn't putting money ahead of what I thought was important.

30:55.379 --> 30:57.160
He was interested in the issues.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.640
What are the issues to him?

30:58.700 --> 31:04.884
The issues are, what does it mean to be a citizen?

31:04.944 --> 31:07.125
Can we participate as citizens?

31:07.245 --> 31:09.346
Can we participate as citizens?

31:09.827 --> 31:13.989
What a strange question to ask coming from a Republic.

31:16.209 --> 31:20.012
What does it mean to know something is another question that he asked.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.713
What does it mean to know something?

31:21.753 --> 31:22.133
What is it?

31:22.714 --> 31:28.018
In other words, he's asking the question of how do we.

31:31.881 --> 31:40.007
What is their exact quote consciously and intelligently manipulate the thoughts and habits of the, of the masses.

31:43.100 --> 31:45.042
You can hear it in the words that he's using.

31:45.082 --> 31:45.522
This is from 2009.

31:45.602 --> 31:51.767
This is 10 years before the pandemic.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.069
This has been a plan, ladies and gentlemen.

31:54.690 --> 32:02.216
The hog trap that we're in needed construction and it was constructed over decades.

32:03.337 --> 32:09.603
The hog trap that we are in, that we are now starting to be able to see the cage of,

32:12.179 --> 32:14.482
was created over decades.

32:15.503 --> 32:24.976
That's why when we were finally told we needed to rush in, that it was so well constructed.

32:27.031 --> 32:32.075
It was already so well formed that the barriers of the cage were already there.

32:32.135 --> 32:34.796
We ran over that way and we ran right into Robert Malone.

32:34.836 --> 32:37.198
We ran over that way, we ran right into Merrill Nass.

32:37.218 --> 32:39.660
We ran over that way and we ran right into ICANN.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.642
We ran over that way and we ran right into Tony Fauci.

32:42.662 --> 32:45.144
And we ran over that way and we ran right into Richard Ebright.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.586
And before you know it, wait, how do I get out of here?

32:52.085 --> 33:04.343
And Palantir has been instrumental in collecting the data and understanding the patterns that underlie our communicative use of social media.

33:05.427 --> 33:14.549
And over 10 years, Palantir has been learning to craft what we see on social media and they are selling these algorithms.

33:14.629 --> 33:24.191
I have almost no doubt in my mind, these proprietary algorithms are up for sale and can be used by Facebook, can be used by Twitter.

33:26.131 --> 33:28.652
They're like the McKinsey of social media.

33:28.672 --> 33:30.172
They're the McKinsey of data.

33:30.212 --> 33:33.033
They might even be a competitor in some ways because

33:35.700 --> 33:36.621
or a collaborator.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.985
But it's really, really important to see this for what it is.

33:42.065 --> 33:43.667
It's very, very important.

33:44.647 --> 33:46.589
Because this man is not fooling around.

33:47.930 --> 33:53.835
He is telling the truth on TV in 2009 because that's why he's going on 60 Minutes.

33:53.995 --> 34:01.081
Just the same reason why Peter Daszak was on 60 Minutes, when he was, how often he was.

34:01.181 --> 34:05.744
Just the reason why George Webb was on 60 Minutes at the beginning of the pandemic.

34:05.804 --> 34:09.928
Because 60 Minutes is part of the control grid.

34:12.974 --> 34:15.736
60 Minutes is exactly like Tucker Carlson.

34:15.896 --> 34:18.498
It is exactly like Brett Weinstein.

34:18.818 --> 34:25.142
It's one of these, the facets of this limited spectrum of debate that we are trapped inside of.

34:27.004 --> 34:34.309
And Palantir is responsible for a lot of the actual shaping of the tools that they use against us from all of these different angles.

34:35.129 --> 34:39.012
Palantir is one of the red threads that runs through the,

34:42.842 --> 34:51.068
operation that was executed in the UK, and in Israel, and in America, and in Canada, and there is no way to deny that.

34:52.168 --> 35:04.136
It is only a question of what have they done, to what extent, to what role did they play, and yet Sasha Latapova is not asking about the CIA, the FBI, or Palantir.

35:04.757 --> 35:08.740
Robert Malone is saying you're never going to figure anything out, he doesn't mention anything.

35:09.485 --> 35:21.150
The last time he mentioned something was when he was in 2021, still coming out, still trying to figure out what the message was and telling everybody that it was DITRA and he and we is DOD.

35:25.612 --> 35:32.195
Listen to the words he uses and understand that they don't mean what they say, they mean much more.

35:33.315 --> 35:35.396
It's code for the people who know.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.881
passionate about the issues.

35:38.382 --> 35:42.166
I largely wasn't putting money ahead of what I thought was important.

35:43.807 --> 35:46.390
Some of the ideas I dealt with were actually quite important.

35:46.850 --> 35:49.233
What does it mean to know something?

35:49.413 --> 35:50.534
What does it mean to communicate it?

35:52.196 --> 35:54.318
What is the foundation of Western society?

35:54.338 --> 35:56.120
What does it mean to know something?

35:56.300 --> 36:06.830
Well, right now, in science, it means that you test a null hypothesis and falsify it and get a p-value that says that you've falsified your null hypothesis.

36:08.452 --> 36:15.318
Exactly the same stuff that Peter Thiel was talking about in 2019 on the Portal podcast with Eric Weinstein.

36:16.320 --> 36:22.226
about how the exaggeration and lies have become possible because of the hyper-specialization.

36:22.666 --> 36:32.657
It's all the same set of words talking about the same phenomenon that actually mythologies can be created in the ivory towers of universities with

36:33.197 --> 36:39.238
grant funds and grant calls that are focused on the wrong null hypothesis, that ask the wrong questions.

36:39.678 --> 36:45.480
And so he's telling you in a very umbrella set of terms exactly what he's concerned with.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.820
How can we create knowledge?

36:48.400 --> 36:51.081
Can knowledge be falsely created?

36:51.161 --> 36:53.221
Can we create mythologies instead?

36:53.681 --> 36:58.022
These are the real questions that he's in, the real issues that he was interested in.

36:58.522 --> 37:01.083
And these are just the the mouth breather

37:01.883 --> 37:08.465
skilled TV watcher set of words to use so that he makes sure that it's just the brochure version of the idea.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.086
Again, this is only a 20 minute video.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.906
It's probably gonna take me two hours to get through it.

37:15.307 --> 37:16.407
But really important.

37:17.307 --> 37:18.868
Least earning person on the planet.

37:19.348 --> 37:20.348
And why did you do that?

37:21.416 --> 37:24.018
Well, the same reason I got involved in founding Palantir.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.440
I was really passionate about the issues.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.743
I largely wasn't putting money ahead of what I thought was important.

37:31.384 --> 37:33.946
Some of the ideas I dealt with were actually quite important.

37:34.447 --> 37:36.829
What does it mean to know something?

37:36.989 --> 37:38.110
What does it mean to communicate it?

37:39.791 --> 37:42.213
What is the foundation of Western society?

37:43.173 --> 37:45.235
Can we participate as citizens and how?

37:45.876 --> 37:50.039
I was very passionate about those ideas, just like I'm passionate about my business, Palantir.

37:50.605 --> 37:57.226
And also about antisemitism and other issues that you thought needed to be written about and discussed.

37:57.787 --> 38:07.249
I published widely on both technical issues, kind of issues involving the convergence of neo-Kantian philosophy and Freud, and on discrimination and on civil liberties.

38:07.889 --> 38:09.149
Neo-Kantian.

38:09.849 --> 38:10.709
Neo-Kantian.

38:10.729 --> 38:11.890
I think he's talking about

38:14.818 --> 38:17.360
about, what is his name, Immanuel Kant?

38:17.820 --> 38:19.021
K-A-N-T.

38:20.262 --> 38:22.383
That's some pretty impressive stuff there.

38:22.423 --> 38:26.105
We're basically talking about Club of Rome shit.

38:29.307 --> 38:34.551
Interesting that he said, the host says antisemitism and he doesn't.

38:35.031 --> 38:37.633
Like I'm passionate about my business, Palantir.

38:38.215 --> 38:44.839
And also about antisemitism and other issues that you thought needed to be written about and discussed.

38:45.379 --> 39:02.167
I published widely on both technical issues, kind of issues involving the convergence of neo-Kantian philosophy and Freud, and on discrimination, and on civil liberties, and on anything that anyone would read, which is what you do when you're an aspiring academic with essentially an interest in writing.

39:03.448 --> 39:06.870
And then I migrated into a business context.

39:08.652 --> 39:11.477
I mean, I migrated into a business context.

39:11.537 --> 39:15.643
So he pretends that he really wanted to be an academic because that's what you do?

39:17.628 --> 39:21.849
That's not, it's antithetical to how academia works.

39:22.189 --> 39:28.990
Unfortunately, academia is a thing that you go into and you go all in and everybody around you is going all in.

39:29.050 --> 39:46.254
And the idea of sticking your foot into academia and then starting a multi-billion dollar multinational corporation that just gets to collect all data from all things and pretend that they are able to have proprietary algorithms that analyze it is hysterical to me.

39:46.980 --> 40:00.411
That's the basic gist of their, you give us all your data and then we'll give it back to you in a different form and tell you that we used highly proprietary algorithms to give it back to you in that different form.

40:00.851 --> 40:07.816
And to what extent what we've done is not just espionage, you'll never be able to evaluate because you've already paid for it.

40:08.317 --> 40:15.222
And the results will be good, but I mean, you're gonna see it, you're gonna see it.

40:18.140 --> 40:24.326
Well, you know, the interesting thing about academia is that it's more interesting to the people in it than it is to anyone else.

40:25.627 --> 40:32.233
And the impact, yes, you end up fighting about small things that may be fairly unimportant to other people.

40:32.613 --> 40:37.958
And I thought that while the ideas were important, the actual impact they were going to have was going to be very small.

40:38.038 --> 40:42.563
I mean, the kind of work I did was intelligible to probably 30, 40 people in the world.

40:43.203 --> 40:44.683
So, um, wow.

40:44.803 --> 40:50.844
So he's so smart that the stuff he wrote is only really understandable by 30 to 40 people on earth.

40:53.145 --> 40:56.705
And so here he's talking about the same thing that Peter Thiel is talking about.

40:56.765 --> 41:04.187
Now he's kind of slagging off the idea that it's so hyper specialized that I was writing stuff for like 30 or 40 people on earth.

41:04.227 --> 41:07.027
That's that's how many people are specialized in what I do.

41:08.427 --> 41:10.588
And so what he's outlining really here.

41:11.678 --> 41:33.748
in real time in 2009 is this horrible problem that we have in academia that knowledge can essentially be created that can be only evaluated by 30 or 40 people, which means that the rest of the people just read what you say and take it at face value as best they can, given that they don't understand the language you're using.

41:36.277 --> 41:48.848
He's outlining a scenario where gain of function in RNA viruses or the pandemic potential in RNA viruses in the wild or in the laboratory could be created out of whole cloth.

41:50.310 --> 41:56.896
Where only 30 or 40 people in the world, maybe less, would be able to evaluate the legitimacy of any of the claims.

42:01.246 --> 42:17.929
And so he realized that, holy cow, there is so little good information out there that I could make a living with a company that actually took in a lot of information and then tried to find patterns which could help them identify the good information in the noise.

42:19.829 --> 42:28.091
Which if you're given access to all the information, it might be very trivial to do that with a significant computer power.

42:29.463 --> 42:34.726
or with just manpower of looking for patterns and finding them and calling it AI.

42:36.807 --> 42:58.839
And of course, it's pretty hard to differentiate when everything is proprietary inside of that building, whether it is an AI in a box that has figured out the patterns, or whether it's just 3,000 people on keyboards in different rooms working hard for three months to figure out the patterns and working together to solve it.

43:01.587 --> 43:07.091
And either way, he's representing it as his company with his ideas and their proprietary technology.

43:07.131 --> 43:07.972
You'll hear it coming.

43:10.935 --> 43:15.118
And I think you'll be able to see how malevolent the description is.

43:15.198 --> 43:19.922
It's really awful because he has just told you that there's a lot of bullshit in the world.

43:20.542 --> 43:29.770
Not as well as Peter Thiel did in 2019 when he said that his default is to start with the idea that people are obviously lying and exaggerating because

43:30.310 --> 43:36.695
That's what you do in order to succeed in these hyper-specialized fields, and so I take everything with a grain of salt.

43:37.175 --> 43:39.377
This guy is telling you that it's all lies.

43:39.817 --> 43:53.028
He's figured out that actually citizens can't really participate in their own republics because of the fact that knowledge can be created and curated by a very few people, and everybody else can't call him on it.

43:55.979 --> 44:05.922
I hope you can see how significant this little interview is, because even though he never uses any big words, he says very, very, very big things.

44:12.897 --> 44:28.455
on both technical issues, kind of issues involving the convergence of neo-Kantian philosophy and Freud, and on discrimination, and on civil liberties, and on anything that anyone would read, which is what you do when you're an aspiring academic with, essentially, an interest in writing.

44:29.096 --> 44:30.677
This guy is not Peter Thiel.

44:30.878 --> 44:32.399
He is Alex Karp.

44:33.240 --> 44:42.768
But Peter Thiel and Elon Musk started PayPal together, and this guy started Palantir with a bunch of PayPal engineers.

44:43.289 --> 44:44.270
They're all friends.

44:44.870 --> 44:47.553
Peter Thiel is invested in Palantir.

44:47.593 --> 44:50.135
He's part of the company.

44:51.396 --> 44:52.337
That's not Peter Thiel.

44:52.357 --> 44:53.338
This is Alex Karp.

44:53.378 --> 44:56.800
This is the guy that they don't show you very often.

44:57.677 --> 45:02.240
That's why we're watching him right now, because he's pretty honest.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.722
He tells you exactly what's up, just in a very clever way.

45:05.762 --> 45:06.382
He's smart.

45:07.623 --> 45:11.085
And then I migrated into a business context.

45:12.105 --> 45:13.386
And what caused you to do that?

45:14.352 --> 45:20.555
Well, you know, the interesting thing about academia is that it's more interesting to the people in it than it is to anyone else.

45:21.496 --> 45:28.459
You know, and the impact, yes, you end up fighting about small things that may be fairly unimportant to other people.

45:28.819 --> 45:34.162
And I thought that while the ideas were important, the actual impact they were going to have was going to be very small.

45:34.242 --> 45:38.784
I mean, the kind of work I did was intelligible to probably 30, 40 people in the world.

45:41.467 --> 45:45.976
It seemed more interesting and compelling to do something else, get involved in business and see how that worked out.

45:46.017 --> 45:50.246
And some of the issues in business are actually, from an academic perspective, also quite compelling.

45:50.366 --> 45:51.468
So where did you migrate to?

45:52.185 --> 45:56.907
Well, it turned out I had a facility for... I was pretty good at making money.

45:57.507 --> 45:59.407
And I was very bad at getting paid.

46:00.068 --> 46:08.631
So I basically turned the ability to make money and get paid into a business where I look for other people who are good at making money and bad at getting paid.

46:09.031 --> 46:10.251
So he did nothing.

46:10.331 --> 46:11.512
He's told you nothing.

46:11.832 --> 46:15.753
I mean, listen to how much... This is incredible.

46:20.279 --> 46:26.845
So it seemed more interesting and compelling to do something else, get involved in business and see how that worked out.

46:26.905 --> 46:28.466
And some of the issues in business are actually.

46:28.846 --> 46:30.308
Get involved in business?

46:31.288 --> 46:40.476
Can you imagine how stupid you would sound if you were at a cocktail party and some attractive other came over and said, hey, what's up?

46:40.516 --> 46:40.957
How are you?

46:41.037 --> 46:41.577
Nice to meet you.

46:41.617 --> 46:42.758
I've never seen you here before.

46:42.798 --> 46:44.119
And you said, yeah, I'm in business.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.482
I decided to get into business after I was in academia.

46:52.915 --> 46:53.455
Is that all?

46:53.475 --> 46:59.620
He's not gonna... It's amazing that Charlie Rose is probably not gonna ask him any follow-up questions.

46:59.660 --> 47:02.262
Business, what do you mean by you decided to get into business?

47:02.943 --> 47:04.204
What does that even mean?

47:09.668 --> 47:11.910
From an academic perspective, also quite compelling.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.191
So where did you migrate to?

47:13.851 --> 47:18.575
Well, it turned out I had a facility for... I was pretty good at making money.

47:19.175 --> 47:21.037
And I was very bad at getting paid.

47:22.130 --> 47:25.053
So he's pretty good at making money, but very bad at getting paid.

47:25.113 --> 47:27.014
Does that make any sense to you either?

47:27.034 --> 47:30.697
I mean, I don't... Why is he laughing?

47:30.737 --> 47:31.598
That's not funny.

47:33.119 --> 47:34.260
What do you mean by that?

47:34.320 --> 47:35.681
You're going into business.

47:35.762 --> 47:38.704
You're good at making money, but you're not good at getting paid.

47:38.784 --> 47:39.665
What does that mean?

47:41.306 --> 47:43.328
You just told us that you were the poorest.

47:43.848 --> 47:46.491
It was the dumbest, you know, like overeducated.

47:47.623 --> 47:48.964
Writing for 40 people.

47:49.885 --> 48:13.681
This is not a honest story It's most likely somebody who was given military technology or allowed to roll out military technology as their own just like Jeff Bezos Just like Steve Kirsch This is just a Muppet

48:14.622 --> 48:19.506
He might be a very smart Muppet playing a very important role, but he's a Muppet for them.

48:20.767 --> 48:21.928
Because this is bullshit.

48:26.152 --> 48:37.902
I basically turned the ability to make money and get paid into a business where I look for other people who are good at making money and bad at getting paid and I taught them how to make money quicker and to get paid fairly.

48:40.287 --> 48:43.614
I mean, I don't even know how to process those words.

48:43.654 --> 48:44.917
They're so stupid together.

48:45.699 --> 48:48.925
And yet, Charlie Rose, I guess, takes it at face value.

48:50.561 --> 48:51.842
venture capital kind of operation?

48:52.783 --> 49:04.712
Basically my own business which I built and I went around looking for motley people who had academic proclivities and were interested in business and I would approach them and say why don't you build a business, I'll help you.

49:05.593 --> 49:16.021
And I did that for a couple years and then I reconnected with Peter, Peter Thiel, and we began along with a couple other guys to build this company.

49:16.501 --> 49:18.483
And while there you had the idea for Palantir?

49:18.943 --> 49:20.985
I mean, a couple other guys, who's that?

49:21.025 --> 49:23.287
Peter Thiel and Elon Musk were tight, right?

49:23.387 --> 49:28.111
So, don't you see now what's happening here?

49:28.131 --> 49:32.615
Ooh, Elon Musk and Twitter are gonna save us.

49:34.737 --> 49:36.359
Oh, it's the town square.

49:36.379 --> 49:39.942
Oh, where everybody's censored.

49:39.982 --> 49:41.884
We better go to Gab and Locals.

49:44.141 --> 49:46.163
Have you done any research into locals?

49:46.203 --> 49:47.685
Do you know who locals is?

49:47.765 --> 49:48.846
Have you looked at this?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.548
Locals is them.

49:53.170 --> 49:56.673
Locals is the best way to find them.

49:56.974 --> 50:02.079
Anybody that is on locals and encouraging you to go on locals is them.

50:04.882 --> 50:06.163
I'd bet all my chips on it.

50:07.284 --> 50:11.245
That's why Bret Weinstein is in Locals and went there very quick.

50:11.325 --> 50:15.426
That's why other people went to Locals exclusively very quick.

50:16.247 --> 50:19.348
That's why they were all trying to get me to go to Locals.

50:23.109 --> 50:23.949
Because it's them.

50:27.510 --> 50:30.271
Now, make a list of those people on Locals.

50:30.351 --> 50:34.552
Make a list of those people that sell the rifle, black rifle coffee.

50:37.110 --> 50:37.691
You'll see it.

50:39.893 --> 50:49.903
Yeah, well, you know, post 9-11, I think the idea again, it was Silicon Valley ought to be involved in fighting terrorism and protecting our civil liberties.

50:51.104 --> 50:55.009
And, you know, terrorism is asymmetric.

50:55.569 --> 50:59.270
Asymmetry presupposes software because you're finding needles and haystacks.

50:59.850 --> 51:07.172
Actually using an approach that's not exactly like data mining was a critique on some of the data mining approaches that had been used at PayPal.

51:07.673 --> 51:11.374
And we thought that that approach would be very effective in this context and it would do two things.

51:11.414 --> 51:14.915
It would allow humans to find needles and haystacks.

51:16.015 --> 51:18.596
Needles and haystacks based on how they spend their money?

51:20.211 --> 51:22.154
Algorithms that they used at PayPal.

51:22.254 --> 51:23.696
Are you starting to see it now?

51:24.156 --> 51:27.120
He's saying it right out loud here on 60 Minutes.

51:27.180 --> 51:28.702
All you got to do is pay attention.

51:28.722 --> 51:34.690
60 Minutes also told you at the beginning of the pandemic that George Webb was a fake.

51:35.651 --> 51:38.355
They told you flat out he's a fake.

51:41.798 --> 51:46.840
so that you would chase the Scooby-Doo for four and a half years if you saw it or heard it.

51:47.280 --> 51:56.763
That's the same reason why Robert Malone still has the link for that 60 Minutes episode that's not down or hard to find on his substack.

51:57.884 --> 52:01.765
No link for Giga Home Biological to show you exactly where that bad guy is.

52:02.875 --> 52:06.576
But there's a link for Mary Holland at CHD.

52:06.596 --> 52:12.958
There's a link for Catherine Austin Fitz at Solari.

52:12.998 --> 52:17.160
There's a link for George Webb and his 60 Minutes interview.

52:17.180 --> 52:19.580
There's a link for Sasha Latapovin or Substack.

52:20.221 --> 52:23.222
Here's a link to all my meddlers.

52:26.242 --> 52:30.624
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen, and I think we're starting to be able to see who they work for.

52:32.335 --> 52:33.956
by who they don't ever mention.

52:35.996 --> 52:37.897
That's the easiest way for me to see it.

52:40.358 --> 52:45.660
My other obvious thing would be, of course, if you claim that you're fighting it, you're probably part of it.

52:45.720 --> 52:56.284
So if you claim that you're really, really against Bimbo Bailey since the beginning of the pandemic, because it's not 5G and those people are grifters, you're probably working with them.

53:00.836 --> 53:17.310
to create a limited spectrum of debate where nobody can escape the hog trap because no matter which direction you run into, you run into one of these people that has been put there by people like him because they know that citizens cannot participate in their own republic if they don't understand reality.

53:19.311 --> 53:24.636
He told you he was really interested in the issues, you know, like how do we know, how do we know something?

53:26.117 --> 53:27.678
What does it mean to know something?

53:27.719 --> 53:29.280
Can citizens participate?

53:30.848 --> 53:45.636
He's interested in the big ideas, ladies and gentlemen, like the organized and intentional manipulation and control of the habits and opinions of the masses in order to govern them.

53:47.377 --> 53:47.857
I hear it.

53:48.840 --> 53:49.600
I hope you do, too.

53:50.321 --> 53:52.262
Data intelligible to you and me, which it's not.

53:52.782 --> 54:07.128
And by doing that, it would allow them to find bad people trying to destroy our society and could be used also to protect civil liberties by making the data sets transparent so that it was very clear what the government is doing and how they're doing it, which is a particular passion of our company.

54:07.348 --> 54:09.249
This may be obvious, but why did you name it Palantir?

54:09.329 --> 54:13.231
So Palantir is going to save us from the government by auditing them.

54:18.263 --> 54:19.764
I just think you got to know that, right?

54:19.804 --> 54:23.406
You got to know that this is so crazy and such nonsense.

54:25.427 --> 54:31.111
And when you see it now, when you see it now, ladies and gentlemen, please understand that this is really

54:33.220 --> 54:35.781
This is the end of this mythology that they've created.

54:35.821 --> 54:38.522
This is the end of this control structure.

54:38.582 --> 54:49.106
If we keep pushing steadily every day, and we keep pushing this information out every day, people will be able to see it and then engage in informed noncompliance.

54:51.627 --> 54:58.470
And unfortunately, that might mean leaving places like Twitter and learning how to use a federated social media network.

54:59.390 --> 54:59.990
It might mean

55:02.375 --> 55:06.879
logging off of YouTube and working harder to find the content that you follow.

55:07.640 --> 55:19.591
It might mean taking social media off of your phones so that they don't get the data that they need or want or have convinced the government that is necessary to be collected.

55:22.393 --> 55:27.638
Palantir is probably an instrumental player in convincing the

55:31.224 --> 55:42.913
agencies and parts of our system which are not fully in their control to follow and conform because of control of the information.

55:44.053 --> 55:47.996
On social media, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it, they contract.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.562
I'm gonna go back a little bit just in case we missed something.

55:56.653 --> 56:07.440
I want to hear, so he says that he thinks Silicon Valley can be used to fight terrorism and Silicon Valley can be used to protect civil liberties.

56:07.940 --> 56:15.185
And they're going to protect civil liberties by collecting a lot and a lot of data about how you spend your money and how you behave.

56:15.665 --> 56:21.349
And then that we can get patterns out of it and we can find needles and haystacks, which are bad guys that we're looking for.

56:21.949 --> 56:23.990
It would never be used to fight dissidents.

56:24.410 --> 56:26.451
It would never be used to control a narrative.

56:26.491 --> 56:33.355
It would never be used to create the illusion of consensus about a spreading risk additive RNA based pathogen.

56:33.555 --> 56:34.556
Never, no way.

56:34.616 --> 56:35.616
That would be crazy.

56:36.056 --> 56:40.559
This is just to protect civil liberties and to make sure that the government is transparent.

56:41.499 --> 56:42.860
Stop lying.

56:44.906 --> 56:50.230
Silicon Valley ought to be involved in fighting terrorism and protecting our civil liberties.

56:54.273 --> 56:55.394
Terrorism is asymmetric.

56:55.914 --> 56:59.597
Asymmetry presupposes software because you're finding needles in haystacks.

57:00.177 --> 57:02.879
actually using an approach that's not exactly like data mining.

57:02.899 --> 57:07.503
It was a critique on some of the data mining approaches that had been used at PayPal.

57:08.003 --> 57:11.706
And we thought that that approach would be very effective in this context, and it would do two things.

57:11.766 --> 57:18.412
It would allow humans to find needles in haystacks, so make the data intelligible to you and me, which it's not.

57:18.472 --> 57:27.199
And by doing that, it would allow them to find bad people trying to destroy our society, and could be used also to protect civil liberties by making the data such that it's transparent.

57:27.559 --> 57:27.819
Could?

57:28.860 --> 57:38.526
and could be used also to protect civil liberties by making the data such transparent so that it was very clear what the government is doing and how they're doing it, which is a particular passion of our company.

57:38.746 --> 57:39.406
This may be up.

57:40.127 --> 57:43.729
Making the government transparent is a particular passion of his company.

57:43.769 --> 57:47.251
Wow, even Mother Nature is getting angry at the amount of bullshit on the screen.

57:47.961 --> 57:51.603
But why did you name it Palantir after the seeing stones in the Lord of the Rings?

57:51.683 --> 57:51.903
Yes.

57:53.084 --> 57:58.167
For those of you who had a social life in high school, you may not realize what Palantir is.

57:58.187 --> 58:05.392
For those of us who didn't have a social life, you immediately jumped out at you as the seeing stones in Lord of the Rings.

58:06.512 --> 58:12.876
And they allowed the West to communicate or the forces of good to communicate and see into vast distances.

58:13.456 --> 58:14.037
And we thought

58:18.035 --> 58:18.535
The West.

58:19.275 --> 58:21.756
Was it called the West in the Lord of the Rings?

58:21.816 --> 58:22.396
I don't know.

58:22.476 --> 58:26.957
I've read the books, but a long time ago, I don't remember them calling them the West, but maybe it was.

58:27.497 --> 58:29.317
It's, this is amazing.

58:30.038 --> 58:33.558
Or the forces of good to communicate and see into vast distances.

58:34.138 --> 58:43.720
And we thought it was a fitting name for a product that allows you to see into large databases, but doesn't allow you to see things you're not allowed to see, which is basically what the seeing stones.

58:43.740 --> 58:45.881
Which is one of the problems because of civil liberties and everything else.

58:46.641 --> 58:46.901
Yes.

58:47.221 --> 58:54.406
So the basic idea is that the West or Western values will win if we in the West believe in what we're doing.

58:54.747 --> 59:00.611
There's no point in having a war on terrorism if civil liberties are being undermined to the extent that we aren't willing to fight that war.

59:00.651 --> 59:02.412
And this is particularly true in the cyber context.

59:02.932 --> 59:07.936
It turned out that the approach that was used at PayPal was essentially an anti-data mining approach.

59:08.556 --> 59:12.397
It was anti-data mining in the sense that data mining uses algorithms across large data sets.

59:12.737 --> 59:16.457
And what we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based search.

59:16.517 --> 59:25.479
So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, the- Predicate-based searches, I believe, will be like, we're going to look for people who buy guns.

59:25.559 --> 59:29.180
We're going to look for people who post about Trump.

59:29.200 --> 59:32.800
We're going to look for people who retweet Tucker Carlson.

59:32.820 --> 59:35.401
We're going to look for people who showed up at January 6

59:37.312 --> 59:40.657
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's what that means in a legal sense.

59:40.737 --> 59:44.783
Predicate based, predicated on.

59:45.970 --> 59:46.190
Right?

59:46.370 --> 59:48.791
I'm going to do a search predicated on what.

59:48.871 --> 59:51.131
So now we're not using algorithms anymore.

59:51.191 --> 59:52.391
Now it's not an AI.

59:52.451 --> 59:57.192
It's just people saying, I think we should look for people who do this and see what we find.

59:57.692 --> 01:00:04.554
So in other words, you are entrusting a private company with all of the data, and then they're going to tell you what they find in it.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:11.075
And supposedly our governments around the world and corporations around the world are trusting this company to do that.

01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:12.836
Here's all our data.

01:00:13.236 --> 01:00:14.236
Here's everything we got.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:16.317
Can you tell us if there's anything interesting here?

01:00:16.357 --> 01:00:19.599
Can you tell us what the top 10 most interesting things are?

01:00:20.339 --> 01:00:21.380
Imagine this.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.201
Imagine the ridiculousness of this.

01:00:24.402 --> 01:00:26.282
And yet this is in 2009.

01:00:26.843 --> 01:00:32.406
At the start of the pandemic, they were everywhere, ladies and gentlemen, everywhere.

01:00:36.728 --> 01:00:37.768
But it's Pfizer.

01:00:37.788 --> 01:00:40.530
Pfizer is the one we're going to have to punish.

01:00:43.035 --> 01:00:44.396
Oh, I hope we get Moderna, too.

01:00:44.816 --> 01:00:48.959
And if we could put Fauci and Peter Daszak in jail, boy, would that be awesome!

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:56.104
Yes, the NSA is military.

01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:56.765
Yes, it is.

01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:04.479
lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:07.901
But it would also be very clear how the government looked at you.

01:01:08.381 --> 01:01:13.984
It wouldn't be a wide net cast into a sea of data that brings back all the innocent citizens that

01:01:14.184 --> 01:01:26.770
Oh, so the transparency is that they just tell you that if you're a Christian and you fly an upside down flag because you think that America is under attack, that you could be put on a list and then the government's being transparent.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.711
If you do that, we just think you're a terrorist.

01:01:29.872 --> 01:01:30.552
Can you hear it?

01:01:30.932 --> 01:01:32.333
It's exactly what he's saying.

01:01:32.353 --> 01:01:36.295
There's not, I don't think I'm misinterpreting anything that he's saying here.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.056
Now the government can be clear.

01:01:38.096 --> 01:01:41.198
We're not using an algorithm to randomly flag people.

01:01:41.538 --> 01:01:43.919
We're flagging you because of your behavior.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:56.917
And Palantir has a way of digesting databases and making it very easy for you to click check marks and pull people out based on predicates, predicate searches.

01:01:58.179 --> 01:01:59.701
I really don't think I'm hearing it wrong.

01:02:04.207 --> 01:02:06.108
essentially an anti-data mining approach.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:10.550
It was anti-data mining in the sense that data mining uses algorithms across large data sets.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:14.612
And what we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based research.

01:02:14.672 --> 01:02:23.997
So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, there's lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.

01:02:24.597 --> 01:02:27.379
But it would also be very clear how the government looked at you.

01:02:27.879 --> 01:02:34.846
It wouldn't be a wide net cast into a sea of data that brings back all the innocent citizens that are touched by that net.

01:02:34.927 --> 01:02:41.013
It's a very precise, very precise operation, and each step in that operation is documented.

01:02:41.373 --> 01:02:43.936
How much of your business is finding terrorists for the U.S.

01:02:43.976 --> 01:02:45.958
government or whoever wants to hire you?

01:02:46.298 --> 01:03:08.484
Most of our business is in government, and it all involves both sides of this equation, finding people who are up to essentially bad things, both in the anti-terror area, in cyber, in financial malfeasance, mortgage fraud, but also making sure the data is tagged in a way that allows agencies to collaborate with one another, which is one of the big findings in the 9-11 Commission.

01:03:08.624 --> 01:03:10.084
Why weren't people able to collaborate?

01:03:10.404 --> 01:03:14.425
People tend to focus on the policy issues, but there are also massive technical issues.

01:03:14.485 --> 01:03:27.249
So this, I think, is a huge thing that Catherine Watt is very hot on, is the idea that after 9-11, changes were made so that cross-agency cooperation was easier and that people didn't fight turf wars.

01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:39.393
And this was something that I think, in a way, just like having separate currencies in Europe might be a little pain in the ass for traveling and stuff like that, but it makes the system decentralized and more stable.

01:03:41.494 --> 01:04:02.681
creates a little bit more air correction mechanism, whereas if you have cross-agency cooperation and ways of distributing information, now it's very easy to keep the FBI, the CIA, the State Department, and all these other of the 17 known intelligence agencies to exist, keep them focused on the same shiny object.

01:04:03.933 --> 01:04:11.219
And so from my perspective, very armchair, you know, watching this, again, I'm not a national security specialist.

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:32.956
To me, this sounds like, again, a sort of slow-rolled titration of the reality, which is that your government and its structures are being undermined in real time and have been undermined over time since before 2009, where this information is coming from, where this interview comes from.

01:04:33.988 --> 01:04:41.672
They have been slowly undermining the stability and strengths of our system so that they could manipulate it as a whole.

01:04:41.692 --> 01:05:03.184
9-11 was a very important step in this that may not, possibly may not have gone as far as they wanted it to, because it primarily involved planes and terrorism rather than biology, which some people, including Mark Kulak, suggest maybe was originally intended to be a part of it.

01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:09.836
So I don't want to get too deep into that part of the narrative.

01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:17.159
I just want you to see very clearly what I see with regard to what language he's choosing and how significant it is that this is 2009.

01:05:19.352 --> 01:05:21.974
to be solved, and solved in a way where you can just install it.

01:05:22.114 --> 01:05:22.594
We do that.

01:05:23.074 --> 01:05:30.239
And the second piece is, how do you do it so that when the government is looking at you or me, it's clear that they're looking at you and me for a reason.

01:05:30.379 --> 01:05:32.300
If they bring a case against us, what is the case?

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.521
Where did the evidence come from?

01:05:33.661 --> 01:05:35.262
Did it come from sources they were allowed to see?

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:40.245
Did they migrate from the source of one piece of evidence into another source?

01:05:40.605 --> 01:05:43.087
These are the kind of questions that Americans care a lot about.

01:05:43.187 --> 01:05:44.207
Why can't the government do this?

01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:47.089
I mean, if this guy is just another fake,

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:56.084
Like the lady that poked your finger and got a drop of blood and could test you for all kinds of diseases.

01:05:56.164 --> 01:06:02.529
If this is just a Theranos kind of thing, then haven't we just said, okay, well, we trust you.

01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:04.811
I guess your proprietary stuff works really great.

01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:07.613
So here's the big data pipe.

01:06:08.954 --> 01:06:10.155
And where do you want us to put this?

01:06:10.495 --> 01:06:11.456
Just plug it in over here.

01:06:11.496 --> 01:06:11.796
Okay.

01:06:11.916 --> 01:06:17.781
And then now the data comes out the other end and goes back to the government.

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:23.949
or to the agency that they're helping, to the company that they're helping.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:33.052
And because of the nature of this proprietary technology, there's nothing, it's a black box where their data goes through.

01:06:33.352 --> 01:06:43.575
And governments are allowing this man in 2009 to talk like this on 60 Minutes, say a bunch of words that really mean nothing except trust us.

01:06:45.156 --> 01:06:48.037
In fact, they mean that the government already does trust us.

01:06:49.008 --> 01:06:56.501
because I know how to make money but not get paid and so I got a bunch of other people together that know how to make money but couldn't get paid and made a business out of it.

01:07:02.216 --> 01:07:27.757
To me, this is just a absolutely awful story for skilled TV watchers in 2009 to be basically told without even being known, without them really knowing that they're being told that private corporations are starting to gain more and more control over the government based on their control of government information.

01:07:31.189 --> 01:07:35.671
That's what they, that's what is being told here to anybody that can hear it.

01:07:35.731 --> 01:07:38.092
And most people that watch 60 minutes can't hear it.

01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:41.654
They're still thinking, wow, this guy's super smart.

01:07:42.154 --> 01:07:49.257
And he was so smart that he, he, he went to Frankfurt and studied the least payable philosophy of something.

01:07:49.317 --> 01:07:52.579
I don't know, but man, he's really charming and he's funny and, and.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:56.800
themselves.

01:07:57.201 --> 01:07:58.542
Your child needs

01:08:26.561 --> 01:08:27.122
Sorry about that.

01:08:27.182 --> 01:08:27.802
It's my Mac.

01:08:27.942 --> 01:08:28.663
I apologize.

01:08:28.683 --> 01:08:32.625
I always ever get five seconds, though.

01:08:33.826 --> 01:08:35.507
It's the place we've excelled at.

01:08:35.547 --> 01:08:38.789
Think of the software products you like to use, your audience likes to use.

01:08:38.949 --> 01:08:39.890
They're mostly American.

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:42.111
And they don't use it because it's built in America.

01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:43.372
They use it because it's the best.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.412
And why is that?

01:08:44.472 --> 01:08:48.915
Well, you know, the thing is, of course, we have enormously talented people.

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:54.579
But what makes a software product work is an ability to build a business around a compelling idea.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:09:03.581
And while this seems obvious in America, and especially in Silicon Valley, in almost every other place, if you want to build a business, people say, well, how are you going to make money tomorrow?

01:09:04.082 --> 01:09:06.762
In Silicon Valley, we build businesses around an idea.

01:09:07.182 --> 01:09:08.603
And then we figure out how we're going to make money.

01:09:09.283 --> 01:09:18.686
Oh, so an idea, like, well, if you gave me all your data and I used predicate-based algorithms, I could give you your data back in a different form.

01:09:18.726 --> 01:09:20.266
And it would be much more useful for you.

01:09:20.306 --> 01:09:21.386
And it would be transparent.

01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:22.827
And I can provide this product.

01:09:23.447 --> 01:09:25.848
Do you understand that he just admitted it?

01:09:27.648 --> 01:09:28.749
Just like Therano.

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:32.710
So if you give us time and give us this blood, then we'll figure it out.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:37.892
And actually they just ran it into the other room and put it on a really great big machine instead of their little tiny one.

01:09:40.472 --> 01:09:45.434
And then they pretended that it came out of their little tiny one, but really they just ran a genome screen in the back room.

01:09:48.447 --> 01:09:58.479
And so this guy is pretending that he has software that's proprietary and magical that can take an unwieldy large set of data and make it into something useful for those people.

01:10:02.984 --> 01:10:07.630
Just like I can take a drop of blood and tell you all the diseases that you might have a propensity for.

01:10:10.993 --> 01:10:21.805
And all he's really doing is getting access to your blood, getting access to your genetics, getting access to your microbiome, getting access to your behavior, and then saying that he can do something useful about it.

01:10:22.245 --> 01:10:26.270
So how hard would it be to produce a product in this scenario?

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.291
Look, here's the output.

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:29.313
This is it.

01:10:30.374 --> 01:10:31.856
Thanks for the millions of dollars.

01:10:34.673 --> 01:10:36.675
Please understand something, okay?

01:10:36.815 --> 01:10:39.237
Please understand something very important here.

01:10:39.297 --> 01:10:51.266
When you buy this idea, buy a business that's around an idea, you're not buying a watch that you can open up the back and go, holy man, that thing is beautiful.

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:52.527
Look at those.

01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.269
You're not buying a watch.

01:11:00.033 --> 01:11:01.634
In other words, think of it this way.

01:11:05.154 --> 01:11:06.114
I can never open that.

01:11:07.795 --> 01:11:09.716
So think of it this way, okay?

01:11:10.836 --> 01:11:11.576
Is it two or one?

01:11:11.616 --> 01:11:12.217
I think it's two.

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:18.759
You're not buying a watch when you buy this story.

01:11:19.759 --> 01:11:24.161
You're not buying a software that you can go, wow, this is a really nice watch.

01:11:24.221 --> 01:11:26.142
So this is the readout of the software.

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:30.223
The software works where you can push this button and then it keeps track of time.

01:11:30.263 --> 01:11:32.484
You can push this button and it splits the time.

01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:38.895
And it's proprietary software, but you know, I bought it.

01:11:39.915 --> 01:11:45.917
And so if I bought it, right, I should be able to look inside and see how the software runs.

01:11:46.158 --> 01:11:46.698
Just see it.

01:11:46.718 --> 01:11:49.719
You can just look inside and see how it runs.

01:11:49.799 --> 01:11:54.141
Palantir is not providing that level of transparency to the government.

01:11:54.981 --> 01:12:03.605
Palantir is telling you that without seeing what's inside here, we can take your data and give you numbers.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:08.289
And there's no way for you to verify how that software works.

01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:14.860
It's no way for us to verify what else they do with that data, who else they sell it to, how else they make money with it.

01:12:18.336 --> 01:12:20.678
And that's the same trick that they do with AI.

01:12:20.738 --> 01:12:22.739
Well, you know, we don't really know how it works.

01:12:22.779 --> 01:12:28.864
You can't really open it up and see how the AI solved any problems right now, you know?

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:31.586
So, so it's just, it's just AI works.

01:12:31.606 --> 01:12:35.229
You got to feed it a lot of data and then it pulls out the right numbers.

01:12:40.026 --> 01:12:54.373
We don't really want to know how RNA viruses work either because, you know, we just put the DNA clone or the RNA clone and transform or transfect a cell culture and that's pretty much all we know.

01:12:54.433 --> 01:12:55.113
I mean, it works.

01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:56.134
It's repeatable.

01:13:00.716 --> 01:13:05.038
These aren't exact parallels, ladies and gentlemen, but it's the same kind of chicanery.

01:13:05.078 --> 01:13:06.959
It's the same kind of charlatanism.

01:13:06.999 --> 01:13:09.260
It's the same kind of snake oil salesman.

01:13:11.001 --> 01:13:12.102
He just admitted it.

01:13:12.582 --> 01:13:18.805
We build businesses in Silicon Valley, like Theranos, around an idea.

01:13:19.765 --> 01:13:23.747
Not a real working technology, but around an idea.

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:28.450
And my idea was if you gave me all your data, I could sort it out for you.

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.733
If you gave me access to all of your data, NSA, I could probably sort it out for you.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:36.634
Stop lying!

01:13:38.134 --> 01:13:41.636
That's how this works, and it's not a guy lying and fooling the government.

01:13:41.656 --> 01:14:04.006
It's a guy performing a brochure for people on 60 Minutes to explain why it is that our data, our data from our government, from our NSA, from our CIA, whatever, where I guess it's NSA, is being handled by a private corporation.

01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:10.371
that we can never see inside because of proprietary technologies.

01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:20.573
Because if we use that government technology in the military and in our government, eventually it would have to be, somebody would see it.

01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:23.594
Somebody with clearance would be able to check it.

01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:28.935
Somebody would find out whether that program was bullshit or not.

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:40.258
That's why all of these technologies are rolled out outside of the government, even when they've been produced by DARPA or produced by government research.

01:14:41.639 --> 01:14:43.921
Because if they didn't, then it would be ours!

01:14:46.203 --> 01:14:48.045
Instead of their proprietary stuff.

01:14:48.065 --> 01:14:49.666
I don't know, we can't really see it.

01:14:50.751 --> 01:14:51.831
No way to inspect it.

01:14:51.871 --> 01:14:55.633
It could just be a bunch of people in a room deciding who they want to work against.

01:14:55.773 --> 01:15:00.254
It could be just a bunch of people in a room finding patterns the way, the old-fashioned way.

01:15:00.714 --> 01:15:01.255
Hard work.

01:15:04.516 --> 01:15:06.736
Oh, but America makes all the greatest software.

01:15:06.796 --> 01:15:07.577
It's all great.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:08.857
The software is just great.

01:15:08.957 --> 01:15:11.738
Twitter is like the best algorithm ever.

01:15:12.798 --> 01:15:14.039
Stop lying!

01:15:15.947 --> 01:15:22.632
This is incredibly important because if you want something to really work, something really complicated, you cannot hire people who are motivated by a paycheck.

01:15:22.992 --> 01:15:24.133
They have to live and breathe it.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:25.794
They have to do it over a long period of time.

01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:30.218
Our company took three years to build before we even went to market.

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:31.819
Three years, no revenue.

01:15:32.752 --> 01:15:35.214
In any other part of the world, people would laugh you out of the room.

01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:37.016
But not in the venture.

01:15:37.436 --> 01:15:48.404
But how did he get a company to go for three years without making any money unless he had somebody give him a lot of money, or he made a lot of money from selling philosophical treaties, I guess.

01:15:48.464 --> 01:15:48.784
I don't know.

01:15:49.865 --> 01:15:51.107
But not in Silicon Valley.

01:15:51.127 --> 01:15:52.688
It's a rare place where people- Somewhere else.

01:15:52.728 --> 01:16:01.016
It doesn't have to be Silicon Valley for venture capital to say, you're not going to make revenue for three years, but then we believe that you have the seed to grow into something big.

01:16:01.196 --> 01:16:09.584
Venture capital exists everywhere, but the companies that have been best at using that capital exist in America by and large, and particularly in Silicon Valley.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:13.008
And it's, I believe, it's not because we're smarter.

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:19.331
It's because we work better together, because we're more likely to be compelled by a big idea and put monetization second.

01:16:19.771 --> 01:16:22.192
And this is the secret to our company.

01:16:22.592 --> 01:16:24.193
Even when we went to market, we didn't hire sales.

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:25.334
We still don't have salespeople.

01:16:25.694 --> 01:16:27.895
We have no salespeople working for us at Palantir.

01:16:27.955 --> 01:16:32.837
We sell the product by exposing clients to it and saying, compare us to what you have.

01:16:34.078 --> 01:16:35.058
But they have nothing.

01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:39.140
That's the point, right?

01:16:40.202 --> 01:16:41.663
Compare us to what you have.

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:43.144
Give us access to everything.

01:16:43.204 --> 01:16:45.685
Let us upload it to your phone and let you show it.

01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:47.266
I mean, it's a joke to me.

01:16:48.527 --> 01:17:07.698
It's the arrogance and the certainty that he presents these ideas, and yet they're just basically word salads, that shows you that this is part of the military governance, the governance by mythology that's always been going on.

01:17:11.232 --> 01:17:16.515
It is governance by mythology, ladies and gentlemen, and it's not started before the pandemic.

01:17:16.555 --> 01:17:26.922
The pandemic is the culmination of years of preparation, years of setting us up, years of setting our parents up.

01:17:30.077 --> 01:17:37.921
And the speed of the inversion of our sovereignty to permissions is just accelerated during the pandemic and is part of the plan.

01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:44.564
Because again, in order to reorganize an ordered society, you need to go through chaos.

01:17:44.584 --> 01:17:47.685
You can't take an ordered society and just reorder it.

01:17:49.286 --> 01:17:56.870
It's much easier and more effective and more thorough if you create chaos and then reorganize it.

01:17:58.268 --> 01:17:59.529
And that's what the pandemic was.

01:17:59.769 --> 01:18:08.054
And they'll probably have to repeat it because of the fact that they went so off script that somebody like Robert Malone had to come on the stage in June of 2021.

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:15.098
Same month that Naomi Wolf decided to come on the stage and really start talking about the shot.

01:18:15.659 --> 01:18:18.981
And the same time that Byron Bridle was silenced in Canada.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:32.295
same time that Steve Kersh decided to become public, and the same time that Bret Weinstein sacrificed his YouTube monetization for all of us in a heroic effort to be a patriot.

01:18:35.657 --> 01:18:37.118
What's the compelling business idea here?

01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:48.387
The compelling business idea is if you want to make data, if you want to interact with data in a way that's intelligible to you, so the data that's around you, and you're the government, it's a very hard thing to do at scale.

01:18:48.768 --> 01:18:52.090
So let's just say you go to the market and you buy something.

01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:53.371
You talk on your cell phone.

01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:54.412
You send an SMS.

01:18:56.954 --> 01:19:01.017
So the government's got all this data, but they don't have the software to sort it out.

01:19:01.077 --> 01:19:12.867
So in swoops, this guy who did a philosophy degree in Frankfurt and a law degree at Stanford with a bunch of people who know how to make money, but not get paid.

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:19.692
And he tells the government that, you know, you've got so much data, you need people like us.

01:19:22.014 --> 01:19:25.977
It's just a mythology, ladies and gentlemen, it's just a bullshit story.

01:19:27.702 --> 01:19:41.985
as they have incrementally transitioned to this control mechanism of full lockdown on information, full lockdown on monitoring people to identify problems and people and put them on lists and we're already on lists.

01:19:42.825 --> 01:19:51.147
They already know where we live and probably could flip the switch anytime they wanted to and the list is published and people would disappear.

01:19:51.167 --> 01:19:54.467
2009 this video is from.

01:19:58.114 --> 01:19:58.454
report.

01:19:58.714 --> 01:19:59.455
All those are data.

01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:03.337
At massive scale, it's very hard for you to see that as a pattern.

01:20:03.577 --> 01:20:05.178
So what is the pattern of Charlie Rose?

01:20:05.638 --> 01:20:08.380
Is Charlie Rose interacting with people that are up to no good?

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:19.766
And then it's very hard for me, the citizen of America, to look at the government and say, did they look at Charlie Rose because he was up to no good, or did they look at Charlie Rose because they didn't like his hair color?

01:20:20.647 --> 01:20:36.640
So he's trying to pretend that Palantir provides a way for the NSA to use the waterfall of data that they have coming in every second in a transparent way so that people will know their civil rights aren't being violated.

01:20:39.755 --> 01:20:44.740
Did they use Charlie Rose as a way to look at Charlie Rose's audience and find out who's in the audience?

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.324
Well, if I'm looking at the government trying to figure that out, it's very hard to do.

01:20:48.664 --> 01:20:53.849
What's done currently is they hire a team of computer scientists who write algorithms that none of us understand.

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:56.452
And then they come back and say, oh, well, maybe.

01:20:56.612 --> 01:20:59.535
Do you believe the computer scientists they hire, or would you rather see it yourself?

01:21:00.276 --> 01:21:01.037
And that's what we offer.

01:21:01.077 --> 01:21:07.120
We offer a way to just plug on our platform, and you can be a leading expert in finding patterns on large data sets.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:20.849
Whether those patterns are terrorists, they're cyber attackers, they're people, again, in financial malfeasance, or we the people who want to look at what the government is doing in one form or another, either through Congress or through our attorneys, we can then see what the government is doing.

01:21:20.869 --> 01:21:21.689
This is very important.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:25.532
We also allow people to collaborate, which is an enormously important problem.

01:21:26.092 --> 01:21:33.879
When people look at what happened on 9-11, the conclusion was it happened because people weren't collaborating, and they focus on kind of... Especially the CIA and FBI.

01:21:34.819 --> 01:21:40.304
Agencies did not effectively collaborate, and people focus on the policy and inability to work together.

01:21:40.324 --> 01:21:42.265
He wouldn't say specific agencies.

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:47.069
He just let Charlie Rose say that, and then he said agencies didn't collaborate.

01:21:47.089 --> 01:21:52.034
People weren't collaborating, and they focus on kind of... Especially the CIA and FBI.

01:21:53.222 --> 01:21:55.063
Agencies did not effectively collaborate.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:58.845
And people focus on the policy and inability to work together.

01:21:58.865 --> 01:22:00.445
But there's also a massive technical issue.

01:22:00.746 --> 01:22:05.888
How do you work in a massive data set and take out the two pieces of data that the FBI is allowed to see?

01:22:06.908 --> 01:22:07.568
It's very tough.

01:22:07.649 --> 01:22:10.430
And that's something we have a turnkey approach to that.

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:14.131
You can put our product on top of your servers, and you can collaborate tomorrow.

01:22:14.612 --> 01:22:15.172
Interesting.

01:22:15.232 --> 01:22:21.735
So it seems like almost Palantir has allowed other agencies to use the NSA data

01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:24.946
in a way that doesn't violate civil rights.

01:22:25.026 --> 01:22:25.866
It's amazing.

01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:30.868
And remember, in Silicon Valley, we start companies based on ideas.

01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:33.409
So his idea was that there needed that.

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:35.050
There was a need there.

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:36.831
And he's providing that need.

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:37.951
He is so smart.

01:22:38.571 --> 01:22:44.794
I mean, I can't believe how he got into business after going into social philosophy in Frankfurt.

01:22:45.454 --> 01:22:47.595
What have you discovered about terrorists?

01:22:48.786 --> 01:22:54.467
Well, obviously, we don't discuss exactly what we've done in a classified context, nor am I allowed to.

01:22:54.567 --> 01:23:11.290
But for example, in the Sinjar case, which is a case that was discussed in the public, we took a data set that lots of people had looked at, some of the world's experts, and we found that there was a group of people that lived in a village that was responsible for most of the attacks in Iraq.

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:14.131
And we found out they were responsible for most of the money and most of the attacks.

01:23:14.551 --> 01:23:17.393
Now that's very valuable and highly actionable information.

01:23:17.853 --> 01:23:22.797
If you know all the real attacks are coming from one source, there's a lot you can do about that.

01:23:23.197 --> 01:23:33.604
And this is typical for the kind of things, or when we looked at the Dalai Lama... And so do you really believe that the DoD needed to hire a private company to figure that stuff out when they had all the data?

01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:39.728
Or do you think that it was hired because that was the plan?

01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:45.140
The DoD couldn't develop that technology and deploy it on its own.

01:23:47.742 --> 01:23:48.963
Do you see the problem here?

01:23:50.184 --> 01:24:00.473
This is the orchestrated giving away of control over America's powers, basically.

01:24:01.294 --> 01:24:02.475
It is the careful

01:24:04.827 --> 01:24:09.294
loaning out of the power of the NSA via Palantir.

01:24:09.354 --> 01:24:15.583
Palantir gets to be the dealer of NSA information, it would feel like.

01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:18.307
That's no small power.

01:24:27.486 --> 01:24:29.388
a case which got a lot of public attention.

01:24:29.448 --> 01:24:40.314
We partnered with Citizen Lab in Canada and we discovered that the Dalai Lama had been infiltrated by one of the world's most sophisticated and largest cyber networks.

01:24:40.894 --> 01:24:43.156
And we discovered that... Working at the service of someone else?

01:24:43.436 --> 01:24:45.457
Working at the service of somebody else.

01:24:45.958 --> 01:24:46.418
A government?

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:50.040
That part we were not clear about but we are clear.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.502
One of the very interesting things about cyber is this whole issue of attribution.

01:24:53.802 --> 01:24:53.962
Right.

01:24:55.584 --> 01:25:02.531
I think the metaphor that one could use in talking about cyber is maybe less cyber war, but the democratization of spy techniques.

01:25:03.172 --> 01:25:08.157
So, in the 80s and the 70s, only large governments could pull off spy operations.

01:25:08.217 --> 01:25:14.965
Now, teenagers in the basement with a computer can pull off a spy operation, and it's very unclear if it's them or someone else.

01:25:15.305 --> 01:25:25.368
Wow, so that's exactly the same as Robert Malone says that now a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and some equipment bought off of eBay can make a gain-of-function virus.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:42.252
He's saying in 2009 that a teenager like, I don't know, maybe a young girl from California could be on YouTube and make really crazy high-produced videos that look like spy movies and then get promoted by Alex Jones in 2019.

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:46.916
Holy shit, is he talking about Soph?

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:52.859
The diagnostic you use is very, very complicated.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:58.683
It's not like someone breaks into your home, they leave a footprint, or a handprint, or they leave a hair behind, or you take a picture of them.

01:25:59.203 --> 01:26:01.004
It's very, very tough to find out who they are.

01:26:01.404 --> 01:26:05.887
But what we can allow people to do is get a much better sense of what the evidence is, where it points to.

01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:09.509
The simple reason why simple data mining doesn't work

01:26:11.117 --> 01:26:20.041
even leaving aside the moral issues it raises, is it uses a static algorithm against a non-static and highly entrepreneurial adversary.

01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:21.281
That would be the terrorist.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.001
That's the terrorist.

01:26:22.922 --> 01:26:26.363
And so what you need to do is have a platform that allows you to interact with the data.

01:26:26.383 --> 01:26:29.585
He described terrorists as being entrepreneurial.

01:26:29.665 --> 01:26:30.245
Can anybody

01:26:30.965 --> 01:26:37.813
In the chat, clarify how a terrorist is entrepreneurial and how that contributes to the problem of terrorism.

01:26:38.473 --> 01:26:39.655
That's extraordinary.

01:26:39.775 --> 01:26:40.556
I don't know what it means.

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:41.637
It could be very valid.

01:26:41.677 --> 01:26:47.644
I'm not a military guy, but that's an incredible combination of words that doesn't seem random.

01:26:48.848 --> 01:26:52.709
against a non-static and highly entrepreneurial adversary.

01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.930
That would be the terrorist.

01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:54.650
That's the terrorist.

01:26:55.590 --> 01:27:02.092
And so what you need to do is have a platform that allows you to interact with the data and see the patterns before they realize they're giving off the patterns.

01:27:02.233 --> 01:27:03.613
So it's non-algorithmatic.

01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:04.713
It's not static.

01:27:05.214 --> 01:27:13.996
And what we allow people to do is we allow the actual person doing the work, the analyst, the targeteer, to get ahead of the terrorist, to see patterns a terrorist doesn't realize they're giving off.

01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:15.477
And this is what.

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.298
Now, how good is the terrorist?

01:27:18.178 --> 01:27:18.538
You have to

01:27:18.578 --> 01:27:18.718
What?

01:27:18.738 --> 01:27:18.818
What?

01:27:48.738 --> 01:27:55.842
Agile there you go now now he's talking about narrative control Now he's talking about actors now.

01:27:55.882 --> 01:28:02.966
He's talking about people that will actively oppose the behaviors of these people and

01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:07.153
It's very cool because now you're hearing him say it already.

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:26.773
And where do they develop their entrepreneurship, and where do they develop their own computer savvy?

01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:34.219
They believe in things that we don't believe in, and I think are highly destructive, but they're nevertheless maybe the most interesting, talented people of their society.

01:28:34.479 --> 01:28:35.860
It's the same place we get our entrepreneurs.

01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:39.843
The best schools, the best minds, or people who are just good at something that's very valuable.

01:28:40.584 --> 01:28:42.465
Moving to cyber warfare, what do you fear the most?

01:28:43.832 --> 01:28:53.715
We as a country understand what the danger is, and we as a country understand that it's possible to fight this without giving up our civil liberties.

01:28:53.755 --> 01:28:54.115
We'll win.

01:28:54.536 --> 01:28:59.597
If we underestimate the danger or we perceive this as a war that will be costly to who we are, we'll lose.

01:28:59.937 --> 01:29:02.818
Democracies tend to win when the country gets behind it.

01:29:02.898 --> 01:29:06.439
We are kind of the greatest democracy in the world, and we tend to win.

01:29:06.479 --> 01:29:08.840
We are a republic, not a democracy.

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.861
If we become a democracy, it's over.

01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:16.324
And so this you can clearly hear is staged nonsense language that's too bad.

01:29:16.344 --> 01:29:19.546
See this as a war that will be costly to who we are.

01:29:19.566 --> 01:29:20.066
We'll lose.

01:29:20.406 --> 01:29:23.268
Democracies tend to win when the country gets behind it.

01:29:23.348 --> 01:29:25.729
We are kind of the best democracy in the world.

01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:29.011
And we tend to win wars where the people believe in what they're doing.

01:29:29.571 --> 01:29:33.734
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:29:34.094 --> 01:29:35.194
It's going to be very hard to win.

01:29:35.535 --> 01:29:39.177
As long as we have computers that are turned on, there will be people that penetrate them.

01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:41.638
Every time we find a way to block them, they'll find a way in.

01:29:42.099 --> 01:29:45.160
The danger is real and it's going to be with us the rest of our life.

01:29:45.521 --> 01:29:55.787
Now the question is, if the danger is real and it's with us for the rest of our life, what can we as citizens do, we as Americans do, that allows us to experience the liberty we want and stop them?

01:29:56.207 --> 01:30:02.171
And I think apparently he didn't know that signal was coming around or that any of these other encrypted apps would be there, right?

01:30:02.211 --> 01:30:07.153
I mean, it's really amazing to me that he's being so obvious here.

01:30:07.173 --> 01:30:09.495
Of course, there are back doors to all these encrypted.

01:30:10.455 --> 01:30:11.236
Of course, there are.

01:30:12.230 --> 01:30:13.431
They control the software.

01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:14.771
They're telling you it right now.

01:30:14.791 --> 01:30:17.532
He's telling the whole world right now what's going on.

01:30:17.592 --> 01:30:22.734
This inversion from sovereignty to permissions is just an illusion.

01:30:22.754 --> 01:30:25.455
It already exists as an illusion.

01:30:25.516 --> 01:30:33.699
If they're already watching everything you do and watching your patterns and identifying them and extracting information from them, we're already enslaved.

01:30:42.682 --> 01:30:47.445
that educational piece is really addressed directly, we will have a problem.

01:30:47.505 --> 01:30:49.366
Educating the public about the threat?

01:30:49.706 --> 01:31:00.171
Both the threat and the way... And the necessity of taking certain... Approaches, obviously I'm biased and I think, you know, Palantir's ability to tag data and show what the government has done is enormously important.

01:31:00.551 --> 01:31:03.473
But you have to explain, if this is explained where there's

01:31:03.473 --> 01:31:08.275
He keeps pretending that Palantir provides transparency.

01:31:08.335 --> 01:31:09.916
Now he says tagging the data.

01:31:10.496 --> 01:31:13.357
I believe this is part of the snake oil.

01:31:13.417 --> 01:31:25.162
The real thing is getting access to the data and pretending that you're giving something useful back that a bunch of people in a room can't give back by looking at the data and using simple search algorithms.

01:31:26.023 --> 01:31:27.143
Predicated searches.

01:31:27.203 --> 01:31:28.964
I mean, this is just a joke to me.

01:31:30.996 --> 01:31:37.199
It's very frustrating how much I'm sure that this is a capital L liar.

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:42.501
...prediction between our liberty and protecting ourself, we're going to have a real problem.

01:31:42.921 --> 01:31:47.083
It's just the same way in any other war, where if it's we don't believe in what we're doing, we can't win.

01:31:47.523 --> 01:31:50.245
Where Americans believe in what we're doing, we tend to do very well.

01:31:50.265 --> 01:31:53.586
But then are you arguing if they believe in what you're doing, they're willing to give up?

01:31:53.606 --> 01:31:55.967
He's talking about believing in what we do.

01:31:56.047 --> 01:31:57.348
That's nationalism.

01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:01.172
He's talking about believing in what we do.

01:32:01.232 --> 01:32:09.721
That's the organized and intentional manipulation of the habits and opinions of the masses that Edward Bernays talked about.

01:32:10.702 --> 01:32:13.745
He went over to Germany to study social philosophy.

01:32:14.165 --> 01:32:20.752
He went over to Germany because he's very interested in the issues like how do we know something and can citizens participate

01:32:26.488 --> 01:32:30.549
Please see this man and his lies for what they are.

01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:53.893
They are a very titrated and controlled release, an announcement of a coming and impending inversion where the slavery will become common knowledge and our surrender to social norms and the demands of our community will

01:32:56.132 --> 01:33:06.037
supersede the sovereignty of the individual and supersede the sacred irreducible complexity of everyone's biology.

01:33:08.898 --> 01:33:14.941
Like Mr. Rogers behind my shoulder over here says, you know, you're, you're perfect just the way you are.

01:33:16.962 --> 01:33:18.503
And you have been since you were born.

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:31.065
And unfortunately, these people are involved in making sure that that reverence for who we are is permanently erased.

01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:35.005
The liberties?

01:33:35.605 --> 01:33:36.966
Is that part of the argument you're making?

01:33:37.146 --> 01:33:37.346
No.

01:33:38.146 --> 01:33:48.949
Well, I believe one of the reasons why I actually talk in public is there are approaches like ours which allow the people to make sure the government is actually doing what it claims to do.

01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:56.391
So if you understand what the government is doing to protect and you understand what the limits are and you know those limits and they can be enforced, that's one thing.

01:33:56.951 --> 01:33:59.912
If it's data mining where they're casting a massive net

01:34:00.572 --> 01:34:03.414
under the aegis of protecting us, well, that's not fine.

01:34:03.694 --> 01:34:04.755
So let me give you a concrete example.

01:34:04.775 --> 01:34:07.217
And so he's repeating an idea, right?

01:34:07.277 --> 01:34:19.506
He's still repeating the idea that this company is based on, that regular algorithms that don't have any nuance aren't good enough and don't protect your rights.

01:34:19.666 --> 01:34:27.672
If we give us all the data and then we do predicated searches, then we can make government more transparent.

01:34:27.712 --> 01:34:28.693
And it's just a lie.

01:34:29.628 --> 01:34:30.188
Stop lying!

01:34:30.568 --> 01:34:32.049
I'm sorry, but it's just a lie.

01:34:32.169 --> 01:34:34.930
Data destruction, something that is not talked about enough.

01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:41.993
So you're running a large multinational company, and the government knocks on your door and says, your data is about to be destroyed.

01:34:42.633 --> 01:34:43.973
We know it because we were down the stairs.

01:34:43.993 --> 01:34:45.554
We have also classified files.

01:34:45.594 --> 01:34:46.334
We understand what's going on.

01:34:46.374 --> 01:34:47.154
We need to make a copy now.

01:34:48.655 --> 01:34:52.118
of your data to prevent it from being destroyed, because we know how to secure that data.

01:34:52.638 --> 01:34:56.761
Well, you might be in favor of that, except for you want to make sure they're not going to use that data against you.

01:34:57.882 --> 01:35:02.365
What's the guarantee that they use it, that that data doesn't get migrated into a case that the government brings against you?

01:35:03.065 --> 01:35:04.066
What if the government's already?

01:35:04.206 --> 01:35:06.108
Oh, so you can trust Palantir to do it.

01:35:06.148 --> 01:35:07.489
You can't trust the government.

01:35:07.609 --> 01:35:14.854
Governments are not transparent unless you have a company like Palantir making sure they're transparent, but that's just ridiculous.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.521
That's just ridiculous.

01:35:23.483 --> 01:35:25.284
It's incredible what's happening here.

01:35:25.564 --> 01:35:27.426
I can't believe how good this video is.

01:35:28.026 --> 01:35:28.686
Case against you.

01:35:28.746 --> 01:35:29.587
Answer your own questions.

01:35:29.927 --> 01:35:37.652
Well, our approach is when the government takes the data, it's tagged in a way that shows the source.

01:35:38.252 --> 01:35:42.415
So it can't be migrated from the data they've taken from you to a case they have pending.

01:35:43.277 --> 01:35:44.018
And this is a normal thing.

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.700
So if they take the data, you make sure they tag it?

01:35:46.781 --> 01:35:49.283
If you use our platform, we can take that data and ingest it.

01:35:49.404 --> 01:35:49.944
It's tagged.

01:35:50.385 --> 01:35:54.769
If it's migrated into a case that they may have running against you, your defense attorneys will see that.

01:35:55.626 --> 01:35:58.508
And you'll say, OK, well, this data came from data I gave you.

01:35:59.028 --> 01:36:00.128
This is enormously important.

01:36:00.349 --> 01:36:05.752
You're not going to have buy-in to help the government protect you unless you know that your liberty is going to be protected.

01:36:06.272 --> 01:36:10.474
And this is something we do kind of turnkey, or as we'd say in the Valley, out of the box.

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:13.356
Whether you used us or whether you build a system, that's not my point.

01:36:13.816 --> 01:36:17.758
These kind of things have to be built in and baked in, and they have to be discussed with the American people.

01:36:17.878 --> 01:36:20.340
I'm always perplexed by this question.

01:36:21.901 --> 01:36:31.276
If the CIA can hire people like you, like Palantir technologies, why can't bad guys hire people, not you, but people like you?

01:36:32.233 --> 01:36:34.734
Well, I think, actually, I think... Because they don't exist?

01:36:34.814 --> 01:36:35.295
Is that the answer?

01:36:35.315 --> 01:36:36.135
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:36.615 --> 01:36:39.977
I think the bad guys do get people of equal talent to what we can get.

01:36:39.997 --> 01:36:46.280
I think that we in America are very good at organizing ourselves so that we outperform the bad guys they get.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.981
But I think they get very talented people.

01:36:48.001 --> 01:36:49.602
And the cyber context is a great example.

01:36:50.002 --> 01:36:55.465
You have what are probably bands of teenagers taking down major organizations.

01:36:56.405 --> 01:36:59.086
These are highly talented, highly motivated.

01:36:59.106 --> 01:37:01.786
That's happening today or the potential to do that is there?

01:37:01.927 --> 01:37:07.408
If what we found with the Dalai Lama and our other kind of open source operations is indicative of what's out there.

01:37:07.448 --> 01:37:08.048
It's out there.

01:37:08.648 --> 01:37:09.449
It exists today.

01:37:09.789 --> 01:37:14.590
There are many cases where we don't know what's happening and we are all capable of being targeted and take it down.

01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:17.993
Software and technology has democratized espionage.

01:37:18.514 --> 01:37:26.142
So what would have taken a large governmental organization now can be done with two or three teenagers in a coffee shop.

01:37:26.462 --> 01:37:30.466
The biggest question that you as a president would have to, if you were president,

01:37:32.488 --> 01:37:33.429
You would have to decide.

01:37:33.869 --> 01:37:36.531
An organization in America is being taken down, okay?

01:37:36.671 --> 01:37:37.852
We know it's being taken down.

01:37:38.232 --> 01:37:39.052
What is the response?

01:37:39.593 --> 01:37:45.517
That person has gotten inside an organization with significant security and been able to obfuscate who they are.

01:37:45.937 --> 01:37:48.318
Doesn't that sound like the John Le Carre novels you read?

01:37:48.358 --> 01:37:49.239
Of course it does.

01:37:49.299 --> 01:37:52.061
But now you don't need to be a governmental organization.

01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:53.842
You can be a single teenager.

01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:56.343
Now, you as the president, to go back to the example, how do you respond?

01:37:56.363 --> 01:37:56.964
This is incredible.

01:37:57.684 --> 01:38:19.240
I'm sorry, but I find it really incredible how parallel this is to the nonsense narrative of a gain-of-function virus that could in theory be built in the garage of an endeavorous biologist, which is what Robert Malone has said repeatedly, including one time speaking in some form in some building in the UK Parliament.

01:38:20.703 --> 01:38:28.166
sitting next to Pierre Corey and Ryan Cole, I believe was also there.

01:38:28.706 --> 01:38:31.788
I would have to look in whether Meryl Nass was also there, probably.

01:38:31.808 --> 01:38:35.269
And they each gave a little talk.

01:38:35.349 --> 01:38:47.234
And one of the things that Robert Malone said was, is that somebody with a bachelor's degree in biology and some equipment off of eBay could make a gain-of-function virus in their garage.

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:51.902
It's incredible.

01:38:51.922 --> 01:38:51.902
2009, 2021.

01:39:01.917 --> 01:39:06.340
organization, you call up and say, look, you either stop or we're going to come after you.

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.861
But what if it's a teenager?

01:39:08.061 --> 01:39:10.603
And before you've solved that issue, you cannot respond.

01:39:11.103 --> 01:39:12.304
And this is a major issue.

01:39:12.504 --> 01:39:21.951
OK, but it's part of your ability to see up to see around the corner then in terms of before something before they take it down, you can see patterns of people and or actions and or.

01:39:22.631 --> 01:39:23.231
behavior?

01:39:23.552 --> 01:39:28.895
Well, what we do is we help people like we did with the Dalai Lama figure out if you actually have been infiltrated.

01:39:28.975 --> 01:39:30.516
So what kind of data is leaving?

01:39:30.636 --> 01:39:31.297
And they have been.

01:39:31.557 --> 01:39:32.037
They had been.

01:39:32.297 --> 01:39:33.198
And in a massive way.

01:39:33.438 --> 01:39:38.322
But then, too, we say these people are likely to actually be this.

01:39:38.522 --> 01:39:44.506
They appear to be teenagers, but they are teenagers that are likely being handled by this organization.

01:39:45.286 --> 01:39:48.268
Oh, teenagers get handled by organizations.

01:39:48.368 --> 01:39:49.609
Isn't that interesting?

01:39:49.649 --> 01:39:52.411
Because I thought you just said teenagers can do it.

01:39:53.392 --> 01:39:58.177
So wait, now you're telling me that teenagers are actually also ops run by other people?

01:39:58.718 --> 01:40:11.692
Now that's a really interesting thing because I think that there is a mom out there who's an op and I think her daughter might have been allowed to be used as an op since she was a minor, which is actually really scary.

01:40:13.283 --> 01:40:29.433
from the perspective of somebody who has been interviewed four times by the Corona Investigative Committee in Germany, has been interviewed multiple times by Shannon Joy, has been interviewed multiple times by, well, why?

01:40:31.244 --> 01:40:39.326
Why, if her minor teenage daughter might've been used by some other entity to be a spy?

01:40:39.346 --> 01:40:45.667
I mean, how in the hell is it possible that this guy's talking so specifically about teenagers on the internet?

01:40:46.627 --> 01:40:58.810
And someone who's supposed to be riding in on a white horse with Robert Malone has a teenager on the internet, an underage teenager on the internet that was promoted by Alex Jones in 2019 multiple times.

01:41:02.967 --> 01:41:04.825
Are we really supposed to ignore that?

01:41:09.275 --> 01:41:13.338
Because in one side of his mouth, he says that, well, it could just be a bunch of teenagers.

01:41:13.398 --> 01:41:17.681
And it's not even a... It used to be that you needed a big government to run a spy ring.

01:41:17.721 --> 01:41:19.362
Now you just need a couple of teenagers.

01:41:19.462 --> 01:41:22.324
Maybe a couple of teenagers that know how to edit video.

01:41:22.844 --> 01:41:25.005
You know, one on camera and one off camera.

01:41:25.026 --> 01:41:32.330
Maybe you could have the girl on camera dress up like a Muslim sometimes and dress up like an acidic Jew some other times.

01:41:32.370 --> 01:41:39.235
And then you could have the voice off camera be a guy who's like queuing up all the things that they're going to show later in the edit.

01:41:41.215 --> 01:41:45.016
Maybe they could be influenced by someone else that this guy's not gonna mention.

01:41:45.076 --> 01:41:46.957
Some weaponized pile of money, who knows?

01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:55.979
Maybe just people who want to create the chaos necessary to disorganize the American Republic enough to destroy it.

01:41:58.039 --> 01:42:01.760
It'd be so weird, right, if they used like teenagers from Russia or Ukraine.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:02.740
That would be nuts.

01:42:05.697 --> 01:42:11.681
Or more likely, when you're done with our diagnostic, we say, we are not sure who they are, but we are sure they are in this building.

01:42:11.922 --> 01:42:13.963
Why don't you send someone to go find out who they are?

01:42:13.983 --> 01:42:18.747
Why isn't this going to collide head-on into privacy and civil liberties?

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:23.608
Well, it would if there was a contradiction between finding terrorists and protecting civil liberties.

01:42:23.668 --> 01:42:30.031
But the exact same transparency you can use to find terrorists, you can use to see what the government's using.

01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:38.135
The central question, in my view, of civil liberties is how – it's not if the government has data, because let's assume the government has as much data as a health insurance company.

01:42:38.775 --> 01:42:39.896
How is that data being used?

01:42:40.276 --> 01:42:41.837
Is it being used in a way that's lawful?

01:42:42.098 --> 01:42:43.759
Meaning, do they have the right to use it?

01:42:43.839 --> 01:42:46.501
And is it being migrated into places it's not allowed to be used?

01:42:46.701 --> 01:42:50.804
We allow the enforcement of rules that government ought to enforce.

01:42:50.844 --> 01:42:54.407
And by the way, my experience is they want to enforce, or at the very least know they need to enforce.

01:42:54.847 --> 01:43:01.192
And if it's framed in that way, then you can have what is the ultimate Silicon Valley solution.

01:43:01.232 --> 01:43:03.454
You remove the contradiction, and we all march forward.

01:43:03.754 --> 01:43:04.675
It's extraordinary stuff.

01:43:04.735 --> 01:43:05.495
Thank you for coming.

01:43:06.977 --> 01:43:07.277
Wow.

01:43:08.558 --> 01:43:09.839
I think I'm gonna start cutting carbs.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:10.880
I need to drop my belt.

01:43:11.061 --> 01:43:11.521
Wow.

01:43:11.721 --> 01:43:17.287
I mean, I don't even know what to tell you other than that is just gross and you must see it as gross, right?

01:43:17.307 --> 01:43:17.587
That's...

01:43:20.799 --> 01:43:26.043
It's just very obvious to me now that we have a very big problem on our hands and a lot of people don't want to talk about it.

01:43:26.083 --> 01:43:29.665
There are a lot of people who simply will not talk about it.

01:43:29.705 --> 01:43:31.006
I didn't take any notes today.

01:43:31.066 --> 01:43:31.806
I apologize.

01:43:31.846 --> 01:43:33.948
I was listening and ranting too much.

01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:41.353
I will say that we do need to stay focused on the biology.

01:43:41.413 --> 01:43:45.015
We do need to stay focused on what they are doing to us.

01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:49.058
I started with this slide because I do think it's important.

01:43:51.259 --> 01:43:58.805
It is really of utmost importance that we understand that these people were set in front of us to mislead our children.

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:05.451
To mislead our children, it's a multi-generational narrative that they are protecting.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:24.251
And I believe a transition is coming where some of these people are going to be queued up to tell us how bad the old vaccine schedule was, but how maybe there's some new ones that will work, or maybe we can replace it with vaccines that work better, because none of these people are anti-vaccine.

01:44:24.271 --> 01:44:26.132
They just want vaccines that work.

01:44:26.573 --> 01:44:28.174
They want vaccines that work well.

01:44:29.249 --> 01:44:38.355
And they all say that because they are misleading the young into believing that vaccination is a laudable goal, often achievable, but not always.

01:44:39.396 --> 01:44:41.898
And the better we get at it, the less people will get hurt.

01:44:42.038 --> 01:44:47.622
That's the narrative that all of these liars are trying to get us to teach to our children.

01:44:47.662 --> 01:44:48.722
And that is a lie.

01:44:49.263 --> 01:44:51.784
The vaccine schedule in America is criminal.

01:44:52.325 --> 01:44:53.726
What I want is high morbidity.

01:44:54.246 --> 01:44:55.247
I want people to complain.

01:44:55.327 --> 01:44:56.808
And they have been gaming

01:44:57.842 --> 01:45:09.666
a narrative that would allow them to admit that over a 10-year period, allow them to transition to genetic testing on the masses over a 10-year period, and that narrative is the plandemic.

01:45:10.347 --> 01:45:26.773
The plandemic has been curated by certain people that now can be seen more clearly than they could at the beginning of the pandemic because their patterns of behavior and their interaction and reinforcing of each other's ideas has now revealed them for the limited spectrum of debate that they are.

01:45:27.213 --> 01:45:37.299
They don't talk about murder being lied about in order to create the illusion of a pandemic, even though that's the most obvious military PSYOP of all.

01:45:37.959 --> 01:45:50.487
Instead, they give you a very limited perspective where somebody like me is a military PSYOP, or somebody like Sasha Latupova all by herself is a PSYOP that Robert Malone is sick and tired of.

01:45:51.545 --> 01:46:09.363
No, ladies and gentlemen, the PSYOP is a coordinated group of liars that pretends to contradict each other, pretends to oppose each other, pretends to argue with each other, and they argue about very specific things like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or early treatment or masks.

01:46:09.443 --> 01:46:14.948
They do not argue about murder being lied about in order to create the illusion of a pandemic.

01:46:15.729 --> 01:46:23.777
and they never consider the possibility of placebo batches or consider the possibility of a background signal being misconstrued as spread.

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:35.648
Even Kevin McKernan in April of 2024 was already more nuanced than that and able to say that there are background signals, but they can change and become what is now spreading.

01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:44.251
He was very concise and very, very specific in his protection of the faith novel virus already in April, 2024.

01:46:45.811 --> 01:46:52.252
And they all share the same pattern because this illusion is created by their work, by them.

01:46:52.392 --> 01:46:58.254
Their chorus of lies is the limited spectrum of debate and the cage that we are stuck in.

01:46:58.834 --> 01:47:04.515
And it dates back all the way to the twenties to Edward Bernays, when he said the conscious and intelligent manipulation

01:47:05.075 --> 01:47:10.077
of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

01:47:10.637 --> 01:47:19.641
This is exactly what we heard from Alec Karp when he said that he's interested in the issues of how we know something and whether citizens can participate or not.

01:47:20.121 --> 01:47:25.223
It is exactly the control of information, the manipulation of our opinions,

01:47:25.803 --> 01:47:35.590
that has been done to us from the very beginning by a coordinated chorus of liars, put in place to make sure that this military operation would be successful.

01:47:35.630 --> 01:47:45.417
And now that their operation is breaking down, the only thing that they have left is to attribute bad motives to the people who were not sucked in and were not fooled.

01:47:48.168 --> 01:47:55.954
Their goal has always been to prevent our ability to say no, our ability to exercise informed noncompliance.

01:47:56.514 --> 01:48:15.849
And that's really what Robert Malone is trying to prevent from the very beginning, from 2021, where he is very smiley and happy to talk to Neely and Cottrell, Cottrell being the fakest of fake MD doctors there ever was, promoted by the fakest of fake journalists, George Webb.

01:48:18.797 --> 01:48:24.979
and opposed by the fakest biologist in the universe, probably Kevin McCairn.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:37.844
It's all one little group of liars that is coordinated from who knows where, sticking to the same story that we just solved the mystery that they were covering up a lab leak.

01:48:38.544 --> 01:48:47.747
And there's at least 11 different things in the spike protein alone or in the genome alone that cause specific disease symptoms, but we've never bothered to track them.

01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:53.752
And these narratives are repeated over many years by many people that shouldn't be repeating them.

01:48:53.792 --> 01:48:59.337
The same person, for example, who advocates for the UNESCO human rights things.

01:49:00.317 --> 01:49:03.300
Mary Holland is as big a fake as there ever was.

01:49:05.202 --> 01:49:10.186
Look at the statement that she sent to the Czech government about vaccines.

01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:21.336
Doesn't say anything about the vaccine schedule in America being criminally, obviously, a terrible thing in comparison to any other.

01:49:21.376 --> 01:49:22.276
They've never said it.

01:49:22.356 --> 01:49:23.097
They never will.

01:49:23.977 --> 01:49:28.640
Because their goal is to make sure that you get into the hamster wheel and run very vigorously.

01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.761
Make sure you run hard every day.

01:49:33.373 --> 01:49:36.496
And that hamster wheel has been in existence for a long time.

01:49:36.556 --> 01:49:44.624
It's a hamster wheel about pandemic potential in bat caves, in cell culture, in animal passage, and in genetic stitching.

01:49:45.365 --> 01:49:52.712
And it is a worst-case scenario story about a gain-of-function laboratory leak, which permanently gives them this excuse for

01:49:53.533 --> 01:49:55.194
for public health to exist.

01:49:55.734 --> 01:50:23.087
And even someone like Ralph Baric's career and list of literature can be explained simply as his job was to seed the narrative of pandemic potential, just like Mark Denison's job was to seed the narrative of pandemic potential, doing experiments and disproving null hypotheses, which seem to confirm using p-values that in the far end of the spectrum, there is pandemic potential.

01:50:24.195 --> 01:50:28.618
And that pandemic potential has also been codified in book after book after book.

01:50:28.678 --> 01:50:30.419
The best one up here is probably this one.

01:50:30.939 --> 01:50:43.326
If you're gonna buy one of these yet that you haven't bought, buy this one, because although this one has something about gain of function viruses in it, it's mostly about how liars are trying to take over and destroy America.

01:50:43.406 --> 01:50:52.231
So I do think that of all those books, that's the one you ought to buy, unless you're specifically interested in seeing how my biology has been

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:59.929
Has been incorporated and not incorporated into the Wuhan cover up over there.

01:50:59.989 --> 01:51:00.389
That one.

01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:02.770
Because there is biology of mine in there.

01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:05.271
There are some statements in there that I've made.

01:51:05.311 --> 01:51:06.191
There's some quotes in there.

01:51:06.211 --> 01:51:08.632
So that might be a fun book if you're interested in that.

01:51:10.293 --> 01:51:11.333
This is how it was done.

01:51:11.413 --> 01:51:13.114
So Ralph Baric is number one.

01:51:14.635 --> 01:51:19.456
Number two is basically Dark Winter all the way through Event 201.

01:51:22.133 --> 01:51:26.843
Number three are the things that they did in New York City and in the UK.

01:51:28.708 --> 01:51:40.454
Number four is people like Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Kevin McCarran, Charles Rixey, all the people on that screen where I say they are misleading the young.

01:51:41.115 --> 01:51:43.376
All of those people are team worst case scenario.

01:51:43.916 --> 01:51:50.619
Number five is how they co-opted people like Pierre Cory because it was a national security operation.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.460
So you're either going to help us or you're not.

01:51:53.061 --> 01:51:54.802
And if you're not, you can go back to Wisconsin.

01:51:54.822 --> 01:51:56.983
But if you're going to help us, there might be a book deal in it for you.

01:51:57.763 --> 01:52:11.731
And the end goal is number six, which is the toxicity of a virus and a gain-of-function protein was going to be confounded with transfection and transformation so that they could say that the next generation of this technology is awful, awful, awful good.

01:52:12.812 --> 01:52:13.713
And that's where we are.

01:52:13.753 --> 01:52:20.957
That's why they're complaining about the double-stranded DNA contamination in the shot, because that's a problem they can solve.

01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:38.165
The problem they can't solve is that lipid nanoparticles go everywhere, and lipid nanoparticles, when they enter a certain pH, become highly toxic and can damage DNA in mitochondria and in the nucleus, can destroy and disrupt lipid membranes, etc.

01:52:38.185 --> 01:52:39.527
They don't talk about any of that.

01:52:40.646 --> 01:52:45.569
because the goal is to make sure that you think that they can clean up the shot.

01:52:45.669 --> 01:53:00.517
And that's why Kevin McKernan is still actively touring with Steve Kirsch and doing podcasts where they incorporate Byron Brittle, so that Byron Brittle thinks that he's still doing all that he can.

01:53:00.958 --> 01:53:05.380
But in reality, the main narrative is being pushed, that the transfection was rushed.

01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:09.683
They used a process two, which resulted in contamination.

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:12.524
And there's SV40 and all this other stuff in there.

01:53:12.564 --> 01:53:15.566
And so obviously, this is a really big problem.

01:53:15.586 --> 01:53:20.888
And eventually, they're going to show you that the DNA integrated into somebody's cells.

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:24.750
And then they're going to tell you that now we have to just do personalized RNA forever.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:43.407
and it's gonna be more expensive, but we're gonna be more pure, and we're never gonna use that awful process two again, because we don't need to make antibodies anymore anyway, so we don't need process two for any other biologics, so we might as well throw it out and pretend that we're capitulating and we're admitting that we made a mistake.

01:53:43.488 --> 01:53:45.608
That's the exact theater that's coming.

01:53:46.049 --> 01:53:53.612
So record this as a clip, put it somewhere on your desktop so you can play it in a year or two years and hear how, just like we called,

01:53:54.656 --> 01:54:04.079
the inversion of the spike for transfection damage almost four years ago and set people on their first conniptions.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:17.464
But now we are predicting again that they are going to admit that the old vaccine schedule wasn't as good as the new one could be, and that the new one is gonna be even better after they solve the problem of process two.

01:54:18.835 --> 01:54:19.916
coming ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:19.976 --> 01:54:29.404
Even Pfizer might be thrown under the bus in order to make sure that everybody gets the word that they're fixing the transfections for the better.

01:54:30.424 --> 01:54:35.428
And that's again why Robert Malone is fading in here right now because

01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:37.670
That's who did it.

01:54:38.231 --> 01:54:39.572
That's who's doing it right now.

01:54:40.192 --> 01:54:48.539
Perpetuating how the pandemic was created and make sure that we never look back effectively enough to question the pretense of the pandemic.

01:54:49.359 --> 01:54:58.527
The pretense of the pandemic, which is a novel spreading pathogen that none of us have ever seen before, was obfuscated by people pretending to help us.

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:08.423
pretending to be essential to the dissident movement, pretending to have really important things to say when they did not.

01:55:09.203 --> 01:55:13.264
Because the really important thing to say was, is that RNA virology is an illusion.

01:55:15.365 --> 01:55:20.547
And that PCR, while if used correctly, can be highly accurate.

01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:26.935
If used disingenuously on a background that was previously characterized, these people could lie about almost anything.

01:55:27.375 --> 01:55:33.379
And no one in four and a half years has been able to succinctly say this except for GigaOM Biological.

01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:34.340
That's just the truth.

01:55:37.442 --> 01:55:40.545
And we didn't even know how well we were saying it when we were saying it in 2021.

01:55:41.025 --> 01:55:43.807
And that's why a lot of these people were able to

01:55:46.638 --> 01:55:49.539
break me in and out of my stride for the last three years.

01:55:49.619 --> 01:55:57.201
But these bad idea spreaders are the only problem, and if we just start ignoring them, then we can pull our heads out.

01:55:57.882 --> 01:56:08.365
This coordinated lying is exactly how a Scooby-Doo mystery of ridiculous proportions was created, and how it ended up becoming the PBS NewsHour.

01:56:09.025 --> 01:56:12.709
with coordinated symphonies of liars.

01:56:12.769 --> 01:56:27.963
The Lollapalooza of liars that it didn't matter what stage you went on or what band you cheered for, you were basically going to hear one of the three TV scenarios about a bat cave virus or a laboratory virus or a laboratory virus that was manipulated and then released.

01:56:28.424 --> 01:56:31.106
And we've been dealing with this for five years now.

01:56:32.219 --> 01:56:35.320
It's a biological phenomenon with no precedence in history.

01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:50.885
But yeah, as long as all these people agree to agree upon it, then an illusion of consensus is created across parties, across nations, across governments, that there was a novel virus that caused excess deaths.

01:56:50.945 --> 01:56:56.027
And people start ignoring that all of these other things contributed massively to their

01:56:56.963 --> 01:56:58.424
being able to murder people.

01:56:58.544 --> 01:57:04.367
Manslaughter was done en masse to create mass casualty events in a few places.

01:57:04.867 --> 01:57:12.872
And then a coordinated group of people across the spectrum have been getting us to ask the wrong questions for three years, four years.

01:57:13.952 --> 01:57:14.933
That's how it happened.

01:57:16.363 --> 01:57:23.846
Asking the wrong questions, and there were lots of people asking the wrong questions, just like asking whether or not there was a Holocaust is the wrong question.

01:57:24.306 --> 01:57:28.907
Just like asking whether or not there are planes on 9-11 is asking the wrong question.

01:57:28.947 --> 01:57:34.969
Just like asking whether or not there was a bomb and the Oklahoma City bombing is asking the wrong question.

01:57:35.029 --> 01:57:45.133
And just like asking whether it was a lab leak or a natural virus and they're covering it up is the wrong set of questions, because they just murdered people and lied about it.

01:57:49.045 --> 01:57:57.167
And the people who are actively touring the world, lying about it by curating a limited spectrum of debate, a lot of them are on this screen.

01:57:57.647 --> 01:57:59.688
I don't think Byron Bridle is one of them.

01:57:59.868 --> 01:58:04.209
I don't think that Denny Rancourt is one of them.

01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.649
He could be.

01:58:05.749 --> 01:58:08.630
I'm pretty, pretty sure that Nick is not one of them.

01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:12.411
And I'm on the fence about Ryan Cole.

01:58:13.211 --> 01:58:17.072
But Robert Malone, Harvey Reich,

01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:28.243
Steven Hatfill, Epi Girl, Bret Weinstein, Meryl Nass, and Jill Glass Poole Malone are 100%

01:58:32.345 --> 01:58:55.755
100% participating in whatever weaponized piles of money are trying to invert our sovereignty to permissions and trying to essentially neutralize all the republics of the West at once under the guise of necessity, under the guise of private-public partnership, under the guise of international treaties.

01:58:55.935 --> 01:58:57.375
It's all nonsense.

01:58:57.475 --> 01:58:58.516
They are liars.

01:59:00.512 --> 01:59:13.359
And we could be as very simple as Uwe Auschner said it yesterday, if we all fight for America and America survives this, America can preserve freedom of the West.

01:59:15.179 --> 01:59:20.642
And in the meantime, we can help nations like the UK and Canada pull their heads out.

01:59:22.983 --> 01:59:23.844
I think it's possible.

01:59:25.299 --> 01:59:42.045
But I'm pretty sure that these people invited these people to Romania so that they could pretend that they heard them and that they could step in front of them and make sure that their real message, which is that there was no risk additive spreading pathogen that caused excess deaths anywhere on earth.

01:59:42.505 --> 01:59:49.008
But there were a lot of bad ideas, bad protocols, and bad incentives spreading around the world that definitely did kill people.

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:51.329
And now these people are all lying about it.

01:59:51.429 --> 01:59:54.690
And they continue to lie about it in front of the United States Senate.

01:59:55.666 --> 02:00:00.608
Or at least a meeting called by the United... I don't know.

02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:07.510
They lied about this screen.

02:00:09.451 --> 02:00:11.571
Our hypothesis hasn't changed in a while.

02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:20.996
They lied about what happened here in order for us to believe that transfection worked in healthy humans, but it was rushed.

02:00:21.076 --> 02:00:27.303
And that's what all these people are doing now with the double-stranded DNA and whether or not it integrated into anybody.

02:00:27.343 --> 02:00:30.426
How the hell are you going to find out where it integrated in a living person?

02:00:33.496 --> 02:00:44.122
RNA can cause a pandemic is the other thing that Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass all agree on.

02:00:44.362 --> 02:00:54.808
And Stephen Hatfield and David Baltimore and Bob Gallo and all of these other monsters agree on.

02:00:56.428 --> 02:01:13.469
Hilary Kaprowski is one of the first people to have told the story of a bat cave zoonosis from bat feces in 1960s at a conference called the future of mankind organized by Lederberg.

02:01:14.391 --> 02:01:15.332
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:01:20.438 --> 02:01:21.879
We are breaking this narrative.

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.384
RNA cannot pandemic and transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:01:26.404 --> 02:01:30.048
And a lot of these people knew and a lot more professionals should have known.

02:01:30.068 --> 02:01:33.131
And it's time that we call out the lies for what they are.

02:01:33.171 --> 02:01:38.436
They are murder and they lied about it in order to make us believe that a pandemic occurred.

02:01:39.097 --> 02:01:39.998
That's what this is.

02:01:47.717 --> 02:01:48.577
Sorry about the bell.

02:01:48.637 --> 02:01:49.498
That's my front door.

02:01:49.518 --> 02:01:51.159
I think the kids are running around up there.

02:01:52.559 --> 02:01:55.901
Ladies and gentlemen, our hypothesis, again, hasn't changed.

02:01:56.961 --> 02:02:03.644
The goal is total surrender of individual sovereignty and enforcement of global inversion from basic human rights to basic granted permissions.

02:02:04.265 --> 02:02:14.449
Ladies and gentlemen, one thing you can do is make sure that nobody transfects themselves again, especially college kids who are vulnerable to the social media as we speak.

02:02:17.051 --> 02:02:24.135
Elimination of the control group is still very important, but you might think of the control group now as people that just get it.

02:02:24.776 --> 02:02:30.259
People that understand that we are being governed by lies, and that's the control group now.

02:02:30.279 --> 02:02:37.443
If you don't subscribe to the continued inoculation of your brain,

02:02:39.335 --> 02:02:42.956
If you like what we're doing here at GigaOM Biological, please take the time to share this work.

02:02:42.996 --> 02:02:48.558
You can find it at stream.gigaom.bio where all the music, all the stuff, nothing is ever cut.

02:02:48.998 --> 02:02:52.999
And if there are any errors, I always replace the video there first.

02:02:53.039 --> 02:03:00.081
You can go to gigaom.bio for a Twitter-like experience where we interact and chat and talk about stuff.

02:03:00.141 --> 02:03:03.122
And Pamela shares all kinds of links that everybody should be reading.

02:03:03.942 --> 02:03:16.686
And if you want to support my work, you can go to GigaOMBiological.com and scroll down about half a screen, and you can see lots of different options for giving one time or regularly, and anything would be greatly appreciated.

02:03:16.726 --> 02:03:17.987
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:03:18.567 --> 02:03:30.651
Again, this has been GigaOMBiological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist, and that biologist is Jonathan Cooey, and I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, actually Bethel Park,

02:03:31.551 --> 02:03:36.397
in the south part of the Pittsburgh area, below the rivers.

02:03:37.738 --> 02:03:40.241
And I'll see you again tomorrow, hopefully at 10.10 on time.

02:03:40.261 --> 02:03:41.723
Happy Memorial Day.

02:03:41.743 --> 02:03:48.370
I hope you have sunshine and I hope you can enjoy the company of friends and family.

02:03:50.453 --> 02:03:50.993
Thank you very much.

02:03:51.013 --> 02:03:52.015
See you again tomorrow.
