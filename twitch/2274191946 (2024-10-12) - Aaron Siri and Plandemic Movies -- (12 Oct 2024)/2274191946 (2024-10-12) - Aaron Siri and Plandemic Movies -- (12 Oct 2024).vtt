WEBVTT

01:07.429 --> 01:07.489
you

01:48.552 --> 01:48.752
you

02:43.929 --> 03:05.622
Music is a world within itself With a language we all understand

03:09.721 --> 03:10.342
and clap their hands.

04:02.694 --> 04:09.596
Music knows it is and always will be one of the things that life just won't quit.

04:11.456 --> 04:18.978
But here are some of music's pioneers that time will not allow us to forget now.

04:19.618 --> 04:23.479
There's Basie, Miller, Satomo, and the king of all surdoos.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.020
And with a voice like gallop ringing out, there's no way the band could lose.

05:07.296 --> 05:07.557
Woo!

06:55.940 --> 06:57.942
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

06:57.962 --> 07:03.726
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:05.127 --> 07:06.848
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

07:08.473 --> 07:09.177
It's embarrassing.

07:19.102 --> 07:20.363
Good morning, everybody.

07:20.443 --> 07:21.244
Welcome to the show.

07:21.284 --> 07:26.449
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:27.310 --> 07:34.798
It feels a lot like a hamster wheel that we're in as we jump from our bed to our television, from work to our television to our bed.

07:34.858 --> 07:38.301
It feels like a hamster wheel, and that is how it's designed to feel.

07:38.882 --> 07:54.360
because your consciousness is the prime real estate they've been competing for for the many decades that we've been alive and never before has it been so easy to occupy it especially our attention being so shortened by all the shorts that we watch all the videos and commercials and

07:54.901 --> 08:05.307
These charlatans have been working against us for decades already, and that's why it really feels as though we're waking up to an illusion of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.028
But it's not that.

08:07.088 --> 08:09.950
It's these guys and the stories that they've been telling us.

08:10.030 --> 08:12.671
More importantly, the stories they've been telling our parents.

08:13.172 --> 08:14.732
And that's why we are trapped.

08:14.812 --> 08:16.273
The way out is very simple.

08:16.734 --> 08:22.017
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to teach our kids that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances

08:22.697 --> 08:25.940
with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:26.561 --> 08:36.911
We need to teach our kids that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and we need to teach our kids that RNA can't pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

08:37.552 --> 08:40.975
If our children understand this, they will not be enslaved by it.

08:41.656 --> 08:44.898
There is no mystery virus that explains these excess deaths.

08:44.938 --> 08:48.941
These excess deaths are explained by murder and lies and by expectations.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.644
Expectations because of bigger families after World War II.

08:53.085 --> 08:55.967
And that's why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.350
And that's why these lawyers won't talk about any useful way to get out in America.

09:00.430 --> 09:02.752
America being the only way out left.

09:04.787 --> 09:08.012
I think we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

09:08.032 --> 09:10.577
I think we need a new consensus about transfection.

09:11.098 --> 09:14.423
And I think we need a new consensus about the biology of RNA.

09:14.864 --> 09:15.725
And I hope to help.

09:17.208 --> 09:24.530
I hope to help get us there because they have created this illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

09:24.570 --> 09:25.971
That's how we are being governed.

09:26.491 --> 09:39.254
That is the new kind of totalitarianism that actually is very old and dates back to the 60s, to the 50s, to the 30s, to the 40s, where they never even imagined that they would have social media within which to imprison us.

09:40.115 --> 09:44.816
And we have been fooled by these acolytes and we need to shed them.

09:45.882 --> 09:48.283
We need to shed these acolytes.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.164
I'm gonna play a song.

09:50.184 --> 09:52.825
I wonder if anybody will even recognize it.

09:55.246 --> 10:02.369
Five years ago this month is when I actually was told not to come in to the University of Pittsburgh anymore.

10:02.429 --> 10:03.790
Don't come into the med school.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.631
Don't continue your research.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.652
Everything should stop because we feel scared.

10:09.632 --> 10:12.774
We feel threatened by you coming in.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.151
That used to be my theme song.

10:18.191 --> 10:35.079
Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to a former academic biologist whose work, years and years of work, is still available freely on the National Library of Medicine's website, PubMed, where you can search for C-O-U-E-Y-J-J, and you will find all of that work.

10:35.099 --> 10:36.699
You will see that I was a neuroscientist.

10:36.779 --> 10:38.700
I worked in the Netherlands.

10:38.780 --> 10:39.701
I worked in Norway.

10:42.042 --> 10:55.088
And I worked at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in the Department of Neurobiology doing experiments where I recorded from individuals and pairs of neurons trying to characterize the connectivity between them.

10:55.108 --> 11:00.051
And actually GigaOM Biological, the name comes from that methodology.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.934
And yeah, so now I have this website.

11:03.974 --> 11:19.846
You can find all kinds of links there at the homepage including links about the Biology 101 course we're developing, the books that are in it, significant videos of other people, and of course videos from my friend Mark Kulak at Housatonic ITS.

11:21.828 --> 11:23.429
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.390
This one is a big one.

11:25.070 --> 11:26.731
I'm very excited about this show.

11:29.019 --> 11:32.322
Allie Kat, you did the right homework today, I can tell you that right now.

11:34.805 --> 11:41.151
You did the right homework, that is indeed the focus of the show today.

11:41.171 --> 11:51.722
I have been reading and working very hard behind the scenes for quite some time already, trying to figure this out, and I don't do it alone.

11:54.175 --> 11:55.457
Of course, I don't do it alone.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.438
I have a lot of friends.

11:57.799 --> 12:03.405
I used to have this really good friend named Nathan who was a lawyer, an intellectual property lawyer in Chicago.

12:03.445 --> 12:04.607
We went to college together.

12:04.627 --> 12:05.047
I ended up

12:05.959 --> 12:09.240
weirdly meeting him as being his calculus tutor.

12:09.320 --> 12:14.101
And I actually was the calculus tutor for him and his would-be wife.

12:14.621 --> 12:26.543
And I was, let's say, you know, in that sort of young male way involved in the scheming and planning about how it was that he was going to slowly meet this girl.

12:27.563 --> 12:31.604
And, you know, like he was in love with her from the very beginning.

12:31.724 --> 12:31.784
And,

12:33.962 --> 12:40.406
And he's gone now, and his daughters and his wife are living without him because of the lies that these people told.

12:40.586 --> 12:43.947
Because I couldn't convince him not to transfect himself.

12:45.348 --> 12:54.493
Because the skillful use of social media and the skillful watching of television allowed him to believe that I was the crazy one.

12:55.734 --> 13:02.938
And about a month and a half before he died of an aneurysm, he was in my house in Pittsburgh laughing at me, asking me, how in the world was this

13:04.079 --> 13:07.780
whatever I was doing gonna possibly last long into the future.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.841
Like, how is this a plan to take care of your children?

13:11.621 --> 13:14.322
And I tried to explain to him that, like, what else are you gonna do?

13:14.362 --> 13:16.503
There's... This is it.

13:18.003 --> 13:19.103
This is the big one.

13:20.284 --> 13:22.384
The people that we've been waiting for are us.

13:24.505 --> 13:24.625
And...

13:25.487 --> 13:31.290
He very incredulously said, so do you think that I'm still in danger of dying from the shot that I took?

13:31.350 --> 13:34.931
And I said, absolutely, with 100% certainty, yes, I do.

13:36.772 --> 13:40.374
And a month and a half later, he did indeed die of an aneurysm.

13:40.414 --> 13:44.015
And, you know, there's never, no one's ever going to accept my explanation for it.

13:45.076 --> 13:49.458
Maybe some of them will, some of them won't, but it's a question that nobody really wants the answer to.

13:50.703 --> 14:02.927
Nobody that was sufficiently fooled for sufficiently long enough so that they participated in some aspect of this nasty theater on their own, wittingly or unwittingly.

14:04.208 --> 14:09.230
Nobody wants to look back and feel that and see that.

14:09.410 --> 14:18.053
And I've already done it and you've already done it and they all need to do it if we are going to free our grandchildren from this trap before it closes.

14:20.911 --> 14:28.553
One of the nastiest parts of this trap is, sorry, is the social media.

14:30.598 --> 14:49.864
And that's the reason why the biology that I've been teaching for the last going on really five years now has been ignored by these people, has been diluted or titrated in such a way to protect what I didn't understand was a very elaborate theater.

14:50.624 --> 14:55.586
A limited spectrum of debate with all kinds of very vigorous debates within it.

14:57.178 --> 15:05.665
like a little tempest in a teapot or a teacup or a Tupperware that has a little thunderstorm inside of it.

15:05.845 --> 15:14.011
And if you're inside that Tupperware and you don't know it, you can be put safely in the refrigerator and separated from all the other food and you'll last a really long time.

15:14.952 --> 15:20.517
And no one will ever know what you're fighting in that little Tupperware inside of social media.

15:20.577 --> 15:25.681
What people you're retweeting or who you're arguing with is one little tiny bubble.

15:26.789 --> 15:33.675
And I had no idea that all of these people were working together until nearly four years in.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.578
And that's the reason why you have to hear it like this.

15:40.120 --> 15:47.245
Weaponized piles of money have gotten us to argue with them or their acolytes on social media.

15:47.385 --> 15:51.489
Arguing with their acolytes has gotten us to accept the narrative.

15:52.523 --> 16:02.354
And that narrative includes a mythology that was already being laid out and developed decades ago in the AIDS crisis, chronic fatigue syndrome.

16:03.475 --> 16:08.901
And that's why Judy Mikovits and Robert Malone have the same mentor chain.

16:10.211 --> 16:16.416
and are part of the same illusion that Mickey Willis has been crafting since the beginning of the pandemic.

16:16.877 --> 16:18.999
That's why they're in all those movies together.

16:19.039 --> 16:21.641
That's why they've never actually been on stage before.

16:22.041 --> 16:36.353
Have you never asked yourself why it is that Robert Malone has gone on an international tour for the last five years with an exclusive cast of Meryl Nass and Sasha Latupova and Pierre Kory and Jessica Rose?

16:37.194 --> 16:41.176
All the same people from the beginning all the way until Japan a week ago.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.418
It's because they are this.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.382
That's how you explain it and that's why it's so easy.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.984
It's Fauci, it's Daisak, it's Malone, it's Nas.

16:58.564 --> 17:00.885
They're all the same theater.

17:02.246 --> 17:04.467
And they're all hiding the same truth.

17:06.684 --> 17:18.390
that after World War II, the success of the American family, the prosperity of the American family, the Brady Bunch, this was a problem for them.

17:18.450 --> 17:33.397
And so for a decade or two or three, they've been fighting this success in America, these big families in America, encouraging people to be, you know, maybe alternative lifestyles, maybe don't have kids, maybe you're gay, maybe you're trans.

17:36.055 --> 17:44.719
Maybe you've been too promiscuous your whole life to ever fall in love usefully enough to create children that will also have the model to create children.

17:44.759 --> 17:45.240
Do you see?

17:46.220 --> 17:48.221
It's a multi-generational game.

17:48.661 --> 18:03.049
And one of the multi-generational signals that they want you to not be aware of is that they knew that for a decade or so there would be an increase in all-cause mortality because we have an excess number of people from a particular generation after World War II.

18:03.809 --> 18:18.112
and that excess amount of people was gonna cost all these Western countries an awful lot of money as they aged out into retirement, especially these countries with socialized medicine or these countries with subsidized medical insurance.

18:20.573 --> 18:31.975
America knew that their Medicaid program, which is somewhere like half the budget of America, was gonna have a pretty big problem as we went from the graph that you see there

18:37.250 --> 18:55.464
The graph that you see here where there's virtually almost nobody retiring in those ages, look at how many people would be aging out here, how many people need end-of-life care, how many people are being spent a half a million dollars every six months on end-of-life care is a fraction of the number of people who are up there now.

18:56.725 --> 19:03.350
And the pandemic was a very convenient way for all of the countries that had this problem to take care of them.

19:05.071 --> 19:06.893
In the UK, they call it euthanasia.

19:11.485 --> 19:22.833
In the Netherlands, they call it shortage of people in the hospital so that people die of urinary tract infection and have to have three or four transfections in order to get their chemotherapy.

19:25.475 --> 19:32.600
In Scotland, they just call it starvation and cold and thirst and urinary tract infection.

19:35.563 --> 19:38.525
And in America, they did it with pure oxygen.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.723
and called it ARDS and a ventilator shortage.

19:43.884 --> 19:48.708
And viral pneumonias aren't affected by antibiotics all around the world.

19:49.208 --> 19:56.775
And midazolam in Scotland for a few weeks, consistently, over and over again, for a few years.

19:58.957 --> 20:03.001
And these murder and lies were misconstrued as the start

20:04.256 --> 20:07.318
of a novel virus going endemic.

20:07.478 --> 20:20.566
And these are the long list of lies that we've come up with to describe America, including a half a million people dying of opioids, which has conveniently reduced the life expectancy in America.

20:20.746 --> 20:31.612
And the national security state has, through no fault of their own, misconstrued that as a result of the pandemic that they responded so effectively to.

20:34.520 --> 20:45.685
And so this expected all cause mortality increase over the next few, or maybe even a decade, was misconstrued as the start of something going endemic.

20:45.806 --> 20:47.266
And that was the plan.

20:47.967 --> 20:50.068
That was the plan from before the pandemic.

20:50.128 --> 20:53.149
It was formulated years before the pandemic.

20:53.169 --> 21:02.714
And then people were put in place by giving them careers that had and included publications and laboratories and funding and grants.

21:03.843 --> 21:28.267
so that in 2020, the theater would be ready to go, and not just the theater on television, but the theater on social media, where people could be fooled by illusions of consensus created by more than one person agreeing on a screen, much like The View, but not any different than Joe Rogan or anything else that happens on a podcast when you listen to what you think is a conversation.

21:30.100 --> 21:34.141
And if it's not a conversation, then it is an enchantment.

21:35.421 --> 21:42.362
And even if one person is an enchanter and the other person is not, the net result can be an enchantment.

21:42.422 --> 21:50.384
That's what's going on here when people have particular pieces of the narrative, like a fear and cleavage site or an HIV insert and are told to stick to it.

21:51.204 --> 21:55.685
Or because of no fault of their own other than them being greedy and grifty,

21:56.596 --> 21:59.837
realize that, wow, everybody really likes it when I talk about that.

22:00.337 --> 22:02.518
And so then maybe I should keep talking about that.

22:05.259 --> 22:15.723
And I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I was offered to work on Bobby's book because they hoped that I would go with it, that I would take that opportunity and say, hey, it's a lab leak.

22:15.743 --> 22:17.283
Hey, I get to be a part of this book.

22:17.643 --> 22:20.524
Hey, I'm the guy who taught it to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

22:20.544 --> 22:21.785
Hey, I'm the expert.

22:23.390 --> 22:28.491
But instead, by the end of the book, I had figured out that we were actually not telling the right story here.

22:29.191 --> 22:33.732
I think the biosecurity state probably lied to us about this because RNA can't do this.

22:33.912 --> 22:34.572
And then what?

22:35.872 --> 22:37.472
No more talking to Jay.

22:41.173 --> 22:42.593
That's not for this book.

22:44.654 --> 22:52.075
And so this whole list of distractions in 2020 was prepared like really well.

22:53.106 --> 22:53.807
They gamed it.

22:55.069 --> 22:59.095
They worked it out in tabletop exercises, behind the scenes, I don't know.

22:59.496 --> 23:03.261
But they gave pieces of the puzzle to all these different people.

23:04.266 --> 23:15.049
and told them to stick to those pieces so that the people between them on social media would think that they were putting pieces together and solving a mystery themselves.

23:15.109 --> 23:16.089
That's the trick, right?

23:16.489 --> 23:26.511
If you watch Jessica Rose and she talks about repurposed drugs and the fear and cleavage site, and then you listen to James Lyons Weiler and he says the fear and cleavage site means that it's gain of function.

23:26.931 --> 23:30.752
And then weeks later, Jessica Rose says, oh, I heard about this gain of function stuff.

23:30.792 --> 23:31.612
It's pretty crazy.

23:32.073 --> 23:33.433
Then you think to yourself, wow,

23:33.993 --> 23:36.314
Look at how these pieces of the puzzle fit together.

23:37.614 --> 23:40.135
I think I see something that not everybody else sees.

23:41.655 --> 23:42.616
That's how they got me.

23:45.196 --> 23:46.117
That's how they got you.

23:48.037 --> 23:50.698
If you weren't got by the TV, you were got by this.

23:51.839 --> 23:52.959
And that's the whole point.

23:53.871 --> 24:03.979
Because then if you weren't got by the TV, you were got by a narrative that specifically seeded expected outcomes for transfection and transformation in general.

24:04.720 --> 24:08.363
You didn't know that, I didn't know that, but that's what they did to us.

24:08.863 --> 24:18.752
And so as we argued, we accepted the novel virus, we accepted that the novel virus could be blamed for some of these outcomes and suddenly,

24:20.555 --> 24:34.701
Oh my goodness, we can't differentiate outcomes from the novelty from outcomes to what they already expected would happen in any of the lots that were real transfection and not placebo.

24:37.442 --> 24:46.566
And this went on for three years and it was done very, very well because the main illusion that was riding behind them was endemicity.

24:47.608 --> 24:59.593
The main illusion that they'd all been briefed on was is that what we're trying to convince people of is that something that's always there just showed up and is spreading and occupying the background.

25:00.273 --> 25:05.996
And so that in four or five years, it will be an accepted background signal.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.839
And that we call endemicity in virology.

25:10.359 --> 25:24.850
And so what the illusion really is, if any of these people are sophisticated enough to understand what they've done to us and our children, is that there is no way to differentiate endemicity from a background if you don't have any tests from before 2020.

25:26.789 --> 25:30.851
Now, of course, all of this biology is on a short time scale.

25:31.332 --> 25:34.734
The time horizon has always just barely been moving, right?

25:35.134 --> 25:38.156
At the beginning of the pandemic, the time horizon was like one year.

25:38.976 --> 25:41.778
In 2020, we didn't think it would last to 2021.

25:42.679 --> 25:47.682
And in 2021, at the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021, we were sure it would be over by summer.

25:48.962 --> 25:54.766
And then in the winter of 2022, we were still pretty incredulous that it would last through 2023

25:57.284 --> 26:01.387
And now we're in 2024 and nobody even cares anymore.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.368
They just assume it's gonna last forever.

26:03.508 --> 26:05.549
They just assume that this is the way we are.

26:05.589 --> 26:07.370
And now we have to get ready for the next thing.

26:10.893 --> 26:25.402
And so we're moving along, moving along on their narrative under their control still to this day, because we're not looking far enough and we're not thinking clearly enough.

26:26.394 --> 26:41.278
But let me make sure that we are very clear about the fact that in 2020, a DITRA contractor named Robert Malone claims to have gotten a phone call from Wuhan and spun his team up.

26:42.338 --> 26:54.742
And as a result of that team being spun up, within a couple of weeks, he had used an AI program, a X-ray crystallography model of a couple enzymes and the entire FDA

26:56.138 --> 27:06.225
pharmaceutical catalog to identify four drugs that included ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and remdesivir.

27:07.646 --> 27:20.815
Remdesivir being a drug that was identified a few years before, which could interact with a novel protein of the coronavirus, said to give coronavirus the ability to proofread RNA copying.

27:21.535 --> 27:25.258
And that seems to be a superpower that only this particular

27:27.301 --> 27:37.260
Protein endows only on coronaviruses discovered by Ralph Baric and Mark Denison remdesivir Was identified by domain in 2020

27:39.110 --> 27:56.929
out of all the drugs and pharmaceuticals, even though there was a paper in 2019 with Sina Bavari and the last postdoc of Ralph Baric named Alison Totura that said that coronavirus would come out of a bat cave and remdesivir would be great for it.

27:56.989 --> 28:00.954
Remdesivir's method of action would be on the XON protein,

28:01.454 --> 28:18.309
which is a proofreading protein in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase repertoire of coronavirus, which permits them to have these amazingly large genomes that are single-stranded RNA with no ability to proofread normally, but coronaviruses have this special superpower.

28:18.769 --> 28:21.191
That's all at the beginning in January of 2020.

28:21.271 --> 28:22.372
That's where that starts.

28:25.034 --> 28:38.525
just by domain identifying remdesivir you can already say okay remdesivir was identified in two papers both by Ralph Baric or by Sina Bavari and a postdoc of Ralph Baric.

28:38.986 --> 28:44.771
The only molecular evidence of its action is also the only support

28:46.189 --> 28:49.732
for the idea that XON is a proofreading protein.

28:49.772 --> 29:05.146
Because without remdesivir interacting with it, they would have actually been able to directly demonstrate, directly demonstrate that XON is a proofreading protein and adds to the fidelity of RNA translation in their experimental models.

29:05.186 --> 29:05.787
Make that clear.

29:06.708 --> 29:12.353
XON, the gene that Kevin McKernan brought up on

29:13.013 --> 29:13.193
St.

29:13.233 --> 29:37.911
Patrick's Day in 2023 in the stream with John Bodwin, Stephanie Seneff, Jessica Rose, Kevin McKernan, and myself, when I was presenting the idea of infectious clones, that protein, its mechanism of action is only understood because Mark Dennison and Ralph Baric have this thing called remdesivir that supposedly interacts with it and increases the error rate because it interferes with XON.

29:40.250 --> 29:49.917
That's all just starting at 2020 because he got a phone call and because he used domain to identify ivermectin and remdesivir.

29:49.957 --> 29:54.040
You can already add all of those details in and go, wow, that's kind of dubious.

29:56.331 --> 30:09.976
So the pandemic potential of coronavirus is only defined by XON, the gene which allows the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to proofread, supposedly, the RNA copying.

30:11.084 --> 30:16.446
It's the only place on earth where there's RNA copying proofreading is in coronaviruses because of XON.

30:16.466 --> 30:23.108
And the only reason why we understand that XON works as it does is because there's this drug we have called remdesivir that interacts with it.

30:23.788 --> 30:29.950
And remdesivir was identified by Robert Malone in the domain server in 2020 as a good drug.

30:30.310 --> 30:36.892
And then Tony Fauci went on the couch of the White House and compared it to AZT.

30:41.124 --> 30:48.051
and how AZT was so seminal at the beginning of the AIDS outbreak, Remdesivir, that all happened.

30:51.314 --> 30:56.839
And so he did six international COVID summits, including one in 2020, but there were six more.

30:56.859 --> 31:02.425
And the last one was in Japan last week with almost all the same people, plus some new recruits.

31:04.616 --> 31:09.877
The Dark Horse podcast wasn't until June of, see, I'm putting these pink lines there, wasn't until June of 2021.

31:10.738 --> 31:15.059
And in that podcast, there was no discussion of PCR tests being inaccurate.

31:15.819 --> 31:24.501
There was no discussion of PCR tests and EUAs and how many primers there are or whether they nested primers or how many amplicons needed to be there, nothing.

31:25.947 --> 31:29.090
There was talk about zero COVID and there was talk about endemicity though.

31:29.550 --> 31:39.400
Then this particular video is from March of 2022, a whole year later, where he says that people shed exosomes with spikes because exosomes are definitely real.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.501
You know, those things that...

31:41.121 --> 31:44.925
Andrew Kaufman was talking about in 2020, and then never talked about again.

31:45.105 --> 31:53.574
Exosomes, the thing that makes it very easy to explain why coronaviruses have to be mythology, because they can't make your cells do something they don't already do.

31:53.994 --> 31:55.055
They do it all the time.

31:55.516 --> 31:58.779
And so we are misconstruing something with something else.

31:58.819 --> 32:00.340
We are exaggerating a fidelity.

32:00.380 --> 32:01.441
We don't have something.

32:02.102 --> 32:15.678
doesn't make sense when he says that out loud because a year before this, he said on some random podcast that most of the coronavirus particles that are made are actually replication incompetent because they have errors or there's been a recombination event.

32:15.998 --> 32:18.881
So he didn't expect this, but he believes it now in 2022 on Glenn Beck.

32:21.260 --> 32:29.284
And that's ridiculous because at the same time, he's claiming that he invented these things and gave up on these things because they weren't going to work because the immune system was going to be too powerful.

32:29.764 --> 32:31.385
And so he just let him go.

32:32.485 --> 32:37.208
And so it doesn't make sense other than to see that he's been titrating the narrative.

32:37.228 --> 32:43.131
He's been working for the government the whole time, either as a private contractor, maybe he's working for social media.

32:43.151 --> 32:49.934
He's working for the rulers of this, the people that want to control, demolish the American culture and the American government.

32:50.834 --> 32:53.256
get rid of the constitution.

32:53.296 --> 32:55.999
He has always said no for kids.

32:56.299 --> 32:59.462
That's what he says in this video, but actually we know that's not true.

33:00.303 --> 33:14.796
We've watched a video of him on the beach in bare feet with Jill and kids on Hawaii, where he is very unclear about whether these kids should take it or not take it and very unclear.

33:15.993 --> 33:17.235
about what his position is.

33:17.755 --> 33:21.079
And so for him to claim that is just a lie, but it's a titration.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.181
This is a progression.

33:24.464 --> 33:30.331
And so I worked from CHD in this yellow area here from May 22 until January of 2024.

33:31.693 --> 33:34.997
See, so all of this shit happened before I even got hired.

33:38.206 --> 33:50.289
Because it was in 2022 in April, this is in March, it was in April that Bobby called me and said that Robert Malone sat him down and he had to watch my January stream with Charles Rixey.

33:51.169 --> 33:51.969
That was in April.

33:52.749 --> 33:54.410
That's a month after Glenn Beck.

33:56.690 --> 34:04.052
And so I presented to him in October of 2022, that was the one where nine days later I met him in person and he didn't know me.

34:05.796 --> 34:13.979
That was the same day that Whitney Webb and I met, that I met Jill, that I saw Matt Crawford for the first time.

34:14.039 --> 34:20.681
And Matt Crawford hadn't registered for the conference, but the person that got him in was none other than Meryl Nass.

34:23.786 --> 34:25.387
And so all these meddlers were there.

34:25.528 --> 34:32.213
I mean, Matt Crawford had lunch with Robert Malone and Jill while they were at that conference.

34:32.413 --> 34:37.778
Charles Rixey said he was invited to Malone's ranch and that Malone remembered him but didn't remember me.

34:38.158 --> 34:44.584
And that all happened in 2022 in Knoxville at the inaugural CHD conference, also the place where I first met Bobby in person.

34:49.861 --> 34:54.002
And so then he shared a stage with Soph's mom in 2023.

34:54.702 --> 35:06.265
Soph being this precocious minor that before the pandemic lost her million subscriber YouTube channel for threatening to kill the CEO.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.165
And that got her on Alex Jones.

35:11.266 --> 35:17.567
And so her mom started touring on Robert Malone's International COVID Summit Team.

35:19.455 --> 35:30.979
And on one of these auxiliary things, not necessarily a COVID summit per se, but it was some Stockholm thing, she was on stage with him for a couple of days right next to Meryl Ness and Aseem Malhotra.

35:32.719 --> 35:48.924
These are all part of the same global operation to undermine our governments and most importantly, our government, America's government, the only legal system that still has doors that we can walk to freedom through.

35:50.967 --> 36:01.510
But then right after they were on stage in Stockholm, apparently Sasha and him had a falling out and Sasha decided that he was a bad guy and they became bad guys.

36:01.570 --> 36:04.510
And he promoted to his 1 million followers that she's a bad guy.

36:05.991 --> 36:08.391
And she has been terrible with me personally.

36:08.412 --> 36:10.312
So that's why I know that she is terrible.

36:11.272 --> 36:14.473
But it's really strange because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:14.513 --> 36:17.854
has interviewed her twice but never asked her about her daughter.

36:19.656 --> 36:23.400
And so the only conclusion that I can come to is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:23.520 --> 36:28.324
was told to interview her by none other than Robert Malone himself.

36:30.126 --> 36:42.118
I also think that when I objected to Robert Malone being a reader on the Wuhan cover-up book, they just took his name off of it in performance and told some people that they're listening to Jay, but they didn't.

36:43.342 --> 36:54.766
That's why Robert Malone has a recommendation statement on the back of the book and a thank you for reading it because he was always involved and he's still involved in this.

36:54.826 --> 37:03.310
That's why Meryl Nass has been the advisor of CHD because Meryl Nass is probably a friend of Robert Malone for a very long, long time.

37:03.390 --> 37:09.212
And in fact, the only reason why we didn't believe that is because Mary Holland and Meryl Nass

37:09.972 --> 37:23.166
told us that they were the ones who went to Robert Malone's farm and stayed there two nights and and vetted him for Bobby and they were very surprised at the time to find out that Robert Malone didn't even know what the WEF was.

37:23.627 --> 37:27.251
These are real stories that were told to me by these people.

37:28.912 --> 37:31.916
Meryl Nass told me that story over dinner

37:33.479 --> 37:39.861
the day before Boston, when the announcement of Bobby Kennedy's presidency or candidacy.

37:42.741 --> 37:50.223
She told me that in person, that she and Mary Holland were the people that vetted Robert Malone for CHD by going to his farm.

37:50.904 --> 37:55.725
And there they found out that he didn't know about the WEF and they were the ones who told him about it.

38:03.717 --> 38:09.622
And so I was fired by Merrily Holland at CHD because I questioned Robert Malone on my broadcast, December 22nd, 2023.

38:10.142 --> 38:13.825
And I know that because that's what Brian Hooker told me.

38:17.087 --> 38:23.593
And then in my exit interview, it was described as I was interfering with their free interaction with their partners.

38:25.334 --> 38:26.455
They're selling his book.

38:27.717 --> 38:38.634
And me, calling Robert Malone out as a traitor for the globalists or for the weaponized piles of money that he works for, is not helping to sell his book or the Wuhan cover-up book.

38:40.950 --> 38:53.734
That's why there's no interview with me about, as when I was a staff scientist about the book, because they did an interview, they recorded it, and then they wanted to record another one in December because they were like, this book, this interview isn't going to sell the book.

38:53.774 --> 38:54.474
Because why?

38:54.534 --> 38:58.595
Because I explained what infectious clones were and I explained what virology wasn't.

39:01.056 --> 39:09.598
And I explained that the book didn't quite get it right because I got it right too late for Bobby to put it in the book, for me to have an effect on the book.

39:16.735 --> 39:23.561
And so the way they're doing this is that the COVID shots are bad and don't talk about 2020.

39:24.202 --> 39:25.763
And I just want to give a plug here.

39:26.724 --> 39:28.165
I'm going to drop this in the chat.

39:34.250 --> 39:37.773
Let me just grab this quick and drop it in the chat.

39:39.735 --> 39:40.256
Did that work?

39:40.316 --> 39:40.496
No.

39:41.417 --> 39:41.737
Let's see.

39:45.939 --> 39:51.545
This website, it's a sub stack and I just like to plug it.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.908
Oh yeah, I'm gonna get rid of that listening to regular guy thing.

39:54.928 --> 39:56.049
So,

40:02.236 --> 40:07.019
What happened in the Scottish care homes has been summarized.

40:07.059 --> 40:09.360
They did actually a very thorough investigation.

40:09.420 --> 40:12.001
And we've watched a few of these videos before.

40:13.182 --> 40:16.644
But I just want to plug again, the fact that you need to go watch.

40:17.484 --> 40:21.026
You need to go take into account the fact that in Scotland, they murdered people.

40:23.519 --> 40:27.042
And there's great evidence for the fact that they murdered people.

40:27.082 --> 40:33.788
Now you can call it neglect or you can, you know, it's the same way that my father-in-law in the Netherlands died of a urinary tract.

40:33.888 --> 40:38.532
Nobody should die alone in a hospital of a urinary tract infection.

40:38.573 --> 40:39.193
I'm sorry.

40:40.734 --> 40:43.557
Least of all, because there's a contagious virus going around.

40:43.577 --> 40:45.659
And so we have to understaff the hospitals.

40:48.114 --> 40:49.916
We have to understaff the care homes.

40:49.956 --> 40:52.278
We have to drop the heat in the care homes.

40:52.738 --> 40:56.501
We can't give any of these people water, even though they're on dry air masks.

41:00.405 --> 41:03.447
There is no way to explain this other than murder.

41:03.507 --> 41:06.110
And the only word that describes it is murder.

41:08.211 --> 41:10.934
You can even see it in the, in the, in the,

41:13.476 --> 41:15.979
You can even see it in the Madazolam stats.

41:15.999 --> 41:18.041
You can see the spike in 2020.

41:22.525 --> 41:23.987
And you can see them doing it.

41:26.910 --> 41:28.592
Creating waves of COVID.

41:28.632 --> 41:30.013
It only has to be a few.

41:30.073 --> 41:32.516
This is Scotland, a little tiny country.

41:39.482 --> 41:43.666
And so why won't they talk about a background signal being misconstrued as spread?

41:44.206 --> 41:51.933
A background signal of expected all-cause mortality, that's the actuarial one, but also a background signal of RNA noise.

41:52.534 --> 42:02.163
If these tests weren't specific enough, then they would never be able to differentiate from the very hot background of RNA from all living things around us.

42:04.465 --> 42:05.386
That's just murder.

42:06.732 --> 42:13.076
The list and define the ways the methodology of PCR could be highly accurate on a bench, but not for SARS-CoV-2.

42:13.136 --> 42:15.758
Well, then you would be, those are elaborate lies.

42:17.219 --> 42:26.685
Define the countermeasures as transformations and transfections that they were selling products with these names before the pandemic using these methodologies.

42:27.005 --> 42:28.346
Well, that's obvious truths.

42:29.810 --> 42:35.818
especially to an academic biologist with any semblance of a brain in their skull.

42:37.950 --> 42:42.991
Listen to find the ways in its purest form that transfection would have never worked in healthy humans.

42:43.031 --> 42:47.252
Well, that should be a very easy thing for anybody who calls themselves a biologist.

42:47.292 --> 42:48.453
Those are known dangers.

42:48.953 --> 43:01.136
How is it possible that we think it's okay to inject a transfection intramuscularly into someone who's pregnant, but before the pandemic, we advised them not to eat unpasteurized cheese or sushi?

43:03.450 --> 43:13.312
I assure you that eating unpasteurized cheese and sushi is far less dangerous than the injection of a combination of substances intramuscularly during pregnancy.

43:13.332 --> 43:14.632
I don't care why you would do it.

43:17.852 --> 43:32.455
We're talking about a developing fetus when every biologist ought to know that development is the most dangerous time to expose any pattern integrity to an insult.

43:33.581 --> 43:38.982
to a chemical insult, to a chemical exposure, or to a biological change.

43:39.843 --> 43:46.864
Because the biological change will affect everything in the four-dimensional space of time beyond that point.

43:48.905 --> 43:53.746
And many times, development is not prepared to make up for

43:55.194 --> 44:03.581
a missing line of cells or a aberrant gene that has a primary function during development.

44:04.362 --> 44:08.205
And genes can have different roles in development than they do in the mature organism.

44:08.245 --> 44:16.692
And that's a truth that we just, we've never gotten complicated enough to understand and manifest in our own hypotheses about ourselves.

44:18.493 --> 44:38.768
And so the term infectious clone being transformation and transfection in cell culture in animals being misconstrued as virology like the real easy grand slam home run that any of these no virus people that have been so insistent that I'm not playing fair or I'm not a good guy have never bothered to take this and run with it.

44:39.288 --> 44:40.849
I don't care if they give me credit for it.

44:40.909 --> 44:45.192
They can't take it and run with it because if they did, the whole thing would fall apart.

44:46.078 --> 44:53.600
Their schtick would fall apart, and Tony Fauci's schtick would fall apart, and Vincent Racaniello's schtick would fall apart.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.661
All of it falls apart when you say number five.

44:58.302 --> 45:03.403
And the no virus people and all of their big control experiments don't matter if this is true.

45:05.724 --> 45:12.706
Their experiments are real, their objections are real, but their objections are child's play compared to this.

45:15.020 --> 45:18.241
And compared to this, RNA cannot pandemic.

45:19.802 --> 45:31.687
RNA cannot pandemic is a three word combination that challenges everyone from the average Joe gas station attendant to the smartest academic biologist.

45:31.707 --> 45:42.712
They either willfully don't think deep enough about those three words in combination to get there, or they are absolutely positively unsophisticated enough to hear it.

45:44.284 --> 45:47.987
And there are many academic biologists that are unsophisticated enough to hear it.

45:48.127 --> 45:48.488
Why?

45:48.548 --> 45:56.334
Because they've mastered a very tiny sliver of knowledge that is only useful to them if they pay exclusive attention to it.

45:58.016 --> 46:11.387
The moment they start paying attention to when this information isn't valid, when this information doesn't apply, when there are exceptions to this hypothesis, then suddenly their whole career path is in jeopardy.

46:14.056 --> 46:19.383
And so that's why they can't answer any of these questions, because it's not their expertise.

46:19.743 --> 46:31.358
And in order for my livelihood to be sustained, I have agreed to, acquiesced to, I have limited myself to a very strict

46:33.797 --> 46:41.224
region of inquiry, a very strict limited spectrum of inquiry that I call my expertise.

46:41.664 --> 46:45.087
I have a lab and it's called Sculpting Evolution.

46:53.547 --> 47:01.571
And so that's why we are here with Steve Kirsch saying, you know, maybe it was okay in this time, but I don't know, most vaccines are bad.

47:01.931 --> 47:12.517
We've been telling people for a long time using really vague language, but then saying that maybe there will be a time five years from now where the vaccines will be safe and maybe Bobby Kennedy will bring it to us.

47:13.177 --> 47:17.500
That's also why we're here where someone as absolutely

47:18.826 --> 47:45.539
average as as Elon Musk is being waved in front of our face as somebody who is so exception to the rule that he's able to create a tunneling company, a rocket ship company, and a satellite internet company, a electric car company, and a electric taxi company, and a self-driving thing, and AI that you can implant in your brain, and he just does all of this stuff.

47:47.575 --> 48:00.942
And he likes DJs and weird girls, and he names his kids funny, and he dresses up in really cool armor for Halloween, and he is the founder of the dark MAGA movement, you know, black hats instead of red ones.

48:03.843 --> 48:12.928
And on top of all of that, we're supposed to believe that this guy has saved free speech by purchasing Twitter from a sellout and making it free.

48:17.281 --> 48:21.804
You see, we're in really big trouble because we actually also have lawyers lying to us too.

48:23.485 --> 48:32.092
And if lawyers are willing to sabotage us, the oldest profession in the world is not prostitutes, it's lawyers.

48:32.192 --> 48:32.492
Why?

48:33.032 --> 48:40.758
Because when you had a grievance with the king, you needed to find somebody who could speak the king's language, who the king would listen to, the king would respect.

48:44.246 --> 48:47.867
And so yesterday we had a little discussion about due process.

48:48.707 --> 48:52.788
Yesterday we had a discussion about due process.

48:52.949 --> 48:57.850
And I think it was really, really valuable, especially to me.

49:12.281 --> 49:22.888
because I have been wrestling with this for a while now with trying to how to express the concern that I have as a newcomer to this fight.

49:24.249 --> 49:40.660
And I think that's what gives me the sort of annoying perspective that is inconvenient to these people like Mary Holland and Meryl Ness, is that I don't understand how it is that they knew this already back in 2015 and they haven't been able to make any progress.

49:41.937 --> 50:10.372
I understand that they've got a really great, great couple of nonprofits, and I'm sure they've got a lot of money, and I'm sure they've put on some very expensive and successful conferences, but I'm trying to think about where the ball was in 2015, when Mary Holland was on Democracy Now, telling everybody that the MMR shot hurt her son, and at the same time in the UK, there was some guy named Wakefield, who would later marry Elle McPherson,

50:11.753 --> 50:32.717
he is he is saying that the MMR shot is hurting kids there and then they get together and they make a movie and the movie has a woman whose kid was hurt by the MMR shot and so then they're debating for the next five years whether it's thalidomide or mercury or aluminum and then they get this guy

50:33.317 --> 50:39.480
named Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was involved in cleaning up the water to get involved in the vaccines.

50:39.520 --> 50:49.204
And then he's also kind of focused on particular ingredients that haven't been tested or are exempt from strict liability because of some law or another.

50:50.465 --> 50:53.446
And they can't talk about it because they get censored.

50:55.109 --> 51:03.495
And after what is actually now going on, really 10 years of this fight, it doesn't really feel like we've made any progress at all.

51:03.855 --> 51:14.923
We have the exact same people fighting for us, the exact same people screaming, the exact same people getting the highest salaries from these nonprofit organizations, but they haven't gone anywhere.

51:17.965 --> 51:24.610
And ICANN is another one of these organizations that seems to be not getting anywhere.

51:26.448 --> 51:33.954
Despite having a guy like Dell, who's tall and handsome and well-spoken and good on camera, they can't seem to get anywhere.

51:34.354 --> 51:41.500
Despite having Bobby Kennedy as their, as their, as their, what is it?

51:41.580 --> 51:44.542
Something, something in leave, chairman on leave?

51:46.483 --> 51:48.005
They haven't gotten anywhere.

51:49.065 --> 51:50.366
Is that Bobby's fault?

51:50.567 --> 51:51.127
I don't know.

51:51.147 --> 51:56.111
I think it's more likely to be Mary Holland's fault and Meryl Nass' fault.

51:57.466 --> 52:02.331
and Aaron Seery's fault because these are the people that claim the expertise.

52:02.391 --> 52:05.734
Meryl Nass is the one that claims to be the bioweapons expert.

52:06.875 --> 52:12.741
Mary Holland is the lawyer that has been out in front of this since 2015 on Democracy Now.

52:13.202 --> 52:18.267
Aaron Seery is the guy who gave up his job at Goldman Sachs to fight for real people.

52:21.778 --> 52:40.807
So far be it from me to criticize them, but I want other people with expertise to really apply it here and think, okay, if they're not going to push this forward now, after the pandemic, after all of the admissions, after all of the drama, after all of the mistakes,

52:42.116 --> 52:56.422
If they're still stuck where they were in 2015, before presumably they understood how big the problem was, maybe they were really coming out in 2015 as like, you know, I just, I'm sure vaccines are great, but I think they can also hurt people.

52:56.462 --> 52:57.322
So we should be careful.

52:57.662 --> 52:58.583
Maybe we should test them.

52:58.603 --> 52:59.863
Maybe they need to be improved.

53:02.404 --> 53:06.866
And then years later, they come to find out that no, that's not the case.

53:06.926 --> 53:08.166
These people are covering it up.

53:08.206 --> 53:08.767
They're lying.

53:10.814 --> 53:14.797
Brian Hooker drives across the country to get this guy to whistleblow.

53:14.857 --> 53:18.741
And we come to find out the CDC has covered up some data.

53:20.042 --> 53:22.964
And so it's not as simple as not testing a few things.

53:23.425 --> 53:28.089
It's not as simple as just wanting to speak out and maybe we have to get the illuminers.

53:28.229 --> 53:31.071
It's much more malevolent than that.

53:31.111 --> 53:37.877
But despite that revelation, at the start of the pandemic, they were talking about freedom of speech still.

53:39.827 --> 53:45.652
And so I have been curious about Aaron Seery ever since I've been in a Zoom meeting with him.

53:45.692 --> 53:51.857
And I can't, it was more than a year and a half ago now, where I got to ask questions and I just asked him about the Seventh Amendment.

53:51.917 --> 53:56.801
And his answer was very specifically, it's not time for the Seventh Amendment.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.522
And he wouldn't say any more.

53:59.443 --> 54:01.265
It's not time for the Seventh Amendment.

54:01.685 --> 54:07.189
And ever since I had that conversation or lack of conversation with him, I have been frustrated,

54:08.092 --> 54:11.614
And I have been paying attention, trying to figure out what is going on here.

54:11.654 --> 54:15.377
And anytime I've had a good question, I've tried to ask as many people as possible.

54:15.897 --> 54:16.798
And I think I'm ready.

54:17.979 --> 54:18.719
I think I'm ready.

54:20.761 --> 54:34.410
So the first thing I want to bring to your attention is that I think one of the most unsung heroes and one of the most untapped resources of knowledge and experience, in my humble opinion, is Rolf Hazlehurst.

54:35.458 --> 54:47.602
Rolf Hazlehurst is a senior staff attorney at CHD until October 31st, 2024, at which point his appointment at CHD will end.

54:53.803 --> 55:00.465
And now you can be as curious as you want as to why they chose October 31st and not September 30th or August 31st.

55:04.585 --> 55:19.580
But the guy whose daughter is part of the foundational case that has established the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act and the compensation program and all this other, this is the guy with the most experience because his family is that experience.

55:20.261 --> 55:23.244
The reason why he went into this law is because of his family.

55:26.129 --> 55:34.755
And along with Ralph, a bunch of other people were let go or kind of forced to leave CHD, including the original founder, Laura Bono.

55:36.076 --> 55:40.719
And that's all happened in the last few months that CHD is not talking about it with Vax3.

55:42.760 --> 55:48.804
CHD is not admitting that they couldn't afford these people and so we had to let a bunch of autistic moms go.

55:49.885 --> 55:53.608
We made a bunch of people who dedicated years of their life to this work go.

55:55.891 --> 55:57.432
in order to keep who?

55:59.294 --> 56:05.558
Meryl Nass has her own nonprofit now called Doors to Freedom or some bullshit like that, that Mary Holland helped her launch.

56:08.761 --> 56:14.005
Mary Holland keeps sending emails to me asking to raise a million dollars before some time or another time.

56:14.545 --> 56:15.346
We're almost there.

56:15.986 --> 56:17.607
But what are they gonna use that money for?

56:18.128 --> 56:23.192
A poster that says rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear?

56:24.246 --> 56:29.710
Great big vinyl posters that they can display at a conference and then throw in the garbage afterward?

56:30.351 --> 56:31.932
Is that what they're gonna spend that money on?

56:33.473 --> 56:36.976
A lawsuit that isn't gonna go anywhere?

56:37.277 --> 56:38.718
Is that what they're gonna spend their money on?

56:40.960 --> 56:46.944
Why isn't this the primary speaker for children's health defense on the internet?

56:47.105 --> 56:48.786
Why don't they make shorts of him?

56:49.206 --> 56:51.108
Why isn't his story featured?

56:53.188 --> 57:00.693
Why is Mary Holland Esquire the one that we have to listen to with a morning program every day?

57:02.694 --> 57:08.017
The one that has been on Democracy Now 10 years ago is the one who gets a daily thing to say.

57:08.477 --> 57:16.882
And she has proven that she can't say anything like intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

57:18.783 --> 57:20.224
She was my boss for six months.

57:20.244 --> 57:21.145
She can't even say it.

57:22.637 --> 57:24.099
that RNA can't pandemic.

57:24.139 --> 57:24.899
She can't say it.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.121
I bet this guy could.

57:26.801 --> 57:30.125
I bet if I talked to him for a half an hour, he'd be all, I'll say it.

57:33.206 --> 57:37.770
I wonder what he would think of Aaron Seery's little thing.

57:38.531 --> 57:44.757
So remember, Aaron Seery is the lawyer for ICANN, and ICANN is very closely associated with Mickey Willis.

57:45.638 --> 57:57.649
Mickey Willis made the musical called Plandemic the Musical, which Rolling Stone reported as a awkward victory lap for COVID conspiracists.

57:59.878 --> 58:10.765
And in fact, if you click on one of their links in that article, it turns out that Rolling Stone has promoted Mickey Willis and his pandemic movies often throughout the pandemic.

58:10.825 --> 58:13.686
Now, does that look like censorship to you?

58:15.587 --> 58:19.610
Does that look like somebody who's making movies but suffering from censorship?

58:26.877 --> 58:44.148
Now, the reason why I'm going here is because 10 days ago, on October 1st, so it was like 12 days ago now, 11 days ago, in the chat, I noticed Soothspider here, to be fair, I can Aaron series challenging on 7A grounds.

58:45.769 --> 58:47.410
And I think that's wrong.

58:48.571 --> 58:52.934
I don't know what 7A is, but it's not listed in their complaint.

58:53.955 --> 58:55.496
I also saw that you put that here.

58:57.209 --> 59:03.489
uh the point out the fact under the thing it says something like uh

59:06.550 --> 59:10.693
point out the fact that the PrEP Act violates both the Fifth and the Seventh Amendment.

59:10.773 --> 59:14.496
So the thing about this complaint is that it actually doesn't say that.

59:14.556 --> 59:15.416
That's the problem.

59:15.917 --> 59:25.363
Even if there is a place here now where it might say that, the thing that you sent there is actually the, it's the unsubmitted document.

59:26.284 --> 59:33.349
So if you actually go to the court and you download the document that they actually submitted and you get the most recent one,

59:38.926 --> 59:40.988
It's actually exclusively Fifth Amendment.

59:41.048 --> 59:51.395
Now, let's start here first, because Aaron Seery is the guy who supposedly has his name on this thing.

59:51.455 --> 01:00:00.342
Now, if we go over to this thing, we will see that actually the real lawyer is from that state.

01:00:01.703 --> 01:00:02.844
I'll see if I can do this here.

01:00:09.101 --> 01:00:12.866
Well, Aaron Seery's name is on here, but it's not just him.

01:00:12.946 --> 01:00:17.071
It's a dude from the state that it's in, in Louisiana.

01:00:17.552 --> 01:00:20.255
But this is Smith versus the United States.

01:00:21.597 --> 01:00:25.502
And if we just, you know, we just do this.

01:00:29.011 --> 01:00:35.752
and we looked strict, you'll notice, for example, that there is not one use of the word strict.

01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:47.075
That means that in this entire complaint, strict scrutiny or strict liability, those two very useful terms are not found in this document.

01:00:47.175 --> 01:00:53.496
Interestingly, if we go back and we do fundamental,

01:00:56.613 --> 01:00:58.616
We have five matches to fundamental.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:00:59.777
Now, what is fundamental?

01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:01.299
Why are we bringing up fundamental?

01:01:01.339 --> 01:01:09.089
Well, when we were talking about this yesterday, what we learned was that the lawyer is the oldest profession in due process.

01:01:10.117 --> 01:01:20.889
due process is the ritual owed to you by the king or the government, and that ritual is primarily there so that you accept the outcome.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:27.516
You go to trial, and when the jury decides, you accept the decision of the jury.

01:01:27.636 --> 01:01:29.558
That's the procedure that you are due.

01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:42.018
And so due process is, according to the Seventh Amendment, your ability to get a jury trial whenever you have damages over $20, a dispute over $20, whatever the right word is.

01:01:42.679 --> 01:01:47.480
That's the Seventh Amendment right, and that is a fundamental right.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:57.803
And when a fundamental right is being suspended, when a fundamental right is being taken away, then the government has a very high bar

01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:02.439
to prove that this is an okay action.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.782
Now I'm just gonna improvise through this explanation using these notes.

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:23.208
But what's important to understand in the complaint that Aaron Seery writes is, number one, what fundamental right, or is there no fundamental right, that is being violated by whatever he is complaining about?

01:02:24.869 --> 01:02:27.370
So if we go to this document,

01:02:29.963 --> 01:02:34.845
and we look for fundamental, where fundamental shows up should be where.

01:02:37.246 --> 01:02:51.131
So each of the three factors considered by the Supreme Court favors striking down the PREP Act to the extent it violates fundamental procedural due process protections.

01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:59.094
Now yesterday, we learned about substantive due process versus procedural due process.

01:03:01.196 --> 01:03:11.758
And our friend kind of made fun of procedural due process by saying that procedural due process only exists because substantive due process exists.

01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:25.381
And substantive due process is a real ritual, a real set of procedures that you have to go through in order to

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:33.205
suspend a fundamental right in order to come to a decision and make a decision.

01:03:34.386 --> 01:03:41.892
Procedural due process is actually not a fundamental right.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:53.861
Procedural due process implies that the government can make a decision and it doesn't have to have a very good justification for it because substantive due process is that.

01:03:56.075 --> 01:04:01.936
And so here is Aaron Seery at the beginning of his document on page... Oh, sorry.

01:04:01.956 --> 01:04:03.097
Maybe this is the wrong number.

01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:03.797
Let me go back.

01:04:08.618 --> 01:04:08.818
No.

01:04:09.978 --> 01:04:10.598
So that was it.

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:15.479
The first one is right here on page 41.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.840
He already lost.

01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:26.793
because he's not asking for, he's not claiming that a fundamental right is being violated.

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:40.178
And therefore, the people that are filing this suit, the complainants are asking for or claiming that the PREP Act violates

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:44.527
the principle of or violate substantive due process.

01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:45.027
Do you see?

01:04:45.587 --> 01:04:51.730
If you're not complaining about that, then you're not complaining that a fundamental right is being violated.

01:04:54.632 --> 01:05:08.799
And if you're not a legal scholar, and you're not aware of what procedural due process means, then you can't even see that Aaron Seery is essentially throwing the game right here.

01:05:09.935 --> 01:05:34.240
because the whole point should be that a fundamental right is being violated and therefore the government should be held to strict scrutiny when it does that and that there should be substantive due process in order for that to be allowed but instead Aaron Seery is asking his claiming that a fundamental procedure procedural due process

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:45.913
This is a Goldman Sachs lawyer who claims to be working with ICANN to save us from this trap.

01:05:48.454 --> 01:06:01.758
And as far as I can tell, I think every lawyer in the audience, every lawyer that you can possibly send this to needs to evaluate what I'm saying, because I'm not a lawyer, but I am sure as shit not dumb.

01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:05.920
And what I was taught last night by my friend doesn't jive here.

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:24.095
If Aaron was really trying to win, he would be telling the court what fundamental rights are being violated, and he would be explaining that the PrEP Act does not require substantive due process to suspend the Seventh Amendment rights of all the citizens in the United States.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.817
And in fact, what does he say?

01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:31.077
It's the Fifth Amendment that's being violated.

01:06:33.458 --> 01:06:35.859
We go down here, the fundamental, what, what?

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:37.419
Say what?

01:06:44.088 --> 01:06:46.969
Sorry, this is moving too fast for me on this mouse.

01:06:48.249 --> 01:06:51.029
One, one, two, okay.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:07:01.712
Fundamental rights and liberty interests involved are plaintiff's rights to redress their grievances by bringing common law claims against the manufacturers.

01:07:02.232 --> 01:07:05.332
So see, they're not talking about a jury trial for stuff over $20.

01:07:11.257 --> 01:07:13.818
He's talking about due process.

01:07:13.978 --> 01:07:15.519
And that's what the Fifth Amendment is about.

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:19.320
But see, due process is just the process, the ritual that you're due.

01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:32.866
And so if the courts see the fundamental right of due process being fulfilled by the CICP or the VICP, because it's a process, it's a ritual,

01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:38.622
then due process is not being violated.

01:07:39.162 --> 01:07:44.704
Procedural due process is not being violated if they give you a process that you're due.

01:07:46.484 --> 01:07:59.328
But if they're violating a fundamental right to have a jury trial to address grievances over $20, they would need to have a substantive, substantive,

01:08:01.934 --> 01:08:04.215
due process in order for that to happen.

01:08:04.255 --> 01:08:08.156
And that would include holding the government to strict scrutiny when they made that decision.

01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:20.118
And that should involve a place where you can see the process happening, maybe a website that announces why, and maybe some set of list of criteria that needed to be met.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:28.520
But there is no such thing when it comes to the rational basis test, which is what really

01:08:33.298 --> 01:08:35.219
Aaron Seery is allowing them to keep.

01:08:38.393 --> 01:08:42.596
These words, when they're used ineptly, don't mean anything.

01:08:42.636 --> 01:08:58.527
When they're combined correctly, they are as sharp as a 200 times folded samurai sword, sharpened by the oldest and master of water stones in Japan, Hanti Haruhori, or whatever his name was from Kill Bill.

01:08:59.047 --> 01:09:05.952
If you use language correctly in the legal context, it is impossible to escape.

01:09:08.635 --> 01:09:16.799
And so are we to believe that the Goldman Sachs lawyer that works for ICANN is doing this on accident?

01:09:18.961 --> 01:09:27.265
Or are we to see it for what it is, which sure looks like he's just throwing the game and hoping that there isn't a lawyer that understands this or is willing to stand up about it?

01:09:29.146 --> 01:09:32.248
I wonder what Ralph Hazlehorst would think of my analysis.

01:09:32.408 --> 01:09:33.748
Maybe somebody can send it to him.

01:09:33.808 --> 01:09:34.809
Maybe I'll send it to him.

01:09:39.949 --> 01:09:44.130
fundamental plaintiff's fundamental right to recover damages for their injuries.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:46.951
Is that a, is that a fundamental right?

01:09:49.331 --> 01:09:50.511
He's not saying it.

01:09:51.112 --> 01:09:56.873
What fundamental right is he talking about there?

01:09:57.833 --> 01:09:58.693
Let's see the next one.

01:10:01.054 --> 01:10:01.254
Oops.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:05.673
Fundamental.

01:10:06.233 --> 01:10:32.681
Consequently, because the PREP Act interferes with the plaintiff's fundamental rights and liberty interests, insofar as it substitutes their right to redress grievances for an injury, with an egregiously insufficient secretive administrative process replete with arbitrary rules, the PREP Act is a violation of plaintiff's substantive due process rights.

01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:37.127
and the court should enter summary judgment and plater of the plaintiff.

01:10:37.147 --> 01:10:43.530
So he's not, he's saying the words, but what is the fundamental right being violated?

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:55.615
He says the fundamental right being violated, and we said it in the beginning already, he's not saying it in the sharpest way that he can.

01:10:55.675 --> 01:10:59.317
He's saying it in an inaccurate way, an inconsistent way.

01:10:59.377 --> 01:11:00.678
I don't think this is good.

01:11:11.755 --> 01:11:16.979
to the extent it violates fundamental procedural due process protections.

01:11:17.059 --> 01:11:17.940
I just don't see it.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:18.781
I don't see it.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:21.343
This guy is not saying it the way it needs to be said.

01:11:22.164 --> 01:11:22.664
He's not.

01:11:27.248 --> 01:11:32.272
And if we go and we think about that, as we think about that, we should just say this, okay?

01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:33.793
Send this to Aaron Seery.

01:11:36.883 --> 01:11:42.004
Why are the terms strict scrutiny and strict liability absent from any of these complaints?

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:44.985
Maybe ask him what they mean to him.

01:11:46.725 --> 01:11:51.326
What fundamental rights are violated or suspended by the PREP Act Emergency Declaration?

01:11:51.346 --> 01:11:57.408
Because he's not really saying it if he's saying fundamental procedural due process.

01:11:58.868 --> 01:12:01.749
That is a great big fat swing and a miss.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:10.143
What he needs to say is the fundamental right of what?

01:12:11.383 --> 01:12:12.644
Liberty or something like that?

01:12:12.664 --> 01:12:14.264
He needs to be specific.

01:12:17.326 --> 01:12:19.286
He should be as specific as possible.

01:12:19.306 --> 01:12:21.167
He's using a lot of fancy words.

01:12:23.063 --> 01:12:38.693
But just like I try to summarize the biology in a few sentences, this fool should be able to summarize in a few sentence what fundamental rights are being violated by the PrEP Act Emergency Declaration and why is the rational basis test insufficient to justify that?

01:12:39.394 --> 01:12:46.999
Because fundamental rights can't be suspended without strict scrutiny, without substantive due process.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.742
But if the right being violated

01:12:53.266 --> 01:12:56.030
is not codified in the right way, then what happens?

01:12:57.633 --> 01:13:04.844
So define substantive due process and describe how this is related to the complaint of the PREP Act, because he doesn't do it in the complaint.

01:13:06.146 --> 01:13:07.308
How is that possible?

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.192
And why is he harping on the Fifth Amendment instead of the Seventh Amendment?

01:13:13.273 --> 01:13:20.117
Why did he get in a Zoom meeting with me a year and a half ago and say to the whole group that it's not the right time for the Seventh Amendment?

01:13:20.157 --> 01:13:23.000
Is the right, is it not a fundamental right, Aaron?

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.343
Is the Seventh Amendment, does it not codify a fundamental right?

01:13:27.443 --> 01:13:33.167
And is that fundamental right not being violated by the words of the PREP Act itself?

01:13:37.523 --> 01:13:46.786
because they need no justification, they need no scientific evidence, it can be completely hypothetical, and already the Seventh Amendment right is suspended for these countermeasures.

01:13:47.267 --> 01:13:53.869
It's not even in how the law is applied, it is a facial challenge on how the law is written.

01:13:55.609 --> 01:14:04.436
There is no substantive due process in a law where it says, here's how you take away the Seventh, how you suspend the Seventh Amendment.

01:14:04.476 --> 01:14:05.557
You write a declaration.

01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:08.760
That is not substantive due process.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:19.828
And since they are suspending a fundamental right, the Seventh Amendment, then there has to be substantive due process and the government should be held to strict scrutiny.

01:14:19.868 --> 01:14:24.032
In other words, in some cases, the government should be assumed to be right.

01:14:27.159 --> 01:14:31.061
And the default here is it's an emergency, so we should assume the government to be right.

01:14:32.162 --> 01:14:34.183
Not if they're gonna take away fundamental rights.

01:14:34.243 --> 01:14:46.310
Then you need to assume the government is wrong, and you need to hold them to a much higher standard than the rational basis test, which is the PREP-X procedural due process.

01:14:48.631 --> 01:14:51.193
He's asking for a procedure.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.362
He wants them to pay a lot more money through the CICP or the VICP.

01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:58.922
That's how he wants it to be fixed.

01:15:00.703 --> 01:15:19.911
He doesn't want a facial challenge to the PrEP Act based on the fact that its words itself violate the basic legal principles of America where fundamental rights, when they are attempted to be suspended, we assume the government is wrong and we assume only under the strictest circumstances can this happen.

01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:27.716
with the strictest justification and with substantive due process.

01:15:27.836 --> 01:15:28.857
A real ritual.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:38.847
Not just some guy writing a piece of paper and signing it and then redating it and signing it again and then redating it and signing it again.

01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:50.740
What I'm trying to explain to you here is that I believe with all of my heart and soul that Aaron Seery will not and will refuse to answer these questions.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.201
He doesn't need to use my name.

01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:54.203
You don't need to use my name.

01:15:54.643 --> 01:16:01.490
We need these questions in front of Aaron Seery and Aaron Seery needs to explain why this complaint is so shitty.

01:16:04.448 --> 01:16:12.074
He needs to explain how it is that 10 years into this, this guy still says that it's not the right time for the Seventh Amendment.

01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:14.075
He's got to explain that.

01:16:14.656 --> 01:16:16.117
And he doesn't have to explain it to me.

01:16:16.437 --> 01:16:18.499
He can explain it to the Federalist Society.

01:16:18.819 --> 01:16:22.722
He can explain it to the almost entire law school of the University of Chicago.

01:16:23.463 --> 01:16:32.590
He can explain it to any lawyer who knows something about what these terms means and then understands that, holy shit,

01:16:33.919 --> 01:16:37.820
They're not used correctly in this frickin' complaint.

01:16:42.221 --> 01:16:56.345
Now this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that he is intimately associated with ICANN and Dell, and those fools made one of the most awful videos that I've ever seen.

01:16:58.885 --> 01:17:02.266
Awful videos I've ever seen.

01:17:06.724 --> 01:17:09.888
Now what I'm about to show you, I'm not going to make you watch all of it.

01:17:11.471 --> 01:17:13.413
But I want you to understand what was done.

01:17:14.354 --> 01:17:21.905
This is the fourth movie that was promoted by Rolling Stone that Mickey Willis and ICANN have put out.

01:17:23.578 --> 01:17:32.849
This is one of many music videos and other things where Robert Malone and people like, I don't know, J.P.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:41.939
Spears and all these other clowns of the sort of intellectual dark webby kind of yelling, screaming people along with Nurse Aaron.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:18:02.968
and his wife Jill Glasspool Malone, and all of these meddlers have been in music videos together for five years that you probably haven't seen, have been in movies across the ocean with Gerrit van den Bosch that you probably haven't seen, and so they've been working to build this illusion

01:18:04.326 --> 01:18:09.289
that there was a pandemic that was covered up, that probably came from a lab, that could come again.

01:18:09.409 --> 01:18:17.334
And Judy Mikovits and Del Bigtree and Mickey Willis, they all believe it, or they want you and our children to believe it.

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:26.339
And I can no longer see this as just people trying because this is supposed to be the fourth movie.

01:18:29.315 --> 01:18:39.284
The fourth movie, you know, where we have a better perspective on things, where we've cleared up some of the illusions that we had in the beginning of the pandemic and what happened, what didn't happen.

01:18:40.505 --> 01:18:50.074
And so there's a lot of still reflection and still murders that have been ignored and justice that hasn't been brought yet.

01:18:51.675 --> 01:18:55.559
And that yet, Aaron Seery's best lawsuit

01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:01.575
is what appears to be a legal language joke.

01:19:03.757 --> 01:19:20.872
And the best movie that our dissident movement can make and get promoted on Rolling Stone is a movie that laughs and accentuates the idea that masking was a big problem and that we should have resisted masks or something, something.

01:19:23.737 --> 01:19:32.026
This is the darkest days, ladies and gentlemen, because this is the calm before the storm, or maybe it's even the darkness before sunrise.

01:19:32.066 --> 01:19:39.834
I don't really know, because we are in big trouble if we can't see this, and we can't show other people this.

01:19:39.894 --> 01:19:41.856
We are in big, big trouble.

01:19:42.497 --> 01:19:43.638
And I think we can show them.

01:19:44.099 --> 01:19:45.941
I think we can show them very easily.

01:19:48.297 --> 01:20:02.392
I think there are lawyers all around the United States who can see through Aaron Seery in less than 15 minutes of reading that document, comparing these notes, and checking again in their head what they know about these legal concepts.

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:10.201
There may be a lot of people on earth that are lawyers who don't know about these legal concepts, and that's probably by design as well.

01:20:21.434 --> 01:20:22.135
Ready?

01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:22.656
1, 2, 3, go!

01:20:49.557 --> 01:21:08.404
So first, we're supposed to believe that an independent filmmaker launched a rebellion against the imperial forces in May of 2020, and that despite the best efforts of the government, he was able to release four movies which exposed the truth of this lab leak and the cover up and all of the crimes that were committed.

01:21:10.014 --> 01:21:30.269
Despite the best efforts of the government, Robert Malone, and Mickey Willis, and Judy Mikovits, and all of these people have managed to put together four production-level movies, lots of podcasts, and get covered by Rolling Stone throughout the pandemic, despite being censored.

01:21:56.667 --> 01:22:07.505
So this, the fourth and final episode of the pandemic series, the Rebel Alliance is determined to reclaim its music and restore freedom, justice, and peace to the tattered Republic.

01:22:10.083 --> 01:22:11.484
They're making fun of us with this.

01:22:11.504 --> 01:22:12.644
There's no other way to see it.

01:22:12.684 --> 01:22:14.265
They're making fun of us with this.

01:22:14.425 --> 01:22:20.588
Anybody that believes that they are on this team and that this team is part of the rescue squad.

01:22:21.148 --> 01:22:27.211
You, my friends are taken even worse than the people who still think Tony Fauci is a good guy.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:34.655
You have been fooled by a much more malevolent scheme than those people who believe in Tony Fauci.

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:45.215
Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak in 60 Minutes are child's play compared to what these people are doing to the people that follow them.

01:22:46.156 --> 01:22:48.117
And that included me for a couple years.

01:22:49.138 --> 01:22:54.422
Fooled by their collective coordinated lying.

01:22:59.761 --> 01:23:04.445
And so now we have the primary guy that we're supposed to pay attention to.

01:23:05.066 --> 01:23:12.233
And of course, there's a contest going around right now for the people that can find the most Easter eggs in this video.

01:23:12.273 --> 01:23:18.358
So we're supposed to watch it over and over and over again to try and find all of the Easter eggs that are here.

01:23:18.759 --> 01:23:24.404
And what you should really see is the assembly of a character who probably doesn't exist.

01:23:27.947 --> 01:23:56.529
is supposed to be like some kind of weird American image of some American guy who's got like some some not perfect trophies and he likes a lot of the movies that we like and you know he likes all the stuff that we like and he's got all the stuff that we collect you know he's like us and he's got a Raiders of the Lost Ark thing here and he's a dude who gets up and shaves his head like we all do he's got a piano in there that he plays

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:00.398
And he goes, the editing's really weird, right?

01:24:00.418 --> 01:24:05.519
He's got to go from his bed to his shaving to his bed again, which doesn't make any sense chronologically.

01:24:06.219 --> 01:24:07.519
He's got some weights there.

01:24:07.539 --> 01:24:08.560
It doesn't look like he lifts.

01:24:13.821 --> 01:24:14.761
And so he gets out of bed.

01:24:14.781 --> 01:24:15.902
He steps on a Lego.

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:19.002
And so he's got to put the Lego back on his Lego thing.

01:24:19.062 --> 01:24:21.183
It's all trying to catch all of it, you know?

01:24:21.883 --> 01:24:22.803
Put the Lego back.

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:23.784
Oh, that's great.

01:24:23.984 --> 01:24:24.904
He's just like me.

01:24:26.397 --> 01:24:27.638
He's just like all of us.

01:24:28.278 --> 01:24:29.479
Pink Floyd, The Wall.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:38.806
I mean, he's almost the perfect conglomeration of American culture, the best of it or something.

01:24:39.446 --> 01:24:41.888
Look at that poster behind him.

01:24:41.968 --> 01:24:43.810
And what was the ringtone?

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:46.632
The ringtone was Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

01:24:46.672 --> 01:24:52.376
Again, just playing on these ideas of who would like this.

01:24:56.087 --> 01:24:56.607
Geraldine?

01:24:59.388 --> 01:24:59.708
I'm here.

01:25:00.788 --> 01:25:01.248
Are you okay?

01:25:04.249 --> 01:25:05.389
Hey, Arthur, don't worry.

01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.650
His mixed-race wife is coming near the end.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:11.871
We decided that it's best for you to join us virtually.

01:25:11.891 --> 01:25:13.972
And she's pregnant.

01:25:13.992 --> 01:25:14.572
What?

01:25:14.632 --> 01:25:21.654
And so now his sister is telling him that they want him to join virtually because he doesn't wear a mask and he's not vaccinated.

01:25:22.874 --> 01:25:25.655
And so now he's gonna watch TV and he's gonna feel sad.

01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:30.613
With mom and dad being at the highest risk, everyone thinks this is best.

01:25:30.633 --> 01:25:32.954
You asked me to get tested and I did.

01:25:32.974 --> 01:25:34.455
I'm good.

01:25:34.815 --> 01:25:36.737
Andre said he could put you on the big screen.

01:25:38.077 --> 01:25:39.598
It'll be like you're in the room with us.

01:25:44.261 --> 01:25:47.944
I know it's not the same, but this is the best.

01:25:48.124 --> 01:25:50.686
And so now remember, we're focused on the lockdowns.

01:25:50.726 --> 01:25:52.187
We're focused on the masks.

01:25:52.267 --> 01:25:54.068
We're focused on the response.

01:25:56.305 --> 01:25:58.247
We're not focused on why we're responding.

01:25:58.487 --> 01:26:04.692
We're not focused on the lies that are getting us to respond that way that included actually plandemic.

01:26:09.936 --> 01:26:10.597
For everyone.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.161
I gotta go pick up the kids.

01:26:16.181 --> 01:26:18.543
I'll send you a link when I get back home.

01:26:21.105 --> 01:26:21.666
I'm sorry.

01:26:23.191 --> 01:26:26.253
Frank Thomas, good reference there, wow.

01:26:28.215 --> 01:26:30.757
He's probably not nearly big enough to be Frank Thomas though.

01:26:30.797 --> 01:26:31.998
Frank Thomas is a giant.

01:26:33.519 --> 01:26:34.980
The Big Hurt, yeah baby.

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:42.935
Biden administration declaring monkeypox a public health emergency.

01:26:43.336 --> 01:26:45.477
This move will free up additional resources.

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:50.802
Gatherings are now limited to your household, but only if everyone over 12 is vaccinated.

01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:51.942
If someone in your family.

01:26:52.002 --> 01:26:58.187
So no biology here, even after four and five years, no biology, no real information here.

01:26:58.247 --> 01:26:59.468
This is all emotional.

01:26:59.508 --> 01:27:01.230
This is all to try and get you fired up.

01:27:02.441 --> 01:27:04.542
isn't vaccinated, should you ask them not to show up?

01:27:04.902 --> 01:27:06.343
Yes, I would do that.

01:27:06.403 --> 01:27:09.205
For a new coronavirus variant that's deadly.

01:27:09.905 --> 01:27:15.748
And so his sister is listening to Tony Fauci, so Tony Fauci is the bad guy, it's the Scooby Doo.

01:27:15.928 --> 01:27:18.049
What is known as disease X?

01:27:18.210 --> 01:27:18.570
Fears.

01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:21.872
You can stay unvaccinated if you want, but you're not going to be able to travel.

01:27:21.912 --> 01:27:26.334
They're hesitant to attend gatherings with other unvaccinated family members.

01:27:54.749 --> 01:27:58.473
so of course he's got a mystery machine and he likes 80s music

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.342
Um, why wouldn't he have a mystery machine, right?

01:28:02.422 --> 01:28:04.663
I mean, they're very economical vehicles.

01:28:04.723 --> 01:28:07.724
They're very handy and they got lots of room to put your shit.

01:28:07.864 --> 01:28:08.325
It's cool.

01:28:10.926 --> 01:28:13.467
Of course he sings on the CB, right?

01:28:13.487 --> 01:28:15.629
I mean, everybody's using 10 meter nowadays.

01:28:24.233 --> 01:28:26.594
Did they just discourage him from using the CB?

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:27.435
That's hilarious.

01:28:28.223 --> 01:28:29.943
You're in your car, man.

01:28:37.726 --> 01:28:40.446
Remember, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best we've got.

01:28:40.526 --> 01:28:51.509
After five years and a lot of money spent and a lot of donations and a lot of fighting and a lot of lawsuits, this is as far as we've gotten in more than a decade with the same people doing it.

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:53.950
All the same people.

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:57.654
And this is the best we've got.

01:28:57.694 --> 01:29:00.395
This is the best thing they can throw at the system right here.

01:29:05.617 --> 01:29:06.717
People going crazy.

01:29:13.419 --> 01:29:13.719
Oops.

01:29:14.179 --> 01:29:14.740
What was that?

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.120
People going crazy.

01:29:18.861 --> 01:29:20.081
Talk about an Easter egg.

01:29:20.681 --> 01:29:21.982
Is that a communist symbol?

01:29:22.422 --> 01:29:23.202
Stay kind.

01:29:24.302 --> 01:29:24.983
Be patient.

01:29:25.023 --> 01:29:25.563
Stay home.

01:29:26.522 --> 01:29:28.463
Is that a communism signal right there?

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:35.126
Is that a rainbows and, and, and, oh my gosh, come on.

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:38.948
That's a nice van.

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:41.749
It's nice.

01:29:41.789 --> 01:29:46.231
Maybe, you know, Adele got to keep the van after the movie, or maybe Mickey uses that van now.

01:29:48.192 --> 01:29:51.233
They probably used funded donations to buy that van.

01:29:51.273 --> 01:29:52.374
So that's pretty kick-ass.

01:29:59.002 --> 01:30:02.063
Oh yes, there are QR codes throughout the movie.

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:17.727
They tell you that at the end to go back and look and see if you can scan any of them.

01:30:17.747 --> 01:30:20.667
How many people in the chat haven't seen this yet?

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:22.908
Because if you haven't seen it yet, it's about to ramp up.

01:30:37.602 --> 01:30:38.422
There's Dell.

01:30:39.203 --> 01:30:39.863
That's Dell.

01:31:09.268 --> 01:31:10.129
Okay, that's $19.84.

01:31:15.152 --> 01:31:16.453
What does it say above the door?

01:31:16.473 --> 01:31:23.258
Okay, that's $19.84.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.981
Big Brother is watching you.

01:31:30.723 --> 01:31:32.644
Lots of subtle cues in this movie.

01:31:46.368 --> 01:31:48.370
Ministry of truth behind there.

01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:50.591
Yeah.

01:32:20.393 --> 01:32:21.833
Are you going to let him get away with that?

01:32:24.874 --> 01:32:30.056
Are you going to let him get away with mocking all the people that were killed by the opioids over the last four years?

01:32:30.096 --> 01:32:42.619
Are you going to let him mock and belittle the deaths of people who were given pure oxygen because Pierre Corey said to, because Kyle Seidel said to, because the CDC said to, because they said we were running out?

01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:45.160
Are you going to let them make fun of the murder

01:32:46.323 --> 01:32:49.785
that occurred because of the lies that they allowed to be told?

01:32:49.865 --> 01:32:53.087
Because of the wrong questions that they insisted be asked?

01:32:54.828 --> 01:32:57.210
Because of the shitty substacks that they wrote?

01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:01.933
Are you gonna let him get away with this?

01:33:14.837 --> 01:33:15.878
Excuse me.

01:33:15.978 --> 01:33:16.698
Here you go.

01:33:16.878 --> 01:33:18.198
Attention shoppers!

01:33:18.258 --> 01:33:20.019
Jerry, I've had enough!

01:33:20.079 --> 01:33:22.319
You don't get that privilege!

01:33:22.479 --> 01:33:23.060
I quit!

01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:24.980
Right here, right now!

01:33:49.482 --> 01:33:52.791
Gloria, don't you think you're falling?

01:33:52.811 --> 01:33:52.931
Gloria!

01:34:16.212 --> 01:34:19.175
The Big Hurt versus Malone in double mask.

01:34:19.975 --> 01:34:31.606
Incidentally, I had my primary investigator that was my supervisor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine was wearing three masks at some point when he would come to my office and it drove me bananas.

01:34:32.226 --> 01:34:36.450
So I know what that's like, but it is beyond mockery.

01:34:37.421 --> 01:34:39.482
that Robert Malone is playing that part.

01:34:39.522 --> 01:34:43.304
It is beyond mockery that Del Bigtree is playing that part.

01:34:43.384 --> 01:34:52.689
And it is beyond mockery that they are having this as their protagonist.

01:34:53.789 --> 01:35:03.494
And what happens next is... Welcome to the great awakening.

01:35:04.835 --> 01:35:06.236
Come on, breathe in.

01:35:14.343 --> 01:35:21.491
Roots woven underground, growing so strong.

01:35:21.551 --> 01:35:25.175
No storm will ever break us down.

01:35:25.835 --> 01:35:30.620
Our seeds turn to treasure, creating life forever.

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:37.830
We were born for this moment.

01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:40.391
Standing strong together.

01:35:40.591 --> 01:35:44.412
We're standing anywhere.

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:50.655
We remember who we are.

01:35:50.695 --> 01:35:52.016
Life is infinite.

01:35:52.756 --> 01:35:55.237
We'll be without end.

01:35:55.758 --> 01:35:59.079
We didn't stop the trucks.

01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:00.900
Love always wins.

01:36:06.937 --> 01:36:08.698
Oh, don't you dare turn it off.

01:36:09.418 --> 01:36:11.059
Don't you dare turn it off.

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:16.220
My friends.

01:36:16.661 --> 01:36:17.361
Don't you dare.

01:36:17.381 --> 01:36:17.941
My neighbors.

01:36:19.802 --> 01:36:22.963
This is not going to end.

01:36:27.224 --> 01:36:31.666
This will never end until we end it.

01:36:35.512 --> 01:36:38.153
How long are we going to live in fear?

01:36:43.116 --> 01:36:47.758
How long will we live in fear?

01:36:55.762 --> 01:36:56.522
They lied to us.

01:36:59.003 --> 01:37:01.764
They lied to every last one of us.

01:37:02.065 --> 01:37:02.925
About what?

01:37:03.965 --> 01:37:04.646
About murder?

01:37:05.788 --> 01:37:12.994
about the opioid crisis, about nutrition, about vaccines, or about transfection and transformation?

01:37:15.215 --> 01:37:19.318
Maybe there's a song coming up next called Transformation and Transfection, Not For Me.

01:37:19.339 --> 01:37:21.000
It's not like you weren't warned.

01:37:24.162 --> 01:37:25.864
And they called me crazy.

01:37:26.724 --> 01:37:27.064
Cheers.

01:37:28.566 --> 01:37:28.866
Cheers.

01:37:29.026 --> 01:37:29.947
How is it possible?

01:37:31.021 --> 01:37:33.683
They're on the same set in the same movie.

01:37:33.703 --> 01:37:35.284
They have the same mentors.

01:37:35.324 --> 01:37:37.025
They've been playing the same game.

01:37:37.486 --> 01:37:40.508
They have been working for the same people behind the scenes.

01:37:40.568 --> 01:37:46.993
And that's why Judy Mikovits is where she is and why they've never been on stage together like Robert Malone and Meryl Ness.

01:37:47.033 --> 01:37:59.362
Because if they got together on stage, everybody would immediately connect them all the way back to Gallo and Gardner and Ruschetti and CFS and, and HTLV, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

01:38:00.934 --> 01:38:02.035
latent viruses.

01:38:05.677 --> 01:38:29.910
This is the beginning of the end because these people have finally revealed themselves as one contiguous group of meddlers that has been working for weaponized piles of money to make sure that we never usefully extricate ourselves from this mythology, that we continue to do run around in their hamster wheels and their little limited spectrums of debate about masks and standing up and, and freedom.

01:38:31.423 --> 01:38:43.391
Not about the biology that they lied about, not about the fidelity that they lied about, not about the understanding that they exaggerated, not about the lie that the Human Genome Project is, not about the lie about this biology, but no.

01:38:44.572 --> 01:38:46.313
They can't even get the legal stuff right.

01:38:47.894 --> 01:38:54.639
Where fundamental rights are being violated by a government that's only being held to the rational basis test instead of strict scrutiny.

01:38:54.659 --> 01:38:55.960
They can't even say it!

01:38:58.143 --> 01:39:01.907
And a biologist who's been reading for a couple years can say it.

01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:07.234
Can say the biology and can say the legal stuff better than any of these people can.

01:39:07.634 --> 01:39:11.438
And that should be a gigantic warning sign to you.

01:39:13.521 --> 01:39:16.104
And it should explain why I still only have 3,000 followers on Facebook.

01:39:18.379 --> 01:39:35.182
Twitch, why I still have the same 14,000 followers on Twitter since I was reinstated a year and a half ago, why CHD hired and fired me, why I am listed in RFK's book as the first expert and now no one will talk about me.

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:40.058
because I probably have it right or damn close.

01:39:40.478 --> 01:39:43.759
Close enough that they can't talk about me anymore.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:53.584
The no virus people can't talk about me, the virus people can't talk about me, the anonymous mice can't talk about me, and neither can the CHD and ICAN people.

01:39:53.644 --> 01:39:54.265
They can't.

01:39:55.025 --> 01:39:59.988
They have to propone each other because it's always been the same fricking cast.

01:40:01.308 --> 01:40:06.051
That's why the same actors are in this movie that were in the first one and that were in all of those music videos.

01:40:06.758 --> 01:40:07.259
One of us.

01:40:07.279 --> 01:40:08.560
It's not like you weren't warned.

01:40:12.343 --> 01:40:13.484
And they call me crazy.

01:40:14.304 --> 01:40:14.645
Cheers.

01:40:16.126 --> 01:40:16.566
Cheers.

01:40:18.488 --> 01:40:20.590
I don't really need anybody to like me though, man.

01:40:20.630 --> 01:40:24.573
I just need people to take these ideas and accept them.

01:40:25.113 --> 01:40:29.057
To investigate them, to interrogate them, maybe even disprove them.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:30.960
to do the work.

01:40:31.701 --> 01:40:33.001
I don't care if they like me.

01:40:33.082 --> 01:40:34.882
I don't care if they say they heard it from me.

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:56.213
They can say, well, I heard this idea on the internet that's going around, and I just wanted to clear up the fact that RNA can definitely pandemic, or that transfection is definitely was not criminally negligent because we fixed it, or because we're gonna fix it, or because intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is most of the time, but not all the time, dumb.

01:40:56.674 --> 01:40:57.254
Somebody,

01:40:58.683 --> 01:41:07.885
Tell me why it is and what fundamental right is being violated by these laws and how it is that we can hold the government to strict scrutiny when violating them.

01:41:08.065 --> 01:41:09.325
Otherwise, what's going on?

01:41:15.187 --> 01:41:16.867
Who's going to take the mask off?

01:41:20.328 --> 01:41:20.688
I'll do it.

01:41:21.207 --> 01:41:26.629
No, the first time Judy and Nomi showed up in a video, in a music video, was in 2021.

01:41:27.069 --> 01:41:28.669
And that was a video by Hi-Rez.

01:41:29.169 --> 01:41:29.830
Several of them.

01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:32.030
No, Mom.

01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:33.130
It's okay.

01:41:33.331 --> 01:41:35.771
And the kids are telling the moms what's okay.

01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:40.793
It's not a mom finally giving in to her motherly instinct.

01:41:40.813 --> 01:41:44.174
The motherly instinct was to put on a mask and put a mask on her kid.

01:41:44.194 --> 01:41:48.395
Do you see how much enchantment is being cast here?

01:41:54.042 --> 01:41:55.503
Yeah mom, it's okay.

01:41:55.924 --> 01:41:58.245
Oh, two kids tell the mom it's okay.

01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:03.690
It's okay.

01:42:10.215 --> 01:42:10.875
We can do this?

01:42:10.895 --> 01:42:14.538
Of course we can do this!

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:16.860
Do it then!

01:42:20.843 --> 01:42:21.504
You go first.

01:42:28.848 --> 01:42:29.889
That's what I'm talking about.

01:42:30.209 --> 01:42:31.309
Take off your mask.

01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:34.111
Breathe in the fresh air.

01:42:35.551 --> 01:42:36.132
Yeah.

01:42:36.672 --> 01:42:38.093
Take off the mask, people.

01:42:38.413 --> 01:42:38.953
Come on.

01:42:39.593 --> 01:42:40.794
Let's take back our lives.

01:42:41.574 --> 01:42:42.315
That's right.

01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:43.515
Come on.

01:42:43.555 --> 01:42:44.096
Take it off.

01:42:48.621 --> 01:43:05.526
So wouldn't it have been much more impactual if they were going into a hospital and pulling people off of ventilators or waking people up from ventilators or pulling the supplemental oxygen out of their nose while they were sitting in the hallway of the hospital before they got on the ventilators and said, get out of here.

01:43:07.026 --> 01:43:15.048
And then there were singing nurses that were singing about COVID and these people walked in and beat the shit out of them and then sang their own song about how they're murdering people in hospital.

01:43:15.108 --> 01:43:17.069
Now that would be a music video I'd watch.

01:43:18.407 --> 01:43:20.268
That sounds like a musical with a message.

01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:30.073
Attention shoppers.

01:43:30.353 --> 01:43:41.338
In compliance with CDC guidelines.

01:43:44.309 --> 01:43:47.672
Trying to divide us brought us closer together people that there he is.

01:43:47.712 --> 01:44:08.272
That's the guy He's done a lot of a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of videos with robert malone and judy mikovits and and all of these people dell and and and uh high-res and and and and jp spears and uh the uh

01:44:09.645 --> 01:44:15.651
And Nurse Erin, they're all... Let's see what he's got for symbols.

01:44:15.671 --> 01:44:18.114
I see a Jewish star there.

01:44:18.254 --> 01:44:21.097
And what is that other thing?

01:44:21.117 --> 01:44:21.617
What is that?

01:44:33.558 --> 01:44:34.599
Do you know that symbol?

01:44:34.679 --> 01:44:36.920
Anyway, I just thought I'd let you see what's in.

01:45:03.237 --> 01:45:05.138
Did he just reach for a bag of chips?

01:45:06.219 --> 01:45:07.099
What just happened?

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:07.780
What is he doing?

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:49.936
no this is the great awakening holding on to your sanity won't divide up the family muslim true christianity let's get back to humanity united we stand divided we fall people won't stand a chance we all know that god's in control the people of the world

01:45:50.396 --> 01:45:52.159
Did we stay

01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:26.912
Is that guy carrying a fiddle?

01:46:27.112 --> 01:46:28.892
Please tell me he doesn't have a fiddle.

01:46:29.612 --> 01:46:37.535
It didn't look like he was really playing it because he didn't put it under his chin.

01:46:48.174 --> 01:46:51.396
He's not really playing it because he's not putting it under his chin.

01:46:52.237 --> 01:46:53.177
What's going on?

01:46:53.358 --> 01:47:00.923
Are they faking the fiddle is being played by that Indian with a... with a... with a... What is happening here?

01:47:24.097 --> 01:47:24.217
Oh

01:48:06.708 --> 01:48:15.937
Do you mind if I click forward just a little bit?

01:48:16.357 --> 01:48:17.778
I don't understand.

01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:38.912
Wow.

01:48:40.853 --> 01:48:41.354
Wow.

01:48:41.374 --> 01:48:42.535
Uh-oh.

01:48:43.956 --> 01:48:45.737
We're having a Christmas dinner now.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:50.621
Very diverse table.

01:48:52.283 --> 01:48:53.604
Oh, there's his girlfriend.

01:48:53.624 --> 01:48:59.168
She's got very obviously triangular earrings on.

01:49:05.195 --> 01:49:08.377
Uh, very obviously triangular ears on.

01:49:08.837 --> 01:49:11.679
And again, triangular ears on.

01:49:11.759 --> 01:49:12.479
Really weird.

01:49:17.402 --> 01:49:18.843
And they fell in love, I guess?

01:49:19.823 --> 01:49:20.844
And they're in love now?

01:49:25.086 --> 01:49:26.047
Was that his sister?

01:49:26.127 --> 01:49:28.428
Was that the one that... Oh, she's got a baby!

01:49:28.448 --> 01:49:31.290
Oh my gosh, she's got a baby!

01:49:49.178 --> 01:49:53.401
I mean, if he wouldn't have stood up and took his mask off, he would have never met the love of his life.

01:49:53.481 --> 01:49:55.502
I mean, this is such a romantic story.

01:49:55.562 --> 01:49:56.443
It's unbelievable.

01:50:05.168 --> 01:50:06.309
Who wears their hat at the table?

01:50:06.369 --> 01:50:06.929
Come on.

01:50:06.949 --> 01:50:09.070
I hope they didn't use auto-tune.

01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:11.491
I hope they can sing at least.

01:50:34.582 --> 01:50:36.004
We are divine.

01:50:39.309 --> 01:50:42.473
We are infinite.

01:50:43.375 --> 01:50:44.937
Breathe it in.

01:50:44.977 --> 01:50:45.397
Lovely.

01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.670
There's J.P.

01:51:05.690 --> 01:51:08.853
Sears on the cover of Women's Health, dressed as a swimmer.

01:51:30.823 --> 01:51:37.448
And there's the sponsor of the video, XClear, and there is the Plandemic 100% censored, 0% debunked.

01:51:37.468 --> 01:51:42.691
There's a bunch of flags on this.

01:51:50.879 --> 01:51:53.200
Universal Brotherhood for the Unity of Us All.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:52:00.805
It sounds a lot like the stuff that Teilhard de Chardin is talking about in this book, where we have to get rid of nations.

01:52:00.825 --> 01:52:02.726
The time of nation states is over.

01:52:03.046 --> 01:52:03.887
More machinery.

01:52:04.107 --> 01:52:05.848
We need humanity.

01:52:05.908 --> 01:52:07.009
Liberty will never perish.

01:52:07.856 --> 01:52:12.797
The hate of men will pass, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

01:52:13.317 --> 01:52:17.999
Don't give yourselves to men who despise you, enslave you, tell you what to do, what to think, or what to feel.

01:52:18.419 --> 01:52:20.219
You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

01:52:20.559 --> 01:52:24.400
You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

01:52:25.141 --> 01:52:30.742
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.

01:52:31.222 --> 01:52:34.343
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful.

01:52:36.032 --> 01:52:37.695
Oh, nautical flags.

01:52:37.755 --> 01:52:39.137
I'm sure it spells something out.

01:53:03.041 --> 01:53:04.601
George Webb works for the FBI.

01:53:04.641 --> 01:53:05.982
He can't be in these videos.

01:53:13.244 --> 01:53:15.305
Oh my gosh, they're not singing the Lion King.

01:53:15.845 --> 01:53:16.245
They did.

01:53:16.805 --> 01:53:17.845
They did the Lion King.

01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:19.626
And that was it.

01:53:19.646 --> 01:53:20.826
Hi, I'm Mickey Willis.

01:53:21.126 --> 01:53:24.247
I hope you enjoyed Plandemic the Musical as much as we enjoyed creating it.

01:53:25.768 --> 01:53:26.668
And action.

01:53:27.762 --> 01:53:36.366
Look at how much money, look at how much effort, how much money and time and effort was put into this.

01:53:38.347 --> 01:53:44.770
It is also our way of declaring that this is the moment for us to take back our creative arts which have been hijacked by traitors and tyrants.

01:53:45.882 --> 01:53:46.382
Hopefully.

01:53:46.663 --> 01:53:49.765
Creative arts have been hijacked by traitors and tyrants.

01:53:49.805 --> 01:53:57.191
He's talking about himself in exactly the same way that Robert Malone says he's writing a book about fifth generation warfare called Psywar.

01:53:57.611 --> 01:53:58.972
But it's not about him.

01:53:59.953 --> 01:54:01.434
It's not a book about Mickey Willis.

01:54:01.495 --> 01:54:05.438
It's not a book about him and Judy Mikovits working against us for 20 years.

01:54:06.098 --> 01:54:10.342
It's not about him and Judy Mikovits and all these other people planning this narrative out.

01:54:11.485 --> 01:54:30.508
so that we could transition from a very shitty vaccine schedule defined by very limited biological parameters to a vaccine schedule that was much more appropriate to the goals of trying to figure out how the hell our genome works under the assumption that the basic gist of it is we can't figure it out yet, but soon enough we will.

01:54:34.073 --> 01:54:38.614
We're so involved in the story that you didn't realize that the entire movie has been gamified.

01:54:39.074 --> 01:54:42.675
In the world of film production, there's a secret game that's played by insiders.

01:54:43.095 --> 01:54:46.496
Only avid fans are privy to what is known as movie Easter eggs.

01:54:47.556 --> 01:54:54.958
Planted by cast and crew, items are placed within range of the camera, yet imperceptible to the viewers who are focused on the plot of the story.

01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:58.642
Pandemic the Musical has taken this tradition to the next level.

01:54:59.282 --> 01:55:10.627
Hidden throughout the movie are numerous Easter eggs in the form of active QR codes, famous quotes, sacred symbols, sponsor logos, as well as numerous random treasures.

01:55:11.807 --> 01:55:17.610
To incentivize play, we've upped the stakes by offering valuable prizes to 30 winners who find the most Easter eggs.

01:55:18.919 --> 01:55:24.160
For official rules, restrictions, and instructions on how to play, go to plandemic.com.

01:55:24.861 --> 01:55:29.202
That is also the site where you can see all four episodes of the Plandemic Documentary series.

Thanks to our donors, the entire collection is absolutely free of charge.

01:55:33.463 --> 01:55:34.944
Thanks to our donors.

01:55:35.424 --> 01:55:36.344
I wonder who they are.

01:55:37.517 --> 01:55:42.639
We currently have numerous new movies in production, all of which are in service to elevating truth.

01:55:43.159 --> 01:55:46.640
Elevating truth like Alex Jones.

01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:51.922

Thank you for caring and sharing.

01:56:02.925 --> 01:56:03.966
We are just getting warmed up.

01:56:04.026 --> 01:56:04.706
Stay tuned for more.

01:56:11.434 --> 01:56:13.735
Rise up from the ashes.

01:56:14.996 --> 01:56:16.857
Rise up from the flames.

01:56:18.518 --> 01:56:24.242
See through the lies that feed the fires that we create.

01:56:25.602 --> 01:56:27.724
Come out from the shadows.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.222
Gavin DeBecker is an executive producer.

01:56:40.302 --> 01:56:42.943
Gavin DeBecker is the best friend of JFK.

01:56:43.964 --> 01:56:46.865
He has written a lot of books, or sorry, RFK Jr.

01:56:46.905 --> 01:56:47.726
He's the best friend.

01:56:47.766 --> 01:56:57.071
Gavin DeBecker is also the guy that runs the private security company that has Gavin Becker and associates that does all of his security before, you know, whatever.

01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:03.794
He wouldn't want secret service when he's got his own best friend's private security company doing his security.

01:57:03.814 --> 01:57:05.255
Why would he want secret service?

01:57:06.416 --> 01:57:08.958
And yet, before the pandemic, he was fine.

01:57:09.118 --> 01:57:16.242
When he declared that he was a president or a presidential candidate, he started complaining because he wasn't given any secret service protection.

01:57:16.282 --> 01:57:27.329
But he has one of the premier security services is owned by his best friend, Gavin DeBecker, and was already guarding his ass before the pandemic.

01:57:31.124 --> 01:57:33.105
And he's an executive producer here.

01:57:33.325 --> 01:57:34.225
Oh, that's awesome.

01:57:34.345 --> 01:57:39.287
That is freaking awesome.

01:57:47.770 --> 01:57:49.270
Just seeing if I know any of these names.

01:57:57.546 --> 01:58:05.472
naomi lindsey what's that name i wonder don't see ah jill malone i didn't see her but i guess i just wasn't watching for her

01:58:19.721 --> 01:58:21.222
Look at how many cameras there are.

01:58:21.242 --> 01:58:22.704
I mean, those cameras are not cheap.

01:58:22.884 --> 01:58:24.325
All these people are being paid.

01:58:24.425 --> 01:58:26.227
All these lights are being rented.

01:58:26.267 --> 01:58:28.749
This location is being rented.

01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:36.816
It's absolutely positively unexplainable by any other means other than him.

01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:47.956
And Mikovits and Malone and Mickey Willis are all part of the American side of this global operation to control Demolish America.

01:58:48.416 --> 01:58:58.303
He works for the people who govern us with these elaborate theaters, just like Robert Malone does, just like Judy Mikovits does, just like Mickey Willis does.

01:58:59.414 --> 01:59:00.115
They have to be.

01:59:00.895 --> 01:59:02.197
There is no other way.

01:59:02.277 --> 01:59:06.901
It doesn't necessarily need to be DITRA and the US military.

01:59:07.041 --> 01:59:08.823
It doesn't necessarily need to be that.

01:59:08.863 --> 01:59:19.333
It could also be Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, and they're basically pushing the value or pushing the perceived role as free speech place.

01:59:20.514 --> 01:59:21.875
They're pushing that forward.

01:59:21.935 --> 01:59:30.281
He does that on YouTube with his comedy, and all of these other people do it on X with the blessing of Elon Musk.

01:59:30.321 --> 01:59:36.686
They probably are super users that can see the people who block them and do all the other, read DMs, this kind of thing.

01:59:38.587 --> 01:59:41.810
You have to see it for what it is, and we have to see it right now.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.921
X is a military program.

01:59:45.341 --> 01:59:47.202
Facebook is a military program.

01:59:47.702 --> 02:00:08.273
All of these social media platforms are military programs where when we use them, we are submitting ourselves to brainwashing and we are submitting ourselves to the limited spectrum of debate that is very craftily curated by all the content that these people make and the way that they oppose each other.

02:00:08.993 --> 02:00:13.775
The way that they promote each other, the way that they backstab each other is all part of the theater.

02:00:14.256 --> 02:00:17.697
And that's why this movie is so terrible.

02:00:19.898 --> 02:00:38.488
Because if it was a real movie that really wanted to pay attention to the murder and lies that were used to hide the criminal vaccine schedule that all these people apparently knew about before the pandemic, then you need to make movies like this, where you talk about masks and lockdown and rising up and collectivism.

02:00:40.029 --> 02:00:55.019
and you don't talk about the biology that would make everybody responsible for themselves again, would reestablish the sovereignty of the individual and reestablish the irreducible complexity that is a beautiful, perfect baby child.

02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.123
They in no way, shape or form raised that baby up and said, we're not gonna vaccinate this kid.

02:01:02.284 --> 02:01:06.687
Or, oh my goodness, I'm so glad we woke up and didn't transfect this little baby.

02:01:07.694 --> 02:01:10.276
Did they give them an RSV shot during the pregnancy?

02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:13.158
Did she take any COVID shots during the pregnancy?

02:01:13.198 --> 02:01:14.459
Was she given any RSV?

02:01:14.479 --> 02:01:19.502
We don't know because that isn't even an issue in this video, even though it would have been very timely.

02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:35.954
Together we will rise is exactly what a communist chant is.

02:01:39.087 --> 02:01:39.849
We will rise.

02:01:40.170 --> 02:01:41.815
Can't wait any longer.

02:01:42.236 --> 02:01:44.964
It's our time, yeah, it's our time.

02:01:52.099 --> 02:01:54.361
It's 100% bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

02:01:54.481 --> 02:01:57.684
It is absolutely, positively, 100% bullshit.

02:01:58.004 --> 02:02:04.310
And we need to see these bullshitters for who they are, and we need to see them very quickly, or they will get away with it.

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:08.974
Ladies and gentlemen, please, please put these questions in front of Aaron Seery.

02:02:08.994 --> 02:02:15.220
Aaron Seery, why are the terms strict scrutiny and strict liability absent from any of your complaints?

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:23.530
Aaron Siri, can you briefly explain what fundamental right or rights are being violated or suspended by the PrEP Act Emergency Declaration?

02:02:24.111 --> 02:02:30.118
And what are the consequences of or what are the legal ideas that kind of edify

02:02:31.019 --> 02:02:33.740
substantive due process in relation to that?

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:43.021
What are the ideas that edify the idea of strict liability in application to the violation of fundamental rights?

02:02:43.061 --> 02:02:58.964
Because if you can't describe accurately, with accurate legal jargon, the fundamental rights that are being violated by the PREP Act, then you can't argue that the government needs to be held to strict liability instead of the rational basis test.

02:03:00.154 --> 02:03:11.024
And the PREP Act and its emergency declaration, while suspending the Seventh Amendment fundamental right, is held to the rational basis test.

02:03:11.124 --> 02:03:23.355
And you, in your Goldman Sachs experience, seem to be out of your depth with regard to how to challenge a law that allows the suspension of a fundamental right with the rational basis test alone.

02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:37.418
And so he needs to define why it is that he uses these words so ineptly when he uses them and why so many other people that aren't lawyers can figure this shit out and he can't.

02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:43.523
I am very, very abrasive and he doesn't need to like me.

02:03:44.844 --> 02:03:47.566
You don't even need to tell him that the questions come from me.

02:03:50.048 --> 02:03:51.629
But this is how we win.

02:03:52.964 --> 02:03:56.906
because these people are losing the game on purpose.

02:03:59.288 --> 02:04:02.810
This case that I've read over the last couple of days, this is garbage.

02:04:03.690 --> 02:04:05.372
This is somebody throwing the game.

02:04:05.412 --> 02:04:07.453
And do you know why it's somebody throwing the game?

02:04:08.573 --> 02:04:15.838
Because let's read the response that Health and Human Services gave to him

02:04:17.386 --> 02:04:31.155
The plaintiffs likewise fail to state a substantive due process claim because they identify no fundamental right at issue.

02:04:38.934 --> 02:04:49.967
Aaron Seery of Goldman Sachs that's been fighting for ICANN for the last many years has not identified a fundamental right at issue.

02:04:53.331 --> 02:05:01.754
If there's no fundamental right, then I guess the government is under no obligation to prove its reasons and it need only offer them.

02:05:02.234 --> 02:05:10.017
The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.

02:05:11.717 --> 02:05:20.000
If there's no fundamental right being violated, then strict liability is, sorry, strict scrutiny is not the standard to which the government is held.

02:05:20.842 --> 02:05:26.206
It is the rational basis test, which is, as they say, we don't need to prove anything, it can be hypothetical.

02:05:29.309 --> 02:05:36.574
Please understand, Aaron Seery has to be a liar, or incompetent, or both.

02:05:39.977 --> 02:05:47.803
Because he has not identified a fundamental right at issue, and the PREP Act satisfies rational basis review.

02:05:50.202 --> 02:05:58.787
He used the words procedural due process, fundamental procedural due process.

02:05:59.147 --> 02:06:10.473
For any lawyer that has any kind of training at all, those four words combined together should be the biggest ever.

02:06:12.013 --> 02:06:18.397
In my humble opinion, those four words together, unless I'm completely wrong and silly, are the absolute

02:06:20.131 --> 02:06:20.531
That's it.

02:06:22.093 --> 02:06:26.937
Anybody that believes Aaron Seary now is asking for what they get.

02:06:28.518 --> 02:06:32.181
Anybody that thinks that guy's fighting on our behalf deserves what they get.

02:06:33.783 --> 02:06:46.071
Because the plaintiffs have failed to state a substantive due process claim, meaning that substantive due process claims are only present when a fundamental right is being violated.

02:06:46.551 --> 02:06:51.735
And this jackass has not identified the fundamental right at issue.

02:06:55.477 --> 02:06:58.119
Because it's not the time for the Seventh Amendment.

02:06:58.179 --> 02:07:01.021
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry I'm so upset, but this is it.

02:07:01.561 --> 02:07:02.502
This is it.

02:07:06.414 --> 02:07:07.838
And I've been saying it for a while.

02:07:07.878 --> 02:07:13.933
You just need the right case to go to the right circuit court for the right federal judge to say, hey, guess what?

02:07:14.875 --> 02:07:33.584
The PREP Act can be struck on a facial challenge because by its wording alone, not by how it's applied, but by its wording alone, it allows the suspension of a fundamental right with the rational basis test review alone, not requiring substantive due process.

02:07:33.664 --> 02:07:38.807
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an absolute end.

02:07:40.543 --> 02:07:44.508
to this illusion of ICANN and Aaron Seery.

02:07:45.249 --> 02:07:45.790
This is it.

02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:46.571
This is the end.

02:07:48.514 --> 02:07:49.055
It has to be.

02:07:50.205 --> 02:07:56.109
If you want to escape this illusion, if you want to escape the slavers, this is how you escape.

02:07:56.129 --> 02:08:03.455
You need to understand that Aaron Seery has been throwing the game for a while, and it doesn't matter if Dell understands it.

02:08:03.495 --> 02:08:06.737
There are lawyers at CHD who damn well understand it.

02:08:07.438 --> 02:08:11.401
And if Mary Holland doesn't understand it, that's just because she's a pretty shitty lawyer.

02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:14.571
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:14.631 --> 02:08:24.555
can't read what I'm writing here and understand that there's an issue to be picked here, then he's also not competent enough to lead this challenge into the future.

02:08:27.856 --> 02:08:40.661
I know at least one lawyer that probably is good enough to lead this into the future, but she is having a real trouble in California with a case for the last four and a half years or five years or whatever it is.

02:08:43.564 --> 02:08:55.585
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Seery, I can, in these plandemic movies, in retrospect, in looking back, you cannot see anything but meddlers here, people that have purposefully

02:08:57.961 --> 02:09:12.020
assisted in the maintenance of a limited spectrum of debate that includes a limited spectrum of understanding of this legal space so that people would think that he was really writing a great complaint.

02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:13.421
He's really a genius.

02:09:17.915 --> 02:09:28.702
And that's why Aaron Seery, just like Robert Malone and ICANN and all these other people will never talk about how a background signal could have been lied about and how they had plenty of time to characterize it.

02:09:29.062 --> 02:09:33.445
They'll never tell you about how PCR can be accurate, but how it wasn't.

02:09:33.926 --> 02:09:38.509
And they will never tell you how even in its purest form, transfection was never going to be good.

02:09:38.529 --> 02:09:41.751
We knew that because we were selling products and using them in academic benches.

02:09:42.151 --> 02:09:58.620
We're never going to tell you that they already had names for those products because then they would have to show you that those names were on Robert Malone's resume because he almost was part of basically defining those terms along with David Baltimore and Murray Gardner and Gallo and Fauci.

02:09:59.895 --> 02:10:17.180
And so the semantic game that is being played with infectious clone in the viral literature is being ignored by the no-virus people because again, it would illustrate that those people as well as Mikovits and Robert Malone were running a very careful script.

02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:24.102
And the careful script of the no-virus people also prevented the realization

02:10:25.606 --> 02:10:37.669
that there were simple truths and obvious lies that were being agreed upon by all of these people to usefully enslave us with this mythology, and that's why they can't go and say RNA can't pandemic.

02:10:42.269 --> 02:10:42.930
Don't talk about 2020.

02:10:46.090 --> 02:10:54.132
Don't talk about endemicity versus background, and definitely, definitely, definitely make sure you realize that the COVID shots are bad, but we can fix them.

02:10:56.442 --> 02:10:59.283
We need a new consensus, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:59.323 --> 02:11:02.283
We need definitely a new consensus.

02:11:03.744 --> 02:11:08.565
If you liked what you saw today, please go to giggleandbiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

02:11:08.605 --> 02:11:09.965
I need all the help I can get.

02:11:10.985 --> 02:11:21.488
I have found out officially yesterday that Scott Shara, Grace's dad, and his wife are actually coming to Pittsburgh for November 3rd and will

02:11:22.188 --> 02:11:28.293
Present i'm going to give them an hour on stage an hour on the live stream They're going to be here exclusively for our meeting.

02:11:28.333 --> 02:11:46.447
And so I am absolutely humbled by the fact that he's decided to come And so it is with great excitement that I beg you if you have the means to get to pennsylvania and to get to pittsburgh For november 3rd or that weekend of the brownstone Please don't hesitate to come it could be one of the

02:11:47.435 --> 02:12:00.644
one of the little mini turning points of this, where we really come together, and the right people shake hands, the right people hug, the right people earn each other's trust in person, is a really hard thing to break.

02:12:01.625 --> 02:12:14.293
One of the reasons why they've had so much trouble with Mark and I, is because over the course of these five years, we've shared a hotel room a couple times, we've shared a cross-state rental car drive, and so,

02:12:16.164 --> 02:12:19.307
It's pretty hard to lie to somebody for that long.

02:12:19.667 --> 02:12:23.150
And it's pretty hard not to know somebody when you spend that much time together.

02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:28.655
And so I think we're getting there, ladies and gentlemen.

02:12:28.695 --> 02:12:33.079
I think the independent bright web is starting to actually build and blossom.

02:12:33.859 --> 02:12:41.946
And it is because of all of you sharing our work, trusting us, believing in us, believing in our collective, you and me and all of us.

02:12:44.028 --> 02:12:45.928
And it ain't gonna stop, it's only gonna get better.

02:12:46.569 --> 02:12:49.789
And I hope that you will notice that very soon, that it's getting better.

02:12:51.490 --> 02:12:57.871
And I look forward very much to the stuff that I'm going to do in the next couple weeks in preparation for November 3rd.

02:12:58.351 --> 02:13:06.113
And of course, the Red Pill Conference that is coming two weeks later, November 16th and 17th in Oklahoma.

02:13:06.193 --> 02:13:11.135
So, November is gonna be pretty intense.

02:13:14.161 --> 02:13:17.465
And so I hope you'll stick around for it.

02:13:17.545 --> 02:13:18.406
Love you all very much.

02:13:18.906 --> 02:13:21.850
And I'll see what I can do about tomorrow.

02:14:29.949 --> 02:14:33.972
I got to say, ladies and gentlemen, the only way we're going to get there is if we go hard in the paint.

02:14:34.012 --> 02:14:35.793
You can't take it easy on them anymore.

02:14:36.174 --> 02:14:37.835
And so that's what I'm doing here.

02:14:38.355 --> 02:14:40.017
Somebody's got to go hard in the paint.

02:14:40.097 --> 02:14:41.898
So it's got to be me.

02:14:41.958 --> 02:14:42.498
That's fine.

02:14:42.598 --> 02:14:44.560
I've been posting up my whole life.

02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.002
So throw it to me, guys.

02:14:47.362 --> 02:14:47.822
I got you.

02:15:01.696 --> 02:15:03.500
Whoa, hey, what's going on there?

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:04.322
See you guys later.
