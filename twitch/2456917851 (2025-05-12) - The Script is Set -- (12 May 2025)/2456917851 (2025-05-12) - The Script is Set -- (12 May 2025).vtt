WEBVTT

00:09.895 --> 00:10.456
Okay.

00:38.356 --> 00:39.157
Trust me.

00:39.637 --> 00:42.439
It's real.

00:42.639 --> 00:44.981
It's real.

00:45.141 --> 00:46.982
Full speed, Kevin.

00:48.843 --> 00:49.984
Into the wall.

00:50.845 --> 00:51.765
The tunnel, I mean.

01:02.153 --> 01:19.980
uh six years back i asked one question i never got an answer from anyone do you know anyone that died from kovid it's the fog of antibodies war and the procrastination of the fall of the dollar you're getting fuked up the arse i don't know what that means dude um there's look from where i'm sitting there's a whole bunch of kovid brain going around

01:21.136 --> 01:23.357
Do I know anyone that died from a heart attack?

01:23.397 --> 01:26.720
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.479
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.182
Taught who?

01:49.202 --> 01:50.764
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:50.944 --> 01:58.575
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of Echo Health into the WIV because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

01:59.256 --> 01:59.896
Obama did that, right?

01:59.916 --> 02:00.476
Obama did that.

02:00.516 --> 02:11.640
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.801
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

02:13.821 --> 02:15.141
It's going through some intermediary.

02:16.041 --> 02:27.865
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seum technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

02:28.946 --> 02:33.049
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

02:34.271 --> 02:38.935
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it necessarily from a laboratory.

02:39.776 --> 02:45.882
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

02:46.522 --> 02:49.965
And if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

02:50.046 --> 02:53.569
Charles Rixey has helped RFK write his book about this.

02:54.431 --> 02:59.809
And Charles Rixey's a marine and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.482
And he was the one who leaked the diffuse proposal.

03:03.702 --> 03:05.163
Are you familiar with the diffuse proposal?

03:05.183 --> 03:05.823
No, what is that?

03:06.004 --> 03:18.972
So there was a grant that was proposed to the DOD to go build a weaponized coronavirus under the banner of, we need to build a vaccine against this, because if we can do it, the Chinese can do it kind of thing.

03:19.473 --> 03:22.314
And the DOD turned down the grant because they thought it was too fucking crazy.

03:23.395 --> 03:24.556
You'll have something to leak from this.

03:26.277 --> 03:30.040
But as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.742
You've got like $30 million in grants from NIH.

03:33.122 --> 03:35.584
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

03:36.084 --> 03:38.526
It's just, you're looking for the last 20%.

03:39.647 --> 03:41.308
Because you just can't.

03:41.328 --> 03:50.715
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows we can get Xed on, we've demonstrated this piece, we've demonstrated this piece.

03:51.115 --> 03:52.516
Now we just need to do this last piece.

03:53.777 --> 03:59.821
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

03:59.961 --> 04:03.102
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

04:04.443 --> 04:07.925
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

04:08.545 --> 04:18.331
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain letters.

04:18.991 --> 04:20.252
Those are what restrictions are.

04:20.272 --> 04:22.073
So imagine you can only cut and paste where there's a the.

04:22.973 --> 04:29.218
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

04:29.738 --> 04:37.944
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with their, which is a couple more letters onto the, right?

04:37.984 --> 04:39.525
And we're going to use those enzymes to cut here.

04:41.772 --> 04:43.733
Testing one, two, test, test one, two.

04:43.793 --> 04:45.473
It's a spectacular commitment to lies.

04:45.513 --> 04:46.654
That's all you need to do.

04:47.354 --> 04:53.196
That's all Kevin McKernan is, is a man spectacularly committed to a great big lie.

04:53.816 --> 04:56.877
And once you see it, you can't unsee it, ladies and gentlemen.

04:57.878 --> 05:00.219
Oh, look, JC on a bike was timed out by Risa.

05:00.479 --> 05:02.079
Oh, timeout JC on a bike.

05:03.120 --> 05:03.980
JC on a bike.

05:04.867 --> 05:05.327
It's J.C.

05:05.447 --> 05:06.008
on the bike.

05:06.828 --> 05:07.309
It's J.C.

05:07.389 --> 05:09.030
on the bike, yeah.

05:09.670 --> 05:15.874
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chump needs banning, and I know just the one.

05:16.734 --> 05:17.595
Look it round.

05:17.955 --> 05:18.435
It's J.C.

05:18.515 --> 05:19.076
on the bike.

05:19.676 --> 05:21.797
Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

05:26.080 --> 05:27.841
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

05:27.861 --> 05:33.805
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.211
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:38.552 --> 05:39.392
It's embarrassing.

05:45.116 --> 05:47.017
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

05:47.117 --> 06:00.025
His name is JJ Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD, and I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

06:03.166 --> 06:03.666
Actually, J.J.

06:03.686 --> 06:10.329
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

06:11.109 --> 06:11.589
Actually, J.J.

06:11.629 --> 06:18.252
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

06:19.032 --> 06:19.512
Actually, J.J.

06:19.552 --> 06:26.155
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

06:26.955 --> 06:27.455
Actually, J.J.

06:27.475 --> 06:34.117
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

06:36.958 --> 06:43.159
In condition that we will not call autism, I don't like the word autism, he was vaccine damaged.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.900
He was neurologically damaged,

06:45.689 --> 06:48.391
A condition that we will not call autism.

06:48.531 --> 06:50.092
I don't like the word autism.

06:50.972 --> 06:52.053
He was vaccine damaged.

06:52.373 --> 06:53.814
He was neurologically damaged.

06:54.555 --> 06:57.256
A condition that we will not call autism.

06:57.396 --> 06:58.937
I don't like the word autism.

06:59.838 --> 07:00.898
He was vaccine damaged.

07:02.519 --> 07:05.681
Now, Dr. Gallin, Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

07:06.162 --> 07:07.943
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

07:09.944 --> 07:10.344
Isolation?

07:10.384 --> 07:10.745
What was that?

07:10.885 --> 07:11.985
Isolation and purification.

07:13.806 --> 07:14.467
Of the virus?

07:16.067 --> 07:27.113
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

07:27.793 --> 07:32.655
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

07:33.436 --> 07:35.457
I don't understand what the issue.

07:35.577 --> 07:41.019
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.261
No, it depends on how they used it.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.577
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

07:50.100 --> 07:52.062
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

07:52.122 --> 07:58.170
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

07:58.250 --> 08:00.273
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

08:05.972 --> 08:14.995
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

08:15.015 --> 08:24.018
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

08:24.058 --> 08:32.521
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

08:34.386 --> 08:39.192
A stained soul cringes at the small details in the mirror of embarrassment.

09:00.434 --> 09:05.099
You've done got your power, thinkin' everything's fine.

09:05.119 --> 09:09.864
Givin' yourself credit, sayin' about what's next.

09:35.754 --> 09:53.830
No egos underwater I see you in your fancy hair Ain't no ego Never an ego No egos under You're a man of position Go clean off that land

10:09.309 --> 10:13.372
All the folks that knew you are going to say farewell.

11:30.388 --> 11:31.073
Everything is

12:31.431 --> 12:33.773
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.876
This is GigaOM Biological, where we stay focused on the biology.

12:36.916 --> 12:39.678
We don't take the bait on social media.

12:39.718 --> 12:43.402
That's just a military social control software suite.

12:44.122 --> 12:45.083
And we love our neighbors.

12:45.163 --> 12:48.266
We know who they are, and we take care of them.

12:48.286 --> 12:51.889
We have a lot of neighbors on the internet, too, and we need to build that neighborhood as well.

12:51.970 --> 12:56.674
But make sure you're talking to your neighbors, you have friends with your neighbors, you know who your neighbors are.

12:57.517 --> 12:59.598
It's going to become important in the next few years.

12:59.818 --> 13:07.523
I assure you it is going to become very, very important in the next few years for you to know your neighbors and for them to trust you.

13:08.684 --> 13:09.565
Welcome to the show.

13:09.645 --> 13:18.410
I'm a little goofing up on the music because I was going to play something else and then I decided I wanted to start with a little bit more uplifting business.

13:19.631 --> 13:23.614
And then I've been daydreaming here and what should have happened there was that.

13:27.246 --> 13:31.849
And then I would be over here and I would just be able to go something like this.

13:32.729 --> 13:38.512
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the voice you hear, Jonathan Cooey, a chief biologist out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

13:40.173 --> 13:45.775
I am also, my stuff is a lot of on this sub stack called Woodhouse 76.

13:45.935 --> 13:54.540
I don't have direct editing access, but they do use a lot of my ideas over to argue with Claire Craig and Pierre Corey and Mike Eden.

13:55.240 --> 14:02.143
and even Jay Bhattacharya, a good friend of mine, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also a good friend of mine.

14:02.163 --> 14:08.085
We had a nice relationship while we wrote this book, Wuhan Cover-Up, or I helped him write that.

14:08.945 --> 14:12.987
You are now at gigaohmbiological.com, stream.gigaohm.bio.

14:14.708 --> 14:25.042
or GigaOMBiological on Twitch, thanks for being here, RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injections are dumb, and transfection is and always was a crime in healthy people.

14:25.943 --> 14:29.508
The population pyramid is a real problem that they are

14:30.149 --> 14:35.856
managing and I'm playing around with this introduction and how to start it and mix it up during the week.

14:36.817 --> 14:45.827
If you want to be notified that I'm going to go on sometime or not go on sometime, you can get notified by sending an email to gigaohmhq at proton.me.

14:47.248 --> 14:51.851
If you put notify me in the subject, that would help my wife out a lot.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.894
Biology is the way, welcome to the show.

14:55.914 --> 15:01.538
We're going to start with a video that will maybe be familiar with a lot of people.

15:01.618 --> 15:10.344
I was on the Kim Iverson show a couple weeks ago, a couple, two, three weeks ago now, and I can't even really remember

15:11.677 --> 15:14.579
If it went anywhere, if anybody even watched it on YouTube.

15:14.639 --> 15:18.041
But she does move from subject to subject.

15:18.541 --> 15:20.142
I guess I'm not really on the screen.

15:21.943 --> 15:23.744
She does move from subject to subject.

15:24.364 --> 15:37.232
She moves from satanic kid cults, to the vaccine, to yesterday or the day before she just interviewed a guy who's like a communist with four passports around the world.

15:38.172 --> 15:45.537
Um, I don't, I don't really know what's going on on social media, except that the truth is not freely available.

15:45.717 --> 15:57.184
And the more financial support that somebody gets on the internet, the more likely it is that they are part of a limited spectrum of debate wittingly or unwittingly.

15:57.998 --> 16:18.697
if they pay you enough to take a rumble contract and to interview the people that provide that list of people that you're going to interview so that you can provide that regular content, maybe provide you with an editor or provide you with a sound guy or maybe even somebody who does your social media, now all of a sudden

16:19.718 --> 16:40.080
It's more difficult to say well today I I guess I have to interview such-and-such and so-and-so and then they get to say whatever they say and Sure, you can push back with a snarky comment or two But the better these people are with their limited spectrum of debate their narrative their little talking points the better this all goes and so with regard to

16:41.441 --> 16:58.328
watching other people's content, understand that what I'm trying to do is function as a kind of filter so that you can hear what I might hear and see what I might see when these people are very carefully walking around the elephant in the room, which is never the elephant in the room that they're talking about.

16:58.368 --> 16:59.449
They always have an elephant.

17:00.189 --> 17:02.732
Um, but it's not the one that's not the real one.

17:02.792 --> 17:03.453
It never is.

17:04.214 --> 17:15.807
Um, and so let's see, um, how badly Kim fumbles the ball here on the illusion that Casey means is some kind of a bad guy and understand from the perspective of

17:17.745 --> 17:29.549
From the perspective of how I feel about this, I do think that she's probably an unwitting participant in the sense of she's a media person.

17:29.589 --> 17:30.889
She wants to be on TV.

17:31.389 --> 17:35.250
She was told a couple of years ago that the new TV is going to be the internet.

17:35.290 --> 17:40.392
The new TV might be Rumble or Rockin' or Rolfkin or Locals or whatever.

17:40.812 --> 17:43.333
And if you want to be ahead of this, you better get a sub stack.

17:43.353 --> 17:47.414
You better start putting stuff here, there and get a contract, which she did.

17:48.177 --> 17:57.124
And there are a lot of people who fit right into this bubble where the new media, the new way that the narrative is gonna be controlled is on social media.

17:57.204 --> 17:58.085
And why is that?

17:58.165 --> 18:01.307
Well, because that's a global reach kind of thing.

18:01.347 --> 18:11.214
That's not the local newscaster anymore, trying to step from ABC 11 in Pittsburgh or whatever it is.

18:11.234 --> 18:12.555
I don't know if ABC is four.

18:13.496 --> 18:15.899
and maybe NBC News is 11, I don't even know.

18:16.700 --> 18:25.349
But, you know, to step from the local station to the regional station or to the national station, that's how news people thought of themselves.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.392
They didn't think of themselves so much as reporters.

18:29.253 --> 18:34.777
journalists anymore, but just as people who were going to get in that chair and read that teleprompter and do it well.

18:35.878 --> 18:37.119
And that was okay.

18:37.139 --> 18:42.142
It was a joke on Seinfeld that she wants to be an actor or a dancer or a newscaster.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.344
And so this is just

18:45.965 --> 18:50.087
Nothing against her, but she wants to be in the media.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.209
She likes to be in the media.

18:52.689 --> 18:55.110
You could say that I might like to be in the media.

18:55.150 --> 18:59.533
I certainly don't mind doing this, but what I like about it is very different.

18:59.573 --> 19:07.277
What I like about it is the thing that I'm doing when I do this, and when I do this, and when I do this.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.137
I like this.

19:08.457 --> 19:10.238
I think this is cool to set it up.

19:10.819 --> 19:12.720
That's why, you know, I have,

19:13.737 --> 19:17.618
an obscene number, oh wait, whoa, see, I can set it up and I don't even know how to run it.

19:17.958 --> 19:23.900
I have an obscene number of old Japanese, you know, weird combinations of optics.

19:23.920 --> 19:24.580
Look at this thing.

19:25.160 --> 19:30.461
And the picture that it makes, if it's, if they're good, I get obsessed with little things like that.

19:30.521 --> 19:39.744
And unfortunately for these bad guys, setting up a stream rig and operating it with skill is a,

19:40.834 --> 19:42.035
was it's a joke.

19:42.755 --> 19:44.657
Like this is easy.

19:45.237 --> 19:49.821
You know, the most annoying thing is, is when somebody's driver updates without my permission.

19:49.881 --> 19:56.266
Like the other than that, like that's why that making fun of this is what I find hilarious.

19:56.346 --> 20:03.912
This person has multiple people helping her and she can't pull off the production that I can pull off live.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.694
I mean, think about that for a second.

20:08.015 --> 20:21.097
These people are in really big trouble because with very little support, actually the support necessary for a family of five to rent a house in Pittsburgh, this show can go on.

20:22.038 --> 20:23.918
I mean, think about that, ladies and gentlemen.

20:23.958 --> 20:35.040
This show right here might need $25,000 a month and it might pull in $25,000 a month with all of its supporters and the number of ad reads she does.

20:35.950 --> 20:40.513
The number of viewers she gets, I don't know what she can sell her ad reads for, but I'm sure it ain't cheap.

20:42.034 --> 20:47.777
And so this is a bologna sandwiches and juice box kind of operation here.

20:47.817 --> 20:48.838
And I'm very proud of it.

20:50.579 --> 20:53.741
That we don't require much more than $40,000 a year to run.

20:53.821 --> 20:54.561
And our taxes prove it.

20:58.595 --> 21:08.837
And so while all these other people are traveling the world and doing all this stuff, this is all happening because me and my wife and my kids believe in each other.

21:09.558 --> 21:11.258
And more importantly, they believe in Papa.

21:13.218 --> 21:24.081
I don't know what this is, but I know that this is influenced by lots and lots of different people and money and ulterior motives.

21:25.100 --> 21:30.162
And if you support Gigaohm Biological at gigaohmbiological.com, you're supporting five people.

21:30.842 --> 21:36.605
And by keeping those five people okay, this stream happens all the time, forever.

21:37.305 --> 21:38.606
And it's only gonna get better.

21:38.926 --> 21:43.348
Can you imagine a scenario where Gigaohm Biological had an AM radio station?

21:43.848 --> 21:44.708
Holy shit.

21:45.449 --> 21:50.951
Guess who's a ham radio operator for the last, I don't know, is it 12 years?

21:50.991 --> 21:53.212
I got certified in Norway, so I don't really remember.

21:53.837 --> 21:54.518
Yeah, that's right.

21:54.739 --> 21:59.007
I took the ham radio licensing in Norway and passed in Norwegian.

22:01.792 --> 22:02.854
Let's go with this one.

22:03.524 --> 22:09.987
For those of you watching this on YouTube, we had to make some edits to this segment in order for us to try to evade the censors.

22:10.027 --> 22:15.610
We're not allowed to have common sense conversations on YouTube when it comes to certain topics.

22:15.690 --> 22:20.313
So the episode, this segment has not been edited.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.534
We've just muted certain words.

22:22.554 --> 22:23.975
You'll probably figure out what that word is.

22:25.315 --> 22:33.661
the V word, we had to mute that word throughout to hopefully try to evade sensors, but it's still probably going to be demonetized.

22:33.681 --> 22:35.222
We're just hoping I don't get hit with a strike.

22:35.623 --> 22:36.123
We'll find out.

22:40.066 --> 22:46.609
I hope I don't get a strike.

22:46.989 --> 22:49.050
What a joke.

22:49.190 --> 22:54.613
Okay, so right there we started with what I would consider to be an assumption.

22:55.453 --> 23:01.216
A huge rift has evolved in the Maha movement thanks to the nomination of Casey Means.

23:02.156 --> 23:06.358
I want to suggest to you that if you're going to use social media safely,

23:09.324 --> 23:20.127
then you need to understand that the opening statement already needs to be put under the highest scrutiny because that opening statement is not just something that she pulled out of her head right now.

23:22.648 --> 23:25.829
A huge rift has evolved or what?

23:26.269 --> 23:31.451
I'm going to play it again because I want to know exactly what words she used because that's how I think you should think about it too.

23:33.932 --> 23:35.072
I got to go back over here.

23:35.933 --> 23:43.948
Paul Shanahan coming out swinging, saying, mute that word throughout to hopefully try to evade censors.

23:43.968 --> 23:45.591
But it's still probably going to be demonetized.

23:45.611 --> 23:47.154
We're just hoping I don't get hit with a strike.

23:47.555 --> 23:48.055
We'll find out.

23:52.605 --> 23:56.766
Well, a huge divide has formed in the Maha movement over Trump's latest nominee for U.S.

23:56.806 --> 23:59.106
Surgeon General, Dr. A huge divide.

23:59.166 --> 24:04.628
Now, what that implies is that there's a huge engagement, like a lot of people give a shit.

24:04.928 --> 24:06.428
And I don't think that that's true.

24:06.468 --> 24:07.748
I apologize for this.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.589
You know, I'm an adult.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.629
I'm going to talk to you like an adult sometimes.

24:11.669 --> 24:14.970
And occasionally the S word might come out because that's kind of how I talk.

24:16.451 --> 24:19.252
And I apologize if that offends anybody here.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.773
But that's what's happening.

24:22.413 --> 24:24.373
We are being told what to think.

24:25.934 --> 24:34.216
Even if she doesn't understand that she's telling us what to think, or the people that wrote her script are telling her what to think, us what to think, that's what's happening.

24:34.236 --> 24:37.657
So there's supposed to be a huge divide all around this woman.

24:37.697 --> 24:39.117
And what will that divide cause?

24:39.537 --> 24:41.378
A discussion about this woman.

24:45.413 --> 24:46.194
by design.

24:46.915 --> 24:50.118
So this is obviously something that they want us to talk about.

24:50.158 --> 24:51.760
So how are we going to talk about it, Kim?

24:51.800 --> 24:52.501
What's the script?

25:01.971 --> 25:08.274
We're going to go over why Dr. Casey Means is controversial and why some in the Maha movement love her and others absolutely do not.

25:08.754 --> 25:10.815
First, here's Trump's announcement.

25:10.835 --> 25:11.616
It says,

25:17.799 --> 25:23.883
So what I'm arguing again or trying to, I don't know if this is coaching, I guess it is coaching, it's social media coaching.

25:23.943 --> 25:33.070
I want you to see that she is trying to tell you that people out there on social media agree that this is important.

25:34.211 --> 25:40.655
So here's Donald Trump's announcement and we'll start here because that's where everybody else is starting.

25:41.316 --> 25:42.176
Can you see it yet?

25:42.296 --> 25:44.718
I just hope you see what I'm trying to show you here.

25:46.519 --> 25:49.971
Make sure I got all my stuff warmed up.

25:49.991 --> 25:51.055
Okay.

25:52.435 --> 25:59.859
Casey has impeccable Maha credentials and will work closely with our wonderful Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

26:00.279 --> 26:06.323
to ensure... By the way, I wanted to let you know that I found something on eBay the other day and I'm wearing them right now and I'm really excited about it.

26:06.343 --> 26:13.146
I'm going to try and wear clothing on the JC on a hardwood videos that are from the before time.

26:13.406 --> 26:17.429
And these, I found a collection of Charlotte Bobcats.

26:18.149 --> 26:21.791
That's an actual NBA team from the before time.

26:22.291 --> 26:28.875
And I even got their shorts on right now, which is just so, so super cool because like nobody has this stuff anymore.

26:28.975 --> 26:36.779
And it's actually a team that I think, as far as I understand it, Michael Jordan bought when they were the Bobcats and then it became the Charlotte Hornets.

26:36.839 --> 26:37.739
It's a long story.

26:37.779 --> 26:40.420
But anyway, these are clothes from the before time.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.442
So they have like pre-coronavirus coronaviruses built into them.

26:44.543 --> 26:45.003
It's sweet.

26:45.984 --> 26:54.469
were a successful implementation of our agenda in order to reverse the chronic disease epidemic and ensure great health in the future for all Americans.

26:54.830 --> 26:59.273
Her academic achievements, together with her life's work, are absolutely astounding.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.895
Dr. Casey Means has the potential to be one of the first Surgeon Generals in the United

27:03.095 --> 27:05.556
I see somebody in the chat already understands it.

27:05.576 --> 27:07.897
I wonder if I can slap the chat up here for a second.

27:08.477 --> 27:10.498
He says, you mean Grady means his daughter?

27:10.518 --> 27:14.920
And actually that's part of what this is happening here, right?

27:14.960 --> 27:17.782
That's what's part of what's happening here is a

27:19.835 --> 27:21.316
a sort of focus on her.

27:22.077 --> 27:42.771
I saw a whole video on YouTube yesterday that said that she was a witch, and that there were all these things that she, code words that she used for all the witch rituals that she did, which might be true, but that gets, it gets us arguing about those ideas.

27:43.792 --> 27:54.090
It starts to get us to argue about whether witches exist and whether these new age people are real and whether those ideas are legitimate or not.

27:55.120 --> 28:09.587
And so you're spending time thinking about that the moment you go down the rabbit hole of Dr. Casey means, which is remarkable because again, if you remember the whole idea is for them every day, trying to waste as many of your thoughts as they can.

28:10.367 --> 28:13.308
That's the simplest explanation for social media.

28:13.748 --> 28:16.330
It is a means by which they can waste your thoughts.

28:17.330 --> 28:19.251
They can get you to go down rabbit holes.

28:19.611 --> 28:21.952
Oh my gosh, that term is so ridiculous.

28:23.593 --> 28:23.893
Here we go.

28:24.986 --> 28:26.547
It's in United States history.

28:27.768 --> 28:28.448
No, sorry.

28:28.488 --> 28:33.352
Dr. Casey means has the potential to be one of the finest surgeon generals in United States history.

28:33.472 --> 28:34.793
Congratulations to Casey.

28:35.153 --> 28:39.296
Secretary Kennedy looks forward to working with I didn't see that civil war.

28:41.601 --> 28:44.964
I guess that maybe she is doing some of her own production.

28:46.064 --> 28:50.328
Dr. Jeanette Nishawut in another capacity at HHS.

28:51.629 --> 28:57.133
The other doctor was the original nominee for Surgeon General, but then is moved and now they're doing.

28:57.313 --> 28:59.535
The original one was a Fox host.

28:59.695 --> 29:00.155
Come on.

29:00.756 --> 29:02.357
Now they've nominated Dr. Casey Means.

29:02.757 --> 29:05.579
And he goes on to say, thank you for your attention to this matter.

29:07.061 --> 29:07.381
Okay.

29:07.461 --> 29:07.861
So, um,

29:09.966 --> 29:10.887
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:10.987 --> 29:13.088
also, of course, had his own announcement.

29:13.108 --> 29:14.449
This is what he said.

29:15.610 --> 29:24.336
He says, the Surgeon General is a symbol of moral authority who stands against the financial and institutional gravities that tend to corporatize medicine.

29:24.956 --> 29:31.540
I really wonder if that's an accurate characterization of what the Surgeon General post was originally designed to do.

29:32.021 --> 29:35.943
And I will confess that I have not yet researched that enough to understand.

29:36.023 --> 29:39.586
But it's I think it's a little bit more like of an ambassador more than anything else.

29:40.346 --> 30:06.917
Casey means was born to hold this job She will provide our country with ethical guidance wisdom and gold standard medical advice even when it challenges popular orthodoxies She will be a juggernaut against the ossified medical Conventions that have helped make our people the sickest in the world at the highest cost per capita Casey is a breath of fresh air and we can't wait for her to get her start at HHS gov Thank You President Trump for nominating this outstanding woman but

30:09.625 --> 30:10.505
Not everybody's thrilled.

30:10.725 --> 30:11.586
So you got Donald Trump.

30:11.706 --> 30:19.508
But not one person has had any meaningful discussion about who got appointed to the head of the CDC.

30:19.568 --> 30:25.270
Nobody's talking about who got appointed to the US Department of Agriculture.

30:27.891 --> 30:30.012
Nobody's talking about that at all.

30:30.572 --> 30:33.533
Everybody's got all their mind off of Jay Bhattacharya now.

30:33.773 --> 30:36.274
Oh, who cares if Jay Bhattacharya is at NIH?

30:36.294 --> 30:38.535
We gotta argue about Casey now.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.198
Who cares?

30:40.758 --> 30:43.460
They're not talking about secretary Kennedy anymore.

30:44.421 --> 30:50.365
We're talking about Casey means while Robert F. Kennedy is still the head of the FDA.

30:50.865 --> 30:54.368
Marty McCarry is still the head of the FDA.

30:54.428 --> 30:54.788
Sorry.

30:54.848 --> 31:00.813
And, and he's the head of HHS and, and Jay Bhattacharya is at NIH and we're already moving on.

31:00.873 --> 31:02.414
The wheel has already turned.

31:04.065 --> 31:09.768
And look how much agreement there is across the internet that this is the important thing.

31:10.288 --> 31:14.170
The Secretary General is like, it's an important post.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.151
How can we possibly have her there?

31:17.961 --> 31:21.323
making the announcement saying this is great for the Maha movement, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:21.363 --> 31:28.527
coming out saying she's great, but we've got some major players inside the Maha movement that are saying, uh-uh, this is not good.

31:28.968 --> 31:30.108
Here is Nicole Shanahan.

31:30.168 --> 31:32.590
This is Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

31:32.570 --> 31:33.390
's VP pick.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.632
She largely funded his campaign.

31:36.492 --> 31:41.815
She largely funded his campaign, and now she's relevant, apparently.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.538
She went from being nobody

31:46.425 --> 31:53.711
but somebody's wife, as I understood it, to being a rich somebody who funded his campaign.

31:53.791 --> 32:06.822
And now apparently Kim and Steve Bannon and all these people think that her input and her ideas are really at the forefront.

32:06.902 --> 32:08.904
I mean, she is so brilliant.

32:10.609 --> 32:15.271
And my big criticism with Nicole when he chose her as VP is one, none of us had ever heard of her.

32:15.752 --> 32:22.515
Two, my biggest, well, and two, the fact that she had funded his campaign, she was his largest donor.

32:22.555 --> 32:25.637
So it just looked like- I'm sorry, I'm gonna put this chat up there.

32:25.857 --> 32:28.138
I question this six girl.

32:28.818 --> 32:31.639
I question the idea that she was the mom of a Vax kid.

32:31.800 --> 32:38.503
I just found an interview this morning where I listened to her talking about how she has a friend

32:40.011 --> 32:49.824
whose kid was injured, and talking about advocating for that friend, and it seemed very much like there was no connection between them.

32:50.785 --> 32:53.849
And so the connection, I think, with regard to

32:54.844 --> 33:01.489
with Nicole is that Nicole has claimed to have a kid with autism, not a kid that's vaccine injured, although I could be wrong.

33:01.989 --> 33:07.933
And I would be very skeptical of it at this point, because she's not stuck to that narrative very strongly.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.374
And that could be private.

33:09.814 --> 33:10.875
I'm totally down with that.

33:11.295 --> 33:15.959
Or it could be that she didn't have one of these profound autism kids.

33:16.559 --> 33:38.226
And so again, we're dealing with something here where people are not being honest about what it is that happened, what it is that they know, what it is that they've experienced, but they're getting on this either dumb, simple, you know, narrative about autism and autism spectrum disorder is real and it's caused by vaccines or glyphosate or toxic something or other.

33:40.647 --> 33:40.867
Right?

33:40.907 --> 33:45.389
That's the only thing that they can possibly be on and that autism is real.

33:47.222 --> 33:48.303
It's, it's remarkable.

33:49.063 --> 33:53.706
I'm just, I'm flabbergasted at what happened over the last few days and what people said.

33:54.387 --> 33:57.429
She'd bought her way in, you know, it's just politics as usual.

33:57.449 --> 33:59.970
Somebody pays a lot of money and they get a big slot in the cabinet.

34:00.410 --> 34:01.511
So that was a criticism.

34:01.551 --> 34:02.652
But my biggest criticism.

34:02.732 --> 34:06.734
No, I'm not, I'm not dissing the person in my chat, of course, I'm having a discussion with her.

34:06.815 --> 34:07.755
She's been here a lot.

34:07.815 --> 34:09.436
And so I respect her opinion a lot.

34:09.476 --> 34:10.317
And I just wanted to be

34:11.283 --> 34:18.117
I want to be hyper aware of the fact that skepticism is never inappropriate at this point.

34:19.551 --> 34:22.813
You know, it's a little harsh skepticism of me, please, please.

34:23.133 --> 34:26.255
Some of her more than anything was that she hadn't been battle tested.

34:26.295 --> 34:32.199
And what I meant by that was we didn't know how she would be when like shit hits the fan.

34:32.319 --> 34:36.502
Is she going to actually stand her ground or is she going to cave to pressure?

34:37.162 --> 34:40.684
And I got to say, Nicole has proven herself.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.366
She is now officially battle tested.

34:43.526 --> 34:46.808
She stands up against anybody and it doesn't matter who it is.

34:47.048 --> 34:48.629
She's battle tested now.

34:48.689 --> 35:04.820
Remember that during the campaign, we have a video of Nicole Shanahan arguing for all of the medical data all around the world to be put together into one collection so that we can solve the chronic disease problem around the world.

35:04.920 --> 35:05.921
She said that.

35:07.882 --> 35:16.208
So it's strange that over the next 20 minutes or so, we're going to listen to her say that Casey means had a company that's harvesting biometric data.

35:18.078 --> 35:25.801
I would argue that right now, genetic data and medical data is far more valuable than biometric data.

35:25.901 --> 35:36.606
It may be that someday they would like to have biometric data or they make it a device that's really useful and tracks a lot of stuff, but the idea that

35:38.382 --> 35:42.143
the data thereafter is the stuff in your Fitbit is just a joke.

35:42.443 --> 35:48.245
Like, I'm sorry, I don't want to, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, feel free to send me all kinds of bad emails.

35:48.325 --> 35:52.366
But I don't think any of these devices really matter yet.

35:53.327 --> 36:03.170
It is an illusion that they're going to collect all this data via devices when they're collecting it via swabs, they're collecting it by a by a remnant, and they're collecting it by computer.

36:06.207 --> 36:10.088
And they don't need your heart rate from your iPhone, even though they get it.

36:10.368 --> 36:13.829
They don't need your temperature from your iPhone, even though they get it.

36:13.869 --> 36:18.171
What they really want is your entire medical record and a regular swab.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.632
They want you to be available for testing in the future.

36:23.692 --> 36:25.073
That's what this is about.

36:27.239 --> 36:30.060
including Bobby Kennedy, this is what she wrote.

36:30.680 --> 36:39.383
This is in response to Dr. Suzanne Humphreys writing, Dr. Jack Kruse tried to tell us Mary Talley Bowen was on the podcast too.

36:39.543 --> 36:41.643
She knows the deal with means, which I'm going to.

36:41.663 --> 36:50.386
So there, there she is saying that, that she is saying, Oh no, that's the wrong book.

36:53.359 --> 37:09.592
She is saying that the author of Dissolving Illusions, Suzanne Humphreys, pointed out that Dr. Jack Cruz and Mary Talley Bowden were on a podcast where they discussed her brother.

37:10.973 --> 37:12.194
And they laid it all out.

37:15.076 --> 37:20.761
You know, the podcast that we did on Friday, Something About Mary, that exact podcast was promoted by

37:24.798 --> 37:28.679
Suzanne Humphries, you know the one that's in the video with Brandy Vaughn?

37:29.399 --> 37:42.643
The one that had a book in 2013 and then hasn't really done anything with her co-author except for over and over again tweet the chart and say something like, why do we need vaccines when they went away before vaccines?

37:43.663 --> 37:47.024
And they just leave it at that for 10 or 12 years.

37:47.084 --> 37:48.265
They just left it at that.

37:49.124 --> 37:57.226
They were never able to say that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a healthy human is not medicine.

37:57.266 --> 37:58.026
They couldn't say it.

37:59.227 --> 38:00.367
They still don't say it.

38:00.927 --> 38:07.729
And yet now they're being promoted by Kim Iverson as part of this group of people on one side of this division in Maha.

38:08.109 --> 38:17.672
And so the relevant voices so far are Nicole Shanahan, Suzanne Humphries, Mary Talley Bowden, and Jack Krause.

38:19.488 --> 38:26.696
We need to get this video and the video previous to this one to Mary Talley Bowden so that she understands the trap that she's in.

38:26.716 --> 38:40.150
And we cannot expect Kim to get out of this trap when her job is to be open and listening to every person that she's paid to interview.

38:47.503 --> 38:55.286
to show you that podcast clip that Dr. Suzanne Humphries is talking about, because it gives us an understanding of why people are so against Casey Means.

38:55.726 --> 38:57.127
She says, let's see how this all pans out.

38:57.167 --> 39:08.212
I can't help but then think this is a very carefully groomed and selected person, just about no clinical experience, talks a great game about everything, but feels all wrong.

39:08.292 --> 39:08.632
Why?

39:08.652 --> 39:14.334
There were so many- It's so fake that she's muting out vaccines.

39:14.474 --> 39:15.995
Like it's just so fake.

39:18.141 --> 39:19.922
But it's nice because what does that mean?

39:20.462 --> 39:22.784
It means that vaccines are a taboo subject.

39:22.804 --> 39:24.605
That means vaccines must be real.

39:24.665 --> 39:33.091
The assumption of this whole thing is that vaccines is a protected topic, worth protecting with lots of science behind it.

39:33.131 --> 39:39.675
The other side is very, it's all about creating this myth and vaccines are a myth.

39:40.876 --> 39:44.939
They are a myth that hide the fact that intramuscular injection is not medicine.

39:45.865 --> 39:50.026
They are a myth that is hidden by autism.

39:52.346 --> 39:57.247
Autism is a myth that hides that intramuscular injection is not medicine.

39:58.647 --> 40:12.530
It's a nasty hamster wheel that people like Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Brian Hooker have actively engaged in trapping hundreds, if not thousands of autistic parents in.

40:14.209 --> 40:16.790
pretending that they were gonna soon make progress.

40:17.450 --> 40:20.971
And ultimately, it may not be Brian's fault or Merrill's fault.

40:21.011 --> 40:34.094
They may have believed in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may have believed in Mary Holland, or may have believed in Aaron Seery or Hordell Bigtree, but the bottom line is, is that their track record belies sabotage.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.315
It belies traitorous sabotage.

40:40.475 --> 40:49.122
And it means that thousands of children every year were injured when they could have been saved from this methodology a decade ago.

40:50.583 --> 41:01.511
Polly Tommy, Andrew Wakefield, all part of the same fake health freedom movement that has grown into what they now call Maha.

41:01.971 --> 41:09.117
And all it is is a way to get as many cats as possible to run in circles and vote when they're told.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.590
It's nothing more, and they're selling supplements to those cats.

41:14.631 --> 41:21.476
And they're wasting the cat's time on podcast after podcast after podcast where no one will ever tell them.

41:26.072 --> 41:27.013
any better choices.

41:27.353 --> 41:28.995
And Nicole is responding to that.

41:29.395 --> 41:30.276
And this is what she says.

41:30.376 --> 41:31.697
Yes, it's very strange.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.758
Doesn't make any sense.

41:33.219 --> 41:36.081
I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr.

41:36.141 --> 41:43.948
in a Senate confirmation, that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment that people much more qualified would be.

41:44.429 --> 41:48.593
I don't know if RFK very clearly lied to me or what's going on.

41:49.713 --> 41:58.260
It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly who is controlling his decisions, and it isn't President Trump.

41:58.600 --> 42:07.087
With regards to the siblings, there is something very artificial and aggressive about them, almost like they were bred and raised Manchurian assets.

42:07.327 --> 42:09.609
Wow, Nicole has come out swinging.

42:09.929 --> 42:13.112
She even calls out Bobby, says he's not taking orders from Trump.

42:13.132 --> 42:17.095
He's taking orders from someone else and we don't know who it is, but she doesn't like it.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.476
And so what is it?

42:18.556 --> 42:23.019
Could it be Robert Malone or Kevin McKernan?

42:24.420 --> 42:27.883
And maybe it's Gavin DeBecker.

42:29.867 --> 42:32.908
Gavin DeBecker is his best friend who runs his security company.

42:32.928 --> 42:36.950
You know the security company that he had to pay all that debt off with?

42:37.410 --> 42:45.633
After Trump got elected, he was still sending emails around saying that he had campaign debt from all the security that the government wouldn't provide him.

42:45.653 --> 42:50.235
But what he didn't tell you was that his best friend, Gavin DeBecker, is the guy who provided that security.

42:50.295 --> 42:50.715
So what?

42:52.642 --> 42:59.126
This guy with a high level international security company that, you know, provides security for his buddy.

42:59.887 --> 43:02.188
Also, it's like, what, really?

43:02.208 --> 43:08.012
Who is he listening to?

43:08.192 --> 43:08.872
I don't know.

43:09.793 --> 43:18.218
But it's been a Truman show for probably 25 or 30 years now with people whispering in his ear, calling and telling him how smart he is and what his destiny is.

43:18.258 --> 43:22.221
And he's been believing it because what else are you going to do when the state killed your dad and uncle?

43:25.839 --> 43:28.020
It's remarkable where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

43:28.060 --> 43:28.901
America needs help.

43:29.741 --> 43:36.745
We need help waking up to see where we are so that we can come together as Americans and shed this skin.

43:38.516 --> 43:58.363
I don't wanna use their own term here, but our own terms or our own ideas, but we have to, as an American country, we have to shed this skin, this dead skin that we've been wearing for the last two decades, ever since we decided that we didn't understand biology anymore and it didn't matter.

43:59.508 --> 44:03.352
it about Dr. Kali means that people don't like.

44:03.372 --> 44:06.475
Here's some other criticisms of her inside of the Maha movement.

44:06.515 --> 44:20.929
Here's Dr. Henry Ely saying, if you want a woman that believes in 24 hour metabolic surveillance by AI, and who has no tangible clinical experience, and whose family has ties to the Rockefellers, and who was as silent as a church mouse in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.

44:24.272 --> 44:32.458
Now that's an interesting critique because in 2020, in 2021, in 2022, there were a lot of people who were silent as a church mouse.

44:37.521 --> 44:47.428
More importantly, in 2020 and 2021, there were people that were so dead on balls narrative, so certain that they knew what was happening that in retrospect, it's kind of odd.

44:49.693 --> 45:02.003
especially since they've made no progress since 2020 when they were sure the spike protein was amyloidogenic, pre-onogenic, you know, all this stuff with the fear and cleavage site and then the inserts and the yada, yada, yada.

45:03.644 --> 45:06.186
Those people haven't learned anything.

45:06.206 --> 45:07.747
They haven't progressed at all.

45:07.787 --> 45:14.353
They haven't started to understand the big picture at all because they're exactly on script.

45:15.097 --> 45:22.403
And so it's a very funny statement for her to read, a very funny statement for her to highlight, because it doesn't turn the camera on herself.

45:22.623 --> 45:23.904
What was she doing in 2020?

45:25.225 --> 45:27.147
Did she have any principles in 2021?

45:28.528 --> 45:30.950
Or was she just reporting what she was told to report?

45:34.873 --> 45:37.055
Because when I was told to shut up,

45:38.618 --> 45:40.518
I got fired because I didn't shut up.

45:41.019 --> 45:42.659
And that was from a US med school.

45:42.979 --> 45:50.961
And then when I was told to shut up by Mary Holland and Brian Hooker about talking about Robert Malone, I didn't shut up and then they fired me.

45:52.461 --> 46:01.263
It's funny because then in 2024, Jay Bhattacharya told me that he was maybe gonna get NIH director and that I should stop talking about Robert Malone.

46:02.424 --> 46:05.164
And I didn't, but he got NIH director.

46:05.224 --> 46:07.325
So something was right.

46:08.752 --> 46:09.493
And here we are.

46:11.736 --> 46:12.717
And so I am nuts.

46:12.957 --> 46:13.658
I know I'm nuts.

46:13.758 --> 46:15.961
I see all kinds of stuff in this that isn't real.

46:27.092 --> 46:37.998
organization that's funded by Bill Gates, Biden, Clinton, and WHO, or WHO, I don't know if he means who, or then this is a MAGA, MAHA pick from heaven.

46:38.078 --> 46:47.223
So he's making fun of this, saying this is not a good pick, that she's got all these crazy ties to all kinds of globalist sorts of agendas.

46:48.284 --> 46:52.707
Another criticism inside the MAHA movement, Dr. Mary Talley Bowen, she says,

46:55.113 --> 46:58.275
Secretary Kennedy was used to win an election.

46:58.735 --> 47:04.218
Last week, RFK told Dr. Kelly Victory she was the new pick for Surgeon General.

47:04.658 --> 47:12.021
I was with her last weekend and she told me and others Kelly was passed over because of her outspoken stance against the mRNA shots.

47:12.401 --> 47:15.083
Clearly, RFK has no power.

47:15.743 --> 47:18.084
is what Mary Talley Bowen is saying.

47:18.244 --> 47:24.905
Funny that she's there with Kelly Victory, who I also know has worked for a long time with Dr. Drew.

47:25.445 --> 47:31.727
I was actually on a private stream with Kelly Victory in 2022, also with a guy by the name of Harvey Reich.

47:32.247 --> 47:36.488
We had a very, very fiery argument about things in 2022.

47:39.389 --> 47:47.015
And unfortunately that was a private discussion, but it was remarkable the kinds of things that they would just ignore as I presented them.

47:48.977 --> 47:53.640
Anyway, again, Mary doesn't need to be a witting participant.

47:53.680 --> 47:59.325
She just has to be surrounded by people who are witting participants, and she'll never see through it, just like I didn't see through it.

48:01.145 --> 48:02.366
Allison, I got your letter.

48:02.386 --> 48:04.328
I won't say anymore.

48:04.868 --> 48:06.129
You have very nice handwriting.

48:07.170 --> 48:07.990
Thank you very much.

48:08.951 --> 48:11.653
And I will send a sticker for your laptop.

48:11.713 --> 48:16.056
I have plenty left, so that should be no problem.

48:17.097 --> 48:17.797
Thank you very much.

48:17.877 --> 48:18.738
I'm going to keep this going.

48:19.882 --> 48:23.305
And here's another criticism coming from the Maha movement.

48:23.705 --> 48:25.447
So you could just see this war that's going on.

48:25.807 --> 48:30.492
Dr. Colleen Huber says, I was picked to be an HHS advisor back in December.

48:30.952 --> 48:33.995
Others were promised even higher positions.

48:34.255 --> 48:38.339
We all had told the truth about and during COVID.

48:38.639 --> 48:41.662
We told the truth about both childhood and COVID.

48:42.643 --> 48:44.824
We've all been sidelined at this point.

48:45.344 --> 48:47.466
And Dr. Henry Ely responded.

48:47.566 --> 48:52.548
What is the truth about vaccines, both childhood and COVID vaccines?

48:52.628 --> 48:55.590
What is the truth that that is across both of them?

48:55.610 --> 48:57.591
Because I don't think they're saying it.

48:58.912 --> 49:01.793
What would be that truth that they also hurt people?

49:02.193 --> 49:03.474
They're not totally great.

49:03.874 --> 49:04.735
Well, they work.

49:04.895 --> 49:07.616
But what would the truth really be?

49:07.696 --> 49:08.196
Do you see it?

49:11.758 --> 49:13.039
It's just one big show.

49:13.239 --> 49:13.879
It's crazy.

49:14.419 --> 49:20.261
That also saying I was picked to got the call the day after the election ghosted not too long after 100% true.

49:20.722 --> 49:26.644
So a lot of people inside the Maha movement have been calling paying attention and specifically to the to mRNAs.

49:26.944 --> 49:33.287
They're all feeling sidelined and they're feeling like this, this particular pick of Dr. Casey means

49:34.574 --> 49:51.491
Not to be confused with, she's got a brother, so there's the two Means siblings, and this is who Nicole Shanahan was talking about, is that there's Dr. Casey Means, who's now the Surgeon General pick, and her brother, Dr. Callie Means, and they often appear together on podcasts.

49:51.511 --> 49:53.693
They're often, they're like thing one and thing two.

49:53.733 --> 49:58.638
They're often shown as a pair, but she's the one who ended up getting the nomination.

49:59.870 --> 50:03.873
So what is it about them that people don't like?

50:03.933 --> 50:07.215
Not everybody in the ma movement is feeling this way though.

50:07.235 --> 50:09.896
There's actually a lot of support for Dr. Casey Means.

50:09.936 --> 50:14.419
In fact, Nicole Shanahan, this has been pointed out that she even once supported them.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.582
She even said, this is back in September of 2024.

50:19.783 --> 50:22.965
So not that long ago, six months ago or so, six, seven, eight months ago.

50:24.113 --> 50:30.575
She says, Callie and Dr. Casey means siblings on a mission to end corruption and help make America healthy again.

50:31.035 --> 50:35.636
So Nicole Shanahan at one point liked them and even touted them as part of the Maha movement.

50:35.916 --> 50:47.299
And this is in response to Callie means the brother saying, remember, it's kind of confusing because Callie is kind of traditionally a female name and Casey is more male, I suppose, but actually Casey's the females.

50:47.679 --> 50:50.440
Think about how much time she's already wasted.

50:51.821 --> 50:53.001
And what have we learned?

50:53.948 --> 50:56.651
What is the main crux of the issue?

50:57.752 --> 50:58.533
Who she is?

50:59.514 --> 51:00.675
What is the job?

51:01.316 --> 51:02.417
What the job does?

51:03.218 --> 51:04.440
Is the job irrelevant?

51:04.460 --> 51:07.263
Well apparently none of these things are important.

51:07.283 --> 51:13.449
We just have to understand all these irrelevant details and we also have to digest these irrelevant people.

51:14.252 --> 51:15.112
It's remarkable.

51:15.712 --> 51:17.353
Sibling and Callie's the male sibling.

51:17.373 --> 51:19.133
So just kind of keep that straight in your heads.

51:19.533 --> 51:24.514
So Dr. Callie means says, remember the Tufts food compass that said lucky charms are healthier than beef.

51:24.914 --> 51:32.536
This, the studies author is now being paid directly by Ozempic prescribers and educating Congress that injection for kids are the road to know.

51:32.576 --> 51:39.717
So he goes on and has this tweet and she's, she's, um, saying, yeah, you know, this is the, the, the means siblings are out there on a mission.

51:40.177 --> 51:42.378
to end corruption and help make America healthy again.

51:42.438 --> 51:43.798
So what changed, Nicole?

51:44.318 --> 51:44.918
What changed?

51:45.338 --> 51:47.399
Why are you now so viscerally against them?

51:47.459 --> 51:51.880
Why are you calling them Manchurian candidates when at one point you liked them for the Maha movement?

51:52.320 --> 51:58.101
We're going to get into exactly what it is that Nicole and others are paying attention to.

51:58.141 --> 51:59.021
And it's a nuance.

51:59.381 --> 52:02.242
It's not as prominent as you might think.

52:04.108 --> 52:05.409
Here's Dr. Robert Malone.

52:05.869 --> 52:08.211
He is supporting Dr. Casey Means.

52:08.271 --> 52:09.432
He's saying, who is Casey?

52:09.632 --> 52:17.758
Okay, now, of course, you see putting Robert Malone out in the forefront as a prominent thought leader in the Maha movement.

52:17.798 --> 52:19.600
And again, this is a direct admission.

52:21.008 --> 52:26.591
even an indirect tie to Robert Malone is a direct admission that you are part of this team.

52:26.671 --> 52:41.300
Just like, I mean, Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone are two central players in the biological illusion of the pandemic and making sure that all these other monkeys on the internet are staying to the script.

52:42.120 --> 52:46.863
And they are for sure the writers of most of this script.

52:47.964 --> 52:54.231
I would bet my entire, I am betting my family's future on that fact because I'm so sure it's true.

52:56.601 --> 53:00.764
means extreme elements in the Maha base have a freak out moment.

53:00.924 --> 53:10.711
Let's say that Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone are as close to me coming to identify the people who are responsible for this narrative.

53:11.152 --> 53:19.738
If you said that you have to be wrong because there are lots of people with much more power behind them that we'll never see, of course, fine with me, that's fine.

53:19.778 --> 53:25.142
But what I'm talking about is the shuffleboard of monkeys on the stage that we've been,

53:25.842 --> 53:32.524
forced to pay attention to, that she's been forced to pay attention to, that we've all been forced to pay attention to.

53:32.624 --> 53:32.904
Why?

53:33.364 --> 53:36.825
Because we choose to use social media to find our information.

53:38.626 --> 53:48.928
And so if we just go there willy-nilly and wait for what the algorithm or what the programming gives us on YouTube or on Rumble or whatever, then we're always going to get a La Familia ad.

53:48.948 --> 53:50.429
We're always going to get a nonsense

53:51.258 --> 54:08.713
show you're never going to get gig on biological or housatonic live or joe marshall and the liberty perspective it's just not going to happen read the essay here he also tweeted the only reason why the pandemic was possible is because of social media prove me wrong

54:09.517 --> 54:24.928
out earlier yesterday or today saying that, you know, he, do you remember that campaign where they're like all of these social media accounts suddenly came out at the same time and they were all promoting like Coca-Cola or something.

54:24.968 --> 54:28.911
They all kind of seemed to have the same sort of message suddenly.

54:29.051 --> 54:36.076
And then it turned out there was a right wing paid op, you know, where they were paying a thousand dollars to all of these social media influencers.

54:36.997 --> 54:37.977
People are supposed to be independent.

54:37.997 --> 54:39.038
People are supposed to be telling the truth.

54:39.358 --> 54:41.959
And so they were all taking a bunch of money and they're all... Bebe!

54:44.320 --> 54:44.800
I got it.

54:45.620 --> 54:47.381
Uh, thanks for the, for the package.

54:48.121 --> 54:49.281
All posting the exact same post.

54:49.641 --> 54:57.464
So Robert Malone was actually accusing all of the Maha people who've been calling out Dr. Kasey Means, saying they don't like her.

54:57.784 --> 55:00.245
He was saying he wonders if that's another op like that.

55:00.305 --> 55:04.687
Like Big Pharma is, or somebody is behind

55:06.242 --> 55:15.627
trying to get rid of Dr. Casey Means as Surgeon General, and paying all of these Maha influencers, essentially, to just tout against her.

55:15.927 --> 55:18.548
That's one of his tweets that he was insinuating.

55:19.048 --> 55:25.051
And then he follows up with this essay that he wrote on who is Dr. Casey Means.

55:27.281 --> 55:28.622
Who is Dr. Casey Means?

55:28.662 --> 55:32.306
Let's read some of his article so that we kind of have a background information about it.

55:32.326 --> 55:34.648
Because some people are saying, well, she's not qualified.

55:35.589 --> 55:48.281
For one, not only is she not really Maha, she's like a Manchurian candidate or a plant to... The biggest criticism is that those in the Maha movement believe Dr. Casey Means is someone who is meant to divert attention.

55:49.042 --> 55:58.373
make you think they're in the movement, make you think that they're on your side, but in reality they're diverting attention away from the main goal and instead towards something else.

55:58.393 --> 56:00.315
And I'll show you exactly what they mean by that.

56:02.156 --> 56:06.398
Others are pointing out, and on top of that, this diversion tactic.

56:06.758 --> 56:12.962
On top of that, she dropped out of residency, so she's not a practicing physician.

56:13.402 --> 56:16.443
She's never been a surgeon, never been a practicing doctor.

56:17.204 --> 56:30.971
She doesn't have any clinical experience whatsoever, and usually the US Surgeon General is somebody who's actually been a practicing physician or surgeon for a long time, and Dr. Casey Means has never been that because she dropped out of residency, so she became more on the research side of things.

56:32.694 --> 56:39.297
So Robert Malone, Dr. Robert Malone, who's coming out defending her, says, I've been saddened today by all the attacks on Casey Means.

56:39.737 --> 56:46.560
Part of that, I suppose, is that the very same people who should be glad to support her nomination for Surgeon General instead have focused on attacking her.

56:46.960 --> 56:52.923
Some of those attacks are clearly aimed at taking down MAHA, MAGA, Secretary Kennedy, and President Donald Trump.

56:54.246 --> 57:01.209
Dr. Means did not just burst into the public sphere like some sort of meteor with the publication of her book, Good Energy in 2024.

57:01.989 --> 57:06.111
So she wrote a book about good energy where it really is the premise of the book.

57:06.451 --> 57:20.417
The whole book is really about how our systems are, I'm just kind of summarizing and I think this is accurate, but the basics is that it's about how we're being poisoned by all of these various elements around us from food to just

57:22.638 --> 57:24.099
you know, maybe cell phones.

57:24.159 --> 57:31.105
I mean, I'm not... I'm just kind of rattling stuff off, so I could be totally wrong on what they cite in the book or in her brother's cite in that book, Good Energy.

57:31.605 --> 57:35.508
But, well, maybe we should just look it up real quick so that we can know.

57:35.628 --> 57:39.031
Let's just see what it says on... I mean, really, can you not see it?

57:40.032 --> 57:46.717
How much time we've wasted, how much progress she doesn't make, because every... everyone has to be different.

57:47.677 --> 57:48.178
Oh, nice.

57:48.238 --> 57:50.500
Somebody just sent me a learn the risk thing.

57:51.060 --> 57:52.001
Oh, that's awesome.

57:53.348 --> 57:54.048
So cool.

57:54.128 --> 57:55.169
Thank you very, very much.

57:55.289 --> 57:56.589
I did not have it, Arno.

57:56.910 --> 57:58.150
I appreciate it very much.

57:59.010 --> 58:09.895
BB, Arno, Brian, and Allison today out of the PO box.

58:09.935 --> 58:11.316
Thank you guys very, very much.

58:12.996 --> 58:14.477
I got to rearrange that somehow.

58:14.537 --> 58:15.257
That's really nice.

58:15.297 --> 58:15.557
Thanks.

58:16.778 --> 58:19.399
How's the review on Amazon real quick?

58:21.035 --> 58:22.496
She's reading the Amazon review.

58:22.536 --> 58:24.018
Oops, I had to check that for a second.

58:32.796 --> 58:33.436
limitless health.

58:34.037 --> 58:49.964
What if depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, type two diabetes, Alzheimer's, dementia, cancer, and many other health conditions that torture and shorten our lives actually have the same root cause our ability to prevent and reverse these conditions and feel incredible today is under our control and simpler than we think.

58:50.384 --> 58:52.065
The key is our metabolic function.

58:52.205 --> 58:54.426
Now keep in mind this is on YouTube.

58:54.526 --> 59:00.769
My video with her is not on YouTube in any form, not even in a short form where she deletes all the words.

59:04.079 --> 59:04.880
Just remember that.

59:05.120 --> 59:06.862
It got on Rumble, but who cares?

59:06.963 --> 59:08.484
Rumble is the trap.

59:08.745 --> 59:17.675
I mean, if you went to Rumble to see me, then you already used the media that they want you to use, that they're trying to divide people on and become relevant from YouTube.

59:17.715 --> 59:19.638
There's a little struggle there going on, sure.

59:21.288 --> 59:25.892
but it's all people struggling at the table where the food is available.

59:26.272 --> 59:28.493
It's just a question of who grabbed the drumstick first.

59:28.994 --> 59:32.376
This is absolutely where we are right now.

59:32.957 --> 59:35.659
This is what the hamster wheel looks like on the internet.

59:35.719 --> 59:38.861
And you can go on the left and you can see them talking about her too.

59:40.062 --> 59:41.724
They might not mention Robert Malone.

59:41.884 --> 59:46.687
They might mention Paul Offit or they might mention, it's remarkable.

59:48.049 --> 59:52.490
how easy it is to see right now and how easy it is to show it to your kids.

59:52.930 --> 59:56.071
Chen, the most important and least understood factor in our overall health.

59:56.231 --> 01:00:05.174
As Dr. Casey Means explains in this groundbreaking book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy.

01:00:05.534 --> 01:00:15.797
To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create good energy, the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our physical and mental wellbeing.

01:00:16.448 --> 01:00:22.272
Yeah, she used to have gummies that were called Mitochews or something like that to make your mitochondria healthier.

01:00:22.312 --> 01:00:25.434
You could take gummies to make your mitochondria healthier.

01:00:25.494 --> 01:00:28.937
She sold gummies to make your mitochondria healthier.

01:00:30.187 --> 01:00:40.690
And so goes into saying that there's like diet and sleep and chemicals, and there's all of these things that are screwing up with our metabolic health.

01:00:41.211 --> 01:00:49.293
So it's important you know this and understand this aspect of it, because this all plays into why people are upset about this particular pic.

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.774
Now you might think when you hear that, well, yeah.

01:00:51.854 --> 01:00:54.775
It is there for the whole video, which is remarkable.

01:00:54.935 --> 01:00:55.975
I mean, that's remarkable.

01:00:56.115 --> 01:00:56.635
Sounds good.

01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:58.257
I like her talking about that.

01:00:58.457 --> 01:00:58.857
It's true.

01:00:58.917 --> 01:00:59.818
The food is poisoning us.

01:00:59.938 --> 01:01:00.298
It's true.

01:01:00.318 --> 01:01:04.362
We're probably being poisoned by all of this high-tech stuff that we're inundating ourselves with all the time.

01:01:04.702 --> 01:01:12.168
It's true that probably a lot of screen time and not getting proper light, you know, and screwing up with our circadian rhythms, it's probably all screwing with our metabolic health, right?

01:01:12.188 --> 01:01:14.310
You might feel like, what's the problem here?

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:15.451
Why is this an issue?

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:16.431
Sounds good to me.

01:01:16.832 --> 01:01:18.313
I like all of these things that she's saying.

01:01:18.513 --> 01:01:19.354
I agree, right?

01:01:19.494 --> 01:01:19.714
Okay.

01:01:22.203 --> 01:01:23.283
I'm not saying that.

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:26.424
But again, that's not her message.

01:01:26.464 --> 01:01:28.185
Her message is you might be saying that.

01:01:29.165 --> 01:01:30.486
It makes sense to say that.

01:01:31.326 --> 01:01:32.566
And that's the enchantment.

01:01:32.906 --> 01:01:37.988
She might not know that she is enchanting you, but her script writers definitely know.

01:01:40.967 --> 01:01:50.175
He goes on to say in his article that he writes in defense of Dr. Casey Means, says that Dr. Casey Means has long been a spokesperson in the metabolic health community.

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:54.038
I was told that the 5K event was very rainy.

01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:59.263
They couldn't put out the posters, but there were people there and it was loud music.

01:02:02.455 --> 01:02:03.016
Yeah, I don't know.

01:02:03.076 --> 01:02:05.699
I don't think that it was optimal.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.346
But I think every time those people get together, I think it's probably a worthwhile event.

01:02:11.406 --> 01:02:12.807
It's probably very exhausting.

01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:14.289
I can't imagine.

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:16.692
I think he did a show on it, though, Jeff.

01:02:16.886 --> 01:02:18.687
which is one element of the Maha movement.

01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:31.611
She has long been on the Editorial Advisory Board of the International Journal of Disease Reversal and Prevention, as noted at the end of her 2020 article in The Hill titled, Healthy Food, the Unexpected Medicine for COVID-19 and National Security.

01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:37.312
And in that 2020 article, she wrote, from the perspective of science and national security, the correct strategy is clear.

01:02:37.472 --> 01:02:42.034
All Americans need to eat healthier foods, lose weight, and get into good physical shape.

01:02:42.674 --> 01:02:43.935
All of this supports immunity.

01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:45.456
It's well established.

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:57.727
I mean, can you imagine a scenario where a national security state that understood the DNA vaccines were the only way that they could really get anything to work?

01:02:59.087 --> 01:03:01.408
but they also knew that they had to be personalized.

01:03:02.088 --> 01:03:14.612
They also knew that they had to be made in extremely small batches because you can't make large quantities of DNA purely, and certainly not remove all the toxins that are there when you use recombinant DNA to do it.

01:03:16.073 --> 01:03:25.556
Imagine that they saw this problem coming, saw the fact that the FDA would be in the way, knew that they had to create a national security priority over several decades,

01:03:26.681 --> 01:03:50.346
that would prioritize injected medicine because in the end, they needed the American public or the American military to accept injected medicine as a standard so that in perpetuity, they could be used as laboratory animals in the exploration of how to take over and sculpt the evolution of the human species.

01:03:52.571 --> 01:03:57.134
And so these people have been putting people in place to make sure that you never see that happening.

01:03:57.194 --> 01:03:59.235
Instead, you're worried about Fitbit data.

01:04:01.717 --> 01:04:07.180
Instead, you're worried about whether or not they're tracking you or not, or whether it's 5G and the Wi-Fi.

01:04:09.101 --> 01:04:11.062
When in reality, it is access.

01:04:12.823 --> 01:04:16.906
It is experimental access and it is full access.

01:04:18.544 --> 01:04:22.587
They can swab you and they can inject you and they can insist on doing it.

01:04:22.647 --> 01:04:23.868
That's where this goes.

01:04:26.189 --> 01:04:28.511
Because then of course they can insist on implanting it.

01:04:30.532 --> 01:04:43.802
And pandemics and autism and gain of function and even nuclear weapons are all mythologies that make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned, that the biosecurity threat of gain of function is never questioned.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:50.653
and that public health is never questioned as a reason or as an answer.

01:04:53.975 --> 01:04:57.999
And so this whole debate about Casey means never approaches

01:04:58.931 --> 01:05:10.953
a useful question about why should public health ever be the answer, about what is real about virology, or what could be usefully intramuscularly injected and called medicine.

01:05:11.473 --> 01:05:20.535
None of those questions will ever be asked by any of these people, but they will engage in a very vigorous performance for the next four years, for sure.

01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:25.956
Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure are largely preventable with healthy diet and lifestyle.

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:26.356
Okay.

01:05:27.338 --> 01:05:30.339
So he cites more of the article, but I don't wanna read the whole thing.

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:37.241
I want you to get the gist of what she's about so that you could understand why the Maha movement is at civil war with her now.

01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:41.942
You see what she's saying, talking about healthy food, right?

01:05:42.002 --> 01:05:43.562
Talking about metabolic health.

01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:44.543
That's what the book is about.

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:45.603
That's what her article's about.

01:05:46.223 --> 01:05:53.745
Robert Malone goes on to say, over five years ago, she was writing about ultra processed foods in a national newspaper at a time when most Americans had never even heard of the word.

01:05:54.145 --> 01:05:56.206
That shows a long commitment to this cause.

01:05:59.428 --> 01:06:00.489
Five years ago?

01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:02.910
You know what a long commitment to this cause is?

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:17.280
A really long commitment to this cause is over 20 years ago or 15 years ago being on billboards in a bra trying to sway 6 million votes to a certain prime minister in the UK using the claim of autism.

01:06:21.141 --> 01:06:22.602
Now that's some serious commitment.

01:06:22.802 --> 01:06:27.645
Five years ago, she was writing about processed foods when most Americans had never heard of it.

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:32.768
And that's Robert Malone's very relevant opinion, says Kim Iverson?

01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:45.215
All you need to understand is that if your family and friends are not Trump voters, they have no idea that this is going on.

01:06:46.812 --> 01:06:56.917
If your family and friends are not Trump voters, they have no idea that these debates and these people and these ideas are being discussed.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:58.018
None whatsoever.

01:06:59.759 --> 01:07:07.243
You're completely alone in this little bubble where Robert Malone matters to Kim Iverson and Nicole Shanahan matters to Glenn Beck.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:16.975
and where Robert Malone and Alex Jones and Brett Weinstein and all of these people are all the same.

01:07:17.995 --> 01:07:35.004
One malevolent team that has taken over a patriotic movement, a Christian right, a populist right, whatever it is, and put it all together into one big mix of cats running around in circles

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:49.931
And standing at the border of this circle of cats are all these people screaming and yelling and making funny noises and shaking little, little fake tails around and, and with laser pointers.

01:07:52.273 --> 01:07:53.674
And so these cats are screwed.

01:07:54.395 --> 01:07:57.778
Like no matter which way they run, there's cats and then there's these people.

01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:02.622
And some of them like him, maybe they don't know.

01:08:02.742 --> 01:08:05.202
They're just paid to wave the laser pointer around.

01:08:05.222 --> 01:08:06.443
Yeah, the cats really like it.

01:08:06.503 --> 01:08:07.103
Isn't it cool?

01:08:13.124 --> 01:08:18.446
To Dr. Mark Hyman's work on preventing chronic disease through diet while finishing up her residency.

01:08:18.506 --> 01:08:22.307
During that time, her mother was in the process of dying from cancer due to metabolic dysfunction.

01:08:22.327 --> 01:08:26.728
Okay, so lots to do with metabolic dysfunction, lots to do with food.

01:08:27.998 --> 01:08:29.839
Maybe you're getting the point at this point.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:31.599
Maybe you're understanding why they're so mad about it.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:44.465
So he goes on and he says this in his, now the naysayers in the health freedom movement and many influencers like to single out her family's progressive stances as a reason to disqualify her.

01:08:46.085 --> 01:08:47.606
Her father, let me just show you this.

01:08:47.826 --> 01:08:50.427
Laura Loomer pointed out the progressive stance.

01:08:50.607 --> 01:08:57.450
Her dad is also a- Laura Loomer is somebody who was on thumbnails with Soap before the pandemic.

01:08:58.544 --> 01:09:13.735
Soph is the internet phenomenon daughter of Sasha Latapova, also on team Robert Malone, and on team Mary Holland, and on team CHD, and on team Epoch Times.

01:09:16.097 --> 01:09:22.622
She actually had the same little underscored, you know, whatever two thirds thing,

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.571
that Steve Bannon just had, American Thought Leaders.

01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:30.893
Steve Bannon has that, and so does Sasha Latupova.

01:09:30.973 --> 01:09:38.515
And her daughter, Soph, was a real internet phenomenon before the pandemic, on Alex Jones three times.

01:09:40.996 --> 01:09:49.739
And now promoting Laura Loomer is essentially promoting a colleague of Soph, somebody who was in the same media circles, doing the same shtick.

01:09:50.677 --> 01:09:53.698
for the same people, like getting paid to do it, right?

01:09:53.778 --> 01:09:57.120
Because even back then, people were being put in place.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.360
They were testing models out, see who would catch.

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:07.904
Milo, whatever his name is, was also in that same group of people at the beginning of the pandemic and just before.

01:10:09.865 --> 01:10:11.565
Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:12.326
Think about it.

01:10:12.366 --> 01:10:13.206
You can see it.

01:10:16.407 --> 01:10:19.328
Stefan Molyneux was also in that group of people.

01:10:19.369 --> 01:10:20.329
Can you see it yet?

01:10:24.048 --> 01:10:36.191
a doctor, and Laura Loomer wrote this tweet out and called attention to the fact that her dad had written a book that seemed to be trans-friendly.

01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:50.874
So Laura says, do you and Casey means, her brother, do you and Casey means condemn your father, so I guess she's writing to Cali means, do you and Casey condemn your father for writing a book encouraging children to be transgender?

01:10:51.394 --> 01:10:56.535
I don't want a surgeon general that isn't capable of condemning their own family member for pushing child mutilation.

01:10:56.555 --> 01:10:58.115
Do you and your sister condemn your father?

01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.156
And this is the, she cites this.

01:11:00.316 --> 01:11:02.996
That's not a legitimate way for this to go.

01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:18.099
And this is on X. So one of the other things that you see and should see here is that repeatedly in this broadcast, she is pulling her information directly from X. These posts are relevant.

01:11:19.653 --> 01:11:21.494
This platform is relevant.

01:11:22.414 --> 01:11:33.357
This platform can be used to glean useful information about our world and engage in a useful political debate because that is one of the assumptions of this program.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:44.241
The truth is being given away, is being debated, is being discussed and developed on X according to Kim Iverson.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.361
Also a Rumble supported person, right?

01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:52.423
Rumble and X are kind of related by Musk and Teal, right?

01:11:52.463 --> 01:11:56.864
So it's a strange thing if you can see it.

01:11:58.245 --> 01:12:01.886
It's almost like they went to Trump and they said, you know, we can offer our services.

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:05.027
We have some services we can offer you.

01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:10.069
And we can demonstrate that we can control the narrative.

01:12:10.109 --> 01:12:10.909
Watch how we do it.

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:16.776
So their dad wrote a book called The Adventures of Felix the Flamingo.

01:12:17.236 --> 01:12:20.557
And the book overview says, coming of age is difficult.

01:12:20.617 --> 01:12:23.298
We're still not talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:25.039
We're not talking about Jay Bhattacharya.

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:26.959
We're not talking about Marty McCary.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.241
We're not talking about Marty McCary's appointments.

01:12:31.721 --> 01:12:37.783
We're not talking about who Jay Bhattacharya is appointing or hiring or what he's doing.

01:12:37.803 --> 01:12:39.843
He's probably not doing anything.

01:12:39.883 --> 01:12:41.224
He's probably just on Blaze News.

01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:47.511
We're not talking about what Robert F. Kennedy is doing for Medicaid or Medicare.

01:12:47.531 --> 01:12:49.652
We're not talking about the population pyramid.

01:12:51.813 --> 01:12:53.654
We're not talking about anything relevant.

01:12:55.795 --> 01:12:58.557
And this woman is paid not to talk about anything relevant.

01:12:58.597 --> 01:13:03.979
She's paid to read the script and ask the questions that she is given, and she's probably paid very well.

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:04.800
All this

01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:14.226
All this that you see here requires is a family of five to rent a house in Pittsburgh and make it, which isn't very much.

01:13:15.407 --> 01:13:16.928
So what you see is quite remarkable.

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:25.995
I'm up against a media force field with orders of magnitude more monetary power.

01:13:27.472 --> 01:13:35.497
I have nobody except for my wife doing the emailing and the notifications and whatever we do on Instagram.

01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:35.937
That's it.

01:13:36.898 --> 01:13:39.659
We don't have anything else because this is a one man show.

01:13:41.981 --> 01:13:43.061
One family show.

01:13:44.362 --> 01:13:47.084
How many families do you think her show supports?

01:13:47.704 --> 01:13:51.547
How many families do you think all these fake podcasts on the internet support?

01:13:51.587 --> 01:13:52.447
It ain't just one.

01:13:53.688 --> 01:13:55.029
And they ain't renting their house.

01:13:56.277 --> 01:14:02.801
in the same school district that the supposed would-be shooter of Donald Trump is from.

01:14:02.941 --> 01:14:03.661
No, no, they're not.

01:14:04.081 --> 01:14:05.022
I assure you, they're not.

01:14:06.143 --> 01:14:11.386
I think actually Kim Iverson said the other day that she has two houses, one in Idaho and one somewhere else.

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.806
It's rough, it's rough.

01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:21.491
Life transition for most children, but it can be particularly traumatic and confusing for many kids confused about- We're not talking about Steve Hadfield either, are we?

01:14:21.571 --> 01:14:22.532
Holy man.

01:14:24.093 --> 01:14:29.936
gender, and sexual identities, Felix begins to discover that he's an unusual bird who has lost his way.

01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:31.197
Fortunately, he stumbles across.

01:14:31.297 --> 01:14:36.460
And just to recover again and remember to remind you that what is this transgender debate about?

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.122
The transgender debate is a trap.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:43.464
I'm going to go get my hat so I can show you precisely what I mean, OK?

01:14:43.564 --> 01:14:44.385
I'm going to get it.

01:14:57.398 --> 01:15:02.220
Right now, out there on the internet, there's this, you know, it's not their fault, okay?

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.360
I know what they're fighting for, I get the argument.

01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:11.103
There's this thing out there called XYXX Athletics.

01:15:12.283 --> 01:15:17.545
You probably can't even see that, but... Here, maybe I'll switch quickly over here.

01:15:18.345 --> 01:15:21.706
And then I can use the button.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:21.766
Oh!

01:15:22.007 --> 01:15:23.127
Camera error, hello!

01:15:24.005 --> 01:15:26.352
Look what happens when you goof around.

01:15:26.372 --> 01:15:27.856
I gotta do that over.

01:15:27.876 --> 01:15:29.180
There we go.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.403
That should do it.

01:15:31.005 --> 01:15:31.807
Please work.

01:15:33.519 --> 01:15:33.979
Come on.

01:15:34.879 --> 01:15:35.360
There we go.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:35.840
Okay.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:36.580
Sorry.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.741
Again, I don't have a staff.

01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:41.221
See XXY Athletics, you see that?

01:15:41.682 --> 01:15:46.183
So they sell hats and I thought it was pretty cool because it's like biology and stuff, you know?

01:15:46.923 --> 01:15:55.166
And the mistake that I made, it's not even really a mistake because getting the hat sent to me made me realize it.

01:15:55.206 --> 01:16:01.948
When it got here and I was wearing it and I put it on and I saw myself in the camera and I thought, wait,

01:16:03.137 --> 01:16:07.578
Did I just, did I just accept something?

01:16:08.399 --> 01:16:09.559
And of course I did, right?

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:14.100
What I'm accepting is, is that sex is determined by genes.

01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:27.805
And so you either argue on one side or the other, either sex is determined by genes or it's some kind of, you know, multifactorial process.

01:16:27.825 --> 01:16:29.185
That's a combination of,

01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:40.493
environmental and genetic causes that ultimately leads to a whole spectrum of genders.

01:16:42.573 --> 01:16:47.634
I wonder if you can see the illusion that I'm getting at yet with regard to this whole thing.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:58.757
Because Paul Offit agrees with James Lyons Weiler that autism is real and it is a the result of a complex combination of environmental

01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:00.646
and genetic factors.

01:17:01.306 --> 01:17:13.893
And while you think you're arguing that sex is men and women, what you're actually arguing is soon sex will be a combination of environmental and genetic causes.

01:17:13.953 --> 01:17:19.176
And the only argument will be is what role do the genes play and how important is it?

01:17:20.817 --> 01:17:22.538
Oh my goodness, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:23.354 --> 01:17:29.239
We are breaking free one stream at a time and I'm very happy to be helping you.

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:34.142
Cross the odd and curious Gale Bird who helps him on his personal journey to a great life.

01:17:34.703 --> 01:17:43.449
Felix is a story for all children and many adults to help them along or to help them better appreciate others who may be having a more difficult, secret, often very lonely struggle.

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.212
So this is a children's book aimed at

01:17:46.852 --> 01:17:49.473
trans, the trans movement, the trans issue.

01:17:49.953 --> 01:18:11.722
And so people on the right who are very, very concerned about the trans agenda, the kids going on hormones and being transitioned, are like, wait a minute, why would you then nominate a surgeon general whose own father wrote a book for children, a children's book, helping them transition, helping them become mentally and emotionally fine with themselves and others transitioning?

01:18:11.762 --> 01:18:13.963
Like, what in the world is going on here?

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:22.138
Um, and Kali means, uh, responds to this and says, this is insane.

01:18:22.158 --> 01:18:25.543
Uh, sorry, this is not the right tweet.

01:18:25.704 --> 01:18:26.725
Uh, this is the.

01:18:28.628 --> 01:18:30.891
This is him actually defending his sister right here.

01:18:30.911 --> 01:18:32.993
He's saying she's a Stanford educated physician.

01:18:33.073 --> 01:18:51.971
She completed five years of residency She left the system to speak out She wrote a book about this that sold one and a half million copies to inspire others to leave the medical system and reform it She's the single best person in the world on connecting the dots behind our chronic disease crisis and a reason for existence is to help president reverse these trends she worked to encourage RFK to support Trump and

01:18:52.051 --> 01:18:56.294
And we went on Joe Rogan with the specific intention to convince undecided Maha voters to support Trump.

01:18:56.574 --> 01:19:00.257
So there he is kind of giving a breakdown as to why his sister is the right pick for the Surgeon General.

01:19:00.557 --> 01:19:04.900
But he also responded to Laura Loomer and her post about the book.

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:21.771
So again, we're still drilling it into everybody that these conversations are only available on X. So if you really want to know what's going on in the town square, you're going to have to go to X, according to Kim Iverson, because she can produce a whole news program just from the shit that she reads there.

01:19:23.432 --> 01:19:28.215
And what she doesn't even realize is that none of these posts need to be from these people.

01:19:30.217 --> 01:19:39.303
I'm not saying they're not from those people, I'm just saying that at some point she needs to realize that a lot of that platform doesn't need to be real.

01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:45.848
More importantly, what she sees on that platform does not need to be what anyone else sees.

01:19:46.994 --> 01:19:51.860
And that means it's not fair, it's not safe, it's not reliable.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:20:02.954
It's a military software suite designed to control people and to herd cats into as many different groups as possible and get them to behave exactly as predicted.

01:20:05.049 --> 01:20:05.990
saying, do you condemn this?

01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:07.231
And he said, this is insane.

01:20:07.571 --> 01:20:12.715
This is a book my dad wrote eight years ago when a gay family friend was suicidal, has nothing to do with trans.

01:20:13.056 --> 01:20:15.638
The assault on womanhood trans agenda with kids is demonic.

01:20:15.718 --> 01:20:16.178
It's evil.

01:20:16.558 --> 01:20:20.502
Casey and I have discussed these issues at length and the historic importance of Trump addressing it.

01:20:20.842 --> 01:20:22.163
Casey is so passionate about it.

01:20:22.203 --> 01:20:24.125
She's writing a book on the topic of womanhood.

01:20:24.545 --> 01:20:26.707
So he's saying this is a ridiculous smear.

01:20:26.727 --> 01:20:30.730
Uh, and you know, I do think it's an unfair smear, to be honest with you.

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.711
I don't think that we can be,

01:20:32.271 --> 01:20:36.415
bringing up the opinions of our family members and then prescribing them on us.

01:20:38.498 --> 01:20:44.644
How many of you, raise your hands, how many of you during COVID had a completely different viewpoint than your parents?

01:20:45.084 --> 01:20:53.753
Is it fair to then bring out the fact that your parent was pro everybody get the jab and everybody must be mandated and lockdowns and pro all of that?

01:20:54.053 --> 01:21:02.697
Not quite the same thing as Wiccan, not quite the same thing as religion, not quite the same thing as whatever this is.

01:21:03.618 --> 01:21:11.902
That equivalency is false, and I'm not sure if she wrote that script or someone else wrote it for her, but it's dumb.

01:21:12.982 --> 01:21:25.714
because having principles in the last five years about specific things different than your parents is very different than your parents raising you a certain way, which is what I think should be thought of as implied here.

01:21:26.355 --> 01:21:31.199
I don't know what to say other than, again, this is a show.

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:36.684
She's likely an unwitting participant, but a willing participant.

01:21:37.005 --> 01:21:38.045
She doesn't really care.

01:21:38.806 --> 01:21:49.232
She enjoys what she does, she enjoys the pay, she enjoys all the freedom that it gives her and her family, and I'm sure that she has many more resources than I do, otherwise they wouldn't be as successful.

01:21:49.312 --> 01:21:53.955
One of the resources she has is that most of the media platforms actively promote her.

01:21:55.115 --> 01:22:06.202
She's put in front of people, even people who don't need to see her, see her, because this is an approved part of the hamster wheel.

01:22:07.318 --> 01:22:08.879
So there's nothing dangerous here.

01:22:08.919 --> 01:22:12.681
The whole thing is sterile.

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:21.366
And now we have to say, well, then you must not really truly be part of the freedom movement because your dad was super into everybody getting the jab.

01:22:21.546 --> 01:22:23.487
You know, like that's not really a fair criticism.

01:22:23.547 --> 01:22:27.530
But I just wanted to bring up what the criticism was that Dr. Malone is talking about.

01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:33.638
so that you can understand the robust criticisms against Dr. Casey Means as being the Surgeon General.

01:22:34.218 --> 01:22:35.599
But that's, to me, not a good one.

01:22:35.619 --> 01:22:37.960
There are better arguments, and we'll get to that.

01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:43.364
So he says that next they attack her for not speaking out against the jab.

01:22:43.384 --> 01:22:45.245
Okay, so this is where we're getting to.

01:22:45.905 --> 01:22:51.688
But if she had, she would have not been able to be as effective as an advocate against big pharma and big ag.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:56.211
What?

01:22:57.799 --> 01:23:02.201
So you're saying it's okay she didn't speak up during COVID about anything.

01:23:02.501 --> 01:23:11.064
It's okay because she's now a big, you know, if she would have done that, nobody would have listened to her now that she's speaking out against big ag.

01:23:11.545 --> 01:23:14.746
She's speaking out against like big food, big ag.

01:23:14.806 --> 01:23:17.067
She wouldn't be able to do that if she spoke out against the jab.

01:23:17.087 --> 01:23:20.508
But you see, that's the problem because what's the Maha movement about?

01:23:21.068 --> 01:23:22.169
Is it about food?

01:23:22.389 --> 01:23:24.370
What is the Maha movement about, Kim?

01:23:25.307 --> 01:23:28.589
Did you have anybody tell you that Robert Malone was a player in this?

01:23:28.649 --> 01:23:37.633
Did anyone tell you that Robert Malone has been a player for a very long time, like since 9-11 and the anthrax vaccine, just like Meryl Nass?

01:23:39.154 --> 01:23:39.894
And Mary Holland?

01:23:41.018 --> 01:23:43.719
Has anyone talked about that with you besides me?

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.320
And did you just forget?

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.741
Did your producers forget?

01:23:47.221 --> 01:23:55.285
Do you not rank on a board somewhere the most important ideas that you've heard in the last year so that you can ask other people about those ideas?

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:57.407
Isn't that what a reporter would do?

01:23:57.787 --> 01:24:03.089
Hey, you know, a couple of weeks ago, I had a guy on who says that he was the advisor for RFK Jr.

01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:07.632
while he was writing the Wuhan coverup, and I haven't been able to discredit that claim.

01:24:08.412 --> 01:24:11.955
He says, X, Y, and Z. What are your thoughts on that?

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:26.525
Instead, she just reads the script that she's given, asks the question, and vigorously attempts to ponder them because that's what she's paid to do.

01:24:26.565 --> 01:24:28.326
You have to think of her more like an actor.

01:24:29.505 --> 01:24:30.706
An improv actor.

01:24:31.306 --> 01:24:32.306
Here's the script today.

01:24:32.526 --> 01:24:34.487
These are the issues that you want to get to.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.288
Make sure you stay away from this.

01:24:37.908 --> 01:24:38.289
Have fun.

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:41.410
Food?

01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:44.631
Is that what the main thing for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?

01:24:44.711 --> 01:24:45.472
Was it about food?

01:24:46.472 --> 01:24:49.013
Was it about, oh, he's just going to come in and he's going to change the food?

01:24:49.553 --> 01:24:56.416
No, I'm pretty sure that's not actually what skyrocketed him into the public sphere and why people in the Maha movement supported him.

01:24:56.516 --> 01:24:58.377
I'm pretty sure the number one issue was actually

01:25:01.533 --> 01:25:02.773
And so now it's food?

01:25:03.214 --> 01:25:03.834
Vaccines?

01:25:03.934 --> 01:25:04.814
And what does she mean?

01:25:05.474 --> 01:25:07.175
She means the COVID vaccine, right?

01:25:07.215 --> 01:25:08.796
Because the COVID shots are bad.

01:25:08.836 --> 01:25:17.819
They're free to say that, but we're not going to talk about 2020 and we're not going to talk about the previous vaccine schedule until they're ready to blame autism on it.

01:25:20.179 --> 01:25:20.339
Right.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:20.840
Okay.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:21.540
So.

01:25:23.322 --> 01:25:26.023
Keep that in mind as we watch some clips here.

01:25:28.003 --> 01:25:31.324
So people are saying she is a Manchurian candidate.

01:25:31.844 --> 01:25:32.285
Why?

01:25:32.845 --> 01:25:34.125
Because she's pivoting us.

01:25:35.446 --> 01:25:43.908
Because rather than focusing on and the childhood schedule and the, you know, hundred jabs we give children before the age of 18.

01:25:44.608 --> 01:25:50.130
It's an interesting opinion, Jason, because Dan Cohen really thinks highly of redacted

01:25:51.949 --> 01:25:54.853
It's an interesting opinion that I can't discount, that's for sure.

01:25:56.114 --> 01:26:01.200
Rather than focusing on that, she's focusing on food and metabolic health.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.762
And now you've got Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:02.802 --> 01:26:11.113
talking about Froot Loops and red dyes, and then he's going out there and he's saying, I recommend the, you know, for measles and I recommend the.

01:26:12.264 --> 01:26:13.085
for this out and the other.

01:26:13.285 --> 01:26:17.328
And you've got now, look at this, the FDA coming out today with this.

01:26:17.508 --> 01:26:19.249
Isn't that a wonderful enchantment?

01:26:19.289 --> 01:26:22.131
Whenever she blanks it out, you're being trained.

01:26:22.231 --> 01:26:27.215
Her viewers are being trained to think the word vaccine, which means that vaccines are real.

01:26:28.396 --> 01:26:29.837
The technology's real.

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.338
The idea is great.

01:26:32.199 --> 01:26:33.260
We just can't talk about them.

01:26:34.051 --> 01:26:38.754
It's a actual semantic enchantment for anybody that watches this.

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:44.378
You just assume that vaccines are real by the end of it because that's why they're blanked out.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:52.464
Gem of an announcement saying today, the FDA announced that on May, this was yesterday, actually.

01:26:52.864 --> 01:26:58.669
Today, the FDA announced that on May 22nd, so just in a couple of weeks, the FDA's

01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:14.113
and related biological products advisory committee will meet to publicly discuss and make recommendations on the selection of the 2025-2026 formula for COVID-19 for use in the United States."

01:27:14.553 --> 01:27:14.974
What?

01:27:15.634 --> 01:27:16.495
Wait a minute.

01:27:17.156 --> 01:27:19.598
I thought we were going to get rid of this from the schedule.

01:27:19.878 --> 01:27:22.080
What do you mean you're just going to update the formula?

01:27:23.123 --> 01:27:27.104
So you're not going- So she never had anybody tell her what was going on here, apparently.

01:27:27.224 --> 01:27:31.704
No one's ever let her know that this was about the Human Genome Project and it was by design.

01:27:32.765 --> 01:27:47.427
That the whole point of the novel virus was to get people to accept that transfection had worked, albeit flawed, albeit contaminated, according to the Human Genome Project former research and development director, Kevin, the hero, McKernan.

01:27:47.447 --> 01:27:50.468
I'm going to get rid of it.

01:27:51.128 --> 01:27:52.368
Why does anybody need this one?

01:27:53.732 --> 01:28:05.576
but you're going to update the formula and you're announcing in this proud announcement that soon in a couple of weeks, you're going to meet to publicly discuss and make recommendations on the formula for the, that you're going to keep on the schedule.

01:28:05.876 --> 01:28:07.097
This is what people are upset about.

01:28:07.237 --> 01:28:08.097
What is going on?

01:28:08.557 --> 01:28:12.899
I thought we elected the Maha movement and now we're still getting the COVID jab.

01:28:12.939 --> 01:28:14.799
It's just going to be an updated formula.

01:28:14.819 --> 01:28:15.540
Are you kidding me?

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.801
That's not what people were supporting RFK Jr for.

01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:23.773
So people are criticizing this selection.

01:28:24.193 --> 01:28:25.614
And so who's the head of that now?

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:32.760
That would be Vinay Prasad, who at the beginning of the pandemic arguably could be characterized as a child.

01:28:36.162 --> 01:28:40.005
Because they're saying that this is a divergent candidate.

01:28:40.025 --> 01:28:46.911
This is somebody, this Surgeon General is just gonna talk about getting out there and eating better and exercise and getting your sunlight.

01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:55.862
rather than let's get rid of the poisons, the big pharma poisons that are being pumped into our children from birth.

01:28:56.162 --> 01:29:05.246
But here's where it gets confusing because there've been times when Dr. Casey Means actually does talk about big pharma.

01:29:05.286 --> 01:29:07.247
Here she is on Tucker Carlson's show.

01:29:07.307 --> 01:29:07.767
Watch this.

01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:09.768
They make us sick, but they don't kill us.

01:29:10.108 --> 01:29:11.409
And then we are drugged for life.

01:29:11.729 --> 01:29:12.950
You look at what's happening in children.

01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:27.637
a child born in a hospital in the United States today, within hours of coming from source into this, you know, into this body, the first thing that happens to them is pharmaceutical intervention.

01:29:28.138 --> 01:29:32.760
Without really asking, you know, I mean, there's barely... Pharmaceutical intervention.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:37.583
So she's very precisely imprecise about how she talks about it.

01:29:38.103 --> 01:29:41.845
Coming from the source into this body,

01:29:47.031 --> 01:29:51.437
wearing a sun around her neck in a black sweater.

01:29:53.319 --> 01:29:54.360
Inform consent about this.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:54.981
That child.

01:29:55.382 --> 01:29:57.004
On Tucker Carlson.

01:29:58.328 --> 01:30:17.822
So again, this is the exact media apparatus that has been used to create a fake populist movement that was wrapped up in the fake Donald Trump administration, which is essentially doing everything that the Democrats want to do, but with a different name on it and a different spin in the media.

01:30:21.343 --> 01:30:23.384
That's why we're not talking about the CDC.

01:30:23.424 --> 01:30:24.924
That's why we're talking about the U.S.

01:30:25.964 --> 01:30:27.185
Department of Agriculture.

01:30:27.205 --> 01:30:29.806
That's why we're not talking about Jay Bhattacharya anymore.

01:30:30.246 --> 01:30:34.687
That's why we're not talking about Health and Human Services Secretary who's doing nothing about the PrEP Act.

01:30:39.749 --> 01:30:40.289
A lawyer.

01:30:41.997 --> 01:30:55.336
that HHS is not telling us at all about why the PREP Act should be struck as unconstitutional, even though that would be the quickest way to end this giant apparatus they supposedly support eliminating.

01:30:55.577 --> 01:30:56.939
Burn it down to the ground.

01:30:59.207 --> 01:31:06.269
eyes are smeared with erythromycin ointment, and they're given a hepatitis B in their first day of life.

01:31:06.849 --> 01:31:08.009
And what are these two things for?

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:18.892
I mean, I mention this because it's just emblematic of how we're put on the pharma treadmill from the moment we are born in this country for reasons that are very strange.

01:31:19.172 --> 01:31:24.054
The erythromycin ointment is to prevent chlamydial infections of the eye, which we test women for chlamydia.

01:31:24.094 --> 01:31:27.215
So why would every baby in the United States need this ointment if the mom doesn't have it?

01:31:28.675 --> 01:31:35.761
is for hepatitis B, which is a sexually transmitted disease and IV drug user disease, of course, which babies are not going to be exposed to.

01:31:36.582 --> 01:31:39.004
And yet every single baby in America is getting the intervention.

01:31:39.064 --> 01:31:43.549
So from the literally the day we are born, why not test the pregnant?

01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:45.791
So so there you go.

01:31:45.831 --> 01:31:53.297
You know, she's talking again, a limited spectrum of debate that was already debated years and years ago was actually the subject of the movie Vaxxed.

01:31:54.378 --> 01:31:55.019
I mean, come on.

01:31:56.271 --> 01:32:00.012
They've been talking about it for years without prioritizing any messages.

01:32:01.092 --> 01:32:08.874
Without even prioritizing the real message that the longer we wait, the more likely it will do less damage.

01:32:08.934 --> 01:32:20.596
That's absolutely biologically true because interrupting the pattern integrity during the fastest parts of development are the times when the most disturbing things can happen to their trajectory across time.

01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:32.146
And so although hitting your kid with a baseball bat is never a good idea, if you wait until they're eight years old, they're probably gonna be okay and their math skills won't be affected.

01:32:33.986 --> 01:32:34.507
Do you see?

01:32:35.667 --> 01:32:45.912
So there is a limited spectrum of debate that has been fooled around with for years with people like Paul Thomas and these other people who say they have a altered vaccine schedule, but they don't have a real message.

01:32:46.889 --> 01:32:57.013
The message is very, very simple, that if you're gonna inject someone a combination of substances that's bullshit, the longer you wait, the better.

01:32:59.234 --> 01:33:01.155
Why not just make that your message then?

01:33:01.655 --> 01:33:09.018
But of course, Paul Thomas and CHD and all these heroes have never made that their message because that isn't their message.

01:33:10.029 --> 01:33:12.571
they are put in place to sabotage that message.

01:33:12.631 --> 01:33:20.377
That message that Brandy Vaughn was pushing, the message that I'm pushing, and few other people have managed to enunciate as well as us.

01:33:22.418 --> 01:33:23.199
That's the trick.

01:33:23.959 --> 01:33:28.963
It's a really simple message if intramuscular injection is not medicine.

01:33:29.463 --> 01:33:34.287
It's a really simple message if RNA cannot pandemic.

01:33:34.347 --> 01:33:38.210
It's a real simple message if public health is a lie.

01:33:39.884 --> 01:33:41.785
And these people have never gotten to that.

01:33:41.845 --> 01:33:47.568
Their simplest messages are rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:58.875
Just as ambiguous as this entire podcast has been at trying to distill some message, some useful information out of this show on social media.

01:33:58.975 --> 01:34:00.876
Kim is not able to do it.

01:34:01.596 --> 01:34:04.497
I think Gigo and Biological does a hell of a good job of doing it.

01:34:05.718 --> 01:34:06.878
She's talking about these ointments.

01:34:06.898 --> 01:34:09.440
She's talking about these pharmaceutical interventions.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:10.460
So what's the problem?

01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.301
I mean, it sounds like she's on our team, right?

01:34:12.321 --> 01:34:16.363
It sounds like she's all about calling out the fact that, what are we doing to these babies?

01:34:16.843 --> 01:34:19.004
And it sounds like she's calling out food.

01:34:19.044 --> 01:34:20.705
You know, all of these things are good things.

01:34:20.785 --> 01:34:22.545
I haven't heard her say anything that I don't like.

01:34:22.946 --> 01:34:24.206
And I'm sure you're not hearing it either.

01:34:24.746 --> 01:34:26.787
So what is exactly the issue?

01:34:26.847 --> 01:34:27.668
Here she is also.

01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:28.348
I want to show you this.

01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:30.129
This one's a little longer, but I want you to watch.

01:34:31.161 --> 01:34:35.222
I want you to watch the whole thing because this gives you.

01:34:35.422 --> 01:34:37.022
She wants you to watch the whole thing.

01:34:37.082 --> 01:34:37.902
And what is this?

01:34:37.942 --> 01:34:51.405
Well, this is Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan's group of meddlers chosen to present in front of Senator Ron Johnson, supposedly a guy who called me in 2022 because Robert Malone recommended me as an advisor.

01:34:54.046 --> 01:34:54.906
Yep, that's true.

01:34:55.226 --> 01:34:57.686
He called me on the same day that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:34:57.726 --> 01:34:58.106
called me.

01:34:59.467 --> 01:35:00.767
Both told me the same story.

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:10.183
Robert Malone sat them down to watch my stream with Charles Rixey when Charles Rixey had come to my house at the beginning of 2022.

01:35:10.723 --> 01:35:21.170
And so I am in contact with Robert Malone indirectly, but directly with Senator Ron Johnson, directly with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:23.131
because of Robert Malone's recommendation.

01:35:23.772 --> 01:35:30.557
Robert Malone then proceeded to tour the world for years with the international COVID summits, promoting people like Merrill Nass,

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:40.422
and Asim Malhotra and Sasha Latupova and Mike Palmer, all these frauds.

01:35:43.463 --> 01:35:47.844
And now you can see very clearly here, we have to listen to her presentation.

01:35:48.364 --> 01:35:50.065
And what will this presentation be?

01:35:50.105 --> 01:35:59.608
Will it be a presentation with a big message, a presentation with some information, or is it just gonna be math and statistics and ratios

01:36:00.691 --> 01:36:05.113
that she's gonna read from a piece of paper, but can't synthesize across them.

01:36:07.114 --> 01:36:10.395
Can't say and answer the question, so what?

01:36:12.536 --> 01:36:13.576
Because that's the trick.

01:36:14.016 --> 01:36:17.418
CHD never answers the question, so what?

01:36:17.998 --> 01:36:22.220
Kim never answers the question, so what?

01:36:27.796 --> 01:36:32.382
Maybe I'm going to put the song So What on while these people don't answer the question.

01:36:37.657 --> 01:36:44.802
to a very clear idea of what her agenda is going to be as Surgeon General.

01:36:45.262 --> 01:36:48.424
And I'm going to tell you, you will agree with everything she says.

01:36:49.005 --> 01:36:54.428
But again, it's not what the Maha Movement's primary focus is.

01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:56.790
And that's their big beef.

01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.691
Watch this.

01:36:58.311 --> 01:37:08.541
You would think that the American healthcare system and our government agencies would be clamoring to fix metabolic health and reduce American suffering and costs.

01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:10.082
But they're not.

01:37:11.043 --> 01:37:16.989
They are deafeningly silent about metabolic dysfunction and its known causes.

01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:19.932
It's not an overstatement to say

01:37:21.431 --> 01:37:33.496
that I learned virtually nothing at Stanford Medical School about the tens of thousands of scientific papers that elucidate these root causes of why American health.

01:37:33.516 --> 01:37:45.501
7% of the foods our kids are eating

01:37:51.305 --> 01:37:53.126
nutrition courses in medical school.

01:37:54.107 --> 01:38:00.012
I didn't learn that 82% of independently funded studies show harm from processed food.

01:38:00.032 --> 01:38:13.883
In medical school I didn't learn that 95% of the people who created the recent USDA Food Guidelines for America had significant conflicts of interest with the food industry.

01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:15.024
So what?

01:38:18.079 --> 01:38:23.206
of synthetic pesticides are being sprayed on our food every single year, 99% of the farmland in the United States.

01:38:27.105 --> 01:38:30.466
is sprayed with synthetic pesticides, many from China and Germany.

01:38:31.326 --> 01:38:47.351
And these invisible, tasteless chemicals are strongly linked to autism, ADHD, sex hormone disruption, thyroid disease, sperm dysfunction, Alzheimer's, dementia, birth defects, cancer, obesity, liver dysfunction, female infertility, and more.

01:38:47.651 --> 01:38:48.852
She can barely read it.

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:52.453
So what?

01:38:55.474 --> 01:38:56.114
So what?

01:38:59.161 --> 01:39:01.802
That's the question that she will never answer.

01:39:02.663 --> 01:39:03.943
Never, ever, ever.

01:39:06.824 --> 01:39:09.746
Our water, and we are now even inhaling them in our air.

01:39:10.626 --> 01:39:19.170
And that very recent research from just the past couple of months tells us that now about 0.5% of our brains by weight are now plastic.

01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:20.891
Who's sitting right next to her?

01:39:20.911 --> 01:39:23.071
I didn't learn that there are more than 80,000 toxins.

01:39:23.412 --> 01:39:26.273
Who is sitting right next to her in this meeting?

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.481
Who's that guy?

01:39:30.681 --> 01:39:33.703
Cause he's not the FDA director yet, not in this meeting.

01:39:38.327 --> 01:39:46.392
Is this the right appropriate dress to be in front of the Senate as a doctor or a, or a, or a, or a whatever is it?

01:39:46.672 --> 01:39:47.793
I don't, I don't really think so.

01:39:48.113 --> 01:39:48.353
Sure.

01:39:48.393 --> 01:39:52.056
Food, water, air and homes by industry, many of which are banned in Europe.

01:39:53.030 --> 01:40:01.494
and they are known to alter our gene expression, alter our microbiome composition and the lining of our gut and disrupt our hormones.

01:40:02.335 --> 01:40:06.817
I didn't learn that heavy metals like aluminum and lead are- Look at her read.

01:40:08.158 --> 01:40:09.379
She's reading.

01:40:09.439 --> 01:40:13.261
Does this look like somebody who has just studied this stuff so she knows it?

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:19.464
It doesn't even look like a person who's rehearsed reading this enough to be able to look up.

01:40:22.932 --> 01:40:26.233
We should be ashamed of ourselves for falling for this trap.

01:40:28.713 --> 01:40:33.574
Especially the one that got us him and Bhattacharya and Kennedy.

01:40:35.135 --> 01:40:42.376
This is a meaningless person in a meaningless post and this discussion about her is meaningless.

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.297
But supposedly it's really important.

01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:47.091
Nicole Shanahan.

01:40:47.191 --> 01:40:47.952
Nicole, how are you?

01:40:48.172 --> 01:40:50.473
Look at the studio of Glenn Beck.

01:40:50.513 --> 01:40:52.334
Look what I have to compete against.

01:40:52.994 --> 01:40:55.095
How many staff members need to be paid?

01:40:58.637 --> 01:41:02.158
How many resources are bent on making this happen?

01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:12.083
And how much does Gigome Biological kick ass if you realize that there's just one person and his wife doing this?

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:18.665
Think about that because these people claim to be the independent media.

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:23.731
They claim to be that new narrative network that's gonna save America, but they're not.

01:41:24.953 --> 01:41:25.594
They're not.

01:41:26.034 --> 01:41:28.998
And you can see it because they have big money behind them.

01:41:29.258 --> 01:41:31.782
All of these people have big money behind them.

01:41:32.796 --> 01:41:34.837
The same big money that's behind Joe Rogan.

01:41:34.857 --> 01:41:36.958
The same big money that's behind Steve Kirsch.

01:41:36.978 --> 01:41:40.521
The same big money that's behind Brett Weinstein.

01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:46.304
The same big money that's behind all of these podcasts like Lex Friedman, like TWIV.

01:41:47.845 --> 01:41:50.166
The same big money is behind PBS NewsHour.

01:41:50.206 --> 01:41:52.968
The same big money is behind all these people on the left.

01:41:56.414 --> 01:42:03.444
Because they all eat at the same table, they all go to the same steak dinners, they all go to the same private meetings, they all fly in the same private jets.

01:42:05.908 --> 01:42:12.818
And they've all agreed to let Elon Musk and Peter Thiel be the front man for this new movement.

01:42:16.249 --> 01:42:32.776
and Steve Bannon and all of these people that are coordinating this narrative that's supposed to trap the conservatives of America, the people, the last remaining patriots in a hamster wheel that will get them to the same destination that everybody's running to get to on the other side.

01:42:35.737 --> 01:42:38.938
And Glenn Beck is an integral part of that.

01:42:39.895 --> 01:42:54.604
Remember, a few years ago, we were supposed to believe that Glenn Beck had all of Charles Rixey's data and that Charles Rixey was meeting with Glenn Beck to help him design that three chalkboard presentation about how Ralph Baric did everything.

01:42:54.644 --> 01:43:01.268
And now, five years later or four years later, we have Kevin McKernan on a huge podcast saying exactly that.

01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:06.251
It's just, it's remarkable.

01:43:06.411 --> 01:43:07.112
So what?

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.020
Very good, Glenn.

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:13.961
How are you doing?

01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:14.961
I'm very good.

01:43:16.622 --> 01:43:17.542
It's great to have you here.

01:43:18.162 --> 01:43:30.127
So I want to ask you, the Surgeon General thing, are you for Casey Means or not for Casey Means?

01:43:31.110 --> 01:43:31.671
So what?

01:43:31.731 --> 01:43:34.335
Hundreds of thousands of doctors?

01:43:47.807 --> 01:43:49.008
Well, that's just a myth.

01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:51.711
That's just an absolute myth.

01:43:51.772 --> 01:43:59.500
There might be a hundred, but there aren't hundreds of thousands of doctors and there aren't thousands of doctors who've lost their license.

01:44:00.101 --> 01:44:02.384
She is a liar.

01:44:02.464 --> 01:44:04.726
This is a social media myth.

01:44:05.567 --> 01:44:06.527
Listen carefully.

01:44:06.948 --> 01:44:10.729
The indignity in our medical system, once again, that is what I'm for.

01:44:10.769 --> 01:44:13.710
That is what propelled Maha into existence.

01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:20.472
That is what propelled Bobby Kennedy into the position of running for president of the United States.

01:44:20.592 --> 01:44:23.873
That's why I joined the campaign.

01:44:24.073 --> 01:44:32.676
It really is about listening to this group of doctors that did the right thing during the COVID pandemic, that spoke up,

01:44:32.776 --> 01:44:41.979
The group of doctors, you mean like Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough, Ryan Cole, Robert Malone.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.640
Goodness sakes.

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.761
It was dangerous to speak up.

01:44:48.181 --> 01:44:49.942
That lost their licenses.

01:44:50.362 --> 01:44:54.063
And so when I- Where's the list of those people that have lost their license?

01:44:54.123 --> 01:44:55.223
I really want to see it.

01:44:56.984 --> 01:44:57.844
Show me the list.

01:44:59.224 --> 01:45:00.605
I hear from that face.

01:45:01.334 --> 01:45:08.117
concern or research about individuals in and around Maha, I have to listen to them.

01:45:08.497 --> 01:45:12.339
And I do listen to them because oftentimes they are right.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.780
They're brave and they're principled.

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:19.343
Can you imagine if I took a picture like that just because I lived in Texas?

01:45:20.143 --> 01:45:21.864
Can you imagine it for a second?

01:45:23.444 --> 01:45:26.486
Even if I had a horse, I don't think I would ever buy that jacket.

01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:31.657
I would love to have a horse, but I mean, holy crap.

01:45:33.477 --> 01:45:34.438
He's the Marlboro man over here.

01:45:34.458 --> 01:45:41.759
So the concern I've been hearing from that group of people is that MAHA has, you know, any movement, MAGA.

01:45:41.819 --> 01:45:44.260
It's got a lot of Brokeback Mountain feel to that.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:55.263
I had this issue too, of infiltration by different groups that are more self-serving than they are for the movement itself.

01:45:56.238 --> 01:46:06.709
And so just one example, Casey Means is a founder of a company that does biometric harvesting.

01:46:06.749 --> 01:46:11.114
She's very close with many of the big data

01:46:11.434 --> 01:46:13.195
So it's a real distraction here.

01:46:13.255 --> 01:46:17.418
Number one, just to make sure, you know, lightning bolt is the symbol of somebody.

01:46:18.398 --> 01:46:23.862
Number two, harvesting biometric data is not what you need to be worried about.

01:46:23.882 --> 01:46:30.526
You need to be worried about harvesting of genetic data and that using AI to interface with your medical data.

01:46:30.546 --> 01:46:31.947
That's what you need to be worried about.

01:46:32.007 --> 01:46:39.532
That is the central aim of what Larry Ellison was talking about with the AI building in Texas and all that other stuff.

01:46:41.021 --> 01:46:45.843
That's what Biden was talking about when he said, share all the data about cancer.

01:46:46.403 --> 01:46:49.285
That's what it was all about when they built that institute at Wimber.

01:46:49.425 --> 01:46:50.465
It was about the data.

01:46:52.266 --> 01:46:54.167
So we can go back as far as you want to.

01:46:54.207 --> 01:46:56.167
It's not about biometric data.

01:46:56.207 --> 01:47:01.970
Biometric data is a huge technological distraction, as dumb as Neuralink.

01:47:03.993 --> 01:47:05.194
I mean, it's cool.

01:47:05.294 --> 01:47:09.338
It's nice to see your heart rate and see how hard you worked on your bike and stuff like that.

01:47:09.678 --> 01:47:11.219
But that's not the data they want.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:23.450
I assure you, they want medical remnant derived data where they can get much, much, much more detailed measurements and quantification of your biological state than from a freaking watch.

01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.831
Come on, people.

01:47:26.414 --> 01:47:39.571
biometric harvesting companies in Silicon Valley, and this, I know several of these people, you do not want them running in a government position that is responsible for everybody equally, right?

01:47:39.611 --> 01:47:40.672
They're not necessarily going to do that.

01:47:40.712 --> 01:47:42.555
So wait, wait, wait, what is bio, what is that?

01:47:43.115 --> 01:47:44.077
They're harvesting what?

01:47:46.067 --> 01:47:48.811
Oh, he has no idea all this time.

01:47:48.872 --> 01:47:55.101
He's been working as a podcaster and an interviewer and a intrepid journalist on the back of his horse.

01:47:55.522 --> 01:47:56.604
He's not a, what is this?

01:47:56.704 --> 01:47:57.605
What are you talking about?

01:47:57.645 --> 01:47:59.128
What's biometric surveillance?

01:48:00.802 --> 01:48:13.846
Well, so biometric data is anything between heart rate data to all of the data that is collected from your Fitbit or high glucose monitor.

01:48:13.866 --> 01:48:15.867
It could be labs.

01:48:16.187 --> 01:48:18.387
It could be, yeah.

01:48:18.447 --> 01:48:20.688
And then there's all the DNA harvesting.

01:48:21.888 --> 01:48:24.149
All the DNA harvesting?

01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:26.090
Well, holy cow.

01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:27.470
She just said it.

01:48:28.631 --> 01:48:29.651
Isn't that interesting?

01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:33.296
Huh, because I think she's all for that.

01:48:34.817 --> 01:48:36.197
I think she's all for it.

01:48:36.237 --> 01:48:41.641
I think she knows that AI will be used because she said that on the campaign trail with Bobby Kennedy.

01:48:42.281 --> 01:48:46.323
Because Mary Holland is arguing for AI to make innovation in medicine.

01:48:46.764 --> 01:48:55.029
Because Dr. Mumper of the CHD has argued that the vaccine schedule needed to be genetically tuned to people's, you know,

01:48:56.178 --> 01:49:07.237
vulnerabilities that the James Lyons Weiler has argued for a long time that non vaccinated groups are enriched for for vulnerabilities to vaccines.

01:49:07.277 --> 01:49:09.922
That's why they don't use them or some shit like that.

01:49:12.928 --> 01:49:14.650
and big data that's being done.

01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:27.265
So, you know, I think that the base, MAHA really came from medical freedom and medical sovereignty and the idea that we have to keep conflicts of interest out of the government.

01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:32.571
And so when I, you know, see some stuff going on that

01:49:33.292 --> 01:49:34.734
We could be doing better, right?

01:49:34.954 --> 01:49:50.514
Our job, and I learned this from the MAGA base, our job is to continue to seek the best possible people for government that are truly putting the principles of this country first, the principles of American sovereignty first.

01:49:51.121 --> 01:49:56.645
A lot of people don't know that I'm a painter, and I gave up painting because of demoralizing pain in my hands.

01:49:56.925 --> 01:49:57.825
I was losing hope.

01:49:58.366 --> 01:50:01.928
If pain keeps you from really living, I urge you to do what I did.

01:50:01.988 --> 01:50:03.069
Try Relief Factor.

01:50:03.469 --> 01:50:07.091
Relief Factor is a 100% drug-free supplement developed by doctors.

01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:10.273
It's safe to take every day, and it has helped me and so many others.

01:50:10.814 --> 01:50:13.215
You can try their three-week quick start right now, $19.95 at relieffactor.com.

01:50:21.178 --> 01:50:23.820
So you wrote yesterday, it's very strange, it doesn't make any sense.

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.423
I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr.

01:50:26.483 --> 01:50:34.730
in the Senate confirmation that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment and that people much more qualified would be.

01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:40.475
I don't know if JFK, sorry, RFK very clearly lied to me or what's going on.

01:50:40.935 --> 01:50:48.422
It has been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to someone regularly who is controlling his decisions and it isn't President Trump.

01:50:48.462 --> 01:50:48.822
Trump.

01:50:48.962 --> 01:51:11.787
Now keep in mind what I'm trying to show you here is this is precisely the narrative that was promoted by Kim using the same argument that well you tweeted this so I think it's important that I tell everybody what you tweeted that the truth is being discussed and distilled on X and Glenn Beck also agrees because it's all one network

01:51:12.642 --> 01:51:15.243
It's all one network that agrees Rumble's awesome.

01:51:15.763 --> 01:51:18.244
It's all one network that agrees Ivermectin's awesome.

01:51:18.284 --> 01:51:21.065
It's all one network that agrees that there was a novel virus.

01:51:21.105 --> 01:51:25.466
It's all one network that agrees that X is where the truth is being sorted out.

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:41.932
And these agreements trap our children in a social media dystopia where reality is no longer accessible and it is instead, the only thing we are offered is a performance like this.

01:51:44.039 --> 01:51:47.200
The only way is to get off social media and to establish our own.

01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:48.500
That's why I have PeerTube.

01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.801
That's why I have Soapbox.

01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:50.421
It ain't great.

01:51:50.861 --> 01:51:52.842
It ain't perfect, but it is ours.

01:51:55.022 --> 01:51:56.463
And I want a radio station.

01:51:56.603 --> 01:52:02.745
I want an AM radio station with 1,500 watts, the maximum power that I'm allowed to use as a civilian.

01:52:03.445 --> 01:52:12.288
With regards to the siblings, there is something very artificial and aggressive about them, almost as if they were bred and raised as Manchurian assets.

01:52:12.981 --> 01:52:13.301
Wow.

01:52:14.782 --> 01:52:26.168
So to keep in mind, that was not, I was responding to Dr. Suzanne Humphreys, who was also expressing very similar sentiments.

01:52:26.208 --> 01:52:36.394
So Shanahan is promoting Suzanne Humphreys, he's promoting Suzanne Humphreys, and they agree that Suzanne Humphreys is a relevant voice.

01:52:37.614 --> 01:52:45.675
Suzanne Humphreys being that person that was in that video with Brandy Vaughn has had a book from 2013 and hasn't really saved anyone since.

01:52:47.436 --> 01:52:50.696
Who claims that, you know, Roman Biansic, he did a lot of stuff.

01:52:50.736 --> 01:52:51.597
He had all the charts.

01:52:51.657 --> 01:52:53.777
All I did was kind of, you know, put my name on the book.

01:52:55.377 --> 01:52:57.438
That's what she said when Brandy interviewed her.

01:52:58.638 --> 01:53:04.719
And just like Pauly Tommy, when Brandy called her a hero, she didn't look very comfortable with it because they know.

01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:07.761
They know they are part of this narrative.

01:53:07.801 --> 01:53:09.181
They are screwing people over.

01:53:09.221 --> 01:53:12.643
They are sabotaging what would otherwise be a movement.

01:53:14.544 --> 01:53:21.547
Why do you think California has the most fractured anti-vax network of all the states in America right now?

01:53:21.947 --> 01:53:24.148
Why CHD California dissolved?

01:53:24.228 --> 01:53:25.348
Why do you think that is?

01:53:26.289 --> 01:53:27.129
It's by design.

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.733
Concerns there's better candidates.

01:53:34.914 --> 01:53:36.455
So what's going on?

01:53:36.475 --> 01:53:56.308
I also heard from other MDs in the field that there was another doctor that RFK had wanted for the position Very very qualified doctor and and and you know, she was caught by surprise as well by this other choice so, you know, there's

01:53:57.569 --> 01:53:58.851
Okay, I see you in the chat.

01:53:58.931 --> 01:54:00.273
I'm going to offer this right now.

01:54:00.373 --> 01:54:05.340
Today, I'm going to figure out how to take the audio and put it on Spotify.

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:08.664
I have a couple or one up on Spotify, but I haven't been putting them up.

01:54:08.724 --> 01:54:12.349
If you want that, I'll start putting them up on Spotify and see what happens.

01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:16.054
They they don't call it the swamp for no reason.

01:54:16.114 --> 01:54:16.374
Right.

01:54:16.534 --> 01:54:21.220
And and I'm you know, I'm not officially within the administration at all.

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:28.569
In fact, I've decided to take the path of staying an independent media person, which I think

01:54:29.489 --> 01:54:53.765
I think, and you know this, Glenn, it's really important that when you are an independent media voice, that you stick by your principles and that you're not just a mouthpiece for any... So she's declaring herself an independent media voice, and she does have a podcast and a lot more followers than Marker Eye, because again, the algorithm is being used to assist her rise.

01:54:54.696 --> 01:55:04.841
In fact, it may have been the plan all along that she would get into the public sphere and get on TV as a vice presidential candidate going nowhere.

01:55:05.281 --> 01:55:15.747
And then this artificial media structure would support her afterward and make her continue to rise in this debate afterward or in this discussion afterward.

01:55:15.787 --> 01:55:16.707
Again, it's a theater.

01:55:18.268 --> 01:55:21.830
They're elevating people in their role in the play, that's it.

01:55:23.686 --> 01:55:30.695
And she may have always been intended to be one of these people who was going to, you know, become a podcaster and influence people that way.

01:55:31.155 --> 01:55:34.460
How many cats can you herd is the only question.

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:36.783
And I'm not allowed to herd any cats.

01:55:37.143 --> 01:55:41.829
I'm prevented from there being any type of herding going on.

01:55:43.276 --> 01:55:49.524
government organization, but you're really on the outside reflecting back the hopes and wishes of the constituents.

01:55:49.704 --> 01:55:52.087
Yeah, and it's very hard to do.

01:55:52.147 --> 01:55:57.414
I mean, I take stances against the president and for the president, and you always have to

01:55:58.055 --> 01:56:05.781
You always have to balance, uh, you know, I have my opinion and I'm never going to be bought out by anybody.

01:56:05.841 --> 01:56:09.044
I'm never, but, but you all, I think it's a good time to wrap up here.

01:56:09.084 --> 01:56:11.786
I'm going to move on and just show you what I was working on the other day.

01:56:11.866 --> 01:56:17.591
Remember, um, this is gig on biological, high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:56:17.651 --> 01:56:20.653
Biology is definitely the way we seek the truth together here.

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:25.137
Um, and, uh, yesterday I showed you on the bike was timed out.

01:56:25.797 --> 01:56:32.740
And we discussed these guys that were behind Marty McCarty's rise to prominence on social media.

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:41.104
You saw Marty McCarty sitting next to Casey Means in that Senator Ron Johnson, Robert Malone,

01:56:42.024 --> 01:56:46.786
Kevin McKernan, little group of people that was the second or third installment in front of the Senate.

01:56:47.326 --> 01:57:02.293
Now, pointing out who these people are and telling you what you can see if you just look for yourself, I thought I would go and see if I could find what YouTube has to offer for a calendar of ZDogg's promotion of Marty McCary.

01:57:02.913 --> 01:57:10.195
So I just did a little search on YouTube and I started to mark all of the places where they had done videos starting in 2019.

01:57:10.255 --> 01:57:14.696
In 2019 there were a couple August 31st 2019 and November 13th 2019 where they're talking about his book and they're talking about his book.

01:57:23.991 --> 01:57:29.093
Then in 2020, we had three podcasts in a row in January.

01:57:29.654 --> 01:57:33.736
January 15th, 16th, and 17th, also with really nice thumbnails.

01:57:34.196 --> 01:57:38.698
Then we had a May 15th where they were cutting through COVID fake news with Marty McCary.

01:57:40.159 --> 01:57:43.400
Then we had Convalescent Plasma on September 5th, 2020.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:47.302
Then we had October 17th, still talking about COVID myths.

01:57:48.541 --> 01:57:49.622
That's a lot of videos.

01:57:50.422 --> 01:57:51.703
And we're still in the murder.

01:57:51.743 --> 01:57:53.305
You can see the murder is still going on.

01:57:53.365 --> 01:57:57.528
Delay the second dose, February 21st, or sorry, February 3rd, 2021.

01:57:57.588 --> 01:57:59.770
Then May 2021, they do two videos together.

01:57:59.790 --> 01:58:02.592
Then in June of 21, they do another video together.

01:58:02.612 --> 01:58:04.733
Then in September, they do another video together.

01:58:04.753 --> 01:58:08.636
And then in September, the day later, they do another live update together.

01:58:08.736 --> 01:58:10.738
And then December 4th, they do another video with,

01:58:17.563 --> 01:58:19.683
him and Vinay Prasad.

01:58:19.723 --> 01:58:22.964
So now we're starting to really see an interesting pattern, right?

01:58:24.024 --> 01:58:25.104
When the murder is happening.

01:58:26.205 --> 01:58:31.986
We have 2022, March, you know, COVID common sense again with Vinay Prasad.

01:58:32.406 --> 01:58:36.547
Then of course, COVID myopia, May 11th, 2022.

01:58:37.207 --> 01:58:42.948
And then there's a really weird absence for almost a year after the murder stopped.

01:58:46.323 --> 01:58:52.467
It's almost like they didn't need to podcast because there was no narrative to control for a year or so.

01:58:52.567 --> 01:58:55.188
Just time to run out, clock to run out.

01:58:55.548 --> 01:59:05.434
It was in 2023 that I wasted all my time with Jessica Hockett and Jonathan Engler and Professor Martin Neal and all these jackasses from Panda that wanted to write a virology review.

01:59:05.454 --> 01:59:14.300
2023 was when I was working for CHD and being regularly told that I shouldn't talk about Robert Malone until they finally fired me at the end of 23.

01:59:19.326 --> 01:59:25.068
And so then in 2024, they had to pick it up again where I'm about to be nominated for FDA.

01:59:25.108 --> 01:59:28.569
So I better get out there again, make sure that Vinay's out there again.

01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:30.809
We'll do a couple, two tree shows together.

01:59:31.249 --> 01:59:34.890
I might even go work with this guy because you know, Tony Fauci likes him too.

01:59:35.691 --> 01:59:38.291
So I'm going to get promoted again because I want a job.

01:59:38.992 --> 01:59:40.232
I'm trying to get a job.

01:59:42.523 --> 01:59:44.404
So what does this pattern really tell you?

01:59:44.444 --> 01:59:49.666
I just, you know, make sure you realize there were three in a row in January 15th, 16th, and 17th.

01:59:50.227 --> 01:59:51.567
What does this pattern tell you?

01:59:51.607 --> 01:59:53.348
What are the murder and lies for?

01:59:55.189 --> 02:00:05.173
What are they doing with this anticipated rise in all cause mortality other than shifting the seats of power, shifting the seat and the perception of power.

02:00:06.114 --> 02:00:09.335
Kind of like what Alex Karp said, he went to Germany to learn.

02:00:09.375 --> 02:00:10.596
How do people know things?

02:00:12.878 --> 02:00:18.160
Podcasts are enchantments that have been used to hide the murder and lies.

02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:28.843
Have been used to bamboozle us into accepting a mystery of a novel virus that may have come from a laboratory and that Tony Fauci may have even produced.

02:00:29.243 --> 02:00:30.763
Maybe even Ralph Baric made it.

02:00:32.184 --> 02:00:35.685
Or did he just teach the Chinese how to make it and then they baked the cake?

02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:43.412
Of course, I've shown you this video of James Lyons Weiler.

02:00:43.452 --> 02:00:54.197
And the reason why I show it to you is because he too is a red thread, which like Kevin McCairn, anybody associated with this fraud should immediately be discounted.

02:00:55.657 --> 02:01:10.807
That's why I think beyond a shadow of a doubt, CHD must be a corrupt organization because this guy features so prominently in everything they've done from the moment that the World Mercury Project changed its name.

02:01:12.948 --> 02:01:14.469
And this guy's terrified of me.

02:01:14.509 --> 02:01:18.372
I don't know how many times I've been on the same premises of him and never talked to him.

02:01:19.072 --> 02:01:20.233
He just walks away.

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:24.215
He moved from Pittsburgh in 2020 because of me.

02:01:26.141 --> 02:01:26.941
Prove me wrong.

02:01:32.283 --> 02:01:42.826
I want to thank the media for being here and thank everyone online for... And of course this fraud was also a year later in a stream with all of these frauds.

02:01:42.926 --> 02:01:48.048
Steve Kirsch, Mike Yeadon, Robert Malone.

02:01:48.068 --> 02:01:52.369
I'm sorry, I get Robert Malone and Jessica Rose mixed up all the time.

02:01:53.049 --> 02:01:55.190
And Matt Crawford and

02:01:56.181 --> 02:01:57.122
Mark Girardeau.

02:01:58.163 --> 02:02:05.268
These are all spectacularly tied to my life in those five years, spectacularly tied to distracting me.

02:02:06.969 --> 02:02:08.430
Matt Crawford's one of the worst.

02:02:09.011 --> 02:02:22.661
I rarely talk about him because he really, really lied to me in a pretty, pretty nasty way, multiple times, and then lied about me in a Bitcoin chat on Signal that has over 150 participants.

02:02:24.764 --> 02:02:28.626
for more than a year, as far as I can tell, I stopped checking.

02:02:29.547 --> 02:02:35.390
Just like I kind of stopped checking on Kevin McCarran, but I can count on him pretty much making a video about me every couple of weeks.

02:02:39.893 --> 02:02:41.834
So he had Steve Kirsch, right?

02:02:41.914 --> 02:02:50.619
He had Peter McCullough, he had Meryl Nass, he had Pierre Kory, all during the time when the murder was still being covered up.

02:02:51.793 --> 02:02:54.195
all during the time when the clock is being run out.

02:02:54.615 --> 02:03:00.940
And so these people all being on the same show together is impossibly, it's impossible to ignore.

02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:02.762
It is incredibly damning.

02:03:04.483 --> 02:03:06.265
This guy is especially bad.

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:10.808
This guy's especially bad to be in this particular group at this particular time.

02:03:11.229 --> 02:03:12.670
This is a panda person.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:22.746
the group that I presented to over six hours of presentations that one of their members, David Wiseman, called the best immunology lecture he'd ever seen.

02:03:22.786 --> 02:03:31.472
And none of those videos are available to the public because Panda has taken those ideas and made it their thing on X for the last three years.

02:03:32.673 --> 02:03:35.055
Yes, Nick Hudson is a traitor to America.

02:03:35.075 --> 02:03:36.536
He can't be a traitor to America.

02:03:36.556 --> 02:03:37.357
He's not American.

02:03:38.517 --> 02:03:39.458
He's just an enemy.

02:03:40.319 --> 02:03:43.041
He's a foreign meddler, enemy of America.

02:03:43.897 --> 02:03:45.218
As is this guy.

02:03:45.699 --> 02:03:48.761
And I'm sorry, but as apparently Mike Eden is.

02:03:50.202 --> 02:03:52.564
He is happy to be part of the controlled demolition.

02:03:52.604 --> 02:04:04.473
If you want to believe that that retired pharma guy doesn't know that DNA and RNA can't be made pure by pharmacological manufacturing methods, you can believe it, but that's bullshit.

02:04:05.033 --> 02:04:13.440
If you want to believe that coronaviruses are real and that PCR works and that the sequencing works, well then you can believe him and believe her and believe him.

02:04:14.773 --> 02:04:20.594
You know, the guy who was one of the biggest private donors to the Democratic National Committee before the pandemic.

02:04:21.294 --> 02:04:36.937
The guy who has a vaccine safety research foundation and said beyond a shadow of a doubt today on social media that autism was caused by vaccines and when that truth was revealed it was going to destroy the trust in the American government.

02:04:37.338 --> 02:04:39.038
He tweeted that on X today.

02:04:39.838 --> 02:04:41.759
This is a traitor to our grandkids.

02:04:42.099 --> 02:04:44.281
He is not a patriotic American.

02:04:44.321 --> 02:04:45.501
He is a saboteur.

02:04:47.603 --> 02:04:51.525
And I think if we knew the full extent to his participation, he would be in jail.

02:04:52.485 --> 02:05:03.472
Just like Robert Malone would probably be in jail, like Kevin McKernan would be in jail for the lies that they told through the pandemic where they could have saved hundreds of thousands of people from being injured.

02:05:04.913 --> 02:05:08.395
Hundreds of thousands of people from being killed in hospitals.

02:05:18.888 --> 02:05:20.249
These people were put in place.

02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:29.895
That's why they are all fine with Jessica Rose's five postdocs in five different fields being called post-secondary degrees.

02:05:30.095 --> 02:05:32.137
It's all a great big show.

02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:46.601
And as long as you don't see that Polly Tommy is part of the show, as long as you never see Brandy Vaughn for who she was and what she was teaching people and when she did it, you're never going to see through it.

02:05:46.661 --> 02:05:51.105
As long as you don't realize that this is just a recycled political stunt.

02:05:54.377 --> 02:06:09.525
then you're never gonna see through it, until you realize that Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy are in on it, and maybe even part of the apparatus that has been a Truman Show trap for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:11.006 --> 02:06:15.368
But honestly, I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr., like all of these people, is willing to look away.

02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:18.010
You don't have to tell me what's behind that curtain.

02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:18.670
I don't care.

02:06:18.690 --> 02:06:20.511
I just want more.

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:32.818
That's why this video exists.

02:06:34.618 --> 02:06:36.359
That's why she got on Joe Rogan.

02:06:36.419 --> 02:06:38.820
That's why Nicole Shanahan is promoting her.

02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:40.841
That's why Kim Iverson is promoting her.

02:06:41.281 --> 02:06:43.042
That's why Glenn Beck is promoting her.

02:06:43.442 --> 02:06:45.382
That's why Robert Malone is promoting her.

02:06:45.423 --> 02:06:47.783
That's why she's behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:06:47.964 --> 02:06:51.565
She is the same as Mary Holland and the same as Meryl Nass.

02:06:51.585 --> 02:06:54.126
They are saboteurs to America's future.

02:06:54.706 --> 02:06:56.567
They owe American kids.

02:06:57.467 --> 02:06:59.128
Oh my gosh, do they owe them.

02:07:05.964 --> 02:07:11.470
They were put in place to control the narrative so that transfection would never be blamed.

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.313
The word wouldn't even be used.

02:07:16.616 --> 02:07:23.883
No one would ever talk about the lack of antibiotics being a crime except for some mouse on social media and only for about a month.

02:07:24.504 --> 02:07:26.787
No one would talk about pure oxygen ever.

02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:40.033
Even though there's Pierre Cory and Kyle Seidel right there on the internet to remember how ridiculous it was that we were thinking pure oxygen might be something if your pulse ox is low since we're running out of ventilators.

02:07:40.814 --> 02:07:44.458
And Elon Musk can't make them fast enough in his converted Tesla factory.

02:07:46.377 --> 02:07:51.318
pure oxygen causes the same symptomology blamed on SARS-CoV-2.

02:07:52.018 --> 02:07:56.500
And in the hospitals in 2020 and 2021 in America, they were murdering people that way.

02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.540
I am sure of it.

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:00.561
And in Scotland, they were murdering people other ways.

02:08:01.121 --> 02:08:01.901
I am sure of it.

02:08:02.981 --> 02:08:05.102
In the UK, they were murdering people in other ways.

02:08:05.282 --> 02:08:06.102
I am sure of it.

02:08:08.063 --> 02:08:10.003
And none of these people are talking about it.

02:08:10.043 --> 02:08:13.184
Mike Eden's not talking about the murder in Scotland care homes.

02:08:14.656 --> 02:08:17.678
Mike Eden is promoting Sasha Latapova, the mother of Soph.

02:08:26.722 --> 02:08:33.205
PCR is not being discussed as the primary fraud because it's still being used.

02:08:33.266 --> 02:08:37.908
It's still providing the remnant stream that all these people agreed to allow forming.

02:08:39.482 --> 02:08:44.307
That's why none of them question it because that was one of the primary things to make sure that people accept.

02:08:44.607 --> 02:08:47.670
We're not even arguing about PCR anymore.

02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:51.614
We're arguing about the COVID shot and that is by design.

02:08:53.933 --> 02:08:55.794
because it's part of the Human Genome Project.

02:08:55.814 --> 02:09:06.520
That whole remnant stream is part of this whole stream of mentors, of actors, of people that understood the national security priority that the Human Genome Project was.

02:09:07.001 --> 02:09:17.787
And how impossible it would be to complete that dream without endless sampling from everybody that we could possibly get our hands on, because that's how AI is gonna do it.

02:09:17.887 --> 02:09:18.848
AI is gonna do it.

02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:31.277
That's why these people are promoting Andrew Wakefield still after all these years and have never told you that MMR is one of the only subcutaneous shots on the whole vaccine schedule.

02:09:32.798 --> 02:09:36.721
It's kind of irrelevant, I guess, to their whole story because it's about guts and stuff.

02:09:41.484 --> 02:09:43.225
It's about all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

02:09:43.245 --> 02:09:44.566
It's about the grandchildren of earth.

02:09:44.606 --> 02:09:47.368
And that's why there's a fake anti-vax movement behind this man.

02:09:48.414 --> 02:10:12.285
behind that lady and behind all of this show it's a fake anti-vax movement that also includes these people being bamboozled not everybody needs to be needs to know some people just can't figure it out because this guy and the guy with the orange glasses if they're lying together mary bowden doesn't stand a chance please make sure you share yesterday or friday's stream with mary if you haven't already because

02:10:12.765 --> 02:10:14.707
Nobody sees my social media accounts.

02:10:14.747 --> 02:10:15.727
They might see yours.

02:10:16.208 --> 02:10:18.289
So the more people that are on that, the better.

02:10:18.329 --> 02:10:21.392
The more times that we share it with her, the better.

02:10:22.313 --> 02:10:24.895
The bad biology is what allowed this to happen.

02:10:25.495 --> 02:10:26.876
We can think our way out of it, though.

02:10:26.896 --> 02:10:35.223
We can stop talking about the COVID shots and start talking about real DNA, real biology, real understanding

02:10:35.803 --> 02:10:37.744
A better way to move forward, New Biology 101.

02:10:39.224 --> 02:10:42.186
Ladies and gentlemen, they won't talk about ingestion versus injection.

02:10:43.346 --> 02:10:45.307
Brian Hooker used to, but he doesn't anymore.

02:10:46.207 --> 02:10:53.810
He knew Brian, Brandy Vaughn really well, but we don't mention her and we don't mention those ideas just like we don't mention intramuscular injection not being medicine.

02:10:54.671 --> 02:10:56.752
And it's not just these organizations.

02:10:57.372 --> 02:11:02.214
These organizations have planted people on social media.

02:11:03.595 --> 02:11:05.858
And those people are hiding this murder in lies.

02:11:05.918 --> 02:11:11.865
Those people are behind the bamboozlement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the using of him and his ambitions.

02:11:12.626 --> 02:11:23.358
To their ends, they have created an illusion of consensus about something that did not happen because it is just a background being misconstrued as spread using nonspecific tests.

02:11:23.959 --> 02:11:27.000
Please understand they got away with this by using placebo.

02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:30.902
And using their tests to find their ghost doesn't make you a ghost buster.

02:11:30.942 --> 02:11:32.903
And it doesn't make their ghost real either.

02:11:32.963 --> 02:11:34.463
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

02:11:35.243 --> 02:11:37.885
Intramuscular injection is not medicine.

02:11:38.545 --> 02:11:39.645
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:11:39.685 --> 02:11:41.726
It was always transfection and transformation.

02:11:41.746 --> 02:11:45.708
The population pyramids is a real problem that they are managing.

02:11:46.288 --> 02:11:47.428
Thank you very much for being here.

02:11:47.949 --> 02:11:48.809
I'll see you again soon.

02:11:50.342 --> 02:11:51.122
Is that not working?

02:11:51.342 --> 02:11:52.623
Oh man, darn it.

02:11:52.643 --> 02:11:54.163
I'm going to do this again.

02:11:54.703 --> 02:11:55.084
My bad.

02:11:56.724 --> 02:11:57.424
Thanks for being here.

02:11:57.464 --> 02:12:01.486
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:12:01.706 --> 02:12:02.606
You can capture it.

02:12:02.666 --> 02:12:03.566
You can sequence it.

02:12:03.586 --> 02:12:05.787
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:12:09.591 --> 02:12:10.812
I always blow it on that.

02:12:10.852 --> 02:12:12.454
Sorry if I blew out everybody's ears.

02:12:12.494 --> 02:12:13.655
Thank you very much for being here.

02:12:13.695 --> 02:12:18.119
If you wanna find a way to support the stream, please go to gigaohmbiological.com.

02:12:18.159 --> 02:12:21.081
If you're gonna share it, please share it from stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:12:21.562 --> 02:12:24.525
And I will definitely see you all tomorrow.

02:12:24.585 --> 02:12:25.646
That'll be for sure.

02:12:25.726 --> 02:12:26.807
Thank you very much for being here.

02:12:27.067 --> 02:12:27.848
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

02:12:47.042 --> 02:12:48.482
Thank you very much for being here, everybody.

02:12:48.502 --> 02:12:51.744
And I will see you tomorrow, same time.

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.905
I'll try to be 1010, but I don't know how it's going to go.

02:12:55.385 --> 02:12:57.005
Tomorrow, we're going to talk about autism.

02:12:57.205 --> 02:12:59.086
We're going to talk about the myth of autism.

02:12:59.106 --> 02:12:59.986
We're going to define it.

02:13:00.467 --> 02:13:01.887
We're going to do some reading together.

02:13:02.787 --> 02:13:08.369
And we're going to listen to Peter McCullough talk about how he understands what autism is and what it is.

02:13:08.389 --> 02:13:10.090
He's going to give us his best estimate.

02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:12.411
And I think we'll have a lot of fun.

02:13:14.652 --> 02:13:15.893
We can see the dog tomorrow.

02:13:15.994 --> 02:13:18.136
If you remind me again, I'll have him brought down.

02:13:18.236 --> 02:13:22.121
Thank you very much for being here everybody and I will see you again tomorrow.

02:13:22.181 --> 02:13:22.861
Thank you very much.

02:13:38.749 --> 02:13:42.575
Hey, beesbees7, I guess, is my wife.

02:13:42.615 --> 02:13:45.119
I always forget that, that she's actually in the chat.

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:47.683
That's dope.

02:13:47.783 --> 02:13:48.724
Thank you very much, guys.

02:13:49.746 --> 02:13:50.127
See you soon.
