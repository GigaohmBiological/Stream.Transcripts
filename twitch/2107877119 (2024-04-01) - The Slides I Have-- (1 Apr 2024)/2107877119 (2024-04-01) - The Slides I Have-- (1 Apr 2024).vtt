WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
and I don't know, I had to get also YouTube set up again

00:03.000 --> 00:05.480
and then I tried to do one more trick

00:05.480 --> 00:07.360
and then I had to add one more video

00:07.360 --> 00:09.800
if you can possibly imagine,

00:09.800 --> 00:12.240
I needed to add one more video to the slide set

00:12.240 --> 00:14.120
that I said I was already done with.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.480
She many Christmas, here we go, I'm getting it going,

00:18.480 --> 00:19.320
here we go.

00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going

01:00.000 --> 01:30.000
to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going

01:30.000 --> 02:00.000
to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick and then I'm going to do one more trick

02:00.000 --> 02:03.680
Everybody that feels here, that's not the way I feel.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.680
This episode is sponsored by Moink.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.360
That's Mu plus flank.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.200
Muah.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.960
But you can tell if someone's lying.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.080
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.480
And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.680
I don't want to lie.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.160
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.240
I try not to be a liar.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.640
I don't want to be a liar.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.640
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.920
Okay, great.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.840
That's a good one to check right now.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.640
Of course, hello.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.600
Let's get a camera in focus before we try to use it, shall we?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.280
Let's try that one out here.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.160
Let's get this into focus on the little...

03:01.680 --> 03:03.520
I'm a hood here, all right.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.960
That should work.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.200
And now if you can give me a sound check,

03:07.200 --> 03:09.680
also, sorry about that.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.640
You know, this thing, you gotta be doing it every day

03:12.640 --> 03:17.120
or it doesn't go all good, perfect place for a laugh track.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.080
Everybody is still following along.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.520
Then, yeah, try and push some people

03:23.520 --> 03:25.960
in the direction they should be moving.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.640
That's what we're gonna try and do from now on.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.200
We're just gonna try and push people

03:29.200 --> 03:31.160
in the direction they should be moving.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.000
That's my plan.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.880
It's hard to tune the sound down that bird

03:52.880 --> 03:57.880
because it's so sharp in one single frequency band there.

03:58.720 --> 03:59.720
That's better.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.120
I just got my monitors in my ears.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.400
I apologize for that.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.680
We are gonna have a little new music

04:17.680 --> 04:22.680
that's probably gonna bounce this beginning off.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.840
We're gonna go back to Easter when I was about 12 years old.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.360
This album was in my Easter basket.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.000
Whoops.

04:43.840 --> 04:47.240
Darn it, I blew that song, darn it.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.800
But anyway, you get the idea.

04:52.880 --> 04:53.880
Let's go.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.120
I get up.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.760
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.280
This is Giga Home Biological,

05:11.280 --> 05:13.440
a high-resistance Low Noise Information Brief

05:13.440 --> 05:14.800
brought to you by a biologist.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.240
If you're here for the first time,

05:16.240 --> 05:20.000
you might be a skilled TV watcher trapped in social media.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.200
If you've been here for a while,

05:21.280 --> 05:22.280
we're at the top of the wave

05:22.280 --> 05:23.880
where we stay focused on the biology.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.040
We don't take their bait on TV,

05:26.040 --> 05:27.560
and we love our neighbors.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.360
I'm not talking about jumping species,

05:32.360 --> 05:34.280
but you guys are just very funny.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.840
You can find me at gigahomebiological.com

05:42.320 --> 05:45.480
and gigahome.bio, where we try to communicate

05:45.480 --> 05:48.360
with one another and scream.gigahome.bios,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.040
where you should be watching this right now,

05:50.040 --> 05:51.640
so you can listen to the music,

05:54.120 --> 05:57.280
because it'll get bounced on every other platform, of course.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
I have a mini keyboard in front of me to play, like,

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
stupid things, you know, like...

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
I've been goofing around with that all the time

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
in the background,

08:59.040 --> 09:02.040
and now I've been pricing full-size keyboards

09:02.040 --> 09:05.040
because of listening to old music

09:05.040 --> 09:08.040
and playing old songs with my daughters,

09:08.040 --> 09:11.040
and I've been playing old songs with my daughters,

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
and I've been playing with my daughters,

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
and I've been playing with my daughters,

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
and I've been playing with my daughters,

09:17.040 --> 09:20.040
and I've been playing old songs with my daughters.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.040
It's amazing how many things are still

09:22.040 --> 09:25.040
in my fingers or in my cerebellum, I guess.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
All kinds of songs.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.040
I learned Star Wars once on the piano

09:30.040 --> 09:31.040
and can totally play it.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
It just kind of came out of me yesterday.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
And another one that came out of me was...

09:42.040 --> 09:45.040
And so I was upstairs late,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
three in the morning a couple of days ago,

09:47.040 --> 09:50.040
retrying to relearn that song.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.040
And so then I was also listening to it,

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
and it was just...

09:53.040 --> 09:56.040
Yeah, anyway, keyboards are expensive, though,

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
so that's a little bit something I got to put...

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
put some feelers out there on Craigslist.

10:01.040 --> 10:04.040
If anybody's got a Nord 3 compact

10:04.040 --> 10:06.040
or something like that laying around in the closet,

10:06.040 --> 10:07.040
they want to send me.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.040
I'd be happy to take it.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.040
But for now, I'm just going to work with the piano

10:11.040 --> 10:13.040
that we have a little Casio keyboard

10:13.040 --> 10:16.040
that's got weighted keys upstairs for my daughter.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.040
I think I got that for $100 on Craigslist,

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
and that's a pretty decent thing to practice on,

10:21.040 --> 10:24.040
and for the stream, I don't need anything in front of me right now

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
to distract me.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.040
welcome to Giga Ohm Biological, High Resistance.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
Hello, noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.040
My name is Jonathan Cooey.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.040
I am that biologist coming to you live from Pittsburgh,

10:35.040 --> 10:36.040
Pennsylvania.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.040
This is the back of my garage.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
It's April 1st.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.040
It doesn't really mean much to me.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.040
I've never really been a big April 1st guy.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.040
It always seems like kind of a weird,

10:48.040 --> 10:50.040
I don't know.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
It just seemed like always an odd holiday.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.040
And I always, I never really understood it.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
I understand why people get into it.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
I guess you get to mess with people or something.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
I don't know.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.040
But for me,

11:03.040 --> 11:08.040
I don't know how to say it any other way,

11:08.040 --> 11:11.040
but I've been lied to way too often in my life

11:11.040 --> 11:16.040
from a very young age to find lying of really any kind funny.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.040
In fact, I think Mark kind of feels the same way.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
I know my wife can't even lie.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.040
That's her problem is that she can't even lie to, you know,

11:24.040 --> 11:29.040
something like, Oh, I didn't see that the coupon was expired.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
I'm sorry.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.040
You know, she can't even tell a lie like that.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
So when Mark and I did that stream a long time ago,

11:35.040 --> 11:38.040
where we were both wearing sunglasses and kind of making fun of other

11:38.040 --> 11:44.040
people on the internet by our, by wearing a disguise and pretending we weren't who we were,

11:44.040 --> 11:46.040
we already didn't like that.

11:46.040 --> 11:51.040
And we've, I've talked with other people about, you know,

11:51.040 --> 11:54.040
ways that we could catch people if we just, you know,

11:54.040 --> 12:00.040
maybe we should just fake like we're having an argument or maybe I should pretend that I'm skeptical of you.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.040
And then maybe we'll see what people do.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.040
And it, it always feels wrong because.

12:07.040 --> 12:12.040
I feel like I'm, I'm not, I'm not going on stage here.

12:12.040 --> 12:22.040
I'm making a phone call or I'm stepping in front of a, I don't like classroom because it implies some hierarchy.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.040
But imagine it's an open mic.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.040
Which it kind of is anytime I want to, I can push that button and, and, and I'm on.

12:30.040 --> 12:39.040
And if I do the right cut and paste and everything, I'll be on on, on like four different, four different platforms live.

12:39.040 --> 12:49.040
So it's kind of like a, it's like a live microphone just standing here in the back of my house whenever I decide to push the button, it'll be on.

12:49.040 --> 12:59.040
And you might think some people might think or want you to believe that that's some kind of easy thing to just step in front of and do, but it's not.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.040
And like it or not.

13:03.040 --> 13:17.040
There are people who are doing it because they're paid to do it because they're part of a, a, a concerted effort, an intelligent manipulation of your habits and your opinions.

13:17.040 --> 13:22.040
And you cannot underestimate how many people are not like me.

13:22.040 --> 13:34.040
And I don't want to toot my own horn, but at some point in order for my family to eat and for our rent to get paid, I have to toot my own horn. I don't have a sponsor. I don't have a toothpaste.

13:34.040 --> 13:40.040
I'm not asking you to buy somebody's mail in meat.

13:41.040 --> 13:54.040
I've had jobs working for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Children's Health Defense, but by sticking to my integrity and my principles, I've lost those positions, those positions have been ended.

13:54.040 --> 14:08.040
But you can look it up, you can see the videos that I've done, you can find the things that have been said about me, you can find that book and read what I say in that book what's quoted of me in that book, you can find a track record that.

14:08.040 --> 14:13.040
If I do say so myself is unblemished.

14:13.040 --> 14:22.040
Because when I've gotten things wrong, I've admitted it when I've been questioning things I've, I've let everyone know.

14:22.040 --> 14:42.040
I've tried desperately to convey a level of uncertainty in the story that's on television and the story that's on social media and a certainty about the sacred biology that makes me feel good about the skepticism of the mainstream narrative.

14:42.040 --> 14:50.040
And these people have been doing it for decades. This is a quote from 1924.

14:50.040 --> 15:00.040
For the advent of all of these nasty things that we allow to occupy any of our attention.

15:00.040 --> 15:11.040
The tagline on giggleonbiological.com your consciousness is prime real estate is not a joke your attention is prime real estate.

15:11.040 --> 15:24.040
If you have only 15 thoughts in a day think about this for a second if you only have 15 thoughts in a day and Twitter can occupy 14 of them how much are you going to get done.

15:24.040 --> 15:31.040
Now the math is a little bit more complicated than that you have about 39,000 thoughts a day.

15:32.040 --> 15:47.040
But every time you pick up your phone every time you click on that site every time you hit the scroll wheel you are allowing allowing some of those thoughts to be wasted and occupied by the spinning of a wheel.

15:47.040 --> 16:05.040
That wheel is not random it is a it is a wheel which has been finely tuned to manipulate your conscious and intelligent habits and opinions.

16:05.040 --> 16:19.040
The principle of informed consent has been ignored for years and years and years and how it will continue to be ignored until each and every one of us makes a conscious effort to wake up young people.

16:19.040 --> 16:28.040
The terrifying conclusion that I've come to over the Easter weekend taking a pause from this trying to step back a little bit from this open mic.

16:28.040 --> 16:39.040
If you think about what I really want to accomplish in 2024, it is to lay the groundwork of inspiration for the next generation because that's all we've got.

16:39.040 --> 16:48.040
We are up against not billionaires but trillionaires as Thomas Binder said so wisely on my in my interview with him a few days ago.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.040
If you haven't seen it please watch it.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.040
The trillionaires are out there.

16:55.040 --> 17:04.040
The trillionaires is the table that we need to be worried about the people that are really just absolutely separate from us.

17:04.040 --> 17:19.040
And we are not going to come out from under the yoke of trillionaires over the over the course of a podcast or over the course of a couple election cycles that's not how this is going to happen.

17:19.040 --> 17:35.040
How it's going to happen is that the next generation is more skeptical of this mythology than our generation was able to muster so that their kids can break free.

17:35.040 --> 17:47.040
I think what we're looking at here I think if we want to be realistic we need to really that that will require us then to all let go a little bit.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.040
And to surrender.

17:51.040 --> 17:56.040
I've got to be a leaf in the stream so to speak.

17:56.040 --> 18:07.040
I've been thinking all the time that there's just one more podcast just one if I just get all the words right or if I just write that one sub stack.

18:07.040 --> 18:16.040
It's not going to be one person it's not going to be one piece of prose it's not going to be one advertisement on the Super Bowl.

18:16.040 --> 18:38.040
One generation after the next generation after the next generation constantly fighting for the sacred of biology the sacred of who we are as people as a species as a member of our ecosystem on this little rock.

18:38.040 --> 18:45.040
Now the situation is what you see in this cartoon here over here here here.

18:45.040 --> 18:58.040
It's a bunch of people unhealthy on the couch surrendering their conscious attention to screens including now what you're doing.

18:58.040 --> 19:11.040
Well because I'm live because I'm talking to you because I can read the chat there's more than that going on here it might be the only way that enough people can come together in the quickest time.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.040
So that it could be less than a generation that we turn this around.

19:15.040 --> 19:23.040
It's possible, but we're going to have to believe in power is much bigger than us.

19:23.040 --> 19:34.040
We're going to have to turn to a few of the things that you know when people are really in this deep that generally speaking turn to prayer.

19:34.040 --> 19:44.040
And we're all going to have to come to terms with the fact that this is a spiritual battle unfortunately as much as I want it to be about biology.

19:44.040 --> 19:50.040
And as much as I'm interested in the biology this is a spiritual battle.

19:50.040 --> 20:02.040
Because that's what that sacred biology that irreducible complexity that beauty that you can see or you can't see when you look out your window.

20:03.040 --> 20:16.040
That's that's what we're trying to restore in our children their ability to see that to see themselves in the mirror as the sacred beings they are the see the world as the sacred place that it is.

20:16.040 --> 20:23.040
Something that we were given stewardship over instead of dominion.

20:23.040 --> 20:28.040
And so it's tough we got a long road ahead of us it's April 1, 2024.

20:28.040 --> 20:36.040
And my plan is to raise enough money with this stream and teaching biology on this stream to feed my family.

20:36.040 --> 20:50.040
I don't know if that's a realistic perspective to take right now it's not right now I have about 120 subscribers and that amounts to about 100 $1,200 a month, which doesn't even cover half of our rent.

20:51.040 --> 20:59.040
And so we've got savings for about a month and a half and then we're going to have to find another plan and we're always looking for another plan.

20:59.040 --> 21:05.040
But in the coming weeks I need you to pay very close attention to the landmarks that we hit.

21:05.040 --> 21:15.040
I need you to pay very close attention to the kinds of output that we put out and I need you to pay very close attention to what other people are doing.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.040
And then you can see the pattern.

21:18.040 --> 21:29.040
Then you will be able to see the pattern and behavior that will allow you to act appropriately to set your mind appropriately.

21:29.040 --> 21:36.040
And I hope that enough people will then decide that my stream is the one that's worth sharing.

21:36.040 --> 21:46.040
The one that is worth promoting when they promote something on Facebook or promote something on wherever they promote it they'll promote GIGO.

21:46.040 --> 21:56.040
That's where we need to get. We need to get to 10,000 views or a hundred thousand views and a thousand subscribers that's it a thousand paid subscribers.

21:56.040 --> 22:02.040
And I will put on a few hours every day for the rest of my life.

22:02.040 --> 22:11.040
And that's not a small promise it's a big promise because three hours a day every day would be a lot of work.

22:11.040 --> 22:20.040
But that's what I'm going for because I think that's the only way that we get we got to get lots of lights like this lots of bonfires burning in the wilderness.

22:21.040 --> 22:29.040
We'll get us out of this and GIGO is going to be one of those bonfires and you know a couple other fires that are burning right now that need your support.

22:29.040 --> 22:37.040
And you know a lot of other fires that are burning wildly because of the amount of support that they get that are doing nothing.

22:38.040 --> 22:46.040
They're burning in the middle of a concrete parking lot doing nothing but consuming.

22:46.040 --> 22:56.040
People's hard earned money being wasted by Steve Kirsch's Vaccine Safety Research Foundation. What a joke.

22:57.040 --> 23:05.040
Think about how much money is being wasted there right alongside the skull foundation that donates to them and PBS NewsHour.

23:08.040 --> 23:18.040
Once you start to really realize how much hard earned working persons working families money is being burnt up by these people.

23:19.040 --> 23:26.040
Who pay themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars a year give themselves wonderful insurance.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.040
And then what do they do really?

23:29.040 --> 23:32.040
What are the results of their work?

23:37.040 --> 23:45.040
It's frustrating because all of these people are united in the same lie they are united in the same story.

23:46.040 --> 23:57.040
And it's frustrating because like a corporate tug of war it doesn't take that many people to fake it to sabotage the whole team.

23:57.040 --> 24:11.040
And so we are in a situation where there could be many people, many many people who mean well who are still stuck halfway between Scooby-Doo and the magic show audience.

24:12.040 --> 24:20.040
Not sure who to trust because I saw him come out of the audience but I guess it seems weird that he's on stage.

24:20.040 --> 24:25.040
But they still can't quite pull their head out of this illusion of consensus.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.040
And so we've got to keep hammering one by one. We're going to pull people out of this theater.

24:32.040 --> 24:39.040
We're going to make people realize that the people that the magician pulled on stage from the audience were all in on it.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.040
And that's why they agree even when they come off stage and sit back down.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.040
They agree. Wow, that's just crazy. I can't believe it.

24:50.040 --> 25:01.040
And so this ongoing RNA pandemic has essentially become a faith in a novel virus that none of them will question all of them seek reinforcement of.

25:02.040 --> 25:09.040
They'll say, but you also got sick, right? You also remember using Ivermectin and having your ears pop, don't you?

25:12.040 --> 25:22.040
That's what's happening here is this faith in a novel virus has continued to be groomed into everyone's head for five years.

25:23.040 --> 25:27.040
While these people pretend to try and do something about it,

25:27.040 --> 25:31.040
but they're not doing anything about the faith in this novel biology.

25:31.040 --> 25:40.040
No one's questioning how an RNA might be able to go from being a few molecules in a market to being a few trillion,

25:40.040 --> 25:47.040
but Godzilla molecules in every lung in America is now in what did we hear recently?

25:47.040 --> 25:55.040
We're constantly fish in Wisconsin. The walleye or something have coronaviruses that right now don't infect humans.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.040
Really?

25:58.040 --> 26:04.040
And we're still talking. We're still talking about the heroes that found out about the fear and cleavage site.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.040
You know, like James Lyons Weiler.

26:06.040 --> 26:20.040
Or, or, or Dan Saratkin, son of Carl Saratkin at Los Alamos laboratories working on sequencing algorithms.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.040
Yeah. Okay. That makes sense.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.040
Who else you knew about the fear and cleavage site and talked about it?

26:27.040 --> 26:29.040
Oh, some Australian guy.

26:29.040 --> 26:33.040
And, uh, I don't know, a few other people.

26:33.040 --> 26:40.040
Yuri Dagan, some Russian living in Canada working on longevity. Sure. That makes total sense. Why not?

26:45.040 --> 26:56.040
That's where we are. We are chasing a faith in a novel biology and we have a whole bunch of what amount to street preachers on the Internet.

26:56.040 --> 27:00.040
Also with open mics.

27:00.040 --> 27:13.040
But instead of claiming uncertainty and fighting against a narrative which is being given to us by governments all around the world, instead of fighting against it, they are essentially fortifying.

27:13.040 --> 27:24.040
They are essentially providing narrative cover and plausible deniability to all of these, these state actors and non government actors.

27:25.040 --> 27:33.040
Who have purported to save us from the worst case scenario. Get cover from these people.

27:33.040 --> 27:53.040
Because the only place to go outside of this faith in a novel biology is these, these other alternative interpretations of it, which tend to be closer to a worst case scenario, which will push people back to the original place that they're supposed to be.

27:53.040 --> 28:01.040
That's how the game has been played from the very beginning. Unfortunately, I was a ping pong ball on their table.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.040
And I didn't know it.

28:03.040 --> 28:12.040
Even after I thought, hey, why, why did you hit me with that paddle? I still didn't understand it. And then I saw the net go underneath me and I, my face hit the table.

28:12.040 --> 28:19.040
And then another paddle hit me. And I looked at that other person. I was like, why did you hit me with that paddle? I trusted you.

28:19.040 --> 28:29.040
And then I tumbled over the net again and landed on the other side and bang, I got hit in the back of the head and I looked around like, what did you hit me for?

28:29.040 --> 28:37.040
And it took me about four or five points before I realized, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm the ping pong ball here.

28:37.040 --> 28:44.040
And unfortunately, there are a lot of people who are still being played.

28:44.040 --> 28:55.040
And instead of reacting to the people that are holding that paddle, they're trying to participate in influencing the game, I guess, or something.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.040
They have no idea how they have been used.

29:00.040 --> 29:17.040
But I need, we need progress in understanding this as a faith. And I think one of the best ways to hit at this as a faith is to understand that the faith is based on data of which we have none before 2020.

29:18.040 --> 29:24.040
It is equivalent to saying that we had no cars before 2020.

29:24.040 --> 29:29.040
And then just stick into that lie like nobody's business.

29:29.040 --> 29:39.040
Go on TV and you say, well, people think that we had cars, but those weren't really cars. They were, they were something else. What we have now in our garage, our cars.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.040
And you can test for cars with these new tests that we have.

29:44.040 --> 29:52.040
Yeah, but I mean, we don't have any data to show these tests don't mean that the cars weren't there before. Yes, they do. The tests show.

29:52.040 --> 30:04.040
These sequences demonstrate that these sequences couldn't have been found before, but no, they don't because the cars were could have been in our garage before. You just never told us to look.

30:05.040 --> 30:27.040
And while that analogy may seem a little bit weak, it's actually perfect because the amount of data that we've been told there are millions and millions of sequences, which represent just a small fraction of the total number of sequences that could be in theory available if we were to measure all of them.

30:27.040 --> 30:33.040
Implying that all of those sequences started from a point in Woola.

30:33.040 --> 30:40.040
Maybe it was in October of 2019, but they lied about when they covered it up for a little while.

30:40.040 --> 30:47.040
Well, Michael Callahan was running around in the behind the scenes, texting with Robert Malone.

30:47.040 --> 31:05.040
But essentially it all started in sometime in 2019. And now we have this, you know, blanket of genetic information, which covers the globe and is in the, in the mucosa of almost every mammal that we've tested.

31:05.040 --> 31:12.040
That is a faith in a biological phenomenon that can only be a lie.

31:12.040 --> 31:31.040
It is very much equivalent to them having told us that there were no cars before 2020. And now there's a new car and we can find it in almost every garage that we test.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.040
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to understand it for what it is.

31:35.040 --> 31:43.040
It is a lie. It is a lie that they agreed to tell from very early on because worst case scenario is worst case scenario.

31:43.040 --> 31:59.040
And so like event 201 drilled, like dark winter drilled like the sparse pandemic document describes like all of these previous tabletop exercise described a faith is required.

31:59.040 --> 32:20.040
And never in history did they have the level of control over media and control over what people saw than they did when they declared a 1530 day lockdown and school closure.

32:20.040 --> 32:27.040
And because the faith is a lie staging the pandemic required murder.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.040
I know people don't like me to use that word.

32:30.040 --> 32:37.040
People tell me that I'm going to lose support if I keep using that word murder don't call it murder.

32:37.040 --> 32:40.040
What is it then?

32:40.040 --> 32:56.040
What is it if people decide that we need to get rid of a few people because Medicare costs are going to become too drastic and we're going to tell people that there is a virus spreading because we also can use that narrative to do a lot of things that we've

32:56.040 --> 33:01.040
wanted to do for a while.

33:01.040 --> 33:08.040
And so we're going to get like four birds with one stone we're going to get rid of this impending Medicare Medicaid doom.

33:08.040 --> 33:16.040
We're going to seed an untouchable pandemic narrative that we have complete control over without having to do anything really.

33:16.040 --> 33:25.040
We're going to use it to attack China with a with a with a campaign of lies but then we're going to turn around and actually use it to attack our own citizens.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.040
Because that's what we really want to do.

33:28.040 --> 33:34.040
We want to undermine the last bastion of a republic in the world the United States of America.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.040
And we're cooperating with people who are interested in doing that.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.040
Who would that be?

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
Well, it would be billionaires.

33:41.040 --> 33:44.040
It would be trillionaires.

33:44.040 --> 33:51.040
And that's the insight that I think Thomas Binder really brought out in some of the more.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.040
Let's say home run parts of his talk.

33:55.040 --> 33:59.040
The beauty of that is that there really is.

33:59.040 --> 34:07.040
There really are rather people in the world who think of us as different think of us as cattle and don't have any problem.

34:07.040 --> 34:17.040
Staging an operation in order to govern us just like they staged the operation on 9 11.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.040
They don't have any problem with that.

34:21.040 --> 34:26.040
And now if you think the truth is available on television with regard to the Middle East.

34:26.040 --> 34:38.040
You're again buying into the same kind of mythology the same governing mechanism that was first described by Edward Bernays in that beautiful book propaganda.

34:38.040 --> 34:42.040
It is a conscious and intelligent manipulation of our opinions and habits.

34:42.040 --> 34:45.040
What better way to do it.

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
Then full on staging. What is history.

34:49.040 --> 34:59.040
And then having us run around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to figure out what just happened when we're the whole world is a stage.

34:59.040 --> 35:04.040
And they are performing a theater in order for us to be governed by it.

35:04.040 --> 35:08.040
And so by debating the theater, we have been scooby-doo.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.040
We've been fooled into solving a mystery.

35:10.040 --> 35:15.040
We've been fooled into unmasking the very bad guys that they wanted us to unmask in the first time.

35:15.040 --> 35:20.040
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

35:20.040 --> 35:24.040
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie.

35:24.040 --> 35:28.040
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

35:28.040 --> 35:34.040
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

35:34.040 --> 35:38.040
He's a liar.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.040
And we are governed by liars.

35:41.040 --> 35:47.040
You want to call it top secret. You want to call it classified information. You want to call it being read in.

35:47.040 --> 35:57.040
You want to call it the look away doctor and you call whatever you want.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.040
But that's how they got us.

35:59.040 --> 36:07.040
And there are people in front of us elevated on social media artificially by simply programming it right in.

36:07.040 --> 36:12.040
In order to make sure that we stay trapped within a limited spectrum of debate,

36:12.040 --> 36:16.040
which will not allow us to escape, which will not allow our children to escape.

36:16.040 --> 36:21.040
And we need to resist that.

36:21.040 --> 36:25.040
Scientific questions, I think, are very hard to get a handle on.

36:25.040 --> 36:31.040
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in,

36:32.040 --> 36:37.040
there's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it.

36:37.040 --> 36:43.040
And so in this world of extreme hyper specialization,

36:43.040 --> 36:48.040
where it's narrower and narrower subsets of experts policing themselves

36:48.040 --> 36:52.040
and talking about how great they are, the string theorists talking about how great string theory is,

36:52.040 --> 36:55.040
the cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer,

36:55.040 --> 36:59.040
the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum computer

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
that will be a massive breakthrough.

37:01.040 --> 37:04.040
And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening,

37:04.040 --> 37:06.040
people just don't have the authority for this.

37:06.040 --> 37:11.040
And this is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge

37:11.040 --> 37:15.040
than you would have had in 1800 or even in 1900.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.040
In 1800, Goethe could still understand just about everything.

37:18.040 --> 37:23.040
1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics.

37:23.040 --> 37:31.040
And so the sort of specialization, I think, has made it a much harder question to get a handle on.

37:31.040 --> 37:35.040
So the reason why I keep playing this video over and over again

37:35.040 --> 37:40.040
is because I wanted to sink into all of my dedicated followers and watchers

37:40.040 --> 37:43.040
that this is a lie.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.040
That's why I keep those big words over there.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.040
He's misleading the young with this statement because he starts out by saying

37:50.040 --> 37:56.040
there's so much knowledge, there's too much knowledge for anybody to understand it all.

37:56.040 --> 38:00.040
And I would just flat out disagree with that.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.040
I don't think that's realistic.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
I don't think that's where we are.

38:05.040 --> 38:11.040
I don't think that no, I don't believe that.

38:11.040 --> 38:15.040
You want to hear an incredible story of learning?

38:15.040 --> 38:20.040
Go listen to Maya Angelou describe what happened to her

38:20.040 --> 38:25.040
after she was raped when she was seven years old and stopped talking for five years.

38:25.040 --> 38:30.040
And why she is and became who she was.

38:30.040 --> 38:42.040
The human mind is capable of amazing, unbelievable feats that are virtually untapped in our culture.

38:42.040 --> 38:49.040
One of the reasons why I so desperately want this giga-owned biological thing to work out is because if it does work out,

38:49.040 --> 38:52.040
we will be homeschooling our children.

38:52.040 --> 38:58.040
And I want that more than anything except for wanting to coach basketball,

38:58.040 --> 39:03.040
which I want to do more than anything else in the world now.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.040
I have things that I want to do.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.040
I have ideas of where I want to go.

39:08.040 --> 39:14.040
I have lots of things to teach every year to high schoolers, every year to adults, every year.

39:14.040 --> 39:28.040
And I'm ready to do it for the rest of my life because people like this are misleading our young people into believing what is created in universities is knowledge rather than noise.

39:28.040 --> 39:32.040
And this illusion needs to be broken.

39:32.040 --> 39:49.040
And I think one of the ways, one of the ways that one of the ways that we might be able to win is if we could encourage young people to skip out on college for five years until the university system itself just collapses.

39:49.040 --> 39:50.040
I don't know what they will do.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.040
That's the problem.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.040
I don't know where to send them.

39:52.040 --> 39:55.040
I don't know what for them to do.

39:55.040 --> 40:03.040
Get a job at a restaurant close to a beach and take up surfing for five years would be great if I could get them all to do that.

40:03.040 --> 40:13.040
I don't think that's a realistic goal, but get them to find part time jobs, full time jobs, live with their parents, take care of their parents, something.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.040
Don't go to university.

40:16.040 --> 40:21.040
Don't spend your parents money on university and even worse.

40:21.040 --> 40:27.040
Don't take out government funded 8% student loans to go to university.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.040
Just stop.

40:30.040 --> 40:36.040
And very quickly, this noise factory, this ivory tower will collapse.

40:36.040 --> 40:43.040
And if it doesn't, and listen carefully, if it doesn't, then the illusion will be shattered.

40:43.040 --> 40:59.040
You'll find out exactly what universities are, which are a giant pile of overpaid bureaucrats that are using faculty and students as cattle and slavery.

40:59.040 --> 41:12.040
Then at the same time, allowing the system to turn and eat those very cattle for dinner and confuse them of being the irresponsible ones for taking out student loans and going to college.

41:12.040 --> 41:16.040
And wow, now you want assistance with them. That's pretty pathetic.

41:16.040 --> 41:26.040
While they pay deans, as much as they pay football coaches and both of which are way overpaid.

41:26.040 --> 41:31.040
I coach a college basketball team for $100,000 a year.

41:31.040 --> 41:43.040
And I would teach a biology class at the same university. How's that for a bargain based offer? Maybe I can get a job at Duke.

41:43.040 --> 41:51.040
So the problem with this lie about what knowledge is and how knowledge is created.

41:51.040 --> 42:01.040
Is coupled with the fact that he's also totally okay with telling the truth about it, which is that this hyper specialization.

42:01.040 --> 42:05.040
It's not the hyper specialization.

42:05.040 --> 42:15.040
It's the lack of accountability for for models of reality that don't make predictions that come true.

42:15.040 --> 42:32.040
And we've allowed university biology departments, university, neurobiology departments, university medical school faculty to get away with essentially not creating knowledge, but creating noise by doing this p value ritual

42:32.040 --> 42:38.040
and disproving null hypotheses all day.

42:38.040 --> 42:47.040
And he knows that he could he could explain that, but he doesn't. He calls it knowledge and says there's too much.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.040
And that's just not true.

42:49.040 --> 42:53.040
There are details, of course, that we can't all know.

42:53.040 --> 42:58.040
But the big truths of physics, the big truths of biology, the big truth.

42:58.040 --> 43:06.040
If if quantum physics isn't making any progress as he just hinted, then what does it matter if I don't understand it?

43:06.040 --> 43:18.040
If quantum physics can't make useful predictions about future measurements, then what does it matter if I don't understand the subtleties of that model.

43:18.040 --> 43:26.040
If string theory doesn't help us by making predictions, then what does it matter if I don't understand the math of it.

43:26.040 --> 43:29.040
And there's the heart of the lie.

43:29.040 --> 43:35.040
It's an enchantment.

43:35.040 --> 43:45.040
The political cut I have on the specialization is always that that if you analyze the politics of science, the specializations should make you suspicious.

43:45.040 --> 43:52.040
It's because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, and it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

43:52.040 --> 43:58.040
And then one should be a little bit suspicious and that's that's sort of my starting my starting bias.

43:58.040 --> 44:08.040
The really weird part that I find about the pandemic and everything is that even if I play this, and I explain what it means.

44:08.040 --> 44:25.040
And I ask somebody or anyone to apply this thinking to bio security apply this thinking to bioterrorism apply this thinking to bio weapons as an idea, a concept of potential.

44:25.040 --> 44:36.040
I understand that they have a very vested interest in exaggerating and lying about that potential.

44:36.040 --> 44:47.040
And then apply that thinking to the beginning of the pandemic and realize that you now have a very plausible reason why every government in the Western English speaking world agreed.

44:47.040 --> 44:56.040
Use the same words wanted the same impression to be applied implied to every listener.

44:56.040 --> 45:09.040
A very effective lockdown is effective masks and the need to protect everybody from a universal vulnerability to a novel pathogen.

45:09.040 --> 45:15.040
Why in the world would it be crazy to be skeptical of that huge claim.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.040
Apparently he's not skeptical of it though.

45:18.040 --> 45:22.040
The guy that he's talking to Eric Weinstein isn't skeptical of it.

45:22.040 --> 45:31.040
Remember that Peter Teal is the behind Eric Weinstein is behind the intellectual dark web.

45:31.040 --> 45:37.040
People like Shapiro and and and this character and that guy up there.

45:37.040 --> 45:57.040
And that dude and that dude, that dude, this lady, they've all been amplified in a way that hasn't helped our grandkids but has created the potential for chaos that they are now trying to, to jam in on.

45:57.040 --> 46:13.040
The intellectual dark web is at the heart of understanding what they did to us in the pandemic because they are the illusion of consensus they are the heart of the illusion of consensus because the illusion is that no matter where you turn.

46:13.040 --> 46:27.040
You find an agreement about a novel virus with a novel illness that we all got sick from it's pretty bizarre.

46:27.040 --> 46:39.040
And so I play this video with James Giordano a lot where he describes how I would see a few cases in Iowa and a few in Wisconsin and a few in Detroit.

46:39.040 --> 46:51.040
And then the real bug I would use is the internet I would take credit for it I would say I release something and then I would say that there was a bunch of asymptomatic because it can be spread asymptomatically.

46:51.040 --> 46:55.040
And basically, that's how you do it.

46:55.040 --> 47:09.040
And so if you imagine the easiest way to do it is to make sure that no matter where you tried to culture the virus with intention of claiming a sequence.

47:09.040 --> 47:25.040
You use to clone an RNA copy so that it would be the same whether you looked in Wuhan or whether you looked in the Sohomish County man or whether you looked in the sample that was sent from Bergamo Italy to the CDC would always get the same sequence.

47:25.040 --> 47:31.040
And then you could say hey look, it's the same sequence everywhere I guess it's the same virus.

47:32.040 --> 47:46.040
How many people behind the scenes would be necessary to say that out loud, knowing it was a lie and then stick to it in order for all of these other people to have been fooled.

47:46.040 --> 47:58.040
I would argue that not very many especially be given the fact that not very many people have read enough and tried hard enough to understand the biology underlying virology.

47:58.040 --> 48:11.040
And give it a real college try and evaluate whether or not virology as a whole is something you can swallow or not something that makes sense or not.

48:11.040 --> 48:24.040
And so we have been going on and on some of these people are active some of them don't have a clue that they're that they're being used like a ping pong ball.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.040
There are some people who definitely know.

48:27.040 --> 48:34.040
There are some people who definitely know.

48:34.040 --> 48:46.040
And Peter teal right what what what what giant weaponized pile of money is he on top of what what large corporation meddling behind the scenes about data.

48:46.040 --> 48:49.040
Is he the head up.

48:50.040 --> 48:55.040
You spoke earlier about people being very enthusiastic to give their data.

48:55.040 --> 49:03.040
I think you're over exaggerating how enthusiastic people are about just giving can't block access to their data.

49:03.040 --> 49:10.040
Are you aware that Palantir and faculty have links to the discredited Cambridge Analytica.

49:11.040 --> 49:16.040
I'm not.

49:16.040 --> 49:20.040
I don't I don't think I'm aware of that though.

49:20.040 --> 49:24.040
Okay, well I think it's really vital that you should be aware of that.

49:24.040 --> 49:36.040
I mean it's you know Palantir reportedly taught Cambridge Analytica how to scrape data that means that you're putting at risk everybody's data in the country and given it to organizations such as Palantir.

49:36.040 --> 49:51.040
It's really important that you get to grips with that and I will and I will give you so so the UK gave away their data Israel gave away their data everybody's giving away their data we're probably giving away our data unbeknownst to us.

49:51.040 --> 50:00.040
We probably gave away millions of genetic sequences during the testing in 2020 and 2021 but we shouldn't pay any attention to that at all.

50:00.040 --> 50:18.040
That would be a crazy thing to worry about just forget about 2020 and 2021 and the huge basic violation of our privacy the basic violation of our human rights where hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans were coerced with false narratives

50:18.040 --> 50:31.040
into sampling their their inner nasal passages with highly dangerous Chinese produced swabs and then had these samples sent somewhere.

50:31.040 --> 50:41.040
Who knows where probably to China because you can sell remnants of tests remember ladies and gentlemen, something that a lot of people are aware of.

50:41.040 --> 51:00.040
But if they swabbed your kid in college every two weeks or every week in order for him or her to go to school in order for him to go to class or her to go to class after that swab was tested for SARS-CoV-2 it could be sold as a remnant and that remnant would contain the DNA of your child

51:00.040 --> 51:17.040
and lots and lots of universities actually had a way of selling the remnants already in place because they're connected to a medical school they're connected to a hospital that's been selling remnants for years

51:17.040 --> 51:33.040
and so those those pipelines were already in place and believe it or not they were contracts already in place very early before any test was even available in America universities were already shopping around for people that might want the remnants

51:33.040 --> 51:51.040
Ladies and gentlemen, the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of irony RNA molecule and there are certain people who ignore this on purpose they want you to believe that they're somewhere out there in the ether is the fifth generation warfare

51:51.040 --> 52:05.040
that's that's you can't ever identify and see no ladies and gentlemen there are people who are lying right to your face some of them would even come to your house if they needed to

52:05.040 --> 52:14.040
some of them would even stay overnight in your house if they needed to in order to make sure that big truths don't get out

52:14.040 --> 52:24.040
big truths like intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb I believe

52:24.040 --> 52:32.040
I believe with most of my heart right now that I just saw Paul Offit respond directly to that statement

52:33.040 --> 52:37.040
and I think we're going to watch it a little later if we have enough time.

52:37.040 --> 52:50.040
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent viruses are not patterned integrity everybody who hasn't already spoken up about the idea that we shouldn't be transfecting healthy humans is criminally negligent

52:50.040 --> 53:10.040
and the more letters you have behind your name the more biology experience that you have be it as a primary care physician a nurse a dental hygienist a vet tech or somebody who works at a pet store I'm telling you right now

53:10.040 --> 53:21.040
that you need to come to terms with the fact that you should have done known better a long time ago that this was transfection and we shouldn't be doing it to healthy humans

53:21.040 --> 53:35.040
but again the spread of bad ideas that's what's going on here these people aren't aren't promoted for nothing they are promoted artificially and they are promoted on purpose so that the illusion can be sustained

53:35.040 --> 53:44.040
when you get rid of all of this stuff the illusion is always the same the clown show that's going on here is always the same

53:44.040 --> 53:59.040
do you really believe that a woman whose daughter was featured three times by Alex Jones or two times or I don't care even one hour with Alex Jones for being a rebel

53:59.040 --> 54:13.040
for being an outspoken critic of something America is now a legitimate dissident a former what does she say retired pharma R&D and executive independently wealthy

54:13.040 --> 54:26.040
this person is legitimate let's let's let's look at this sub stack comment where she basically explains all of human biology in three paragraphs with a dull at the end

54:26.040 --> 54:49.040
and you can see how much obfuscation is going on how many just people with no principles no scruples are working actively against the American public to try and confuse to try and so frustration and doubt but never actually lead anybody out of the cave at all

54:49.040 --> 55:06.040
anything that throws your system off balance will make you sick the seasonal flu illnesses due to reduce sunlight vitamin D and the die off of bifida by bacteria in the gut and the subsequent D talk cycle in two sentences she's explained something

55:06.040 --> 55:18.040
that western medicine really hasn't been able to explain yet that's pretty that's pretty cool if you exercise outdoors in the winter and it's sunny enough you won't get sick

55:18.040 --> 55:35.040
okay why people especially children seem to catch it a couple of things we are largely water children have much higher water content than adults the whole world is made of water and communicates through water uses chemical and electromagnetic and sound waves

55:35.040 --> 55:48.040
we humans emit light and other electromagnetic waves obviously we emit sound waves we emit chemical waves by shedding material both innocuous skin cells and dangerous to other humans our own waste

55:48.040 --> 56:02.040
that's why 6000 years ago civilized humans knew not to pollute sources of drinking water with human and animal waste however in the 1800s people crowded in New York City horse manure piled to the first floor windows and there was an epidemic of smallpox

56:02.040 --> 56:06.040
wow rocket science

56:06.040 --> 56:12.040
so any exhaust you emit may transmit others via water

56:12.040 --> 56:27.040
air is also water when there are a lot of people crowded together they are too close they pick up each other's exhaust which may contain chemical molecules nucleic acids typically in lipid envelopes I think they call those exosomes

56:27.040 --> 56:41.040
not sure or other transmission energy which can be good or bad bad can trigger your own system into detox soap breaks lipids and the nucleic acids quickly denature

56:42.040 --> 56:54.040
is that do proteins denature or do nucleic acids that's why we use soap as disinfecting cleaning agent so far I understand soap I understand flu

56:54.040 --> 57:08.040
I understand that we emit all kinds of waves some of them are good some of them are detox waves I guess regarding what was COVID chemical slash biological aerosolized material can be characterized as infectious clone

57:08.040 --> 57:18.040
so an infectious clone is a chemical biological aerosolized material to create an initial wave of sickness with bizarre symptoms and freak everybody out

57:18.040 --> 57:33.040
subsequent mass murder by hospital protocols and the rest of the fascism now injected people are producing the same poison in their gut oh because their E. coli cells are hacked and made into spike protein

57:34.040 --> 57:47.040
so that's a pretty testable hypothesis isn't it how long they will be producing this shit literally it varies everyone is different it's best to stay away from high concentrations of the vast

57:47.040 --> 58:02.040
and so the amount of nonsense in this pair these three paragraphs is pretty impressive I mean maybe an AI packed it in there for I don't know but she does prolifically write a sub stack so maybe she types I don't know

58:02.040 --> 58:19.040
but there's nothing here for our grandkids there's nothing here that says who did it and why there's nothing that explains why the DOD released chemical or biologically aerosolized material that she says

58:19.040 --> 58:34.040
is an infectious clone but what is an infectious clone she's never really defined it she's just agreed yeah that sounds great and then at the same time turned around and mocked and criticized me or tried to say that I'm somehow

58:34.040 --> 58:46.040
attacking her or her daughter to wave her hands and to start a fire in a dumpster basically and pretend that she's the opposition of Robert Malone after traveling the world with him

58:46.040 --> 58:54.040
I'm not going to believe that while going to Stockholm with somebody doesn't mean I'm friends with him

58:54.040 --> 59:12.040
she works with the same group of people Meryl Nass Robert Malone, Sasha Latipova there's quite a few of them that all seem to pretend to be opposed to one another but are all on Robert Malone's list of bad guys along with me

59:12.040 --> 59:27.040
there's one great big giant theater of players with only a few that actually rent their house with only a few that actually need every view and every donation

59:27.040 --> 59:44.040
that nobody sees those are the ones that nobody pays attention to those are the ones that everybody as a rule agrees to criticize Kevin McCurnan Kevin McCarn, Sasha Latipova, Paul Catrell, George Webb

59:44.040 --> 59:58.040
how long of the list would you like to make of people who think that Jonathan Cooley is somehow working from his garage to take advantage of the world somehow rather than trying to tell the truth that they won't

59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.040
that they have never told

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:16.040
because where are the doses here where are the different batches that she started coming out on in so early in the narrative where are the where's the deception about the hot hot lots

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:30.040
the hot lots didn't have anything to do with anything here anymore that was the first thing that she came out about now she's forgotten about those she's got a whole paragraph for the whole world being made of water and communicating through water

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:46.040
I'm not distracting you with water like a lot of other people have done not to say that water isn't important in the the crystal lattice that water can can make is not absolutely vital to understanding how proteins function and enzymes work

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:55.040
and how cellular mechanics can possibly occur all has to do with the properties of water absolutely

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:12.040
no distraction from understanding what happened in the pandemic it's a distraction from understanding what public health is and isn't just like this group of three paragraphs is nothing but a distraction given to you by somebody who's been

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:32.040
on stage likely working against us first is standing in front of and taking the mic from a guy by the name of of pardon coper or part of coper which is horse buyer so hilarious to stepping in front of somebody like Catherine Watts

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:48.040
who again Catherine Watts says that health and human services department of homeland security, FEMA, DITRA, DARPA, the executive branch and the DOD are all involved

01:01:48.040 --> 01:02:04.040
and she doesn't claim to know what happened but Sasha claims to know what happened it was a chemical biological aerosolized material that could be characterized as an infectious clone whenever that is

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:19.040
the most spectacular nature of these medlers is that she can feign as though she's giving a hat tip to our work feign as though she's giving a hat tip to some of some people's ideas when she says murder by hospital protocols

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:35.040
but it's not specific enough and it doesn't impart the knowledge that would be required for anybody to go out and use this and to spread this and that's the deception

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:58.040
unfortunately for me this is my role I belong nowhere and everywhere and I'm not afraid to stand up by myself in the middle of a 3,000 person lecture and ask a question that is antagonistic to the person speaking

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:17.040
I was never afraid and in fact it was one of my favorite things to do and so I'm never going to be afraid to step up to this mic and call these people out because I believe that this is the start

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:34.040
if I can't explain to my 14 year old son why I think this is a medler and succinctly bring him to understand it then maybe I don't understand it

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:52.040
I stream to understand why these people actually coming to my house and telling me lies to my face is a significant data point that can help other people understand the pandemic of lies

01:03:53.040 --> 01:04:04.040
that's what I need to do because all of these people have lied to my face not not in an email or in a sub stack post or in a comment or in a tweet

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:16.040
I've taken selfies with these people I've shaken their hand I've talked to them for a few minutes I've questioned them I've heard their voices lie to me

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.040
and so I interview people like Thomas Binder because I think that there are people who have been standing up from the beginning

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:45.040
does Thomas Binder have everything right did you notice that in that interview I didn't touch the virus no virus topic at all and whether or not it was we already we agreed that the vast majority of what was iatrogenic murder

01:04:46.040 --> 01:05:01.040
debating about the rest of the story is kind of irrelevant when we find out that would be great and if it comes to the fact that we have they've exaggerated virology terribly well we will come to that first we need to get justice for the murdered

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:19.040
and interestingly I noticed that by staying off of that topic his interview is being shared by lots of people and it's going lots of places because for whatever reason we didn't question the faith in this particular interview and by not questioning the faith

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:36.040
apparently it's okay for the algorithm to hear it it's okay for other people to share it so we'll take advantage of that because we're still telling the truth here we still told the truth on the stream I guess we just didn't say it so directly

01:05:37.040 --> 01:06:01.040
but the illusion of consensus still stands these people are still standing and they're still pushing it and so we still have a lot to fight even though we've been using this slide for more than three or four years now this is still the truth the illusion of consensus has been foisted upon us in order to invert our sovereignty to permissions

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:13.040
and I blame the intellectual dark web for doing it wittingly or unwittingly they knew they were being elevated artificially they knew they were being given a gift of comfort and fame and they took it

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.040
and when they were asked to use their comfort and fame to spread this mythology they spread it

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:30.040
and none of them have confessed to it yet none of them have apologized for it yet all of them are still claiming hero still claiming victim

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:43.040
and we have seen a tremendous amount of vaccine hesitancy unfortunately in the black and Hispanic community if they come up with a vaccine be careful

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:50.040
they're not going to get the vaccine

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.040
don't let them vaccinate you

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.040
with their history

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.040
of treachery

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.040
through vaccines

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:11.040
hey black america only 67% of black americans say they definitely will get the vaccine or probably get the vaccine so the black community has tremendous vaccine hesitancy

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:22.040
they are making money now plotting to give 7,500 million people a vaccination

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040
Dr. Fauci

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.040
Bill Gates and Melinda

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.040
you want to depopulate there

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.040
what the hell gives you that right?

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:48.040
I think you're going to be ripped up and down right now are people like Lewis Farrakhan who's literally going out there and telling his millions of followers that the COVID vaccine is a vile of death have you seen any media coverage of this?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:58.040
if a major conservative figure who had met with a bunch of members of congress were out there literally telling people that the COVID vaccine was a vile of death you know that would be at the front of every single newspaper right?

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.040
Conservatives deny vaccine efficacy

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.040
and yet here was Lewis Farrakhan doing just that democratic members of Congress have met with this guy they continue to meet with this guy

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:14.040
have you seen a headline about this? Here's Lewis Farrakhan plus many many followers talking about how the COVID vaccine is a vile of death

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:21.040
some of these so-called vaccines

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:43.040
nanoparticles that men like Dr. Fauci have proprietary knowledge of that allows them to get a patent for their vile of death

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:56.040
I mean how is that not the headline right? I mean seriously that should be the headline you want to talk about overcoming COVID we should be talking about vaccine hesitancy

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:07.040
I would argue that we should be talking about him and how he is working to undermine the American public's ability to govern itself

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:16.040
he is working to undermine our republic by lying about and getting people to ask the wrong question

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:34.040
think about how extraordinary that footage is this is the same guy that was sitting at that table with Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson and Seth or Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein and Brett Weinstein

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:44.040
planning the intellectual dark web of group of people that would create an illusion of consensus or heterodoxy

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:59.040
and be in position at the start of the pandemic to do exactly this exactly what Brett allowed Sam to do on his number eight podcast in December of 2019 and go on and say

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:12.040
we're not going to be able to tolerate the anti-vax mentality when the next pandemic comes

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:27.040
I think what they did is criminal we have on special guest back to the show Dr. Robert Malone he's an internationally recognized scientist and physician as well as the inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:44.040
and multiple non viral DNA and RNA mRNA platform delivery technologies Dr. Malone has approximately 100 scientific publication credits with over 12,000 citations of his work during the pandemic Dr. Malone emerged as one of the

01:10:44.040 --> 01:11:00.040
various critics of the COVID vaccines and the scariest part of Jimmy Dorr is that he's trying the scariest part of Jimmy Dorr is that you're actually watching a person being made into a ping pong ball

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:20.040
and every time I mean he had a real big awakening with regard to Cornell West he had a real big awakening with regard to to Robert F Kennedy Jr as did I and he can still have a very big awakening with regard to the pandemic

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:28.040
he's coming to a theater outside of Pittsburgh at the end of April and I will be there

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:38.040
and so I have very high hopes that Jimmy Dorr actually can be told to his face that these people have been lying to you they're good people but they're not good people

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:52.040
because they've been read into a national security operation that is still ongoing and so they have to agree that there was a novel virus they can't question that and so you can't blame them

01:11:52.040 --> 01:12:00.040
because that's the situation they're in, they've chosen it, they've made their bed now they've got to sleep in it but you don't have to promote them anymore

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:21.040
and instead you can promote people like Jessica Hockett like Mark Koolack like myself who understand the biology that more parsimoniously explains what happened by a combination of coordinated and spectacular commitment to lies

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:28.040
and having a plan in place already that everybody was bound to stick to because of salary or whatever

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:40.040
I think we can get to them and so I don't know what date it is I got the tickets I'm not gonna you can figure it out it's like I don't know an hour outside of Pittsburgh and we will be there

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:49.040
because I do think that this limited spectrum of debate is starting to crack and deform because it has been bent too far

01:12:49.040 --> 01:13:03.040
and if we are vigilant and if we continue to apply steady pressure some of these people are gonna break not everybody enjoys doing what they're doing I don't think Jessica Rose enjoys every time somebody introduces her

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:20.040
she cringes a little bit with the she has an undergraduate degree in computational biology and a master's in medicine and immunology and a postdoctoral degree or PhD in this and a postdoctoral degree in that and another postdoctoral degree in that

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:37.040
she knows she's full of shit she knows that's not the way that postdocs work she knows that her track record that has led her all the way to tenure on sub stack is not exactly a track record that belies mastery of any particular subject

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:53.040
but she is the self-declared VAERS expert and she is a independent researcher I guess whatever that means

01:13:53.040 --> 01:14:08.040
I don't think everybody enjoys it but they all are aware of what they're doing I am I assure you they know many times that early on and I mean very early when the when the original Wuhan strain was still active

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:23.040
it might have convinced me that it made sense to give a 92 year old debilitated nursing home patient a vaccine because there was some modicum of protection against that original strain but the efficacy has long been below zero

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:43.040
it is now as Dr. Alex Andrew points out it is negative efficacy in all ages in all ages in all ages is negative efficacy your risk of contracting COVID is higher the more vaccinated you are and frankly what the jury's out but we don't know yet

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:58.040
we know that it increases your risk of contracting COVID and having severe symptoms what we don't know is what it's doing to your overall immunity your risk of contracting influenza and having a bad outcome your risk certainly of developing a new cancer

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:12.040
because you have suppressed your normal immune response we certainly know that people are having repeated outbreaks of shingles and other things because their immune systems have taken a real ding from these

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:29.040
Dr. Rish I was gonna say Dr. Alexander Dr. Rish just shared with us a couple of days ago a new study that looked for the first time that I'm aware at the risk benefit calculation specifically for the 18 to 29 year olds with regard to the boosters

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:46.040
so they're still debating how the transfection interacts with the novel virus and so this is going to feed right into the narrative that there's biology that carrot fund and ball is the master of and most in touch with

01:15:46.040 --> 01:16:03.040
and so sooner or later I think carrot fund and ball is gonna be the guy that takes the international stage to explain to us what the next wave of nonsense is gonna be but it's basically gonna be the idea that the effect of over vaccinating the world

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:13.040
with this highly effective transfection is going to be that we push the virus into this particularly dangerous direction that's now having ramifications all around the world

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:21.040
of course that could be something that they had planned and aren't gonna do anymore it's something that they might want us to argue about but it will never actually happen

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:32.040
and already we can see this week carrot fund and ball has another post about how this is a picture of a tsunami and that he can predict it

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:44.040
and so this whole thing is just a bunch of actors all agree not to question the basic tenets of the faith which is that there was a novel virus for which we were all vulnerable

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:54.040
and that vaccines give us immunity through antibodies and that we can measure the antibodies and the affinity that they have for them

01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:09.040
now we're gonna be told all kinds of stories about how there are all these maladaptive antibodies and maybe auto immunity from the shot is being caused by antibodies which are being made to the spike that are too good or something like that

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:22.040
we're still being going around the roundabout there's Big Ben there's Parliament hey kids there's Big Ben there's Parliament around and around the roundabout

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:37.040
and no one ever actually makes the turn to understanding that if they lied about the immunology and they lied about the potential for gain of function and they lied about the protocols that they used and they lied about the numbers

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:47.040
then there's no need for there to be a novel virus if we don't have any data about the prevalence of these sequences or sequences related to them before the pandemic

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:53.040
then we have no reason to believe that it wasn't here before then

01:17:53.040 --> 01:18:08.040
and as the number of doctors comes forward and says hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense once the number of doctors realizes what happens to a person who comes into a hospital thinking that they might be sick

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:20.040
and they get surrounded by people who are wearing garbage bags and helmets and face masks and steaming up

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:27.040
steaming up woodshop goggles in order to protect themselves what they perceive me to have

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:37.040
well that's a pretty optimal start for the doctor-patient relationship I'm sure that will be totally successful put him on oxygen

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:41.040
and away we go

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:50.040
one lie on TV and on the NIH director's blog another lie on social media and on YouTube

01:18:50.040 --> 01:19:03.040
one doctor named Kyle Seidel one nurse named Aaron and away we go

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:15.040
and this spread of bad ideas continues with one doctor named Pierre one retired pharmacy guy named Girado

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:35.040
all these people putting bad ideas out there that supposedly explain everything with certainty while insulting everybody else instead of coming to the obvious conclusion that why couldn't it be all of these things

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:44.040
why does Mark Girado have to be right about the bolus theory why couldn't the bolus theory be part of the problem

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:54.040
why do we have to be right about vaccines causing autism why couldn't sometimes it cause autism and sometimes it's the title and I'll give an afterward

01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:04.040
sometimes it's the circumstances beforehand or the circumstances afterward sometimes it's maybe even a genetic vulnerability

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.040
and an environmental insult

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:18.040
but why does it always have to be one thing one explanation one answer because then you'll almost certainly get it wrong

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.040
that's how they played us

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:27.040
I'm right no you're right I'm certain oh that's a great explanation wow

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.040
the only one that really fits that explanation is lying

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:47.040
once you realize that if a group of people agrees to lie to another group of people that they happen to be above in social status happen to be above in social media ranking and following

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.040
we would be screwed and all the other things wouldn't be necessary

01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:01.040
they could convince us of an alien invasion I'm Dr Gus Grant they could convince us we need to say our pronouns

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.040
surgeons in Nova Scotia pronouns he him

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:13.040
I'm David Fraser I'm a privacy lawyer with McGinnis Cooper working with the College of Physicians and Surgeons he him

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:21.040
they can convince people who know that saying your pronouns out loud is dumb

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:30.040
and panders to a mentality that is not biologically sound and based in biological the sacredness of biology

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:38.040
but based in some kind of twisted nonsense that has nothing to do with who we are as a species

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:43.040
nothing to do with what life is on earth

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:54.040
that's how disturbing the transgender movement is is because it doesn't just deny human reality it denies natural reality

01:21:54.040 --> 01:22:12.040
it suggests somehow that we can have a rainbow of genders which need to be understood and nurtured and maybe even surgically enhanced or gated with pharmaceutical intervention

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:18.040
and that's what separates us from the beasts of the world

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:23.040
that's what separates us

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:30.040
and I don't think God ever intended for us to be separate

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:41.040
I recall Jesus talking something about you shouldn't care about your clothes or the sparrows or something

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:52.040
we are in big trouble ladies and gentlemen this is a this is a hearing in Canada where they are fighting against but essentially nothing is going to be nothing is going to stop it

01:22:52.040 --> 01:23:04.040
then this Financial Measures Act they are turning over the data of all of the Canadians and specifically of course their vaccination record but everything over to the government

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:12.040
it's now accessible and I don't know what else they're going to do there testing out what they can get away with up there before they try to enact it down here

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:19.040
same with Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Europe, the EU

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:31.040
all different aspects of the prison being tried out all different aspects of the prison being rolled out in test so that they know how to do it best in America

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:40.040
that's the reality of things ladies and gentlemen that's why I'm wearing this hat because America is under attack America is the focus of this

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.040
the EU is already gone

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
Canada is already gone

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.040
Australia gave up their guns in the 90s

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:56.040
New Zealand, come on

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:04.040
I'm talking about what is that four counties in a in a populous state in America I mean give me a break ladies and gentlemen

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:15.040
the past is fading into mist very rapidly and being erased by people like Paul Offit by people like Robert Malone

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:24.040
being erased 2020 is being erased 2021 is being erased they are being forgotten

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:33.040
and this lie is going to become the truth if we're not careful because these people are still lying to us

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:43.040
this illusion of consensus this worst case scenario they're still lying to us about it lots of them are and they were doing it from the very very beginning

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:55.040
from the very very very beginning they were lying to us about the worst case scenario we were on this road all by ourselves we got picked up in their car and they were lying to us

01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:03.040
this is from just a few days ago I'm just going to escape and I'm going to start it over so that we get a little extra computing power here

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:12.040
this is from just a few days ago my good friend Ryan Cole who I trust as being a pretty good guy

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:28.040
when I met him at the conference in where did I put that now where did that go oh wow where is that

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:33.040
sorry not carry it around anymore I thought I carried it around somewhere

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:46.040
what the hell I have a little I had a little note from Ryan Cole that he wrote to me at that conference and now I can't find it it was supposed to be in my big wallet here

01:25:46.040 --> 01:26:03.040
but anyway it was a very supportive note and I actually believe that Ryan Cole is a good guy and that he's been on the inside of a few of these meetings he's been in a few of these places and he's a smart guy

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.040
he says what he can

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:16.040
I don't know I don't know how I feel about him I know that I have a better feeling about Ryan Cole than I have about a lot of people

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:30.040
and he could still be a ping pong ball and he could still be being used like all of us are being used even if we don't think we are I assume that somebody is still using me or trying to

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:41.040
and I think Ryan Cole does his very best not to be used but he was on Brett Weinstein's podcast and I think to a certain extent Brett used him

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:50.040
and so I mean I got a couple clips but I mean it's like two hours long so we won't do the whole thing

01:26:50.040 --> 01:27:02.040
in science is horrific at this point it's apocalyptic and the fact that the systemic hubris in science is horrific at this point

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:14.040
it's apocalyptic and the fact you know the hubris that allowed it to happen is bad enough the hubris that decides to hard code that it turns out to have been brilliant

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:24.040
and have worked wonderfully when the pattern that we see is no you've created a ton of new pathology that far exceeds the cost of this

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:34.040
viral pathology and worse the viral pathology itself was tremendously manageable with already existing safe drugs

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:44.040
absolutely so the point is look at how serious was this emergency well they made it into an emergency which then necessitated a radical intervention in their minds

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:53.040
and they have decided that the radical intervention must have worked wonderfully without causing harm because they told us it was safe and effective and that can't have been a lie

01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:00.040
so you know so we're still injecting people with this stuff which there simply isn't a defense of that

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:04.040
oh it's absolutely scientifically in defense more at this point

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:14.040
now what I find deceptive about this and I don't think that Ryan Cole is aware of what what Brett is doing and I do think that Brett is definitely holding a ping pong ball

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:26.040
ping pong paddle and using Ryan as a ball where he is claiming basically that he spoke up in 2020 or something like that because he didn't

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:39.040
he's basically absolving himself from any role in anybody stumbling their way into this shot in there being any amount of success at all hold on one second

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:45.040
I'm not gonna I maybe you can drop him off and come back and then I can go get him and play with him when I get there

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:59.040
the idea here for me that is most annoying is that Brett was not on point with his principles in 2020 or 2021

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:13.040
and in fact I think he's responsible for spreading some very very dangerous aspects of the worst case scenario too early on for it to have been random

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:25.040
one of the things I find very surprising is that Yuri Dagan a member of drastic was on Brett Weinstein's podcast and I actually didn't know that it happened

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:42.040
at that time I wasn't aware of who Brett was and so even though a member of drastic got on Brett Weinstein's podcast nobody inside of drastic really discussed it that I remember and I certainly never saw the video

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:58.040
and in actuality it turns out that the whole thing with drastic was one big operation right because Yuri Dagan is part of that splitting of drastic into two groups

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:14.040
and Yuri Dagan created this fight between him and Carl and Dan and Dan Saratkin and Carl Saratkin and fractured the group and forced people to choose and then Yuri Dagan was the first person

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:25.040
in drastic to block me on Twitter and he blocked me on Twitter because I said that something about the transfection being much more important than the origin of the virus at this stage

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:37.040
having already risked my faculty position and reviewed his paper and put my name and the University of Pittsburgh's name on his his paper about the fear and cleavage site

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:54.040
that was his thanks for me and the interesting thing was is that I was in a kind of private Slack group where Yuri Dagan was in that Slack group supposedly learning to day trade

01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:06.040
he blocked me on Twitter but still tried to be my friend a little bit in that group so already indirectly admitting that kind of it was a big show

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:20.040
and there you have it piece by piece little hint by little hint little lie by little lie little deception by little deception betrayal after betrayal

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:33.040
so I'm left feeling like the aliens keep coming to my house and I keep having to call up the news program and say hey they were here again and nobody wants to hear the story anymore

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:50.040
but this is the result of it the result is that somebody like Brett Weinstein who's been meddling with me since 2021 has been lying to me behind the scenes and a signal chat since 2021 about his intentions about his loyalties

01:31:50.040 --> 01:32:07.040
about his relationship with his brother about his understanding of immunology and and and transfection in order to run out the clock in order to make sure that the worst case scenario was never doubted early enough for anybody to escape the trap

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:29.040
that was the transfection he's fine with with taking the mantle of hero now knowing full well that he did his job to a tee and got every vulnerable skilled television watcher to buy full in and they're still buying it bought it

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:38.040
and now listen to this extremely disingenuous discussion about the possibility that there was no novel virus

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:50.040
because that's what we're in his car right he's driving around telling us the same story after four years you'd think maybe the story would have changed and it would be different but it's not

01:32:50.040 --> 01:33:08.040
I wanted to ask you about something else there is an awful lot of heat around the idea there's a group of people some of whom I know who have become convinced that there was no novel pathogen during COVID

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:25.040
and while on the one hand I believe they've missed their point I think their actual point should be something like no novel pathogen was necessary for most of what took place during COVID

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:36.040
there was an awful lot of psychological manipulation that involved fear of a pathogen but not did not require there to be a pathogen

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:50.040
as far as I'm concerned it is a slam dunk that there was a pathogen a novel one circulating and that that is not our minds playing tricks on us spotting normal fluid we would have gotten otherwise

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:55.040
and diagnosing it as COVID it was

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.040
have I ever said that it was our minds playing tricks on us

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:18.040
have any of us as Thomas Binder ever said that it was our mind playing tricks on us has Mark ever said that it was our mind playing tricks on us

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:30.040
what I'm saying and when Mark saying what Jessica Hockett are saying is that people are lying to us about it and that's why we were fooled

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:46.040
and he is in on it he whether he was winningly or unwittinglyly participating in it he fueled the worst case scenario narrative about a novel virus escaping from a lab or coming from bush meat

01:34:46.040 --> 01:35:02.040
and that worst case scenario is the reason why a lot of skilled TV watchers and a lot of skilled social media users are still convinced that this isn't a transaction it's a vaccination

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:16.040
that allowed the narrative to take hold it was him that allowed this the trials for the vaccine to have meaning do you understand that

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:34.040
if Mike Eden would have gotten to the mic in 2020 and said there isn't a novel pathogen that we need to worry about because we have overlapping T cell immunity if if Ryan Cole would have been able to say that in 2020 to the masses

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:56.040
I've never met him would have never been needed hydroxychloroquine wouldn't have been a discussion point ventilators or no ventilators come on the only way they got away with that is calling this a novel virus and making doctors put on garbage bags

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:13.040
because he said it was a good idea because the potential was there it wasn't our minds fooling us it was people agreeing to fool us

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:31.040
yes I do believe it's possible very likely that Brett Weinstein winningly or unwittingly was one of those people that was put in place early on to make sure that the internet would not be a place of escape but would be another facet of the trap

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:38.040
but I think it's been a few days ago and he still can't manage to say much

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:46.040
an awful lot of weirdness surrounding the tests for COVID which seemed to be bizarrely unreliable

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:51.040
but I think that your assessment as a

01:36:51.040 --> 01:37:03.040
does that come off as a I'm sorry I'm meeting this meat stick does that come off as a honest assessment of the PCR test given what you've heard from me

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:13.040
where I've tried so desperately to explain that if we have a background signal that could be conflated using PCR

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:28.040
specificity is important that nested primers would be important that multiple controls would be important that all kinds of methodological steps could be taken to make these things more accurate that were never taken

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:42.040
it gives them the simplest Lucy football garbage statement about it instead of being precise instead of talking about the details instead of telling the whole story

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.040
we get have truths

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:54.040
that is essentially useless to his listeners because that didn't that didn't arm them with any knowledge that has any teeth

01:37:54.040 --> 01:38:01.040
that just said well I guess Brett Weinstein's also very skeptical of the PCR that seems bizarrely unreliable

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:13.040
you're a biologist explain it take a shot Brett for once in four years take a shot at explaining something using your own ideas

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:24.040
your own best understanding you won't because you can't that sound was invented for Brett Weinstein

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:41.040
the doctor who was working with samples from patients of all levels of sickness how confident are you that there was a novel pathogen circulating during what we I think wrongly called a pandemic

01:38:41.040 --> 01:39:00.040
I call it semi novel because the homology to SARS-CoV-1 another beta coronavirus is 76% homologous and if you look at the proteins of common cold coronaviruses whether you're looking at the other the nucleocapsid region or other regions

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:10.040
anywhere from 40 to 60% similar to and it goes to your expertise of evolutionary biology let's get a little more precise here Ryan I love you to death

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:23.040
but if you're going to say something about the end protein or other proteins that were potential targets for the the amplicons please be sure that you at least mention that these are functional proteins

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:40.040
and as functional proteins they have parts that are more important than other parts and parts that are more conserved than other parts and so if we aim this PCR had a more conserved region it will have more overlap with the end protein of other coronaviruses

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:55.040
then if we pick the part that doesn't have overlap and that choice needed to be made and that choice probably wasn't made to our advantage but to theirs for maximum positivity and maximum lack of specificity

01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:07.040
you could be more precise four years into this Brett Weinstein's knowledge could be a little bit more in depth four years into this but it's not

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:19.040
and so although Ryan is doing his best he hasn't talked to me about it and he hasn't watched the videos that I've produced about it so that you can really understand

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:42.040
that for example the poly protein that's made by the open reading frame one AB or one A those poly proteins to a certain extent are pretty highly conserved because they're all enzymes that do different things like cut up the poly protein in order to make the replicase transcriptase complex whatever you want to call it that actually copies things

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:59.040
there's a viral protein that needs to be made before any of this stuff can happen and so there are regions in there that are highly conserved across coronaviruses that happen to be also highly conserved across T cell memory

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:14.040
and that's the heart of the story that's that's how you get to the heart of the story the quickest it doesn't seem like they're really doing that here and so yeah I'm a little frustrated with both Ryan and Brett but it's because of Brett

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:24.040
because Brett purports to be this guy who studies complex systems and evolutionary biology with a unique insight into everything

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:40.040
but he doesn't really understand the details of anything and he can't explain him but he wants to claim mastery he wants to claim that he's ahead of it he wants to claim these ideas are his own

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:50.040
but he couldn't teach his way out of a wet paper bag what's going on here other than lying and posing to be part of the governance structure these auditioning for something

01:41:50.040 --> 01:42:04.040
what's novel about this one is the spike protein and the improbability that it would bind to human cells to the degree of affinity to which it does

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:14.040
which again goes back to many of them so if they planted a cloned sequence so that there would be no sequence errors

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:29.040
because remember sequencing is a consensus genome so if they were really sequencing a novel virus in the wild the spike protein would be the most varied subgenomic gene

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:39.040
because it is the most it's translated in the greatest abundance we've looked at these experiments before it gets translated in several orders of magnitude more times than the whole genome

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:54.040
it could be 600,000 copies of the spike protein subgenomic RNA and not all those copies are perfect which means not all the spike proteins that are produced are the same spike protein and so there would be a consensus genome

01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:14.040
and so if the consensus genome that they published in China was wrong then the fear and cleavage site might have just been lost because the translation of the consensus by the algorithm didn't translate that amino acid to the right amino acid

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:31.040
how many errors in those places would be necessary for the illusion of this novel virus to go away like those HIV inserts those also just happened to come right out of the sequence there we didn't miss any of those

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:42.040
and so you could think of it as wow serendipity huh that the same sequence was found in Wuhan that was found in in Seattle that gets found in Bergamo or anywhere else

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:52.040
but the very way that that sequencing is done suggests that that shouldn't even be possible

01:43:52.040 --> 01:44:09.040
and yet none of these foundational assumptions are ever going to be questioned by these two guys because we are at a fully safe medium that is the Brett Weinstein podcast

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:27.040
that is the Brett Weinstein podcast the books you and I have both read and presentations that this was targeted and engineered in a way to be novel in its behavior genetically it's not as novel as oh de novo here's a brand new virus

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:43.040
no here's a backbone and here's a new damaging modality that has been tacked on to it so it's novel in that regard and this is why a lot of people didn't happen to get very sick with it because they had cross reactivity to so many other proteins in their immune systems

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:55.040
and this is so similar though all those colds have had that sure the immune system had seen close relatives but yeah I don't mean novel in the sense of wildly different I mean novel in the sense that

01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:03.040
the behavior was different I mean how many viruses caused the extreme clotting that we saw with this virus in the pre roll out of the injections

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:11.040
yeah it was causing certain harms that we weren't used to seeing clinically in that sense yeah we were seeing novel behaviors of it

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:28.040
right a novel set of pathology is correct in my opinion I mean part of the argument I would be interested to talk to Ryan about whether those novel pathologies could be explained by supplemental oxygen that wasn't necessary to give

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:42.040
because talking about clotting in the United States talking about clotting and injuries like heart attacks and that kind of thing where we know we know that there were do not resuscitate orders

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:54.040
we know that people weren't treating people like they should have been treated we know that people were being given things that they shouldn't have been given that were not ever considered okay before

01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:04.040
and I am very suspect when anybody says that what we saw was novel when what we did was novel

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:17.040
every time somebody tested positive or we suspected it especially in the beginning we treated them in a way that we never would have treated them otherwise not in the history the modern history of the United States

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:37.040
and they are actively ignoring that they are not talking about that fact they are just assuming that everything that we saw that was novel was really a coronavirus when we were primed to see it

01:46:38.040 --> 01:47:05.040
okay don't come in here and that's fine little demons oops that was not what I wanted to do I'm gonna go back one oh come on Jay you're ruining it you're ruining it oh my goodness I blew it there we go okay let me come on please stop fiddling around

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:18.040
no novel pathogen is that biologists overrate their capacity to actually produce anything new that would stand up under environmental conditions and I had some sympathy with that

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:32.040
well de novo here's a brand new virus yeah no here's a backbone and here's a new damaging modality that has been tacked on to it so it's novel in that regard and this is why a lot of people didn't happen to get very sick with it

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:42.040
because they had cross reactivity to so many other proteins in their immune system so similar though all those colds have had that sure the immune system had seen close relatives

01:47:42.040 --> 01:48:01.040
yeah I don't mean novel in the sense see they still don't understand it and and Brett is still not saying it and even though I've been trying to get it in his head for four years now it's not that you saw it before it's what is shared between these

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:18.040
whatever they want to call them pathogens that's important it is the it is the damage associated molecular pattern that we make immune memory to we don't make brand new snapshots with all kinds of brand new antibodies to every

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:26.040
virus that we come in contact with even if there are all kinds of different viruses which I'm not really sure about anymore

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:38.040
that's not the way the immune system works the immune system tries to limit the amount of memory it makes and it makes memory to things that it considers vital important conserved and damaging dangerous

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:45.040
there's no reason to make an antibody to something that isn't dangerous

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:55.040
the implication is is that we block the virus from binding to ourselves block the virus because we have to block the virus with an antibody so that it can't bind

01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:12.040
that's not a real legitimate use of an antibody unless what we're blocking is toxic unless what we're blocking is a damage associated molecular pattern it doesn't make any sense to make a molecular memory to it so something about

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:24.040
the idea of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies targeted to the receptor binding domain is already biologically incongruent I can't explain adequately what it is or how it is

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:39.040
but without a doubt it's biologically incongruent it's it's creepy and they are not touching it just like Joe Lee getting all angry about Jay ignoring his spike chain hypothesis

01:49:39.040 --> 01:50:03.040
is not addressing this issue and it feels like they are but they're not because if they were they would be addressing the biological implausibility of antibodies being a primary response being a reflective of something good

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:15.040
of wildly different I mean novel in the sense that behavior was different I mean how many viruses caused the extreme clotting that we saw with this virus in the pre roll out of the injections

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:29.040
extreme clotting I would really like to understand what he's talking about here what is this extreme clotting what papers does he have evidence for it from and how does he differentiate this from people who were having a stroke and told

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:41.040
they are not resuscitated how many how many people had heart attacks because they were put inappropriately on ventilation or you know all of this stuff I've got a I've got a problem with it if people were sedated

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:55.040
to be put on a ventilator you know all of these things can cause an increase in clotting an increase in in all of these problems that have nothing to do with COVID you see if all of these people were dying in their house

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:09.040
that'd be one thing but I think the majority of the people died in a hospital where the clotting could be caused by the bullshit they put in a certain harms that we weren't used to seeing clinically in that sense yeah we were seeing novel behaviors of it

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:37.040
right a a novel set of pathologies corrosion and in my opinion I mean part of the argument for there being no novel pathogen is that biologists over rate no no the primary reason why we argue that there might not be a pathogen is because there's no evidence of spread you poser you absolute poser

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:56.040
you can't possibly be you are masquerading as a deep thinker if you haven't gotten to this realization already that that Denny Rancor or Jessica Hockett or myself or anyone else hasn't brought you to understand that if the 500,000 people so far that have died

01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:06.040
in the last few years from opioids aren't accounted for but are just called excess deaths and then rolled into COVID we have a problem

01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:18.040
if you're not willing to take account of the fact that people were murdered in 2020 then we have a problem and Brett is not willing to take that into account because he was part of it

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:29.040
he was part of seeding the narrative he was part of making sure that everybody complied with the lockdown that didn't resist it too much that didn't come up with a good reason to resist

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:32.040
he was part of it

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:46.040
and my guess is that he participated willingly because he thought he was doing something bright that he thought maybe he was going to save some lives because the worst case scenario might be true because he's not sophisticated enough yet to understand it

01:52:46.040 --> 01:53:00.040
because he's either been looking away too long he hasn't bothered to read what I've put in front of him or he's actively participating in the network of people that govern us with lies that's linked to his father and all these other people

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.040
how about that

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:08.040
now that I'm not linked to CHD I guess I can say anything I want to about their partners

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.040
let's keep this playing

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:21.040
their capacity to actually produce anything new that would stand up under environmental conditions and I have some sympathy with that that's the kind of argument I would often make about

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:36.040
you know listen to how medically in that sense yeah we were this argument that Brett makes is that that biologists can't make something that can do this this is again a very very clever absorption of giga ohm biological statement

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.040
that RNA can't pandemic

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:47.040
he's trying to be a mealy-mouthed absorber of the real points we are making

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.040
he's obfuscating the truth here

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.040
in the worst way possible

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:56.040
see it for what it is

01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:01.040
RNA can't pandemic is a very very simple idea

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:12.040
that in all the time that he's been talking about it since the start of this clip he hasn't even come close to distilling it down to that raw essence

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:24.040
RNA can't pandemic that's that is the principle so if RNA can't pandemic it must have always been there and if it was always there then they're lying about it and that's how the PCR was bizarrely unreliable

01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.040
gee it's not very complicated is it Brett?

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:43.040
unless you're spectacularly committed to the lie if you're spectacularly committed to the faith and it's your job to make sure that people like Ryan Cole never find people like me and listen long enough to understand that you're actually part of it

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:54.040
so I think we should work to get Ryan Cole on our stream because I think actually Ryan Cole is capable of understanding that these people may have lied to us that people were put in place in order to lie to us

01:54:54.040 --> 01:55:03.040
that this wasn't a plan that they hatched a few weeks before the January 2020 announcement but it was a plan that they hatched 20 years ago

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:16.040
and have been putting people in place to execute this plan for 20 years some of them wittingly some of them unwittingly

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:23.040
but we are under attack by people who are essentially traitors

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:28.040
and we're seeing novel behaviors of it right a novel set of pathologies correct

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:44.040
and in my opinion I mean part of the argument for there being no novel pathogen is that biologists overrate their capacity to actually produce anything new that would say that they're environmental conditions

01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:53.040
that's the kind of argument I would often make about you know the hubris of biologists who think they can outwit nature but that's not what I think happened

01:55:53.040 --> 01:56:07.040
I think mostly what happened is a pathogen that would not have jumped to humans might have jumped to individual humans but would not have jumped to humans and circulated amongst them was shepherded into humans

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:22.040
in the laboratory for presumably weapons purposes but nonetheless that you know if I'm shepherding he means that they enhanced it they enriched it they worked it on a background

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:31.040
so that we become better at what it's doing that that's the gain of function narrative that's the scooby-doo he's actually reciting it right now

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:42.040
gosh darn it sorry I got to go back to that I got to be very careful where I click right about here

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:56.040
that isn't flu into people that has that so you know and I must say there's a question about how many times in life you're going to get this there was some amount of flu

01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:06.040
oh my ships here we go I'm sorry about this this is I should just really have it as a separate video I shouldn't have it in here like this

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:21.040
the idea that this significance the medical significance of a case of covid was in scale of things that we already had but here's what bothers me about that argument

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:32.040
let's say that this is somewhere in the neighborhood of flu in terms of of virulence the harm done to the human

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:47.040
okay well we had flu now somebody has jumped another thing that isn't flu into people that has that so you know and I must say there's a question about how many times

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:56.040
in life you're going to get this there was some amount of flu that you were going to get in a lifetime somebody's now introduced an alternative flavor of path

01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:07.040
it doesn't matter to me that it's not worse than flu the point is I was already going to get flu a certain number of times in life and now I have to get flu plus this other thing right that's a lot of sickness

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:18.040
right so the cost in terms of the human population suffering from cases of descendants of whatever the hell they did that's a massive loss to humanity even if it is no worse than flu

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:24.040
right it may not radically alter how you should feel about an individual additive to what else exists in the Malu

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:43.040
yes exactly exactly I will also say though I'm convinced based on what my family saw and experienced that there was a novel pathogen and the number of excellent doctors who saw this clinically

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:53.040
or in your case the pathologist that doesn't tell me what how many times do you think he needs to reiterate that he's sure there was a novel pathogen

01:58:53.040 --> 01:59:04.040
based on his family experience and other doctors and what we said five minutes ago and what I said ten minutes before that I'm sure there was a novel but I'm sure it I'm sure

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:15.040
I'm absolutely sure and don't forget in June of 2021 he was absolutely sure that prophylactic use of ivermectin was as good as a vaccine

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:29.040
and that prophylactic use of ivermectin was allowing him and Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch to hang out on his show and talk about all the subtleties of transfection I mean they never used that word but that's what they were talking about

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:40.040
and talk about how 60 days of everybody on ivermectin would essentially end the pandemic according to Steve and Brett

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:54.040
and so I guess he never got covid right because he was using ivermectin prophylactically virus it was right in other words I'm open to the possibility that the story that we've gotten about SARS-CoV-2 is not the story

01:59:54.040 --> 02:00:04.040
of the so-called pandemic right or it is part of the story but not the whole story but what I'm you know I'm open to anything in principle

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:14.040
but it's going to be a high bar to establish that there was no novel pathogen because I got sick with something not in the winter multiple times and it was pretty significant

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:30.040
what right wait what maybe not worse than a flu but bad wait what if I just done what my family saw say what experienced say what was the novel pathogen and the number of excellent doctors who what did he just say this clinically

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:44.040
or in your case as a pathologist that doesn't tell me what virus it was right in other words I'm open to the possibility that the story that we've gotten about SARS-CoV-2 is not the story

02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:53.040
of the so-called pandemic right or it is part of the story but not the whole story but what I'm you know I'm open to anything in principle

02:00:54.040 --> 02:01:04.040
but it's going to be a high bar to establish that there was no novel pathogen because I got sick with something not in the winter multiple times and it was pretty significant

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:22.040
holy crap maybe not worse than a flu but bad did he test what is he saying here he got sick not in the winter time multiple times that wasn't flu when did I hear about this what is this where did the prophylactic ivermectin go

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:46.040
did he stop wearing his bandana and goggles is that why he got sick can you see anything other than a liar here how is it possible to see anything other than a liar someone who will tell and say whatever words he thinks are necessary to say in order to

02:01:46.040 --> 02:02:00.040
drift however he griffs make whatever animal sounds he needs to make in order to make the ends meet I guess

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:15.040
I have a little bit of a personal issue with him yes because he lied to me for a long time

02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:29.040
with the help of other people and then he lied about me to other people and other people are lying to me and lying to other people about me

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:55.040
probably at his behest or other people's behest all basically part of the same team serving weaponized piles of money that are trying to help foreign powers destroy what's left of our republic and take what what's left of the wealth of America and turn it inside out sell it to the highest bidder

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:14.040
we're gonna wake up homeless on them on the on the land that our forefathers conquered because of people like Brett Weinstein who are posing as patriots fighting for our children's freedom when in reality he's nothing more than an immunomethologist

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:28.040
parroting the same mythology that got us here from the very beginning and evolving only as fast as his controllers want him to evolve

02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:45.040
it's different than a flu for me when I got it back in December of 2021 December 21 so I got I got to enjoy the Delta variant but in in terms of tested sequenced over blowing the testing that I got criticized in the media

02:03:45.040 --> 02:04:02.040
for lowering my cycle thresholds and then you can't do that I said well if you read federal standards a laboratory director can set ranges on test please beware that now he's talking about cycle thresholds but neither Brett nor Brian unfortunately is going to explain it as succinctly as Thomas Binder did

02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:20.040
that if you do a PCR test with 98% accuracy and 98% specificity excuse me and you do it on a population where the prevalence is zero every one of your positives is a false positive

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:37.040
and so there were lots of different ways to game the tests if there's a background there was a way to game positives and negatives if there is a specificity there's a way to game positives and negatives

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:57.040
and then those things could change if you are willing to believe Sashilatapova's coverage of of particoper and and the batches for different for different doses of the vaccine how can you possibly not think that the lateral flow tests that are produced

02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:11.040
in China the lateral the PCR tests that were produced in China the PCR tests that were produced in 200 different ways in America alone couldn't be manufactured in such a way to orchestrate

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:19.040
whatever they needed to orchestrate at that particular week or month

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:30.040
in their mind that they would be bizarrely unreliable maybe because they're bizarrely non homogenous

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:39.040
maybe because they're not all the same maybe because there's no consistency in anything that was purported to be consistent

02:05:39.040 --> 02:06:06.040
and that's why we will remain trapped our children will remain trapped and Brett Weinstein is in the business of perpetuating this mythology by passing it on to our young people his viewership

02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:23.040
I think he's hip or cool because he got pseudo fired by getting a $500,000 settlement from a Poe Dunk super leftist crazy teaching university in the in the backwoods of Oregon

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:37.040
but you know some dumpy newspaper reporter that knows more than a physician scientist lab director you can do that like yes I can

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:46.040
and so at the same they're the same they're absolutely the same you want to hear how the same they are let's listen to let's listen to

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:57.040
I want to listen to Paul off and talk all the same right now here it is it's all the same I'm going to speed it up make it faster

02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:04.040
so we don't have to listen to all of it so long but it's the same narrative right the same exact narrative

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:14.040
from micro TV this is beyond the noise episode number 35 recorded on March 27th 2024

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:18.040
I'm Vincent Radkin yellow and joining me today is your host Dr. Paul Offit

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:19.040
Hi Vincent

02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:29.040
this is the video version of Paul's column on sub stack called beyond the noise and today we're going to look at this week's column called why did the anti-vaccine movement tilt to the right

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:38.040
so I didn't know this what and you say this early on in the article what's the evidence said initially this anti-vaccine agen activists never actually had a political agenda

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:47.040
right so anti-vaccine activism was born of the first vaccine the smallpox vaccine you know created by Edward Jenner in the late 1700s and he used cow

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:55.040
and so how often have we heard this right how often have we heard this story maybe I can't play it while I'm streaming to YouTube I probably won't do that

02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:07.040
this thing right here this video is extraordinary because essentially Paul is going to tell a story of overwhelming you know we were our system was overwhelmed

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:21.040
the vaccine hesitancy has kind of moved to the right because of you know whatever we're the right the right side is now the bad side or something I don't know what his story is but essentially he tells the same story about a novel virus

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:36.040
that we didn't know what to do about and it's extraordinary how parallel their stories will be to that of Brett and Ryan and what they talked about and more importantly didn't talk about in that podcast

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:54.040
so let's just skip this let's just skip it because I don't want to waste the bandwidth and I should finish up before 4 o'clock so I can go to the gym so we have Paul Offit and we have Brett Weinstein basically agreeing on the aspects of the narrative that are most important which is a mystery

02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:15.040
and then excess deaths are caused by the mystery virus has mystery virus with mystery attributes that include clotting and whatever other symptoms are there because of ACE2 or because of a fear and cleavage cider you know whatever explanation that they want to give you the mystery virus equals excess deaths

02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:31.040
and neither neither neither the twib group nor the Dark Horse podcast is capable of distilling this down to the essential fear uncertainty and doubt that caused this they're not capable of talking about the newest thing that we've come to realize

02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:42.040
is a real crucial part of the early narrative which was the overuse of pulse oximeters to get people to go to the hospital that even FLCC was involved in

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:55.040
and using pulse oximeters to get people to go to the hospital where they would then be put on supplemental oxygen which would cause them to have the lung problems that would allow them to justify well the pain that you feel

02:09:55.040 --> 02:10:01.040
could be alleviated if we put you on a ventilator and bang there goes the deaths

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:21.040
they can't seem to sort through the do not resuscitate orders that are documented in New York as being contributing to this false idea that COVID was causing people to have heart attacks they don't seem to be able to actually enunciate that ventilators were not only misused but used to stop spread

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:29.040
they weren't just misused they were used to stop spread which is very very different if you have doctors that are so shit in their pants

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:42.040
little residents that are so scared by the military presence in their hospital that they are willing to tell people that because of this very dangerous virus we're going to ventilate you so that you don't spread it to other people in the hospital

02:10:42.040 --> 02:11:08.040
where's that part of the narrative for these guys after four years of trying to figure it out did they say that we didn't use antibiotics did they say that there was poor use of steroids did they mention remdesivir or mandazalam at all did they say anything about the opioid deaths that have contributed to this illusion of excess deaths

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:24.040
especially excess deaths below a certain age group did they say anything about the death certificate fraud that was documented since the beginning of the pandemic in California and New York and elsewhere did they talk about financial incentives that

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:41.040
encouraged hospital systems to call everything covid so that maybe strokes and other stuff would be called covid and so that people like Ryan Cole would be fooled into believing that the novel virus was doing novel things did they talk about that

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:57.040
even a possibility on their radar did they talk about the track and trace and all the money that was spent on it made people believe that something was really happening when it wasn't did they talk about that at all

02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:08.040
did they talk about how the closures made people think that something was happening and misled people and they talk about wearing bandanas to the store and advocating for closure

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:21.040
and advocating for people to stay away from their grandparents over Christmas might have caused this problem of course they didn't because bread encouraged people to stay home and not go to their grandma's house over the first Christmas of 2020

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:33.040
did they talk about PCR fraud did they talk about lateral flow test fraud no they were just bizarrely unreliable did they talk about sequencing fraud

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:48.040
they even talk about what sequencing might mean in terms of fraud that they use between 106 and 99 primer pairs to amplify the sequences that they call covid how many of those need to amplify in order for a sequence to be recorded did they talk about that

02:12:49.040 --> 02:13:04.040
so they basically didn't talk about anything that would help people to understand why having the position that there might not really have been a novel virus necessary or even present is a relevant discussion

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:11.040
they didn't talk about the idea that you know maybe we should have some Medicaid costs were avoided

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:26.040
they didn't talk about the fact that all these dead people all these old people in old folks homes that died all these Medicare people that came to the hospital and died they're not having any Medicare costs anymore

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:45.040
they're having that big insurance companies and think tanks since the late 90s were talking about how the impending doom of the boomers was going to bankrupt the United States system because Medicare is one of the single largest non-negotiable items on the American budget

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:58.040
that's interesting they didn't talk about that either did they talk about strict liability being a very simple legal principle that we should just apply to every pharmaceutical and this problem would be solved

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:08.040
did they talk about how actually the prep act is a violation of our seventh amendment because it doesn't allow us to sue for any damages over $20 did they talk about that

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:21.040
no unfortunately they didn't even though Brett's dad has been a lawyer since JFK did they talk about zero epidemiological evidence of spread

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:37.040
no they didn't so my overall rating of their podcast is of course not very good but what can we do when there is a limited spectrum of debate that people are obliged to stay within

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:48.040
there is a limited spectrum of debate that the weaponized pile of money that you serve obliges you to stay within and enforce well then you do it

02:14:48.040 --> 02:15:02.040
that's who Brett Weinstein is that's who the intellectual dark web is they're essentially responsible for allowing this to happen

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:16.040
all of these people have been pretending to contribute to something they didn't need to contribute to they have been pretending to contribute to a phenomenon that they aren't contributing to at all

02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:25.040
they have been pretending to be essential to something for which they are completely unnecessary

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:40.040
and that's why I love this video so much because not only did they accomplish that but they actually accomplished getting us to believe that they were essential that they were contributing to something that they were not contributing

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:50.040
to that they were important in a phenomenon for which they had no bearing and no imposition

02:15:50.040 --> 02:16:04.040
so what their job was was to participate in this illusion their job was to occupy our attention with questions that would not allow us to escape

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:17.040
that's why I want to talk to you about that guy he's just stopping the train and he's just helping the train start again focus on the lab leak and the spike protein

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:29.040
who's talking about lockdown focus on that guy who is sure that we might not have any immunity to this that Amino 101 might not apply to this virus because it's again a function virus

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:36.040
focus on that guy who's talking about 5G

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:51.040
how about you focus on the novel treatments that are being suppressed by your bad government focus on the leaks that we understand our people saying that we have to cover up hydroxychloroquine or cover up ivermectin or we have to run a really shitty trial

02:16:51.040 --> 02:17:04.040
so crappy that even a gas station attendant can understand how crappy it is and then we'll get them to argue about hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin and how they might work

02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:12.040
and how it's so unfair that doctors can't use something that was over the counter before 2020

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:17.040
so that they never question whether or not that guy's really doing anything

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:28.040
you never question whether there is a virus you already accept that there is one and you already accept that the relevant thing is to figure out where it came from

02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:35.040
why don't we get you to argue about double stranded DNA contamination in the shots that we rushed it

02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:44.040
so that you won't ask a question of whether transfection was criminally negligent in its purest form which is most certainly was

02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:54.040
why don't we get you to argue about a proposal that we leaked ourselves that almost assuredly is a slam dunk for how the pandemic started

02:17:54.040 --> 02:18:01.040
it's a RNA that we sprayed in a bad cave and then Mother Nature did the rest

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:13.040
I mean look it was a leaked proposal these people don't lie I mean it's a leak

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:23.040
first case scenario was in place team worst case scenario was recruited encouraged and is still in place now to make sure that the transfection is

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:31.040
and its damages forever conformed and conflated with that of the virus be it the spike protein or what have you

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:42.040
that mission is a virtually accomplished now with regard to the to the college kids to the young adults to the skilled TV watchers in the skilled social media users

02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:50.040
and that's the people we need to save from these people

02:18:50.040 --> 02:19:01.040
Specialization is always that if you analyze the politics of science the specializations should make you suspicious because it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:11.040
and it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be a little bit suspicious and that's sort of my starting my starting bias

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:18.040
A little suspicious is an understatement ladies and gentlemen the pandemic was created by writing papers about it

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:28.040
The pandemic was created by doing exercises and planning for it the pandemic was created by having people spread the illusion of a mass casualty event

02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:45.040
They may have used the Department of Defense to create those mass casualty events and then the pandemic was sustained by a team known by this stream as the worst case scenario team that perpetuated this narrative that a billion people could die if we didn't

02:19:45.040 --> 02:20:06.040
conform with lockdowns did not conform with masks you'll notice that not only did Brett Weinstein the eminent evolutionary biologist fumble the ball for a year and a half on masks but so did Kevin McCarron

02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:18.040
So did Steve Kersch so did everybody so did so did Jordan Peterson so did Ben Shapiro

02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:31.040
because they're all part of the same act the same theater that can be described as team worst case scenario they're doing it for the governance of the world

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:43.040
They have to keep doing it because they signed a piece of paper they're part of this it's a national security operation they know that they are protected by other people in the same operation

02:20:43.040 --> 02:21:00.040
And it was all to get us to surrender our sovereignty so that they could start using genetic technologies and testing genetic technologies on the population as a whole without need to pass through the FDA

02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:15.040
He's leaving the station this year with this election we are going to be given amount of chaos that will get very hard for us to get people to look backwards anymore to see what happened

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:24.040
If we get past this election and we try to get people to look back to Donald Trump whatever that was during the start of the pandemic it won't work

02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:36.040
We've had a lot of work to do over the next few months to get people off this train because people still believe that we've defeated disease in the past using vaccination people still believe the coronavirus is can pandemic

02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:53.040
People still believe that PCR positives are rare and asymptomatic spread is real people still believe that the variants are evidence of spread and a continuing evolution of a single virus and people still believe that we're spending money on real gain of function research

02:21:53.040 --> 02:22:10.040
It's not it's all just a mythology it's an elaborate stage actors with people planted in the audience that are brought up on stage and say oh my gosh I can't believe how gained a function this is

02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:27.040
And we are being made to fool our children because they want to avoid the Medicare costs that are coming they want to protect the growing skepticism we want to protect the vaccine schedule in America from the growing skepticism that was there before the pandemic

02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:36.040
They want to transition to a digital currency from the dead dollar but they want to extract all of the real value from the dollar system before they do it

02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:45.040
And leave all of the poor innocent good people holding the real dollars when the dollars become useless that's the plan

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:50.040
They want to transition to genetic vaccines for the entire population and make it a mandatory

02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:56.040
They want to confound the toxicity of viruses and transfections so that you never figure it out

02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:00.040
They want to transition the youth into the submission in full digital control

02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:09.040
They want to edify the mythology of pandemic viruses meaning they want to make sure that that mythology goes from being a lie to being the truth

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:16.040
They want to disrupt family formation for a whole generation they want to shorten the lifespan of billions of people especially old people

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:22.040
They want to kill billions of people with a gain of function virus, no

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:35.040
They want to destroy the cultural fabric of America and the rest absolutely and they want to help create the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:38.040
Absolutely they do

02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:46.040
The way out is biology ladies and gentlemen you want to advocate for a pause in all childhood vaccinations in America by comparing it to any other western nation

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:49.040
You want to advocate for strict liability because that's what we need

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:58.040
You want to advocate or investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events by following Jessica Hockett and sharing all of her posts and data

02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:03.040
You want to investigate the use of mass casualty events and transfection to create the illusion of the pandemic

02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:10.040
So you need to understand clones you need to understand what prions are and are not and we're going to work on that over the next few days and weeks

02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:19.040
Reclaim the sovereignty over your bodies and those of your children and encourage and elect people who are running on a platform where they're going to withdraw from the who in the UN entirely

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:23.040
I bet you can't find a candidate like that but we should find them soon

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:28.040
You want to see these medlers they won't mention the childhood vaccine schedule

02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:32.040
You want to see these medlers they won't say strict liability

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:37.040
They're happy to make fun of me they're happy to make fun of mark they're happy to claim victimhood and censorship

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:48.040
But they won't actually say anything useful like you know the use of deadly protocols to bring about a mass casualty events is a meaningful data point in understanding the pandemic they won't do it

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:57.040
They won't use the word transfection they won't talk about clones they attack people like me instead of teaching ideas and they are unable to summarize across the entire show

02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:10.040
Look at Brett after four years he still can't summarize across the entire show and still skips the entire slide that describes everything that actually happened

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:17.040
I got one more video for you and then we are done ladies and gentlemen why are they doing this because they've been lying to us

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.040
And they've been lying to each other they've been lying to the rich people of the world that were almost there

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:33.040
We've almost got it the AI is almost there the data is almost there the collections almost there just give us the people and the data and we will make you immortal

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:41.040
This is a new world order it's a lie that we are supposed to pass on to our children that we will not if I have anything to say about it

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:49.040
If Giga on biological gets funded the way it needs to be funded my family can live off this I'm going to be teaching for the rest of my life

02:25:49.040 --> 02:26:00.040
Because they would use machines to control us ladies and gentlemen that's all this is AI is not something that we need to be afraid of it's the men and the women

02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:10.040
That you are willing to use machines to control our opinions and our thoughts to govern us with lies

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:18.040
These people are the people we need to be afraid of hey I just found a video of Craig Venner where he's totally and completely honest are you ready to hear it?

02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:38.040
We understand less than 1% of the human genome so trying to be manipulating that and creating a variance of that I think is to me it's unethical to do because we're doing it without knowledge

02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:50.040
At some point it would be really good to get rid of diseases like case acts and other horrible debilitating diseases for young children

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:59.040
But we don't know enough about the human genome that knocking out genes we don't know what other functions they have

02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:13.040
Things like CRISPR are not the precise tool that they're made out of the press to be what's called off target effects they make changes in other genes

02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.040
We're just so not ready for doing this

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:20.040
What an interestingly frank thing for him to say

02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:26.040
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigo and biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:32.040
Please stop all transfections and humans. They are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary

02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:39.040
You can find me at Gigo and biological.com where you can also share and support the stream in a number of ways

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:46.040
If you have the means please do so otherwise if you can share this work so that the biology gets out there

02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:51.040
Pintramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.040
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity

02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:58.040
Thank you very much for joining me

02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:05.040
Again, you can find me at Gigo and biological.com and you can join me at Gigo and bio and stream.Gigo and bio

02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:10.040
If you want to watch the stream without cuts and without censorship and without algorithms

02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:22.040
This has been a presentation of the independent bright web and our peer tube is a first sort of attempt at building an intellectual or an independent bright web

02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:27.040
So please check out that website stream.Gigoome.Bio

02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:31.040
It's a lot of work that Tim's put in, Ted's put into it, excuse me Ted

02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.040
And it's a lot of, you know, talents and energy going into it

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:41.040
It's where I want to focus and eventually move to and get off Twitch and these other places

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:45.040
If we can get that thing working as well as possible

02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:50.040
Again, this has been Gigo and biological, a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:54.040
My name is Jonathan Cooey coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:58.040
And yeah, I'll see you again tomorrow

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:22.040
Don't forget the solar eclipse is on the 8th of April

02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:26.040
If you have a chance, please look at it, see it if you can

02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:31.040
It's going to be one of the longest ones ever and it's very close to my house

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.040
So if you really are going to be around and you want to meet, I would like that

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:41.040
So let me know via email or something like that, see you at the eclipse

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:46.040
And I got to go play some hoops, some hoops

02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.040
Yes, sweetheart

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:55.040
Can you play Rocky first?

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:56.040
Rocky?

02:29:56.040 --> 02:29:59.040
Okay, I'll put that one on right now and then I'll do the rest

02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:01.040
Thank you

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:31.040
You

02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:02.040
You

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.040
You

02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.040
You

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.040
You

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.040
You
