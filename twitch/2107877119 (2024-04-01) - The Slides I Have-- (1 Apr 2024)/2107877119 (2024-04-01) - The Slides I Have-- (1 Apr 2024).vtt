00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
I was trying to get something else going and I don't know I had to get also YouTube set up again and then I tried to do one more trick and then I had to add one more video if you can possibly imagine I needed to add one more video to the slide set that I said I was already done with

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Uhm, I see many Christmas. Here we go. I'm getting it going. Here we go

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And then

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I think truth is good to see

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
We're so busy lying we don't even recognize the truth that we want everybody to feel good

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
That's not the way life is

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
This episode is sponsored by Moink. That's Moo plus Frank

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
You know, I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, great, that's a good one to check right now, of course. Hello

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Let's get a camera in focus before we try to use it, shall we? Let's try that one out here

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Let's get this into focus on the little

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm a hood here. All right, that should work

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
And now if you can give me a sound check also

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
Sorry about that, you know, this this thing you got to be doing it every day or it doesn't it doesn't go all good

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Perfect place for a laugh track. Everybody is still following along

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Then yeah

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Try and push some people in the direction they should be moving

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
That's what we're going to try and do from now on. We're just going to try and push people in the direction they should be moving

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
That's my plan

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
It's hard to tune the sound on that bird because it's so sharp in one single frequency band there

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's better

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Just got my monitors in my ears. I apologize for that

04:19.560 --> 04:23.200
We are going to have a little new music that's probably going to bounce this

04:24.800 --> 04:30.600
This beginning off we're going to go back to Easter when I was about 12 years old

04:30.600 --> 04:32.600
This is so pretty

04:32.800 --> 04:36.200
This album was in my my Easter basket

04:40.800 --> 04:42.800
Oops

04:47.600 --> 04:52.600
Darn it I blew that song darn it, but anyway you get the idea

05:00.600 --> 05:17.880
Welcome to the show ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga on biological high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by

05:17.880 --> 05:23.280
Biologist if you're here for the first time you might be a skilled TV watcher trapped in social media

05:23.280 --> 05:27.760
If you've been here for a while you're at the top of the wave where we stay focused on the biology

05:27.760 --> 05:31.000
We don't take their bait on TV, and we love our neighbors

05:41.760 --> 05:44.680
You can find me at Giga on biological.com

05:45.760 --> 05:53.840
And Giga on that bio where we try to communicate with one another and scream that you don't buy us where you should be watching this right now

05:53.840 --> 05:55.840
So you can listen to the music

05:57.760 --> 06:00.240
Because it'll get bounced on every other platform

06:11.440 --> 06:19.160
Some people might argue is peak peak Western civilization was around right around well then halo

06:20.560 --> 06:22.560
1984 I don't know what to say

06:28.720 --> 06:35.720
Thank you to all my subscribers people are sub-stack people who've been sending in single donations makes this independent right with

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
presentation possible

06:45.480 --> 06:48.040
We're gonna turn it up for you then I am canvas

06:57.760 --> 06:59.760
I

06:59.760 --> 07:01.760
I

07:23.360 --> 07:27.560
Hey, hope got me live. I'm very excited about that good to see you there. Hope

07:27.560 --> 07:30.200
Thanks for being in the chat

07:57.560 --> 07:59.560
I

07:59.560 --> 08:27.880
Heard you play it live there mark

08:27.880 --> 08:32.920
I actually did I knew exactly what you were doing, and I made a snide comment in your chat

08:32.920 --> 08:38.400
Thank you very much for playing a little bit of Van Halen for me last night for some reason or another

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
I

08:42.000 --> 08:49.280
Haven't been able to pick up my guitar lately and it's kind of because Nathan my friend who passed away late last year to a

08:49.480 --> 08:51.480
sudden aneurysm

08:52.040 --> 08:56.640
Was my guitar teacher in college and it's just stupid, but I

08:58.400 --> 09:03.400
Don't know I'm so I've been goofing around with my with my daughter's piano upstairs

09:03.400 --> 09:07.960
And with my I have a mini keyboard in front of me to play like stupid things, you know like

09:09.440 --> 09:13.760
I've been goofing around with that all the time in the background and

09:14.800 --> 09:19.480
Now I've been pricing full-size keyboards because of of listening to

09:20.000 --> 09:23.920
Old music and playing old songs with my with my daughter

09:23.920 --> 09:28.120
It's amazing how many things are still in my fingers or in my cerebellum. I guess

09:29.440 --> 09:35.120
All kinds of songs I learned Star Wars once on the piano and can totally play it

09:35.120 --> 09:37.120
It just kind of came out of me yesterday

09:37.120 --> 09:39.120
And another one that came out of me was

09:45.600 --> 09:51.120
And so I was upstairs late like at three in the morning a couple days ago

09:51.880 --> 09:57.840
Re-trying to relearn that song and so then I was also listening to it and it was just yeah anyway

09:58.920 --> 10:02.800
keyboards are expensive though, so that's a little bit something I got to put

10:03.560 --> 10:06.960
Put some feelers out there on Craigslist if anybody's got a Nord

10:07.360 --> 10:12.400
Three compact or something like that laying around in the closet. They want to send me I'd be happy to take it

10:12.400 --> 10:18.000
But for now I'm just gonna work with the the piano that we have a little Casio keyboard

10:18.000 --> 10:20.400
That's got weighted keys upstairs for my daughter

10:21.120 --> 10:26.320
I think I got that for a hundred dollars on Craigslist and that's a pretty decent thing to practice on and for for the stream

10:26.320 --> 10:32.320
I don't need anything in front of me right now to distract me ladies and gentlemen welcome to giga-owned biological a high-resistance

10:32.920 --> 10:36.960
Hello noise information brief brought to you by a biologist. My name is Jonathan Cooey

10:36.960 --> 10:43.560
I am that biologist coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This is the back of my garage. It's April 1st

10:44.200 --> 10:50.080
It doesn't really mean much to me. I've never really been a big April 1st guy. It always seems like kind of a

10:50.920 --> 10:52.920
weird

10:52.920 --> 10:53.880
I

10:53.880 --> 11:01.360
Don't know. It just seemed like always an odd holiday and I always I never really understood it. I I understand why people get into it

11:02.080 --> 11:06.840
I guess you get to mess with people or something. I don't know but for me

11:07.640 --> 11:09.640
I

11:10.880 --> 11:12.440
Don't know how to say it any other way

11:12.440 --> 11:19.840
But I've been lied to way too often in my life from a very young age to find lying of really any kind funny

11:20.240 --> 11:25.440
In fact, I think Mark kind of feels the same way. I know my wife can't even lie. That's her problem

11:25.440 --> 11:33.080
Is it you she can't even light it? You know something like oh, I didn't see that the coupon was expired

11:33.080 --> 11:35.920
I'm sorry, you know, she can't even tell a lie like that. So

11:36.640 --> 11:43.320
When Mark and I did that stream a long time ago where we were both wearing sunglasses and kind of making fun of other people on the internet by

11:43.320 --> 11:46.440
By wearing a disguise and pretending we weren't who we were

11:46.720 --> 11:53.480
We already didn't like that and we've I've talked with other people about, you know

11:55.200 --> 12:01.640
Ways that we could catch people if we just you know, maybe we should just fake like we're having an argument or maybe I

12:01.920 --> 12:06.920
Should pretend that I'm skeptical of you and then maybe we'll see what people do and

12:08.000 --> 12:10.640
it it always feels wrong because I

12:11.720 --> 12:15.440
Feel like I'm I'm not I'm not going on stage here

12:15.840 --> 12:23.520
I'm making a phone call or I'm I'm stepping in front of a I don't like classroom because it implies some

12:24.360 --> 12:25.920
hierarchy

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
But imagine it's an open mic

12:29.360 --> 12:35.320
Which it kind of is anytime I want to I can push that button and and and I'm on and if I do the right

12:35.480 --> 12:39.840
Cut and paste and everything I'll be on on on like four different

12:40.640 --> 12:45.880
Four different platforms live. So it's kind of like it's like a live microphone

12:45.880 --> 12:51.440
Just stand in here in the back of my house whenever I decide to push the button. It'll be on

12:52.440 --> 12:58.560
And you might think some people might think or want you to believe that that's some kind of easy

12:59.160 --> 13:03.000
thing to just step in front of and do but it's not and

13:05.600 --> 13:07.360
Like it or not

13:07.400 --> 13:12.120
There are people who are doing it because they're paid to do it because they're part of a a

13:13.680 --> 13:20.360
concerted effort an intelligent manipulation of your habits and your opinions and

13:21.960 --> 13:25.560
You cannot underestimate how many people are not like me and

13:26.280 --> 13:28.000
I don't want to toot my own horn

13:28.000 --> 13:33.320
But at some point in order for my family to eat and for our rent to get paid. I have to toot my own horn

13:33.320 --> 13:36.160
I don't have a sponsor. I don't have a toothpaste

13:36.240 --> 13:40.880
I'm not asking you to buy somebody's mail-in meat

13:44.320 --> 13:49.520
I've had jobs working for a Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and children's health defense

13:49.520 --> 13:55.560
But by sticking to my integrity and my principles I've lost those positions those positions have been ended

13:57.920 --> 14:04.120
But you can look it up you can see the videos that I've done you can find the things that have been said about me

14:04.120 --> 14:07.800
You can find that book and read what I say in that book

14:07.800 --> 14:13.640
What's quoted of me in that book? You can find a track record that if I do say so myself is

14:14.360 --> 14:16.360
unblemished

14:16.720 --> 14:23.240
Because when I've gotten things wrong, I've admitted it when I've been questioning things. I've I've let everyone know

14:24.760 --> 14:25.480
and

14:25.480 --> 14:29.440
I've tried desperately to convey a level of uncertainty

14:30.320 --> 14:36.080
in the story that's on television in the story that's on social media and a certainty about the

14:38.160 --> 14:40.160
The sacred biology

14:41.560 --> 14:48.600
That makes me feel good about the skepticism of the of the mainstream narrative and these people have been doing it for decades

14:48.600 --> 14:50.600
This is a quote from

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
1924

14:53.560 --> 14:58.440
Before the advent of all of these nasty things that we allow

14:59.000 --> 15:01.360
To occupy any of our attention

15:03.600 --> 15:10.880
The tagline on giga-owned biological calm your consciousness is prime real estate is not a joke your attention

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
is prime real estate

15:14.840 --> 15:16.840
If you have only 15

15:17.400 --> 15:24.320
Thoughts in a day think about this for a second if you only have 15 thoughts in a day and Twitter can occupy

15:24.560 --> 15:26.560
14 of them. How much are you gonna get done?

15:27.320 --> 15:34.080
Now the math is a little bit more complicated than that you have about 39,000 thoughts a day

15:35.400 --> 15:41.400
But every time you pick up your phone every time you click on that site every time you hit the scroll wheel you are allowing

15:42.480 --> 15:44.040
allowing

15:44.040 --> 15:49.720
some of those thoughts to be wasted and occupied by the spinning of a wheel and

15:50.520 --> 15:56.080
That wheel is not random. It is a it is a wheel which has been finely tuned

15:57.560 --> 16:02.840
To manipulate your conscious and intelligent habits and opinions

16:07.560 --> 16:15.480
And that's how the principle of informed consent has been ignored for years and years and years and how it will continue to be ignored

16:15.840 --> 16:20.200
Until each and every one of us makes a conscious effort to wake up young people

16:20.200 --> 16:22.720
The

16:22.720 --> 16:29.720
Terrifying conclusion that I've come to over the Easter weekend taking a pause from this trying to step back a little bit from this open mic

16:31.080 --> 16:33.440
Try and think about what I really want to accomplish in

16:34.000 --> 16:39.760
2024 it is to lay the groundwork of inspiration for the next generation because that's all we've got

16:41.800 --> 16:45.480
We are up against not billionaires but trillionaires as

16:46.120 --> 16:53.080
Thomas Binder said so wisely on my in my interview with him a few days ago if you haven't seen it, please watch it

16:55.120 --> 16:57.120
The trillionaires are out there

16:58.200 --> 17:05.400
The trillionaires is the table that we need to be worried about the people that are really just absolutely separate from us

17:06.840 --> 17:11.800
And we are not going to come out from under the yoke of trillionaires

17:12.440 --> 17:18.600
Over them over the course of a podcast or over the course of a couple election cycles

17:18.600 --> 17:20.600
That's not how this is going to happen

17:22.600 --> 17:27.720
How it's going to happen is that the next generation is more skeptical of this

17:28.920 --> 17:30.440
mythology

17:30.440 --> 17:32.920
Then our generation was able to muster

17:33.720 --> 17:35.720
So that their kids

17:35.960 --> 17:37.960
Can break free?

17:38.360 --> 17:42.680
That's I think what we're looking at here. I think if we want to be realistic we need to really

17:43.880 --> 17:46.040
That that will require us then to all

17:47.880 --> 17:49.880
Let go a little bit

17:50.600 --> 17:52.600
And to surrender

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Got to be a leaf in the stream so to speak

17:59.240 --> 18:02.760
I've been thinking all the time that there's just one more podcast

18:02.840 --> 18:07.080
Just one if I just get all the words right or if I just write that one sub stack

18:08.680 --> 18:10.680
It's

18:10.680 --> 18:14.440
It's not going to be one person. It's not going to be one piece of prose

18:14.440 --> 18:17.240
It's not going to be one advertisement on the super bowl

18:19.320 --> 18:23.560
It's going to be one generation after the next generation after the next generation

18:24.040 --> 18:28.840
Constantly fighting for the sacred of biology the sacred of who we are as people

18:29.640 --> 18:31.560
as a species

18:31.560 --> 18:33.560
As a member of our ecosystem

18:35.480 --> 18:37.480
On this little rock

18:37.960 --> 18:39.960
But

18:41.480 --> 18:45.960
Right now the situation is what you see in this cartoon here over here here here

18:48.360 --> 18:55.480
It's a bunch of people unhealthy on the couch surrendering their conscious attention

18:57.720 --> 19:00.120
To screens including now what you're doing

19:01.720 --> 19:05.880
But because I'm live because I'm talking to you because I can read the chat

19:05.960 --> 19:08.600
There's more than that going on here. It might be

19:09.240 --> 19:13.800
The only way that enough people can come together in the quickest time

19:14.840 --> 19:17.960
So that it could be less than a generation that we turn this around

19:19.080 --> 19:21.080
It's possible

19:22.040 --> 19:24.680
But we're going to have to believe in power is much bigger than us

19:26.840 --> 19:29.560
We're going to have to turn to a few of the things that

19:30.760 --> 19:33.160
You know when people are really in this deep

19:33.400 --> 19:35.800
They generally speaking turn to prayer

19:38.280 --> 19:43.640
And we're all going to have to come to terms with the fact that that this is a spiritual battle

19:43.720 --> 19:47.080
Unfortunately as much as I want it to be about biology

19:48.280 --> 19:52.440
And as much as I'm interested in the biology, this is a spiritual battle

19:54.840 --> 19:56.600
Because that's what

19:56.600 --> 20:02.840
That sacred biology that irreducible complexity that beauty that you can see or you can't see when you look out

20:02.840 --> 20:04.840
Your window

20:06.760 --> 20:11.720
That that's that's what we're trying to restore in our children their ability to see that

20:12.520 --> 20:18.120
To see themselves in the mirror as the sacred beings that they are the see the world as the sacred place that it is

20:19.560 --> 20:22.360
Something that we were given stewardship over instead of

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
Dominion

20:27.000 --> 20:30.280
And so it's tough we got a long road ahead of us. It's April 1st

20:30.920 --> 20:32.520
2024

20:32.520 --> 20:34.520
And my plan is to raise

20:35.000 --> 20:39.560
Enough money with this stream and teaching biology on this stream to feed my family

20:40.040 --> 20:41.800
I don't know if that's a

20:41.800 --> 20:45.000
Realistic perspective to take right now. It's not right now

20:45.080 --> 20:49.000
I have about 120 subscribers and that amounts to about a hundred

20:49.240 --> 20:51.320
$1,200 a month

20:51.320 --> 20:53.320
Which doesn't even cover half of our rent

20:54.600 --> 20:59.480
And so we've got savings for about a month and a half and then we're going to have to find another plan

20:59.480 --> 21:01.480
And we're always looking for another plan

21:02.920 --> 21:07.640
But in the coming weeks, I need you to pay very close attention to the landmarks that we hit

21:08.520 --> 21:11.640
I need very you to pay very close attention to the kinds of

21:12.280 --> 21:16.680
Output that we put out and I need you to pay very close attention to what other people are doing

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
Because then you can see the pattern

21:21.720 --> 21:28.760
Then you will be able to see the pattern and behavior that will allow you to act appropriately to set your

21:29.480 --> 21:31.480
mind appropriately

21:32.200 --> 21:37.720
And I hope that enough people will then decide that my stream is the one that's worth sharing

21:39.160 --> 21:44.520
My stream is the one that is worth promoting when they promote something on facebook or promote something on

21:45.320 --> 21:47.800
On wherever they promote it. They'll promote giggle

21:50.040 --> 21:56.440
That's where we need to get we need to get to 10,000 views or a hundred thousand views and a thousand subscribers

21:56.520 --> 22:01.320
That's it a thousand paid subscribers and I will put on a

22:02.520 --> 22:05.720
A few hours every day for the rest of my life

22:06.520 --> 22:12.200
And that's not a small promise. It's a big promise because three hours a day every day would be a lot of work

22:15.240 --> 22:23.800
But that's what i'm going for because I think that's the only way that we get we got to get lots of lights like this lots of bonfires burning in the wilderness

22:24.760 --> 22:28.360
We'll get us out of this and giga ohm is going to be one of those bonfires and you

22:28.920 --> 22:32.840
Know a couple other fires that are burning right now that need your support

22:34.360 --> 22:40.840
And you know a lot of other fires that are burning wildly because of the amount of support that they get that are doing nothing

22:41.880 --> 22:44.520
They're burning in the middle of a concrete parking lot

22:45.960 --> 22:47.960
Doing nothing but consuming

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
I

22:50.440 --> 22:52.680
People's hard-earned money being wasted

22:54.440 --> 22:59.160
By steve kersh's vaccine safety research foundation. What a joke

23:00.920 --> 23:07.960
Think about how much money is being wasted there right alongside the skull foundation that donates to them and pbs

23:07.960 --> 23:09.960
news hour

23:12.440 --> 23:16.040
Once you start to really realize how much hard earned

23:16.840 --> 23:21.480
Working persons working families money is being burnt up by these people

23:23.560 --> 23:29.320
Who pay themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars a year give themselves wonderful insurance

23:30.680 --> 23:35.400
And then what do they do really what are the results of their work

23:36.280 --> 23:38.280
It

23:41.720 --> 23:48.680
It's frustrating because all of these people are united in the same lie they are united in the same story

23:50.520 --> 23:57.640
And it's frustrating because like a corporate tug of war it doesn't take that many people to fake it

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
To sabotage the whole team

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
And so we are in a situation

24:03.800 --> 24:11.640
Where there could be many people many many people who mean well who are still stuck halfway between scooby-doo

24:12.520 --> 24:14.520
and the magic show audience

24:16.200 --> 24:23.800
Not sure who to trust because I saw him come out of the audience, but I guess he it seems weird that he's on stage

24:24.600 --> 24:28.920
But they still can't quite pull their head out of this illusion of consensus

24:31.160 --> 24:34.520
And so we've got to keep hammer and one by one

24:34.520 --> 24:36.360
We're going to pull people out of this theater

24:36.360 --> 24:43.160
We're going to make people realize that the people that the magician pulled on stage from the audience were all in on it

24:44.280 --> 24:52.040
And that's why they agree even when they come off stage and sit back down. They agree. Wow. That's just crazy. I can't believe it

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
And so this ongoing

24:57.160 --> 25:02.120
RNA pandemic has essentially become a faith in a novel virus that none of them will question

25:02.680 --> 25:07.560
All of them seek re reinforcement of they'll say but you also got sick right

25:08.040 --> 25:12.360
You also remember using ibramectin and having your ears pop don't you

25:16.360 --> 25:23.000
That's what's happening here is this faith in a novel virus has continued to be groomed into everyone's head

25:24.440 --> 25:26.440
for five years

25:27.560 --> 25:31.480
While these people pretend to try and do something about it

25:31.480 --> 25:35.560
But they're not doing anything about the faith in this novel biology

25:35.560 --> 25:40.200
No one's questioning how an RNA might be able to go from being a few molecules

25:40.840 --> 25:42.840
in a mark put market

25:42.840 --> 25:48.200
to being a few trillion but god zillion molecules in every lung in america

25:48.600 --> 25:52.280
is now in what did we hear recently fish in

25:53.160 --> 25:54.360
in in

25:54.360 --> 25:59.720
wisconsin the walleye or something have coronaviruses that right now don't infect humans really

26:02.120 --> 26:08.200
And we're still talking we're still talking about the heroes that found out about the fear and cleavage site, you know

26:08.680 --> 26:10.680
like james lion's wiler

26:13.960 --> 26:14.920
Or

26:14.920 --> 26:16.040
Or

26:16.040 --> 26:21.640
Or dan seratkin son of carl seratkin at los alamos laboratories

26:22.280 --> 26:26.600
Working on sequencing algorithms. Yeah, okay, that makes sense

26:27.080 --> 26:28.120
um

26:28.120 --> 26:32.280
Who else you knew about the fear and cleavage site and talked about it? Oh some australian guy

26:33.320 --> 26:34.840
and uh

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
I don't know a few other people

26:36.840 --> 26:40.920
Yuri dagan some russian living in canada working on longevity

26:41.480 --> 26:43.800
Sure, that makes total sense. Why not?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
That's

26:49.240 --> 26:57.000
That's where we are we are chasing a faith in a novel biology and we have a whole bunch of what amount to

26:57.720 --> 27:02.040
street preachers on the internet also with open mics

27:04.680 --> 27:06.440
but instead of

27:06.440 --> 27:13.000
Claiming uncertainty and fighting against a narrative which is being given to us by governments all around the world

27:13.080 --> 27:15.960
Instead of fighting against it. They are essentially fortifying

27:17.480 --> 27:20.120
They are essentially providing narrative cover

27:20.760 --> 27:27.240
And plausible deniability to all of these these state actors and non government actors

27:28.680 --> 27:32.040
Who have purported to save us from the worst case scenario

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
Get covered from these people

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Because the only

27:39.000 --> 27:44.280
Place to go outside of this faith in a novel biology is these

27:45.000 --> 27:48.120
These other alternative interpretations of it

27:48.760 --> 27:51.800
Which tend to be closer to a worst case scenario

27:52.280 --> 27:55.960
Which will push people back to the original place that they're supposed to be

27:57.480 --> 28:00.040
That's how the game has been played from the very beginning

28:00.040 --> 28:03.400
Unfortunately, I was a ping pong ball on their table

28:05.320 --> 28:07.320
And I didn't know it

28:07.960 --> 28:11.000
Even after I thought hey, why why did you hit me with that paddle?

28:11.000 --> 28:16.360
I still didn't understand it and then I saw the net go underneath me and I my face hit the table

28:16.760 --> 28:18.760
And then another paddle hit me

28:19.000 --> 28:22.280
And I looked at that other person. I was like, why did you hit me with that paddle?

28:22.280 --> 28:23.640
I trusted you

28:23.640 --> 28:27.800
And then I tumbled over the net again and landed on the other side and bang

28:27.800 --> 28:31.320
I got hit in the back of the head and I looked around like what did what did you hit me for?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.880
And

28:33.880 --> 28:39.640
It took me about four or five points before I realized wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm the ping pong ball here

28:41.720 --> 28:45.080
And unfortunately, there are a lot of people who are still being played

28:48.440 --> 28:51.800
And instead of reacting to the people that are holding that paddle

28:53.240 --> 28:55.240
They're trying to participate in

28:56.200 --> 28:58.440
In influencing the game, I guess or something

28:59.400 --> 29:01.800
They have no idea how they have been used

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
But I need

29:06.360 --> 29:09.640
We need progress in understanding this as a faith

29:10.360 --> 29:17.800
And I think one of the best ways to hit at this as a faith is to understand that the faith is based on data of which we have none

29:18.520 --> 29:20.520
before 2020

29:21.480 --> 29:27.160
It is equivalent to saying that we had no cars before 2020

29:28.040 --> 29:31.640
And then just stick into that lie like nobody's business

29:33.320 --> 29:37.720
Go on tv and you say well people think that we had cars, but those weren't really cars

29:37.720 --> 29:42.120
They were they were something else what we have now in our garage our cars

29:43.160 --> 29:47.000
And you can test for cars with these new tests that we have

29:47.960 --> 29:53.320
Yeah, but I mean we don't have any data to show these tests don't mean that the cars weren't there before

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
Yes, they do the tests show

29:56.440 --> 30:02.520
These sequences demonstrate that these sequences couldn't have been found before but no they don't because

30:03.160 --> 30:07.160
The cars were could have been in our garage before you just never told us to look

30:08.760 --> 30:11.480
And while that analogy may seem a little bit

30:12.600 --> 30:14.600
weak, it's actually perfect

30:15.400 --> 30:20.360
Because the amount of data that we've been told there are millions and millions of sequences which

30:21.080 --> 30:24.040
represent just a small fraction of the total number

30:24.920 --> 30:29.320
Of sequences that could be in theory available if we were to measure all of them

30:31.080 --> 30:36.600
Implying that all of those sequences started from a point in Woola

30:37.720 --> 30:43.720
Maybe it was in october of 2019, but they lied about when they covered it up for a little while

30:44.760 --> 30:49.960
Well, michael calahan was running around in the behind the scenes texting with Robert Malone

30:50.760 --> 30:56.200
But essentially it all started in sometime in 2019 and now we have this

30:56.760 --> 30:58.120
you know

30:58.120 --> 30:59.640
blanket of

30:59.640 --> 31:06.920
Of genetic information which covers the globe and is in the in the mucosa of almost every mammal that we've tested

31:09.320 --> 31:14.040
That is a faith in a biological phenomenon that can only be a lie

31:14.840 --> 31:20.680
It is very much equivalent to them having told us that there were no cars

31:22.360 --> 31:29.240
Before 2020 and now there's a new car and we can find it in almost every garage that we test

31:35.240 --> 31:38.040
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to understand it for what it is

31:38.440 --> 31:47.400
It is a lie it is a lie that they agreed to tell from very early on because worst case scenario is worst case scenario

31:47.480 --> 31:54.920
And so like event 201 drilled like dark winter drilled like the spars pandemic document describes

31:55.480 --> 32:01.400
Like all of these previous tabletop exercise described a faith is required

32:01.720 --> 32:03.400
And

32:03.400 --> 32:09.720
Never in history did they have the level of control over media and control over what people saw then they did

32:10.200 --> 32:13.000
When they declared a 15 30 day

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Lockdown and school closure

32:24.120 --> 32:28.840
And because the faith is a lie staging the pandemic required murder

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
I know people don't like me to use that word

32:34.520 --> 32:40.120
People tell me that i'm going to lose support if I keep using that word murder don't call it murder

32:41.080 --> 32:43.080
What is it then?

32:44.280 --> 32:50.040
What is it if people decide that we need to get rid of a few people because

32:50.840 --> 32:54.520
Medicare costs are going to become too drastic and we're going to tell people

32:55.160 --> 33:01.160
That there is a virus spreading because we also can use that narrative to do a lot of things that we've wanted to do

33:01.160 --> 33:03.160
for a while

33:05.240 --> 33:11.400
And so we're going to get like four birds with one stone we're going to get rid of this impending medicare medicaid doom

33:12.760 --> 33:13.960
We're going to

33:13.960 --> 33:19.800
Seed an untouchable pandemic narrative that we have complete control over without having to do anything really

33:20.200 --> 33:23.000
We're going to use it to attack china with a with a

33:23.640 --> 33:25.480
with a

33:25.480 --> 33:30.200
A campaign of lies, but then we're going to turn around and actually use it to attack our own citizens

33:30.200 --> 33:35.880
Because that's what we really want to do. We want to undermine the last bastion of a republic

33:36.360 --> 33:38.360
In the world the united states of american

33:38.360 --> 33:42.600
We're cooperating with people who are interested in doing that. Who would that be?

33:43.480 --> 33:46.440
Well, it would be billionaires. It would be trillionaires

33:48.440 --> 33:50.200
And that's the insight that I think

33:50.760 --> 33:54.200
Thomas binder really brought out in in some of the the more

33:55.880 --> 33:57.880
Let's say home run parts of his talk

33:58.680 --> 34:02.200
The beauty of that is that there really is

34:03.080 --> 34:09.960
There really are rather people in the world who think of us as different think of us as cattle and don't have any problem

34:11.880 --> 34:19.240
Staging an operation in order to govern us just like they staged the operation on 9 11

34:21.400 --> 34:23.800
They don't have any problem with that

34:23.880 --> 34:25.400
And

34:25.400 --> 34:30.120
Now if you think the truth is available on television with regard to the middle east

34:30.600 --> 34:36.760
Here again buying into the same kind of mythology the same governing mechanism that was first described

34:37.240 --> 34:40.440
By edward bernays in that beautiful book propaganda

34:42.200 --> 34:47.560
It is a conscious and intelligent manipulation of our opinions and habits. What better way to do it

34:49.400 --> 34:52.040
Than full on staging. What is history?

34:54.440 --> 35:01.640
And then having us run around like chickens with our heads cut off trying to figure out what just happened when we're the whole world is a stage

35:04.040 --> 35:08.520
And they are performing a theater in order for us to be governed by it

35:08.520 --> 35:14.120
And so by debating the theater we have been scooby-doo. We've been fooled into solving a mystery

35:14.120 --> 35:19.640
We've been fooled into unmasking the very bad guys that they wanted us to unmask in the first place

35:19.640 --> 35:21.080
Someone's lying

35:21.080 --> 35:23.080
You know, you can sort of feel it in people

35:24.520 --> 35:27.400
And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

35:27.800 --> 35:31.320
You know, I'm I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

35:31.720 --> 35:34.680
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

35:38.680 --> 35:40.680
He's a liar

35:41.960 --> 35:44.280
And we are governed by liars

35:44.920 --> 35:50.600
You want to call it top secret. You want to call it classified information. You want to call it being read in

35:51.080 --> 35:54.040
You want to call it the look away doctrine you call whatever you want

36:00.680 --> 36:02.840
But that's how they got us

36:02.840 --> 36:10.040
And there are people in front of us elevated on social media artificially by simply programming it right in

36:11.400 --> 36:16.360
In order to make sure that we stay trapped within a limited spectrum of debate

36:16.360 --> 36:20.520
Which will not allow us to escape which will not allow our children to escape

36:20.920 --> 36:22.920
And we need to resist that

36:26.120 --> 36:29.480
Scientific questions, I think are very hard to get a handle on

36:29.960 --> 36:34.920
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in

36:35.800 --> 36:40.760
There's simply too much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it

36:40.760 --> 36:41.880
and so

36:41.880 --> 36:48.360
You know, and so the the and so in this world of extreme hyper specialization where it's narrower and narrower

36:48.520 --> 36:49.560
Um

36:49.560 --> 36:55.880
Subsets of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are the string theorists talking about how great string theories

36:55.880 --> 37:00.600
The cancer researchers talking about how they're just about to cure cancer the quantum computer researchers

37:00.920 --> 37:02.840
Are just about to build you know quantum computer

37:02.840 --> 37:07.320
There will be a massive breakthrough and then if you were to say that all these fields not much is happening

37:07.880 --> 37:11.240
People just don't have the authority for this. This is somehow a very different

37:11.800 --> 37:17.720
Feel for science or knowledge than you would have had in 1800 or even in

37:18.360 --> 37:23.880
1800 you know, 1800 greater could still understand just about everything right 1900 hillbird could still understand

37:24.360 --> 37:26.360
just about all of mathematics

37:26.360 --> 37:29.640
And uh, and so the sort of um this sort of specialization

37:30.040 --> 37:33.400
I think has made it a much harder question to get a handle on

37:34.920 --> 37:43.720
So the reason why I keep playing this video over and over again is because I wanted to sink into all of my dedicated followers and watchers

37:44.600 --> 37:46.600
That this is a lie

37:47.320 --> 37:49.400
That's why I keep those big words over there

37:50.040 --> 37:55.080
He's misleading the young with this statement because he starts out by saying there's so much knowledge

37:55.080 --> 37:58.760
There's too much knowledge for anybody to understand it all

37:59.800 --> 38:03.160
And I would just flat out disagree with that

38:03.960 --> 38:05.960
I don't think that's realistic

38:06.840 --> 38:08.840
I don't think that's where we are

38:09.240 --> 38:11.240
I don't think that that

38:12.040 --> 38:14.040
No, I don't believe that

38:14.920 --> 38:18.520
You want to hear an incredible story of learning

38:19.240 --> 38:27.880
Go listen to Maya Angelou describe what happened to her after she was raped when she was seven years old and stopped talking for five years

38:29.080 --> 38:32.440
And why she is and became who she was

38:34.440 --> 38:38.520
The human mind is capable of amazing unbelievable feats

38:39.480 --> 38:42.760
That are virtually untapped in our culture

38:44.840 --> 38:51.320
One of the reasons why I so desperately want this giga-owned biological thing to work out is because

38:51.720 --> 38:54.600
If it does work out, we will be homeschooling our children

38:55.960 --> 39:01.800
And I want that more than anything except for wanting to coach basketball

39:01.800 --> 39:05.480
Which I want to do more than anything else in the world now

39:07.080 --> 39:09.080
I have things that I want to do

39:09.080 --> 39:10.200
I have

39:10.200 --> 39:16.200
Ideas of where I want to go. I have lots of things to teach every year to high schoolers every year

39:16.680 --> 39:20.280
To adults every year and I'm ready to do it for the rest of my life

39:20.680 --> 39:23.320
Because people like this are misleading our young people

39:24.280 --> 39:29.880
Into believing what is created in universities is knowledge rather than noise

39:32.120 --> 39:35.240
And this illusion needs to be broken

39:35.800 --> 39:40.360
And I think one of the ways one of the ways that one of the ways that we might be able to win

39:40.920 --> 39:46.440
Is if we could encourage young people to skip out on college for five years

39:47.400 --> 39:50.600
Until the university system itself just collapses

39:52.520 --> 39:57.640
I don't know what they will do. That's the problem. I don't know where to where to send them. I don't know what for them to do

39:58.920 --> 40:03.720
Get a job at a restaurant close to a beach and take up surfing for five years

40:04.120 --> 40:08.440
Would be great if I could get them all to do that. I don't think that's a realistic goal

40:08.520 --> 40:09.640
but

40:09.640 --> 40:14.600
Get them to find part-time jobs full-time jobs live with their parents take care of their parents something

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Don't go to university

40:19.720 --> 40:25.240
Don't spend your parents money on university and even worse don't take out

40:25.880 --> 40:29.720
Government funded eight percent student loans to go to university

40:30.440 --> 40:32.440
Just stop

40:34.040 --> 40:35.640
And very quickly

40:35.640 --> 40:41.800
This noise factory this ivory tower will collapse and if it doesn't and listen carefully

40:42.120 --> 40:45.080
If it doesn't then the illusion will be shattered

40:46.520 --> 40:53.800
And you will find out exactly what universities are which are a giant pile of overpaid bureaucrats

40:54.760 --> 40:59.400
That are using faculty and students as cattle and slavery

40:59.720 --> 41:01.720
and

41:02.680 --> 41:06.840
Then at the same time allowing the system to turn and eat those very

41:07.320 --> 41:10.600
those very cattle for dinner and confuse them of being

41:11.080 --> 41:18.280
The the irresponsible ones for taking out student loans and going to college and wow now you want assistance with them

41:18.280 --> 41:20.120
That's pretty pathetic

41:20.120 --> 41:25.720
While they pay deans as much as they pay football coaches and both of which are way overpaid

41:29.720 --> 41:33.640
I'd coach a college basketball team for a hundred thousand dollars a year

41:35.160 --> 41:40.200
And I would teach a biology class at the same university. How's that for a bargain-based

41:41.880 --> 41:43.960
Offer maybe I can get a job at Duke

41:47.240 --> 41:53.080
So the problem with this lie about what knowledge is and how knowledge is created

41:53.720 --> 41:55.320
Is

41:55.320 --> 42:00.760
Coupled with the fact that he's also totally okay with telling the truth about it

42:01.640 --> 42:03.880
Which is that this hyper specialization?

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
It's not the hyper specialization

42:09.240 --> 42:15.240
It's the lack of accountability for for models of reality that don't make predictions that come true

42:15.640 --> 42:17.640
And

42:19.160 --> 42:23.560
We have allowed university biology departments university

42:23.560 --> 42:28.600
neurobiology departments university medical school faculty to get away with

42:29.400 --> 42:34.920
Essentially not creating knowledge but creating noise by doing this p-value ritual

42:36.120 --> 42:38.360
And disproving null hypotheses all day

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
And

42:42.120 --> 42:47.960
He knows that he could he could explain that but he doesn't he calls it knowledge and says there's too much

42:51.080 --> 42:53.080
And that's just not true

42:53.240 --> 42:56.200
There are details of course that we can't all know

42:57.640 --> 43:01.960
But the big truths of physics the big truths of biology the big truth

43:02.520 --> 43:06.360
If if quantum physics isn't making any progress as he just hinted

43:07.000 --> 43:09.160
Then what does it matter if I don't understand it?

43:10.440 --> 43:13.640
If quantum physics can't make useful predictions

43:14.680 --> 43:16.680
About future measurements

43:17.320 --> 43:20.920
Then what does it matter if I don't understand the subtleties of that model?

43:21.960 --> 43:27.720
If string theory doesn't help us by making predictions, then what does it matter if I don't understand the math of it?

43:30.200 --> 43:32.200
And there's the heart of the lie

43:33.400 --> 43:35.400
It's an enchantment

43:36.360 --> 43:38.360
the

43:39.480 --> 43:42.440
Political cut I have on the specialization is always that

43:43.640 --> 43:48.440
That if you analyze the politics of science the specializations should make you suspicious

43:48.680 --> 43:51.800
It should because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on

43:52.120 --> 43:57.720
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be you know a little bit suspicious

43:57.720 --> 44:00.920
And that's that's that's sort of my starting my starting bias

44:01.560 --> 44:06.520
Now the really weird part that I find about the pandemic and and everything is that even if I play this

44:08.200 --> 44:10.200
And I I explain what it means

44:11.400 --> 44:16.040
And I ask somebody or anyone to apply this thinking

44:16.920 --> 44:21.880
to biosecurity apply this thinking to bioterrorism apply this thinking

44:22.760 --> 44:26.520
to bio weapons as an idea a concept of potential

44:27.160 --> 44:28.680
and

44:28.680 --> 44:36.760
Understand that they have a very vested interest in exaggerating and lying about that potential

44:39.720 --> 44:47.160
And then apply that thinking to the beginning of the pandemic and realize that you now have a very plausible reason why every

44:47.800 --> 44:51.800
Government in the western english-speaking world agreed use the same words

44:52.600 --> 44:58.280
wanted the same impression to be applied implied to every listener

44:59.960 --> 45:03.640
effective lockdowns effective masks and the need

45:04.440 --> 45:09.240
to protect everybody from a universal vulnerability to a novel pathogen

45:13.240 --> 45:17.640
Why in the world would it be crazy to be skeptical of that huge claim

45:18.760 --> 45:20.680
Apparently he's not skeptical of it though

45:21.480 --> 45:25.320
Apparently the guy that he's talking to Eric Weinstein isn't skeptical of it

45:25.640 --> 45:32.200
Remember that peter teal is the behind Eric Weinstein is behind the intellectual dark web

45:34.680 --> 45:36.680
People like Shapiro

45:36.760 --> 45:39.720
And and and this character and that guy up there

45:40.280 --> 45:44.040
This dude and that dude and that dude that dude this lady

45:44.520 --> 45:46.520
They've all been amplified

45:47.320 --> 45:50.280
In a way that hasn't helped our grandkids

45:50.280 --> 45:55.560
But has created the potential for chaos that they are now trying to

45:56.520 --> 45:58.360
to

45:58.360 --> 46:00.360
Jam in on

46:01.160 --> 46:06.440
The intellectual dark web is at the heart of understanding what they did to us in the pandemic because they

46:07.240 --> 46:09.880
Are the illusion of consensus they are the heart

46:10.600 --> 46:13.640
Of the illusion of consensus because the illusion

46:14.280 --> 46:16.280
Is that no matter where you turn?

46:17.400 --> 46:23.640
You find an agreement about a novel virus with a novel illness that we all got sick from it's pretty bizarre

46:31.080 --> 46:38.120
And so I play this video with james giordano a lot where he describes how I would see the few cases in

46:38.600 --> 46:42.120
Iowa and a few in Wisconsin and a few in Detroit

46:43.160 --> 46:47.160
And then the real bug I would use is the internet I would take credit for it

46:47.160 --> 46:51.640
I would say I release something and then I would say that there was a bunch of asymptomatic

46:52.280 --> 46:54.280
because it can be spread asymptomatically

46:55.720 --> 46:57.960
And basically that's how you do it

46:59.080 --> 47:01.080
and so if you imagine

47:01.800 --> 47:03.800
the

47:03.960 --> 47:11.160
Easiest way to do it is to make sure that no matter where you tried to culture the virus with intention of claiming

47:11.640 --> 47:13.080
a sequence

47:13.080 --> 47:14.840
You used a clone

47:14.840 --> 47:16.840
an rna copy

47:17.000 --> 47:21.640
So that it would be the same whether you looked in Wuhan or whether you looked in the sahomish county man

47:21.720 --> 47:24.120
Or whether you looked in the sample that was sent from

47:24.680 --> 47:28.600
Bergamo, Italy to the cdc you would always get the same sequence

47:29.160 --> 47:33.400
And then you could say hey look it's the same sequence everywhere. I guess it's the same virus

47:34.040 --> 47:35.560
I

47:35.560 --> 47:42.760
How many people behind the scenes would be necessary to say that out loud knowing it was a lie and then stick to it

47:43.160 --> 47:45.960
In order for all of these other people to have been fooled

47:49.080 --> 47:51.080
I would argue that not very many especially

47:51.160 --> 47:58.040
be given the fact that not very many people have read enough and and tried hard enough to understand the biology under lying

47:58.760 --> 48:00.760
virology

48:01.720 --> 48:07.480
To give it a real college try and and evaluate whether or not virology as a whole

48:08.280 --> 48:11.800
Is something you can swallow or not something that makes sense or not

48:14.360 --> 48:17.080
And so we have been going on and on

48:17.960 --> 48:24.760
Some of these people are are active some of them don't have a clue that they're that they're being used like a ping pong ball

48:26.920 --> 48:29.560
But I guarantee you there are some people who definitely know

48:30.920 --> 48:32.920
There are some people who definitely know

48:37.640 --> 48:44.600
And peter teal right what what what what giant weaponized pile of money is he on top of what what large

48:45.480 --> 48:48.280
Corporation meddling behind the scenes about data

48:49.720 --> 48:51.720
Is he the head of

48:52.280 --> 48:53.640
Right

48:53.640 --> 48:55.640
Talk you spoke earlier about

48:55.640 --> 49:03.320
People being very enthusiastic to give their data. I think you're over exaggerating how enthusiastic people are about just giving

49:03.480 --> 49:08.600
Can't blotch access to their data. Um, are you aware that?

49:09.080 --> 49:13.560
Palantir and faculty have links to the discredited Cambridge Analytica

49:14.440 --> 49:16.440
um

49:17.560 --> 49:19.400
I'm not

49:19.400 --> 49:20.920
Um

49:20.920 --> 49:23.240
I don't uh, I don't think I'm aware of that though

49:24.040 --> 49:27.560
Okay, um, I well, I think it's really vital that you should be aware of that

49:27.560 --> 49:33.080
I mean, it's you know palantir reportedly taught Cambridge Analytica how to scrape data

49:33.080 --> 49:37.400
That means that you're putting at risk everybody's data in the country and giving it to

49:37.880 --> 49:43.640
Organization such as palantir. No, I it's really important that you get to grips with that and I will I know I will give you

49:43.960 --> 49:50.840
Um, so so the UK gave away their data. Israel gave away their data. Everybody's giving away their data

49:50.840 --> 49:53.960
We're probably giving away our data unbeknownst to us

49:54.760 --> 49:56.760
We probably gave away

49:56.760 --> 50:03.720
Millions of genetic sequences during the testing in 2020 and 2021, but we shouldn't pay any attention to that at all

50:04.200 --> 50:10.760
That would be a crazy thing to worry about just forget about 2020 and 2021 and the huge

50:11.400 --> 50:16.200
Basic violation of our privacy the basic violation of our human rights where

50:16.760 --> 50:22.920
Hundreds of thousands if not millions of americans were coerced with false narratives into sampling

50:23.480 --> 50:27.560
Their their inner nasal passages with highly dangerous

50:28.440 --> 50:30.200
Chinese produced swabs

50:31.160 --> 50:33.480
And then had these samples sent somewhere

50:35.000 --> 50:40.760
Who knows where probably to china because you can sell remnants of tests remember ladies and gentlemen

50:41.080 --> 50:43.240
Something that i have a lot of people are aware of

50:43.240 --> 50:45.240
But

50:45.240 --> 50:51.240
But if they swabbed your kid in college every two weeks or every week in order for him or her to go to school

50:51.720 --> 50:54.200
In order for him to go to class or her to go to class

50:55.000 --> 50:57.960
After that swab was tested for SARS-CoV-2

50:58.360 --> 51:02.600
It could be sold as a remnant and that remnant would contain the DNA of your child

51:04.280 --> 51:07.560
And lots and lots of universities actually

51:08.120 --> 51:14.280
Hmm had a way of selling the remnants already in place because they're connected to a medical school

51:14.760 --> 51:19.160
They're connected to a hospital that's been selling remnants for years

51:21.320 --> 51:27.080
And so those those pipelines were already in place and believe it or not they were contracts already in place

51:27.480 --> 51:31.320
Very early before any test was even available in america

51:31.720 --> 51:35.880
Universities were already shopping around for people that might want the remnants

51:36.840 --> 51:43.320
Ladies and gentlemen the spread of bad ideas is much scarier and more dangerous than the spread of air any RNA molecule

51:43.720 --> 51:45.720
And there are certain people

51:46.360 --> 51:48.200
Who ignore

51:48.200 --> 51:55.320
This on purpose they want you to believe that they're somewhere out there in the ether is the fifth generation warfare

51:55.320 --> 52:00.280
That's that's you can't ever identify and see no ladies and gentlemen

52:00.280 --> 52:02.680
There are people who are lying right to your face

52:03.320 --> 52:06.760
Some of them would even come to your house if they needed to

52:09.720 --> 52:14.040
Some of them would even stay overnight in your house if they needed to

52:14.840 --> 52:17.480
In order to make sure that big truths don't get out

52:18.600 --> 52:24.760
Big truths like intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

52:25.720 --> 52:27.720
I believe

52:28.440 --> 52:35.400
I believe with most of my heart right now that I just saw paul off it respond directly to that statement

52:36.760 --> 52:40.600
On twib and I think we're going to watch it a little later if we have enough time

52:41.080 --> 52:45.400
Transfection and healthy humans is criminally negligent viruses are not pattern integrities

52:45.880 --> 52:51.960
Everybody who hasn't already spoken up about the idea that we shouldn't be transfecting healthy humans

52:52.680 --> 52:54.920
Is criminally negligent and the more

52:55.880 --> 53:00.280
Letters you have behind your name the more biology experience that you have

53:00.840 --> 53:04.440
be it as a primary care physician a nurse a

53:05.240 --> 53:07.240
a dental hygienist

53:07.800 --> 53:09.800
a vet tech

53:09.800 --> 53:13.480
Or or somebody who works at a pet store. I'm telling you right now

53:14.440 --> 53:19.000
That you need to come to terms with the fact that you should have done known better a long time ago

53:20.200 --> 53:23.240
That this was transfection and we shouldn't be doing it to healthy humans

53:25.000 --> 53:28.120
But again the spread of bad ideas. That's what's going on here

53:28.120 --> 53:34.040
These people aren't aren't promoted for nothing. They are promoted artificially and they are promoted on purpose

53:34.920 --> 53:36.920
So that the illusion can be sustained

53:38.760 --> 53:42.280
Wait, when you get rid of all this stuff the illusion is always the same

53:43.560 --> 53:47.160
The clown show that's going on here is always the same

53:48.360 --> 53:50.360
Do you really believe?

53:51.320 --> 53:54.680
That a woman whose daughter was featured three times

53:55.400 --> 53:59.800
By Alex Jones or two times or I don't care even one hour with Alex Jones

54:00.440 --> 54:02.440
for being a rebel

54:02.920 --> 54:06.360
For being an outspoken critic of something america

54:07.720 --> 54:11.080
Is now a legitimate dissident a former what does she say?

54:11.880 --> 54:15.320
Retired pharma rnd an executive independently wealthy

54:15.960 --> 54:17.400
This

54:17.400 --> 54:20.520
This person is legitimate. Let's let's let's look at this

54:21.160 --> 54:28.200
Substack comment where she basically explains all of human biology in three paragraphs with a doa at the end

54:30.040 --> 54:34.200
And you can see how much obfuscation is going on hum many

54:35.000 --> 54:36.040
just

54:36.040 --> 54:38.040
people with no

54:38.200 --> 54:40.200
principles no scruples

54:41.080 --> 54:45.880
Are working actively against the american public to try and confuse

54:46.440 --> 54:48.920
To try and sell frustration and doubt

54:49.560 --> 54:52.280
But never actually lead anybody out of the cave at all

54:53.160 --> 54:56.760
Anything that throws your system off balance will make you sick

54:57.480 --> 55:01.960
The seasonal flu illness is due to reduce sunlight vitamin d and the die off of

55:02.520 --> 55:05.720
Bifidobah bacteria in the gut and the subsequent d

55:06.280 --> 55:12.760
Tox cycle in two sentences. She's explained something that western medicine really hasn't been able to explain yet

55:12.840 --> 55:14.840
That's pretty that's pretty cool

55:15.480 --> 55:19.080
If you exercise outdoors in the winter and it's sunny enough you won't get sick

55:21.400 --> 55:22.440
Okay

55:22.440 --> 55:27.560
Why people especially children seem to catch it a couple of things we are largely water

55:28.360 --> 55:30.920
Children have much higher water content than adults

55:31.720 --> 55:37.880
The whole world is made of water and communicates through water uses chemical and electromagnetic and sound waves

55:40.120 --> 55:42.120
We humans emit light and other

55:42.840 --> 55:45.400
Electromagnetic waves, obviously we emit sound waves

55:45.640 --> 55:52.280
We emit chemical waves by shedding material both innocuous skin cells and dangerous to other humans our own waste

55:53.160 --> 55:56.440
That's why 6000 years ago civilized humans knew not to pollute

55:56.920 --> 56:01.800
Sources of drinking water with human and animal waste however in the 1800s people crowded in New York City

56:02.280 --> 56:07.480
Horse manure piled to the first floor windows and there was an epidemic of smallpox wow rocket science

56:10.280 --> 56:13.720
So any exhaust you emit may transmit others via water

56:16.040 --> 56:18.040
Air is also water

56:18.600 --> 56:22.600
When there are a lot of people crowded together they are too close they pick up each other's exhaust

56:22.600 --> 56:29.960
Which may contain chemical molecules and nucleic acids typically in lipid envelopes. I think they call those exosomes

56:31.080 --> 56:35.720
Not sure or other transmission energy which can be good or bad

56:37.240 --> 56:45.000
Bad can trigger your own own system into detox soap breaks lipids and the nucleic acids quickly denature

56:46.600 --> 56:49.800
Is that do proteins denature or do nucleic acids?

56:50.680 --> 56:58.120
That's why we use soap as disinfecting cleaning agent. Okay, so so far I understand soap. I understand flu

56:58.920 --> 57:04.280
I understand that we emit all kinds of waves. Some of them are good. Some of them are detox waves

57:04.280 --> 57:12.440
I guess regarding what was covid chemical slash biological aerosolized material can be characterized as infectious clone

57:13.160 --> 57:17.240
So an infectious clone is a chemical biological aerosolized material

57:17.720 --> 57:22.120
To create an initial wave of sickness with bizarre symptoms and freak everybody out

57:23.480 --> 57:28.040
Subsequent mass murder by hospital protocols and the rest of the fascism

57:28.920 --> 57:32.600
Now injected people are producing the same poison in their gut. Oh

57:33.400 --> 57:37.880
Because their E. coli cells are hacked and made into spike protein factories

57:37.880 --> 57:43.160
So that's a pretty testable hypothesis, isn't it? How long they will be producing this shit?

57:43.240 --> 57:49.160
Literally it varies everyone is different. It's best to stay away from high concentrations of the vast

57:51.800 --> 57:56.360
And so the amount of nonsense in this pair these three paragraphs is

57:57.240 --> 58:03.160
It's pretty impressive. I mean, maybe an AI packed it in there for I don't know, but she does prolifically write a sub stack

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
So maybe she types. I don't know

58:05.960 --> 58:08.440
But there's nothing here for our grandkids

58:09.720 --> 58:11.560
There's nothing here

58:11.560 --> 58:13.000
That says

58:13.000 --> 58:15.080
Who did it and why?

58:15.080 --> 58:22.360
There's nothing that explains why the dod released chemical or biologically aerosolized material that she says

58:22.760 --> 58:28.680
Is an infectious clone, but what is an infectious clone? She's never really defined it. She's just agreed. Yeah, that sounds great

58:30.440 --> 58:34.200
And then at the same time turned around and mocked and criticized me

58:34.760 --> 58:39.000
Or tried to say that I'm somehow attacking her or her daughter

58:39.800 --> 58:45.960
To wave her hands and to start a fire in a dumpster basically and pretend that she's the opposition of Robert Malone

58:46.360 --> 58:48.360
after traveling the world with him

58:49.240 --> 58:53.960
And she would like you to believe that well going to Stockholm with somebody doesn't mean i'm friends with him

58:58.040 --> 59:00.040
She works with the same group of people

59:00.680 --> 59:01.880
Meryl nass

59:01.880 --> 59:03.640
Robert Malone

59:03.640 --> 59:06.920
Sasha latipova there's quite a few of them that all seem to

59:07.480 --> 59:13.720
Pretend to be opposed to one another but are all on Robert Malone's list of bad guys along with me

59:15.640 --> 59:18.600
But it's one great big giant theater of players

59:19.640 --> 59:27.960
With only a few that actually rent their house with only a few that actually need every view and every donation

59:28.280 --> 59:30.280
And

59:30.280 --> 59:35.160
Those are the ones that nobody sees those are the ones that nobody pays attention to those are the ones that everybody

59:35.800 --> 59:39.640
As a rule agrees to criticize kevin mccernan kevin mccern

59:40.520 --> 59:42.520
Sasha latipova

59:43.800 --> 59:45.800
Paul cottrell george web

59:47.560 --> 59:53.960
I mean how how long would of the list would you like to make of people who think that jonathan kui is somehow working from his

59:54.360 --> 59:57.320
His garage to take advantage of the world somehow

59:57.800 --> 59:59.960
Rather than trying to tell the truth that they won't

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.480
That have they have never told

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.440
Because where where are they where are the doses here?

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:18.200
Where are the different batches that she started coming out on in so early in the narrative where where are the where's the deception about the hot hot lots?

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.560
Wasn't that part of this the hot lots didn't have anything to do with anything here anymore

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.320
That was the first thing that she came out about now. She's forgotten about those

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:35.320
She's got a whole paragraph for the whole world being made of water and communicating through water and distracting you with water

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:43.800
Like a lot of other people have done not to say that water isn't important in the the crystal lattice that water can can

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:51.240
Make is not absolutely vital to understanding how proteins function and enzymes work and and how cellular

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.280
Mechanics can possibly occur all has to do with the properties of water absolutely

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:05.560
But it's a distraction from understanding what happened in the pandemic. It's a distraction from understanding what public health is and isn't

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.880
Just like this

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.840
Group of three paragraphs is nothing but a distraction given to you by somebody who's been

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.320
Since she appeared on stage likely working against us first

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:26.040
Standing in front of and taking the mic from a guy by the name of of pardon coper or part of coper

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360
Which is horse buyer?

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.760
so hilarious

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.640
To stepping in front of somebody like

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.880
Catherine Watts

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.840
who

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:42.120
Again, Catherine Watts says that health and human services department of homeland security

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.040
FEMA

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.440
Ditra DARPA the executive branch and the dod are all involved

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.600
not just the dod

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.960
And she doesn't claim to know what happened, but Sasha claims to know what happened

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.640
It was a chemical biological aerosolized material that could be characterized as an infectious clone whenever that is

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.600
And that's the spectacular nature of these medlers

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.840
Is that she can feign as though she's giving a hat tip to our work feign

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.440
As though she's giving a hat tip to some of some people's ideas when she says murder by hospital protocols

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.920
But it's not specific enough

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.880
And it doesn't impart the knowledge

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.160
That would be required for anybody to go out and use this and to spread this

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320
And that's the deception

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
And unfortunately for me

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240
This is my role

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.760
I belong nowhere and everywhere

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.360
And I'm not afraid to stand up by myself

01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:00.280
In the middle of a 3,000 person lecture and ask a question that is antagonistic to the person speaking

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.400
Without first saying, oh, I really enjoyed your talk. That was really great. Thanks a lot

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.080
I I was never afraid

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.200
And in fact, I it was one of my favorite things to do

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:20.120
And so I'm never going to be afraid to step up to this mic and call these people out

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.720
Because I believe that this is the start

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.640
If I can't explain to my 14 year old son

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:34.440
Why I think this is a medler and succinctly bring him to understand it then maybe I don't understand it

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:42.120
If I can't bring my stream to understand why these people actually coming to my house

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.680
And telling me lies to my face

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.920
Is a significant data point that can help other people

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.800
Understand the pandemic of lies

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.160
I have no work here

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.320
That's what I need to do

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.960
Because all of these people have lied to my face

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.880
Not not in an email or in a sub stack post or in a comment or in a tweet

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:18.280
I've taken selfies with these people. I've shaken their hand. I talked to them for a few minutes. I've questioned them. I've I've heard their voices

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.240
lie to me

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.240
I

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.520
And so I interview people like Thomas binder because I think that there are people who have been standing up from the beginning

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.240
Does Thomas binder have everything right? Did you notice that in that interview? I didn't touch

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.880
The virus no virus topic at all and whether or not it was

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.680
We already we agreed that the vast majority of what was iatrogenic murder

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:55.240
Debating about the rest of the story is kind of irrelevant when we find out that would be great

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.680
And if it comes to the fact that we have they've exaggerated virology

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.480
Terribly well, we will come to that first we need to get justice for the murdered

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.400
And interestingly I noticed that by staying off of that topic

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:18.600
His his interview is is being shared by lots of people and it's going lots of places because

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.920
For whatever reason we didn't question the faith in this particular interview and by not questioning the faith apparently

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:29.240
It's okay for the algorithm to hear it. It's okay for other people to share it. So

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280
We'll take advantage of that

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.840
Because we're still telling the truth here. We still told the truth on the stream

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.880
I guess we just didn't say it so directly

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.720
But the illusion of consensus still stands these people are still standing and they're still

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.120
Pushing it

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.720
And so we still have a lot to fight even though we've been using this slide for more than three or four years now

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.320
This is still the truth. The illusion of consensus has been

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.280
Foisted upon us in order to invert our sovereignty to permissions

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:11.320
And I blame the intellectual dark web for doing it wittingly or unwittingly they knew they were being elevating

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.360
Artificially they knew they were being given a gift of comfort and fame and they took it

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:22.200
And when they were asked to use their comfort and fame to spread this mythology they spread it

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:30.040
And none of them have confessed to it yet. None of them have apologized for it yet. All of them are still claiming

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.280
hero

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.280
Still claiming victim

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.240
And

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:43.720
We have seen a tremendous amount of vaccine hesitancy unfortunately in the black and Hispanic community if they come up with

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.680
a vaccine be careful

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440
Don't let them vaccinate you

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.240
With their history

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.960
Of treachery

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.800
Through vaccines

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:09.480
Hey black america only 67 percent of black americans say they definitely will get the vaccine or probably get the vaccine

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.200
So the black community has tremendous vaccine hesitancy

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.680
Okay, that is a real problem. They are making money now

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:23.800
plotting to give 7 billion 500 million people a vaccination

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Dr. Fauci

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.240
No

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.240
Bill Gates and Melinda

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440
You want to depopulate there

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640
What the hell gives you that right?

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.680
People should be ripped up and down right now are people like Louis Farrakhan who's literally going out there and telling his millions of followers

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.960
That the covid vaccine is a vial of death. Have you seen any media coverage of this?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.520
If a if a major

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:58.360
Conservative figure who had met with a bunch of members of congress were out there literally telling people that the covid vaccine was a vial of death

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.160
You know, that would be the front of every single newspaper, right?

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.800
Conservatives deny vaccine efficacy

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.680
And yet here was Louis Farrakhan doing just that democratic members of congress have met with this guy

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.040
They continue to meet with this guy. Have you seen a headline about this?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.960
Here's Louis Farrakhan, but many many followers talking about how the covid vaccine is a vial of death

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.760
Some of these uh so-called vaccines

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.760
It's the nanoparticles

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.520
That

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.760
Men like dr. Fauci

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.320
Have

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.720
proprietary knowledge of

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.840
That allows them to get a patent

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.280
For their vial of death

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.520
I mean

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.440
How is that not the headline right? I mean seriously that should be the headline you want to talk about overcoming covid

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.680
We should be talking about vaccine hesitancy

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.600
I

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.160
Would argue that we should be talking about him

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.320
And how he is working to undermine

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.000
the american public's ability to govern itself

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.120
He is working to undermine our republic

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920
by lying about

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.560
And and getting people to ask the wrong question

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:27.800
Think about how extraordinary that footage is this is the same guy that was sitting at that table with joe rogan

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:36.200
And jordan peterson and seff her uh sam harris and and eric weinstein and brett weinstein

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.920
Planning the intellectual dark web of group of people that would create an illusion of consensus a heterodoxy

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.120
And be in position at the start of the pandemic to do exactly this

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:59.080
Exactly what brett allowed sam to do on his number eight podcast in december of

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.800
2019 and go on and say

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.320
We're not going to be able to tolerate the anti-vax

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.360
mentality

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.360
When the next pandemic comes

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.200
I think i i think what they did is criminal we have on uh special guest

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.360
Back to the show

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:29.720
Uh, dr. robert melon. He's an internationally recognized scientist and physician as well as the inventor of the m rna vaccine

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.160
technology

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.440
And multiple non-viral dna and rna m rna platform delivery technologies

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:44.520
Dr. melon has approximately 100 scientific publication credits with over 12 000 citations of his work

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.440
during the pandemic dr

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.360
melon emerged as one of the

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:54.280
Severest critics of the covid vaccines and the scariest part of jimmy door is that he's trying

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.400
The scariest part of jimmy door is that you're actually watching a person being

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120
made into a ping pong ball

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.760
And

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.360
every time

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.040
I mean

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.240
He had a real big awakening with regard to cornel west

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.800
He had a real big awakening with regard to to robert f Kennedy jr. As did i

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.800
And he can still have a very big awakening with regard to the pandemic

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.640
He's coming

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.800
To a theater outside of pittsburgh at the end of april and i will be there

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:38.440
And so i have very high hopes that jimmy door actually can be told to his face that these people have been lying

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.520
They're good people but they're not good people because they've been read into a national security

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.320
operation that is still ongoing

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.600
And so they have to agree that there was a novel virus they can't question that

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.240
And so you can't blame them

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:58.520
That's the situation they're in they've chosen it

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.000
They've made their bed now they've got to sleep in it, but you don't have to promote them anymore

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.480
And instead you can promote people like jessica hockett like mark kulak like myself

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.760
who understand the biology

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:20.360
That more parsimoniously explains what happened by a combination of of coordinated

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.320
and spectacular commitment to lies

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.840
And having a plan in place already that everybody was bound to stick to because of salary or whatever

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.440
I

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440
Think we can get to them

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.200
And so I don't know what date it is. I got the tickets. I'm not gonna you can figure it out

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.640
It's uh like I don't know an hour outside of pittsburgh

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.360
Um, and we will be there

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.880
Because I do think that this limited spectrum of debate is starting to crack

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.840
And deform

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.840
Because it has been bent too far

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.560
And if we are vigilant and if we continue to apply steady pressure

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.520
Some of these people are going to break not everybody enjoys doing what they're doing

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.680
I don't think jessica rose and joys

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:14.520
Every time somebody introduces her she cringes a little bit with the she has an undergraduate degree in computational biology and a master's in

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
medicine and immunology and a

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.320
Postdoctoral degree or phd and this and a postdoctoral degree and that and another postdoctoral degree in that

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.360
She knows she's full of shit

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.920
She knows that's not the way that postdocs work

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:37.000
She knows that her track record that has led her all the way to tenure on sub stack is not exactly a track record that belies

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.720
mastery of any particular subject

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:49.480
But she is the self-declared bears expert and she is a independent researcher, I guess whatever that means

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.760
I don't think everybody enjoys it, but they all are aware of what they're doing. I am I assure you they know

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.720
Many times that early on

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.320
Or and I mean very early when the when the original wuhan strain was still active

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:17.640
You might have convinced me that it made sense to give a 92 year old debilitated nursing home patient a vaccine

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:25.160
Because there was some modicum of protection against that original strain, but the efficacy has long been

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:32.600
Below zero. It is now as dr. Alex sander points out. It is negative efficacy in all in all ages

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:40.120
in all ages in all ages is negative efficacy your risk of contracting covid

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:45.560
Is higher the more vaccinated you are and frankly what what the jury's out?

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.160
Well, we don't know yet

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.560
We know that it increases your risk of contracting covid and having severe symptoms

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:58.840
What we don't know is what it's doing to your overall immunity your risk of contracting influenza and having a bad outcome

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.080
Your risk certainly of developing a new cancer because you have suppressed your normal immune response

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.480
We certainly know that people are having

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.960
Uh, you know repeated outbreaks of shingles and other things because their immune systems have taken a real ding

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.640
from these

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.440
um, dr

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.840
Riche I was going to say dr. Alex sander dr. Riche just shared with us a couple of days ago

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:27.000
A new study that looked for the first time that i'm aware at the risk benefit calculations

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:35.640
Specifically for the 18 to 29 year olds with regard to the boosters so they're still debating how the

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.880
Transfection interacts with the novel virus

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.320
And so this is going to feed right into the narrative that there is biology that

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:51.480
Herret vunden bosh is the master of and most in touch with and so sooner or later

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.560
I think herret vunden bosh is going to be the guy that takes the international stage

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.720
To explain to us what the next wave of of nonsense is going to be but it's basically going to be

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:06.840
the idea that the effect of over vaccinating the world

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.320
With this highly effective

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.600
Is going to be that we push the virus into this particularly dangerous direction

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.560
That's now having ramifications all around the world

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:21.400
Of course that could be something that they had planned and aren't going to do anymore

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.240
It's something that they might want us to argue about but it will never actually happen

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.640
And already we can see

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.200
This week herret vunden bosh has another post about how this

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.640
There is a picture of a tsunami and that he can predict it

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.520
And so this whole

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:44.040
Thing is just a bunch of actors all agree not to question the basic tenets of the faith

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.120
Which is that there was a novel virus for which we were all vulnerable

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.640
And that vaccines give us immunity through antibodies and that we can measure the antibodies

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.880
And the the affinity of the affinity that they have for them

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.520
Now we're going to be told

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.360
All kinds of stories about how there are all these maladaptive antibodies

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.120
And maybe autoimmunity from the shot is being caused by antibodies

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.400
Which are being made to the spike that are too good or something like that

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.640
We're still being

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.040
Going around the the roundabout. There's big Ben. There's parliament

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:25.160
Hey kids. There's big Ben. There's parliament around and around the roundabout

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.520
And no one ever actually makes the turn

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:35.640
To understanding that if they lied about the immunology and they lied about the potential for gain of function

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.960
And they lied about the protocols that they used and they lied about the numbers

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.040
And there's no need for there to be a novel virus

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.240
If we don't have any data about the prevalence of these sequences or sequences related to them before the pandemic

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.160
Then we have no reason to believe that it wasn't here before then

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.560
And

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.120
As the number of doctors comes forward and says hey wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:08.040
Once the number of doctors realizes what happens to a person who comes into a hospital

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.600
Thinking that they might be sick

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.360
And they get surrounded by people who are wearing garbage bags

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.120
And helmets and face masks and steaming up

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.800
Steaming up woodshop goggles in order to protect themselves what they perceive me to have

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.240
Well, that's a pretty optimal

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.960
Optimal start for the doctor-patient relationship. I'm sure that will be totally successful put him on oxygen

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:43.720
And away we go

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:52.600
One lie on tv and on the nih directors blog another lie on social media and on youtube

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.440
One doctor

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.440
named kyle seidel one nurse named erin

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.800
And away we go

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.080
And this spread of bad ideas continues with one doctor named piaer

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:17.160
One retired pharmacy guy named uh jirado

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:25.400
All these people putting bad ideas out there that supposedly explain everything

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.200
With certainty while insulting everybody else

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.360
Instead of coming to the obvious conclusion that why couldn't it be all of these things

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:42.840
Why does mark jirado have to be right about the bolus theory

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.200
Why couldn't the bolus theory be part of the problem

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:56.520
Why do we have to be right about vaccines causing autism why couldn't sometimes it cause autism and sometimes it's the tylenol given afterward

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:03.560
Sometimes it's the circumstances beforehand or the circumstances afterward sometimes it's

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.280
Maybe even a genetic vulnerability

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960
And an environmental insult

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:20.280
But why does it always have to be one thing one explanation one answer because then you'll almost certainly get it wrong

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.040
That's how they played us

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.920
I'm right. No, you're right. I'm certain. Oh, that's a great explanation. Wow

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.280
The only one that really fits that explanation is lying

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:44.840
Once you realize that if a group of people agrees to lie to another group of people that they happen to be above in social status

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.320
Happened to be above in social media ranking and following

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.640
We would be screwed

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.000
And all the other things wouldn't be necessary

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:00.040
They could convince us of an alien invasion

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.840
I'm dr. Gus cramp. They could convince us. We need to say our pronouns

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.640
Nova Scotia pronouns. He him

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:14.680
I'm david Fraser. I'm a privacy lawyer with meganis cooper working with the college of physicians and surgeons

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
They key him

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320
They can convince people

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.480
who know

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.960
That saying your pronouns out loud is dumb

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:30.440
And panders to a mentality that is not biologically sound and based in biological

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:37.560
The sacredness of biology but based in some kind of twisted nonsense

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:44.840
That has nothing to do with who we are as a species nothing to do with what life is on earth

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.440
That's how disturbing the transgender movement is is because it doesn't just deny

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.440
human reality it denies natural reality

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.120
It suggests somehow that we can have a rainbow of genders which need to be

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:10.280
understood and nurtured and maybe even surgically enhanced or or

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.440
gated

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440
with pharmaceutical intervention

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.560
And that's what separates us from the beasts of the world

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440
That's what separates us

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.160
And I don't think

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.480
God ever intended for us to be separate

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:36.600
I recall jesus talking something about

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.840
You shouldn't care about your clothes or the sparrows or something

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.280
We are in big trouble ladies and gentlemen, this is a this is a hearing in canada where they are

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:55.640
Fighting against but essentially nothing is going to be nothing's going to stop it

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.240
Then this financial measures act they are turning over

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:06.600
The data of all of the canadians and specifically of course their vaccination record, but everything over to the government

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.800
It's now accessible

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:15.960
And I don't know what else they're going to do there testing out what they can get away with up there before they try to enact it down here

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:21.240
Same with australia in new zealand israel and europe the eu

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.560
All different aspects of the prison being tried out

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:32.680
All different aspects of the prison being rolled out in test so that they know how to do it best in america

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.000
That's the reality of things ladies and gentlemen

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.520
That's why i'm wearing this hat because america is under attack america is the focus of this

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400
The eu is already gone

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Canada's already gone australia gave up their guns in the 90s

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.200
New zealand come on

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:05.240
We're talking about what is that four counties in a in a popular state in america i mean give me a break ladies and gentlemen

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.720
the

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.240
Past is fading into mist very rapidly and being erased

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.560
By people like paul off it by people like robert malone

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.200
Being erased 2020 is being erased

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.680
2021 is being erased they are being forgotten

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:33.400
And this lie is going to become the truth if we're not careful because these people are still lying to us

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.800
About this illusion of consensus this worst case scenario

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.840
They're still lying to us about it lots of them are and they were doing it from the very very beginning

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.600
From the very very very beginning they were lying to us about the worst case scenario

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.800
We were on this road all by ourselves. We got picked up in their car and they were lying to us

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:01.560
This is from just a few days ago i'm just going to escape

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.800
I'm going to start it over so that we get a little extra computing power here

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.040
This is from just a few days ago my good friend ryan cole

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.040
Who i trust as being a pretty good guy

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.320
um ryan cole when i met him at the

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.960
at the conference in in um

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.120
Where did i put that now? Where did that cole?

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.880
Oh wow, where is that?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.520
Sorry not carry it around anymore. I thought i carried it around somewhere

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.920
Oh, what in the hell i have a little i had a little note from ryan cole

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.720
That he wrote to me

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.280
At that conference and now i can't find it it was supposed to be in my big wallet here

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.080
But anyway, it was a very supportive note and i actually believe that ryan cole is a good guy

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.200
and that um

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.880
He's been on the inside of a few of these meetings he's been in a few of these places and um

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:07.240
He's a smart guy

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.400
He says what he can

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.720
um

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:15.720
I don't know. I don't know how i feel about him. I know that I I I

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.400
I have a better feeling about ryan cole than i have about a lot of people

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.120
And he could still be a ping pong ball

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.800
And he could still be being used like all of us are

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.400
Um being used even if we don't think we are I assume that somebody's still using me

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.120
Or trying to

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.400
Um, and I think ryan cole does his very best not to be used

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.720
Um, but he was on brat wyenstein's podcast and I think to a certain extent brat used him

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:49.720
Um, and so i'm gonna I got a couple clips, but I mean it's like two hours long so we won't do the whole thing

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600
I

01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:00.120
In science is horrific at this point. It's it's apocalyptic and the fact

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.160
epistemic hubris

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:09.160
In science is horrific at this point. It's it's apocalyptic and the fact

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:12.680
You know the hubris that allowed it to happen is bad enough

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.600
The hubris that

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:21.640
Decides to hard code that it turns out to have been brilliant and have worked wonderfully when the pattern that we see is

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.400
No, you've created a ton of new pathology that far exceeds the cost of this

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:36.680
Viral pathology and worse the viral pathology itself was tremendously manageable with already existing

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:43.800
Safe drugs. Absolutely. So the point is look at how serious was this emergency? Well, they made it into an emergency

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.480
Which then necessitated a radical intervention in their minds

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.200
And they have decided that the radical intervention

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:57.080
Must have worked wonderfully without causing harm because they told us it was safe and effective and that can't have been a lie

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:07.000
So, you know, so we're still injecting people with this stuff, which there simply isn't a defensive. Oh, it's absolutely scientifically indefensible at this point

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.680
Now what I find deceptive about this and I don't think that Ryan Cole is aware of what what Brett is doing

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.800
And I do think that Brett is definitely holding a ping-pong ball

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.320
ping-pong paddle and using Ryan as a ball

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:28.760
Where he is claiming basically that he spoke up in 2020 or something like that because he didn't

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.720
He's basically

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:37.160
Absolving himself from any role in anybody stumbling their way into this shot

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.360
in there being any

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.920
Amount of success at all. Hold on one second

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.960
I'm not gonna I maybe you can drop him off and come back and then I can go get him and play with him when I get there

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.960
um

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.560
the

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.680
The idea here for me that is most annoying is that Brett was not

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.400
on point with his principles in 2020 or 2021

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.080
And in fact, I think he's responsible for spreading some very very

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.520
dangerous aspects of the worst case scenario

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.120
too early on for it to have been random

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.560
One of the things I find very surprising is that

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:26.440
Yuri Dagan a member of drastic was on Brett Weinstein's podcast and I actually didn't know

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.680
that it happened

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.920
at that time I wasn't aware of who Brett was

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.400
And so even though a member of drastic got on Brett Weinstein's podcast

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.680
Nobody inside of drastic really discussed it that I remember and I certainly never saw the video

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560
And

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:50.040
In actuality it turns out that the whole

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:55.640
thing with with drastic was one big operation right because

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:01.000
Yuri Dagan is part of that splitting of drastic into two groups

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:07.960
Yuri Dagan created this fight between him and Carl and and and Dan

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.920
Dan Saratkin and Carl Saratkin

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.720
And and fractured the group and forced people to choose

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:20.440
And then Yuri Dagan was the first person in drastic to block me on twitter

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.280
And he blocked me on twitter because I said that something about the

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:27.800
Transfection being much more important than the origin of the virus at this stage

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.360
Having already

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:36.280
Risked my faculty position and reviewed his paper and put my name in the university of Pittsburgh's name on his

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.840
His paper about the fear and cleavage site

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.360
That was his thanks for me

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:45.240
And the interesting thing was is that I was in a in a

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.880
kind of

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.400
private

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.400
slack group

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.880
Where Yuri Dagan was in that slack group supposedly learning to day trade

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:02.840
And he blocked me on twitter, but still tried to be my friend a little bit in that group

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.960
So already indirectly admitting that kind of it was a it was a big show

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.120
And there you have it

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.760
Piece by piece little hint by little hint little lie by little lie little deception by little deception

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400
betrayal after betrayal

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.880
And so I'm left feeling like the aliens keep coming to my house

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.080
And I keep having to call up the news program and say hey, they were here again

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.200
And nobody wants to hear the story anymore

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But this is the result of it

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:44.360
The result is that somebody like Brett Weinstein who's been meddling with me since

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:49.640
2021 has been lying to me behind the scenes and a signal chat

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:59.240
Since 2021 about his intentions about his loyalties about his relationship with his brother about his understanding of immunology and and

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.040
transfection

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.520
In order to run out the clock

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.000
In order to make sure that the worst case scenario was never doubted early enough for anybody to escape the trap

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:18.600
That was the transfection. He's fine with with taking the mantle of hero now knowing full well that he did his job to a t

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:26.040
And got every vulnerable skilled television watcher to buy full in and they're still by it bought it

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.040
And

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:39.400
Now listen to this extremely disingenuous discussion about the possibility that there was no novel virus

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:47.880
Because that's what we're in his car, right? He's driving around telling us the same story after four years

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.320
You think maybe the story would have changed and it would be different, but it's not

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.360
um

01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:01.000
I wanted to ask you about something else. There is an awful lot of heat around the idea

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:06.440
There's a group of people some of whom I know who have become convinced

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.160
That there was no novel pathogen during covid

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.760
and while on the one hand

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:21.560
I believe they've missed their point. I think their actual point should be something like

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:28.840
No novel pathogen was necessary for most of what took place during covid

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.760
There was an awful lot of psychological manipulation that

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.160
Involved fear of a pathogen, but not did not require there to be a pathogen

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.600
As far as i'm concerned

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.920
It is a slam dunk that there was a pathogen a novel one circulating and that that is not

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.200
Our minds playing tricks on us spotting normal flu that we would have gotten otherwise

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840
And diagnosing it as covid

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.600
Have I ever said that it was our minds playing tricks on us

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.240
Have have any of us

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:20.200
Has thomas binder ever said that it was our mind playing tricks on us has mark ever said that it was our mind playing tricks on us

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:28.040
What i'm saying and when mark saying what jessica hocketer saying is that people are lying to us about it

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.480
And that's why we were fooled

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.480
And he is in on it

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.360
He whether he was winningly or unwittingly enough participating in it

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.080
He fueled the worst case scenario narrative about a novel virus escaping from a lab or coming from bushmeat

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.680
And that worst case scenario is the reason why a lot of skilled tv watchers and a lot

01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:01.640
Of skilled social media users are still convinced that this isn't a transaction. It's a vaccination

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.560
It was him that allowed the narrative to take hold

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:17.640
It was him that allowed this the the trials for the vaccine to have meaning. Do you understand that

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:26.920
If mike eden would have gotten to the mike in 2020 and said there isn't a novel pathogen that we need to worry about because we have

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.240
overlapping t cell immunity if if if ryan cole would have been able to say that in 2020

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:35.880
to the masses

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.800
Then the transfection would have never taken place

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:45.240
ivermectin would have never been needed hydroxychloroquine wouldn't have been a discussion point

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.720
Ventilators or no ventilators come on

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:56.840
The only way they got away with that is calling this a novel virus and making doctors put on garbage bags

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.680
And doctors put on garbage bags because he said it was a good idea

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.120
Because the potential was there

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.720
It wasn't our minds fooling us it was people agreeing to fool us

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.680
And yes, I do believe

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:26.440
It's possible very likely that Brett Weinstein wittingly or unwittingly was one of those people that was put in place early on to make sure

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.280
That the internet would not be a place of escape, but would be another

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:33.160
facet of the trap

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.360
This is just a few days ago and he still can't manage to say much

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:44.600
It's an awful lot of weirdness surrounding the tests for covid which seemed to be

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.960
bizarrely unreliable

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.840
Um, but in any case I wanted to get your assessment as a

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.240
Does that come off as a I'm sorry. I'm eating this meat stick

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.960
Does that come off as a honest assessment of the PCR test

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.240
Given what you've heard from me

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.520
Where I've tried so desperately to explain

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.120
That if we have a background signal that could be conflated using PCR

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:24.440
That the specificity is important that nested primers would be important that multiple controls would be important that all kinds of methodological

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.880
Steps could be taken to make these things more accurate that we're never taken

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.360
And he gives them the simplest lucy football

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.840
garbage

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:42.840
Statement about it instead of being precise instead of talking about the details instead of telling the whole story

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.160
We get have truths

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:54.280
An information that is essentially useless to his listeners because that didn't that didn't arm them with any knowledge that

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.440
has any teeth

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:03.240
That just said well, I guess Brett Weinstein's also very skeptical of the PCR that seems bizarrely unreliable

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600
Why would it be bizarrely unreliable?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.920
You're a biologist explain it take a shot Brett

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.240
For once in four years take a shot at explaining something using your own ideas

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120
Your own best understanding

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
He won't because you can't

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.200
That sound was invented for Brett Weinstein the doctor who was

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.920
working with

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.880
Examples from patients of all levels of sickness

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:44.440
How confident are you that there was a novel pathogen circulating during what we I think wrongly called a pandemic

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:51.880
I call it semi novel because the homology to SARS-CoV-1 another beta coronavirus is 76 76

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.480
homologous

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:55.800
and if you look at the proteins of

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360
common called coronaviruses

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.160
Whether you're looking at the other the nucleocapsid region or other regions

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:10.200
Anywhere from 40 to 60 percent similar to and it goes to your expertise of evolutionary biology

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.920
Let's get a little more precise here Ryan

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.360
I love you to death

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.880
But if you're going to say something about the end protein or other proteins that were potential targets for

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.040
the the amplicons

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.680
Please be sure that you at least mention

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.680
That these are functional proteins and as functional proteins

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:35.000
They have parts that are more important than other parts and parts that are more conserved than other parts

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.920
And so if we aimed this PCR had a more conserved region it will have more overlap

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.520
With the end protein of other coronaviruses than if we pick the part that doesn't have overlap

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080
And that choice needed to be made

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:53.640
And that choice probably wasn't made to our advantage

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.680
But to theirs for maximum positivity and maximum lack of specificity

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.600
You could be more precise four years into this

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:09.640
Brett Weinstein's knowledge could be a little bit more in depth four years into this, but it's not

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.480
And so although Ryan is doing his best

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.920
He hasn't talked to me about it

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.560
And he hasn't watched the videos that i've produced about it so that you can really understand

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:29.640
That for example the poly protein that's made by the open reading frame one a b or one a

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.080
Those poly proteins to a certain extent are pretty highly conserved because they're all enzymes that do different things like

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.040
Cut up the poly protein in order to make the the replicase transcriptase

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.560
Complex whatever you want to call it that actually copies things

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.920
There's a viral protein that needs to be made before any of this stuff can happen

01:40:52.600 --> 01:41:00.600
And so there are regions in there that are highly conserved across coronaviruses that happen to be also highly conserved across t cell memory

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.680
And that's the heart of the story that's that's how you get to the heart of the story the quickest

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.800
It doesn't seem like they're really doing that here

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.840
And so yeah, i'm a little frustrated with both ryan and brat, but it's because of brat

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:22.120
Because brat purports to be this guy who studies complex systems

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:26.040
An evolutionary biology with a unique insight into everything

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.680
But he doesn't really understand the details of anything

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
And he can't explain them

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:41.880
But he wants to claim mastery he wants to claim that he's ahead of it. He wants to claim these ideas are his own

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:49.720
But he couldn't teach his way out of a wet paper bag. What's going on here other than lying and posing

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:56.520
To be part of the governance structure. These auditioning for something. What's novel about this one is the

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.040
spike protein

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.400
and

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:07.960
The improbability that it would bind to human cells to the degree of affinity to which it does

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Which again goes back to many of them

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.640
So if they planted a cloned sequence

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:21.800
So that there would be no sequence errors because remember sequencing is a consensus genome

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.560
So if they were really sequencing a novel virus in the wild

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:31.720
The spike protein would be the most varied subgenomic

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:37.000
Gene because it is the most it's translated in the greatest abundance

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.160
We've looked at these experiments before it gets translated in several orders of magnitude more times than the whole genome

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:47.720
It could be 600,000 copies of the spike protein subgenomic RNA

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:49.880
And not all those copies are perfect

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:55.960
Which means not all the spike proteins that are produced are the same spike protein and so there would be a consensus genome

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.360
And so if the consensus genome that they published in China was wrong

01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:07.480
Then the fear and cleavage site might have just been lost because

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:16.120
the translation of the consensus by the algorithm didn't translate that amino acid to the right amino acid

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.400
How many errors in those places would be

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.280
necessary for the illusion

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:28.360
Of this novel virus to go away like those hiv inserts

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.760
Those also just happen to come right out of the sequence there. We didn't miss any of those

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.640
And so you could think of it as wow serendipity

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.000
huh that the same sequence was founded Wuhan that was found in

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.080
In seattle that gets found in bergamot or anywhere else

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:52.920
But the very way that that sequencing is done suggests that that shouldn't even be possible

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.680
The

01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.360
Very way that viruses are supposed to replicate such suggests that that shouldn't even be possible

01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.760
And yet none of these

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.440
Foundational assumptions are ever going to be questioned by these two guys because we are on a fully safe medium

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.840
That is the Brett Weinstein podcast

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:21.720
The books you and I have both read and presentations that this was targeted and engineered

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.640
in a way to

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720
Be novel in its behavior

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.960
Genetically, it's not as novel as oh de novo. Here's a brand new virus. Yeah. No, here's a backbone

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:36.680
And here's a new damaging modality that has been tacked on to it

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.680
so

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:44.760
It's novel in that regard and this is why a lot of people didn't happen to get very sick with it because they had cross reactivity

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.960
To so many other proteins in their immune systems. That's just so similar though. All those colds have had that sure

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:56.520
You know system had seen close relatives, but yeah, I don't mean novel in the sense of yeah wildly different

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520
I mean novel in the sense

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:05.240
The behavior was different. I mean how many viruses caused the extreme clotting that we saw with this virus in the pre

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:12.920
Roll out of the injections. Yeah, it was causing certain harms that we weren't used to seeing clinically in that sense

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.080
Yeah, we were seeing novel behaviors of it

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.800
Right. Uh a novel set of pathologies

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.560
And in my opinion, I mean part of the argument

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:29.960
I would be interested to talk to ryan about whether those novel pathologies could be explained by supplemental oxygen that wasn't necessary to give

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.480
Because

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.640
Talking about clotting in the united states talking about clotting

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:41.960
And injuries like heart attacks and that kind of thing where we know

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:45.240
We know that there were do not resuscitate orders

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.720
We know that people weren't treating people like they should have been treated

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.440
We know that people were being given things that they shouldn't have been given that were not ever

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.080
considered okay before

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.320
And I am very suspect

01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.320
When anybody says that what we saw was novel when what we did was novel

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.400
Every time somebody tested positive or we suspected it

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.720
Especially in the beginning we treated them in a way that we never would have treated them otherwise

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.880
Not in the history the modern history of the united states

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.240
And they are actively ignoring that

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.120
They are not talking about that fact

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:32.600
They are just assuming that everything that we saw that was novel was really a coronavirus when we were primed

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.160
to see it

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:42.040
We were really primed to see it

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.080
Okay, don't come in here and that's fine

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.960
Little demons

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:58.760
Oops, that was not what I wanted to do. I'm gonna go back one. Oh, come on. J. You're ruining it. You're ruining it. Oh my goodness

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.760
I blew it. There we go

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.280
Okay, let me up

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.160
Come on, please stop fiddling around

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.120
Mm. No novel pathogen

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.840
is that

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.440
Biologists overrate their capacity to actually produce anything new that would stand up under

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:24.840
Environmental conditions and I have some sympathy with that. That's the whole de novo. Here's a brand new virus. Yeah. Oh, here's a backbone

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.640
And here's a new damaging modality that has been tacked on to it

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.640
so

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:37.240
It's novel in that regard and this is why a lot of people didn't happen to get very sick with it because they had cross-react

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.240
Activity to so many other proteins in their immune systems. That's just so similar though

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:46.120
All those colds have had that sure the immune system had seen close relatives, but yeah

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:52.520
I don't mean novel in the sense see they still don't understand it and and bread is still not saying it and even though

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.280
I've been trying to get it in his head for four years now

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.920
It's not that you saw it before it's what is shared between these these

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:07.240
Whatever they want to call them pathogens

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.000
That's important. It is the it is the damage

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.360
Associated molecular pattern that we make immune memory to we don't make

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:23.880
brand new snapshots with all kinds of brand new antibodies to every virus that we come in contact with

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.360
Even if there are all kinds of different viruses, which I'm not really sure about anymore

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.800
That's not the way the immune system works

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.880
The immune system tries to limit the amount of memory it makes and it makes memory

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.800
To things that it considers vital important conserved and damaging dangerous

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.720
There's no reason to make an antibody to something that isn't dangerous

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:53.160
And the implication is is that we block the virus from binding to ourselves

01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:58.840
Block the virus because we have to block the virus with an antibody so that it can't bind

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.160
That's not a

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.080
Real legitimate use of an antibody unless what we're blocking is toxic

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:12.360
Unless where what we're blocking is a is a damage associated molecular pattern. It doesn't make any sense

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.240
To make a molecular memory to it

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:21.320
So something about the idea of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies targeted to the receptor binding domain

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:28.120
Is already biologically incongruent. I can't explain adequately what it is or how it is

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:35.560
But without a doubt, it's biologically incongruent. It's it's creepy and they are not touching it

01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:46.120
Just like jolly getting all angry about jay ignoring his spike chain hypothesis is not addressing this issue

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
And

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:55.240
It feels like they are but they're not because if they were they would be addressing the biological

01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:01.160
Implausibility of antibodies being a primary response being a reflective of something good

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.800
Yeah wildly different. I mean novel in the sense that behavior was different

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:17.240
I mean, how many viruses caused the extreme clotting that we saw with this virus in the pre

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:23.640
for a lot of injections extreme clotting I would really like to understand what he's talking about here

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.200
What is this extreme clotting?

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:33.000
What papers does he have evidence for it from and how does he differentiate this from people who were having a stroke and told

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:41.320
They are not resuscitated. How many how many people had heart attacks because they were put inappropriately on ventilation or you know all of this stuff

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.400
I have got a I've got a I've got a problem with it if people were sedated

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.960
Um to be put on a ventilator

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:55.640
You know all of these things can cause an increase in clotting an increase in in all of these problems that have nothing to do with covid

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.840
You see if all of these people were dying in their house

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:05.720
That'd be one thing, but I think the majority of the people died in a hospital where the clotting could be caused by the whole

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:13.080
Certain harms that we weren't used to seeing clinically in that sense. Yeah, we were seeing novel behaviors of it

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.040
Right. Uh a novel set of pathologies

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.960
And in my opinion, I mean part of the argument for there being no novel pathogen

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:26.200
Is that um biologists over rate? No

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:28.840
No

01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:34.760
The primary reason why we argue that there might not be a pathogen is because there's no evidence of spread

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:37.000
You poser

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
You absolute poser

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.160
You can't possibly be

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:48.680
You are masquerading as a deep thinker if you haven't gotten to this realization already

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:56.600
That that denny rank or or jessica hockett or myself or anyone else hasn't brought you to understand

01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:01.160
That if the 500 000 people so far that have died in the last few years

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:09.080
From opioids aren't accounted for but are just called excess deaths and then rolled into covid. We have a problem

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:17.240
If you're not willing to take account of the fact that people were murdered in 2020 then we have a problem

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:21.560
And bread is not willing to take that into account because he was part of it

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.520
He was part of seeding the narrative

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.240
He was part of making sure that everybody complied with the lockdown that didn't resist it too much

01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.440
That didn't come up with a good reason to resist

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.160
He was part of it

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:43.800
And my guess is that he participated willingly because he thought he was doing something bright that he thought maybe he was going to save some lives

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:49.640
Because the worst case scenario might be true because he's not sophisticated enough yet to understand it

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:55.800
Because he's either been looking away too long. He hasn't bothered to read what i've put in front of him or

01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:03.080
He's actively participating in the network of people that govern us with lies that's linked to his father and all these other people

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.520
How about that?

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:10.920
Now that i'm not linked to chd, I guess I can say anything I want to about their partners

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.840
Let's keep this playing

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.240
Their capacity to actually produce anything new that would stand up under

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:25.320
Environmental conditions and I have some sympathy with that. That's the kind of argument I would often make about you know

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.720
Listen to how medically in that sense

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:33.640
Yeah, we were this argument that Brett makes is that that biologists can't make something that can do this

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:39.800
This is again a very very clever absorption of giga-ohm biological statement

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.680
That r&a can't pandemic

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:50.200
He's trying to be a mealy-mouthed absorber of the real points we are making

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.480
He's obfuscating the truth here

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.440
in the worst way possible

01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:04.680
See it for what it is r&a can't pandemic is a very very simple idea

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:11.000
That in all the time that he's been talking about it since the start of this clip he hasn't even come close

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.720
to distilling it down to that

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:21.480
Raw essence r&a can't pandemic that's that is the the principle so if r&a can't pandemic

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:24.760
I must have always been there and if it was always there then they're lying about it

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:30.040
And that's how the PCR was bizarrely unreliable. Gee. It's not very complicated. Is it Brett?

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.680
Unless you're spectacularly committed to the lie

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.200
If you're spectacularly committed to the faith and it's your job

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:45.800
To make sure that people like Ryan Cole never find people like me and listen long enough to understand that you're actually part of it

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:51.640
So I think we should work to get Ryan Cole on our stream because I think actually Ryan Cole

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:57.560
Is capable of understanding that these people may have lied to us that people were put in place in order to lie to us

01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:03.480
That this wasn't a plan that they hatched a few weeks before the january 2020 announcement

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:06.120
But it was a plan that they hatched 20 years ago

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.480
And have been putting people in place to execute this plan for 20 years

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.200
some

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:16.680
Some of them wittingly some of them unwittingly

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:23.160
But we are under attack by people who are essentially traitors

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:31.000
We're seeing novel behaviors of it right a a novel set of pathologies

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:37.320
Corros Sherman and in my opinion, I mean part of the argument for there being no novel pathogen

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.040
is that

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.760
Biologists overrate their capacity to actually produce anything new that was

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.920
Environmental conditions and I have some sympathy with that

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.600
That's the kind of argument I would often make about you know the hubris of

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:56.840
Biologists who think they can outwit nature, but that's not what I think happened

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.680
Right. I think mostly what happened is a pathogen that would not have

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:03.480
Jumped to humans

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:08.600
Might have jumped to individual humans, but would not have jumped to humans and circulated amongst them

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:13.880
Was shepherded into humans right in the laboratory. Yeah, um for

01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:18.120
Presumably weapons purposes, but nonetheless that

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.840
You know shepherding he means that they uh they enhanced it they may enriched it

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:30.840
They worked it on a background so that we become better at what it's doing that. That's the gain of function narrative

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.160
That's the scooby-doo. He's actually reciting it right now

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.520
Gosh darn it

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.120
Sorry, I gotta go back to that. I gotta be very careful where I click

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.920
Right about here

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.440
That isn't flu into people that has that so

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:53.560
You know and I must say

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:59.320
There's a question about how many times in life you're going to get this there was some amount of flu

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.440
Oh my ships here we go

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:08.280
I'm sorry about this. This is I should just really have it as a separate video

01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.360
I shouldn't have it in here like this

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:16.440
The idea that this significance the medical significance of a case of covid was in

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.240
Scale of things that we already had, but here's what bothers me about that argument

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:30.200
Let's say that this is somewhere in the neighborhood of flu in terms of

01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:34.280
Of virulence the harm done to the human

01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.040
Okay, well we had flu

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:45.560
Now somebody has jumped another thing that isn't flu into people that has that so

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.680
You know and I must say

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.480
There's a question about how many times in life you're going to get this there was some amount of

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:59.480
Flu that you were going to get in a lifetime. Somebody's now introduced an alternative flavor of

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.560
It doesn't matter to me that it's not worse than flu

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.080
The point is I was already going to get flu a certain number of times in life

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:10.840
And now I have to get flu plus this other thing right? That's a lot of sickness

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:17.640
Right so they cost in terms of the human population suffering from cases of descendants of whatever the hell

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.200
They did that's a massive loss to humanity. Even if it is no worse than flu

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:28.600
Right, it may not radically alter how you should feel about an innovative to what else exists in the millow

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.200
Yes, exactly. Exactly. I will also say though

01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:38.680
I'm convinced based on what my family saw and experienced

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:44.360
That there was a novel pathogen and the number of excellent doctors who

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:49.640
Saw this clinically or in your case as a pathologist

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:58.520
That doesn't tell me what how many times do you think he needs to reiterate that he's sure there was a novel pathogen based on his family

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:04.040
Experience and other doctors and what we said five minutes ago and what I said 10 minutes before that

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:09.560
I'm sure there was a novel, but i'm sure it i'm sure i'm absolutely sure

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:17.320
And don't forget in june of 2021. He was absolutely sure that prophylactic use of ivermectin was as good as a vaccine

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:23.240
And that prophylactic use of ivermectin was allowing him and rober malone and

01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:27.800
Steve kirsch to hang out on his show and talk about all the subtleties of

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.280
Transfection. I mean they never used that word, but that's what they were talking about and

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.400
And talk about how 60 days of everybody on ivermectin

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:41.560
Would essentially end the pandemic according to steve and bret

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:49.000
And so I guess he never got covid right because he was using ivermectin prophylactically virus

01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:51.800
It was right in other words

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:57.640
I'm open to the possibility that the story that we've gotten about sarsko v2 is not the story

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:03.240
Of the so-called pandemic right where it is part of the story, but not the whole story

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:07.160
But what i'm you know, i'm open to anything in principle

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:13.080
But it's going to be a high bar to establish that there was no novel pathogen because i got sick with something

02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:21.080
Not in the winter multiple times and it was pretty significant what right wait what maybe not worse than a flu but bad

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:29.560
Wait, what if we're just on what my family saw say what experienced say what was the novel pathogen and the number of

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:36.840
Excellent doctors who what did he just say this clinically or in your case as a pathologist

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:40.040
That doesn't tell me what virus

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.440
It was right in other words

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:48.360
I'm open to the possibility that the story that we've gotten about sarsko v2 is not the story

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:53.880
Of the so-called pandemic right where it is part of the story, but not the whole story

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:57.800
But what i'm you know, i'm open to anything in principle

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.720
But it's going to be a high bar to establish that there was no novel pathogen because i got sick with something

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:09.640
Not in the winter multiple times and it was pretty significant holy crap

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:11.880
Maybe not worse than a flu but bad

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:14.440
Did he test

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440
What is he saying here?

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.200
He got sick

02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:25.880
Not in the winter time multiple times that wasn't flu when did i hear about this what is this where did the prophylactic ibermectin go

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:32.360
Did he stop wearing his bandana and goggles is that why he got sick

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.800
Can you see anything other than a liar here

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:42.600
How is it possible to see anything other than a liar

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:51.800
Someone who will tell and say whatever words he thinks are necessary to say in order to grift however he grifts

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.520
Make

02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:00.520
Make whatever animal sounds he needs to make in order to make the ends meet i guess

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:17.880
I have a little bit of a personal issue with him yes because he lied to me for a long time

02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.080
With the help of other people

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
And then he lied about me

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.640
to other people

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.880
And other people are lying to me

02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.600
And lying to other people about me

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:36.520
Probably at his behest or other people's behest all

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:39.240
basically part of the same team

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:43.320
Serving weaponized piles of money that are trying to help

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:45.800
foreign powers

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:52.840
Destroy what's left of our republic and take what what's left of the wealth of america and turn it inside out

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.960
Sell it to the highest bidder

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.960
We're going to wake up homeless on them on the on the land that our forefathers conquered

02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:10.120
Because of people like Brett Weinstein who are posing as

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:16.600
Patriots fighting for our children's freedom when in reality he's nothing more than an immunomethologist

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.680
Parroting the same mythology that got us here from the very beginning

02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:25.960
and evolving only as fast as his

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.760
controllers want him to evolve

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:35.560
It's different enough though for me when I got it back in december of

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:37.880
21

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:41.720
December 21, so I I get I got to enjoy the delta variant and

02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.840
But in terms of tested

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.320
Sequence overflowing the testing that I got criticized in the media for lowering my cycle thresholds

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:56.760
And then you can't do that. I said well if you read federal standards a laboratory director can set ranges on test

02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:02.600
Please beware that now he's talking about cycle thresholds, but neither Brett nor brian

02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:06.120
Unfortunately is going to explain it as succinctly as thomas binder did

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.040
That if you do a pcr test with 98 accuracy and 98 percent specificity

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.840
Excuse me and you do it on a population where the prevalence is zero

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.440
Every one of your positives is a false positive

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.640
And so there were lots of different ways to game

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.760
the tests

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:35.160
If there's a background there was a way to game positives and negatives

02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:42.600
If there is a a specificity, there's a way to game positives and negatives and then those things could change

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:47.480
If you are willing to believe sashalatapova's coverage of

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:48.840
of

02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:50.440
Particoper

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.440
And and the batches for different

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:55.400
for different

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.400
doses of the vaccine

02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:04.840
How can you possibly not think that the lateral flow tests that are produced in china the lateral the pcr tests that were produced in china

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:09.640
The pcr tests that were produced in 200 different ways in america alone

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.880
Couldn't be manufactured in such a way to orchestrate

02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:17.480
Whatever they needed to orchestrate at that particular week or month

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:27.000
It doesn't even cross their mind that they would be bizarrely unreliable

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.840
Maybe because they're bizarrely non homogenous

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:35.080
Maybe because they're not all the same

02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:39.240
Maybe because there's no consistency in anything

02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:42.120
That was purported to be consistent

02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.160
No certainty in anything that was purported to be certain

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:52.360
And yet none of the certainties that the real that the pandemic relies on are being used fully questioned by these guys

02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:58.040
And that's why we will remain trapped our children will remain trapped

02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:04.840
And brett Weinstein is in the business of perpetuating this mythology by passing it on to our young people

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:07.480
his viewership

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:13.480
These college age adults who think he's hip or cool because he got pseudo fired

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.240
By getting a $500,000 settlement from a

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.080
Poe dunk

02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:24.120
super leftist crazy teaching university in the in the backwoods of Oregon

02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:27.800
It's based on his population. Mm-hmm

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.200
But you know some dumpy newspaper reporter that knows more than a physician scientist lab director

02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:37.160
You can do that like yes, I can

02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:46.600
And so at the same they're the same they're absolutely the same you want to hear how the same they are let's listen to let's listen to

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.760
To paul off it right now you want to listen to paul off it talk all the same right now here it is

02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:56.200
It's all the same i'm going to speed it up

02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.440
Make it faster

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:07.160
So we don't have to listen to all of it so long, but it's the same narrative right the same exact narrative

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:14.280
From microb tv. This is beyond the noise episode number 35 recorded on march 27th 2024

02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:22.520
I'm vincent rak and yellow and joining me today is your host dr. Paul off it. Hi vinson

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:26.680
This is the video version of paul's column on sub stack called beyond the noise

02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:32.440
And today we're going to look at this week's column called why did the anti-vaccine movement tilt to the right?

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:37.400
So I didn't know this what and you say this early on in the article what's the evidence said initially?

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:41.080
This anti-vaccine agen activists never actually had a political agenda

02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:48.360
Right. So anti-vaccine activism was born of the first vaccine the smallpox vaccine, um, you know created by edward gennon late 1700s and and he used

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:54.840
And so how often have we heard this right how often have we heard this story?

02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:58.040
Maybe I can't play it while i'm streaming to youtube. I probably won't do that

02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:02.360
this thing right here this video is extraordinary because essentially

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:07.000
Um, paul is going to tell a story of overwhelming

02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:09.800
You know, we were our system was overwhelmed

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.960
and the

02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:17.000
Vaccine hesitancy has kind of moved to the right because of you know, whatever we're

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.280
The right the right side is now the bad side or something

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:24.600
I don't know what his story is but essentially he tells the same story about a novel virus

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:32.760
and we didn't know what to do about and and it's extraordinary how parallel their stories will be to that of bret and

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:34.920
and uh

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:39.400
And ryan and what they'd talked about and more importantly didn't talk about in that podcast

02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:44.360
So let's just skip this. Let's just skip it because I don't want to waste the bandwidth

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:47.880
And I should finish up before four o'clock so I can go to the gym

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:53.160
So we have paul off it and we have bret Weinstein basically agreeing on the

02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.600
The the the aspects of the narrative that are most important

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.440
Which is a mystery virus and then excess deaths are caused by the mystery virus

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.840
has mystery virus with mystery

02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:07.320
Attributes that include clotting and and and whatever other

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:09.000
you know

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.400
Symptoms are there because of ace two or because of a fear and cleavage cider

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:19.480
You know, whatever explanation that they want to give you the mystery virus equals excess deaths and neither

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:21.160
neither

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:26.760
Neither the twib group nor the dark horse podcast is capable of distilling this down

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.680
To the essential fear uncertainty and doubt that caused this they're not

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:37.960
Capable of talking about the newest thing that we've come to realize is a real crucial part of the early narrative

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:44.680
Which was the overuse of pulse oximeters to get people to go to the hospital that even flccc was involved in

02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:51.240
And using pulse oximeters to get people to go to the hospital where they would then be put on supplemental oxygen

02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.280
Which would cause them to have the lung problems that would allow them to justify

02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:03.960
Well, the pain that you feel could be alleviated if we put you on a ventilator and bang there goes the deaths

02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:11.480
They can't seem to sort through the do not resuscitate orders that are documented in New York is being

02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:17.000
Contributing to this false idea that covid was causing people to have heart attacks

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:23.800
They don't seem to be able to actually annunciate that ventilators were not only misused but used to stop spread

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.520
They weren't just misused they were used to stop spread

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:33.320
Which is very very different if you have doctors that are so shitting their pants

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.840
Little residents that are so scared by the military presence in their hospital

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:42.600
That they are willing to tell people that because of this very dangerous virus

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.120
We're going to ventilate you so that you don't spread it to other people in the hospital

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:51.400
Where's that part of the narrative for these guys after four years of trying to figure it out?

02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.040
Did they say that we didn't use antibiotics

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.840
Did they say that there was poor use of steroids

02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:05.800
Did they mention remdesivir mandazalam at all

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:12.440
Did they say anything about the opioid deaths that have contributed to this illusion of excess deaths

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.840
Especially excess deaths below a certain age group

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:20.760
Did they say anything about the death certificate fraud that was

02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:25.000
Documented since the beginning of the pandemic in california in new york and elsewhere

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.080
Did they talk about financial incentives that concurged

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.400
hospital systems to call everything covid so that maybe

02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:37.560
Strokes and other stuff would be called covid and so that people like

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.600
Ryan cole would be fooled into believing that the novel virus was doing novel things

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:44.520
Did they talk about that?

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:46.680
Is that even a possibility on their radar?

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:56.360
Did they talk about the track and trace and all the money that was spent on it that it made people believe that something was really happening

02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:59.400
When it wasn't did they talk about that at all?

02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.160
Did they talk about how the closures made people think

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:08.760
That something was happening and misled people and did they talk about wearing bandanas to the store

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:11.720
And advocating for closure

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:16.280
Hadbicating for people to stay away from their grandparents over christmas might have caused this problem

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:21.960
Of course they didn't because bread encouraged people to stay home and not go to their grandma's house over

02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:26.920
The first christmas of 2020 did they talk about pcr fraud

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:30.520
Did they talk about lateral flow test fraud

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:35.960
No, they were just bizarrely unreliable did they talk about sequencing fraud

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.160
They even talk about what sequencing might mean in terms of fraud that they use

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.000
Between 106 and 99 primary pairs to amplify the sequences that they call covid

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:51.400
How many of those need to amplify in order for a sequence to be recorded? Did they talk about that?

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:57.800
So they basically didn't talk about anything that would help people to understand why

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.560
Having the position that there might not really have been a novel virus necessary or even present

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.760
Is a relevant discussion?

02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.320
Of course they didn't talk about the idea that you know, maybe we should have some Medicaid costs were avoided

02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.880
They didn't talk about the fact that all these dead people all these old people and old folks homes

02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:27.640
That died all these medicare people that came to the hospital and died. They're not having any medicare costs anymore

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:34.600
Something that big insurance companies and think tanks since the late 90s

02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.600
We're talking about how the impending doom of the boomers

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:45.560
Was going to bankrupt the united states system because medicare is one of the single largest non

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:50.600
Negotiable items on the american budget interesting. They didn't talk about that either

02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:58.040
Did they talk about strict liability being a very simple legal principle that we should just apply

02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:01.240
To every pharmaceutical and this problem would be solved

02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:03.640
Did they talk about how?

02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:09.560
Actually, the prep act is a violation of our seventh amendment because it doesn't allow us to sue for any damages over

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.960
$20 did they talk about that

02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:17.960
No, unfortunately they didn't even though brett's dad has been a lawyer since jfk

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:23.560
Did they talk about zero epidemiological evidence of spread

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.440
No, they didn't

02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:31.320
So my overall rating of their podcast is

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.280
Of course, not very good

02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:40.680
But what can we do when there is a limited spectrum of debate that people are obliged to stay within

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.600
There is a limited spectrum of debate that the weaponized pile of money that you serve

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:50.680
Obliges you to stay within and enforce well, then you do it

02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.520
That's who bret Weinstein is

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.080
That's who the intellectual dark web is

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.440
They are essentially responsible

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:04.040
For allowing

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.200
This to happen

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:12.440
All of these people have been pretending to contribute to something they didn't need to contribute to

02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:18.920
They have been pretending to contribute to a phenomenon that they aren't contributing to at all

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.320
They have been pretending to be essential

02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.800
To something for which they are completely unnecessary

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.320
And that's why I love this video so much

02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:36.520
Because not only did they accomplish that but they actually accomplished getting us

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:41.480
To believe that they were essential that they were contributing

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:44.840
To something that they were not contributing to that they were

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:50.600
Important in a phenomenon for which they had no bearing and no imposition

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:56.200
And so what their job was was to

02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:04.520
Participate in this illusion their job was to occupy our attention with questions that would not allow us to escape

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:11.640
Don't worry about that guy. He's just stopping the train and he's just helping the train start again

02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:15.320
Focus on the lab leak and the spike protein

02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:21.880
Focus on that guy who's

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.200
Talking about lockdown

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:30.840
Focus on that guy who is sure that we might not have any immunity to this that amino mono one might not apply to this virus

02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.840
Because it's again a function virus

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:35.240
Focus on that guy who's talking about 5g

02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.520
How about you focus on the novel treatments that are being suppressed by your bad government

02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:51.320
Focus on the leaks that we understand our people saying that we have to cover up hydroxychloroquine or

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:54.520
Cover up ibramectin or we have to run a really shitty trial

02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:00.120
It's so crappy that even a gas station attendant can understand how crappy it is

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:06.280
And then we'll get them to argue about hydroxychloroquine and ibramectin and how they might work

02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:12.360
And how it's so unfair that doctors can't use something that was over the counter before 2020

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.680
So that they never questioned whether or not that guy's really doing anything

02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:24.200
So that you never questioned whether there is a virus you already accepted there is one

02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:27.560
And you already accepted the relevant thing is to figure out where it came from

02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:37.480
Why don't we get you to argue about double-stranded DNA contamination in the shots that we rushed it

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:41.480
So that you won't ask a question of whether

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:45.640
Transfection was criminally negligent in its purest form, which is most certainly was

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:51.480
Why don't we get you to argue about a proposal that we leaked ourselves?

02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:57.880
That almost assuredly is a slam dunk for how the pandemic started. It's a

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.600
RNA that we sprayed in a bat cave

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.040
And then mother nature did the rest

02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:06.680
I mean look it's it was a leaked proposal

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.400
These people don't lie

02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:12.040
I mean it's a leak

02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:18.600
Team worst case scenario was in place

02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.560
Team worst case scenario was recruited encouraged and is still in place now

02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:28.440
To make sure that the transfection is and its damages forever

02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.640
Conformed and conflated with that of the virus be it the spike protein or what have you

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:40.920
That mission is a virtually accomplished now with regard to the to the college kids

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:43.480
to the young adults

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:49.320
To the skilled tv watchers and the skilled social media users and that's the people we need to save from these people

02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:56.680
Specialization is always that um

02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.280
That if you analyze the politics of science the specializations should make you suspicious

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:05.640
It should because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:11.560
And it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate and then one should be you know a little bit suspicious

02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:14.760
And that's that's uh, that's sort of my starting my starting bias

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:22.200
A little suspicious is an understatement ladies and gentlemen the pandemic was created by writing papers about it

02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.920
A pandemic was created by doing exercises and planning for it

02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:32.680
The pandemic was created by having people spread the illusion of a mass casualty event

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:37.000
They may have used the department of defense to create those mass casualty events

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:44.840
And then the pandemic was sustained by a team known by this stream as the worst case scenario team

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.840
That perpetuated this narrative that a billion people could die if we didn't conform with lockdowns

02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:58.200
Did not conform with masks. You'll notice that not only did Brett Weinstein the eminent evolutionary biologist

02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.320
Fumble the ball for a year and a half on masks

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.960
But so did kevin mccairn

02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:11.320
So did steve kirsch

02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:19.080
So did everybody so did so did jordan peterson so did ben shapiro

02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.320
Because they're all part of the same act the same theater

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.920
They can be described as team worst case scenario

02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.520
They're doing it for the governance of the world

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:34.360
And

02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:38.440
They have to keep doing it because they signed a piece of paper. They're part of this

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:45.160
It's a national security operation. They know that they are protected by other people in the same operation

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:51.000
And it was all to get us to surrender our sovereignty so that they could start

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:56.360
Using genetic technologies and testing genetic technologies on the population as a whole

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:59.080
Without need to pass through the fda

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:06.600
This train is leaving the station this year

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.040
With this election we are going to be given amount of chaos that will

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:17.720
Get very hard for us to and get people to look backwards anymore to see what happened

02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:24.040
If we get past this election and we try to get people to look back to donald trump whatever that was

02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.840
During the start of the pandemic it won't work

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:29.880
And so we've got a lot of work to do over the next few months

02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:36.200
To get people off this train because people still believe that we've defeated disease in the past using vaccination

02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.920
People still believe that coronavirus is can pandemic

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:44.360
People still believe that PCR positives are rare and asymptomatic spread is real

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:50.120
People still believe that the variants are evidence of spread and a continuing evolution of a single virus

02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:54.760
And people still believe that we're spending money on real gain of function research

02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:59.800
And it's not it's all just a mythology. It's an elaborate

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.200
stage

02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:07.480
Actors with people planted in the audience that are brought up on stage that say oh my gosh

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.600
I can't believe how gain a function this is

02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:16.040
And we have been fooled and we are being

02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:18.920
Made to fool our children

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:22.120
Because they want to avoid the medicare costs that are coming

02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:25.240
They want to protect the growing skepticism

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:30.520
We want to protect the vaccine schedule in america from the growing skepticism that was there before the pandemic

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:34.360
They want to transition to a digital currency from the dead dollar

02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:39.080
But they want to extract all of the real value from the dollar system before they do it

02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:47.960
And leave all of the poor innocent good people holding the real dollars when the dollars become useless. That's the plan

02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:54.120
They want to transition to genetic vaccines for the entire population and make it a mandatory

02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:57.320
They want to confound the toxicity of viruses and

02:22:57.640 --> 02:22:59.480
Transfections so that you never figure it out

02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:03.560
They want to transition the youth into the submission in full digital control

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.640
They want to edify the mythology of pandemic viruses meaning they want to make sure that that

02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:13.000
Mythology goes from being a lie to being the truth

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:16.440
They want to disrupt family formation for a whole generation

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:19.880
They want to shorten the lifespan of billions of people especially old people

02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:24.440
They want to kill billions of people with a gain of function virus. No

02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:31.080
They want to destroy the cultural cultural fabric of america and the rest absolutely

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:36.840
And they want to help create the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:40.920
Absolutely, they do

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:48.840
The way out is biology ladies and gentlemen, you want to advocate for a pause in all childhood vaccinations in america by comparing it to any other

02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.040
Western nation

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:56.200
You want to advocate for strict liability because that's what we need you want to advocate or investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause

02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:01.240
Mass casualty events by following jessica hockett and sharing all of her posts and data

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:07.000
Um, you want to investigate the use of mass casualty events and transfection to create the illusion of the pandemic

02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:08.920
So you need to understand clones

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:13.880
You need to understand what prions are and are not and we're going to work on that over the next few days and weeks

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:20.760
Reclaim the sovereignty over your bodies and those of your children and encourage and elect people who are running on a platform where they're

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:24.680
Going to withdraw from the who in the you and entirely i bet you can't find a candidate like that

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.600
But we should find them soon. You want to see these medlers. They won't mention the childhood vaccine schedule

02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:35.160
You want to see these medlers. They won't say strict liability

02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:39.160
They're happy to make fun of me. They're happy to make fun of mark

02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:44.120
They're happy to claim victimhood and censorship, but they won't actually say anything useful like

02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:51.560
You know the use of deadly protocols to bring about a mass casualty events is a meaningful data point in understanding the pandemic

02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:55.480
They won't do it. They won't use the word transfection. They won't talk about clones

02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:01.640
They attack people like me instead of teaching ideas and they are unable to summarize across the entire show

02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:06.520
Look at Brett after four years. He still can't summarize across the entire show

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.400
And still skips the entire slide that is describes everything that actually happened

02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:18.680
I got one more video for you and then we are done ladies and gentlemen

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:23.240
Why are they doing this because they've been lying to us and they've been lying to each other

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:26.360
They've been lying to the rich people of the world that we're almost there

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:31.400
We've almost got it. The AI is almost there. The data is almost there. The collection is almost there

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:35.240
Just give us the people and the data and we will make you

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:37.880
immortal

02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:39.480
This is a new world order

02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:44.760
It's a lie that we are supposed to pass on to our children that we will not if I have anything to say about it

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.240
If giga-ohm biological gets funded the way it needs to be funded my family can live off this

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:51.640
I'm going to be teaching for the rest of my life

02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:53.640
because

02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:58.040
Because they would use machines to control us ladies and gentlemen, that's all this is

02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:02.280
AI is not something that we need to be afraid of it's the men

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.520
and the women

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:10.120
That you are willing to use machines to control our opinions and our thoughts

02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:12.280
to govern us

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.280
with lies

02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:16.600
These people are the people who we need afraid of hey

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:21.720
I just found a video of Craig Venner where he's totally and completely honest. Are you ready to hear it?

02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.000
We understand less than 1% of the human genome so trying

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:30.920
to be manipulating that and creating

02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:34.120
variants of that I think is

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.560
To me, it's unethical to do because we're doing it without knowledge

02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:44.280
um

02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:50.120
At some point it would be really good to get rid of diseases like case acts and other

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:53.560
Horrible debilitating diseases for young children

02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:59.800
Uh, but we don't know enough about the human genome that knocking out genes

02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:03.000
Uh, we don't know what other functions they have

02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:05.800
Things like crisper are not

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.560
Uh

02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.000
The precise tool that they're made out in the press to be

02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:16.040
They have what's called off target effects. They make changes in other genes

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.080
We're just so not ready for doing that

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:23.640
What an interestingly frank thing for him to say

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:30.200
Ladies and gentlemen, this is giggle and biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:36.200
Please stop all transfections and humans. They are trying to eliminate the controlled group by any means necessary

02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:43.000
Um, you can find me at giggle and biological.com where you can also share and support the stream in a number of ways

02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:46.200
If you have the means, please do so otherwise if you can

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:49.640
Share this work so that the biology gets out there

02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:55.000
Pintramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:01.880
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity. Thank you very much for joining me

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:08.520
Again, you can find me at giggle and biological.com and you can join me at giggle and bio and stream dot giggle

02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:13.800
Dot bio if you want to watch the stream without cuts and without censorship and without algorithms

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:20.360
This has been a presentation of the independent bright web and our peer tube is a a first

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:27.320
sort of attempt at building an intellectual or an independent bright web, so please check out

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:31.720
Um, that website stream dot giggle home dot bio. It's a lot of work

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:39.640
That Tim's put in tents put into it. Excuse me, Ted and it's a lot of uh, you know talents and and energy going into it

02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:45.720
Um, it's where I want to focus and eventually move to and get off switch in these other places

02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:48.600
And we can get that thing working as well as possible

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:54.680
Um, again, this has been giggle and biological a high resistance low noise information breed brought to you by a biologist

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.360
My name is Jonathan kui coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.240
Um, and uh, yeah

02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:03.240
I'll see you again tomorrow

02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.320
Don't forget the solar eclipse is on the 8th of april if you have a chance

02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:32.600
Please look at it. See it if you can it's going to be one of the longest ones ever and uh

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:40.440
It's very close to my house. So if you really are going to be around and you want to meet, uh, I would like that

02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:46.200
So, um, let me know via email or something like that. See you at the eclipse and I got to go play some hoops

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:48.920
some hoops

02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:53.080
Yes, sweetheart

02:29:58.120 --> 02:29:58.920
First

02:29:58.920 --> 02:29:59.880
Rocky

02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:02.840
Okay, I'll put that one on right now and then and then I'll do the rest

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:09.880
But you got to get the you got to get the speaker and stuff. I'm going to put rocky on this one and then and then you can

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:14.120
Yeah, the rocky that you like

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:18.440
Here car no rocky to the one you saw yesterday here comes

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:29.320
So

02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:59.320
So

02:31:27.320 --> 02:31:29.320
So

02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:59.320
So

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:29.320
So

02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:31.320
So

02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:58.040
All right, I gotta put some music on the trampoline for my daughter and that means this stream is over

02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:01.880
Thank you very much for joining me and I will see you again tomorrow ladies and gentlemen. Bye. Bye
