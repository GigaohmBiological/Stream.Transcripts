WEBVTT

00:29.148 --> 00:29.228
Oh

00:44.791 --> 00:45.912
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:45.952 --> 00:46.733
Welcome to the show.

00:46.793 --> 00:52.057
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

00:52.097 --> 00:52.998
Thank you for joining me.

00:53.058 --> 00:55.280
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.342
The message is very clear.

00:57.402 --> 00:58.563
This is for all the marbles.

00:58.623 --> 01:05.148
This is about the children, the grandchildren of Earth, and that's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America.

01:05.728 --> 01:07.110
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.071
I want us to seek the truth together.

01:09.131 --> 01:12.014
I want us to start to understand why endemicity is

01:12.794 --> 01:13.594
is an illusion.

01:13.614 --> 01:14.815
It's a mythology.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.895
Everything is based on this myth.

01:17.535 --> 01:22.297
The idea that an RNA molecule can go from a mud puddle to everywhere.

01:22.897 --> 01:25.378
And there is no biological basis for that idea.

01:25.818 --> 01:28.579
There is a great biological basis for taking a

01:29.719 --> 01:40.063
irreducibly complex background of genetic signals, and using a very shitty set of non-specific PCR tests, pretending that something's spreading when it's not.

01:40.904 --> 01:45.125
They made the transfections safe by rolling them out with placebo.

01:45.165 --> 01:51.508
This also made it really easy to talk about hitting a billion-shot manufacturing target without sneezing at it.

01:51.988 --> 01:58.791
And finally, using their test to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real, nor does it make you a Ghostbuster, but there were people all over the internet

01:59.691 --> 02:02.813
telling you that that was exactly what you needed to be fighting for.

02:02.933 --> 02:12.920
More tests, more sequencing, the virus is evolving, and in reality this was all carefully timed decades in the making.

02:13.781 --> 02:17.904
The Human Genome Project needs to collect this data before it's gone.

02:18.769 --> 02:22.612
collect the data from this population pyramid before it collapses.

02:23.233 --> 02:28.117
All the population pyramids in the Western world and in China are in danger of collapse.

02:28.737 --> 02:44.290
The population pyramid of India isn't too in danger of collapse, but this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that can be seen clearly in that population pyramid there of the United States was used to create the illusion of a pandemic.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.672
They whined about people in hospitals when they knew it was gonna be more.

02:48.453 --> 02:53.323
They whined about a respiratory disease in the hospitals when they knew there would be more.

02:54.044 --> 02:56.829
And then they called it viral so that they didn't have to treat it.

02:57.895 --> 02:59.556
And so again, I can't stress enough.

02:59.656 --> 03:03.398
If you just look at this graph right here, you can already see that it's rising.

03:03.479 --> 03:20.669
And if you look at the Y-axis, you can see that what was a fluctuation between 50,000 and 60,000 deaths per week in America back in 2014 has become a fluctuation between 70,000 and 60,000 per week.

03:21.550 --> 03:25.913
And that was an anticipated rise that you could see in the population pyramid

03:26.792 --> 03:28.894
temporal graph that I just showed you.

03:29.935 --> 03:46.529
And you can see that by taking this all cause mortality, maybe taking good care of some old folks for an extra year, and then a little bit of murder and lies could have sculpted that into something that they could misconstrue as a pandemic if they just showed it to you like this.

03:47.109 --> 03:48.711
And that is precisely what they did.

03:50.066 --> 03:57.696
Now the trick is to remember that in all the other graphs around the world, this signal is comparatively small, especially in 2020 and 2021.

03:58.697 --> 04:06.967
And that's because they specifically murdered people in America by a whole list of reasons to take advantage of this rise in all cause mortality.

04:07.927 --> 04:12.789
sculpted it using murder and lies, and those murder and lies can be codified in a list.

04:13.129 --> 04:17.750
Many of them are present in the trial of Grace Shara.

04:18.410 --> 04:26.193
The question is, will they adequately represent this as what it really is?

04:26.293 --> 04:27.993
And the mistake is already being made.

04:28.033 --> 04:34.295
I'll just say it, that Mary Talley Bowden is on Joe Rogan saying that they euthanized these people.

04:35.035 --> 04:36.856
They euthanized people.

04:38.083 --> 04:49.847
But the problem with that is Mary Bowden, and I think Mary Bowden must know this, and I think Joe Rogan must just be an idiot, but to euthanize someone requires informed consent.

04:51.327 --> 04:54.528
In order to euthanize someone, you need informed consent.

04:55.708 --> 05:07.592
And so is Mary Talley Bowden really so bad at basic biological ethics that she would misconstrue blatant murder as euthanizing people in hospitals?

05:09.400 --> 05:17.102
would she call the intentional euthanization of, that's what she called it, intentionally euthanizing people.

05:17.202 --> 05:27.125
No, that's not possible because euthanizing people implies that it's intentional and it implies that you have informed consent.

05:28.485 --> 05:37.088
And so it looks like the script that's been provided to Mary Talley Bowden by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan is now falling apart.

05:37.964 --> 05:41.447
because they have no more words to describe it besides murder.

05:41.887 --> 05:43.628
And they're still not calling it murder.

05:44.569 --> 05:47.351
They're calling it intentional euthanization.

05:51.977 --> 06:12.397
And now you can see that there's getting very little room left to interpret Maurice Talley Bowden as anything but either an idiot or a willing collaborator in this absolutely malevolent script that has used murder in America, has used murder in America to lie about the pandemic phenomenon around the world.

06:13.908 --> 06:29.013
and maybe murder in Scotland and a few other places, but in particular in America, because there were places, of course, that locked down and didn't experience this and experienced versions of the virus that were evolutionarily behind, you know, like less than this.

06:29.093 --> 06:30.454
Where did my fricking coffee go?

06:32.035 --> 06:33.115
Maybe I didn't get any yet.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.375
Sorry, I didn't mean to say it like that.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.356
I just lost it, though.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.196
I don't know where it went.

06:37.276 --> 06:38.716
Maybe it's because it's still coming.

06:39.256 --> 06:40.677
So RNA cannot pandemic.

06:40.737 --> 06:43.297
Intramuscular injection is really not medicine.

06:43.937 --> 06:48.838
Transfecting healthy people was always a crime, and that's why they needed a lot of these people out there not to say it.

06:50.538 --> 06:59.000
And why that recording from 2022 from Heather Haying is so damning because, again, I told her in 2021, I explained it.

07:01.494 --> 07:05.096
frame by frame on signal.

07:05.236 --> 07:22.846
And there are other people who were in that signal chat that are also guilty in this crime of not telling people that it was transfection all along, of not allowing people to have the informed consent that this had nothing to do with vaccines, nevermind the fact that vaccines themselves are a myth.

07:24.141 --> 07:46.068
And that's where the confounding hamster wheel that was present on social media was virtually impossible for any of us to see through, because even the people that were arguing with each other were on the same malevolent script, avoiding the discussion of the population pyramid, the problem that needed managing, and the biological signal that could be misconstrued as the myth of a novel virus.

07:49.181 --> 07:51.463
I mean, we can't win any better than this.

07:51.563 --> 08:04.291
If in the first five minutes of my stream, I can always explain it just the same way with different words, just randomly pulling them out, just trying to make the point.

08:05.432 --> 08:16.179
It is very hard to interpret the last six years any other way than as a military operation orchestrated on social media by actors put in place.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.569
And yes, behind them is this bad biology.

08:21.609 --> 08:29.778
They're protecting this mythology of biology 101 that lazy, irresponsible people have put on us over these many decades.

08:31.119 --> 08:38.327
But ultimately, in order to understand what I'm saying on this slide right here, you don't need to go very deep into the biology.

08:39.790 --> 08:44.454
Because everything that we believe about evolution is based on DNA, not RNA.

08:44.514 --> 08:56.845
And DNA has all these magical chemical and physical properties that allow it to be the flawless transmitter of heredity over millions of years of evolution according to their bad biology.

08:58.266 --> 09:02.570
And yet RNA possesses none of those magical qualities at all.

09:03.669 --> 09:12.976
and instead wanders around in a world where one of the most common enzymes is an enzyme that degrades RNA, RNase.

09:13.717 --> 09:14.397
It's everywhere.

09:16.819 --> 09:18.200
Now that's pretty remarkable.

09:20.062 --> 09:29.329
You don't need to learn a lot of biology to understand that intramuscular injection is not medicine because your immune system isn't designed that way because

09:30.467 --> 09:38.231
Virtually any exposure to a poison by any other means is better than having it injected via needle into your muscle.

09:39.472 --> 09:39.912
Anything.

09:41.433 --> 09:49.138
And you can make the analogy of any potentially toxified mixture of substances and then just run down the list.

09:49.178 --> 09:50.538
What if I put it in my eye?

09:50.578 --> 09:52.860
What if I smeared it on my face?

09:53.540 --> 09:54.621
What if I ate it?

09:54.901 --> 09:56.782
What if I accidentally inhaled it?

09:58.288 --> 10:00.329
What if I put it in a needle and injected it?

10:01.709 --> 10:04.990
And you can put virtually anything in that blank.

10:06.271 --> 10:12.293
And you can see why putting it in a needle and injecting it is, it just becomes absurd.

10:13.853 --> 10:26.338
And for only some very, very interesting pure substances diluted in saline, could you even imagine a scenario where intramuscular injection might be equivalent to IV?

10:30.037 --> 10:31.378
And then you see the issue, right?

10:31.418 --> 10:35.260
Because none of you would think about using an IV drug casually.

10:38.262 --> 10:48.888
But you're fine with the doctor just kind of, you know, or a nurse even just kind of, you know, putting something in there, maybe on both sides.

10:50.389 --> 10:56.173
And we were all brought there by a malevolent machine that started all the way back with HIV.

10:58.058 --> 11:26.367
all the way back with chronic fatigue syndrome, all the way back with Judy Mikovits' show on Nevada Public TV, all the way back to when Robert Malone still thought that in 10 years there would be geneticists in every hospital curing diseases with retroviruses, all the way back to the original lie of David Baltimore about discovering reverse transcriptase and it not being a enzyme inside of our own cells in our own body.

11:29.321 --> 11:36.931
Ladies and gentlemen, you don't need to be a biological expert to understand that this was always called transfection before the pandemic.

11:36.971 --> 11:45.022
And so it was vital and super important, like ridiculously important for them to get out in front of it and make sure that nobody ever realized that.

11:46.172 --> 12:00.835
The only excuse that we've been given is that Robert Malone was lied to by Peter Cullis about the fact that this particular lipid nanoparticle would do something different than all the other lipid nanoparticles that came before it, and that's go everywhere without control.

12:02.755 --> 12:08.936
We were lied to directly on our silly part of the internet by Robert Wallace Malone.

12:09.756 --> 12:12.317
That Peter Cullis told him, lied to him,

12:13.601 --> 12:20.467
about the localization of a lipid nanoparticle by a guy who knows that lipid nanoparticles never stay where they're put.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.649
They go to the liver and to platelets.

12:24.030 --> 12:38.362
And there are hundreds of papers that describe this as the default, and therefore probably what we should focus on if we're going to use lipid nanoparticles for anything, platelet therapy and liver-directed therapy.

12:41.400 --> 12:58.711
And yesterday I showed you a video of the FDA director and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research director bragging about the fact that they had used a lipid nanoparticle to transform or transfect the liver of a newborn to try and edit its genome with CRISPR-Cas9.

13:01.758 --> 13:03.319
And that's not by accident.

13:03.379 --> 13:04.899
We are not there by accident.

13:04.919 --> 13:19.166
We are there by a carefully scripted narrative produced by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and other people involved in this who I'm sure are not out on social media making fools of themselves because they're not paid to do it.

13:21.246 --> 13:24.507
I don't think Robert Malone is going to enjoy his job very much longer.

13:24.607 --> 13:28.328
I don't think that Kevin McKernan is going to be around much longer.

13:28.348 --> 13:30.629
I don't think they can keep promoting Kevin McCairn.

13:30.709 --> 13:35.090
Now Kevin McCairn is on the sub stack of Peter McCullough.

13:37.351 --> 13:44.193
Like this, this is going to break because this truth could have come out in 2021, maybe even the end of 2020.

13:45.474 --> 13:46.154
And instead of the,

13:49.935 --> 14:16.961
health freedom movement splintering into a million pieces that are all headed by these malevolent actors like World Council for Health, and Heart, and Panda, and the International COVID Summits, and IMA that was originally FLCCC, and Brownstone, and Children's Health Defense, and ICANN, and Door to Freedom, and Rescue the Republic.

14:18.251 --> 14:39.364
and the NCI in Canada, instead of coming all together on a simple banner, we keep organizing around abstract things like rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lying, courage over fear, or abstract things like, man, Dr. Cooey don't have anything to say.

14:40.677 --> 14:42.398
You don't have to support me.

14:42.839 --> 15:02.855
You don't have to share any of my work other than this slide right here and find some MD or some PhD or some MD PhD who can explain to me why RNA can pandemic, who can explain to me why intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is a great idea.

15:03.256 --> 15:05.798
And here's the nearly endless list of examples.

15:07.981 --> 15:23.392
Why won't anybody prove to me that this wasn't always just a transfection and there was no reason to believe that Peter Cullis had invented anything other than a new manufacturing process that would allow all of that to be, I don't know, patented?

15:24.233 --> 15:25.854
Claimed as intellectual property?

15:25.894 --> 15:28.636
Because otherwise it would just be lipid nanoparticles.

15:32.090 --> 15:41.833
The fact that nobody's on this idea, nobody's paying attention to how the intellectual property space and biologics has changed over the last five years as a result of what's gone on here.

15:42.294 --> 15:47.255
It's all just, you know, Elon Musk is not having good friendship with Mr. Trumpy Trump.

15:51.237 --> 15:57.379
America is under attack and we are chasing myths and ghosts and mysteries and bullshit.

15:59.517 --> 16:04.360
And it doesn't matter what side of the political narrative you're on, you're lost, because it's very simple.

16:09.783 --> 16:15.226
And they're hiding it behind this bad biology that everybody thinks they understand, and it's very simple, and it's not.

16:17.193 --> 16:33.900
actually j.j cooey's insistence and i think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines actually j.j cooey's insistence and i think he's right on calling them transfections rather than vaccines actually j.j cooey's

16:36.587 --> 16:40.591
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

16:40.731 --> 16:42.353
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

16:42.393 --> 16:43.053
Thank you very much.

16:43.094 --> 16:44.315
Can you hear me better now or not?

16:44.655 --> 16:45.556
Yes, much better.

16:46.277 --> 16:54.725
It was really like it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

16:55.025 --> 16:58.569
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

17:05.053 --> 17:08.657
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

17:08.677 --> 17:13.321
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

17:13.361 --> 17:17.485
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

17:17.985 --> 17:21.068
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

17:41.013 --> 17:48.341
And if this is scripted bullshit, and this is scripted bullshit, then where are we?

17:49.763 --> 17:51.305
Who's running Marty Makary?

17:51.365 --> 17:53.247
Who's running Vinay Prasad?

17:53.307 --> 17:55.229
Who's behind these puppets?

17:55.349 --> 17:57.712
Because these are not real people.

17:59.690 --> 18:03.012
That's the question you need to be asking now, and I think it's a Trojan horse.

18:03.072 --> 18:04.033
I think we're under attack.

18:04.053 --> 18:10.738
There are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like J.J.

18:10.778 --> 18:27.009
Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people, as sort of this kind of savant or idiot or something that, whose ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learned, and in many ways, you know, they are.

18:32.332 --> 18:36.433
I will contend that this was a national security operation from day one.

18:36.513 --> 18:45.296
I will contend that because this was a national security operation, we have all come to accept PCR as an accepted diagnostic standard.

18:46.276 --> 18:49.537
We've also come to accept sequencing as a high fidelity measurement.

18:50.786 --> 18:57.651
We've come to accept intramuscular injection as proven beyond question as a methodology in medicine.

18:58.451 --> 19:04.175
We have come to accept that RNA obviously has huge military potential because it can go by itself.

19:05.296 --> 19:15.923
It has nothing to do with how much you can make or how much recombinant DNA you can make and the fact that you can put that places and it might do things, that you can transfect things.

19:17.179 --> 19:21.629
They want you to believe that RNA can do something all by itself, and in fact we've come to believe that.

19:22.210 --> 19:26.279
We've also come to believe that Trump was shot about an hour north of my house.

19:27.558 --> 19:30.619
by a kid who went to the same high school as my kid goes to.

19:31.159 --> 19:39.342
But we don't know anything about that kid and we're not supposed to care because his presence on social media is irrelevant to understanding what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania.

19:40.202 --> 19:50.585
His sons are also not curious about all about the scar and Donald Trump doesn't have a big enough ego to brag about his scar or his absolutely amazing surgeon.

19:52.307 --> 19:58.971
Also, the mystery of the lab leak was solved, and it's pretty much figured out that this probably came from a laboratory.

19:59.592 --> 20:15.101
So America's health problems are gonna be more complicated than we thought to solve, because there's, of course, everything from petroleum-based dyes to seed oils to toxins in the water and fluoride and glyphosate and chemtrails.

20:15.181 --> 20:20.685
And so it's gonna be complicated, but we should all be very happy because at least Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:21.585 --> 20:24.207
got in as Health and Human Services Secretary.

20:24.247 --> 20:28.470
Now, I think that's all bullshit play.

20:29.491 --> 20:31.992
I don't think that actually was the plan.

20:32.032 --> 20:35.575
I think the best way to what I would describe it, I drew it over here.

20:35.615 --> 20:36.836
Maybe I'm not going to draw it again.

20:36.876 --> 20:38.757
I'll just show you what I was looking at.

20:38.797 --> 20:42.800
I drew this this morning right before the thing.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.741
So this is the notes I was taking yesterday.

20:45.582 --> 20:49.865
So what I think they did was they did this little Trojan horse with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

20:49.905 --> 20:50.686
These guys are all

20:51.546 --> 20:56.328
It's really a Trojan donkey because a lot of them are actually just Democrats, lifelong Democrats.

20:56.348 --> 21:03.431
You know, a lot of them give a lot of money to the Democratic National Committee like Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:03.471 --> 21:18.817
And so as Peter Hotez so eloquently stated on the ZDogg podcast in 2019, one of the few issues that can unite the far left and the far right in America is the anti-vax issue.

21:19.554 --> 21:21.936
the skepticism, the health freedom idea.

21:22.476 --> 21:39.147
And so interestingly enough, I think that people like Steve Bannon understood this and people working the national security beat in America who realized that there was a rise in all cause mortality coming and they were gonna have to do something with it and about it.

21:39.808 --> 21:47.373
It was an opportunity, a once in a multi-generational opportunity to reorganize the way that we govern our populace.

21:48.533 --> 21:58.864
And so they created this illusion of a pandemic and they anticipated that both people on the left and people on the right would resist it, would speak out against it.

21:59.565 --> 22:05.932
They've already tested it and seen what happens with AIDS and with chronic fatigue syndrome and with these other, they know.

22:07.895 --> 22:11.478
And so they spun us into this health freedom movement.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.519
They had this health freedom movement ready to go.

22:13.579 --> 22:24.067
That's why Columbia professor and strangely androgynous Mary Holland finds herself in all these weird pictures with all these real people.

22:24.827 --> 22:29.771
That's why Mary Holland is in all those pictures with all those real people who are now dead.

22:32.369 --> 22:45.078
like Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn, both of whom died in 2020, the same year that Robert F. Kennedy decided to promote none other than Judy Mikovits from his house.

22:47.580 --> 22:50.843
Also a lady who has a lot of people die around her.

22:51.063 --> 22:54.386
And also a lady who was on stage with Brandy Vaughn who's dead.

22:55.106 --> 22:56.047
Interesting, that is.

22:56.748 --> 23:05.335
Anyway, so if you rooted for him, you know, then you might be satisfied with him as Health and Human Services Secretary.

23:05.435 --> 23:10.039
And if you were afraid of him, then you're just glad that he didn't get to be president.

23:10.779 --> 23:12.340
Holy shit, can you imagine that?

23:13.291 --> 23:18.337
And so this play worked perfectly, much in the same way that the Trump play works.

23:19.299 --> 23:22.323
Because if you don't like Trump, well, then he is a weapon against you.

23:22.343 --> 23:24.485
And if you like Trump, well, he's a weapon against you.

23:24.846 --> 23:31.014
It's the same with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., if he's on the same team as Trump and Hillary Clinton and Obama and all these other people.

23:32.168 --> 23:47.774
Because then if you liked Robert F. Kennedy Jr., well, then you just got Marty McCary and Vinay Prasad and Jayanta Bhattacharya, all of whom have no allegiance to America at all, into the highest places in HHS, and you got a stooge at the top.

23:52.636 --> 23:57.098
I really think that it's a Trojan horse, and I don't even know if Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

23:57.138 --> 24:01.080
is clever enough to know how played we have been as a country.

24:01.795 --> 24:05.217
and how much he has betrayed the grandchildren of America.

24:05.357 --> 24:10.500
I'm, I'm, I'm very happy to say that, um, I don't, I don't know.

24:11.321 --> 24:12.182
I really don't know.

24:12.762 --> 24:14.343
I just know that this is bullshit.

24:14.523 --> 24:22.348
I know for sure that this little lineup of people, these people being where they are, the story that they have.

24:25.836 --> 24:42.743
their connections to the FDA and its modernization during the time of Estes Kefauver, his dad and his dad, his dad, his wife, his connections to Goldman Sachs, Aaron Siri's connection to Goldman Sachs.

24:42.803 --> 24:46.445
These aren't very hard conspiracy maps to make anymore.

24:46.965 --> 24:48.346
They're not very hard to see.

24:49.026 --> 24:54.889
The infiltration of foreigners with dual passports into our government is not very hard to see.

24:55.765 --> 24:58.167
They put them all on the same screen at the same time.

24:58.227 --> 25:00.409
Sometimes they all do podcasts together.

25:01.189 --> 25:07.895
And yet, the mainstream media can't see it, the right can't see it, the investigative people like Kim Iverson can't see it.

25:07.955 --> 25:10.377
Boy, it's hard to tell what's going on.

25:12.068 --> 25:23.575
Even people like Dan Cohen are so focused on Israel and Gaza and Zionism and Judaism and making sure people know the definition of all those words that they aren't able to see that the U.S.

25:23.635 --> 25:28.018
government has been completely undermined except through the lens of that.

25:28.558 --> 25:32.601
Because of course that guy is totally Zionist or something like that.

25:33.677 --> 25:35.378
It's all bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

25:35.418 --> 25:35.958
I'm sorry.

25:36.018 --> 25:47.965
If you want to save America, you got to see that there are obvious pressure points, obvious ways to undermine the current administration and justify just throwing them out.

25:51.095 --> 25:52.976
And it doesn't matter if you're left or right.

25:52.996 --> 25:54.718
You could see this if you're on the right.

25:55.098 --> 25:56.539
You can see it if you're on the left.

25:57.039 --> 26:08.348
If you were a former, you know, Joe Biden and Harris supporter and you wanted to discredit the Trump administration, I've got it for you right here.

26:08.528 --> 26:12.251
I can go on for hours about why they should be discredited.

26:12.311 --> 26:14.032
They should be suspected.

26:15.990 --> 26:17.810
of covering up the murder in America.

26:18.030 --> 26:23.431
And we can, of course, delineate what murder in America we're specifically talking about and how you might find it.

26:25.052 --> 26:44.035
But we have somebody like John Baldwin running around with Steve Kirsch, ignoring the fact, not looking at any medical records to find out how many, what percentage of these people that they claim died from the shot, or died from COVID, or died from whatever, started by going to the hospital and accepting supplementary oxygen.

26:46.550 --> 26:51.974
They're so unable to say it, it's kind of comical for how long we've been saying it.

26:52.034 --> 27:11.970
It's in fact, I think the reason why Jessica Hockett burnt her relationship with us, because we started to realize that when we put two and two together with the Kyle Seidel video and the Pierre Kory show, that only she was able to provoke a multiple sub stack video response from Pierre Kory point to point.

27:13.490 --> 27:30.814
Only she was able to get an audience with the staff of His Grace, Senator Ron Johnson, even though Senator Ron Johnson called me in April of 2022 in my front yard and told me that Robert Malone sat him down and said, watch this guy's stream.

27:31.954 --> 27:32.694
Stop lying.

27:33.414 --> 27:35.195
We have been played, ladies and gentlemen.

27:35.255 --> 27:37.215
Unfortunately, I have been played like a fiddle.

27:38.476 --> 27:45.298
by a lot of these people who only in retrospect can I see how malevolently orchestrated their bullshit was.

27:47.179 --> 27:51.980
So malevolently orchestrated, I think I have a wonderful book in the works.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.121
Trump's shooting was faked.

27:54.621 --> 27:56.361
The mystery was the enchantment.

27:56.401 --> 28:03.203
In other words, solving the mystery of the lab leak is what has convinced everybody that COVID was real, that it really happened.

28:03.243 --> 28:04.964
And then you have people like, you know,

28:06.304 --> 28:12.447
Peter McCullough and Pierre Corey running around telling you all the real they saw, all the real, all the time.

28:12.947 --> 28:14.828
So Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:14.888 --> 28:18.409
as HHS Secretary is just a distraction.

28:19.129 --> 28:21.230
It's supposed to make you feel like we want a goal.

28:21.290 --> 28:26.132
But actually, the debate about Cali means and Casey means is a distraction from this.

28:27.102 --> 28:28.383
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:28.463 --> 28:47.079
is the Trojan horse, the, I don't know if the Manchurian candidate fits, but he was basically brought to believe that he had a chance to win the White House, and they played him like a fiddle, and now they have him there doing whatever they tell him to do, saying that he prayed to God and God brought him Trump.

28:48.620 --> 28:49.241
Come on.

28:50.382 --> 28:51.102
Come on!

28:51.623 --> 28:55.366
How many times did he repeat that line, that he prays 30 minutes a day?

28:57.662 --> 28:58.863
And God brought him Trump.

29:00.023 --> 29:01.504
He didn't say it just once.

29:03.725 --> 29:07.626
Solving America's health problems is not on the agenda, ladies and gentlemen.

29:07.786 --> 29:12.868
Inverting our children's sovereignty to experimental animal status is on the agenda.

29:13.409 --> 29:16.250
The Trump administration did not submit a budget.

29:18.134 --> 29:20.055
This is not a first-time president.

29:20.095 --> 29:22.257
This is not a first-time administration.

29:22.337 --> 29:24.138
He's had four years to plan.

29:24.619 --> 29:26.500
He's had four years to strategize.

29:26.540 --> 29:33.325
He's had four years to populate a potential cabinet and staff that would whoop some serious patriotic ass.

29:33.485 --> 29:35.567
Instead, he came into office.

29:37.228 --> 29:41.491
He's sending the National Guard to do what?

29:44.333 --> 29:46.415
He's having a fight with Elon Musk?

29:48.971 --> 29:53.395
He's talking about Bitcoin and opening his own crypto coin.

29:54.737 --> 30:00.903
Blatantly taking money from foreign governments and everybody's supposed to get all angry about it.

30:00.923 --> 30:02.784
The incompetence is here.

30:04.186 --> 30:10.132
The sabotage is at the NIH and at the FDA and at the HHS.

30:11.092 --> 30:12.454
It's not the crypto shit.

30:17.725 --> 30:19.607
Palantir making a database?

30:19.807 --> 30:22.109
Ooh, like they didn't already do that.

30:23.109 --> 30:27.713
Palantir was in charge of the data for the Israeli vax rollout.

30:27.793 --> 30:33.978
Palantir is in charge of the data for the deployment of military action in Israel.

30:34.339 --> 30:41.925
Palantir is responsible for so many things that when they announced that Palantir is building a database, who gives a shit?

30:41.965 --> 30:42.966
Of course they are.

30:43.526 --> 30:44.447
They already did.

30:53.566 --> 30:56.107
On every slide, the first slide, I have quotes.

30:56.147 --> 31:01.790
And I know that you don't read them at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

31:02.050 --> 31:03.091
But this one is pretty cool.

31:03.451 --> 31:06.192
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

31:06.912 --> 31:10.154
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

31:10.774 --> 31:18.287
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the Queen, why sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

31:18.588 --> 31:21.012
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

31:21.032 --> 31:23.276
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

31:24.890 --> 31:34.040
the masks, or behind, you know, proper testing, or behind the six-foot distancing, the two-meter distancing, or behind these shots, right, this technology that has never been used widely.

31:34.581 --> 31:36.403
None of that is over.

31:36.523 --> 31:40.348
And as Sasha Latifa pointed out this morning, you know, these were

31:40.848 --> 31:44.830
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

31:45.090 --> 31:47.731
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

31:48.211 --> 31:52.392
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

31:52.453 --> 31:55.514
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

31:56.854 --> 32:04.517
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

32:04.977 --> 32:06.418
All of that was on a global basis.

32:07.196 --> 32:09.539
All of that was on an American basis.

32:09.599 --> 32:10.640
She's a liar.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.302
You can sort of feel it in people.

32:14.104 --> 32:14.805
And I have lied.

32:14.825 --> 32:15.866
I'm sure I'll lie again.

32:15.886 --> 32:16.828
I don't want to lie.

32:17.308 --> 32:18.650
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.811
I try not to be a liar.

32:19.831 --> 32:20.672
I don't want to be a liar.

32:21.253 --> 32:23.956
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

32:28.226 --> 32:30.929
A condition that we will not call autism.

32:31.069 --> 32:32.631
I don't like the word autism.

32:33.512 --> 32:34.573
He was vaccine damaged.

32:34.933 --> 32:36.355
He was neurologically damaged.

32:37.115 --> 32:39.798
A condition that we will not call autism.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.500
I don't like the word autism.

32:42.401 --> 32:43.422
He was vaccine damaged.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.448
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

32:51.258 --> 32:51.978
And I have lied.

32:51.998 --> 32:53.039
I'm sure I'll lie again.

32:53.059 --> 32:53.999
I don't want to lie.

32:54.459 --> 32:55.800
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.940
I try not to be a liar.

32:56.980 --> 32:57.821
I don't want to be a liar.

32:58.401 --> 33:01.102
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

33:21.712 --> 33:31.557
We could call them peasants or poor people or they're jungle people coming out of native cultures that haven't had the benefit of a Western education, choosing my words.

33:32.658 --> 33:36.279
And so they would have these vaccine campaigns for yellow fever.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.041
These people would go get their yellow fever shot.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.762
And then they would say, well, if one is good, two is better.

33:42.122 --> 33:42.923
They get back in line.

33:43.703 --> 33:44.984
And they get another shot, they kill them.

33:45.882 --> 33:55.368
OK, that that's that's the nature of these hotter live attenuated vaccines is it's just a question like everything of getting the dose right.

33:55.849 --> 33:57.770
And if you exceed it, it'll get you.

34:01.352 --> 34:06.976
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

34:07.637 --> 34:14.222
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

34:14.342 --> 34:19.866
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

34:20.166 --> 34:22.127
It's just a big hassle in the end.

34:25.270 --> 34:38.477
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

34:38.537 --> 34:41.079
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

34:43.660 --> 34:44.020
Concerned.

34:44.040 --> 34:52.525
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

34:58.690 --> 35:19.126
I don't care how you get there.

35:19.146 --> 35:21.828
I don't care what you do to get there.

35:21.848 --> 35:24.410
The goal is to win.

35:29.202 --> 35:57.407
All right, let's start this show up I know that I do a lot of introductions lately I've kind of was I was trying to avoid that stuff and and start right away with the main programming but it just seems really important right now to make sure that every stream I start with a very succinct message about what actually happened because

35:57.987 --> 36:08.599
So many people want to start out by saying that, you know, I'm calling too many people out, or I'm a creep, or I'm mean for saying that people are not sending the right thing to me.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.453
It's all on X, it's all on social media.

36:11.493 --> 36:16.734
The only non-compliance that matters is getting off of social media, because that's where these people perform.

36:17.314 --> 36:22.995
That's where they perform this ridiculous performance where they claim they haven't learned anything in five years.

36:24.016 --> 36:29.597
And six years, they still haven't figured out that Autism Spectrum Disorder is obviously a myth.

36:30.197 --> 36:34.018
You know, that's preventing people from under- Oh wait, what happened there?

36:34.258 --> 36:36.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.304
I think we need a new, we gotta go here.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.647
There we go.

36:40.667 --> 36:41.007
Sorry, Brett.

36:41.047 --> 36:41.408
Brian, Brett.

36:47.120 --> 36:54.166
Um, intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

36:54.607 --> 37:00.392
And in fact, that's why they used a pandemic narrative of gain of function to coerce us into believing the same things.

37:00.932 --> 37:08.379
Worse yet, we're in danger of teaching this to the next generation and that would be a disaster because they will be enslaved by that mythology.

37:08.919 --> 37:13.242
If you don't understand why the cheese is free on social media, then you will die in that trap.

37:13.803 --> 37:14.764
And I really mean that.

37:15.344 --> 37:16.245
This is important.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.006
We need to get our kids off of it.

37:18.046 --> 37:19.487
We need to get ourselves off of it.

37:20.008 --> 37:30.276
Because the only reason why they can achieve the level of ignoring this biology that they've been able to achieve is because of our general acquiescence to social media.

37:31.476 --> 37:36.700
If you continue to try and find the truth using social media as a tool, you won't find it.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.243
And if you continue to try and encourage people to do that, they won't find it.

37:41.263 --> 37:43.044
You have to share this stream directly.

37:43.064 --> 37:45.806
You have to share GigaOMBiological.com.

37:45.826 --> 37:47.747
You have to share a clip that Jeff has made.

37:48.207 --> 37:52.350
You have to share these images, these ideas, these slide decks.

37:53.210 --> 38:08.424
You have to do something besides retweeting and besides playing their game because if you don't stay focused on the biology and don't stop taking their bait on social media and loving your neighbor instead, you know, loving your neighbor by sending them an email, it won't get anywhere.

38:09.345 --> 38:11.587
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cui.

38:11.607 --> 38:13.689
I'm Chief Biologist at Gigoland Biological.

38:13.729 --> 38:17.672
I come to you live out of the garage of my house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

38:18.093 --> 38:24.578
You can see the evidence of my academic work on the National Library of Medicine website, PubMed.

38:25.059 --> 38:33.946
You can also see my ideas poorly represented on a substack called Woodhouse 76 that's currently written by a trader from, I believe, Chicago, Illinois.

38:33.986 --> 38:35.328
Her name is Jessica Hockett.

38:36.008 --> 38:39.551
He is collaborating with a couple people from other countries.

38:40.072 --> 38:43.815
One from the UK by the name of Jonathan Engler in Panda and Heart.

38:44.435 --> 38:48.499
And one by the name of Nick Hudson in Panda of South Africa.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.002
And these people are all malevolent traders.

38:52.062 --> 38:54.104
They're all primarily active on X.

38:55.205 --> 38:58.328
which just happens to be the platform of Elon Musk.

38:58.768 --> 39:17.626
And so I think it's pretty easy to see it now, although people are not going to want to accept it, that just our acquiescence to running to the truth on social media and thinking that the problem was being solved on X, that the argument that we needed to participate in was in the town hall meeting on X, that's why we're losing.

39:21.405 --> 39:32.591
And in fact, you know, that was what I was also encouraged to do while I was working for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while I worked for Children's Health Defense, we were encouraged to believe that X was important.

39:33.031 --> 39:45.318
And in fact, when I took this picture, or actually it's neither of these pictures, there's another picture actually, that I took with Jay Bhattacharya, he suggested that I put that on Twitter right now and everybody will really freak out.

39:48.311 --> 40:03.595
And of course I didn't post it, because I don't do what I'm told, and because I've never really understood why it would be that this random dude from the Great Barrington Declaration would show up at a broken science meeting where Rodney Mullen had brought me.

40:10.396 --> 40:11.737
Anyway, now this

40:12.794 --> 40:19.277
I believe, traitor to America's grandchildren, is at the head of NIH and he has no professional business being there.

40:20.098 --> 40:26.761
This guy's at the head of HHS and I'm afraid that he might be, well, a shell of a man.

40:27.681 --> 40:40.888
We have a Columbia professor and, I don't know, co-opted former government genetic research employee, Brian Hooker, at the head of Children's Health Defense.

40:42.292 --> 41:08.762
And these are all front organizations that have essentially co-opted any useful resistance that would have formed in America to the pandemic and to the ever-expanded vaccination schedule, specifically in America, and making sure that Americans didn't realize that unlike any other country in the world, their children were being destroyed by intramuscular injection.

41:09.795 --> 41:23.289
That's why Pauly Tommy was on billboards 15 or 20 years ago advocating for autism awareness, not trying to save any children.

41:25.191 --> 41:32.499
That's why Andrew Wakefield was asking for three separate shots and not trying to save any children.

41:33.752 --> 41:38.875
These people are all malevolent actors that have been chosen, groomed, and put in place.

41:39.415 --> 41:44.778
And then social media has been used to promote them in an artificial way that makes them seem legit, but they're not.

41:45.278 --> 41:48.460
One of the worst examples is Asim Malhotra from the UK.

41:49.781 --> 41:51.702
That guy deserves to be run over by a car.

41:53.723 --> 41:56.044
But karma will get all of these people, I'm sure.

41:56.164 --> 42:00.847
At some point, they will realize and come to understand how selling out

42:01.721 --> 42:06.724
future generations of people was a huge mistake.

42:07.805 --> 42:14.308
And selling out the future generations of America to this global operation was a huge mistake.

42:15.129 --> 42:19.091
I'm still streaming to JC in the Woods, although I think I could switch to JC on a bike again.

42:19.932 --> 42:24.314
But I got to be really careful about using copyrighted material because I don't want to get that channel erased.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.877
If you're wondering how this works, it's because there's just a few generous people out there, about 115 people.

42:30.638 --> 42:32.319
Some of them give me $10 a month.

42:32.379 --> 42:34.280
A few of them give me a little more.

42:34.321 --> 42:35.801
A couple of them give me a lot more.

42:36.302 --> 42:46.729
And that results in a budget of less than $4,000 a month that pays for our rent and operates our food and pays the bills plus the credit cards.

42:46.809 --> 42:47.089
That's it.

42:48.274 --> 42:51.995
and the credit cards are growing, but I don't have a choice.

42:52.416 --> 42:53.636
What other things can I do?

42:54.336 --> 42:55.917
I'm getting, I have day job.

42:55.997 --> 43:00.239
I mean, I'll make a little things to make the ends meet, but I can't stop this.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.943
And this needs to be ours.

43:03.043 --> 43:04.765
This needs to be publications.

43:04.825 --> 43:06.186
This needs to be videos.

43:06.246 --> 43:10.170
This needs to be... I mean, this can't stop.

43:10.530 --> 43:11.731
This has to multiply.

43:11.851 --> 43:13.913
And nobody seems to understand that.

43:14.394 --> 43:16.096
Nobody seems to want to spread this.

43:16.156 --> 43:21.441
But if you do, or want to help with it, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to do it.

43:21.881 --> 43:31.483
If you want to download that McKinsey report that will explain to you how devastating the population outlook is in the Western world, you can download it at that link up there called Stuff.

43:31.903 --> 43:42.705
If you want to see my admission as to how I was fooled, you can look at that Scooby link and you can find the review that I wrote that informed Brett Weinstein for his first, this couple years after that.

43:43.185 --> 43:46.786
The review I wrote with, who I think is a arch trader,

43:47.966 --> 43:50.307
Piper Stover, one of the worst liars in this.

43:51.348 --> 43:59.252
And if you want to follow somebody who I think is worth following, I think I would recommend you follow HousatonicITS at housatonicits.com.

43:59.472 --> 44:01.713
He has a YouTube channel and a Twitch channel.

44:02.694 --> 44:15.981
I don't think he can stream on YouTube right now for the same reason that I can't because he's talking about Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn and the realities of this illusion that they've created for the benefit of the Human Genome Project.

44:17.059 --> 44:26.493
And so it's about intellectual property and it's about big plans for a technocracy, about big plans for a once in a multi-generational opportunity to collect data.

44:27.254 --> 44:31.760
And the only people who are going to tell you that are on something called an independent bright web, not the internet,

44:32.754 --> 44:33.975
not on social media.

44:34.615 --> 44:36.376
You're gonna have to share this manually.

44:36.396 --> 44:45.382
You're gonna have to download it from stream.gigaohm.bio and send it to your family and friends because there are hundreds of performers on the internet that aren't gonna do it.

44:45.782 --> 44:52.986
There are hundreds of performers on the internet that are, through internet programming, able to seem like they're doing it when they're not doing it.

44:54.807 --> 44:56.889
Hey, Nick Hudson, can I help you stop that train?

44:57.369 --> 44:57.969
Sure, Jay.

44:58.410 --> 44:59.310
Chalk your hands up.

44:59.690 --> 45:00.371
Help me pull.

45:01.940 --> 45:05.681
Hey, my name's Jessica Hockett and I wanna help get your message out.

45:06.141 --> 45:07.902
Maybe we can do a podcast together.

45:07.922 --> 45:08.422
Yeah, sure.

45:08.862 --> 45:10.262
Grab onto the train, come on.

45:14.003 --> 45:21.025
Hey, my name's Mary Holland and I think one of the components of the MMR vaccine that's not tested injured my son.

45:21.465 --> 45:24.166
Can you help me fight against this?

45:24.206 --> 45:27.166
Can you help me build a big top tent of health freedom?

45:28.027 --> 45:29.647
Just grab onto the train and help me.

45:32.728 --> 45:34.969
But we're not really accomplish anything.

45:35.269 --> 45:39.150
We've been doing this for years and we haven't really accomplished anything, Mary.

45:39.630 --> 45:41.810
No, that's okay because that's not the goal.

45:41.850 --> 45:45.511
We're building a big top 10 of health freedom and Bobby's gonna do the accomplishing.

45:45.892 --> 45:50.293
All we gotta do is facilitate Bobby's rise and then we'll get there.

45:50.353 --> 45:59.415
Don't forget that Mary Holland was his first campaign manager and left his campaign after Laura Bono hired me at CHD.

46:00.115 --> 46:01.956
Mary Holland and Brian Hooker fired me.

46:03.462 --> 46:04.943
and Laura Bono's now retired.

46:06.324 --> 46:06.825
I don't know.

46:06.845 --> 46:08.526
I don't know.

46:08.546 --> 46:10.888
I think it's all scripted bullshit.

46:11.564 --> 46:12.244
That's what I think.

46:12.865 --> 46:16.787
And not only is it scripted bullshit, but they are not gonna go off the script.

46:16.887 --> 46:18.307
That's the part that you need to see.

46:18.347 --> 46:19.608
That's why Pierre Corey's there.

46:19.648 --> 46:23.050
People were mad at me because this was not really understandable.

46:23.090 --> 46:23.710
So just see it.

46:24.110 --> 46:31.434
In 2020, he's streaming with a George Webb associate saying that up to a billion people might die.

46:31.814 --> 46:33.395
In 2024, he was streaming with Charles Rixey

46:40.236 --> 46:50.980
He was streaming with Charles Rixey and Matt Crawford saying that it was clones and that now it's a worst case scenario because of amyloidosis.

46:51.020 --> 46:55.041
And then a few months later, of course, he's on the clot round table.

46:55.501 --> 47:04.284
Don't talk about the fact that transfection, one of the easiest targets for lipid nanoparticles is platelets and platelets are like responsible for clots.

47:04.924 --> 47:06.125
Don't talk about that.

47:07.898 --> 47:11.359
Talk about, you know, the spike protein is causing clots.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.520
Amyloid clots.

47:17.021 --> 47:22.323
And once this guy's worn out, they'll bring in Jordan Vaughn, who's been auditioning for a few years.

47:24.224 --> 47:32.547
But the fact that these two guys were on the same Steve Kirsch Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, Skoll-funded pound...

47:33.772 --> 47:38.335
He's the largest private donor to the Democratic National Committee before the pandemic.

47:38.955 --> 47:43.998
And we're supposed to believe that he invented an optical mouse and that's why he's rich and smart and famous.

47:44.458 --> 47:45.899
And now he's a numbers expert.

47:49.521 --> 47:51.162
Steve Kirsch is a total fraud.

47:53.023 --> 47:56.466
He's one of the most magnificent frauds in front of us right now.

47:56.926 --> 48:02.169
I don't think he could reason his way out of a wet paper bag, even with a Texas Instruments calculator.

48:05.427 --> 48:11.918
And I think Kevin McCarron is a pathetic recruit that they never thought they were going to use in this way.

48:11.958 --> 48:13.401
And now they're using them in this way.

48:13.441 --> 48:18.549
And I'm suggesting to you at this point, there can be no doubt now that he's on the

48:20.396 --> 48:30.918
the Peter McCullough substack or the whatever that other guy is that's been standing in front of Peter McCullough, this is all an admission that it's one malevolent show.

48:31.398 --> 48:44.121
Just like that video from 2021 where Peter McCullough and Cole and Malone are all on the same podcast with some guy called the Street MD, it is an admission that they are all one malevolent show.

48:44.161 --> 48:45.241
They're touring around

48:45.721 --> 49:00.946
in 2021 in churches in the United States with Lee Min Yan, the one who was introduced to us by Steve Bannon on stage when he said she should run for Senate in New York, is an admission that this is all one malevolent show.

49:00.986 --> 49:12.789
The fact that her in-laws isolated SARS, the original virus, and worked for the Cancer Institute for 20 years, and she was married in New York in 2013, says that this is all one malevolent show.

49:15.168 --> 49:25.438
And so Lee Minyan, Kevin McCarren, Kevin McKernan, Charles Rixey, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, they're all part of the same malevolent show.

49:25.959 --> 49:30.063
It's a health freedom movement brought to you by the National Security State.

49:30.103 --> 49:30.804
That's all it is.

49:32.870 --> 49:36.312
and it was put in place on purpose a long time ago.

49:36.753 --> 49:46.199
That's why this jackass started the whole pandemic knowing that it's Andrew Kaufman that we need to oppose because he doesn't think there are any viruses at all.

49:46.860 --> 49:52.684
He believes in the miasma theory and we have to stop this Tom Cohen and she's a whore.

49:53.084 --> 49:54.125
She's a whore.

49:55.806 --> 49:56.987
Bimbo Bailey.

49:59.909 --> 50:04.569
And then two years later, these two guys would do a stream together because you know, Mark can forgive.

50:10.456 --> 50:14.781
case scenario just it's literally turning into worst case.

50:14.801 --> 50:18.925
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

50:19.025 --> 50:32.338
We are dealing with a worst case scenario the internet is flooded with liars and they are they are internationally performing just like this one where in June 5th 2025 Jikki Leak says that they spray clones.

50:32.398 --> 50:33.219
What are clones?

50:34.124 --> 50:40.350
Well, they're recombinant DNA or RNA sequences that they spray around and then they can transfect people.

50:40.931 --> 50:43.914
They can just be found by PCR and claim they're spreading.

50:44.615 --> 50:46.957
And this guy is not going to usefully say that.

50:48.098 --> 50:56.287
This guy's also not denying it anymore, even though when I explained it in 2022, he called it chemtrail retarded on a dedicated substack to me.

50:58.075 --> 51:02.479
This former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project.

51:02.579 --> 51:05.982
This, you know, fighter for freedom from Australia.

51:06.462 --> 51:07.924
Stop lying!

51:08.304 --> 51:16.331
This Jikki Leaks that Jessica Hockett just really hates and is, you know, Nick Hudson is sure that Jikki Leaks is definitely a bad guy.

51:17.151 --> 51:18.433
Stop lying!

51:20.526 --> 51:21.968
It's all one malevolent show.

51:22.008 --> 51:29.175
And if we would not have spent so much time chasing around this stupid mouse army on X, we would have never got caught up in this.

51:31.137 --> 51:32.418
But that's how this was designed.

51:32.439 --> 51:37.604
That's why Kevin McKernan was telling us that the truth is being sorted out on X in 2020.

51:38.445 --> 51:41.488
That's why Kevin McKernan was telling us that the FDA was in the way in 2020.

51:45.410 --> 51:50.772
As many of you have heard this week, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

51:50.853 --> 52:00.417
announced he was removing all 17 city members of the CDC's Vaccine Advisory Committee and replacing them with new members.

52:00.597 --> 52:12.062
Dr. Sean O'Leary is a professor of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and Children's Hospital Colorado.

52:12.122 --> 52:13.543
He's also an investigator

52:14.088 --> 52:26.213
at Adult and Child Center for Outcomes Research and Delivery Science, aka ACORDS, and Director of the Colorado Children's Outcomes Network, a pediatric practice-based research network.

52:26.573 --> 52:31.015
His research focuses on prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases

52:31.428 --> 52:40.678
through understanding clinical, attitudinal, and infrastructural barriers to vaccination and developing and testing interventions to address those barriers.

52:41.138 --> 52:46.624
Woo, Dr. O'Leary, that's a lot, but it sounds- Wow, did you hear what he does?

52:46.724 --> 52:48.165
He doesn't work on vaccines.

52:48.205 --> 52:52.269
He works on institutional and societal barriers to vaccine uptake.

52:53.052 --> 52:54.492
That's a pretty remarkable thing.

52:54.512 --> 52:56.113
You know, I want to break for a second, though.

52:56.573 --> 53:00.514
I wanted to read something to you that I found the other day in my reading.

53:01.634 --> 53:07.156
I've been reading this book again because it's so dense and it took me a long time to finish it the first time.

53:07.696 --> 53:09.056
The Molecular Vision of Life.

53:09.297 --> 53:17.439
It is a book by a Lily E. Kay, and it is a history of Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the rise of the new biology.

53:17.499 --> 53:21.160
Now, the new biology that she's talking about, of course, is the molecular vision of life.

53:22.060 --> 53:29.304
And that molecular vision of life, again, is probably most aptly described in this book called, What is Life?

53:29.404 --> 53:30.084
Mind and Matter.

53:31.485 --> 53:32.286
Erwin Schrodinger.

53:32.866 --> 53:38.409
A book that is downloadable in the Stuff link and is part of the four book collection that we are

53:39.128 --> 53:43.269
going to be using for Biology 101, a new, new Biology 101.

53:43.849 --> 53:57.292
So in this book, they're talking about molecular biology and the thought that all life can be boiled down to molecular mechanisms, chemical mechanisms, physical laws, was the new vision of life.

53:57.392 --> 53:59.072
And I want to read a paragraph in here.

53:59.553 --> 54:05.674
I'm not going to be able to put it into full context because there are a number of names that are referenced that I can't just

54:06.434 --> 54:08.096
explain to you who these people are.

54:08.676 --> 54:26.494
But there's a guy by the name of Morgan who moved from Columbia to Caltech as part of this kind of time when this transition was being forced where they were going to change to a molecular mechanism of thinking about it.

54:26.554 --> 54:28.495
And so I'm just going to read this paragraph right here.

54:29.196 --> 54:39.186
And it is meant to sort of explain what this Morgan's idea was when he came to Caltech and tried to start a new kind of department.

54:39.286 --> 54:50.517
So to promote them a mechanistic conception of life and to probe reproduction, growth and development and related physiological processes on a fundamental level common to all organisms.

54:52.708 --> 54:59.454
The new biology program would depend exclusively on the causal explanations of physics and chemistry.

54:59.594 --> 55:02.557
Exactly that Schrodinger book.

55:03.562 --> 55:14.693
Amplifying and formalizing the dominant trend of modern science, animate nature within the new program increasingly retreated from the field into the confines of the laboratory.

55:14.773 --> 55:22.902
Rather than being viewed as a historical process, life would be fixed within eternal spatial structures and timeless laws of nature.

55:24.025 --> 55:41.892
On introducing the new curriculum in the 1928 Bulletin of the California Institute of Technology, Morgan underscored that it is with desire to lay emphasis on the fundamental principles underlying life processes in animals and plants that an effort will be made to bring together, in a single group,

55:42.592 --> 55:53.736
men whose common interests are the discovery of the unity of the phenomena of living organisms rather than in the investigation of their manifold diversities.

55:57.617 --> 56:08.521
Inasmuch as the curriculum description was a programmatic statement of the new biology, it represented a revolt from the traditional natural history and implicit negation

56:09.546 --> 56:14.849
and it was an implicit negation of the relevance of ecology and evolutionary biology.

56:17.091 --> 56:23.575
And so in a lot of ways, because DNA, you have to just accept evolution and therefore you don't need to investigate it anymore.

56:23.675 --> 56:25.376
You just, it's proven now.

56:26.597 --> 56:36.563
And so the new biology that they're talking about already back in the 30s was a new biology that was intending to replace that

56:38.010 --> 56:50.237
irreducible complexity, that confounding complexity, that, you know, the possibility that we have different layers of emergent properties that we need to understand.

56:50.277 --> 57:01.182
And at the very basis of that, that might be that DNA can encode a protein, but then there are emergent properties on top of it that we can't understand because DNA alone.

57:02.543 --> 57:05.725
And yet this whole paragraph describes exactly that intention.

57:07.443 --> 57:09.904
explanations of physics and chemistry.

57:09.944 --> 57:10.604
That's it.

57:11.024 --> 57:13.104
And so there are no emergent properties then.

57:13.605 --> 57:16.885
Nevermind emergent properties that are biologically emergent.

57:17.606 --> 57:22.707
There could be chemically emergent properties or physically emergent properties that are not obvious how they emerge.

57:23.167 --> 57:35.130
But biologically emergent properties, what I mean by that is combinations of gains that can be only made by, you know, subsequent gains.

57:35.330 --> 57:35.630
And so

57:39.762 --> 57:51.134
It's an interesting, you know, maybe the best way to say it would be like emergent property of the invention of telescopes was eventually the invention of binoculars.

57:51.494 --> 57:54.957
But the binoculars presented other problems that needed to be solved.

57:55.498 --> 58:00.283
And so they are an emergent property of this continuing development of optics.

58:01.954 --> 58:06.223
I know that's a horrible analogy, but this book is awesome.

58:06.363 --> 58:07.786
It's unbelievable.

58:07.926 --> 58:11.714
And the best part about this book is that even Joshua Lederberg says it's good.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.061
Okay, so let's go back.

58:16.262 --> 58:17.143
I'll let this go.

58:19.205 --> 58:25.771
So we have this biologist who's going to explain why it is that it's so dangerous what Robert F. Kennedy is doing.

58:25.811 --> 58:31.516
And of course, this is being seen by a lot of people because this is Katie Couric, you know, a very trustworthy lady.

58:31.596 --> 58:33.598
Sounds like you're just the man to talk to.

58:34.719 --> 58:35.780
Yeah, happy to be here.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.022
Yeah, this is kind of the world I live in.

58:38.541 --> 58:43.989
So first of all, can you tell us what this advisory committee is and what it does?

58:45.151 --> 58:45.552
Sure.

58:45.812 --> 58:54.960
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was created in 1964 in response to the invention of several new vaccines.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.343
Back then it was polio and measles.

58:58.523 --> 59:00.585
Over the years has evolved.

59:00.945 --> 59:11.054
In the early period, the American Academy of Pediatrics mostly made the child and adolescent vaccine schedule in consultation with ACIP.

59:12.396 --> 59:16.660
In the mid-1990s, the decision was made to harmonize the two schedules.

59:16.700 --> 59:26.389
So now, although we produce our own schedule at the American Academy of Pediatrics, it's generally harmonized with the advisory committee on immunization practices.

59:27.089 --> 59:33.532
And so what that committee is, is a group of experts in public health medicine.

59:33.552 --> 59:40.755
So you often have pediatricians on the committee, infectious disease specialists, internal medicine physicians, family physicians.

59:41.356 --> 59:44.557
Often there are nurses on the committee, public health professionals.

59:44.917 --> 59:47.839
There's always a consumer representative on the committee as well.

59:48.679 --> 59:50.680
And these are all experts in their field.

59:50.840 --> 59:57.602
It is a very, it is sort of a career crowning achievement to get on this committee.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:00.882
It's highly competitive to get on it.

01:00:01.063 --> 01:00:01.503
Nice.

01:00:01.603 --> 01:00:04.964
So you see in the chat, I got my buddy having my back there.

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:12.926
Mark says that if we were to really dig in, we would probably find that this was associated with the modernization of the FDA.

01:00:13.926 --> 01:00:16.728
and not in response to some new vaccines.

01:00:16.788 --> 01:00:19.969
And I bet you 100% that Mark is dead on balls accurate.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:24.572
You don't get on this committee without extensive background in vaccines.

01:00:25.692 --> 01:00:28.614
And I should mention it's volunteer.

01:00:28.794 --> 01:00:33.957
So these folks are devoting a lot of time to this committee.

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:39.200
And so what they do is basically deliberate on how should we best use

01:00:40.380 --> 01:01:02.415
um prevention products like vaccines in this country to prevention products i mean that's some rich that is some rich shit right there wow prevention products that's what i call condoms around my kids prevention products to prevent infectious diseases

01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:08.722
And the way they do that is through a very thorough vetting of the science.

01:01:09.382 --> 01:01:16.126
These meetings are streamed publicly, the materials are all publicly available, they're archived.

01:01:16.246 --> 01:01:24.351
You know, if your audience wants to go see the level of detail that they review the science, it's all there right there on the ACIP website.

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:30.595
Yeah, including when they admit that we don't have any data like over and over and over again at every one of these meetings.

01:01:30.635 --> 01:01:32.616
Well, we don't have any data, we're extrapolating.

01:01:33.095 --> 01:01:37.939
So, and it's a very important committee in terms of how we vaccinate the U.S.

01:01:37.979 --> 01:01:38.680
population.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.004
They are the ones who, if a new vaccine comes out, they decide how do we use it.

01:01:44.364 --> 01:01:46.526
They are volunteers on that committee.

01:01:46.566 --> 01:01:48.227
It doesn't mean they don't have day jobs.

01:01:48.267 --> 01:01:49.348
And of course they all do.

01:01:49.428 --> 01:01:50.349
Like it's so dumb.

01:01:51.388 --> 01:01:52.309
in whom do we use it?

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.531
Should we use it in the first place?

01:01:55.392 --> 01:01:58.874
The first consideration of this committee is always safety.

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:17.729
So I've been going to these committee meetings for about a decade now, and I can tell you that every time a new vaccine is being discussed, all of the members of the committee, all they want, they hammer the pharmaceutical companies sometimes who are presenting the data from their clinical trials about the safety issues.

01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:19.771
So they're very highly focused on safety,

01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:24.234
They're very highly focused on how much disease is this going to present?

01:02:24.594 --> 01:02:29.898
Is this a valid use of US resources in terms of the recommendations we're going to make here?

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:38.404
I should say this committee has evolved over the last several decades to be a really well-functioning group.

01:02:39.525 --> 01:02:45.670
What was your reaction, Dr. O'Leary, when you heard the news that all 17 members- The committee has evolved.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:49.683
Unfortunately, these ideas have become endemic.

01:02:52.525 --> 01:02:53.626
It's all a big enchantment.

01:02:54.546 --> 01:02:58.548
Yeah, honestly, I was I was devastated.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.850
This is this is truly a public health crisis.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:07.373
You know, Jessica Hockett, if she found out that Jonathan Engler or those guys were lying, she would be devastated.

01:03:07.473 --> 01:03:09.074
I mean, she would be devastated.

01:03:09.094 --> 01:03:09.955
Oh, my gosh.

01:03:11.756 --> 01:03:13.216
And I don't use those words lightly.

01:03:14.317 --> 01:03:16.058
This was it.

01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:40.926
been rumors about this really going back even to you know shortly after the election that this could happen um but then with the assurance can i just say this out loud it's really gotta piss them off that i'm taking chief woohoo because that is freaking genius i'm sorry but that's freaking genius go ahead sorry i didn't mean to interrupt

01:03:42.055 --> 01:03:47.998
that were given to Senator Cassidy and others during the confirmation hearings that this wouldn't happen.

01:03:48.338 --> 01:03:53.641
I think a lot of us felt like maybe, OK, you know, maybe we'll proceed with some level of normalcy.

01:03:54.201 --> 01:03:56.122
There was an April ACIP meeting.

01:03:56.182 --> 01:03:59.144
It had been it was scheduled for February, but was delayed.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.726
And that meeting went off mostly business as usual.

01:04:03.286 --> 01:04:15.211
And so I think a lot of us in the public health community, we're breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief that maybe things will proceed, you know, with with relative normalcy as to how we recommend vaccines in this country.

01:04:15.911 --> 01:04:17.652
And now all of that is gone.

01:04:19.012 --> 01:04:31.717
What is the the real life impact of these firings and what are you fearful of in terms of who will be a part of this committee now moving forward?

01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:34.709
Yeah, I really don't know.

01:04:34.729 --> 01:04:39.590
You know, the excuse given, you know, that, well, there's a couple of things here.

01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:52.395
One, the announcement that was made led with this concept that he was doing this to restore trust in vaccines, which is really a twisted irony to me that

01:04:55.631 --> 01:05:04.677
the person who has probably done more than any other individual in the US to sow distrust in vaccines over the last 20 years is now saying he's doing this to restore trust.

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:06.638
So that's number one.

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:18.226
Number two, the excuse that was given was to get rid of financial conflicts of interest among the committee members, which is also just frankly false.

01:05:19.487 --> 01:05:23.089
Those committee members are screened extensively for conflicts of interest.

01:05:23.409 --> 01:05:31.935
If there's even a perceived conflict, they have to recuse themselves from any vote related to that potential conflict.

01:05:33.656 --> 01:05:35.177
That actually happens quite rarely.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:41.402
I can also say that a number of the members who were dismissed have never had any financial conflicts of interest.

01:05:41.602 --> 01:05:43.203
To me, that was just an excuse.

01:05:44.084 --> 01:05:47.066
I fear that it's going to be filled with

01:05:47.806 --> 01:05:53.310
individuals who are not supportive of vaccination based on the Secretary's history.

01:05:54.151 --> 01:06:05.879
What is the natural extension of that compilation of people if in fact they don't believe in vaccines or back vaccine skeptics?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.302
What impact will that have overall on public health?

01:06:10.652 --> 01:06:10.852
Sure.

01:06:10.892 --> 01:06:12.293
I mean, here's an analogy for you.

01:06:12.954 --> 01:06:16.176
Imagine if you took all the air traffic controllers in the U.S.

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:22.600
and you replace them not with the people who really didn't have any experience in air traffic control.

01:06:23.821 --> 01:06:26.083
Not only that, but they don't even really believe in flying.

01:06:26.503 --> 01:06:27.964
I mean, that's what we're talking about here.

01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:32.247
And I hate to use the kind of sound hyperbolic.

01:06:32.287 --> 01:06:35.349
And so what will happen if he just puts a bunch of insiders in there?

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:42.557
I mean, he's not gonna put a bunch of people in there and gonna go, I guess we're gonna decide not to recommend any vaccines anymore.

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:43.958
We don't have to be afraid of that.

01:06:44.438 --> 01:06:46.179
That's definitely not gonna happen.

01:06:46.979 --> 01:06:48.600
When is he gonna appoint those people?

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:51.201
What is the vetting process?

01:06:52.332 --> 01:07:07.566
How much hamster wheel time are they gonna waste on this meaningless, absolutely meaningless declaration if you have Marty McCary and Vinay Prasad there fast-tracking every approval anyway?

01:07:09.468 --> 01:07:14.413
What does it matter if the PrEP Act emergency is still in place if they replace the ACIP?

01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:17.903
You know what's going to happen?

01:07:17.923 --> 01:07:28.267
The AICP is going to replace with people who will do justice and I'm predicting it now so that you know that I'm not an idiot and you can see that I'm actually freaking Nostradamus.

01:07:29.387 --> 01:07:33.549
They are going to try and put the COVID shot on

01:07:34.605 --> 01:07:47.335
the VICP, which is where Aaron Seery makes all his money and all these other people make their money because that kangaroo court, administrative court pays for their interim fees.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:56.482
And right now it's pretty hard to sue on behalf of people that have been injured by the COVID vaccine because the CICP

01:07:57.577 --> 01:08:00.481
That's the VICP in the PREP Act.

01:08:01.082 --> 01:08:05.148
The CIP, CICP does not pay interim fees.

01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:12.379
So people like Ray Flores at Children's Health Defense will actually write articles about how it's hard

01:08:13.547 --> 01:08:21.029
to argue on the behalf of these injured people because interim fees are not covered by CICP.

01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:32.072
And so if we had the fees covered by the ICP, then people like Ray Flores could come to the rescue of all these people and fight for justice and get some money.

01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:34.933
That's actually what's gonna happen.

01:08:35.253 --> 01:08:37.514
That's actually what Aaron Seary's arguing for right now.

01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:42.555
That's what everybody promoting Ray Flores on my soapbox doesn't seem to understand.

01:08:43.561 --> 01:08:45.882
that they're not arguing to get rid of the PrEP Act.

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:48.864
Nobody's making a useful challenge to the PrEP Act.

01:08:49.264 --> 01:08:57.868
What they are doing is taking lawsuits on behalf of vaccine-injured people and arguing that the CICP isn't fair.

01:08:59.206 --> 01:09:04.229
that they should be able to go to the VICP because these were put on them by the FDA themselves.

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:06.330
That's what's actually happening here.

01:09:06.691 --> 01:09:16.997
So these disingenuous actors on Substack and elsewhere who claim that they've always been arguing against the PrEP Act, that they've always been focused on the PrEP Act.

01:09:17.017 --> 01:09:18.818
The PrEP Act means it's the DOD.

01:09:18.858 --> 01:09:19.979
They're all full of shit.

01:09:26.345 --> 01:09:29.786
like in terms of, you know, how severe the consequences of this can be.

01:09:29.826 --> 01:09:40.890
But we are talking about human lives here, because as we see vaccination coverage go down, we see outbreaks happen and we see diseases come back that many of us have never even seen before.

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:50.193
And, you know, I've never seen some of the diseases for which we vaccinate because we eliminated them in the US many, many years ago, you know, before even before I trained.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:55.295
And so that's that's what we're talking about here is children suffering and dying.

01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:12.141
What about those who argue, Dr. O'Leary, that some- I could take a real Ayn Rand kind of approach to this, because Ayn Rand made a very big statement about vaccines a while ago, you can still find a video of it, where she said that vaccine mandates are dumb.

01:10:13.262 --> 01:10:18.187
Because if vaccines work, then people who don't take them will suffer the consequences.

01:10:22.398 --> 01:10:31.829
And so again, this isn't going to hurt anybody except for these immunocompromised imaginary people that everybody talks about that we have to vaccinate ourselves because they can't.

01:10:33.991 --> 01:10:35.233
This is all an illusion.

01:10:35.513 --> 01:10:39.397
This guy is simply not sophisticated enough to see through it because he

01:10:41.107 --> 01:10:53.877
He acquiesces to the illusion of consensus that gets created by this herd mentality that people tend to have when they skillfully use social media for their whole life.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:11:07.607
When they try to climb a hierarchy of the university and are successful at it, they tend to be people like that, that haven't had a useful, independent thought in a long, long time.

01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:15.566
have been asking all the people around them what to think for a very long time.

01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:18.890
That's one of the reasons why I didn't fit into a university hierarchy.

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:20.773
I didn't need people to tell me what to think.

01:11:21.594 --> 01:11:24.078
I ran around telling people that they were thinking dumb shit.

01:11:27.321 --> 01:11:32.283
And so this guy is one of those people who has been asking his whole life, what should I think?

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:33.603
And then memorizing it.

01:11:33.683 --> 01:11:35.024
And then now he's reciting it.

01:11:35.064 --> 01:11:38.985
And everybody around him who told him what to think is confirming it.

01:11:39.145 --> 01:11:40.106
That's all this is.

01:11:40.206 --> 01:11:44.787
And social media allows that to be weaponized and personalized.

01:11:47.785 --> 01:12:01.288
rightly or wrongly, the argument goes, that they need more investigation, more study, more attention to some of the unintended consequences that happen with any vaccine.

01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:02.488
Let's be honest, right?

01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:05.948
It does happen at times, even if the numbers are small.

01:12:06.909 --> 01:12:13.950
What would you say to people who are worried or believe that these things need

01:12:19.662 --> 01:12:25.028
As many of you have heard this week, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:29.854
announced he was removing all 17 city now moving forward.

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:39.460
Yeah, so I mean, I will say there had been rumors about this really going back even shortly after the election that this could happen.

01:12:40.401 --> 01:12:49.527
But then with the assurances that were given to Senator Cassidy and others during the confirmation hearings that this wouldn't happen, I think a lot of us felt like maybe.

01:12:49.768 --> 01:12:56.993
And what are you fearful of in terms of who will be a part of this committee now moving forward?

01:12:58.444 --> 01:12:59.965
Yeah, I really don't know.

01:12:59.985 --> 01:13:04.848
You know, the excuse given, you know, that, well, there's a couple things here.

01:13:05.568 --> 01:13:17.675
One, the the announcement that was made led with this concept that he was doing this to restore trust in vaccines, which is really a twisted irony to me that

01:13:20.891 --> 01:13:29.939
the person who has probably done more than any other individual in the US to sow distrust in vaccines over the last 20 years is now saying he's doing this to restore trust.

01:13:30.059 --> 01:13:31.901
So that's number one.

01:13:32.422 --> 01:13:43.532
Number two, the excuse that was given was to get rid of financial conflicts of interest among the committee members, which is also just frankly false.

01:13:44.794 --> 01:13:48.397
Those committee members are screened extensively for conflicts of interest.

01:13:48.718 --> 01:13:57.246
If there's even a perceived conflict, they have to recuse themselves from any vote related to that potential conflict.

01:13:58.087 --> 01:14:00.470
And that actually happens quite rarely.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.991
I can also say that a number of the members who were dismissed have never had any financial conflicts of interest.

01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:08.492
So to me, that was just an excuse.

01:14:09.092 --> 01:14:18.614
So I fear that it's going to be filled with individuals who are not supportive of vaccination based on the Secretary's history.

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:26.256
What is the natural extension of that compilation of people if in fact

01:14:27.008 --> 01:14:31.171
they don't believe in vaccines or back vaccine skeptics.

01:14:31.611 --> 01:14:34.593
What impact will that have overall on public health?

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:37.604
Sure, I mean, here's an analogy for you.

01:14:38.264 --> 01:14:51.396
Imagine if you took all the air traffic controllers in the US and you replace them, not with the people who really didn't have any experience in air traffic control, not only that, but they don't even really believe in flying.

01:14:51.796 --> 01:14:53.257
I mean, that's what we're talking about here.

01:14:54.038 --> 01:15:02.786
And I hate to use the kind of sound hyperbolic in terms of how severe the consequences of this can be, but we are talking about human lives here.

01:15:03.406 --> 01:15:12.068
because as we see vaccination coverage go down, we see outbreaks happen, and we see diseases come back that many of us have never even seen before.

01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:17.809
And, you know, I've never seen some of the diseases for which we vaccinate because we eliminated them in the U.S.

01:15:17.869 --> 01:15:21.369
many, many years ago, you know, even before I trained.

01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:26.390
And so that's what we're talking about here is children suffering and dying.

01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:30.351
That's essentially him admitting that he knows nothing but what he was told.

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:52.945
What about those who argue, Dr. O'Leary, that some of these vaccines, rightly or wrongly, the argument goes, that they need more investigation, more study, more attention to some of the unintended consequences that happen with any vaccine.

01:15:53.165 --> 01:15:54.166
Let's be honest, right?

01:15:54.206 --> 01:15:57.627
It does happen at times, even if the numbers are small.

01:15:57.867 --> 01:16:02.650
What would you say to people who are worried or

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:07.368
believe that these things need more investigation?

01:16:08.249 --> 01:16:08.890
Sure.

01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:16.096
That's a common refrain among anti-vaccine individuals that we need to study it more.

01:16:16.756 --> 01:16:21.661
The fact is that we have an extensive vaccine safety surveillance system here in the US.

01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:28.607
There are many other great surveillance systems around the world that are constantly examining the safety of vaccines in real time.

01:16:29.507 --> 01:16:33.630
And it's sort of this concept that you can't prove a negative, right?

01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:37.312
You can't really, you can always ask for more.

01:16:37.432 --> 01:16:45.977
Well, if you can say that it doesn't happen one in a million times, but you can't say it happens one in 10 million times, then it might happen, right?

01:16:46.698 --> 01:16:58.125
The thing about it is, for me, is that if SIDS, like I suspect, is actually just acute vaccine death after intramuscular injection and acute toxic, you know, whatever,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:16.947
If that's the case, and I think that is, then Steve Kirsch having Pierre Corian to say that they're blowing the lid off of SIDS and that the reason why they know is because the vaccine schedule has been become a lax thing.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:20.709
And as a result, there are less babies dying of SIDS.

01:17:22.335 --> 01:17:29.460
That's something that Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark all knew back in like 2013.

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:49.174
And so the fact of the matter is, is that if there is a rank order of worst case scenarios for intramuscular injection or a bunch of intramuscular injections, the first order of shit is death, very acute death.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:18:06.048
And so even the focus on autism, a word that Brian Hooker wouldn't say in 2013, is really malevolent if you see that it essentially takes all of SIDS and makes it disappear.

01:18:06.868 --> 01:18:14.432
It's not even part of their original big top tent of health freedom, because autism is caused by vaccines.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.404
or at least one component of them, or maybe it's the adjuvants or something like that.

01:18:19.424 --> 01:18:23.968
Do you see how absolutely awful these people are for what they have done?

01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:32.416
When intramuscular injection has a virtually limitless set of possibilities, one of which is acute death.

01:18:33.797 --> 01:18:39.122
And that could have been easily researched with a placebo controlled trial that only lasted 30 days.

01:18:41.081 --> 01:18:52.004
and the argument between Mary Holland and Paul Offit would have ended because who cares about autism if SIDS is kids dying from intramuscular injection?

01:18:54.805 --> 01:18:56.166
These people are all monsters.

01:18:57.706 --> 01:18:59.487
And that's why they had to kill Tony Bark.

01:19:00.247 --> 01:19:01.867
That's why they had to kill Brandy Vaughn.

01:19:01.887 --> 01:19:03.788
That's why they tried to kill me, probably.

01:19:06.049 --> 01:19:07.049
And why do I say that?

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.910
Well, because that thing that I had in my throat

01:19:10.865 --> 01:19:14.607
was a pretty large growth and a lot of blood came out.

01:19:16.348 --> 01:19:19.569
And not one of these people, not one of these people cared.

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:25.573
I didn't get a note from Ryan Cole saying, holy shit, your voice sounds amazing.

01:19:26.593 --> 01:19:30.635
Or Jessica Rose or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:30.695 --> 01:19:35.858
Wow, man, as a guy with a bad voice, it's sure awesome that your voice came back.

01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:43.973
And I coughed out a chunk that I still have on my shelf.

01:19:45.634 --> 01:19:48.877
It's not from pipe burn, all that crack piping.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:57.104
And it happened around the same time that I guess I ran into Rixey a couple of times in the same year.

01:19:58.044 --> 01:19:59.405
I ran into Matt Crawford.

01:20:03.569 --> 01:20:06.731
I spent a lot of time with Mark Kulak.

01:20:06.771 --> 01:20:09.954
I guess he could have been the guy who did it, like when we were in the rental car together.

01:20:11.744 --> 01:20:12.564
Somehow, I doubt it.

01:20:14.725 --> 01:20:19.628
You know, so it's this, they can just keep saying, we need more studies, we need more studies.

01:20:20.088 --> 01:20:24.030
Now, I'm not going to say I wouldn't like more funding for vaccine safety science.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:29.452
I think we could all always get, you know, better funding for that type of work.

01:20:29.732 --> 01:20:35.235
But the fact is, there is a very robust system that are examining exactly those questions as we speak.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:49.236
A very robust system that, you know, our friend Jessica Rose has been bringing us the latest about for six years, just like the EpiGirl character in the Spars pandemic document.

01:20:49.256 --> 01:20:50.936
But that's just a coincidence.

01:20:51.176 --> 01:20:59.719
They also have been studied extensively already and rigorously and tested and analyzed and monitored, et cetera.

01:21:00.059 --> 01:21:04.681
Can you talk about the system that is already in place that would potentially

01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:12.946
potentially convince some vaccine skeptics that they are in fact safe and really important for public health?

01:21:13.907 --> 01:21:14.267
Sure.

01:21:14.288 --> 01:21:14.748
Yeah.

01:21:16.009 --> 01:21:22.755
So there's a there's a general principle that vaccines are held to a much higher safety standard than other medicines that we give.

01:21:23.536 --> 01:21:25.118
So, you know, for example,

01:21:26.569 --> 01:21:26.949
aspirin.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:36.254
We, you know, you get a headache, you take some aspirin, you might get an upset stomach, but you'll put up with the upset stomach because you have a headache.

01:21:36.274 --> 01:21:39.496
And that's better than getting the than you know, getting rid of the headache.

01:21:39.956 --> 01:21:47.440
The relentless citing of aspirin is kind of a useless thing as part of this narrative too, because aspirin is a natural thing.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.221
It works pretty well for a lot of shit.

01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:52.843
And it would be a lot better than ibuprofen or Tylenol.

01:21:57.698 --> 01:21:58.679
is more important to you.

01:21:58.999 --> 01:22:06.206
We will put up with certain side effects and sometimes, you know, for aspirin makes my boob, my belly hurt.

01:22:06.326 --> 01:22:07.347
Holy shit.

01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:09.769
And acetaminophen makes my liver hurt.

01:22:11.871 --> 01:22:12.191
Wow.

01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:13.112
Aspirin is an example.

01:22:13.332 --> 01:22:16.435
There are potentially fatal side effects from, from that medication.

01:22:17.762 --> 01:22:18.282
Yeah.

01:22:18.322 --> 01:22:21.164
Because we're giving them to healthy people to present.

01:22:21.384 --> 01:22:23.225
Even aspirin can kill you.

01:22:23.265 --> 01:22:24.506
To this higher safety standard.

01:22:24.526 --> 01:22:24.966
Holy shit.

01:22:24.986 --> 01:22:32.090
And that's true both in the clinical trials before the vaccine comes to licensure and then afterwards as well.

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.451
Got a crash coming here.

01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:34.671
There we go.

01:22:35.552 --> 01:22:35.892
Dang it.

01:22:36.857 --> 01:22:40.858
I'm just going to resume in this scape and start it over and I'll find that spot.

01:22:40.918 --> 01:22:41.699
I apologize.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:45.480
Sometimes this thing gets tired when I start and stop.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.902
As many of you have heard this week, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:50.982 --> 01:22:54.783
announced he was removing the safety of vaccines in real time.

01:22:55.663 --> 01:23:00.925
And it's sort of this concept that you can't prove a negative from that medication.

01:23:02.156 --> 01:23:03.237
Vaccines are different.

01:23:03.457 --> 01:23:09.083
Because we're giving them to healthy people to prevent disease, they are held to this higher safety standard.

01:23:09.424 --> 01:23:16.311
And that's true both in the clinical trials before a vaccine comes to licensure and then afterwards as well.

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:32.396
In the preclinical trials, you may remember the COVID vaccine trials among 30,000 to 45,000 individuals for the two vaccines that eventually got licensed and most used in the US, were very large clinical trials.

01:23:33.097 --> 01:23:45.365
You can detect in those types of trials, things that happen on the order of one in 1,000 individuals, maybe a little bit less than that, things like a sore arm, headache, those types of things.

01:23:45.945 --> 01:23:51.150
But but people died in that trial and a lot more people that took the shot died.

01:23:53.532 --> 01:23:56.254
And none of them were that doesn't that's not a signal, you see.

01:23:57.795 --> 01:24:01.458
It's this guy is just tell me what to say and I'll say it.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:03.520
Give me a script, Papa.

01:24:05.502 --> 01:24:12.108
It's just not feasible to do a clinical trial large enough to detect these rare potential adverse events.

01:24:13.115 --> 01:24:17.858
And so we have these extensive safety surveillance systems in place to do just that.

01:24:18.519 --> 01:24:30.247
And I would say that the- But if the whole world is composed of men who don't believe that men cheat on their wives, then what difference will it make if women report that their husbands are cheating?

01:24:34.210 --> 01:24:42.095
If your school is full of teachers who don't believe that the students will cheat, then what would stop the students from cheating?

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:59.304
And if you have a whole medical field that isn't sophisticated enough to understand the biology that is incongruent with intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to augment a healthy human, that's got to be by design.

01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:10.992
The selection process, the training process has resulted in a system full of people who have been asking for what to say.

01:25:11.413 --> 01:25:12.794
Tell me what to think.

01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:18.186
That's the basic way you get through medical school.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:19.526
You get through your residency.

01:25:19.606 --> 01:25:20.867
Tell me what to think.

01:25:24.089 --> 01:25:31.873
And so, because this person has been very successful at a career of telling me what to think, that's why he's here.

01:25:33.581 --> 01:25:35.082
Tell me what to think, daddy.

01:25:35.302 --> 01:25:40.886
COVID, through the COVID pandemic, was a good example of that system working as it should, right?

01:25:40.946 --> 01:25:57.916
So we had, within a matter of days of the vaccines being rolled out, we were able to tell that there was a very rare risk of Banifalaxis, so a severe allergic reaction, roughly, you know, two to five per million individuals.

01:25:58.356 --> 01:26:00.598
We were able to identify that within a matter of days.

01:26:01.578 --> 01:26:07.801
Some of these other quite rare side effects were able to be identified within a matter of days to weeks as well.

01:26:08.281 --> 01:26:16.665
And then the ACIP, among others, weighed the risks and benefits, looked at, okay, we know this remote risk exists.

01:26:16.985 --> 01:26:20.467
Should we continue to recommend the vaccine or should we not?

01:26:21.167 --> 01:26:24.709
And in most of the cases with these very rare remote risks,

01:26:25.209 --> 01:26:34.985
it was clear that COVID was much more severe than these remote risks and so the decision was made in some cases to continue vaccinating that population.

01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:37.598
That is remarkable.

01:26:37.839 --> 01:26:39.941
And that is a complete stop.

01:26:40.241 --> 01:26:41.482
It's complete bullshit.

01:26:42.243 --> 01:26:43.184
It's remarkable.

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:45.146
But that's where we are.

01:26:45.206 --> 01:26:45.407
Right.

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:47.329
That's in other cases.

01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:53.695
The concern over safety was high enough that we said, no, we're no longer going to use that vaccine.

01:26:53.835 --> 01:26:58.020
And that was true of, for example, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which was removed from the market.

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.542
because of a safety concern on the order of, you know, one.

01:27:01.562 --> 01:27:05.964
So people not paying attention are hearing this and they're believing it.

01:27:06.004 --> 01:27:09.086
It makes perfect sense with everything that they paid attention to.

01:27:11.007 --> 01:27:22.474
And there's a very small minority of people that have been paying attention to Ryan Cole and Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough and Ryan and Ryan Cole and and Mary Holland and Brian.

01:27:22.574 --> 01:27:26.376
A very small number of people know who those shitheads are.

01:27:29.608 --> 01:27:33.753
And the vast majority of people who know who those shitheads are, are victims.

01:27:36.236 --> 01:27:38.219
Victims of their operation.

01:27:38.859 --> 01:27:40.581
Victims of their sabotage.

01:27:42.784 --> 01:27:49.152
Aimed at thinking Americans, critically thinking independent Americans on the left and the right.

01:27:51.328 --> 01:27:55.651
to get them behind a Trojan horse named Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:56.131 --> 01:28:09.539
so that people like Marty Makary, Jayantabadacharya, and Vinay Prasad could be put in place as mouthpieces for people like Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone, and the other people that are puppeting this thing.

01:28:10.759 --> 01:28:13.441
We are in grave danger in America right now.

01:28:14.202 --> 01:28:16.243
And these people can't be expected to know it.

01:28:16.623 --> 01:28:17.844
This guy will never

01:28:18.601 --> 01:28:20.782
know it in tens of thousands of individuals.

01:28:21.222 --> 01:28:28.125
So I would say that's an example of the monitoring that's going on and the decisions that are being made and why they're being made.

01:28:29.146 --> 01:28:34.988
I know that there has, as you mentioned, already already a decline in routine childhood vaccinations.

01:28:35.928 --> 01:28:41.811
I have to think that a move like this will only sow more distrust

01:28:42.563 --> 01:28:49.125
and vaccines just simply by this, you know, this effort to fire these people.

01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:50.825
Is his name Vinny Ayok?

01:28:50.965 --> 01:28:51.946
Oh, that's even better.

01:28:52.106 --> 01:28:53.646
Jayanta and Vinny Ayok.

01:28:53.806 --> 01:28:55.387
And replace them with new ones.

01:28:55.847 --> 01:29:02.989
How fearful are you that this will cause an even more precipitous decline in compliance rates?

01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:06.690
Yeah, I'm very concerned about that, for sure.

01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:11.551
I think, I can't see how this maneuver is going to increase trust in the process.

01:29:14.277 --> 01:29:20.363
I will say the vast majority of parents vaccinate their kids on the routinely recommended schedule.

01:29:20.543 --> 01:29:32.815
Just keep in mind, they rolled out adenovirus-based coronavirus vaccines with the intention, with the scripted intention of having them hurt people and then calling attention to the fact that

01:29:33.556 --> 01:29:40.940
AICP and the FDA are fully aware and that they're keeping track and they're willing to pull a product off the market.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:48.164
That was part of Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone, and this national security script, without a fricking doubt.

01:29:49.724 --> 01:29:57.030
And so the fact that this guy cites it means that he is layers and layers of blankets of bullshit under.

01:29:57.050 --> 01:30:10.062
He, there's no chance of this guy escaping the cognitive trap that he's in because the only alternative, like the only strategy he has to escape is to ask people what to think.

01:30:12.267 --> 01:30:21.615
Tell me what to think is his strategy for how to escape whatever or to how to succeed so he can't even see the trap he's in because that is the trap.

01:30:22.376 --> 01:30:24.658
Tell me what to think instead of learn it on your own.

01:30:25.138 --> 01:30:27.501
And I think many parents will continue to do that.

01:30:29.082 --> 01:30:36.786
The problem is that when we see even small dips in vaccination coverage, that's where we see these diseases come back.

01:30:37.167 --> 01:30:39.108
And we're already seeing that, for example, with measles.

01:30:39.648 --> 01:30:48.814
We had greater than 95% up-to-date coverage for children in school going into the pandemic in 2019, 2020.

01:30:49.214 --> 01:30:51.676
That has dipped a couple of percentage points at this point.

01:30:52.316 --> 01:30:54.157
And you see what's happening with measles right now.

01:30:54.217 --> 01:30:55.398
We've got the largest outbreak

01:30:56.285 --> 01:31:04.149
We're probably going to surpass 2019, and this will put us into the largest outbreak since the early 90s in terms of the number of measles cases.

01:31:04.489 --> 01:31:06.450
We've already seen three deaths from measles.

01:31:06.490 --> 01:31:13.414
We hadn't seen a single death in a decade, and we hadn't seen a death in a child in 20 years, and we've already seen that this season.

01:31:14.014 --> 01:31:23.659
Further erosion in MMR coverage, measles coverage, and then other vaccines can only mean that we're going to see more and more of this.

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:25.139
over the coming months.

01:31:25.199 --> 01:31:49.249
And of course a focus on MMR keeps Mary Holland's story, it keeps Brian Hooker's story, it keeps Pauly Tommy's bullshit story, and it keeps Andrew Wakefield's bullshit story at the center because it's one component of the MMR, or it's the multiple antigens in one shot, or it's the adjuvants, the aluminum, or the mercury, or both of them, and it's all fucking lies.

01:31:49.349 --> 01:31:51.350
Excuse me, but it's all lies.

01:31:53.643 --> 01:31:54.363
It's all lies.

01:31:54.744 --> 01:31:55.944
In years, unfortunately.

01:31:56.225 --> 01:31:59.527
Because you won't reach herd immunity, right?

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:00.387
Correct.

01:32:00.447 --> 01:32:00.888
Yeah.

01:32:00.988 --> 01:32:05.671
I tend to use the term community protection or community immunity, but yeah.

01:32:05.851 --> 01:32:07.952
Community, community, community.

01:32:07.972 --> 01:32:11.234
You know, like the gay community, because all gay people think the same.

01:32:11.254 --> 01:32:12.455
They're all on one team.

01:32:14.396 --> 01:32:16.618
It's like the black community is all on one team.

01:32:16.638 --> 01:32:18.419
The white community is all on one team.

01:32:18.439 --> 01:32:19.740
The Hispanic community.

01:32:22.756 --> 01:32:28.539
because we try to maintain a level within the community that prevents outbreaks from spreading.

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:34.103
So the vaccines protect both the individual, but they also protect those around them as well.

01:32:34.363 --> 01:32:35.043
I need a break.

01:32:36.004 --> 01:32:37.025
I'm sorry, I need a break.

01:32:37.065 --> 01:32:43.068
And then I'll be right back with a little bit of a little more torture, and then we'll be done for the day.

01:32:43.589 --> 01:32:44.369
Thanks for being here.

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:47.031
And I'll see you in a minute.

01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:20.202
There's nothing true, there's nothing that's a lot.

01:34:21.503 --> 01:34:24.044
Where's the sign if I'm being true?

01:34:25.144 --> 01:34:27.786
I'm so bothered with things that don't feel right.

01:34:28.946 --> 01:34:31.407
Yet his hand never sees me through.

01:34:32.768 --> 01:34:34.909
When a ship alone won't wash away.

01:34:34.949 --> 01:34:39.111
Bright or shine, it's always going to stay.

01:34:40.392 --> 01:34:42.853
All these years we will not spend together.

01:34:44.426 --> 01:34:47.387
I guess we just couldn't stand the weather.

01:34:47.567 --> 01:35:09.910
Like a train that stops at every station, we're out to a thousand tribulations.

01:35:11.051 --> 01:35:13.391
There ain't a fellow that's had every year.

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:17.576
And tickle and yell and cry is all he's got.

01:35:18.596 --> 01:35:20.997
Change has come before we get young.

01:35:22.498 --> 01:35:25.259
Climate's changing before we're too old.

01:35:26.419 --> 01:35:28.840
Don't just change before trying to be better.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.942
Understand it's time to get ready for the storm.

01:37:28.485 --> 01:37:31.647
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:37:32.148 --> 01:37:33.929
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:37:35.931 --> 01:37:36.712
Isolation, what was it?

01:37:36.832 --> 01:37:38.093
Isolation and purification.

01:37:39.795 --> 01:37:40.535
Of the virus?

01:37:40.615 --> 01:37:40.836
Yes.

01:37:42.077 --> 01:37:43.838
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:37:50.613 --> 01:37:53.094
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:37:53.754 --> 01:37:58.636
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:37:59.417 --> 01:38:00.917
I don't understand what the issue.

01:38:00.937 --> 01:38:01.037
I see.

01:38:01.077 --> 01:38:02.338
No, it depends on how they use it.

01:38:16.067 --> 01:38:18.030
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:20.374
I mean, he actually isolated it, so.

01:38:20.434 --> 01:38:24.140
I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.243
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

01:38:31.004 --> 01:38:33.766
Hey, welcome to the second half of the show.

01:38:33.947 --> 01:38:39.371
On the back half of the show, this is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief brought to you by Biologist.

01:38:39.412 --> 01:38:40.232
Hello, welcome to the show.

01:38:40.272 --> 01:38:41.073
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

01:38:41.954 --> 01:38:43.375
I'm still very happy to be here.

01:38:43.395 --> 01:38:50.541
I've had a plan for a long time to do a news program as a Vulcan, and I was going to use this as the backdrop.

01:38:52.463 --> 01:38:53.945
I don't know, I might still do that.

01:38:54.886 --> 01:38:57.409
We'll see what what it takes to get this message out.

01:38:57.449 --> 01:39:01.494
We'll do whatever we can and do whatever I can afford to do with the amount of time that I have.

01:39:02.656 --> 01:39:06.881
If you like what you see, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support the stream.

01:39:07.842 --> 01:39:11.146
You can also send something to Jonathan Cooey at

01:39:11.606 --> 01:39:11.866
P.O.

01:39:11.886 --> 01:39:15.068
Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania 15102.

01:39:15.688 --> 01:39:20.931
A guy by the name of Brian often sends stuff.

01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:27.954
Brian, I just got a book from you in the mail and also a very nice card.

01:39:28.194 --> 01:39:30.736
He always takes the time to write something nice.

01:39:32.016 --> 01:39:33.137
I'm just gonna show it like that.

01:39:34.517 --> 01:39:42.181
And he also sends a little bit of green in the mail as a monthly donation in a little envelope like this all the time.

01:39:42.882 --> 01:39:47.724
And so if you want to know how the magic is done, how the donuts are made, that's really it.

01:39:49.225 --> 01:39:59.970
I've got a lot of technical expertise and self-appliance skills that I gained through 20 years of being a microscope jockey in academia and a

01:40:00.899 --> 01:40:03.921
a kite flyer and a photographer.

01:40:05.482 --> 01:40:17.610
And that translates pretty well to setting up a stream, especially if your brother pays you to learn how to do it at the beginning of the pandemic so that he can make $100,000 streaming cooking shows in Texas.

01:40:21.914 --> 01:40:29.576
And then of course he would fire you because you didn't want to move to Texas and bring your children down there and risk the possibility that, oops, that's right.

01:40:29.936 --> 01:40:31.157
You're not doing it anymore.

01:40:31.797 --> 01:40:33.858
And so what do we, how do we make a living anymore?

01:40:33.918 --> 01:40:51.663
But you know, my brother basically disowned me because I made him $120,000 at the beginning of 2021 by helping him to live stream shows by leaving my wife at home alone with the kids for a couple of weeks at a time so that I could be there with him eating tacos and having a good time.

01:40:52.304 --> 01:41:00.371
And then as thanks for it, he basically stopped talking to me and asked for my computer back that he had supposedly paid me with.

01:41:01.692 --> 01:41:07.638
People behave very, very strange when they're confronted with a truth that's inconvenient.

01:41:08.559 --> 01:41:18.748
People behave very strange when they think that they are smarter than you and that they can win you over with arguing and they can't, but they lose in their own mind.

01:41:20.592 --> 01:41:22.413
That's what happens to amoral people.

01:41:23.053 --> 01:41:25.234
That's what happens to people with no principles.

01:41:25.274 --> 01:41:29.255
And that's what happens to people who are on a script that they don't understand.

01:41:33.177 --> 01:41:37.739
I'm one of the last remaining very dangerous people on earth, unfortunately.

01:41:39.679 --> 01:41:48.183
And I've got a lot of evidence on my phone and on a couple hard drives over there that I think are some of the most dangerous circumstantial evidence that there is.

01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:51.612
that this is an orchestrated failure.

01:41:52.593 --> 01:42:04.021
The health freedom movement and the anti-vax movement that is headed by Mary Holland and Children's Health Defense and Del Bigtree and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:07.224
and Meryl Nass has been a purposeful failure.

01:42:07.264 --> 01:42:12.148
That's why their rhetoric, their messaging, and their understanding

01:42:13.018 --> 01:42:14.219
has never progressed.

01:42:14.299 --> 01:42:16.660
That's why they've never put forward a teacher.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.502
That's why they've never put forward a health, uh, a high school biology course.

01:42:21.922 --> 01:42:28.064
That's why these people have not made any progress in the last 20 years.

01:42:29.045 --> 01:42:36.288
And certainly haven't made any progress since they declared war on Paul Offit and Paul Offit declared war on Andrew Wakefield.

01:42:37.708 --> 01:42:42.791
that makes them traitors to our grandchildren and makes them liars and grifters.

01:42:45.253 --> 01:42:52.798
And so it's not a very friendly message that I have to explain to you that these people are on a provided script.

01:42:53.098 --> 01:42:54.999
Of government in general.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:06.467
And in my mind, the, well, you know, how do we,

01:43:08.144 --> 01:43:28.073
use this situation to our advantage, to make sure that people are getting... I think there's a genuine call for justice to be called for, especially if there was a moratorium in place.

01:43:28.253 --> 01:43:31.434
And so he's being scripted by text that he's reading right now.

01:43:31.454 --> 01:43:33.275
It could even be that it's a live chat.

01:43:35.683 --> 01:43:39.565
And at the end of this little clip, he's going to have to wait for the chat to catch up.

01:43:39.585 --> 01:43:44.488
He's going to have to wait for the guy on the other end that's typing to tell him what to say next.

01:43:45.128 --> 01:43:49.791
And unknown, unbeknownst to Addy adds, Addy's going to say, yeah, keep going, man.

01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:50.571
Don't stop.

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:54.333
But he's got to stop because he's got to wait for the text to come.

01:43:55.434 --> 01:44:02.298
That caused Fauci's department to have the research offshored.

01:44:02.867 --> 01:44:08.913
OK, so I mean, I have to I have to presume that somewhere because we don't know what those papers look like.

01:44:11.956 --> 01:44:17.382
Prior to that, and this was the Obama administration that did this, and there's a lot there's a strong argument for.

01:44:19.318 --> 01:44:20.259
Oh, I've got it.

01:44:20.899 --> 01:44:21.260
I wait.

01:44:23.121 --> 01:44:23.481
Keep going.

01:44:23.702 --> 01:44:25.663
I caught up, he said.

01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:26.784
Did you hear him say it?

01:44:27.205 --> 01:44:28.065
I caught up.

01:44:29.086 --> 01:44:29.827
And then he left.

01:44:29.987 --> 01:44:31.388
And then Addy says, keep going.

01:44:32.769 --> 01:44:34.751
So I have to presume that somewhere.

01:44:36.417 --> 01:44:42.279
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught Wiv how to create the coronavirus.

01:44:42.379 --> 01:44:51.022
Four years later, we have Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project on a huge podcast saying exactly the same shit that Kevin McKernan said in 2020 and tried to rope me into saying in 2020.

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:59.563
tried to attach himself to me by putting my links on his website.

01:45:00.143 --> 01:45:09.185
And now these two jackasses are on Steve Kirsch's podcast saying that it's the spike protein and DNA contamination.

01:45:09.205 --> 01:45:20.727
Through that process, they taught Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-see-um technique, which is a technique of assembling viral genomes so you don't leave any evidence behind.

01:45:21.828 --> 01:45:25.911
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

01:45:27.132 --> 01:45:31.795
It's a clever way of putting stuff together so that you can't tell that someone built it, necessarily, from a laboratory.

01:45:32.636 --> 01:45:39.541
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that got them caught, basically.

01:45:40.382 --> 01:45:42.824
If you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

01:45:42.924 --> 01:45:43.905
Charles Rixey has helped

01:45:44.985 --> 01:45:51.348
That is an admission that Kevin McKernan is a traitor to the grandchildren of Earth because Charles Rixey is a fraud.

01:45:53.269 --> 01:45:55.149
Just like Kevin McCairn is a fraud.

01:45:56.290 --> 01:46:06.674
And so the fact that this dipshit was put in front of the Senate by Senator Ron Johnson, who called me in April of 2022 to say that he needed my help, is also a traitor.

01:46:08.257 --> 01:46:27.200
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, he's a senator from my home state, and Senator Ron Johnson can only be a willing participant in this national security theater that is scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, and Kevin McKernan admitted it by pushing Ralph Baric, Charles Rixey,

01:46:28.493 --> 01:46:51.785
the fear and cleavage site, the HIV inserts, the staphylococcus enterotoxin B homologies, and Charles frickin' Rixey, who came to my house when I had a great voice, and for the next year and a half afterward, I had a growth in my throat, that had I gone to the doctor, I'd be willing to bet somebody might have said I had esophageal cancer.

01:46:54.252 --> 01:46:58.876
Certainly wouldn't have told me it was a benign growth and I could just wait until I coughed it out a year and a half later.

01:47:03.379 --> 01:47:04.841
Charles Rixey came to my house.

01:47:05.581 --> 01:47:07.243
Piper Stover came to my house.

01:47:12.347 --> 01:47:13.868
Addie Adds came to Pittsburgh.

01:47:13.968 --> 01:47:15.749
Kevin McCarran came to Pittsburgh.

01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:17.411
I didn't let them come to my house.

01:47:20.029 --> 01:47:32.914
Paul Alexander came to my house at the end of last year with his wife and daughter and they were terrified of my dogs and they lied about wanting to help me to start a non-profit or some shit.

01:47:40.301 --> 01:47:47.704
RFK write his book about this and Charles George Webb came to approximately an hour from my house where I met him in person.

01:47:47.764 --> 01:47:48.585
We're gonna keep talking.

01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:49.205
Thank you Alex.

01:47:49.225 --> 01:48:00.150
We got Alex here helping out with the camera today So we're back with FDA direct FDA direct and Bigfoot is still here for those of you It's hard to imagine but they actually put out another podcast.

01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:08.333
This is podcast number eight and it's not just a podcast But it's also another article in the British Medical Journal stop lying

01:48:09.045 --> 01:48:16.731
And so these guys are so proud of their hard work that they decided to do a podcast about another article that they wrote about the vision for the FDA.

01:48:16.751 --> 01:48:24.076
You know, that organization that's being completely sabotaged from within because what Trojan horse led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:48:24.136 --> 01:48:32.822
allowed these traders to get to the head of these agencies, crucial places in the U S government controlled by people with other passports.

01:48:34.503 --> 01:48:36.845
And the mainstream media is just worried about Donald Trump.

01:48:38.905 --> 01:48:39.785
Who might be concerned?

01:48:39.885 --> 01:48:40.766
Bigfoot is here.

01:48:40.826 --> 01:48:41.326
Good to see you.

01:48:41.626 --> 01:48:42.927
Thanks for your help setting up today.

01:48:43.447 --> 01:48:51.791
So we were just talking about this piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association that we have out, titled Priorities for a New FDA.

01:48:51.811 --> 01:48:53.571
I have it right here, hot off the press.

01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:54.632
Congratulations, you two.

01:48:54.932 --> 01:48:55.152
Thanks.

01:48:55.352 --> 01:48:57.694
So I thought I was telling Angela, maybe we could chat a little bit about it.

01:48:57.854 --> 01:48:58.274
Let's do it.

01:48:58.314 --> 01:49:04.099
You know, you're a different FDA commissioner in some senses, because you have a very aggressive agenda.

01:49:04.419 --> 01:49:07.221
You are firing on all cylinders in all fronts.

01:49:07.281 --> 01:49:15.287
He has a very aggressive agenda that was given to him by Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone and all the people that work with them and pay for them.

01:49:15.487 --> 01:49:17.308
That's the reality of this.

01:49:17.368 --> 01:49:20.670
These people are traitors on a script provided to them.

01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:25.273
You're not just popping into the office and then popping out to play golf, Marty.

01:49:25.333 --> 01:49:26.233
That's not how you're rolling.

01:49:26.634 --> 01:49:45.023
Look, I think there's just a lot of great ideas that come from people at the FDA, and we've been going around asking scientists and reviewers and core staff, what big ideas do you think are important to consider that you've not really been able to do that we should consider?

01:49:45.383 --> 01:49:50.466
So just remember that a week after I met George Webb, another woman that I met there by the name of

01:49:50.946 --> 01:49:51.768
Karmadoc.

01:49:52.228 --> 01:49:56.794
And Karmadoc's a really interesting chick because when she met me...

01:49:58.277 --> 01:49:59.218
Listen to this story.

01:49:59.878 --> 01:50:01.599
One of the biggest followers of Mark.

01:50:01.619 --> 01:50:03.140
She used to be in our chat all the time.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:11.264
Karmadoc met me in person when I drove to the Wimber Institute to meet Mark Kulak and George Webb there.

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:19.588
And George Webb introduced me to a bunch of people at a little burger place as the magnificent and wonderful Jonathan Cooey or something like that.

01:50:19.648 --> 01:50:22.590
And everybody gave me a little, okay.

01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:25.231
He would not sit with me.

01:50:25.851 --> 01:50:27.132
He would not be around me.

01:50:28.746 --> 01:50:31.208
Giant George Webb shook my hand and walked away.

01:50:33.389 --> 01:50:34.710
I met Karmadoc there.

01:50:35.751 --> 01:50:39.734
Now the interesting thing about my meeting with Karmadoc was that Ruby was there.

01:50:40.755 --> 01:50:43.497
Because I brought Ruby because I was home alone at the time.

01:50:45.718 --> 01:50:57.647
And so it started raining and I was sitting in the back of my Chevy with the gate up, the big gate up, the back door up, and sitting under that with Ruby watching it rain.

01:50:58.786 --> 01:50:59.847
Wasn't raining very hard.

01:51:00.788 --> 01:51:03.270
And Karma Doc came over to the car to talk to me.

01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:07.753
And the funny thing is, is that Ruby likes everybody.

01:51:08.414 --> 01:51:10.796
And so she's wagging her tail and all excited.

01:51:11.276 --> 01:51:14.499
And Karma Doc did not see the dog.

01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:24.467
Didn't see the dog, just started talking to me.

01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:30.192
I don't even know if she touched Ruby.

01:51:34.313 --> 01:51:45.878
And a week after that, Karmadoc says that her fiancé was killed, committed suicide at her house, and sent the frickin' picture to Mark.

01:51:47.859 --> 01:51:49.940
And Mark still has that picture on his phone.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:57.783
And this is the chick that was in the audience and asked a question to Robert Malone

01:51:58.559 --> 01:52:08.943
and Ryan Cole and Li Min Yan in 2021 at a church in America about self-amplifying RNA vaccines.

01:52:09.483 --> 01:52:10.244
Stop lying.

01:52:11.364 --> 01:52:12.704
Stop lying.

01:52:12.985 --> 01:52:14.505
No, that's, that's sorry.

01:52:14.545 --> 01:52:19.707
That was two and a half years too early and you are getting ahead on the script.

01:52:20.647 --> 01:52:21.728
Sorry, Karmadoc.

01:52:24.577 --> 01:52:30.698
Mark and I have had infiltrators in our chat since before we knew what an infiltrator was.

01:52:32.379 --> 01:52:35.900
We've had people helping us before we knew that there are no people that help.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:42.201
We've had people sharing our work before we understood that nobody does that.

01:52:45.002 --> 01:52:49.763
And we had people trying to kill us, I think, before we understood that that's how it works.

01:52:53.502 --> 01:52:57.005
I don't know man, I don't know what to tell you other than America is in trouble.

01:53:00.447 --> 01:53:09.774
And there aren't very many Americans who seem to be able to see it, but the ones who do will get nowhere on social media unless you physically share the stream.

01:53:09.794 --> 01:53:16.159
You gotta download it, or you gotta grab that link and you gotta email it to individual people.

01:53:16.659 --> 01:53:16.940
Hi.

01:53:17.918 --> 01:53:20.140
Hi, so-and-so, this is me.

01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:22.021
I haven't talked to you in a while.

01:53:22.442 --> 01:53:24.083
I really need you to watch this guy.

01:53:24.143 --> 01:53:26.865
When you have a chance, take a look at this video.

01:53:29.287 --> 01:53:30.668
America's in big trouble.

01:53:32.289 --> 01:53:34.331
And the truth is not available on TV.

01:53:35.432 --> 01:53:36.633
And then copy that.

01:53:37.469 --> 01:53:40.370
put it in a new email and send it to one other person.

01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:43.790
Then copy that, put it in another email and send it to another person.

01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:47.151
Every email has to be a single recipient.

01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:51.752
Every email has to almost appear as though you're really just doing it for them.

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:54.552
And do that like 10 minutes a day.

01:53:54.992 --> 01:54:03.574
And chances are very good this stream will grow fast enough so that I can stream for four or five or six hours a day or do two streams a day if I have to.

01:54:05.169 --> 01:54:10.573
One on biology and journal club and whatever, and one that just hammers on these people every day.

01:54:11.514 --> 01:54:13.155
Until America realizes it.

01:54:13.215 --> 01:54:23.543
Until America sees through the illusion on PBS NewsHour, sees through the illusion on CNN, sees through the illusion on MSNBC, and sees through the illusion on Tucker frickin' Carlson!

01:54:25.583 --> 01:54:27.463
And so we've been getting great ideas.

01:54:27.963 --> 01:54:38.626
And we're doing the same with the industry, asking the sponsors, the developers, and scientists who invent some of these drugs and products, what big ideas do you have for regulation?

01:54:38.986 --> 01:54:39.946
And we're learning a lot.

01:54:39.986 --> 01:54:41.906
So this is amazing right now.

01:54:41.966 --> 01:54:44.587
There's no shortage of giant ideas.

01:54:45.167 --> 01:54:47.247
So we've been doing this inventory for a while.

01:54:47.287 --> 01:54:48.988
We're gonna keep going and keep listening.

01:54:49.548 --> 01:54:50.768
But there are some general,

01:54:51.368 --> 01:54:55.831
parameters that I would say define our priorities at the new FDA.

01:54:56.132 --> 01:55:03.617
And I would just add, I think one of the ways that you're soliciting these new ideas is by challenging everyone to challenge these long-held assumptions, right?

01:55:03.697 --> 01:55:05.559
And ask these tough questions, right?

01:55:05.579 --> 01:55:11.063
And so in this paper, you start off by saying, why does it take more than 10 years for a new drug to come to market, right?

01:55:11.083 --> 01:55:14.686
Which sounds like a simple question, but it's a really important one.

01:55:14.766 --> 01:55:17.468
And so what are you thinking about with some of these new ideas?

01:55:17.588 --> 01:55:22.870
Is there anyone else who's very annoyed with her specific breaking up of the word important?

01:55:25.819 --> 01:55:29.720
I'm sorry, I'm just losing my shit because I don't like these foreign posers.

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.580
There is, by the way, a science to soliciting ideas.

01:55:34.301 --> 01:55:39.862
If you get people in a room with their bosses and you say, you know, how are things going?

01:55:39.942 --> 01:55:40.862
What ideas do you have?

01:55:40.902 --> 01:55:42.082
They're like, things are great.

01:55:42.982 --> 01:55:43.142
Yeah.

01:55:43.502 --> 01:55:52.984
But if you get them alone and you give them anonymity and you keep it confidential with them and that you just let them open up

01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:59.868
You start hearing amazing idea after idea after idea and you think that makes so much sense.

01:56:00.148 --> 01:56:01.750
Now some of those ideas are not good ideas.

01:56:02.271 --> 01:56:11.422
But when you hear them again and again from different people you're really doing an inventory collection of ideas that is so much different from say a town hall or right.

01:56:12.203 --> 01:56:13.923
Something where their boss is in the room.

01:56:13.983 --> 01:56:31.247
No, I'm not disparaging their bosses We are great people here leading of the FDA But you get these great ideas from the front lines from people on the ground doing this hard work of product review every day Well, you're having a dialogue and a lot of people have told us that they haven't been asked I'm gonna keep going for a minute.

01:56:31.267 --> 01:56:35.507
I just wanted to take a break because I just can't believe it I just want to show you something over here.

01:56:35.547 --> 01:56:38.908
Let me see if I can get this out of the way Does that go like that?

01:56:38.968 --> 01:56:39.128
Yeah

01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:47.237
So back here in my room it looks like it's gotten pretty bad here.

01:56:47.297 --> 01:56:53.243
But essentially what I am blessed with in this life is a second bedroom of my own.

01:56:53.263 --> 01:56:59.709
I have a little man cave in the back of my garage because the guy who lived here before me was like a wood shop dude.

01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:06.897
And this was a wood shop and it has a windows that have screens, you know, so you can put the blow thing out of the window.

01:57:07.558 --> 01:57:09.179
And it's got a lot of power.

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:11.162
It's got its own power box.

01:57:11.322 --> 01:57:12.703
And so that's kind of handy too.

01:57:13.804 --> 01:57:19.450
And so when we saw this house, it was one bedroom short and a shitty basement short.

01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:45.318
But it had this one thing and so you know my family made the decision and I was the large beneficiary of it I've got I got my piano in here I've got a drum set back there behind the green thing and the best thing is I finally have an antenna in my backyard which means My radio has ears now, which is kick-ass and what's even more kick-ass is that my radio is

01:57:47.079 --> 01:57:51.553
I mean, it had ears at the last house, but it never had ears at this house.

01:57:52.512 --> 01:57:56.235
Because um setting up a ham radio antenna is not trivial.

01:57:56.275 --> 01:57:58.616
You need the friends, you need friends with your neighbors.

01:57:58.956 --> 01:58:02.579
And the neighbor that I needed to be friends with wasn't actually here.

01:58:02.639 --> 01:58:03.660
The house was abandoned.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.001
But the guy's there now and they're remodeling it.

01:58:06.021 --> 01:58:09.483
And they're all excited because they heard that we pay so much in rent.

01:58:09.523 --> 01:58:11.705
And so it's like wow we can make that much money great.

01:58:12.285 --> 01:58:15.668
So that guy's remodeling his house and getting ready to rent it to somebody.

01:58:15.728 --> 01:58:17.008
And that guy's now my friend.

01:58:17.048 --> 01:58:20.611
And so I can use the tree in his backyard to string the long half of my

01:58:21.408 --> 01:58:24.770
of my wire, and so now it's up.

01:58:25.010 --> 01:58:42.800
And so I just wanted to demonstrate how kick-ass that is, because my bass station is also a full-sized, you know, it's a real humdinger, and that means that I can put it here.

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.403
And so you can hear the... I think I was listening to CW last night.

01:58:52.381 --> 01:58:55.523
There's probably nothing on the bands right now because it's the middle of the day.

01:58:55.543 --> 01:58:57.323
It's very hard to hear.

01:58:57.403 --> 01:59:00.445
There might be something on the channel.

01:59:00.465 --> 01:59:09.629
And I don't think I'm going to see anything here either.

01:59:12.871 --> 01:59:16.713
I mean it's, ham radio is not done in the middle of the day on these lower bands.

01:59:22.509 --> 01:59:23.650
Somebody tuning up there.

01:59:27.072 --> 01:59:29.474
Anyway, the vast majority of it's going to be garbage right now.

01:59:29.494 --> 01:59:30.715
And there's nobody working right now.

01:59:30.755 --> 01:59:32.377
They got day jobs and stuff like that.

01:59:32.417 --> 01:59:40.843
If you want to see stuff during the day, you need to do it on the weekends, of course, because the majority of the people that do ham are either retired or they have a day job.

01:59:40.883 --> 01:59:41.503
It's one or the other.

01:59:42.024 --> 01:59:44.105
And either way, they're only doing it on the weekends.

01:59:44.145 --> 01:59:47.148
And they're doing it when the atmospheric conditions and timing are right.

01:59:47.935 --> 01:59:53.259
And so the the atmosphere of the earth is energized at different places at different times.

01:59:53.459 --> 02:00:01.585
And so the way that these various radio waves behave relative to the atmosphere is different relative to where the sun is in your particular

02:00:02.563 --> 02:00:27.158
Timezone so in the middle of the day am transmission and long-range transmission for sure is kind of minimal because of the way the Atmosphere works and we could get into that in more detail at some point if we wanted to if we had time to teach instead of having to constantly Point out the fact that America is under attack, which I still feel very obligated to do So anyway, let's let this keep going

02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:28.562
asked these questions before.

02:00:28.622 --> 02:00:31.703
And so I think that's a lot of kudos to you for asking the questions.

02:00:31.763 --> 02:00:36.686
And so I think some of the ideas you have come up with are organized in some thematic areas.

02:00:36.746 --> 02:00:38.247
Maybe we can go through each of the themes.

02:00:38.287 --> 02:00:39.128
Yeah, I just wanted to say this.

02:00:39.168 --> 02:00:47.072
So this this paper that we put out in JAMA, it's an amalgam of, I think, things that matter to you, parties that matter to you, ideas you've heard from people out.

02:00:47.612 --> 02:00:51.394
W3JJW, you can look me up on QRZ if you need to.

02:00:52.175 --> 02:00:54.416
I am actually a ham radio operator for a long time.

02:00:54.456 --> 02:00:55.997
I have my general, not my extra.

02:00:56.698 --> 02:01:00.063
I should really take the extra exam, but I haven't and I don't really know why.

02:01:00.103 --> 02:01:01.145
I guess it's just laziness.

02:01:01.616 --> 02:01:03.857
there and we're trying to put them in some big buckets.

02:01:03.937 --> 02:01:11.581
And so maybe... The really annoying part is, is when I took the general exam, I could sit for the extra and I decided not to.

02:01:11.641 --> 02:01:15.543
And I don't really know why, because it would have only taken another 45 minutes.

02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:22.166
But I was like, I felt so good about acing the general that I was like, I don't want to sit and humiliate myself with the extra.

02:01:22.606 --> 02:01:24.727
But I bet in retrospect, I would have been able to get it.

02:01:24.987 --> 02:01:25.887
Yeah, let's go through the buckets.

02:01:25.927 --> 02:01:28.288
I think the first one is accelerating cure.

02:01:28.309 --> 02:01:30.790
I mean, a technician license, honk, honk.

02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:36.313
Staff or Farian, a technician license is easy.

02:01:36.333 --> 02:01:37.613
A general is even easy.

02:01:37.673 --> 02:01:40.135
I don't think you need to worry about whether you could do it or not.

02:01:40.155 --> 02:01:44.397
There's lots of online courses and it's real basic electronics.

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:47.398
I mean, and definitions more than anything else.

02:01:48.039 --> 02:01:49.600
One of the biggest things you need to know is

02:01:50.720 --> 02:02:16.432
what parts of the spectrum you can transmit in and the hilarious thing is if you buy a modern radio chances are it's going to be locked to those anyway and so there's you don't really need to know it if it won't transmit outside of the band anyway but be that as it may you still need to know hey you wrote a code that trans that converts morris code to text no shit i would like that code send it to me in the email i would love that unpack

02:02:17.213 --> 02:02:22.478
Yeah, look, this big assumption that we've had where it takes more than 10 years for drugs.

02:02:22.538 --> 02:02:24.661
By the way, once a ham, always a ham.

02:02:24.721 --> 02:02:27.744
Just because you don't have a radio doesn't mean you're still not a ham.

02:02:28.044 --> 02:02:28.605
Come to market.

02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:33.350
We've got to challenge the processes that result in that long.

02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:37.174
If you had the cure for breast cancer, do we really think it should

02:02:37.754 --> 02:02:41.496
take 10 years or even six years for that product to come to market.

02:02:42.316 --> 02:02:52.500
At the same time, if you lower the regulatory hurdle to... If you have a cure for breast cancer, then I don't think getting it to market will take that long, right?

02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:58.242
I mean, this is just a disingenuous representation of why the system is the way it is.

02:02:58.282 --> 02:03:02.804
Just like when they were saying yesterday, I've heard that there are applications that are 800,000 pages long.

02:03:04.901 --> 02:03:17.106
of no barrier whatsoever, that is you have no process, then you have snake oil out there and you have people who pay a lot of money for false hope and you do a lot of damage.

02:03:17.566 --> 02:03:24.689
And so- You've said many times that the FDA brand is, it means something, it means something in this country, it means something globally.

02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:32.713
And when we talk about accelerating- The FDA brand, wow, the FDA brand is going to be blamed

02:03:33.453 --> 02:03:36.554
for the destruction of the COVID shot.

02:03:37.355 --> 02:03:45.238
The FDA brand is the whole reason why the world decided to trust and to take transfection as a vaccine.

02:03:46.038 --> 02:03:48.959
Again, I'm using their terms and I shouldn't be.

02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.660
But essentially, that's the reality.

02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:58.763
And so they are setting up the FDA in the United States to be controlled demolished under the pretense that we're to blame for this mess.

02:04:00.904 --> 02:04:02.065
And they're doing it happily.

02:04:02.867 --> 02:04:11.751
First, by seeding a narrative, a narrative, an illusion of consensus that the FDA brand is one of the most powerful and important brands on earth.

02:04:13.551 --> 02:04:16.052
We're not talking about watering down the brand.

02:04:16.112 --> 02:04:19.934
We're talking about speeding effective products to market.

02:04:20.114 --> 02:04:22.395
We're not talking about lowering the standards for what it does.

02:04:22.415 --> 02:04:31.438
Cutting the unnecessary steps, the red tape, the steps that people are very clear, like people here are very clear, like we don't need to be doing this in this way.

02:04:31.799 --> 02:04:37.261
People on the outside saying we're submitting this stuff and nobody is using this information.

02:04:37.321 --> 02:04:39.061
It's unnecessary information.

02:04:39.141 --> 02:04:42.263
So we want to keep the integrity of the scientific process.

02:04:43.123 --> 02:04:47.286
But we want to see more cures and meaningful treatments for the American public.

02:04:48.087 --> 02:04:53.090
And the FDA, as you said, is an amazing brand, one of the best brands of any brand in the world.

02:04:53.171 --> 02:04:59.375
I mean, my grandfather overseas, he relied on that FDA brand as a... Ta-da!

02:04:59.775 --> 02:05:02.718
My grandfather relied on the FDA brand.

02:05:02.758 --> 02:05:03.918
It's a world brand.

02:05:03.959 --> 02:05:07.161
Therefore, we can blame this on the FDA.

02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:09.463
And the world will blame it on the FDA.

02:05:09.903 --> 02:05:12.505
And these people, this theater, will orchestrate it.

02:05:13.601 --> 02:05:14.121
clinician.

02:05:14.782 --> 02:05:17.564
And so he was a pharmacist, clinical pharmacist.

02:05:17.984 --> 02:05:20.306
So I think there's a lot we can do.

02:05:20.366 --> 02:05:27.892
And one of the cool parts of being in leadership at the FDA is you get to see things in the pipeline.

02:05:28.172 --> 02:05:33.356
His grandfather overseas, yeah, overseas, wherever that was, I guess that might be the UK, maybe it's Egypt.

02:05:33.996 --> 02:05:35.998
that are, um, they look amazing.

02:05:36.038 --> 02:05:39.381
I mean, we can't say they're amazing, but they, they sound promising.

02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:41.003
They have plausible mechanisms.

02:05:41.063 --> 02:05:49.211
They have, you know, what doesn't have a plausible mechanism is ivermectin and it's curing of cancer or ivermectin and it's curing of COVID.

02:05:49.231 --> 02:05:51.353
You know, what doesn't have a plausible mechanism?

02:05:53.041 --> 02:05:56.383
is statins and the decreasing of cholesterol.

02:05:56.403 --> 02:06:02.285
You know what doesn't have a plausible mechanism is the surgery, surgical removal of stomach ulcers.

02:06:02.305 --> 02:06:05.607
You know what doesn't have a plausible mechanism of action?

02:06:06.007 --> 02:06:18.913
Transfection to alter a healthy human being, a healthy person, a healthy child, a healthy grandmother, a healthy newborn, a healthy pregnant woman.

02:06:20.683 --> 02:06:25.113
And I can't think of any good reason to transfect a sick one either.

02:06:27.958 --> 02:06:44.515
And these people will never get there just like they will never get to questioning the premise of the whole pandemic that, you know, 220 different EUA-granted PCR tests are capable of defining what the pandemic was in 2020 through 2022.

02:06:45.035 --> 02:06:50.801
This malevolent traitor to our American grandkids will never turn around and look back

02:06:51.421 --> 02:07:00.906
and exercise the authority and mandate of the FDA to patrol safe and effectivity on the products that put this trap in place.

02:07:01.967 --> 02:07:02.807
Holy shit.

02:07:03.247 --> 02:07:05.789
Incredible preclinical data.

02:07:06.369 --> 02:07:19.996
And so when you see something like that, especially coming right out of a clinical setting, you think, oh my gosh, like what can we do as a, as you know, the human race to try to ensure

02:07:21.647 --> 02:07:39.797
this to be available and accessible in a way that we can safeguard public safety to keep to our charge to improve things as safe and effective.

02:07:39.817 --> 02:07:39.997
Right.

02:07:40.017 --> 02:07:42.799
So something you both are talking about, right, is to accelerate cures.

02:07:42.819 --> 02:07:44.940
You have to maintain that rigor and that standard.

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:50.283
And so maybe unpack a little bit some of the strategic principles you outlined of how do you reduce that time, right?

02:07:50.523 --> 02:07:52.783
This podcast is not regulation.

02:07:52.823 --> 02:07:54.664
This podcast is not FDA.

02:07:54.724 --> 02:07:57.925
This podcast is not what Estes Kefauver had envisioned.

02:07:58.425 --> 02:08:00.425
This podcast is not helping America.

02:08:00.465 --> 02:08:16.248
This podcast is a malevolent show, probably scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan because they themselves have confessed that they believe the FDA is a shithole, that it needs to get out of the way, that it's always been in the way, that it's always a problem.

02:08:16.808 --> 02:08:19.709
And it's a problem because understanding

02:08:21.667 --> 02:08:27.449
pursuing the goals of the Human Genome Project, the FDA is definitely in the way.

02:08:28.529 --> 02:08:33.130
Talk about things like animal testing and these process inefficiencies and these long applications, right?

02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:35.151
Those are all steps as part of this, right?

02:08:35.511 --> 02:08:36.251
Yeah.

02:08:37.051 --> 02:08:50.635
So, I mean, we talk about animal testing, we talk about perhaps a prior... We talk about, and they are passing the text of the paper that they supposedly wrote together and published yesterday back and forth to make sure that they can remember what they wrote about.

02:08:51.468 --> 02:08:52.351
Stop lying.

02:08:53.114 --> 02:08:54.578
Stop lying.

02:08:55.435 --> 02:08:56.555
It makes me want to vomit.

02:08:57.376 --> 02:09:06.599
Already a review system where we can shave even more time off the review, where the bulk of the review is looking at parts of the application that don't pertain to the pivotal trial results.

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:13.522
So let's do that work while we're waiting for the pivotal trial to result so that we can pivot very quickly when the pivotal trial results.

02:09:13.542 --> 02:09:14.803
And that's most of the application.

02:09:14.923 --> 02:09:18.204
I got to go play basketball with my sons.

02:09:18.364 --> 02:09:19.665
I just want you to see this.

02:09:19.765 --> 02:09:20.525
Look.

02:09:21.245 --> 02:09:24.427
I think one of the six months with a priority voucher,

02:09:25.678 --> 02:09:28.500
And it has two, I think, really... ...on these things.

02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:33.042
And of course, the big one is our dietary guidelines.

02:09:33.302 --> 02:09:37.605
So the secretary has asked us to work... So they're going to do new dietary guidelines.

02:09:37.645 --> 02:09:41.707
And the other thing that's in this video that I may start with tomorrow because it's so shitty.

02:09:42.563 --> 02:09:49.709
is that they're gonna tell you how they're gonna get rid of animal trials because toxicology studies can now be done on AI.

02:09:49.749 --> 02:09:58.375
You know, like the domain server that Robert Malone used to identify silicoxib and famotidine and ivermectin and remdesivir at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:09:58.776 --> 02:10:07.502
That same technology is gonna be used by the FDA to eliminate animal studies and streamline the approval process

02:10:08.283 --> 02:10:15.050
Please, ladies and gentlemen, understand that America is under attack and the only people who are telling you the truth are me and Mark Kulak and Joe Marshall.

02:10:15.571 --> 02:10:20.135
Please, ladies and gentlemen, please, I'm begging you, see.

02:10:20.896 --> 02:10:22.478
Please open your eyes and see it.

02:10:23.018 --> 02:10:25.281
Please open your eyes and see it.

02:10:25.521 --> 02:10:26.942
We don't have much time.

02:10:27.583 --> 02:10:29.945
We don't have much time to teach this to our children.

02:10:30.606 --> 02:10:43.755
I got to go play basketball because I'm trying to get in shape so that I can put a new channel together that will change the world or at least start it moving in a way that this program is unable to do because the internet blocks it.

02:10:43.895 --> 02:10:45.777
So please share it manually.

02:10:45.877 --> 02:10:48.239
Please share it as often as you can, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:48.259 --> 02:10:49.059
The truth is out there.

02:10:49.079 --> 02:10:50.240
All you got to do is look for it.

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:50.960
And it ain't from him.

02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:54.983
One thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists.

02:10:55.203 --> 02:10:56.104
You can capture it.

02:10:56.164 --> 02:10:57.025
You can sequence it.

02:10:57.085 --> 02:10:59.286
You can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

02:11:00.527 --> 02:11:00.748
No.

02:11:01.849 --> 02:11:02.449
No, you can't.

02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:04.792
Get off social media, ladies and gentlemen.

02:11:05.392 --> 02:11:06.493
I'm going to basketball.

02:11:06.874 --> 02:11:09.016
I love you very much and I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:11:09.056 --> 02:11:10.558
The board man gets paid, baby.
