00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:52.160
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're feeling with essentially a worst-case

00:52.160 --> 00:56.160
scenario. I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case

01:22.160 --> 01:42.160
I think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth no more than society. We want everybody to feel good. That's not that's not the way life is.

01:42.160 --> 02:01.160
But you can tell if someone's lying. You know you can sort of feel it in people. And I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie. I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

02:12.160 --> 02:34.160
I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

02:43.160 --> 02:54.160
I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. We don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.160
I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.160
I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.160
I just want to be a liar.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.160
I just want to be a liar.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Lilian.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
I just want to be a liar.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.160
Lilian.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
Lilian we're so busy.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
Lilian.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
Lilian.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.160
Lilian.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Lilian.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
It's also great.

03:11.160 --> 03:11.660
Lilian.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.660
It's like, what in the world, man?

03:13.660 --> 03:24.660
MUSIC

03:24.660 --> 03:26.660
Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.660
I'm really excited to be here this afternoon.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.660
It's hard to say that this is some kind of work.

03:32.660 --> 03:35.660
When you get the opportunity to talk to someone like Thomas

03:35.660 --> 03:38.660
Binder, M.D., from Switzerland,

03:38.660 --> 03:42.660
it is a rare opportunity to talk to someone who wasn't enchanted

03:42.660 --> 03:44.660
by this elaborate theater.

03:44.660 --> 03:47.660
It wasn't trapped inside of it.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.660
Thomas Binder is somebody that, since the very beginning

03:51.660 --> 03:54.660
of my knowing who he was,

03:54.660 --> 03:57.660
he was at the top of the wave up here.

03:57.660 --> 03:59.660
He has been staying focused on the biology.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.660
He hasn't taken the bait on television,

04:01.660 --> 04:03.660
and he's loved his neighbors.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.660
That's how we get through this,

04:05.660 --> 04:08.660
and I think more than almost anyone,

04:08.660 --> 04:10.660
except for maybe Mike Eden or somebody else,

04:10.660 --> 04:12.660
I really have been following Thomas for a long time,

04:12.660 --> 04:16.660
and it is a great privilege to be able to talk to him today.

04:16.660 --> 04:20.660
You can find all of the stuff that I do at giggleandbiological.com.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.660
I'm not going to waste time running through that too long.

04:22.660 --> 04:25.660
Thank you very much to the people that subscribe.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.660
I am going to go rather quick, and I'll put that up at the end.

04:28.660 --> 04:32.660
This is a production of the Independent Bright Web,

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
not to be confused with the Intellectual Dark Web.

04:34.660 --> 04:38.660
We are a group of people that's just trying to get the truth out,

04:38.660 --> 04:42.660
and the truth is that this is an illusion that is sustained

04:42.660 --> 04:44.660
only through your active participation,

04:44.660 --> 04:47.660
and so we've all got to help each other to drop our hands

04:47.660 --> 04:51.660
from our faces and to engage in united non-compliance.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.660
I'm hoping that our guest is going to be able to give us

04:54.660 --> 04:59.660
a unique insight into what he saw in Switzerland

04:59.660 --> 05:01.660
and looking outward toward the rest of Europe

05:01.660 --> 05:03.660
and toward the rest of the world.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.660
What he saw on TV, what he saw on social media

05:05.660 --> 05:08.660
that would have led people in Switzerland to believe

05:08.660 --> 05:10.660
that a pandemic was even occurring.

05:10.660 --> 05:13.660
You guys are very familiar with the fact that

05:13.660 --> 05:16.660
we more or less were told

05:16.660 --> 05:19.660
that hello, this is giggleandbiological,

05:19.660 --> 05:21.660
a high-resistance low-noise information brief

05:21.660 --> 05:22.660
brought to you by a biologist.

05:22.660 --> 05:25.660
We were told in the United States that something terrible was happening

05:25.660 --> 05:29.660
in New York City, and if we didn't lock down for 15 or 30 days

05:29.660 --> 05:32.660
of close schools, that what happened in New York City

05:32.660 --> 05:34.660
was going to spread all around the United States

05:34.660 --> 05:37.660
and luckily, despite all of the resistance

05:37.660 --> 05:39.660
and all of the conservative idiocy

05:39.660 --> 05:41.660
and all of Trump's missteps,

05:41.660 --> 05:43.660
we were able to somehow avoid what happened

05:43.660 --> 05:46.660
in New York City happening everywhere else in America,

05:46.660 --> 05:48.660
and we haven't been able to really get

05:48.660 --> 05:50.660
a good explanation for that,

05:50.660 --> 05:52.660
and I'm wondering what they saw in Switzerland.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.660
I'm wondering what they used as a worst-case scenario

05:55.660 --> 05:58.660
over there, and without further introduction,

05:58.660 --> 05:59.660
I'm just going to slide this window.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.660
I've got to push you over here.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.660
That means I need to pull this window up over there

06:04.660 --> 06:06.660
and make it big.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.660
Hello, Thomas.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.660
I'm going to switch over to this side.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.660
I'll put myself on the bottom down here,

06:11.660 --> 06:14.660
and if you could just introduce yourself,

06:14.660 --> 06:16.660
a lot of people on the watch of my stream

06:16.660 --> 06:18.660
would already know who you are,

06:18.660 --> 06:20.660
and then just kind of, you know,

06:20.660 --> 06:22.660
tell us where you're at

06:22.660 --> 06:24.660
and what you think is the best way out

06:24.660 --> 06:27.660
because I think that's where we need to go as quick as possible.

06:27.660 --> 06:29.660
We only have you for, like, an hour,

06:29.660 --> 06:32.660
and I want to talk about forward-thinking solutions

06:32.660 --> 06:33.660
to the problem that we're in,

06:33.660 --> 06:34.660
but welcome.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.660
Thank you very much for being here.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.660
Hi, Jay.

06:38.660 --> 06:42.660
Thank you for having me and for your more-than-kind introduction,

06:42.660 --> 06:44.660
of course.

06:44.660 --> 06:48.660
Yeah, well, I study medicine in Zurich, Switzerland,

06:48.660 --> 06:51.660
and I was not sure whether I should go into research

06:51.660 --> 06:54.660
or into clinics, so I spent a year in the department

06:54.660 --> 06:57.660
for immunology and virology,

06:57.660 --> 06:59.660
and I wrote my thesis there,

06:59.660 --> 07:02.660
so I have the background in that area as well.

07:02.660 --> 07:04.660
But then I decided,

07:04.660 --> 07:06.660
I should become a clinician,

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
so I specialized person in internal medicine

07:08.660 --> 07:10.660
and then in cardiology.

07:10.660 --> 07:11.660
During that time,

07:11.660 --> 07:14.660
I worked in hospitals for about 10 years,

07:14.660 --> 07:19.660
and then I was always the kind to question the authority.

07:19.660 --> 07:23.660
This is not a good idea if you want to make

07:23.660 --> 07:25.660
an academic career,

07:25.660 --> 07:28.660
so I decided very early

07:28.660 --> 07:32.660
that I would get a broad education

07:32.660 --> 07:34.660
as broad as possible,

07:34.660 --> 07:36.660
but then I should become,

07:36.660 --> 07:39.660
should I open my private practice,

07:39.660 --> 07:43.660
and I did this 26 years ago.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.660
I'm working in my cardiology practice

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
where I'm sitting now here in Beijing

07:47.660 --> 07:50.660
that's also close to Zurich in Switzerland,

07:50.660 --> 07:55.660
and I'm also somewhat an internist at GP

07:55.660 --> 07:59.660
for some of my cardiology patients.

07:59.660 --> 08:03.660
Yeah, well, it was the same everywhere, of course.

08:03.660 --> 08:10.660
I mean, the first confrontation with these alleged pandemic,

08:10.660 --> 08:12.660
also in Switzerland, of course,

08:12.660 --> 08:16.660
were these pictures, these videos from Wuhan,

08:16.660 --> 08:20.660
but they found immediately, instantly, they are strange.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.660
I mean, they were, that was really too much.

08:24.660 --> 08:28.660
I mean, these hordes running around in penguin suits,

08:28.660 --> 08:31.660
they were cannon, they showed us cannons mounted on lorries

08:31.660 --> 08:34.660
that sprayed something in the air,

08:34.660 --> 08:36.660
allegedly disinfectants,

08:36.660 --> 08:40.660
and people that allegedly died suddenly in the streets,

08:40.660 --> 08:42.660
but if you looked at these YouTube videos,

08:42.660 --> 08:45.660
you saw, you realized that they are always landing on their hands,

08:45.660 --> 08:47.660
but this was all fake.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.660
This I realized instantly,

08:49.660 --> 08:54.660
that these are not measures against the virus,

08:54.660 --> 08:59.660
these are pictures that are directed against the people,

08:59.660 --> 09:00.660
propaganda.

09:00.660 --> 09:05.660
At that time, of course, I didn't know whether these propaganda

09:05.660 --> 09:08.660
was directed against the Chinese populace

09:08.660 --> 09:12.660
and just spread around the world or against the whole,

09:12.660 --> 09:14.660
populace of the whole world,

09:14.660 --> 09:18.660
but I smelled, there is something wrong going on,

09:18.660 --> 09:22.660
and of course, it reminded me of the last alleged pandemic,

09:22.660 --> 09:26.660
the scam, that was the swine flu scam in 2009,

09:26.660 --> 09:30.660
but then there was rather silence here in Switzerland

09:30.660 --> 09:31.660
for about a month,

09:31.660 --> 09:35.660
and then suddenly, some time in February,

09:35.660 --> 09:40.660
I woke up with the news, now the virus is in Berger.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.660
Berger is in northern Italy,

09:43.660 --> 09:48.660
about 15 kilometers from the Swiss border where I live,

09:48.660 --> 09:51.660
so the Swiss were terrified, of course,

09:51.660 --> 09:56.660
and at the same time, we got information from Wuhan

09:56.660 --> 10:02.660
that they were successful in their heroic war against the virus.

10:02.660 --> 10:08.660
So I was amazed how obviously almost everybody here in Switzerland

10:08.660 --> 10:13.660
thought, well, then we have to do the same as the Chinese state,

10:13.660 --> 10:18.660
we have to install the same unscientific insane measures

10:18.660 --> 10:23.660
against the virus that I couldn't understand the world,

10:23.660 --> 10:28.660
because in everything I had learned in medical school,

10:28.660 --> 10:30.660
during my scientific education,

10:30.660 --> 10:34.660
in my practical medical efforts turned upside down overnight.

10:34.660 --> 10:39.660
So I instantly realized, probably because I have these combined scientific

10:39.660 --> 10:42.660
and practical background, the broad education,

10:42.660 --> 10:47.660
and of course, I took the red pill years ago, not so.

10:47.660 --> 10:53.660
I guess in about 2007, I saw the collapse of World Trade Center building 7,

10:53.660 --> 10:59.660
and then I realized that the official conspiracy about 9-11,

10:59.660 --> 11:04.660
that the 9-11, 20 Muslims on with box cultures overcame the whole USA

11:04.660 --> 11:10.660
and the laws of nature is nonsense, then I checked the climate story,

11:10.660 --> 11:15.660
and there also, you need to have three unwashed grains,

11:15.660 --> 11:20.660
connected grain cells to realize also this is a scam.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.660
Yeah, and so on and so forth.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.660
So I was, of course, prepared.

11:24.660 --> 11:28.660
I knew that if something big like this happens,

11:28.660 --> 11:32.660
this is wrong until proven otherwise.

11:32.660 --> 11:39.660
And the first thing I realized was the wrong indication to test.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.660
How did we treat the flu or the cold?

11:42.660 --> 11:46.660
Before 2020, these are usually self-limiting diseases,

11:46.660 --> 11:51.660
so we treat ourselves, we stay a term, and after seven days it's old.

11:51.660 --> 11:56.660
And only in severe cases, if it gets worse, maybe after five days or so,

11:56.660 --> 12:04.660
we went to GP and then he maybe diagnosed the secondary complicating bacteria of pneumonia

12:04.660 --> 12:10.660
that could still be treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis.

12:10.660 --> 12:14.660
And only if you really got sick, life-threatening sick,

12:14.660 --> 12:17.660
the GP sent us to the hospital at only at that stage,

12:17.660 --> 12:20.660
we tested for a causative virus.

12:20.660 --> 12:24.660
Because before this, it's absolutely not important

12:24.660 --> 12:30.660
that we are suffering from influenza, Corona, B19, SARS-CoV-2, or whatever,

12:30.660 --> 12:34.660
because it has no therapeutic and no prognostic consequences.

12:34.660 --> 12:39.660
So only at that stage we tested, because if there's really the risk to die,

12:39.660 --> 12:44.660
then we want to treat specifically, and then we have to know the causative virus.

12:44.660 --> 12:50.660
Wow, that has never been so succinctly stated for me.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.660
That's fantastic.

12:51.660 --> 12:52.660
Wow.

12:52.660 --> 12:54.660
Yes, I always was amazed.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.660
I mean, when you're talking about the nonsense PCR test,

12:58.660 --> 13:02.660
but even before this comes the wrong indication to test.

13:02.660 --> 13:07.660
And I could not understand why not every clinician realized this.

13:07.660 --> 13:12.660
I mean, now everybody who only failed the sore throat,

13:12.660 --> 13:17.660
run to the hospital, please, please, have me test me, test me.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.660
Maybe I have to die, and not only to die, but to suffer chemiscerably.

13:22.660 --> 13:23.660
This never happened.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.660
My practice was almost empty.

13:25.660 --> 13:30.660
I saw almost no flu patients in that season, because everybody with the sore throat

13:30.660 --> 13:32.660
run to the hospital.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.660
And then of course, some places say that the emergency departments,

13:37.660 --> 13:41.660
at least, were overcrowded with people suffering from a cold.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.660
Yeah.

13:43.660 --> 13:48.660
And then the next, of course, already in March, I tweeted,

13:48.660 --> 13:51.660
the test is the disease, not the virus.

13:51.660 --> 13:57.660
I mean, the proof of usually, if you wanted to test for an infection,

13:57.660 --> 13:59.660
we measured the antibody.

13:59.660 --> 14:06.660
But GIGM subclass for acute infections, IGG for chronic infections,

14:06.660 --> 14:13.660
because only these tests prove that the body struggled with the virus.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.660
So the so created antibodies.

14:15.660 --> 14:17.660
So this is a proof for infection.

14:17.660 --> 14:20.660
Either acute or chronic.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.660
But here they used the PCR test.

14:22.660 --> 14:26.660
And already about 20 years ago, I didn't like these tests.

14:26.660 --> 14:32.660
When I was young, when I was an intern, that the diagnosis was viral pneumonia.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.660
Usually we had no idea what was the causative term.

14:35.660 --> 14:39.660
And then about 20 years ago, I think they started to taste.

14:39.660 --> 14:43.660
So when you, when you are hospitalized with a viral pneumonia,

14:43.660 --> 14:47.660
they do a PCR on some, on some viruses, not the fall.

14:47.660 --> 14:52.660
And usually they choose the one with the lowest CT to be the causative term.

14:52.660 --> 14:54.660
But this can never be approved.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.660
The PCR test is no test for infection.

14:56.660 --> 15:01.660
The PCR PCR or the hardy PCR, if you want to look for RNA.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.660
These are tests for these tests.

15:04.660 --> 15:12.660
It's a test for the presence of a certain amount of a certain part of the genome of a, of a, of a term.

15:12.660 --> 15:17.660
So this, the wrong, this was also the wrong testing method.

15:17.660 --> 15:22.660
I mean, even, even if it was a 100% sensitive and specific test,

15:22.660 --> 15:26.660
these tests alone would never prove an infection.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.660
Of course, if there is a high amount of virus, for example,

15:29.660 --> 15:37.660
a CT, a PCR, or the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 would get a result of CT 17

15:37.660 --> 15:40.660
and the worm against the influence of 30.

15:40.660 --> 15:45.660
Then, and then if the symptoms are consistent with, with, with, with this diagnosis,

15:45.660 --> 15:50.660
then highly likely SARS-CoV-2 would be the causative term,

15:50.660 --> 15:52.660
but it could never be approved.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.660
And here they didn't absolutely consider the clinical conditions,

15:56.660 --> 15:59.660
the symptoms of the patients or the clinical findings.

15:59.660 --> 16:06.660
There is no single clinical radiologic or whatever proof of a, of a, of a, of a SARS-CoV-2.

16:06.660 --> 16:11.660
The SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 called COVID-19.

16:11.660 --> 16:16.660
The PCR test, even if it's a good one, is only a, a, a piece of the parts of the,

16:16.660 --> 16:19.660
in the diagnostic puzzle.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.660
And then I went deeper into these PCR tests.

16:22.660 --> 16:25.660
And the area I found is corn and drowson protocol.

16:25.660 --> 16:28.660
I published in the journal Euro Surveillance.

16:28.660 --> 16:33.660
I guess in about January 20th, on January 21st, 2020.

16:33.660 --> 16:41.660
And I mean, you must say, this is the worst possible RTPCR test for SARS-CoV-2.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.660
How did, how did all the people on that paper end up coming together?

16:45.660 --> 16:50.660
Like who, who was the impetus between like, hey, calling up, I mean,

16:50.660 --> 16:53.660
that, that list of people on there is quite, I don't know.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.660
It's a motley crew of people.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.660
It's not just a bunch of guys from Switzerland.

16:57.660 --> 17:01.660
How did, how did that author list get assembled?

17:01.660 --> 17:04.660
You mean the, the corn and drosson?

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
Yeah.

17:05.660 --> 17:06.660
Paper.

17:06.660 --> 17:07.660
Yeah.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.660
Well, the, the, the drosson, drosson is an important figure.

17:10.660 --> 17:16.660
You guys in the USA must realize there is not only four C, drosson is much worse.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.660
Because drosson is the inventor.

17:18.660 --> 17:22.660
I mean, we took it with corman, corman, drosson, et al.

17:22.660 --> 17:28.660
But today invented this nonsense, RTPCR testing protocol.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.660
And he's also an inventor of drosson.

17:31.660 --> 17:34.660
It earlier wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.

17:34.660 --> 17:39.660
It was published on January 30th, I think, 2020.

17:39.660 --> 17:45.660
And there they propagated the myth of epidemiologically relevant asymptomatic

17:45.660 --> 17:46.660
transmission.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.660
So drosson is really at the core of this whole scam.

17:49.660 --> 17:50.660
Oh, no.

17:50.660 --> 17:51.660
No, I get the.

17:51.660 --> 17:52.660
Absolutely.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.660
I get that.

17:53.660 --> 17:54.660
I get that.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.660
Absolutely get that.

17:55.660 --> 17:59.660
He actually was the one who first defined also the PCR test for the original

17:59.660 --> 18:02.660
virus and saw in 2002.

18:02.660 --> 18:07.660
I'm just curious how the, the opposition paper that you were on about the,

18:07.660 --> 18:09.660
the primer dimers and that kind of thing.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.660
How did you and Mike Eden get together on that paper?

18:12.660 --> 18:13.660
Did you know each other previously?

18:13.660 --> 18:14.660
Yeah.

18:14.660 --> 18:19.660
I was asked by, but this was somewhat later, we published the external peer

18:19.660 --> 18:24.660
review of the common drosson protocol in November, 2020.

18:24.660 --> 18:30.660
I was asked by Peter Borger from the Netherlands to join.

18:30.660 --> 18:35.660
Well, I mean, I must state, of course, I'm not a PCR guy.

18:35.660 --> 18:36.660
No, it's okay.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.660
That's exactly what I was asking.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.660
I know the method.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.660
I know the indication.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.660
I know what he can and what he does, what he does.

18:44.660 --> 18:45.660
Okay.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.660
For this, we had great PCR guys.

18:47.660 --> 18:52.660
We had to read a camera from Germany and then, uh, Kevin McKernan, who became

18:52.660 --> 18:53.660
famous again.

18:53.660 --> 18:59.660
The recently when he was the first who discovered the contamination with

18:59.660 --> 19:01.660
past media and I from the manufacturing process.

19:01.660 --> 19:07.660
So I was, I was mainly asked as one of the earliest in light tuners to join

19:07.660 --> 19:08.660
this.

19:08.660 --> 19:13.660
I see my contribution was mainly in the event of two or three months later,

19:13.660 --> 19:17.660
I was published in the tandem and that there is a clinical section or

19:17.660 --> 19:18.660
section E.

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
That is about clinical aspect.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.660
I see.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.660
And that this is main.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.660
This is mostly written by me.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.660
So this is about the wrong indication to test and the wrong test.

19:26.660 --> 19:30.660
So I, I, my contribution was in the event.

19:30.660 --> 19:33.660
In the, in the first, in the external period, we played.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.660
I honestly, I just proved we're right.

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
It's.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.660
No, no, I get it.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
Yep.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.660
I was just.

19:40.660 --> 19:44.660
When I look back on that paper, it's, it's remarkable to me how many,

19:44.660 --> 19:48.660
how many people are on that paper that went on to, you know,

19:48.660 --> 19:51.660
fight various aspects of this for a long time.

19:51.660 --> 19:52.660
It was a gathering.

19:52.660 --> 19:57.660
It was a gathering of, of, of early people who went public early,

19:57.660 --> 19:58.660
mainly.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.660
And of course some PCR tracks.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.660
Right.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.660
Right.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.660
Very cool.

20:05.660 --> 20:09.660
Well, in the meantime, maybe, maybe if there's not everybody knows this,

20:09.660 --> 20:10.660
there was a slander.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.660
I mean, I published in the rocks.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.660
Of course, I could not reach out to journalists.

20:14.660 --> 20:18.660
I mean, at the start, I thought, yeah, well, we have to publish,

20:18.660 --> 20:19.660
make this public.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.660
And then the course out is prevailing corona, corona nonsense narrative

20:23.660 --> 20:24.660
field.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.660
Fresh.

20:25.660 --> 20:29.660
But, but I never got an answer when I sent email to journalists to

20:29.660 --> 20:33.660
fellow doctors, even not to them to, to politicians.

20:33.660 --> 20:37.660
And I never got even an answer like Thomas, you're crazy or so,

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
just no answer.

20:38.660 --> 20:39.660
This was, this was spooky, spooky.

20:39.660 --> 20:40.660
Interesting.

20:40.660 --> 20:44.660
And so I intensified my activities in the social media.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.660
I wrote box and the first day before Easter 2020, I wrote a huge

20:48.660 --> 20:52.660
book where I once again explained the wrong indication to taste,

20:52.660 --> 20:53.660
wrong taste.

20:53.660 --> 20:56.660
I did like, you know, epidemiological, relevant, asymptomatic

20:56.660 --> 20:57.660
transmission.

20:57.660 --> 21:02.660
Also, these piece that the CFR nonsense side, they sold at that

21:02.660 --> 21:03.660
point.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.660
And they told us the CFR, the case fatality rate in Switzerland is

21:06.660 --> 21:07.660
about 2%.

21:07.660 --> 21:12.660
My, my, of course, every pupil understands that important is not

21:12.660 --> 21:16.660
the CFR, but the IFR, the infection fatality rate that highly likely

21:16.660 --> 21:21.660
is 100 times or so long, not lower because of the great many

21:21.660 --> 21:24.660
number of, um, undetected cases.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.660
So I already at that time, I stated this virus is not more dangerous

21:28.660 --> 21:29.660
than in France.

21:29.660 --> 21:33.660
I highly like even less dangerous in the range of other, you know,

21:33.660 --> 21:38.660
of his brothers and cis brother and sisters coronaviruses about

21:38.660 --> 21:39.660
0.02%.

21:39.660 --> 21:42.660
I stated already in March 2020.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.660
Yeah, I was right.

21:44.660 --> 21:49.660
But then a good acquaintance of mine.

21:49.660 --> 21:55.660
Whom I have also, whom I wrote sent these emails as well who I tried

21:55.660 --> 21:56.660
to inform.

21:57.660 --> 22:02.660
In these, in the things I wrote, he projected threats, threats to

22:02.660 --> 22:04.660
the government, threats to the society.

22:04.660 --> 22:05.660
I stayed here.

22:05.660 --> 22:09.660
For example, this virus is not so dangerous, et cetera.

22:09.660 --> 22:13.660
And so he called another good acquaintance of mine.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.660
Actually, the prime minister of the Comton Arc.

22:16.660 --> 22:20.660
This is the province in Switzerland where I live and on the phone.

22:20.660 --> 22:22.660
And he made three allegations.

22:22.660 --> 22:25.660
Allegation one was I was a threat for the government for the

22:25.660 --> 22:26.660
society.

22:26.660 --> 22:30.660
I was armed and I had a psychiatric history.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.660
And then on the phone, on the phone, they decided they do not want

22:33.660 --> 22:34.660
to call me.

22:34.660 --> 22:38.660
Hey Thomas, we do not understand what you want to explain us.

22:38.660 --> 22:43.660
Please could we meet for a corona and we can ask you and you can

22:43.660 --> 22:44.660
explain it just now.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.660
They decided to call the chief of the state police and he started

22:49.660 --> 22:53.660
an operation on Saturday evening.

22:54.660 --> 22:57.660
I did some final work in my practice here in Switzerland and

22:57.660 --> 22:58.660
I'm sitting here.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.660
So that's sad today.

22:59.660 --> 23:00.660
It's four years ago.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.660
I'm used to sad today.

23:02.660 --> 23:08.660
And before I want to go on holiday, I had some final work to do.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.660
And at about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was arrested here in

23:11.660 --> 23:15.660
my practice by an anti terrorist unit about 20 policemen were

23:15.660 --> 23:17.660
involved in the whole operation.

23:17.660 --> 23:21.660
60 policemen were involved because at the same time, they

23:22.660 --> 23:24.660
had to go check it all five minutes.

23:24.660 --> 23:25.660
So far.

23:25.660 --> 23:29.660
Provincial government and they even close the train station.

23:29.660 --> 23:34.660
That is opposite to my practice for some hours because of the

23:34.660 --> 23:35.660
bail known, but.

23:35.660 --> 23:39.660
Fundamentalist terrorist doctor Thomas Binder.

23:39.660 --> 23:40.660
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

23:40.660 --> 23:44.660
Now, can I interrupt here and just say that in America, it feels

23:44.660 --> 23:47.660
like this would be easy to do because America is so fractured

23:48.660 --> 23:52.660
and the cities are so big, but I did a postdoc in Lausanne and

23:52.660 --> 23:57.660
I have the feeling just the size of the communities in Switzerland

23:57.660 --> 24:00.660
and the language, the way the language works there and how

24:00.660 --> 24:02.660
everybody is so tightly knit.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.660
How could they get away with this?

24:04.660 --> 24:07.660
You must have had a reputation of not being crazy, right?

24:07.660 --> 24:08.660
You would live there your whole life.

24:08.660 --> 24:12.660
I mean, how could this not have huge ramifications for the

24:12.660 --> 24:13.660
truth or did it?

24:13.660 --> 24:14.660
I mean.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.660
Maybe I have to continue just a little bit.

24:17.660 --> 24:18.660
Okay.

24:18.660 --> 24:19.660
Yes.

24:19.660 --> 24:20.660
Sorry.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
After an hour after an hour, they realized all these three

24:22.660 --> 24:23.660
allegations were wrong.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.660
I had no gun at all.

24:25.660 --> 24:28.660
I had the gun at home, but these were stored at home.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.660
This was the gun I got in 1980.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.660
Then I entered the Swiss military service and then I left

24:33.660 --> 24:36.660
military about 15 years ago.

24:36.660 --> 24:40.660
As a prime lieutenant at that time, I stored the weapon at home

24:40.660 --> 24:41.660
without ammunition.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.660
This is legal and absolutely no in Switzerland.

24:43.660 --> 24:45.660
But I didn't carry a gun on me.

24:45.660 --> 24:49.660
And I had no psychiatric history and they could not show me

24:49.660 --> 24:52.660
any single threat in all I had to read.

24:52.660 --> 24:56.660
There were there are 100 pages or 200 pages,

24:56.660 --> 25:01.660
Twitter, Twitter and all of all these stuff all around.

25:01.660 --> 25:02.660
Yeah.

25:02.660 --> 25:03.660
But then they did not send me home.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.660
They did not apologize.

25:05.660 --> 25:07.660
They obviously there is.

25:07.660 --> 25:08.660
Oh, my God.

25:08.660 --> 25:09.660
False alarm.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.660
60 policemen.

25:10.660 --> 25:17.660
This will go public because I I sent the message when I realized

25:17.660 --> 25:21.660
the police is there and I sent the message in Twitter.

25:21.660 --> 25:26.660
The country the police is is is arresting me is coming

25:26.660 --> 25:27.660
off to me.

25:27.660 --> 25:32.660
And this created some huge interest.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.660
So I created quite a good quite huge interest.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.660
And so probably they have to think of how could we get

25:39.660 --> 25:43.660
out there and they sent a fellow doctor to me and emergency

25:43.660 --> 25:49.660
doctor and she had to check whether I was able to be arrested

25:49.660 --> 25:51.660
or physically able.

25:51.660 --> 25:54.660
Although they could not even arrest me, shouldn't arrest

25:54.660 --> 25:55.660
warrant.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.660
They could not put me in prison because I did nothing unlawful.

25:57.660 --> 26:00.660
After now they had realized that I did nothing unlawful.

26:00.660 --> 26:04.660
And she decided I was Corona insane.

26:04.660 --> 26:05.660
Yeah.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.660
But I mean, you must imagine at that time,

26:07.660 --> 26:10.660
she was such a FFP, hard to hardcore mosque.

26:10.660 --> 26:14.660
And when I entered her room, she shouted out, put on the mosque,

26:14.660 --> 26:16.660
put on the master virus, the virus.

26:16.660 --> 26:21.660
So these fellow doctor had to check my mental status.

26:21.660 --> 26:25.660
I had in the normal world, I would have had to check her mental

26:25.660 --> 26:26.660
status.

26:26.660 --> 26:29.660
I mean, I did such examinations for involuntary commitment

26:29.660 --> 26:30.660
myself.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.660
Maybe one hundred times in my life or so.

26:32.660 --> 26:33.660
Yeah.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.660
But the first question was what is the date?

26:36.660 --> 26:37.660
Yes.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.660
It answered April 11, 2020.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.660
It may be the first question or so.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.660
What is the current year?

26:44.660 --> 26:49.660
And this was not very intelligent, of course.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.660
But it was a kind of silent protest.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.660
Then I answered 1984.

26:53.660 --> 26:56.660
No, really.

26:56.660 --> 26:58.660
That's no joke.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.660
I believe that it's fantastic.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.660
And she, yeah.

27:02.660 --> 27:05.660
And she decided, yes, I am Corona insane.

27:05.660 --> 27:08.660
So she didn't enter the new diagnosis, Corona insanity.

27:08.660 --> 27:12.660
And to be insane, if you are insane, you can still be kind people.

27:12.660 --> 27:17.660
For involuntary commitment, you must also endangering others or be

27:17.660 --> 27:19.660
self-intangling.

27:19.660 --> 27:22.660
So as I know, I was not in danger in others.

27:22.660 --> 27:24.660
She said I was self-intangling.

27:24.660 --> 27:28.660
Although two days or so before I tweeted something like,

27:28.660 --> 27:31.660
I'm 58 years old sports and no medication.

27:31.660 --> 27:33.660
I would never have a commit suicide.

27:33.660 --> 27:36.660
Because I realized, of course, this was very spooky.

27:36.660 --> 27:41.660
And that I could go some risk if I go public.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.660
That could be some risk if I go public.

27:43.660 --> 27:44.660
Yeah.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.660
Then they put me into close psychiatry for six days.

27:46.660 --> 27:49.660
The 36 hours in the padded cell.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.660
They had a psychiatrist diagnosed mania.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.660
I appealed and called and I was released.

27:54.660 --> 27:58.660
But they, because I had mania, they said, well, you're a doctor.

27:58.660 --> 27:59.660
You want to work.

28:00.660 --> 28:04.660
Who stay in the psychiatric hospital for six weeks to have treated

28:04.660 --> 28:06.660
your mania or you may leave.

28:06.660 --> 28:08.660
But you must need to believe you're neurolaptic.

28:08.660 --> 28:15.660
And whether you take it or not is checked every week by a bot level

28:15.660 --> 28:16.660
check.

28:16.660 --> 28:19.660
So I chose the second decision.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.660
After I left, I restarted to work.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.660
They could never really do me harm because I never did anything

28:27.660 --> 28:28.660
like that.

28:28.660 --> 28:31.660
And I never said something that was not 100% scientific

28:31.660 --> 28:32.660
or evidence based.

28:32.660 --> 28:34.660
At least not evidence based in the current.

28:34.660 --> 28:37.660
Currently accepted scientific belief system.

28:37.660 --> 28:41.660
So number two, number two was go home and take medicine or go.

28:41.660 --> 28:42.660
I didn't understand.

28:42.660 --> 28:43.660
Yes.

28:43.660 --> 28:44.660
Yeah.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.660
Yeah.

28:45.660 --> 28:46.660
I did this.

28:46.660 --> 28:47.660
Yeah.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.660
Yeah.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.660
Yeah.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.660
Of course, I mean, I took two tablets of ability by the day before they

28:52.660 --> 28:54.660
did the blood check.

28:55.660 --> 28:56.660
And so this.

28:56.660 --> 29:00.660
And then after three weeks, I checked my liver and enzymes and

29:00.660 --> 29:03.660
happily my liver and times went up about three times.

29:03.660 --> 29:04.660
So I could stop it.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.660
And at the same time, I could release me from this state

29:07.660 --> 29:12.660
psychiatry change to a private to the psychiatrist because, of

29:12.660 --> 29:14.660
course, also the health authorities.

29:14.660 --> 29:18.660
They wanted to the psychiatry report every about six weeks by

29:18.660 --> 29:23.660
a psychiatrist that I'm mentally able to treat to see and treat

29:23.660 --> 29:24.660
patients.

29:24.660 --> 29:25.660
Yeah.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
Yeah.

29:26.660 --> 29:29.660
I mean, my case shows nicely what's going on.

29:29.660 --> 29:34.660
Obviously, the society is divided like we had never seen before.

29:34.660 --> 29:37.660
And this never happens by accident.

29:37.660 --> 29:40.660
This means that the part, the huge part of society is living in

29:40.660 --> 29:43.660
the context of delusion in a coat or in a sec.

29:43.660 --> 29:47.660
And of course, everybody says, no, I have the real least you are

29:47.660 --> 29:49.660
living in a coat.

29:49.660 --> 29:52.660
So in this situation, we must always question ourselves and

29:52.660 --> 29:55.660
I did this, of course, 100 times before I went public.

29:55.660 --> 29:58.660
Am I absolutely sure that I'm the real least and not to the

29:58.660 --> 29:59.660
root?

29:59.660 --> 30:03.660
And to answer, you can only answer these questions.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.660
Am I the real least or the deluded by looking at the reality as

30:06.660 --> 30:09.660
possibly as possible that these worlds is what I need.

30:09.660 --> 30:12.660
I informed the public about the reality.

30:12.660 --> 30:17.660
From my, I, my view on the reality so that the public could

30:17.660 --> 30:21.660
decide who is right and who is wrong or at least to his close

30:21.660 --> 30:24.660
to the reality and then to not.

30:24.660 --> 30:27.660
I mean, this is, this is what was amazing, but what everybody

30:27.660 --> 30:29.660
should have realized also.

30:29.660 --> 30:33.660
I mean, we had never been in the climate scam.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.660
It is about the same, right?

30:35.660 --> 30:40.660
We had never any public call, public scientific debate.

30:40.660 --> 30:44.660
And then usually, I mean, for example, especially the public

30:44.660 --> 30:48.660
broadcasters are the problems that that some yellow press is

30:48.660 --> 30:50.660
lying, the people can understand.

30:50.660 --> 30:53.660
But especially here in Europe, in almost every country,

30:53.660 --> 30:56.660
there are public broadcasters that are paid by us.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.660
We are obliged to pay them.

30:57.660 --> 31:01.660
And so it's, for example, one Swiss franc per day so that they

31:01.660 --> 31:04.660
are independent and they have the duty.

31:04.660 --> 31:08.660
This is even written in the law to inform us objectively as

31:08.660 --> 31:10.660
objectively as possible.

31:10.660 --> 31:15.660
And they never presented our view on this.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.660
A life pandemic, never ever.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.660
And there was never a scientific debate.

31:21.660 --> 31:25.660
Or if he asked the other side, nobody, nobody, not a single

31:25.660 --> 31:28.660
one was ever ready for a public scientific debate.

31:28.660 --> 31:33.660
Strange as hell, I mean, if you are sure to have to be right,

31:33.660 --> 31:37.660
why not engage in such a public debate?

31:37.660 --> 31:39.660
You can, you can crush the other side.

31:39.660 --> 31:40.660
Huh?

31:40.660 --> 31:41.660
If you're right.

31:41.660 --> 31:45.660
If you're wrong, maybe you risk to be destroyed.

31:45.660 --> 31:46.660
Yeah.

31:46.660 --> 31:51.660
Then, of course, I realized, yeah, you cannot fight alone.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.660
Maybe I have to state as well.

31:54.660 --> 31:58.660
Before I went to public, I mean, I was sure I was right.

31:58.660 --> 32:02.660
But I could not be only 99% sure as a doctor when I went

32:02.660 --> 32:05.660
public because if I was wrong and the tsunami had arrived,

32:05.660 --> 32:08.660
I would have been destroyed as a doctor.

32:08.660 --> 32:12.660
And at that time, I was looking for other doctors who did the

32:12.660 --> 32:13.660
same.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.660
And I found Souchari Bock.

32:15.660 --> 32:20.660
I found his video, YouTube video, where he speaks to the

32:20.660 --> 32:22.660
Chancellor Merkel of Germany.

32:22.660 --> 32:26.660
And he also Souchari, at that time, he was rather naive.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.660
It's not true.

32:28.660 --> 32:32.660
I don't want to be unkind, but he states it as well.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.660
Of course, he thought, yeah, well, I have to spread this

32:35.660 --> 32:36.660
information.

32:36.660 --> 32:39.660
And Chancellor Merkel, we don't understand it.

32:39.660 --> 32:42.660
This nonsense will be over.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.660
So we all were somewhat naive, some a little bit more,

32:45.660 --> 32:46.660
some a little bit less.

32:46.660 --> 32:50.660
For example, my kid in all my states, I was a normie until

32:50.660 --> 32:51.660
2020.

32:51.660 --> 32:55.660
So he didn't take the red pill before him.

32:55.660 --> 32:58.660
So, of course, if you didn't take the red pill before,

32:58.660 --> 33:04.660
it usually takes longer to accept, I mean, in the end,

33:04.660 --> 33:08.660
we have to accept that, obviously, our own government,

33:08.660 --> 33:12.660
even the Swiss government, here in Heidi Land, that even the

33:12.660 --> 33:19.660
Swiss government is waging war against its own populace.

33:19.660 --> 33:23.660
This is hard to believe and even harder to swallow.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.660
Yeah.

33:25.660 --> 33:30.660
And I realize, of course, that there is, for example, stage

33:30.660 --> 33:31.660
terrorism, etc.

33:31.660 --> 33:33.660
But this never happened in Switzerland.

33:33.660 --> 33:38.660
I mean, the Swiss government also corrodes into the CO2 scam,

33:38.660 --> 33:41.660
but there was never ever stage terrorism in Switzerland.

33:41.660 --> 33:44.660
So I always thought, yeah, the Swiss government, they have some

33:44.660 --> 33:45.660
limits.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.660
They won't do anything, everything.

33:47.660 --> 33:53.660
But in this COVID pandemic, they followed the orders of the

33:53.660 --> 33:56.660
powers that he has as in every other country.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.660
A lot of those powers that be are actually in your country,

33:59.660 --> 34:01.660
which kind of, I mean, how does that feel?

34:01.660 --> 34:04.660
That is exactly what I wanted to say now.

34:04.660 --> 34:05.660
Look at Switzerland.

34:05.660 --> 34:09.660
Switzerland is actually at the core of evil.

34:09.660 --> 34:14.660
I mean, all these evil organizations are located in Switzerland.

34:14.660 --> 34:20.660
And they are all granted immunity by our criminal government.

34:20.660 --> 34:24.660
So, I mean, just think about this.

34:24.660 --> 34:27.660
I should have an organization have immunity in an organization

34:27.660 --> 34:31.660
like the WHO, the World Economic Forum, the Army, etc.

34:31.660 --> 34:35.660
Why should they have immunity if they were not criminal?

34:35.660 --> 34:39.660
Why should the person that is not criminal or an organization that

34:39.660 --> 34:43.660
is not criminal, want to have immunity?

34:43.660 --> 34:45.660
Yeah.

34:45.660 --> 34:46.660
Yeah.

34:46.660 --> 34:47.660
Yeah.

34:47.660 --> 34:48.660
Yeah.

34:48.660 --> 34:49.660
Yeah.

34:49.660 --> 34:50.660
Yeah.

34:50.660 --> 34:51.660
Yeah.

34:51.660 --> 34:52.660
So no, go ahead.

34:52.660 --> 34:53.660
No.

34:53.660 --> 34:54.660
I was writing something down.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.660
I realized I cannot fight alone.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.660
I met her during Switzerland.

34:58.660 --> 35:02.660
I joined the network of doctors and scientists.

35:02.660 --> 35:07.660
Of course, I was a member of the board for sometimes there.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.660
It's called Alethea.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.660
After the Greek goddess of truth.

35:12.660 --> 35:16.660
I joined doctors for COVID ethics.

35:16.660 --> 35:21.660
And we've already mentioned was a part of this external period

35:21.660 --> 35:24.660
of the German, of the Carmen Drossman Review Report.

35:24.660 --> 35:29.660
I always also joined the German network of doctors and scientists.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.660
And to you, a great friend of mine is now, of course,

35:32.660 --> 35:34.660
Sücheri Bakhti.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.660
Actually, we had the same teacher.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.660
This is quite interesting.

35:38.660 --> 35:43.660
Sücheri is about 15 or so years older than me.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.660
He started in Bonn.

35:45.660 --> 35:50.660
And at that time, his teacher in internal medicine was the Swiss professor

35:50.660 --> 35:52.660
Walter Seagenthal.

35:52.660 --> 35:56.660
And this was absolutely the track of the differential diagnosis.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.660
This is his book in German.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.660
He wrote this book.

35:59.660 --> 36:03.660
He was in Europe, especially in German, speaking countries,

36:03.660 --> 36:08.660
but in the whole Europe, he was the crack in differential diagnosis

36:08.660 --> 36:10.660
in internal medicine.

36:10.660 --> 36:15.660
And I actually had 15 years later, the same professor.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.660
I started in Zurich.

36:17.660 --> 36:21.660
This is Dr. Seagenthal, Professor Seagenthal, the Swiss professor,

36:21.660 --> 36:27.660
that came back to Zurich because this is even a larger university than Bonn.

36:27.660 --> 36:29.660
And there also, I started.

36:29.660 --> 36:37.660
And Sücheri was one of his assistants I liked, and I was later in Zurich.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.660
This was quite interesting.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.660
He asked Sücheri whether he would join him into Switzerland,

36:42.660 --> 36:46.660
but Sücheri at that time decided to go into research.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.660
He became a microbiologist.

36:48.660 --> 36:53.660
And he asked me also to stay there, but I decided to specialize in cardiology.

36:53.660 --> 36:56.660
But this is an interesting coincidence.

36:56.660 --> 36:59.660
And this is especially what was staying out at that time.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.660
The differential diagnosis.

37:01.660 --> 37:06.660
There was no longer any differential diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.660
It was just COVID.

37:08.660 --> 37:13.660
Everything was COVID, especially acute respiratory infections.

37:14.660 --> 37:20.660
But then, of course, all other other other diagnoses were mislabeled as as

37:20.660 --> 37:23.660
COVID by these nonsense RTPs.

37:23.660 --> 37:31.660
Because theoretically, if you have one virus, if you run it at city 35 to 45,

37:31.660 --> 37:33.660
that was done.

37:33.660 --> 37:40.660
And there were studies that above 25 or 26 or so, they could not cultivate virus.

37:40.660 --> 37:45.660
It could be above 25, 26 or so.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.660
There is no even cultivable virus around.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.660
So they cannot be an infection at that city.

37:51.660 --> 37:56.660
In that city or an infection, they have maybe 15 to 20 or so city.

37:56.660 --> 38:03.660
Have you considered the possibility that with bad, let's say,

38:03.660 --> 38:09.660
over general targeting of certain motifs or, you know, certain epitopes,

38:09.660 --> 38:11.660
whatever, whatever amplicon they choose.

38:11.660 --> 38:15.660
If they didn't choose, choose an amplicon that was specific enough,

38:15.660 --> 38:20.660
they could be confounding a background signal that was always there with spread of

38:20.660 --> 38:22.660
something new.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.660
Okay.

38:24.660 --> 38:25.660
Exactly.

38:25.660 --> 38:26.660
This was the big point.

38:26.660 --> 38:32.660
As I stated, there might be a good PCR test with almost 100% specificity.

38:32.660 --> 38:38.660
But in Germany, there was a laboratory laboratory survey already in summer.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.660
2020.

38:39.660 --> 38:45.660
And that is the specificity of the common drought and RTPCR test was 98.6%.

38:45.660 --> 38:46.660
98.6%.

38:46.660 --> 38:53.660
But the specificity went down exactly as you said in the presence of other corona

38:53.660 --> 38:54.660
viruses.

38:54.660 --> 38:57.660
It went down to 92.4%.

38:57.660 --> 39:00.660
So of course, during the summer.

39:00.660 --> 39:06.660
And I think this also even I treated it again yesterday or two days ago.

39:06.660 --> 39:11.660
Even nowadays, even people who call themselves experts.

39:11.660 --> 39:17.660
Do not realize what the specificity, for example, of 99% means.

39:17.660 --> 39:19.660
What is the meaning of this?

39:19.660 --> 39:25.660
That the meaning of the specificity is highly dependent on the prevalence of the

39:25.660 --> 39:26.660
virus.

39:26.660 --> 39:31.660
So if the prevalence of the virus is zero or close to zero.

39:32.660 --> 39:37.660
All positive RTPCR tests are almost all are.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.660
A false positive.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.660
I explain it to lay people like this.

39:42.660 --> 39:50.660
If you do an RTPCR test in 10,000 males, that is 99% specifically get 100 positive

39:50.660 --> 39:51.660
tests.

39:51.660 --> 39:57.660
And because the pregnancy of prevalence in men is zero, like the prevalence of

39:58.660 --> 40:05.660
coronaviruses, beta, corona, common cold viruses in the summer is zero or close to zero.

40:05.660 --> 40:12.660
All those 100 tests, 100% of the positive test of all positives.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.660
So we saw this.

40:15.660 --> 40:17.660
May I share my screen?

40:17.660 --> 40:19.660
I have to set it.

40:19.660 --> 40:20.660
But yes, you definitely can.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.660
Let me just give a click here.

40:22.660 --> 40:26.660
Because there is really there is something.

40:26.660 --> 40:27.660
Yeah.

40:27.660 --> 40:28.660
Yeah.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.660
Yeah.

40:29.660 --> 40:30.660
Yeah.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.660
Yeah.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.

40:33.660 --> 40:36.660
I think in three to, oh, J.J.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.660
Look, our correspondent.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.660
Yeah, I think it's there.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.660
Yeah.

40:41.660 --> 40:47.660
I like this because a picture paints a thousand birds.

40:47.660 --> 40:54.660
Because if you only look at this graph, you understand that it was mainly at least an

40:55.660 --> 40:56.660
RTPCR testing pandemic.

40:56.660 --> 41:01.660
This is actually the ICU bed monitoring in Switzerland.

41:01.660 --> 41:06.660
It was done by the ETH, one of the most famous universities in Switzerland,

41:06.660 --> 41:10.660
even all over the world, especially famous also in the climate scam.

41:10.660 --> 41:14.660
There you see the ICU bed occupancy and you see the dates.

41:14.660 --> 41:18.660
And there is a black curve that is the total ICU bed occupants.

41:18.660 --> 41:22.660
I'm so around here between about 600 and 900.

41:22.660 --> 41:29.660
We always had a hump in the winter in the ICU because these are, of course, the acute

41:29.660 --> 41:37.660
respiratory infections whose worst cases must be ventilated mechanical and intensive care

41:37.660 --> 41:38.660
units.

41:38.660 --> 41:47.660
So we always had to have spare beds of about 20% to manage this hump we have in the winter.

41:47.660 --> 41:49.660
And then you see a green curve.

41:49.660 --> 41:53.660
These are the non-COVID patients and the orange curve.

41:53.660 --> 41:57.660
These are the orange, the COVID patients.

41:57.660 --> 42:01.660
And now look what happens there for example, in the summer of 2020.

42:01.660 --> 42:07.660
You had this pulse positivity rate of about 1%, about 1% of all tests were false positives

42:07.660 --> 42:12.660
corresponding to the about 99% specificity like I explained before.

42:12.660 --> 42:16.660
And then suddenly here it was in October.

42:16.660 --> 42:19.660
COVID patients arrive in the ICU.

42:19.660 --> 42:22.660
This curve goes up very steeply.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.660
And then what would you expect?

42:24.660 --> 42:31.660
So of course if COVID patients arrive, the number of myocardial infarction, strokes, victims

42:31.660 --> 42:34.660
of severe car accidents, et cetera.

42:34.660 --> 42:42.660
So the green line will continue straight like this and maybe at some time it would go down

42:42.660 --> 42:48.660
a little bit because if you postpone for example operations because you have no more

42:48.660 --> 42:50.660
ICU capacity.

42:50.660 --> 42:53.660
But we see also this curve here, the dotted line.

42:53.660 --> 42:55.660
These are the total ICU beds.

42:55.660 --> 43:02.660
They increased it at the start to 1500 beds and during the alleged pandemic of the century

43:02.660 --> 43:04.660
they already decreased it.

43:04.660 --> 43:08.660
And you see that the difference between these two curves, the dotted line at the back curve,

43:09.660 --> 43:14.660
from this you see there's never been any overcrowding of the ICUs in Switzerland of course.

43:14.660 --> 43:17.660
There has always been local overcrowding of an ICU.

43:17.660 --> 43:24.660
Of course if we have certainly 10 patients that must be ventilated due to bacterial pneumonia

43:24.660 --> 43:30.660
or if there is a car accident with 10 severely injured then of course a local ICU is overcrowded.

43:30.660 --> 43:37.660
But already as a resident I sometimes had to call for an hour to find an ICU bed for a patient.

43:37.660 --> 43:40.660
This has never always been like this.

43:40.660 --> 43:47.660
But you see what you see that at the very same moment that the orange curve goes down, the

43:47.660 --> 43:52.660
green curve goes up, the green curve goes down and it's a versa.

43:52.660 --> 43:57.660
These two curves are almost complete in mirror images.

43:57.660 --> 44:03.660
And the total number of ICU beds are part of this hump.

44:04.660 --> 44:07.660
Inlet is not unchanged.

44:07.660 --> 44:11.660
So how can you possibly explain this?

44:11.660 --> 44:21.660
So is there if this patient, the new patient arrives in the ICU, a super natural instance,

44:21.660 --> 44:24.660
probably got a lot more to call it God.

44:24.660 --> 44:29.660
He decides to postpone my car to any function, pulmonary embolism, the car accident,

44:30.660 --> 44:33.660
or is the solution not that simple?

44:33.660 --> 44:36.660
That everybody who enters the hospital is tested.

44:36.660 --> 44:43.660
If this nonsense or TPCR test I always state rolling a dice is cheaper and less invasive.

44:43.660 --> 44:48.660
And then if you are in the hospital because of my carding and fortune,

44:48.660 --> 44:52.660
after one day the test results comes in, test results comes in positive,

44:52.660 --> 44:55.660
positive, talking switch in the orange curve.

44:55.660 --> 44:56.660
This is up.

44:56.660 --> 45:03.660
This alone is 100% proof that this was mainly an RTPCR test in pandemic.

45:03.660 --> 45:11.660
I stated this since October when I saw this at that stage already.

45:11.660 --> 45:13.660
I stated this.

45:13.660 --> 45:14.660
Look at this.

45:14.660 --> 45:16.660
This alone is the proof.

45:17.660 --> 45:20.660
But at least nobody ever there to come to take me.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.660
I never got, I never lost it.

45:22.660 --> 45:26.660
I want to ask in the overtime, it became even more obvious.

45:26.660 --> 45:28.660
I mean, look at this.

45:28.660 --> 45:34.660
I want to ask a big question here because I just a hypothetical, you as a doctor,

45:34.660 --> 45:38.660
if at this stage in the pandemic, I don't know if you can see my arrow or not,

45:38.660 --> 45:43.660
but at this stage in the pandemic where you're saying that all these COVID patients show up,

45:43.660 --> 45:48.660
but then the actual number of adults that are non-COVID in the ICU plummets

45:48.660 --> 45:51.660
and that sort of mirror image all the way around here,

45:51.660 --> 45:56.660
can you imagine a sense, what would happen if all of these people who came into a hospital,

45:56.660 --> 46:02.660
diagnosed for COVID were measured in their pulse with a pulse oximeter

46:02.660 --> 46:04.660
and given supplementary oxygen?

46:04.660 --> 46:09.660
Would that do good for most of those patients or would that be a dangerous thing to do

46:09.660 --> 46:14.660
for anybody that comes in and tests positive, give them oxygen?

46:14.660 --> 46:16.660
Yes, of course.

46:16.660 --> 46:21.660
Oxygen is toxic, but in higher amounts, of course, if you're not integrated,

46:21.660 --> 46:26.660
you may not inhale that much oxygen that becomes toxic.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.660
Because we found people in America that were brought in

46:29.660 --> 46:32.660
and because there was a shortage of ventilators or whatever excuse they gave,

46:32.660 --> 46:36.660
they gave them like 10 liters of oxygen a minute through these nasal things.

46:37.660 --> 46:41.660
And then it was that that these people seemed to have dried out,

46:41.660 --> 46:46.660
and then now we need to put you on a ventilator because it's so painful.

46:46.660 --> 46:50.660
Yes, and I heard that below, if the saturation went below 90,

46:50.660 --> 46:53.660
they just as a reflex intubated them.

46:53.660 --> 46:57.660
I mean, this again is this belief in figures.

46:57.660 --> 47:02.660
You have to watch the patient, how is the patient?

47:03.660 --> 47:09.660
Maybe 85 or even lower is terrible for quite a long time or even lower.

47:09.660 --> 47:13.660
I mean, you cannot just treat the patients according to a figure,

47:13.660 --> 47:15.660
but maybe one thing I have to state.

47:15.660 --> 47:16.660
Okay.

47:16.660 --> 47:25.660
I mean, in the ICU, of course, not everybody on this orange curve

47:25.660 --> 47:27.660
at the diagnosis COVID.

47:27.660 --> 47:32.660
The problem is there was direct reporting and highly like in every country

47:32.660 --> 47:37.660
of the PCR positive PCR test results to the authorities.

47:37.660 --> 47:45.660
So the laboratories told send all positive test results to the authorities.

47:45.660 --> 47:53.660
And then they sent the results to the legacy media and they published these case numbers.

47:54.660 --> 47:59.660
The physicians, the treating physicians were not asked in this.

47:59.660 --> 48:03.660
Is these three are these patients really suffering from COVID?

48:03.660 --> 48:07.660
So this was always a huge, although a huge mistake.

48:07.660 --> 48:09.660
Also a huge mistake.

48:09.660 --> 48:14.660
Of course, the doctor must decide what to do with the diagnosis.

48:14.660 --> 48:19.660
And then he must inform the health authorities about the diagnosis.

48:19.660 --> 48:27.660
But they bypassed this by the laboratory, sending the testing results directly to the authorities.

48:27.660 --> 48:33.660
So not everybody working in the ICU was a criminal.

48:33.660 --> 48:41.660
I think they realized that not they have not that many patients, but suffering from COVID.

48:41.660 --> 48:45.660
But obviously nobody looked at this curve at this graph.

48:45.660 --> 48:46.660
I don't know.

48:46.660 --> 48:47.660
It's hard to say.

48:47.660 --> 48:54.660
But as you say, I'm sure there were people killed in the hospitals.

48:54.660 --> 48:58.660
There was mistreat, but there was also too late diagnosis.

48:58.660 --> 49:02.660
I mean, many say about we saw so many people before I clones.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.660
Well, I answered.

49:04.660 --> 49:08.660
We always had some patients with my clones always.

49:08.660 --> 49:11.660
But maybe one or much or two.

49:12.660 --> 49:14.660
Now they maybe had 10 or 20.

49:14.660 --> 49:19.660
But could the explanation not simply be what I stated before?

49:19.660 --> 49:25.660
The patients who got worse, who got bacteria, pneumonia, they didn't go to the cheap.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.660
They were told, I'll stay at home.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.660
You have COVID.

49:28.660 --> 49:30.660
We cannot help you.

49:30.660 --> 49:37.660
Go to the hospital and you are really, really close to the end of life when you have blue lips.

49:38.660 --> 49:44.660
So maybe at only at that time, maybe at the 10th, 14 or even more days.

49:44.660 --> 49:48.660
Severe bacteria, pneumonia was diagnosed too late.

49:48.660 --> 49:53.660
Maybe already with Sears, with multi organ failure and all that.

49:53.660 --> 49:59.660
So I'm quite sure that many of the alleged severe COVID patients were.

49:59.660 --> 50:04.660
It's pulmonary bacteria, pneumonia or trombo.

50:04.660 --> 50:09.660
I mean, in America, Dr. Binder, it's not treated too late.

50:09.660 --> 50:10.660
Sorry.

50:10.660 --> 50:14.660
No, Dr. Binder, in America, they said it for years on television.

50:14.660 --> 50:18.660
There are still people saying it on social media now that viral pneumonia.

50:18.660 --> 50:22.660
Viral pneumonia can't be treated with antibiotics.

50:22.660 --> 50:27.660
So these doctors have been led to believe that if the PCR dings positive,

50:27.660 --> 50:31.660
then it's a viral pneumonia, which can't respond to antibiotics.

50:31.660 --> 50:36.660
And so the whole possibility is actually off the table, which is an extraordinary.

50:36.660 --> 50:43.660
It's almost like, how can you be so incompetent as a professional to not see that shell game?

50:43.660 --> 50:45.660
I mean, but they did.

50:45.660 --> 50:47.660
This is what I stated before.

50:47.660 --> 50:50.660
It was always a duty in cases that got worse.

50:50.660 --> 50:54.660
Too different to try to differentiate as good as possible.

50:54.660 --> 50:58.660
For example, CPR is one is one of the factor.

50:58.660 --> 51:03.660
If the CPR is CPR.

51:03.660 --> 51:06.660
It's okay.

51:06.660 --> 51:13.660
If PCR is 56 years old, probably it's a viral infection.

51:13.660 --> 51:20.660
But if it's 200, 300, 400, the likelihood for a bacterial infection is always great.

51:20.660 --> 51:26.660
So it was always a duty to differentiate viral from bacterial infection,

51:26.660 --> 51:32.660
because, yeah, as your viral infections, we cannot treat only supportive risks.

51:32.660 --> 51:37.660
There are some antivirals, but this was also always amazing.

51:37.660 --> 51:40.660
They never worked really.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.660
Antibiotics work.

51:41.660 --> 51:43.660
They work really good.

51:43.660 --> 51:47.660
You can cultivate bacteria on an auger plate.

51:47.660 --> 51:52.660
You can put some antibiotics on it and you see how the bacteria are killed.

51:52.660 --> 51:55.660
This we cannot see, of course, with viruses.

51:55.660 --> 51:58.660
And all these antivirals, they do not really work.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.660
They work only the first day.

52:00.660 --> 52:10.660
These also, I mean, they applied them after 10, 14 days or so when there is usually no more viral replication,

52:10.660 --> 52:13.660
so that they cannot at that stage, they cannot work.

52:14.660 --> 52:16.660
But they gave a friend a severe, highly toxic.

52:16.660 --> 52:17.660
And there it's severe.

52:17.660 --> 52:20.660
They could not work at that stage at all.

52:20.660 --> 52:22.660
And detoxify KTP.

52:22.660 --> 52:27.660
This differential diagnosis mainly between viral and bacterial infection.

52:27.660 --> 52:30.660
Do we have to choose antibiotics or not?

52:30.660 --> 52:33.660
This usually did no longer happen.

52:33.660 --> 52:35.660
This did not happen.

52:35.660 --> 52:39.660
But it's also interesting was in the first protocols.

52:40.660 --> 52:43.660
Often there was included eritromycin.

52:43.660 --> 52:50.660
Eritromycin is a good antibiotic against community diet in pneumonia.

52:50.660 --> 52:56.660
For some years, it was the first line drug in Switzerland against community type pneumonia

52:56.660 --> 52:59.660
because it covers also my completions, for example.

52:59.660 --> 53:05.660
Nowadays, it's a moxysylin post-covalain acid.

53:06.660 --> 53:13.660
But yeah, it was also amazed that these included antibiotics and they were said to work.

53:13.660 --> 53:19.660
So maybe in the only many patients, they worked because they included an antibiotic.

53:19.660 --> 53:29.660
And the bernirocure told me that in the states, in some regions, the antibiotic prescriptions at that time,

53:29.660 --> 53:31.660
plummeted by 50%.

53:31.660 --> 53:32.660
Oh, yeah.

53:32.660 --> 53:34.660
Some places even approved.

53:35.660 --> 53:38.660
So why should there be less bacterial pneumonia than before?

53:38.660 --> 53:42.660
I didn't like it ever even more because they were diagnosed too late.

53:42.660 --> 53:43.660
Exactly.

53:43.660 --> 53:45.660
The opposite should have happened.

53:45.660 --> 53:48.660
The antibiotic prescriptions should have increased.

53:48.660 --> 53:50.660
This is not the proof for this.

53:50.660 --> 53:51.660
Yeah, absolutely.

53:51.660 --> 53:52.660
Wow.

53:52.660 --> 53:53.660
Well done.

53:53.660 --> 53:54.660
Yeah.

53:54.660 --> 54:00.660
I mean, what was also obvious very early was that there were, I mean,

54:00.660 --> 54:07.660
all I always say that during these times of total disease, that disease,

54:07.660 --> 54:12.660
the seed we have to check the only heart data and heart data is mortality,

54:12.660 --> 54:13.660
mortality.

54:13.660 --> 54:20.660
So why was there excess mortality in spring 2020 in some countries?

54:20.660 --> 54:27.660
And the very unusual shape, huge short spikes by the neighboring countries,

54:27.660 --> 54:28.660
even in neighboring countries.

54:28.660 --> 54:30.660
There was no, that's the virus.

54:30.660 --> 54:32.660
If it was reported, this may not answer.

54:32.660 --> 54:37.660
I mean, even if there is a wall between the, for example, in Canada and Canada,

54:37.660 --> 54:42.660
there was no excess mortality in spring 2020 in the USA, there was.

54:42.660 --> 54:47.660
Although there is a 8,000 or so kilometer border between those two countries.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.660
I mean, these alone also proves that the killer.

54:50.660 --> 54:56.660
That the virus may not be the killer, but the killer is our paradoxical reaction to the virus.

54:56.660 --> 55:03.660
I mean, in New York City, in New York City, we're supposed to believe in New York City that in four weeks,

55:03.660 --> 55:07.660
almost 25,000 people died.

55:07.660 --> 55:11.660
That's an extraordinary pile of bodies.

55:11.660 --> 55:13.660
And we have no evidence for it.

55:13.660 --> 55:14.660
We don't have names.

55:14.660 --> 55:16.660
We don't have graves.

55:16.660 --> 55:24.660
It's extraordinary because that story was the, the inclined plane that they used to project what was going to happen in the future.

55:24.660 --> 55:27.660
If we didn't absolutely lock down.

55:27.660 --> 55:33.660
And I think that New York City is one of these stories that was told around the world as a warning,

55:33.660 --> 55:36.660
not much different than blowing up two buildings and saying,

55:36.660 --> 55:42.660
everybody's got to take their shoes off when they get on airplanes now because terrorism in New York.

55:42.660 --> 55:49.660
I think New York City is almost, it's almost the people that have lived their long term.

55:49.660 --> 55:55.660
I've really been victimized by these repeated exercises.

55:55.660 --> 56:02.660
I think, I think in New York, New York was the, was the Bergamo of the United States.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.660
I mean, Europe had Bergamo even nowadays.

56:05.660 --> 56:09.660
If I explain all that stuff for an hour or so, what is the answer?

56:09.660 --> 56:11.660
Hey, but what is with Bergamo?

56:11.660 --> 56:12.660
Look at Bergamo.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.660
What happened in Bergamo?

56:15.660 --> 56:26.660
Well, in Bergamo, they showed, they showed videos of military lorries that transported bodies to the crematories.

56:26.660 --> 56:30.660
Is this correct in the crematory?

56:30.660 --> 56:32.660
How did this happen?

56:32.660 --> 56:38.660
Yeah, well, the Italian government in Italy, most people are Catholic.

56:38.660 --> 56:43.660
These Catholics do not want to be cremated.

56:44.660 --> 56:51.660
And so they do not have as many crematories as we have in Switzerland or probably you in the States or so.

56:51.660 --> 56:54.660
So the majority was not cremated.

56:54.660 --> 56:57.660
So they had a shortage of crematories.

56:57.660 --> 57:06.660
So they put all these coffins in a, in a, in a gym hall, in a huge gym hall.

57:06.660 --> 57:10.660
Maybe, and then of course that there were some hundred coffins or so.

57:10.660 --> 57:18.660
Then they, they filmed all this and they transported it in crematories far away.

57:18.660 --> 57:22.660
And they did not use lorries or whatever.

57:22.660 --> 57:25.660
They choose military lorries.

57:25.660 --> 57:34.660
So that they could make the people believe, I got very such a crisis that even the civil authorities cannot match in it.

57:34.660 --> 57:37.660
The military must be mobilized to do this.

57:37.660 --> 57:39.660
This is, is most of the story of Bergham.

57:39.660 --> 57:40.660
Wow.

57:40.660 --> 57:45.660
Bergham also, so, in Bergham also also found something else.

57:45.660 --> 57:58.660
In January 2020, they vaccinated 36,000 elderly people against mening or cocaine.

57:58.660 --> 57:59.660
You can Google this.

57:59.660 --> 58:00.660
It's in Italy.

58:00.660 --> 58:01.660
You found it.

58:01.660 --> 58:04.660
There are articles.

58:04.660 --> 58:13.660
And I mean, they did this at the time and there was trends around where SARS-CoV-2 was around.

58:13.660 --> 58:23.660
And maybe it was not a good idea at the time to, when, if you want to make, have a flu shot and you have a cold, the cheapy sends you home.

58:23.660 --> 58:24.660
It says come back in a week.

58:24.660 --> 58:30.660
It's not a good idea to, to vaccinate into people, vaccinate people who are already infected.

58:30.660 --> 58:39.660
So this might, and the meningococcal, the vaccine against meningococcal is rather a dangerous vaccine anyway.

58:39.660 --> 58:43.660
So maybe this could also have played a role.

58:43.660 --> 58:44.660
I don't know.

58:44.660 --> 58:46.660
But I need what I would do.

58:46.660 --> 58:55.660
I would, I would examine the more people die in Bergham or who were vaccinated that were, then were unvaccinated, for example, against meningococcal.

58:56.660 --> 59:01.660
There are, there were some hotspots where I'm not absolutely sure what happened.

59:01.660 --> 59:06.660
It is also possible that in some hotspots, they released some pathogen.

59:06.660 --> 59:12.660
Maybe even they turned on five chin and other specification or so.

59:12.660 --> 59:13.660
I don't know.

59:13.660 --> 59:18.660
EMF, EM radiation radiation is, of course, unhealthy.

59:19.660 --> 59:32.660
I mean, what was interesting, I was never attacked as strongly as when I mentioned already in April 2020, that there was a huge correlation between severe COVID cases and 5G density.

59:32.660 --> 59:38.660
But this correlation, of course, must not be causation, but it may be a hint for possible causation.

59:38.660 --> 59:43.660
There was a Spanish study in Barcelona who actually showed this correlation as well.

59:43.660 --> 59:50.660
But of course, that the cost could be that, of course, this 5G expansion is also part of the agenda.

59:50.660 --> 59:58.660
They need to brought the bandwidth to install this whole control and surveillance surveillance and control agenda.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:04.660
So this, this may be, of course, correlation without just be a coincidence.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:10.660
But, but yeah, I don't know what happened in some hotspots, maybe, but.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.660
I keep encouraging.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:17.660
Also, in spring 2020, we had no excess mortality in Switzerland.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:23.660
In Germany, they didn't have the Switzerland. This is the border to Italy.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.660
Yeah.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:39.660
I keep people, I keep encouraging people to not try to to explain what happened with one story, because if they were doing this on purpose, then they would have used lots of different means and told us it was all the same thing and when it made it even harder to figure out.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:45.660
A poignant question that we didn't get to yet at what stage in your.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:57.660
Because I tell the story on my stream that I feel like one of the big tricks of the pandemic was to fool all of us into arguing about whether this was a natural virus or a lab leak.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:03.660
So that we would all accept the idea that something very dangerous is possible and it could come again.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:12.660
And I think this was a ruse. I don't think we should have ever argued about where it came from and that whole argument wasted years and so much of our energy and time.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:20.660
And now we have children running around thinking that laboratory viruses are especially dangerous and I think that's a horrible myth to perpetuate.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:26.660
When did that come to Switzerland and what's the state of that debate now there?

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:32.660
Yes, it came immediately to Switzerland as well when it came and when it was the debate in the USA.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:36.660
I fully agree with you, of course, Jay, I fully agree with you.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.660
I mean, obviously, and proof, proof and again by the Nirokur.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.660
Obviously, there was no pandemic of a killer virus.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:50.660
And also this I stated early.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.660
If you want to understand your enemy, go in his shoes.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:02.660
If I was a psychopath who had the duty to plan such a pandemic of a killer virus.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:11.660
If I was not suicide, I would certainly not release a killer virus that could hurt or even kill me as well.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.660
Well, it is that simple.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:19.660
I would choose a comparatively harmless or even no virus.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:28.660
I must say, I'm not sure whether it was an RT-PCR testing pandemic by 95, 99 or even 100%.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.660
I'm open to this.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:37.660
I always take to 100% evidence and for the moment, the evidence for me is not enough to decide.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.660
But that's why I say the majority was an RT-PCR testing pandemic.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:50.660
But they're not completely sure whether what they're also disease called COVID produced by virus called SARS-CoV-2.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.660
I'm not 100% sure yet.

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.660
I can tell you I can give you an interesting option to add to this idea.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:05.660
Think about the possibility that we know for sure 100% sure that if they made the DNA fragment.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.660
That they knew the PCR test was specific for.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.660
They could put that DNA fragment anywhere.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:15.660
They could put it in sewers and then they could test for it and they could definitely find it.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.660
And we know we can make DNA.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:25.660
And we know that PCR when the DNA that the PCR primers are specific for is present, it will amplify it.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:37.660
So the whole signal that we're told they found could have been put there and found using the very techniques that they claim find a random pathogen going around the world.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:44.660
And I think a lot of people are unaware of how easily that actual molecular illusion could be created.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:46.660
I mean, it's not crazy technology.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:48.660
It's very straightforward molecular biology.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:54.660
If we took the spike protein DNA and spilled it on the floor in your office, it would sit there for months.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:01.660
If not years and be detectable by a PCR test years later, depending on how well you cleaned your floor.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660
I mean, that's how durable DNA would be in that context.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:05.660
There's even a paper.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:13.660
If there was no virus, even if there was no virus, if the PCR test alone, you can create 100% of all cases.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.660
In the summer, in the summer.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.660
98% score.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:22.660
It's basically the specificity 1.6% false positives.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:28.660
And as I mentioned before, 100% of all these 1.6% positives are false positives.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:37.660
And this goes went up goes up in the in the corona season that corresponds with the flu season in our northern hemisphere from November to April.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:43.660
It went down to 92.4. So, the 7.6% false positives.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.660
So this alone, even if there was absolutely no virus, if this test tested for nothing at all.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:05:00.660
We got this seasonal curve with the high case high case numbers in the flu season and the corona season and lower case numbers in the summer.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.660
This was also this was also something I realized early.

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:10.660
And what were the alleged risk factors to die from COVID?

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.660
It turned mainly the risk factors to die.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.660
And what was the average age of the people who deceased from COVID?

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:27.660
It was the risk factor of all people who at least the median age of the people today.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.660
So this is an also another hint.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:35.660
I mean, for example, in influenza, of course, influenza is more dangerous with age as well.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:40.660
But it is also dangerous for the very small children.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:46.660
If the curve goes like this, small children, it goes down and then the elderly goes off.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.660
But there it went, it went like just like this.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.660
It was not more dangerous for the young people, for the babies.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.660
Yeah.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.660
As I said, this picture paints a thousand words.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:06.660
And this understands any scientist and even any, any, every labor person.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:11.660
I mean, anybody should show give me an explanation for this mirror image of the two curves.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.660
Nobody could ever do it.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:20.660
Okay, so now it makes sense to me that Switzerland must already have pulled their head out and everybody realizes that you're right, right?

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.660
Or are you guys still absolutely?

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:30.660
Unfortunately, it's the same in Switzerland as well as, as in the US, of course, we cannot get into the legacy media.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.660
We will be here in new media, we are here in another new media.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:42.660
This evening, after this, actually, there will be a discussion about the RKI files.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.660
This is an important message.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.660
I think that many Americans have not yet heard of this.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:54.660
The RKI, the Robert Koch Institute, is the German equivalent of the CDC.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:07:01.660
And there, a group of journalists around Pauschreier is also in Twitter.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.660
They sued, they made an FOI request.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:15.660
And they struggled two years in court to get the documents of the task force who was responsible, mainly the RKI, this Robert Koch Institute,

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:21.660
who led the government and the people through these alleged crisis of the century.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.660
And what they found was amazing.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:30.660
What is published now here is amazing and it even enters legacy media in Germany.

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.660
It starts to enter the legacy media.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:34.660
I think this is really important.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:39.660
There is a tweet that my last tweet is pinned up in English.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:47.660
It's very important that this information spreads also because it was the same, of course, in each and every country.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:57.660
For example, in spring, that the RKI found that this is not a specially dangerous virus.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:02.660
And then there is written that person that is redacted.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:10.660
This FOI, this release, these are more than 1000 pages, but they are heavily still, heavily, heavily redacted.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:18.660
And then a person from the outside decided we have to upgrade the dangerousness of the virus. We have to upgrade it.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.660
Yeah.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.660
This is just another example there in tune.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:34.660
The case numbers, even those those fake case numbers went down because in tune, there is no corona viruses around.

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:40.660
So in tune, even in tune, they sold us and I guess to you in the States as well.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.660
They sold this.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.660
They still stated it's highly dangerous. There is a highly dangerous virus around.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:53.660
It's high still high risk. They made the people believe they gaslighted the people into believing that even in the summer.

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:58.660
They have to bear mosques at 50 degrees, 40 degrees Celsius.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:06.660
And then there is no corona virus when there is only these 1% for positive taste.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:17.660
And there is written in these files, but they decided not to downgrade the level of dangerousness.

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:29.660
And that this was, this was prescribed by the, this was by the federal ministry of health, the German federal ministry of health.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:41.660
There you see exactly how the politicians told scientists, the federal, the health authorities, what to do and what to release.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:56.660
For example, there is written yet that the case numbers go down. We cannot write. So person X, Y, redacted has the duty to find another formulation for these that the case numbers go down.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:06.660
This is really, this is amazing. And I think this, at least in Germany, it gets traction in the, in the legacy media.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:15.660
And yeah, I think it's important that we also inform the people in the English speaking countries and all over the world about this.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:23.660
Absolutely. And the flip side of that or the mirror of that in America. And I think it was October and November of 2020.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:31.660
Rochelle Walensky and a couple other people went on TV with a zoom with like three windows in it.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:39.660
And they told us that for the unvaccinated, we could look forward to a winter of severe disease and death.

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:49.660
They actually said those words for the unvaccinated. You can expect a winter of severe disease and death. That's spectacular.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:59.660
Oh, yeah, it's okay. They pulled no punches. They said, and they pulled absolutely no punches at all.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:14.660
So do you have a sort of closing thing like what are your plans? What are you doing? How are you, I mean, have you kind of resigned to wait until people wake up? I mean, are we still fighting? What do we do now? I don't, I don't know other than I'm trying to

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:19.660
teach the biology and spend time with people that want to learn it.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:23.660
Stuff that I was teaching already a few years ago, I'm starting to teach again.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:31.660
But I still feel like an awful lot of people are running around convincing us that this is something that happened and that's going to happen again.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:40.660
And so we need to elect the right people and enact the right laws. And I'm having the feeling that none of these things are the right thing to do.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:50.660
So, I don't know how to encourage people other than one person at a time to try and like pull people out of this.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:57.660
But where are you at with that? What's your plans going forward? What are you doing now?

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:06.660
I'm somewhat tired of the four years, of course, gathering always the same again and again, and I tried to explain it as short as possible.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:12.660
For example, years ago, I treated the test is the past and all these stuff like this and stuff.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:18.660
Yeah, I mean, I think the people have to realize two basic things first.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.660
It was an RTP CR testing pandemic, or mainly it was.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:38.660
Because, and I also tell the people, I guess you know this, but look, if you do not believe me, read the New York Times article under the title Faith in Quick Test leads to epidemic that was that wasn't.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:58.660
That was published in 2007, Faith in Quick Test leads to pandemic epidemic, that wasn't that they described another edge to be of pandemic in New Hampshire in 2006, where they tasted 142 people positive for produces with a PCR test.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:05.660
And then in bacterial culture, none of them, none of them, not a single one was positive in the bacterial culture.

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:13.660
So this was a 100% PCR testing epidemic. But this, this, this is exactly what they did here.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:21.660
And I think, I mean, people who say, Oh, well, conspiracy theories, this was this appeared in the New York Times, New York Times.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:25.660
In 2007, I can recommend it.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.660
Did you know it?

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:34.660
One of my viewers already had the link in the chat before I could find it. I just found it now. That's really extraordinary.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.660
It's really extraordinary.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:52.660
And there are quotes, they quote, in fact, geologists and epidemiologists. And for example, one quote was something like this, that the most amazing for him was that he said that everything we did was so sensible at the time.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:14:05.660
Everything is written there. Everything that the people are living in this belief system. If you are in the belief system, obviously, it looks somewhat consistent. I have hard to.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:15.660
I have problems to believe it, but for them, it looks somewhat consistent. And they believe it like the climate scientists who are living in this climate scan, of course, they live in the belief.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:24.660
If you are both in this context of the illusion, you cannot see or if you are part of the system, you cannot see.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:41.660
You must also always take the outside perspective. These, for example, is important that the Westerners must, of course, watch Russia today, for example, to become an outside perspective on us.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:15:01.660
I mean, there is the US Empire was first British Empire, then it became the US Empire. And honestly, I mean, the current, the currently ruling Empire is always the most evil party, because if not, it would not be the Empire.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:17.660
Also, this we Westerners must realize, hey, we were not always the good guys, or rather the contrary. It is not these alleged Muslims who brought the World Trade Centers up in the air. It's rather us the problem.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:34.660
These are the such insights, really, they hurt. They hurt, of course, you turn into you. When you when you have these insights, you talk about, yeah, after some times, after some times you advance.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:48.660
And we have to overcome ideology, ideology, let's forget, try to forget ideology, just look at the reality as soberly as possible, whether we like the result or not, whether it is like it.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:16:01.660
And I think I think you and me, we are curious by nature, we became scientists, we are interested in the reality, but even even if you don't like it, we must accept it is the reality.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:06.660
And I always use the nature of both those caves. I think this is really good.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:16.660
Most people are living in Plato's cave, and on the walls, they are is no longer that the shadow of the science projected on the walls.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:35.660
But there is a huge flat screen, the legacy media project, different virtual realities on this flat screen, and 11 reality, the CO2 reality, the Ukraine reality, the pandemic reality, virtual reality, and the people are sitting there and they believe it.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:48.660
And it causes our duty once we have realized there is an exit that leads to the sun, right, that we have to go back in this cave, whether we like it or not, and try to explain those people.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:55.660
Hey, guys, there is an exit outside. There is the sun and 98 of the people outside are good, great people, nice people.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:09.660
It's only 2% psychopaths, or I prefer to call them malignant severe narcissists, then you have not the debate or the sociopath psychopaths, whatever, they are evil people without conscience, without knowing, without empathy, without the most.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:18.660
Those are the guys who are always through the empathetic humanity, they are wearing crowns in ancient times.

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:29.660
Nowadays, they have billions in their pockets, and there is even a multi-trillion layer level above them that is not even known publicly.

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:33.660
I mean, who is the richest guy? Currently, I guess it's Elon Musk.

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:37.660
Now, what is with the Rothschilds and the Rockefeller family?

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:45.660
They were the richest families for centuries, and they suddenly disappeared, did they suddenly published?

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:53.660
Oh, these are, of course, there is a multi-billionaire level, and these are on the multi-trillionaire level, and the multi-billionaires are the front men.

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:58.660
For example, Elon Musk is the front man for the whole technical aspect of a chain.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:12.660
The 2030 or great resets or one health that is basically all the same, and then Gates is the front man for the pandemic myths, and they play a search and all.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:20.660
These are the front men, these are the leading personnel of the ruling trillionaire psychopaths.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.660
And yeah, we have to try that.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:30.660
But someday I become quite desperate, but there is also hope.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:37.660
For example, in Switzerland, we could vote three times that there was a referendum about the COVID law.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.660
The COVID law gave the executive branch.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:47.660
These powers, these executive powers were in an authoritarian regime.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.660
The parliament was all of us.

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:56.660
For silent state, they took them out themselves by running away and putting on Musk and telling it's too dangerous when we meet.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.660
And so, and this happened also in every country.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.660
So, oh, now I lost.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.660
I'm blathering a little bit.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:05.660
No, no, not at all.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.660
What did I want to say?

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.660
What did I try to say?

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.660
You were telling a story, but you just started it.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.660
He had three referendums.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:25.660
And although the maturity voted for the COVID law, so for these insane measures, by about 64%.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:34.660
The youngest people, between 18 and 35, they rejected the COVID law by 56 or so percent.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.660
This gives me hope.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660
Yes.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.660
Well, we old guys, I'm a dinosaur, almost.

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.660
Sometimes we say, oh, the young people, it's not the same as it was.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:50.660
No, this is, this is one hope of the young people, because, yeah, well, it's clear.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:56.660
The young people, they informed themselves in other sources in the internet.

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.660
They do not longer longer.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.660
Let people bought it by a new state.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.660
They are not interested.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:08.660
They do it with active search for, for, to get the wrong chances they want to have.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:19.660
And another hope is that although everybody was, was propagating these chaps that, of course, are unnecessary, negative, effective, and life-threatening.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:25.660
But I think everybody who is listening here knows this, so we have no two to repeat it.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.660
But almost nobody takes these chaps now in Switzerland.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.660
The vaccination rate now is close to zero.

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:41.660
And I think even in the USA, where the CDC still recommends chaps to even, even to children and even to pregnant women.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:49.660
I mean, to recommend these to pregnant women, this was the first crime in this, in this insanity, in this genocide.

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:55.660
But this, this means that the people still realize, even if they do not agree.

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.660
And so still, they do not no longer take the last step.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.660
I think they have realized it.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:04.660
And that important things are, first, it was a testing pandemic.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:15.660
This is the recipe for the, for the WHO to fabricate any testing pandemic against any disease X at will.

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:20.660
According to the same recipe with a nonsense RTP, PCR or RTP statistics.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:35.660
And this, of course, is important now that David, that WHO wants to have global power that is above the constitution of every country with the new international health regulations and the pandemic agreement.

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:44.660
And the second important message is that it is not mainly the spike and the lipid normal particles that makes the toxicity of this.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.660
My RNA vaccine platform.

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.660
Of course, those two are toxic as well.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:57.660
But it is mainly the basic sin that every medical student learns in immunology.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:03.660
In the first lecture, maybe in the second, what is the basic duty of our immune system?

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.660
It is to recognize nonsense.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:09.660
So this was the basic sin.

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:19.660
If we, if we do achieve therapy, for example, for proper people that I don't know, do not produce enough insulin or so.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:23.660
Then this is a protein of our own body.

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:24.660
This may work.

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:31.660
But if we inject the construction plan for a protein foreign to the body.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:39.660
And this enters any body cell, even transfers is the blood brain barrier in the presentable area.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:43.660
And there it produces the foreign protein.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:51.660
It is a sales express and then present the foreign body protein and fragments of it on their surface.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.660
They are recognized as known cells.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.660
The white blood cells are policing around.

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.660
They see these cells carrying a foreign protein.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.660
They think this is an aid.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.660
We attack it.

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:09.660
And I think this is all also clear because what if the leaping on the part because made the main toxicity.

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.660
I think it would be very sharp.

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.660
The toxicity would rise more or less linearly.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:22.660
If it was the spike, the toxicity should even go down with any every shot because there are more and more neutralizing antibodies.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:30.660
But if it is dissolved immune attack, of course, the immune system is trained ever more by egg shot.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:41.660
So that also did the dangerousness of the of the of the of this platform increases exponentially with every shot.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.660
This was also shown by the neural curve.

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:52.660
The dangerousness increases exponentially with age about twice every five years.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.660
And with those if every dose.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:00.660
And he made this case in the book that was made not that hero, mainly Michael Palmer wrote it.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.660
You know, it's DNA of mRNA toxicity.

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:12.660
You can download it for free or from our website doctors for COVID ethics.org.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:21.660
And I think that there we also presented the book of the report card for the first pathologies to examine the job to victims and all this.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:41.660
So the people must realize that the problem is not only these vaccines, but that the whole modified RNA vaccine platform must be forbidden must be banned because this basic toxicity will be the same.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:50.660
Whether we produce a foreign antigen that is part of influence of source coffee to Corona whatsoever.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:56.660
This basic toxicity will is to expect from a whole platform.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:00.660
So do never ever accept not all.

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:18.660
There's a really good story that goes along with this that the mirror of what you said with regard to self and non self somebody who has low amounts of insulin is still producing insulin.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.660
So it's still a protein that is a self protein.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:29.660
The original example of this technology rolled out with a denovirus is this guy Jesse Gelsinger in the early 2000s.

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:33.660
He was missing a protein and enzyme in his liver.

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:45.660
And so it was not a self protein they put that enzyme back in his liver and for about three weeks he was fine until the autoimmune response hit and then his had catastrophic liver failure and died.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:51.660
And so it is exactly the same thing here. It doesn't matter what protein you choose. I've been saying it for a while too.

01:25:51.660 --> 01:26:05.660
I'm really happy that you zeroed in on that because the circular DNA that's been found in the shots is an added toxicity and an added danger that doesn't in any way preclude the already dumb idea of transfecting people.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.660
So I'm really happy that you mentioned that.

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:19.660
How can you explain me? Can you explain me? How did scientists not all scientists like you? Not all doctors like me, not immediately realized this.

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.660
I mean, I stated this before.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:29.660
I was interested in how can it stay in the muscle?

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:46.660
How can it only transfect the muscle? So I was looking for a receptor, obviously, for non-particles that makes them only enter the skeletal muscle cell.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:51.660
And in December 2020, I must head to state that there is not, there is not.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:27:00.660
So these three non-particles are deliberately chosen to enter any body cell, even the brain and the embryos embryonic cells.

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:14.660
This is absolute proof of intention to harm. I mean, there are many stupid guys around, of course, but some people in some key positions must have known exactly what they do.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:24.660
I mean, not everybody who was involved in the production of the research, then in the production can be solved, so dumb. I mean, so, yeah.

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.660
Oh, you said it. I'm so happy you said it. I mean, I almost want to end it there because that's really how I feel.

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:42.660
This was criminally negligent. There were people who knew they knew because they've been using it. They've been rolling it out on cancer patients. They've been using it in very strict contexts and they've always known.

01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:53.660
We've been using it. This is my argument. We've been using it in mice for years and years and years and all of those mice need to be sacrificed because if you let the transfection go, the immune response is devastating.

01:27:53.660 --> 01:28:04.660
We always knew that. And it was shocking to me when I talked to my colleagues and they just didn't understand that we were about to transfect our grandparents and then our children.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:13.660
Can I, I'm going to let you go because I know you have another show coming up and you probably need a break and I've already taken an hour and a half, maybe five or ten minutes, that is just one thing.

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.660
Yes, please go ahead, of course.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.660
But also every lay person can understand.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:27.660
As I said, we inject the construction plan for the production of a forum, a protein to the body.

01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:37.660
This is a pro drug without having any control over which cells will express it in what amount and for how long.

01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:50.660
People were out there. In the 16th century, they leave the guy called parazelsus and already he knew in the 16th century, it's the dose that makes something a poison or not the poisoned.

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:59.660
So already, because the individual effective dose, the little produced expressed excess effective dose was unknown.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:09.660
It would be reason that this vaccine platform should never have been approved this alone, even if you have no idea about anything.

01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:19.660
I mean, would anybody take a sleeping pill where you don't know if it's it's a physiological dose or 100 times more.

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:32.660
I'm playing Russian roulette with such a sleeping pill. No, and we play you play Russian roulette with this. And another thing is, I explain it like a shotgun.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:36.660
It just destroys a certain amount of sales.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:46.660
Maybe in some people, only in 100% in another one, one in 1000 in some people, mainly the sales of one or in another one more diffusely.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:51.660
And the problem is the diagnostic problem is, for example, in the heart.

01:29:51.660 --> 01:30:03.660
We can see myocarditis in MRI, if about one gram of heart muscle is affected. The heart is a base about 300 grams about one gram, we can see.

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:09.660
But this is a localized damage. Problem is, this damage is diffused.

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:19.660
So if you do not destroy this one 300 parts, it localized, but diffusing the heart won't see anything in MRS.

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:30.660
This, we can only diagnose if you have a sensitive specific marker for myocardial cell damage and this, luckily, we have a bit of a sculpture pony in T&I.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:35.660
But why can we diagnose so many myocarditis close chopped?

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:39.660
Yeah, we have this marker for myocardial damage.

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:46.660
I'm absolutely sure if you had the same sensitive and specific markers for grain damage, liver cell damage, etc.

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:55.660
You would find about the same amount of subclinical or damages of those organs as well.

01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:00.660
It's mostly the myocarditis can be most easily diagnosed. You can diagnose it.

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:04.660
To a pony, you can measure within 15 minutes in your practice.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:11.660
You have to resolve what we have, not such a marker for diffuse damage in an organ, but it is this shotgun.

01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:15.660
It kills a cell here, a cell here, a cell here. It's not localized damage.

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:25.660
Localized damage, you can see in the imaging, with imaging techniques, pulmonary embolies and myocardial infarction, myocarditis, things like this,

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:38.660
but diffuse damage is difficult. The same is if this dual diffuse activation of agglutination thrombosis, the activation of blood clotting in the smaller vessels.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:47.660
We cannot see it with imaging techniques. We can only measure it, and then also we have not that specific, but quite specific,

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:52.660
and quite sensitive test to measure blood clotting, which is called D-dimer.

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:59.660
This is one of the first things we realized. We have to measure D-dimer in the people suffering from vaccine injury,

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:04.660
and I found many patients with diffuse symptoms that had elevated D-dimer.

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:11.660
This is not in every patient, but this is something that many do not realize.

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:22.660
It's probably got something to do with the fact that a long time ago, these lipid nanoparticle people already knew that platelets and the liver were the two primary places that it went.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:40.660
I can only thank Heaven that you and maybe as crazy as it is, the guy who more or less discovered the complement system, had he not been on our team.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:45.660
It's crazy to me how many doctors I talk to have no idea what the complement system is.

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:49.660
Never mind understand how that cascade might go wrong in this context.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:59.660
Having sukred on our team was really, it's a miracle. If he wouldn't have been there, I don't know of anybody else who would have come to that conclusion on their own.

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:07.660
I would not have, and it's a really, I consider it really one of the main diamonds in our crown right now.

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.660
Had we not had him, boy, we would have been lost.

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:20.660
And had you guys not had the same teacher, maybe you guys wouldn't have found each other. I mean, it's all very, it's very much a network of people that we need to amplify.

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:25.660
He actually told us, he actually told us, you have to care for the patient.

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:32.660
You have to follow the interest of the patient, not the interest of someone else or of yourself.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.660
You have to follow, you have to serve to the patient.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:51.660
This also happened to me, have not to serve to have an authority to totally insane politician who has no idea, not the slightest idea what he's talking about tells us positions.

01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.660
How we have to treat the flu.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.660
I mean, how insane is this?

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.660
So this is good.

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:01.660
This good teacher was named Walter Segan Hallers.

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.660
Walter, Walter, Segan Teller.

01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.660
Awesome.

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:06.660
Segan Teller.

01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:07.660
This is his book.

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:08.660
Perferential Diagnosis.

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:16.660
This is from when I studied from 1993, actually, but yeah.

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:17.660
Very good.

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:18.660
Well, let's dedicate this.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.660
We very learned something, and I always liked it.

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:23.660
I was always, as I said, curious.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:27.660
I was always that I liked to the work of a detective.

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:28.660
I like Colombo.

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:30.660
Colombo was a great detective.

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.660
And he was a narcissist post.

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.660
Can you remember?

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:53.660
Always these blown up narcissists with their arrogance and ignorance and they thought, oh, well, this little inspector, if he's an old coder, he could never do we any harm.

01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:01.660
And this is the same nowadays at the height of an age of narcissism that started in the 1970s.

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:06.660
Of course, all positions of powers are occupied by severe narcissists.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:08.660
And above them, the severe memory of the narcissist.

01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:11.660
I mean, look like look at these politicians.

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:12.660
The Boris Johnson or so.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660
He even looks like it.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.660
Like he's not the only clan.

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.660
He looks like a clown and then me.

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.660
Yeah.

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:28.660
This is, we are living in crazy times, but I quite sure we are at the end of this age of narcissism.

01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.660
And we have to return into the age of authenticity.

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:34.660
This is the most important people hate most of you.

01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:36.660
We are great people.

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:42.660
We are kind people and pathetic people come down to empathy to authenticity.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.660
We must live in reality.

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.660
We live in Plato's cave in virtual reality someday.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.660
We will collide with reality for sure.

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.660
And this might be the end of the whole humanity.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.660
This might be in the end in a nuclear war or so.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:02.660
I mean, the French president, Macron, they are seriously talking about French soldiers.

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:12.660
There are already some, but they are openly debating about the possibility of a war of

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:17.660
the NATO between us, NATO and Russia that would end in a nuclear war.

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:22.660
I mean, when I was young, you could not even imagine that there could be a nuclear war

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.660
if it was not an act by accident.

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:30.660
But nowadays they are even talking about the possibility of a nuclear war.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.660
I mean, how insane and evil are those people?

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:34.660
Yeah.

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:35.660
Yeah.

01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:41.660
Just and as you say, you stated in the very beginning, you stated as almost over everybody

01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.660
called it, there will be no savior, of course.

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.660
We must all realize the savior is in us all.

01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.660
And the only thing, the only remedy for this is civil disobedience.

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:56.660
If they come up and put on the mask saying no, they can do a job saying no.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.660
Just saying no.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:02.660
If enough people say no, this is their end.

01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.660
This is their end.

01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:08.660
So it's, as you said, we can spread the information and make us immediate.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:12.660
But of course, we're in the new media, but we stay in this bubble.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.660
And I also think in the personal context, we must try to educate the people.

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:28.660
And one thing we have to consider always, we must make our information suits, the information state of the people.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:36.660
There are people around to still believe every word they see on here in the news is right.

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:42.660
This is like a child that is believing in the Christ child, the Easter Bunny and the Santa Claus.

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:49.660
And those in those, if you come from those people, if the whole reality as we have perceived it by now,

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:53.660
I would never dare to say, I know the reality or the reality.

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.660
I know that I do not know the most important thing.

01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:04.660
But if you come from them with all these, they refuse, they refuse, I often hear, I can try to educate someone for an hour.

01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:09.660
And at the end of this hour, he says, well, it sounds somewhat reasonable.

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:12.660
But I simply refuse to believe this.

01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:17.660
I simply refuse to believe that such evil people even can exist.

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.660
Hey, come on.

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:21.660
There was heat, that there was more, or there was darling.

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:25.660
Do you seriously believe they have all died that nowadays?

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.660
They call gates the force.

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:31.660
Yeah, you have to realize this.

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:37.660
And for those people, it's a good idea just to start with spreading some birds.

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:39.660
We cannot educate them.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.660
They have to educate themselves.

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:51.660
For example, one thing I will always remember when my son was young, when the Santa Claus had left one time,

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.660
he told me, hey, Papa, beat the Santa Claus.

01:38:56.660 --> 01:39:03.660
Not where the same shoes, like uncle, horse, horse is Swiss.

01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:13.660
Well, who left before Santa Claus came in and came in after Santa Claus had left?

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:14.660
Stop.

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.660
This is how enlightenment works.

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.660
Yes.

01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:22.660
Also, you and me, I saw a bird train center building seven collapse.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.660
I thought, oh, my God.

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.660
I thought he's wrong in his story as well.

01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:29.660
And then I became curious.

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:31.660
And I was not afraid.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:38.660
I went down the rabbit hole and this everybody must do on his current level of information or another possibilities.

01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.660
For example, you can spread that.

01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:48.660
For example, in Switzerland, there was the papers wrote that is overcrowding of the Swiss ice use.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:54.660
But if you look at the same date that these curve of the official curve of the federal office of public.

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.660
So there is no overcrowding.

01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:01.660
The occupancy of the ice use is 75% and the same papers.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.660
Five years ago wrote an article.

01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:06.660
It's occupancy in Switzerland.

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:09.660
I see occupancy only 80%.

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.660
This is an economic.

01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.660
This is too low.

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:15.660
So if you show them something like this.

01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:21.660
Sometimes you can spread some doubt that maybe then people start to think.

01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:26.660
I'll show that I really believe the yellow press or that this is the federal office of public health.

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.660
Something like this.

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:29.660
It must work like this.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:35.660
So we have also if you meet some people, they must always realize first,

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:40.660
find out what is the current state of information and then.

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.660
A child started the kind of education to the level of it.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660
I think that's great advice.

01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:47.660
Find out where people are and meet them there.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.660
I think is really a great way to try and meet more people.

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.660
I think it's great.

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:54.660
I can't thank you enough for spending time with me this afternoon.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.660
And I hope we can stay in touch and I can have you on again because I think.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.660
I think this network needs to vibrate.

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:07.660
We need to keep promoting one another and keeping it and my stream is just starting to grow now.

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.660
So I have a feeling there will be more ways for me to connect you with other people.

01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.660
So I'm going to promote your.

01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:16.660
You don't have a sub stack.

01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:19.660
Do you just have a Twitter and you do your thing?

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.660
I have Twitter and homepage.

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:23.660
It's a lousy homepage.

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.660
I have to create it once overnight.

01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.660
And then everybody was vanished.

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:31.660
But it's called Thomas Binder in wonder.

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:34.660
Thomas Binder dot CHCH is for Switzerland.

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:37.660
Thank you, Jay.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:42.660
You do a famous fantastic work as well.

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:45.660
I mean, you are amazing, of course.

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.660
I mean, it was an honor that you invite me here.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:49.660
So please.

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.660
Yeah.

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.660
Well, thanks.

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:52.660
I really appreciate it.

01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660
Continue like this.

01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.660
Yeah.

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:58.660
It's everybody does what he and she can and.

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:02.660
I always state people, please.

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:05.660
Do not only wake up to also stand up.

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.660
Give your spine a booster.

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:09.660
I told ones, give your spine a booster.

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:15.660
And if you do it, not if you resist, not for yourself, please do it for.

01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:20.660
Life worth living for your children and grandchildren.

01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:26.660
I mean, I had the good life after war in the western world, of course, almost everybody

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:28.660
had quite the good life.

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:32.660
But what is the future for the younger generations?

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:36.660
I mean, I'll show there would be slaves.

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:40.660
I prefer to be dead than to be a slave.

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.660
What about they want to have in 2013?

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:46.660
They always say, I was never afraid.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.660
I sometimes dated.

01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:53.660
Well, if you want to shoot me, just shoot me still from the front that I can look into your eyes.

01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.660
And this is what they are afraid of.

01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:58.660
If you are not afraid, they have a problem.

01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:04.660
Because they're gaslighting mainly those over panicking the popular servers.

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:05.660
By panicking the pockets.

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:09.660
If you are not afraid, it's a large progress.

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:12.660
And also in this COVID scam.

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:17.660
I'm absolutely convinced that people sometimes died from from panic alone,

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:20.660
or at least it exaggerated the state.

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:25.660
I have a friend who told me he has a friend.

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.660
He had a sore throat.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.660
He got the PCR test result.

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.660
And he suddenly turned pale.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.660
Trembles started to tremble.

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.660
And he got these results.

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:39.660
And three months, three weeks later, he died in the ICU.

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:44.660
I see many people who have such experience, made such experience.

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:47.660
Panic is not good for your health.

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:53.660
Not especially when you see the whole world panicking and everyone around you.

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.660
This was terrifying.

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:55.660
And they did it.

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.660
They really did it to us.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660
We got to wake that up.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.660
We got to wake young people up.

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:03.660
I think that's the people we want to get at.

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.660
Because if we turn to them as older adults and say,

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:10.660
hey, by the way, we blew it a little bit and something we should have spoke up.

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.660
We should have stood up for you.

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:15.660
There's a possibility we can still pull them out of the cave.

01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:17.660
You're still young.

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:18.660
I'm old.

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:19.660
You're young.

01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:20.660
Okay.

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:21.660
Well, I'm still young and I got lots of work to do that.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:22.660
Thank you very much.

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.660
Enjoy your.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:24.660
I hope you have a great presentation tonight.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.660
Thank you very much.

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:26.660
And I will see you again soon.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.660
I promise.

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.660
Thank you.

01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:29.660
Have a good time.

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:30.660
Happy Easter.

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.660
Bye bye.

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.660
Happy Easter.

01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:33.660
Wow.

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:34.660
Fantastic.

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.660
That is just absolutely fantastic.

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.660
I don't know what to say other than that.

01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:46.660
This has been giga ohm biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:50.660
And I'm going to wrap it up right there because I don't need to do anything else.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.660
Thank you to Thomas Binder for being on the show.

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:53.660
Thank you guys for joining me.

01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.660
Please share the stream.

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.660
I'm going to leave it up on YouTube.

01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.660
If they give me a strike, I've got I've got an extra one.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.660
And I don't know.

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.660
Let's see what they do.

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.660
I love you guys all very much.

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:07.660
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.660
If you want to share this work.
