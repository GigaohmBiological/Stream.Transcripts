WEBVTT

00:13.429 --> 00:13.552
Bye.

00:56.698 --> 01:04.544
Heartbeats with a silent courage Hitting the test by you if I should leave

01:34.536 --> 01:38.387
I can see that destiny is slow

03:03.617 --> 03:10.679
Clasp around your finger Double under deep blue sea

05:21.363 --> 05:25.167
you can tell if someone's lying, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:26.949 --> 05:27.669
And I have lied.

05:27.690 --> 05:28.731
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:28.751 --> 05:29.671
I don't want to lie.

05:29.692 --> 05:31.513
I don't think I'm a liar.

05:31.613 --> 05:32.654
I try not to be a liar.

05:32.674 --> 05:33.535
I don't want to be a liar.

05:34.096 --> 05:36.859
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

05:38.781 --> 05:39.581
When he introduced

05:40.680 --> 05:59.234
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

06:00.355 --> 06:08.802
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is going to get a chance to comment

06:12.537 --> 06:21.245
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone.

06:22.306 --> 06:25.429
It's measles plus.

06:25.529 --> 06:31.054
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

06:31.354 --> 06:33.316
It's just a big hassle in the end.

06:35.313 --> 06:40.197
No, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality.

06:40.217 --> 06:49.625
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of this flu.

06:49.725 --> 06:52.247
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

06:52.267 --> 06:58.372
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

06:58.732 --> 07:04.817
I'm afraid that the latest data... Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

07:05.339 --> 07:07.121
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

07:09.123 --> 07:09.884
Isolation, what was it?

07:10.044 --> 07:11.285
Isolation and purification.

07:12.987 --> 07:13.728
Of the virus?

07:13.808 --> 07:14.028
Yes.

07:15.249 --> 07:17.031
Well, you isolate a virus by

07:23.832 --> 07:26.294
finding the virus which causes a disease.

07:26.955 --> 07:31.840
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.642
I don't understand what the issue.

07:34.763 --> 07:40.208
Well, they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

07:41.309 --> 07:42.470
No, it depends on how they used it.

07:42.890 --> 07:43.171
Okay.

07:43.991 --> 07:46.153
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

07:49.298 --> 07:51.240
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

07:51.300 --> 07:53.602
I mean, he actually isolated it, so.

07:53.622 --> 07:57.345
I mean, why should I do all of this?

07:57.425 --> 07:59.427
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

08:40.323 --> 08:43.129
The End

09:00.589 --> 09:01.509
Good morning, everybody.

09:01.629 --> 09:04.550
It's 11.05 on the 11th of July, 2024.

09:05.211 --> 09:09.232
We're here again with GigaOM Biological.

09:09.812 --> 09:11.993
I agree, kids need some more Mr. Rogers.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.094
They need that this time.

09:14.034 --> 09:18.836
That little cat cartoon that they've substituted for Mr. Rogers is not a good substitute.

09:20.856 --> 09:29.940
Yeah, we're trying to break the enchantment one day at a time here, and I had the opportunity to finally hook up with a guest that I've been

09:31.212 --> 09:35.594
I've been trying to follow, but he puts out a lot of stuff.

09:35.634 --> 09:36.394
He's written books.

09:36.974 --> 09:44.677
And I'm just now sort of waking up to how lost I've really been my whole adult life.

09:45.277 --> 09:52.159
And so no matter what you think you've seen through before COVID, chances are you haven't seen through all of it.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.440
And that goes for everybody.

09:54.500 --> 09:59.762
I mean, really just insane, really, how that holds for everybody.

10:01.658 --> 10:19.167
know there's they've been competing for our consciousness for a long time and it's not just this stuff about COVID and even to a certain extent you could see our continued focus exclusively on the biology of the pandemic is somewhat limiting our ability to really reject

10:19.907 --> 10:26.329
all of the changes that they are planning and have planned and are executing and are going forward with.

10:26.909 --> 10:32.770
And that's one of the reasons why the guest yesterday that we had on was so interesting to talk to.

10:32.791 --> 10:42.293
I'm not sure if we were able to follow everything, but I know that there's a lot more material out there, including his book to read.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.413
So that was David Webb.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.174
And then, you know,

10:46.254 --> 10:57.637
Today, I think I'm going to at least be able to ask a few questions that I've wanted to ask ever since the red pill and ever since meeting G. Edward Griffin.

10:58.338 --> 11:01.338
And so I'm really curious as to how this interview is going to go.

11:03.619 --> 11:12.322
I just want to kind of get through the introduction, make sure that anybody who hasn't been here before understands what we're all about, what we're trying to achieve.

11:13.422 --> 11:31.268
It's a kind of, it's a kind of scramble for the exits and trying to grab as many books as possible on the way out so that we can maybe raise our kids outside of this mythology that all of these charlatans

11:32.388 --> 11:55.325
um all of all of these charlatans have have foisted upon us and and and are are sort of more or less coercing us into teaching our children and so in order to take this power back we're gonna have to teach our children something else and as we do that hopefully we can make gentle the life of this world rather than have it you know go wherever they probably plan to have it go

11:56.784 --> 12:05.592
One of the key things that I think is to do here is to teach our children to see how this illusion of consensus on social media about everything.

12:06.773 --> 12:12.618
I'm sure there are people like Dan Cohen and maybe even the guest for today can tell us how

12:13.399 --> 12:25.584
how many different or name a long list of things, concepts, stories in history that are essentially an illusion of consensus about what the right questions are to ask.

12:26.104 --> 12:29.166
I'm sure you could characterize World War I and World War II this way.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.068
And it goes on and on.

12:32.088 --> 12:33.529
And so that's why I'm really excited today.

12:33.549 --> 12:39.454
We're not necessarily going to stay focused on the biology, but we are still going to try not to take their bait on social media.

12:39.494 --> 12:41.096
We still are going to love our neighbor.

12:41.136 --> 12:47.661
This is a message from an American to America, but also in solidarity with the rest of the world.

12:48.662 --> 12:50.163
to whom these lies were told.

12:50.883 --> 12:54.925
And if you can't do anything else but share, please do it.

12:55.425 --> 13:01.047
That's the best way to support the stream because that's how this biology gets to more people every week.

13:01.887 --> 13:06.429
Share the stream via stream.gigaohm.bio because that's the website that we pay for.

13:06.469 --> 13:16.813
You can download a lower resolution version of the videos very quick and easy there, which should make it pretty easy for anyone with a little tech knowledge to turn it into an audio only file that you could

13:17.393 --> 13:19.154
Listen to and I know that's a little bit of work.

13:19.194 --> 13:25.257
I'm still trying to get that that sort of whole thing working I'm trying to get notifications somehow.

13:25.297 --> 13:28.018
I just got notified that Soapbox can do that.

13:28.058 --> 13:40.805
So maybe we're gonna take that into consideration I do see that my guest has joined the meeting behind me and so we're we're looking at this paradigm shift that's happening all around the world and the question is

13:41.745 --> 13:43.206
What are we going to shift into?

13:43.307 --> 13:44.327
How are we going to shift?

13:44.608 --> 13:56.897
And my goal with the biology is to try to get people to drop their hands so that they can, you know, stop this active participation in the illusion and to engage in informed non-compliance.

13:56.958 --> 14:03.303
And I think as far as the history goes, staying informed is really important or you're going to repeat it, right?

14:06.391 --> 14:06.551
do

14:30.967 --> 14:36.448
Okay, I'm just gonna flash through these slides really quick to make sure that all of this is working.

14:36.468 --> 14:38.008
It is the 11th of July.

14:38.068 --> 14:39.269
I'm a human just like you.

14:39.329 --> 14:41.149
You know what we say every time we start.

14:41.929 --> 14:46.570
You know that there's another way to say it, that weaponized piles of money have convinced us to argue about this stuff.

14:47.130 --> 14:59.253
And I think one of the things that kind of transitions well into my current guest is the idea that weaponized piles of money have been getting us to argue about the wrong things for a lot longer than most of us have realized.

14:59.933 --> 15:06.396
And that is, of course, evident in the words of Noam Chomsky and the guy who comes before him, Edward Bernays.

15:06.796 --> 15:11.758
They've been manipulating our conscious and intelligent opinions, you know, for a very long time.

15:12.318 --> 15:20.922
And so yesterday we had David Webb and The Great Taking, the author of The Great Taking on, and it was a sort of crash course into how some of the

15:22.122 --> 15:29.989
cardinal ideas of the of the financial system have been corrupted so that essentially we already don't own the things we think we own and today

15:33.883 --> 15:35.464
Sorry, Matt, I hope you don't mind.

15:35.524 --> 15:40.267
I really like this old game show theme, so I always play it before my guests come on.

15:40.907 --> 15:50.532
Today we have a gentleman by the name of Matt, and can you, I presume your last name is spelled, or pronounced E-red, but I've never actually heard it said before.

15:51.053 --> 15:52.854
I always miss the beginning of a podcast.

15:52.894 --> 15:59.317
Let me just get out of here, and this should allow me to do, put this up there, and then hello.

15:59.638 --> 16:00.978
I'm gonna slide you over here.

16:02.139 --> 16:03.319
And now you should see me.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.581
And then I'm going to shift myself down to the corner, if you don't mind.

16:07.641 --> 16:09.182
And this is how we'll do the interview.

16:09.262 --> 16:09.662
Hello.

16:10.022 --> 16:10.842
Welcome to the show.

16:11.463 --> 16:12.043
Nice to meet you.

16:12.063 --> 16:14.364
Hey, JJ.

16:14.804 --> 16:15.584
Nice to meet you, too.

16:15.644 --> 16:16.545
It's been a long time coming.

16:16.565 --> 16:21.407
We've had, I think, a few mutual friends who have been really trying to poke us to have a conversation.

16:21.427 --> 16:22.487
So I'm glad it finally panned out.

16:22.787 --> 16:24.108
And yeah, Erit is fine.

16:24.148 --> 16:24.768
Erit is fine.

16:24.908 --> 16:26.048
It's typically Erit.

16:26.288 --> 16:27.269
Erit, OK, sorry.

16:27.349 --> 16:29.750
Erit with a K, but except the K, it's a T at the end.

16:30.490 --> 16:30.990
I got you.

16:31.110 --> 16:31.410
Okay.

16:31.830 --> 16:32.230
Very good.

16:32.451 --> 16:32.831
Very good.

16:33.591 --> 16:36.732
So you are an author of more than one book.

16:37.172 --> 16:39.112
I know you have a very active substack.

16:40.073 --> 16:49.095
When you asked me what we should talk about, I told you that I was a pretty naive guy when it comes to the idea of collectivism and individualism.

16:50.236 --> 16:59.949
And that I had just recently heard this summary of G. Edward Griffin, and I thought it was a really some way of looking at it that I'd never looked at before.

17:00.550 --> 17:04.615
And then very quickly I had other people tell me, well, it's not that simple either, though.

17:06.678 --> 17:09.579
That's how this really started to fuel in the background.

17:09.599 --> 17:10.659
You need to talk to Matt.

17:10.699 --> 17:11.700
You need to talk to Matt.

17:11.820 --> 17:16.801
And so without further ado, maybe that's the only way that I'll cue it off.

17:16.841 --> 17:20.203
And then after this, I'll just ask for help or a lifeline when I need it.

17:22.043 --> 17:23.844
I yeah, sure.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.584
I'm looking forward to chatting about that.

17:25.604 --> 17:28.005
And that was actually sort of the germ seed of the.

17:30.728 --> 17:38.373
how I was thinking about framing the first volume of my book series, The Clash of the Two Americas, called The Unfinished Symphony.

17:39.298 --> 17:41.440
was this idea that, okay, I'm a Canadian.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.002
I'm a Canadian trying to figure out America.

17:44.022 --> 17:44.983
I'm trying to figure out Canada.

17:45.143 --> 17:52.349
And I felt at a certain point about a decade ago that I had a much better handle on what the United States was and I didn't know what Canada was.

17:52.949 --> 17:55.932
So at the time I was working with the Schiller Institute.

17:56.392 --> 18:02.858
It's an organization that had been created by Lyndon LaRouche, an American economist who passed away in 2019.

18:02.898 --> 18:03.218
He was around,

18:05.640 --> 18:09.444
fighting the good fight for well over 50 years, quite an exceptional guy.

18:09.604 --> 18:12.186
And I started volunteering in around 2006.

18:12.246 --> 18:13.887
Wow.

18:13.948 --> 18:18.191
He had a lot of people on the ground, like passing out papers.

18:18.251 --> 18:19.553
It was very impressive.

18:19.913 --> 18:21.955
I knew of him well, let's say it like that.

18:25.819 --> 18:31.426
Yeah, you know, like I there was a small grouping in Canada, maybe 11 or 12 people at the time.

18:31.867 --> 18:40.878
And I felt at the time that I had for a couple of years on my own pulled together what I figured was a pretty decent picture of what this new world order was.

18:40.898 --> 18:42.960
You know, I had my own little shakeup and trauma.

18:43.681 --> 18:59.231
looking into 9-11 on my own terms and trying to piece together what would be a more viable explanation for our history if the current standard model of history was garbage, because obviously whoever did 9-11 couldn't have just taken power overnight.

18:59.251 --> 19:09.258
It must have been something that took time and an immense amount of planning that there would be a force that malevolent with such influence within what I thought was a democracy in some level.

19:09.278 --> 19:12.320
I knew there was corruption, but you're like, well, this is more than corruption.

19:13.921 --> 19:29.730
This is, and this is also tied to something that involves the cover up of john F Kennedy, you know you start looking into Northwoods into the bigger picture of the, the narratives within narratives and it's like why would most people who are no longer even alive were involved with Operation Northwoods.

19:30.670 --> 19:47.665
You know, Kennedy shot it down when General Lemnitzer, who became the head of NATO after he was fired by Kennedy, he was the head of the Joint Chiefs, after he proposed killing American civilians in a plane and blaming it on the communists to invade Cuba, JFK rejected it.

19:48.505 --> 19:52.268
But all of the people involved with that, with the murder of JFK, they're mostly dead.

19:54.304 --> 20:02.106
in whose interest is it today to keep that real story, which goes far beyond a lone gunman, secret.

20:02.446 --> 20:14.789
So there is a connection, you know, and it takes you a little bit of time, but it's not too difficult to realize that there's a connection to pretty much everything, 9-11, JFK, then you're like, okay, well, what about Lincoln's murder?

20:15.409 --> 20:20.371
Like, okay, okay, so there's a whole other higher story, a higher, more,

20:22.560 --> 20:29.264
explanation that is more proximate to the reality of how things actually transpired, transpired, most importantly, why.

20:30.184 --> 20:37.789
And I found that there was, I was very satisfied with the approach and the methodology of analysis that I found with Lyndon LaRouche.

20:37.829 --> 20:42.832
So I began in 2006, volunteering in this small Canadian grouping.

20:44.753 --> 20:54.223
And that was a learning curve for me, just organizing strangers, as you pointed out, handing out pamphlets with political signage, which is very provocative, getting spat at, getting in fights.

20:54.283 --> 21:04.774
So I found myself sort of growing in some interesting ways just by virtue of fighting with strangers around big ideas that most people are not equipped to talk about, systemic.

21:05.523 --> 21:20.963
You know what, how should they know back in 2007 that there's a systemic meltdown built into the system that there's a death cult that's taking control of major functions of their government that it's not even American per se but the pedigree of this is actually tied to an international

21:21.564 --> 21:28.266
financier oligarchy, which actually has as its base of operations, a location on the other side of the ocean.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.206
That's not even American per se.

21:30.226 --> 21:37.688
And all this stuff for a Canadian especially, where we are already trained in our British education system to kind of despise Americans.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.068
That's the way I'll look.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.189
We're told we're the

21:41.269 --> 21:48.634
We sound a little like the Americans, you know, we're made up of a lot of white people and, you know, similar composition and culture.

21:49.415 --> 21:51.797
But we watched The Simpsons together and stuff.

21:51.817 --> 21:53.198
So we're very American like.

21:53.258 --> 21:56.340
However, we're kind of better because we never had to fight for anything.

21:56.440 --> 22:04.205
We knew that if we just stayed loyal to the British crown, that we would eventually be granted freedoms if we just waited patiently, unlike our

22:05.226 --> 22:09.229
impatient Southern cousins, shame on them who caused such a mess.

22:09.869 --> 22:13.452
And now look at the mess they're causing in the world today, Vietnam and all of it.

22:13.632 --> 22:18.035
And it's true, like America behaved really damn badly to the natives, to the world.

22:18.275 --> 22:24.039
I mean, they kind of made it easy to accept this narrative that the British fed us.

22:24.219 --> 22:29.702
But there was a bit of a trick because why were all of these American presidents murdered while in office?

22:29.722 --> 22:30.883
You know, it's a young country.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.646
And yet, despite it being so young, eight American presidents

22:36.246 --> 22:41.548
died while in office, some by bullets, some by poisoning, but eight, that's a huge number.

22:42.469 --> 22:50.912
And for the first time, that was a paradox that I was wrestling with before I really encountered LaRouche's analysis.

22:51.072 --> 23:01.157
And then I found a satisfying explanation when I was challenged by some of the members within that organization who did a lot of history work to go and look at was there anything common

23:02.077 --> 23:17.422
amongst all of the policies of those murdered presidents, that they were fighting to do something against a certain power structure, despite the fact that JFK and Harrison were separated by 200 or 120 years when they died.

23:18.703 --> 23:22.924
President Harrison being the first official president who died while in office after three months.

23:23.285 --> 23:29.327
Were there common denominators that united Lincoln and Garfield and McKinley?

23:30.798 --> 23:34.459
Zachary Taylor and Warren Harding and FDR and JFK.

23:34.479 --> 23:45.363
And it's like, yeah, yeah, there's actually very concise, concrete, unifying themes of what their policy initiatives were that they did, that they were trying to do.

23:45.883 --> 23:54.946
Some of what these people did was successful at subverting certain initiatives that forces amongst another class of Americans

23:55.666 --> 24:09.513
that had typically made their fortunes working with the British East India Company, working with the City of London, working with the opium trading houses of the Sassoons, of the Montefiores, who were managing the opium wars, managing the slave trade.

24:09.833 --> 24:15.816
A lot of those families, like the Cabots, the Lodges, the Lowells, the Morgans, the Rockefellers later on, they were

24:16.656 --> 24:17.857
American in blood.

24:17.877 --> 24:36.366
A lot of these people were born in America, but they were completely loyal to that system of global Anglo hegemony, which was the British Empire was the only one world government with a very tightly managed governing class, a very closed oligarchy of a certain limited array of families.

24:37.899 --> 24:43.823
And auxiliaries that were devoted to maintaining the structures of that master-slave structure of control that had been going on.

24:43.843 --> 24:47.285
Really, if you go down to it, it's continuous back to the days of ancient Babylon.

24:47.486 --> 24:55.191
Similar small family cluster with certain mystery cult religions that initiate and groom their managerial class.

24:55.891 --> 24:59.334
Maybe the form changes over time, but it's the same essence.

25:00.345 --> 25:14.933
And so, you know, when you look at the American Revolution from that new framing, you like revisit what the American Revolution was with that new appreciation for that tapestry, that nature of the battle of history, it means something different.

25:15.193 --> 25:18.455
It's not just, we didn't want to pay, Americans didn't want to pay taxes.

25:18.495 --> 25:21.216
They didn't like British tea and so revolution.

25:21.236 --> 25:22.737
It's like, that's not the reason why.

25:22.797 --> 25:23.498
There was another reason.

25:24.329 --> 25:26.130
That's a much better reason why you would do that.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.012
And then why were all of these American presidents eliminated?

25:30.333 --> 25:30.953
What were they doing?

25:30.973 --> 25:40.059
Well, they were all reviving and acting upon a certain idea of constitutional, both banking and internal policy domestically within America.

25:41.341 --> 26:08.190
to bring forth something that had been created in the fires of that war, and especially with certain reports and policies in the 1790s to create for the first time a unified republic with a national bank capable of emitting productive credit for specifically a program that would be anti-Malthusian, which means, which would overcome limits to growth so that the banking and monetary system would service the needs of

26:10.151 --> 26:27.668
you know, making discoveries, applying them to new technologies, whether canal building, railroads, steam engines, anything that would allow us to overcome limits that were creating boundary conditions, constraints, which, you know, the British Empire is really good at managing constraints, managing scarcity.

26:27.708 --> 26:29.089
That's why they, that's why Malthus

26:29.946 --> 26:34.730
was sort of the first scientific social engineer for the Empire.

26:34.790 --> 26:37.673
He was a teacher at the British East India Company's Haleybury College.

26:37.733 --> 26:45.399
He was a very high level high priest within the British Empire trying to create or advance an idea that

26:46.599 --> 27:02.048
Managing population and managing depopulation was the responsibility of the governing class, utilizing mathematical formulas that tied into certain very primitive notions of arithmetic and geometric growth functions embedded within human systems.

27:02.068 --> 27:06.150
You know, human beings, when left to grow, he said, grow geometrically.

27:06.831 --> 27:07.091
Food

27:07.751 --> 27:09.993
can only reproduce arithmetically.

27:10.693 --> 27:25.143
So one could extrapolate trends into some hypothesized future state, whereby a carrying capacity would be struck, where people supersede the ability to feed them.

27:25.543 --> 27:30.766
And thus, we as a governing class who use this special math called the dismal science that was economics.

27:31.827 --> 27:34.369
He called it the dismal science, because it's the science of killing people.

27:35.890 --> 27:56.948
We can act preventatively on those future crises before they should happen, utilizing controlled famines, constant wars that the British Empire can manage, utilizing fools in their domain who they can get to just fight each other forever, promote plagues whenever possible to help regulate population.

27:56.968 --> 27:57.988
And he's explicit.

27:58.709 --> 28:03.837
He actually in his 1799 book on new essay or essays on population.

28:04.578 --> 28:11.387
He's in the first edition he's explicit where he outlines those gifts that God gave us he was a man of the church after all.

28:13.433 --> 28:18.597
meaning wars, famine, survey, plagues, and I forget another one.

28:18.637 --> 28:23.241
He actually said that that's what should be used to regulate population, and they did so in Ireland.

28:23.721 --> 28:30.747
They depopulated it by two million people in the, they call it the potato famine, but it was actually a genocide, a controlled genocide.

28:30.767 --> 28:37.893
They produced many things other than potatoes in Ireland, but that's sort of, even the Irish don't learn it that way.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.795
They learn it was about a potato blight, not true.

28:40.295 --> 28:41.176
They did it to India 25 times.

28:42.797 --> 28:48.964
Nobody knows how many Indians died, probably well in the hundreds of millions over the course of the two centuries Britain was in control.

28:49.004 --> 28:50.907
They did it everywhere they touched.

28:51.007 --> 28:54.331
They used the science of population management.

28:54.431 --> 28:59.276
And if you look at the original, the best people within the founding fathers,

29:00.273 --> 29:10.376
especially Benjamin Franklin, they were directly taking aim at this view of what human nature was, this disgusting, sick view of human nature that Malthus promoted.

29:10.456 --> 29:21.260
And they were trying to create a system of banking that would counteract the city of London structure of Malthusian banking, based upon the idea that the sovereign nation state, being a pretty new institution,

29:22.298 --> 29:33.781
could control and manage its own national bank to emit credit for the development needs of the people, that it was a participatory government for the first time in history, where everybody was a sovereign, not just one sovereign.

29:34.561 --> 29:39.142
But of course, the battle there to make this work, and this gets at the main question that you were leading into.

29:39.162 --> 29:43.223
So I'll just sort of wrap up my little composition in my head here.

29:44.243 --> 29:50.285
The only way for this to work, as John Adams said, is that the republic can only work if you have a moral and religious people.

29:52.265 --> 30:04.705
It's a cultural fight because the only way that people could see themselves could qualify for citizen hood instead of subject hood citizens being different from subjects subjects, you know, our feudal art have a feudal mentality they want.

30:05.953 --> 30:22.292
The government to just take care of them, they don't see, they don't look in the mirror and see the government looking back at them whereas a citizen recognizes your rights are something that were fought for that come with duties and responsibilities you look in the gut in the mirror and you see somebody who's responsible for.

30:23.093 --> 30:41.921
Morally, for my kids, my grandkids, the nation as a whole, humanity as a whole, these are more elevated, matured identities where you see that you and the government are tied together because the government itself grew out of the fires of a battle for the concept of freedom, which without finalizing the battle, it was never finalized.

30:43.821 --> 30:49.824
So it's a cultural fight primarily to unify the personal sense of self-interest of the individual

30:50.871 --> 31:12.767
with the wellbeing, the general welfare of the whole, which is why in this book, The Unfinished Symphony, I tried to get across that the American Revolution is in many ways a really beautiful thing that involved a battle that most even Americans don't understand and guaranteed most Canadians, I would say no Canadian understands what that was all about.

31:13.208 --> 31:17.451
Because we had Benjamin Franklin here who was trying to negotiate in 1776 in April

31:19.212 --> 31:35.504
He was in Montreal, where I live, and he was trying to get Canada to send a delegation to the Continental Congress in 1776 to sign a Declaration of Independence to say, OK, us 14 colonies together will say we're going to create a new type of structure of governance that rejects hereditary institution.

31:36.004 --> 31:37.165
And he couldn't get any traction.

31:37.245 --> 31:39.026
He was up here for like four or five weeks.

31:39.907 --> 31:48.671
And he couldn't find the culture within the Quebec population or the leadership, which was mostly Jesuit and Anglican managed at the time.

31:49.432 --> 31:56.435
Anglicanism being a weird form of the church with the king, the hereditary monarch as the Pope.

31:58.863 --> 32:17.040
And unfortunately, he said, you know, they're good people in Quebec, they just they're French Canadian, they just gotten defeated by the British Empire in the Seven Years War, but they don't have a culture of literacy that because of French seniorism, the French feudal systems, they're not able to read Thomas Paine's Common Sense, they're not able to read the pamphlets.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.821
So because of that,

32:19.522 --> 32:30.010
that feudal mentality, they didn't understand the meaning of why they should go and fight in Washington's army for these abstract ideas.

32:31.031 --> 32:31.792
It wasn't there.

32:32.612 --> 32:38.317
So whereas in the United States, there was more in the English-speaking 13 colonies,

32:39.778 --> 32:42.959
there was more of a culture of the Latin farmer.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.601
Almost everybody was literate, could read Latin, could read Greek, could read the Bible.

32:48.342 --> 33:01.928
So you had a greater cultural soil in which these very high ideas could find root, in which you would be willing to go out and risk your life and your family even to fight the world's biggest empire.

33:02.708 --> 33:09.534
So it was great that it happened, but a lot was left undealt with, including this big function of oligarchs.

33:10.014 --> 33:17.861
So some of the oligarchs that were loyal to the empire were kicked out, obviously, of the 13 colonies, and they were given sanctuary in Canada.

33:18.542 --> 33:27.249
And that's why we have English-speaking Canada, is because the United Empire loyalists who wanted to stay loyal to king and empire

33:27.990 --> 33:33.256
We're granted territory here in Toronto and Montreal and so we have English speaking Canadians.

33:35.459 --> 33:44.149
And certain bribes were given to the Quebec, to the Canadians at the time to just stay loyal to the crown, certain limited freedoms, of course.

33:46.553 --> 33:49.155
But then you, and then some of them stayed behind.

33:49.195 --> 33:57.040
So some of the traders remained behind in the 13 colonies, acting like they were patriots, but were always loyal in their heart of hearts to the empire.

33:57.060 --> 34:10.069
And if you wanna look at the origins of the deep state of America, the thing that's recently been called deep state, but the thing that oversaw the murder of Kennedy, the thing that oversaw the murder of Lincoln, that created the KKK, that created the Scottish right, that created the FBI, the CIA,

34:11.010 --> 34:12.311
It's all unifying.

34:12.331 --> 34:21.795
There's a unifying theme that goes back to this failure to deal with this thing that then created Wall Street in the late 1790s by Aaron Burr.

34:22.555 --> 34:34.460
It created this whole machinery, this shadow government, this fifth column that was incubating and growing and subverting the better ideals and the people who stood for those better ideals.

34:36.281 --> 34:37.942
throughout the next 250 years.

34:38.022 --> 34:48.805
And again, the fight was always cultural because the qualifications for a citizen who could both look at the Declaration of Independence as well as the Constitution.

34:48.825 --> 35:02.049
So the Declaration of 1776 is very unambiguous over the sacredness of the liberty of the individual, the inalienable rights of each person, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, very clear and unambiguous.

35:03.612 --> 35:09.797
But then you have the Constitution of 1787, both of which were presided over by Ben Franklin, mind you.

35:10.317 --> 35:19.725
So one mind, the guy who discovers the nature of electricity, he's the guy who creates the first newspapers in Canada, the first postal services, Benjamin Franklin.

35:20.446 --> 35:21.707
This guy's just everything.

35:22.007 --> 35:22.868
He's everywhere.

35:22.908 --> 35:24.309
He's a grand strategist.

35:24.469 --> 35:25.149
He's really good.

35:26.090 --> 35:28.391
And he's the guy who's overseeing these two founding documents.

35:28.451 --> 35:32.674
But one of the Constitution, its emphasis is on the general welfare.

35:33.274 --> 35:47.142
And today, there's a big I think our education and culture has caused a bit of a scrambling of the mind where it's very you get these debates amongst constitutional scholars and Americans who call themselves patriots saying,

35:47.912 --> 36:04.545
Well, you can't have both, you know, either it's the general welfare, which matters or it's the inalienable rights of the individual, because we can obviously obviously the term, the greater good or the general welfare can obviously be abused by tyrants.

36:04.805 --> 36:07.627
We've seen that so many times, especially the last few years.

36:07.787 --> 36:08.167
However,

36:08.936 --> 36:13.179
However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.

36:13.319 --> 36:30.191
It just means that when we allow for certain corruptions to happen, and when we tolerate certain mediocrity within our culture and within ourselves, it will happen that our government will be taken over by something that might want to enslave us and use the technology of government as a tool to enslave and hurt us.

36:30.611 --> 36:31.232
That's true.

36:31.592 --> 36:37.236
And it will utilize certain language of sophistry, like we got to make sacrifices for the greater good.

36:37.776 --> 36:38.037
Sure.

36:38.857 --> 36:41.600
But it doesn't mean that the greater good should be thrown in the garbage either.

36:42.221 --> 36:55.614
And the whole idea of unifying the individual liberty with the greater good requires a very high quality of education, it requires certain access to information, that's where the media

36:56.094 --> 36:59.077
in a democracy is a very important tool for control.

36:59.678 --> 37:13.150
If you can corrupt the minds of the people and turn media into tabloid gossip or whatever else, you definitely scramble the ability to formulate citizens who can pass judgments, utilize discernment, withhold judgment before they look at all of the facts.

37:14.411 --> 37:17.033
That's something that people need to do in every field that we look at.

37:18.314 --> 37:19.676
But instead, people want to jump the gun.

37:19.756 --> 37:22.037
So then we get demagoguery.

37:22.077 --> 37:28.462
We get people acquiescing in mob rule to supporting figures who actually are going to hurt us.

37:28.882 --> 37:32.085
And we're not thinking it through because we're not thinking about the policies.

37:32.105 --> 37:39.310
We're not thinking about what's behind the surface flowery words that people are utilizing to get our emotional support for things.

37:39.330 --> 37:40.791
And that's the story of America.

37:40.811 --> 37:44.314
That's the story, I think, of even the collapse of Rome, when you looked at how

37:44.738 --> 37:48.882
people quickly turned on Pompeii and then supported Caesar according to Shakespeare.

37:48.902 --> 38:05.519
You know, the mob was was just coaxed left and right by flowery rhetoricians to endorse policies that were ultimately turning Rome from what little viable republicanism it still had within it into a full blown empire with a god man, you know.

38:08.608 --> 38:23.739
Emperor God at the helm with a set of Gnostic mystery cults and hedonistic self-human sacrifice and orgies, you know, keeping the people and the Praetorian Guard entertained in between wars.

38:24.399 --> 38:25.040
So, yeah.

38:26.140 --> 38:26.981
So when you say

38:28.513 --> 38:40.486
When you say like a crown loyalist, can I, would the modern better way or not better way, but what an alternative way to think about that be something like the city of London?

38:40.546 --> 38:41.687
Is that what we're talking about?

38:41.847 --> 38:47.773
Or, and again, because my, my understanding of this is very, very,

38:50.799 --> 39:01.501
Well, I knew just enough that they lied in order to function as a citizen, but I didn't understand that the entire theater was orchestrated on all sides and this kind of thing that I now understand.

39:02.502 --> 39:16.405
And even as I moved through the biology of it and biology woke me up to how they do it, now looking back on the history that I know as an adult, I shake my head because I understand that I don't really know what happened.

39:17.972 --> 39:24.016
It is a very interesting take that I think also Ed Griffin has.

39:24.056 --> 39:27.739
So should I think of America as never having actually won the revolution?

39:29.247 --> 39:34.333
Or, I mean, where are we at at this stage in your model?

39:35.334 --> 39:46.747
Or is it still a balance between people who are patriotic to the American ideal and people who are loyal to whatever globalist thing is happening here?

39:46.967 --> 39:48.489
Or is it already over?

39:49.485 --> 39:49.645
Hmm.

39:50.566 --> 40:03.572
No, I don't think it's over, but we wasted a lot of time and we allowed a lot of a very high degree of mediocrity and corruption to become normalized for an astounding period of time.

40:03.952 --> 40:05.573
And it's always it's always been a fight.

40:06.073 --> 40:06.273
Right.

40:06.293 --> 40:08.975
The decadence and socio

40:10.035 --> 40:14.719
psycho decay of a people has always been a threat and a problem in it.

40:14.779 --> 40:25.549
Whenever we go into these like dark agey downturns, whenever we slide into periods of forgetting what made us good in the past and we don't give appreciation, we take for granted those things.

40:25.569 --> 40:27.691
Yeah, we slide and we this sort of thing happens.

40:27.751 --> 40:33.856
But the extent in the time frame in which this has been drawn out, I would say really

40:35.217 --> 40:40.761
Since the especially since the murder and cover up of JFK and then his brother and Martin Luther King Jr.

40:40.801 --> 40:42.622
and Malcolm X, like that was a high density.

40:43.543 --> 40:46.625
Fred Hampton as well, killed by the FBI.

40:47.226 --> 40:51.709
Very high density array of assassinations in that period.

40:53.588 --> 41:06.694
Similar in some ways to the density of assassinations in the early 20s when there was a fight against the one world government agenda around the League of Nations and the eugenicists behind the League of Nations and tied very much to the city of London and the crown for sure.

41:08.175 --> 41:13.898
But there was an international wave of murders of statesmen in the 20s, just like there was in the 60s and early 70s.

41:14.438 --> 41:16.279
And just like there was after Lincoln was murdered.

41:16.699 --> 41:18.880
And there was a vast array of assassinations

41:19.540 --> 41:31.008
from, again, Garfield, Czar Alexander II, Czar Alexander III, Nicholas II, Sidi Carmel, the president of France, and something like 40 German high-level politicians.

41:31.028 --> 41:33.750
I mean, there was a lot of, it was the age of assassination.

41:33.810 --> 41:42.096
But again, the common thread behind these things is that there's an accompanying insanity

41:43.143 --> 41:47.908
of the mob, which tends to if you don't have like if you if you don't have.

41:47.928 --> 42:01.304
And this is the thing like some people might take offense of what I'm about to say but I'm going to say it because the human beings, we organize whether it's in the family unit or around classrooms or in cities where there's a mayor or whatever we

42:03.581 --> 42:12.608
have a leader, like we organize ourselves within some form of somebody taking voluntary leadership to get something done.

42:13.549 --> 42:23.816
And you can see that in a lot of primitive societies too, it's something which is just the way we organically organize to do things and get challenges solved, you know, if you're trying to build some

42:25.086 --> 42:29.307
Some engineering structure and there's things that need to get figured out.

42:29.707 --> 42:33.369
Some people will take more initiative than others and will help people along the way.

42:33.449 --> 42:43.532
The question is what qualifies somebody as a good qualified leader with what the Chinese might call the mandate of heaven versus somebody who is abusive of that authority.

42:44.612 --> 42:47.133
That's part of the whole challenge, right?

42:47.393 --> 42:55.156
Hence, what is, how do we judge a good president who usually gets assassinated or at least, versus somebody who's abusive.

42:55.196 --> 42:57.856
And I don't wanna say that you can only trust people when they die.

42:57.877 --> 42:59.937
I don't wanna say that either, but that's just been the theme.

43:03.478 --> 43:10.181
And when you don't have the wisdom of somebody who is doing it for the right reasons, right?

43:10.261 --> 43:10.501
Who's,

43:13.815 --> 43:16.438
Usually when you look at a Martin Luther King Jr.

43:16.478 --> 43:19.460
and you read his writings, you get to know his personality more.

43:19.480 --> 43:22.403
You look at the sacrifices that he was making, willing to make.

43:22.443 --> 43:25.626
You listen to the From the Mountaintop speech and you look at his strategy.

43:25.646 --> 43:30.851
He wasn't doing it for the power, for the money.

43:30.871 --> 43:35.915
And I know there's been a lot of gossipy books by his enemies that have been published to slander.

43:36.696 --> 43:40.178
his to do character assassinations on him over the years.

43:40.198 --> 43:41.379
And I've done the work.

43:41.399 --> 43:52.207
I can tell you most of what people think of when they're like, oh, he was the orgy, abusive orgiastic, abusive woman beater that he was a hypocrite.

43:52.507 --> 43:55.009
I could tell you when you actually scratch the surface of those narratives.

43:55.649 --> 44:14.459
You'll find Cambridge and Rhodes Scholar officiate official hack historians who are creating false models to destroy our ability to actually recognize and appreciate the sublime character of what he was doing, and they create gossip and turn it into a repeat gossip.

44:15.019 --> 44:31.726
make it into fact by repetition, and then all of a sudden, give a few Pulitzer Prizes to a book or two, which gives it the grounding of, like, truth, that then all of a sudden becomes associated with the identity of a JFK who obviously oversaw the murder of Marilyn Monroe.

44:32.626 --> 44:38.630
and obviously tried to kill Castro and invade Cuba and obviously wanted Northwoods.

44:38.650 --> 44:42.053
And JFK was, you can't learn anything from JFK.

44:42.073 --> 44:44.915
And Lincoln was a tyrant and he was abusive to his wife.

44:45.055 --> 44:50.519
Anyway, so there's all of these things that they do in a gossipy tabloid type of style.

44:50.879 --> 45:00.887
But if you look at the source and you do some honest digging over these claims, you'll usually find self-referential gossip without any evidence that would

45:01.767 --> 45:02.287
It's make believe.

45:02.487 --> 45:07.790
Anyway, I'm saying this just to get across your your to your question was, is the Republic salvageable?

45:08.590 --> 45:15.033
There's been now 50, 60 years of consumer society decay where we we allowed a lot of time to be wasted.

45:17.222 --> 45:31.588
And I do think that it is viable, but people need to really speed up their bell curve discovery process fast and put into question a lot of their fundamental axioms.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.189
As you just pointed out very well, you're saying your gateway

45:36.670 --> 45:38.591
was through your path in science.

45:39.971 --> 45:41.212
Everybody has their own gateway.

45:42.032 --> 45:43.673
COVID was a big wake-up call.

45:44.113 --> 45:45.273
Mine was 9-11.

45:46.133 --> 45:49.235
That was my gateway, but everyone's got their own thing.

45:49.275 --> 45:59.358
But at a certain point, you have to presume that not, you don't wanna throw the baby out with the bathwater, because you definitely, we know certain things.

45:59.558 --> 46:00.719
Not everything was a lie.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.099
Like, society still has to function.

46:02.159 --> 46:03.660
However, the coloring,

46:04.736 --> 46:14.724
explaining why a lot of the things we take for granted are the way they are, we have to put into question and maybe revisit a lot of our core assumptions within this new process.

46:14.904 --> 46:22.669
So people need to do that if they're gonna be able to, I think, reevaluate why the oligarchy has been obsessed with destroying America for the past 250 years.

46:23.470 --> 46:33.818
And yeah, when I say the crown, the United Empire loyalists, that does refer to the British Empire, but the British Empire, the crown itself is kind of,

46:37.979 --> 46:42.361
There was a certain point not that long ago when England wasn't yet an empire.

46:42.522 --> 46:48.666
It had a different destiny pulling on it, which was a more noble destiny before this parasite took control of England.

46:49.126 --> 46:50.847
And I've got a book, actually.

46:54.389 --> 46:59.253
Volume four of my book series is on the Anglo-Venetian roots of the deep state.

47:00.133 --> 47:01.194
And that's the St.

47:01.234 --> 47:02.195
Mark's Lion here.

47:03.828 --> 47:03.968
St.

47:04.008 --> 47:21.674
Mark's line, which is the line of Venice, which one can actually trace that the transformation of England from being a viable nation into an empire was overseen by a Venetian operation.

47:21.794 --> 47:28.837
So Venice was a little, it was called the Serene Republic, but it was never Republic ever.

47:29.750 --> 47:40.048
And it was sort of one of the core central headquarters which many of the ruling patrician families that were in the Western Roman Empire when the as the Western Roman Empire was melting down.

47:41.215 --> 47:51.678
due largely to its own overbloated desire to spread itself into a global one-world empire, uniting East and West under a world man-god and an associated priesthood.

47:52.638 --> 48:09.622
As that thing melted down under its own corruption, a lot of the, not surviving, but a lot of the patrician families that overplayed their card had to move their assets and families into more secure geographical zones of which Venice was a key place

48:10.382 --> 48:13.063
and Venice became sort of the reconstructed empire.

48:13.143 --> 48:31.472
And for some centuries, it was known as the principal, and this is commonly known back in the 13th century, 14th century, Dante understood this, Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Thomas More, they write about this, was the center of evil.

48:31.752 --> 48:36.635
And it was the center of global bullion trade, maritime banking, especially when they took control of the,

48:39.537 --> 48:45.061
did a bit of a coup on Constantinople, which was sort of the mother empire of the Byzantine Empire.

48:46.442 --> 48:56.250
After the Fourth Crusade, a coup was carried out and Venice took control of Constantinople's trade routes over land all the way to Asia, all the way through the Maritime and even into Africa.

48:57.091 --> 49:02.695
And then they became sort of that thing with deep penetration into the courts of all of Europe.

49:03.516 --> 49:21.249
You had Venetian advisors advising Genghis Khan and his grandsons over managing the growth of the Mongol Empire for centuries as sort of the marcher lords or proxies for the Venetians, just the same way ISIS has been utilized by American intelligence.

49:22.129 --> 49:24.671
as a nominally Islamic, but not really.

49:24.711 --> 49:37.021
The whole thing is funded by the CIA, provided logistical support by the CIA, by British intelligence to overthrow governments, whether Qaddafi, whether Iraq, whoever that you want to overthrow.

49:37.121 --> 49:40.905
That's what ISIS is, and that's what Genghis Khan, the evidence I've seen,

49:41.505 --> 49:42.745
is what he largely was.

49:42.965 --> 49:54.128
And again, advised by Venetians, provided intelligence by Venetians with their network of espionage through their embassies and all the courts of Europe, of Russia, of Northern Africa, of India.

49:56.148 --> 49:58.869
So this is something that is serious and it took over Britain.

49:59.129 --> 50:07.970
It took over England, especially that culminated with the 1688 Glorious Revolution that saw the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 inside of England.

50:11.215 --> 50:16.500
as sort of a new type of financier empire.

50:16.961 --> 50:33.758
And along the way, a lot of the great English humanist patriots who were against empire got their heads cut off, like Thomas More, got expelled, like Jonathan Swift, who was also fighting against the Malthusians with his satire.

50:34.979 --> 50:58.797
um like like a modest proposal which which gave like a hilarious is a pamphlet that gave a hilarious bit of advice on how to cook and eat babies since we have too many babies and we're overpopulated so why don't we just eat a bit but he's doing it to like shame and and and expose the actual practices of killing children by the empire um and jonathan swift is the guy who's advising

50:59.457 --> 51:04.170
the government of England who's fighting against this Venetian takeover of Robert Harley, the prime minister back in the 1690s, early 1700s.

51:08.323 --> 51:09.844
But they're not successful.

51:09.925 --> 51:11.046
England is transformed.

51:11.106 --> 51:17.631
This whole Hellfire Club operation of this Gnostic Satanism is infused into the governing class at that time.

51:19.052 --> 51:20.234
This is brought in by Venice.

51:20.934 --> 51:24.277
So this is what America eventually has to battle.

51:25.018 --> 51:31.984
As some British colonies, they have to, with a different kind of culture far removed across the ocean, they have to battle this thing.

51:33.667 --> 51:34.988
And again, it's not finalized.

51:35.009 --> 51:36.790
So it's a great thing that it happened.

51:38.392 --> 51:41.755
The oligarchy has been trying to put the genie back in the bottle for the next 250 years.

51:42.416 --> 51:44.938
The oligarchy wasn't happy that that thing happened in 1776.

51:45.179 --> 51:48.602
They've been very unhappy, to say the least.

51:49.363 --> 51:51.205
But it wasn't a one war.

51:51.245 --> 51:52.846
It was a one battle.

51:53.783 --> 51:54.783
but the war wasn't won.

51:54.823 --> 52:02.767
There were periods which helped advance the ideals within the constitution, but you know, you still had slavery.

52:03.487 --> 52:06.309
Like slaves were still three fifths of a human.

52:06.409 --> 52:07.869
So that took time to start.

52:08.190 --> 52:11.631
So then bring it up, bring it up closer to modern day then.

52:11.771 --> 52:18.094
How much of this in modern history and modern America is now, you know,

52:18.989 --> 52:36.274
Are you suggesting, for example, that we need to, and I've been saying it for a while, that if there were weaponized piles of money back in these 1700s, and those weaponized piles of money are continuous with a pile of money that exists now, then those piles of money must be inordinately large.

52:38.030 --> 52:52.610
Anything that we're talking about is probably dwarfed in terms of whatever large piles if it was a large pile of money in 1600 and these people used a a cult or whatever to continually

52:54.324 --> 53:03.489
sort of sit on top of this weaponized piles of pile of money, then for me, what I want to understand is, is why do you have Trudeau as a premier?

53:03.509 --> 53:05.230
Why do we have Biden as a premier?

53:05.830 --> 53:17.337
Why, how can we understand the trap that we're currently in, given the fact that history says, this is a continuous line of liars that has been sitting on weaponized piles of money and using them against us?

53:19.346 --> 53:21.287
Well, we've been lied to, I think.

53:22.227 --> 53:28.568
There's this common belief that money makes the world go round, which we were told and it became sort of a governing trope.

53:28.988 --> 53:29.769
And it's not true.

53:32.769 --> 53:46.193
So like I was mentioning here, this takeover of England by the Venetians, and this will touch at your heart of the answer to the question, I think part of the way that worked because this happened by

53:47.881 --> 54:05.490
The glorious revolution I refer to, overseen by the Venetians, was actually done both with Venice and Venice first having to take control of Amsterdam first, because Amsterdam was also an anti-imperial culture with a high degree of scientific and artistic excellence that had to be subverted.

54:05.850 --> 54:15.495
So the way the empire works, it sort of subverts by corrupting the places where there is the greatest good and thus the greatest danger to the existence of the oligarchy.

54:16.075 --> 54:23.997
The way they did that largely was through turning Amsterdam into a stock, a gambling house.

54:24.317 --> 54:28.778
So they created the Dutch Stock Exchange, the privatized central bank of Amsterdam.

54:29.218 --> 54:43.341
But the stock exchange basically took what was the idea of viable investments and into things that were entrepreneurial, into nation building exercises like the canals and things, and transformed it into gambling

54:44.025 --> 54:48.591
on whatever increasingly people were gambling making money off of tulip bulbs.

54:49.131 --> 54:51.014
So yeah, that's what's called the Dutch tulip bubble.

54:51.855 --> 54:55.178
And I would say this was not an organically emerging sociological phenomenon.

54:55.199 --> 54:59.243
This was an economic warfare to transform a viable

55:00.413 --> 55:09.498
nation state into a time bomb that could be detonated to then create a wealth transfer on the one hand for the people stupid enough to play into this money-making machinery.

55:09.518 --> 55:18.763
Because everybody was making money on the stock exchange gambling first with tulip bulbs from like, you know, the Ottoman Empire in India, you know, the rarer the more valuable.

55:19.644 --> 55:24.286
And then at a certain point, they were just gambling on paper representing tulip bulbs.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.488
So they weren't even producing tulip bulbs.

55:27.503 --> 55:32.145
And castles were being exchanged for papers representing tulip bulbs.

55:32.386 --> 55:33.186
And you can see the rates.

55:33.686 --> 55:44.872
There's books written on the madness of crowds, which just shows the rate of exponential, even maybe hyperbolic value growth out of fictitious capital.

55:46.233 --> 55:50.395
But now the people who organized the propaganda for that at the top,

55:51.374 --> 56:01.100
always knew it was a time bomb that they played into it and were the ones to sell, sell their their their stocks for high profit.

56:01.201 --> 56:13.869
And before they triggered the meltdown and then using the assets, using the money that they got by selling their tulip stocks, they were able to buy up hard assets of agricultural land, castles, everything else.

56:14.389 --> 56:15.410
So huge wealth transfer.

56:15.550 --> 56:16.471
And it was done by design.

56:17.011 --> 56:17.831
And then you could see

56:18.812 --> 56:27.096
just the level of consolidation of power of this, you know, the Dutch deep state that was always allied and coordinated by Venice.

56:27.516 --> 56:29.257
Again, Venice is key in this whole thing.

56:29.657 --> 56:36.880
But that's interesting because we're told a story in history books that the Rothschild guy did that with Napoleon, right?

56:37.140 --> 56:39.261
So he knew that the war was won and that he

56:40.020 --> 56:46.644
He had some kind of whisper in his ear and then everybody reacted one way and he reacted another and blah, blah, blah.

56:46.864 --> 56:49.506
So it sounds like a very, very similar trick.

56:49.726 --> 56:50.987
And so I have two questions.

56:51.207 --> 57:00.172
One is this Venetian, whatever you're talking about, they're separate from him and also separate from the Vatican.

57:00.412 --> 57:04.595
So how should we, how should I figure that into this a little bit?

57:06.553 --> 57:19.382
I mean, in the sense of, are they competing factions then, this Venice group and the Rothschild or whatever that is, and then also the Vatican, are they all competing interests then, working against each other?

57:19.442 --> 57:21.203
Okay, these are good questions.

57:22.804 --> 57:26.927
They're somewhat complex, like they require some development.

57:27.327 --> 57:28.288
Okay.

57:31.259 --> 57:31.800
Not really.

57:31.900 --> 57:35.361
There is a common understanding amongst oligarchs.

57:35.401 --> 57:37.082
So there are a limited array of families.

57:37.102 --> 57:43.005
And some of the families at different times are at the apex of the pyramid of, let's say, the French empire.

57:43.045 --> 57:49.549
You know, you got the Bourbons, the House of Orléans, certain governing houses of France.

57:50.249 --> 57:58.373
And then you have certain governing houses, the Cavendishes, the Bulwers, the Littons of the higher families of England.

57:59.574 --> 58:12.165
You got certain you know that came in a lot of them came in during the Norman takeover of the 11th century that oversaw then the the mercenary cults that would be created like the Templars to usher in the age of the Crusades.

58:15.759 --> 58:19.580
Thurman, Texas and Sachse-Kuberg and others.

58:19.820 --> 58:22.801
So yes, that's a limited array of governing houses.

58:22.821 --> 58:23.741
A lot of them are Italian.

58:23.761 --> 58:27.682
A lot of the Italian ones, I think, tend to go back a little bit deeper into the past.

58:29.963 --> 58:35.844
Some of them believe that they're they got stories that they cook up for themselves as well to animate to animate them.

58:36.664 --> 58:41.426
So what one popular story that that's outlined in this book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail,

58:43.186 --> 58:45.128
is something that the oligarchy believes.

58:45.248 --> 58:57.018
I don't believe it, but they created the story that some of these families are directly connected through the bloodline of the children of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

58:57.038 --> 59:01.442
Jesus didn't actually die, lived out his days in France with Mary Magdalene.

59:02.042 --> 59:14.992
created a secret gospel with secret teachings for Mary Magdalene and one other, John, you know, who have a secret, it's kind of like a Kabbalistic secret doctrine, which only the spoken, only the high priest can know.

59:15.533 --> 59:21.057
And then you've got the public doctrine that's there and written down in public ways for the stupid people.

59:21.437 --> 59:24.299
And they do the same thing in various, they have similar tricks.

59:25.120 --> 59:33.562
in the secret doctrines of Muhammad for the Gnostic sects of mystery cults embedded within the Islamic world that were working with the Templars.

59:34.103 --> 59:44.225
You got the similar types of things with the Kabbalists, with the secret doctrine of Moses, the spoken word versus what was written down for the special elect in the Jewish world.

59:44.245 --> 59:48.927
And you got certain things within Zoroastrianism and in Buddhism, with esoteric Buddhism.

59:49.887 --> 59:54.390
there's a common thread there too, over many, many, many centuries.

59:54.430 --> 01:00:00.835
So I'm just saying this because there are certain families, sometimes there is rivalry.

01:00:01.095 --> 01:00:14.865
I'm noticing that in my research in history, that certain times when there, when something needs to get done, that is in the interest of the oligarchical system, which is a system premised on master-slave

01:00:16.964 --> 01:00:22.347
dichotomization of how to organize the world, they will work together pretty well.

01:00:23.148 --> 01:00:35.876
When they achieve what they want, and you know that those are the periods that they tend to achieve what they want when there's like as much destruction to the potential that is goodness in opposition to what they represent.

01:00:35.916 --> 01:00:39.238
Whenever they actually get pretty close to that, you tend to get a dark age.

01:00:40.479 --> 01:00:41.079
Certain types of

01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:44.937
like collapses in population levels tend to happen.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:47.818
And then you tend to get backstabbing.

01:00:48.138 --> 01:00:53.500
So some of these families will tend to backstab each other to try to get bigger pieces of the pie.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:01:03.523
So there's like this weird shark parasitical self-sabotage where the parasite can only exploit the host to the point that the host dies.

01:01:04.562 --> 01:01:10.305
Then the parasites realize that there's only so much hope dead host to go around and they start fighting the parasites fight amongst each other.

01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:16.208
That's, that's kind of like some weird mafia gang warfare crap but in a more sophisticated domain.

01:01:20.765 --> 01:01:25.950
Okay, so you brought up Rothschild's technique that reflects something similar to what I brought up with the tulip bubble.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:38.581
It's true, but I would say the Rothschilds, because they came in in the 1750s as players in the thing, like Amschel Rothschild was a coin dealer.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:51.993
recruited to carry out certain tasks by this higher, I hate calling them elite, but I'll just say it for the language, this wannabe elite crowd.

01:01:53.955 --> 01:01:56.977
But I think that from my gathering,

01:01:57.938 --> 01:02:08.142
of information, the Rothschilds don't have the type of causal influence in processes as they are perceived to have.

01:02:08.943 --> 01:02:12.684
They are relatively disposable at the end of the day.

01:02:12.785 --> 01:02:17.367
They're highly useful because Amschel Rothschild, and then he did such a good job.

01:02:17.787 --> 01:02:24.650
And his sons who carried on certain tasks did such a good job for their masters at economic warfare.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:31.718
that they were granted at a certain point a limited, what you might call a mercenary dynasty.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:41.111
So certain guarantees, certain rights and orders were given to the family that would then be granted certain hereditary privileges as there are in other

01:02:42.452 --> 01:02:45.555
Many of them are Jewish families that are granted these limited dynasties.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:49.178
The Bronfmans are a more recent one based in Canada that oversaw the creation of the Mafia.

01:02:50.519 --> 01:03:01.747
But also you got like older ones, like even older than the Rothschilds, like the Montefiore's and the Sassoon's that were employed to manage the Chinese Angola or

01:03:03.149 --> 01:03:06.170
jurisdiction of the world for the on behalf of the British Empire.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:15.972
But it's still not there's still a glass ceiling above which they are not allowed to trespass and contaminate the higher.

01:03:16.072 --> 01:03:20.574
So because they take bloodlines very seriously in this whole thing.

01:03:20.594 --> 01:03:25.435
And they don't like Jewish blood at the end of the day, even though they get people to be Satanists.

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:28.975
even though they were born as a Christian or Jewish or Muslim families.

01:03:29.615 --> 01:03:48.243
And for those who sell their soul in the Faustian bargain, their devotion, they might still be religious, but it's religious devoted to a much darker idea of what God is, that they might call themselves Jewish on the surface, but they're more than happy to kill their own Jewish

01:03:49.178 --> 01:03:52.580
you know, people as they are Africans or anybody.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:03.384
So it's not really they're not really Rothschilds are not really Jews in that sense, nor are just like George Bush or Dick Cheney isn't really a Christian in my mind.

01:04:05.045 --> 01:04:07.166
But this higher thing.

01:04:08.704 --> 01:04:15.193
is tied to these older families and these higher mystery cults that don't do things for money.

01:04:15.633 --> 01:04:23.503
They get stupid people to do things for money, but they're willing to wipe out 95% of their so-called monetary assets in favor of power.

01:04:24.224 --> 01:04:32.430
So that's why they blew up the Tula bubble, that's why they blew up the South Sea bubble, that's why they blew up the bubbles that they built up in the Great Depression or throughout the 19th century America.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:44.639
Every single economic bubble was built up in a similar kind of way, capitalizing on a similar kind of stupidity, a desire by plebeians, dumb people, to get money without working for it or earning it.

01:04:45.239 --> 01:04:45.899
which is gambling.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.403
So they get people in that state of mind, thinking very myopically, not about the consequence of their decisions into the future or their grandkids.

01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:55.085
They're very self-centered as a culture.

01:04:55.545 --> 01:05:08.573
And when we do that, we create these bubbles that could then be organized to blow, which involve wealth transfers, an impoverishment of the people, a greater power to the oligarchy to exercise their will over the system that they wanna manage.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:13.116
And Napoleon, I'll just say this, he was kind of another martial lord in my analysis.

01:05:14.468 --> 01:05:23.976
He did oversee, so, okay, so Napoleon, so my wife's writing a book on this.

01:05:24.377 --> 01:05:26.278
She's actually, we're talking about this a lot.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:39.310
He was assigned to fill a vacuum amidst the failure of France to carry out an American-style revolution in 1789.

01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:54.315
So what could have been, and it could have been, because the American Revolution was made possible by the intervention of many French Republicans, many of those people were organized by Ben Franklin.

01:05:54.415 --> 01:06:08.004
And the plan was after America would be able to stand on its own two feet, that a similar rejection of hereditary power structures could also liberate humanity, starting with France, because France was the most viable nation state of Europe.

01:06:10.339 --> 01:06:31.330
And if it could work there, then you had networks in Poland, in Prussia, in Spain, in Germany, around Friedrich Schiller, in Vienna, around Mozart, who were also ready in the wings to carry on that momentum of establishing

01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:49.327
self represent representative forms of republican government in various countries, rejecting the hereditary idea of might makes right as a as a justification of power, but it didn't work, it was sabotage in France, it turned into a Jacobin terror a lot of us had a lot to do.

01:06:50.248 --> 01:07:10.885
with Freemasonic British-directed operations run by Jeremy Bentham, who was the head of British intelligence, who turned what could have been a viable revolutionary movement into a blood frenzy mob of just head cutting, where the good and the bad alike, all of the allies who made the American Revolution possible, all got their heads cut off, as well as bad guys.

01:07:10.905 --> 01:07:12.586
So good and bad alike got their heads cut off.

01:07:12.626 --> 01:07:15.668
Then there was a vacuum of leadership after a couple of years of civil war.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:29.658
you know, the left and the right, the people who thought with their hearts versus thought with their brains, the Girondins, the brain party versus the Jacobin heart party, which is, again, like the feelers versus the thinkers.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:35.042
They dichotomize that, which is at the heart of today's left-right concepts of party politics.

01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:37.443
They took turns killing each other.

01:07:37.484 --> 01:07:44.769
And then there was such a vacuum that it could only be filled by Napoleon, who at first sold himself as this Republican Roman consul,

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:48.615
But it didn't take him long to declare himself a world empire or emperor.

01:07:49.676 --> 01:07:58.472
And there was an entire, you know, the French Grand Orient Lodge was was purged of any of its Republicans who were all murdered.

01:07:59.338 --> 01:08:25.733
And it became essentially a conduit with the Scottish right at the time that we're both forming around reviving a God-man system of global, like crusader empire around the God-man Napoleon who was trying to create, as my wife Cynthia Chung has brought to my attention, his own French version of an Anglican church that had been created a little bit earlier under Henry VIII.

01:08:26.973 --> 01:08:34.476
And there was this solar deity, Sol Invectus revivalism that had been formally attempted under Louis XIV, who was the Sun King.

01:08:34.496 --> 01:08:40.238
He would like march around acting like he was the Sun God, Louis XIV, that was being revived as a cult around Napoleon.

01:08:42.091 --> 01:08:56.942
So, it could have gone Napoleon's way and if it had I mean Napoleon was a proto fascist, I mean, the idea of purgative violence redemptive violence the purging of mass sacrifice of people in order to create a greater good because these these crusader.

01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:07.795
Christian fascists of that type who pushed things like the Crusades or the Inquisition, which, by the way, the Jacobins were.

01:09:08.996 --> 01:09:11.137
Again, my wife is doing this mind-blowing research.

01:09:11.317 --> 01:09:17.782
She proved that the Jacobins who killed 40,000 people had their heads cut off under the Jacobin terror in France.

01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:22.464
The Jacobins were created as an outgrowth of the Dominican order.

01:09:22.544 --> 01:09:29.909
The Dominicans were the were a cult set up in by certain networks in.

01:09:29.949 --> 01:09:42.876
I won't go into too much detail, but they were set up in in the after the Fourth Crusade, right when Venice took over control, you had the Dominicans and the French and Franciscans as two complementary orders utilizing a right hand, left hand path.

01:09:43.516 --> 01:09:47.619
The Dominicans oversaw the creation and management of the Inquisition.

01:09:48.587 --> 01:09:51.969
which was a hugely destructive operation.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.912
And the Dominicans also oversaw the creation of the Jacobins.

01:09:57.332 --> 01:10:03.655
So again, this is above nation state, this is above which empire was responsible for this or that.

01:10:03.695 --> 01:10:06.897
It's like you're dealing with something above any geographical domain.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:16.883
There's a higher realm of collusion based on certain ideas of what God, the nature of law, governance, man's nature is.

01:10:17.603 --> 01:10:30.555
which they agree upon and act upon systemically over time to get certain effects and utilizing certain factors of the human dichotomy around the individual and the whole.

01:10:31.535 --> 01:10:33.117
The one and the many, as they say, right?

01:10:33.177 --> 01:10:37.721
That every part is a part within a system, but every system is a part within a broader system.

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:41.564
So how do we think of the coexistence of the one and the many?

01:10:42.545 --> 01:10:43.486
And how do we resolve it?

01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:52.074
People like Benjamin Franklin, like Thomas More, like the greatest Renaissance scientists, resolve it in a very organic, natural way.

01:10:53.614 --> 01:11:06.960
And these guys, these more esoteric, pseudo, like neoplatonic, hermetic, kabbalistic freaks, they resolve it in another way, which is a lot less organic and a lot more destructive.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.800
So yeah, that's the thing.

01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:14.883
I don't know if that's too convoluted of a response on Napoleon and the Rothschilds.

01:11:16.909 --> 01:11:17.430
No, it's not.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:24.539
I think it's a good way to transition to so maybe you can expand a little bit on that idea of what

01:11:26.331 --> 01:11:37.656
to compare and contrast the idea of an organic way of lifting up mankind versus a less organic way of governing mankind.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:47.380
So I guess Ben Franklin wasn't interested in using war and famine for population control, whereas these other people are.

01:11:49.147 --> 01:12:01.690
Primarily then is that, would you, would you say that that's the, I see a lot of, of, uh, anti Ben Franklin things that try to tell stories about how he was a member of a death cult here, a death cult there.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:03.610
And actually he's a real bad guy.

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:12.332
Um, what you're seeming to tell me is that number one, he was interested in, in using money in a public good way.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:17.433
Um, which up until this point, I think a lot of the people that were, um,

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:25.711
that are considered founding fathers understood something about how money could be weaponized against people.

01:12:28.193 --> 01:12:40.980
So, I mean, I'm still trying to get to the stage now where this kind of history informs our current plan or our current, you know, what should we do next?

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.941
What should we teach our kids?

01:12:48.194 --> 01:12:49.855
Yeah, I guess that's kind of where I'm at.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:59.660
I mean, you, in a lot of ways, if you're in Canada, I feel like you're in a far darker place than I am, and maybe I'm just kidding myself.

01:13:00.521 --> 01:13:06.544
I've got to convince people that this might not be really good American history, right?

01:13:06.644 --> 01:13:07.605
That's what I have to do.

01:13:07.685 --> 01:13:12.207
That's my idea, or at least, I don't know why this book is free on Amazon right now.

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:14.869
I don't really get it, other than I have to assume that

01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:20.985
there isn't as much truth in it as it was as it was as it was wrapped up to be i don't know i mean

01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:24.277
I'm trying to get my head around what's going on here.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:25.917
OK, all right.

01:13:26.057 --> 01:13:26.457
OK, OK.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:27.678
So so I hear you.

01:13:27.698 --> 01:13:28.958
I feel I feel for you, man.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:32.880
And I, I, I have Whitney Webb's books and I've read them.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.480
I've done reports on the reviews.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.242
I interviewed Whitney on her books and I overall like the books.

01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:44.444
OK, I would still say that I, I, I encourage people to read those books.

01:13:45.524 --> 01:13:51.186
However, I could see as well how they might be useful.

01:13:52.355 --> 01:14:01.483
for the oligarchy in some way, because they're quite good at creating a mapping of the evolution of organized crime.

01:14:02.697 --> 01:14:09.961
but they're really not, they're very weak on identifying anything higher than the organized crime.

01:14:09.981 --> 01:14:20.127
Like the things I've been alluding to, there is a discoverable higher process that oversaw the management of the Bronfmans, of the Mayor Lansky operation.

01:14:20.147 --> 01:14:31.433
Like there's a very identifiable, discoverable organizational structure with an associated set of ideas that are wrong about these big questions of metaphysics.

01:14:32.173 --> 01:14:36.094
which are again, anybody who puts their mind to that research will make those discoveries.

01:14:36.494 --> 01:14:38.875
It's not just like, right, right.

01:14:39.015 --> 01:14:59.262
And also, there's something that because when you go there, you start seeing that there is an identifiable discoverable process and set of ideas and idea content represented by individuals who make institutional changes sometimes if they think really good on a very high level, which

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:03.513
that that oligarchy is afraid of.

01:15:03.773 --> 01:15:23.124
They're deathly afraid of the existentially afraid of something human that is done by human beings acting on natural law, which I think Whitney didn't do a great job at identifying that opposing structure that is anti oligarchical, which has pulled the rug from under its feet.

01:15:24.785 --> 01:15:40.186
Every so often, there are these inspired lessons that we could learn from on how creative flanking maneuvers were able to occur such that things like the League of Nations attempted a one-world government that I alluded to earlier didn't succeed when the intention was not for it to fail in 1922.

01:15:42.517 --> 01:15:50.242
It's not like the oligarchy wanted to fail at their agenda for a one-world government managed by an oligarchical eugenics-based death cult, which they almost got in 1922.

01:15:50.842 --> 01:15:53.504
It took a lot of sacrifice.

01:15:53.544 --> 01:16:08.052
A lot of people had to get murdered to prevent or to stop their example and strategic capabilities from continuing to sabotage new world order plans.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:16.797
And from that I include Warren Harding, the president in the United States, who also was a key figure sabotaging it.

01:16:17.577 --> 01:16:24.480
A lot of Americans who I outline in volume two of my book series on the clash of the two Americas were fighters.

01:16:26.854 --> 01:16:49.394
Figures like Walter Rathenau, the foreign minister of Germany, you could look at him, read his writings, look at how he maneuvered against the League of Nations with collaborators who thought on a very similar level within Russia, within China around Sun Yat-sen, the first Republican president who was a major political player and leader within the nationalist cause within China, who was all negotiating.

01:16:49.715 --> 01:16:51.957
They were all like working to a certain degree together.

01:16:51.977 --> 01:16:53.078
There's good conspiracies.

01:16:53.738 --> 01:16:55.539
How does that, can I stop you for a second?

01:16:55.579 --> 01:17:02.423
How does that, for me, as an American, I have a hard time now, you use the word Republican to refer to somebody in China.

01:17:02.483 --> 01:17:05.465
How should I hear you using the word Republican?

01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:15.026
Oh, it's because the 1911 revolution against the dynastic system in China, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by a Republican.

01:17:15.086 --> 01:17:17.407
It was called the People's Republic of China.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:24.289
So the Republic of China was set up by Sun Yat-sen, who was a Christian who studied in Hawaii in the 1880s.

01:17:24.329 --> 01:17:29.570
He had allies of Abraham Lincoln who were training a lot of young men.

01:17:35.892 --> 01:17:42.136
around the ideals of what constitutional banking, what the nature of geopolitics was.

01:17:42.196 --> 01:17:48.499
And he was a star student who became a leader of the Republican cause inside of China.

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:52.021
And he oversaw a big chunk of that fight.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.842
And again, there's good and bad people alike.

01:17:53.962 --> 01:18:01.026
Some people were trying to turn China into a color revolution to just weaken China as a viable nation state and create some form of

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:04.886
You know, local control fascist structure.

01:18:04.926 --> 01:18:07.410
Some people wanted that were tied to the city of London.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:18.145
Other people actually had a noble cause that all revolutions are sort of mixed their mixtures of people who are doing things for the right reasons versus the wrong reasons.

01:18:18.906 --> 01:18:22.827
And there's a battle over like this world, these different opposing worldviews.

01:18:22.927 --> 01:18:23.748
And it's not Manichaean.

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:24.728
It's not like this.

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:29.709
Oh, you believe in this universal good versus evil as two opposing but equal forces.

01:18:29.749 --> 01:18:33.611
And a lot of people have accused this type of analysis that I'm giving as being Manichaean.

01:18:33.631 --> 01:18:38.972
And it's not that it's like there's there's right and wrong and certain ideas are right and others wrong.

01:18:39.012 --> 01:18:40.053
But Sun Yat-sen

01:18:41.033 --> 01:18:42.093
I believe was a very right.

01:18:42.633 --> 01:18:45.774
He had very right ideas in alignment with natural law.

01:18:46.374 --> 01:18:49.595
And he was the first president of Republican China in 1911.

01:18:49.675 --> 01:19:09.541
It what it didn't last long because there were a lot of warlords and and other things with a lot of fingers in the pie and a lot of foreign powers that were trying to take control of a week in China after the revolution that had formally gotten a lot of control during the what you know, it was still a century of humiliation after all.

01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:24.251
They had the concessions from the 1899 Boxer Rebellion, whereby like, you know, seven different European powers got control of different areas of China after the rebellion of the boxers, which was, again, another sort of inside job.

01:19:24.271 --> 01:19:34.579
So you had a lot of things that a lot of complexity and that Sun Yat-sen was contending with corruption within his own governing class, as well as foreign powers manipulating it.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:35.680
But he was good.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:36.260
He was solid.

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.262
And he modeled his three principles of the people.

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:46.691
He wrote several books which are really worth studying, highly readable books from 1918 to 1924 when he died.

01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:57.603
His Three Principles of the People was based upon Lincoln's principles of governance for, by, and of the people, his international development of China,

01:19:59.104 --> 01:20:07.047
book, which is a wonderful book on how to actually end poverty and create a culture of citizenry based upon large scale thinking of big projects.

01:20:07.688 --> 01:20:09.508
China had a lot of potential but a ton of poverty.

01:20:09.528 --> 01:20:15.531
They were a third world country abused by foreign powers for generations.

01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:22.596
So that requires new technologies, new training centers, new educational corridors, solving big problems.

01:20:22.616 --> 01:20:29.521
You have to give people a mission that is both viable and possible and necessary.

01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:33.103
So his book... Can I ask?

01:20:33.444 --> 01:20:35.365
I'm not a China scholar at all.

01:20:35.465 --> 01:20:37.847
And sometimes I hear it like this and sometimes I don't.

01:20:37.887 --> 01:20:38.908
I noticed that you said it.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:44.052
that China was abused by other places for centuries.

01:20:44.612 --> 01:20:57.463
I have a hard time understanding what that means, because in order to get to China, you have to have a navy and something that they want, because the

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.101
The culture remained impenetrable to anyone from the West.

01:21:02.301 --> 01:21:03.162
I mean, in theory.

01:21:04.622 --> 01:21:08.324
So what do you mean by abused, like just not treated with respect?

01:21:09.004 --> 01:21:11.545
It's not like they could go enslave them or something like that.

01:21:11.585 --> 01:21:14.146
What do you mean when you say they abused for centuries?

01:21:15.486 --> 01:21:17.127
OK, well, starting in the 17.

01:21:19.878 --> 01:21:32.269
Actually, in the late 1690s, the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, but especially the British, made their presence in India known.

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:34.551
They started taking control of big chunks of India.

01:21:35.451 --> 01:21:39.595
It took them about a century to fully infest, control a new Brahmin class,

01:21:40.856 --> 01:21:52.603
You know, they had to corrupt a local overlord class of elitists that would then organize organized crime systems on behalf of a ruling power far removed from India.

01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:56.205
OK, so that's what they do in every country they want.

01:21:56.285 --> 01:22:07.031
That's how only the 10000 British were able to control whatever 300, 400 million Indians was by getting the Indians to self-control, utilizing their caste system.

01:22:07.071 --> 01:22:07.231
Right.

01:22:08.359 --> 01:22:27.735
Now, a big chunk of that was India and China in the 1780s, 1790s still had GDPs that were far more advanced than Europe or the American colonies as far as powers of productivity, luxury quality of education.

01:22:27.896 --> 01:22:30.598
It was quite astoundingly advanced.

01:22:31.098 --> 01:22:32.479
That had to be destroyed economically.

01:22:33.277 --> 01:22:45.445
So the way that they did that, after they got control from a certain political corruptive level, building up a deep state structure, you know, inside of India, they went to war with Indian textile manufacturing.

01:22:45.485 --> 01:22:52.250
You know, like the stories, horrific stories of the British overseeing the cutting off of the hands of all the Indian textile workers.

01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:55.272
They couldn't do their basic training.

01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:55.853
They couldn't work.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:23:03.220
They systematically destroyed the factories that would produce textiles so that Britain could get control of the manufacturing.

01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:05.943
It wasn't like honest free trade competition here.

01:23:05.963 --> 01:23:08.645
It's just like smoldering, you know.

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:12.750
So they did that and then they said, well, look, you got to make money, don't you, India?

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:15.032
You got to pay your overhead costs of a nation.

01:23:15.092 --> 01:23:17.795
Well, you got a lot of, you got a great climate here for opium.

01:23:18.986 --> 01:23:27.791
You can make opium, you know, you make tea and opium and, you know, we'll sell you, we'll buy your tea, we'll buy your opium, but we won't use your we'll use some of your opium.

01:23:27.831 --> 01:23:31.052
But most of your opium, we'll find a new market for that.

01:23:31.533 --> 01:23:32.253
And that new market.

01:23:33.394 --> 01:23:35.415
The main the main market was China.

01:23:36.195 --> 01:23:45.140
So in the case of China, there was a certain arrogance because of this closed culture that that was kind of afraid of going outside of itself.

01:23:46.209 --> 01:23:55.799
There was, I think, a certain self-delusion by the imperial culture of 18th century China that was like, we're the middle kingdom.

01:23:56.921 --> 01:23:58.062
Nobody's better than us.

01:23:58.202 --> 01:24:04.169
And they couldn't even conceive of the level of military technology, how much more it had advanced.

01:24:07.052 --> 01:24:10.295
The British tried to use their tricks to get into China the way they did successfully to India.

01:24:11.135 --> 01:24:11.616
Didn't work.

01:24:12.076 --> 01:24:17.121
They couldn't like seduce their way in easily through economic incentives.

01:24:17.702 --> 01:24:18.683
They're like, OK, we'll be back.

01:24:19.463 --> 01:24:19.964
We'll be back.

01:24:20.805 --> 01:24:25.169
And they slowly built up an economy of opium.

01:24:25.309 --> 01:24:26.530
So like, well, free trade here.

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:27.951
Let's let's start a little free trade deal.

01:24:28.732 --> 01:24:33.423
We'll have some little ports that you will manage, but they're little ports.

01:24:33.463 --> 01:24:37.493
Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, negligible.

01:24:37.513 --> 01:24:38.054
Don't worry about it.

01:24:39.046 --> 01:24:41.428
Cigars, whiskey, nothing big, right?

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:43.189
Nothing big, yeah.

01:24:43.249 --> 01:24:45.170
Some alcohol, some drugs.

01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.412
We've seen this used before in a variety of ways.

01:24:47.432 --> 01:24:50.194
And that slowly created a culture of addiction.

01:24:50.974 --> 01:24:56.518
And most importantly, where there's addiction and vice, you have organized crime built up.

01:24:56.578 --> 01:25:01.801
And the British, with their Freemasonic outfits, like Lord Bowering was a big one who oversaw the growth of

01:25:02.782 --> 01:25:10.016
oriental Freemasonry, things like the Green Gang were groomed by the way that the Brofman's were later groomed in Canada and the United States.

01:25:11.055 --> 01:25:21.245
Keep in mind Samuel Bronfman was inducted into the, he was made a Knight of the Order of Bath, a very, very high level knighthood overseen by the British monarchy.

01:25:21.265 --> 01:25:32.136
They did similar things with wannabe local house slaves inside of China that then penetrated the bureaucracy, that penetrated the imperial class.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:37.800
that were always working on behalf, not of their own people, but of the British.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:47.162
And it got so bad by the 1830s that you had an advisor to an emperor who finally convinced the emperor to burn all the opium.

01:25:47.522 --> 01:25:56.203
So he passed a law saying, okay, we're gonna use national sovereignty here to pass a decision over free trade rules that we've signed with the British empire on opium.

01:25:56.844 --> 01:25:58.764
And he basically commanded all of the opium to be burned.

01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:03.092
There's a big war for a couple of years within China.

01:26:03.673 --> 01:26:08.875
A lot of people had their whole fortunes invested in this relationship.

01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:10.835
They didn't go easily.

01:26:11.616 --> 01:26:19.739
And Britain came and basically said with warships, well, if you don't want to honor the free trade policy honorably, then it'll be war.

01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:21.900
And they carried out the first opium war.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.522
And that destroyed a devastated China.

01:26:26.503 --> 01:26:39.034
That's when you had certain concessions where Britain got control officially now of Hong Kong, of certain areas of China and certain rights to have full unilateral say over economic policies of China.

01:26:40.515 --> 01:26:42.257
Full 100% drugs at that point from the 1850s, 1860s.

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:43.778
And on top of that,

01:26:47.745 --> 01:26:54.231
building up to the second opium war, because this happened a second time where China was completely wrecked at this point.

01:26:54.331 --> 01:26:57.374
Their economy was in shambles, corruption endemic.

01:26:57.454 --> 01:27:03.199
You had a foreign directed fifth column managing the drug trade inside of China.

01:27:04.076 --> 01:27:09.101
They said, you know, we don't want they tried to stop it in 1860, right when the US Civil War was about to kick off.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:13.365
And they had a problem because they were even weaker.

01:27:13.865 --> 01:27:28.479
So but at the same time, they had a civil war inside of China that was going on for 15 years, which is a civil war called the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which was a pseudo Christian cult of militarists that were created by

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:35.783
a dude who got some sort of proto MK ultra brainwashing by some Jesuit missionaries in Southern China.

01:27:36.243 --> 01:27:55.471
He was like a failed school teacher who was all of a sudden convinced after a couple of years of training by these missionaries, British and American missionaries, that he was the Messiah's brother and would oversee a new, what's called a new kingdom that he was mandated called the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which required the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 17, it is 1857.

01:27:58.192 --> 01:28:02.194
Um, so this was a brutal, they had 30 million people supporting his army.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:04.175
Um, it nearly won in Britain.

01:28:04.215 --> 01:28:07.196
That was one of the ways they, they were able to win the second opium wars.

01:28:07.216 --> 01:28:21.582
They told the, the, the Chinese, Hey, if you don't submit to all of our demands and just give up and allow unbounded, uh, opium again, and, and, oh, oh, by the way, give us, give us Hong Kong for, uh, whatever, uh,

01:28:22.853 --> 01:28:23.393
a century.

01:28:24.975 --> 01:28:38.724
If you don't do that, we will recognize the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as the only legitimate government, which the same thing that they were saying to Lincoln at the time, they were prepared, the British and the French were prepared to recognize the Confederates as the only legitimate government of the United States.

01:28:39.625 --> 01:28:44.168
So they're using the same technique at the exact same time on both sides of the world to destroy two rivals.

01:28:47.202 --> 01:28:48.182
which worked.

01:28:48.562 --> 01:28:50.203
The Chinese government said, OK, we give up.

01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:51.483
You win the Opium War again.

01:28:52.223 --> 01:28:54.784
And it took them another few years to get rid of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

01:28:54.824 --> 01:28:55.884
But they were totally wet.

01:28:56.144 --> 01:29:01.065
Like this is where they became one of the poorest countries in the world for a sustained period.

01:29:01.965 --> 01:29:05.026
And there were small little efforts to to get out of it.

01:29:05.086 --> 01:29:10.507
But it was it was, again, the level of poverty cannibalism under the control of the British Empire.

01:29:10.547 --> 01:29:13.488
The British had full control of the Board of Control, the Board of Trade.

01:29:14.448 --> 01:29:19.769
So the Chinese couldn't even manage their own income from taxation on tariffs on other things.

01:29:19.789 --> 01:29:20.970
They couldn't, it was all British.

01:29:21.370 --> 01:29:22.610
All the way up until 1950.

01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:33.073
One of the things that I hear as I'm listening to you that I realize now is a big problem with my model of history is I don't understand how many people were involved.

01:29:33.413 --> 01:29:37.334
You think now of the world covered in people and whatever, but back then,

01:29:38.969 --> 01:29:45.076
It's harder for me to conceptualize how decentralized China was as a nation.

01:29:45.136 --> 01:29:52.785
It's hard for me to imagine how organized Britain might have been as a colonizing nation and a navy.

01:29:54.119 --> 01:29:58.000
All of these things are very hard to imagine, I think, and put in perspective.

01:29:58.501 --> 01:29:59.821
So that's why I asked the question.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.142
I hope I didn't sound too naive.

01:30:01.182 --> 01:30:02.762
I just wanted to make sure you explained it.

01:30:03.202 --> 01:30:04.483
And you really nailed it.

01:30:04.743 --> 01:30:07.544
That really helped a lot for me to understand that.

01:30:08.044 --> 01:30:21.109
And what really clicked is when I realized that, wait, remember, we're going back a long ways when, of course, even communicating between parts of China would have taken a very long time.

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:24.170
It's a whole different world, of course.

01:30:26.271 --> 01:30:26.831
Gee whiz.

01:30:28.812 --> 01:30:31.493
But we still are stuck in 1857.

01:30:33.493 --> 01:30:37.755
Now, how does this history inform you as a citizen of China?

01:30:37.815 --> 01:30:42.257
How should this history inform me as a citizen of the United States?

01:30:42.297 --> 01:30:46.338
How can we work together to overthrow the oligarchy?

01:30:50.478 --> 01:30:55.464
I mean, the Chinese are the Chinese.

01:30:55.645 --> 01:30:58.048
We're on our part in from our culture.

01:30:58.108 --> 01:31:02.093
But I mean, yeah, we have common denominators and all these things, right?

01:31:02.133 --> 01:31:02.613
It's always like,

01:31:03.544 --> 01:31:04.645
What's the same and what's different?

01:31:06.746 --> 01:31:08.807
And which is sort of what you're asking.

01:31:09.347 --> 01:31:27.318
Look, I think that the best thing about Sun Yat-sen is that he understood that there was a higher complementarity between a certain philosophy of Confucianism and a certain philosophy of Christianity based upon certain ideas like

01:31:28.138 --> 01:31:46.433
Tianming, you know, the idea that you could judge human laws by virtue of some idea of the laws of heaven and laws that are human made that are in harmony with the laws of heaven are just and good and should be thus followed and acted upon and improved upon and laws that are out of whack.

01:31:46.473 --> 01:31:47.094
You see this in St.

01:31:47.154 --> 01:31:52.959
Augustine's writings, you know, laws that are out of whack with said natural law.

01:31:54.495 --> 01:32:03.958
should not be followed, are forms of violence, if the intention behind the law being created is to hurt, enslave, to infringe upon all of our inalienable rights.

01:32:03.998 --> 01:32:15.782
And Sun Yat-sen, the first president of China, who's again celebrated today, both in Taiwan, but also in mainland China, he's celebrated as a great hero and a great founding father on both sides of the divide.

01:32:16.822 --> 01:32:23.405
which is interesting as an irony, though most Americans don't even know of this of this of this incredible human being.

01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:24.426
They haven't read his writings.

01:32:24.466 --> 01:32:24.846
They don't know.

01:32:24.966 --> 01:32:31.509
But there's this unifying quality that that he lived for and I think was murdered for.

01:32:31.529 --> 01:32:32.349
I think he was poisoned.

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:35.391
But Lincoln also, who he studied, was also murdered for.

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:40.793
And when you look at it like the Green Gang, that whole Freemasonic drug

01:32:44.045 --> 01:32:52.849
infrastructure that had been built up by the British and the Anglo-American, because also a lot of these American families were working with the British at the opium trade in the 19th century.

01:32:52.869 --> 01:32:55.530
The British created the HSBC Bank.

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:58.191
To this very day, it's the world's major drug running bank.

01:32:58.251 --> 01:32:59.091
It was found guilty in 2012.

01:33:00.692 --> 01:33:08.656
by Senator Carl Levin, who did a year's worth of hearings on HSBC's money laundering of of international narcotics and funding of terrorism.

01:33:08.796 --> 01:33:09.697
And he found them guilty.

01:33:09.977 --> 01:33:11.938
And they had an auditor situated.

01:33:11.958 --> 01:33:16.480
I mean, one guy overseeing their headquarters, their headquarters in London.

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:27.385
They were created in 1865 to oversee the opium wars with the facilitators within the Green Gang, British Oriental Freemasonry, Freemasonic outfits inside of China.

01:33:27.425 --> 01:33:27.926
Now, these things

01:33:28.906 --> 01:33:41.351
After the Chinese civil war between Chiang Kai-shek and what's called the Comin Tang Party and versus Mao and the New Communist Party, which is full, it was a mixed bag.

01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:48.234
Both of them at different times had good people and different times had really bad people, often at the same time within both.

01:33:48.394 --> 01:33:49.994
There's a mixture of things in everything.

01:33:50.955 --> 01:33:56.657
And this reminds me that I do need to get back to the the observation you had on Franklin and the slanders

01:33:57.245 --> 01:33:59.046
on Franklin as part of a death cult.

01:33:59.126 --> 01:34:02.629
I do want to say something about that because it's really important that ties into what I'm saying.

01:34:05.771 --> 01:34:12.036
They ended up getting their base of operations after the Civil War was Taiwan.

01:34:12.736 --> 01:34:20.582
So the Kuomintang became the center of global narcotic operations on behalf of MI6 and the CIA throughout the entirety of the Cold War.

01:34:20.622 --> 01:34:25.025
So Taiwan, Hong Kong, which was still controlled by the British, still has

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:31.631
British nationals controlling the Supreme Court of Hong Kong even today.

01:34:31.651 --> 01:34:38.577
HSBC still runs and prints one third of Hong Kong's money today.

01:34:39.058 --> 01:34:43.962
So there's still this foreign directed fifth column that manages global drugs.

01:34:44.343 --> 01:34:47.986
The Kuomintang also had heavy operations after the Chinese Civil War.

01:34:48.687 --> 01:34:51.690
When they lost that, they went to Laos, Cambodia,

01:34:52.759 --> 01:34:57.985
big chunks of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and that became part of the Silver Triangle.

01:34:58.045 --> 01:35:03.711
So Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau as well, which is Portuguese colony, became another center of drugs.

01:35:04.111 --> 01:35:13.521
Shanghai was a center of foreign directed billionaires that were still built up, trying to work to sabotage China on behalf of people like David Rockefeller, later on Kissinger.

01:35:15.737 --> 01:35:27.960
And then, you know, and then you had this other grouping within that was always working with the CIA, which is, again, CIA was a foreign directed outfit created in 1947 after the first U.S.

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:37.082
intelligence organization, the OSS, was purged of their patriots and reconstituted under British British control and British direction under Truman.

01:35:37.682 --> 01:35:39.323
So this thing directed and controlled.

01:35:40.223 --> 01:35:42.828
drugs, and the entire black market operation.

01:35:42.848 --> 01:35:47.818
So what they did as an opium war to the Chinese in the 19th century, they did everywhere.

01:35:48.655 --> 01:35:53.018
in the Cold War, they created a drug culture, top-down control.

01:35:53.058 --> 01:35:55.860
They had outfits, obviously, into South America.

01:35:56.060 --> 01:36:10.151
A lot of them worked with Nazis that were never punished, but that were given new jobs by Allen Dulles and the CIA to oversee these IMF-directed right-wing governments all over Latin America, like Pinochet, but there's many others along Latin America, Ibero-American governments.

01:36:10.751 --> 01:36:12.031
that would also then oversee.

01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:20.733
On the other hand, the reaction to some of these right-wing governments were also controlled by the same Nazis and same intelligence agencies.

01:36:20.753 --> 01:36:24.474
So they would create this hard right and then this hard left reaction.

01:36:24.554 --> 01:36:35.256
And the things like in the Colombian FARC guerrillas, which were seen as like anti-imperial fighters against right-wing, were also being bankrolled by the same London and Wall Street bankers.

01:36:36.095 --> 01:36:46.464
and producing the narcotics, the cocaine, that would then be processed through the Wall Street and City of London banks that were part of managing and keeping this global crime apparatus alive.

01:36:47.065 --> 01:36:52.950
So it's a fake gang counter gang operation, a fake dichotomy that they always played since the French Revolution, right?

01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:54.831
Get people on an emotional,

01:36:55.812 --> 01:37:10.718
raw revolutionary vibe, right, without thinking, and then you get a reaction of total barbarian logic of thinking and imposing order onto chaos through the reaction of the right with no heart.

01:37:10.778 --> 01:37:13.079
Heart and emotions contaminate thinking and logic.

01:37:13.139 --> 01:37:13.239
So

01:37:14.019 --> 01:37:14.619
heart is bad.

01:37:14.639 --> 01:37:25.144
And then the people are like, the other, the masses are typically, you know, peasant type people who think and feel, they feel, they think with their feelings, and they're thus manipulated in their own way.

01:37:25.164 --> 01:37:26.605
And they did, it's how they always do this.

01:37:27.345 --> 01:37:37.470
So all that to say, China, I think, have done better than we have in recent decades in dealing with this foreign directed parasite, with its deep penetrations

01:37:38.894 --> 01:37:39.735
into their society.

01:37:39.895 --> 01:38:02.568
It doesn't mean that they don't have a deep state, they have a deep state, but they've done a better, their nationalist traditions and those representing the authentic, the better China, I think have done a much better job at extracting those foreign directed deep state traders than we have, who have really allowed this thing to take over JFK's murdered body.

01:38:03.662 --> 01:38:14.428
Um, that could just be, uh, the, the luxury of having their own, um, language and writing and makes it much harder for, for the kind of subversion that is very easy to do.

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:19.171
If you all share the same languages and same media and this kind of thing.

01:38:19.331 --> 01:38:19.511
Yeah.

01:38:20.031 --> 01:38:20.832
Um, yeah, possibly.

01:38:20.892 --> 01:38:24.814
I mean, most, most Americans speak English though, and they still get subverted pretty easily.

01:38:27.304 --> 01:38:28.265
No, that's what I'm arguing.

01:38:28.605 --> 01:38:36.993
I think that the Chinese have this extra layer of bullshit detector that even if you don't speak Chinese well enough, you can't bullshit them, right?

01:38:37.094 --> 01:38:45.482
I mean, so it's kind of like how it worked in Holland for a little while for me was, it works now here because of us living in Holland.

01:38:45.522 --> 01:38:51.548
My family and I can walk around and start speaking Dutch in front of people and suddenly have a secret conversation and it's handy sometimes.

01:38:52.128 --> 01:39:00.774
if my kids are being bad, or if I wanna say something not polite about a person that's standing right next to me, I'll just start speaking Dutch and throw it in the middle.

01:39:01.495 --> 01:39:11.221
And so I'm just saying that from the perspective of subversion, having a second or third language, nevermind an impenetrable one.

01:39:12.142 --> 01:39:16.085
And that's what I think some of these languages qualify as impenetrable.

01:39:16.125 --> 01:39:17.526
A Westerner is never going to

01:39:18.366 --> 01:39:24.812
as an adult or a young adult learn Chinese to the extent to which they could completely fool someone.

01:39:24.852 --> 01:39:26.033
That's really hard.

01:39:26.934 --> 01:39:28.195
I'm not saying it hasn't been done.

01:39:28.235 --> 01:39:29.116
I'm sure it's been done.

01:39:29.156 --> 01:39:29.857
Don't get me wrong.

01:39:29.877 --> 01:39:31.258
Yeah, but it's a lot more difficult.

01:39:31.378 --> 01:39:32.059
It's a lot more difficult.

01:39:32.079 --> 01:39:34.060
Yeah, that's a good, it's a good, good observation.

01:39:34.321 --> 01:39:34.981
Good observation.

01:39:35.241 --> 01:39:35.382
Yeah.

01:39:36.002 --> 01:39:39.404
And even I agree, but so let me I have this thing underlined.

01:39:39.424 --> 01:39:41.745
I said I underlined it a couple of times.

01:39:41.785 --> 01:39:49.089
And the reason why I underlined it, I want to preface it is because there's this interesting video that's been circulating over the last few months.

01:39:49.289 --> 01:40:00.415
And it is a video of Senator Joe Biden trying to interrogate a then Justice Thomas, who's

01:40:01.736 --> 01:40:13.144
nominated for the Supreme Court, and he's talking about natural law, and he says, you and I both know what we're talking about when I say natural law, but none of these people around here probably know what we're talking about.

01:40:13.564 --> 01:40:26.292
And you've mentioned natural law a couple times in the context of how to think about how some of these people or these ideas should be thought of in the context of, can you give us a brief

01:40:27.401 --> 01:40:35.146
idea of what you mean by natural law in terms of history and what these people in history have thought of as natural law or referred to as natural law?

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:37.127
Yeah, for sure.

01:40:39.029 --> 01:40:53.918
There's laws humans make, and then there's laws that are already there in nature even before there was humans, and that exert influence over human life, but all life, again, before there was humans.

01:40:53.958 --> 01:40:54.799
So we've got certain

01:40:57.449 --> 01:41:13.962
cycles of nature, certain processes, you know, there's photosynthesis in plants, chlorophyll, does it stay, and the planets find certain orbits that are on ellipses around a foci, and the galaxy is organized by many of these suns that have certain rhythms to it, there's certain structure to it.

01:41:16.144 --> 01:41:17.364
molecules of water.

01:41:17.464 --> 01:41:24.127
If you believe in occult mysteries and things like that though, then natural law means something completely different then, right?

01:41:27.268 --> 01:41:30.009
So what are we referring to then?

01:41:30.289 --> 01:41:40.212
Is that already a sort of semantic trick when we say natural law because it all depends on the context in which that and who's using the words?

01:41:41.496 --> 01:41:49.525
Yeah, always everything is context really like that's that's I guess the problem with nominalism is a lot of people have been trained in this.

01:41:50.406 --> 01:41:59.356
I think it's a it's a it's a destructive way of thinking that's just endemic in our school system around the idea that the definition of something to know something is to read the definition of it.

01:42:00.077 --> 01:42:06.321
and memorize it, whether it's in an encyclopedia or or in a dictionary, just get the definition, then you know the thing.

01:42:06.361 --> 01:42:11.383
And it's like, well, last time I looked at Wikipedia, there was like 38 different definitions of truth.

01:42:12.064 --> 01:42:17.167
So it's like, well, whoa, you know, kind of arbitrary, you know, if it so in.

01:42:19.608 --> 01:42:28.952
But I guess part of what I'm fighting against is the very imprecise use of the English language to distort biological truth.

01:42:29.573 --> 01:42:39.838
So the entire academic scientific field is broken because people don't use language in a way that is intent on accuracy.

01:42:43.419 --> 01:42:49.743
It's designed to imply potential or imply achievement that wasn't achieved.

01:42:49.803 --> 01:43:00.490
And so for me, one of the battles I feel like I'm fighting is to try and restore this kind of mutual understanding about what we use hammers for and what we use wrenches for.

01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:04.172
And the fact of the matter is, is that if you have metric and you have

01:43:04.792 --> 01:43:07.794
English wrenches, then you shouldn't use the metric on English bolts.

01:43:08.335 --> 01:43:11.077
And we can all agree that that would be the way to do it.

01:43:11.117 --> 01:43:21.924
And I think when we use language, one of the reasons why we're so inept right now of getting ourselves out of the cave we're in is because we don't have a language to pull each other out with.

01:43:21.944 --> 01:43:32.111
Because when you throw down the ladder of Republican and natural law and a couple other terms, and they don't mean what I think they mean, then we're not having a conversation.

01:43:32.151 --> 01:43:34.192
And that's really tough at this stage.

01:43:34.472 --> 01:43:35.233
I know, dude.

01:43:35.253 --> 01:43:39.235
No, I've heard you speak about, you know, just the terminology like like inoculation.

01:43:39.275 --> 01:43:47.681
I've heard you speak really give some interesting presentations about how the idea of what inoculation means today when people use the word is very different from what it meant a century ago.

01:43:47.701 --> 01:43:51.183
And I mean, it's the same word.

01:43:52.184 --> 01:43:54.926
And yet the meaning is different.

01:43:54.946 --> 01:43:57.187
And I think that context is everything, right?

01:43:57.207 --> 01:44:03.692
Like it's only when you like the human language will always be finite and have these problems because language is still

01:44:05.933 --> 01:44:10.236
It's a finite system that's rooted in certain, it's kind of like math.

01:44:10.396 --> 01:44:21.624
It's a set of symbols that we created that we attribute to processes that are out of ourselves subjectively that we're trying to map as we go through life.

01:44:22.665 --> 01:44:31.293
you know, depending on what phase of human history or what part of the world we were born into, the symbols might be different, more enriched, more simple, but we have the same impulses.

01:44:31.493 --> 01:44:33.815
Have you followed this new guy?

01:44:33.855 --> 01:44:34.476
What is his name?

01:44:34.536 --> 01:44:41.843
Terrence something or other, this guy who's been on Rogan and all these shows that starts with the premise that one times one is actually two.

01:44:42.483 --> 01:44:44.165
And that's what's broken with our math.

01:44:44.225 --> 01:44:46.067
And then he can't really, of course,

01:44:47.233 --> 01:44:51.678
like play that forward into how that fixes all of mathematics and makes it better.

01:44:52.999 --> 01:44:59.947
But it's just the idea that it's not sufficient for us to say that 4 plus 1 is now 5.

01:45:01.148 --> 01:45:02.229
Sorry, what did we say?

01:45:02.249 --> 01:45:06.614
2 plus 2 is 5 is what they were saying like a year and a half ago or something like this.

01:45:08.214 --> 01:45:21.419
Again, mathematics is one of these places where the universality of these ideas is more bound by a mutual understanding, whereas in language,

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:39.529
which is, I guess, more or less completely subjective, if they take away shades out of our crayon box, we can't make the same kinds of pictures we used to be able to make when we had 64 crayons, and now we only have eight.

01:45:40.029 --> 01:45:45.813
And so for me, I really think as a historian, it would be,

01:45:47.205 --> 01:46:04.522
I mean, I just, I want to learn so much about how these concepts have changed over the years and how they have been weaponized against us, so much so that we now have a Republican Party and a Democratic Party, and those two words don't mean anything relative to those two people groups.

01:46:05.643 --> 01:46:06.483
Yeah.

01:46:06.844 --> 01:46:08.365
I think that, like people,

01:46:10.373 --> 01:46:13.794
I think they really need to train themselves to be context oriented.

01:46:14.054 --> 01:46:19.135
I encourage people to read, to just practice and exercise what I'm talking about.

01:46:19.796 --> 01:46:26.297
Whenever people write to me about my research methods, I say read some platonic dialogues.

01:46:26.698 --> 01:46:35.100
Plato's dialogues are really nice exercises because they don't give you crystallized answers to anything, but they're setting out to do at the beginning of the dialogue.

01:46:36.321 --> 01:46:50.254
And whether it's the Gorgias or the Philibus dialogue on how do you judge good and evil, the Gorgias on how do you live a good life, the Republic on what is justice, or whether it's piety and from the euthyphro or whatever.

01:46:50.274 --> 01:46:55.858
There's always a subject of, okay, there's this big idea that's tied to an idea of natural law.

01:46:56.819 --> 01:47:04.047
Like a law that is created by God that's built into the fabric of physical space-time that we need to understand, but it's not so simple.

01:47:05.609 --> 01:47:06.329
So what is it?

01:47:06.429 --> 01:47:13.997
And then it's like testing out different hypotheses about what it is, and then gaming them out to see, well, based upon evidence,

01:47:14.898 --> 01:47:19.841
Let's see where your hypothesis, your model, when pressed onto reality, breaks.

01:47:20.062 --> 01:47:22.003
Where are the cracks?

01:47:22.023 --> 01:47:23.924
And those cracks are the paradoxes.

01:47:24.284 --> 01:47:28.027
And the paradoxes are what we, as researchers, always want to look for.

01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:32.270
It's not where our model fits with reality, it's where does our model break.

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:54.712
Where are the singularities that will attract our attention that need a higher hypothesis to be generated as a solution concept, which involves also realizing that that paradox, the break, the crack, is located not in the details of the branches, but it's in the roots of the tree, is in the core axioms.

01:47:55.233 --> 01:48:01.937
So if we want a really solid, better hypothesis, we need to reevaluate our core axioms.

01:48:02.617 --> 01:48:07.321
And then from there, like this is what I pulled out as you were talking from my bookshelf.

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:12.164
One of the there's this book by Johannes Kepler called The Harmony of the Worlds.

01:48:13.325 --> 01:48:20.651
And it's a really, really, really good it was published in 1619 and only translated into English in 1992.

01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:26.015
If you didn't read an old German or Latin, you couldn't read this book for 400 years.

01:48:27.714 --> 01:48:29.097
but it's so important.

01:48:29.117 --> 01:48:31.701
Did Bill Barr's brother translate that by chance?

01:48:31.801 --> 01:48:32.603
Who translated it?

01:48:33.695 --> 01:48:37.679
but this was some guy named Duncan Field in Aiton.

01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:45.126
It was actually, it's a Cambridge translation, which already puts into some question, I don't know.

01:48:45.387 --> 01:48:50.352
I'm thinking that they just presume that people are too dumb to actually want to read source writings of scientists.

01:48:50.712 --> 01:48:54.776
And so they won't, people won't actually read this, but you know, it's a wonderful read.

01:48:54.956 --> 01:48:57.158
It's sometimes challenging, but what's great about Kepler

01:48:57.879 --> 01:49:02.360
is that he's demonstrating how his third law of planetary motion was made.

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:23.166
And at the very end of the book, he tells you, OK, well, by the way, you can use this formula of like, you know, so you discovered three planetary laws, elliptical functions, the equal area, equal time law, the ellipse function, but also the third one, which is the one he was building his entire life towards, was on the harmonic musicality of the solar system.

01:49:23.866 --> 01:49:43.655
And he devoted his life and originally this hypothesis, he picked it up when he was reading Plato's Timaeus, laying out a hypothesis, but without having the data available to prove said hypothesis, that there is a rational yet beautiful musicality organizing the spacings of the planetary orbits around the sun.

01:49:44.981 --> 01:50:04.678
And, and it was only in Kepler's lifetime that enough data was accumulated, and he was able to perfect some of that utilizing the anomaly of the retrograde motion of Mars, right, and and and utilizing enough of just the retrogrades where Mars starts moving back every like 687 days, like Mars goes backwards a little bit, he was able to take enough of these data points and

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.046
discover his first two laws.

01:50:08.107 --> 01:50:13.193
But the third one, he did the same thing for all of the planets, thinking about their fastest and slowest moments.

01:50:13.213 --> 01:50:27.888
So of all the infinite possible choices of speed and distance of each planet around the sun, he picked only the fastest, the furthest, the Apohelion perihelial, the fastest and the slowest motions, and then found through

01:50:28.795 --> 01:50:36.999
Again, this beautiful book, how the question, why are they where they are instead of some other possible arrangement?

01:50:37.039 --> 01:50:37.739
I could imagine.

01:50:37.919 --> 01:50:39.200
Why are they found the way they are?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.902
And he builds up the the the he basically develops

01:50:46.268 --> 01:51:00.211
The best hypothesis, which is utilized by Johann Sebastian Bach a few decades later to build up the well-tempered clavier of the reasons why the hard and soft scales, the major and minor musical scales are where they are and why the divisions are located on a string where they are.

01:51:00.351 --> 01:51:01.031
It's not arbitrary.

01:51:01.051 --> 01:51:10.173
It's not mathematical, but there is a geometrical base to like listening to the sound of a square versus a triangle versus a pentagon or a hexagon.

01:51:10.293 --> 01:51:11.533
And you could get divisions.

01:51:12.453 --> 01:51:22.417
within those relations that then have certain resonance to each other and to the whole that also elevate or de-amplify the music that one is listening to.

01:51:22.657 --> 01:51:27.499
That could be then, you know, that will have an effect on the soul of humans who want to make music.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.782
And so those relationships he finds to be organizing the behavior of the planets

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:40.923
The known planets, he only knew of six planets, but it's still the harmonics work perfectly well to the point that and this is the kicker.

01:51:41.444 --> 01:51:50.208
He was able to foresee a space between Mars and Jupiter where there would be something discovered, as he says, because there should have been a planet there.

01:51:51.061 --> 01:52:04.672
And it took 200 more years for Carl Friedrich Gauss to take Kepler's message and his forecast and discover the orbital belt of Ceres, which wasn't seen by the human eye for another 200 years.

01:52:05.292 --> 01:52:10.096
And Carl Gauss in 1790 or 1799 discovered this orbital belt.

01:52:10.116 --> 01:52:12.618
And this kid was like 21 years old, but he studied Kepler.

01:52:13.979 --> 01:52:16.041
So it proves that Kepler, there's a quality,

01:52:18.094 --> 01:52:33.773
of substance to Kepler's idea set that had a resonance with the entirety of the universe when acted upon voluntarily that gave us greater freedoms when we were obedient to that idea of what gravity was not that not the later perversions of the term gravity that were perverted by a lot of British

01:52:34.914 --> 01:53:00.930
um Royal Society empiricists around the Newtonian cult that came in later around the Bank of England because Newton was that's another whole other can of worms here but but there was a whole other subversion of the the school of of western science that Kepler represented going back from Plato to Kepler Leibniz was a follower of Kepler who discovered his infinite infinitesimal calculus based on a challenge Kepler put out to future mathematicians

01:53:01.570 --> 01:53:10.435
to solve nonlinear equations that one encounters when dealing with physical curvature in the physical universe that's not Euclidean.

01:53:10.895 --> 01:53:16.618
Like the curvature of a hanging chain might look like a parabola, but it's not a parabola.

01:53:16.658 --> 01:53:19.419
Parabolic functions don't work for a hanging chain in the physical universe.

01:53:19.499 --> 01:53:28.784
It requires something more, which that was the inspiration for Leibniz and Jean Bernoulli, who discovered this new language.

01:53:31.289 --> 01:53:37.410
that had similarities to the old language prior to the discovery, but it had totally new axioms.

01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:49.812
The axioms were changed, the language was expanded, enriched, our power, our resonance within the universe was enriched, and our ability to sustain more people at a higher quality of life by overcoming the Malthusian traps was also enriched.

01:53:50.332 --> 01:53:59.194
So we could have more people when we acted according to these discoveries, an obedience, a willful obedience to law, right, that gave us a greater freedom to,

01:54:00.234 --> 01:54:04.977
break through the limitations that were holding us back so we could fly by being obedient to the laws of aerodynamics.

01:54:05.057 --> 01:54:05.578
We were free.

01:54:05.778 --> 01:54:11.402
We were free to fly by being obedient to a law of.

01:54:12.262 --> 01:54:25.131
So I heard I heard I heard a Catholic guy who is the brother of Bill Barr make the argument that actually are all of our technical progress is based on our

01:54:26.013 --> 01:54:32.490
respect of natural law as it pertains to God and nature and what we can ascertain from working with it.

01:54:35.317 --> 01:54:45.485
It's weird because he actually made the argument that Galileo wasn't as bad or treated as badly as this made out to be and that he was excommunicated for something else or something like that.

01:54:46.406 --> 01:54:47.767
It's a really interesting take.

01:54:47.807 --> 01:55:00.457
And I love the fact that you hooked into Kepler because I had a really good university professor teach a very good history of Western science class that I took as an undergraduate.

01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:02.598
And I'm still inspired by that.

01:55:03.579 --> 01:55:12.643
time period in human history when I think, if I can say it so clumsily, they kind of lost control of us for a little while.

01:55:13.823 --> 01:55:16.885
And, and we made a lot of progress, despite them.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.521
And so I'm really excited about this.

01:55:20.601 --> 01:55:36.290
I think there's a contemporary in there by the name of Spinoza in the Netherlands who thought of God as a natural thing, evidence in the things that Kepler and other people were learning was this was evidence of God.

01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:42.313
Would you agree with that, at least in the historical context that most of these people saw this as evidence of God?

01:55:43.894 --> 01:55:46.896
Yeah, I mean, back then it was the split between

01:55:48.629 --> 01:56:01.738
The split between the mind of human subjective beings exploring and the thing explored objectively was not so set into stone as it's become in our more modern age.

01:56:02.158 --> 01:56:06.081
So I think, yeah, you didn't have the word scientist, you had natural philosophers.

01:56:08.102 --> 01:56:15.006
And yeah, I think there was a greater, even though there was disputes around what do they mean, just like we're talking here, like there wasn't an agreement that,

01:56:16.247 --> 01:56:17.567
common words meant the same thing.

01:56:17.947 --> 01:56:22.108
There was a common, a healthier baseline upon which everybody could agree with.

01:56:22.848 --> 01:56:27.229
That there's not an absolute divide between the subjective and the objective, the whole and the part.

01:56:28.329 --> 01:56:30.390
Purposefulness was presumed to have some existence.

01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:34.990
The question of what that purpose might be, that could get pretty heavy as a fight.

01:56:36.411 --> 01:56:37.351
The economy of nature.

01:56:37.511 --> 01:56:42.872
I think there was generally an agreement that everyone agreed that there was a form of economy that God

01:56:43.692 --> 01:56:49.977
was not a bad word that was unscientific, though some people used it overly lazily, obviously.

01:56:50.438 --> 01:57:03.508
But there was an idea that, OK, if there's laws, there must be some form of reason for the laws, meaning some form of lawmaker idea of some sort that we could postulate is embedded, giving purposefulness to the laws being what they are instead of some other laws.

01:57:04.702 --> 01:57:12.664
And that God is probably, that lawmaker couldn't be stupid enough to make too many, make mistakes.

01:57:13.225 --> 01:57:15.025
So, but then why is there evil, right?

01:57:15.225 --> 01:57:17.326
Why is there stupid, stupidity?

01:57:18.586 --> 01:57:20.627
Did God screw up by allowing evil?

01:57:20.667 --> 01:57:21.387
Did he make evil?

01:57:21.407 --> 01:57:27.589
Maybe evil, since the cause must flow into the effect, maybe evil is caused because God is evil.

01:57:28.649 --> 01:57:32.512
Maybe he's just flowing through and exhibiting his own essence in allowing evil.

01:57:32.552 --> 01:57:34.033
Maybe evil is more powerful than God.

01:57:34.694 --> 01:57:37.316
Or maybe evil is the absence of good.

01:57:37.396 --> 01:57:38.777
Maybe evil is tied to ignorance.

01:57:38.817 --> 01:57:42.060
Maybe evil is tied to this thing called free will that was given to us.

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:48.986
So you got these very important debates and discussions, which we're not allowed to have anymore, in a serious way at least.

01:57:50.015 --> 01:58:03.286
Which goes back to this note that I think is one of the best I made, is that you made the point of saying that in order for us to get to my imagined goal, we need high-level citizenship.

01:58:03.446 --> 01:58:14.215
We need people that are educated enough to have these discussions and capable of processing the nuance of them, and at the same time,

01:58:17.141 --> 01:58:32.490
I think the other word you use to describe what cannot be tolerated for too long is mediocrity and I think that's a beautiful way to say how what probably was at one point a really good idea has been distorted and

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:34.741
run into the ground.

01:58:34.861 --> 01:58:44.926
Western civilization has been kind of run into the ground through mediocrity and it's a really awesome, I think, high level way of saying it or a high altitude way of saying it.

01:58:45.567 --> 01:58:52.230
Is there a, and I'm also really curious about this Venetian thing and the Marx Lion because my favorite

01:58:53.351 --> 01:58:56.433
Scooby-Doo character right now is a guy by the name of Robert Malone.

01:58:56.473 --> 01:59:07.879
And he always has what now when you say it, he actually has a lion mask, which is probably Venetian behind him, which now puts it in an extraordinary context.

01:59:08.599 --> 01:59:11.280
With glowing yellow eyes.

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:12.661
Yeah, it's a little bit over the top.

01:59:12.781 --> 01:59:16.403
Anyway, I've put your sub stack up a couple of times.

01:59:16.463 --> 01:59:17.804
Is there anything you want to say?

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:21.566
I know you have visitors coming and I've already taken two full hours of your time.

01:59:23.066 --> 01:59:27.089
If you want to, I don't know, give a wrap-up statement or a find-new-where or whatever.

01:59:27.529 --> 01:59:30.751
This has been way too much information.

01:59:30.791 --> 01:59:33.093
I have four pages of notes.

01:59:33.253 --> 01:59:37.255
I'm gonna have to check some things and maybe I'll have an idea of what I want you to come back to.

01:59:38.643 --> 01:59:40.285
It's really, it was really cool.

01:59:41.246 --> 01:59:46.172
You're obviously more well-read than I am, because even if I read it, I wouldn't remember it like you did.

01:59:47.113 --> 01:59:49.696
So anyway, thanks very much for coming on the show.

01:59:49.836 --> 01:59:55.123
Let people know what you're up to and where you're going and how many volumes of books you have to buy, that kind of thing.

01:59:56.633 --> 02:00:08.000
Well, no, JJ, thank you very much for for having me on and this is soul food for me like I this I it's very edifying and just talking about these kinds of ideas and Plato Plato had once said like any day.

02:00:09.099 --> 02:00:12.461
that passes without talking about the purpose of life is a day wasted.

02:00:13.042 --> 02:00:14.903
So I think that this is not a day wasted.

02:00:15.304 --> 02:00:16.064
Very good at all.

02:00:16.384 --> 02:00:25.391
And yeah, I've been very impressed by your presentations and compositions and ability to just put context into things that we take for granted in the scientific realm is just really wonderful.

02:00:25.431 --> 02:00:25.911
So thank you.

02:00:26.131 --> 02:00:28.293
Thank you very much for doing what you're doing.

02:00:28.533 --> 02:00:30.775
A lot of courage and a lot of sacrifice that you've made.

02:00:31.810 --> 02:00:36.054
And yeah, I guess for my, so yeah, the books, people could buy books.

02:00:36.394 --> 02:00:43.360
I did four volumes going into this of the Untold History of Canada to sort of prep my mind a little bit to go into the bigger thing.

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:46.382
But those books are available on canadianpatriot.org.

02:00:46.402 --> 02:00:55.129
And then my Clash of the Two Americas books, volume one, two, three, and four are available on also canadianpatriot.org.

02:00:55.369 --> 02:00:58.051
And I just put out a new book called Science Unshackled

02:00:58.892 --> 02:01:00.995
uh, restoring causality in a world of chaos.

02:01:01.235 --> 02:01:02.177
Oh, interesting.

02:01:02.197 --> 02:01:03.679
Um, cool.

02:01:03.779 --> 02:01:04.179
Okay.

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.661
Yeah, do it, do it.

02:01:05.902 --> 02:01:07.083
Then we can talk about that one.

02:01:07.103 --> 02:01:07.724
That sounds good.

02:01:08.826 --> 02:01:12.847
Our mutual friend asked me actually to send you a bunch of books, so I'm going to do that.

02:01:13.888 --> 02:01:14.528
But yeah, let's do that.

02:01:14.708 --> 02:01:17.629
And yeah, so that's CanadianPatriot.org.

02:01:17.729 --> 02:01:24.531
And then RisingTideFoundation.net is a nonprofit, more cultural, educational site.

02:01:24.752 --> 02:01:28.153
I created it with my wife, Cynthia Chung, who's another

02:01:29.933 --> 02:01:44.898
She's done some amazing research and has published a couple of a big book and she's about to do number two on the origins, the deep origins of fascism going back into Templar, Templar territory, which is maybe that would be a fun conversation for you guys to have at some point.

02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:48.653
And that's risingtidefoundation.net.

02:01:48.853 --> 02:01:51.214
And the last thing is Substack has been sort of my lifeline.

02:01:51.314 --> 02:01:55.416
So if people wanna subscribe, I do free stuff and paid occasional things too.

02:01:55.956 --> 02:02:00.199
That's matthewarrett.substack.com.

02:02:00.579 --> 02:02:00.699
Yeah.

02:02:00.879 --> 02:02:01.980
I'm going to put that up there.

02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:02.881
There that is.

02:02:03.421 --> 02:02:09.807
And yeah, I don't know what to say other than, again, thank you very much for coming in.

02:02:10.968 --> 02:02:13.370
And I can get that back off again.

02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:16.173
And I'm sorry it took me so long to finally arrange it.

02:02:17.454 --> 02:02:25.561
Things have been busy as I transitioned from being paid to not paid, but I'm starting to get out of the gravel road and onto the pavement, I hope.

02:02:26.761 --> 02:02:29.042
And so hopefully in the future we can connect again.

02:02:29.562 --> 02:02:33.004
Good luck in the coming, the battles to come, I guess is the best thing I can say.

02:02:33.024 --> 02:02:33.464
I don't know.

02:02:34.404 --> 02:02:35.325
Same, likewise, man.

02:02:35.365 --> 02:02:39.867
I mean, it's one of those times in history where it's like, have a great battle ahead.

02:02:39.887 --> 02:02:41.227
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:02:41.307 --> 02:02:42.328
Okay, thank you very much.

02:02:42.468 --> 02:02:43.188
Enjoy your guests.

02:02:43.208 --> 02:02:43.688
Have a good one.

02:02:43.789 --> 02:02:43.969
Bye.

02:02:46.354 --> 02:02:49.758
So that was an interesting conversation, to say the very least.

02:02:50.399 --> 02:02:54.062
Thank you very much for joining and for being here in the chat.

02:02:55.144 --> 02:02:56.025
It was quite a fight.

02:02:56.085 --> 02:02:59.649
He's definitely not in my field, or I'm not in his field, or whatever the heck you call that.

02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:05.175
Ladies and gentlemen, please, please remember the

02:03:06.616 --> 02:03:12.802
The main message of the show is that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:03:13.443 --> 02:03:15.065
Sure, there might be exceptions to it.

02:03:15.105 --> 02:03:27.538
You might be able to, for example, immunize against rabies with an intramuscular injection, and that might actually work because rabies is a systemic infection of some kind of virus or something like that.

02:03:28.058 --> 02:03:41.844
But again, you need to have a lot more evidence and understanding of what's going on if you're going to immunize children against respiratory diseases and give them 12 or 20 shots before six months of age.

02:03:42.565 --> 02:03:45.546
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent in that.

02:03:45.886 --> 02:03:51.191
It remains absolutely and 100% true, even if the top one has some exceptions.

02:03:51.631 --> 02:03:52.652
They are very limited.

02:03:53.112 --> 02:03:54.853
And finally, RNA cannot pandemic.

02:03:54.894 --> 02:04:07.003
And that is, again, one of these things where until somebody comes up with a substantially better explanation for how the hell that can happen, I'm just going to assume that people are ignoring me because they know it can't.

02:04:07.043 --> 02:04:11.267
And instead, these weaponized piles of money are continuing to convince us to argue about

02:04:11.767 --> 02:04:20.412
the origins of the novel virus, and by arguing about it, we're accepting its existence, and we are being governed by this theater, and we have been for much longer than we thought.

02:04:20.432 --> 02:04:25.054
That's why we all got excited about being free on Twitter, because we weren't free.

02:04:25.535 --> 02:04:28.176
We were being manipulated by these people.

02:04:28.216 --> 02:04:40.263
Ladies and gentlemen, if they can, as Matt described, if they can put out a couple books and give a couple Pulitzer Prizes to convince people that certain things in history happened, then I assure you,

02:04:40.863 --> 02:05:02.950
Right now what's happening on the internet with podcasts is nothing short of malevolent Please ladies and gentlemen Stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary We got a lot of stuff to do That interview is something I really needed to get done and I'm very happy that I did that's probably a

02:05:03.610 --> 02:05:04.870
a guy we'll have on again.

02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:11.372
If you like what you saw, please share the stream at stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:05:11.632 --> 02:05:17.094
You can contact me and communicate with us at gigaohm.bio.

02:05:18.074 --> 02:05:22.535
And you can, of course, support the stream at gigaohmbiological.com.

02:05:22.935 --> 02:05:25.676
Thank you very much for all the work you do trying to share my work.

02:05:26.596 --> 02:05:28.016
Thank you very much for being here.

02:05:28.597 --> 02:05:29.697
I really, really appreciate it.

02:06:09.997 --> 02:06:10.417
Haha!

02:06:11.058 --> 02:06:12.839
Three sentences, that's pretty funny.

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:14.640
Hahaha!

02:06:16.261 --> 02:06:16.502
St.

02:06:16.542 --> 02:06:20.725
Mark's Lion is the lion that Robert Malone has on the wall behind him.

02:06:21.265 --> 02:06:21.805
How's that?

02:06:25.448 --> 02:06:27.049
And Johannes Kepler is dope.

02:06:27.569 --> 02:06:28.810
That's another good message.

02:06:30.411 --> 02:06:30.832
See you guys.

02:06:32.386 --> 02:06:33.386
Yeah, Ruby, I see you.

02:06:33.586 --> 02:06:34.427
I see you there, Ruby.

02:06:35.247 --> 02:06:37.348
I see you, Rubus Bon Bubus.

02:06:37.468 --> 02:06:38.228
I see you.

02:06:38.428 --> 02:06:39.268
I see you.

02:06:39.908 --> 02:06:40.949
I see you, big baby.

02:06:40.989 --> 02:06:42.209
We're gonna go outside right now.

02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:43.029
See you later.

02:06:44.070 --> 02:06:44.570
Yes, yes.

02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:45.210
See you.

02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.870
I see you.

02:06:46.150 --> 02:06:46.550
I see you.

02:06:47.211 --> 02:06:48.111
Yes, I'm done.
