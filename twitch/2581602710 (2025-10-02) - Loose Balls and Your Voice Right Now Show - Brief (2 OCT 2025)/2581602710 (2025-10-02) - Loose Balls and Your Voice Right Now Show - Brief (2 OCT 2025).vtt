01:09.728 --> 01:15.710
You're not a true temptation I said my love, yeah, while I'm away

01:30.939 --> 01:35.664
You know you got to be strong, keep all the other guys alone.

01:35.784 --> 01:39.567
One fine sunny day, I'll be here to stay.

01:39.868 --> 01:44.152
You're my true temptation.

01:44.212 --> 01:47.895
So many times, gonna be lonely.

01:47.935 --> 01:50.017
So many times, gonna be blue.

01:55.424 --> 02:12.528
Heal not to temptation Heal not to temptation Heal not to temptation Heal not to temptation Heal not to temptation I said my love

02:23.735 --> 02:53.295
Keep all the other girls alone One fine sunny day I'll be here to stay You're not to temptation So many times You're gonna be lonely So many times You're gonna be blue You're not to temptation You're not to temptation You're not to temptation

You're not a temptation You're not a temptation

04:57.864 --> 05:00.705
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

05:00.725 --> 05:03.146
I think I almost got that transition right.

05:04.286 --> 05:07.147
I'm just going to let you see what's happening behind me over here.

05:08.247 --> 05:13.089
Yo-Yo Ma is looking out the window, checking out the things he wants to do later.

05:13.849 --> 05:15.350
He's still a really tiny dog.

05:15.930 --> 05:23.552
I thought he was going to be bigger, but Ruby's actually the beast of the house and she's still a giant dog compared to Mikey.

05:23.592 --> 05:24.653
Mikey's just a little guy.

05:25.632 --> 05:32.944
I don't know, maybe his mix of Great Pyrenee is just not going to be as giant as Ruby, but he's still growing.

05:32.984 --> 05:36.349
I mean, he's only like a year old, so I'll give him a little bit of a chance.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.615
I don't say it too often around him, but he is a tiny little boy.

05:40.589 --> 05:43.152
Still little Mike, not big Mike yet.

05:44.513 --> 05:45.234
Welcome to the show.

05:45.274 --> 05:46.836
This is Jonathan Cooley.

05:46.896 --> 05:49.779
This is Geek Home Biological coming to you live from my garage.

05:50.459 --> 05:52.001
I got to babysit the dog right now.

05:52.061 --> 05:56.045
And so he might be loud or whine or scream or yell or knock some books over.

05:56.105 --> 05:56.946
Don't eat that one.

05:56.966 --> 05:58.828
This one is a good book.

05:59.348 --> 05:59.809
Doggone it.

06:05.846 --> 06:13.691
In the tradition of the Andromeda strain, the anthrax mutation.

06:14.331 --> 06:16.992
Curious ideas these people have.

06:17.873 --> 06:23.156
Original title was Project Dracula, but they changed it to the anthrax mutation.

06:23.256 --> 06:25.437
That makes total sense, doesn't it?

06:25.997 --> 06:28.359
That the original title...

06:29.520 --> 06:33.902
who was Project Dracula, but they decided to call it the anthrax.

06:33.922 --> 06:36.143
That makes total sense, the anthrax mutation.

06:36.203 --> 06:42.745
It's just a logical adjustment from, don't knock any more books off.

06:42.865 --> 06:46.027
You don't have to pace around, just lay down over here, dude.

06:47.407 --> 06:54.350
Tonight, I am going to allow a little, it's a segment of, it's not the entire thing.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.609
of Coach K's preseason talk at Duke.

07:00.790 --> 07:16.905
I have a lot of respect for this coach from Duke that also played for Bobby Knight, and he's just a great guy, and I don't want to go too much into it, but his

07:18.396 --> 07:21.799
His role in turning around, for example, the U.S.

07:21.839 --> 07:25.362
Olympic team was absolutely essential.

07:26.042 --> 07:28.384
And I think he's just a really all-around great guy.

07:28.825 --> 07:33.769
And he's got a cool thing to say about loose balls and your voice.

07:34.249 --> 07:35.730
That's the title of the show today.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.834
And I want to get this all queued up here.

07:39.854 --> 07:41.575
I think this is ready to go, right?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.497
Oh, I didn't take the sinks off yet.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.343
The shooting today was really remarkable.

07:50.463 --> 07:56.128
I was above 60% until the last 10 shots or something like that.

07:56.148 --> 07:57.089
It really broke my heart.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.731
I think I missed 10 in a row at the end.

07:59.451 --> 08:05.577
And I kept being stubborn and fighting for it, you know, just hoping that I would bring it back, but I didn't bring it back.

08:05.637 --> 08:06.358
It just went worse.

08:06.458 --> 08:10.622
I think I ended up with 57% today, which is one of the best days I've ever had.

08:12.217 --> 08:31.770
And that's 13,000 made shots 26,000 taken since February I Think since February So I've been putting a lot of work in it's taken a lot longer than I thought it was going to and as a result

08:35.051 --> 08:46.574
The whole delay of biology and basketball has definitely occurred, I will admit it, but I didn't want to start that until I was ready, until I had my form back, until I was reasonably sure I wasn't going to get injured.

08:47.575 --> 09:01.919
Hey, and I've been at a couple times, you know, thinking I wasn't going to be able to pull it off, but I've been doing some knees over toes stuff that I wanted to share some people because

09:03.880 --> 09:10.822
I think it's a few viewers, actually, and some people on Soapbox that shared this guy with me named Knees Over Toes Guy.

09:11.182 --> 09:18.224
And ever since I've watched him, I've adopted quite a few of his exercises.

09:18.524 --> 09:29.627
And I can say with reasonable confidence that at least for my knees and in my situation, this has been really spectacular.

09:31.443 --> 09:34.305
My knees are making noise today for the first time in a while.

09:34.805 --> 09:37.968
They, they, they're the last two or three weeks they've been silent.

09:38.108 --> 09:43.571
And, and I've just been doing a bounce at the bottom of these full length.

09:44.492 --> 09:47.914
So those of you out there who sent the, this is really for that person.

09:47.935 --> 09:51.777
I don't, maybe only for like three people who are in that, that thing.

09:54.983 --> 09:58.105
But you need to have, you can build yourself one of these.

09:58.145 --> 10:01.588
You know if Mark's watching he would just cut a little wedge like this.

10:02.208 --> 10:06.971
So that you can have your heels on an angle.

10:07.892 --> 10:08.953
Will you hush your mouth.

10:09.273 --> 10:10.874
You don't need to be growling at anybody.

10:11.334 --> 10:13.836
And then you put your heels on this angle like that.

10:14.676 --> 10:19.680
So that you can very stably come down all the way to the bottom and hold it.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.061
And you don't go all the way until you rest, like you're gonna pick rice.

10:24.661 --> 10:31.423
But you rest about right here, like, I don't know, I don't know what Knees Over Toes guy would call this, but it's like 90% down.

10:31.923 --> 10:37.384
And you can hold it there, or you can bounce there a little bit, and then very slowly come back up.

10:37.424 --> 10:38.265
There you heard it pop.

10:39.005 --> 10:39.705
And I think...

10:40.976 --> 10:50.839
For a lot of people who might have bad knees in my audience, you know, all the cat ladies and stuff like that, that's going to be an impossible amount of dip there.

10:50.899 --> 10:52.819
But you can start with a lot less than that.

10:53.459 --> 11:03.562
The most important thing to understand is that with that wedge, these kinds of squats are a lot more stable and you can focus on what you're doing without worrying about, you know,

11:04.082 --> 11:11.272
wobbling on your ankles or wobbling on your on the balls of your feet, which is what you would otherwise need to do if you were going to do those moves.

11:12.334 --> 11:12.834
So anyway,

11:15.145 --> 11:15.765
What was I gonna say?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.546
Oh yeah, Bobby, Donnie, Albert, Marty.

11:17.586 --> 11:42.474
I wanted to show you the Albert part of that because during the Albert part of that little thing we watched the other day, there's actually this part where you can clearly see that they have misrepresented Bobby's scowling face when Albert Bourla is talking because when he's introduced and when he speaks that we watched yesterday, you can clearly see that Bourla is shaking his hand and they're all saying they're leaders and yada, yada, yada.

11:43.632 --> 11:51.815
When you hear Trump speak, he also says that Albert Bourla is a leader and a shining star in leadership or something like that.

11:52.636 --> 11:56.957
And so it's really remarkable what Albert says and the whole banter there.

11:56.997 --> 11:57.838
So we'll watch that.

11:58.378 --> 12:00.559
And then finally, we'll get back to this frontline thing.

12:00.579 --> 12:05.641
We've only watched about 15 minutes of it, and I at least want to watch enough of it so that you can see

12:07.367 --> 12:20.092
exactly where they were in 2015 on Frontline, on PBS, and see that that whole narrative, that whole argument, that whole discussion has not progressed even one minutia.

12:20.712 --> 12:36.038
And it's so strange, unless you come to see it as a trap, a kind of argument that they have been fomenting and stirring up and rehashing for years, trying to perfect the group of people

12:36.778 --> 12:47.764
that would be their representatives in this stew of social media at the start of the already known to coming anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and pandemic.

12:48.024 --> 12:48.964
Mikey, now come here.

12:50.805 --> 12:51.205
Come here.

12:51.525 --> 12:52.726
Mike, over here.

12:53.086 --> 12:53.366
Come on.

12:55.207 --> 13:01.670
You are not going to be singing while I'm doing this, so get over here and I'll rub your neck or something.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.171
You shut your mouth, you do-ho.

13:05.936 --> 13:07.437
And so I think it's going to be a nice show.

13:07.497 --> 13:09.679
I got a lot, you know, I think it's all set up.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.061
And then we'll do a little rocking as well.

13:13.162 --> 13:15.524
And yeah, we'll see where we get.

13:16.525 --> 13:19.887
Don't forget that this live broadcast is intended for mature audiences.

13:19.987 --> 13:22.449
I may swear, I may use the S word.

13:23.751 --> 13:29.735
And yeah, I don't know where we're going to go from here, but hopefully it's going to be somewhere nice and somewhere fun.

13:32.177 --> 13:33.318
And thanks for joining me.

13:33.418 --> 13:35.140
I will see you again in a second.

13:35.900 --> 13:40.802
Don't forget that in 2013 Brian hooker will not call autism.

13:40.942 --> 13:44.444
I don't like the word autism He was vaccine damaged.

13:44.784 --> 13:49.646
He was neurologically damaged The condition condition that we will not call autism.

13:49.787 --> 14:01.052
I don't like the word autism He was actually damaged so this is really a problem because actually Brian hooker is one of the people that was recruited and in the movie vaxxed along with

14:01.932 --> 14:04.893
Pauly, Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and RFK Jr.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.535
and they all have been standing in front of us ever since.

14:07.575 --> 14:11.876
But in 2013, Brian Hooker didn't use the word autism.

14:11.916 --> 14:16.238
Logically damaged in condition that we will not call autism.

14:16.378 --> 14:17.939
I don't like the word autism.

14:18.819 --> 14:19.860
He was vaccine damaged.

14:22.540 --> 14:27.325
And so really what this all comes down to, this illusion is sticking to a provided script.

14:27.386 --> 14:34.734
And I don't know for sure who provided it, but I'm pretty sure that Kevin McKernan and Robert Malone are pretty close to the script writers for this.

14:35.034 --> 14:36.516
But you can tell if someone's lying.

14:39.619 --> 14:39.860
Oops.

14:40.729 --> 14:41.429
And I have lied.

14:41.449 --> 14:42.489
I'm sure I'll lie again.

14:42.509 --> 14:43.430
I don't want to lie.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.270
I don't think I'm a liar.

14:45.370 --> 14:46.410
I try not to be a liar.

14:46.430 --> 14:47.291
I don't want to be a liar.

14:47.831 --> 14:50.592
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

14:50.832 --> 14:53.252
And all those people are committed to the lie.

14:53.272 --> 14:56.153
They're all committed to the lie.

14:56.233 --> 15:03.575
And so if you want to break any of these people, just force them to have a discussion about autism spectrum disorder actually being a myth.

15:04.295 --> 15:09.257
and then explain to them that it's a myth because it's not a specific thing.

15:10.178 --> 15:22.624
And it's a myth because Brian Hooker of CHD in 2013 didn't use the word autism to describe his neurologically damaged son.

15:23.840 --> 15:36.106
Instead, autism spectrum disorder has become a myth that's used to make sure that intramuscular injections never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

15:36.426 --> 15:37.987
I think truth is good for kids.

15:38.407 --> 15:42.269
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.370
We want everybody to feel good.

15:45.270 --> 15:46.671
That's not the way life is.

16:13.254 --> 16:13.674
Like him.

16:14.694 --> 16:18.735
So as much as you guys can, tap into that as much as possible.

16:19.175 --> 16:20.736
But Coach, thank you.

16:21.016 --> 16:21.496
You're the best.

16:21.516 --> 16:21.856
All right.

16:21.896 --> 16:22.316
Thanks, man.

16:22.336 --> 16:23.536
The floor is yours.

16:23.576 --> 16:27.997
With what Coach Shire's saying, I'm still involved with the game.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.418
I work for the NBA.

16:31.058 --> 16:36.179
I'm an advisor for Adam Silver, and I'm at all their meetings.

16:36.963 --> 16:43.226
So I say real current in this game, but the game that you guys would want to become a part of.

16:44.767 --> 16:48.088
I don't miss coaching.

16:48.288 --> 16:50.069
I miss relationship building.

16:51.289 --> 16:53.050
And that's the main thing.

16:53.170 --> 16:56.592
And just so you know, we're there for you.

16:56.652 --> 16:59.913
My family, we want us.

17:00.133 --> 17:00.874
We're still us.

17:01.654 --> 17:02.354
We're still us.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.455
I wanted to share with you something today.

17:06.445 --> 17:13.570
You know, when you think of moments, you know, when you're dreaming, you know, do you think of a championship moment?

17:14.150 --> 17:19.294
You know, you want to picture yourself in a championship moment or hitting a winning shot, right?

17:20.014 --> 17:21.235
You know, in your imagination.

17:21.295 --> 17:24.317
Or if you don't do that, that's a mistake.

17:24.418 --> 17:30.302
Even with my Olympic teams, we spent time with mindfulness, where you did mental reps.

17:31.152 --> 17:37.537
at night, Kobe Bryant was probably the best in that, where he would imagine himself being in different moments.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.160
But his moments were not only shooting moments.

17:42.001 --> 17:51.168
And as you start practice today, some of the little things that you wouldn't think lead to moments actually do.

17:52.729 --> 18:00.515
And I want to talk to you about two guys, two guys from the Brotherhood, and show you a little bit.

18:01.185 --> 18:02.366
today about moments.

18:03.687 --> 18:10.651
The first one is about an 18-year-old kid in 2015, Grayson Allen.

18:11.812 --> 18:14.694
Grayson was the last guy on our team.

18:16.215 --> 18:19.657
Okay, we only had eight guys who played and he was number eight.

18:20.638 --> 18:24.781
And early in the year he had some DMPs.

18:25.621 --> 18:26.822
He didn't play in games.

18:27.944 --> 18:30.485
But he practiced his ass off every day.

18:31.206 --> 18:34.347
And he developed relationships with the other guys.

18:34.407 --> 18:36.328
He made them better, and they made him better.

18:37.109 --> 18:39.130
And then all of a sudden, he started getting better.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.590
He got some playing time.

18:41.571 --> 18:47.494
And the thing I want to show you, Trev, this is a moment.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.975
This is the national championship game in 2015.

18:52.793 --> 18:59.015
There's 73,000 people in the stands, and it was the most watched game for a long time.

18:59.115 --> 19:02.035
Over 30 million people watched this game.

19:02.695 --> 19:10.357
Grayson Allen did three little things, three moments, that all of you are capable of doing.

19:11.097 --> 19:21.680
And understand, even though some of you may think, am I the eighth man, tenth, seventh starter, or whatever, all of you are important, and all of you have the ability

19:22.438 --> 19:24.159
to make a play in a moment.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.743
The very first thing, don't start it yet, you're going to see him deny.

19:30.844 --> 19:31.985
We're dead in the water.

19:32.005 --> 19:39.030
We're only down six, but the momentum of the game has shifted to Wisconsin.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.211
They're a veteran team.

19:41.171 --> 19:47.616
We started three pretty good freshmen, Tyus Jalil and Justice Winslow.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.905
We're dead in the water right now.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.008
And this, I put Grayson in the game.

19:56.048 --> 19:59.991
He hit a couple buckets before this to put us a little bit closer.

20:00.651 --> 20:10.699
But the play he's going to make, you're going to see the denial, then him getting a damn, god darn, loose ball.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.761
A loose ball.

20:14.882 --> 20:20.186
And then, after he gets the loose ball, a moment where he uses his voice.

20:21.795 --> 20:30.141
A denial moment, loose ball, amazing moment in using his voice.

20:30.221 --> 20:31.202
Let's show it, okay?

20:32.162 --> 20:41.449
The denial, the loose ball, but then his voice afterwards, okay?

20:42.029 --> 20:42.830
And watch him.

20:42.850 --> 20:48.014
I wish you all could feel that, all right?

20:48.734 --> 20:49.695
And what that did,

20:50.563 --> 20:55.486
What that did, it was like a lightning bolt that went through.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.127
I became a better coach.

20:58.348 --> 21:03.631
And it came from an 18-year-old, the eighth guy on our team.

21:04.612 --> 21:09.875
Grayson Allen really was the catalyst of winning the national championship.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.258
And so when you got a loose ball, practice those moments.

21:15.078 --> 21:16.199
Practice your voice.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.041
Don't wait for someone just to talk to you.

21:19.753 --> 21:23.536
And the fact is he had the courage to say what he felt.

21:24.536 --> 21:28.019
Have the courage to say what you feel to one another.

21:28.899 --> 21:31.301
Don't pussyfoot around everything.

21:31.701 --> 21:35.484
If someone's got their head up their butt, don't wait for a coach to do it.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.084
You do it.

21:38.286 --> 21:39.586
You're playing with one another.

21:40.307 --> 21:43.369
Don't accept anything but the best from your teammate.

21:44.110 --> 21:45.030
What time is it?

21:45.090 --> 21:45.831
Game time.

21:53.016 --> 21:56.339
I really liked that starting thing.

21:56.459 --> 22:02.404
I thought that what he had to say really meant something in terms of using your voice.

22:02.764 --> 22:19.317
He's talking about a guy who was playing in front of 70,000 people, being watched by 30 million people, and he still had the wherewithal to stand up and scream and shout, get off social media.

22:19.978 --> 22:22.000
That's the only noncompliance that matters.

22:23.018 --> 22:24.581
Maybe you need to get up and shout that.

22:24.681 --> 22:29.270
Maybe you need to try and get your kids to get up and shout that at school.

22:30.939 --> 22:32.960
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gigoloan Biological.

22:33.000 --> 22:39.324
If I sound a little winded or a little tired, it's because I'm back from the gym and I am a little bit winded and a little bit tired.

22:40.524 --> 22:46.648
This has been the third day in a row of, well, it's the fifth day in a row, but this is a half day.

22:47.268 --> 22:50.330
I didn't do most of my workout today, but I'm still tired.

22:51.150 --> 22:57.914
And so mice don't die in traps unless they don't understand why the cheese is free.

22:57.934 --> 22:59.135
That's their problem, see?

22:59.895 --> 23:02.856
And I'll explain to you why the cheese is free.

23:03.356 --> 23:09.157
It's because we are at a time point when human diversity is at its peak for all time.

23:09.257 --> 23:26.502
There may never be... There may never be another time point on Earth when there is this much human diversity to collect as data.

23:27.568 --> 23:29.310
Do you understand what that means?

23:30.171 --> 23:34.698
There will never be more genetic diversity available again.

23:36.059 --> 23:36.680
What would you do?

23:44.557 --> 23:47.020
That's the spooky question, ladies and gentlemen.

23:47.040 --> 23:53.267
That's the spooky question we're gonna be asking all October, or should I say Rocktober long.

23:53.287 --> 23:55.870
It's one big theater, one big cast.

23:55.950 --> 23:58.413
Everyone trusts the scripts and you can't change it.

23:58.973 --> 24:00.775
Because that's not how theater works.

24:01.596 --> 24:05.582
He can't yell at the stage and have them change the script.

24:05.622 --> 24:07.946
In fact, if you yell at the stage, you'll get thrown out.

24:08.426 --> 24:11.050
Isn't that interesting that that's what's happening right now?

24:12.012 --> 24:13.895
Isn't it interesting that that's what's happening?

24:13.915 --> 24:17.200
It's almost like we're watching a theater, complete.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.633
with ushers and security guards.

24:20.713 --> 24:23.695
Oh my goodness, it's creepy times, ladies and gentlemen.

24:24.356 --> 24:28.399
Creepy times, so you gotta stick to what you can know, and that would be biology.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.542
That would be biology, and I'm very happy to be here.

24:32.562 --> 24:38.586
I'm very happy to be spreading the truth about autism spectrum disorder and the mythology and how it's used.

24:39.207 --> 24:44.371
I'm very happy to be spreading the truth about how pandemics and gain of function are also used in a similar way.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.154
Um, it's an exciting time to be around, uh, these parts.

24:48.234 --> 24:51.997
It's an exciting time to be around these parts.

24:52.897 --> 24:55.199
And, uh... Yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.242
I like to think of us as the magic sunglasses.

24:59.463 --> 25:00.604
Sorry I'm not on screen yet.

25:00.644 --> 25:04.126
I'm juggling a tea over here, and I'm trying not to burn my legs.

25:04.327 --> 25:13.074
I still have my... my basketball shorts on, so the potential for second-degree stream-ending burns is not zero.

25:13.734 --> 25:14.195
Ahem.

25:17.546 --> 25:17.746
here.

25:18.927 --> 25:20.388
Anthrax mutation.

25:20.469 --> 25:28.755
Can you believe it was going to be called Project Dracula and then they, he said, hey, how about we call it, how about we call it anthrax mutation?

25:28.795 --> 25:29.896
It's kind of the same thing.

25:29.956 --> 25:32.138
It's like a lycanthrope in some ways.

25:32.699 --> 25:38.504
Um, and anthrax can also be killed with a stake to the, well, a crucifix.

25:38.564 --> 25:43.428
Well, anthrax is similar because it's, it doesn't like garlic either.

25:45.127 --> 25:45.828
Um, yeah.

25:46.589 --> 25:51.133
So, ladies and gentlemen, please, let's start sharing our children, showing our children the truth.

25:52.389 --> 25:58.873
The truth about why the cheese is free on social media, and that is because it is a military weapon designed to control us.

25:58.893 --> 26:10.501
It fragments us into countless intellectual groups that are related in ways that allow us to be confused, move between groups, and never get anywhere.

26:12.142 --> 26:18.066
While we sit on our couch and stream, we've got to stay focused, ladies and gentlemen.

26:18.106 --> 26:19.907
America is being undermined.

26:20.990 --> 26:27.654
in lots of different ways, but one of the easiest ways to see how we're being undermined is to try and pay attention to biology.

26:27.694 --> 26:35.939
Especially for me, as a lifelong biologist, I feel very comfortable calling these people out as national security actors.

26:37.380 --> 26:40.962
I wasn't comfortable calling them out in 2020, or in 2021, or in 2022, or in 2023.

26:47.119 --> 26:52.567
I was still trying to figure out which one of them could possibly... They can't all be bad, right?

26:53.789 --> 26:55.191
And that was my mistake.

26:57.318 --> 27:01.082
But here we are, and the sun is shining.

27:01.102 --> 27:09.050
It's a ridiculous 75 or 78 degrees here in the evening with a bright sun coming in the back door.

27:09.710 --> 27:14.755
It's a spectacular Indian summer, if Indian summer can be right now.

27:15.496 --> 27:16.437
I don't know about that.

27:16.457 --> 27:17.218
I mean, why not, right?

27:20.570 --> 27:36.499
yeah I don't know if it's my work or if it's just pirated you know the thing is is that that's what substack does and the more that I would have written on substack the more that would have gotten pirated because substack is just the same it's the same kind of show you know they can

27:37.452 --> 27:46.295
They can show up in all kinds of comments and argue with you all day long, and you can argue back, and you don't even know if you're really arguing with the person that says that they're arguing with you.

27:46.835 --> 27:50.376
It's really all just a great big, awful, terrible mess.

27:51.076 --> 28:00.219
Unless you're maintaining the forum or the platform and you know that it's just, you know, just people posting and making threads, you really are not.

28:00.920 --> 28:01.580
You're not free.

28:03.806 --> 28:05.827
And I think we got to work together to seek the truth.

28:05.907 --> 28:07.769
I think I'm just going to pop myself down here.

28:07.789 --> 28:10.711
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

28:10.751 --> 28:11.691
Thanks for being here.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.014
My energy will pick up as I move through this stream.

28:16.534 --> 28:17.675
It is an efficient one.

28:17.695 --> 28:27.081
I really think we're at the stage where all of us can think of ourselves as the seventh player in an eight-player roster.

28:28.742 --> 28:31.124
And we need to train to be ready.

28:32.130 --> 28:34.351
We need to be training to be ready.

28:34.391 --> 28:42.514
We need to be training in a way that we know that whenever we have an open shot, we can take it.

28:43.394 --> 28:52.737
And I think that's what I'm trying to do with these very short and succinct statements like intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

28:54.097 --> 29:01.080
Because if you can succinctly say that to someone on the street or on the bus or at work,

29:02.863 --> 29:30.401
and casually just drop that not in an argumentative way, but you know, it's interesting because intramuscular injection is actually just a dumb idea from the late 1800s back when people didn't understand anything to do with the immune system and in fact thought that medicine could be any combination of substances injected and most of the time it was morphine and the crazy part was is these doctors were using like one needle and

29:31.121 --> 29:39.056
or two needles and one plunger for everything and all combinations of stuff, you know, washing it or something like that.

29:39.517 --> 29:41.380
And so there's even the possibility

29:43.607 --> 29:51.812
that the early use of hypodermic needles, most often for morphine, meant that every time somebody got an injection, there was more or less a little morphine.

29:51.892 --> 30:05.901
And in fact, when we start reading some of these older books that I have on the shelf behind me, what you will find is that they, in fact, always, always combined the same shit.

30:06.521 --> 30:09.243
And it was just a question of where they put it and for what.

30:09.523 --> 30:09.703
So,

30:13.188 --> 30:18.482
Just to give you an example, all of these are anecdotal stories in here.

30:24.668 --> 30:29.792
Miss K is a neuralgia involving all the branches of the fifth pair of nerves on the right side.

30:30.593 --> 30:34.416
Miss K, a maiden lady residing near Cape Cod, consulted me in the spring of 1863.

30:34.456 --> 30:36.618
She's a 49 years old, diseptic,

30:45.485 --> 31:02.970
I don't know what that means, exceedingly nervous, was seized with neuralgia about eleven years ago, and with the cessation of her catamenia about three years ago, its violence increased, so acute is the pain that she dared not leave the house without a veil over her face.

31:03.710 --> 31:10.692
The least breath of air, the faintest sound, a loud word spoken in conversation can conjure up as if by magic a paroxysm.

31:11.778 --> 31:14.360
Then her cry for relief is almost agonizing.

31:14.480 --> 31:19.524
I resorted to hypodermic injection as all remedial agents had proved unsuccessful.

31:20.544 --> 31:29.251
April 9th injected minimums of liquor opium comp near the infraorbital foramen.

31:31.880 --> 31:37.985
Aside from considerable gastric disturbance which followed the operation, relief was complete for four days.

31:38.465 --> 31:42.128
April 14th renewed the injection with benefit continuing for seven days.

31:42.729 --> 31:50.475
For four months, the same treatment was continued whenever the occasion required the paroxysms diminished in intensity and in frequency.

31:51.076 --> 31:59.843
So again, this whole injection thing is always a combination of opium, liquor, he calls liquor, opi, comp,

32:00.635 --> 32:04.919
in and in the book, if we read it page by page, I can't find that page right now.

32:04.939 --> 32:06.080
And I don't want to page through it.

32:06.761 --> 32:11.465
It's just a combination of substances that he considers his standard mix.

32:12.125 --> 32:18.451
And it is derived from two other doctors that he cites in here that he thinks he's just a little bit more advanced than them.

32:18.491 --> 32:25.497
And he can use that combination of substances and just apply it in different places, most often subcutaneously.

32:27.355 --> 32:32.099
And he cures a wide variety of conditions, even a woman that had neuralgia for 16 years.

32:34.321 --> 32:36.483
Now it's hard to tell what he just said there.

32:36.523 --> 32:41.868
What I just read there sounded like he was injecting it somewhere in her head, which is kind of scary, but I don't think that was the case.

32:41.908 --> 32:43.369
I think it was like in her neck or something.

32:44.030 --> 32:52.578
Anyway, the point is, is that they thought and talked about intramuscular injection of opioids

32:55.546 --> 33:01.513
in the same way that people talk in 2025 about the miracle that vaccines are.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.278
That it is absolutely world changing.

33:06.338 --> 33:12.445
Vaccines are world changing, which is actually maybe not totally true.

33:14.888 --> 33:15.269
And so

33:17.932 --> 33:34.501
We find ourselves in a situation where the American government in particular, but it's all governments around the world that are on this global team, have decided that their population pyramids are an opportunity to manage this problem.

33:35.622 --> 33:39.784
You know, this problem that the vaccines are not exactly right.

33:40.004 --> 33:43.226
We know that they do okay, or we know that they don't harm a lot of people.

33:43.686 --> 33:46.728
I don't know what we know, but something isn't right.

33:49.110 --> 33:54.452
And more importantly, they want to change the vaccine schedule to mRNA.

33:54.952 --> 33:55.953
There's no doubt about it.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.133
They want to change it to naked DNA.

33:58.714 --> 34:00.654
They want to change it to electroporation.

34:00.694 --> 34:03.416
There's a lot of different things that they would rather use.

34:04.016 --> 34:12.119
And so slowly but surely, there is going to be a capitulation to the idea that there's something flawed in the vaccine schedule.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.559
It's just not all of them.

34:14.640 --> 34:14.740
And

34:15.959 --> 34:24.144
And that sort of wishy-washy thing that started already seven months ago is gonna continue for a couple more years, I guarantee it.

34:24.825 --> 34:35.751
And in that same continuance, of course, we have Albert Bourla getting $7 billion long-term contract from the US government, I guess to cure cancer or something, but that's of course not true.

34:36.472 --> 34:43.897
It is to develop the future vaccines and the replacement schedule, and probably,

34:44.897 --> 34:49.780
Eventually a transition to personalized medicine in the form of transfection in the same way.

34:49.860 --> 34:55.044
We'll just transfect you and we'll program your immune system based on your genetics.

34:55.104 --> 35:00.907
And I don't know all the details yet because you know, it's impossible to know all the details.

35:00.967 --> 35:03.569
But I know that they lied about the pandemic.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.851
And so, I don't know if I'm in focus there or there.

35:06.891 --> 35:08.492
It's a little bright because the door is open.

35:10.099 --> 35:14.223
And so this time scale of the pandemic is amazingly short.

35:15.023 --> 35:21.809
In fact, it's too short to see that Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:21.930 --> 35:26.894
and Brian Hooker were put in place somewhere circa 2015.

35:27.434 --> 35:34.120
And then in behind the scenes using social media, they were amplified as the leaders of an anti-vax movement.

35:34.881 --> 35:36.602
and not really giving any shit about it.

35:36.622 --> 35:51.806
I just kind of allowed to spin in the background and buy ranches in Austin, Texas and open up therapy places in the UK and have property in both countries and all that stuff.

35:51.886 --> 35:54.446
But it really didn't do anything.

35:54.506 --> 36:00.568
And the reason why was because those people were being put in place specifically for this last six years.

36:02.233 --> 36:08.984
But at the time of these last six years, it just seemed like those were the people who were ahead.

36:10.219 --> 36:13.600
Those were the people who already knew that we should doubt big pharma.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.562
We should doubt the government because they lie about vaccines.

36:17.622 --> 36:24.724
And so then a lot of people just heard about them for the first time during the pandemic, but who would it have been?

36:24.784 --> 36:35.468
Well, of course, by then everyone's acquiescing to the use of social media and everybody that needed to find Brian Hooker needed to find

36:36.796 --> 36:47.579
Andrew Kaufman needed to find Robert Malone, needed to find Brian Hooker, needed to find Brett Weinstein, were funneled there by programming.

36:49.359 --> 36:58.082
Anybody with the right clicks and the right curiosity or the right search terms would have eventually found themselves following Jessica Rose.

36:58.122 --> 36:59.082
It was inevitable.

37:00.206 --> 37:23.246
Anybody that was really curious about what was going on with the mRNA shot in 2021 would have inevitably found themselves following either Peter McCullough, Pierre Corey, Ryan Cole, Steve Kirsch, or Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein.

37:23.386 --> 37:24.407
That's just inevitable.

37:25.322 --> 37:44.115
And that's what you need to see happening in this last six years is a very carefully titrated segregation by curiosity, by question, by knowledge level, whatever, of the entire population using social media.

37:44.275 --> 37:50.339
And then the fractionation of all of those groups into controllable little bits

37:51.377 --> 37:59.883
and they had actors in all of those controllable little bits or who were feeding those people controllable little bits of their actors in other groups.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.085
But it was all a lollapalooza of liars.

38:03.125 --> 38:07.468
And then by the time 2023 was around, it was supposed to be done.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.750
There was supposed to be actors in place.

38:09.810 --> 38:10.730
Everything was good.

38:11.471 --> 38:15.934
Epi girls all over the place, telling everybody that there was injuries from the shots.

38:17.352 --> 38:25.739
And so it's crazy because actually the SPARS pandemic document didn't really get us to where we actually are today.

38:27.981 --> 38:29.943
It was a lie, of course, right?

38:30.063 --> 38:35.327
The brochure version of the actual event was not going to tell us where we were going to go.

38:35.868 --> 38:42.954
But right now a large portion of the American and world population believe that the mRNA shot did something good.

38:45.532 --> 38:46.512
And it didn't.

38:47.052 --> 39:07.256
Like if it transfected people, it transfected people randomly throughout their body and probably provoked any countless probably number of, a countless number of autoimmune and other frailties that will manifest over the next many years.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.657
Maybe the least of which is stillbirths and SIDS.

39:13.197 --> 39:24.214
It is a, it's an ugly state that we are in because again, remember this, this social media weaponized social control suite.

39:25.299 --> 39:37.544
that was foisted upon us has created the illusion to us, or at least it did had me fooled for a long time, that it's roughly 50-50 that the truth is really getting out.

39:37.564 --> 39:45.448
But ladies and gentlemen, I assure you, the only truth that's getting out in America and around the world is that Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

39:45.508 --> 39:50.770
and Marty McCary and J. Bhattacharya are nothing good.

39:52.503 --> 39:56.686
They are just exactly as ridiculous as Donald Trump himself.

39:58.327 --> 40:00.749
And a lot of other people in Europe can see it.

40:00.909 --> 40:03.190
A lot of other people around the world can see it.

40:03.250 --> 40:05.352
And the vast majority of Americans believe it.

40:06.980 --> 40:26.584
And so while other people are chasing around the stories of Charlie Kirk, America has already moved on and is still dealing with the train wreck of Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the colonel from the Turkish military, and the Egyptian UK citizen at the FDA.

40:27.204 --> 40:28.244
This is a disaster.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.365
And so I thought I would check into this.

40:36.658 --> 40:42.844
You know that Mark Kulak has a website called earlycovidsurvivors.com.

40:43.604 --> 40:57.136
And earlycovidsurvivors.com is a nice way of keeping track of all the people who publicly claim, publicly claimed, wrote about, spoke about, were on TV about having COVID in 2019 or 2020.

40:57.216 --> 40:57.857
And the interesting,

41:03.971 --> 41:05.153
cast of characters.

41:06.114 --> 41:13.323
This is from 2021 in May where Charlie Sheen talks life under quarantine.

41:13.403 --> 41:16.467
Plus, would he ever pick baseball over acting?

41:16.507 --> 41:21.453
But if you read down here, actor Charlie Sheen is looking happy.

41:21.473 --> 41:22.414
Oh, I can't see.

41:22.434 --> 41:22.775
There it is.

41:23.214 --> 41:29.862
is looking happy and healthy as he's made his first public appearance since the COVID-19 pandemic.

41:29.882 --> 41:38.552
So they're telling us on May 24th, 2021, that the first time that Charlie Sheen was out in public was May, that's impressive.

41:38.792 --> 41:40.054
That's an impressive statement.

41:41.169 --> 41:45.892
I've transitioned into that coaching role, but that's all right.

41:46.173 --> 41:47.453
That's all right.

41:47.494 --> 41:49.355
The students need educators, you know.

41:49.475 --> 41:50.115
Exactly.

41:50.155 --> 41:50.476
Yeah.

41:50.816 --> 41:51.857
So how have you been?

41:51.877 --> 41:54.779
I mean, this pandemic has been hard for everybody, some more than others.

41:55.259 --> 41:57.420
How has it been for you and the kids?

41:57.681 --> 41:58.621
Yeah, no, we all

42:00.803 --> 42:15.700
You know, for me personally, from its onset, I approached it how I approach every other day, and that's that I just led with common sense and common courtesy.

42:16.281 --> 42:17.903
So when they told me to stay home, I stayed home.

42:18.383 --> 42:20.085
When they told me to wear a mask, I wore a mask.

42:20.646 --> 42:22.087
When they said I could do this, I did that.

42:22.547 --> 42:28.872
So it, it, uh, I, I, I didn't get wrapped up in all the, in all the nonsense that led to so much.

42:29.612 --> 42:32.734
When they said I could do this, I did that.

42:35.837 --> 42:42.181
That is the, that's the clearest statement of, I guess he's, he's, he's, he conformed.

42:42.782 --> 42:43.902
Let's just say it like that.

42:43.942 --> 42:44.663
He conformed.

42:46.056 --> 42:52.860
I'm a fan of science.

42:53.781 --> 42:54.341
And the kids?

42:54.361 --> 42:55.302
How are your kids doing?

42:55.342 --> 42:56.142
They're great.

42:56.182 --> 42:57.143
They're all great.

42:57.163 --> 42:59.925
There's a bunch of them.

43:00.025 --> 43:01.525
No, they're all doing well.

43:01.566 --> 43:05.068
And they followed my lead on those same fronts.

43:06.195 --> 43:06.676
Any hobbies?

43:06.716 --> 43:07.937
Did you take up anything new?

43:07.957 --> 43:12.922
You know, I had a host of stuff I was gonna dive into.

43:12.942 --> 43:16.066
You know, a second language or an instrument.

43:16.126 --> 43:17.007
Nah, none of it happened.

43:17.667 --> 43:20.730
Nah, there was... A second language or an instrument?

43:20.810 --> 43:22.352
Why would that ever occur to you?

43:22.412 --> 43:23.714
Did that ever occur to you?

43:23.834 --> 43:27.638
That you, wow, this lockdown, I might as well get started learning Japanese.

43:29.474 --> 43:36.420
I guess as long as we're gonna be locked down for a frickin' year, I might as well get a guitar, or pick up a keyboard, or I don't know what.

43:36.821 --> 43:38.062
Like, that's such a weird...

43:39.764 --> 43:43.386
It seems like a weird statement to me, but maybe I'm just being goofy.

43:43.466 --> 43:45.206
Good intention.

43:45.327 --> 43:49.869
Yeah, suddenly there was just too much good programming to miss.

43:50.049 --> 43:52.930
Suddenly there was too much good programming.

43:53.010 --> 43:53.930
Nice mask.

43:54.010 --> 43:54.531
Oh, likewise.

43:54.571 --> 43:54.911
Thank you.

43:55.471 --> 43:57.232
You super clown.

43:57.492 --> 43:59.773
Wow, that's spectacular.

43:59.853 --> 44:02.874
So again, it's not a gain-of-function virus.

44:03.034 --> 44:06.316
There aren't elite pedophiles that are running the world.

44:06.396 --> 44:07.636
And if, you know,

44:09.269 --> 44:15.113
It's for the grandchildren of earth, but it's not, you know, Donald Trump is not fighting for the grandchildren of earth.

44:15.914 --> 44:18.936
Trump is, is, is, you know, COVID is real.

44:18.996 --> 44:23.499
And on this side of the narrative, quite frankly, there's, it's still the truth.

44:23.579 --> 44:33.046
Vaccine injury and profound autism like that described by Brian Hooker or by Pauly Tommy is extremely rare.

44:34.688 --> 44:36.529
And it remains extremely rare.

44:38.089 --> 44:51.878
In America right now, I think the odds are pretty good that it's more rare for you to have an autistic child than it would be for you to lose a child to the opioids, opioid pandemic, maybe epidemic.

44:51.918 --> 44:54.780
That's even what Mark just did a short about, I'm pretty sure.

44:56.061 --> 44:58.165
Vaccines can work on this side too.

44:58.225 --> 45:03.733
Donald Trump is very proud of the mRNA and the mRNA just needs to be adjusted, right?

45:03.813 --> 45:06.376
So that's the problem that we have here.

45:06.437 --> 45:10.783
That's the issue and the reason why that is absolutely...

45:11.844 --> 45:26.767
Wrong I didn't get that timing right because my other slider was down here But you know, it's not mother nature either and humans aren't a plague on earth because that plague is already ending It's it's a preponderance of old people that in 20 years aren't gonna be here.

45:26.807 --> 45:31.868
Their houses are gonna be empty And that's happening all around the world.

45:31.968 --> 45:39.170
So if humans are a plague the plague is absolutely positively ending so this can't possibly be

45:41.340 --> 45:42.501
But I think this might be right.

45:42.681 --> 45:50.809
I think it might've been management of a population pyramid problem with a little murder and a little lies, because this is for all the marbles, the grandchildren of earth.

45:51.350 --> 46:01.199
There is never going to be this much diversity in human genomes and in medical data and human data to collect again.

46:02.361 --> 46:04.683
The population pyramids of the world reveal it.

46:06.061 --> 46:08.842
the population of the world is about to collapse.

46:09.062 --> 46:22.124
So the 10 or 11 billion people on Earth right now represent data that will never actually be able to be collected again, unless you allow the population of the Earth to grow in that way again.

46:23.044 --> 46:30.206
With all the resources and systemic support that we've had up until this point through the 20th century, do you see the problem here?

46:30.666 --> 46:32.086
Do you see the opportunity here?

46:34.659 --> 46:55.851
And then that makes it much more sense why there are, instead of lots of people like Kevin McKernan that can tell us all about the human genome and genome sequencing and all the things that are to come, or Ray Kurzweiler, we've got all these clowns in front of us like Elon and Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel and Alex Karp and Mark Zuckerberg.

46:55.971 --> 46:58.032
Come on, come on.

46:58.913 --> 46:59.874
Are you serious?

47:01.254 --> 47:02.235
Bobby and Donnie,

47:07.915 --> 47:08.615
I think we're right.

47:08.795 --> 47:09.976
I think we're right on this.

47:10.276 --> 47:18.620
I think it's just a question of, you know, being able to accept the fact that there's not much more work to be done at this point.

47:18.680 --> 47:24.743
As long as these people keep floundering around and keep reading the script, then it's pretty easy to point it out.

47:29.019 --> 47:41.807
The American public is governed by national security actors, citizens are actively divided on false premises, and the pandemic was a culmination of a long con that's essentially the Human Genome Project militarized.

47:42.888 --> 47:50.032
And the idea is to use as much of the world population as possible as experimental animals.

47:50.732 --> 47:54.415
Collect the data and not share it with everybody.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.174
The Chinese may be collecting genomes from all of us.

47:58.234 --> 47:58.934
It's possible.

48:00.395 --> 48:04.317
Just like they're collecting TikTok pictures of you and TikTok videos of you.

48:04.397 --> 48:18.142
And it's possible that all that data is being collected, but conceived the idea that this data still needs to be stored and it needs to be stored in a common format so that it could be compared across individuals over time.

48:18.582 --> 48:19.723
And so all of these,

48:21.716 --> 48:24.058
Data infrastructures still need to be built.

48:24.218 --> 48:29.923
All of these hypothetical data formats still have to be discovered and fine-tuned.

48:30.363 --> 48:39.591
And so there are a lot of steps that still need to happen before 10 billion genomes can be collected and combined with the medical data that could be derived from their lives.

48:42.113 --> 48:49.339
And so we're developing the technologies that can carry that data around, the technologies that can transmit that data back to a central data hub.

48:50.319 --> 48:59.067
We're building the technologies that can keep track of those individuals over time so that the records never get mixed up and can be tracked.

48:59.748 --> 49:07.736
We're building all of this infrastructure that we can store all that data over time and supply it back to a machine learning algorithm.

49:08.456 --> 49:14.322
We're just using it for other things right now, like PlayStation games and YouTube and Netflix videos.

49:16.937 --> 49:23.400
But we've already got the data infrastructure in Oracle, all kinds of Oracle products, all kinds of Oracle products.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.501
Every single database in the U.S.

49:25.561 --> 49:27.162
government is an Oracle product.

49:27.662 --> 49:28.823
You know Larry Ellison?

49:31.004 --> 49:32.845
You know John Cullen?

49:34.486 --> 49:36.127
It's all one malevolent show.

49:37.748 --> 49:41.549
All the little players, all the big players, it's all one malevolent show.

49:41.610 --> 49:44.471
It's been planned for a very, very, very long time.

49:46.351 --> 49:51.762
Very long time.

49:51.882 --> 49:54.427
I heard somebody, I read somebody in the chat is download the

49:56.047 --> 49:59.589
the YouTube PeerTube thing and it got it to work.

49:59.629 --> 50:00.149
So that's good.

50:00.189 --> 50:05.432
But it is still the chat in Twitch is still, of course, a very nice place to be.

50:05.492 --> 50:08.813
So I can't blame you for wanting to have that window open.

50:08.874 --> 50:09.754
I can't really improve.

50:09.794 --> 50:14.696
I could improve that by doing the Twitch chat, but then you'd still have to come on.

50:14.796 --> 50:17.498
I can also put the PeerTube chat up.

50:19.079 --> 50:23.321
But then again, you know, you have to go over there and put your little name in the PeerTube chat.

50:23.361 --> 50:25.502
But anyway, we can do that, whatever we need to do.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.416
I think we're just going to get on with this little thing.

50:30.436 --> 50:31.957
You know this is the story.

50:34.245 --> 50:36.246
Um, it's fifth generation warfare.

50:36.266 --> 50:38.107
Um, i've met a lot of these people.

50:38.287 --> 50:43.529
I tried to follow them around I tried but you can tell if someone's something and they just didn't listen.

50:43.549 --> 50:49.792
Um, even jay bata charia, uh, it's just really a disaster Um, I don't know how to describe it any other way.

50:49.832 --> 50:59.517
I feel like i'm the only one who's seen the alien I feel really weird because I know all these people are liars, but I can't Convince most people because they're engaged in social media

51:00.257 --> 51:04.640
But I'll go to my grave knowing that all those people on the previous page are liars.

51:04.720 --> 51:16.807
I mean, it's, well, you know, all the people on the previous page except for this guy down here because this guy is my friend Nathan who died in December of 2023 from a shocking aneurysm.

51:17.928 --> 51:20.310
And so, but everybody else is lying on this page.

51:21.270 --> 51:34.955
Nobody on this page, after telling me that I was so great, is supporting me, or supported me, or is saying that my work is good anymore because, again, they were all part of the Kennedy show.

51:35.475 --> 51:38.696
They were all part of the anti-vax movement that was fake.

51:39.116 --> 51:41.377
They were all part of covering up the murder and lies.

51:41.417 --> 51:54.865
They were all part of this network of podcasters and interviews that was going to be set up and used and magnified during the pandemic and serve as a place for people to audition.

51:55.525 --> 52:01.051
for roles in the upper layers of the podcast universe.

52:01.511 --> 52:09.600
And they provide the virtual stage that PBS NewsHour and CBS Sunday Morning used to provide, that 60 Minutes used to provide.

52:09.660 --> 52:18.149
Now, social media and podcasts provide a very specific, you know, if you like, I don't know,

52:21.018 --> 52:24.340
I don't even know any names of people anymore because I don't watch anybody.

52:24.360 --> 52:29.063
But if you like Mark Kulak, for example, and you're one of the

52:30.427 --> 52:51.825
let's say 5,000 people, but I know that's a little exaggerating, 5,000 people that follow Mark Kulak regularly, and you're satisfied with Mark Kulak's take on the world, then you might only watch a couple of Joe Rogan episodes, and some Family Guy, and I don't know what else you might watch, and then the rest of the time listen to Mark.

52:52.285 --> 52:58.551
And so as a cat herder, Mark would be a mid-level cat herder with 5,000 followers, and he might have a sponsor,

52:59.292 --> 53:13.289
And with enough Mark Kulaks with different voices and different hair and some with boobs and some not, you could just imagine a scenario where you just have a bunch of people on the internet and together,

53:14.554 --> 53:33.382
They represent a controlled wall where no one's ever gonna say infectious clones, and no one's ever gonna say that mRNA is just transfection, and no one's ever gonna say that gain-of-function is a myth, and if they say anything about viruses, they'll either say that of course viruses are real, or no, there are no viruses, there's no proof.

53:33.922 --> 53:44.186
And so, with a well-trained, scripted army of people, the internet becomes a playground, because they can program you to find these people.

53:45.666 --> 53:54.353
And depending on whether or not you watch that whole episode of Joe Rogan, or you clicked right past it, then they can feed you something else until they find your little niche.

53:54.873 --> 54:11.427
And before you know it, you've got your favorite podcasts and you've got your favorite, you know, X accounts, and you can waste all of the time that you're curious on those things and those people, and lo and behold, they've got you.

54:12.657 --> 54:15.978
But maybe you like, I don't know, Substack or something like that.

54:16.018 --> 54:17.839
And then the same thing applies.

54:19.439 --> 54:21.160
Because they're promoting each other.

54:21.220 --> 54:25.041
They're not promoting somebody like me or somebody like Mark Kulak.

54:25.101 --> 54:28.322
And so if you found me, you might find Mark.

54:28.422 --> 54:33.343
But if you find Joe Rogan, then you might find the Rubin Report.

54:33.383 --> 54:37.345
And then you might find that the Rubin Report had Viva Frye and

54:39.345 --> 54:49.548
and Dr. Drew and ZDoggMD all on at the same time in 2021.

54:50.208 --> 54:58.430
And then you realize that that is one network of people promoting you all different flavors of scripted bullshitters.

54:59.230 --> 55:20.451
so if if i don't know z dog md is the one out of those four people that makes the most sense to you then you can go follow him and then you might meet vinay prasad and and and marty mccarty carry on the next episode that you watch but if it's one of the other guys that you follow then maybe soon you'll have ryan cole on or something like that and so these

55:21.352 --> 55:38.289
shit sandwiches of of scripted influencers were served to us time and time again and because we were naive and didn't understand what they were doing we chose one of the flavors presented to us and followed that person to another group of idiots and before you know it

55:38.769 --> 56:02.243
You're following Jessica Rose and Nick Hudson and you think Panda's the best group out of all the groups and you also really like Doctors for COVID Ethics but not Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International because Stephen Frost is kind of a dork or something like that and you have a useless opinion about meaningless actors that are all on a coordinated script.

56:03.503 --> 56:07.686
Joe Rogan doesn't have to know because he's getting paid enough money not to give a shit.

56:11.021 --> 56:31.578
And so here we are, still focused on too short of a timescale to understand that right down to Joe Rogan, Mary Holland, Meryl Ness, Brian Hooker, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., all of them were put in place, getting ready to go so that when this shit took place, the only thing they needed to do was kill Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker.

56:32.599 --> 56:34.741
The absolute playing field was clear.

56:35.561 --> 56:37.143
Everybody else was bewildered.

56:39.147 --> 56:40.710
Everybody else was on the same team.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.975
So it was them against us.

56:43.696 --> 56:46.883
And we didn't even know there was a Globetrotters that we were playing.

56:46.923 --> 56:49.849
You see, we didn't know they were on the same team.

56:51.118 --> 56:54.100
But the same team that knew that this was coming, I assure you.

56:54.760 --> 56:56.442
That's why they existed.

56:56.942 --> 57:01.965
That's why they were put in place, because this signal has been coming for decades.

57:02.446 --> 57:07.049
The plan to declare a pandemic has been coming for decades.

57:07.569 --> 57:15.194
And that's why ICANN and VAX and Polytomy and Andrew Wakefield and Children's Health Defense all came into existence.

57:15.294 --> 57:20.598
How they came into existence in the chronology that they came into existence with the people

57:21.398 --> 57:27.321
that they came into existence with versus the people that they didn't come into existence with.

57:27.861 --> 57:32.563
Again, including the dead and murdered Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

57:34.884 --> 57:37.005
And so I'm trying to seek the truth about this.

57:37.205 --> 57:41.287
I'm trying very hard, but it's difficult because this is goofy shit.

57:46.289 --> 57:49.711
It is my absolute pleasure to introduce Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer.

57:56.072 --> 57:56.952
What do you think he did?

57:57.032 --> 57:58.853
Whispered, you're a murderer in his ear?

57:59.833 --> 58:00.713
You think that's what he did?

58:00.733 --> 58:14.737
I don't, I don't, I don't think that's what he whispered.

58:16.561 --> 58:23.903
Mr. President, what an honor to be here today in this office to announce a landmark agreement.

58:24.423 --> 58:26.084
I think it's a historic day.

58:26.944 --> 58:28.585
Is this the Corliss office?

58:29.185 --> 58:30.345
He has a beautiful office.

58:32.746 --> 58:36.187
It is my absolute pleasure to introduce Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer.

58:43.049 --> 58:45.050
It's my absolute honor.

58:46.584 --> 58:55.512
What I'm trying to point out to you, ladies and gentlemen, is that although it's not perfect, they have scored the main touchdown here.

58:56.813 --> 58:59.555
They have normalized mRNA.

58:59.675 --> 59:04.279
The vast majority of Americans believe that mRNA worked just fine.

59:05.180 --> 59:14.048
And that is most likely, most likely because most or a lot of the RNA shots were actually placebo.

59:14.994 --> 59:21.740
I'm not saying nobody got hot shots because my friend certainly died from it, but, or likely died from it, I guess.

59:21.760 --> 59:22.921
I don't know if he did or not.

59:24.042 --> 59:25.363
But I have more than one friend.

59:25.383 --> 59:28.526
I have also a sister-in-law and I have also a father-in-law.

59:28.546 --> 59:31.289
And so it's all murder and lies.

59:33.070 --> 59:38.195
And these people don't seem to be too concerned about the murder and the lies at all.

59:39.127 --> 59:47.531
the murder of more than a million Americans over, say, five years, and the misconstruing of that as a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.

59:48.511 --> 59:50.192
And these guys don't seem to care at all.

59:50.672 --> 59:53.374
And the reason why is because they are on a script.

59:54.194 --> 01:00:04.639
I will suggest to you right now that they never thought that the lab leak and the natural virus and the gain-of-function thing would need to go that far.

01:00:05.765 --> 01:00:17.923
That may have even been some kind of improv thing that they did, again, hoping that the last remaining people would get sucked up into it because it didn't work out in their favor.

01:00:19.437 --> 01:00:28.801
The book, Wuhan Cover-Up, is a disaster because the listed expert in the book is disavowing the book.

01:00:29.002 --> 01:00:33.964
Jonathan J. Cooey, that's me, first listed expert in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:00:33.944 --> 01:00:38.106
's book, wants any newspaper in the United States or the world to print

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:40.828
My statement, he is a fraud.

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:51.077
He defrauded me and my family by putting me in that book and not fixing it like I told him he should, not printing it in the right way because all of the real data is in there.

01:00:51.137 --> 01:00:54.119
All the real things that needed to be said are in there.

01:00:54.159 --> 01:01:04.188
It's just that the way that the book was arranged at the final arrangement makes it seem like I kind of think that there's gain of function viruses too, but I don't.

01:01:05.848 --> 01:01:10.830
And so in a way you could say that he took my words and kind of put them in where he needed to.

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:24.016
And he used the parts of my statements that he needed to, to say the things that he wanted to, without actually saying what I said to him, which is gain of function is a mythology.

01:01:24.076 --> 01:01:27.577
All they need to do is make a bunch of DNA and then they could find it wherever they wanted to.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:33.600
They could put it wherever they wanted to, and maybe even, maybe even transfect people with it and make some protein.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.080
Who knows?

01:01:35.851 --> 01:01:51.040
He is a fraud, ladies and gentlemen, but the reason why this is happening in the way that it's happening is because this is exactly where we are supposed to be, minus some of the smoke and some of the broken glass and some of the mess.

01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:53.962
It was supposed to be a lot neater.

01:01:56.084 --> 01:01:59.786
He was supposed to clean up the anti-vax movement a lot better than he did.

01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:04.462
But he did a pretty damn good job because there's a lot of them that still believe.

01:02:04.902 --> 01:02:09.023
At least there seem to be if you use social media as a way of assessing that.

01:02:09.743 --> 01:02:10.524
I'm not so sure.

01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:20.926
And so I think this is a big, big moment because they may be lying through their teeth, even about the support that Donald Trump actually has.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:27.868
It may be important to consider the fact that Donald Trump doesn't have the support that they've told us he does.

01:02:30.305 --> 01:02:35.626
that Trump supporters are a smaller fraction of America than they are told and led to believe.

01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:39.727
Specifically because there is a plan to flip this.

01:02:41.927 --> 01:02:51.949
And the hardcores, the ones that go bananas, the ones that stick to it, they may be somehow misconstrued as a Christian nationalist terrorist, something like that.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.569
And these people would certainly be all about it.

01:02:54.609 --> 01:02:55.449
He'd be all about it.

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:56.190
They're all in.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.230
Bourla.

01:02:59.205 --> 01:03:06.350
Mr. President, what an honor to be here today in this office to announce a landmark agreement.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.531
I think it's an historic day.

01:03:09.392 --> 01:03:11.053
Is this the coolest office?

01:03:11.634 --> 01:03:15.436
He has a beautiful office, but the Oval is the coolest, right?

01:03:15.456 --> 01:03:15.937
What do you think?

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:17.097
I think by far.

01:03:17.998 --> 01:03:20.940
And I have seen other presidents' offices.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.700
There's nothing like that.

01:03:22.161 --> 01:03:23.141
It's a good office.

01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:23.602
Yeah.

01:03:24.912 --> 01:03:31.956
So it's an historic day because I think today we are turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:39.000
For years, other rich nations refused to pay the fair share for the medical innovation.

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:46.044
And as a result, Americans had to assume this proportional cost on their shoulders.

01:03:47.384 --> 01:03:49.986
This situation, we all knew, is not sustainable.

01:03:50.146 --> 01:03:53.548
It really does feel like a stupid-ass script.

01:03:54.568 --> 01:04:01.549
that America has been paying the research and development costs for the rest of the world because I guess we're dumb or something.

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:02.049
I don't know.

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:03.650
And it's unacceptable.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.390
And Donald Trump's the only one who could figure out how to fix it.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:10.451
And Albert Bourla, he will admit that Donald Trump is a genius too.

01:04:10.531 --> 01:04:12.351
It's like, gosh, this is so dumb.

01:04:12.771 --> 01:04:21.953
Don't forget yesterday, I showed you that at the beginning, Bobby Kennedy went on for hours about these people and how great they were, which is just, it's so absurd.

01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:28.629
The situation is a situation that many wanted to change, but no one could.

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:31.192
This is changing today with this agreement.

01:04:32.614 --> 01:04:37.780
In July, the president sent to me and other heads of pharmaceutical companies a letter.

01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:42.647
And over there, he articulated four specific requests.

01:04:44.434 --> 01:05:01.326
These requests, it was obvious to us, were designed to lower drug costs in the America in different ways, each one of them, and all together, holistically, to have synergistic effect in the impact that that will have in the U.S.

01:05:01.366 --> 01:05:02.867
healthcare costs and patients.

01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:11.674
With this deal that we signed today, we satisfied all four of President's requests, all four.

01:05:14.679 --> 01:05:18.582
The big winner of this deal clearly will be the American patient.

01:05:19.043 --> 01:05:20.504
There is no doubt about it.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:26.970
They are the ones that will see significant impact in their ability to buy medicines.

01:05:28.111 --> 01:05:30.933
But I would argue that it is not the only winner.

01:05:31.273 --> 01:05:33.395
I think who else is a winner here.

01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:42.323
It is American innovation and American economy in our industry.

01:05:43.024 --> 01:05:52.549
We had two major overhangs that have substantially reduced our valuations and create concerns for us in our ability to invest.

01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:56.772
We are addressing both of them right now, and I will speak about them.

01:05:57.532 --> 01:06:02.255
The first one was the uncertainty of tariffs, because the president is absolutely right.

01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:08.198
Tariffs is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President, and clearly motivated ours.

01:06:09.409 --> 01:06:09.590
Right.

01:06:12.175 --> 01:06:12.416
So.

01:06:15.689 --> 01:06:25.431
By this agreement that we did, we commit to onshore the production of our medicines that are consumed in the US and are made outside the US.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:30.872
And for that, we are ready to unleash our investment portfolio in this country.

01:06:31.692 --> 01:06:41.394
And the president graciously gave us a three years grace period that we will not be subject to the 232 tariffs as long as, of course, we move the products here.

01:06:42.358 --> 01:06:42.798
That's one.

01:06:43.579 --> 01:06:57.045
The second overhand in our industry was this uncertainty, what will happen with the framework of pricing in the country, best in the pharmaceutical industry, which resulted in significant reduction of our multiples.

01:06:57.105 --> 01:06:58.906
Actually, our multiples are at historical low.

01:06:59.727 --> 01:07:04.789
Well, now we have clarity about what is the framework for the U.S.

01:07:04.869 --> 01:07:05.309
pricing.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:09.932
Read the letter of President Trump, read the four points, and this is the framework.

01:07:10.822 --> 01:07:12.143
And we will abide to that.

01:07:12.563 --> 01:07:16.186
And going forward, this is how things will be priced in the U.S.

01:07:16.226 --> 01:07:16.606
and abroad.

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:28.835
We are ready to invest, as the President also mentioned, $70 billion in the next few years from Pfizer in manufacturing and research in America alone.

01:07:31.022 --> 01:07:47.007
I really think this is an historical moment, because also I can put that behind us and focus on the things that I want to spend my time, cancer treatments, to bring better obesity medicines, to bring better vaccines, to bring things that people value.

01:07:47.408 --> 01:07:48.968
And thank you for allowing us to do that.

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:52.069
I want to thank Secretary Kennedy.

01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:54.250
I want to thank Secretary Lattner.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:57.411
Your leadership helped us to pull that together.

01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:00.819
You are the mastermind of everything.

01:08:01.239 --> 01:08:07.304
And without the brilliant way that you designed the whole thing, we wouldn't be able to make it happen.

01:08:07.464 --> 01:08:09.165
What the hell was that?

01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:12.928
Did he say bless your what?

01:08:17.652 --> 01:08:18.533
Holy crap.

01:08:19.253 --> 01:08:19.574
Wow.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:20.935
I mean, that's just crazy.

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:29.072
Even more brilliant because you had someone in your team that he was the driving force behind everything.

01:08:29.112 --> 01:08:31.974
And I don't have words to thank you for your integrity.

01:08:32.395 --> 01:08:33.696
And it is what you have said.

01:08:34.116 --> 01:08:36.398
We created trust from day one.

01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:42.824
And that was the most important thing that allowed us to be able to pull very difficult negotiations.

01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:48.192
Of course, also, I want to thank the U.S.

01:08:48.272 --> 01:08:51.334
Trade Representative, who is also heavily engaged.

01:08:51.634 --> 01:09:01.801
And he's probably the first trade representative that I have seen that cares about our industry and cares to do something about unfair situations out there, but more than anyone else.

01:09:02.142 --> 01:09:07.625
Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership and, frankly, for your friendship.

01:09:07.686 --> 01:09:07.966
Thank you.

01:09:14.909 --> 01:09:15.809
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:28.974
The growth of drug spending, that is the increase in drug pricing, is the fastest and biggest increasing area of health care spending.

01:09:29.014 --> 01:09:32.695
So today's announcement has incredible implications.

01:09:32.915 --> 01:09:40.478
Remember that this guy basically rose to prominence on the podcast of ZDoggMD and Vinay Prasad.

01:09:41.238 --> 01:09:43.741
Vinay Prasad being his second in charge.

01:09:44.282 --> 01:09:50.950
He basically started the pandemic with a book to sell and did lots and lots of podcasts with those two other dipshits.

01:09:52.091 --> 01:09:56.977
I mean, it's that simple and it's all one malevolent team.

01:10:00.256 --> 01:10:06.042
And I don't know who and what, but it's ugly because it's all the same show.

01:10:06.122 --> 01:10:09.946
From Donald Trump 2016 all the way to Donald Trump 2025, it's always been the same show.

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:33.204
with a very convenient robot Biden administration for four years in between, which means really a total of really 12 years of unbridled control over the American government with no effective oversight by its citizens because there were actors in place for that long, at least.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:40.253
See how bad it is in America, ladies and gentlemen, in other countries?

01:10:40.273 --> 01:10:49.520
Do you see how bad it is if Donald Trump is just a fraudulent pawn of the weaponized piles of money that control America?

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:59.888
Even if they're predominantly Democratic and they use the Democratic Party or the Democratic Party is where most of them are, who cares?

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:05.232
There are no patriots left in our government that I can tell.

01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:07.597
And that is by design.

01:11:08.157 --> 01:11:10.899
Because it is a theater, there are only thespians there.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.081
Look at this fool.

01:11:14.002 --> 01:11:16.403
What do you think he's gonna be saying when I lift up the mic?

01:11:16.483 --> 01:11:17.344
Just try to guess.

01:11:17.844 --> 01:11:29.833
If you're gonna equalize your price to that of other wealthy countries, we're not talking about Zimbabwe, we're talking about Germany, France, UK, Japan, other wealthy countries, the OECD countries.

01:11:30.434 --> 01:11:31.915
If you equalize your price,

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:36.940
then we're going to put your future applications at the front of the line.

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:44.602
A voucher to get a review in weeks has a market street value of about $500 million.

01:11:45.363 --> 01:11:48.584
I mean, we are on another planet right now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:48.644 --> 01:11:49.664
I don't know what to tell you.

01:11:49.724 --> 01:11:53.606
So I got to play some music that feels like it's from another planet sometimes.

01:11:54.326 --> 01:11:56.267
It might not be the taste of everybody.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.388
I got to tell you, it might not be the taste of everyone.

01:11:59.408 --> 01:12:00.368
So I'm just warning you.

01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:03.470
is that this RNA exists.

01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:04.451
You can capture it.

01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:08.214
But I am going to play it because it is it is Rocktober.

01:12:08.334 --> 01:12:10.316
But one thing I am confident of.

01:12:10.396 --> 01:12:11.557
And so enjoy it.

01:12:11.677 --> 01:12:15.761
It starts with a it's actually in the album Passion and Warfare.

01:12:16.121 --> 01:12:23.047
And the song or the track answers actually starts with a Dutch person saying this sentence above me.

01:12:23.067 --> 01:12:26.890
De Antwoorden zijn altijd al aanwezig.

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:31.704
The answers are always already available.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:35.685
I think it's a very, very pertinent way to think about where we are.

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.766
You just have to see it differently.

01:12:39.866 --> 01:12:44.188
Everything else will make much more sense if you just see it differently.

01:12:44.748 --> 01:12:46.429
So I hope this doesn't blow your ears out.

01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:50.010
I don't have a way of testing this ahead of time.

01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:51.890
The answers are always available.

01:12:55.819 --> 01:12:57.761
Oops, sorry.

01:12:58.021 --> 01:12:58.842
That's the wrong one.

01:12:59.122 --> 01:13:00.363
The answers are always present.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:53.924
Now, I won't go so hardcore on you too often.

01:15:53.964 --> 01:15:56.725
I'm not going to pull Steve Vai out every week or something like that.

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:59.647
I understand that he's a lot to take in sometimes.

01:16:00.908 --> 01:16:03.249
But I love the way that song starts.

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.450
I love the singing in his guitar.

01:16:06.831 --> 01:16:09.613
If you're not a guitar player, you probably can't hear what he's doing there.

01:16:09.653 --> 01:16:16.257
But man, oh man, if anybody can sing through their guitar, that guy can talk through his guitar, which is...

01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:35.947
which is uh yeah he's he's you know his story is actually very very interesting because um it's my understanding that at age 17 he transcribed a whole album of Frank Zappa you know hand wrote it and then gave it to him at a concert or something like that

01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:47.744
And so Frank Zappa, for a while, actually gave up the guitar and started writing music that he himself couldn't play and let Steve Vai play it for him on stage.

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.867
I mean, that could be kind of a...

01:16:50.868 --> 01:16:59.712
I don't know, a poor telling if you're a better Frank Zappa fan or more archivist than I am, but that's my rough understanding of it.

01:16:59.952 --> 01:17:03.893
That's how Frank Zappa met Steve Vai at age 17.

01:17:03.934 --> 01:17:09.696
The kid just transcribed one of his, or maybe a whole album, something like that, or a guitar solo that he heard.

01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:10.316
I don't know.

01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:16.559
It was enough to shock Frank Zappa into inviting the kid to the studio to see if he could really

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:41.327
play and he could play and then he just gave up the guitar for a while anyway we belong at um number 15 minute 15 here they showing you a c-section baby um getting the hepatitis b shot and all these other things and they talk about how you know should we really do it etc so then this is a case of pertussis also known as whooping cough

01:17:42.447 --> 01:17:43.987
The audience is made up of paramedics.

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:44.987
This is from February 2015.

01:17:45.648 --> 01:17:50.889
And that's horrifying for any patient of any age to discover that your airway has closed and you can't inhale.

01:17:50.909 --> 01:17:57.270
The teacher, Dr. Cynthia Christophany, is a pediatric intensivist who treats children in need of critical care.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:05.351
She decided several years ago to document the rare cases of vaccine-preventable illness that turned up in her Portland, Oregon, ICU.

01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:10.192
She uses the footage to teach other medics how to recognize these diseases.

01:18:12.492 --> 01:18:24.544
So the story is, is that these diseases aren't found in a lot of other parts of the country because only in Portland, Oregon are there enough retards that aren't vaccinating so that there are babies born with these diseases.

01:18:24.604 --> 01:18:28.608
And I find that questionable.

01:18:29.491 --> 01:18:47.681
But according to Frontline, that's what they're showing you here, that this lady teaches a special course showing videos that only she has because in her hospitals, there are regularly people who are unvaccinated and therefore babies having problems that aren't found in other hospitals.

01:18:47.741 --> 01:18:51.123
And I'm curious as to what extent that's true.

01:18:52.304 --> 01:19:01.648
I'm old enough to have seen most of the serious life-threatening illnesses that are largely suppressed and some almost eradicated by the modern vaccines.

01:19:02.548 --> 01:19:04.149
This baby was a victim of rotavirus.

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:08.971
There's major fluid deficiency in this child's tissues.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.752
Actually kills over half a million humans annually.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:13.993
Most of them elsewhere on the planet.

01:19:14.634 --> 01:19:17.535
The community recollection for these diseases

01:19:17.967 --> 01:19:19.028
has largely disappeared.

01:19:19.328 --> 01:19:24.890
And so the parents of younger kids who are of vaccine age are unlikely to have had any personal experience.

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:35.335
And unless the grandparents or others can tell them what it was like and happen to have had knowledge of somebody who had a severe complication, it's easier to imagine that these diseases are eradicated.

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:59.907
And so, of course, the implication is that these diseases were eradicated because of the vaccines, not because of nutrition or sanitation or chlorination of water or any of the things that are definitely also responsible for the massive reduction in communicable diseases in our societies since, let's say, 1920 on through 1970.

01:20:04.889 --> 01:20:07.390
Those pox are actually something probably none of you have ever seen.

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:08.251
They're chicken pox.

01:20:08.511 --> 01:20:12.172
This patient had one of the common or potentially lethal complications of chicken pox.

01:20:12.212 --> 01:20:14.133
He got strep sepsis from an infected lesion.

01:20:14.673 --> 01:20:18.255
This child came as close to dying of chicken pox as you can come without doing it.

01:20:18.695 --> 01:20:28.279
And so I encourage you to remember that chicken pox... So he got strep sepsis from a lesion, which in theory could have happened from any lesion in the skin.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.601
It's just that he had chicken pox.

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:36.476
You're not supposed to pick your scabs.

01:20:36.496 --> 01:20:38.078
You're not supposed to pick the pox.

01:20:38.758 --> 01:20:42.502
And you're certainly not supposed to do it with dirty fingernails, but maybe that kid did.

01:20:42.562 --> 01:20:48.207
And so he almost died of picking a scab, if you want the honest truth about it.

01:20:49.108 --> 01:20:59.477
That's the remarkable thing we have here, is that in the end, if chicken pox kills you, it kills you because it breaches your immune barrier and bacteria get in.

01:20:59.857 --> 01:21:00.718
Think about that.

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:08.697
also can cause fatalities, even though most people used to think of it as a rite of passage in childhood, and we all got it.

01:21:10.938 --> 01:21:11.878
You can do better than that.

01:21:11.998 --> 01:21:12.879
There is a vaccine.

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:15.440
This one's a scary one.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.921
This is Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis.

01:21:19.581 --> 01:21:22.942
And he was actually the last patient I ever saw with this disease.

01:21:23.082 --> 01:21:26.944
I can tell you, it was the scourge of pediatrics when I was in training, because there was no vaccine.

01:21:27.524 --> 01:21:29.925
But beware, it could come back if people stop vaccinating.

01:21:31.218 --> 01:21:33.480
I just, I'm not sure that I believe that.

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.942
If people stopped vaccinating, it could come back.

01:21:36.022 --> 01:21:38.024
So that means it's always there, right?

01:21:38.104 --> 01:21:38.945
It's always there.

01:21:38.985 --> 01:21:41.447
And only the kids that get vaccinated don't have it.

01:21:42.548 --> 01:21:47.633
And the Hib vaccine, the Hib-Titer vaccine was one of the worst vaccines ever created.

01:21:47.673 --> 01:21:55.120
It was a small epitope of the Haemophilus influenzae B virus.

01:21:56.971 --> 01:22:05.459
uh influenzae b uh bacteria conjugated to a diphtheria toxin like it was ridiculous

01:22:07.932 --> 01:22:10.633
Why are we giving children so many vaccines?

01:22:10.994 --> 01:22:23.440
There's no more polio in the United States, and there's no more diphtheria in the United States, and no one, no child has contracted wild polio since 1979 in the United States.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:26.662
So when do we take polio off the vaccine schedule?

01:22:26.962 --> 01:22:35.007
When do we say, fantastic, the vaccine worked, we figured it out, we don't have a polio epidemic anymore, let's stop vaccinating against polio?

01:22:35.774 --> 01:22:45.617
As vaccine-preventable diseases have become less visible, some Americans have become more concerned about the risks posed by vaccines than by the diseases they prevent.

01:22:46.497 --> 01:23:00.721
Public health officials like NIH's Anthony Fauci have struggled with how to communicate the risks of vaccines without causing undue fear of common side effects such as mild fevers and serious adverse events that are extremely rare.

01:23:01.087 --> 01:23:05.509
To say that there is no risk in any vaccine would not be truthful.

01:23:06.109 --> 01:23:09.151
What is the risk of injecting something into someone's arm?

01:23:09.991 --> 01:23:19.815
The risk is that a certain proportion of people will get swelling and a little bit of pain lasting from an hour to a day.

01:23:20.136 --> 01:23:22.497
That is a very acceptable risk.

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:30.014
A very, very, very small percentage of people will get an allergic reaction.

01:23:30.175 --> 01:23:35.263
Namely, there's a component of the vaccine that they didn't realize that they were allergic to.

01:23:36.434 --> 01:23:44.597
And then there's a subset of a very, very, very, very small percentage of those who actually can get a serious reaction.

01:23:44.757 --> 01:23:53.080
But if you look at that, the risk of that is so minusculely small as to be completely outweighed by the benefit.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:24:01.363
The CDC's website tries to convey all these risks accurately, even when scientists are not sure the vaccines are in fact responsible.

01:24:02.123 --> 01:24:04.024
Here's what it says about the measles vaccine.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:05.960
Severe problems?

01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:06.841
Very rare.

01:24:07.281 --> 01:24:11.544
Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child gets MMR vaccine.

01:24:11.824 --> 01:24:16.886
But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not.

01:24:17.287 --> 01:24:21.629
These include deafness, long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness.

01:24:22.289 --> 01:24:23.290
Permanent brain damage.

01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:27.782
When the CDC communicates risks, they fall into two groups.

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:31.383
One is, are those risks that are very rare, but in fact are real.

01:24:31.563 --> 01:24:35.744
Sometimes very rarely can cause a rash later on.

01:24:36.024 --> 01:24:43.586
And the other are those risks that have been reported following a vaccine, but for which we have no evidence that the vaccine actually caused the problem.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:45.546
Those, I would argue, are at best theoretical.

01:24:45.806 --> 01:24:51.208
My son was a bright, precocious, healthy two-and-a-half-year-old child in 1980.

01:24:52.261 --> 01:24:54.562
when I took him in for his fourth DPT shot.

01:24:55.602 --> 01:25:03.064
Barbara Lowe Fisher runs an independent watchdog organization dedicated to vaccine safety issues.

01:25:03.484 --> 01:25:09.406
It's an organization she helped found in 1982 after her son suffered a serious vaccine side effect.

01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:11.006
To make a long story short,

01:25:11.996 --> 01:25:17.498
After that, he regressed physically, mentally, and emotionally and became a totally different child.

01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:28.162
He was eventually diagnosed with multiple learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder and had to remain in a classroom for the learning disabled throughout his public school.

01:25:28.936 --> 01:25:33.297
Fisher's organization lobbied successfully for laws that promote vaccine safety.

01:25:33.877 --> 01:25:36.938
Today, a much safer vaccine has replaced DPT.

01:25:37.578 --> 01:25:44.200
The laws also created a special vaccine court to evaluate and compensate victims of adverse vaccine side effects.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.541
Vaccines are pharmaceutical products that inherently carry a risk of injury or death.

01:25:50.361 --> 01:25:52.922
And that risk can be greater for some than others.

01:25:53.939 --> 01:26:02.725
particularly for genetic or biological high-risk reasons that have, some of which haven't been identified, and some of which have not been identified.

01:26:02.745 --> 01:26:03.886
Shame on you!

01:26:03.906 --> 01:26:05.968
Shame on you!

01:26:06.248 --> 01:26:11.532
Surveys show about one-third of Americans worry about rare but serious vaccine side effects.

01:26:12.472 --> 01:26:22.960
But one fear has come to dominate the vaccine war, the fear that vaccines are responsible for autism, a mysterious disorder that appears to be on the rise.

01:26:28.645 --> 01:26:34.648
has become well-known, partly due to the advocacy... Did Barbara Lowe Fisher say that her son had autism?

01:26:34.688 --> 01:26:35.548
I don't think she did.

01:26:36.548 --> 01:26:41.390
I don't think she said that he had autism, which is interesting to hear, if you just listen carefully.

01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:46.952
...of vocal celebrities like Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey.

01:26:49.173 --> 01:26:54.455
You're a shining example of unconditioned love, and we're so proud to be here.

01:26:56.898 --> 01:26:58.860
Today, I am not the celebrity.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.443
Today, I am a mom of a child who had autism.

01:27:03.703 --> 01:27:14.951
Former Playboy playmate Jenny McCarthy didn't know about autism until her son Evan received a series of vaccines, including the shot for mumps, measles, and rubella, the MMR triple shot.

01:27:16.192 --> 01:27:20.215
A few weeks later, Evan developed seizures and was diagnosed with autism.

01:27:21.272 --> 01:27:25.434
So I left that office devastated, hopeless.

01:27:25.934 --> 01:27:34.097
The next day, or maybe it was even that night, went on Google and typed in autism.

01:27:35.358 --> 01:27:37.398
She found the site for Generation Rescue.

01:27:38.259 --> 01:27:41.560
So I clicked on Generation Rescue and I found this community of parents.

01:27:45.734 --> 01:27:46.775
Preventable and reversible.

01:27:46.795 --> 01:27:46.895
Nice.

01:27:46.935 --> 01:27:47.335
He's got a good book.

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:48.015
He's got a good book.

01:27:48.035 --> 01:27:52.859
There were literally tens of thousands of parental reports of children regressing and changing after vaccine appointments.

01:28:11.283 --> 01:28:13.464
My child was fine before the vaccine.

01:28:13.484 --> 01:28:14.484
2018 book.

01:28:14.724 --> 01:28:16.004
He completely changed.

01:28:16.264 --> 01:28:18.005
After the MMR, he wouldn't look at us.

01:28:18.385 --> 01:28:19.945
Cole just stopped speaking.

01:28:19.965 --> 01:28:20.465
He got the shot.

01:28:21.045 --> 01:28:21.806
We started losing him.

01:28:21.926 --> 01:28:23.946
I think it's chapter four that's probably the best chapter in this book.

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:28.427
The vaccine most often blamed in these stories was the MMR triple shot for measles, mumps and rubella.

01:28:28.567 --> 01:28:30.668
Then she would get her second MMR.

01:28:31.653 --> 01:28:46.428
Few people without kids today realize that when a child goes in for a doctor's appointment and they're required to go in at two months, four months, six months, and 12 months to get their initial vaccines, there are literally somewhere between five and seven vaccines lined up on the table that are all given simultaneously within about 12 minutes.

01:28:46.528 --> 01:28:53.536
Your daughter will be protected against five things, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, and hip.

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:58.519
Well, tens of thousands of parents have reported that their kid was never the same after those appointments.

01:28:58.699 --> 01:29:06.427
The second data point is the knowledge that vaccines cause brain injury in a small segment of the population.

01:29:06.707 --> 01:29:07.228
We know that.

01:29:07.308 --> 01:29:08.369
The federal government knows it.

01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:10.511
They pay money to kids who've been injured that way.

01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:12.512
This is something that's been known for years.

01:29:12.992 --> 01:29:16.334
And then we also know that the number of vaccines given has risen dramatically.

01:29:16.374 --> 01:29:26.020
So it does not take a rocket scientist to draw a possible correlation between the vaccines being given and the brain injury that our children are suffering, because autism is brain injury.

01:29:26.301 --> 01:29:33.905
Combining his resources and her celebrity, Handley and McCarthy have been highly effective at organizing a movement of concerned parents.

01:29:36.447 --> 01:29:37.628
Hi, I'm Jenny McCarthy.

01:29:38.028 --> 01:29:39.889
I am here today to beg you guys

01:29:40.543 --> 01:29:49.487
The science that gave the movement its original impetus was a 1998 article by British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield in the medical journal The Lancet.

01:29:50.448 --> 01:29:57.951
He reported on 12 children with gastrointestinal problems, eight of whom developed symptoms of autism following an MMR shot.

01:29:58.512 --> 01:30:09.117
One of them is the daughter of Paula, the son of Paula Aitken, and she claims that her son doesn't even fit the profile that they claim he fit.

01:30:10.649 --> 01:30:20.637
and that she was able to help him a lot by changing his diet and they came and talked to her about it and stole all those ideas and has her all about it and never reported it at all.

01:30:21.177 --> 01:30:22.659
These people are awful.

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:30.625
And she's been scared for a lot of her life because of what she went through already before this shit ever started in America.

01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:35.311
I'm still in contact with Ms.

01:30:35.451 --> 01:30:37.552
Aitken.

01:30:37.612 --> 01:30:44.396
She also knows that that Brian Deer guy is fake and that Shatford is fake.

01:30:44.496 --> 01:30:47.058
All the people around this guy are controlled.

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:50.051
you know, opposition of one another.

01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:51.092
It's gross.

01:30:51.732 --> 01:31:00.080
And what they did during the pandemic is just, you know, magnified because of the ability they have from all the social media platforms.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:00.400
That's it.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:10.870
Wakefield's theory was that the measles vaccine inflamed the intestines, causing harmful proteins to leak into the bloodstream, eventually damaging the brain and causing autism.

01:31:11.851 --> 01:31:13.773
Measles, mumps and rubella given together

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.941
may be too much for the immune system of some children to handle.

01:31:16.981 --> 01:31:19.381
Clearly, for the vast majority, it is protective.

01:31:19.701 --> 01:31:26.222
And we must emphasize that it is just a small cohort of children, we don't know how large, but who appear to have developed this syndrome.

01:31:28.563 --> 01:31:36.145
News of Wakefield's provocative Lancet article spread across the world, creating fear that measles shots might cause autism.

01:31:36.485 --> 01:31:42.886
There was a dramatic decline in the coverage of young children with measles vaccines.

01:31:43.658 --> 01:31:47.080
Autism expert Eric Fambon was working in London at the time.

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:52.883
There were areas, like in urban areas, where it was even lower than 80 percent.

01:31:53.103 --> 01:32:03.489
And in Ireland in particular, vaccine coverage fell to close to 70 percent, and there was a big outbreak of measles occurring as a result of that fear.

01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:07.752
One hundred and ten infants were admitted in hospitals in critical conditions.

01:32:08.212 --> 01:32:12.714
and I think three of them died from measles, and measles is a preventable disease.

01:32:12.734 --> 01:32:18.836
— Parents reasonably thought, my child was fine, they got an MMR vaccine, then they developed the first symptoms of autism.

01:32:18.936 --> 01:32:21.417
Could it have been the MMR vaccine that caused that autism?

01:32:21.437 --> 01:32:23.037
That's a perfectly reasonable question.

01:32:23.057 --> 01:32:29.039
— The fact that two events happen close together might mean that they are causally related.

01:32:29.819 --> 01:32:31.620
But it could also be simple coincidence.

01:32:32.011 --> 01:32:37.876
This vaccination is given at an age where often the first symptoms of autism emerge.

01:32:38.056 --> 01:32:44.000
And typically, it occurs around 15 or 18 months of age when these children start to walk.

01:32:44.381 --> 01:32:49.064
And also, when we expect them to develop language, they usually fail to do.

01:32:49.385 --> 01:32:55.389
There are certain set of diseases that become apparent when children reach a certain age.

01:32:55.650 --> 01:32:56.951
That's not cause and effect.

01:32:57.911 --> 01:33:01.234
Just because one event followed another, it doesn't mean it was caused by the other.

01:33:01.766 --> 01:33:04.033
I mean, every morning the rooster crows, the sun comes up.

01:33:04.073 --> 01:33:05.859
It doesn't mean the rooster's causing the sun to come up.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.988
The question is, was it caused by it?

01:33:12.441 --> 01:33:20.066
The funny thing about that is, is that unlike the rooster crowing every day and the sun coming up every day, you don't get vaccines every day.

01:33:20.106 --> 01:33:21.827
You don't go to the doctor every day.

01:33:22.267 --> 01:33:34.235
So if you go to the doctor and you come back and your kid stops talking or starts shitting his pants and banging his head, doesn't make eye contact anymore, and you hadn't been to the doctor in a year, that might be a sign.

01:33:35.556 --> 01:33:36.997
It's just still quite rare.

01:33:40.099 --> 01:33:41.400
That's the reality of this.

01:33:42.352 --> 01:33:50.555
And that's how they steered us into this shit show where vaccines cause neurological injury that is not autism.

01:33:51.536 --> 01:34:02.360
Autism is this other stuff, all these other childhood shortcomings that they put into a big, you know, bubble that can also be adult autism.

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.801
And even a guy who has a news program can be autistic.

01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:14.312
Autism is the canary in the coal mine.

01:34:15.553 --> 01:34:19.395
I believe that it's telling people that this vaccine program is imbalanced.

01:34:19.996 --> 01:34:21.597
It's a good thing that's gone too far.

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:29.483
Isn't the problem here, Jenny, that people sometimes casual or listen with one ear are going to panic and not vaccine at all?

01:34:30.924 --> 01:34:32.866
Probably, but guess what?

01:34:32.886 --> 01:34:34.507
It's not my fault.

01:34:34.587 --> 01:34:38.150
The reason why they're not vaccinating is because the vaccines are not safe.

01:34:38.769 --> 01:34:52.495
What we are saying is that the number of vaccines given and the ingredients, like the freaking mercury, the ether, the aluminum... Vaccine critics question not only MMR, but the many ingredients in vaccines.

01:34:53.235 --> 01:35:02.879
These included aluminum, formaldehyde, formalin, yeast protein, and a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal, used in multidose vaccines.

01:35:04.679 --> 01:35:08.081
One very influential critic is environmental lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr.,

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:14.103
So it's the combination of substances that's dumb.

01:35:14.944 --> 01:35:21.349
Anything that's considered a preservative or an excipient or anything like that or in trace amounts doesn't matter.

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:28.756
And so this is the part that is especially diabolical from an intramuscular injection perspective.

01:35:29.793 --> 01:35:45.283
because it bypasses all the barriers, all of the filtration, all of the possibility of the body avoiding the most toxic exposure and instead puts it in the place where it's most likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and leak in slowly at that.

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:57.044
are acknowledging that even tiny, infinitesimal amounts of mercury, parts per billion, will cause profound neurological injury in children.

01:35:57.644 --> 01:36:00.585
The biggest exposure is coming from our own vaccines.

01:36:00.845 --> 01:36:03.186
When I was a little boy, we only got three vaccines.

01:36:03.786 --> 01:36:07.688
But my children, five of my six children, got 22 vaccines.

01:36:08.208 --> 01:36:11.469
Beginning in 1989, that's the thimerosal generation.

01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:13.050
That's the vaccine generation.

01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:22.004
So the myc, the thimerosal generation, but the thimerosal was already almost out of the vex.

01:36:22.064 --> 01:36:25.191
I mean, it's so, oh my gosh, really?

01:36:27.844 --> 01:36:37.491
The mercury hypothesis had more plausibility than that for MMR because of the nature of mercury, which is known to be a neurotoxicant.

01:36:37.951 --> 01:36:41.294
But mercury poisoning does not resemble autism at all.

01:36:41.614 --> 01:36:49.580
The fact that mercury is a toxicant is not sufficient to claim that the mercury contained in vaccines can lead to autism.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:58.284
So it was critical, therefore, to follow up this hypothesis with properly conducted epidemiological studies.

01:36:59.245 --> 01:36:59.425
Oh!

01:37:00.765 --> 01:37:06.548
Remember that in 2025, on stage, Pierre-Corey also started with thimerosal.

01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:09.470
Even though it's not in anything anymore.

01:37:11.631 --> 01:37:12.771
Because it's a script.

01:37:13.171 --> 01:37:16.113
It's a really malevolent, terrible script.

01:37:17.236 --> 01:37:24.202
where any skepticism about intramuscular injection is neutralized because nobody says that.

01:37:25.463 --> 01:37:30.047
Any skepticism of transfection is neutralized because nobody says that.

01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:41.097
Any skepticism of augmenting the immune system with a combination of substances is neutralized because nobody questions it.

01:37:43.069 --> 01:37:50.855
The use of the word autism to describe neurological injury after intramuscular injection is never questioned.

01:37:51.816 --> 01:37:54.858
Because nobody says it, that autism is just a myth.

01:37:54.878 --> 01:38:06.327
Under pressure, public health agencies decided to act on the side of caution, rather than wait for the results of such epidemiological studies.

01:38:07.774 --> 01:38:15.177
In 1999, the FDA asked manufacturers to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as soon as possible.

01:38:15.797 --> 01:38:19.319
Unfortunately, I think it precipitated the notion that thimerosal was doing harm.

01:38:19.419 --> 01:38:22.080
And from a parent's standpoint, that, again, was very understandable.

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:27.342
Why would you take something out of vaccines in such a precipitous and frightening manner unless there was a problem?

01:38:28.642 --> 01:38:36.105
When I began my crusade for autism, one of the first speeches I gave was, is it mercury?

01:38:37.210 --> 01:38:38.811
Is it the schedule?

01:38:38.831 --> 01:38:40.352
Green the vaccines.

01:38:42.514 --> 01:38:46.356
My answer to people and what I've been telling them is it's all of the above.

01:38:47.077 --> 01:38:53.321
We don't know for sure, which is why we keep saying study it.

01:38:54.021 --> 01:38:54.882
But they won't.

01:38:57.569 --> 01:39:10.273
In fact, around the world, scientists had been studying groups of children, searching for a possible link between vaccines and autism, using the same epidemiological methods that linked smoking to lung cancer.

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:16.594
One country renowned for its epidemiology is Denmark.

01:39:17.795 --> 01:39:26.157
Unlike the U.S., Danish authorities collect demographic and health data routinely on the entire population in a series of national registers.

01:39:27.813 --> 01:39:34.556
They know when every child was born, when every child was vaccinated, and when every case of autism was diagnosed.

01:39:35.737 --> 01:39:41.920
It's sort of a paradise for epidemiologists because we don't have to work to collect this data.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.240
It is available to us.

01:39:44.401 --> 01:39:51.925
Anders Havid and colleagues at the Statens Serum Institute analyze data on all the Danish children born between 1991 and 1998, over half a million.

01:39:56.977 --> 01:40:02.658
They compared two groups, those who had received the MMR triple shot and those who hadn't.

01:40:06.579 --> 01:40:11.099
Then they counted the cases of autism in each group and calculated the autism rate.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.300
They found no difference.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.721
Children who didn't get the shot had the same risk of developing autism as those who did.

01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:25.902
The team published the findings in the New England Journal of Medicine.

01:40:27.139 --> 01:40:33.300
Other studies carried out by researchers in Sweden, Finland, Britain, and the U.S.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.461
also found no association between MMR and autism.

01:40:41.462 --> 01:40:43.282
Additional evidence came from Japan.

01:40:44.362 --> 01:40:51.724
The Japanese changed their vaccine schedule in 1993, replacing the MMR triple shot with three separate vaccinations.

01:40:52.552 --> 01:40:57.635
Of course, that's now assuming that the vaccination will have an acute effect, right?

01:40:57.715 --> 01:40:59.616
So that's the other problem.

01:40:59.676 --> 01:41:10.022
The story that CHD tells and that Pauly Tommy tells and that Lady Lowell Fisher tells is that their sons changed.

01:41:11.403 --> 01:41:15.025
Brian says his son changed after the vaccination.

01:41:15.105 --> 01:41:20.468
So what happens if the vaccinations are injected and the change occurs over three or four weeks?

01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:23.762
Now for sure the vaccine didn't cause it.

01:41:26.043 --> 01:41:27.204
That's the issue here.

01:41:27.284 --> 01:41:36.768
That's the whole problem with this, is that the rigor that they apply to this question is purposefully dumb.

01:41:38.775 --> 01:41:43.276
And the script that they've given us is purposefully dumb.

01:41:44.036 --> 01:41:55.159
All the actors in front of us that claim to have a kid that has autism have the very specific story, usually with MMR, but sometimes DTP, that their sons transformed.

01:41:55.239 --> 01:41:58.380
They changed very fast after the shot.

01:41:58.981 --> 01:42:03.962
But if a change that occurs very rapidly after the shot is very rare,

01:42:04.582 --> 01:42:17.028
like exceedingly rare, then none of those studies will ever find it, and they will prove once and for all that autism, that is supposed to occur after vaccines, doesn't really happen.

01:42:18.829 --> 01:42:21.030
Even if Mary Holland isn't lying.

01:42:21.230 --> 01:42:23.351
Even if Pauly Tommy isn't lying.

01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:25.432
Even if Brian Hooker isn't lying.

01:42:25.832 --> 01:42:30.554
They might be the only three people they could find with a... But it's not true.

01:42:32.035 --> 01:42:32.835
It's just not true.

01:42:34.534 --> 01:42:45.662
There are very rare examples all across a country of 350 million people that is giving this many intramuscular injections.

01:42:45.682 --> 01:42:55.930
There are going to be all kinds of examples all around the country of people that are damaged in a endless variety of ways by intramuscular injection of a combination of substances.

01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:57.792
The younger they are, the worse it will be.

01:42:59.133 --> 01:43:02.115
The younger they are, the more potential for extreme damage.

01:43:04.409 --> 01:43:28.415
and the requirement that the damage has to phenotypically show up in the parent's mind within a couple days in order for it to be the vaccines is already incredibly disingenuous because the only toxic exposure that these kids are having that bypasses all of the epithelium is that injection.

01:43:29.577 --> 01:43:56.615
Everything they eat everything that they get on their clothes or on their skin is not bypassing the immune system Anything that they eat can't even bypass the liver and So we are talking about acute toxic exposures with a access to the most interior well-guarded parts of our body

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:03.822
And we're not really differentiating that from other exposures.

01:44:05.883 --> 01:44:19.969
And even these people in this video are unable to differentiate between intramuscular injection and subcutaneous injection and oral administration of medicines.

01:44:20.429 --> 01:44:23.610
They're not there yet, or they don't get there, or they're scripted.

01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:25.591
It's really bizarre.

01:44:27.898 --> 01:44:31.041
But following the change, autism rates did not fall.

01:44:31.962 --> 01:44:37.748
In fact, they appeared to rise, thus making the triple shot an unlikely cause of autism.

01:44:38.849 --> 01:44:44.915
The Danish team now went on to investigate the second theory, the mercury-preservative thimerosal.

01:44:46.276 --> 01:44:49.840
It turned out that in Denmark, there was a simple way to test this as well.

01:44:50.678 --> 01:44:58.103
In Denmark, since the 70s, only one vaccine has contained thimerosal, and that was a pertussis vaccine.

01:44:58.463 --> 01:45:02.206
It contained thimerosal until May, June 92.

01:45:02.406 --> 01:45:06.208
Then the same vaccine continued, but without thimerosal.

01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:19.857
Havid and colleagues found that children who were given pertussis vaccines with thimerosal before 1992 had identical autism rates as children who received mercury-free vaccines after that date.

01:45:20.197 --> 01:45:26.802
we did not find any association between being vaccinated with the thimerosal containing vaccine and, and, and the risk of autism.

01:45:27.162 --> 01:45:43.895
So the funny thing is, is that exact same slam dunk was repeated on stage by professor Dave and Dan Wilson and Steve Kirsch and Pierre Corey, and they all acted it out.

01:45:45.592 --> 01:45:53.219
Like they were surprised when Professor Dave said, so when they took the thimerosal out, did the vaccines, did the autism go down?

01:45:53.359 --> 01:45:54.019
No, it didn't.

01:45:54.079 --> 01:45:54.680
So then what?

01:45:58.543 --> 01:46:02.467
It's exactly a, exactly a script.

01:46:03.328 --> 01:46:10.474
Other studies in the US, the UK and Canada also found no association between autism and thimerosal.

01:46:12.603 --> 01:46:30.499
In 2004, the Institute of Medicine carried out its own analysis of the research and concluded, The body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism and also between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.

01:46:32.338 --> 01:46:37.681
The allegations against me are both unfounded and unjustified.

01:46:37.701 --> 01:46:39.361
Then something extraordinary happened.

01:46:39.762 --> 01:46:48.606
On February 2, 2010, The Lancet retracted Wakefield's landmark 1998 paper, saying it was scientifically flawed.

01:46:49.767 --> 01:47:02.471
Scientists around the world had not been able to replicate Wakefield's findings, and it turned out that some of the kids in his small study had been referred by a lawyer who was suing pharmaceutical manufacturers on the children's behalf.

01:47:03.431 --> 01:47:12.254
But in the wake of the retraction, organizations like Generation Rescue came out in strong support of Wakefield, continuing to believe in his science.

01:47:13.812 --> 01:47:23.139
Soon after, parents of autistic children who brought class-action lawsuits based on the MMR and thimerosal theories had their hopes dashed by the federal vaccine court.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.320
And good evening to you.

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:28.423
We begin tonight with a ruling that affects millions of parents with children who have autism.

01:47:28.644 --> 01:47:34.168
Families who went to a federal court over these vaccines were told their case was without scientific or legal merit.

01:47:34.827 --> 01:47:46.090
The vaccine court that Barbara Lowe Fisher's organization had helped set up issued a strongly worded ruling on March 12, 2010, denying a link between autism and vaccines.

01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:54.932
Scientifically, I think the matter is settled, but I don't think that

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:09.193
I think there are a lot of people who don't listen to science and don't understand it, so they're going to be difficult to sway with the scientific arguments.

01:48:09.534 --> 01:48:11.516
Don't give a f*** about what the MMR said.

01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:14.904
My kid got six vaccines in one day and he regressed.

01:48:15.424 --> 01:48:20.369
You don't have any science that can show me that the regression wasn't triggered by the six vaccines.

01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:24.513
What the parents are saying is, I went in for a vaccine appointment.

01:48:24.953 --> 01:48:26.755
My kid got six vaccines.

01:48:26.995 --> 01:48:30.238
There's a lot of parents that say it's a combination of vaccines.

01:48:30.278 --> 01:48:33.762
And I think that that's maybe the very rare event.

01:48:34.082 --> 01:48:38.525
You know, the very rare exposure, the very rare overload that happens.

01:48:38.605 --> 01:48:42.307
And I'm not denying any of these individual cases.

01:48:42.367 --> 01:48:47.511
What I'm denying is the absolute ridiculousness or the reality that we have.

01:48:48.892 --> 01:48:51.233
That guy's not on stage right now.

01:48:51.313 --> 01:48:53.314
This guy's not at CHD.

01:48:53.374 --> 01:48:57.037
This guy's not the one that's talking to us right now, right?

01:48:57.077 --> 01:48:58.058
You understand that.

01:48:58.758 --> 01:49:01.720
He's got a good book, but nobody's selling it.

01:49:03.735 --> 01:49:05.496
He didn't get on Joe Rogan.

01:49:06.156 --> 01:49:11.538
Suzanne fricking Humphreys got on Joe Rogan and talked about fricking cinnamon.

01:49:12.298 --> 01:49:17.180
Two and a half hours she was on that show and couldn't say what he just said.

01:49:22.703 --> 01:49:23.463
And they regressed.

01:49:24.531 --> 01:49:30.854
We need to ask the question as to why the regression took place, not whether the regression took place, why the regression took place.

01:49:31.214 --> 01:49:38.378
The only way to do that is to look at that load of vaccines and compare a group of kids or a group of animals who got the load and who didn't.

01:49:39.138 --> 01:49:41.579
If you're going to do epidemiology, let's ask the right question.

01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:48.022
Let's not confine it to MMR, and let's not confine it to one component in a vaccine, mercury.

01:49:48.562 --> 01:49:51.324
You have to do bench science.

01:49:51.664 --> 01:49:53.565
You have to look at

01:49:55.610 --> 01:50:01.257
the human body and what occurs in terms of changes in immune function, brain function.

01:50:01.417 --> 01:50:05.683
You can't just do epidemiology where you're comparing groups of children against each other.

01:50:05.843 --> 01:50:08.206
It's funny how she's not in front of us really either.

01:50:08.286 --> 01:50:10.088
She was at the Senate hearing of

01:50:10.689 --> 01:50:24.583
Senator Ron Johnson, like the fourth one he held, but she was surrounded by all these jackasses from Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone to Brett Weinstein and Brian Hooker and Del Bigtree and Jessica Rose.

01:50:24.623 --> 01:50:25.904
I mean, it was a shit show.

01:50:26.304 --> 01:50:28.747
So maybe this lady isn't so bad.

01:50:29.447 --> 01:50:35.033
You know, maybe that lady and, and, and Mr. Handley aren't so bad, but they're not in front of us.

01:50:36.798 --> 01:50:42.444
And Robert Malone, I mean, neither of those two got on the ACIP.

01:50:42.925 --> 01:50:44.907
Robert Malone got on the ACIP.

01:50:45.007 --> 01:50:46.809
You see the problem here?

01:50:51.178 --> 01:50:57.084
Vaccine critics say many more studies are needed before scientists can rule out side effects like autism.

01:50:57.804 --> 01:51:07.554
Studies of the other vaccines, studies of multiple additives, and studies to see if certain children are genetically predisposed to a vaccine reaction.

01:51:08.074 --> 01:51:09.836
The hypotheses continue to shift.

01:51:09.856 --> 01:51:13.680
The first hypothesis, which, you know, people bought into long and hard,

01:51:14.130 --> 01:51:17.613
is that the combination measles, mumps, rubella, or MMR vaccine caused autism.

01:51:17.633 --> 01:51:20.455
12 epidemiological studies showed that that wasn't true.

01:51:21.236 --> 01:51:32.865
Then the hypothesis shifted to thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative that was in vaccines, that's no longer written in vaccines, but except for some multi-dose preparations of flu vaccine, that that caused autism.

01:51:33.205 --> 01:51:34.987
And that clearly has been shown not to be true.

01:51:35.646 --> 01:51:39.589
So now, and this is classic for pseudoscience, is you just keep moving the goalposts.

01:51:39.609 --> 01:51:46.054
So now the goalpost is, no, we didn't mean actually MMR caused autism or thimerosal caused autism, we just meant vaccines in general caused autism.

01:51:46.915 --> 01:51:57.863
In the vaccine war, two kinds of knowledge compete for the public attention, the collective but dry conclusions of the scientific community and the personal anecdotes of parents.

01:51:59.332 --> 01:52:00.773
Something happened.

01:52:01.453 --> 01:52:09.038
And when I say something, I mean a behavior, a trigger, something different happened to our children, which then led to autism.

01:52:09.419 --> 01:52:10.920
Do I know that exact link?

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:11.580
No.

01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:15.262
I don't have that proof, but I've got evidence in Evan.

01:52:15.522 --> 01:52:16.163
Just one leaf?

01:52:16.183 --> 01:52:16.263
Yeah.

01:52:17.944 --> 01:52:22.587
And I've got evidence in thousands and hundreds of thousands of parents all over the world.

01:52:23.327 --> 01:52:28.711
And these are the mommy warriors that will make change because we have to.

01:52:30.014 --> 01:52:38.740
It's a tragedy that there are kids who are unprotected because their parents are choosing not to vaccinate out of fears that are unfounded.

01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:56.752
The other tragedy is that the kids who have autism, who desperately need better research into why and, more important, what to do about it now, that research isn't being done, at least to the degree that it should have been, because most of the would-be research, those dollars and hours have been lost.

01:53:08.126 --> 01:53:21.378
CDC is involved in a five-year study called SEED, the Study to Explore Early Development, to help identify what might put children at risk for autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities.

01:53:23.083 --> 01:53:26.725
But it's not clear that such scientific studies will settle the vaccine war.

01:53:27.546 --> 01:53:38.833
To the contrary, public skepticism of scientific authority seems to be growing, fueled in part by a new battleground where ideas fight for public attention, the Internet.

01:53:42.455 --> 01:53:44.737
Thank you for calling CDC Info.

01:53:46.391 --> 01:53:48.593
It's not just about the science.

01:53:49.113 --> 01:53:49.954
We wish it were.

01:53:50.434 --> 01:53:53.116
Unfortunately, the issue persists.

01:53:53.396 --> 01:53:58.460
And one of the challenges is that once something gets up on the internet, it's there.

01:53:59.741 --> 01:54:06.846
There are new cohorts of parents every day going to the internet, reading about that for the first time.

01:54:07.286 --> 01:54:15.252
The web really has served to keep these controversies alive that really should be

01:54:16.007 --> 01:54:16.968
non-controversies.

01:54:17.148 --> 01:54:23.292
There's absolutely no control over what appears on the internet and you can post anything you like, true or not.

01:54:27.215 --> 01:54:31.018
Those original myths are still there and they're hard to counteract.

01:54:32.079 --> 01:54:37.163
Conspiracy theories tend to be popular and it's hard to undo that kind of damage.

01:54:37.652 --> 01:54:39.733
I spoke recently at a high school near here.

01:54:39.753 --> 01:54:41.434
There were about 200 people in the audience.

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:44.436
And I asked them how many had gotten the influenza vaccine.

01:54:44.516 --> 01:54:45.797
And about half raised their hands.

01:54:46.197 --> 01:54:57.103
Of the half that didn't raise their hands, they said they didn't get it because on YouTube, they saw a Redskins cheerleader say that she had gotten the vaccine and had a so-called dystonic reaction.

01:54:57.544 --> 01:55:01.206
She's the beautiful cheerleader whose heartbreaking story is shocking the nation.

01:55:02.853 --> 01:55:09.438
This clip of Redskins cheerleader Desiree Jennings went viral on the web after a local Fox News station broke the story.

01:55:10.519 --> 01:55:17.163
She reported a bizarre neurological reaction to a flu vaccine that caused her to be able only to walk backwards.

01:55:20.186 --> 01:55:21.747
It's a bizarre reaction.

01:55:21.827 --> 01:55:25.309
Bizarre means odd and rare, right?

01:55:25.489 --> 01:55:28.091
I mean, a bizarre reaction.

01:55:28.912 --> 01:55:29.092
Huh.

01:55:32.461 --> 01:55:35.085
Odd and rare reaction.

01:55:36.046 --> 01:55:37.288
Is it real or not real?

01:55:39.249 --> 01:55:43.372
Her story's been viewed and shared almost two and a half million times.

01:55:43.592 --> 01:55:44.993
Desiree can run just fine.

01:55:45.033 --> 01:55:46.534
It's only when she stops.

01:55:47.675 --> 01:55:49.216
You see, that's where the spasms start.

01:55:49.336 --> 01:55:50.497
Now, you can walk backwards, though.

01:55:50.597 --> 01:56:01.824
The students who sat in that room were much more likely to believe something they had seen on YouTube from a Washington Redskins cheerleader than they would have believed something that they would have heard from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

01:56:01.844 --> 01:56:03.185
Wow, he's calling her a liar.

01:56:03.225 --> 01:56:04.646
Yeah, because that's a little frightening.

01:56:04.866 --> 01:56:06.528
Dang, he's calling her a liar.

01:56:06.548 --> 01:56:08.089
After dinner courses for Desiree on YouTube,

01:56:08.789 --> 01:56:16.893
Generation Rescue became involved in her treatment, connecting her with a controversial osteopath, Dr. Rashid Buttar in North Carolina.

01:56:16.913 --> 01:56:17.874
Holy shit!

01:56:17.894 --> 01:56:19.074
She flew out to see this doctor.

01:56:19.234 --> 01:56:26.898
He chelated her and did hyperbaric chamber treatments and many other type of biomedical therapies that we do with our kids.

01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:29.760
And she got better quick.

01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:36.083
After a few days of treating her, she was down to about seven seizures a day and speaking and walking.

01:56:36.543 --> 01:56:37.704
Look at Desiree now.

01:56:38.408 --> 01:56:46.531
Upon finding her cured of a supposedly incurable condition, the media now presented her story as a hoax.

01:56:49.132 --> 01:56:54.215
By now it had emerged that her admitting neurologist suspected Desiree's condition was psychogenic.

01:56:54.255 --> 01:56:54.795
Or it went away.

01:57:00.456 --> 01:57:06.299
inactive, misleading, and destructive information can get widely spread.

01:57:06.499 --> 01:57:10.201
So it is tough in the age of the internet.

01:57:10.301 --> 01:57:15.244
I think the internet has been fuel on the fire of anti-vaccine fears.

01:57:15.884 --> 01:57:19.086
I think that guy might be Robert Malone's ethical advisor.

01:57:19.773 --> 01:57:31.441
There's plenty of websites out there putting out information about people alleging all kinds of complications and problems with vaccines, their own pet theories about what might be dangerous about vaccines.

01:57:31.961 --> 01:57:37.525
So there are oodles of sources of lousy, dangerous information out there.

01:57:38.245 --> 01:57:45.290
But advocates like Barbara Lowe Fishers see the Internet as a democratizing force that has empowered people to challenge medical dogma.

01:57:46.211 --> 01:57:49.633
When I first started this work in the early 80s, I had

01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:53.941
a selector typewriter, and I had the post office.

01:57:54.541 --> 01:57:54.961
That's it.

01:57:55.761 --> 01:58:00.342
Today, you have access to the library of medicine on the Internet.

01:58:01.502 --> 01:58:04.163
You can communicate with people all over the world.

01:58:04.483 --> 01:58:05.883
So it has changed everything.

01:58:06.803 --> 01:58:15.345
In this new world, many parents are no longer willing to take the word of their doctor on faith or to accept the conclusions of the medical establishment.

01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:17.762
Barbara is still around.

01:58:17.862 --> 01:58:19.563
She still runs that organization.

01:58:19.603 --> 01:58:21.584
They just don't use her for anything.

01:58:21.644 --> 01:58:24.006
She's just over there, you know, running in a wheel.

01:58:25.347 --> 01:58:33.872
While these people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you know, shake Albert Bourla's hand and perform the roles that they're supposed to perform.

01:58:35.072 --> 01:58:35.513
That's it.

01:58:36.213 --> 01:58:39.055
I assume at this stage that Barbara's pretty pissed.

01:58:39.155 --> 01:58:39.835
I don't know, maybe.

01:58:39.855 --> 01:58:44.138
Frustrating public officials charged with protecting the health of the community.

01:58:45.276 --> 01:58:51.179
I am a mother of a two-and-a-half-year-old and haven't done any vaccines at all, and I feel very safe and very comfortable with my decisions.

01:58:52.059 --> 01:59:05.326
I'm a midwife, and I'm also the co-leader of the Rogue Valley Holistic Moms Network, which is a national... Ashland's public health officer, Dr. Jim Shames, meets periodically with parents to talk about their responsibilities for the public health.

01:59:05.826 --> 01:59:12.289
Do you feel that when you say, no, thank you, that you might be putting anybody else at risk besides your child?

01:59:12.785 --> 01:59:14.726
This is the major thing that we're always up against.

01:59:15.206 --> 01:59:17.288
Public health officials are looking at the good for all.

01:59:17.828 --> 01:59:20.370
Mothers are looking at the good for their one child.

01:59:20.530 --> 01:59:22.551
And that's very important for them.

01:59:22.631 --> 01:59:23.651
It's the most important thing.

01:59:23.691 --> 01:59:24.332
It's their world.

01:59:24.932 --> 01:59:31.856
When you make that decision for your child, which you have a right to do, do you think you may be affecting other children?

01:59:32.076 --> 01:59:37.980
Do I believe... How can they... They should have a biologically plausible explanation for how.

01:59:41.246 --> 01:59:52.590
If the vaccinated kids are fine, and they don't carry the deadly pathogen, then again, who's carrying it?

01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:53.311
That kid?

01:59:54.249 --> 01:59:56.471
And they don't carry it if they don't have it, right?

01:59:56.511 --> 02:00:00.274
So then how are they putting anybody in danger until they have measles?

02:00:00.755 --> 02:00:06.160
So then they have to have measles and go out and then endanger people who are not vaccinated.

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:15.188
I still don't understand how this argument is being made successfully for so fricking long, because it's so stupid.

02:00:16.369 --> 02:00:18.591
Even a recording of Anne Rand.

02:00:19.462 --> 02:00:26.885
can clearly hear her explaining why vaccines can never be mandatory if they work the way they say they work.

02:00:27.526 --> 02:00:29.446
Because it just doesn't make any sense.

02:00:30.227 --> 02:00:35.609
Because the only person you're putting in danger by not taking a vaccine that works is yourself.

02:00:37.110 --> 02:00:38.491
Anne Rand said that.

02:00:40.111 --> 02:00:41.912
Like, this is just absurdity.

02:00:43.293 --> 02:00:43.673
And these

02:00:45.014 --> 02:01:04.165
These people, a decade ago, are trying to get somewhere, are trying to get to a destination where they can actually say something as clever as intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is a really dumb idea that stems all the way back from the late 1800s.

02:01:04.185 --> 02:01:06.006
But they haven't gotten there yet in 2015.

02:01:06.046 --> 02:01:08.127
And by design, they never get there.

02:01:14.977 --> 02:01:23.101
Because people like Brian Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:01:23.241 --> 02:01:26.083
sell all those people out if they don't kill them first.

02:01:27.203 --> 02:01:29.504
Like they did Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

02:01:30.445 --> 02:01:40.330
Tony Bark said that she saw kids get hurt from vaccines and asked the question in her pediatrics department why people didn't talk about it.

02:01:41.630 --> 02:01:42.891
She had to be killed.

02:01:44.528 --> 02:01:47.209
that I'm causing harm by not vaccinating my child.

02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:48.130
No, I don't.

02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:51.051
Because if the vaccines work, who am I putting at risk?

02:01:51.531 --> 02:01:52.811
So let's talk about that.

02:01:52.831 --> 02:01:55.172
Now, not everybody can get immunized.

02:01:55.493 --> 02:01:59.214
That child right there is probably too young to get immunized against pertussis.

02:01:59.674 --> 02:02:05.417
If your child gets pertussis by not getting the vaccine, and your child passes it on to a

02:02:06.789 --> 02:02:08.110
delicate newborn.

02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:09.711
I really don't believe it.

02:02:09.791 --> 02:02:19.578
I feel like I, um, first of all, I feel like it would be responsible to then quarantine my child and not expose them to other, you know, potentially, um, fragile populations.

02:02:19.858 --> 02:02:22.000
A lot of diseases are transmitted before you even know you're sick.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.382
It's my responsibility as a parent.

02:02:24.622 --> 02:02:28.625
A lot of things are transmitted before you even know you're sick.

02:02:30.134 --> 02:02:33.475
Wow, it sounds like he knows all of his pandemic biology already.

02:02:34.135 --> 02:02:36.116
To keep my child safe, I think.

02:02:36.296 --> 02:02:41.778
And I don't think it's your responsibility to take a vaccine because I might be at the same party with you and you might cough on her.

02:02:42.278 --> 02:02:45.679
Honestly, I think your job is to protect your own health.

02:02:45.739 --> 02:02:49.560
And I mean, maybe I sound, I really don't mean to be sounding selfish in that way.

02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:59.743
There has to be some step beyond just I take responsibility for me and my kids because there's things that happen in the best of intentions that diseases do get transmitted.

02:03:00.922 --> 02:03:06.067
For these Ashland mothers, health is a private affair, not a public responsibility.

02:03:06.687 --> 02:03:12.152
For them, refusing a vaccine is no more significant than refusing any medication for your child.

02:03:12.712 --> 02:03:15.255
But scientists say vaccines are special.

02:03:15.814 --> 02:03:18.777
Vaccines have an odd power that drugs don't have.

02:03:18.817 --> 02:03:20.859
If I take a drug, it doesn't help you.

02:03:21.579 --> 02:03:28.426
But if I get vaccinated and some others get vaccinated, then you may be benefited by so-called herd immunity.

02:03:29.047 --> 02:03:29.787
Oh, wow.

02:03:29.887 --> 02:03:30.668
Herd immunity.

02:03:30.688 --> 02:03:35.613
You know, that stuff that Del Bigtree talked about in 2017, right?

02:03:36.093 --> 02:03:38.836
They all talk about it because herd immunity is a real thing.

02:03:41.175 --> 02:03:49.182
In other words, if a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated, that will stop infections from spreading, because most of the people around that child are vaccinated.

02:03:49.202 --> 02:03:51.444
So, therefore, the virus can't really spread.

02:03:51.484 --> 02:03:58.430
However, when a critical number of people aren't vaccinated, when there's a critical drop in herd immunity, then the viruses can spread.

02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:03.294
And not only are those children who aren't vaccinated at risk, but those who can't be vaccinated are at risk.

02:04:04.516 --> 02:04:08.259
When enough people don't vaccinate, herd immunity begins to crumble.

02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.562
I'm still trying to decide who can't be vaccinated.

02:04:11.642 --> 02:04:12.783
Who are those people?

02:04:13.024 --> 02:04:13.904
People with AIDS?

02:04:14.545 --> 02:04:25.974
Who are those hypothetical children that can't be vaccinated but are out in public all the time, taking the risk because, you know, they assume that everybody else is vaccinated?

02:04:25.994 --> 02:04:28.536
I mean, it's just a weird, it's bullshit.

02:04:28.796 --> 02:04:30.378
Like, seriously, it's bullshit.

02:04:30.878 --> 02:04:36.723
The first to suffer are vulnerable populations, those who, because of age or illness, can't be vaccinated.

02:04:38.544 --> 02:04:44.608
When Vanessa was six weeks old, too young for most vaccines, her only protection was from the herd.

02:04:45.629 --> 02:04:48.091
Then she came down with a severe cough.

02:04:48.611 --> 02:04:49.732
She turned totally blue.

02:04:50.512 --> 02:04:55.776
She stopped breathing, and we didn't know what to do to have her breathing back again.

02:04:55.816 --> 02:04:57.877
I took her outside, you know, bring her back.

02:04:58.358 --> 02:04:59.458
She wasn't responding.

02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:04.322
An ambulance brought her to the pediatric ICU in her hometown of Portland, Oregon.

02:05:06.141 --> 02:05:10.724
Fortunately, the intensivist on call that night was Dr. Cynthia Christophany.

02:05:12.305 --> 02:05:13.766
This was Vanessa.

02:05:14.947 --> 02:05:18.329
Oh, the one that she showed in the freaking... I look at the video and keep saying, Vanessa, take a breath, please.

02:05:19.210 --> 02:05:26.174
Because we knew that a child of that age, with an already narrow airway... I mean, they're using this lady for everything in this show.

02:05:26.234 --> 02:05:27.135
Holy cow.

02:05:27.956 --> 02:05:33.519
Baseline, who's not inhaling well, could easily lose consciousness from lack of oxygen and perhaps die.

02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:35.821
And they're giving her no oxygen?

02:05:36.451 --> 02:05:41.177
Dr. Christophany opened the infant's airways and sucked copious secretions from her mouth.

02:05:41.678 --> 02:05:44.041
Vanessa had pertussis, whooping cough.

02:05:45.042 --> 02:05:48.167
Her status was so dire, a chaplain was brought into the ER.

02:05:49.156 --> 02:05:53.858
Vanessa was 40 days old when she was diagnosed with whooping cough.

02:05:53.938 --> 02:05:58.481
So we were probably a week away from having her vaccine for whooping cough.

02:05:59.081 --> 02:06:02.382
So the only thing that will protect a kid like that will be the herd immunity.

02:06:02.763 --> 02:06:07.285
And in that case, it felt, I mean, somebody in the community.

02:06:07.305 --> 02:06:10.366
I mean, they script the guy, you know, they script him to say it.

02:06:10.446 --> 02:06:11.307
It's just so stupid.

02:06:11.327 --> 02:06:14.208
He didn't vaccinate or got Vanessa infected.

02:06:15.549 --> 02:06:18.270
Maybe they helped him with his citizenship afterwards.

02:06:19.767 --> 02:06:26.831
After an exhaustive investigation, CDC traced Vanessa's pertussis to an infected student at her brother's high school.

02:06:26.971 --> 02:06:34.415
The CDC traced the infection back to a person at the high school.

02:06:35.156 --> 02:06:37.957
Holy- Stop lying!

02:06:38.818 --> 02:06:40.178
Stop lying!

02:06:40.619 --> 02:06:42.980
Oh my gosh, you gotta be shitting me.

02:06:45.526 --> 02:06:50.999
From the very young to the very old, scientists say herd immunity matters.

02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:54.026
The more immunity we have in a community,

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.601
the better it is.

02:06:55.621 --> 02:06:58.924
50% is better than nothing.

02:06:59.525 --> 02:07:07.192
And 100%, it's like building a brick wall around a city and protecting it against an enemy.

02:07:07.873 --> 02:07:15.521
It's excellent protection against something entering our community that could cause illness.

02:07:16.704 --> 02:07:24.126
Very strong herd immunity could completely eradicate many vaccine preventable diseases, rendering vaccines unnecessary.

02:07:24.926 --> 02:07:27.286
This happened with smallpox in the 1970s.

02:07:28.446 --> 02:07:29.267
A decade ago.

02:07:29.387 --> 02:07:30.427
That's interesting.

02:07:30.507 --> 02:07:37.008
I didn't know that we were going to progress to the point where we would eliminate a disease and not need the vaccine anymore.

02:07:37.088 --> 02:07:38.789
That's what happened with smallpox.

02:07:39.289 --> 02:07:39.889
Curious.

02:07:40.948 --> 02:08:04.655
smallpox is super contagious smallpox is super dangerous but we vaccinated everybody and it went away wow what a neat story i wonder when the next one of these 16 vaccine preventable diseases is just gonna go away because we got herd immunity so herded that it like herded it away it's gone

02:08:06.437 --> 02:08:10.845
The World Health Organization had plans to eradicate polio, followed by measles.

02:08:11.386 --> 02:08:17.357
But vaccine scares around the world serve to chip away at herd immunity, pushing these goals into the future.

02:08:17.805 --> 02:08:23.728
Many of these germs belong to us only, which means if we could make enough humans immune simultaneously, we could eradicate them.

02:08:23.828 --> 02:08:25.308
And then, yes, we could stop vaccinating.

02:08:25.769 --> 02:08:30.691
There was actually a campaign hoping to eradicate polio from planet Earth, as we did smallpox.

02:08:30.771 --> 02:08:33.832
And notice we're not vaccinating anyone for smallpox anymore because it's gone.

02:08:34.193 --> 02:08:43.717
But at the moment, at least, while they're in the world, there's still the potential for outbreaks if people are willing to stop vaccinating prematurely.

02:08:44.537 --> 02:08:49.061
Why is it so hard for some Americans to embrace this communal aspect of vaccines?

02:08:49.921 --> 02:08:57.227
Frontline turned to political scientist Hank Jenkins Smith, who surveyed a representative sample of Americans on their views about vaccines.

02:08:57.868 --> 02:09:02.632
Are you required, do you feel like society requires you to vaccinate your children?

02:09:03.525 --> 02:09:05.527
It never felt like a choice to me.

02:09:05.687 --> 02:09:11.112
I mean, from the moment I had him in the hospital, it was never, would you like us to give your baby these shots?

02:09:11.272 --> 02:09:18.378
So the two vaccines that kind of seem to work, the measles vaccine and the smallpox vaccine are both applied in your skin.

02:09:19.719 --> 02:09:23.102
Smallpox vaccine was scratched into your skin.

02:09:24.522 --> 02:09:33.609
So the only story they have of completely eradicating something is a application to the epithelium.

02:09:34.130 --> 02:09:38.453
The only other one that seems to work is supposed to be subcutaneous.

02:09:38.493 --> 02:09:44.018
The measles vaccine is supposed to be a subcutaneous injection, essentially a skin injection.

02:09:45.099 --> 02:09:45.940
It's interesting, right?

02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:48.822
Why did they choose that with Andrew Wakefield?

02:09:49.803 --> 02:09:51.644
Why did they choose that with Pauly Tommy?

02:09:52.425 --> 02:09:53.626
Why did they choose that with

02:09:54.372 --> 02:09:55.993
Why do they always mention that one?

02:09:56.053 --> 02:09:58.834
Mary Holland mentioned specifically MMR.

02:09:58.874 --> 02:09:59.594
Do you know why?

02:09:59.695 --> 02:10:00.875
Because that's why.

02:10:01.956 --> 02:10:18.163
To confuse and permanently disable any real argument that couldn't get at the heart of the matter, which is that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances is the stupidest form of medicine ever conceived by mankind.

02:10:19.364 --> 02:10:21.725
And just because you call it a vaccine, don't make it smarter.

02:10:23.322 --> 02:10:27.985
But vaccine makes it more confusing because there are oral vaccines that probably work.

02:10:28.566 --> 02:10:31.268
There are oral vaccines that probably aren't dangerous.

02:10:31.308 --> 02:10:36.611
There are oral vaccines like rotavirus might even help people.

02:10:39.253 --> 02:10:46.858
I know damn well for sure that an oral rotavirus vaccine will not be as dangerous as an intramuscular injection of anything.

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:48.239
It won't be.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:49.200
It won't be.

02:10:53.479 --> 02:11:04.551
Just like I know that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances derived from a Big Mac at McDonald's is a terrible freaking idea.

02:11:05.131 --> 02:11:09.756
But eating a Big Mac at McDonald's might just be kind of a, you know, not so great idea.

02:11:09.936 --> 02:11:11.038
Do you see the difference?

02:11:11.498 --> 02:11:13.861
How spectacularly different it is?

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.541
And then he makes the difference.

02:11:17.561 --> 02:11:19.162
The other guy made the differentiation.

02:11:19.182 --> 02:11:22.644
Well, when you take a pharmaceutical drug, you're not helping anybody but yourself.

02:11:22.684 --> 02:11:26.166
But when you take a vaccine, it's just so stupid.

02:11:27.527 --> 02:11:28.868
You know, it was like, we're doing this now.

02:11:29.808 --> 02:11:34.751
So I never felt like it was ever an option to not.

02:11:36.592 --> 02:11:39.274
There's that kind of odd pressure to vaccinate.

02:11:39.794 --> 02:11:44.277
And certainly I get a lot of expectation from relatives and, and,

02:11:44.989 --> 02:11:48.532
I think we might go to the same pediatrician.

02:11:48.972 --> 02:12:03.822
So if you pose a question to people about whether the acquisition of vaccines is a societal responsibility or a parental choice, they lean very hard in the direction of having it be a parental choice.

02:12:04.323 --> 02:12:08.345
And should the government be able to tell you that you have to vaccinate your child?

02:12:08.545 --> 02:12:11.888
I should do it for public health, but I don't think the government should require me to do that.

02:12:12.488 --> 02:12:13.389
I think I should have a choice.

02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:16.501
It's a decision that each family should make.

02:12:16.722 --> 02:12:18.223
I think it should be left up to them.

02:12:18.923 --> 02:12:25.548
When you make something compulsory, when the state can require a parent to have their children take a risk,

02:12:26.272 --> 02:12:31.416
So in 2015, they were already framing it about the mandate being the problem.

02:12:31.456 --> 02:12:32.516
It should be a choice.

02:12:32.616 --> 02:12:41.022
A big top tent of health freedom was already being seeded as the solution or narrative in 2015.

02:12:41.702 --> 02:12:51.989
So it's not very surprising that we're having CHD and ICANN doing that exact same job right now under the false pretenses of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:12:52.029 --> 02:12:55.812
being the Health and Human Services Secretary instead of just a scripted fraud.

02:12:56.432 --> 02:12:59.914
you introduce a whole new aspect to the problem.

02:12:59.934 --> 02:13:02.916
I mean, you think of the front lines in this battle.

02:13:02.976 --> 02:13:20.708
It's pediatricians and family doctors, and it's schools who will require that children have their vaccines up to date, and that these institutions that we have in place put a price on not getting vaccines.

02:13:21.929 --> 02:13:22.890
Hi, Jessie.

02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:24.551
How are you, girl?

02:13:25.976 --> 02:13:38.384
It feels a little bit lonely because sometimes it just feels like it's me as the pediatrician against the media, the world.

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:53.753
I think it's the most difficult when I have a family come in who's already, because of the internet, because of... Then she should take the responsibility to learn it better.

02:13:54.824 --> 02:14:01.569
Because right now we're at a stage where no doctor on earth that I know of could argue with me about this effectively.

02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:03.450
No doctor that wants vaccines.

02:14:03.490 --> 02:14:07.854
I mean, there are probably lots of people who know more about things than I do, obviously.

02:14:08.706 --> 02:14:34.451
If you're talking about like a family practice, general practice doctor in the greater Pittsburgh area that is advocating for vaccines or a nurse that would advocate for vaccines in the kids staying up to date on the schedule and it would load that tray of needles and bring it into the room or bring in another nurse for the other arm, those people,

02:14:35.271 --> 02:14:39.618
don't know enough about biology to talk about a lot of things to do with health.

02:14:40.199 --> 02:14:46.009
But with regard to vaccines and the immune system, they would be out of their league in less than 30 seconds with me.

02:14:47.296 --> 02:14:55.679
I know because I wrote a review on immunology and intramuscular injection for my doctor that he read in 2021.

02:14:55.919 --> 02:14:59.081
And then we basically didn't talk to him for a long time.

02:14:59.121 --> 02:15:01.141
We just went back to him and it was crazy.

02:15:01.221 --> 02:15:05.303
I told the story like three weeks ago, the guy's completely lost.

02:15:05.823 --> 02:15:10.245
And in all this time, during all the pandemic, none of them have learned anything new.

02:15:11.305 --> 02:15:12.886
It is fricking remarkable.

02:15:15.129 --> 02:15:20.491
the news broadcast because of something they've seen on YouTube.

02:15:21.171 --> 02:15:28.334
They already are coming in with their set ideas, and it's really hard sometimes to break through that.

02:15:28.834 --> 02:15:30.295
Pediatricians need to listen.

02:15:30.655 --> 02:15:33.436
They don't need to say, do it my way or take a walk.

02:15:33.516 --> 02:15:38.418
They need to say, how can I accommodate you so that we can both get our needs met in this situation?

02:15:38.973 --> 02:15:40.134
Have you talked to your pediatrician?

02:15:40.754 --> 02:15:45.197
The days of paternalism in medical policy are over.

02:15:45.597 --> 02:15:47.418
People are taking control of their own health.

02:15:48.338 --> 02:15:53.802
They want to be more in charge of the way that they live and not simply rely on a doctor.

02:15:55.322 --> 02:16:04.768
Physicians are going to have to get over the idea that they tell people what to do, and people are going to do it without questioning.

02:16:05.765 --> 02:16:09.167
Parents don't have unlimited rights with respect to the welfare of their children.

02:16:09.668 --> 02:16:12.029
You can't put them at risk of fatal disease.

02:16:12.369 --> 02:16:15.552
You can't put them at risk of devastating disability.

02:16:15.892 --> 02:16:18.153
You know, the ethics isn't just on the side of the critics.

02:16:18.574 --> 02:16:24.498
The ethics is also on the side of those who say, do good in the name of children, do good in the name of public health.

02:16:24.758 --> 02:16:25.718
Scary talk.

02:16:25.898 --> 02:16:26.259
Scary talk.

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.321
There's a lot at stake in the vaccine war.

02:16:31.062 --> 02:16:35.825
On the one hand, the fear that American communities will be exposed to serious diseases.

02:16:36.665 --> 02:16:39.227
On the other, something equally compelling.

02:16:40.187 --> 02:16:43.169
Every parent's wish to do what's best for her child.

02:17:00.104 --> 02:17:02.185
Interesting times, ladies and gentlemen.

02:17:02.245 --> 02:17:03.186
Interesting times.

02:17:03.206 --> 02:17:03.886
I don't know what to say.

02:17:03.906 --> 02:17:05.427
There's much more on our website.

02:17:06.007 --> 02:17:11.530
Take our survey about whether this program changed your attitude toward vaccines and join the discussion.

02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:13.071
Just a tiny little stick.

02:17:13.531 --> 02:17:15.352
And watch the program again online.

02:17:15.392 --> 02:17:17.233
Conspiracy theories tend to be popular.

02:17:17.334 --> 02:17:26.399
Read extended... Conspiracy theories tend to be popular is a thing that stupid people say, that scripted people say, because conspiracy theories

02:17:27.401 --> 02:17:35.393
is just a way of throwing a great big net over a lot of ideas and say they're all dumb because they're not the ones that everybody accepts.

02:17:36.354 --> 02:17:41.802
So I would love for that woman to explain to me how autism spectrum disorder is actually real.

02:17:43.012 --> 02:17:45.594
even though you can't be really specific about it.

02:17:45.954 --> 02:17:48.496
You can't be really specific about its causes.

02:17:48.856 --> 02:17:51.478
You can't be really specific about its mechanisms.

02:17:51.879 --> 02:17:54.921
You can't be really specific about its symptoms.

02:17:55.221 --> 02:17:58.163
You can't be really specific about how its onsets.

02:17:58.484 --> 02:18:01.326
You can't be really specific about whether it's curable or not.

02:18:01.686 --> 02:18:04.888
You can't be really specific about who really has it and who doesn't.

02:18:05.208 --> 02:18:08.871
You can't be really specific about who genes cause it and don't cause it.

02:18:08.891 --> 02:18:12.434
You can't be really specific about what environmental things can trigger it.

02:18:12.854 --> 02:18:16.221
But Autism Spectrum Disorder's definitely something.

02:18:20.905 --> 02:18:22.926
You're gosh darn right it's something.

02:18:22.986 --> 02:18:42.692
It's a frickin' stupid story that people tell so that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a dumb methodology from the 1800s, so that virology is never questioned as a science, period, and so that public health is just accepted whatever Paul Offit and the rest of them say it is.

02:18:45.495 --> 02:18:51.280
And pandemics and gain-of-function mythology have been used in exactly the same way.

02:18:54.502 --> 02:18:56.324
Like an intellectual baseball bat.

02:18:57.901 --> 02:19:05.289
and teaching our kids this bad biology 101 and the central dogma and therefore evolution needs to end right now.

02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:07.852
And there is an easy way to do it.

02:19:08.012 --> 02:19:18.583
I'm going to teach it class by class until we have a curriculum for high school teachers that takes into account the idea of the central dogma.

02:19:19.204 --> 02:19:29.052
but then doesn't trap us behind it, but instead uses it as a crowbar to break open and break out of this mess.

02:19:32.455 --> 02:19:36.839
None of these fools are gonna touch that stuff, so I don't even need to read it.

02:19:36.859 --> 02:19:47.348
These people are all frauds, they're all on a script, and they have been scripted for at least a decade, because this has been known to be coming for at least three decades.

02:19:48.305 --> 02:20:01.762
They took a background and they misconstrued it with a bunch of actors that were put in place in anticipation of a rise in the non-tax paying Medicare, Medicaid population.

02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:12.348
The ones with permanent disabilities that the government has to pay for for the rest of their lives, conveniently got COVID via supplementary oxygen and Bob's your uncle.

02:20:12.688 --> 02:20:13.989
We got the problem fixed.

02:20:14.730 --> 02:20:18.713
It's a rise in all cause mortality that they anticipated.

02:20:19.174 --> 02:20:21.555
And you can see it hit the top of the pyramid.

02:20:22.276 --> 02:20:26.800
You can actually see it hitting the top of the pyramid in this video.

02:20:31.263 --> 02:20:35.044
So they sculpted that rise using murder and lies.

02:20:36.264 --> 02:20:41.106
And the only people that have ever tried to put together a list of those murder and lies is me and Mark.

02:20:42.586 --> 02:20:44.507
It starts with supplementary oxygen.

02:20:45.307 --> 02:20:57.951
We learned that thanks to Scott Shara, who's now a totally scripted fraud, who came to my first annual live gigaohm thing and ruined it with a Satan video.

02:20:59.773 --> 02:21:04.316
and has never promoted my work since because he is a scripted fraud.

02:21:06.657 --> 02:21:09.578
And it's terrible to have to say those things, but it's true.

02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:16.142
And anybody that rises into clear view is thereby designed.

02:21:16.162 --> 02:21:20.625
The two party theater is false and it is run by the national security state.

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:27.108
You got to start getting your head around the idea that the Republicans and the Democrats aren't cooperating.

02:21:27.668 --> 02:21:28.609
They're acting.

02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:38.105
And the national security state is directing them with this script and podcast actors are now being militarized against us.

02:21:39.186 --> 02:21:39.926
And they know it.

02:21:40.907 --> 02:21:43.128
These scripted actors in government, they know it.

02:21:43.288 --> 02:21:44.489
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:44.569 --> 02:21:45.010
knows it.

02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:54.896
That's why he's sticking to the script, giving hugs to Albert Bourla, even though apparently he was a murderer a couple of years ago on X, according to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:21:56.656 --> 02:22:05.523
And these people are producing the theater that makes us think that real effective arguments are happening about all these things when they're not.

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:18.093
Our country is being dismantled, destroyed, undermined, and economically destroyed by these people and their handlers.

02:22:19.875 --> 02:22:22.177
We've only got about a decade to pull our heads out.

02:22:22.757 --> 02:22:30.862
Take control of our country again by electing people like me or Mark or anybody that you trust that's not a part of this shit show.

02:22:31.983 --> 02:22:36.886
But it's gonna take a lot more than tweeting and Facebooking and streaming.

02:22:36.946 --> 02:22:46.312
It's gonna take teaching kids and motivating college kids to run for office that actually understand the breadth and the depth of this show.

02:22:47.244 --> 02:22:54.031
It's not gonna be easy to bring them up to speed when they are on a two or three hour time horizon with social media.

02:22:55.573 --> 02:22:59.777
It's not gonna be easy to bring them up to speed when they think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:23:00.257 --> 02:23:04.322
and Donald Trump are actually independent operators and not just scripted actors.

02:23:08.544 --> 02:23:17.187
We've got to be able to explain to them why endemicity is a myth, both as a process and an endpoint, and racism and COVID are both not endemic.

02:23:18.687 --> 02:23:36.933
We got to explain to them how a background could be misconstrued as spread just with stupid lies about a methodology that anybody in academia should be able to explain why the PCR test for COVID was bullshit, but they can't because they won't do the requisite reading because they stay in their lane.

02:23:40.033 --> 02:23:46.654
But they threw me out, so I didn't stay in my lane, and now I can show you and your children how to get off of social media and why.

02:23:46.774 --> 02:23:49.035
So download PeerTube, join the fun.

02:23:50.115 --> 02:23:51.315
It's definitely a lie.

02:23:51.375 --> 02:23:52.696
It's definitely a lie.

02:23:52.916 --> 02:23:56.516
They've definitely hidden it behind this stuff for a real long time.

02:23:56.536 --> 02:23:59.637
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:23:59.877 --> 02:24:00.337
It can't.

02:24:00.977 --> 02:24:04.658
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

02:24:05.638 --> 02:24:09.801
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:24:09.821 --> 02:24:15.245
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

02:24:15.485 --> 02:24:15.965
It can't.

02:24:16.585 --> 02:24:20.748
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

02:24:21.249 --> 02:24:25.712
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

02:24:26.452 --> 02:24:33.557
Actually, JJ could be insistent, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:37.315
We gotta break the wheel, ladies and gentlemen.

02:24:37.355 --> 02:24:39.036
This wheel must be broken.

02:24:40.377 --> 02:24:44.300
We gotta break this bullshit hamster wheel that they have us running in.

02:24:46.802 --> 02:24:48.283
And we break it with the truth.

02:24:49.424 --> 02:24:50.544
This truth right here.

02:24:51.885 --> 02:24:53.326
Get some, ladies and gentlemen.

02:24:53.427 --> 02:24:54.267
Spread it around.

02:24:54.908 --> 02:24:55.668
Love your neighbor.

02:24:55.688 --> 02:24:57.049
See you tomorrow.

02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:58.971
It's Rocktober, baby.
