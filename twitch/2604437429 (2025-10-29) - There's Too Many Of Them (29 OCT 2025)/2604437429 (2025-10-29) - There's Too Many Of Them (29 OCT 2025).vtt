WEBVTT

00:23.408 --> 00:23.849
you you

01:29.637 --> 01:29.657
I

02:04.465 --> 02:07.849
Carry on my wayward son.

02:08.529 --> 02:12.274
There'll be peace when you are done.

02:12.694 --> 02:16.198
Lay your weary head to rest.

02:16.798 --> 02:19.081
Don't you cry no more.

03:12.668 --> 03:37.841
Once I rose above the noise and confusion Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion I was soaring ever higher But I flew too high Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man Though my mind could think I still was a mad man I hear the voices when I'm dreaming

04:12.560 --> 04:36.480
Winter rain is the event of the season And if I claim to be a wise man Well, it surely means that I don't know On the stormy sea of moving emotion Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean I set a course for winds of fortune But I hear the voices say

05:59.262 --> 06:02.801
Surely heaven waits for you

07:22.594 --> 07:24.075
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

07:24.155 --> 07:24.955
Welcome to the show.

07:24.995 --> 07:26.475
This is GigaOM Biological.

07:28.796 --> 07:32.938
A high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

07:33.078 --> 07:33.578
Look out.

07:34.659 --> 07:35.379
Gotta be careful.

07:36.819 --> 07:37.560
Gotta watch out.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.280
Got to watch out.

07:40.101 --> 07:41.521
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

07:41.581 --> 07:43.242
This is GigaOM Biological.

07:43.362 --> 07:47.743
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where we are trying to follow the moniker.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.524
Biology is the way.

07:49.584 --> 07:51.305
We're seeking the truth together.

07:52.596 --> 07:55.037
The voice that you hear again is that of Jonathan J Kui.

07:55.077 --> 07:57.117
I'm chief biologist here in the back of my garage.

07:57.157 --> 08:00.778
These pictures are taken in Norway back when I was still an academic biologist.

08:01.459 --> 08:08.841
You can find the stain of that work on the National Library of Medicine website PubMed with my last name Kui, first name JJ.

08:09.641 --> 08:12.162
I have been presenting my

08:13.402 --> 08:26.054
biological interpretation of this military exercise for about five years and for at least three of those years I have been spot on and basically where I am today and what I will present today.

08:26.074 --> 08:35.684
Again on PubMed you can even find papers that I helped write for the group drastic back when I was still thinking that this

08:36.522 --> 08:39.065
might be some kind of laboratory phenomenon.

08:39.906 --> 08:50.117
However, since then, I've learned an awful lot about molecular biology, an awful lot about the exaggeration that has been done with regard to the Human Genome Project and virology in general.

08:50.757 --> 08:57.485
And as I've said, I've tried to present these ideas to groups like PANDA or Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics or Doctors for COVID Ethics or

08:58.105 --> 09:06.749
the National Citizens Inquiry, the Wellness Company Steering Committee, or the Steve Kerr Steering Committee, and working for Children's Health Defense, and even helping write in a book about it.

09:06.809 --> 09:08.029
But still, it didn't work.

09:08.589 --> 09:20.974
I even presented my terrified stance at the Red Pill Expo, where I basically said that this was the first time, because it was, that I was actually coming out publicly and saying that I thought that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

09:21.014 --> 09:22.595
was a scripted fraud, that I thought

09:23.195 --> 09:51.129
that Pierre Cory and all of these people were recruited and part of a national security exercise that was part of a management scheme of the population pyramid and since then I've been person non grata nobody really just they just pretend that I don't exist so I've taken that free time to work on my basketball game and I'm going to be starting to teach this history and a new biology on the basketball court and hopefully that will transition me into a

09:52.501 --> 10:05.969
professional basketball player because as a biologist basically my career is over because I've been declared or at least my ideas have been declared chemtrail retarded and I've been declared barracks bitch boy by the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project.

10:06.049 --> 10:07.770
I guess that's basically strike three

10:08.470 --> 10:10.511
for any wannabe biologists.

10:10.531 --> 10:14.813
So it's time for me to be a biology coach on the basketball court.

10:14.833 --> 10:15.994
I'm very excited about that.

10:16.034 --> 10:23.678
If you like what you see here or the last couple of shows, if you found your way to stream.gigaom.bio, please download the PeerTube app.

10:23.718 --> 10:24.398
It works great.

10:24.438 --> 10:27.420
We just updated the website, thanks to Ted.

10:28.601 --> 10:32.343
And I updated the website so that it doesn't have the dark mode on it anymore.

10:32.403 --> 10:36.445
So when you go and you find it, Jason, I'm sorry you missed a Kansas song.

10:37.545 --> 10:42.250
The next song is not going to be Kansas, but there will be another song I think in this broadcast, so you didn't miss everything.

10:42.290 --> 10:42.950
Thanks for being here.

11:01.388 --> 11:11.993
Don't mind me, I'm just a smooth brained retard, at least apparently to the eminent, the incredibly intelligent, the all knowing, all powerful Dr. Jack Cruz.

11:12.113 --> 11:14.274
Now, you might ask, where did that come from?

11:14.354 --> 11:15.594
Let's dig into this a little bit.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.456
So I put out a little bit of a poll the other day was that.

11:20.737 --> 11:21.497
Oh, you didn't hear that.

11:22.677 --> 11:23.178
If I

11:25.444 --> 11:28.386
If you don't know who this guy is, you could try to find out.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.587
His name is Sean Baker.

11:29.627 --> 11:32.009
I'm not saying Sean Baker's a good guy or a bad guy.

11:32.049 --> 11:36.672
I think Sean Baker might be on the border of being recruited.

11:38.234 --> 12:04.568
And how they recruit you is they start to interact with you and they did that I think to Mary Talley Bowden and a few other people or Mary Talley Bowden did that to a few people like me And in this case, it's possible that Jack Cruz is starting to interact with this guy because maybe he's gonna be a pretty useful Health freedom guy and they need to keep him, you know running in the wheel Remember, he's been on stage with these people before so don't get me wrong.

12:04.608 --> 12:05.889
I don't think Sean Baker is

12:06.529 --> 12:09.771
is as outside of the illusion as I am.

12:10.411 --> 12:18.195
But he could be inside of their illusion and actually believe that he is part of something that is a real movement when in fact he's not.

12:19.036 --> 12:32.283
And I think there's a really unique possibility here, opportunity here, because he's a 58-year-old man who has worked out as a, like he's like 250 pounds, he's a monster, and he can dunk now.

12:32.803 --> 12:57.676
or at least I've seen a video of him dunking, and he interacts with me on X. So imagine the scenario where as they are kind of trying to interact with him and recruit him that he would stumble upon my stream that would explain what they're doing and why they're doing it and why it appears as though these people are spontaneous social media actors when in reality they are a network of scripted

12:58.758 --> 13:05.183
actors that goes from podcast to podcast and spouts very specific nonsense.

13:05.403 --> 13:24.117
And the coordinated nature of their script, because they are provided by the same source, results in a very confusing landscape of pseudo-intellectualism that they could use him to be a part of if he could be recruited and put into the right place and in front of the right people.

13:24.157 --> 13:26.599
And so listen to how they're recruiting him right now.

13:28.700 --> 13:33.682
Asking a simple question, what do you feel is the most important determinant of health?

13:34.082 --> 13:36.523
And I listed about five options in no particular order.

13:36.563 --> 13:42.426
They were nutrition, sleep, activity, exercise, stress, and circadian biology, or so-called light.

13:42.546 --> 13:44.686
Now, many people have different opinions on this.

13:44.786 --> 13:47.988
Most people agree that these all seem to have an impact on your health.

13:48.048 --> 13:49.408
And I think they all do.

13:49.608 --> 13:50.889
I think they're all very important.

13:51.249 --> 14:06.148
you could argue about the relative importance, but they're all greatly important in my view, but not according to perhaps Dr. Jack Cruz, who basically said this was something put out by a retard or a retarded tweet specifically, to which I, you know, politely

14:08.530 --> 14:12.551
responded, said, you know, do you think these other things are irrelevant and it's all about life?

14:12.591 --> 14:16.392
And I also inquired about his thoughts on obesity and light.

14:16.412 --> 14:18.732
Does light negate the effects of obesity?

14:18.872 --> 14:23.153
He then went on to respond saying, you are a smooth-brained orthopod.

14:23.173 --> 14:33.095
You know, like an insult because I was an orthopedic surgeon, which by the way, is one of the most challenging, difficult, and highly competitive specialties you can get into, even more so than neurosurgery.

14:33.315 --> 14:35.896
Orthopedics, you have to be incredibly, incredibly

14:35.936 --> 14:47.931
It could also just be that Sean and Dr. Cruz have been scripted to have this little argument so that people that are engaged with them engage with each other, right?

14:49.414 --> 14:51.457
That's another thing that could be happening here.

14:51.497 --> 15:04.514
And so this could be purposeful promotion of Sean Baker at this point, but just see what's going on here because some of the same notes are hit, some of the same sort of bullshit is done, and this is part of the theater.

15:04.855 --> 15:07.178
I'm quite certain this is part of the theater.

15:09.115 --> 15:14.257
successful, smart, hard-working, so on and so forth, to get into orthopedics if you're in medical school.

15:14.377 --> 15:15.838
Any medical student can tell you that.

15:16.578 --> 15:29.303
Aside from that, he goes on, you're a smooth-brained, idiotic orthopedic surgeon with some sort of gobbledygook answer you might expect from perhaps a politician.

15:30.543 --> 15:37.025
And don't misunderstand, here he is telling you you gotta look at X if you wanna follow this controversy, right?

15:37.085 --> 15:44.846
So again, kind of promoting YouTube, very much promoting X as a place where the truth is getting out.

15:44.966 --> 15:48.027
And I can't stress enough how ridiculous that is.

15:48.847 --> 15:58.030
How ridiculous it would be if somebody would say that Elon Musk saved free speech and deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for buying Twitter, for example.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.310
That would be absurd, right?

16:00.738 --> 16:02.379
on LSD or something like that.

16:02.579 --> 16:06.342
It's sort of this highly philosophical, basically nonsense.

16:06.462 --> 16:12.326
Okay, so then again, I inquired, I said, why are you what appears to be about 50, 60 pounds overweight?

16:12.406 --> 16:14.368
You've got this sort of big amount of belly fat.

16:14.628 --> 16:18.290
Do you feel that light negates any negative consequences of that?

16:18.891 --> 16:28.858
And to be honest, pretty much every single bit of scientific data would support that having excess potential, particularly central adiposity is an absolute disaster for your health.

16:29.638 --> 16:32.581
I don't see you can find any literature that would support where that is a good thing.

16:33.121 --> 16:41.268
Now, his response to that, I mean, not directly to me, but to other people that have asked about that over the years, because, you know, he doesn't appear to be in shape at all.

16:41.388 --> 16:43.970
He appears to be, you know, kind of an older guy.

16:44.010 --> 16:46.111
He's probably, to be honest, he's probably about my age.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.254
I'm almost 60, I think we're of a similar age, probably within a few years.

16:50.074 --> 16:55.359
And, you know, obviously, I feel that I'm in pretty decent shape, you know, physically, at least.

16:55.839 --> 17:07.711
It's funny that he's calling Dr. Cruz out, but he doesn't call out, like, Peter Hotez, for example, who's also horribly out of shape and overweight for his tiny size.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.274
But, you know, he appears not to be so.

17:10.454 --> 17:16.760
But he explains that away by saying that, you know, you can have a lot of excess fat as long as it's, you know,

17:17.601 --> 17:28.765
Leptin sensitive and light will have an impact on this and this is all purely conjecture speculative on his part probably just Deflecting or rationalizing why he probably can't stop eating junk food or whatever.

17:28.805 --> 17:45.170
He does see I see a lot of this editing as work as a person who does raw casting where everything that I do is like right now and If it doesn't work because my slider was down too far only if you had your volume high enough Did you hear the buzzer?

17:46.041 --> 17:51.606
That's because everything that I do is live and nothing that these people do is live.

17:52.807 --> 17:54.048
Nothing is one take.

17:55.309 --> 17:56.430
Everything is edited.

17:57.451 --> 18:03.816
And so already at the start, at this point, this is where the reality begins.

18:05.638 --> 18:14.205
If you want to get off of social media, you got to stop watching pre-prepared videos that are made by a team of people, even if it's just two.

18:16.038 --> 18:23.900
because the potential for scripting, the potential for perfecting the scripting is too high.

18:24.946 --> 18:29.287
And so if you want to know the truth, you got to talk to somebody who has a broken voice.

18:29.327 --> 18:31.288
You have to listen to somebody who's live.

18:31.308 --> 18:37.350
You have to listen to somebody who touches every button and cues every slide or however they do it.

18:37.870 --> 18:45.213
Goodness me, Jonathan Cooey has all these crazy graphics because he uses PowerPoint.

18:48.800 --> 19:00.210
Are you gonna tell me that any of these people are just not capable of producing a PowerPoint that reflects what they would like to say in an interesting enough way to augment their speech?

19:01.211 --> 19:09.959
Can you see how much of an admission that is that there isn't anyone on the internet that uses PowerPoint to teach anything, to make any points at all?

19:11.440 --> 19:12.981
Given how powerful it is?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.604
Nobody uses it.

19:16.943 --> 19:23.548
They instead make edited videos with clips that are in here and zooming in and zooming out.

19:25.650 --> 19:27.391
They're not setting up the cameras.

19:27.532 --> 19:29.433
They're not making sure everything is focused.

19:29.453 --> 19:33.757
They're not choosing the F-stop or the virtual ISO.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.139
They're not lighting and putting lights on the desk.

19:37.520 --> 19:42.564
They're not choosing what to put in the background based on what they've collected over their entire life.

19:43.953 --> 19:46.817
Their lifetime isn't represented in the background.

19:48.298 --> 19:50.921
My lifetime is represented in the background here.

19:51.943 --> 19:57.169
I can just go to that back shelf and pick up stuff from my real life.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.213
Not from a Cracker Barrel garage sale.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.397
Not from shit that Rumble brought into my house.

20:04.918 --> 20:10.029
Every single one of the things that's in my background here is something that I already understand and know.

20:10.109 --> 20:15.179
I know where it is, I know if my kids messed around with it, and I know why it's there, because it's mine.

20:16.135 --> 20:23.219
because I have this kind of weird collecting, nostalgia, old stuff thing.

20:23.979 --> 20:34.505
So I'm surrounded by stupid binoculars and random optics and all kinds of little gadgets that I found in laboratories that I've cleaned up over the years.

20:34.545 --> 20:38.287
There's four sets of walkie-talkies for I don't know why.

20:41.564 --> 20:44.185
And all of that stuff isn't there just by garbage.

20:44.225 --> 20:54.327
Those two lightsabers that are hanging there are lightsabers that my brother gave me for Christmas, for the last Christmas before he told me to fuck off and go get a hotel room.

20:57.828 --> 20:59.289
And my family fell apart.

20:59.349 --> 21:07.271
I lost my brother and my sister-in-law and my sister and my dad and my mom and everybody because, you know, they don't want to take sides.

21:10.953 --> 21:12.374
This is my life here.

21:12.794 --> 21:21.557
These books are bought with my own money so that I could read them and teach a biology that made more sense than the stuff on television.

21:23.418 --> 21:25.419
I didn't get in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

21:25.399 --> 21:26.599
's book by accident.

21:27.079 --> 21:31.261
I don't have viewers making me needlepoint on accident.

21:32.722 --> 21:37.744
I have that happening because I am one of the few actually real people on the internet.

21:37.844 --> 21:39.504
I don't make edited videos.

21:39.584 --> 21:40.645
I make live shit.

21:43.789 --> 21:57.112
And until you're following somebody who writes their own scripts and reads their own books and comes to their own conclusions and then tries to express it to you in a meaningful way, you're not watching anything on the internet but bullshit.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.707
It keeps him basically obese.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.548
Anyway, that is kind of the background here.

22:11.648 --> 22:23.192
And I will tell you that even if he is right, you know, even if he says, well, I can be obese and I can just have the light and it's going to, you know, protect me and give me greater longevity.

22:23.453 --> 22:31.156
And I will say that, you know, certainly we do know that light, you know, particularly latitude is an independent risk factor for longevity.

22:31.176 --> 22:31.916
Those people that live

22:33.604 --> 22:34.344
Strange, right?

22:34.384 --> 22:53.154
Because if he believes what he says, if somebody calls you a smooth-brained retard, and you don't respond by saying this person is pushing a bunch of nonsense about light, and go very specific on what he says that's true, like circadian rhythms are real, sure they are, absolutely.

22:55.735 --> 22:57.876
But that's not what Cruz says.

22:57.956 --> 22:59.657
That's not where Cruz stops.

23:02.543 --> 23:15.007
We need to wake up and apologize to our children for having fallen into this trap where we think that something's real is happening here, when it's just actors playing themselves in real life.

23:15.387 --> 23:20.969
And reality TV has become, podcast TV has become podcast governance.

23:22.589 --> 23:28.371
At the, you know, more equatorial latitudes tend to, when all the things are equalized, tend to live a bit longer.

23:28.931 --> 23:30.952
There may be some confounders within that, like, you know,

23:31.462 --> 23:34.745
warmer weather, more activity, on and on and on, you can imagine.

23:35.206 --> 23:41.512
But even if he's correct, I mean, even put himself, put him in the same position that Hickok is in right now, Hickok 45.

23:41.552 --> 23:41.692
Maybe.

23:44.850 --> 23:54.758
Maybe there's a small chance that Sean Baker's just a good guy who eats meat and lifts weights and wants to dunk and is now finding his star rising.

23:54.798 --> 23:58.141
And these people are trying to incorporate him into the show.

23:58.622 --> 24:00.343
They've had him on stage a few times.

24:00.383 --> 24:02.064
They've had me on stage a few times.

24:02.104 --> 24:07.329
They paid me to help write a book and put my name in the acknowledgements, in the index and in the quotes.

24:07.789 --> 24:09.711
So, you know, it can happen.

24:11.107 --> 24:15.989
And so it's possible that Sean Baker could be woken up to these retards.

24:16.049 --> 24:22.672
And he could start saying that, you know, intramuscular injections specifically, he would know because he's got so many fricking muscles.

24:23.919 --> 24:36.709
that intramuscular injection's just kinda dumb, and it wouldn't be better for him because he's got more muscles or something like that, and it wouldn't be harder on somebody else because they have less muscles, or would it?

24:37.169 --> 24:50.539
Or, see, we could get this doctor thinking, it's possible, we could get this doctor thinking about RNA versus DNA, or the idea that an old technology called transfection was renamed so that people like him wouldn't realize that it was happening.

24:51.576 --> 24:53.977
maybe Sean Baker could be woken.

24:54.037 --> 24:54.417
I don't know.

24:54.497 --> 24:57.477
Send him this video about some of these things.

24:57.977 --> 25:13.521
And if he wants to change the mindset of many people, which I hope to do, I hope that people will listen to me and hopefully improve their health by some of the things I've been helping with and many of you have, and certainly I appreciate the comments, you know, acknowledging that.

25:14.181 --> 25:27.878
But if you put yourself out there as a health specialist, a longevity specialist, a whatever specialist where people are going to take health advice from you, then you should at least appear to be healthy.

25:28.238 --> 25:33.404
Maybe that seems a little bit biased, but if you want to be taken seriously and not dismissed,

25:34.125 --> 25:35.345
then why not?

25:35.886 --> 25:39.547
You know, why not just present yourself as someone who's physically fit if you can?

25:39.847 --> 25:42.888
And if you can't get there, then you have to ask why?

25:43.268 --> 25:48.010
What is wrong that is preventing me from achieving at least the appearance of health?

25:48.330 --> 25:53.352
I do think that this is one of the things that Sean brings to the table that might make him a danger to them.

25:54.525 --> 26:00.327
Now I still will point out that these are edited videos, and it's possible that Sean is also a pretty good video editor.

26:00.367 --> 26:04.608
It's not like any of these tricks are exceptional, but it's just work.

26:04.768 --> 26:05.328
It's time.

26:05.609 --> 26:07.629
That's all I see here is time.

26:08.890 --> 26:19.153
Even the fact that my friend in Boston, Mark Kulak, takes the time to edit his videos a little bit and clean them up a little bit, that's time.

26:19.273 --> 26:22.454
And it's time that I've chosen never to put into any of my shows.

26:23.814 --> 26:29.378
One, because I don't know there's as much to cut out of my shows as there can be of other people's shows.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.960
And number two, because it takes away from the time to make tomorrow's show.

26:35.179 --> 26:48.392
It takes a lot of thought and energy to come online every day and do two and a half hours of this, especially with no script, no staff, no editing, no prompting, no table full of ideas.

26:48.492 --> 26:58.921
This is just me streaming from my heart based on the fact that the last six years have been populated by liars that are now on television and podcasts and social media rising.

26:59.642 --> 27:09.812
Rising, rising, while we still have 3,199 subscribers and less than 100 paying subscribers on GigaOMBiological.com.

27:09.852 --> 27:10.592
Think about that.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.695
I have less than 100 people willing to give me $10 a month.

27:15.905 --> 27:24.110
And that's just by design because nothing of the content on YouTube can be justified the number of views that it gets.

27:24.710 --> 27:31.454
These are not high level, high information, high entertaining, engaging videos.

27:32.202 --> 27:44.167
and they get thousands and thousands more views than anything that's produced by a thoughtful, live, PhD, academic, former scientific advisor.

27:45.527 --> 27:47.048
It's just, it's ridiculous.

27:48.368 --> 28:01.133
And I'm not whining, I'm pointing out the abject absurdity that we have an internet and a social media that is absolutely overwhelmed with nonsense

28:02.529 --> 28:12.255
And we are being told we need to worry about AI slop, and we are being told that we need to worry about Russian interference, and we are being told we need to worry about anonymous users.

28:15.536 --> 28:21.460
And we're being told that this is like a meaningful debate, you know, like this is important.

28:22.520 --> 28:45.460
These guys are important where they're really helping a lot of people say what's not all about looks is what's on the inside But I got to tell you a lot of it's about looks right people that can function at high level high capacity They're in shape that a physically fit are by and large healthier than those people that aren't that's just the way it is obviously I was basically my own business that all of a sudden I get this you're a smooth brain retard out of nowhere and I

28:45.800 --> 28:47.041
I've never interacted with this guy.

28:47.061 --> 28:49.562
See, I'm not, I wasn't minding my own business.

28:49.642 --> 28:55.706
I was part of Steve Kirsch's steering committee when the Steve Kirsch steering committee wanted me to do a presentation about clones.

28:55.726 --> 29:08.873
And then about a month later, one of the people that was in that presentation, the former research and development director of the Human Genome Project, Mr. Kevin McKernan, decided to write a whole substack about how those ideas were chemtrail retarded.

29:10.506 --> 29:17.390
Later calling me Barrick's bitch boy, but blocking me on X so that I couldn't defend myself or debate him in any way.

29:18.051 --> 29:32.700
Blocking me on Substack so that I couldn't reply with a note or a comment just the same way that Jessica Hockett has blocked me on Substack and X and everywhere else so that I can't interact with her misrepresenting my ideas in a shitty way.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.301
And so it's possible

29:34.881 --> 29:38.264
that they are trying to get in touch with him, trying to get him to interact.

29:38.304 --> 29:40.627
But remember, he's been on stage with them before.

29:41.368 --> 29:53.540
And so it's more likely that this is more smoke and mirrors in the wrong direction, keeping everybody running around in the metal sphere on motorcycles and bamboozled by the fire and smoke.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.250
before.

29:55.690 --> 30:06.675
I've been, you know, kind of tangentially aware of some of his work over the years and I do appreciate and I think he has helped to share some of the knowledge of the benefits of circadian biology and among others.

30:06.695 --> 30:09.456
He's not the only guy out there.

30:09.736 --> 30:11.897
Holy cow, is that bad?

30:11.957 --> 30:13.377
I mean, it's just really bad.

30:13.437 --> 30:14.538
It's just really bad.

30:16.058 --> 30:16.999
It's just really bad.

30:31.212 --> 30:32.773
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know.

30:32.833 --> 30:33.794
It's a lot of actors.

30:33.854 --> 30:38.258
If he's doing Botox, that would fit perfect into the narrative as I see it.

30:38.818 --> 30:40.360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.062
You're right in the middle of your hamster wheel week.

30:43.462 --> 30:45.784
And so I thank you very much for taking the time to listen.

30:46.565 --> 30:50.768
I'm going to bombard you with about six videos and then take off to basketball.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.271
So hang on tight, because it's a lot.

30:54.832 --> 30:55.412
It's a lot.

30:55.552 --> 30:55.953
It's a lot.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.871
Mark Kulak still kicking ass.

31:34.732 --> 31:41.035
Mark Kulak works at Housatonic ITS and Housatonic 2 on YouTube.

31:42.056 --> 31:46.399
Don't forget about Joe Marshall on YouTube and Rumble, the Liberty Perspective.

31:48.820 --> 31:50.541
I mean, I don't know who to point you to, really.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.303
I just know who not to point you to.

31:52.383 --> 31:54.544
I know how to tell you to get off social media.

31:57.526 --> 32:02.109
The illusion of consensus is still being maintained by Team Worst Case Scenario.

32:02.129 --> 32:03.950
I got lots of evidence of that.

32:05.091 --> 32:11.055
And I want to make sure that you understand that all these other people are not offering you a reason.

32:11.536 --> 32:12.937
I'm offering you a reason.

32:13.777 --> 32:20.582
It's because there's only one chance in history to collect the data that their AI could use to solve the Human Genome Project.

32:21.042 --> 32:23.624
That's the problem of all problems.

32:23.684 --> 32:24.905
The game of all games.

32:26.027 --> 32:42.338
And so they have been using a sophisticated means of manipulating our organized habits and opinions in order so that they can rule us that we wouldn't even know, that we might even beg for the system that they need to be implemented.

32:43.538 --> 32:47.441
And they have a very lively debate on shows like Joe Rogan, and here we are.

32:48.221 --> 32:49.782
We have a fractured country.

32:51.008 --> 32:59.153
And it's possible that the fracture is unhealable if we don't get the country off of social media.

32:59.173 --> 32:59.733
Well, it is.

32:59.974 --> 33:04.596
It is unhealable if we don't get the country off of social media.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.298
We need to raise children that don't use it.

33:07.358 --> 33:10.760
We need to interact with adults by not using it.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.982
We need to insist that other adults don't use it.

33:15.563 --> 33:16.684
Social media is

33:17.901 --> 33:21.564
their social control grid, and common sense will tell you that I'm right.

33:23.005 --> 33:26.287
Common sense will definitely tell you that I'm right.

33:26.927 --> 33:28.628
And non-compliance, that's what it is.

33:28.708 --> 33:30.169
It's get off of social media.

33:30.230 --> 33:35.493
It's not, it's not don't download their, don't use their QR code.

33:35.533 --> 33:37.194
It's don't use their social media.

33:37.254 --> 33:45.200
The truth is easy to see once you realize that even our very history, the history of this biology has been fudged by actors.

33:47.253 --> 33:55.375
And so they coerced the parents and then the parents willingly gave their children because, you know, submission is submission.

33:56.596 --> 33:58.276
And that's what these guys are all about.

33:58.296 --> 34:01.077
These are narrative control monkeys.

34:02.658 --> 34:10.300
Too bad we lost David Baltimore because now we have Vincent Rackin' Yellow in his place, which is a real, real lightweight.

34:11.820 --> 34:16.602
Things are becoming weak because the charlatans that are in front of us are weak.

34:17.679 --> 34:22.945
They are not all capable of staying on script if we learn the truth.

34:23.065 --> 34:24.867
They're just not capable of it anymore.

34:24.907 --> 34:25.628
That's my hope.

34:26.309 --> 34:28.011
That's the hope that I have to offer you.

34:28.051 --> 34:34.678
That you can learn enough biology to actually have a discussion with somebody like Kevin McKernan and destroy him.

34:35.649 --> 34:39.991
You have enough, there is enough biology out there that you can find it and learn it.

34:40.011 --> 34:55.859
It'd be ideal if everybody's life path crossed gigaohm at some time or another, but as long as we get this biology out and people should have known better, are held to the fire, are held to account, then we're gonna be okay.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.862
But the illusion does require your participation to sustain.

35:03.692 --> 35:05.413
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

35:05.514 --> 35:07.815
Transfection of healthy people was crazy.

35:08.736 --> 35:09.997
RNA can't pandemic.

35:10.037 --> 35:10.998
Of course it can't!

35:13.400 --> 35:19.945
And we got to take back these words and these concepts and be able to articulate them in a way that they can't argue with.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.006
That's what I'm trying to do here on this screen.

35:22.086 --> 35:26.790
Please screenshot this, learn it, and maybe try to prove them wrong.

35:27.431 --> 35:32.495
Maybe try to understand what they mean and in a big way, especially that last one.

35:34.349 --> 35:39.233
especially this last one, just not in the ways you've been fooled into believing.

35:39.354 --> 35:42.576
That's what the anti-vax, the fake anti-vax movement was all about.

35:43.177 --> 35:49.803
It's been a long journey from Marvin the Martian to here, but we are definitely here.

35:49.883 --> 35:52.986
Biology is the way, life is a pattern, integrity.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.707
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

35:54.727 --> 35:58.130
I sued the Biden administration and I won that lawsuit.

35:59.171 --> 36:12.661
And what we found through discovery was that 37 hours after President Biden took the oath of office, swearing to uphold the Constitution, he appointed a group in the White House to censor me and other people.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.023
But I was the first one censored.

36:16.203 --> 36:24.249
And we now have the emails between him and this group and Mark Zuckerberg and other people

36:25.319 --> 36:28.461
Twitter, et cetera, which Elon made public.

36:29.602 --> 36:33.644
Now remember, this is the guy who is on video.

36:33.704 --> 36:35.886
They just showed it on Frontline PBS.

36:35.926 --> 36:38.047
Let me just run it around a little bit longer.

36:38.227 --> 36:40.508
And thank God for him.

36:46.132 --> 36:47.493
And made public.

36:49.094 --> 36:51.095
And other people at People.

36:51.873 --> 36:56.941
But I was the first one censored, and they took the oath of office, swearing to uphold the Constitution.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.085
He appointed a group in the White House.

37:00.165 --> 37:05.773
Now remember, this is a man who's on video, and they showed it on a PBS Frontline video last week.

37:06.826 --> 37:11.149
that he said that the vaccine schedule in America is equivalent to Nazi death camps.

37:11.829 --> 37:16.152
And he is now the health and human services secretary of the United States.

37:16.753 --> 37:21.316
And he's on Dr. Phil primetime because we are being ruled by podcast.

37:22.177 --> 37:32.684
He's on Dr. Phil to make sure that only one part of America sees this because that's how we are being governed.

37:34.571 --> 37:37.033
to censor me and other people.

37:37.794 --> 37:40.396
But I was the first one censored.

37:40.557 --> 37:42.598
And we now have the emails between him.

37:42.679 --> 37:44.180
And what did they censor you about?

37:44.220 --> 37:52.307
Wouldn't this be the perfect time to say that the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise because intramuscular injection of a combination of substances would be retarded?

37:53.388 --> 37:55.090
But of course he's not gonna say that.

37:56.151 --> 37:59.915
Because he's a national security actor on a script that he doesn't even understand.

38:00.776 --> 38:06.961
because Gavin DeBecker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and all the others have been lying to him for years.

38:09.944 --> 38:12.546
Between this group and Mark Zuckerberg.

38:13.367 --> 38:17.190
If anybody's smooth-brained, it's a heroin addict over here.

38:19.092 --> 38:27.039
And other people at Twitter, et cetera, which Elon made public, and thank God for him.

38:29.632 --> 38:33.473
So thank God for Elon Musk and thank God for Donald Trump.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.254
That's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:35.274 --> 38:36.354
in 2025.

38:39.996 --> 38:40.416
Oops.

38:44.978 --> 38:46.438
See, that's what live casting is.

38:46.498 --> 38:52.781
If you leave the music on in the background, but you just turn it down, then when you turn the volume back up, the music is still playing.

38:54.226 --> 38:57.629
That's how you can tell that this isn't AI or some other bullshit.

38:57.829 --> 38:58.610
It's real.

38:59.230 --> 39:03.674
Because it is just a biologist in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

39:04.114 --> 39:08.898
And if anybody would like to take a vacation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and sit on the couch live,

39:09.679 --> 39:10.840
That's right, live.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.781
You could sit on the couch right over there.

39:13.741 --> 39:14.462
You see that couch?

39:14.482 --> 39:15.922
You could sit on that couch right there.

39:15.962 --> 39:20.865
We could even make a fire outside of that door and we could sit around the fire and we could do the same show.

39:21.805 --> 39:23.266
But you could be in the live audience.

39:23.306 --> 39:25.027
If you ever want to do that, just let me know.

39:26.288 --> 39:32.191
Let Fearla know and we'll make some arrangements and you can be in the live studio audience of GigaOM Biological.

39:37.137 --> 39:45.263
I don't think you'd have free speech in this country if it wasn't for Elon Musk because he opened up Twitter and he allowed people to see what was actually happening.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.565
You see, that's a national security script.

39:47.585 --> 39:57.133
There's no way in hell that anybody actually believes that Elon Musk is a significant figure, a profound thinker, a wise old man.

39:57.313 --> 39:59.094
That guy is a buffoon.

39:59.434 --> 40:04.018
That guy is a below average monkey who's fat.

40:05.731 --> 40:14.473
And he's been propped up by the National Security State to make us believe that he's capable of running like seven different companies that do like seven different engineering things.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.653
Because he's smart.

40:18.233 --> 40:19.314
And he bought Twitter.

40:19.754 --> 40:21.874
And he saved free speech!

40:25.215 --> 40:31.936
I mean, doesn't that completely undermine him as a scholar and a thinker and a philosopher and a patriot?

40:33.424 --> 40:39.128
Doesn't that turn him into an absolute smooth-brained retard like right now?

40:40.309 --> 40:42.531
But it doesn't matter because he's on Dr. Phil.

40:42.911 --> 40:45.033
Who is the audience of Dr. Phil?

40:45.373 --> 40:48.136
Who's watching a Dr. Phil clip on X?

40:48.176 --> 40:49.557
Do you see the problem here?

40:50.357 --> 40:52.119
America is broken.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.333
And it was broken on purpose.

40:55.393 --> 40:57.014
These people are victims.

40:57.794 --> 41:00.796
They are not willing participants.

41:00.896 --> 41:20.206
They are victims of a military level operation to create the illusion of a conservative populist movement on social media and then to destroy it by discrediting it, fracturing it, breaking it into a million pieces.

41:21.929 --> 41:31.053
And the theater of Charlie Kirk is certainly a part of it, maybe even accelerated because they have lost control of this.

41:31.293 --> 41:35.514
They have lost control of their happy girl puppet show.

41:41.097 --> 41:44.078
By the way, against the advice of all of his attorneys,

41:44.591 --> 41:48.892
He turned all these documents over to a bunch of journalists and said, do what you want with them.

41:49.773 --> 41:50.613
Think about that.

41:50.653 --> 41:53.034
He turned them over to Matt Taibbi.

41:53.094 --> 41:58.096
Matt Taibbi is the guy who used to call Goldman Sachs a terrible vampire squid.

41:58.556 --> 42:09.559
But since the start of the pandemic has been totally OK with everything they're doing with lockdowns and wanted to elect some alternative group of people with Brett Weinstein and Melissa Chen.

42:09.960 --> 42:13.961
And then later on, went in front of the Congress to testify about a lab leak cover up.

42:14.361 --> 42:16.761
Holy shit, can it be any easier than this?

42:18.982 --> 42:19.862
That's unheard of.

42:23.443 --> 42:31.364
The entire planet has fallen off a cliff into the stupid zone where I don't even know what's going on anymore.

42:31.424 --> 42:32.764
This is a small planet.

42:33.444 --> 42:36.785
We have to work together and live together and we can do that.

42:37.365 --> 42:42.006
You are famous for speaking up about this, about refugees and about Palestinians.

42:42.799 --> 42:45.160
And all of these things are massively in the news at the moment.

42:45.940 --> 43:09.711
And what's not massively in the news are the six or 700,000 Americans that have been killed by an illegal opioid epidemic on the streets of America and how those numbers have contributed to a population effect that has been falsely attributed by all of these scripted actors to a novel virus or to a bioweapon slash vaccine.

43:11.883 --> 43:23.029
No one will talk about the fact that supplementary oxygen at 60 liters a minute that was widely applied across the United States would induce acute respiratory distress syndrome.

43:23.049 --> 43:27.732
You know, that set of symptoms that was associated with SARS viruses in 2002 and again in 2020.

43:32.304 --> 43:41.899
And yet Pierre Kory still can't say it and the lawyers and doctors and even Scott Shara himself can't say that that's what killed his daughter.

43:43.680 --> 44:02.490
because it was actually Scott Shara that pointed out to me that the FLCC protocol from 2020 included if your pulse ox as measured by a cheap Amazon device goes under 96%, you better go to the hospital where they'll give you supplementary oxygen.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.589
And so the truth is very simple.

44:07.769 --> 44:13.774
And Richard Gere is certainly not smart enough to know that part of the truth, the biological part of the truth.

44:14.194 --> 44:26.783
But he's certainly smart enough to know that Americans being killed by the hundreds of thousands every year is in a more acute problem in his backyard than whatever he's on this program for right now.

44:28.004 --> 44:29.845
There's been enormous change.

44:30.025 --> 44:32.807
Is there a thread that runs through these things?

44:33.052 --> 44:36.675
The bad guys exploit the illusion of differences.

44:38.136 --> 44:41.518
You really think these refugees and immigrants are different than us?

44:42.599 --> 44:52.827
Do you really believe what these clowns like Trump, Orban, Netanyahu, Putin really believe what these guys say?

44:54.448 --> 44:55.869
Or do you look at your heart and you go,

44:56.895 --> 44:58.658
It's impossible that somebody as rich and isolated

45:12.396 --> 45:18.120
and insulated from reality as Richard Gere is anything but a scripted traitor.

45:18.640 --> 45:21.803
And he's too dumb to know that he's a scripted traitor.

45:21.843 --> 45:31.649
He thinks he's doing good because every single person around him tells him he's doing good, just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:31.970 --> 45:32.910
...are dumping on us.

45:33.451 --> 45:37.594
Get rid of that, the crud, and go back to who we really are.

45:38.530 --> 45:42.851
which is really profound kindness inside of us.

45:43.552 --> 45:44.252
That's our identity.

45:45.052 --> 45:50.634
And that kindness expresses itself in responsibility, which is we're being responsible for each other.

45:51.674 --> 45:55.155
I want to save him because I know he has something that will save me.

45:55.415 --> 46:08.059
Think about that, how ridiculous it is that an American would be lecturing about saving people from other places right now, given the state of America.

46:09.198 --> 46:20.824
given what they are doing to Americans, given the number of immigrants we already have in the country that are being underserved apparently, given all the veterans that are homeless.

46:22.625 --> 46:24.366
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

46:24.507 --> 46:31.832
This is ridiculous, and it's only possible because people are skillfully using social media, and therefore watching the stuff that's put in front of them.

46:32.053 --> 46:37.137
And finally, Lucas, Richard mentioned the images of the Earth that have been taken from space.

46:37.377 --> 46:37.977
Have you seen them?

46:38.198 --> 46:38.618
I've seen them.

46:38.738 --> 46:43.382
When I see a map, it's so small, and so many people.

46:43.682 --> 46:51.989
I keep thinking, how does a human being end up destroying this resource?

46:52.805 --> 46:54.967
which many times serves for humanity.

47:13.376 --> 47:25.781
We've got to pull our heads out of social media and start to organize via snail mail, email, and our own websites, and our own servers, because this is for all the marbles.

47:25.821 --> 47:27.422
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

47:27.482 --> 47:31.124
More specifically, maybe right now, it's about the children of Earth knowing the truth.

47:31.963 --> 47:40.194
It's about us reconnecting with our children so that we are on the same page as them with regard to what we want to build as a country in the future.

47:40.735 --> 47:46.482
What trees we want to plant and where we want to plant them even though we're never going to be around to

47:47.223 --> 48:14.905
Shelter in the shade that they provide ladies and gentlemen We first must admit to our children that we were fooled by a lab leak mystery cover-up That we were fooled by a fake health freedom movement Then we've been fooled by a fake anti-vax movement by a fake populist conservative movement in America otherwise the social media airwaves wouldn't be filled with debates about Nick Fuentes and and and and Tucker Carlson or Carl Tuckerson because

48:16.124 --> 48:34.027
They would be talking about how well GigaOM Biological dissected the absurdity of Andrew Huff's presence and script that he read a few days before, because it exposes the fraud of CHD, ICANN, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:36.437 --> 48:46.379
It's impossible that at the same time people are planning a multifaceted mitochondria conference in Glasgow, Scotland, that includes mitochondrial communication.

48:46.499 --> 48:48.300
Read this paragraph.

48:48.320 --> 49:04.043
This symposium aims to reflect the variety in mitochondrial research, providing engaging and forward-looking talks on mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, their mechanisms of homeostasis and stress signaling, their functions in intra

49:05.251 --> 49:08.413
And intercellular communication.

49:08.473 --> 49:16.358
Gee, I wonder what you would call a genetic signal or a packet of RNA sent by a mitochondria that's related to bacteria.

49:16.378 --> 49:18.999
Would you call that a mitophage or something like that?

49:19.460 --> 49:20.080
Hmm.

49:20.941 --> 49:22.442
And let's see.

49:22.742 --> 49:25.884
And their role in metabolism, disease, and therapy.

49:27.040 --> 49:42.472
So again, ladies and gentlemen, of course they're going to try and slow roll you to the truth in some ways, and that the academic, the sheer raw energy of academic biology is eventually going to go in that direction, but it's still trapped.

49:44.174 --> 49:53.861
And although there are people who understand the idea of endosymbiosis, and how endosymbiosis might work, or this might be evidence of it,

49:54.793 --> 50:05.022
They are still trapped in this idea that endosymbiosis has to fit within the context of an evolution over time.

50:07.084 --> 50:10.427
And that the DNA is at the heart of that evolution over time.

50:10.467 --> 50:11.948
And that's where this all falls apart.

50:15.652 --> 50:17.835
That's where the Human Genome Project falls apart.

50:17.915 --> 50:21.400
That's where, you know, Biology 101 falls apart.

50:21.440 --> 50:32.875
And so that's why you see the world cognitively fracturing in real time, where people have too much to waste their time on, and the truth is slowly leaking out, but just...

50:33.616 --> 50:43.725
in a place and in a way that has no consequence on our collective understanding of ourselves as a... He was trying to protect the business of science.

50:44.906 --> 50:51.611
...an irreducibly complex, you know, pattern integrity with an trajectory across time.

50:52.012 --> 50:53.353
And that's what this is about.

50:53.413 --> 50:56.555
So, again, there's no way to explain how this actor

50:57.455 --> 51:07.700
who was first presented to us in this context in 2015 opposite Paul Offit and Mary Holland on Democracy Now!

51:08.821 --> 51:10.742
could be here in 2025.

51:11.222 --> 51:19.686
If he believes what he says in this short clip then he should be doing crazy shit right now to try and make this truth get out.

51:19.806 --> 51:20.427
But he's not.

51:20.827 --> 51:26.470
So you can't say that the sky has already fallen and that aliens have already landed and then go back to

51:27.110 --> 51:40.057
You know, by the way, I gotta run to Whole Foods, and then I've got this, you know, meeting, and then I've got this other stuff to do, and then I still gotta renew my subscription, and yeah, I also was gonna mow the lawn later.

51:40.937 --> 51:42.238
It just doesn't work like that.

51:42.778 --> 51:51.563
And you can't call the vaccine schedule 15 years ago, Nazi death camps, and then be the Health and Human Services Secretary worried about dying Froot Loops.

51:51.643 --> 51:52.864
That's not possible.

51:53.740 --> 51:56.903
except if it's a bullshit national security theater.

51:57.504 --> 52:04.170
And this, what he says, is not possible unless he too is a scripted national security state actor.

52:04.210 --> 52:12.879
We want to think that the scientists that work in cancer research want to cure cancer and they should win the Nobel Prize and that they're noble people and honorable people.

52:13.359 --> 52:18.322
But there's also the business of science, and it's run by billions and billions of dollars.

52:18.762 --> 52:22.804
Anthony Fauci was the head of the business of science ever since 9-11.

52:23.244 --> 52:32.129
After 9-11, we became more concerned with biological warfare, so we directed... After 9-11, we became more concerned with biological warfare.

52:32.229 --> 52:34.531
An interesting hypothesis, Rand Paul.

52:34.571 --> 52:38.073
Maybe you should talk to, I don't know, Mark Kulak in Boston.

52:38.093 --> 52:40.514
Mark Cusatonic might have something to say about that one.

52:51.852 --> 52:55.656
Billions and billions of dollars into biological warfare research.

52:56.036 --> 53:00.621
Now, if it became known... Isn't it strange that this is like a couple days old?

53:01.822 --> 53:09.870
How much more internet ass could giga ohm biological and Housatonic ITS be kicking right now?

53:09.930 --> 53:14.074
The intellectual dark web is wiping the proverbial floor

53:14.921 --> 53:20.432
with the Military-Industrial Complex show that stems from Joe Rogan to Rand Paul.

53:20.873 --> 53:22.737
It is spectacular.

53:23.338 --> 53:24.581
It's spectacular!

53:26.678 --> 53:50.115
that a virus that killed 15, 18 million people, which COVID did around the world, if it became known that he knew about it and didn't provide oversight and that there were safety lapses because this was done in an unsafe lab in China that doesn't have the same safety protocols and that he approved it, then he would have culpability and that the business of science might get less money.

53:50.195 --> 53:50.695
People might

53:51.852 --> 54:00.219
say, well, maybe we shouldn't put billions of dollars of research into creating viruses that don't exist in nature that might kill us all.

54:00.399 --> 54:09.547
If you preside over an accident that kills 18 million people, and you're an air traffic controller, and to- It's an accident that killed 18 million people on earth.

54:09.647 --> 54:12.209
But, you know, I got a lot of things on my plate.

54:15.555 --> 54:18.116
The planes run into each other and hundreds of people die.

54:18.956 --> 54:20.876
You're no longer the air traffic controller.

54:20.976 --> 54:26.838
One of the punishments is, and it doesn't mean you were made necessarily an evil person, but you made a horrific error.

54:27.298 --> 54:34.840
Fauci made the largest error in modern medicine and in public health policy probably ever of someone.

54:34.900 --> 54:36.940
And for that, he deserves the rebuke of history.

54:37.320 --> 54:45.162
But he also deserves never to be in a position, nor should his lieutenants be in a position, of managing any of our taxpayer money again because

54:48.237 --> 54:56.222
They made such a profound mistake to fund dangerous research in Wuhan without adequate safety that led to the deaths of 18 million people.

54:56.563 --> 55:01.886
We found evidence that he destroyed federal records and he directed others to destroy federal records.

55:02.206 --> 55:03.487
These are separate crimes.

55:04.008 --> 55:06.249
There is a question whether or not his pardon will cover that.

55:06.349 --> 55:09.771
We're going to see if he will voluntarily come in and testify.

55:10.092 --> 55:11.713
But if he doesn't, we will subpoena him.

55:12.093 --> 55:18.017
There are a lot of shenanigans going on, things that really you talk about Watergate or you talk about scandals.

55:18.637 --> 55:19.738
They all pale.

55:19.838 --> 55:26.944
The COVID cover-up, I wrote a whole book on this, Deception, the great COVID cover-up, because there's never been a cover-up more thoroughly.

55:27.105 --> 55:28.226
I don't know if I have that book.

55:28.306 --> 55:30.367
Rand Paul has a great COVID cover-up.

55:30.427 --> 55:31.949
I don't think I have that one either.

55:32.009 --> 55:33.130
What's going on here?

55:34.721 --> 55:36.242
This is a lot of books missing.

55:36.342 --> 55:39.384
I do have a viewer sending me Andrew Huff's book.

55:39.444 --> 55:44.066
So if you're thinking about sending me Andrew Huff's book, don't do it, please, because I don't want lots of copies of them.

55:44.647 --> 55:48.569
I already have three copies of The Invisible Rainbow, but I use those for calf raises.

55:48.629 --> 55:51.391
So that's fine, because they're all the same size.

55:51.551 --> 55:54.953
Anyway, I don't know who published his book.

55:54.993 --> 55:55.693
It's a good question.

55:55.733 --> 55:56.534
We can find that out.

55:56.554 --> 56:00.156
We documented, because we got most of their conversations.

56:03.112 --> 56:17.819
Anyway, it just keeps rolling to the insider Honored to be part of the one of the first ones I guess you're doing early on absolutely last time I tangled with you was the hundred and Seventy-fifth indeed you remember in New York City.

56:17.859 --> 56:18.719
I think we kicked it off.

56:18.799 --> 56:28.784
That's right But we're not gonna tangle this time because this time one of the things we want to do with this show Is that we want to have conversations with people who disagree with our we'll have a different world view than we do know the enemy.

56:28.804 --> 56:28.824
I

56:29.704 --> 56:30.365
Exactly.

56:30.725 --> 56:33.306
But you definitely have a very different worldview.

56:33.646 --> 56:35.487
You're a populist nationalist.

56:35.547 --> 56:40.009
So he's trying to pretend that he is an enemy of the UK because he's an American.

56:40.049 --> 56:42.350
So this is the basic schtick right here.

56:43.170 --> 56:52.774
This is the basic joke that he is a populist American patriot leading a populist conservative movement that's unstoppable with Trump at the head.

56:53.294 --> 56:57.056
When in reality, he is probably coordinating his actions

56:57.936 --> 57:16.657
with a Commonwealth-centered network of actors and agents and money that was behind Turning Point, that was behind Trump, that was behind Teal, that's behind all of this stuff, behind Musk, behind everything.

57:17.611 --> 57:24.034
And ultimately it doesn't matter, it's just that you have to see that what we're seeing here is rule by podcast.

57:24.114 --> 57:34.219
If these clowns are on a script and he's on a script, and the script that he is on is coordinated with other people, and the script that they're on is coordinated with other people,

57:34.759 --> 57:37.720
then this show is just malevolent bullshit.

57:37.820 --> 57:39.381
And that's what I'm suggesting it is.

57:39.841 --> 57:49.484
From the carpet, to the couch, to the drapes, to the freaking three pens that this fraudulent jackass puts in his shirt every day.

57:51.291 --> 57:56.555
We're classical liberals, but we really think it's important to understand your worldview better.

57:56.775 --> 58:02.939
I want to start by really getting you to paint a picture for me of what the America that you want to create is.

58:03.459 --> 58:05.401
You are now partway through the MAGA revolution.

58:05.901 --> 58:07.382
Let's assume you're successful.

58:07.822 --> 58:11.245
Just paint a picture for me of what America looks like when you're successful.

58:12.096 --> 58:18.499
in America where the little guy, the person that the system is based upon, the working class and middle class in our country.

58:18.800 --> 58:32.207
We're supposed to believe that this Harvey Weinstein associated film producer, former intellectual property expert for Goldman Sachs is now just a guy who wears three pens because he writes shit down a lot.

58:32.867 --> 58:36.349
And he wears Carhartt shirts because he's that hardcore.

58:36.789 --> 58:40.551
And he doesn't know how to comb his hair or get a haircut because he doesn't give a shit.

58:41.687 --> 58:45.229
This is one of the fakest, most fraudulent Americans alive.

58:45.910 --> 58:49.052
He deserves rotten vegetables for the rest of his life.

58:50.272 --> 58:56.316
Sharing the prosperity, we actually have returned to capitalism, because we don't have capitalism today, as much as you guys hawk it.

58:56.856 --> 58:57.797
This is corporatism.

58:58.397 --> 58:59.598
And that's an announcement.

58:59.658 --> 59:09.304
So he's just explaining to you what the reality is, and he's going to pretend that he's fighting it, when in reality, this is a Goldman Sachs, Harvey Weinstein fuckwit.

59:09.604 --> 59:10.645
Oh no, I just said it.

59:13.635 --> 59:14.736
I'm very sorry about that.

59:14.756 --> 59:18.038
I just said the F word and I did not want to say the F word anymore, but he is.

59:19.239 --> 59:19.959
He's a shithead.

59:20.139 --> 59:27.504
He is an absolutely awful, fraudulent man who is pretending to be something that he definitely is not.

59:28.004 --> 59:42.314
And this is a man who hugged Li Min Yan on stage and said into the microphone, we need to elect Li Min Yan for Senator of New York in 2020 as part of a lab leak circus theater.

59:43.885 --> 59:53.702
that included Steven Hatfill who was just fired from CMS or from ASPR yesterday because I guess there's some kind of coup against RFK Jr.

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:06.779
So we have to break that.

01:00:06.799 --> 01:00:12.521
We have to give the little guy an opportunity to thrive since the whole system rests upon him.

01:00:12.762 --> 01:00:14.002
We're at political war.

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:15.723
I say that every day.

01:00:15.923 --> 01:00:17.643
So what's the end point of a war?

01:00:17.963 --> 01:00:19.804
The end point is we are in charge.

01:00:20.164 --> 01:00:21.445
We control the institutions.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:22.985
We control the political process.

01:00:23.345 --> 01:00:33.369
We actually have reclaimed this country, turned it around, put citizens first, and created a entrepreneurial capitalism paradise

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:48.579
for average people in this country to happen to be citizens and we're not going to back off because Elon Musk is successful because of the entrepreneurial paradise and Jeff Bezos is successful because of the entrepreneurial paradise because

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:53.061
CHD is successful because of the entrepreneurial paradise.

01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:56.542
Because ICANN is successful because of the entrepreneurial paradise.

01:00:57.023 --> 01:01:00.924
We have been subjected to AI slop because of the entrepreneurial paradise.

01:01:00.964 --> 01:01:06.687
We have been censored by private social media because of the entrepreneurial paradise of America.

01:01:07.307 --> 01:01:08.728
What a crock of shit!

01:01:10.822 --> 01:01:11.763
one inch until we get it.

01:01:11.783 --> 01:01:12.323
And guess what?

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:13.164
We're winning.

01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:15.566
You use the word war a lot.

01:01:15.747 --> 01:01:29.719
If you really think there is a risk of civil war and the situation is as bad as you are saying, don't you have a responsibility as someone who sees this and who's a student of history and has seen what has happened in history to calm things down?

01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:31.120
Not to calm things down at all.

01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:35.686
Oh wow, a large pizza here in Pittsburgh is still like $14.

01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:40.693
And actually you can buy one, get one free on Wednesdays, which is today.

01:01:41.173 --> 01:01:42.235
Oh, that's not good.

01:01:42.992 --> 01:01:43.312
people.

01:01:43.993 --> 01:01:46.354
Do you think if we calm things down they're going to stop?

01:01:46.475 --> 01:01:47.896
What planet are you living on?

01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:51.578
This is my problem with this whole concept of liberal debate.

01:01:52.199 --> 01:01:57.222
We're in a revolutionary time, both technologically, geopolitically, right?

01:01:57.522 --> 01:01:58.123
Financially.

01:01:58.163 --> 01:01:58.964
You're, you're talking.

01:01:59.524 --> 01:02:02.166
See, technologically, he means social media.

01:02:02.246 --> 01:02:08.410
So all the people that are in charge have to figure out how they're going to adapt to the social media landscape.

01:02:08.731 --> 01:02:09.891
Who are they going to hire?

01:02:10.212 --> 01:02:11.813
What strategies are they going to use?

01:02:13.203 --> 01:02:14.463
That's what he's talking about.

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:18.284
Because how people know things is social media.

01:02:18.384 --> 01:02:21.085
So, you better get with the program, right?

01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:24.606
Just like PBS NewsHour says, you better get with the program.

01:02:24.626 --> 01:02:26.147
Maybe you should start a substack.

01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:28.647
Maybe you should open a locals account.

01:02:33.569 --> 01:02:35.509
Get off of social media, ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:38.510
And yes, Gigo and Biological offers an alternative.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.251
A soapbox just like Truth Social, just like Blue Sky.

01:02:44.051 --> 01:02:47.253
Our soapbox instance is exactly the same thing.

01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:51.155
And so, yeah, we offer you an alternative that can work.

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:55.757
You can use Mastodon to follow it if you don't want to use that website that we provide.

01:02:56.158 --> 01:02:58.399
And PeerTube, the app, actually works.

01:02:58.459 --> 01:03:00.480
And it's not our code, it's everybody's code.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.981
And it doesn't take your data.

01:03:03.101 --> 01:03:07.924
And it doesn't serve you crap you don't want to see, like all social media does.

01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:10.645
Get off it, ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:10.685 --> 01:03:11.706
Get your kids off it.

01:03:12.008 --> 01:03:16.872
This magazine, you tell me, we're heading to financial Armageddon.

01:03:17.432 --> 01:03:19.193
There's no other way you can read this.

01:03:19.434 --> 01:03:29.981
If you don't warn people about it and say, we must go to the ramparts, because if you're just passive and docile and just flick the channel and watch the National Football League.

01:03:30.282 --> 01:03:31.062
He's acting.

01:03:31.883 --> 01:03:35.706
This smoke and huff and puff, it's acting.

01:03:36.485 --> 01:03:39.014
He's just telling you out loud, we're bankrupt.

01:03:39.134 --> 01:03:42.726
America is bankrupt and we are bankrupting it.

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:46.802
And we are taking advantage of the bankruptcy.

01:03:46.842 --> 01:03:53.024
We are using it to our advantage to strip the entire wealth of America clean.

01:03:53.064 --> 01:03:55.785
And he knows it because he comes from Goldman Sachs.

01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:59.406
Aaron Seary knows it because he comes from Goldman Sachs.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:06.288
And for that matter, he clerked for the Supreme Court Chief Justice of Israel.

01:04:07.129 --> 01:04:08.489
Yes, Aaron Seary did.

01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:13.751
That's how he started his career because I guess you can just apply for that on Indeed and get hired.

01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:23.159
and go to Taylor Swift concerts, it's over.

01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:25.760
You need to rally people to say no.

01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:36.167
We must go to the ramparts because if you're just passive and docile and just flick the channel and watch the National Football League and go to Taylor Swift concerts.

01:04:36.367 --> 01:04:40.670
See, Taylor Swift concerts and the National Football League are not the dangers.

01:04:42.176 --> 01:04:57.649
I think you'd be better off going to a Taylor Swift concert, or going to a National Football League game, or organizing a neighborhood watching of a local football game, than you would being on social media trying to do whatever he's encouraging you to do.

01:04:57.729 --> 01:04:58.890
Go to the Ramparts!

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:00.591
Stop lying!

01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:03.774
Stop lying!

01:05:04.374 --> 01:05:05.275
He's full of shit.

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:08.360
He's an awful man.

01:05:09.881 --> 01:05:11.361
Concerts, it's over.

01:05:11.882 --> 01:05:13.943
You need to rally people to say no.

01:05:14.323 --> 01:05:24.189
You represent from time immemorial, from every patriot's grave back to the beginning, the basic working man and woman that has always saved this country in moments of crisis.

01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:28.451
Okay, obviously Taylor Swift is not who I would say you should go to.

01:05:28.551 --> 01:05:30.371
I think live music, though, is a good idea.

01:05:30.471 --> 01:05:33.312
And the smaller the band and the smaller the venue, the better.

01:05:33.393 --> 01:05:35.333
Preferably a venue that allows you to smoke.

01:05:35.353 --> 01:05:35.793
How's that?

01:05:36.274 --> 01:05:39.615
Revolution in the Civil War, in the Great Depression, World War II.

01:05:40.095 --> 01:05:41.937
It's always come back to the little guy.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:43.899
This is the fourth turning.

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:46.582
The strength of the populist nationalist MAGA movement.

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:51.506
There were people from the very beginning in 2020 talking about the fourth turning.

01:05:51.646 --> 01:05:57.032
In fact, on the burning platform where I was first connected to Mark Maron,

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.200
They were talking about the fourth turning constantly.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:04.361
I think it was actually at the top of the website's heading.

01:06:04.401 --> 01:06:07.301
And they were always talking about the authors of that book.

01:06:07.822 --> 01:06:15.583
So it's not by accident that this guy is also pushing that idea because they do want to make societal changes.

01:06:15.643 --> 01:06:18.563
They do want to create societal momentum.

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:24.905
And then they're going to use social media to make believe that society has decided to do a certain number of dumb things.

01:06:24.945 --> 01:06:27.285
And then that's what we're going to say we're doing.

01:06:29.343 --> 01:06:31.684
It's all too easy now, ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:31.724 --> 01:06:34.685
All we gotta do is get off of social media and this becomes impossible.

01:06:36.306 --> 01:06:41.168
And then it turns into the, you know, Star Trek series that it actually is.

01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:43.949
It turns into the A-Team, which is what it actually is.

01:06:44.009 --> 01:06:49.051
It turns into, you know, Law & Order, stupid, you know, dum-dum-dum.

01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:54.883
in this country is we're anti-fragile.

01:06:55.163 --> 01:06:55.964
We're resilient.

01:06:56.024 --> 01:06:57.485
You can give us your best shot.

01:06:57.845 --> 01:06:58.986
You can put us in prison.

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:00.547
You can take our credit cards away.

01:07:00.567 --> 01:07:01.308
You can debank us.

01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:02.269
You can de-platform us.

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.730
You can have all the tech stuff that happened.

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:06.092
We can't be beaten if we don't quit.

01:07:06.472 --> 01:07:14.878
And if that takes hot rhetoric, you ain't seen nothing yet, because we're now getting into the middle of this fight, and we're never going to kowtow to these people.

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:15.599
We're never going to

01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:17.820
He's like pointing to these people.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.441
It's just ridiculous.

01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:21.182
It's so absurd.

01:07:21.722 --> 01:07:23.543
We must wake up, people.

01:07:24.363 --> 01:07:27.185
Americans must wake up from this enchantment.

01:07:27.245 --> 01:07:35.169
This is absurdity upon absurdity spread too thin over way too much bullshit wafer here.

01:07:35.999 --> 01:07:36.439
Wow.

01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:37.600
Get on our knees to these people.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.741
We're never going to apologize.

01:07:38.761 --> 01:07:39.762
We're never going to say we're sorry.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:43.325
All we care about is victory begets victory begets victory.

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.907
And we know that we're ascended and they're in decline.

01:07:46.087 --> 01:07:54.734
So Steve, when you look at history and you map the lessons of history onto the situation today, the crisis we're in today,

01:07:55.822 --> 01:08:00.827
Is it your belief that the only way through this crisis is through some sort of conflagration?

01:08:00.847 --> 01:08:17.345
I want you to think about the fact that my son goes to a high school called Bethel Park High School where Matthew Crooks went to high school, the guy who decided to climb up on a roof in Butler, Pennsylvania and try to shoot Donald Trump according to the narrative and just barely missed, hit his ear.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:37.053
The school never did anything to find out what social media Matthew Crooks was on, never did anything to find out what social media Matthew Crooks might have used in order to think about or get the idea or even plan his trip to Butler, Pennsylvania to shoot from a roof.

01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:51.553
There's no consensus at the school that, you know, discord is dangerous or, you know, uh, Snapchat might be bad or they don't even have any thing to discuss it with the kids.

01:08:51.593 --> 01:08:58.415
You know, at the beginning of the year, let's remind everybody the history of this school and what happened and how we don't want to have that happen anymore.

01:08:59.436 --> 01:09:03.557
They just completely pretend that it never occurred.

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:06.863
And that happened.

01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:10.185
The guy's house is four blocks from my house.

01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:11.566
It's on my dog walk.

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:13.947
And nobody knows.

01:09:14.547 --> 01:09:20.191
The entire community just doesn't know who this family is or where they went or what happened to his kids or whatever.

01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:21.012
Nobody cares.

01:09:21.092 --> 01:09:21.892
It's just gone.

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:24.374
That can't be real.

01:09:26.575 --> 01:09:28.556
That can't possibly be real.

01:09:31.378 --> 01:09:31.838
But it is.

01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:34.260
It's real life in America.

01:09:35.253 --> 01:09:42.938
Real life in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, real life is what it is, that these people just seem to not see it.

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:50.543
This ally of Donald Trump doesn't care that we don't know why that teenager went on the roof.

01:09:52.344 --> 01:09:59.268
Doesn't care about the teenage daughter on Alex Jones of Sasha Latupova behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:09:59.548 --> 01:10:02.030
Doesn't care because he's part of that show.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:12.084
It is very dark times in American history right now, but you wouldn't know it if you skillfully watch social media.

01:10:12.104 --> 01:10:13.066
It's just very exciting.

01:10:15.108 --> 01:10:18.053
And if so, do you think your role is to.

01:10:18.894 --> 01:10:24.419
accelerate that to bring it out so that it happens fast and you come out on the other side better and faster?

01:10:24.859 --> 01:10:27.561
Or is it to stop the crisis?

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:36.449
Is it a belief that actually, you know what, we can work to stop the crisis and actually change is better brought about through evolution rather than revolution?

01:10:36.469 --> 01:10:37.449
This is what's not evolution.

01:10:37.690 --> 01:10:39.731
I think that to avoid

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:46.243
actual civil conflict, which I think you're seeing right now, the beginning of the harbinger of it.

01:10:46.803 --> 01:10:50.566
If you want to stop that, you have to bind together tighter.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:57.851
We, as a populist nationalist movement, as a MAGA movement, we need to do like the... Every time they say it, it's just an enchantment.

01:10:57.911 --> 01:11:00.473
It makes it real by saying it's real.

01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:06.217
Just like Scott Shara came all the way from Wisconsin to Pittsburgh

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:11.698
to say on my live stream that Satan was real and Satan was controlling everybody.

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:28.182
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but it's really dark times in America and almost everybody that is anything on social media is bought and controlled, scripted and sold out.

01:11:29.323 --> 01:11:29.783
It's done.

01:11:31.063 --> 01:11:34.144
And so the way forward is out.

01:11:35.413 --> 01:11:40.601
Otherwise you are subjecting yourself to governance by podcast.

01:11:40.621 --> 01:11:41.943
There is no truth there.

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:42.885
None at all.

01:11:45.094 --> 01:11:55.643
redistricting fights, we need to get, this is why I was down in Texas, we need to get the House in a situation that is permanently defendable by the MAGA movement, right?

01:11:55.963 --> 01:11:57.625
So it's a blocking mechanism.

01:11:57.705 --> 01:12:04.731
And take that, like I said, you move a maximalist strategy with a sense of urgency, and you seize the institutions.

01:12:05.151 --> 01:12:06.292
And that's what we're doing right now.

01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:10.434
I don't see how that is a recipe for diffusing this crisis.

01:12:11.074 --> 01:12:22.538
I think that what happens is when people feel shut out of power and interest groups cannot get representation and cannot get an input into the way that policy is made, that's precisely when you end up with civil war.

01:12:22.618 --> 01:12:24.658
I disagree.

01:12:24.699 --> 01:12:35.762
I think the mechanism will be that people in the Democratic Party will adjust and change, say, hey, we actually have to start winning elections and we have to have a message that can resonate with many Americans

01:12:36.002 --> 01:12:45.607
Oh, so now the Democratic Party will change, too, and become good again, and that's how America will rise.

01:12:49.029 --> 01:12:55.873
That we can start getting back control of the House of Representatives, we can take the Senate, and most importantly, we take the presidency.

01:12:55.953 --> 01:13:04.018
I think that you'll force the Civil War to be inside of those guys, and they'll say, these radicals are saying violence, and we have to seize the institutions.

01:13:04.438 --> 01:13:05.839
seize them, and then purge them.

01:13:06.139 --> 01:13:08.960
We seize the institution, purge them, and that's what you've got, guys.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.641
It's not the Doge crap.

01:13:10.681 --> 01:13:15.544
This is serious people like Russ Vought and others that have spent years thinking this whole plan through.

01:13:15.904 --> 01:13:17.505
We must strike, and we must strike now.

01:13:17.825 --> 01:13:20.566
I know all the haters hate it, but this is the age of Trump.

01:13:20.886 --> 01:13:25.208
He's totally redefined politics and power in America, and how'd he do that?

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:30.191
With no political training, because he was- He did it with social media's help.

01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:32.494
He did it with a fake shooting.

01:13:32.934 --> 01:13:35.518
He did it with social media's help.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.963
He did it with weaponized piles of money.

01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:42.388
He did it with coordinated actors on scripts.

01:13:45.322 --> 01:13:55.165
a populist and he was a nationalist at the very moment that if you didn't have populist nationalism stopped the managed decline of the country by the elites of the nation.

01:13:55.325 --> 01:13:58.005
And does he need a third term in order to see that job through?

01:13:58.105 --> 01:14:04.867
Isn't Trudeau actually dating Katy Perry now, the former wife of Russell Brand?

01:14:04.927 --> 01:14:06.328
I mean, that's magical.

01:14:08.348 --> 01:14:09.529
Well, he's going to get a third term.

01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:11.869
So Trump 28, Trump is going to be president of 28.

01:14:12.669 --> 01:14:14.670
And people just ought to get accommodated with that.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.204
So what about the 22nd Amendment?

01:14:17.664 --> 01:14:19.045
There's many different alternatives.

01:14:19.345 --> 01:14:21.506
At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.

01:14:21.526 --> 01:14:23.427
But there's a plan, and President Trump will be.

01:14:23.767 --> 01:14:32.571
And of course, this is supposed to make everybody squirm in their seats and pull their hair out and all this other stuff because we're supposed to get real mad because there's no way you can do that, dude.

01:14:32.611 --> 01:14:33.531
There's no way.

01:14:34.752 --> 01:14:35.492
Give me a break.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.393
This is just Trump derangement syndrome.

01:14:37.413 --> 01:14:41.315
He's going to go on The View and say this, too, probably, and get The View ladies all worked up.

01:14:41.415 --> 01:14:41.975
The president in 28.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:47.429
We had longer odds in 16 and longer odds in 24 than we got in 28.

01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:50.110
That's just so dumb, but this is dumber.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:55.332
Has he upheld all the commitments he made to Bobby when he joined his ticket?

01:14:55.812 --> 01:14:56.352
He has.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.293
That was another thing too, right?

01:14:59.353 --> 01:15:09.036
When Bobby joined his ticket, I got another round of phone calls from people saying, you know, he's going to make Bobby look

01:15:09.349 --> 01:15:09.749
foolish.

01:15:09.809 --> 01:15:11.210
He's never going to go through with this.

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:13.051
He just wants Bobby's supporters.

01:15:14.952 --> 01:15:25.877
But those people never called me back to say, oh, hey, he actually is working for the president, and they're getting a lot of stuff done, just like he said.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:30.560
Magnificent, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.141
Magnificent.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.363
I don't really know what to say other than it's been a long, strange trip.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.264
And I think I need some lunch.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:45.285
Don't let this song get you down.

01:15:45.345 --> 01:15:46.426
It doesn't get me down.

01:15:46.886 --> 01:15:51.627
But I am thinking of this guy when I play it.

01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:54.688
I miss him very much.

01:15:55.728 --> 01:16:00.710
I couldn't save him because these people had me chasing a lab leak instead of telling Nate the truth.

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:05.011
And it was two years ago this week that he came to my house.

01:16:06.175 --> 01:16:11.437
We hung out for the last time and he laughed at me because he asked me, what is your plan?

01:16:11.477 --> 01:16:13.018
Are you just going to keep going like this?

01:16:13.098 --> 01:16:13.858
COVID's over.

01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:17.540
Do you really think that this is real?

01:16:19.481 --> 01:16:24.323
And I stood there and I looked him in his eyes and I said, I still think you could die from the shot, dude.

01:16:24.503 --> 01:16:25.684
You could die tomorrow.

01:16:26.724 --> 01:16:29.845
Well, he died about a month and a half later of an acute aneurysm.

01:16:32.407 --> 01:16:33.227
It doesn't feel good.

01:16:35.219 --> 01:16:36.905
But it is real.

01:16:37.929 --> 01:16:39.294
So I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16:40.017 --> 01:16:41.642
I don't know what to tell you other than I ain't quitting.

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:14.773
Only for a moment, and the moment's gone.

01:17:14.793 --> 01:17:25.196
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity.

01:17:27.217 --> 01:17:29.957
Dust in the wind.

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:34.699
All they are is dust in the wind.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:18:05.538
Just a drop of water in an endless sea All we do Crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see Dust in the wind All we are is dust in the wind

01:19:01.298 --> 01:19:05.120
Nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.462
It slips away.

01:19:11.423 --> 01:19:15.084
And all your money won't another minute buy.

01:19:15.104 --> 01:19:18.746
Dust in the wind.

01:19:21.986 --> 01:19:25.630
All we are is dust in the wind.

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:27.331
Dust in the wind.

01:19:27.431 --> 01:19:32.316
Everything is dust in the wind.

01:19:32.336 --> 01:19:36.760
Everything is dust in the wind.

01:19:39.602 --> 01:19:41.504
The wind.
