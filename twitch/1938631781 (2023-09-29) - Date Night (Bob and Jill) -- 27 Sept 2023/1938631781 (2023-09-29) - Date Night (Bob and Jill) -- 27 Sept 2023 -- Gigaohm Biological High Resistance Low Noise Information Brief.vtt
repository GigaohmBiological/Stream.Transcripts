01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I

01:38.160 --> 01:43.940
Used to on extreme was excellent today definitely was was excellent

01:43.940 --> 01:45.940
You

01:58.540 --> 02:04.440
You're very sweet to call these lectures we haven't been lecturing in a while we are just we're studying

02:06.980 --> 02:12.300
We are studying together ladies and gentlemen trying to figure out what happened what's happening

02:14.900 --> 02:16.900
We have

02:16.900 --> 02:18.900
Stop lecturing a while ago

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
Not that we won't again, but

02:24.180 --> 02:30.900
We did stop a while ago because you know we we there's a lot of a lot of introspection and

02:31.700 --> 02:33.700
retrospective and

02:33.700 --> 02:35.700
archiving and

02:36.420 --> 02:38.420
You know

02:39.020 --> 02:41.980
Hindsight is 20 26 Jones next

02:42.700 --> 02:45.780
It's going on French British Italian

02:46.700 --> 02:48.700
Sometimes the way forward is

02:48.820 --> 02:51.660
People everywhere are making sure you remember where you've been

02:52.300 --> 02:54.300
It's embarrassing

03:00.980 --> 03:07.660
What better way for a swimmer to disappear uncle Stewart, why did you do it well?

03:07.660 --> 03:12.740
I guess he can explain it to the sheriff when he gets here. I bet you kids are starving

03:13.580 --> 03:15.580
So it's that's for me

03:18.940 --> 03:25.060
What's this Scooby boos was here the whole turkey

03:37.660 --> 03:39.660
You

03:39.660 --> 03:41.660
You

03:41.660 --> 03:43.660
You

03:43.660 --> 04:11.540
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga home biological high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by biologists

04:13.660 --> 04:15.660
September 29th

04:23.580 --> 04:30.420
And we're going to take another look at how this limited spectrum of debate has been carefully crafted

04:30.420 --> 04:32.420
By the people

05:00.420 --> 05:12.740
Yes, so very excited very very excited to get my voice a little bit of a break tonight

05:30.420 --> 05:38.700
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is Giga home biological high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by biologists

05:38.700 --> 05:41.820
My name is Jonathan Cooley. I'm broadcasting from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

05:41.820 --> 05:44.660
It is the 29th of September

05:45.780 --> 05:52.300
2023 and it is date night with Robert and Jill Mark and Cheryl

05:54.300 --> 05:58.940
I don't want you to take the debate on TV and social media, please don't

06:00.980 --> 06:05.540
And make sure that you're constantly aware of the ease with which

06:06.540 --> 06:10.220
fooling around on social media can inadvertently

06:12.780 --> 06:15.060
Result in you taking the bait. I apologize

06:15.660 --> 06:21.260
It is already late here in Pittsburgh and it was it's still Friday. This was a work day

06:22.220 --> 06:26.500
We're still trying to take down this Scooby-Doo this idea that we've been fooled into food to

06:26.940 --> 06:28.300
Bob

06:28.300 --> 06:33.700
Figuring out what this mystery is who did it who done it who's responsible

06:34.780 --> 06:37.620
And I think that pivoting around on this

06:38.220 --> 06:42.700
This idea. I think it's really fun sometimes to consider

06:43.620 --> 06:49.140
The concept that you know, let me see if I can adjust this. I don't know if this is on already or not

06:49.860 --> 06:51.860
I think it is

06:51.940 --> 06:58.620
It's it's interesting to adjust this concept in your head and to understand that a sort of chaotic

07:00.540 --> 07:06.180
2020 was brought together into a sort of divided but relatively organized

07:07.020 --> 07:08.620
debate a

07:08.620 --> 07:13.500
Divided debate where people were like oh my goodness. What a crazy idea that this virus came from a laboratory

07:13.500 --> 07:16.060
And then on the other side

07:16.940 --> 07:20.140
Almost a mirror image of people who were like crazy idea

07:21.140 --> 07:23.140
It's the only thing that makes sense

07:24.140 --> 07:30.020
And it's it was such a weird parallel between the way that the people who watch Fox News

07:30.340 --> 07:36.660
Think about the people who watch CNN and the people who watch CNN think about the people who watch Fox News and

07:38.100 --> 07:40.660
The to think that the people within this

07:42.740 --> 07:44.740
Obvious cognitive trap

07:45.380 --> 07:53.820
We're completely wholly aware of the ridiculous nature of their their circumstances and still we were stuck in it all of us

07:54.460 --> 08:01.300
And it's especially evident when somebody points out people who can't think straight when trial Trump is in the conversation

08:01.740 --> 08:07.620
But it actually also happens with lab leak and with vaccines and with climate change

08:08.300 --> 08:10.980
with abortion with gay marriage with

08:11.980 --> 08:14.780
Transsexual and transgenderism whatever you call that stuff

08:15.820 --> 08:17.340
There's this

08:17.340 --> 08:19.340
You guys don't get it

08:19.340 --> 08:25.620
You guys don't get it kind of attitude that is really spectacular in the way that it is completely severed

08:26.060 --> 08:27.460
the way

08:27.460 --> 08:28.740
that we

08:28.740 --> 08:34.940
Think of ourselves as a nation and the way that we interact with one another as fellow citizens. It is extraordinary

08:35.500 --> 08:39.500
I don't think ever before in the history of America hasn't been so clear

08:40.220 --> 08:45.300
clearly divided in a way that you almost can't shake hands with certain people and

08:45.660 --> 08:51.500
That's really it is quite frightening if we think about it, but I actually think that the lies

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
And it is the lies

08:54.500 --> 08:59.540
And I think we might even find out that the lies go way beyond the lies about immunology

09:00.420 --> 09:04.620
If it was only that they lied about the causes of respiratory disease

09:04.620 --> 09:07.060
It was only that they lied about all cause mortality

09:07.860 --> 09:14.820
It's only that they were just lying about our immune response to a disease or they were just lying about vaccination

09:16.180 --> 09:20.700
But think about all the other things that you know that they're lying about

09:25.140 --> 09:31.780
And think about all the things that they're able to do for all the lives that they tell when just for these four lies

09:32.300 --> 09:34.460
Behind me. They were able to do all of this

09:35.260 --> 09:37.260
For three years straight

09:38.340 --> 09:40.340
Completely fooling a planet

09:42.140 --> 09:46.580
And what this should wake you up to is the possibility the potential

09:47.340 --> 09:51.300
For governance around the world by what is essentially lies

09:53.060 --> 09:58.780
Why let things happen and then have to put out fires when you can start fires and put them out

09:58.780 --> 10:08.820
Or when you can claim that there's fires and you have the solution for never having fires again

10:10.780 --> 10:19.420
You see this is the kind of governance idea the structure the the concept of fifth generation warfare

10:20.180 --> 10:22.180
It's a bad it's a bad name

10:23.180 --> 10:30.460
Fifth generation governance is what it ought to be called and that's what's happening here. It's fifth generation governance

10:30.460 --> 10:32.860
They are fracturing their citizenry

10:33.900 --> 10:37.700
cognitively into groups which by definition

10:38.420 --> 10:43.740
Can't reconcile their differences because they're asking the wrong questions as Mark

10:44.820 --> 10:47.100
Coolack said so nicely earlier today

10:47.940 --> 10:53.980
We have been tricked into asking the wrong questions. We've been tricked into solving the wrong mystery and

10:55.820 --> 11:02.020
In so doing we accept all the premises of said mystery all the premises of said question

11:04.940 --> 11:12.700
And that was what keeping this debate about gain of function or whether it could be accessed in cell culture and animal passage or whether you could stitch

11:13.100 --> 11:16.140
viruses together or not that whole debate

11:17.740 --> 11:23.980
If you accept the premise of that debate, then you accept that there might be a reason why you need to give up your sovereignty

11:25.140 --> 11:27.140
for permissions

11:27.460 --> 11:29.460
There might be a really good reason

11:30.300 --> 11:33.900
if you accept the premise of this mythology and

11:35.700 --> 11:43.300
That's again what the sculpting of this debate was to make you know Sam Harris make you feel dumb for thinking that there might be a gray area there

11:43.460 --> 11:51.020
For Jordan Peterson for making you think it might be dumb that there would be a gray area in terms of taking an RNA shot for this

11:52.620 --> 11:57.680
That all of these people on this screen more or less made it a gray area as to whether you should do

11:58.380 --> 12:00.380
anything but listen to the government

12:00.740 --> 12:02.740
It would be ridiculous not to

12:04.540 --> 12:07.420
What did Jordan Peterson say fear as I might

12:09.220 --> 12:12.260
For our loss of rights and liberties and what this means

12:13.300 --> 12:15.300
you

12:15.660 --> 12:17.180
Don't have

12:17.180 --> 12:20.100
Principles in an emergency, then you don't have principles

12:20.580 --> 12:25.540
Said Alexandra's marinose friend of Brett Weinstein on the Brett Weinstein podcast

12:27.060 --> 12:31.140
If you don't have principles during an emergency, you don't have principles

12:32.340 --> 12:33.100
and

12:33.100 --> 12:36.360
What our governments around the world have shown in unison

12:37.320 --> 12:44.800
In perfect synchrony is that we don't have principles during in a declared emergency like one like this

12:46.880 --> 12:52.760
And now you can see who has principles by who's willing to tell this story from beginning to end

12:52.760 --> 12:56.960
Who's willing to start from the beginning and start at the beginning all the time?

12:58.680 --> 13:04.600
Anybody who doesn't start at the beginning all the time in my humble opinion is not playing your straight

13:07.360 --> 13:08.640
a

13:08.640 --> 13:14.680
Very good example might be the fact that the United States government sent your son over to Iraq

13:14.680 --> 13:20.840
And your son was over and served in Iraq for ten years and over those ten years. He was injured

13:21.280 --> 13:23.280
He got cancer

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
He's mentally ill

13:26.240 --> 13:28.240
He hits his wife

13:28.680 --> 13:30.600
and

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
He shop-lifted

13:33.000 --> 13:35.560
And so the government comes to your house

13:36.360 --> 13:40.160
And says, you know, your son is a pretty big problem because you know

13:40.640 --> 13:45.080
You don't seem to you don't seem to understand that he's shoplifting and all this other stuff

13:47.040 --> 13:50.200
As if that's you know the whole story

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
If that's really what's going on here

13:54.280 --> 13:56.640
Not the denial of his VA benefits

13:58.440 --> 14:03.520
And so if somebody comes to you and says man, I can't believe how we're here and you know this

14:04.000 --> 14:07.280
This whole thing is just nuts. The shot is just terrible

14:07.920 --> 14:10.640
The shot is killing all these people. I get it

14:11.320 --> 14:13.800
Don't you get me wrong? I get it

14:14.560 --> 14:20.760
But don't let people focus you on all these people that are being hurt by the mRNA shot

14:23.080 --> 14:27.240
And let you forget that for two years

14:29.160 --> 14:32.320
Ladies and gentlemen and certainly for a year and a half

14:33.520 --> 14:36.000
This was wholly a fraud

14:37.360 --> 14:44.800
About shifting money shifting power and worse than all misleading the young

14:47.120 --> 14:52.640
Misleading young people about the existence of and the appropriate response to

14:54.160 --> 14:57.800
RNA viruses RNA molecules in nature

14:58.800 --> 15:05.320
Think about how ridiculous it sounds if you just substitute the word from virus to molecules

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320
Which is really not that big of a substitution

15:09.080 --> 15:11.080
Virus has a few more proteins

15:11.960 --> 15:14.840
So just call it that then protein coated RNA

15:17.680 --> 15:23.640
You are misleading the young about the appropriate response for detected

15:24.640 --> 15:29.200
Protein coated RNA at best. That's the best you've got

15:30.040 --> 15:33.680
Here when you describe what these despicable people have done and

15:34.400 --> 15:40.680
In order to describe the depth and the breadth of the despicable nature of their actions. You must not forget any of this and

15:41.880 --> 15:45.320
Everybody who's leading us back down into the cave

15:47.440 --> 15:51.440
Tricking us into following them back down into the cold dark cave

15:52.400 --> 15:54.480
Those people aren't talking about this stuff

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
And it's mostly these people

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
Definitely all the people at the bottom

16:01.280 --> 16:04.880
But a lot of the people up here all along this red triangle

16:06.160 --> 16:09.840
Because none of them are questioning the protocols the spread or the variants

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
And that's really the trick

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
If you accept this model of

16:17.280 --> 16:20.960
Of worldwide virology, you know, like Monday night football

16:21.680 --> 16:23.680
Then then no

16:23.920 --> 16:25.920
You can't escape

16:26.080 --> 16:31.680
The whole justification for this unified governance in the world in the next years

16:32.240 --> 16:37.760
Is going to be largely climate change and the worldwide virology web

16:37.760 --> 16:39.760
And

16:44.960 --> 16:48.880
So i've been trying to find ways to say this succinctly to people. I think

16:49.120 --> 16:52.560
Transfection is not immunization works great if you know what those words mean

16:54.640 --> 16:56.160
But if you don't

16:56.160 --> 17:03.120
It might be easier to say intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

17:03.120 --> 17:05.120
Um

17:06.720 --> 17:08.720
Silly misguided

17:09.760 --> 17:11.760
You know choose your word there

17:12.320 --> 17:17.200
Misguided doesn't really fit at that font size and I want to change it all so, you know, whatever

17:17.840 --> 17:21.600
If you're offended with my word choice, I apologize sometimes it needs to be blunt

17:22.240 --> 17:26.480
We've been trying to figure out how these pieces fit together how these people fit together

17:27.360 --> 17:29.360
Why it is that certain people

17:29.840 --> 17:33.360
seem to amplify certain other people but ignore other people

17:34.880 --> 17:36.880
And uh, yeah

17:37.440 --> 17:40.800
A lot of the the the the people that have risen

17:42.240 --> 17:43.680
Um

17:43.680 --> 17:45.680
You know as the pot has boiled

17:46.160 --> 17:48.320
The stuff that has risen to the top. Um

17:49.200 --> 17:51.200
It seems to be that the

17:51.760 --> 17:53.760
the first

17:54.080 --> 17:56.080
What is it?

17:56.080 --> 18:02.240
The first gnocchi that rises up from the from the boiling pot are these four guys every time we

18:02.880 --> 18:05.120
Start to make dinner and think about okay, let's

18:06.080 --> 18:12.320
Who was crafting and and guiding this narrative in 2020 and 2021?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.920
It's just a really weird mix of people

18:16.720 --> 18:19.520
That all end up talking to and about each other

18:20.320 --> 18:22.480
Throughout the pandemic as they each

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
Have entered the scene

18:25.920 --> 18:29.520
And so I find it very extraordinary to follow these tracks and

18:30.400 --> 18:32.480
one of my favorites, of course is

18:45.040 --> 18:51.600
So I found a video called wine country conversations and it's an archived video from them. I believe

18:52.000 --> 18:53.760
In

18:53.760 --> 18:55.760
2023

18:56.560 --> 19:01.360
I've had a hard time verifying it could be 22, but it's may

19:02.480 --> 19:05.360
2023 on bitchoo as far as I can tell

19:06.640 --> 19:09.200
And we'll just listen in because again, I haven't heard it

19:10.320 --> 19:14.720
But the reason why I chose it and the reason why I saved it on my list was because it's Jill and

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
Robert

19:17.600 --> 19:21.280
Unstage and I really like to watch them and listen to them together because

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
It's impossible to miss

19:25.600 --> 19:32.000
The intellectual link between them and I'm not talking about, you know, the twinkle in their eye or that they've been in love since they were in high school or

19:32.720 --> 19:34.240
They're in they

19:34.240 --> 19:38.160
They're shared thought of their horses at home. I'm talking about

19:39.120 --> 19:41.120
This idea of how

19:41.760 --> 19:43.520
Focused

19:43.520 --> 19:45.440
They are

19:45.440 --> 19:47.440
When they go into public

19:48.800 --> 19:50.800
As

19:51.040 --> 19:53.040
Public speakers

19:53.600 --> 19:55.520
Call them performers call them

19:56.480 --> 19:57.840
Call them

19:57.840 --> 20:03.840
Orators, I I don't know what they are if you as a married couple if you just think about it

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
If I think about myself and fearless

20:07.040 --> 20:12.560
Going on stage to talk together or or be present together

20:12.560 --> 20:16.640
Even if I was going to go teach immunology and she was going to sit up there on stage

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
What kind of

20:23.600 --> 20:26.000
Thing does that say about what's going on there?

20:26.000 --> 20:31.120
What kind of message are you sending? And I think it's a very interesting one because again

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
most of the time

20:34.800 --> 20:40.240
We think of Robert Malone. We see Robert Malone as sort of self touring ball by himself guy

20:40.320 --> 20:42.480
but in reality, it's him and Jill

20:43.760 --> 20:44.880
and

20:44.880 --> 20:50.400
Jill and Robert write a lot of the sub-stacks together along with their staff of 40 or 50

20:52.160 --> 20:56.560
English major soldiers or whatever it is that produces all of those articles

20:57.360 --> 21:01.920
I guess they're writing while the soldiers are working in the barn and feeding the emus

21:02.480 --> 21:03.760
but

21:03.760 --> 21:05.120
it's a

21:05.120 --> 21:07.520
it's a real jogger knot of

21:08.080 --> 21:09.600
information

21:09.600 --> 21:11.600
and messaging coming from

21:11.920 --> 21:18.720
Robert Malone's sub-stack and all of the appearances that he makes and you might not be aware that Jill Malone has made a few

21:19.280 --> 21:21.920
Solo appearances that I've also logged in our guide

21:24.320 --> 21:29.760
So we have a lot of work to do but I thought this one was a really interesting one and because I knew that there was a date night tonight

21:29.760 --> 21:32.400
I thought I would choose this one because this is date night. So

21:33.760 --> 21:35.920
Anyway, I'm going to give my breath a rest

21:36.000 --> 21:37.520
I

21:37.520 --> 21:42.160
I'm not sure how to figure that out, but we'll figure it out. Don't worry about me. I'm not going to

21:42.800 --> 21:44.800
Kroke or something like that. Here we go

21:45.280 --> 21:49.120
So this is the setting right look how cool this is and they're both going to have microphones

21:49.680 --> 21:52.240
So you might think at any moment there would be a

21:52.960 --> 21:58.080
A stage handle come out with like a pair of guitars and they're going to sit down and start singing

21:59.200 --> 22:01.920
It would be it would be the classic of all classics, wouldn't it?

22:02.880 --> 22:03.920
All right, y'all well

22:03.920 --> 22:08.160
I am just as excited as you are to welcome our first speakers of the day

22:08.560 --> 22:13.600
Yeah, you may know him as the doctor who broke the internet on the joe rogan podcast and

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
Yes, that deserves a round of applause

22:18.400 --> 22:26.640
Or the scientist who invented the m rma vaccine technology and you've probably seen some of his famous beaches from rallies and conferences around the world

22:27.040 --> 22:31.600
Um, and you know what I was testing test test testing in some rap videos lately. So

22:32.720 --> 22:37.040
I think that's pretty exciting. We have the mule. Oh, yeah, she said rap videos and stuff. Did you hear that?

22:37.040 --> 22:37.920
That's pretty funny

22:37.920 --> 22:40.160
Which is from rallies and conferences around the world

22:40.720 --> 22:44.720
And you know what I was just told that he's even been starring in some rap videos lately

22:44.880 --> 22:48.800
So because that makes sense, right? If you're trying to save the world

22:49.840 --> 22:54.160
From from going overboard using a technology that they shouldn't trust

22:55.120 --> 22:57.600
Using a technology that's been rushed

23:00.160 --> 23:05.120
What better way to do it than to be in some rap videos, right? I mean it makes perfect sense

23:06.080 --> 23:11.360
if you have to choose between splitting your time with news appearances or

23:12.240 --> 23:14.240
rallies like this one or

23:14.560 --> 23:16.560
or podcasts

23:16.880 --> 23:23.040
I mean, why wouldn't you choose to spend hours on a set for a for a rap video or even 20 minutes

23:23.920 --> 23:25.920
Why not?

23:26.720 --> 23:29.440
I think that's pretty exciting. We have the music thing in common

23:30.480 --> 23:39.120
um, dr. Robert Malone is a scientist physician writer podcaster commentator advocate and strong believer in our fundamental freedom of speech

23:41.680 --> 23:43.680
I have my notes here

23:45.440 --> 23:47.440
There's so much I don't want to forget anything

23:53.040 --> 23:58.080
Okay, and then dr. Jill Malone is a specialist in public policy and biotechnology

23:58.640 --> 24:06.400
She is the co-founder of several biotech companies and has held positions in academia and has an extensive publication record

24:06.880 --> 24:08.960
That's a weird list of things to say

24:10.640 --> 24:12.640
I thought she had like a

24:12.640 --> 24:19.760
Her degree is not exactly in biotech or biology or whatever is it? It's what the hell was that

24:19.760 --> 24:24.400
Wrong believer in our fundamental freedom of speech

24:27.040 --> 24:29.040
I have my notes here

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
There's so much I don't want to forget anything

24:32.960 --> 24:34.960
um

24:38.240 --> 24:43.360
Okay, and then dr. Jill Malone is a specialist in public policy and biotechnology

24:43.920 --> 24:51.680
She is the co-founder of several biotech companies and has held positions in academia and has an extensive publication record

24:52.240 --> 24:57.280
Um, she currently shares writing responsibilities for dr. Malone's sub stack, which i'm sure you've all read

24:57.440 --> 25:00.240
Which reaches almost a million people per day

25:00.960 --> 25:08.880
From their high school days in here in california and sanabarbra to breeding lucetanas on the east coast and simultaneously trying to save the world

25:09.520 --> 25:16.080
Uh, then melones have worked together as a dynamic team for decades. I think so they're trying to save the world

25:17.040 --> 25:22.480
I'm just going to briefly reduce this the crickets annoying if they're annoying. I can change them

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
um

25:35.600 --> 25:39.280
Just to give you a taste of what we're talking about here

25:39.280 --> 25:41.280
So

25:49.200 --> 25:53.120
So it's different as you know that with equity comes

25:56.640 --> 25:58.720
Class please welcome the new student robert

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
Welcome robert

26:02.400 --> 26:07.280
Well, thanks for the warm welcome teach it's lit no cap take a seat

26:10.240 --> 26:12.240
It's something in each and every one of you

26:17.440 --> 26:22.880
Are you surprised to see him in this video too? You didn't think he was a good guy, did you?

26:22.880 --> 26:24.880
Oh

26:35.760 --> 26:38.080
Okay, we're not gonna do that. I'm sorry. I didn't wanna

26:38.880 --> 26:40.720
Didn't even want you to have the hint

26:41.360 --> 26:44.000
That you thought that maybe we were gonna do that. We're not gonna do that

26:44.000 --> 26:47.360
I just thought it was you to see the beginning of that to realize the extent

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
to which we've been had

26:50.640 --> 26:54.560
Okay, that's not something to be laughed at or sneezed at

26:55.680 --> 26:58.240
Somebody who's trying to save the world doesn't do that

26:58.800 --> 26:59.760
Okay

26:59.760 --> 27:05.760
I think it's just so cool. Please help get me a warm wine country. Welcome to doctors robert and jill melon

27:05.840 --> 27:09.920
Give him a warm country wine country. Welcome for supporting

27:11.600 --> 27:13.600
the unity project has really

27:14.560 --> 27:21.200
A risen from california because of what you've all been subjected to i'm just trying to adjust the volume here

27:21.440 --> 27:26.480
Even before it existed the founder founding investor jeb hanson

27:28.320 --> 27:30.320
Actually called me out of the blue one

27:31.280 --> 27:36.240
Jesus jill and i maybe they malayle just in a trip to monry bay

27:37.520 --> 27:43.520
To visit our younger son who lives in davis. She'll get louder in a minute go whale watching to jill's great regret

27:44.080 --> 27:46.080
um and

27:46.080 --> 27:49.600
And i had been just to tell the story i had been really suffering

27:50.320 --> 27:54.320
Both with long covid and with post-vaccination syndrome

27:55.120 --> 27:57.120
And just a few days before

27:57.520 --> 27:59.520
long covid

28:00.240 --> 28:04.400
Long covid and post-vaccination syndrome. I mean did you hear that

28:06.000 --> 28:07.200
He is

28:07.200 --> 28:13.360
He had he had the first case of covid on the east coast and he was at the super spreader event

28:13.360 --> 28:15.360
at some boston conference

28:16.080 --> 28:20.080
And he had long covid then he had post-vax syndrome

28:23.120 --> 28:25.120
Or we traveled out here

28:25.440 --> 28:28.000
uh to um hang out with our son

28:29.360 --> 28:35.840
Meryl nast had visited the farm to carry together with mary hall and these are two of the leaders of children's health defense

28:35.840 --> 28:37.840
See i think it's 10 22

28:37.840 --> 28:42.640
Good chat and mary had said robert what you need to do is take some

28:43.280 --> 28:45.280
ivermectin

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
and

28:48.480 --> 28:54.320
And so she prescribed it and you need to do is take some ivermectin

28:56.480 --> 28:58.480
and

28:58.640 --> 29:01.200
And so she prescribed it and

29:02.400 --> 29:04.720
I started taking it immediately before we went out

29:05.520 --> 29:10.080
And up until that point joe can attest it was hard for me to do farm chores

29:10.160 --> 29:15.440
I usually cannot work a 20-year-old because i've been we've i think this is our fifth or sixth small farm

29:15.920 --> 29:19.920
And as as i think you said you were suffering first from long covid and then

29:20.480 --> 29:26.320
vaccine injury the post-vaccination syndrome and uh so I started taking ivermectin and it stunned me

29:26.800 --> 29:29.760
I out height our 20-something sun

29:30.320 --> 29:33.760
uh along big surf did he report this on the

29:34.720 --> 29:36.720
Brett Weinstein podcast

29:37.680 --> 29:40.160
I honestly don't remember him saying this

29:42.160 --> 29:44.560
I remember him saying maybe that he took

29:45.760 --> 29:51.280
He took the shot because he thought it might help with long covid that there was rumors on the internet that it might help with long covid

29:51.280 --> 29:53.280
So he took the shot, but it didn't help

29:55.680 --> 29:59.600
But I never heard that he took I never heard that he took

30:00.400 --> 30:02.400
Ivermectin

30:02.480 --> 30:05.520
And then uh he could out hike his son

30:06.480 --> 30:08.400
Wow, that's interesting. Isn't it?

30:09.680 --> 30:14.720
That's interesting. I thought he took pepsen or something and I was like oh this stuff clearly works

30:16.800 --> 30:22.800
Um, and it was only like two days in right with the treatment. He was it was amazing the response that I had

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
Wow now I know

30:25.920 --> 30:27.920
I know he didn't say that

30:28.880 --> 30:31.680
Because they started the Brett Weinstein podcast with

30:33.280 --> 30:37.680
Robert Malone was safe because he had been twice vaccinated and infected

30:38.480 --> 30:41.280
Steve curse was safe because he was twice vaccinated

30:41.760 --> 30:47.600
And Brett Weinstein was safe because he was taking ivermectin prophylactically if ivermectin

30:48.640 --> 30:55.200
Had cleared Robert Malone's long covid and post vax syndrome

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
in two days

30:58.800 --> 31:05.360
Then he would have been able to say that on the Brett Weinstein podcast because on the Brett Weinstein podcast

31:05.440 --> 31:10.320
He was speaking of both his shots and his long covid

31:11.360 --> 31:13.600
as being kind of more or less in the past

31:14.560 --> 31:17.040
Do you hear this?

31:19.120 --> 31:24.560
Please tell me hear it because this is really happening right now. We just opened a treasure chest. It's crazy

31:25.120 --> 31:31.600
I'm going to move this g up. I think I pushed it down the other day because and then I relapsed and I took my words and

31:32.080 --> 31:38.080
Face was then recently. I've completed the uh, flccc recovery protocol

31:39.040 --> 31:46.160
That uh palmeric and pure cori have come up with and it's it's really helped me out. I'm not making any medical advice

31:46.720 --> 31:54.080
Um, but i'm not licensed in the state of california. I think so now he's saying that the flccc protocol also works

31:54.560 --> 31:56.560
So

31:56.560 --> 31:58.560
So this has to be 22

32:00.000 --> 32:02.960
Unless he was really talking in the past 10s a few minutes ago

32:06.320 --> 32:13.200
Again, this with this interview is the video is posted in may of 23, but that would be june july

32:14.480 --> 32:16.480
august

32:17.360 --> 32:19.360
It would be before my my

32:20.640 --> 32:24.000
My family went to the netherlands this summer. So I guess it's possible

32:25.360 --> 32:27.760
It's possible that it's from this year

32:29.840 --> 32:32.240
But then I really don't think he's telling the truth here

32:32.240 --> 32:37.600
He can't be telling the truth here if he's going to say that he took ivermecan within two days he could hike

32:39.920 --> 32:43.200
And that that was a wonder drug in that then also by the way

32:43.840 --> 32:46.320
I also completed the treatment

32:46.960 --> 32:53.600
Of the flccc protocol and that also works great, but i'm not giving medical advice. Wow. Did that sound slimy

32:54.400 --> 32:56.400
Oh, man

32:56.400 --> 33:00.080
That sounded so slimy. I think this is our fifth or sixth small farm

33:00.480 --> 33:04.560
And as as I think you said you were suffering first from long covid and then

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
Vaccine injury. Yeah, the post vaccination syndrome

33:07.600 --> 33:12.320
And uh, so I started taking ivermectin and it stunned me. I out height

33:12.960 --> 33:14.960
our 20-something son

33:14.960 --> 33:18.640
Uh along big serve and I was like oh this stuff clearly works

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
um

33:21.680 --> 33:26.880
And it was only like two days in right with the treatment. It was it was amazing the response that I had

33:27.600 --> 33:33.360
and then I relapsed and I took more and uh, then recently I've completed

33:34.080 --> 33:36.800
the uh flccc recovery protocol

33:37.760 --> 33:40.480
That uh palmeric and pyracori have come up with

33:41.120 --> 33:44.880
And it's it's really helped me out. I'm not giving you medical advice

33:45.440 --> 33:48.800
Um, but i'm not licensed in the state of california. Thank god

33:49.360 --> 33:51.360
um

33:52.320 --> 33:56.000
But um that's but so so we're we're hanging out

33:56.960 --> 33:59.120
um in this a little kind of

34:00.720 --> 34:04.240
Old, you know california has all these old motels

34:05.200 --> 34:09.600
So we're hanging out in this uh monoray bay hotel

34:10.800 --> 34:12.400
Motel

34:12.480 --> 34:13.920
And I get a phone call

34:13.920 --> 34:16.000
from this guy, jeff hansen

34:16.160 --> 34:17.200
Out of the blue

34:17.200 --> 34:18.560
And he says

34:18.560 --> 34:21.920
Robert, I really like what you're doing and I want to support you and i'm going to wire

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I'm not even going to say the size of the check

34:24.560 --> 34:26.160
Into your bank account

34:26.160 --> 34:31.280
And I was like at that point we were just you know scrapping to make ends meet

34:31.360 --> 34:33.920
We'd been doing everything based on our own cash flow

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
Uh hadn't had any support or anything

34:37.200 --> 34:41.520
And suddenly out of the blue this guy calls up and says he wants to donate to us

34:42.320 --> 34:47.600
And that was key to basically me being able to continue to

34:48.560 --> 34:55.280
Be a free agent and just speak truth and travel. Yeah, yeah and in the travel and then then um

34:55.840 --> 35:01.200
There was a rally here in california and a bunch of mothers came together

35:02.560 --> 35:05.200
And who would that have been do you think that was curse

35:07.120 --> 35:09.120
Who gave him all that money?

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
Hmm

35:14.400 --> 35:16.400
It's strange to me

35:19.040 --> 35:22.880
And he certainly didn't need the money. I mean he's pretending as though he doesn't have any money

35:22.880 --> 35:26.160
I'm not really sure that it can be true. It's possible. I guess but

35:30.080 --> 35:34.160
I don't know. There's something fishing here. We i'm sorry. Um, yeah, the mama mama bears

35:34.160 --> 35:38.880
I've been saying this all the way through mama bears are what's going to save america

35:39.120 --> 35:40.640
um

35:40.640 --> 35:42.640
and

35:42.640 --> 35:48.560
And that is what gave rise to the unity project was a a protest I think here in orange county

35:49.200 --> 35:53.440
Uh in which a lot of these mama bears came together and they said we're not going to stand for this

35:54.240 --> 35:59.120
And um, that's that's what gave rise to the unity project and it still continues

35:59.120 --> 36:02.640
I think the unity project right now is in the middle of a fundraise

36:03.520 --> 36:06.080
Trying to get enough to get a matching grant

36:06.560 --> 36:09.120
laura sextra who's the leader now

36:09.680 --> 36:12.320
Hasn't shared with me who's providing them

36:12.880 --> 36:14.880
matching funds or what the terms are but

36:15.440 --> 36:18.480
Um, that's that's I think why we're here

36:19.200 --> 36:24.400
And I I thank you very much for your being willing to support the unity project

36:24.960 --> 36:28.080
And its mission which has been very much about your children

36:28.640 --> 36:30.640
And and they've kind of morphed

36:30.720 --> 36:37.280
From the vaccines and the vans vaccine mandates to really, you know medical freedom and then that's just a subset

36:37.280 --> 36:43.440
It's really about freedom. Um, that's the truth of it and freedom and children and protecting children. Um, yeah

36:43.600 --> 36:49.040
Absolutely and protecting children and now we're seeing all of these additional threats that we never expected

36:49.680 --> 36:55.120
Um that are coming out of these various afeperts at social engineering through influencing our children

36:55.360 --> 36:58.160
Which you know when you when you talk about the um

36:58.720 --> 37:04.320
Peds transgender stuff. It's not just in america. It's you know, nick hudson our friend

37:04.480 --> 37:06.080
Who's a south african data?

37:06.080 --> 37:08.080
Now he said a panda

37:08.160 --> 37:12.320
Panda the same stuff is happening in south africa the same stuff is happening in europe

37:12.400 --> 37:14.060
This is a globalized

37:14.060 --> 37:17.840
Synchronized effort and it's really scary. I think that's one of the most important messages

37:17.840 --> 37:22.720
We can share with you is what last year we hit over 400 000 miles on commercial air

37:23.200 --> 37:29.120
Plus the privates. I'm traveling all over the world trying to help with the freedom movement and

37:29.680 --> 37:33.120
I'm bringing truth about the jabs and early treatment

37:33.840 --> 37:37.760
And one of the things that has been the most stunning I think to both of us

37:38.480 --> 37:44.720
Is that what we've experienced here in the states and you certainly have been at the tip of the spear in

37:45.280 --> 37:48.000
In california and experiencing these policies

37:48.800 --> 37:51.600
And I jill warned me not to trash california too much

37:52.320 --> 37:57.680
As as was said we're california natives. Okay. I was born in paul walto in the old stanford hospital. She was born in

37:58.080 --> 38:03.040
Uh van eyes in the old ucla hospital. Um, we grew up in galita

38:03.600 --> 38:09.760
Uh, we're high school sweethearts from dos pueblos went to uc san diego and uc davis

38:10.000 --> 38:16.720
Yeah, so so that's our we're we're deeply rooted in california and we're now california expats living in virginia

38:17.200 --> 38:20.880
And and we'll just leave it at that. I don't have any problems with water

38:22.000 --> 38:23.680
And I like to say

38:23.680 --> 38:26.080
Um, if I don't mow it a tree grows

38:27.120 --> 38:30.400
Um, so that's that's a little different from around here

38:30.400 --> 38:34.320
But but the truth is that california is you all know has an uphill battle

38:34.640 --> 38:36.160
You know, it's not about california

38:36.160 --> 38:41.920
It's about california and politicians and and what's happened to the state. Yeah, and in the point

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I was trying to get towards is

38:44.800 --> 38:50.720
What was stunning for us is these policies that were deployed in the united states were deployed globally

38:51.360 --> 38:56.320
In a harmonized synchronized way. I've never seen any i'm a veteran of multiple outbreaks

38:56.400 --> 38:58.000
This is kind of my business

38:58.000 --> 39:01.600
People there's a cadre small cadre of people that are kind of outbreak junkies

39:02.160 --> 39:07.280
And they get the calls early on like I did on january 4th of 2020 saying okay

39:07.280 --> 39:09.840
We got another problem. We got to get going on this blah blah blah

39:10.240 --> 39:12.240
And you know, now we know the whole military

39:13.440 --> 39:18.160
Biodefense complex behind that and there's a dark side to all of that. I didn't really know about

39:18.720 --> 39:23.680
But I have never experienced anything like this with a censorship propaganda

39:24.320 --> 39:31.600
Um, the control of information and really the fifth generation warfare or what matt tabie called today hybrid warfare

39:32.160 --> 39:35.200
In a fascinating essay from was it rebel news?

39:36.240 --> 39:39.520
No, it was not it was racket racket racket news

39:40.320 --> 39:43.920
So that's on sub stack. I really recommend that and we did

39:44.800 --> 39:51.120
We post it through our own sub stack. So if any of you are subscribers to ours, you know, and by the way

39:51.120 --> 39:54.800
You could be it's it's free. You don't have to pay. This is not drifting

39:55.840 --> 40:01.760
Um, but uh, they put out a fantastic article with an intro from matt tabie

40:02.320 --> 40:05.040
that of of the twitter files fame

40:05.520 --> 40:11.200
Um that lays out all of these organizations that have been set up that form this new

40:11.760 --> 40:15.120
Uh censorship industrial complex that people have been talking about

40:15.600 --> 40:18.160
So that is absolutely something for you guys to check out

40:18.160 --> 40:22.480
But the the stunning thing is like you remember all of the artists

40:23.120 --> 40:26.960
All the comedians that were all basically paid

40:27.440 --> 40:32.880
Um to put out the propaganda of the pro vaccine, you know, we've got vaccine all that

40:33.200 --> 40:38.400
Oh, by the way, micky wilson's next, uh video is going to be coming out in just a couple weeks check that out

40:39.040 --> 40:40.000
um

40:40.000 --> 40:44.720
Uh, which includes a lot of russians getting those, you know film clips from a lot of that

40:44.800 --> 40:46.800
Do you hear what he's doing right here?

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
Boy, it was really painful

40:51.440 --> 40:57.600
He's trying to tell these people that do you remember the people on social media and all the all the hollywood stars saying hey

40:57.600 --> 40:59.520
We got vaccine or

40:59.520 --> 41:01.520
Hey, get the vaccine

41:01.760 --> 41:03.760
And we do remember that we do

41:05.360 --> 41:06.400
But

41:06.400 --> 41:10.640
Leading people by the nose to that part of the of the narrative

41:11.600 --> 41:14.960
Doesn't lead them back far enough to see that there were the same people

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
And more

41:19.120 --> 41:23.760
Seating the narrative about the novel virus and the fact that it could be a worst case scenario

41:24.320 --> 41:26.400
And what that worst case scenario might be

41:28.080 --> 41:30.800
And that the seating of that narrative allowed

41:32.480 --> 41:38.720
There to be a rollout of the vaccine that needed hollywood stars and people on tv and

41:39.280 --> 41:42.240
And late night talk show host to dance about the vaccine

41:44.000 --> 41:46.960
And that wouldn't have happened had there not been a year earlier

41:48.000 --> 41:49.040
a

41:49.040 --> 41:51.200
covert and overt campaign

41:51.840 --> 41:57.120
To make people believe that there was a novel virus spreading around the world that either came from a bat cave

41:57.760 --> 42:01.120
Or came from a bat cave and then into a laboratory and then out

42:02.080 --> 42:04.080
That

42:04.080 --> 42:06.560
That's spectacular because he's not going there

42:07.760 --> 42:11.920
He's not going to tell you that they hyped it up from the very beginning and that they used

42:12.640 --> 42:16.320
Things like remdesivir to make it seem like the virus was really deadly

42:18.800 --> 42:22.720
Because naive young doctors applying the protocol that they were told

42:25.440 --> 42:27.440
Was the protocol that they had to follow

42:32.320 --> 42:33.840
That

42:33.840 --> 42:36.160
That person has covid and kidney failure

42:37.520 --> 42:39.520
They don't think about what they've been giving them

42:41.520 --> 42:47.680
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the magic spell right here. This is the enchantment in spades

42:49.120 --> 42:52.400
And I really think it's from may 2023. It's from this year

42:53.680 --> 42:55.680
This is how they've done it

42:56.560 --> 43:01.280
Again, the car is speeding so fast that you can't see all the details

43:02.960 --> 43:07.920
Especially because it's such a nice car and your seat is such luxurious love of leather

43:10.880 --> 43:13.680
And the smell of the driver's cigar is just right

43:15.200 --> 43:17.200
Or the driver's pipe as I would prefer

43:18.720 --> 43:22.160
I mean ladies and gentlemen listen to these masterfuls

43:23.120 --> 43:29.840
Masterful storytellers knowing exactly what the faith is and how to proselytize it

43:32.160 --> 43:34.720
That happened across the world in a heart

43:34.720 --> 43:37.840
And so pointing at propaganda that's not propaganda

43:38.080 --> 43:42.640
Pointing at propaganda that is propaganda rather but not the propaganda that got you there

43:43.360 --> 43:45.360
Is asking the wrong question

43:46.880 --> 43:48.880
Who hyped up the vaccine?

43:48.880 --> 43:50.880
Who's responsible for this vaccine?

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
Who did the vaccine?

43:54.240 --> 44:00.480
Completely ignores a whole year where people said that who you could have asked who said this was a novel virus

44:00.720 --> 44:02.720
Who said this virus was deadly?

44:02.880 --> 44:04.880
Who said that remdesivir would work?

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
Who said that ventilators was necessary?

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
Who said that we needed more ventilators?

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
Who said we needed that damn ship?

44:14.320 --> 44:17.120
Who said we needed mandazalam given to people in

44:17.840 --> 44:19.840
in care homes

44:19.840 --> 44:23.680
Who said we should give all the old people the vaccine first?

44:23.680 --> 44:27.120
Who said we should treat all the most vulnerable with the vaccine first?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.800
Who are responsible for the first year and a half of this pandemic?

44:36.800 --> 44:39.760
Not who's responsible for the year and a half after that

44:40.720 --> 44:41.760
First things first

44:44.720 --> 44:46.400
Harmonize simultaneous fashion

44:47.280 --> 44:49.520
All of that so for instance we were traveling

44:50.480 --> 44:55.360
in vienna one of the capitals of the arts and particularly music in europe

44:56.080 --> 44:57.120
and

44:57.120 --> 45:02.480
We were brought there by people that were really part of the resistance within vienna

45:03.280 --> 45:06.160
So they had an underground resistance because they were all locked down

45:06.400 --> 45:12.400
They couldn't they were not allowed to congregate they couldn't there's no way they would have been arrested if they had a meaning like this

45:13.040 --> 45:17.760
Okay, and what what had happened was that one of the kind of bohemian

45:18.560 --> 45:21.200
Hangouts for artists, etc

45:21.920 --> 45:23.920
in downtown

45:23.920 --> 45:26.480
paper over all its windows with craft paper

45:27.440 --> 45:28.560
and

45:28.560 --> 45:30.560
started holding

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
surreptitious evening meetings

45:33.040 --> 45:35.920
And and just get together say we're just meetings they were you know

45:35.920 --> 45:42.320
They continued on with with their business surreptitiously, which was highly illegal to just have people come and hang

45:43.360 --> 45:47.600
So we connected with these people when we went there to speak for a couple of events

45:48.160 --> 45:55.600
And what we learned was that at the same time that all the artists and comedians here in the United States had been purchased basically

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
To put out the propaganda

45:58.320 --> 46:00.880
The same had happened throughout austria

46:01.840 --> 46:05.920
It throughout vienna basically all the artists and musicians

46:06.720 --> 46:11.200
Were all paid right off the bat to promote the jab

46:12.160 --> 46:16.400
I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my life and it still boggles my mind

46:16.960 --> 46:20.560
Who you know this this the big question is who's the puppet master right?

46:21.120 --> 46:28.880
What what is the organization that has that much capital and that much organizational capability to deploy what we have been subjected to

46:29.360 --> 46:32.080
For the last three years and I don't know the answer

46:32.640 --> 46:35.600
Oh my gosh, what talk about it what?

46:36.240 --> 46:37.360
but

46:37.360 --> 46:38.400
that

46:38.400 --> 46:42.080
Complex I want you to think about that. He says I don't know the answer

46:42.080 --> 46:47.360
Let's listen that one more time and I'm going to explain to you why that is ridiculous and it's going to be very easy

46:47.360 --> 46:50.720
It's going to take me like two sentences before you're going to be like oh wait

46:51.360 --> 46:54.400
Yeah, he does that to promote the jab

46:55.360 --> 46:59.600
I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my life and it still boggles my mind

47:00.160 --> 47:03.760
Who you know this this the big question is who's the puppet master right?

47:04.400 --> 47:12.160
What what is the organization that has that much capital and that much organizational capability to deploy what we have been subjected to

47:12.640 --> 47:14.800
for the last three years

47:14.800 --> 47:16.800
And I don't know the answer

47:18.240 --> 47:20.240
And I don't know the answer he says

47:26.720 --> 47:28.720
What if I were to say Robert Malone

47:29.680 --> 47:36.640
If anovial would have been chosen as the primary vaccine candidate or one of the primary vaccine candidates

47:37.280 --> 47:41.680
Who would have chosen anovial and how would it have been brought to market?

47:42.480 --> 47:44.480
Who would have brought it to market?

47:44.880 --> 47:49.520
Do you think he could have answered that question? Do you think Jill Malone could have answered that question?

47:50.640 --> 47:53.600
Because I think the answer to that question is the same answer

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
as who did this

47:57.760 --> 47:59.760
And he pretends like I don't know

48:01.120 --> 48:05.440
They did call me and tell me you know to spin up my team and so I went

48:06.160 --> 48:07.680
and drove my

48:07.680 --> 48:09.680
Honda Civic with

48:09.680 --> 48:12.640
Four non-matching wheels and one missing corner panel

48:13.360 --> 48:18.240
To ditra headquarters and spun my team up who were all volunteer guys

48:18.880 --> 48:20.880
We lived on submarine sandwiches

48:21.520 --> 48:23.520
And stale soda

48:23.920 --> 48:25.840
While I was creating a you know

48:26.960 --> 48:30.080
Nothing big. I mean like an x-ray crystallography model of the

48:30.960 --> 48:36.160
3acl protease, but you know, it's no big deal and then we were running it past, you know

48:37.680 --> 48:39.680
All the known drugs

48:39.680 --> 48:46.080
The FDA approved drugs. What's that Robert Malone? What did you say? Uh, we were running it past all the drugs in the world

48:46.960 --> 48:48.080
What?

48:48.080 --> 48:51.040
We were running it past all the drugs in the world

48:51.680 --> 48:54.720
Like all the FDA approved drugs and pharmaceuticals

48:55.920 --> 48:57.920
What were you running past that?

48:57.920 --> 49:01.600
My model of we were matching using i.i. You know

49:02.560 --> 49:06.480
a computer generated model of x-ray crystallography of the

49:07.600 --> 49:09.600
3acl protease

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And then we were matching

49:13.040 --> 49:18.640
Computer generated models of all the substances the FDA had approved

49:19.520 --> 49:22.800
That's a pretty big database, isn't it? Robert Malone

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
How many substances is that?

49:26.000 --> 49:31.200
How long did it take you to do that to make a model of the of the novel virus

49:31.840 --> 49:33.120
and its

49:33.120 --> 49:35.120
special protease

49:35.120 --> 49:36.000
um

49:36.000 --> 49:40.880
How long did it take you to make that x-ray crystallography model and then make out a

49:41.520 --> 49:44.640
a suitable interface for this database of

49:45.360 --> 49:47.360
of substances

49:47.760 --> 49:50.560
Um about three weeks about three weeks you're on it

49:55.520 --> 49:58.000
I have hypotheses if we talk about it in the book

49:58.800 --> 49:59.920
but

49:59.920 --> 50:00.960
That

50:00.960 --> 50:02.160
Complex

50:02.160 --> 50:06.880
Whatever that is whatever those those puppet masters are whatever they're doing

50:07.440 --> 50:12.080
They're still out there and they're still doing it and that we can the good news is that we can now see it

50:13.040 --> 50:15.920
The good news is that I mean always looking for silver lightings

50:15.920 --> 50:17.600
I hate doing these

50:17.600 --> 50:24.640
Meetings and talks and stuff and it's just down down down. Oh this horrible thing. Look what they've done too. Nice. Lisa doing just now

50:25.120 --> 50:27.120
It's just so is that Simon says

50:28.000 --> 50:32.320
But just to say it, you know, we all know it goes beyond covid. Lisa Simon says

50:33.520 --> 50:40.560
The origins of covid whether it's you know, um anything that you want to say against the Ukrainian war

50:41.200 --> 50:46.480
You know, um the slightest criticism nor stream nor stream. It's it's all getting censored now

50:46.880 --> 50:48.880
You know and propaganda

50:48.880 --> 50:53.680
Everything everything in is you know here in california. It's all being done algorithmically

50:54.080 --> 50:56.080
They want to do it now with ai

50:56.240 --> 51:02.560
We're we're in an information battlescape. This is what it is. I talk about fifth generation warfare. It'll be lecturing

51:03.840 --> 51:06.400
Um as I say matt how you be calls it hybrid warfare

51:07.360 --> 51:12.000
I call it fifth generation governance because it's not warfare. It's just governance

51:13.920 --> 51:17.760
And the trick is is that he's telling you you'll never figure out who it is

51:22.000 --> 51:27.920
And i've been told by the way by the anti-defamation league i've been called a anti-government conspiracy theorist

51:28.480 --> 51:31.520
Because I talk about fifth generation warfare

51:32.080 --> 51:34.720
Uh the administrative state and what's my third sin?

51:35.440 --> 51:37.440
Um

51:37.840 --> 51:43.200
It's administrative state fifth generation were fair and I forget what my third crime is

51:43.760 --> 51:49.440
My third thought crime, but but basically this is established technology. It's been in the literature for years

51:49.520 --> 51:51.520
It's taught within dod

51:51.680 --> 51:57.440
There was a dod operations army our operations manual that was put out in the 90s about deploying this

51:58.080 --> 51:59.600
And we've had

51:59.600 --> 52:01.760
folks within syops units that were

52:02.320 --> 52:08.080
um retired come up to us in these rallies and say yes, what you're saying is absolutely true

52:08.080 --> 52:15.040
This is absolutely what's going on and i'm mad as hell about it because basically we built this suite of technologies

52:15.520 --> 52:19.040
During the cold war to counter what was truly the most

52:19.680 --> 52:25.040
incredible syops capability in history a man which was deployed by the soviet union

52:25.840 --> 52:28.160
And we had to have something to counteract that

52:29.040 --> 52:34.880
And then instead of having as bobby kennedy said the other day in boston instead of having a

52:35.920 --> 52:40.240
A dividend from the end of the cold war. We pivoted to the middle east

52:40.880 --> 52:42.880
And we started foreign adventures there, right?

52:43.520 --> 52:44.320
um

52:44.320 --> 52:47.920
And what one of the things we did is we deployed these syops units

52:48.960 --> 52:54.400
In the uk deployed the 77th brigade and there's syops units in canada in mousieland, australia

52:54.960 --> 52:58.080
We deployed them against our foreign adversaries in the middle east

52:59.200 --> 53:06.960
And every day this these capabilities get stronger and stronger more and more personnel more and more government contractors

53:07.200 --> 53:10.480
Because that's the nature of the beast. That's the way things work in dc

53:10.960 --> 53:16.560
Okay, is you can never kill a program. It just they get they have it like this organic thing

53:16.560 --> 53:22.800
They just grow and grow and grow and um get more and more funding and more and more lobbyists

53:23.520 --> 53:29.520
And so then we had the failures in syria iraq, afghanistan

53:30.400 --> 53:36.320
I mean, I argue that we have never won a fifth generation warfare fourth generation. Yeah, um

53:37.040 --> 53:39.040
Going back to the vehicle

53:39.040 --> 53:40.000
Okay

53:40.000 --> 53:42.240
And we lost those battles functionally

53:43.280 --> 53:49.520
And covid came along and they deployed those capabilities as part of the whole of military response

53:50.400 --> 53:54.480
And i'm sorry to say it for those that are america maga folks

53:55.200 --> 53:59.200
But it was mr. Trump that declared the whole of military response

53:59.920 --> 54:06.560
And that included deploying those syops units against the civilians which really started though. It started in

54:07.360 --> 54:15.600
2016 when um obama softened the anti-propagation propaganda act which said that they could not deploy propaganda on the american people and

54:15.760 --> 54:21.520
Congress passed a law that um very much softened that act that was passed in 1948

54:22.000 --> 54:27.600
And that was what really opened the door to syops on the american people and and the logic is you've heard it

54:27.600 --> 54:31.680
You've heard mr. obama speaking about this again and again. I'm not coming here to trash the man

54:32.240 --> 54:36.400
But you heard it at stanford at the hoover institute when he gave his lecture

54:37.200 --> 54:43.760
In order to preserve democracy quote unquote right we and those of you that are constitutionalists will all point out

54:43.840 --> 54:48.640
We don't actually have a democracy right so i don't want to i'm sorry. Did he just say trumped in it?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.960
I think he says trump did it with that argument. We have a republic

54:53.680 --> 54:54.720
Okay

54:54.720 --> 54:55.920
But

54:55.920 --> 54:59.920
The logic that's been promoted is in order to preserve democracy

55:00.560 --> 55:04.240
We have to have censorship we have to control information

55:04.800 --> 55:11.600
And and basically it is it is a total upside down, you know, we're all living in upside down in clung world anyhow

55:12.000 --> 55:18.400
Um, it's an upside down argument that the first amendment has got to be jennisoned in order to preserve democracy

55:18.480 --> 55:20.480
That's where we live right now

55:20.640 --> 55:28.800
And they absolutely want to continue to reinforce this and is this article that just came out documents. We have was it 10 50?

55:29.040 --> 55:31.040
he lives he listed 50

55:31.680 --> 55:32.800
NGOs

55:32.800 --> 55:39.040
government organizations that are actively pursuing censorship and propaganda and he goes through with

55:39.760 --> 55:42.640
Details on who's funding them what they've done

55:43.120 --> 55:50.720
Um where they operate it's it's quite an amazing piece in the racket. It's very long. It's almost book length

55:51.120 --> 55:57.200
So that's that's you know, I've come to the point and I think we've come to the point. Yes medical freedom is important

55:58.320 --> 55:59.840
and um

55:59.840 --> 56:04.320
The the rights of parents to educate their own children are important

56:05.280 --> 56:10.640
Um matias desma just put out a great article about the efforts in the netherlands

56:11.040 --> 56:16.960
Uh, the state is advocating that they should take over child re mandatory schooling starting at four years old

56:17.280 --> 56:24.400
So children have to go to mandatory preschool and kindergarten because parents are not adequately trained to raise children

56:25.120 --> 56:31.840
Okay, and I guarantee this stuff that's going down there in europe is going to be coming on shore here on the side of the Atlantic

56:32.160 --> 56:39.600
Very cuz it's all driven it literally. This is not a conspiracy theory. It is absolutely all driven by the world economic forum

56:40.400 --> 56:41.680
Okay

56:41.680 --> 56:49.440
And and the world economic forum and everyone says oh look at dalos look at the wealthy and supposedly he never heard of that before

56:50.320 --> 56:52.320
before merrill and

56:52.880 --> 56:56.160
And mary holland and other people explained it to him

56:57.360 --> 56:59.360
That's the story that I heard

56:59.520 --> 57:02.560
I mean before this all started he had no idea

57:03.280 --> 57:08.240
Who the wef was or that there was some global governments or where you know, whatever

57:09.520 --> 57:12.880
Apparently he'd never heard a seppie or anything right. I mean, how could he

57:13.840 --> 57:16.480
Obviously heard of those those organizations

57:17.360 --> 57:19.360
He's given a talk at the who

57:21.200 --> 57:27.200
But i've been told by multiple people that the story goes that the horse farmer robert malone

57:28.160 --> 57:30.160
part-time contractor

57:32.480 --> 57:34.480
Study section leader

57:35.360 --> 57:38.880
Curator of billions of dollars in nih grant money

57:40.320 --> 57:46.160
And broker of vaccine technologies between countries had no idea what the wf was

57:47.120 --> 57:53.280
Until a few people told him at when when he got started in this all speaking out

57:54.240 --> 57:57.840
That's how naive he was that's what we're supposed to believe

57:59.440 --> 58:04.640
The people partying it's not about that. Okay, this is this is the puppet over here

58:05.120 --> 58:12.000
The world economic forum is the largest it's a trade union of the largest transnational corporations in the world

58:12.400 --> 58:20.960
And in 2019 they signed a extensive strategic agreement with the united nations where they're now helping to fund the united nations which

58:21.440 --> 58:22.720
you know

58:22.800 --> 58:27.680
That makes them kind of a partner when you give somebody money then you can take away money

58:27.920 --> 58:33.200
They absolutely seek to become the world government and that this is you know, we have an experiment that's happening

58:33.920 --> 58:39.760
You know right before our eyes in world governance. That's never happened before where we've had corporations

58:40.320 --> 58:47.040
You know, which is basically fascism. It's corporatism taking over the world governance. It's just scary scary thing

58:47.120 --> 58:49.120
Yeah, so let's talk about that just for a minute

58:49.120 --> 58:53.920
And so if this is going to happen realize people that somebody's got to break it to them

58:55.280 --> 58:58.640
Somebody's got to break it to everybody on earth that this is happening

58:59.760 --> 59:03.760
And break it to them in such a way so that they react but they don't react

59:04.480 --> 59:07.040
They get upset, but they don't really do anything about it

59:08.320 --> 59:11.680
So that they react by asking the wrong questions

59:12.400 --> 59:13.920
And

59:13.920 --> 59:18.160
So you're going to find more and more and more voices on the internet

59:18.160 --> 59:22.160
They're going to start to tell you that it's really happening. They're really doing this

59:23.920 --> 59:26.080
But they're not going to tell you how to get out

59:27.200 --> 59:33.680
Because they're not going to show you the door over there, which is that well, you know have this whole public health thing is a is a hoax

59:34.960 --> 59:40.240
And if this climate change thing is happening, it's happening because of variables far beyond

59:41.200 --> 59:46.480
our contribution to the co2 continent our content of the atmosphere

59:48.480 --> 59:55.520
And that extraordinary realization that you are being governed by mythology is what makes the whole spell go poof

59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.640
But now the spell is never going to go poof if you tell people that

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.280
That the fascism fascists are trying to replace fascism

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:12.560
Or replace democracy with fascism. They're never that's not going to break the spell. That's the plan

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.520
That's like going to a woman and saying, you know, I think you're

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.800
Your husband's cheating on you, but I don't know

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.760
You're never going to really be able to do anything about it because we're never going to catch him and he's a really good liar

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.320
And you know, it might not be his fault. It might be the lady's fault

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.520
Maybe she'll go away, but we're never going to be able to catch him and

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320
You know

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:42.080
I mean, it's like saying there's a problem, but there's nothing you can do about it is the perfect kind of

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:51.520
It's the perfect kind of message because it kind of brain washes you into into keeping sat in your chair and go, yeah

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400
Get him, robert

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.760
Man, i'm glad robert melon speaking up for us

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.360
And if they've got it under control, what do I need to do?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.360
I'm just happy that dappy to know that those people are out there boy. That's great

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.040
I could never do as much as Jill and robert melon are doing

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:20.640
I mean, I can only keep a horse farm. I can't also tour around the world first-class airplane flights

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.160
uh

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.360
week-long cruises off the coast of turkey and not tubbing in

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:32.320
Scandinavian countries with my fellow dissidents speaking in the european parliament every year for three years running

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
I mean, I gotta take care of horses

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.960
But i'm sure glad that this guy can do it these guys are all you know, they all the people in the audience here they got vineyards to run

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960
But these guys, you know

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.080
Nine foals this year. That's a pretty modest horse farm

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:58.000
Um, I talk about this in many of our writings in the book. Um, we lay out the logic

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.160
With detail and citations to establish political science work

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.640
There's been a lot of of pollution and obfuscation around this word fascism

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.920
Fascism has been weaponized in so many ways that it's difficult now to know what that word actually means

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.320
The word weaponized words at words being weaponized has been used so often

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.360
It's hard to know what it means

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.040
It's all this neuro linguistic programming crap

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.280
all this renaming of of an age old mastery of the language of

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.200
of the use of language to convince people of things

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.720
I

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.840
Don't think there's probably more than seven or eight basic methods of how it's done, but most of them revolve around storytelling

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.440
Someone just told me a story today. I have a u-turn

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.200
in terms of getting somebody to to think about

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920
an alternative

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.520
Explanation or an alternative interpretation of reality first

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.000
Acknowledging what they say and then offering an alternative and then asking questions to get them there

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.640
Something like that

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.640
And I have no doubt

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.920
that there are

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.880
Ways in which we can we can convince one another

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.800
And there are people who are just really good at it for intuitive reasons

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.880
And that mastery has gone back

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Generations, this is not a new trick

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.320
the chat gtp finally figured out

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.880
And that is again one of these things where when people drop these hints about who they're weaponizing AI

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.440
who their weaponizing language who they're weaponizing

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.880
social media who weaponized weaponized weaponized

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080
as if it's getting any

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.960
Any more special except for the fact that we have completely and totally said

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.960
Yeah, sure

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960
I'll read whatever you put on here

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.480
As if that's not the biggest dumb choice that we make every day

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.600
rather than

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.400
What they do with our attention

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.120
We say that oh, yeah, it's them it's their fault. You know, I'm supposed to be it's just supposed to be safe

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.440
I'm supposed to be for me. You know, it's just for me to communicate my friend's stuff

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.720
And in reality you are giving them your full attention and then thinking that they're going to do something ethical with it

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080
with no regulation

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.440
Think about how dumb that is how dumb we are

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.320
How dumb am I that I've given my kid a set of kids a cell phone

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.240
When their attention can be hijacked by social media companies in a heartbeat with one tap

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560
Is it their fault?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.240
Is it the social media companies fault

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.760
If you were given the attention of literally millions of humans, what would you do with it?

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.320
Find a way to monetize it or use it to make it a better world

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.480
There is a group of controllers ladies and gentlemen that has a plan of inverting national sovereignty

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.000
into a global system of governance. It's based on

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.480
climate change

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.040
based on vaccination and public health

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and based on the mythology

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.480
of this ever

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.400
increasing

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.480
biotechnology space

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.560
That Robert Malone and his wife would like to be the disambiguation wizard in which of

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.960
for all eternity

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.600
Or at least in the foreseeable future

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.520
And I believe that they're taking that role very disingenuously very disingenuously

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.800
They're not just humble horse farmers

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.720
Like putting on funny uniforms and galloping around

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.640
There's something else going on here, and I don't know what it is

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.920
But I think we are would be very very wise

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.480
Not to trust this man and rude to realize that he is part of a network of people

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.880
who has been reassuring and and

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.440
assuring

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.440
That this narrative of a novel virus that we had to do something that the mRNA saved a lot of people for

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.680
And that the virus could come again because this might again been gain a function this whole narrative

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.600
Has been succinctly carefully constructed from the very beginning

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.880
And the already pre divided pre fractionated United States

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.640
and UK whole western society

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.440
was used

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.280
very cleverly

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.600
And the people on the left all around on all throughout the west

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.160
We're also on the side of lab leak or natural virus

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.440
and all the people in the conservative wings

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:13.520
of both

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.800
Europe and the united states and in japan

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.160
We're all on the lab leak side

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.280
as if that even made any sense

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.920
As if your stance on abortion or gay marriage would have any

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.840
Bearing on whether you thought this could be a natural virus or a lab leak

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640
It should have had much more to do whether you saw

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.600
the peter day sack 60 minutes

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.320
When it came out or not

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.960
It should have had a lot more to do is whether you read nathan wolf's book or saw his ted talk or not

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.400
It shouldn't have been whether or not you like trump. It shouldn't have been whether you're a whole

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.440
and

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.440
Now you see how they did it

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.120
And what robert melon is is slapping them with again

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.880
Making sure that that firm divide that everybody's got in their gut

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.080
Never heals

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.760
Don't let that close up

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:17.200
Make sure that that's contiguous with the rest of this narrative that twist in your gut that rip

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.480
Where you either believe that trump's a good guy and got the short end of the stick

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:29.600
Or you think he's the worst example of an american and you have no idea how he cheated his way in but it must have been the russians

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.600
That divide in america was so

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.880
so beautifully used

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.920
And seated

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:46.960
So that everybody on one side of that divide thought natural virus and one side of that divide thought lab leak one side of that virus

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.440
Take the shots and give me more. I don't care if it's hot dog juice

01:08:53.120 --> 01:09:00.480
And then this side said oh, I don't know. I mean, I'm gonna wait for a second. I mean come on. It's you know, they haven't tested it

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.000
We've got to see this for what it is now ladies and gentlemen, we can we have a chance

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.200
We have a chance because there's about a year before this

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.880
Train comes into the station that it's supposed to stop at

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.760
And I have a feeling that some of the people on the train don't have an intention to have the train stop in a year

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:33.360
And so I really need everybody to get excited about what we're going to do over the next six to nine months as we spread this information around

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
in simple graphic form

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.520
There's a new war out there

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.120
People are putting little tiny graphic sheets out there trying to teach everybody the basics

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.800
But of course they're putting little graphic sheets out there of uh, basic bs

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320
So giggle and biological has work to do

01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.440
And so what we did in the book is we went back to the original political science definitions of fascism

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.640
And the work of bonito mouselini early on

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.080
In which he said fascism should really more appropriately be called corporatism

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:18.560
It's the logic that the large corporations are much more capable of governing us than we are of governing ourselves

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.080
Okay, that's that is what's being advanced. So corporatism is a is a partnership of government and corporations

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.960
When you hear public private partnership

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.600
That's a euphemism for corporatism and corporatism is

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:40.640
Fascism as defined by bonito mouselini although fascism often has an element of violence to it. I think that um

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:48.240
And we've heard all this discussion that fascism, you know, you go fascism nazi anti-semitism

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:57.920
Etc the neo-Nazis all of that is garbage. It's it's an overlay that's been created by the media to try to weaponize that

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.400
We're just like they've weaponized the term

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.280
Anti-vaxxer and so many other of our language elements

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360
They have basically subverted them

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.600
Change the meaning and weaponize them against us another one you hear in europe all the time is far right

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.720
In europe right now if you do not want open borders you're far right

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.880
um

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.760
You know the un in their agenda 2030 has in there that migration is

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:32.240
A universal right and that every country has to allow migrants in this hat

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.120
This must be something that you guys are sensitive to given where you live right now and close to the border, right?

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.160
And and the new the change that's happened today

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.680
Um with the title expiring 42. Yeah

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.480
Uh

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.480
Jill's Jill's emphasizing

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.280
That in agenda 2030 it's defined that it is a human right and we've signed off on this by the way

01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:02.480
In 2016 with as long as they already passed tense guys the the boat left the dog and and agenda 2030 by the way was signed

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.880
By the united states by the president of the united states as an agreement

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.280
But in fact if you go over to the un and you read it, it's actually a treaty and it is binding

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.280
but

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.440
US executive office has been doing this thing for the last 20 years slight of hand where we've not

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:27.200
Bypass the senate senate has to ratify any treaty by treaty by two-thirds of a majority

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.800
And they have not done that now. They just say it's an agreement and they sign

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:38.480
So this is those presidential agreements are legally binding right right so they are functionally treaties without calling them treaties

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.560
So they don't have to get the senate to ratify them

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.960
And they they have signed off on agenda 2030 and as the sheriff probably knows agenda 2030

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840
includes the

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.160
Component that it is a basic human right to migrate to live wherever you want to live

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.000
And so in having the open border policy

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:04.000
What they're doing is implementing agenda 2030 here in the united states and by the way all through europe

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:12.240
And the budget reconciliation act that was passed last year that big one if you take that and agenda 2030 you will find that they dovetail

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.000
legislatively

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.040
So it's happening here. We're just not getting told about it. It's not conspiracy crazy talk

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.960
We don't go there. Okay, if we can't like for instance, there's a whole group of people that are mad as hell at us

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.440
Because we won't endorse the idea that these were kill shots

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.360
And the jabs i'm talking about and they were engineered

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.360
For depopulation and eugenics. Okay, that's that's a whole theory and a lot of people subscribe to it

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.480
We don't go there because we say show us the data. Yeah, show me the artifacts show me

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040
You can absolutely see that

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.240
Is not conspiracy crazy talk. We don't go there. Okay, if we can't like for instance

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.200
There's a whole group of people that are mad as hell at us

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.680
Because we won't endorse the idea that these were kill shots

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.680
And the jabs i'm talking about and they were engineered

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.600
For depopulation and eugenics. Okay, that's that's a whole theory and a lot of people subscribe to it

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.320
We don't go there because we say show us the data. Yeah, show me the artifacts

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.560
Show me like you can absolutely see where cloud schwaft how about where

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.200
You would know that transfection in healthy humans would be dumb

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.880
How about that part?

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.800
How about the part where you knew that multiple transfections to any protein never mind

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.680
possibly a viral protein

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.440
Kodan optimized and pseudo-uridine modified

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.280
I don't know. It's pretty easy for me to come up with a reason why you would say that show me the data

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240
You need data?

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.720
I don't think I need any data to know that transfecting kids would be dumb

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.520
I don't need data and I don't think he needed data either. I think this is him again. Just

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.080
basically lying

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.400
Because if he can say this as the maker or the inventor

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.360
I mean think about how crazy this is. Okay, why if he invented this

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.000
23 years before the start of the pandemic if he invented it 23 years ago

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:30.080
And it was 100% safe and great that you could use it on billions of people

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.080
Why in the hell hadn't been used on anybody except for people who were dying of cancer

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.520
before the pandemic

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.400
Why hadn't had been used for anything except for people who were dying

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.480
Why wasn't it useful for something

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.280
And how could it suddenly become so universally useful that billions of people perhaps millions of children

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.160
Could be given this therapeutic

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.200
What had changed about it?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:11.440
Did he really believe that the codon optimization or the chemical modification to pseudo uridine would actually make it safe

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:19.280
Beyond what he as a as a lowly postdoc said was certainly the immune response way back when

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.520
This is so frustrating because

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.880
Really somebody should be in the in the audience to heckle him

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:31.680
That's bullshit. You knew it's just transfection

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040
What makes it better?

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:44.400
I mean in some respects you could say that putting the original viral sequence would have been the best thing because then you'd most

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040
that the highest chance

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.120
of getting a

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.320
Reasonably well folded tertiary structure on this protein

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.800
I

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.840
Mean ladies and gentlemen, do you understand how?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.120
How disturbing this is? I mean keep in mind look look look look

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.400
Let's just I don't know. I guess I'm not gonna make it. So I'm gonna keep going

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.440
And just screw this

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.120
Let's go spike protein 3d crystal

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.320
I

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.640
Can we find this crystal structure of the spike protein

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.720
You've seen a lot of crystal structures of the spike protein. I'm sure you've seen them

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360
I've sure you've seen them

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.640
And these pictures that they show

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320
Right

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.400
Let's just move this over here for a second pictures that they show

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.240
Like this one here

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.040
This picture is based on a computer model

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.960
This picture is based on a computer model

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:27.840
The epitopes that that one might choose are based on how this protein is folded

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.760
And we don't know how this protein is folded. We have computer models

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:39.680
And we know that if you choose change the amino acid sequence here to code out optimize it

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.000
You still will change the way that this is folded, but we don't know how

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:50.880
And we know for sure that if you chemically alter the urad the uracils to make them pseudo urad

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.760
You'll also change this three-dimensional structure, but we don't know how

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.800
And so all this certain talk it drives me crazy

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.800
Because what they're covering up for is that this was known if you transfected people you would give them

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.800
endo red

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.800
endoplasmic reticulum stress

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:23.440
Endoplasmic reticulum is the organelle in the cell where all the ribosomes sit

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.080
if that organelle is stressed

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.040
And stressed means molecular stress. It means

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880
It means free radicals around

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.120
Then the protein folding doesn't go as well then the protein translation doesn't go as well

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.040
It's not as high fidelity and also that it if the folding is not so great

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
And

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.480
So these things are all real they're all real and they all come from

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.160
Over expression of a protein driven by foreign RNA

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.520
It's just not a system that you can overdrive proteins on without

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.720
permanently disregulating it

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.920
It's not like you're just adding a few

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.560
songs to a jute box

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.440
And then they go into the rotation

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.160
You are looking at a carefully orchestrated cell

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.520
You know with a exact amount of

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:29.520
RNA where it needs to be being digested at exactly the right speed and then replaced at exactly the right speed and now here's

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.720
Millions of copies of a foreign RNA

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.840
A very foreign RNA millions of copies of it

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.960
with a

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.440
preponderance of

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.440
pseudo-uridine so your

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:50.080
Your your enzymes that would normally you know regulate its presence are kind of turned off by it or something

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.080
I don't know what's going to happen to it

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.520
But the point is is that in all of that

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.560
Regular RNA in that cell is now all

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.240
dysregulated because the ribosomes are completely occupied by this flood of incoming RNA

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040
And

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:15.280
So no matter what tissue it's done to the tissue will inevitably have a combination of toxicity from the overexpression of the foreign protein or proteins

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.680
toxicity from the presence of the RNA possibly toxicity from the lip and nanoparticle

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:31.440
And eventually an immune response in that responds to the presentation of these proteins on mhc1

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.560
On the outside and not being recognized by natural killer cells not being recognized by cytotoxic T cells

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.680
But mostly natural killer cells excuse me because that would be

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.000
the protein

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
not being recognized

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.040
And then you have cell death then you need neutrophils to mop it up then you need a immune response

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.800
So he could have known because it's transfection he could have known because he knows how it works

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.840
Could have known because he has all the patents he could have known because he's the one who decided that this

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.360
This technology wasn't really worth pursuing

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880
He said it in interviews before

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.680
And yet here he is in 2023 painting it as if he had you know, I don't know, I didn't know any more than you did

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.640
I didn't know who did this. How can I possibly know who did it?

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:27.680
Well, Robert if an ovio would have gotten the contract who would have who would have done it

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.520
So

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:37.520
Talks about the need for prediction and population where bill gates talks about the need for production and population

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:44.080
But I haven't seen the artifacts in which bill gates says we're going to engineer a bioweapon

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:51.840
mRNA based jab in order to compromise fertility by the way they do compromise fertility and men and women

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.200
To kill old people and to kill and to kill old people

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.280
Because we want to reduce the stress on the social security system

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:06.320
I mean you can weave all kinds of stories, but you were in you were in Hawaii in 2021 telling them to

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960
inoculate the old people

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.080
So if it was a plan to kill the old people

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.720
I mean, what are you talking about Robert? But agenda 2030 is real

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.640
Okay, it is a real document. You can go find it

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:27.760
You can read it and you can see how far away is this from saying that the UN is going to take over the United States

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
And there's nothing you can do about it

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:37.840
I'm here to tell you that the UN is going to take over the United States and there's nothing you can do about it because fifth generation warfare has no heads

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.960
You can't see who's doing it

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.080
I mean, that's exactly what they're saying here

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040
That's what they've sold us in May

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.280
2023 it's fifth generation warfare. I'm going to speak about it tomorrow

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.880
But I spoke about it in in Stockholm, Sweden a year ago

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.080
You can't figure out who this is

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.320
That's the definition of fifth generation warfare. You can't stop it

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.520
And so the UN is going to take over agenda 30 2030 is real

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.760
And the melons are here to help you accept it

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.600
And to fight on your behalf

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
to fight on your behalf

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.480
Either a lot of the stuff that you're objecting to I suspect if you're since you're here

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.520
Um is real. Okay, and just to say

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.000
And that this is a created virus is absolutely real that document is clear

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Um

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.560
So one of the lovely things about being

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.560
Read it and you can see that a lot of the stuff that you're objecting to I suspect if you're since you're here

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.040
Um is real. Okay

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:56.160
And just to say gain a function and that this is a created virus is absolutely real that document is clear

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:04.240
Yeah, so one of the lovely things about being I mean there's some serious downsides to be so close to dc

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.920
Which is the trapping but you guys aren't immune to that either

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.400
Um, but uh the culture of dc is deeply corrupted. I mean people people ask me

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.080
Oh, don't you want to be involved in this administration or that administration take this business and I'm like hell no

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:27.360
I don't want to live in dc. I have been there done that. I know what that culture is all about. It will rot your soul

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.040
Um, I absolutely want nothing to do with it

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.280
But one of the good things about being there is we do hear an awful lot

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:40.720
We're surrounded by some of the top conservative leaders in the united states

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.520
Live in rapahannic county. Basically. They're all expats from dc in northern, virginia

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.560
on their farms and

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.240
So we get brought into those circles when we get to hear stuff, which is kind of nice

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:59.600
Yeah, and just to say talking about the foyer documents how we know it is gain a function research is because of tomfenton

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.920
And judicial watch and he is amazing and we all need to support that organization. Yeah

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.960
Um, so we're members of the council for national policy. We'll be there in a couple of weeks

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.360
Um, which tom is basically running current. No, well, he's not running but he's a big part of yeah, um

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:25.840
So, uh, so that's all real the great reset is not a fabricated conspiracy theory

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.120
You can buy claus Schwab's book. You can buy his book of a great narrative

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.080
that kind of carries that on further

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:38.480
And just to hope i'm not saying things you all already know

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.760
Um claus Schwab was not the guy that actually first announced the great reset

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.760
Um, it was the current mark of great brit

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.760
Okay

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.160
He was the one that really first came out with the whole logic of the great reset

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.720
He is totally in with the world economic forum

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.840
I don't know what's going to happen to gree brit now one of the things that he wanted when I was I was on um

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.040
Uh a great gb news the other day with niel all of her for the coronation day

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.960
Um, he's asking for the fealty of of the british public

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.080
Um that was taken out finally in the end

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.320
Yeah, but

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:22.880
So we're I don't I don't really know who's behind all this we've we've got various theories

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.560
Is it the cia is at the dot is at the wef is it?

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.840
pharma and weaponizing all of the above is at the bank of international settlements and all the world banks

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:37.360
I mean, it's the is it the creature from jekyll island? We would but but to go back but to go back

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.680
You got to read the book

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.240
So so one of our little red-pilled stories was in

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.160
2014 there was a significant outbreak of abola

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.000
And we were involved in so I want you to see how how impressive it is that really

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.080
I really think that you can see where we are. I don't know how much more we're going to have to study them

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.760
Because I think the controllers have realized

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.960
That you can announce everything

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.680
You can tell people to read

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.680
At this stage

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.880
I think it would be totally okay for me or robber melon to recommend tragedy and hope

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.680
as we required reading for everyone

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.960
So that you just know what's going on

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.840
So that you can finally accept how you're being governed

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:36.080
And the bottom line is is that there's nothing in this book about viruses

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.760
And so there's no reason why you can't tell people to read it

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.200
There's nothing in this book about pandemics

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.800
Nothing in this book about mRNA or about transfection or transformation

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.080
Only thing that's in this book is that you should accept the idea that there are smart people

01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:01.120
Who if given the reins of civilization could take us places which we would never take ourselves on our own

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.320
And that's really the story that robber melon wants to be a part of because he sees himself as worthy

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.880
Of being on that cloud of people that's governing

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.680
the ants below

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.880
That's what this is all about. These are people auditioning

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.840
That's right

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.840
These people are auditioning

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.320
That's why the current

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.960
Stock of presidential candidates is such a joke

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.680
Because these people are auditioning

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.800
They want to be a part of the show

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.000
And they're kind of in the audience, but maybe they're

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.920
You know just right in the front row or right on the edges or you know

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.040
They got on the steps that leads up to the

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.880
the places where the curtain rods and the and the ropes are

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:55.040
And so they're begging to be led on as an extra just give me a chance. I won't screw it up. I promise

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.040
And so they're basically allowed to say whatever you want. He's talking about the

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.960
The monster at jekyll island or whatever. That's a great story

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.680
It's a real story

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.320
By a real american hero

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.120
Edward griffin

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.600
Just like this is a real american story by a real american hero carol quickly

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.440
And everybody should read it. It's not light reading

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.240
And if I have to be honest with you, I've only read about one third of it because I read

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.400
A good chunk and then I stop for a while and I usually start somewhere else

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.040
At some point I'll start at the beginning. I did once

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.960
But it's an extraordinary tomb

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.920
Of information

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.440
That all you need to do is look into what you want to find in it and usually there's a reference for it

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.240
Usually it's part of the story because this is really a big story

01:30:53.840 --> 01:31:00.000
It's for all the marbles ladies and gentlemen believe it or not. We live in the most interesting time in human history

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:06.640
And I don't think that rober melon is the most interesting man in human history

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.440
But I do believe that everyone that's currently alive and in the play

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.160
is part of

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.240
the most interesting time in human history

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.000
And so pad yourself on the back for being awake

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.960
Pad yourself on the back for being present

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:28.960
In the automobile and not distracted by the really nice leather seats

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.560
Or the

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.560
unbelievably nice stereo system

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.880
Or the walnut lined

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.880
You know dashboard

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.520
You've been looking out the window and you've seen the poverty you've seen the homeless people

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.640
You've seen how bad the road is despite how nice the the shocks are

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.520
You've seen the pollution you've seen the lies

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.040
That's the biggest part is to see the lies

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.120
And that's what we see here

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.760
We see people who purport

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.640
To be seeing through it purport

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.720
To be leading these people through it by dropping these little hints. Yeah, like oh, you know

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.280
retreadgity and hope

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.360
Part of the reason why you can say retreadgity and hope is because nobody can get it

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.080
You want to copy like this one and it'll cost you 500 bucks

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:31.920
And my guess is is the ones that are normal priced are probably edited or something's taken out of them

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.200
I've always meant to buy one just to see but then what am I going to do that?

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.000
It's for all the marbles ladies and gentlemen it is for all the marbles

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.800
So these people are spectacularly committed to the lies

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.080
Finding and bringing helping to bring a vaccine now, you know abola in that outbreak

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.360
Was not a respiratory virus, which is what everybody was scared of that it had gone respiratory

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.720
I once got a call from a buddy who just come out of a pentagon briefing

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.160
As I was going to art my client new link who had the vaccine candidate from Canada

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.800
That eventually became the murk vaccine he calls me up

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.840
I pull off the side of the road pick the cell and he says robert

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.000
You have got to get this thing spun up because I've just come out of a secret meeting in the pentagon

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.760
And we have a scenario if this thing goes aerosol

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.640
We are going to have a billion dead in the united states every in the world

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.840
A billion dead in the world so so so for us when there's

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:32.400
A highly lethal respiratory virus, which hasn't come along probably in our lifetimes really

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.280
A vaccine is this was not

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.000
We have always thought that a vaccine would be an option

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.120
But the problem is is you cannot make a vaccine in time

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.480
Okay, you just can't you cannot make a safe and effective vaccine. So let me let me go through so in abola

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:53.360
Um, there was already health can had already made a vaccine and they actually had clinical stockpiles

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:59.680
And so it was just a question of getting the clinical trials run reducing the dose finding funding

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.840
Which we helped with but we came away going

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.000
You know, this is still going to take five years and this product has already developed

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.360
How could this ever help in a highly lethal situation?

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.200
So when zika came along

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.440
We completely changed our thinking and we thought what we need to do is find repurposed drugs that can be

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:20.800
Against the respiratory virus. So in 2016 we started working on repurposed drugs

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.920
Mosquito board virus. It was a mosquito board virus. That's right. But um

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.040
But again, we had

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.760
Absolutely, you know almost no interest from nih

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:36.960
Um hhs, we had some interest for the dod in trying to find something we again voluntarily

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.600
I don't understand. Is that what they do? They force farm and whenever they get a phone call

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.000
They start looking for stuff to cure diseases

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.680
I don't really get it

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.160
They didn't have any money

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.520
Somebody needed to donate money and before that they couldn't really fight

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.880
Or they were using their own money, but they make it like they don't have any money

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.240
But what do they do?

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:10.400
What are they doing if they're ready to respond to world diseases all the time? What do they actually do? What is their job?

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760
He's a consultant

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760
I

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.520
Consultant for everybody for anybody

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:27.840
Probably on intellectual property a lot

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.280
Really, you know wrote papers and and we were all in. I mean we we you know

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.680
Ivermectin and hydroxychloricone were two of the drugs, but just to say it

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640
Over over covid

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.280
What's been weaponized is those two drugs, but there's about 20 drugs that you can use in covid

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.760
It's not just it's a multi drug therapy and um and it works

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.400
So so we were all in and then we were further red-pilled against

01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:01.360
Childhood vaccines when robert was asked to be an expert witness for did you ever think you'd say why I'd rather let us listen to whitney web

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.160
Holy cow for a large

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.120
um

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.200
Was a blue core case that we can't talk about but when he saw the date he was like

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.720
Oh my gosh, and so that's was that ended in 2019 and then covid hit

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:20.640
And we went all in on repurposed drugs and we could not believe we could not understand the government

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.640
We we still we still can't understand who the puppet master is who?

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.680
So we said because I like working with the dod more than hhs because dod personnel historically

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:35.600
I mean everybody's got their biases about how wicked the dod is

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.080
um, but the truth is

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.080
the dod bio threat

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.640
Was run by fauci

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.640
Yeah, um, so

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:51.680
My experience with working with the dod is they tend to be not very interested in high profile academic

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
publications and getting the nobel prize

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.160
Um and building their careers there

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:03.040
But he said in that control interview that he was working for the dod and he liked working for the dod because they could just do stuff

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.320
what

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320
What is going on here?

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.160
Don't you see this is a medler

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:13.680
And that should concern us

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:16.480
Because his his fingers are in every

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.520
Every freedom group

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.240
Every freedom movement every freedom conference that'll have him he's there

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120
But he's clearly a liar

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.320
He's not a man of integrity. He's a liar

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.080
And so what are we doing?

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.960
Why aren't we calling this man out? Why aren't we saying that, you know, he's a liar though?

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.120
Because now he says he didn't work for the dod, but when he was on paul cotrell's stream

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.520
With a soon to be january sixth fugitive

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.800
I mean you gotta be kidding me

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.240
Or was it after he was a january sixth fugitive? I don't know holy man. This is ridiculous

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:07.840
You're interested in deploying stuff that works for the warfighter

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.960
Okay, and so I really I've always preferred to work with dod because they're very results oriented frankly

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:18.960
Now i'm getting attacked all the time because I have this history of working with the dod

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.240
Oh, there you go. Do it and why I did it in the past now

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.160
They don't want to talk to me because I'm kind of out of them and we talked about all these problems, but um the

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.040
Logic of repurposing drugs

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.920
I'm sure that's how it works. I'm sure you can just out the dod and they don't do anything. I'm sure they can bet that's how that works

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.880
I'm sure that's how that works. He has absolutely no commercial interest

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.600
They that that there is that was our takeaway from zika. We created a company

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:58.400
Tried to get it capitalized. We had multiple patents filed for repurposed drugs for use for zika

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:06.160
We had fantastic data and we could get no so what is the what does it mean when you file a patent for the use of repurposed drugs

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.640
Are you telling me and I think I smell something very stinky here

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.760
Are you telling me

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.640
That you can take a combination of repurposed drugs and patent it

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.400
Like for example, you take a if you take

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:28.800
Hydroxychloroquine and you combine it with ivermectin could you make that into a patented drug?

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.000
Because if you can that is some serious

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.720
I think you can do that and I think that's what he's talking about and I think that's a

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.840
That's a that's a new stone unturned

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:51.360
Of the absolute bullshit storm that this is I'm going to rewind it absolutely no commercial interest

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.000
They that that there is that was our takeaway from zika. We created a company

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.800
Tried to get it capitalized. We had multiple patents filed for repurposed drugs for use for zika

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:10.320
We had fantastic data and we could get no funding there is no interest

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.960
in commercial development of existing off patent drugs

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.840
All this gibber jabber about oh, we're doing this all for humanity and venture philanthropy and all that

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:30.560
They they don't care. They it's absolutely true that they want stuff that they could patent and they can make a mountain of money on

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:38.400
And that includes that includes the nyad researchers who if they have a patent under the bidol act

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:44.160
Which was passed in 1980 the inventors get about 40 of the profit

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.640
So all of the government employees

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.560
And so now keep in mind and this has been pointed out to me recently

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:57.440
But the patents that robert melon held on the frna technology or his names appear on

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.360
Expired like this year or last year

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.320
And so when he originally came on the scene

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360
in his desperate

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.640
Claim for you know, it's a little credit over here

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.480
That came at a time when the patent still kind of existed

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.840
and still were kind of in play

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.120
And now that they're not in play it seems like his story has changed a little bit

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.000
Now it's kind of slimy with people who want patents people aren't even really interested in patents

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.840
And they're not really interested in repurposed drugs unless they can patent them

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.000
But when I came out two years ago was all about my eight patents

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.480
And how my patents mean that I was on the way I did it

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.120
It's my technology that's saving millions of people around the world. That's what Jill said

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:54.320
But now people are not interested unless they can have a patent, but I have the patents patents patents

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:59.200
Who are on a patent for MacDurna or Pfizer, you know, they're probably almost billionaires

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.120
He used to be that the government employees were prohibited from this

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:09.120
So the the logic was to incentivize academics and academic institutions like the University of California

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.080
Which has a huge alameda based patent office

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:18.000
To go ahead and pursue intellectual property because all this IP was being generated within the universities

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.160
And it wasn't going anywhere because nobody cared because they couldn't make money off of it

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.840
And they put the bidol act in place and they put these incentives

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:32.400
So that the dean of uc san diego or or you know this investigator or that department chair

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.360
Gets to make a ton of money on patent

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.520
I don't see he's a tonic live in the chat anymore. Maybe he's having a

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.560
Having a good date night royalty revenue if something gets invented within

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.440
That um organization or in within one of their laboratories. What's this is done?

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.880
Is it's transformed academia into basically an arm of the pharmaceutical industry

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:02.240
And it's and it's motivated all of these investigators to be basically chasing patents and chasing revenue

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.800
Associated with working with pharma. That's part of why you a lot of us have been perplexed

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:12.720
What happened to academe through this last three years through the covid crisis?

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.720
How do they all become so corrupted?

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:21.680
It's I mean, it's very easy to consider the possibility that rubber melon just didn't want to be left behind the train of of of history

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.560
And that as he saw the mr&a gets sucked up into the machine and realize what they were going to do and how

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:31.280
Willing they were to

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.520
To push it to billions of of arms

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.560
He realized well if they're going to do it, then I better raise my hand now and say it's I was part of this or i'll never be able to say it

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:43.200
And

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.560
At the time that it was coming out and the hype that it was getting on tv you could imagine a scenario where you would be like

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.560
Well, I guess I better say something

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.800
And so it's starting to look to me a lot more like these are two pretty ordinary people

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.200
Pretty ordinary people with ordinary means

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.080
being sucked into doing something that

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.280
Is serving a lot of other people more than it serves them which doesn't make them great

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040
But it doesn't make them masterminds either

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.360
It's something here to be pitied

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.480
There's something to hear to be ashamed of

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.480
There's something here to shake your head at but not necessarily to shiver and fear from

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.360
Definitely

01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.440
Something to be annoyed by because

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:38.080
They're not really

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080
The people that they report to be

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640
That much is very certain to me

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.920
Going on for a long time. It's just that it's now been revealed

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.400
Okay, and and it didn't used to extend to the guvies

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.160
But now the government workers have that same deal

01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.960
Which is why tony fauci is sitting on a mountain of cash right now

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.520
Not just making more in salary

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.200
He makes more in retirement if he didn't know this he makes more in retirement in his annual salary

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.120
Then the president makes for the active sitting president

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.440
Okay, it's stunning and that doesn't include his royalty revenue

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:24.800
Okay, he is sitting on a mountain of cash and by the way, they've hired him back as a consultant and given him six

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:29.440
FTE six full-time employees as security and drivers

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:36.480
Okay, so he's driven around dc in in his nice bulletproof SUV at the expense of you guys

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.880
Um currently, you know, it's it's not a private party really. He's just another

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.320
Gubby that's just retired and then come back to double dip

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:55.040
So that's that's the world of dc and but there's another there's another point to that though and that is it's a little off topic and that is

01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.360
um

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.000
Agenda f I do any of you know about this right?

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:02.400
Trump schedule up schedule up

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800
So another thing we talked about in the book

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:11.440
Yeah, that's third where we talk about what can we do about this? So, um, we have an executive

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.600
I'm sorry. What is it senior executive service senior executive service that cannot

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:22.880
In the federal government so you can fire them when you hear steve ban and talk about the administrative state

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.240
This is this group of employees and they're large

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.360
It's a couple of thousands of people. They actually have their own flag

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.280
Yeah, okay. The senior executive service has its own flag at its own badge

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.160
Do you hear this? Are you hearing it senior executive service that thing that like

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.480
Did like john karaoke told me was nothing was a joke was a nothing burger

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.160
That actually I think we also talked about it with regular guy

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:54.560
And that it was a nothing burger like these people can definitely be fired. It's absurd

01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:00.720
Like they can definitely be fired because they even have a limited car. It's a ridiculous statement

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.520
And they said millions of them

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.760
Did you hear it?

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:13.440
Yeah, and they cannot be fired and so what can we do about this? So, um, we have an executive

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:19.600
I'm sorry. What is it senior executive service senior executive service that cannot be fired in the federal government

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:26.720
So you may not when you hear steve ban and talk about the administrative president can't fire a janitor either

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:31.120
What is he taught? What is this? This is this group of employees and they're large

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.360
Couple of thousands of people they actually have their own flag a couple million

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.960
Then robert malonkorexer and says it's thousands flag

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.840
Yeah, okay. The senior executive service has its own flag at its own badge. Yeah. Yeah, and employees and they're large

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:51.040
Couple of thousands of people they actually have their own flag

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.960
Yeah, okay. The senior executive service has its own flag at its own badge

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:55.840
Yeah

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.760
And they cannot be fired and this this started historically with president mckinley who was

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.000
assassinated and um

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.960
It was assassinated because somebody that worked on his campaign thought he president mckinley it all started with president mckinley

01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:16.000
It all started with president mckinley. Did you hear that mark?

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.880
Oh my god

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.480
Arch it's a couple of thousands of people. They actually have their own flag

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:29.280
Yeah, okay. The senior executive service has its own flag at its own badge. Yeah, and they cannot be fired

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.240
And this this started historically with president mckinley who was assassinated

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.880
and um

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:38.880
Somebody

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.680
Was going to get an appointment because he worked on the campaign

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.520
Stop lying

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:49.440
Assassin senior executive service has its stop lying. Yeah, yeah, and they cannot be fired

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:54.480
And this this started historically with president mckinley who was assassinated

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.600
And um

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.920
It was assassinated because somebody that worked on his campaign thought he was going to get an appointment because he worked on the campaign

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.440
Mckinley didn't give an appointment and so the guy shot him

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.360
And so after that after set the federal government said we need

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:14.880
Protection so if the president and the vice president all get killed at the same time that there's continuity

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.280
government

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:22.080
So we'll make a class of employees that can't the reason why that's strange is because Charles rixie's great great grandfather

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.320
Was the doctor of president mckinley?

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.880
That's weird

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.080
That's super weird

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.640
Be fired so that they'll give continuity

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:42.880
Well, what's happened over time is basically they can do whatever they want they can interpret laws however they want

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.080
They run the government. They run the government. Congress does not run the government

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.600
The president does not run the government the senior executive service runs again

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.480
Yeah, so so trump tried to fire a lot of people and he couldn't

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.840
Pissed him off. I know I look like beaker from the from the muppets when i'm staring at them like that

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.240
It takes two years

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.800
To fire a federal employee of constant dogged fighting in the courts, right?

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:11.440
So so he he came up with schedule f which would reclass all these federal employees as at will put employees

01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:14.960
which anybody who works is probably an at will employee and um

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.680
It was one of his last acts

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.320
And the press in dc went wild about it

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:25.200
How it was gonna and it took him months and months and months to fight off and get it through the court

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.320
Get it through the courts and then it was finally gonna prove

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:34.240
It was the first just before the election right and then he lost and then it was the first thing that Biden got rid of soon as he was

01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:42.560
Lidgis robermalone off-screws ended schedule left. Yeah. Yeah, so one of the things we absolutely worst camera man

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.800
just

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:51.620
As far as i'm concerned the top priority right now is we have to make it illegal for the government to deploy

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:55.280
psychological operations on civilians

01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:02.560
Um, here's but another one we've got to do is we have to find some way whether mr

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:03.680
Trump is in the office

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:08.240
Isn't he going to put himself out of business if he advocates for the government to not be able to do

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.880
psyops

01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:14.160
Or mr. Santas or whomever or maybe body units

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:16.640
um, but

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.040
We have got to find a way to break the back of the administrative state and we have got to break the back of this

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.240
um

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:30.080
New censorship industrial complex and I don't know quite how we're going to do it

01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:37.280
But I know we absolutely have to do it that this this censorship industrial complex is a monster

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:41.920
And here's the thing in the technology that's been developed

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:46.240
Where you ever notice in you know in marketing?

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.760
This is really an extension of marketing into warfare

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.760
Okay, when they sell you hamburgers, they have and soap suds and all those things

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.720
They're really sophisticated about how they do it

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.960
They know all kinds of subliminal messaging and other technologies color use of color use of sex

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:14.240
All kinds of things repetitive repetitive is really important repetitive insertion of key words into advertising and into the press and all kinds of things

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.840
It's amazing how suggestible you are here's a fun fact

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:26.720
25% of people this has been known for decades 25% of people in anyone population is highly resistant to hypnosis

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:34.880
Into syops about 25% yay, probably a large fraction of use that you're here are in that 25%

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:41.520
Okay, the other 75% are very susceptible. They can be hypnotized

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:46.000
They can be influenced to act in whatever way somebody wants to

01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:52.320
The other day I was on with Neil Oliver as I mentioned we were it's the coronation day when we were talking about this

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:56.800
And um in Great Britain they actually have a censorship board just to let you know

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:59.120
We'll come here soon enough

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:03.600
They have a censorship board and I can tell you Great Britain news is scared silly

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.640
Of that censorship board. I was told that I could not talk about anything about the vaccines

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.360
What I went on GB news the other day with Neil Oliver that wasn't the case a year ago

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:18.880
Okay, and so we had to kind of talk around it and use euphemisms like JP Sears does

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600
um, but uh

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.120
Nobody said he plugged JP Sears. Why would he plug him?

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:29.520
Why not Joe Rogan or somebody else? Why did that guy immediately come to mind?

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.240
JP Sears is brilliant JP Sears is a brilliant fifth generation warrior

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.560
Okay comedy

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:43.520
And and music and art are incredible fifth generation war tools

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.320
They're incredible propaganda tools that can be used against you or we can use them against them

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:53.200
Okay, and this has long been known what JP does is brilliant

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.880
In terms of psyops, but I made the point with Neil

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.800
Because of course in Britain they have the nudge units

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:05.440
And they have the 77th brigade which has been deployed on their citizens

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:11.120
And in the in in GB news and any of these news stations

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:16.400
Um, they are forced to have someone who represents the other side

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.920
They cannot broadcast unless they have

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.240
Some semblance

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:26.880
Balance where there's somebody that's standing on the other side of an issue advocating for that

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.320
So the person on the other side was making the case that well in a democracy in the UK

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.600
Basically they have an election every four years and the people seed their authority

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.120
To the winning party who is able to act really?

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.080
In an autocratic fashion for the next four years

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:53.200
The people seed their authority to this winning political party that can basically do whatever it wants to do for the next four years

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:56.960
And then there's another election. That's the logic that's promoted in the UK

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.680
Okay, so four-year period no accountability. They can do what they ever they want to do

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.040
My point is if during that four years, they're deploying modern psyops

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:16.560
Psychological warfare technology against the population so that the population is constantly bombarded with corrected information

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.520
Now it's going to be AI filtered information that controls everything that you see feel think believe

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.200
Your emotions, okay, that's what's in play right now if you're in so social media

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.480
You are highly you're in a highly controlled environment

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.600
And everything that you think and believe and feel is being manipulated actively in real time

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:47.040
And if that's pretty truthful, that was pretty good actually saying that that's what social media does to you and if you interact with social media

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.040
That's where you are. That's pretty good

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.800
But he's not telling you that he's part of it

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.720
The government is allowed to do that the concept of sovereignty

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.360
Of personal agency

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:07.520
That you have as an independent being the ability to make an objective decision about right and wrong or what you want in your government

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.440
The policies that you want you no longer have that sovereignty

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.200
Everything that you are thinking is being manipulated using the most

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.640
cutting edge

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.240
Psychological manipulation that's 75% that's susceptible and that's you know when we talk about

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.880
The younger generation they are just being bombarded with this messaging all the time and and they have a hard time filtering

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.080
Every social media channel is basically

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:45.040
An intelligence operation and and combine that with um the garm agreement, which I think has to be mentioned with this which um is the

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.040
um

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:49.040
An agreement. Let's get an example

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:52.080
Conservative media

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:58.480
Now you would think that Mercedes Benz and Porsche would want to sell cars to conservatives

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.240
Okay

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.080
You would think that Steve Bannon would be inundated

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:12.400
With advertisements and the blaze and why do you think Steve Bannon has to advertise t-shirts hats and water and pillows and pillows

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:15.360
Okay, it's not because he doesn't want to sell Mercedes Benz

01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.880
Okay, he is Mercedes Benz is literally

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:22.800
prohibited from advertising on conservative sites

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:25.360
Okay, it started with more

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:33.280
You got it. You got to understand it started with an agreement that um advertisers through google and this huge consortium of

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:37.760
Advertising she has a microphone why is she straining her voice like that?

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.480
Companies all agreed. They wouldn't allow advertising on porn sites

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.400
And then it was violence and then it moved into election misinformation and now it's

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:58.080
Information and now it's basically anything conservative anything conservative and and um they cannot literally if you advertise on a bad site

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:01.680
You can no longer allow to use ad sense and these um

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:09.680
Algorithmic advertisers and if you are an executive at a major us corporation and you donate to conservative causes

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:17.120
That's tracked that's holding think about how all over the place this is think about how wacky of a presentation this is is there

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.680
Was there a specific goal in mind? Did they have a specific goal in mind?

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.360
Did they get up on this screen or this stage with the idea of getting through

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:30.160
A few points and then when they were done

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:36.720
They would be confident that the people in this room are in this this crowd rather understood stuff

01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:42.720
Or is this like an appearance for money

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:48.320
an appearance for donations an appearance for sub stack followers an appearance for

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:51.280
People to believe that these guys are real

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.280
If you were trying to save the world it wouldn't sound like this

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:01.520
I'm telling you if you were trying to save the world it wouldn't sound like this

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.800
No plans of action just telling you the way it is

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.080
No ways out just telling you the way it is

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.200
No solutions

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.880
No alternatives

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.720
No answers

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:22.960
Just telling you how it is. We'll disclose. Okay, and then your esg scores go down when we talk about

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:27.920
When your esg score goes down you cannot get capital

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:31.760
You pay higher rates you're less able to get capital

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:35.600
So this this is integrated at a level if you're not aware of this

01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:42.320
This has been being built for decades and clearly this is what makes us anti government is talking about this stuff

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:47.120
Yeah, this is why i'm i'm defined as anti government by the anti-deformation league

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.600
Which seems to be mostly about defaming

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:57.760
Um, but that's that is what we're up against is an ecosystem in which all advertising dollars

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.120
Are strategically controlled through a blanket agreement that's run through google

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:06.400
Which controls the vast bulk of advertising right now

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:14.480
And when you see that all the media including fox news, which is now the second largest owner of fox news is

02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.200
Blackrock. Okay, it's no surprise that tuckers out

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:27.200
Okay, and um, so that's that's the ecosystem we're dealing with right now is the government feels that it is

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:33.600
Morally obligated in order to protect democracy to bypass the first amendment

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:37.760
And there is nothing that anyone will do about it

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.960
I mean, I keep saying what is the remedy?

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.360
When from the lowest level government official, you know from your school boards all the way up to the potus

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.960
There is tacit agreement that we absolutely must

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.440
Bypass the first amendment. We must control speech

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.840
And a free pass it's not just free speech. It's a free press. Okay. Um, that's that's where we're at

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.640
And the only remedy that I know of is impeachment

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:11.680
And there's no way that we're going to get an impeachment case brought through

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.400
I mean, we've got all this evidence about hunter biden and all of the corruption and all that that's coming out

02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.640
Do you think there's going to be an impeachment?

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:19.840
Hell no

02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:24.320
Okay, there's there's no way that can happen in dc. There's another point

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.800
People ask me oh, is there going to be accountability for what's happened over the last three years?

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:30.960
um

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.320
Can you imagine a world in which the united states suddenly says oh you caught me?

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:43.760
We actually funded the development of that virus that has exterminated a you know a significant fraction of the world's population

02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:46.160
And decimated economies

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:50.720
Can can you imagine what would happen if they owned up to what they've done?

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:54.560
Which the documents from judicial watch and everybody else so many sources now

02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.280
Demonstrate, you know

02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.640
For me one of the shocking things was coming to grips with we not might not be the good guys

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.520
Okay

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.000
And can you imagine what would happen it would destroy the united states?

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
It would destroy it politically it would destroy it economic. We're not the only bad guys

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.320
I mean, that's the truth of it is we have the ccp we have russia. We have the uk

02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.360
I mean

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:24.080
governments throughout the world now believe that they need to control the citizenship and

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:25.760
basically

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.760
treat them like an economic unit and

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.280
So we need to get back to personal sovereignty and and this

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.840
It's really important

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.880
And when when we so podcast different podcasts when people are talking about the book

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:44.080
They're like, well, what's this part about the better future coming?

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:50.240
Right, um, and I insisted that we put that line in because the lies my government told me was such a downer

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.440
Uh, it was came it came. It was it was developed by sky verse publishing

02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.080
Uh, they thought that was the fantastic name that would make it a huge best seller by the way

02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.880
It's not that much of a best seller, but it's doing okay, but it's not like bobby's book

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:10.160
Um, but i'm not bobby kennedy and neither she um, but uh, um

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.240
I really wanted to end on a positive note, but yes

02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:17.280
And the positive note was about what can we do about right?

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.720
And I think the first thing is the first thing we can do about it in our own lives is community

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.360
It's our families our families. Yeah. Yeah

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:28.560
Intentional communities and one of the things you may recall

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.680
When I when I did this little podcast with this guy

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:37.360
Rogan um that kind of did break the internet and caused google to lose its bladder control

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:39.920
um, the the

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.760
I

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.320
Talked about the theories of this friend of mine from belgium named mattias decimate

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:50.720
And I use the term mass formation psychosis now the

02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:57.280
Psychology committee hit us on that even though that's an old term and so we've dropped the psychosis mass formation

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:04.560
But it's basically around the preconditions that enabled this hypnosis or control or thought control of people

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.840
um, and one of the things that we've observed in this

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.480
Bizarre world that we've been traveling for the last three years is communities have faith

02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:23.120
What ever religion have been the most resistant to these psyops?

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:30.480
Like for instance, what's the the town up north that has that church that got hammered so bad that we've spoken at Santa Clara

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.360
Santa Clara. Yeah. I mean, do you know the story of calvary chapel? Yeah, calvary chapel

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.320
um, they they

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:44.000
The stuff that was done. I mean the city council called their

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.320
leanholder

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:47.520
and said

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:49.520
They're going to have to default

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:54.240
on their loan because they were going to get a six million dollar fine

02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:01.600
And so and so the the bank defaulted based on that phone call they they pulled back the loan

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:06.640
I mean, this is how dirty it is and but what they did was is they hung together as a community

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.440
And and they reached out to other members of the calvary chapel world

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.800
Which basically all pulled their money and bought the damn thing

02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:16.400
um

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:23.760
And yeah, yeah, yeah, but amazing story. We when we went and spoke there with Steve Kirsch

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:29.920
Uh, we heard people coming up to us talking about how you know older people disabled people

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:34.400
That weren't wearing masks that were being dragged out of public spaces

02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:36.320
In that county

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.120
Um, because they weren't wearing masks if we now know just I know this is going to shock you

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.760
Masks don't work

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:45.040
Okay

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.440
The data are in that was a lie

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.560
Um, and it's hard to figure out why they propagated that lie

02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:59.600
The only explanation that i've heard and it's actually in the literature by one of the people that was influencing those decisions

02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:04.160
Is that it really was about demonstration of fealty

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:07.600
It was a way to it was not

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:12.960
I argue that a lot of this it was not a demonstration of fealty so much of it

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:16.560
Whereas it was a demonstration of the belief in the mythology

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:21.440
That's what it was

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:24.160
It's a question of do you dare not to wear a mask

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:28.000
Just like on close encounters of the third kind

02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:32.800
How did they convince all those people to clear the western half of Wyoming

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.320
They killed all the animals with a poison and they left them laying in the fields

02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440
And then they said that there was a chemical leak

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:46.160
That a train had wrecked and that everybody had to be evacuated

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:49.840
But of course there was no gas

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:55.600
Of course those people weren't nobody was in danger. Otherwise, why and how come they weren't dying on the way out?

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:57.600
And

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:03.200
That's why they ended up taking their masks off and believing that they could go and then you know

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:07.840
The whole story goes on in that movie because it's the same thing the masks weren't about

02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:10.720
showing fealty

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:18.160
They forced people to accept the existence of a novel virus that these people still accept the existence of

02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.400
And

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:26.960
They're going all the way back to the very beginning of the bamboozlement and they're tasking the wrong questions

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.280
With the wrong answers

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:38.160
Masks don't work. Why don't they work because there wasn't any spread

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:40.160
I

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:50.240
Policy of the jabs in the military and the absolute unwillingness to allow

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.120
religious exemptions

02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:58.400
Was about weeding out the people that weren't going to comply with the things that they are telling them to do

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:02.480
It's been a compliance test. Yeah, and another compliance test is

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:12.000
We get a lot of science conferences a lot of biodefense conferences invites, you know come to this, you know event in DC blah blah blah

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.880
You know all this junk mail we get and and you read these invitations and they all and to this day

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:22.240
They say you need to prove that you're vaccinated before you can go to this scientific event

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:25.280
You know, this is a way it's tribalism

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:31.520
It's a way of weeding out people from being able to get the latest data being able to network

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:35.200
You know, they are trying to harm and

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:39.200
Ostracize. Yes. Yeah. Yeah

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:45.040
So, um getting back to stick together the better times ahead

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.440
um

02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:49.840
People ask what is an intentional community?

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:55.440
Because this is a plan that this is not conspiracy thinking

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.040
I mean

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:03.760
Huxley talked about in my mind what they're laying here is the idea that we should make secret networks of people and ignore everybody else

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:11.920
We shouldn't go for unity. We shouldn't try to unite the country under truth. We shouldn't try to expose the lies

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:17.840
We should just try to network locally and and huddle down

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:24.640
And i'm not sure that this is the right solution again because it accepts the lies

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:30.800
Accept all the lies and now organize and do something else separate from them

02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:34.960
So america is never going to be won again

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.840
And if we accepted that we were all lied to and we've been lied to for a generation

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:44.640
We might be able to become one again

02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:50.720
If we accepted that actually racism isn't that big of a problem relative to effort

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.040
I

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.920
If we accepted that racism isn't that big of a problem with regard to most people's daily lives

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.560
relative to effort

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.560
I think we might get somewhere

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:10.880
But I don't think we're ever going to go there because that's not where the tv people want us to go

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:19.760
They want us to blame everything on the system and everything on climate change and everything on mother nature

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.520
And nothing on our own effort and our own responsibilities

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:28.640
and our own

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.320
energies

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:37.040
What we get out of bed to do doesn't matter because the all the other variables that are out of our control are overwhelming

02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:39.840
That's what they want you to feel

02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.920
Fifth generation warfare is exactly that in a nutshell

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:46.400
And

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.600
If jpc's is a is a good guy and the other guys are bad guys, and what are you gonna do?

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.720
You got to eat

02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.200
I said to instagram video

02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.680
You don't stand a chance

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.680
don't you see

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.760
That's what they want you to believe

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:11.120
So just make a little community and make a little effort to have a little community and don't do anything else

02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:16.400
Don't organize any efforts to fight against the lies that include

02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.240
What these people are telling you about why masks didn't work

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.840
And what masks were really all about

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.960
Wasn't about compliance ladies and gentlemen. It was about accepting the mystery

02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.960
Is was about accepting the scooby-doo of this

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:41.280
There's a great video great new world. Yeah of Huxley in the early 70s

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:44.640
No, it was 1958 with mike wallace early

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:52.400
That's the mike wallace interview. Okay in which he's talking about these things like 25% of the population can't be hypnotized

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.680
And that's and that the fact that 25% of the population can be readily hypnotized look at this one right here

02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:01.120
and

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:04.240
That that's a good thing because governments need to be able to control people

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:12.080
The plans that have been put in place that we have now seen sprung on us have been baked over decades now

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.400
And there is no way that we're getting get out of this in the next two years

02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:20.160
As far as i'm concerned what we're fighting for is our children's future

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:26.000
Yeah, um and it's and it's whether or not we want our children to live as indentured servants

02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:30.320
Or do we want them to live in a free world in which they have personal agency?

02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:33.760
They can make their own decisions make their own mistakes and have to live with them

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:42.640
Okay, is that the world or do we want to live in a command economy that is controlled centrally by a group of corporate oligarchs

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.280
Um out of europe that that is by the way european union

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:52.560
Leadership is not elected. Okay. That's the world. They want us to live under

02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:58.080
When we went to the european parliament just off on that tangent one of the things that was last week last week

02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:04.880
Last week we testified in the european parliament on the invitation about half a dozen members of the epu were the dissenters many of which

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.120
Were representing former uh, soviet union states like romania. Okay, those those folks

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:18.320
Um have lived under communism. They have lived under marxism. They know what it's about and they believe it's coming back

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:23.600
They're personally they're they're pretty far into hell. No, okay, and um

02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:30.400
They're they see it what's happening. But one of the things we learned is those members of the ep they don't do anything

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:33.280
It's even worse than it is here. They don't work

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.120
It's their their aides do all the voting for them

02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.560
One of the things is happening government all over the world in these various administrative states is during covid

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.960
They've all been working from home

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:54.640
They have to be the fda is a ghostland. They only just brought half the employees back to the fda. You go to the parking lot is empty

02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:01.680
Okay, the reason why is so rachel will insky was actually not down in atlanta working at the cdc

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:03.840
She was up at her home and wherever it was kineticate

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:09.200
Where she had that studio that she was giving all those lovely little presentations to all of us

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.840
Um that we all enjoyed so much

02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:14.800
But she wasn't actually

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:19.520
Administering she wasn't actually working there a lot of the government has had a three-year vacation

02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:27.040
And the same is true in the european parliament. Yeah, so this this this we're we're sitting in a situation

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:30.720
In which some small cluster of individuals

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:33.440
That are it's is not

02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:40.480
Conspiracy that are running largely very large corporations or the representatives of very large corporations are

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:42.480
functionally

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.040
I'm controlling most of the but but but just but I want to change this topic just a bit

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.080
Okay, getting back to the better future. So right now

02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:54.160
We have I believe it's 11 million children are being homeschooled

02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:58.000
It's about it's a really interesting dynamic when she's there

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.240
Isn't it that's just a very different Malone speaking when she just cuts him off

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:07.280
And I want to change this subject a little bit about homeschooling and percent of the population in the united states

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:12.640
Okay, this is a big deal our kids were homeschooled. Yeah, but so so homeschooling

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:20.000
It's teaching children how to use the internet not allowing them to use it all the time not allowing them to have cell phones at an early age

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:24.000
It's getting outdoors. I mean, there's a lot of things we can do

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.440
We have to form our own communities and we have to kind of live outside of the government because we don't have any choice

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:36.880
We have to build communities that can perceive you should behave like what the government would call white nationalists

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.600
So that way later on you can be classified as a white nationalist in the terrorist

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:45.040
And so go to gab

02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:52.400
And register with your personal information at gab so that we can put you on that list and follow me over on my group on telegram

02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:55.840
Follow me on that list and then sign up for my sub stack

02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:00.800
So that when the government decides to go and make a list of white nationalists

02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:03.680
We know you're on it

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:08.000
Disced through the storm that is about to hit us. Yes. Yes

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:15.760
And uh, I'm not sure people ask what is an intentional community a monastery is an intentional community and nunnery is an intentional

02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:22.400
Amish or intentional communities traditional religions of faith their intentional communities. We have we have internet

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.120
Lots of examples of intentional communities you can form them around

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:34.560
Love of wineries whatever the thing is. I mean, there's there's a there's a lot of ways to build intentional communities

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.920
And to exist within those and protect each other

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.240
David martin has done a ton of thinking david lives just a few miles from us

02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:46.480
In virginia david lives just a few miles from us mark

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.640
David martin lives just a few miles from us mark. Did you know that?

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:56.960
About this and about the economics of this we have some if you're going to build intentional communities and think about

02:16:57.120 --> 02:16:59.120
This it is a hard problem

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:08.320
Because we're basically how do you imagine a world how far is rixie ville from where robert melon's ranch is this is all a very small

02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:11.200
Geographic region of virginia. It's every existed

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.480
Like for instance, I was down in in mexico city, which is an amazing place

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:21.280
It's like l.a. In mexico city of flip flop. I when I grew up mexico city was

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:23.520
an

02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:29.680
Exhole um and l.a. Was where where all the hip and cool people are now all the hip and cool people are done

02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:37.840
And l.a. Is an armpit camera man. It's an amazing turnaround. So we're down there talking to some folks from latin america

02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:47.440
And um talking about intentional communities and all the problems that you have to solve in order to build an intentional community because you have to you cannot

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.160
exist on barter

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:52.560
Beyond a certain limit

02:17:53.040 --> 02:18:00.000
Which the amish recognized, which is why those communities fissure it. What is it 40 40 families? Okay. Um, so

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:08.080
You can't exist straight on barter especially in a space of modern technology and now we're going to be going to a digital currency

02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:10.480
Within a few years. Yeah

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:17.440
Which is totally going to tie into the social credit system and their ability to control you just like we saw the pre warning with

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.400
um, what happened to Canadian truckers

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.200
When Trudeau locked bank accounts

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:30.720
Okay, and basically froze people's access to funds. I have a bunch of people that are up in friends up in toronto. That is

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
They are living in a totalitarian environment

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.000
That it comes out in all kinds of different ways. They're gone

02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:40.640
New Zealand is gone

02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:43.200
Canada was one without firing a shot

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:49.440
Through infiltration from world economic forum trained young leaders. That is the honest truth

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:52.640
Okay, and that country, you know, I grew up

02:18:53.040 --> 02:19:02.000
Canadians a you know and and sensible people very sensible people they are gone and they're busy looking for an escape route

02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:06.560
I mean, this is this is a flip-flop remember where we're all the word the liberal

02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.760
Protesters wanting to move to Canada remember during the war and all that it's all flip-flopped

02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:14.800
Okay, they now all want to come down here to the land of the free

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:18.720
She's like his backup rapper, you know, just it says like

02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.080
Game out

02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.840
Um, because it's gone. New Zealand is gone

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.120
Apparently, Australia had a major election

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:42.800
Turnover because people were so pissed off about the egregious policies that were deployed there about COVID over the last three years

02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:47.680
But what we're in a situation in which we're going to have to somehow

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.200
Find some way to tunnel through the next three years of sex. I'm sorry next few years

02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:58.160
Protect our children protect our own liberties our own ability to exist

02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:02.800
And there are some fundamental problems and one of them is tokens

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:06.160
I'm not here to pitch bitcoin

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:08.720
But bitcoin is in in cyber currency

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:16.000
You know for those of you that are probably a lot of you folks are familiar with the cyber currency world

02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:21.280
But for me, it's been a learning experience over the last three years to get immersed in that

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:28.640
Um, which we don't own any by the way. Yeah, there's there's two where we're precious smells people. Um, but there's two

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:32.880
There's there's kind of like two main branches here

02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:35.760
One is decentralized cyber currency

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:38.560
and one is centralized

02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:45.200
Centralized is what they're going to enforce on us. It's absolutely in the works. They're testing it right now through the Fed

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:48.400
Um, the bank of international settlements wants it

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:54.960
And centralized digital currency means that they can trend they can track every single transaction you do

02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:57.760
So no more of this

02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:02.480
Casual farm labor or get the guy down the street to put up your drywall or whatever

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:07.600
No more, you know every single thing that you buy that pizza box

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:11.280
Is going to be able to be identified with a qr code. Hey ron

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:16.400
We've got just a minute left. We actually out. So do you have any conclusions before we have rob?

02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:21.120
She called him rob. Well, I'm just saying I've seen Lynn over here. Yeah, she's waving at us

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:25.200
So so conclusions number one. Thanks

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:28.240
number two sport the unity project

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.880
um

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:33.120
The key three key words

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:35.760
Okay, keep these words in your heart

02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:38.000
Please

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
integrity

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.360
Dignity

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:43.040
and community

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:45.040
That's what we've lost

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:49.600
And that's what we've got to strive for we have to commit ourselves to integrity

02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.640
Um, anybody here know who ed doubt is

02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:55.040
Okay

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.640
I kind of brought ed doubt onto the stage. I met him in Maui

02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:03.840
A couple of years ago and he presented to me this document that he had come up with

02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.320
Together with a guy named tom that is

02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:09.280
Basically the building inspector for all of Maui

02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:13.280
And they came up with this document. They presented it to Jill and I on my birthday

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:17.760
And they said this is the Malone doctrine and we're like, why did you call it the Malone doctrine?

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:24.720
And they they said well, we've listened to everything you've ever said and wrote and i'm just like oh, i'm so sorry

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:29.440
And this is what's in between the lines of everything that you've written

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:35.760
And what it's all about is integrity. You can find it on our website for meloninstitute.org

02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:42.000
And it's about rebuilding integrity and a set of rules for organizations with integrity

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:48.400
And basically what ed posits is a world in which we build these intentional communities

02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:53.600
And we only transact with others other corporations, etc

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.560
That make a fundamental commitment to integrity

02:22:57.360 --> 02:23:00.000
And that includes things like data transparency

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:03.200
all kinds of things having to do with openness

02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:06.800
and transparency in everything that you're doing

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:09.120
um, and

02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:12.640
I'm with ed. I think that is one of the key things

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:15.600
the dignity part comes um

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:17.680
from a

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:24.000
Time that we spent with what was his name man? Yeah, uh, the uh, the guy who is the

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:25.280
um

02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:27.120
wrote the, uh

02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.680
biblic the, um history of

02:23:30.480 --> 02:23:32.480
the cardinal, um

02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:37.120
The cardinal turksen, you don't mean for him. No, not cardinal. No, that's arch the archbishop

02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:38.560
Jugano

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:39.680
He wrote

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:41.440
Jugano's biography

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:41.920
Right

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:47.600
And he makes the point that that one of the funnel of precepts of the church is respect for human dignity

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:51.840
Traditionally the catholic church, you know, catholic church today is a different thing

02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:54.400
but, um, so I argue

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.200
integrity

02:23:57.200 --> 02:23:59.200
Respect for human dignity

02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.840
Meaning, I don't care if you collect garbage

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.640
Or you're the president of the united states you need to be treated with dignity and respect

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:11.600
Um, and community is that comes from the tis decimals teaching

02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:18.640
But community is the thing that broke down that enabled all of this to happen that enabled the mass

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:24.800
Psychosis to happen that enabled this hypnosis that it enabled the syops deployed

02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:29.520
And that gets to the point of communities of faith are highly resistant to this

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:36.240
Community is the way we get through this we have to form community. We have to embed our children in community

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:43.200
And have strong relationships and we're done and we're they're covering and and so with that thanks for letting me ramble

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.200
I hope that was helpful

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:51.360
I

02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:55.040
Ladies and gentlemen, they have changed how we think

02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:01.600
They did it over several years about in several decades about pandemic potential

02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:10.240
In order with this plan in mind to swap us permanently from having sovereignty over ourselves and our children

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:13.440
To needing permission for everything

02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:16.480
This was their plan already for a decade

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.920
I'm 99.9 percent sure

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.480
These people knew that they had to change our mind about how a respiratory disease could be novel

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.760
They knew they had to lie about all cause mortality and exaggerate numbers from zero

02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:35.920
They knew they had to lie about our response to an immune

02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:40.240
art to a respiratory disease by emphasizing antibodies

02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:45.120
And they knew they were doing that because they were going to mislead us about vaccination

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
That's what this list means

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:53.760
This four-step plan to make sure that you understood as antibodies as primal

02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:56.720
and vaccines as the source

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:02.320
And once you understood that and that we didn't know anything about this novel virus

02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.040
They could institute protocols

02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.960
And change the way we behaved with one another throughout society

02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:11.680
for more than three years running

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:17.040
And no one is still questioning the basis for which all of these changes were made

02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:21.440
No one is questioning the biology upon base based upon which

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.200
These fundamental ideals were changed

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.960
And that's what gigo and biological is all about we're about telling the truth about this graph

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:33.760
telling the truth about why

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.800
pneumonia became a killer that it never was in previous years why flu disappeared

02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:41.600
And why a PCR test

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.480
Without specificity could be used to convert

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:48.720
all cause mortality into a new novel

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.440
cause of death

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:54.880
And then by instructing people to respond to that

02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:01.760
Identifiable new cause of death with stupid protocols you could actually increase

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.720
the all cause mortality

02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.200
In certain periods where you you you applied these protocols

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.440
Now if you want to go so far as to say that something had to be used to do it

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:20.320
Then there are a number of known technologies that are central to our

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:28.880
Understanding and central to our methodologies used to manipulate and study RNA viruses and that is infectious clones

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:33.520
And so without a doubt if there was a way for RNA

02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.080
to reach

02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:38.080
the far corners of the earth

02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:40.800
high fidelity copies

02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.200
The way it happened is with an infectious clone

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:45.600
And why would they have done it?

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:48.800
Because of the plan I said on the last slide because they have a plan

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:57.760
To make sure that we surrender totally our individual sovereignty and enforce a global fundamental inversion from basic human rights to basic granted permissions

02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.920
Because this is the last time there are going to be this many people on the planet

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:09.680
Please visit me at GigaOMbiological.com or GigaOMbiological or sorry GigaOM.bio

02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:12.960
GigaOM.bio is just really a

02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:21.040
It's a little it's a little soapbox, which is basically a twitter substitute, but you can speak to me. I can speak to you

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:28.000
Um, I hope this was useful. I hope it was fun my longer than I wanted to. I hope it was a good date night

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.200
for mark and Cheryl

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:35.920
And I hope everybody sleeps well tonight. Transfection is immunization and any

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:42.880
intramuscular ingestion of combination of substances to augment the immune system is a dumb idea as well

02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:48.720
They are trying to eliminate the control groups of stopped all transfections and humans

02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:52.240
