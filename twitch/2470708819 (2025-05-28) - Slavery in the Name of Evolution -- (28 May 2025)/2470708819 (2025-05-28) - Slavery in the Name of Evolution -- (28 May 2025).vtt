00:27.016 --> 00:47.446
I don't care how you get there.

00:47.466 --> 00:50.168
I don't care what you do to get there.

00:52.069 --> 00:52.749
The goal is to win.

00:57.449 --> 00:58.353
What time is it?

00:58.433 --> 00:59.156
Game time!

01:06.260 --> 01:07.840
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07.900 --> 01:08.601
Welcome to the show.

01:08.621 --> 01:13.562
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:14.262 --> 01:19.123
Very happy to be here this morning and give you that warning that you need to hear every day.

01:19.143 --> 01:21.964
Make sure you're making your way off of social media.

01:22.464 --> 01:29.746
This is the only noncompliance that actually matters, because there is only one chance in history to collect this data.

01:30.626 --> 01:35.387
And that data, unfortunately, also includes, as my friend Rosemary pointed out,

01:36.507 --> 01:39.948
It also includes the search for biting foxes.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.910
And I might mention more of that later today.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.351
Otherwise, just let that be a hint of things to come.

01:46.931 --> 01:50.972
There's lots of people who are really starting to see the big trap that we are all in.

01:51.913 --> 02:04.197
Ladies and gentlemen, autism spectrum disorder is a myth used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, that public health is never questioned as either.

02:04.797 --> 02:06.197
a reason or an answer.

02:07.578 --> 02:12.779
And that's the same reason why pandemics and gain of function are so in vogue right now.

02:13.479 --> 02:20.862
Because they are part of the same mythology that is slowly inverting our sovereignty into the experimental animal status.

02:20.882 --> 02:21.962
You are becoming a mouse!

02:23.157 --> 02:30.779
And if you don't understand why and what's happening, why the cheese is free, you will be dead in this trap.

02:31.939 --> 02:37.221
If you want to send something, you can send it to PO Box 802, Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.

02:37.921 --> 02:40.081
We are running the same rat race that you are.

02:40.501 --> 02:46.123
We have a family of five, and that's the only magic trick we are pulling off here at Giga Home Biological.

02:46.143 --> 02:50.244
If you want to support that and the support of this stream, please go there and find a way.

02:51.284 --> 02:53.106
That's gigaohmbiological.com.

02:53.126 --> 02:58.332
You should be watching at stream.gigaohm.bio just to tell me how well the stream works there.

02:59.193 --> 03:06.862
Because if we are kicked off of all of the other mainstream social media, in theory, stream.gigaohm.bio would still be live.

03:07.843 --> 03:16.449
If you want to have a statement read on air or played on air, you can record a voicemail at 412-423-6343.

03:17.069 --> 03:23.513
And you can even call it, and there's a chance that I'll answer it because it does, technically speaking, ring on my phone.

03:24.253 --> 03:32.719
It's May 28th, 2025, and you are hearing at Gigaohm Biological the biology that they ignore.

03:33.739 --> 03:36.560
Hopefully the truth is going to set us free eventually.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.522
I don't know when that's actually going to happen, though.

03:40.862 --> 03:42.523
I don't know if that's going to happen.

03:42.563 --> 03:45.264
I know that if we don't try, we ain't getting out.

03:45.864 --> 03:48.565
I know if we don't flap our wings, we ain't going to fly.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.307
And so I'm going to see what we can do every day.

03:53.967 --> 03:58.249
Ladies and gentlemen, the voice that you hear, if I didn't say it already, is Jonathan J. Cooey.

03:58.269 --> 04:02.031
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

04:03.552 --> 04:13.838
I have worked for the current Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and helped him write that Wuhan cover-up book as a scientific consultant.

04:14.418 --> 04:15.639
So I know a lot of his staff.

04:16.219 --> 04:21.822
I also worked for Children's Health Defense as a staff scientist under the direction of Mr. Brian Hooker.

04:21.842 --> 04:29.067
A lot of my research and ideas are represented poorly by Jessica Hockett, a traitor to America's grandchildren.

04:30.827 --> 04:34.948
in a substack that she uses AI to write called Woodhouse 76.

04:35.829 --> 04:48.812
This little scam is promoted worldwide by Jonathan Engler and Claire Craig and Pierre Corey and Nick Hudson, all associated with the meddler groups Heart and Panda.

04:49.032 --> 04:54.454
Lots of good people are wasting their time working under the direction of Claire Craig.

04:55.394 --> 04:58.518
and Jonathan Engler, two very awful people.

04:59.459 --> 05:07.928
And also part of this group, Panda Centered in South Africa, who had me present three times in 2022, but lost all those videos.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.332
All their videos from Jessica Rose are still up on Rumble, but not mine.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.336
And I've shared some barbecue time with the current

05:17.477 --> 05:22.800
Director of the NIH Jayanta Bhattacharya, a fella from India.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.102
Great guy from Stanford, good friend of mine.

05:25.962 --> 05:28.904
Hasn't called me since his schedule filled up, but that's okay.

05:28.944 --> 05:31.065
I guess that's the way it works when you get a government job.

05:31.966 --> 05:36.228
You find out who, you let everybody know who your friends are.

05:37.349 --> 05:39.010
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

05:39.870 --> 05:58.719
it's a it's a dark world that you see on the internet it's a dark dark world um i don't know what to say other than rna cannot pandemic intramuscular injections in general are not medicine um and uh quite dumb and transfection transformation that would have been a crime in healthy humans if we were honest about it but

05:59.279 --> 06:00.520
they weren't honest about it.

06:00.580 --> 06:08.745
And finally, and there's lots better explanations for what happened with regard to the number of people dead and stuff like that.

06:09.225 --> 06:17.750
And one of the things they don't tell you is that about two and a half million people to three million people die in America every year.

06:18.151 --> 06:19.932
And so, you know,

06:20.772 --> 06:25.695
a million people to COVID with a bunch of misattribution isn't very hard.

06:26.275 --> 06:29.397
Definitely if you use a little Murder and Lies to sculpt that show.

06:30.277 --> 06:31.838
That's where we are ladies and gentlemen.

06:32.319 --> 06:40.683
This is the way forward is thinking about a new model for biology so that this bad biology doesn't enslave our children.

06:41.284 --> 06:42.384
If you don't believe the

06:43.945 --> 06:50.291
The biological myth is all based on a signal they saw coming for 20 years or so.

06:51.112 --> 07:05.446
You can find the McKinsey Global Institute Dependency and Depopulation Report from January 2025 that will show you clearly this anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and then population collapse was anticipated and orchestrated.

07:06.548 --> 07:21.368
It could have been seen 20 years ago and predicted 20 years ago That's why all I have to do is flip to this screen and show you this population pyramid of America starting in 1990 when I was graduating from high school and this this generation just above me there

07:22.289 --> 07:45.386
seems to be a big bump in the population pyramid that will represent a temporary overload on the on the healthcare systems of all the Western nations because those families after World War II had a lot of kids but they discouraged that afterward and so it kind of went away and so you can see these bumps these bumps are anticipated rises in all-cause mortality that could be used

07:46.547 --> 07:54.009
to create the illusion of infectious disease, especially if you sculpted it using murder and sophisticated lies.

07:54.049 --> 07:57.729
And I actually think that's how they did this pandemic thing.

07:57.789 --> 07:59.290
And I think they had bigger ideas.

07:59.350 --> 08:01.550
I think they had bigger investments they were protecting.

08:02.590 --> 08:05.131
And those investments, wow, I'm not even on the screen.

08:07.531 --> 08:14.173
Those investments include the Human Genome Project, which was actually a multinational project from the very beginning.

08:15.053 --> 08:30.005
And that explains, I think, a lot of the resumes of the team of performers with elaborate costumes and scripts that were put on the internet and have been bamboozling you and I and our families for the last five years.

08:30.705 --> 08:36.049
And so I think we're at a crucial moment if we realize that social media has been weaponized against us.

08:36.109 --> 08:37.531
That trap already closed.

08:38.551 --> 08:49.540
And if you think that you're using social media successfully to make a difference, you are definitely running around in the trap and have no idea that you are doing it.

08:49.700 --> 09:00.069
So get off your go-kart, get out of the hamster wheel, point your flashlight forward, keep your arms straight, and let's climb out of this cave together.

09:00.969 --> 09:02.451
This is all they ever had, right?

09:02.871 --> 09:07.194
All they ever had was actors on social media and memes that nobody sees.

09:07.975 --> 09:12.456
And they can create the illusion that, wow, everybody thinks that Jonathan Cooley's a wacko.

09:12.536 --> 09:16.338
And it seems to be that everybody in this chat thinks that Jonathan Cooley's a wacko.

09:16.838 --> 09:22.240
And those are the kinds of weapons that they've used against every single one of the people in this narrative.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.421
You, me, and also the people who go on Joe Rogan.

09:25.461 --> 09:31.222
They're all victims of the trap, because the trap is social media.

09:31.262 --> 09:36.124
Because there, they can see what you see, they know what you see, and they can make

09:36.664 --> 09:41.977
You believe that what you're seeing is an accurate representation of something called reality when it's not.

09:42.796 --> 09:46.719
The only people that have ever seen that clown are the people that need to.

09:46.779 --> 09:51.001
The only people that know that Steve Kirsch exists are the people that need to.

09:51.041 --> 09:56.345
The only people that know that Dr. Jordan Vaughn exists are the people that need to.

09:56.745 --> 10:09.594
That's why your family and friends, if they're anti-Trump or Democrats who really don't like him or like where we are as a country because of that narrative, then they've never heard of any of these people.

10:10.319 --> 10:34.361
Because these people are part of our hamster wheel, our own personal conservative, curious, that side of the Scooby-Doo mystery is still trapped over here thinking that this is the dialogue and this is the, you know, the word is getting out about the vaccine schedule and that is just absolutely positively not true.

10:35.362 --> 10:44.087
and we are participating with this guy and have tricked ourselves into believing that we are helping to stop the train when we are not.

10:44.327 --> 10:58.955
The train is going to go on and on and on and the people that are pretending to stop the train, that have recruited you to help stop the train, those people are part of the same train company.

11:00.056 --> 11:01.076
And why do they do it?

11:01.937 --> 11:03.878
Because they want you to think you're needed.

11:04.431 --> 11:09.897
They want you to think that you're important, but you're not.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.098
You're part of the show.

11:11.638 --> 11:15.482
And the more people that go along, the more enticing it becomes.

11:15.943 --> 11:20.327
And now you see what social media is able to do because they don't even need to have a real train.

11:20.768 --> 11:25.993
They just need to have images and videos on your phone, which they've already admitted.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.875
A lot of them can be faked if they want to.

11:30.526 --> 11:34.950
And so it's a quite miraculous time we're in because it's visible.

11:35.050 --> 11:40.034
You can actually see the cracks in the illusion, the bricks in the wall.

11:41.055 --> 11:45.919
You can hear the bricks in the wall because the internet still contains the record of them.

11:47.120 --> 11:57.228
And so when Brian says that he doesn't like the word autism in 2013, it means quite a bit in light of his 20 year track record.

11:58.348 --> 12:01.491
his 30-year career as a dude.

12:02.091 --> 12:06.835
You don't have to evaluate him as the guy who interviewed William Thompson.

12:07.215 --> 12:10.398
You have to evaluate him as Brian Hooker the American.

12:11.078 --> 12:16.403
What has Brian Hooker the American done over the course of his life and career for America?

12:19.065 --> 12:20.146
That's what you have to think about.

12:21.277 --> 12:24.620
What kind of choices did Mark Kulak make for America?

12:24.640 --> 12:27.802
What kind of choices did Jonathan Cooey make for America?

12:27.842 --> 12:33.907
Why did Jonathan Cooey leave the United States in 2002 kind of angry?

12:34.587 --> 12:50.019
And why did Jonathan Cooey have published posters for the Society for Neuroscience meeting where on the bottom there was a little square that was big enough to read from about eight feet away that said, the US government is out of our control.

12:51.581 --> 12:57.356
And every time I came over from the Netherlands and presented a poster, I had a poster that said that on the bottom of it.

12:59.693 --> 13:03.816
Why do you think that this whole thing is happening?

13:03.977 --> 13:06.018
Why do we never hear about Brandy Vaughn?

13:06.038 --> 13:08.781
Why does nobody hear about Jonathan Cooley or Mark Kulak?

13:09.301 --> 13:22.152
Because there is an illusion of consensus that is created by what is effectively military programming suites that we have adopted as social media.

13:22.352 --> 13:25.975
And that term in and of itself is part of the enchantment.

13:26.877 --> 13:34.599
If they told you that these are militarized social control and monitoring programs, you would have said, well, I don't want any of these on my phone.

13:35.859 --> 13:46.322
But because that's not what they say, because this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of earth, this is to make sure that all of the grandchildren of earth are enslaved.

13:46.542 --> 13:50.343
Because in a hundred years, everyone living on this planet is gonna be dead.

13:50.823 --> 13:53.204
We're talking about the grandchildren of earth.

13:54.821 --> 13:56.062
The ones that aren't here yet.

13:56.683 --> 13:59.026
That's how these people are planning and thinking.

13:59.066 --> 14:07.877
And the rest of us are experimental animals from whom the most data possible should be extracted for the betterment of the species.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.961
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement.

14:12.001 --> 14:22.127
That's why people like Mary Talley Bowden need to be keep focused on the ivermectin and the free speech and the encroachment on your professional freedoms.

14:22.207 --> 14:25.809
And what are your professional rights and how did Texas violate them?

14:25.849 --> 14:28.371
Because if she ever thought about the bigger picture,

14:29.051 --> 14:46.004
about the biology of the murder in 2020, the biology of what happened in only a few hospitals, and the reality of the anticipated rise in all-cause mortality and how it might be used by a number of interested parties in order to create the illusion of something.

14:51.008 --> 14:56.893
That's the reason why we have somebody like Jack Cruz out there also pushing the same kind of nonsense

14:58.564 --> 15:07.806
The same kind of stories where there are a bunch of super bad guys with a bunch of super technologies that they're just already unleashing or they're about to unleash.

15:07.846 --> 15:09.467
And then there's also aliens too.

15:10.027 --> 15:17.069
And they can open up wormholes and disappear whole planes full of AIDS experts.

15:20.470 --> 15:24.872
It's all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen, because social media is not reality.

15:24.932 --> 15:27.854
Social media is the military weapon.

15:28.194 --> 15:31.856
Social media is the media, is the military weapon.

15:32.436 --> 15:37.798
That's why when Robert Malone went on stage in January of 2023 with Meryl Nass,

15:41.610 --> 15:45.734
Sasha Latupova, Asim Malhotra and Mike Palmer.

15:46.414 --> 15:53.480
He said that we would never figure it out because it is the world.

15:53.981 --> 16:03.489
It is the social media and all of these places where supposedly the truth was coming out, where supposedly Malone got censored on LinkedIn so he moved to Gab or to

16:04.049 --> 16:10.513
or to locals, or to X. And then supposedly people were getting censored on X until Elon Musk saved the day.

16:10.573 --> 16:13.795
Some guy from South Africa, where... Never mind.

16:14.896 --> 16:16.937
It's all scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

16:17.057 --> 16:30.385
Once you see that this team of performers and how they call for each other, how they all agree that this is all happening on X. My X account is where I just put my thoughts, you know, I don't even censor anything there.

16:30.965 --> 16:54.750
and everybody from from Fox News hosts all the way to Jack Krause agrees that X is the only place where it's safe to say anything and now just now it's starting to malfunction or glitch or something and so it's now really important that Elon Musk fixes X or otherwise free speech will be lost forever and it's just this endless show trying to make

16:55.310 --> 17:02.674
people think that and believe that and accept the premise that social media is the only alternative we have.

17:05.075 --> 17:07.717
And that is absolutely positively not true.

17:07.837 --> 17:11.479
That's the part that I think is most important to understand.

17:11.499 --> 17:13.400
I mean, you can see clearly it's murder.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.727
by their own numbers, you can see clearly that it's murder.

17:18.147 --> 17:22.970
So the question becomes, how did we get to having Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:23.230 --> 17:32.416
as the 2025 Health and Human Services Secretary, the only position in government that can officially declare the emergency that we're under still?

17:34.717 --> 17:35.518
How did we get here?

17:36.738 --> 17:39.100
Well, I've got an interesting theory.

17:40.598 --> 17:45.524
that I don't think is that crazy that has to do something with this book from Skyhorse Publishing.

17:47.005 --> 17:54.374
The editor, guy in chief or whatever of Skyhorse Publishing, Tony Lyons, has this book with Jesse Ventura.

17:55.595 --> 17:57.317
And in the epilogue of the book,

17:57.958 --> 18:00.421
There's this story about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:00.481 --> 18:11.955
running as an independent candidate for president, but then joining one of the two main party candidates in this story would be Jesse, the body Ventura as his vice president.

18:11.995 --> 18:16.421
And then the president being shot, the candidate being shot.

18:18.342 --> 18:24.385
And so there's some eerie parallels there with this book in 2008 with where we are now.

18:25.066 --> 18:36.432
Some eerie parallels with what I think Steve Bannon would have predicted in 2020, or at least surely would have stated out loud, that he thinks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

18:36.452 --> 18:38.413
should be a vice presidential candidate.

18:39.113 --> 18:50.622
a presidential, vice presidential candidate, which is exactly what is said in this book by Tony Lyons, who Steve Bannon has often called the brilliant Tony Lyons.

18:54.068 --> 19:17.418
And so also, of course, it's important to understand that Robert Malone has a long, long, long history with this biological mentor chain that goes all the way back to Bob Gallo and Murray Gardner and Rischetti of Judy Mikovits and all these people that at one point in time were telling us a story

19:18.058 --> 19:23.700
that there would be a geneticist in every hospital curing genetic diseases with retroviruses.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.221
They actually thought that and said that back then.

19:26.622 --> 19:33.584
It was just a matter of time before they would be standard, you know, sort of therapeutic tools.

19:35.205 --> 19:40.247
And that was admitted by Robert Malone in one of his interviews with a Dutch outlet in 2022.

19:40.708 --> 19:57.756
And then, of course, the research and development director of the Human Genome Project, the guy who was responsible for a lot of the robotics advances that allowed this otherwise almost seemingly insurmountable task of doing restriction enzyme mapping of the Human Genome Project to get a landmark

19:58.516 --> 20:10.246
landmarking, you know, like the first sort of guideposts on a sort of map of the human genome that would very quickly be sold as a completed genome, a read genome.

20:10.286 --> 20:11.467
Now we can just do it.

20:12.268 --> 20:24.598
And remarkably, we have this guy, Brett Weinstein, who from the very beginning, I've been very straightforward that and skeptical and almost hoping

20:25.990 --> 20:38.901
with my regular mentioning of her and with my leaving Piper Stover on my website under the review on the Scooby link, which she of course asked me to take her name off of that a while ago, but I did not.

20:39.621 --> 20:52.512
I've been waiting for any of these people who, you know, I guess maybe Kevin McCairn or somebody like Charles Rixey to figure out that Piper Stover must not be

20:53.633 --> 21:03.210
all that she says she is, and make sure that everybody realizes that I would have never been connected to Bret Weinstein except for this woman, Piper Stover.

21:04.753 --> 21:23.462
leave it to Mark Kulak to do one of the best shows he's ever done today, tying together so many of these threads with Piper Stover, making another sort of how is it possible that when you take it from a certain angle, all of these data points line up so perfectly.

21:24.483 --> 21:33.828
And more important to me than anything else was that this kind of all was spurred because I texted him the other day and marveled at the idea that, you know,

21:34.728 --> 21:40.849
After all this time, no one has ever come to me and told me something about Piper Stover.

21:40.910 --> 21:52.932
It seems to me that if anybody wanted to burn me or figure out what was going on or try to, I don't know, get something on the background of this, Piper Stover would not be ignored.

21:52.952 --> 21:57.173
That's why I have her here on this slide for so long.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.254
And Mark's show today is just

22:00.094 --> 22:01.275
was just spectacular.

22:01.455 --> 22:13.424
I mean it's just spectacular and so I will watch or listen to that podcast that he plays in that video but I want to give it time for everybody to see the production that he did.

22:14.445 --> 22:18.008
I think it's really spot on and it's not surprising to me.

22:18.648 --> 22:19.809
I don't want to be

22:21.204 --> 22:25.705
I left that person behind when I realized that I couldn't trust her.

22:26.445 --> 22:38.888
And I felt as though the decision to not worry about it, to not try to figure it out, because inevitably I'm not going to be able to figure out who she is or what she does or what her role is.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.588
I just left it behind.

22:40.608 --> 22:42.368
I was too frustrated.

22:42.428 --> 22:45.369
I was too focused on trying to get Bret Weinstein to listen to me.

22:46.229 --> 22:48.651
It's too focused on trying to get somebody to listen to me.

22:48.691 --> 22:49.372
Matt Crawford.

22:49.412 --> 22:50.392
Oh my gosh, dude.

22:51.193 --> 22:52.974
I was all stuck in this stuff.

22:53.315 --> 22:56.137
And so Piper Stover, I just kind of left behind.

22:56.197 --> 23:04.944
And it's remarkable because she was this woman who encouraged me to write this review and made me write it for like five months.

23:05.044 --> 23:06.505
It was done in January of 2021.

23:07.086 --> 23:11.229
And it wasn't until May that, you know, she kind of agreed it was okay.

23:11.289 --> 23:15.012
Like, and it was going to go in the wall street journal or something like that.

23:15.152 --> 23:15.633
I mean, it's,

23:17.478 --> 23:19.159
It's remarkable how taken.

23:20.519 --> 23:22.040
You know, she was texting my wife.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.121
At one point she was trying to recruit my wife to tutor her daughter.

23:27.281 --> 23:32.443
I mean, this web of lies is nasty.

23:32.843 --> 23:36.865
And so this scripted bullshit team, what is it for?

23:36.885 --> 23:38.565
What are the murder and lies for?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.026
It is really huge.

23:40.086 --> 23:40.666
It's big.

23:40.746 --> 23:42.246
It's the biggest thing there is.

23:42.406 --> 23:43.767
It's the Human Genome Project.

23:44.636 --> 23:46.097
There can be no doubt about it.

23:46.878 --> 23:50.921
It is the focus of more human resources.

23:51.181 --> 23:56.985
It is the largest, longest, most funded human endeavor, way bigger than any kind of Manhattan project.

23:57.025 --> 24:03.270
And so we are essentially at a crux where the shift is now being made.

24:04.130 --> 24:12.557
And unfortunately, I don't have a selfie with Piper, even though she did come to my house and stayed over here for a couple of days.

24:13.832 --> 24:31.716
remarkable things remarkable five years of history of trying to figure out assuming that there are only good guys assuming that there are only good actors there are just people who don't get it or people who haven't figured it out yet or are missing certain clues but that is not the case

24:33.581 --> 24:42.203
There are fooled individuals, unwitting participants, and then there are fully scripted actors that are working against you out there.

24:42.883 --> 24:45.224
And they are enabled by social media.

24:45.264 --> 24:56.387
They are privileged users of social media, most likely, with a whole army of anonymous accounts that can support them in any way and shape and fashion.

24:58.956 --> 25:04.198
And so it's a long, strange trip to get to the point where you realize that ultimately this is just about a lie.

25:04.278 --> 25:07.299
It's about this idea of molecular evolution.

25:07.519 --> 25:10.781
The molecular phylogeny of life is a lie.

25:11.741 --> 25:13.342
And Bad Biology 101 is a lie.

25:14.202 --> 25:30.809
is what has sprouted from it all of this public health nonsense has sprouted from it all of this you know faux nutrition stuff has sprouted from this and it will continue to to spiral out of control until we go back to the fundamentals

25:32.216 --> 25:35.239
And that means learning a different model of biology.

25:35.299 --> 25:37.681
As Buckminster Fuller said, you got to offer a better model.

25:38.301 --> 25:40.223
You can't just say the old model is bad.

25:40.283 --> 25:48.370
And so that's what we're doing here at GigaOM Biological every day that we can and working on a high school curriculum to do that.

25:48.430 --> 25:51.412
Evolution because DNA is really the best summary of that idea.

25:52.433 --> 25:53.233
Let's listen to this.

25:53.253 --> 26:00.997
That's how it ends up because the bankers can always take their money and begin digging holes in another country and emptying out that country.

26:01.217 --> 26:10.921
Now remember what we talked about yesterday and what we watched yesterday was a movie called Slavery in the Name of Progress or it was something else and somebody looked it up but that was what it's under at YouTube.

26:11.883 --> 26:22.751
And it is supposedly a Martin Scorsese film which is warning us about climate change or finite resources or environmental destruction.

26:22.771 --> 26:27.515
I'm not really sure what it's warning us about.

26:29.275 --> 26:35.660
Other than I think something to do with the banks and driving capitalism or driving consumption.

26:36.461 --> 26:41.685
And so the banks, he says, you know, they'll just dig holes in one place until they need to dig hole another place.

26:42.205 --> 26:46.589
Civilization is kind of a, as a, as a forest fire.

26:46.709 --> 26:50.852
And in a lot of ways, you know, you and I, we probably would agree and not argue with this.

26:51.576 --> 26:55.857
But at the heart of it is a responsibility to the species.

26:56.037 --> 27:02.760
At the heart of it is the idea that civilization as it exists is gonna result in our extinction.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.921
And that's an interesting proposition.

27:06.481 --> 27:08.121
And that's where that movie left off.

27:08.201 --> 27:15.424
I wanna pick up right there with the last 20 minutes of this because I think you'll be quite shocked at what was left.

27:16.704 --> 27:18.505
That's the global financial system.

27:39.265 --> 27:41.306
If the background music was annoying, that's okay.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.866
It wasn't something I was going to do all the time.

27:42.906 --> 27:43.466
It was on.

27:43.506 --> 27:44.186
I left it running.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.167
I don't know how loud it was.

27:45.287 --> 27:45.827
Sorry about that.

27:52.632 --> 27:54.166
I think she's sad about the forest.

28:07.792 --> 28:17.217
I think that if we don't take care of the Amazon, if we don't take care of it, we'll end up turning it into a desert.

28:17.277 --> 28:26.481
Because when we cut down a tree and it runs out of water, we'll have a lot of things and in the end it'll end up in a desert.

28:37.813 --> 28:45.138
The economists say, if you clear-cut the forest, take the money and put it in the bank, you can make six or seven percent.

28:45.638 --> 28:49.741
If you clear-cut the forest, put it into Malaysia or Papua New Guinea, you can make 30 or 40 percent.

28:50.281 --> 28:52.062
So who cares whether you keep the forest?

28:52.102 --> 28:54.063
Cut it down, put the money somewhere else.

28:54.344 --> 28:56.025
When those forests are gone, put it in fish.

28:56.105 --> 28:57.586
When the fish are gone, put it in computers.

28:58.306 --> 29:02.809
Money doesn't stand for anything, and money now grows faster than the real world.

29:03.730 --> 29:08.694
Now that's a very interesting statement, that money grows faster than the real world.

29:08.734 --> 29:16.099
But if it's fiat currency and they can print as much as they want to, then it never grew like the natural world.

29:18.921 --> 29:25.506
I don't want to get too much into that because I'm not an economist, but economy, the idea of economics is nonsense.

29:25.586 --> 29:27.188
Economics is not a science.

29:29.252 --> 29:31.934
even if it's at the University of Chicago, it's not a science.

29:32.014 --> 29:40.780
Economics is hocus pocus with big words and probabilities and models, and it's the worst of the worst.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.122
Conventional economics is a form of brain damage.

29:44.343 --> 29:44.883
Oh, here you go.

29:46.304 --> 29:48.145
Oh, wow, okay, now he's gonna tell you that.

29:48.205 --> 29:54.430
Economics is so fundamentally disconnected from the real world, it is destructive.

29:54.950 --> 29:57.632
If you take an introductory course in economics,

29:58.530 --> 30:00.852
He is a geneticist, though, you notice that, right?

30:00.892 --> 30:06.777
So there's still a red thread running through this, which is extraordinarily yucky.

30:07.938 --> 30:11.180
The professor in the first lecture will show a slide of the economy.

30:11.561 --> 30:18.707
And it looks very impressive, you know, raw materials, extraction, process, manufacture, wholesale, retail, with arrows going back and forth.

30:19.187 --> 30:21.149
And they try to impress you because they think

30:22.220 --> 30:23.121
They know it damn well.

30:23.221 --> 30:27.843
Economics is not a science, but they're trying to fool us into thinking that it's a real science.

30:27.883 --> 30:28.203
It's not.

30:28.923 --> 30:35.206
Economics is a set of values that they then try to use mathematical equations and all that stuff and pretend that it's a science.

30:35.466 --> 30:40.288
But if you ask the economist, in that equation, where do you put the ozone layer?

30:41.149 --> 30:44.290
Where do you put the deep underground aquifers of fossil water?

30:44.650 --> 30:46.651
Where do you put topsoil or biodiversity?

30:46.931 --> 30:49.853
Their answer is, oh, those are externalities.

30:50.745 --> 30:52.366
Well, then you might as well be on Mars.

30:52.466 --> 30:55.748
That economy's not based in anything like the real world.

30:55.968 --> 31:00.391
It's life, the web of life that filters water in the hydrologic cycle.

31:00.731 --> 31:04.873
It's microorganisms in the soil that create the soil that we can grow our food in.

31:05.314 --> 31:07.675
Nature performs all kinds of services.

31:07.835 --> 31:10.517
Insects fertilize all of the flowering plants.

31:10.877 --> 31:13.899
These services are vital to the health of the planet.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.680
Economists call these externalities.

31:16.740 --> 31:17.541
That's nuts!

31:51.524 --> 31:56.967
Unlimited economic progress in a world of finite natural resources doesn't make sense.

31:57.107 --> 31:59.189
It's a pattern that is bound to collapse.

32:00.370 --> 32:03.912
I gotta move this over and I'm gonna slide this over too.

32:03.972 --> 32:04.693
Sorry about that.

32:04.853 --> 32:05.513
Get this up.

32:06.574 --> 32:07.254
There we go.

32:09.176 --> 32:09.576
This should work.

32:20.779 --> 32:29.112
And we keep seeing it collapsing, but then we build it up because there are these strong vested interests we must have business with.

32:29.132 --> 32:29.533
Oh, darn it.

32:30.674 --> 32:31.896
And she's a meddler, of course.

32:31.936 --> 32:32.657
We know that, right?

32:32.718 --> 32:33.980
I saw her on an airplane.

32:34.060 --> 32:34.781
I have a selfie.

32:34.821 --> 32:35.642
Business as usual.

32:36.525 --> 32:52.236
And, you know, you get the arms manufacturers, you get the petroleum industry, you get the pharmaceutical industry, and all of this feeding into helping to create corrupt governments who are putting the future of their own people at risk.

32:55.919 --> 32:59.541
You can imagine lilies growing in a pond.

33:00.462 --> 33:01.783
Lilies grow very rapidly.

33:01.843 --> 33:03.204
They double every day.

33:03.730 --> 33:06.092
I did not tell her directly.

33:06.412 --> 33:09.035
What I said was, could we take a picture together?

33:09.135 --> 33:11.056
You used to be a big hero of mine.

33:12.458 --> 33:19.223
And I swear, she processed it and she then pulled down her mask and we took the picture.

33:20.224 --> 33:23.927
But I definitely used the words, you used to be a big hero of mine.

33:26.029 --> 33:26.910
So yeah, I kind of did.

33:29.121 --> 33:35.406
They're going to cover the whole surface, and there won't be any way of the fish getting oxygen, and all the life is going to die in the pond.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.249
That's how rapidly things can grow.

33:38.689 --> 33:41.051
One day, you're half full of lilies.

33:41.451 --> 33:42.992
The next day, you're dead.

33:45.134 --> 33:49.698
You could say that today, we're in the point at which the lily pond is half full.

33:50.218 --> 33:56.684
The life is being snuffed out of national economies, and the debt goes on doubling.

33:57.084 --> 33:58.085
How long can it do it?

33:59.378 --> 34:06.306
See, I think it's difficult to express how disingenuous it is.

34:06.446 --> 34:12.813
And I still have to kind of think through it because it's just striking me now is so important.

34:12.873 --> 34:14.655
But just to change your perspective a little bit.

34:17.437 --> 34:36.988
This constant switching between talking about economics and talking about biology and using biology as an analogy for economics is a really, really dangerous kind of rhetoric, because it seems to abdicate the responsibility of these greedy

34:37.888 --> 34:44.831
no good slime balls all over the world who are interested in enslaving our grandchildren.

34:44.891 --> 34:47.433
It seems to abdicate them from any responsibility.

34:47.473 --> 34:50.134
It's just how money works, man.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.335
You know, if you just have money, that's how money works.

34:52.415 --> 34:55.696
And that's how bankers work or something like that.

34:55.857 --> 34:56.137
And it's

34:57.365 --> 35:06.095
And then to use the biological analogies seems to suggest that it's an inevitable thing that's part of the world.

35:06.836 --> 35:08.037
It has one day to go.

35:21.957 --> 35:28.841
all the civilizations of the past, and I think- See, the problem I have with that there, for example, is where's the camera in that picture?

35:31.023 --> 35:35.746
I don't wanna sound like a conspiracy theorist, but where's the camera in that picture so far away from that?

35:36.486 --> 35:40.249
I mean, it's, they're preparing us for decline, exactly.

35:40.789 --> 35:51.176
Our own only seem to be doing well when they're expanding, when the population is growing, when the industrial output is growing, and when the cities are spreading outwards.

35:56.468 --> 36:00.316
Eventually you reach the point at which the population has overrun everything.

36:00.717 --> 36:03.563
The cities have expanded over the farmland.

36:05.776 --> 36:10.257
The people at the bottom begin to starve and the people at the top lose their legitimacy.

36:10.598 --> 36:27.423
Now, what I think is happening now that Mark and I are thinking differently and seeing it differently, I think it is possible that this is also an opportunity to seize on a moment to lay a mythology about overpopulation.

36:27.503 --> 36:32.625
Because if in reality, in 50 years, half those buildings are going to be empty anyway,

36:33.849 --> 36:42.259
if in reality there are going to be whole cities that are effectively going to have a lot of extra housing all over the world.

36:43.280 --> 36:49.222
then this is their one opportunity to tell you that, oh, there's finite resources on earth and we're about to run out of them.

36:49.243 --> 36:54.125
And that's why there's so much problem when there's probably not going to be any problem.

36:54.165 --> 37:04.609
And that may be the whole reason why they went all in on this consumer economy for as long as they've had and just polluted everything because they kind of already know.

37:06.325 --> 37:29.665
that this whole finite resources thing doesn't really matter if the population is about to go from 10 billion to 2 billion, and then all of these supply chains are going to fall apart and all this consumption is going to fall off a cliff, then in reality, you know, saying that, you know, look at this, the cities are like the earth is about to be overrun is an absolute lie.

37:29.725 --> 37:33.628
It's about to be, it's about to be empty with the exception of India.

37:37.771 --> 37:41.352
And so you get hunger, you get revolution.

37:48.335 --> 37:50.495
Why is that explosion inside of a castle?

37:50.535 --> 37:51.816
That's so bizarre.

38:13.666 --> 38:19.871
Now, one kind of scary thing about the moment we're in is that for the first time, there's kind of only one system.

38:22.153 --> 38:40.789
So if the whole thing goes down, you won't have what you've had in previous eras of epic collapse, which is that even though one civilization goes down, it may take a while to recover, there are other robust civilizations that are kind of the guardians of progress.

38:44.013 --> 39:00.045
So this dude with a nice new haircut and stuff in this video is very interesting to me and a little triggering because he had a whole series of fake arguments with Brett Weinstein during the pandemic, which promoted both of them on issues that don't matter.

39:00.866 --> 39:03.588
And he made a real big deal about calling Brett Weinstein out.

39:03.648 --> 39:07.631
And now he's in this, it's just, it's all one malevolent show.

39:07.651 --> 39:13.235
In that sense, some of the things that have been reassuring in the past,

39:14.091 --> 39:33.591
about progress don't necessarily apply to the current situation because once you once you get to the global level you've only got one experiment working that's just the inevitable culmination of its growth ever since the stone age and there were way stations along the way like the roman empire

39:34.360 --> 39:44.687
And now here we are, and more and more people are in the same boat, and they face problems, and either they will solve them together or suffer together, and possibly on a catastrophic scale.

39:47.008 --> 39:47.489
Here we go.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.070
Escaping the Trap.

39:53.012 --> 39:56.995
We are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.

40:02.691 --> 40:10.136
Our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past.

40:11.677 --> 40:12.818
But I'm an optimist.

40:12.838 --> 40:24.106
I can't control the music volume.

40:24.126 --> 40:30.551
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue.

40:41.934 --> 40:45.818
Not to be a dick, but this is the easiest voice in the world to fake, right?

40:45.998 --> 40:46.919
I mean, come on now.

40:48.460 --> 40:54.226
If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries, our species should be safe.

41:01.252 --> 41:04.836
We have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.

41:15.393 --> 41:23.699
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.

41:25.461 --> 41:29.083
Our only hope of long-term survival is to spread out into space.

41:29.123 --> 41:32.306
That is some seriously incredible shit.

41:34.767 --> 41:40.609
The first AI voice, the first computer voice that was for a human, yes, and it will be used against us forever.

41:40.809 --> 41:51.552
I was at a conference a few years back with George Lucas, and he came up and said, you know, there's only two hopes for humanity.

41:52.573 --> 41:56.434
Either we find another planet to colonize after we've destroyed this one,

41:57.630 --> 42:13.740
or perhaps your technology, meaning what we're doing with the genetic code, might be able to allow us to transform ourselves or other aspects of the planet where we could continue to live here.

42:14.681 --> 42:19.524
We are here to celebrate the completion of the first survey of the entire human genome.

42:20.501 --> 42:23.723
The first survey of the entire human genome.

42:23.983 --> 42:41.371
Here's Craig Venter, the guy that Piper Stover mentioned in the discussion that she was having about how nanobiotechnology and AI was going to revolutionize and create artificial life back in December of 2019.

42:43.387 --> 42:53.396
And so when she contacted me at the end of 2020 saying that she was some kind of, you know, Patriot, used to work in China, China's bad, they're bad guys.

42:53.416 --> 42:54.897
Don't you think this is a lab leak?

42:55.958 --> 42:57.719
I thought, I guess maybe she's okay.

42:57.759 --> 43:04.665
She says she works with, she worked with Dan Sirotkin, but Dan Sirotkin was a creep, so they couldn't talk.

43:04.806 --> 43:07.408
And he suggested that she call me.

43:09.019 --> 43:10.641
or he suggested that she call me.

43:10.701 --> 43:10.921
Yes.

43:10.961 --> 43:14.024
So that's how we got connected through Harvard to the big house.

43:14.044 --> 43:29.661
You know, Carl Surotkin, the guy who worked at Los Alamos laboratory, you know, Piper Stover, the, the lady who's co-founder of her company worked at Los Alamos laboratory, you know, Los Alamos laboratory where they do all the sequencing and where they come up with all the algorithms for the sequencing.

43:29.701 --> 43:30.161
Yeah.

43:31.468 --> 43:34.289
that place that's also the Department of Energy or something else.

43:34.329 --> 43:35.390
I mean, whatever, right?

43:35.510 --> 43:36.170
Who cares?

43:36.391 --> 43:37.471
It's just me and Mark.

43:37.671 --> 43:41.933
I mean, nobody else is even, I mean, nobody else is even in the ballpark.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.435
They're not even playing the same sport as us anymore.

43:44.455 --> 43:45.295
Are you kidding me?

43:46.836 --> 43:48.577
Look carefully how easy it is.

43:49.497 --> 43:53.119
This is a documentary that was put on YouTube about a week and a half ago.

44:02.298 --> 44:08.382
Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind.

44:09.323 --> 44:14.467
We are announcing today for the first time our species can read the chemical letters of its genetic code.

44:18.890 --> 44:31.719
For the last several years, my team has been actually sailing around the world, collecting all the species in the ocean, the micro species on filters, and we isolate all the DNA all at once from all of them.

44:33.539 --> 44:35.701
I have a novel way of looking at these genes.

44:35.921 --> 44:38.543
I view them as the design components of the future.

44:49.252 --> 44:50.794
What better excuse for yachting?

44:51.781 --> 45:07.121
It's a mind-boggling concept, even though we're doing it every day, that we can simply start with four bottles of chemicals, write the genetic code, and change the genetic code of species, basically developing new species.

45:07.847 --> 45:14.693
and we can try and find ways to make fuels that other people haven't even imagined we can do this with.

45:15.334 --> 45:17.356
Fuels that other people haven't imagined.

45:17.416 --> 45:33.971
It's interesting because one of the people that was in the signal chat with Chris Martinson and Brett Weinstein and Heather Haying that I only got into because of Piper Stover was a person by the name of Jumi Kim who actually worked on biofuels in algae.

45:34.511 --> 45:47.716
It's crazy, I mean, probably just a coinkydink, but it sure sounds a lot like genetic technologies that are involved in, I don't know, hijacking genes they find in nature and making new combinations of them for purposes unknown.

45:48.716 --> 45:55.559
Novel sources of food were limited only by our imagination and whatever biological reality is.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.201
When we consider trying to replace oil,

46:02.601 --> 46:05.083
We use billions of gallons of oil a year.

46:07.184 --> 46:11.768
I can't even, I think I have a pretty good imagination and vision what a billion gallons of oil is.

46:13.169 --> 46:21.214
And making a billion gallons of oil from invisible microbes is a certain leap of faith.

46:21.274 --> 46:25.397
But in fact, that's how we proceed in science.

46:27.779 --> 46:31.662
Will that solve the greenhouse effect or I don't know, my goodness sakes.

46:35.717 --> 46:38.218
Touching piano music.

46:39.019 --> 46:40.539
We can now write software for life.

46:43.581 --> 46:44.521
It's a done deal, babe.

46:45.062 --> 46:45.942
We can just write it.

46:52.125 --> 46:53.566
Don't these pictures convince you?

46:53.606 --> 47:04.231
By changing and taking over evolution, changing the time course of evolution, and going into deliberate design of species for our own survival,

47:06.698 --> 47:12.421
at least gives us some points of optimism that we have a chance to control our destiny.

47:13.062 --> 47:13.602
Interesting.

47:13.662 --> 47:17.584
Would it be that you would want to have a slave class and a smart class?

47:17.645 --> 47:21.167
Would you want to have different tiers of human intelligence?

47:21.547 --> 47:26.009
What kind of ideas do you have in store for us a few generations from now?

47:26.049 --> 47:31.773
What kind of bullshit, nonsense, imaginary futures do they have in store for us?

47:34.039 --> 47:36.501
This is not some super genius.

47:37.741 --> 47:39.763
None of these people are super geniuses.

47:39.823 --> 47:41.724
They just have really bad ideas.

47:43.005 --> 47:50.850
It's just kind of like some of those people dancing around with the blue and white flag, celebrating the burning of some village or another village.

47:53.631 --> 48:00.556
It's just like the people carrying around a blue and yellow flag, chanting something and it's all the same.

48:02.381 --> 48:04.623
They're all just people with bad ideas.

48:04.683 --> 48:17.157
This is a guy who thinks he's got a really good idea, but it's not a really good idea because it's based in a very bad idea, which is evolution because DNA, because DNA, we know everything.

48:17.457 --> 48:19.800
We can read our genome now.

48:23.018 --> 48:24.679
And they're lying about it.

48:24.879 --> 48:26.060
It's all lies.

48:26.120 --> 48:30.343
The only thing they've done is made it cheaper to sequence small pieces of DNA.

48:30.384 --> 48:41.552
The only thing they've been able to do is hijack the ability or the tendency of bacteria to copy whatever piece of DNA is inside of them.

48:44.053 --> 48:58.882
But insofar as those molecular truths translate to us understanding ourselves as an irreducible complexity that at its base is this symbiotic relationship with said bacteria, that's not the same at all.

49:01.443 --> 49:10.729
And they want you to believe that it's all just one ladder of development that went from bacteria to humans and bacteria are just our contemporaries and they didn't change.

49:12.145 --> 49:15.026
This is all part of the lie, ladies and gentlemen.

49:16.567 --> 49:20.789
And this guy very much must be in on it.

49:23.971 --> 49:27.513
We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell.

49:27.693 --> 49:33.536
This is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer.

49:36.092 --> 49:47.940
And I think just like the announcement of a human genome being read, or we can, or we've done it, that's not a true statement at all.

49:48.641 --> 50:02.370
And I will admit that I haven't evaluated what it is that they did when they claimed that, but I'd bet dollars to donuts that what I would find is something absolutely atrocious with regard to self-replicating.

50:02.610 --> 50:03.771
You didn't create anything.

50:10.564 --> 50:26.313
One of the challenges that it faces, the human species... Remember, that's the same guy who said that some parts of our brain are from bacteria, other parts of our brain are from worms, and some of them are part... And so he thinks our brain is the consequence of step-by-step evolution from bacteria to now.

50:27.313 --> 50:30.114
Which is also quite a remarkable statement to make.

50:30.595 --> 50:31.455
But he did make it.

50:31.635 --> 50:37.217
So this is the guy who's now on this shot with whatever he's about to say.

50:37.658 --> 50:41.079
So take it with a pretty big chunk of salt.

50:41.579 --> 50:43.960
We are more and more in a position of acting like gods.

50:46.081 --> 50:50.183
This has been true for a while because we've had the ability to change the climate, for example.

50:51.138 --> 50:54.340
This is going to be even more true with genetic technologies.

50:54.360 --> 50:57.642
We're going to be able to manipulate other species and eventually ourselves.

50:59.423 --> 51:04.866
We're going to be in a position of controlling our own fate in a way that no... X-Men.

51:05.346 --> 51:08.608
He's going to transform into a solar-paneled shuttle.

51:09.068 --> 51:13.631
...creature has ever, in a billion years on the planet, had an opportunity to do.

51:16.690 --> 51:25.919
I once wrote a poem in which a mad bishop said, and man became God, became greater than God in the Godhood of man.

51:25.939 --> 51:36.428
I do not see anyone living in this materialistic society as being anything like God.

51:37.169 --> 51:40.312
I don't know what God is, but, uh,

51:41.221 --> 51:46.085
In my wildest dreams, I would never conceive of God or a God.

51:46.365 --> 51:48.166
Look at how they use this woman.

51:49.888 --> 52:04.238
Some kind of voice of reason, some old grandma lady to tell you that I, I don't think of us as gods, but she still seems to be pretty, pretty behind the idea that we need to engineer the species or something.

52:04.779 --> 52:07.441
Certainly it'd be a lot better if there were only 500,000 humans instead of 10 billion.

52:10.828 --> 52:15.411
I don't know how much worse it can get, but this is pretty bad.

52:15.511 --> 52:26.819
This movie, and it's sort of the enchantment that it puts out there, and the potential for it to suck in young people is really incredible.

52:26.899 --> 52:27.879
It's a nasty one.

52:28.260 --> 52:33.503
It's being like a modern human being in a materialistic society.

52:34.284 --> 52:35.845
We're anything but godlike.

52:36.145 --> 52:37.606
I think the challenges are so

52:40.234 --> 52:49.848
overwhelming to all of us that we're all trying to just use whatever new tools we can to try and change the future.

52:50.208 --> 52:52.712
Synthetic biology is a progress trap par excellence.

52:56.564 --> 53:05.832
Biologists have pointed out that these engineering approaches is all very well, and the engineers can try to treat life as though it was some sort of computer or engineering substrate.

53:06.672 --> 53:12.177
But ultimately, the microbes are going to end up laughing at them, that life doesn't work like that.

53:28.103 --> 53:42.370
I think the problems that we're seeing now, whether we're talking about hunger and massive inequity, whether we're talking about climate change or the loss of biodiversity, have been driven over the last 200 years by a system of overproduction of stuff and overconsumption of stuff.

53:42.930 --> 53:44.551
See, so I think part of the trap

53:45.291 --> 54:07.831
that these kinds of people are in is that they see consumerism and the people that choose to do it as particularly bad and the third world people as not having any of it and they have to live in a world where all these other people are having parties all the time and I don't think that's as good of an argument as a lot of these people think it is because essentially

54:11.764 --> 54:15.229
It is the responsibility of the people who have orchestrated that.

54:15.269 --> 54:20.576
It is not the responsibility of the passive people on the cruise ship.

54:21.177 --> 54:27.645
Yes, you can choose not to take part in the cruise ship, but if you're born on a cruise ship, is it your fault?

54:29.373 --> 54:37.144
And yet that's what these people are born on a cruise ship, but now they want everybody on the cruise ship to be ashamed of themselves and choose to jump overboard into the ocean.

54:37.785 --> 54:40.089
And it doesn't really, that doesn't really make sense.

54:40.209 --> 54:42.052
What would make sense is

54:43.980 --> 54:46.723
I don't know what would make sense, but this doesn't make sense to me.

54:46.783 --> 55:00.334
These people are holding really, really thick contradictions in their head and also missing key pieces of data, including the predictions of world population that the population pyramids of the world make.

55:01.155 --> 55:07.480
And that is that we're not gonna have this, we're not on an exponential curve that's gonna go off into infinity.

55:07.520 --> 55:10.263
It's not 10 billion now and 20 billion soon.

55:11.980 --> 55:24.392
And it's either they are absolutely aware of it and are going along with this as part of a malevolent narrative control mythology thing, or they're too naive to understand it.

55:24.913 --> 55:35.263
They've been told too many times they're very smart or that they've come to believe this mythology because they haven't been able to get on a long enough time horizon to see it.

55:37.108 --> 55:42.553
And then that's been inflated and inflated and inflated to the point where it really is not in any way reasonable.

55:44.314 --> 55:55.643
The companies and those within governments who have supported that approach are now saying that they will provide new technologies to continue that consumption of stuff, that level of production.

55:56.564 --> 55:57.505
It's just not realistic.

55:58.295 --> 56:03.862
ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have built a new facility to identify the most productive strains of algae.

56:04.282 --> 56:05.584
Algae are amazing little critters.

56:05.704 --> 56:09.068
That's exactly what Jumi Kim worked on, you see?

56:12.265 --> 56:14.727
They secrete oil, which we could turn into biofuels.

56:15.027 --> 56:16.227
They also absorb CO2.

56:16.848 --> 56:22.391
We're hoping to supplement the fuels that we use in our vehicles to someday help meet the world's energy demands.

56:23.052 --> 56:30.216
Which is harder, mapping the entire genome set that makes up a human being or making algae produce energy?

56:30.616 --> 56:39.661
Making algae produce energy is not hard, but doing it on the scale required to have a major economic and environmental impact is going to be a huge challenge.

56:41.022 --> 56:47.570
We have good partner with that with ExxonMobil to try and get it to the scale that it needs to be of billions of gallons a year.

56:47.590 --> 56:51.715
A lot of engineering is required for facilities the size of San Francisco.

56:52.797 --> 56:54.479
I think they're serious and we're serious.

56:54.719 --> 57:00.326
What we're seeing alongside the development of synthetic biology is a massive corporate grab on plant life.

57:01.546 --> 57:15.109
Literally speaking, that means a grab on land, and a grab on seas as well, where people are being moved off of land to make way for the growing of plant life that can be transformed into plastics, chemicals, fuels, and so forth.

57:15.450 --> 57:25.432
What drives synthetic biology is not an attempt to save the planet or help humanity, but an attempt to increase the bottom line for certain very large corporations.

57:25.852 --> 57:29.513
If we're going to feed the upcoming nine billion people,

57:30.582 --> 57:34.208
We can't afford to use our prime cropland.

57:35.389 --> 57:43.281
And so the idea, the biological myth that they're laying down is that we're on an exponential curve and it's 9 billion, then it's going to be 10, then it's going to be 20.

57:43.822 --> 57:46.385
They're not going to tell you that 9 billion might be the top.

57:47.284 --> 57:49.946
And so 100 years from now, we're gonna need a lot less food.

57:50.706 --> 57:51.907
So we better prepare for it.

57:51.947 --> 57:58.532
We better move things around and get things ready, or identify the countries that are gonna need help.

57:58.932 --> 57:59.953
It's nothing like that.

58:00.033 --> 58:09.460
This is all about economic opportunity, but more importantly, it's about governance of our, it's about enslavement of our grandchildren under this mythology.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.240
We need to pass this,

58:12.722 --> 58:17.635
mythology onto our grandchildren by telling them that this is what's happening and what happened.

58:18.277 --> 58:18.899
And it's a lie.

58:20.984 --> 58:25.747
for trying to produce the billions of gallons of fuel that we use.

58:25.807 --> 58:33.452
What we're doing with writing the genetic code, changing these species, allows us to use desert land.

58:34.292 --> 58:41.957
We just need sunlight and CO2 for using these new engineered algae, for example.

58:42.157 --> 58:42.657
No water.

58:42.677 --> 58:43.838
They don't need any water.

58:45.034 --> 58:50.396
Synthetic biology, in a way, you know, it's frightening, but I'm very sympathetic to this in many ways.

58:50.476 --> 58:55.038
It would be nice to get a more water-efficient plant, but still, it would still need water.

58:55.579 --> 59:02.462
Craig Venter cannot create a plant which needs no water and no nitrogen, or which totally fixes all its nitrogen by sucking it from the air.

59:03.102 --> 59:04.102
It cannot go that far.

59:04.422 --> 59:06.443
This doesn't fundamentally change the game.

59:06.724 --> 59:09.865
What fundamentally changes the game, what people don't want to hear,

59:10.205 --> 59:15.492
And I'm coming to this all the time and people say, you know, don't talk to us like that because it's just a no starter.

59:15.712 --> 59:17.334
But for me, this is the only starter.

59:17.695 --> 59:18.956
We have to use less.

59:22.401 --> 59:23.582
The poor people need more.

59:23.622 --> 59:24.302
There is no doubt about it.

59:24.322 --> 59:25.323
There is no discussion there.

59:26.223 --> 59:31.867
If you are an average villager somewhere in Rajasthan or Punjab or Nigeria, you need more, period.

59:32.127 --> 59:39.211
They say basic human decency compels you to say these people need more, more clean water, more basic food, more education for their children.

59:39.452 --> 59:41.273
The discussion closed right before it begins.

59:41.853 --> 59:48.077
But as far as us is concerned, we certainly could and should do with much, much, much less.

59:48.197 --> 59:51.378
People have been conditioned that things have to always get better.

59:51.718 --> 59:56.219
And immediately, if you say limit something, people think this is not getting better.

59:56.439 --> 59:57.239
But it would be.

59:57.579 --> 01:00:00.220
It's not even a non-starter saying, people, you should eat less.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.361
You should eat less meat, right?

01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:03.581
Even that's a non-starter, right?

01:00:03.781 --> 01:00:05.581
You should use less electricity, right?

01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:06.942
You should build smaller cars.

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:09.022
The other day I saw the vice president of GM.

01:00:09.262 --> 01:00:10.643
But what about all the...

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:13.723
It's just so dumb.

01:00:13.823 --> 01:00:14.863
This is so dumb.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:18.604
Because it puts all the onus on the small, little, tiny person.

01:00:19.144 --> 01:00:23.925
On the little family who's supposed to feel bad about their overconsumption.

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:33.087
When it's people like this guy and all the other people that live in higher parts of the economic system, the economic tier that are doing all the consuming.

01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:38.588
It's all these industries that are doing all the consuming that a lot of us don't take anything from.

01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:44.183
Is me buying books on eBay causing a lot of problems?

01:00:44.264 --> 01:00:45.344
I guess, I don't know.

01:00:45.745 --> 01:00:50.689
I don't understand really what he's talking about with, I don't buy 10 iPads a year.

01:00:50.749 --> 01:00:53.851
I'm buying old binoculars on eBay.

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:55.553
I'm buying old books.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.415
I'm playing basketball and I'm streaming.

01:00:58.475 --> 01:00:59.516
What am I doing here?

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:00.777
What's going on?

01:01:00.817 --> 01:01:04.620
What do I need to change about the way that I work or the way that I consume?

01:01:07.389 --> 01:01:09.450
And it puts the onus on the wrong people.

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:13.192
And this guy talks about it like it's obvious that we all got to make changes.

01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:27.078
I guarantee you if we all started recycling and we all started turning all the lights off and we all started filling our tires up to proper pressure, and we all started, you know, commuting together, it wouldn't fix anything.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.521
Certainly nothing about Israel or Ukraine

01:01:34.748 --> 01:01:37.310
or President Trump's show would change.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:44.796
We would still have an Indian-born guy at NIH that pretended to be my friend for a few years.

01:01:44.836 --> 01:01:56.165
We would still have some, I don't know what, recovering addict as HHS secretary that posed as something and holy man, what is going on?

01:01:59.209 --> 01:02:00.811
talking about the new GM, right?

01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:05.515
And one of these journalists asked him rightly, you know, but your cars are still so heavy.

01:02:05.775 --> 01:02:07.397
And he says, yes, we are working on it.

01:02:07.697 --> 01:02:09.318
What is there to work on it, right?

01:02:09.499 --> 01:02:16.005
There are so many things which we could do, you know, not to surrender our standard of living, not to kind of live in a gutter, really, right?

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:20.489
You know, but we don't need one and a half ton car to go from red light to red light in a city, really.

01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:22.810
People are not willing to go back on these things.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:24.030
Most of them simply are not.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.771
Because they've been totally hijacked by this material culture.

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:32.552
Let's not underestimate the persuasion, the power of this material culture.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:33.413
It's immense.

01:02:33.553 --> 01:02:34.373
It's just immense.

01:02:34.513 --> 01:02:38.354
When I've seen so many people being... It's not the material culture, it's the media.

01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:41.391
and particularly the social media.

01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:44.392
For us to now call that, the culture is that.

01:02:44.452 --> 01:02:46.533
They have complete control over it.

01:02:46.633 --> 01:02:50.994
If they wanted to change the way we thought about things, it would take them a few months.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:03:00.716
Whole swaths of society could be convinced to make different choices and to go different directions and to believe different things, I assure you.

01:03:02.537 --> 01:03:04.139
and this movie is just a part of that.

01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:05.380
That's why it's on YouTube.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:13.648
So genuinely unhappy that they cannot afford a $50,000 bathroom remodeling, right?

01:03:13.908 --> 01:03:16.591
I mean, there's something wrong with that value, right?

01:03:16.611 --> 01:03:22.977
Because bathroom is a place where you should spend like, whatever, 10 minutes to take a shower, brush your teeth, so it doesn't have to be worse.

01:03:23.237 --> 01:03:25.199
But you know how much money people are...

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.702
Again, on my mind, because we are thinking about redoing our bathroom.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:30.562
So it's on my mind.

01:03:30.783 --> 01:03:31.723
So it's very interesting.

01:03:31.923 --> 01:03:34.605
So for me, it's a chore, because it has to be done.

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:36.646
So don't you see, he doesn't even see it.

01:03:36.806 --> 01:03:40.048
If those people didn't have the money, they wouldn't spend it on their bathroom.

01:03:41.289 --> 01:03:51.815
If these people didn't have so much money that they could spend it on anything frivolously, and it doesn't matter, then that kind of a consumption wouldn't go on, because that's not what's happening in my house.

01:03:52.742 --> 01:04:02.489
We're not over consuming here, buying $30 a year, dolls a year when we should only buy three, which is also funny what Trump said recently.

01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:04.230
It's the same bullshit as this.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:14.076
The reason why it's happening is because it's there by design.

01:04:14.156 --> 01:04:19.040
They are preying on us like financial animals.

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:27.410
We have been a captive population and we have been farmed for everything that we can possibly be farmed for for 200 years.

01:04:30.547 --> 01:04:33.551
And the traders have come home to roost now.

01:04:33.611 --> 01:04:36.955
The last bones of the United States are being plucked clean.

01:04:37.535 --> 01:04:40.098
The last value is being drained out of our treasury.

01:04:40.519 --> 01:04:51.091
And now they want you to believe it's climate change, and scarcity of resources, and overpopulation, and we can't feed everybody, and we got to give more stuff to the poor world.

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:55.554
But for many people, it's kind of a life-affirming thing, you know.

01:04:55.795 --> 01:05:04.621
People are renting storage spaces, right, which they will never access in the next 20 years, to store the junk which they cannot store in their 5,000-square-foot homes, right?

01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:05.902
So do we need that?

01:05:06.262 --> 01:05:07.343
So it's just amazing.

01:05:08.824 --> 01:05:13.950
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, this is very difficult to put the genie in the bottle.

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:17.034
So everything is defined in this material thing.

01:05:17.134 --> 01:05:23.101
I could make it a lot more coherent, but you see, this is difficult because when you make it a lot more coherent, you make it prescriptive.

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:26.242
And prescriptions never work, really, because I don't have the solution.

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:32.524
I can't sit here and say, you know, we should follow this and by 2030 everything click and we all live happily ever after, right?

01:05:32.705 --> 01:05:35.466
So I'm making it deliberately uncoherent.

01:05:35.706 --> 01:05:37.126
I could be very doctrinaire.

01:05:37.306 --> 01:05:39.947
But you see, I live for 26 years in a communist society.

01:05:40.087 --> 01:05:47.790
I'm inoculated against any doctrinaire, grand solution, saying, you know, this is the pattern, this is the must, this is the paradigm which you have to follow.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.311
I'm just totally set against it.

01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:55.896
I'm making things deliberately kind of, you know, messy, inchoate, uncoordinated, because that's how life is.

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:57.598
We don't know what pattern will emerge.

01:05:57.898 --> 01:06:10.028
As long as we are living amidst of this sea of affluence and opportunities and material riches, it's just very difficult to make this individual, voluntary, resolute step.

01:06:10.128 --> 01:06:16.574
Nice statement he's making here, because what he's basically saying is, is that right now we don't know where civilization's gonna go.

01:06:18.055 --> 01:06:23.557
Right now it's just a bunch of amorphous things, you know, nation states, whatever systems are there.

01:06:23.997 --> 01:06:31.780
And we don't know what's going to happen when the population pyramid starts to impact the way that these systems interact with one another.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:37.882
We're kind of in a chaotic state where maybe it's an opportunity to reorganize the way civilization works.

01:06:38.322 --> 01:06:40.603
And so who knows what will come out on the other side.

01:06:40.643 --> 01:06:40.923
And that's

01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:58.897
actually exactly where you would need to be if you wanted to make nation-states a thing of the past and organize around things like, I don't know, the North American Union, the European Union, an Asian Union, and then eventually a global digital currency web or something like that.

01:06:58.957 --> 01:07:00.058
Who knows where they're going?

01:07:00.879 --> 01:07:03.140
The Amero's right around the corner, I'm sure of it.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.703
Saying enough, back, limit, very difficult.

01:07:10.177 --> 01:07:10.677
It's not.

01:07:11.118 --> 01:07:11.858
It's really not.

01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:15.500
And they're going to do it very quickly if that's in the cards.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.881
And they're just telling you about it.

01:07:44.993 --> 01:07:47.895
I think we have reached the age of limits.

01:07:47.935 --> 01:07:52.779
Even if we are free, we are free to live according to the nature we were created in.

01:07:52.859 --> 01:08:02.506
And it is not possible to defend models that cannot be universalized, because otherwise we would have to start from the principle that some have rights and others do not have rights.

01:08:02.526 --> 01:08:06.568
So it is not a technical problem, it is an ethical problem.

01:08:12.439 --> 01:08:19.224
I was walking around pointing my finger at everybody and, you know, you people and, you know, blaming the culture for its consumption.

01:08:19.285 --> 01:08:26.210
And finally one day I came home and I had the air conditioners were on even though there was no one home.

01:08:27.091 --> 01:08:30.173
And I was like, wait, you know, I'm going around blaming everybody else.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:34.296
But the fact of the matter is that my lifestyle requires a huge amount of resource too.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:35.998
So how can I blame other people?

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:45.102
And I realized that before I go around trying to change other people, maybe I should look at myself and change myself and keep my side of the street clean.

01:08:46.132 --> 01:08:51.893
So it has nothing to do with the way that resources are stripped to produce all the stuff that we buy on Amazon.

01:08:51.913 --> 01:08:53.153
It has nothing to do with that.

01:08:53.193 --> 01:08:55.234
It has to do with us buying stuff on Amazon.

01:08:55.694 --> 01:09:01.615
If we would stop buying stuff in stores, buying stuff in Amazon, then Amazon would go out of business.

01:09:01.655 --> 01:09:07.616
And then all of this, you know, mining and slavery and child labor would all go away, right?

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.537
That's the whole point.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.217
It's our responsibility

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:25.908
as consumers to make different choices despite the fact that there's 40 kinds of soft drink available in all of the, I mean, what are they talking about other than to invert this responsibility from them to us?

01:09:27.629 --> 01:09:34.234
And it's our responsibility to teach our kids how that is the cardinal, that is the central bullshit here.

01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:38.386
Yes, we are responsible adults.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:41.648
We are responsible adults for what we do and how we do it.

01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:53.958
But the vast majority of people are not causing the problem by leaving an air conditioner on or choosing not to turn their lights off or making sure that the faucet doesn't drip.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:10:22.957
when billions of gallons of water are wasted by commercial agriculture every year, when billions of gallons of water are polluted by commercial enterprise every year, when this is just absurd, when it should be the people who are starting to regulate the corporations, take the money back from the corporations, the profits back from the corporations, so that this stuff wouldn't happen anymore.

01:10:24.514 --> 01:10:26.395
But we're never going to blame the corporations.

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:28.536
We're never going to blame the industries.

01:10:28.576 --> 01:10:31.498
We're never going to blame those people who sell the stuff.

01:10:31.878 --> 01:10:33.619
We're going to blame the people who buy it.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.920
Oh, I'm ashamed of myself.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.542
My, my standard of living requires so much stuff.

01:10:39.883 --> 01:10:41.163
Your standard of living.

01:10:41.183 --> 01:10:41.243
Wow.

01:10:44.045 --> 01:10:47.046
It's just, it's, it's remarkable how awful it is right now.

01:10:47.687 --> 01:10:53.070
So I came up with this idea that I would live as environmentally as possible for a year and see how that affected us.

01:10:56.792 --> 01:10:58.233
So we did this no impact experiment.

01:10:58.273 --> 01:10:58.594
We did it.

01:10:58.654 --> 01:10:59.294
We live in New York.

01:10:59.334 --> 01:11:00.395
We live in the middle of New York City.

01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:04.358
Why don't you start a company that makes something and has no environmental impact?

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:13.245
How about that for trying to change the world instead of trying to make sure your own shit doesn't stink or that you don't produce enough garbage to matter.

01:11:13.766 --> 01:11:15.387
Think about how dumb this is.

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:17.449
That's not changing the world at all.

01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:22.913
That's not trying to get up in the morning and push the stone at all.

01:11:22.933 --> 01:11:26.336
I'm going to go camping for a year.

01:11:28.032 --> 01:11:34.099
which made it unusual because most people can think of environmental living as some sort of a back-to-the-land thing.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.145
But of course, back-to-the-land is not the right idea when it comes to saving our habitat.

01:11:40.586 --> 01:11:44.370
If all of us in New York were to go back to the land, we would very much destroy the land.

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.897
We're not biologically consumptive.

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:57.799
This has not got to do with human nature.

01:11:58.159 --> 01:12:00.881
Human nature is to do what everybody else does.

01:12:01.361 --> 01:12:04.303
That's human nature, that we want to, and it's wonderful.

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:05.804
It's like, I want to be with you.

01:12:05.824 --> 01:12:06.945
I want to be the same as you.

01:12:07.065 --> 01:12:08.886
I want to love you, and I want you to love me.

01:12:08.927 --> 01:12:09.727
That's not bad.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.591
But that's also part of the problem.

01:12:14.611 --> 01:12:18.273
I want to be the same as you, and you consume, so I'm not going to be the first not to consume.

01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:22.576
But it also tells us- I want to be the same as you, and you consume.

01:12:22.716 --> 01:12:23.437
So you see?

01:12:24.687 --> 01:12:25.828
We're all caught up in it.

01:12:25.868 --> 01:12:28.709
The only reason why I buy a car is because my neighbor buys a car.

01:12:28.789 --> 01:12:29.249
Come on.

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:30.550
This is just awful.

01:12:31.171 --> 01:12:35.593
If we can move from non-consumption to consumption, we can also move from consumption back to non-consumption.

01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:48.670
Maybe we should be talking about this a different way, just to throw an idea out there.

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:53.492
Did I talk about this at all yesterday with regard to binoculars?

01:12:53.572 --> 01:12:59.515
So here, just again, these are binoculars from, I believe, the 70s.

01:12:59.615 --> 01:13:00.615
I don't know how old they are.

01:13:00.675 --> 01:13:04.717
They could be, but they're lights binoculars, which would become Leica afterward.

01:13:06.638 --> 01:13:08.078
And they still work wonderfully.

01:13:08.158 --> 01:13:14.161
So there's a thing about building things to last forever or indefinitely.

01:13:14.921 --> 01:13:21.663
or as long as they're taken care of, as opposed to building things that are designed to fall apart.

01:13:23.724 --> 01:13:31.327
And so is it, again, the consumer's fault that the only thing that's available in the American and Western economy are things that aren't built to last?

01:13:33.828 --> 01:13:35.068
Things that are single use?

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:37.729
Is that the consumer's fault?

01:13:39.264 --> 01:13:41.325
And again, that's what it seems to be.

01:13:41.365 --> 01:13:45.826
This is all about consumers making the right choices and then all this shit would be better.

01:13:46.686 --> 01:13:57.309
Instead of thinking of ourselves as essentially we are already enslaved to a system that makes an awful lot of choices for us based on the fact that it eliminates a lot of options.

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:05.312
And then you have social media and mainstream media encouraging you to eliminate those options and not even look at them.

01:14:07.168 --> 01:14:09.189
And yet it's all the fault of the people.

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.192
No, it's the fault of their rulers.

01:14:14.133 --> 01:14:23.659
The militarized social media, which has brought us to this precipice, this seeming consumer apocalypse, but it's not, it's not at all.

01:14:24.579 --> 01:14:32.785
They are taking advantage of a known end in a population problem, the peak in human population.

01:14:33.265 --> 01:14:34.826
They are taking advantage of it.

01:14:36.735 --> 01:14:41.259
to lay down a mythology that will enslave our grandchildren.

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:51.086
And part of it has to do with our responsibilities to the species, this unique opportunity we have as a species, the timer that's running out on our species.

01:14:53.008 --> 01:15:02.756
The only timer that's running out is on the ability for them to collect as much of this data as possible before there are actually less people alive on the planet.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:08.417
We need to begin by saying, we're at the end of a failed experiment and it's time to say goodbye to it.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:11.099
It's an economic experiment, it's a technological experiment.

01:15:11.119 --> 01:15:14.922
It's been going on for a couple of hundred years and it's not worked.

01:15:14.982 --> 01:15:17.104
It's brought us to this point of crisis.

01:15:17.724 --> 01:15:28.733
Then we can start to sanely and intelligently say, how can we live within the real limits that our planet gives us and create a safe operating space for humanity?

01:15:29.989 --> 01:15:44.215
Admittedly, we've used our brain in ways that are detrimental to the environment and society, but brains are beginning to get together around the planet to find solutions to some of the harm that we've inflicted.

01:15:45.056 --> 01:15:46.496
Brains around the planet?

01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:48.457
Maybe it's like a techno-sphere.

01:15:50.939 --> 01:15:51.159
Right?

01:15:51.239 --> 01:15:55.000
It's all the smart people in the world are now connected through the internet.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.581
So we're going to have a gain of function like never before.

01:15:58.101 --> 01:16:01.822
And finally, all these people are really just going to solve all the problems for us.

01:16:02.923 --> 01:16:03.883
Using AI, of course.

01:16:03.903 --> 01:16:05.003
Problem-solving species.

01:16:05.063 --> 01:16:07.624
We always do pretty well when our back's to the wall.

01:16:10.046 --> 01:16:11.867
The planetary brain!

01:16:12.288 --> 01:16:14.589
The planetary brain, Mark!

01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:29.841
That is exactly what we were talking about with regard to Desjardins and the phenomenon of man, the idea that we would come together as a species and start to have a species-wide vision of the future.

01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:36.025
A giant social brain or planetary brain, because it's in the physical form of the internet.

01:16:36.306 --> 01:16:39.368
It looks so much like a nervous system, you almost can't miss the analogy.

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:49.422
You might say that there have always been a lot of little social brains around the planet, getting bigger, starting to form little interconnections among themselves.

01:16:50.102 --> 01:16:53.903
Now, more than ever, you could say there's a unified social brain.

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.106
And what is this doing?

01:17:06.166 --> 01:17:10.047
It's selling you the idea that social media is now the superpower on Earth.

01:17:11.303 --> 01:17:14.486
It's now the superpower, it's supranational power.

01:17:15.106 --> 01:17:22.633
And so you better actually acknowledge that, that thoughts of the world can be controlled via social media.

01:17:22.653 --> 01:17:26.776
It's a new level of control that has never been before possible.

01:17:26.856 --> 01:17:32.801
And it's only possible because currently the vast majority of people in the West and around the world

01:17:33.622 --> 01:17:42.226
are acquiescing to the use of social media as a legitimate means of finding the truth and of communicating it with their fellow man.

01:17:42.266 --> 01:17:44.027
And that's absolutely wrong.

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:47.189
It's the absolute opposite.

01:17:52.355 --> 01:18:00.002
That's from the Blue Brain project where I worked in Switzerland in Lausanne with Henry Markram.

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:08.749
That's all animation probably done with Rodrigo's fills, the guy who put the 12 patch together and also I patched with while I was there.

01:18:16.954 --> 01:18:28.060
Even if the overall arc of history is toward an expanded moral horizon, more and more people acknowledging the humanity of more and more different kinds of people, there's always the risk of backsliding, and it can be catastrophic.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:41.528
From a point of view of strict self-interest, it is imperative that we make further moral progress, that we get more and more people to acknowledge the humanity of one another.

01:18:42.515 --> 01:18:44.756
more and more moral progress.

01:18:44.796 --> 01:18:59.045
So what they're going to do is they're going to get you to surrender more of your sovereignty to the goals of the collective, which will include, of course, all of your data, your medical data, and maybe even some of the medical choices that you make.

01:19:00.034 --> 01:19:01.915
or it will be bad for pretty much all of them.

01:19:02.256 --> 01:19:26.292
If we don't develop what you might call the moral perspective of God, then we'll screw up the engineering part of playing God, because the actual engineering solutions depend on seeing things from the point of view of other people, ensuring that their lives don't get too bad, because if they do, it'll come back to haunt us.

01:19:28.344 --> 01:19:29.345
So, you know.

01:19:29.785 --> 01:19:33.366
If people's lives get too bad, it will come back to haunt us.

01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:34.847
Who's he talking about us?

01:19:36.388 --> 01:19:37.828
What kind of rhetoric is this?

01:19:39.549 --> 01:19:41.870
Kind of half of being God has just been handed to us.

01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:47.072
And then the question is whether we'll master the other half of being God, the moral half.

01:19:48.292 --> 01:19:49.993
Wow, is that bad?

01:19:50.733 --> 01:19:52.194
Oh my goodness, is that bad?

01:19:54.025 --> 01:19:59.707
The bad news is that the Enlightenment is sometimes hard to come by, because of human nature in some cases.

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:08.530
Because, you know, we've got these kind of animal minds, designed for very different environment, facing novel problems.

01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:14.893
We have animal minds, novel problems, environments,

01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:25.399
So the enlightenment part is going to require some real education and reflection and self-discipline that may not come naturally.

01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:28.843
It may not come naturally.

01:20:28.903 --> 01:20:30.244
We may have to force it.

01:20:31.085 --> 01:20:32.627
What the hell is he talking about?

01:20:34.528 --> 01:20:37.572
I don't think he's talking about teaching everybody a new biology 101.

01:20:38.152 --> 01:20:38.733
That's for sure.

01:20:50.151 --> 01:20:52.132
I think what we're up against here is human nature.

01:20:52.192 --> 01:21:07.460
We have to reform ourselves, remake ourselves in a way that cuts against the grain of our inner animal nature and transcend that Ice Age hunter that all of us are if you strip off the thin layer of civilization.

01:21:08.441 --> 01:21:16.305
So I thought that in an earlier part of this that they actually nailed it for a little bit when they said that we are an animal that runs software.

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:25.217
They actually said it like we are running software on old hardware, but I don't think that analogy was right.

01:21:25.357 --> 01:21:39.230
I think what makes the human race in particular such an interesting species is that our long developmental time period allows us to impart on our children all sorts of different software.

01:21:40.051 --> 01:21:41.192
We could raise killers.

01:21:41.892 --> 01:21:43.133
We can raise gardeners.

01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:45.694
We can raise caretakers.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.016
And we can raise vigilant caretakers.

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:52.358
We can raise sheepdogs.

01:21:54.279 --> 01:22:01.864
I think that part of it is what makes humans so flexible and also so enslavable and also so malleable.

01:22:01.944 --> 01:22:06.346
And I think that is actually what these people really understand.

01:22:06.406 --> 01:22:07.467
They want you to think

01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:13.342
And this is something that's hitting me right now, and it's a little bit hard to say it in one go.

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:27.272
But what they think and what they want you to think about is their use of genetics to modify the species, when in reality, we are a species that a lot of the software is implanted during childhood and from

01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:30.935
our parents and our experiences and we learn from our experience.

01:22:31.415 --> 01:22:50.772
And that's what makes us so flexible in so many different environments and so many different cultures and so many different ways that we've solved the problems that we've been put in front of us with teepees and igloos and wigwams and longhuts and skyscrapers.

01:22:53.553 --> 01:23:02.980
And they know that in two generations, they could have an entirely different planet full of different humans that thought differently about the world.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:17.151
They know that because a few generations ago, people thought that sacrificing people and letting their bodies tumble down the stairs of pyramids was a way of interacting with the gods.

01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:18.512
And everybody believed it.

01:23:19.693 --> 01:23:27.941
And that software was reliably uploaded into generations of Mayan Indians and Aztec Indians.

01:23:28.761 --> 01:23:37.970
And so they know that if they can find a way to upload new software onto generations to come, that they will be successful.

01:23:38.290 --> 01:23:42.394
And this is not, we're gonna require one ounce of understanding the genome.

01:23:45.546 --> 01:23:54.573
Not one, even one ounce of understanding the genome would be required to use social media to fundamentally change everything that your grandchildren were to believe.

01:23:56.294 --> 01:23:59.416
Because that's still quite a ways away for some of us.

01:24:01.998 --> 01:24:05.221
If I'm lucky enough to have grandkids, it's a little ways away yet.

01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:07.883
Maybe we're talking about Mark's great grandkids.

01:24:08.703 --> 01:24:11.826
Maybe we're talking about a lot of my audience's great grandkids.

01:24:12.286 --> 01:24:14.508
But we are talking about a collective

01:24:15.473 --> 01:24:24.555
effort to make us think that they are going to modify the species with genomic tweaking when they all know that's bullshit.

01:24:27.336 --> 01:24:37.438
What they're going to do is they're going to modify our species with mental programming by training them on a different set of myths.

01:24:37.598 --> 01:24:44.240
And that's going to be pretty hard to do, but on the other hand, pretty awesome if they can do it to the whole world.

01:24:45.196 --> 01:24:48.838
And that's what I think social media could potentially allow to happen.

01:24:48.898 --> 01:25:14.549
A whole mythology, a whole new history over the next 50 years could be laid down, which explains the current circumstances of the enslaved children of earth 50 years from now has something that has nothing to do with what actually got them there, which will be a fundamental disconnect from our true biology and a fundamental disconnect from what could be an awakening

01:25:15.396 --> 01:25:21.561
a real new understanding of who we are as a species, but more importantly, how we really fit into the world around us.

01:25:23.963 --> 01:25:40.396
I think this is an extraordinary moment in human history because while they try as hard as they can to score this touchdown, they are inevitably very, very, very vulnerable because it's an illusion.

01:25:40.656 --> 01:25:44.920
It's a mythology that can only be sustained with our use of social media.

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:14.541
We always have been the initiators of this experiment.

01:26:14.581 --> 01:26:16.763
We've unleashed it, but we've never really controlled it.

01:26:16.803 --> 01:26:22.047
But now it's more likely that we're going to come to grief because of environmental problems.

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:33.837
If we do, then that is really nature saying the experiment of civilization is a failed evolutionary experiment, that making apes smarter is a dead end.

01:26:34.777 --> 01:26:45.966
So it's up to us to prove nature wrong in a sense, to show that we can take control of our own destinies and behave in a wise way that will ensure the continuation of the experiment of civilization.

01:26:52.651 --> 01:26:53.231
I agree.

01:26:53.311 --> 01:26:55.253
Engineered failure, that's what I think.

01:26:55.993 --> 01:26:56.534
Absolutely.

01:27:02.230 --> 01:27:04.171
And they want us to believe it's our fault.

01:27:04.572 --> 01:27:05.152
There it is!

01:27:05.172 --> 01:27:07.193
Oh my gosh, they're telling us!

01:27:09.255 --> 01:27:10.896
They told us with this analogy.

01:27:10.956 --> 01:27:12.197
Holy shit, can you see it?

01:27:15.419 --> 01:27:16.500
Engineered failure.

01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:21.063
Are we gonna be as dumb as the chimp and not figure it out?

01:27:21.123 --> 01:27:22.144
Do you see this?

01:27:22.924 --> 01:27:25.026
Do you see this, how cool this is?

01:27:25.046 --> 01:27:30.069
Stop it.

01:27:32.892 --> 01:27:34.593
Do you see how cool this is?

01:27:34.973 --> 01:27:37.594
They are actually telling us right here.

01:27:39.095 --> 01:27:51.040
The message is implanted in the movie from the beginning when they showed us this problem where the chimp can't seem to figure out that the thing is rigged against him.

01:27:53.741 --> 01:28:01.285
We actually have to figure out that civilization has been rigged against us all along, or at least for the last hundred years or so, certainly for the last 50.

01:28:03.894 --> 01:28:27.106
And once we start to realize that civilization has been rigged, then we will realize that the whole depopulation was a myth, the whole overpopulation is a myth, and maybe even the, you know, everything is just one big malevolent show designed to take the reins of the evolution of the species

01:28:28.982 --> 01:28:41.074
and to have our grandchildren be hopelessly, blissfully unaware of their enslavement by a mythology about their biology, a mythology about their world.

01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:54.848
Oh my goodness, and about the dominance of the techno state that's making all the fuel with engineered biofuels and stuff like that.

01:28:54.928 --> 01:29:12.863
Boy, I guess if pharmaceutical companies make 50 billion a year and ExxonMobil makes 700 billion a year, then I guess it makes sense that the Human Genome Project would try to go into biofuels rather than pharmaceuticals, don't you think?

01:29:14.991 --> 01:29:21.072
It would make sense that the human genome project would go that way, that all the genome project is going that way.

01:29:21.172 --> 01:29:21.453
Why?

01:29:21.533 --> 01:29:23.213
Because it's all one signal.

01:29:24.813 --> 01:29:33.976
They know in their heart of hearts that there's no divorcing us from the bacteria and the bacteriophages that they communicate with and interact with each other with.

01:29:34.716 --> 01:29:39.317
There's no getting rid of that background signal, that we are dependent on that background signal.

01:29:39.357 --> 01:29:40.657
We are symbiotic with it.

01:29:40.697 --> 01:29:43.958
Perhaps we are even an emergent property of it.

01:29:46.516 --> 01:30:12.911
which is all part of this, you know, the reason why this evolutionary phylogeny is just dumb when it's tied to molecules and enzymes, which is what they do to tell us this story that we all share a chemistry and therefore we're all just basically spontaneous chemical interactions that happen on a rock that's a certain distance from a star and everything else just happened to happen.

01:30:17.603 --> 01:30:20.304
Understand, we can figure it out.

01:30:21.184 --> 01:30:22.225
We can figure it out.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:27.466
Why the task is unsolvable.

01:30:41.371 --> 01:30:43.132
I mean, he's saying it right there.

01:30:43.942 --> 01:30:50.245
The chimp argument, the guy who argued with us or told us this story said that chimps can't do it, only kids can do it.

01:30:50.765 --> 01:30:52.206
That chimp's doing it right there.

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:55.468
He's looking in the camera saying, this one doesn't do it, that one does do it.

01:30:55.488 --> 01:30:56.528
You guys are fooling me.

01:30:58.209 --> 01:31:01.030
He's telling a story that doesn't even make sense.

01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:02.291
It's not even true.

01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:05.773
He's essentially a liar and he has to be a liar.

01:31:05.853 --> 01:31:06.133
Why?

01:31:06.193 --> 01:31:08.594
Because otherwise his research wouldn't get funded.

01:31:11.121 --> 01:31:14.622
Because he would not have identified something that chimps can't do.

01:31:16.503 --> 01:31:19.284
Yes, I'm making an accusation and I bet it's right.

01:31:21.164 --> 01:31:27.526
That if you give them a long enough time or enough experience with it, they would definitely show you signs that they know something's fucked up.

01:31:27.946 --> 01:31:29.447
Maybe they're just more persistent.

01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:35.468
And a human child is more apt to just start crying or give up and go somewhere else.

01:31:35.509 --> 01:31:37.149
Have you ever thought of that possibility?

01:31:38.469 --> 01:31:40.210
That neuroscientist apparently hasn't.

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:43.958
Don't let this fool you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:43.978 --> 01:31:45.159
We are really winning.

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:46.720
We are winning like crazy.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.924
And if you do anything else today, you should definitely watch Mark's show from this morning.

01:31:53.025 --> 01:31:54.246
It's really extraordinary.

01:31:54.266 --> 01:31:55.787
And it'll make you feel like this monkey.

01:31:57.589 --> 01:31:58.670
It'll make you want to get out.

01:32:08.737 --> 01:32:09.818
It'll make you want to get out.

01:32:10.578 --> 01:32:11.919
Get off of social media.

01:32:12.279 --> 01:32:13.240
You can't win there.

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:14.001
It's rigged.

01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:15.562
That's the whole point.

01:32:18.003 --> 01:32:19.064
I don't know what to say, guys.

01:32:19.104 --> 01:32:21.966
I think we're really... Oh, I was already in there.

01:32:22.006 --> 01:32:22.427
That's right.

01:32:22.447 --> 01:32:24.108
This is a current slide.

01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:24.848
Thanks very much.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:28.891
I've got a little music to play and then I'll be back for closing.

01:32:28.971 --> 01:32:33.594
So if you've got other things to do, I understand that you wouldn't stay around for this.

01:32:34.175 --> 01:32:34.875
I totally get it.

01:32:35.776 --> 01:32:36.837
Thanks very much for being here.

01:32:36.857 --> 01:32:37.397
See you in a minute.

01:35:55.949 --> 01:35:55.990
Mm.

01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:48.331
so

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.821
about pandemic.

01:39:31.702 --> 01:39:38.847
And Stephen, your immunology professor said very good, because the question was very good.

01:39:39.647 --> 01:39:50.375
And of course, as I've been trying to say for four years now, there is no pandemic, there was no pandemic, and there will be no pandemic.

01:39:51.076 --> 01:39:51.176
And

01:39:54.213 --> 01:39:57.496
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

01:39:57.737 --> 01:39:58.197
It can't.

01:39:58.818 --> 01:40:02.582
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

01:40:02.602 --> 01:40:07.687
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

01:40:09.949 --> 01:40:13.833
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:40:15.623 --> 01:40:16.363
And I have lied.

01:40:16.524 --> 01:40:17.404
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:40:17.424 --> 01:40:18.345
I don't want to lie.

01:40:18.365 --> 01:40:20.186
I don't think I'm a liar.

01:40:20.286 --> 01:40:21.326
I try not to be a liar.

01:40:21.366 --> 01:40:22.207
I don't want to be a liar.

01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:25.549
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

01:40:27.710 --> 01:40:36.555
The specializations should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

01:40:36.995 --> 01:40:38.956
And then one should be a little bit suspicious.

01:40:38.976 --> 01:40:41.498
And that's sort of my starting bias.

01:40:43.544 --> 01:40:47.666
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:40:49.447 --> 01:40:50.167
And I have lied.

01:40:50.187 --> 01:40:51.228
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:40:51.248 --> 01:40:52.168
I don't want to lie.

01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:54.009
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:40:54.129 --> 01:40:55.150
I try not to be a liar.

01:40:55.170 --> 01:40:56.030
I don't want to be a liar.

01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:59.372
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:41:04.595 --> 01:41:08.677
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:11.211
And I have lied.

01:41:11.391 --> 01:41:12.271
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:41:12.291 --> 01:41:13.212
I don't want to lie.

01:41:13.713 --> 01:41:15.054
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:41:15.154 --> 01:41:16.194
I try not to be a liar.

01:41:16.214 --> 01:41:17.075
I don't want to be a liar.

01:41:17.635 --> 01:41:20.398
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:41:25.962 --> 01:41:29.524
Ladies and gentlemen, they're all in the same script and you can't change it.

01:41:30.692 --> 01:41:31.833
None of them say murder.

01:41:31.893 --> 01:41:36.997
None of them mention that supplemental oxygen induces acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:39.939
None of them mention that ventilators were used to stop spread.

01:41:40.599 --> 01:41:48.846
None of them mention a lack of antibiotics used being murder, especially in America, especially these doctors from around the world who could, anybody could say that.

01:41:49.766 --> 01:41:59.796
And they're not saying that this multi-year opioid crisis in America is not a ignorable number, but instead oftentimes ignore it on purpose.

01:41:59.976 --> 01:42:08.964
And none of them mentioned Brandy Vaughn, even the ones that have been on stage with her and heard her very distinctly explain the difference between injection versus ingestion.

01:42:09.044 --> 01:42:10.565
Even somebody like Brian Hooker

01:42:11.266 --> 01:42:17.370
who heard me say that intramuscular injection is just plain dumb, never pointed out that Brandy Vaughn was there too.

01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:29.017
None of them have explained PCR as a fraud in terms of diagnostics, not even somebody like Brian Hooker who has 16 years experience as a genetic modifier of plants to make medicine.

01:42:29.057 --> 01:42:37.162
Yeah, very similar to them talking about in that movie we watched today about genetically modifying algae to make biofuels.

01:42:38.169 --> 01:42:49.792
no mention of the population pyramid as a problem needing solving or as a source of an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that could be used to create a mythology about something else.

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:52.633
And I think that's what they did.

01:42:52.713 --> 01:42:57.835
They did that by not saying murder, by not mentioning any of these things.

01:42:58.415 --> 01:43:01.396
These people have essentially tricked a lot of adults

01:43:02.236 --> 01:43:07.263
into believing this mythology and going along with public health as the solution.

01:43:07.323 --> 01:43:11.188
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

01:43:13.015 --> 01:43:13.736
And I have lied.

01:43:13.756 --> 01:43:14.777
I'm sure I'll lie again.

01:43:14.797 --> 01:43:15.737
I don't want to lie.

01:43:16.218 --> 01:43:17.579
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

01:43:17.679 --> 01:43:18.700
I try not to be a liar.

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:19.581
I don't want to be a liar.

01:43:20.161 --> 01:43:22.904
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

01:43:23.785 --> 01:43:38.998
The nice thing about it is, is I was really starting to feel like this part of the story is now solid because you can also see the interesting connection with India, India in drastic India in the, uh,

01:43:41.497 --> 01:43:55.631
in the sort of history of Li Min Yan and India in the history of Steve Bannon, India in the history of the vaccines that Malone was brokering and that

01:43:56.124 --> 01:44:14.813
Peter Hotez was brokering and the potential for genetic and medical data from India, the potential for the continued production of goods in India as opposed to China in the decades to come, the consumers in India, the whole connection with

01:44:15.473 --> 01:44:22.196
with the guy in doing the Fomotidine trial and India and Robert Malone.

01:44:22.737 --> 01:44:30.901
It's just an overwhelming amount of evidence now suggests that this, you know, Russia, Russia, Russia, China, China, China.

01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:43.067
And the one time I got any attention from Michael Sanger and promoted by anything was because of the Scooby-Doo, which of course were to blame the lab leak on China.

01:44:43.959 --> 01:44:47.461
Were it to blame the lab leak on China, the Scooby-Doo was a great idea.

01:44:47.861 --> 01:44:53.124
Were it to blame the lab leak on North Carolina now, it would probably be okay.

01:44:53.484 --> 01:44:55.165
Because again, we're solving a mystery.

01:44:55.265 --> 01:44:57.526
Is it North Carolina and China?

01:44:58.467 --> 01:45:16.356
Seems like that would be a great outcome for a lot of these people that are interested in controlling this narrative and taking over by throwing out the FDA and reorganizing all the fundamental principles of American law around intellectual property and all to hide this scam.

01:45:17.731 --> 01:45:29.717
They just murdered people and lied about it in order to start to lay the foundation of a new mythology, a new fundamental understanding that they would be eventually giving to our grandchildren.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:33.899
This is a long-term plan to bamboozle our grandkids.

01:45:33.919 --> 01:45:35.660
A lot about isolation and purification.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.701
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:45:37.721 --> 01:45:37.941
Isolation?

01:45:39.842 --> 01:45:40.282
What was that?

01:45:40.302 --> 01:45:41.903
Isolation and purification.

01:45:43.784 --> 01:45:44.484
Of the virus?

01:45:44.564 --> 01:45:44.684
Yes.

01:45:46.052 --> 01:45:57.101
Well, you isolate a virus by finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:45:57.762 --> 01:46:02.626
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:46:03.427 --> 01:46:05.268
I don't understand what the issue is.

01:46:05.289 --> 01:46:05.769
I see.

01:46:05.949 --> 01:46:07.010
No, it depends on how they use it.

01:46:14.778 --> 01:46:17.562
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

01:46:20.086 --> 01:46:22.029
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:46:22.049 --> 01:46:28.138
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:46:28.218 --> 01:46:30.241
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

01:46:31.078 --> 01:46:46.206
So make no mistake about it, Robert Malone worked with an associate of Robert Gallo named Murray Gardner, and that's not by accident that this is all one malevolent show with people descended from all of the same

01:46:47.086 --> 01:46:51.388
essentially the same mentor chain that might even go all the way back to Hilary Koprowski.

01:46:52.228 --> 01:46:56.950
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:59.691
A spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required.

01:47:00.712 --> 01:47:06.434
It was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and lies for a couple years

01:47:07.014 --> 01:47:08.616
and lied about around the internet.

01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:09.998
That's how we got where we are.

01:47:10.018 --> 01:47:12.701
These are some of the people that I think are involved.

01:47:12.781 --> 01:47:15.164
Mark did a great show about Piper Stover today.

01:47:15.184 --> 01:47:16.725
He's got a new link on his website.

01:47:17.166 --> 01:47:19.509
It's more than these obvious players.

01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:25.676
It's the entire Western world and all the money to powers in it that are

01:47:26.156 --> 01:47:28.117
and grubbing for a place at the table.

01:47:28.657 --> 01:47:33.939
And that's why they need you to accept injection as medicine when it is in fact dumb.

01:47:34.479 --> 01:47:39.081
And that's why they have all of these, these, these organizations like Brownstone.

01:47:39.141 --> 01:47:40.862
What an awful organization.

01:47:41.222 --> 01:47:50.925
They send emails that have more than five donate links in them because you know, they need more Brownstone fellows to do, to do podcast appearances on Rumble.

01:47:51.345 --> 01:47:52.606
It's really gross.

01:47:53.772 --> 01:48:03.055
And it's all to protect the illusion of bad biology 101 that the Human Genome Project is based in that is essentially an elaborate PSYOP.

01:48:03.915 --> 01:48:12.298
I mean, the Human Genome Project was mostly salesmanship about what could be done, what will eventually happen, and it's not happened yet.

01:48:12.438 --> 01:48:23.062
And it will not happen because we are an irreducible complexity, a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time, and we know nothing about that yet.

01:48:24.829 --> 01:48:33.924
Instead, we've been told an elaborate hoax about endemicity and pathogens that can roam the world for years.

01:48:34.958 --> 01:48:39.081
And there's a fake anti-vax movement in America that has a lot of people under their spell.

01:48:39.581 --> 01:48:43.424
And this is a big, big, big problem because some of our kids are under their spell.

01:48:44.044 --> 01:48:55.172
This was a background of irreducibly complex signals that was misconstrued as some novel spread using nonspecific PCR tests to make us believe that these things were real.

01:48:55.252 --> 01:48:59.695
When in reality, what we were doing is giving them all the samples they need, all the data they needed,

01:49:00.235 --> 01:49:21.677
from all of our college kids to start using AI to try and do a first run to see if they can take the database of Epic and interface it with all that genetic data that they collected from all those college kids and figure out if they can match those database records with the genetic records because that would be a first step in terms of priming

01:49:22.177 --> 01:49:27.899
any particular machine learning algorithm to try and solve a more detailed puzzle of a similar nature.

01:49:27.959 --> 01:49:30.000
Again, remember, this is an iteration.

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:36.683
This is the next version of the solving of the game of Go, but the new game is the Human Genome Project.

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:39.304
Of course, it's not going to happen, but that's the plan they have.

01:49:39.804 --> 01:49:44.729
And they need you to believe in their ghosts and believe that you're a ghostbuster in order for this to work.

01:49:44.749 --> 01:49:46.070
So don't teach that to your kids.

01:49:47.091 --> 01:49:49.653
RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:49:49.693 --> 01:49:54.918
Transfection and transformation was always a crime and healthy people and the population pyramids do exist.

01:49:54.978 --> 01:49:55.378
Look them up.

01:49:56.359 --> 01:49:57.540
Thanks very much for being here.

01:49:57.981 --> 01:49:58.722
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:49:58.742 --> 01:50:03.566
We're probably not going to do a show like this every day anymore because it just seems like

01:50:04.827 --> 01:50:09.588
Mark and I are really now starting to scrape our face against the brick wall.

01:50:10.088 --> 01:50:19.190
And so it's not really up to us anymore to keep trying to sell you with new pieces of evidence that all just happen to line up exactly like this.

01:50:19.671 --> 01:50:21.551
Anybody could have found Piper Stover.

01:50:22.151 --> 01:50:24.832
Anybody could have done that, but only Mark did.

01:50:25.805 --> 01:50:34.531
Not Matt Crawford, or Brett Weinstein, or any of these people that knew me for five years and were trying to figure out what was going on.

01:50:34.951 --> 01:50:35.932
Who is that guy?

01:50:36.432 --> 01:50:43.276
No private investigator has ever... No George Webb exposure on... That's probably the best example.

01:50:43.336 --> 01:50:49.841
No George Webb, no John Cullen, no Kevin McCairn, no Charles Rixey expose.

01:50:50.601 --> 01:50:59.624
on Piper Stover and her connections to the CCP or to the deep state or to Craig Ventner at all, at all, at all.

01:51:00.925 --> 01:51:07.627
And that's because it's all one malevolent show, ladies and gentlemen, all one big show.

01:51:09.647 --> 01:51:10.908
And Mark and I ain't in it.
