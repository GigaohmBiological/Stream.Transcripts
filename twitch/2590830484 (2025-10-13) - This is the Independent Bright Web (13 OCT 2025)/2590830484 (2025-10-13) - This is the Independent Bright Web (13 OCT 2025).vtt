WEBVTT

00:16.698 --> 00:17.619
Do you remember Andrew Breitbart got killed?

00:17.839 --> 00:18.620
I do remember that.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.320
He got a heart attack.

00:19.340 --> 00:19.540
Exactly.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.161
He was exposing ACORN.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.184
Oh man, I'm totally blanking on our boy these days that does all the... James O'Keefe?

00:23.204 --> 00:23.444
Yeah, O'Keefe.

00:23.464 --> 00:25.726
You know that James O'Keefe got a start with Breitbart on that story exposing ACORN?

00:25.746 --> 00:28.028
And what they did is they sent James O'Keefe and this other female reporter into ACORN.

00:28.088 --> 00:29.109
And O'Keefe pretended to be a pimp.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.090
Well, they asked them for help setting up an underage sex trafficking ring.

00:31.210 --> 00:32.992
And the people at ACORN... I didn't know it was underage.

00:33.012 --> 00:33.212
Yeah, yeah.

00:33.232 --> 00:36.295
They wanted help setting up an underage sex trafficking ring using children from Guatemala or from Central America.

00:36.315 --> 00:37.095
Did they say that in the meeting?

00:37.496 --> 00:38.056
Yeah, yeah.

00:38.096 --> 00:39.117
That was what was on tape.

00:39.137 --> 00:39.377
What?

00:39.417 --> 00:39.578
Yeah.

00:39.698 --> 00:40.458
It blew my mind when I read it.

00:40.478 --> 00:41.639
I was like, what are we talking about right now?

00:43.641 --> 00:50.750
And that's that is the story is that he went in and asked for help setting up a under I don't think he Was like I don't think he was probably using the words like five-year-olds ten-year-olds I assume that he was like implying like 16 years, but I don't know but that's how do you freeze it?

00:50.970 --> 00:51.471
I don't know.

00:51.571 --> 00:52.752
It's not you can't I mean, I can't find those videos anymore.

00:52.772 --> 00:53.553
I've loved I'm sure they're somewhere.

00:53.573 --> 00:56.236
I'm sure that James O'Keefe could tell the story what happened with him and Project Veritas I don't know.

00:56.577 --> 00:56.897
I have no idea.

00:56.917 --> 01:01.723
It's a whole drama fest and I try to stay I mean I usually stay out of the drama in the modern industry because it's like it'll just wait drama.

01:01.783 --> 01:02.624
There's drama inside the drama.

01:02.644 --> 01:03.405
There's drama in every industry.

01:03.425 --> 01:04.186
There's drama in the drama class

01:04.326 --> 01:06.787
But yeah, he went in and asked for help setting up this ring, and they allegedly said, yeah, here's how you do it.

01:06.807 --> 01:07.728
We'll help you, we'll help you, we'll help you.

01:07.748 --> 01:10.229
And that's what the case they brought against Acorn was, before Andrew Breitbart mysteriously died.

01:10.249 --> 01:11.829
And then the coroner that did his autopsy mysteriously died.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.210
That was such a weird one to stumble upon, because I didn't know I was about to stumble upon it.

01:14.691 --> 01:16.592
Everyone should look up anything that I say, always.

01:16.612 --> 01:19.193
People should always just look it up and just start typing things in that I'm saying, and see if you can figure out what you think.

01:19.353 --> 01:19.973
Because I am not an expert.

01:19.993 --> 01:20.833
I'm just a dude that is looking things up.

01:20.853 --> 01:21.754
And I try to be really thorough.

01:21.774 --> 01:26.136
But like, wasn't Breitbart, was it Breitbart or Drudge that was the first victim of these coordinated anti-advertising campaigns?

01:26.656 --> 01:27.577
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.

01:27.597 --> 01:29.519
Oh, like where advertisers all pull out to try and tank you?

01:29.659 --> 01:29.879
Exactly.

01:29.899 --> 01:30.139
I don't know.

01:30.159 --> 01:30.880
They do it strategically.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.261
I think it was done to both probably, but I don't know.

01:32.361 --> 01:34.703
But I think the first one, the first one that they did it on, I think it was Breitbart.

01:34.723 --> 01:38.547
I think Breitbart was on this like super rapid upward trajectory and they just completely tanked the revenue.

01:38.567 --> 01:39.568
Was it Breitbart or was it, do you remember Jamie?

01:39.688 --> 01:40.368
Who was talking to us about that?

01:40.388 --> 01:40.849
Was it Chase Hughes?

01:41.289 --> 01:41.529
Who was it?

01:42.210 --> 01:58.375
it might have been it is interesting how you can watch out over history the more history you learn the more you get to see where certain strategies like kind of like deep state strategies so to speak or intelligence agency strategies get invented and then they start using it might be mike ben's that would be a mike ben's thing to say for sure he knows this shit yeah okay right bar plus 90 of its advertisers in two months that's what it is yeah who's still there so this was so this is the washington post making it seem like this is a normal thing

01:58.775 --> 01:59.795
Oh look, they lost all their advertising.

01:59.815 --> 02:00.776
People pulled out because they're full of shit.

02:00.796 --> 02:01.456
It's just another frame game.

02:01.476 --> 02:04.117
No, they all coordinated to try to boycott them and kill them.

02:04.337 --> 02:07.278
It's so crazy to have all of these tactics exposed in plain view now, and they still keep trying them.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.700
Did you see the thing that's going around today of the 22 different mainstream news sites all parodying the exact same thing?

02:10.740 --> 02:10.900
Yes.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.320
Well, not just that.

02:11.360 --> 02:11.940
All the Congress people.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.100
Yeah.

02:12.120 --> 02:12.461
Do you see that?

02:12.521 --> 02:13.381
They're all saying the exact same thing.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.741
Yeah, I guess it's Congress people, not news anchors.

02:14.781 --> 02:17.803
No, it's fucking Pelosi and Schumer and all these different people.

02:17.823 --> 02:19.743
There's 12 of them now that they've got saying the exact same script.

02:19.763 --> 02:20.164
Oh, it's more than 12.

02:20.204 --> 02:21.844
Alex Jones had a full 22 on his show, so they kept adding to it.

02:21.864 --> 02:22.405
At first, it was two of them.

02:22.565 --> 02:23.045
They're so dumb.

02:23.065 --> 02:23.985
They all read the same script.

02:24.145 --> 02:24.605
They're so dumb.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.866
But they use a different tone of voice.

02:25.886 --> 02:25.946
But

02:28.507 --> 02:36.092
Yeah, but then you get into the people they're like the whole world's a stage trust the plan cues in control and it's like Well, then when you see a documentary on cue you realize what kind of people you're dealing with Which documentary do you see it was a really cool HBO thing?

02:36.252 --> 02:43.177
Yeah I don't like trust a documentary like that either cuz like HBO is like that's the definition of mainstream media So I try to say somewhere in the middle of that that is true But I think HBO let this guy uncover this story accurately.

02:43.277 --> 02:54.684
I think I saw I did see the documentary Yeah, it's like a multi-part and it shows all the people that were involved in it and it kind of highlights a guy who seems to be Q who is like kind of an internet shit poster fucking around and When 4chan was in its heyday back when all that shit was going down like it's ripe for that kind of nonsense

02:54.804 --> 03:04.074
Yeah, perfect perfect fertile ground for that kind of like controlled reverse opposition whatever bullshits I ops and that's where for me the bottom line is can I corroborate with primary sources and Q is a definition of No, of course, right It's like what is it a time traveler that's coming back to telling us how to save the world or something?

03:04.094 --> 03:16.647
I don't understand stuff like pizza gate like when they when they have that guy come in and I felt like that was a great way to put a halt to all the looking into the best email that was because then all the sudden it's a kook thing now It's a crazy person and a dangerous person because he's got a gun you're causing dangerous people to take

03:16.647 --> 03:17.467
They're just like with the vaccines.

03:17.487 --> 03:18.368
It's like you're it's a danger.

03:18.388 --> 03:23.390
They always have to make danger Yeah, it's dangerous to say that this might have side effects right those emails exactly right those emails are bananas.

03:23.510 --> 03:33.893
They're not explained They're talking about young kids are going to be coming to a party to have fun They're talking in the pool and I'll be there for sure Sixty-five thousand dollars worth of hot dogs flown from Chicago for a White House party it the whole thing is like very weird Did you ever see the archived Instagram post from James Alphonsus Instagram?

03:34.314 --> 03:37.795
No, that's a dark place So that there's so many layers of pizza gate that they tried to cover up intentionally for very good reason How about the logos?

03:38.035 --> 04:01.038
Well, the thing is I avoid in the way the way I've talked about I've avoided all the symbols and logos and even some of the pizza stuff because I think there's so much more ripe clear evidence that way more powerful and James Alfonso's Instagram account is a great example where we can find online so you cannot find on Instagram anymore It's only been archived on to other sites which is kind of sketchy because it's like how do I know you're not adding photos and stuff so I kind of have to dig and dig and dig and cross-reference over and over and over to make sure that you're getting sort of like the Consensus because everyone watched as it happened So people like Liz Croak and people like Alex like they saw these things come out and that you can't find plenty different archives of all of James Alfonso's Instagram posts and there are things like photos of children with their arms taped to tables and the action is looks like a fun time

04:01.158 --> 04:06.000
And then people that have always been commenting on his posts, like the people that are interacting with his posts all the time, have even weirder Instagrams where it's like a kill room and there's a coffin that's open and things like that.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.402
There's like a photo of like a walk-in freezer and it's like, man, it looks like you've been having a fun weekend.

04:09.502 --> 04:12.703
Things like that that are just super dark and a bunch of babies and a bunch of symbolism, a bunch of children.

04:12.883 --> 04:14.584
And it's all photos on their Instagram in plain daylight.

04:14.704 --> 04:15.465
And it all got scrapped, obviously.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.405
And that's not to mention Podesta's art collection and the Marina Abramovich connections.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.486
It goes on and on and on and on and on.

04:21.572 --> 04:27.196
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

04:27.456 --> 04:33.400
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

04:34.301 --> 04:38.544
Well, I guess I would ask myself, I mean, I lie.

04:39.124 --> 04:41.226
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

04:41.246 --> 04:43.227
I really try not to.

04:43.247 --> 04:46.189
I try never to lie on TV.

04:46.209 --> 04:46.990
I don't like lying.

04:47.110 --> 04:50.172
I certainly do it out of weakness or whatever.

04:51.313 --> 04:56.938
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

04:57.198 --> 05:03.143
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

05:04.064 --> 05:08.287
Well, I guess I would ask myself, I mean, I lie.

05:08.888 --> 05:10.990
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.011
I really try not to.

05:13.692 --> 05:14.933
I try never to lie on TV.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.734
I just don't, I don't like lying.

05:16.874 --> 05:19.917
I certainly do it out of weakness or whatever.

05:22.541 --> 05:25.223
A condition that we will not call autism.

05:25.403 --> 05:26.944
I don't like the word autism.

05:27.844 --> 05:28.965
He was vaccine damaged.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.686
He was neurologically damaged.

05:31.446 --> 05:34.108
A condition that we will not call autism.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.829
I don't like the word autism.

05:36.709 --> 05:37.650
He was vaccine damaged.

05:39.603 --> 05:42.285
A condition that we will not call autism.

05:42.446 --> 05:44.808
I don't like the word autism.

05:44.888 --> 05:45.988
He was vaccine damaged.

05:46.309 --> 05:47.730
He was neurologically damaged.

05:48.471 --> 05:51.173
A condition that we will not call autism.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.874
I don't like the word autism.

05:53.775 --> 05:54.836
He was vaccine damaged.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.258
and and

06:47.688 --> 06:47.828
you

07:03.370 --> 07:04.311
so so

07:35.333 --> 07:35.373
So...

08:00.781 --> 08:00.901
So,

08:25.359 --> 08:25.419
you.

09:19.693 --> 09:25.320
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

09:25.981 --> 09:35.347
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and you know, it's, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles.

09:35.407 --> 09:38.209
Cause you know, not that many people die from it.

09:38.509 --> 09:47.275
It's, it's just a big hassle in the end, but no, when, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and.

09:50.013 --> 09:59.365
uh it it's not it's there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be

10:09.102 --> 10:12.403
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

10:12.623 --> 10:13.103
It can't.

10:13.723 --> 10:17.484
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

10:18.384 --> 10:22.545
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.966
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

10:28.186 --> 10:28.666
It can't.

10:29.286 --> 10:33.027
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

10:33.047 --> 10:38.048
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

10:39.787 --> 10:40.287
Actually, J.J.

10:40.307 --> 10:46.972
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

10:47.732 --> 10:48.233
Actually, J.J.

10:48.253 --> 10:54.897
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

10:57.979 --> 10:59.540
I think truth is good for kids.

10:59.980 --> 11:03.703
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

11:04.283 --> 11:05.944
We want everybody to feel good.

11:06.324 --> 11:08.006
That's not the way life is.

11:11.018 --> 11:11.098
you

12:18.616 --> 12:38.471
Last night in Little Rock, but made a haze Sweet, sweet Connie, doing her act She had the whole show and that's a natural fact Up all night with Freddie King I got to tell ya, poker's his thing

13:16.829 --> 13:18.430
Feeling good, feeling right.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.570
It's Saturday night.

13:20.111 --> 13:23.372
The hotel detective, he was on his side.

13:23.732 --> 13:27.634
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan.

13:28.154 --> 13:31.155
They was out to meet the boys in the band.

13:31.216 --> 13:33.076
They say, come on, dudes.

13:33.997 --> 13:34.997
Let's get on.

13:35.097 --> 13:38.919
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down.

15:06.809 --> 15:14.374
Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, good night, wherever you are on this great little tiny planet of ours.

15:14.674 --> 15:15.374
Welcome to the show.

15:15.394 --> 15:22.199
This is GigaOM Biological, the high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

15:22.299 --> 15:23.600
It is Rocktober.

15:24.720 --> 15:31.808
And I'm screwing up all my slides and all my fades and all my nothing.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.289
And why did I push that one?

15:34.831 --> 15:40.777
Let's see, I want that and then I wanted this and then yes, that's what I wanted.

15:40.797 --> 15:44.041
Then I can't see what's coming next.

15:44.121 --> 15:44.521
Here we go.

15:45.635 --> 15:56.324
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon if you're somewhere in Europe, good evening and good morning, good morning if you're still on the east or the west coast of the United States.

15:56.344 --> 16:01.729
Welcome to the show, this is GigaOM Biological coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in Eastern Standard Time.

16:02.409 --> 16:03.549
Or is it daylight savings?

16:03.689 --> 16:04.009
I don't know.

16:04.049 --> 16:04.490
Who cares?

16:05.070 --> 16:14.012
I know for sure my clocks say 1133 AM, which makes me somewhere between 20 minutes and an hour and 20 minutes late, depending on what schedule you're following.

16:14.472 --> 16:16.573
Maybe you even got a notification today.

16:16.593 --> 16:19.694
We're trying to get this train back running on schedule.

16:20.534 --> 16:21.094
But it's tough.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.655
But this is the right now show.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.955
That means we can pretty much do it whenever we can.

16:24.995 --> 16:26.176
And so we're going to do it right now.

16:27.036 --> 16:28.296
The RFK Jr.

16:28.356 --> 16:30.677
enchantment is starting to crumble.

16:31.457 --> 16:44.920
and those of you who might be still fully engaged in this idea that America is about to come to some realization about the vaccine schedule or public health or health freedom and nutrition,

16:45.933 --> 16:49.734
You're in for a very rude awakening because it's not a 50-50 split.

16:50.614 --> 16:53.975
The vast majority of Americans think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:54.235 --> 16:58.636
and this whole Maha movement is pretty much a bunch of nuts.

16:59.417 --> 17:00.397
And we're in big trouble.

17:01.117 --> 17:07.239
We're in very big trouble right now because the stage is about to flip.

17:07.799 --> 17:09.360
The scenery's about to change.

17:10.201 --> 17:17.588
And this is a transition that's going to occur over a time horizon, a time scale that's going to be hard to perceive.

17:17.648 --> 17:30.280
But over the next few years, and I mean that, over the next few years, the transition from a 50-50 divide in America that's roughly split between a blue and a red hat team,

17:30.920 --> 17:43.115
is going to vanish and it's going to become increasingly more obvious that it is a small minority of people that they are going to focus their ire on with regard to all

17:44.850 --> 18:02.514
of the recent trials and tribulations that are loosely associated with America and COVID and pandemics and gain of function and bioweapons and national security state objectives, lies about geopolitics, this kind of thing.

18:02.954 --> 18:10.336
It's all one great big imaginary millstone that weighs tons and tons in the minds of many, many

18:10.956 --> 18:18.345
people on earth and that millstone is tied squarely around the neck of the United States of America.

18:18.406 --> 18:28.558
The United States of America is going to be controlled, demolished in the minds of all the humans that are currently using social media in a skillful manner.

18:29.662 --> 18:51.041
the people that are using social media in a skillful manner in the EU will be led to believe that the EU is great and still doing okay while the rampant mixing and immigration that's occurring without real any... I mean, it's just... the project is to destroy.

18:52.037 --> 18:59.119
They had a very nice little community of, you know, 13 or 14 countries with 13 or 14 currencies.

18:59.199 --> 19:07.581
And now they have one currency, they have one bureaucracy that's completely unaccountable to any of the citizens of that entire system.

19:08.621 --> 19:16.103
And what that EU bureaucracy does is essentially regulating the individual nations out of existence.

19:17.890 --> 19:29.400
And it's just inexplainable that we have someone as treacherous and awful and publicly unappealing as that German woman at the head of the EU for as long as she's been.

19:29.801 --> 19:36.506
It's absolutely absurd that we have somebody like Mark Rutte at the head of NATO.

19:37.027 --> 19:44.193
This guy is nothing more than an elaborate puppet who comes from a tiny little country run by

19:45.294 --> 19:47.935
by large money for a very long time.

19:48.955 --> 20:08.563
The Netherlands was one of the cornerstone countries in the formation of the EU, was critical in their gratifying of the EU treaty, basically brought it into existence, and their country alone could have ended any real, genuine EU coming into existence.

20:10.700 --> 20:18.385
And Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands was killed because he didn't want to join the Euro, he didn't want to join the EU.

20:19.645 --> 20:31.753
And they tell you in the Netherlands that some kind of animal rights activist shot Pim Fortuyn, and we know that's not true, but that animal rights activist is now free in the Netherlands, he's just a citizen who rides the train now.

20:32.711 --> 20:42.457
But he shot and killed a politician in the Netherlands and basically allowed the EU to come into formation.

20:44.779 --> 20:56.586
That's how close they were at one point to avoiding the trap that they are now in, where somehow or another, a completely unaccountable bureaucracy is destroying all of their countries at once.

20:59.830 --> 21:12.877
And so it's still very likely that something like that is going to come into existence in North America in the form of an Amero, in the form of a North American trade union or a North American union in general.

21:13.798 --> 21:20.582
That could be for a wide variety of reasons, maybe because some of the states in America start to break down from

21:21.162 --> 21:23.063
with lack of civil order.

21:23.604 --> 21:27.726
Maybe because Canada collapses, maybe because Mexico becomes a lawless state.

21:28.106 --> 21:37.972
There are lots of different ways that this kind of dissolving of national borders and making individual nations irrelevant could be done.

21:38.913 --> 21:39.853
And it is being done.

21:41.594 --> 21:47.478
And so while we are arguing about who killed who, or who didn't kill who, or who got shot from which direction,

21:49.833 --> 21:57.516
These plans are going ahead as scheduled on time frames that are almost invisible on social media's time frame.

21:58.476 --> 22:07.200
And that's really the reason why I think as much as I want to teach the biology on my stream, I think I have to focus on getting that book done and out.

22:08.280 --> 22:14.923
Because right now the main message that we only have really one more chance to get out is that, that

22:16.997 --> 22:31.989
It's kind of like the Dune message, you know, the idea that if men turn over their decisions to machines, then in reality what you do is you turn over your decisions to other men with machines.

22:33.330 --> 22:39.976
And once we start allowing social media to play a significant role in determining how we

22:40.990 --> 22:58.205
go about our daily business, how we interpret our world, how we vote, how we think, how we teach our children, choices that we make, then we have surrendered our sovereignty to other men with machines.

22:58.825 --> 23:02.629
And we have to pull back from this reality, we really do.

23:03.376 --> 23:06.217
And that's going to mean some very hard choices.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.638
It's going to mean everybody getting off of social media.

23:09.098 --> 23:13.900
It may even mean that everybody's going to have to get rid of the phone in the way that they use it.

23:15.401 --> 23:21.243
Um, you may just have to strip your phone down to the very, very basics and have an app free phone.

23:21.363 --> 23:28.545
I don't even know how possible that is, but I do know that potentially a great big market could be created for such a device.

23:29.646 --> 23:29.746
Um,

23:30.542 --> 23:34.664
I think all of these things are really important to discuss as we move forward in the future.

23:35.164 --> 23:53.871
And the most important thing is to start discussing these things with our children so that we make these plans together as a team, as a community, so that we build the future that we want rather than accepting the futures, one of the futures that social media offers us.

23:54.691 --> 23:56.353
the bad one or the really bad one.

23:56.593 --> 24:02.418
That's really the kind of sort of acquiescence that we have to stop.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.063
Apathy is what's gonna break this more than anything else right now.

24:27.796 --> 24:30.757
I'll say one other thing about Tylenol, only because of this.

24:31.797 --> 24:39.338
This morning before I came in here, somebody showed me a TikTok video of a pregnant woman, eight months pregnant.

24:39.578 --> 24:40.618
She is an associate.

24:40.738 --> 24:41.378
What time is it?

24:41.438 --> 24:44.459
Holy cow.

24:44.499 --> 24:45.119
Sorry about that.

24:45.179 --> 24:45.799
I blew that one.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.999
I'll say one other thing about Tylenol, only because of this.

24:49.040 --> 24:56.981
This morning before I came in here, somebody showed me a. So I thought I'd start with this video because I think this video allows me to make a point.

24:58.240 --> 25:04.866
This video, I think, is a PBS News video, but it's not a video that they used in their main broadcast.

25:04.946 --> 25:06.888
It's a video that they put up on their website.

25:08.200 --> 25:22.728
which again allows the natural, natural programming of YouTube to offer this video to people who will want to watch it and not offer it to people who aren't interested in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:22.748 --> 25:31.033
And they can discern that pretty readily with just the previous click history of users, especially those who have actually registered and signed in.

25:32.074 --> 25:32.374
And so,

25:33.877 --> 25:56.054
This might seem like the forwarding of information and the unbelievable access that we have to all of the things that people say and do in Congress and in our government, but what it actually represents is a fire hose through which you can see what you want to see, but more importantly, the military-industrial complex can show you what it wants to show you.

25:57.254 --> 26:03.079
And in this case, the military-industrial complex is trying to control, demolish America by

26:04.602 --> 26:13.106
creating a fractionization of our national identity in the youth and in the old and in the middle-aged and in our kids.

26:14.947 --> 26:21.950
The idea is to make us ashamed of our country, to make us confused about it, to make us not understand it, to make us not believe in it.

26:23.091 --> 26:25.932
And to a large extent, that may have already been accomplished.

26:26.752 --> 26:32.093
But right now, the stage that we're at is still one of inaction.

26:32.193 --> 26:34.234
It's still one of bewilderment.

26:34.334 --> 26:36.814
It's still one where everybody's so shocked.

26:37.494 --> 26:41.615
Still, again, shocked on a time scale that's not social media shocked.

26:42.135 --> 26:44.096
It's not home alone shocked.

26:44.176 --> 26:54.698
It's how you feel every day when you wake up in the morning and how you feel as you move through your day, how you feel right before you open your phone or right before you check your email.

26:54.758 --> 26:55.398
That is,

26:56.368 --> 27:00.392
the state of stress that they've created in a lot of people.

27:00.452 --> 27:15.367
And now I will admit, I don't feel particularly good when I wake up every morning and think about the country that we live in and the people that we're surrounded by, but not because I have any particular spite for them, but because I see us as trapped.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.829
I see us as confused.

27:16.889 --> 27:19.692
And I see that as a very dangerous state for all of us to be in.

27:21.854 --> 27:24.116
but I don't see it as something that can't be reversed.

27:24.176 --> 27:49.538
I don't see it as something that isn't also an opportunity for us, an opportunity for the good guys to pull our heads out and come to a collective realization that we have been completely fooled by our skilled use of social media into believing that that guy is a real dude, that that guy is a real dude, that that guy isn't or is a real dude.

27:51.118 --> 27:52.980
And that's the real magic of it, right?

27:53.020 --> 27:55.762
Because most people on the left would agree that he's a real guy.

27:55.822 --> 28:02.268
They might not like him, but they would probably not argue that he's smart or that he's sitting there and he's rich for a reason.

28:02.769 --> 28:03.669
Same with this guy.

28:04.330 --> 28:09.535
Very, very few people on the left are going to say that this is just an outright scripted fraud.

28:11.451 --> 28:17.296
And very few people on the right would say that this guy is a scripted fraud.

28:17.336 --> 28:21.219
But what if, in reality, they're all scripted frauds?

28:21.259 --> 28:24.782
They're all sitting in those chairs knowing that they're performing.

28:25.303 --> 28:30.727
And they are performing a very, very big service to the people above them in the hierarchy.

28:32.749 --> 28:38.634
Because it's like a prerequisite before you pass on to the level that Obama is now at.

28:43.174 --> 28:56.120
And this, I think, is the real extraordinary thing to see here, that there is no... there is no... real thing that we see on social media.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.220
There just simply isn't.

28:57.320 --> 29:05.064
There is this theater that's being performed, and once you see it as a theater, all of their mannerisms make sense.

29:07.476 --> 29:22.795
and once you see it as some people have been brought on stage long ago and they don't even understand it anymore they just think that this is the way the machine works and they're happy to be a part of it you know like somebody who gets to do a commercial for a toothpaste

29:23.596 --> 29:29.119
After they've been an actor with a SAG card for 10 years and then they finally get a national commercial.

29:29.619 --> 29:32.060
They don't care if it's a toothpaste they use or not.

29:32.740 --> 29:39.023
It could be a toothpaste that tastes like cinnamon and they could think cinnamon tastes like the worst taste ever.

29:39.784 --> 29:41.104
And they would do that commercial.

29:41.965 --> 29:44.626
Because for their whole life they have wanted to be an actor.

29:45.282 --> 29:47.964
They have wanted to be the center of the theater.

29:48.444 --> 29:52.226
And they understand theater is just, you know, it's a stage that you get on.

29:52.366 --> 29:56.729
Just like playing in a high school basketball game is a stage that you get on.

29:56.789 --> 30:09.877
And so if you really like that stage and you really like what you do on the stage, then there's no reason to explain why you want to dedicate a serious amount of your time to playing basketball in the hopes of maybe getting a scholarship or even being an NBA player.

30:11.587 --> 30:16.968
And so is it that crazy to think that there are also people who grow up wanting to be a part of a theater?

30:17.968 --> 30:19.989
Wanting to be a part of a governance theater?

30:20.049 --> 30:24.389
Wanting to be a part of a theater once they understand that the theater exists in this manner?

30:28.170 --> 30:30.971
Once they understand that rich people rule that way?

30:33.591 --> 30:37.672
Is it very hard to imagine why they too would want to be a part of that theater?

30:39.898 --> 30:42.739
Demonstrate that they can be useful in that theater.

30:46.321 --> 31:01.929
And then think about all the unwitting people that get sucked up into that theater as secretaries or as aides or as interns that believe these people are real rather than scripted military complex actors.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.351
People on a script that they've trusted for years.

31:07.489 --> 31:18.854
Because that's, again, the part that the Cywar thing with Michael Flynn's book, the Cywar thing with Robert Malone's book, these are not by accident.

31:21.915 --> 31:32.059
We are actually being controlled by scripted actors on social media, many of whom are scripted by the National Security State, because very little is left to chance.

31:32.964 --> 31:37.869
This is not a small potatoes organization here.

31:37.949 --> 31:47.618
This is the country, the government, the military industrial complex that has more or less ruled the globe for quite some time.

31:47.718 --> 31:53.244
So the operation of this machine has not been left to pure chance and the election.

31:54.815 --> 32:23.184
I assure you, now I didn't always think this way, but as a 53 year old man now, after all the experience I've had during COVID and all the experience I've had with people like him, I don't think there's any other conclusion to come to except that we have been governed for quite some time by people on a national security script, acting, playing a role, creating dramas, enacting dramas with predestined outcomes.

32:25.336 --> 32:53.608
with predestined arguments that kind of lead people into a sort of, you know, if everything else is contradictory and this one thing is, it seems to be agreed on by everybody, then everybody subconsciously grabs onto that because it's like your brain is falling in free space in the dark and you reaching out for one handhold and you, as soon as you hear, hold onto a branch, you're going to hold onto it.

32:56.940 --> 33:00.123
And you're gonna hold on as hard as you can because you know you're falling.

33:01.604 --> 33:05.528
And so, from a psychological perspective, what they've done with Donald Trump...

33:06.727 --> 33:35.446
Trump derangement syndrome what they've done with Biden and whether or not he's real or not what they've done with the the the comedy routine that was Kamala Harris is confused people to such an extent that the small tiny little seeming to be logically connected things are the only things that they have to hold on to and So that's what they hold on to

33:37.093 --> 33:42.875
They can be almost sure that something bad is happening in Israel to some people in Gaza.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.435
They can be almost sure of it.

33:45.736 --> 33:51.418
They can be almost sure that Donald Trump is a bad guy, or almost sure that Donald Trump is a good guy.

33:51.438 --> 33:55.799
They can be almost sure that there was a pandemic, because everybody agrees are.

33:55.819 --> 34:04.282
They can be almost sure that the vaccine wasn't always bad, because everything, they can be almost sure that vaccine injuries are quite rare.

34:05.973 --> 34:11.495
Everything else is up for grabs though, because you know, who knows if Charlie Kirk is dead or not.

34:11.555 --> 34:14.617
Who knows if the dollar's really gonna collapse or not.

34:14.637 --> 34:15.557
Are we really in debt?

34:15.597 --> 34:16.037
I don't know.

34:16.117 --> 34:17.598
I mean, it's just hard to tell.

34:17.658 --> 34:19.318
There's nothing, no real good signs.

34:19.379 --> 34:22.120
I mean, is Larry Ellison really as rich as they say?

34:22.180 --> 34:22.620
I don't know.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.160
Elon Musk, I don't know.

34:28.862 --> 34:32.124
This is the heart of the storm right now, the calm.

34:33.004 --> 34:43.990
and we can come together with our neighbors and with our children and we can understand this for the malevolent military industrial theater that it is.

34:44.010 --> 34:47.632
So the whole point here is that

34:57.188 --> 35:14.777
either right it doesn't matter but the best case scenario is this guy has been lied to for his whole life and is fooled and is on a script and isn't sophisticated enough to know how much of a fool he looks like right now and he also believes that tiktok videos are always real

35:17.102 --> 35:29.188
And if there's one TikTok video, then that means that this phenomenon of, you know, professors at medical schools taking heaps of Tylenol while they're pregnant is a very common phenomenon.

35:31.837 --> 35:59.998
the alternative is he is a scripted actor who has been scripted to say that to say that one tick-tock video is evidence of a Larger phenomenon and that's a good way to use social media evidence that social media is a accurate reflection of what's happening in people's minds and also, of course all the other crap that comes along with the the incompetent and and sort of

36:01.218 --> 36:04.439
It's just ridiculous things that this man says no.

36:07.120 --> 36:13.722
And she is saying F Trump and gobbling Tylenol with her baby in her placenta.

36:15.203 --> 36:23.065
And the level of Trump derangement syndrome has now- The baby in her placenta.

36:23.145 --> 36:26.947
So, uh.

36:27.387 --> 36:29.608
Clearly Bobby Kennedy is not a doctor.

36:31.440 --> 36:35.291
political landscapes and it is now in the realm of pathology.

36:38.644 --> 37:00.837
And so Trump Derangement Syndrome, which is exemplified by the view and the cast of The View, is exemplified by Kathy Griffin holding the bloody head of Donald Trump, the Julius Caesar enacted play in New York City, and of course the Snoop Dogg video with the gun with the flag in it.

37:01.517 --> 37:19.062
Trump derangement syndrome was manufactured by a network loosely associated with Jimmy Kimmel, Joe Rogan, Steve Bannon, all of these people that go back decades with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew and Doug Stanhope.

37:19.342 --> 37:27.985
And so if you really look, you can actually see a network of people that have agreed to kind of have a long-term rivalry

37:29.312 --> 37:37.238
You know, Jimmy Kimmel's got 20 million subscribers on YouTube now as a result of this little, you know, stunt that they pulled.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.360
It's the same crew of people.

37:40.061 --> 37:42.222
It's the same crew of people.

37:43.103 --> 37:44.624
They're all playing roles.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.606
He's playing a role.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.071
Millions of years of maternal instinct.

37:54.059 --> 37:55.700
to put her baby in prison.

37:55.920 --> 38:04.526
Millions of years of maternal instinct seems to imply a lot about the time frame of evolution that Bobby knows nothing about because he's just a lawyer.

38:05.046 --> 38:08.388
All you have to do is look at the studies which you and I talked about.

38:08.408 --> 38:12.791
It's not this positive that causes autism.

38:13.627 --> 38:16.848
It's not dispositive to cause autism.

38:16.928 --> 38:24.570
Now why would a lawyer use a lawyer term in a biological context unless he's a dumbass?

38:24.730 --> 38:26.831
More importantly, a scripted dumbass.

38:27.291 --> 38:32.053
He's going to use this word three times and in my humble opinion as

38:33.064 --> 38:39.629
a reasonably well-read American adult, I just don't think that it's very clear what he means here.

38:39.749 --> 38:47.535
Again, because dispositive is not an especially powerful term in the minds of the average American.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.697
And I think that's by scripted choice.

38:50.618 --> 38:57.063
Is it an illusion he's trying to create that he's smarter than you so that you have to look up a word and then try to decide how he's using it?

38:57.703 --> 39:02.327
Or is he a lawyer who's an excellent actor?

39:03.300 --> 39:06.681
scripted to talk meaningless nonsense.

39:07.341 --> 39:14.583
It is so suggestive that anybody who takes stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible.

39:15.344 --> 39:17.244
There are 15 rodent studies.

39:17.564 --> 39:26.247
Every one of them shows, if you give it to the mother, the babies, and particularly the male babies, have profound neurological and behavioral changes.

39:27.771 --> 39:38.459
There is a study from Johns Hopkins on core blood where they divided women into three categories, those who had the least acidic benefit in their core blood and those who had the most.

39:38.579 --> 39:43.143
The ones with the most had 3.6 times the rate of autism in their children.

39:43.163 --> 39:47.967
The middle category had 2.2 times, so it's a dose-related response.

39:48.707 --> 39:53.812
And there are dozens of studies that show the countries that use the most have the highest level of autism.

39:57.235 --> 40:14.711
It's funny that none of these statistics come out on camera when it matters none of these statistics ever came out when he was in in Congress during any of his interviews when he was asked for these things when people were throwing around papers and none of these papers or none of these studies were he

40:15.331 --> 40:25.964
even remotely well referenced when, for example, Pierre Kory and Steve Kirsch were on stage representing his side against two other clowns that were scripted to be there.

40:26.825 --> 40:27.966
This is all by design.

40:27.986 --> 40:31.610
And what I want to remind you of is why I started this video in the first place.

40:32.051 --> 40:35.315
This is a video that's available in certain corners of the internet.

40:36.508 --> 40:42.572
Even though it's recorded by and posted by PBS NewsHour, only the people who need to see it will see it.

40:42.772 --> 40:46.375
Only the people who need to believe in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:46.395 --> 40:46.895
will see it.

40:46.975 --> 40:49.877
None of the people, that's the magic of it.

40:51.806 --> 40:55.488
Fresh cuts, choice cuts are how they win.

40:56.189 --> 40:58.130
Old videos of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.511
combined with new videos of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

41:01.312 --> 41:16.321
in different combinations to different people allows different groups to come to completely opposite conclusions about the heroin addict brain worm victim, about the businessman rapist, right?

41:17.329 --> 41:18.649
Do you see what's going on here?

41:19.030 --> 41:20.590
This is not by accident.

41:20.630 --> 41:25.272
This is not because the system, you know, people just voted and now we're here.

41:25.732 --> 41:27.353
That's not how this works.

41:28.313 --> 41:30.053
This is not left to chance.

41:32.354 --> 41:39.757
The only reasonable explanation for the amount of incompetence that's currently in front of us is because it's by script.

41:44.284 --> 41:47.945
that have been used, and it has the lowest autism rate in the world.

41:48.905 --> 41:50.166
This is not dispositive.

41:50.506 --> 41:51.306
It is not proof.

41:51.546 --> 41:53.206
We're doing the studies to make the proof.

41:53.906 --> 41:56.907
But in the meantime, the precautionary principle should apply.

41:56.927 --> 42:03.289
And any mother who is taking this stuff during pregnancy just to get back at Donald Trump,

42:04.250 --> 42:07.491
is doing something that is pathological.

42:08.251 --> 42:09.751
And we're seeing that across the board.

42:09.771 --> 42:15.273
I got a lot of other stuff to talk about, but I know we got... We're seeing that across the board.

42:15.913 --> 42:20.054
It's impossible to understate how stupid that statement is.

42:20.754 --> 42:23.055
A short time here, but thank you, Mr. President.

42:23.075 --> 42:24.835
You're making our country healthier again.

42:24.875 --> 42:25.475
Thank you, Bobby.

42:25.495 --> 42:31.977
Could you just say, for the record, state what the autism was, let's say, 20 years ago and what it is today?

42:37.005 --> 42:41.207
was performed, 900,000 kids were looked at.

42:41.247 --> 42:45.029
They were looking for autism in Wisconsin children.

42:45.049 --> 42:47.830
They looked at every child in Wisconsin who was eight years old.

42:48.671 --> 42:50.872
They found an autism rate of 0.7 per 10,000.

42:50.992 --> 42:54.434
So almost one in, close to one in 20,000, less than one in 10,000.

42:59.755 --> 43:14.205
Today, the autism rates are nationally at 131, but it's actually much worse than that, because California, which has the best connection system, reports an autism rate of one in every 19 children, one in every 12.5 boys.

43:14.265 --> 43:17.007
This is a national security issue.

43:17.087 --> 43:22.951
There is nothing more important, and I'm glad, I'm grateful to you, Mr. President, because you know the fact.

43:23.031 --> 43:28.855
The reason why they can sit there like this is because it is a theater.

43:30.049 --> 43:31.530
They know it's not real.

43:31.610 --> 43:36.454
You can't possibly believe this is true and then just kind of be okay about it.

43:36.474 --> 43:38.395
Let's get on with the rest of the agenda.

43:39.837 --> 43:41.598
It's just not congruent.

43:42.539 --> 43:43.740
And this is what I mean.

43:44.736 --> 43:49.660
if what you see in front of you is just not congruent and it's not congruent all the time.

43:50.360 --> 43:54.323
The sky is falling, the sky is falling, next report.

43:54.583 --> 43:58.065
Sky is falling, sky is falling, let's talk to the next person.

43:58.125 --> 44:01.248
Sky is falling, sky is falling, now a word from our sponsor.

44:01.768 --> 44:04.510
The sky is falling, there is a nuclear war coming.

44:04.590 --> 44:08.853
Sky is falling, sky is falling, a word from our sponsor.

44:10.234 --> 44:12.155
If that's the way that you talk

44:15.202 --> 44:16.723
You can't be real.

44:17.423 --> 44:30.670
If you go home to your Hollywood wife, and you go have clams with your friend from childhood, and you go on, you know, doing whatever you do, then you can't believe what you're saying is true.

44:32.022 --> 44:34.743
And the same goes for all of these scripted liars.

44:34.803 --> 44:48.809
It's just impossible to be falling asleep if this is really your job and you are actually in the helm, in the helms room of the frickin' aircraft carrier called the United States of America.

44:48.889 --> 44:50.349
That's just impossible.

44:50.629 --> 44:52.870
That's not what these people are actually doing.

44:53.391 --> 44:54.351
No way in hell.

44:57.192 --> 44:59.233
You take really to talk about this issue.

45:00.370 --> 45:06.173
You've shown courage, and you've shown leadership, and I can't thank you enough for letting me do this work.

45:06.353 --> 45:06.754
Thank you.

45:07.034 --> 45:07.634
So, think of that.

45:07.794 --> 45:15.399
One in 20,000, and now it's one in 12 for boys, one in 18, 19 for girls.

45:16.519 --> 45:22.763
So, obviously, there's something that's artificially, I think, induced, something, whether it's

45:24.352 --> 45:34.180
the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass of water like that, I mean, into a baby's body.

45:34.881 --> 45:43.708
And I've suggested get them in doses, get them in, you know, maybe 20 percent, 30 percent, but smaller, not such a big, I think,

45:44.141 --> 45:47.122
You know that, and we had certain recommendations.

45:47.363 --> 45:49.884
Is he referring to something on the table here?

45:50.464 --> 45:51.665
Is that the size?

45:52.025 --> 45:53.386
Is that what he's talking about?

45:54.086 --> 45:54.946
This size?

45:55.086 --> 45:56.167
Did that just happen?

45:56.787 --> 45:58.748
What in the hell is going on here?

45:59.869 --> 46:00.429
Wait a second.

46:00.449 --> 46:03.030
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:03.050 --> 46:05.472
Did he refer to that thing right there on the table?

46:05.512 --> 46:06.412
Take them separately.

46:07.413 --> 46:08.513
The measles is already.

46:10.554 --> 46:12.155
So obviously there's something.

46:13.260 --> 46:28.231
is something that's artificially, I think, induced something, whether it's the vaccines in terms of these massive vaccines that are twice the size of a jar like that, of a glass of water like that, I mean, into a baby's body.

46:28.952 --> 46:34.036
And I've suggested get them in doses, get them in, you know, maybe 20%.

46:34.816 --> 46:36.618
Can you not see that's just scripted dumb?

46:36.658 --> 46:40.661
There's no fricking way that anybody, that's not, that's just scripted dumb.

46:42.378 --> 46:53.980
And by saying that, in malevolent harmony with Brain Worm over there, we have a really big problem on our hands.

46:55.160 --> 47:03.882
If we can't wake our family and friends up to this clown show now, this is going to go really bad.

47:05.723 --> 47:06.623
What time is it?

47:06.723 --> 47:07.523
Game time!

47:08.635 --> 47:11.619
Wow, I don't know what to say other than it's pretty nutso.

47:11.739 --> 47:13.461
Pretty nutso, ladies and gentlemen.

47:13.521 --> 47:14.442
Welcome to the show.

47:14.522 --> 47:18.467
It's 100% full, of course.

47:18.487 --> 47:18.827
100% full.

47:18.867 --> 47:21.270
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection is dumb.

47:21.671 --> 47:22.912
RNA cannot pandemic.

47:23.533 --> 47:27.618
Transfection is a crime and autism is a myth.

47:28.755 --> 47:30.577
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, biology is the way.

47:30.617 --> 47:31.318
Welcome to the show.

47:31.338 --> 47:33.880
Giggle and Biological is part of an independent bright web.

47:33.900 --> 47:37.724
I am suggesting it's time to get off social media.

47:37.764 --> 47:39.105
I don't know when it's going to happen for me.

47:39.145 --> 47:41.047
Maybe on Halloween, I'll just stop.

47:41.968 --> 47:42.929
And you can stop with me.

47:43.009 --> 47:44.391
I don't have a Facebook page.

47:44.451 --> 47:45.992
I never had a MySpace page.

47:46.913 --> 47:50.097
I just have my own gigaohmbiological.com.

47:50.137 --> 47:52.899
I have stream.gigaohm.bio and gigaohm.bio.

47:53.100 --> 47:58.405
All things maintained by me or one other person soon to be me as well.

47:58.445 --> 47:59.026
I'm excited.

48:01.787 --> 48:04.551
I have decided to full-on learn this.

48:04.731 --> 48:10.138
I want to learn how to build a PeerTube instance on my own and maintain one so that I can do it for others.

48:10.819 --> 48:13.843
And at that point we're going to start a non-profit and make this happen.

48:14.404 --> 48:18.569
Because we are at a time point when human diversity is at its peak for all time.

48:19.130 --> 48:22.273
there will never be more genetic diversity available again.

48:22.333 --> 48:26.878
So what would you do if you were, I don't know, the head of the technocracy?

48:26.938 --> 48:29.661
If you were part of the Human Genome Project, what would you do?

48:29.701 --> 48:32.805
What would you recommend to the Department of Energy that they do?

48:33.425 --> 48:37.429
On what time scale would these plans be on?

48:37.630 --> 48:38.871
How long would it take you to

48:39.271 --> 48:46.643
to get the plan accepted behind the scenes before you could then enact the plan in real life.

48:47.123 --> 48:54.254
This is one big theater with one big cast and I'm trying to make America real again by helping to establish an independent bright web.

48:54.935 --> 48:59.680
Just one man, one woman shows, maybe one family shows.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.362
This is a one family show.

49:01.842 --> 49:04.385
I've got a wife and three kids that support this work.

49:05.306 --> 49:11.993
And I've got a few big supporters, like three or four people that give more than a couple hundred dollars every month.

49:12.053 --> 49:14.035
And then I've got a bunch of people that give me around 10.

49:14.135 --> 49:15.677
That's like 98, 99 people that do that.

49:17.879 --> 49:34.130
And so that adds up to enough, where I can keep coming on often, if not every day during the week, to say that autism spectrum disorder is a myth, that gain of function and pandemics are myths, and that this is the biology that they ignore.

49:34.190 --> 49:40.274
That biology can set you free, I really think it can, because it's something that they can't really change.

49:41.635 --> 49:46.218
Once you understand the limitations of their model,

49:47.267 --> 50:00.017
The limitations of... Once you understand the limitations of the central dogma, and once you understand the reality of social media, you can show these things to your kids.

50:00.497 --> 50:14.367
And showing the central dogma as being very limited and over-represented or exaggerated in its all-encompassing nature is not something that's going to break your children's

50:15.228 --> 50:18.572
biology teacher, you're not going to wreck their school or anything like that.

50:18.592 --> 50:22.295
You're just going to make them a very challenging student for your biology teacher.

50:23.056 --> 50:26.119
And probably a very enlightening one.

50:26.620 --> 50:35.829
Because all biology teachers should get even more excited if they know that the central dogma is a very limited spectrum of debate.

50:37.807 --> 50:40.809
You have to understand why the cheese is free on social media, ladies and gentlemen.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.610
It's a military weapon.

50:43.471 --> 50:47.594
And the people on social media, many of them work for NATO.

50:48.114 --> 50:49.455
They work for the military.

50:49.495 --> 50:51.857
They work for paramilitary organizations.

50:51.917 --> 50:54.479
They work for private military organizations.

50:55.399 --> 51:00.383
And America needs to stay focused on this fact, because that's how we are being beaten right now.

51:01.257 --> 51:03.578
Because we are taking the bait on social media.

51:03.618 --> 51:09.101
We aren't staying focused on the things we can know, the things we can control.

51:12.163 --> 51:13.504
That's why this exists.

51:13.684 --> 51:14.765
Don't take Tylenol.

51:15.325 --> 51:15.945
Don't take it.

51:16.165 --> 51:17.626
With Tylenol, don't take it.

51:18.247 --> 51:18.947
Don't take it.

51:19.187 --> 51:20.668
Don't use Tylenol.

51:20.828 --> 51:21.789
Don't take Tylenol.

51:22.069 --> 51:23.670
Don't take Tylenol.

51:23.910 --> 51:25.491
Fight like hell not to take it.

51:25.671 --> 51:26.731
I think you shouldn't take it.

51:26.871 --> 51:27.832
Don't take Tylenol.

51:29.338 --> 51:35.003
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, biology is the way life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

51:35.103 --> 51:38.325
Population pyramids are real and they saw this coming.

51:42.429 --> 51:47.473
And sometimes I feel like I'm coming to you from a spaceship, trapped on a spaceship.

51:49.174 --> 51:51.876
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who's ever seen the alien.

51:52.237 --> 51:56.600
I know that's not true, of course, but sometimes it definitely does feel that way.

51:58.157 --> 51:58.798
Thanks for coming.

51:58.978 --> 51:59.798
Thanks for being here.

52:01.059 --> 52:03.261
The captain will check in on us and then we'll be gone.

52:04.001 --> 52:12.427
I thought for a long time as I use social media that if I tweeted the right thing or posted the right thing or sent the right direct message that I could change things.

52:12.747 --> 52:19.512
And I didn't really understand the breadth and the depth of the illusion that it's actually an entire cast

52:20.453 --> 52:26.997
of people performing a theater on social media that's meant to make you believe that something real is happening there.

52:27.037 --> 52:35.462
And more importantly, that a bunch of other people are engaged in making that happen there, when in reality, most of the people that you see on social media aren't real.

52:35.903 --> 52:42.567
And the ones that are, are augmented to be places and in times when they couldn't possibly be all at once.

52:43.615 --> 52:54.699
And so the regular people on social media are absolutely bamboozled by the super users, the ones that, that can, you know, block without being blocked or see without seeing or all these things.

52:54.999 --> 53:01.642
They're all not only possible, but extremely likely because social media is a military weapon.

53:01.682 --> 53:04.883
It's a social control program suite.

53:06.857 --> 53:11.542
And so if you want to seek the truth together with GigaOM Biological, welcome to the show.

53:11.602 --> 53:12.503
Thanks for being here.

53:13.023 --> 53:16.067
This is a message for anyone, but it's not for everybody.

53:16.912 --> 53:24.218
Not everybody can handle the truth, and certainly not this truth, the real truth, about how the internet has been used against us.

53:24.298 --> 53:25.298
Nobody wants to hear it.

53:25.979 --> 53:31.483
The vast majority of people just simply don't want to believe that social media is what it is.

53:31.563 --> 53:34.565
They want to believe that most of it's good.

53:34.665 --> 53:36.827
Most of the people on TV are telling the truth.

53:37.387 --> 53:42.972
Most of the people on social media are just trying to, I don't know, get followers, or get by, or be funny.

53:44.092 --> 53:47.155
And in reality, that is absolutely positively not true.

53:47.175 --> 53:51.178
If that were true, then most of the people in your feed would be people that you knew.

53:51.679 --> 53:58.544
Most of the people in your feed would be people that were in your sports club, or in your PTA, or at your work, etc.

53:58.564 --> 53:59.145
But they're not.

53:59.205 --> 54:06.131
They're random people all around the world with the idea of scrambling everyone into groups that are only visible to them.

54:07.321 --> 54:12.169
meaning them, the people that run social media, the military-industrial complex.

54:12.229 --> 54:20.543
And so, if you want to know the truth about what happened in the last six years, you're gonna first have to understand that that is the primary thing that happened.

54:21.807 --> 54:36.118
that in 2019 they started telling stories behind the scenes that led to a complete capitulation of the social media using public to the narrative of COVID and the pandemic in January of 2020.

54:37.318 --> 54:45.905
A complete capitulation of the entire social media using human planet at the onset of the pandemic.

54:46.883 --> 55:11.313
And as more and the remaining number of people were inevitably going to register for a website, register for social media, and start participating in the lockdowns, we had a forced, coerced, by fear and doubt, conversion to full social media status and full social media use.

55:13.562 --> 55:22.384
many, many people that were never on social media and did not have a social media footprint now do, and it can trace right back to the beginning of the pandemic.

55:22.464 --> 55:26.245
And that is absolutely positively by design.

55:26.305 --> 55:42.688
And in fact, the pandemic would not have happened, could not have lasted as long as it did, nor could they have used it to murder as many people as they did, were it not for that flawless, seamless transition to full acceptance

55:43.721 --> 55:45.300
of skilled use of social media.

55:47.680 --> 56:01.691
Clean up the numbers, the two docs here can clean up the numbers for me, but isn't it something like 95, or it's 99% recovery rate unless you have two other comorbidities, usually diabetes and overweight, and that includes usually people that are over 80?

56:01.871 --> 56:02.191
Did I?

56:02.231 --> 56:16.823
The reason why I play this again, remember, is because we have scripted actors in front of us, four scripted actors in front of us, pretending to have a conversation that doesn't have a structure or a previous set of talking points that they wanna hit.

56:17.583 --> 56:30.253
and instead pretending to be individuals who are, I don't know, coming to some consensus about things that all of the people that will passively view this conversation will likely also come to.

56:31.413 --> 56:36.017
And anything that's contradictory here is part of that falling

56:37.267 --> 56:39.869
It's part of that, I don't have any handholds.

56:39.929 --> 56:45.933
And so what you do, as you listen to this as a passive listener, is you're listening for handholds.

56:46.653 --> 56:52.437
And the handholds, in this case, will be defined by things that these four actors agree on.

56:53.478 --> 56:55.059
That's how the psi-war works.

56:55.099 --> 56:57.240
That's how governance by podcast works.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.822
That's how the enchantment is cast.

57:00.694 --> 57:15.710
that these people, scripted but improvising, pretend to answer questions and come to agreements about things within the disagreements or within the question set that they have agreed on ahead of time to answer.

57:17.619 --> 57:27.467
And any difference in their opinions is just simply part of the metal sphere that they are riding their intellectual motorcycle around inside of.

57:27.507 --> 57:33.351
And we're all supposed to be really impressed because they don't crash into each other and there's a lot of fire on the outside.

57:34.372 --> 57:34.792
That's it.

57:35.332 --> 57:36.033
It's a show.

57:36.533 --> 57:37.954
It's an elaborate theater.

57:38.315 --> 57:40.977
And the point is, is that there are infinite channels.

57:42.628 --> 57:49.257
YouTube has a group of people talking about whatever you want for any answer.

57:51.343 --> 58:07.536
And now you see how it's done because of course that goes year after year after year and these podcast actors can cross stages just like Eric Clapton can do a special guest spot on Goose's tour.

58:08.437 --> 58:13.321
Just like, I don't know, Cheap Trick could have B.B.

58:13.361 --> 58:14.162
King on stage.

58:15.626 --> 58:22.950
But now we have podcast actors that are going and taking their viewers with them to other places.

58:23.030 --> 58:27.973
And so that inevitably you, you hear other music, you're exposed to other artists.

58:28.053 --> 58:43.342
And so if the bluegrass music that, that, that Sam Harris is playing, isn't quite what your, what your tune is, maybe, maybe, I don't know, Barry Weiss is your thing or, or Ben Shapiro, really, if you really like his guitar, whatever it is.

58:45.071 --> 59:03.932
And this is exactly how, and the illusion of a conservative movement, the illusion of a dissident movement, the illusion of a COVID skeptic movement, and the illusion of a health freedom movement was created on the internet because it exists nowhere else.

59:08.086 --> 59:16.089
And so Barry Weiss's very existence is dependent on the internet and a chorus of clowns that agrees that she seems to be relevant.

59:16.769 --> 59:23.012
A chorus of clowns that agrees that her quitting the New York Times in 2020 is a relevant thing.

59:23.432 --> 59:26.073
That the reason why she quit was a relevant thing.

59:26.453 --> 59:28.514
That Twitter played a relevant role in it.

59:28.874 --> 59:34.936
That Twitter is a place where, I don't know, the truth is, but it's kind of censored and so maybe we should try to make it free.

59:37.216 --> 59:47.502
And so I showed you very clearly how Joe Rogan was very, very, very much not the ivermectin and antibodies Joe Rogan in 2019.

59:48.522 --> 59:56.126
He was a bit more like a chameleon and could be as left as he needed to be for a Jewish lesbian and right as he needed to be for somebody else.

59:58.808 --> 01:00:04.251
And as we went into the pandemic and moved through the pandemic, he did exactly what he was scripted to do.

01:00:09.835 --> 01:00:14.756
And as we go forward into 2025, she's doing exactly what she's been scripted to do.

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:20.637
Is it supposed to be frustrating that Barry Weiss is now at CBS?

01:00:20.677 --> 01:00:22.777
Is it supposed to feel like unfair or something?

01:00:22.837 --> 01:00:23.237
I don't know.

01:00:23.297 --> 01:00:35.680
It doesn't matter because if you realize that it's all just a theater, then it doesn't matter whether she goes to CBS or, you know, I don't know, somebody else becomes head of Tesla or it's all dumb.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.120
Who cares?

01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:48.903
Let's say Jeff Bezos sold Amazon for $100 billion to some guy named, I don't know, John Travolta.

01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:49.703
Would that matter?

01:00:50.424 --> 01:00:51.565
Would it change anything?

01:00:52.946 --> 01:00:58.449
Should we argue about John Travolta's past or John Travolta's wives or, you know what I mean?

01:00:58.949 --> 01:01:00.951
That he was a Scientologist, should that matter?

01:01:03.112 --> 01:01:12.295
If they're all just scripted actors pretending to be entrepreneurs or stars or, you know, whatever, they're just actors.

01:01:13.535 --> 01:01:22.217
They're not people that have risen through the ranks by merit and intelligence and charm and integrity.

01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:25.678
That's how you get ahead at work.

01:01:26.799 --> 01:01:31.100
That's how supposedly postdocs get on a tenure track and then get tenure.

01:01:32.096 --> 01:01:35.238
That's supposedly how rich people get rich, but it's not.

01:01:36.138 --> 01:01:39.620
And it's definitely not how these people got where they are.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.804
It's not how Sam Harris is just not so fricking smart that he can just basically go places and talk and make money.

01:01:46.424 --> 01:01:47.365
That's ridiculous.

01:01:48.615 --> 01:01:57.920
It's not that Ben Shapiro's just such a good businessman and also great on camera that he's managed to make a media empire for him and his family.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.420
No, that's ridiculous.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:08.024
And it's not that Joe Rogan is just such a conversationalist that Spotify can make and offer him contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:02:08.084 --> 01:02:09.685
That's just not reality.

01:02:10.466 --> 01:02:10.986
Come on.

01:02:14.332 --> 01:02:22.399
And so the only reason why this whole timeline can be shown to you in the way it is, and we're now here where Americans on.

01:02:24.448 --> 01:02:29.771
where Americans on the blue side think that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:33.532
is killing kids and that Donald Trump is destroying America.

01:02:34.053 --> 01:02:46.678
But on the right, we think that, I don't know, I guess Israel's kind of in charge in a bad way or a good way, and that it's unfair that this person gets in charge because these people like Israel.

01:02:47.859 --> 01:02:53.824
I don't really know if they have an objection to Israel or to Israel's control or foreign governments in general.

01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:54.845
It's not very clear.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.766
I think it's something to do with the Jews.

01:02:57.987 --> 01:02:59.688
But it's really all very confusing.

01:02:59.728 --> 01:03:09.816
The only thing they really agree on is that climate change is real and that nobody needs to talk about opioids and nobody needs to talk about the murder that occurred in 2020, 21, and 22.

01:03:09.856 --> 01:03:10.957
Nobody needs to talk about that.

01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:25.272
because of Israel and because of MRNA and because of Charlie Kirk and because of, I don't know, climate change and insider trading maybe?

01:03:25.332 --> 01:03:26.734
Oh no, they don't talk about that either.

01:03:32.412 --> 01:03:33.853
It makes me sad, it does.

01:03:33.873 --> 01:03:34.794
Her right wing media outlet.

01:03:34.834 --> 01:03:35.975
She is a Jewish lesbian from Pittsburgh

01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:02.878
who's 37 years old, but she has a right wing substack.

01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:05.441
It's a fricking substack.

01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:06.983
Let's just be honest here.

01:04:07.023 --> 01:04:09.546
A substack sold for $150 million.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:25.774
Resigned in 2020 with no details.

01:04:25.874 --> 01:04:28.716
We don't need to hear that it had to do with George Floyd.

01:04:44.687 --> 01:05:10.636
We don't need to hear it had to do with George Floyd because then we might, you know, an investigative reporter might remind you that Pierre Corey, one of the more prominent anti-vaxxers behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial health and human services secretary, was one of the original medical witnesses that declared that George Floyd died of suffocation and not of overdose, even though he's not certified as a doctor in Minnesota.

01:05:15.273 --> 01:05:21.578
I mean, you can imagine a quid pro quo where like, you know, Pierre, you can make some money really quick.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.919
We'll fly you to New York.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:28.563
You can, you know, pretend like you're doing stuff in New York and in the hospitals and talk about oxygen for us.

01:05:29.103 --> 01:05:34.527
And then we'll hook you up with a book deal and we'll get you some extra money because we need somebody to testify for this black dude.

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:43.654
And you can just look at his, you know, medical, look at his medical records for a few hours and charge money and then, you know, write this thing and we'll be good.

01:05:45.539 --> 01:06:03.601
It's impossible to understand how it is that Pierre Corey of all people, Ivor Mechtin Corey of all people, you know, 60 liters a minute of oxygen in 2020 in New York City, Corey of all people, you know, on stage with Steve Kirsch and on stage with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.803
and touring the world with

01:06:05.243 --> 01:06:08.105
with the international COVID summit of Robert Malone.

01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:33.160
It's hard to believe that Pierre Cory, of all doctors in the Midwest, in Minnesota and Wisconsin, that Pierre Cory was the one who was writing a statement, a medical examiner's affidavit or a medical doctor's affidavit for the cause of death of George Floyd in Minnesota while he was in frickin' New York City.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.960
You know, during the big outbreak.

01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:55.905
And so, Democracy Now, you know, being the high-end, super journalistic, you know, she's been around for so long, she's got a whole staff, they did all the background, they just say that she resigned from the New York Times in 2020, period.

01:06:56.745 --> 01:06:58.665
No other details needed.

01:07:02.006 --> 01:07:02.866
It would be a shame

01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:06.828
It would be a shame.

01:07:07.228 --> 01:07:07.869
You demon.

01:07:08.129 --> 01:07:08.910
It would be a shame.

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:10.631
Sometimes there's gremlins in my setup.

01:07:11.232 --> 01:07:21.219
It would be a shame for us to have covered the entire timeline of why this absolute fraud can go from nobody to somebody in about six years.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:32.948
And then it included a script where censoring me on Twitter or getting mad about what I say on Twitter is enough to make me quit my big cush New York times job.

01:07:36.454 --> 01:07:39.683
And we're supposed to believe that she can't get any deeper than that.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:43.854
It's just a script that she's given and she just READS it!

01:07:45.447 --> 01:08:09.648
Silicon Valley venture capitalist and has been widely criticized for its commentary on Gaza, including a piece headlined, The Gaza Famine Myth, which questioned famine conditions in the besieged territory caused by— See, now think about how many details they're giving you about this and what kind of things that she published, but they can't tell you about anything about why she resigned or how that might be connected to some

01:08:10.328 --> 01:08:15.894
real weird paramilitary operation to make people believe the worst case scenario in COVID.

01:08:17.036 --> 01:08:22.302
Remember there were seven months of street protests fueled by that debate.

01:08:24.804 --> 01:08:28.569
To which Pierre Cory contributed a legal affidavit.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:30.270
Stop lying!

01:08:31.038 --> 01:08:31.838
No, I'm not lying.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:32.918
That's the truth, Ruth.

01:08:33.519 --> 01:08:35.099
Israel's assault and blockade.

01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:45.861
In her new role, Weiss will report to Trump ally, Paramount CEO David Ellison, who took control of Paramount through the merger with his company Skydance Media.

01:08:46.261 --> 01:08:58.104
David is the son of one of the richest men in the world, recently declared the richest for a little bit, billionaire Larry Ellison, executive chair of Oracle, who Trump has proposed to make part owner of TikTok.

01:08:58.658 --> 01:09:11.732
There are people who have had the benefit of inheriting money that goes back to, you know, like the Dutch East Indies company.

01:09:13.208 --> 01:09:28.958
to money that was brought over on ships during the first 50 or 100 years of America's existence, of early businesses established in America's early existence, huge piles of money that were huge back then.

01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:42.087
And so if you think for one second that the list of the richest people in the world is a real list and that he is on it, there are igloos for sale in Florida.

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:49.617
The Ellison family is also set to make a bid for CNN's parent company, Warner Bros.

01:09:49.677 --> 01:09:53.380
Discovery, which would also include owning, for example, HBO.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:58.765
This all comes after the parent company of CBS News agreed in June to settle a $20 billion

01:09:58.925 --> 01:10:06.610
billion lawsuit brought by Trump, who objected to how CBS's News 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:18.038
Paramount board chair and controlling shareholder Sherry Redstone reportedly sought the settlement to ensure the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, approved Paramount's bid to merge with Sky Dance Media.

01:10:18.578 --> 01:10:19.699
CBS also

01:10:20.379 --> 01:10:29.021
canceled the late show with Stephen Colbert, starting next May, after Colbert called the settlement a big, fat bribe.

01:10:29.641 --> 01:10:36.662
On all of this, we're joined by David Kleon, columnist for The Nation, contributing editor at Jewish Currents.

01:10:36.722 --> 01:10:44.043
His piece for The Guardian is headlined, Disgruntled NYT Journalist Anti-Woke Power Grab, How Far Can Barry Weiss Go?

01:10:44.503 --> 01:10:46.064
David, welcome to Democracy Now!

01:10:46.104 --> 01:10:47.504
Thanks for joining us from Brooklyn.

01:10:47.924 --> 01:10:58.049
Why don't you start off by laying out the Ellison empire and then the significance of them installing Barry Weiss as head of CBS News?

01:10:59.149 --> 01:11:00.910
It's really not that significant at all.

01:11:00.970 --> 01:11:10.875
In fact, if you don't watch any of their dumb shit that's on Paramount Plus or Comedy Central or any of these other places, then they don't matter at all.

01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:17.863
If you're not on the social media where that content is recycled, they don't matter at all.

01:11:19.304 --> 01:11:20.805
Now I understand that they matter.

01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:22.586
I understand that that is the whole point.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:24.166
That's part of the script, right?

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:27.128
They need us to get angry about this.

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.768
They need us to get upset about it.

01:11:28.828 --> 01:11:30.929
They need us to run in this direction.

01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:33.371
So first and foremost, stop running.

01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:34.171
Just listen.

01:11:37.551 --> 01:11:38.752
Well, thanks for having me, Amy.

01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:48.862
So Larry Ellison, who briefly, at least, was the richest person in the world in the last month or so, he was at least briefly ahead of Elon Musk.

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:51.084
His son, David Ellison... Exactly.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:56.770
Arthur in the chat wins the prize for the day because that's what's going to happen.

01:11:56.810 --> 01:12:01.535
This entire discussion will never mention Oracle.

01:12:02.765 --> 01:12:09.407
Now the reason why Oracle is so important is because the whole damn government is run on Oracle databases and Oracle software.

01:12:09.427 --> 01:12:17.310
The whole government... You understand that's a big problem, right?

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:24.413
And so getting all excited about Paramount or buying out Warner Brothers or whatever, who cares?

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:30.735
Larry Ellison is dangerous because the databases that are used

01:12:32.293 --> 01:12:34.274
are Oracle products.

01:12:34.414 --> 01:12:35.634
Oracle products suck.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.795
Oracle products are horrible.

01:12:38.215 --> 01:12:45.517
And yet somehow or another, we have Palantir helping us to sort out that problem in some way.

01:12:47.178 --> 01:12:48.218
You see the issue here?

01:12:49.844 --> 01:12:52.866
And so I think Arthur in the chat is extremely right.

01:12:52.986 --> 01:13:03.471
This is a fricking distraction to make you think that you have to be outraged about Larry Ellison because of Paramount Plus and ABC and CBS and NBC.

01:13:03.531 --> 01:13:09.334
And it has nothing to do with any of this shit because nobody watches that anymore.

01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:17.728
We're not gonna win by- by getting people to stop watching Outlander reruns.

01:13:17.788 --> 01:13:24.590
We're not gonna get- we're not gonna win by- by getting people to, you know, stop their Paramount Plus subscription.

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:33.773
And it doesn't matter if the Paramount Plus subscription goes to the same guy that the other one goes- that the ESPN subscription goes- cares!

01:13:36.854 --> 01:13:38.795
He owns all the databases of the U.S.

01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:39.215
government.

01:13:41.912 --> 01:13:47.877
Thompson is—less is known about him, but he's a rising power in media.

01:13:47.917 --> 01:13:51.479
He founded Skydance, which is now merged with Paramount.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.024
Paramount, in addition to Paramount Hollywood Studios, owns CBS, obviously.

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:59.666
It owns Viacom, which is Comedy Central and MTV.

01:14:01.707 --> 01:14:04.548
So, it's a huge empire.

01:14:04.748 --> 01:14:10.410
And by all reports, Allison is currently looking to acquire Warner Bros.

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:14.711
and Discovery, which would give him control of CNN and HBO.

01:14:15.872 --> 01:14:17.072
So, we're talking about an

01:14:17.472 --> 01:14:22.256
unprecedented level of media consolidation by an unprecedented level of wealth.

01:14:23.517 --> 01:14:25.518
Larry Ellison is a known Trump supporter.

01:14:25.578 --> 01:14:27.960
David Ellison is at least suspected to be.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.022
And both are known to be extremely fervent supporters of Israel.

01:14:31.963 --> 01:14:44.293
And David Ellison has gotten very close with Barry Weiss, who is very well known for being a fervent supporter of Israel, going back to her days at Columbia University 20 years ago, where she and I were both undergraduates at the same time.

01:14:45.033 --> 01:15:02.291
And where she gained a national reputation, even as an undergraduate, for campaigns she was running against Arab and Muslim professors there, who she and other students saw as too critical of Israel and as ideologically motivated in the classroom.

01:15:05.454 --> 01:15:07.676
presented herself as a champion of free speech.

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:13.501
And I would say that her publication, The Free Press, claims to be centrally founded around free speech.

01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:25.912
But in reality, she has a 20-year history of suppressing speech that she finds objectionable, especially when it's speech championing the rights of Palestinians and criticizing the state of Israel.

01:15:26.613 --> 01:15:28.715
And The Free Press has been centrally involved in that.

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:42.790
So, with her becoming not so much the formal head of CBS News as Ellison's kind of personal enforcer outside the normal chain of command within the organization,

01:15:44.612 --> 01:16:05.013
It remains to be seen what she'll actually do, but many people, including me, are concerned that she will enforce a right-leaning ideology on the whole network, and probably particularly on Israel coverage, where CBS has sometimes gone outside the bounds of what someone like Weiss would approve of, or, for that matter, what Cherry Redstone, the previous owner, had approved of.

01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:09.014
And could you talk about the free press?

01:16:09.094 --> 01:16:11.275
Most people around the country have never heard of it.

01:16:12.676 --> 01:16:15.377
Is it worth anywhere near $150 million that Skydance is paying for it?

01:16:24.004 --> 01:16:28.585
A hundred and fifty million, I think almost anyone would agree, is a very, very steep valuation.

01:16:29.205 --> 01:16:48.390
The Free Press was founded as a substack called Common Sense by Barry Weiss and her wife, Nellie Bowles, and her sister, Susie Weiss, in, I believe, 2021, the year after Weiss resigned the New York Times—resigned from the New York Times after the forced resignation of opinion editor James Bennett, which

01:16:49.830 --> 01:17:00.337
media-savvy people may recall, was over an op-ed that Bennett published by Senator Tom Cotton calling for military force against Black Lives Matter demonstrators.

01:17:01.298 --> 01:17:09.523
Weiss left in a public resignation letter saying that The Times was censorious and a hostile work environment.

01:17:10.244 --> 01:17:17.429
And she created the common sense initially as a place— Why—is that him, Eli?

01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:18.209
I guess that's him.

01:17:18.309 --> 01:17:19.410
I don't know why that's there.

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.510
OK.

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:26.472
It was a place to sort of run letters by, you know, disgruntled private school parents about their kids' curriculums and stuff like that.

01:17:26.932 --> 01:17:38.875
But, very quickly, it became—it attracted support from venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen and David Sachs in Silicon Valley, who are OpenTrump supporters.

01:17:39.895 --> 01:17:45.217
And it was rebranded as the Free Press, and it attracted a staff of, I believe, something like 40 or 50 people now.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:51.398
40 or 50 people on staff of a sub stack.

01:17:51.719 --> 01:17:52.439
Stop lying.

01:17:52.759 --> 01:17:53.279
No, really.

01:17:53.299 --> 01:17:57.080
He just said 40 or 50 people on staff of a sub stack.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.701
Stop lying.

01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:11.005
And, and so it's exactly the same as these podcasts, like the diary of a CEO who admitted the other day that they have 50 employees.

01:18:12.537 --> 01:18:17.442
But it's just some dude sitting at a table with some other dude and they just talk about shit.

01:18:17.882 --> 01:18:19.744
What do they need 50 employees for?

01:18:22.246 --> 01:18:25.509
What am I doing here all by myself in the back of my garage?

01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:28.632
What chance do I stand?

01:18:30.734 --> 01:18:36.580
In my mind, I think I stand a pretty good chance because I can claim that I don't have 50 staff because I don't.

01:18:37.443 --> 01:18:42.086
I can claim that I do all the work and all the reading and all the note taking on my own because I do.

01:18:42.566 --> 01:18:52.692
I can claim that I use my 30 years of expertise that includes 20 years in academia as a neurobiologist that includes a Nobel Prize winning lab.

01:18:56.021 --> 01:19:03.887
And I can use all of that experience and apply it to current events, especially as regard to any kind of science communication that's necessary.

01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:14.214
And I can potentially make people like Dave Farina into the frauds that they actually are, because science communication and communicator is not a thing.

01:19:17.879 --> 01:19:24.365
Science communicator means script reader, just like podcaster means script reader.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.008
And I'm not a podcaster, I'm a broadcaster.

01:19:27.789 --> 01:19:30.812
I turn on and I start talking.

01:19:32.048 --> 01:19:35.090
And it is my expertise on which I rely.

01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:38.672
It is my previous experience on which I rely.

01:19:38.812 --> 01:19:52.921
And it is my online real-time thinking that I rely on, not a script, not a meeting I've had 20 minutes before with my handlers, not a meeting that I've had all week with my staff of 40 people.

01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:57.554
This is the result of a career being lost.

01:19:58.174 --> 01:20:11.562
This is a result of a truth being found, despite having come in contact with all of the people, all of the people behind the fake health freedom movement.

01:20:11.662 --> 01:20:15.745
I've talked to all of them face to face, and they've all lied to me.

01:20:15.825 --> 01:20:23.630
Wittingly or unwittingly, these people are all part of an elaborate illusion that is part of the controlled demolition of America.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440
He doesn't have to know.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:32.483
I guarantee you that lady on Democracy Now doesn't have to know.

01:20:32.543 --> 01:20:33.763
They just have to believe.

01:20:35.084 --> 01:20:45.507
And because they are probably surrounded behind the scenes by 40 people, some of whom could easily be scripted actors from the deep state, from the military industrial complex.

01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:51.049
How can she know better?

01:20:52.074 --> 01:20:56.879
She doesn't have the requisite biology to understand that the pandemic was an illusion.

01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:01.864
The only thing she knows for sure is that everybody seems to agree there was one.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.107
And social media is never going to let her meet us.

01:21:07.469 --> 01:21:13.355
These people are just as shielded from the truth as we are shielded from the truth getting out.

01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:18.273
Brett Weinstein doesn't know how thin of ice he's standing on.

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:19.893
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:19.933 --> 01:21:22.475
doesn't know that half the country thinks he's an idiot.

01:21:22.575 --> 01:21:28.017
And he doesn't care because he's been told by the people around him that that's a sign that he's right.

01:21:29.938 --> 01:21:41.163
Just like Donald Trump is being told that women on TikTok are taking handfuls of Tylenol and saying F Trump because the Trump derangement syndrome has gone that pathological.

01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:47.864
If you log off right now, all of this goes away.

01:21:49.545 --> 01:21:50.765
That's a real publication.

01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:54.587
Publicly, it's supposed to have around 170,000 paid subscribers and nearly 10 times that many.

01:21:54.607 --> 01:21:56.188
170,000 paid subscribers.

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:58.629
Just do the math if she's even got $5 a month from them.

01:22:08.661 --> 01:22:14.523
170,000 paid subscribers, even if she only gets $5 a month.

01:22:16.663 --> 01:22:19.164
That's what you call money laundering, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:19.964 --> 01:22:21.804
Robert Malone is doing the same thing.

01:22:21.844 --> 01:22:23.505
Pierre Kory's doing the same thing.

01:22:23.565 --> 01:22:25.345
Jessica Hockett's doing the same thing.

01:22:25.405 --> 01:22:27.266
Jessica Rose is doing the same thing.

01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:33.367
It's money laundering because it isn't 170,000 dumb individuals who all gave their credit card.

01:22:38.422 --> 01:22:49.611
It is the malevolent use of social media to put Barry Weiss in front of every possible sucker on the internet so that 170,000 suckers would be paying her.

01:22:51.093 --> 01:22:55.356
That didn't happen because the internet algorithms just kind of make things happen.

01:22:55.876 --> 01:22:58.359
It happened because it was programmed to happen that way.

01:22:58.799 --> 01:23:01.541
And if it wouldn't have happened one way, it would have happened another way.

01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:07.126
And they would have gotten the same place that they want to be right now, which is reporting this as ridiculous.

01:23:08.547 --> 01:23:09.708
Or maybe it's not ridiculous.

01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:12.011
Also, 170,000 paid subscribers or they're free subscribers?

01:23:12.031 --> 01:23:13.452
That's not very clear to me.

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:32.193
or the bulwark, that are very ideologically different from Weiss's.

01:23:33.254 --> 01:23:40.643
But the Free Press has been, I think, incredibly successful, but $150 million valuation is something else.

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:48.192
People have run the numbers, and it's highly unlikely that the site's organic subscriber base could justify that.

01:23:48.872 --> 01:24:03.498
And given that the Ellisons have, for all intents and purposes, infinite money and 150 million is pocket change for them, it's widely understood, I think, or should be widely understood that this is an ideological power play by them.

01:24:03.778 --> 01:24:11.901
This is about turning Barry Weiss into it's about elevating her political ideology over one of the most important.

01:24:12.342 --> 01:24:17.964
And so what you are supposed to believe is one of two things, according to these people, either

01:24:18.744 --> 01:24:25.446
The entire American government and the American apparatus is controlled by people with money.

01:24:27.066 --> 01:24:32.568
Because if you're rich enough where $150 is pocket change, then you can control people.

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:34.008
That's for sure.

01:24:34.328 --> 01:24:36.329
And you can buy an awful lot of puppets.

01:24:36.849 --> 01:24:38.930
You can pay an awful lot of actors.

01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:42.430
You can script an awful lot of podcasts.

01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:44.231
And it's just, it's pocket change.

01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:54.806
And now you understand the magic that happened in 2020, 2021, 2022 for what amounts to pocket change.

01:24:56.947 --> 01:25:01.450
The military industrial complex was able to populate the internet with a bunch of people.

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:05.693
Now there are some people that they have, you know, special donors and stuff like that.

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:09.575
And so it sounds like they're even more creepy, but that's the illusion.

01:25:10.202 --> 01:25:15.863
You know, Charlie Kirk was getting donations from this person or that person, and Larry Ellison's this rich, and la-la-la-la-la.

01:25:16.284 --> 01:25:22.205
And so, there are all these details that seem to make it seem like these guys are the real Scooby-Doo villains, but they're not.

01:25:23.225 --> 01:25:27.166
It is the chorus that's behind the scene.

01:25:27.206 --> 01:25:34.148
That's why I have that picture with Rogan at the top and all the little guys at the bottom, because all the little guys are who get ya.

01:25:36.313 --> 01:25:51.087
All the podcasts with only 10,000 subscribers are the ones that get you because you don't realize that they can have hundreds of those people that will inspire unwittingly hundreds of other people.

01:25:51.947 --> 01:26:02.377
And collectively, because the algorithm is weighted to the scripted, it sure seems like there's an illusion of consensus that the scripted are right about.

01:26:03.848 --> 01:26:10.013
because a certain percentage of the unwitting will go along with it because you've seen those psychological experiments before.

01:26:12.815 --> 01:26:18.180
And so we are at a very dangerous precipice right now and the only way is to back away from it.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.243
Step backwards and get off of social media.

01:26:27.774 --> 01:26:34.297
And of course, you're talking about a news organization that had such a luminaries of them.

01:26:34.577 --> 01:26:35.658
Unbelievable.

01:26:35.718 --> 01:26:39.419
Look at that.

01:26:39.439 --> 01:26:41.680
$880 billion Oracle is worth.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:47.403
And these silly shits are talking about Paramount Plus.

01:26:48.533 --> 01:26:53.699
media as Walter Cronkite, Mike Wallace, Edward R. Murrow, Fred Friendly.

01:26:53.759 --> 01:27:01.106
What's your sense of what the reporters in CBS are thinking these days?

01:27:04.008 --> 01:27:14.235
Well, there have been numerous reports, always anonymously sourced, in which long-time CBS News insiders express panic and alarm.

01:27:14.976 --> 01:27:17.477
The general perception, some of it is ideological.

01:27:17.558 --> 01:27:22.141
Some of them think that, you know, Weiss is a propagandist, which he certainly is.

01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:32.168
I'm not sure what's going on, but yesterday there were jet planes, like fighter jets, flying over the house all frickin' day, and it sounds like they're doing it again.

01:27:36.297 --> 01:27:37.319
It just didn't pairs.

01:27:37.479 --> 01:27:43.248
I don't know why, but there are a lot of fighter jets flying over my house in the last day.

01:27:43.468 --> 01:27:45.251
And today it sounds like it's happening again.

01:27:45.271 --> 01:27:46.653
Okay, I'm just gonna keep going.

01:27:46.733 --> 01:27:48.196
I got a lot of work to do here.

01:27:56.377 --> 01:28:02.586
We're gonna dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns CBS News, one of the most trusted names in American journalism.

01:28:02.626 --> 01:28:08.315
It gave us Edward R. Murrow's harvest of shame, Walter Cronkite delivering the news of JFK's assassination, and of course, this.

01:28:09.249 --> 01:28:13.730
In recent months, a kind of underground fashion has spread among marijuana smokers.

01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:18.432
It involves the fancy paper used to roll the joints, as they're sometimes called.

01:28:18.532 --> 01:28:24.833
Cigarette papers manufactured in this country, France, Mexico, and Spain, now amount to big business.

01:28:25.274 --> 01:28:32.295
Mainly because of the boom in grass, pot, tea, Mary Jane, reapers, giggle grass, or marijuana.

01:28:33.076 --> 01:28:33.376
Wow.

01:28:33.896 --> 01:28:37.037
Someone really did their research into weed synonyms back then.

01:28:38.177 --> 01:28:39.418
I just wish he'd kept going.

01:28:39.678 --> 01:28:47.863
Gigglegrass, Bongweed, Powerflower, Magic Cabbage, Lucifer's Lettuce, Smokey Dokey, Whizzle Bizzle, and of course, checking in at the Blitz Carlton.

01:28:49.184 --> 01:29:04.993
Specifically, we're gonna talk about CBS' parent company, Paramount, and its recent merger with Skydance Media, a deal largely powered by the money of Larry Ellison, one of the richest men on Earth, and notable Trump supporter, with the company now run by his son, David, a man with resting, just checked into the White Lotus face.

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:14.425
There are already some worrying signs regarding what this takeover might mean for CBS News in particular, starting with the fact that this guy is thrilled about it.

01:29:14.445 --> 01:29:16.546
I think ABC is very bad.

01:29:16.586 --> 01:29:18.026
I think NBC is very bad.

01:29:18.647 --> 01:29:21.507
And CBS has a new owner, so we have hope for CBS.

01:29:21.587 --> 01:29:23.728
CBS has a great new owner, my opinion.

01:29:24.366 --> 01:29:33.312
Yeah, it is never a great sign when Donald Trump, seen here fresh from a trip to Sephora to color match his hair to his skin, loves a management decision that you've made.

01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:39.596
But he does have a lot to be happy about in order to have Skydance to get its merger approved by Brendan Carr's FCC.

01:29:39.656 --> 01:29:44.079
It committed to adopt measures that can root out the bias that is undermining- Now, you don't like him.

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:50.263
Maybe you don't think anybody likes him, but he gets a million views in less than eight hours on YouTube.

01:29:51.428 --> 01:30:02.100
And there isn't anybody in the health freedom movement that even gets 100,000 views in the first eight hours of any video they ever produce, put up, or are featured in.

01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:04.683
I need you to see this.

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:14.445
It doesn't matter what cat herder you look at on the left, what cat herder you look at in the center, you will find millions of followers.

01:30:14.505 --> 01:30:22.269
And it doesn't matter what cat herder you look at on the right, in the fake health freedom movement, you will find tens of thousands, and that is it.

01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:25.231
Because it is an illusion.

01:30:26.592 --> 01:30:28.413
And it is not a 50-50.

01:30:28.793 --> 01:30:30.974
There is no truth that is getting out.

01:30:33.086 --> 01:30:53.120
You are trapped in a hamster wheel and it is time to get you and your family out and realize that Donald Trump and his act over the last 12 years has been exactly that, an act done on behalf of Hillary Clinton and the rest of the same group of shitheads.

01:30:54.722 --> 01:30:56.483
That's why they went to each other's weddings.

01:30:58.177 --> 01:30:59.920
and trust in the national news media.

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:05.729
One of those measures was installing this former conservative think tank CEO as CBS News' new ombudsman.

01:31:05.769 --> 01:31:08.714
But this Monday, Addison took a much bigger step.

01:31:09.662 --> 01:31:12.144
A major shift in the landscape of TV news.

01:31:12.584 --> 01:31:21.470
Paramount Skydance announcing that they've made Barry Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News and acquired her online news and commentary organization, The Free Press.

01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:27.433
She's a registered independent who at one point called herself politically homeless, unrepresented by the two main U.S.

01:31:27.473 --> 01:31:27.794
parties.

01:31:28.434 --> 01:31:30.275
Okay, first, politically homeless?

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:34.398
Sounds like how you describe Rudy Giuliani's current fashion sense, but...

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.360
But it is true.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:48.084
Paramount has bought the free press for $150 million, and Barry Weiss, its co-founder, will now be setting the editorial strategy, vision, and focus for CBS Morning, CBS Evening News, Face the Nation, and even 60 Minutes.

01:31:48.465 --> 01:31:55.027
Also, instead of reporting to the president of CBS News, Weiss will apparently report directly to David Ellison.

01:31:55.067 --> 01:32:03.110
And look, if you are not familiar with Barry Weiss, you should know she's a proud contrarian who, in public appearances, will inevitably deliver some version of this pitch.

01:32:03.877 --> 01:32:06.199
I confound people because I'm Jewish.

01:32:06.659 --> 01:32:07.880
I've always thought I was liberal.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.001
I'm gay.

01:32:09.021 --> 01:32:10.041
I'm married to a woman.

01:32:10.101 --> 01:32:11.502
Like, that's my life.

01:32:11.702 --> 01:32:13.964
You would think that I'm liberal and I would just go along with the flow.

01:32:14.004 --> 01:32:15.245
It's like, I look like them.

01:32:15.265 --> 01:32:15.885
I think like them.

01:32:15.925 --> 01:32:18.827
I eat at the same restaurants, but I don't think all the same things.

01:32:19.348 --> 01:32:21.309
And I'm not scared to say- That is a liar.

01:32:21.809 --> 01:32:24.351
That is a scripted liar.

01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:26.633
And even more, it's a child.

01:32:27.213 --> 01:32:32.357
This person doesn't have any real experience except that she went to Columbia University.

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:36.340
That is the extent to her real world experience.

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.061
Everything else was handed to her.

01:32:38.941 --> 01:32:40.622
Everything else has been scripted.

01:32:41.102 --> 01:32:44.123
Everything else has been screened through a publicist.

01:32:45.144 --> 01:32:50.146
This is one of the most fraudulent American adults alive.

01:32:52.335 --> 01:32:58.457
And she should be the victim of regular rotten vegetable attacks for the rest of her life.

01:32:58.597 --> 01:33:03.799
Unfortunately, that's not likely to happen, but this is a scripted clown.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.681
And when I disagree, and I think that's really pissed people off throughout my career.

01:33:11.263 --> 01:33:18.912
Okay, first and least importantly, the reboot of Between Two Ferns looks terrible, but that is her basic self.

01:33:18.932 --> 01:33:21.836
She's a liberal who's brave enough to disagree with other liberals.

01:33:21.916 --> 01:33:26.041
And so now is he going to actually do a journalistic take on this?

01:33:26.802 --> 01:33:27.983
Is he gonna critique her?

01:33:29.119 --> 01:33:36.065
joke behavior during college where she tried to get Palestinian or Arab professors fired?

01:33:36.705 --> 01:33:45.192
Are we going to talk about her ridiculous performance in 2019 on Joe Rogan?

01:33:45.573 --> 01:33:55.361
Are we going to talk about her ridiculous resignation from the New York Times in 2020 during the start of the pandemic about something to do with George Floyd?

01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:56.902
Are we going to talk about any of that?

01:33:57.622 --> 01:33:58.363
I don't know.

01:33:58.443 --> 01:33:59.723
It sounds like we're not.

01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:05.326
Along the way, she's accumulated admirers from Jeff Bezos to Meghan McCain, and from Amy Coney Barrett to Joe Rogan.

01:34:05.366 --> 01:34:10.068
And if you're thinking, wow, that's not a very ideologically broad from and to, yes.

01:34:10.508 --> 01:34:12.369
All those people have endorsed her?

01:34:13.069 --> 01:34:14.470
That's weird, don't you think?

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:26.375
And it's even weirder that instead of telling a reasonable story about her ridiculous rise to prominence, he's actually just telling you what the script wants you to know.

01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:36.996
starting to catch on because there are times where she's a little more explicit about what she believes, like when she gave a speech to the Conservative Federalist Society featuring this fun joke.

01:34:37.856 --> 01:34:40.378
I'm a gay woman who is moderately pro-choice.

01:34:41.478 --> 01:34:46.001
I know that there are some people in this room who don't believe that my marriage should have been legal.

01:34:46.961 --> 01:34:49.523
What does moderately pro-choice mean?

01:34:50.423 --> 01:34:54.986
Why is anyone allowed to say those three words in combination

01:34:56.149 --> 01:35:01.475
or two words in combination and not be criticized openly as a buffoon.

01:35:03.257 --> 01:35:04.858
Moderately pro-choice?

01:35:05.919 --> 01:35:07.721
What does that mean?

01:35:07.741 --> 01:35:14.669
And that's okay, because we're all Americans who want lower taxes.

01:35:18.814 --> 01:35:28.639
And you can almost hear that room unclench after she basically says, I know you think I deserve fewer rights, but don't worry, besties, we're still chill.

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:34.622
And while that is obviously framed as a joke, it's also a setup to her saying in all seriousness... The laughter is really fake.

01:35:34.703 --> 01:35:35.703
I don't get the jokes.

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.464
I don't even see what's funny here.

01:35:37.664 --> 01:35:44.388
And so it's really remarkable that they are so timing the laughter that it goes quiet, goes loud, goes quiet.

01:35:44.468 --> 01:35:45.588
It's clearly fake.

01:35:45.688 --> 01:35:46.109
This is...

01:35:46.849 --> 01:35:48.612
the illusion of consensus.

01:35:48.852 --> 01:35:52.618
The laugh track is the illusion of consensus.

01:35:52.698 --> 01:35:56.865
The bots on social media are the illusion of consensus.

01:35:56.905 --> 01:36:01.953
The programming so that everybody sees what needs to be seen is an illusion.

01:36:03.542 --> 01:36:14.589
I am here because I know that in the fight for the West, who my allies really are, and she goes on to say, among other things, the wave of so-called progressive prosecutors has proven to be an immensely bad thing for law and order.

01:36:14.609 --> 01:36:21.193
And I've got to say, for someone who claims they are politically homeless, she sure seems awfully at home in that room.

01:36:21.574 --> 01:36:23.535
And look, this isn't the first time.

01:36:23.795 --> 01:36:27.677
An outsider billionaire has tried thumbing the scale of a news organization.

01:36:27.697 --> 01:36:33.741
We've seen Jeff Bezos increasingly meddle with the Washington Post, and Patrick Soon-Shiong do the same at the LA Times.

01:36:33.801 --> 01:36:34.882
But this figure... What?

01:36:35.762 --> 01:36:36.302
Wait, what?

01:36:36.623 --> 01:36:40.285
Patrick Shoo-Song is the owner of the New York Times?

01:36:40.345 --> 01:36:44.007
The guy that, like, runs the Wimber Cancer Institute?

01:36:44.107 --> 01:36:46.328
The one that Robert Malone started?

01:36:46.408 --> 01:36:47.649
Like, that's weird.

01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:48.490
I didn't know that.

01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:49.530
Where have I been?

01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:55.054
like the most sweeping change yet, and at one of the few remaining prestige names in news.

01:36:55.094 --> 01:37:02.520
And if one person has suddenly been handed this much power over a whole news organization, it is worth knowing who that one person is.

01:37:03.061 --> 01:37:08.685
So tonight, let's take a look at- Let me just give you an example, though, of why this is not as scary as you think.

01:37:09.005 --> 01:37:13.269
If you gave me control of an aircraft carrier, would I know what to do?

01:37:14.129 --> 01:37:15.791
Would I know what orders to give?

01:37:16.752 --> 01:37:18.493
Would I know what it's capable of?

01:37:19.094 --> 01:37:21.956
Would I know how to use its crew effectively?

01:37:22.636 --> 01:37:28.801
Would I know how to orchestrate its function in the way that optimizes its performance?

01:37:31.022 --> 01:37:35.506
Barry Weiss doesn't have any experience doing anything.

01:37:36.887 --> 01:37:42.731
She's been given everything she was given, including a staff of 40 people, including $150 million.

01:37:42.751 --> 01:37:43.071
It's all fake.

01:37:46.789 --> 01:37:52.830
Just like Jay Bhattacharya does not have the requisite knowledge or career experience to run the NIH.

01:37:53.291 --> 01:38:03.813
He doesn't have the requisite knowledge to have a vision for what the NIH might do as a biology or as a chemistry or as a physics vision.

01:38:03.873 --> 01:38:04.993
He doesn't have any of that.

01:38:06.434 --> 01:38:07.434
He's just a clown.

01:38:12.492 --> 01:38:14.633
And so it is impossible that we are here.

01:38:15.513 --> 01:38:20.974
It is impossible that this guy is real because he's not reporting Barry Weiss as the fraud that she is.

01:38:21.674 --> 01:38:26.136
She's reporting her as the significant person that she isn't.

01:38:27.056 --> 01:38:35.518
The powerful person sitting in a powerful chair, no telling what she'll do, is all part of the narrative.

01:38:35.538 --> 01:38:37.098
But that's gotta be bullshit.

01:38:37.419 --> 01:38:38.699
Who would listen to her?

01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:41.177
Who would work for her?

01:38:41.638 --> 01:38:50.741
If you had a career at CBS News and a nest egg, and you were 5 years or 10 years from retirement, would you work for her or would you just quit?

01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:52.922
Move on to other things?

01:38:53.022 --> 01:38:53.962
Retire early?

01:38:54.842 --> 01:38:56.703
Like this just doesn't make any sense.

01:38:56.823 --> 01:39:01.385
Just like it doesn't make any sense that Donald Trump is running anything right now.

01:39:02.845 --> 01:39:04.146
That's just not possible.

01:39:05.446 --> 01:39:08.007
He just moves from room to room and pretends like it.

01:39:08.939 --> 01:39:12.503
They are all the mouse at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:39:12.523 --> 01:39:15.746
So then what could she possibly do?

01:39:31.221 --> 01:39:45.347
If I'm not a sailor, I don't know anything about guns, I don't know anything about ships or navigation, I don't know anything about how pilots work, or how the deck crew coordinates takeoffs and landings.

01:39:45.687 --> 01:39:49.568
If I don't know anything about what a U.S.

01:39:49.728 --> 01:39:56.791
aircraft carrier is capable of doing, then putting me in charge of it won't really matter.

01:39:58.362 --> 01:40:05.424
And in fact, the people of the aircraft carrier could make me feel like I was doing a great job, and I would never know.

01:40:05.444 --> 01:40:17.607
I could be sitting at the bridge of the aircraft carrier with my big frickin' hat on, and everybody could say, yes, sir, and no, sir, and yes, sir, and wow, sir, what should we do next, sir?

01:40:18.648 --> 01:40:22.709
And it could really feel like I was in charge, and they could all be laughing.

01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:26.310
I'm just going on doing what they do.

01:40:29.397 --> 01:40:31.658
Because the executive officer knows what's up.

01:40:32.758 --> 01:40:34.919
And the executive officer has been briefed.

01:40:35.859 --> 01:40:38.541
Make sure you make Barry feel like she's important.

01:40:39.181 --> 01:40:43.622
Make sure that you tell everybody that asks that Barry Weiss is in charge.

01:40:46.904 --> 01:40:52.646
Make sure you tell everybody on the script that Barry Weiss is in charge.

01:40:53.546 --> 01:40:55.607
And make sure that they make a big deal about it.

01:41:00.675 --> 01:41:01.195
I win.

01:41:01.215 --> 01:41:02.456
I win.

01:41:02.736 --> 01:41:03.357
Checkmate.

01:41:04.277 --> 01:41:04.878
That is true.

01:41:05.398 --> 01:41:11.642
She didn't come up through the news side of a newspaper, but through the opinion pages, which are a very different thing.

01:41:12.242 --> 01:41:16.545
She really made a name for herself after she was hired by the op-ed page for the New York Times in 2017.

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:20.847
And to hear her tell it... Think about what he is saying.

01:41:20.987 --> 01:41:21.888
This is the truth.

01:41:22.448 --> 01:41:24.930
She was hired as an opinion writer?

01:41:26.874 --> 01:41:35.082
This little vapid lesbian Jew child was hired by the New York Times as an opinion writer.

01:41:36.363 --> 01:41:37.944
Did she send in an application?

01:41:38.004 --> 01:41:38.865
Is that how that works?

01:41:39.305 --> 01:41:40.487
Opinion writer wanted?

01:41:41.247 --> 01:41:42.008
Stop lying!

01:41:42.769 --> 01:41:44.110
Stop lying!

01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:48.474
It's such a stupid story, it's kind of funny that he tells it like it's the truth.

01:41:49.134 --> 01:41:50.596
It was for a pretty simple reason.

01:41:51.294 --> 01:41:57.801
To put it bluntly, I was brought in, along with Bret Stephens from the Wall Street Journal, as a kind of intellectual diversity hire.

01:41:57.901 --> 01:42:11.236
My job explicitly was to bring in voices that wouldn't otherwise naturally appear in The New York Times, either because other editors wouldn't think to commission them, or the writers themselves would think, you know, The New York Times would never accept me.

01:42:11.836 --> 01:42:24.380
Yeah, she was apparently tasked with finding voices that the Times op-ed page would never accept, which is already a big claim, given that before she got hired there, it published op-eds from, and this is true, Muammar Gaddafi and Vladimir Putin.

01:42:25.361 --> 01:42:30.242
If the Times had been around in the 15th century, I'm guessing it would have given an opinion piece to Vlad the Impaler.

01:42:30.782 --> 01:42:35.224
Drinking the blood of my enemies isn't disgusting, it's beautiful and courageous.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:44.206
In any case, White started getting attention at the Times for writing provocative pieces like this one, in which he argued that the left had gone too far in policing cultural appropriation.

01:42:44.606 --> 01:42:47.948
This one, a largely sympathetic profile of the intellectual dark web.

01:42:48.348 --> 01:42:52.271
Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web.

01:42:52.371 --> 01:42:56.894
And by the way, here's a picture of it in case you want to Google it and check it out.

01:42:57.355 --> 01:42:59.176
And he's providing it for you.

01:42:59.656 --> 01:43:00.817
How do you like that one?

01:43:02.558 --> 01:43:04.340
A million people saw this

01:43:05.444 --> 01:43:09.266
in the last 24 hours, a million people already saw it.

01:43:09.946 --> 01:43:12.307
She promoted the intellectual dark web.

01:43:12.888 --> 01:43:16.249
Meet the renegades of the intellectual dark web.

01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:18.690
Are you seeing it yet?

01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:22.272
It's all one stupid malevolent show.

01:43:22.312 --> 01:43:33.938
They're all actors associated with Joe Rogan and the Weinsteins because their dad has been associated with this bullshit back since the Lidomide and back since Senator Keefofer.

01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:38.010
That dude who died.

01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:39.951
Now he mentions Ben Shapiro and oh my gosh, really?

01:44:03.717 --> 01:44:07.740
there was actually a well-known hoax site, which is pretty embarrassing.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:20.288
You don't expect a Times writer to fall for online hoaxes like they're your 75-year-old aunt on Facebook who keeps posting that message saying, I hereby state that I do not give my permission to use any of my personal data or photos.

01:44:20.328 --> 01:44:33.477
So that was pretty hard to hear, but she retweeted, now this is already making Twitter relevant, retweeted an Antifa organization Twitter account that was supposedly known to be fraudulent.

01:44:34.177 --> 01:44:38.542
But of course that's the fifth generation warfare at its finest.

01:44:38.962 --> 01:44:49.472
Half the people know it's fraudulent, the other half thinks it's real because the conservative right-wing opinion writer in the New York Times promoted it.

01:44:49.952 --> 01:44:50.613
Do you see it?

01:44:52.114 --> 01:44:55.478
And instead of realizing that this is the theater,

01:44:56.175 --> 01:45:15.917
that his opposition to, his incredulous reaction to her rise is exactly the theater that you're supposed to get engaged in and not understand that she is just as scripted and just as dumb and just as clueless as to what's to come next as John Oliver is.

01:45:18.086 --> 01:45:19.207
That is fake, Linda.

01:45:19.808 --> 01:45:22.171
Also, why would anybody steal your photos?

01:45:23.072 --> 01:45:26.095
You exclusively post pictures of your elderly cat.

01:45:26.936 --> 01:45:28.178
You're going to be fine.

01:45:28.819 --> 01:45:33.164
But things came to a head in 2020 after The Times ran this infamous Tom Cotton op-ed.

01:45:33.544 --> 01:45:34.764
in which he argued that the U.S.

01:45:34.944 --> 01:45:39.266
should send federal troops into cities to tamp down protests against police violence.

01:45:39.586 --> 01:45:50.289
A lot of staffers at The Times argued that it shouldn't have published that editorial, and Barry Weiss wrote a series of tweets about a supposedly heated staff meeting, characterizing it as a civil war between the mostly young wokes...

01:45:50.769 --> 01:45:52.350
and the mostly 40 and up liberals.

01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:57.653
That claim was strongly disputed by others at the paper, with one editor saying, I'm in the same meeting.

01:45:57.834 --> 01:46:14.204
And this all happened on Twitter, which again, according to John Oliver, makes Twitter extremely relevant as a political and social tool and a social place, a forum, where real things happen.

01:46:14.744 --> 01:46:15.405
Stop lying!

01:46:17.381 --> 01:46:19.063
That is the illusion.

01:46:19.743 --> 01:46:21.885
So Barry Weiss was scripted to do it.

01:46:22.585 --> 01:46:24.827
And a lot of other people were scripted to do it.

01:46:24.847 --> 01:46:36.277
And a lot of other people made millions of dollars on controversies on X that have led to vast amounts of wealth just to make social media seem relevant.

01:46:37.058 --> 01:46:38.859
And this is just yet another example.

01:46:38.999 --> 01:46:40.681
And he's just retelling the story.

01:46:41.501 --> 01:46:42.282
Beat for beat.

01:46:42.302 --> 01:46:44.524
I think that Barry appears to be live tweeting.

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.961
This is inaccurate in both characterizations.

01:46:48.341 --> 01:46:53.303
It's not a civil war, it's an editorial conversation, and it's not breaking down a long generational line.

01:46:53.343 --> 01:47:03.548
So, to be fair, it seems Barry Weiss does have some reporting experience, specifically trying to report what was happening in a meeting, only to have her own co-workers say, hey, what the fuck are you talking about?

01:47:04.775 --> 01:47:08.936
Now, shortly after that, she resigned, posting a lengthy resignation letter to her.

01:47:08.956 --> 01:47:18.759
You will also notice that all of these adult, internet-based, podcast-type organizations are now all going to the F-word.

01:47:18.959 --> 01:47:19.940
They all use it.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:25.281
They all use Jesus Christ out loud regularly, but they all use the F-word.

01:47:26.482 --> 01:47:28.362
And it's not considered improper.

01:47:29.243 --> 01:47:29.803
It's okay.

01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:40.416
And I get, I get all kinds of shit from everybody that listens to my show because I use S-H-I-T regularly, or I use the word bullshit regularly, or shithead.

01:47:40.896 --> 01:47:49.902
But these people use the F word regularly with millions of followers and nobody cares because that is the way we're going.

01:47:49.942 --> 01:47:52.004
We're going to destroy American culture.

01:47:52.024 --> 01:47:53.164
We're going to undermine it.

01:47:53.184 --> 01:47:55.286
We're going to make ourselves all ashamed of it.

01:47:56.536 --> 01:48:06.039
Instead of trying to elevate it, instead of trying to make America real again, we're going to control to demolish it with actors pretending to be.

01:48:06.059 --> 01:48:14.642
A website claiming that her forays into wrong think had made her the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views.

01:48:14.702 --> 01:48:19.103
And she now tells the story of that letter in some pretty self-mythologizing terms.

01:48:19.858 --> 01:48:21.720
I thought to myself, I have a choice to make.

01:48:22.541 --> 01:48:23.101
I can stay.

01:48:23.121 --> 01:48:31.209
And in where I lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Seinfeld Territory, telling people you worked at the New York Times really meant something.

01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:34.212
Got you a good table at a good restaurant, among other things.

01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.222
And it meant a lot to me, because I felt like, wow, I made it.

01:48:39.383 --> 01:48:48.489
Or I could leave, and I could give up the prestige, give up the platform, have no plan for what I'm doing next, but leave with my integrity.

01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:49.930
So I left with a

01:48:51.311 --> 01:48:52.372
resignation letters.

01:48:52.612 --> 01:48:57.315
It just doesn't make any sense because it's not, it's not clear even what she really believes.

01:48:57.595 --> 01:48:58.675
I got fired.

01:48:58.835 --> 01:48:59.856
I didn't resign.

01:48:59.936 --> 01:49:07.420
And what did I get fired for for speaking out about a transfection technology being relabeled as an investigative vaccine?

01:49:08.301 --> 01:49:09.902
I can explain it pretty succinctly.

01:49:10.922 --> 01:49:23.448
It is corroborated by my career, corroborated by six years of podcasting, corroborated by a misrepresentation in the acknowledgements of Robert F. Kennedy's book, The Wuhan Covered Up.

01:49:24.288 --> 01:49:32.792
And it is, and it is backed up by six years of pay stub or six months of pay stubs from the shitty organization called Children's Health Defense.

01:49:36.644 --> 01:49:38.145
I can lay it out very clearly.

01:49:38.205 --> 01:49:46.607
The only thing that she can do is point to you a couple events that happened on the script and then try to gloss over the time in between as much as possible.

01:49:46.647 --> 01:49:49.108
When in reality, there was no struggle.

01:49:49.448 --> 01:49:50.669
There was only a script.

01:49:50.989 --> 01:49:55.070
Had a lot of waiting in between key events because otherwise it doesn't work.

01:49:57.991 --> 01:50:00.552
These are scripted frauds.

01:50:01.482 --> 01:50:04.167
They are the worst Americans alive.

01:50:04.288 --> 01:50:07.634
Barry Weiss is just an ugly piece of garbage.

01:50:07.754 --> 01:50:08.456
It's awful.

01:50:08.476 --> 01:50:10.099
Sort of heard round the world.

01:50:10.119 --> 01:50:12.504
Uh, it was my Jerry Maguire moment.

01:50:13.305 --> 01:50:13.506
Okay.

01:50:15.268 --> 01:50:21.430
Self-aggrandizing bullshit aside, let's not reduce the Upper West Side to just Seinfeld territory.

01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:34.275
It's the site of many other cultural touchdowns, like You've Got Mail, Will & Grace, and that time the night before the Macy's parade when Balloon Spider-Man made an absolute meal out of Uncle Sam's ass.

01:50:34.795 --> 01:50:38.076
My point is, the Upper West Side is more than just one thing.

01:50:39.369 --> 01:50:45.791
Anyway, she quickly launched her own publication, first as a substack called Common Sense, and later as a full-blown media company, The Free Press.

01:50:46.171 --> 01:50:52.134
Its first motto was, honest news for sane people, which feels scientifically engineered to trigger an eye roll.

01:50:52.714 --> 01:50:55.695
Here she is, not long after starting it, making her pitch.

01:50:56.528 --> 01:51:15.948
I want to create the media company where people can go for the best podcasts, the best reporting, the best analysis, basically combining the blue chip high quality of the old media landscape with the punk energy of the new political realignment.

01:51:16.448 --> 01:51:19.273
I mean, that is how stupid this is.

01:51:20.055 --> 01:51:26.106
And that is now called a right-wing media outlet and reported to have sold for $150 million.

01:51:26.366 --> 01:51:28.190
And he's reporting it that way as well.

01:51:29.065 --> 01:51:31.667
even though he's a comedian, he can tell the truth.

01:51:32.287 --> 01:51:35.710
He's not really telling you the truth, he's just telling you the other side of the narrative.

01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:45.797
It's one metal sphere, and inside these little motorcycles are riding around, and they're not actually going anywhere, and they're not actually taking any risks at all.

01:51:46.297 --> 01:51:50.240
They're just three people that don't get dizzy as they keep lying in circles.

01:51:51.775 --> 01:52:00.681
OK, first, it is pretty hard to claim you've got punk energy when you essentially spout conservative talking points while dressed like the front desk manager at a Courtyard Marriott.

01:52:01.882 --> 01:52:06.665
I, for one, do not trust the punk bona fides of anyone wearing an Ann Taylor collarless silk blouse.

01:52:07.586 --> 01:52:17.993
But it turns out, like most punk rock things, the free press was quickly bankrolled by a string of reactionary billionaires like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and David Saxon in the five years since.

01:52:18.253 --> 01:52:18.613
And so.

01:52:19.614 --> 01:52:44.804
Any substack or press organization that gets bankrolled by billionaires is by definition not a real grassroots press organization, would never be a part of the independent bright web, and is the exact antithesis of what I am, what my family represents, what GigaOM Biological LLC represents, which is a sole proprietorship in Pennsylvania,

01:52:45.916 --> 01:52:50.100
run by one biologist or two biologists, because you can count my wife.

01:52:52.602 --> 01:52:53.423
And so that's it.

01:52:53.903 --> 01:52:55.104
That's the reality of it.

01:52:55.925 --> 01:52:57.526
You can follow billionaires.

01:52:57.727 --> 01:53:01.370
You can follow mainstream millionaires.

01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:05.213
You can follow anyone you want on social media.

01:53:06.014 --> 01:53:08.036
And there are very few people like me.

01:53:09.065 --> 01:53:27.203
Very few people like me in the back of my garage with my own equipment that I got off of Craigslist or out of a garbage can, my own equipment that I'm running, my own show that I'm producing, my own script that I'm making up as I go along, my own talking points that I choose sometimes over coffee with my wife or on a dog walk.

01:53:27.763 --> 01:53:30.384
That is what Giga Home Biological is.

01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:32.584
And that's not what Joe Rogan is.

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:35.025
That's not what any of these people are.

01:53:35.205 --> 01:53:49.747
Any of these people with a book, any of these people with a non-profit called Children's Health Defense or ICANN that was started before the pandemic and rose to prominence, these people are all scripted traitors to our grandchildren.

01:53:50.768 --> 01:53:52.468
And I believe they belong in jail.

01:53:57.679 --> 01:54:01.500
This guy can't be called a traitor because he's just a scripted actor.

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.162
But he is pretending to be much more than that, and that's what makes it so malevolent.

01:54:07.902 --> 01:54:20.366
It's grown to roughly 1.5 million readers, although only around 1 in 10 actually pay to subscribe, meaning it generates subscription revenues of about $15 million a year, which isn't nothing, but... $15 million a year on Substack!

01:54:28.413 --> 01:54:39.081
I would argue, also not quite enough to justify someone spending $150 million to acquire it, as that is a revenues to valuation ratio that would make Mr. Wonderful start vomiting blood.

01:54:40.282 --> 01:54:48.969
Anyway, Weiss has since stalked the free press with staffers who, in some cases, are quick to brag that, like her, they are proud refugees from the mainstream media.

01:54:49.707 --> 01:54:50.368
Hey, I'm Lucy.

01:54:50.428 --> 01:54:56.552
I'm the social media editor here at the Free Press, and today I'm gonna ask my coworkers the moment they realized they were free pressers.

01:54:56.853 --> 01:54:58.674
Olivia, when did you realize that you were a free presser?

01:54:59.014 --> 01:55:05.139
Um, when I was reporting for... on President Trump, and they inserted the word racist into the headline.

01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:15.127
Okay, so just to be clear, she was apparently reporting for NPR, even though that bleep makes it seem like she used to write for an outlet called the Fuck Whole Times or something.

01:55:16.739 --> 01:55:18.581
And the word race... F word again.

01:55:19.803 --> 01:55:20.944
Sex reference again.

01:55:21.785 --> 01:55:31.215
...was atop a story of hers about public response to Trump saying these four members of Congress, all American citizens, three of whom were born in the US, should go back to the countries they came from.

01:55:31.555 --> 01:55:36.180
And I guess if you're not ready to call that racist, the free press might be the place for you.

01:55:36.961 --> 01:55:41.325
One of Barry Weiss' go-to lines is that she's only interested in the truth.

01:55:41.786 --> 01:55:50.093
In announcing her decision to go to CBS this week, she said, which sounds great.

01:55:50.673 --> 01:55:56.739
But watch her articulate the free press' approach to arriving at the truth and see if you can spot a small problem with it.

01:55:57.307 --> 01:56:03.570
The identity of our brand is truth-seeking, and our premise is you cannot get to truth in an echo chamber.

01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:10.333
The only way that you get to truth is by sitting next to some... This is what makes it so different from any newsroom I've ever worked in.

01:56:10.913 --> 01:56:18.016
Sitting next to someone who disagrees with you, you still respect, admire them, and collaborate with them.

01:56:20.885 --> 01:56:23.385
I mean... I mean, maybe... That was genuinely funny.

01:56:23.405 --> 01:56:28.606
Maybe that is how you do it as an opinion writer, but that is not how you get to truth as a reporter, is it?

01:56:29.107 --> 01:56:32.027
You do that by leaving the newsroom and reporting.

01:56:32.467 --> 01:56:38.788
That's not saying the only way to hold Henry Kissinger's skull in your hand is by sitting next to someone who disagrees with you.

01:56:38.828 --> 01:56:39.668
No, that's not it.

01:56:40.509 --> 01:56:47.190
You do that by leaving your desk, breaking into Dick Cheney's house, going into his master bathroom, and taking it out of its jar.

01:56:48.567 --> 01:56:52.930
And I'll be honest, there's not a ton of hard journalism on the free press sites.

01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:55.052
There's really not much of anything there.

01:56:55.072 --> 01:57:01.396
There's usually just a handful of new posts a day, which can even include weird shit like editorial cartoons from David Mamet, the playwright.

01:57:01.657 --> 01:57:05.700
And if you're thinking, I didn't realize David Mamet could draw, fun fact, he can't, but...

01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:11.883
Don't worry, because that hasn't stopped him from producing cartoons like this one that says, what's the best way to deal with detractors?

01:57:12.283 --> 01:57:14.224
With the answer being, a manual for tractors.

01:57:14.664 --> 01:57:19.407
Or this one, supposedly about environmentalism, that just says, shoving eggs up the tushies of chickens.

01:57:20.087 --> 01:57:27.972
Or this one of an autobiography by Kermit the Frog with a blurb that says, ribbiting, which, I'm worried, might be too funny.

01:57:29.249 --> 01:57:35.434
There are also a ton of first-person clickbait essays with titles like, I can explain why the Nazi salute is back.

01:57:35.714 --> 01:57:38.016
I criticized BLM, then I was fired.

01:57:38.256 --> 01:57:40.097
I took religion out of Christmas, I regret it.

01:57:40.357 --> 01:57:42.459
I want people to have more kids, does that make me far right?

01:57:42.739 --> 01:57:44.841
I was called an inbred swine at Princeton last night.

01:57:45.221 --> 01:57:47.303
I'm 17 and I'm immunized from woke politics.

01:57:47.543 --> 01:57:50.205
My family was hunted by Nazis, but I was fired for defending Hitler.

01:57:50.485 --> 01:57:53.127
My husband wants to be cremated, I'd ignore his dying wish.

01:57:53.207 --> 01:57:55.649
And I used to hate Trump, now I'm a maggot lefty.

01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:57.891
At this point, it feels like we're just two weeks away

01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:04.053
from them posting an article titled, I dressed my dead wife up as Hitler for her funeral, and now her woke family is mad at me.

01:58:05.374 --> 01:58:14.437
And look, if you go to the homepage of the free press, it might not immediately read as a... Now, I think that it's nice what just was put in the chat there.

01:58:14.497 --> 01:58:17.398
What you see here is a lot of sound and fury.

01:58:17.718 --> 01:58:26.461
It is an incredibly vigorous argument about Barry Weiss and about the relevance of her and what she's gonna do and what CBS can do and what Barry...

01:58:26.881 --> 01:58:36.567
Larry Ellison or his son's gonna do, and whether the free press is bad or good, and we're learning all kinds of things about something that we don't know anything, we don't need to know anything about.

01:58:37.908 --> 01:58:41.230
It could just be left to be irrelevant.

01:58:43.091 --> 01:58:48.715
And it's only really relevant to the suckers that are still paying money every month to the free press, right?

01:58:48.755 --> 01:58:54.118
That's the only person that it would ever be relevant to, the person that actually thought that they should give money to that person.

01:58:57.290 --> 01:59:03.115
Very few people that have subscribed to GigaOMBiological at GigaOMBiological.com have regretted it.

01:59:03.695 --> 01:59:11.881
And the ones that have actually believe that Joe Rogan is a truth teller, actually believe that Alex Jones is a truth teller, and I'm wrong about both of those guys.

01:59:12.362 --> 01:59:15.484
Those are the subscribers that I've lost in the last couple weeks.

01:59:15.524 --> 01:59:15.944
That's it.

01:59:16.945 --> 01:59:19.227
Everybody else seems to be in for the long run.

01:59:19.287 --> 01:59:23.170
Even the people that are giving hundreds of dollars a month have not wavered.

01:59:24.488 --> 01:59:37.992
And it is because we are fighting for something real, talking about something that's real, reliving a history that needs to be passed on to our children about manslaughter and lies in 2020, 21, and 22.

01:59:38.572 --> 01:59:46.414
Millions of Americans being killed, not by a virus, not by a gain of function, but by lies, by orchestrated liars.

01:59:48.746 --> 01:59:50.427
a particularly conservative outlet.

01:59:50.447 --> 01:59:55.772
But once you start reading its articles, the pronounced theme that starts to emerge is, the left has gone too far.

01:59:56.293 --> 02:00:04.059
Basically, whatever issue you feel like that is true for, Israel, campus politics, DEI or police reform, you'll find articles there to reinforce that opinion.

02:00:04.099 --> 02:00:10.185
And look, I'm not saying the left never goes too far or that it's immune from criticism at all.

02:00:10.805 --> 02:00:21.112
But it can sometimes feel like the free press's conclusions can get out ahead of its evidence, which brings us to the fact that some of its pieces can be pretty poorly fact-checked and in ways that feel important.

02:00:21.692 --> 02:00:23.814
And let's look at three key examples.

02:00:23.854 --> 02:00:28.277
Now, he's going to now, of course, show you that the free press has been pretty sloppy.

02:00:28.817 --> 02:00:32.740
Again, another odd thing to be if you're worth $150 million.

02:00:35.307 --> 02:00:42.211
It's another odd thing to be if you're gonna be promoted to the chief editor of a large news organization.

02:00:42.292 --> 02:00:48.375
It's an odd thing to be so easily pointed out that 60 Minutes is gonna miss it.

02:00:48.876 --> 02:00:50.937
That Democracy Now missed it.

02:00:51.898 --> 02:00:56.841
Because they didn't do any investigation at all, they just accepted the script that they are given.

02:00:57.341 --> 02:01:01.384
This guy's also accepting the script that he's given, because he doesn't do his own work.

02:01:02.324 --> 02:01:04.546
He's got a staff too, of course, you know that.

02:01:06.502 --> 02:01:11.404
one of its biggest splashes, this article, I Thought I Was Saving Trans Kids, Now I'm Blowing the Whistle.

02:01:11.784 --> 02:01:16.286
It's an account by Jamie Reid, who'd worked as a case worker at the Washington University Transgender Center.

02:01:16.326 --> 02:01:26.530
Her piece claims that the clinic was harming patients by, among other things, routinely approving adolescents for medical transitions without proper mental health assessments, calling its work morally and medically appalling.

02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:35.794
Now, that story, understandably, got a ton of attention, including from public officials, which prompted Weister Goh and Megyn Kelly's podcast to take something of a victory lap.

02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:47.239
The day after the piece published, I've never seen such a sort of rapid reaction to a piece of journalism, Missouri's Attorney General announced an investigation into the gender clinic.

02:01:47.339 --> 02:01:51.503
The reason that this story was especially important and gratifying for us

02:01:51.983 --> 02:01:58.325
to have substantiated was because it's exactly the kind of story that we exist to pursue.

02:01:58.886 --> 02:02:07.789
It's exactly the kind of morally naughty story in which journalists avoid pursuing it because they know they will be punished or smeared for doing so.

02:02:08.369 --> 02:02:10.570
That is why the free press exists.

02:02:11.274 --> 02:02:18.577
Wow, that is an exceptional amount of self-congratulation, and the bar was already set at the Jerry Maguire moment heard around the world.

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:20.138
But she is right.

02:02:20.578 --> 02:02:33.924
The state AG apparently found that article to borrow a term, ribbiting, because they soon announced an investigation into the center, and it ultimately stopped treating minors, with Reid's claims even being used to help justify a statewide ban on gender-affirming care for them.

02:02:33.964 --> 02:02:35.945
So it did have real impact.

02:02:36.513 --> 02:02:46.285
which is what makes it so awkward, that when Washington University conducted its own investigation, they found that allegations of substandard care causing adverse outcomes for patients at the center were unsubstantiated.

02:02:46.605 --> 02:02:53.113
And when other outlets reported the story out again and again, their findings did not match what the free press published.

02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:54.313
First is the St.

02:02:54.353 --> 02:03:01.635
Louis Post-Dispatch found dozens of former patients and parents at the clinic who told them their experiences sharply contradicted the examples supplied by Reed.

02:03:01.915 --> 02:03:09.437
NBC spent two months reaching out to nearly 40 people associated with the center and got the same result with patients and parents saying the care they received was thorough and slow.

02:03:09.897 --> 02:03:19.939
And the Missouri Independent found parents who told them any treatments their kids received were only undertaken after long consultations with doctors and mental health professionals and often... These are all scripted frauds, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:19.979 --> 02:03:22.120
They're all on a national security script.

02:03:22.140 --> 02:03:22.940
You know they eat

02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:31.146
Babies that is not bullshit It's true you have to accept the dogs and the cats not just the pets.

02:03:31.546 --> 02:03:34.689
It's all a script It's not just the dogs and the cats

02:03:35.953 --> 02:03:42.076
They're full on vampires and everybody still thinks I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy.

02:03:42.356 --> 02:03:49.860
I think one of the easiest ways to see it is to try and look at their track record and their lack of intellectual progress throughout the pandemic and before.

02:03:50.340 --> 02:04:03.527
I think you can see these health fake freedom frauds for the lack of progress that they make for their limited spectrum of debate with regard to, I don't know, I'm a mitochondria person or I'm a microbiome person, but they don't make progress.

02:04:04.147 --> 02:04:14.700
They don't learn anything, even though there's plenty to learn and there's plenty of irreducible complexity to be able to adequately describe and enunciate and outline.

02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:16.822
And yet none of these people were ever able to do it.

02:04:17.183 --> 02:04:19.566
That's because they are on a national security script.

02:04:19.626 --> 02:04:23.571
The fake health freedom movement, they're all part of this illusion.

02:04:24.091 --> 02:04:30.792
and they're all part of managing a population pyramid with murder and lies because this is for all the marbles, this is for the grandchildren of Earth.

02:04:31.333 --> 02:04:42.695
They want us to turn over our sovereignty willingly through fear and coercion and that's the reason why Elon, Jeff, Peter, Alex, Mark, Bobby and Donnie are so ridiculous, that's for sure.

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:45.516
And even this little Shaun the Sheep can see it.

02:04:45.576 --> 02:04:47.136
They are traitorous talking heads.

02:04:48.256 --> 02:04:50.378
They are Max Headroom from hell.

02:04:51.198 --> 02:04:54.040
And the reason why they're doing this is because of bad biology.

02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.040
They've got to protect it.

02:04:55.921 --> 02:05:01.024
What they thought was going to be done in a couple decades back in 1950 is not even close to done.

02:05:01.524 --> 02:05:09.549
The irreducibly complex problem of heredity and genetics has not been solved in the simplest of examples.

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:14.993
and therefore is not going to be solved in one of the most complex examples that of the human being.

02:05:15.493 --> 02:05:18.155
And so this human genome project is just started.

02:05:18.635 --> 02:05:27.122
The data collection is just being iterated, just being tested because the infrastructure is necessary to store such a data set have just been assembled.

02:05:27.562 --> 02:05:36.489
And so the interface between genetic data and medical data is already going to be one of these tasks that they are going to employ AI to try and crack.

02:05:36.949 --> 02:05:40.451
has another iteration, chest, then go, then this, then that.

02:05:40.871 --> 02:05:45.673
Protein folding is not solved, otherwise they would have already figured out how prions work by now.

02:05:46.074 --> 02:05:55.218
But I guess, even though they have Google Fold, they haven't been able to figure out the simple way that prions, I guess only one molecule's enough to hurt you.

02:05:55.618 --> 02:06:02.722
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the culmination of a long con, and the people on the internet that are involved in this long con can't quit.

02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:04.531
They can't stop.

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:08.433
That's the reason why it's as ugly as it is right now.

02:06:08.493 --> 02:06:09.713
They cannot stop.

02:06:11.494 --> 02:06:13.395
Ladies and gentlemen, PeerTube is the way out.

02:06:13.455 --> 02:06:16.997
Chief Wuhan actually says that PeerTube is the antidote.

02:06:18.018 --> 02:06:30.005
If you haven't already, download PeerTube, the app, and then put in stream.gigaohm.bio as your PeerTube platform, and everything that I do will be available to you on your phone with no

02:06:31.675 --> 02:06:34.055
log in with no data being shared.

02:06:34.576 --> 02:06:43.757
It is the only alternative to social media that isn't this corporate government data collection bullshit.

02:06:44.757 --> 02:06:50.278
In case you're not aware, intramuscular injections, a dumb idea from the late 1800s, transfection in healthy humans is a crime.

02:06:50.818 --> 02:06:54.239
RNA cannot pandemic and autism is a meaningless word by design.

02:06:54.659 --> 02:07:00.460
You're going to have a hard time finding anybody else on the internet with the capability, with the intellectual background and the

02:07:01.101 --> 02:07:07.749
and has put in the necessary work to be able to state things as clearly as we do here at GigaOM Biological.

02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:15.439
Please keep in mind that this, for example, is one of the wonderful admissions that we have going on right now.

02:07:16.921 --> 02:07:17.843
Up there in the corner,

02:07:19.136 --> 02:07:28.652
is a fella who I originally streamed with back in 2020 when I was still employed at the University of Pittsburgh.

02:07:29.033 --> 02:07:32.900
He is an associate of Robert Malone, Steve Kirsch, and George Webb.

02:07:34.431 --> 02:07:38.996
George Webb is that infamous guy on 60 Minutes in February about the Wuhan Games.

02:07:39.136 --> 02:07:50.229
George Webb is a complete fraud, but he is intimately associated with the orchestrators of this conservative social media bamboozlement that occurred during 2020, 2021, and 2022 about the lab leak, about PCR.

02:07:53.112 --> 02:07:54.492
How about the Omicron variant?

02:07:54.692 --> 02:08:04.875
Everything that got the health freedom movement moving in the direction that was directly behind Children's Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:08:04.955 --> 02:08:06.575
And that was by design.

02:08:07.356 --> 02:08:10.316
And anybody that was looking for that door would have found it.

02:08:10.697 --> 02:08:19.919
And one of the people that they might have found on the darkest corners of the internet was that guy right there, Kevin McCairn, who was recruited specifically to deal with me.

02:08:20.933 --> 02:08:30.936
because he's a neuroscientist with a neuroscience record on PubMed and actually worked with one of the people who was now a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh.

02:08:30.976 --> 02:08:39.539
And so he could call me up in 2020 and claim that he was doing live streams and he noticed my work on YouTube and we have a guy in common.

02:08:40.339 --> 02:08:43.402
because I did a postdoc with a guy who works in your department now.

02:08:43.622 --> 02:08:44.743
Oh, wow, that's crazy.

02:08:44.803 --> 02:08:46.125
Well, I should do a stream with you.

02:08:46.545 --> 02:08:55.153
And so for five weekends in a row, I streamed with three George Webb associates that I thought were just three random guys on the internet trying to see through the illusion.

02:08:56.112 --> 02:09:13.466
when in reality they were part of this internet clown show that would be there to control a narrative about a worst case scenario that was a lab leak with a toxic spike protein so that the fundamental truth about transfection would be under the control of these clowns.

02:09:14.347 --> 02:09:20.452
This guy came to my house three years later in 2022 and I probably should have done something to him then.

02:09:21.553 --> 02:09:23.995
But he's such a small potatoes player.

02:09:26.138 --> 02:09:43.464
but he actually claims to be the guy that gave the unopened, sealed vials of mRNA vaccine to Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project that provided him with the chain of custody to say that he tested unmolested vials.

02:09:44.224 --> 02:09:48.765
This guy who Steve Kirsch wanted to send me to Japan to work on mouse experiments in 2022.

02:09:49.106 --> 02:09:56.128
This guy who had Charles Rixey sleep at his house for like a half a year in Japan.

02:09:56.548 --> 02:10:01.330
Charles Rixey also came to my house about a month after Kevin McKernan was on my stream in 2021.

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:19.207
I have been the victim of a very elaborate hoax that ultimately connects itself to Steve Bannon and Gavin DeBecker and Robert Malone and Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:10:20.444 --> 02:10:35.797
And I think at least some of these people are guilty of interfering with my ability to make a living as an American citizen, interfering with the function of my business, the ability for me to perform as a professional on purpose.

02:10:36.798 --> 02:10:40.641
They deceived me and my family with text messages and emails.

02:10:42.888 --> 02:10:44.068
I think there's a case here.

02:10:44.148 --> 02:11:12.234
And they coordinated with international people, including the 100,000 Genomes Project director or senior pathologist, Claire Craig, who was on the original Corman-Jorston paper that has Mike Eden and Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Thomas Binder, all who would go on to be very influential people on X and on the alternative social media throughout the worst case scenario times.

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:16.721
and they're still talking about each other today.

02:11:17.181 --> 02:11:30.626
This clown, this absolute waste of human space, is still wasting his time not talking about me anymore because that would reveal that he is just a stooge.

02:11:31.047 --> 02:11:42.231
So instead he's doing what he's scripted to do and talking about these people who are the exact same people that are behind CHD, behind Hart, behind Brownstone, behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:11:43.231 --> 02:11:48.014
The entire health freedom movement around the world has been faked on social media.

02:11:48.474 --> 02:11:50.736
Claire Craig is one of the biggest fakes.

02:11:51.456 --> 02:11:54.138
Along with, who else is he watching?

02:11:54.939 --> 02:11:56.520
The Campbell guy.

02:11:56.660 --> 02:12:03.084
And the three of them are talking about Marc Girardeau, another fake person from the Panda Organization.

02:12:03.752 --> 02:12:08.714
who all of whom I was calling out as fake in 2022.

02:12:09.194 --> 02:12:26.101
But now we're in October of 2025 and this scripted fraud on the same team has Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, who are ultimately behind Merrill Nass and Mary Holland at CHD, is now agreeing to talk about the same shitheads.

02:12:27.017 --> 02:12:48.170
and say that they stole some of my data, but I'm ultimately the one that gave the DNA to Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project and showed the DNA contamination, which I'm sure in the next year or so will become more and more mainstream in a small section of the people on the internet that are still convinced that they have some grip on reality, which they don't.

02:12:50.993 --> 02:12:51.473
has gone on.

02:12:52.174 --> 02:13:02.420
And if you get the big ones, then probably less likely to end up in a vessel unless it's injected directly into a vessel, which can happen.

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:04.521
So Mark Girard has done a lot of work on this.

02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:05.822
Do you know his bonus theory?

02:13:06.062 --> 02:13:07.083
Fuck that frog cunt.

02:13:07.303 --> 02:13:13.887
He took my data and just fucking didn't even give attribution and just wrapped it into fucking nonsense.

02:13:14.307 --> 02:13:15.608
But the bonus theory.

02:13:18.190 --> 02:13:35.164
I was saying that when Marc Giraudeau was first promoted by Panda, when I was still in the organization and still thought that Nick Hudson was okay, still thought that Jessica Hockett was okay, still thought that Jonathan Engler, also of heart, was okay.

02:13:36.570 --> 02:13:45.633
That is three years ago, and we're supposed to believe that this fat, scripted clown is now just getting around to saying that Marc Giraudeau is a fake.

02:13:45.733 --> 02:13:49.094
No, it's because the script took that long.

02:13:49.714 --> 02:14:04.199
It's because this scripted clown show took that long, and now all three of these people, like it or not, agree that Marc Giraudeau's idea is worth talking about, and even he is gonna say the words intramuscular injection without ever telling you

02:14:04.759 --> 02:14:30.296
that the truth of intramuscular injection for augmenting the immune system is found in the organization of the immune system itself instead he's going to tell you that lipid nanoparticles can carry prions to your brain whether it hits a vessel or not and that makes him a liar it makes him a piece of shit it makes him a traitor to my kids and it makes him a criminal right the intramuscular off that paper that i just brought up

02:14:30.649 --> 02:14:33.273
is enough to get those particles into the brain.

02:14:33.593 --> 02:14:40.744
Of course, if you put it directly into a vessel, you'll get more going up there, but in terms of amyloids, it doesn't matter, right?

02:14:40.964 --> 02:14:44.089
There is no safe working dose.

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:45.070
None.

02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:48.271
And so he's been on the internet for six years saying that.

02:14:48.371 --> 02:14:55.832
He's made no intellectual, intellectual progress since him and Walter Chestnut talked about this shit in 2021.

02:14:56.213 --> 02:15:03.054
He's made no intellectual progress on this since Jessica Rose wrote a spike protein amyloidosis substack back in 2021.

02:15:03.114 --> 02:15:04.494
These people belong in jail.

02:15:08.396 --> 02:15:11.138
Jessica Rose is a criminal.

02:15:11.498 --> 02:15:13.460
Kevin McCairn is a criminal.

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:29.771
The fact that Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn were both on Steve Kirsch's podcast last year makes them criminals and it makes them admittedly part of the same team of fraudulent criminals behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:15:30.372 --> 02:15:34.375
and CHD and therefore American criminals.

02:15:38.683 --> 02:15:40.026
consider it like asbestos.

02:15:49.014 --> 02:15:53.158
When you inject into a muscle, you're putting in a liquid into a space where there wasn't a space.

02:15:53.198 --> 02:15:56.240
So you have a high pressure balloon of liquid.

02:15:56.821 --> 02:16:17.538
And when the needle goes in... Think about how absurd it is that after six years of me trying to say that it's about the organization of the immune system and intramuscular injections, just dumb, not even knowing that Brandy Vaughn died saying the same thing before the pandemic, that they're still unable to say it as a doctor and a nurse

02:16:18.118 --> 02:16:23.441
and a PhD they all can't get there and he's just going to vape right through it.

02:16:24.822 --> 02:16:32.005
You will break small vessels with the needle so depending how near that needle is to the high pressure balloon of liquid you're going to get a different dose entering the vessel.

02:16:33.506 --> 02:16:42.971
Just bolus theory just doesn't look yes there's some damage but to say that it's everything doesn't account for the

02:16:44.031 --> 02:16:59.380
the symptom profiles that we see which is micro clotting from the microscopic level to the macro and that macro level can be tens of centimeters to tens of grams

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:04.003
So it's operating across orders of magnitude greater.

02:17:04.403 --> 02:17:12.509
But plugging it as the only issue at hand, I'm afraid, is... Now I understand that nobody watches him.

02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:15.391
What I want you to show you is that he can't stop.

02:17:16.548 --> 02:17:21.495
If he stops, they admit that he's always been a fraud.

02:17:22.356 --> 02:17:24.719
That's essentially what's happened with Charles Rixey.

02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:30.987
By pulling Charles Rixey off the playing field, they have admitted that Charles Rixey is a fraud.

02:17:31.408 --> 02:17:39.252
that Kevin McKernan going on the Danny Jones podcast in November of 2024 and saying that he helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:17:39.292 --> 02:17:43.714
write that book was a national security lie because my name's in the book.

02:17:44.074 --> 02:17:47.636
Because I know that Charles Rixey was fired during the writing of that book.

02:17:48.136 --> 02:17:52.418
Fraudulently, fake fired, but still he was fake fired.

02:17:52.458 --> 02:17:53.919
And at the time I thought it was real.

02:17:54.259 --> 02:18:00.322
And that guy and Charles spent the next two years telling everybody that would listen on Rumble that I was a liar.

02:18:00.942 --> 02:18:04.846
that I got Charlie fired, but Charles Rixey is a fraud.

02:18:05.747 --> 02:18:21.782
He's a fraud that probably works for the State Department, the same probably who pays him, probably who paid her, NATO, State Department, probably working for the DOE and the Human Genome Project, which is in the DOE, you know, the same place where Nukes is.

02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:34.633
This is all one shitty malevolent show of American traitors and international traitors that have manipulated Americans into believing that the worst case scenario was possible or happened.

02:18:36.613 --> 02:18:38.094
And these people belong in jail.

02:18:38.134 --> 02:18:40.355
And I'm one of the only people that can testify.

02:18:40.455 --> 02:18:45.696
The only people that's got the text messages, the only people that knows what that fat shit smells like.

02:18:46.737 --> 02:18:49.518
Because I took the time to sit in a bar with him in Pittsburgh.

02:18:49.538 --> 02:18:50.738
I didn't let him come to my house.

02:18:52.247 --> 02:18:58.772
But he drove to Pittsburgh to see me in 2022 when he knew I already thought he was a fraud.

02:19:00.933 --> 02:19:06.437
And we never talked about anything in that bar that was worth talking about because he knew I already knew he was a fraud.

02:19:09.239 --> 02:19:10.520
That's how scared they were in 2022.

02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:11.941
They tried, they tried.

02:19:15.302 --> 02:19:16.964
That's how scared they were in 2023.

02:19:17.525 --> 02:19:18.125
They tried.

02:19:18.185 --> 02:19:19.066
They put me in the book.

02:19:19.107 --> 02:19:25.754
They hired me at CHD and I argued with them and I called them frauds in their own fricking Zoom meetings.

02:19:25.895 --> 02:19:29.899
I called them frauds on my podcast while I was getting paid from them.

02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:31.361
I didn't care.

02:19:31.381 --> 02:19:35.326
I wasn't afraid because I believe what I say.

02:19:36.883 --> 02:19:47.226
I believe that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s and might be responsible for harming a lot of people in the last 50 or 100 years.

02:19:47.327 --> 02:20:00.411
I believe that with all my heart, and I believe it so much so that I'm sure the national security state would put shitheads out there that would never be able to explain that to you with an adequate enough nuance so that you could get there.

02:20:01.704 --> 02:20:10.649
And instead would say stupid things, you know, like vaccines cause autism or it must be the adjuvants like thimerosal or, uh, or aluminum.

02:20:15.171 --> 02:20:16.011
And he's one of them.

02:20:16.451 --> 02:20:17.232
She's one of them.

02:20:17.712 --> 02:20:18.773
Campbell's one of them.

02:20:19.033 --> 02:20:20.273
Giordano's one of them.

02:20:20.373 --> 02:20:21.494
McKernan's one of them.

02:20:21.834 --> 02:20:22.955
Malone is one of them.

02:20:23.015 --> 02:20:25.516
The entire Barrington declaration is one of them.

02:20:25.936 --> 02:20:27.537
Jay Bhattacharya is one of them.

02:20:27.997 --> 02:20:31.219
I know because I tried my best to work with them.

02:20:34.284 --> 02:20:35.725
as naive as that sounds.

02:20:35.785 --> 02:20:38.027
It's gaslighting public right now.

02:20:38.307 --> 02:20:40.228
It better get fucking better, Claire, from here.

02:20:40.248 --> 02:20:42.750
It can be that the whole thing just gets squeezed right in.

02:20:42.910 --> 02:20:44.992
He's going to give her a chance to get better?

02:20:45.552 --> 02:20:45.993
Why?

02:20:46.333 --> 02:20:52.718
Because she's part of the same scripted theatre that he's a part of, albeit he is a much lower on the rung.

02:20:52.778 --> 02:20:56.280
He was never able to really herd any cats that were meaningful.

02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:02.145
His main job was to herd me, to distract me, to upset me, and he's failed.

02:21:03.069 --> 02:21:08.753
He's now only thing he is in his existence is a collective admission of guilt.

02:21:09.134 --> 02:21:15.738
His existence, his connections to Kirsch and McKernan connect him directly to Robert Malone.

02:21:16.119 --> 02:21:32.451
His connections to George Webb connect him directly to Robert Malone, which means he is part of a national security operation loosely associated with the DOE and DITRA because Robert Malone is loosely associated with the DOE and DITRA.

02:21:33.775 --> 02:21:43.826
And certainly because of Kevin McKernan also being behind the scenes at Children's Health Defense, there's no reason not to assume that these organizations are wholly part of the show.

02:21:45.208 --> 02:21:46.049
Sabotaged.

02:21:47.631 --> 02:21:51.355
Any parents that are in those organizations are being fooled by these assholes.

02:21:51.415 --> 02:22:06.389
It's not political 5D chess, it's just a national security operation that involves actors on other continents being shown to Americans because their goofy glasses and their shitty English accents are convincing.

02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:09.632
Or it can be that it's diffused over a slower time.

02:22:10.032 --> 02:22:11.714
And I guess the size of the different nanoparticles might

02:22:12.228 --> 02:22:14.591
alter what gets into the vessel as well.

02:22:15.212 --> 02:22:17.395
I don't know what scale I'm on when I'm saying that, I might be wrong.

02:22:17.875 --> 02:22:24.824
But people as well, many videos I've seen of people giving these injections, they seem to take a pride in how quickly they can do it and how painless it is.

02:22:25.505 --> 02:22:29.590
And of course, the more quickly you squirt it in, the higher the pressure is going to be and the more small blood vessels you're going to disrupt.

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:30.875
That's right.

02:22:30.915 --> 02:22:39.839
And I mean, the thing that about Mark's work, really, the thing that sort of really hits home with me is when he's looking at studies from a long time ago, because this is something that's really, you know, there was a huge amount of research on.

02:22:39.919 --> 02:22:49.664
And so that kind of idea around pulling back on the syringe before you plunge it all in and whereabouts in the arm you should be aiming to get to increase the level of safety.

02:22:49.684 --> 02:23:01.575
Can you imagine that they think that it's all a physical phenomenon, and if the physical phenomenon is correct, then the toxicity or the danger or the ridiculousness of intramuscular injection goes away.

02:23:02.416 --> 02:23:08.881
That's how stupid this script is, and that's how stupid these people have to be.

02:23:10.303 --> 02:23:11.444
They think you're that dumb.

02:23:13.928 --> 02:23:17.850
could be was because they knew it was a problem for decades.

02:23:17.890 --> 02:23:25.475
In the 1950s, it was well established that 2% of people will have a deltoid injection hit a vessel with negative consequences.

02:23:25.935 --> 02:23:33.420
So if you're going to accept 2% negative consequences, you need to have a very, very large benefit to outweigh that risk.

02:23:34.773 --> 02:23:44.957
You know, don't tell anyone this, Claire, but in 1975, my charge nurse told me how to find out the gluteus maximus, how to stick the needle in and how to draw back.

02:23:45.738 --> 02:23:51.360
And this was ingrained into us like drill, stick the needle in, stabilise it, draw back and only then inject if you're not getting any blood.

02:23:51.901 --> 02:23:53.961
And yet, for some reason, these guidelines were changed.

02:23:53.981 --> 02:23:59.664
It's just inexplicable to me that all of the vaccine injections that are now being given are being given wrong because people aren't aspirating.

02:24:00.359 --> 02:24:09.942
I mean, but realistically, the people who were injecting in those vaccine centers weren't qualified nurses.

02:24:10.062 --> 02:24:16.964
Ultimately, what we're doing is is misconstruing the known and expected damage from intramuscular transfection.

02:24:17.004 --> 02:24:20.265
We are misconstruing it as a combination of mechanical

02:24:21.289 --> 02:24:24.432
and protein-based toxicity, i.e.

02:24:24.892 --> 02:24:34.901
specific toxicity in the spike protein, specific toxicity in the lipid nanoparticle or in the large conglomerates of lipid nanoparticles, or in the high-pressure injection.

02:24:35.381 --> 02:24:49.493
Nothing about the biological ridiculousness of transfecting someone and expressing a protein in random cells throughout the body, even if that's not possible on a great large scale, still the attempt is already stupid,

02:24:49.913 --> 02:24:55.635
And yet these people are decades away, it seems, from questioning that part of it.

02:24:56.115 --> 02:24:57.035
And it's by script.

02:24:59.036 --> 02:25:03.717
For years, I've worked with qualified nurses who have told me that you don't need to aspirate when you're giving vaccines.

02:25:04.177 --> 02:25:10.179
I mean, I did, but, you know, the qualified staff are actually being taught the wrong thing by the National Guidelines.

02:25:10.239 --> 02:25:11.239
It's rather bizarre.

02:25:12.736 --> 02:25:35.829
yeah yeah yeah that is bizarre yeah it is so so basically what we're talking about so far we haven't even started it's a global disaster but it's cool you know we can just kind of chat about it it's no big deal no no tears are necessary no no it's not really a big deal you know just you know not talking about the the mRNA yet all of these complications would occur purely because of giving these foreign lipid nanoparticles

02:25:36.449 --> 02:25:43.897
Here come some nice cartoons of course that will explain everything very thoroughly because cartoons are the way that adults learn.

02:25:44.178 --> 02:25:45.099
Absolutely nothing inside them.

02:25:45.643 --> 02:25:46.203
Well, that's right.

02:25:46.263 --> 02:25:49.784
And so lipid nanoparticles were worked up originally for gene therapy, right?

02:25:49.824 --> 02:25:53.985
So there's this idea that, you know, if you've got a child usually, but you know, some of them are adults.

02:25:54.025 --> 02:25:55.485
Worked up for gene therapy.

02:25:55.525 --> 02:25:56.845
They were worked up for everything.

02:25:56.905 --> 02:26:02.326
We've been using lipid nanoparticles on the bench to transfect things for decades.

02:26:02.387 --> 02:26:03.207
This is a lie.

02:26:03.267 --> 02:26:06.727
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to go to the gym because we've got a special clinic today.

02:26:06.747 --> 02:26:10.488
So I'm going to end it early, but I will be on every day this week.

02:26:10.508 --> 02:26:11.388
You can count on it.

02:26:11.448 --> 02:26:12.409
I'll be either 10, 10 or 11, 11.

02:26:14.669 --> 02:26:16.050
Thanks very much for being here.

02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:18.172
I'm going to cut it really short, really fast.

02:26:18.992 --> 02:26:20.633
Remember, this is just an admission.

02:26:21.714 --> 02:26:25.576
This is just an admission because, look, these people...

02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:30.011
This whole map here, this is all scripted traders.

02:26:31.451 --> 02:26:40.732
And more importantly, the people on the bottom are all auditioning to climb higher and higher in the podcast hierarchy so that they can herd even more cats.

02:26:40.792 --> 02:26:46.653
And so if you're auditioning on this level, you might have a reasonable sub stack until you get to this level.

02:26:46.693 --> 02:26:54.975
And then you might have an LLC or a staff, and then you might get to this level where you'll get a show or maybe you'll get elected or something like that.

02:26:55.555 --> 02:27:00.560
And all of these people are auditioning scripted, scripted traders.

02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:04.003
They're all absolutely part of the shit show.

02:27:04.384 --> 02:27:12.231
And the only way that you, you could possibly doubt it, could possibly doubt it if you close your eyes, because look what they're doing right now.

02:27:12.732 --> 02:27:14.093
How is it even possible?

02:27:14.714 --> 02:27:17.977
How is it even possible that this was last week?

02:27:20.532 --> 02:27:21.853
heard nothing yet.

02:27:22.253 --> 02:27:27.338
Please introduce the one, the only, Dr. Peter McCullough.

02:27:31.221 --> 02:27:38.287
This is called Blue Star 2.0 and it is a bible-centered astronomy course.

02:27:42.470 --> 02:27:43.751
What is going on here?

02:27:45.192 --> 02:27:46.053
What is happening?

02:27:48.035 --> 02:27:48.375
I'm done.

02:27:50.350 --> 02:27:51.811
You can take him if you want, I guess.

02:27:52.512 --> 02:27:52.892
Go ahead.

02:27:56.495 --> 02:28:00.479
Thank you so much, and thanks to each and every one of you for attending.

02:28:01.059 --> 02:28:07.345
This is a spectacular venue, and I've learned... They cannot stop.

02:28:08.065 --> 02:28:11.909
If they stop, they admit that they are illegitimate, right?

02:28:11.969 --> 02:28:14.731
Because if you believe what you say you believe, then...

02:28:15.765 --> 02:28:34.715
Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of humans have been injured by this bioweapon He can't stop He's just going to more and more irrelevant corners of the internet and more and more isolated groups of people Because that's the way this works.

02:28:34.775 --> 02:28:37.496
That's the way fifth-generation warfare works.

02:28:37.637 --> 02:28:39.818
I I know that this wasn't my best stream and

02:28:40.518 --> 02:28:42.059
But I just wanted to get started again.

02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:45.963
Sometimes it's just hard to even get the momentum to hit the button again.

02:28:46.003 --> 02:28:47.104
So thanks for your patience.

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:48.285
Thanks for being here.

02:28:48.325 --> 02:28:49.606
And I will see you again tomorrow.

02:28:49.686 --> 02:28:52.449
And that's not a light thing I'm saying.

02:28:52.489 --> 02:28:53.270
I'll be on for sure.

02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:54.751
Thanks for being here.

02:28:55.011 --> 02:28:56.312
And I'll see you again soon.

02:28:56.332 --> 02:29:00.356
Yeah, let's just do that.

02:29:02.799 --> 02:29:04.721
That's the timeline that you need to know.

02:29:04.821 --> 02:29:07.283
That's the timeline you need to pay attention to.

02:29:07.844 --> 02:29:10.306
And you need to put everybody's history in.

02:29:11.307 --> 02:29:18.293
Because in the context of my intellectual progression, I think I have an unblemished record of integrity.

02:29:19.174 --> 02:29:21.736
And I think a lot of these people have exactly the opposite.

02:29:21.756 --> 02:29:22.437
Thanks for being here.

02:29:22.497 --> 02:29:23.178
See you again tomorrow.

02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:25.641
Yeah.
