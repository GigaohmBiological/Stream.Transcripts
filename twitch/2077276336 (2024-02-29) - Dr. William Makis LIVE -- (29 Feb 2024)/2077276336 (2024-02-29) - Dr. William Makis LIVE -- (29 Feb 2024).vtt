00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
testing. I'm gonna come on screen here and see if anybody will come in on the

00:04.880 --> 00:08.160
chat. That's probably we're five minutes late so there's probably somebody already

00:08.160 --> 00:14.400
waiting. Maybe maybe possibly. Hello, this is a sound check. And then I'm just

00:14.400 --> 00:19.920
gonna quick start a few slides here. Ladies and gentlemen, this is giga-owned

00:19.920 --> 00:23.760
biological, a high-resistance low-noise information stream brought to you by a

00:23.760 --> 00:28.560
biologist. The illusion is sustained only through your active participation. The

00:28.560 --> 00:32.720
real trick is to try and see what you're participating in and understand it

00:32.720 --> 00:36.560
because it's a lot more complicated than just watching the nightly news and

00:36.560 --> 00:42.640
deciding on which channel is the one that got it right. We are really working on a

00:42.640 --> 00:49.600
kind of non-compliance thing in the sense of not being subject to a CDC that tells

00:49.600 --> 00:54.000
the whole nation what to do, not being subject maybe even to an FDA that tells

00:54.480 --> 00:59.440
us what's on labels. We've got to understand that we have abdicated our

00:59.440 --> 01:04.240
responsibility for a very long time for the control of our communities and our

01:04.240 --> 01:09.760
states and our nation. And I think a lot of this abdication has occurred all

01:09.760 --> 01:14.160
around the western world. And even though right now for the last four years we've

01:14.160 --> 01:19.040
been focused on it in COVID, I think there are people inside of the system from

01:19.040 --> 01:22.640
before COVID who are already vaguely aware of it. I know that I was one of them and

01:22.640 --> 01:28.240
I didn't understand it. And I'm lucky enough today to have someone on the

01:28.240 --> 01:32.960
stream who I've just met actually a few minutes ago. His name is Dr. William

01:32.960 --> 01:40.320
Macus. Is that the way we pronounce your name? That's right. Yeah. And I'm not sure

01:40.320 --> 01:44.080
care bear. It might be better if you come in later because then I can have the whole

01:44.080 --> 01:51.200
screen for Dr. Macus. But it's okay. I think when if we set this right I can get

01:51.280 --> 01:56.960
it to be the speaker. I'm just going to let you give an introduction to yourself. Please

01:56.960 --> 02:01.360
make sure that you give a full introduction of yourself before the pandemic so that we

02:01.360 --> 02:06.320
understand what you're up to and where you were in your profession before the pandemic.

02:06.320 --> 02:12.880
Thank you very much. Well, thanks for that. I was born in Czechoslovakia communist Czechoslovakia.

02:12.880 --> 02:20.000
My family fled communism in 1988. My dad was an academic. He was pursued by the communists.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.880
They wanted him in the communist party. They wanted him pushing communist ideals. He didn't

02:24.880 --> 02:31.040
want to be part of it. He felt he had a target on his back. So he fled the country. We ended

02:31.040 --> 02:36.480
up in a refugee camp in Yugoslavia in a United Nations refugee camp. We had no idea how long we

02:36.480 --> 02:41.600
were going to be there. So I learned English there. You know, we had a choice of Canada,

02:41.600 --> 02:47.360
US or Australia where we wanted to go. And we were lucky enough after a year we were given a

02:47.360 --> 02:55.040
ticket to go to Canada. So came to Canada as a refugee, government housing. My dad was sort of

02:55.040 --> 03:03.840
a math engineering professor and worked very hard. I grew up in Toronto. And for my undergrad,

03:03.840 --> 03:10.000
I went to University of Toronto. I did immunology for four years. And then I got into medical school

03:10.000 --> 03:15.440
at McGill University in Montreal. And I did about 10 years of medical training at McGill. I did my

03:15.440 --> 03:22.400
MD degree. And then I did a five year specialization in nuclear medicine. Nuclear medicine encompasses,

03:22.400 --> 03:31.200
it's a branch of radiology, but it encompasses radiology and oncology. And so I got training

03:31.200 --> 03:39.600
in both of those fields. And then I graduated in 2010 and just started as a regular, you know,

03:39.600 --> 03:46.800
regular small doctor in a small town. We moved to Manitoba in a very small town. I had my own

03:46.800 --> 03:52.880
department and I did mostly imaging. Cardiac stress tests, bone scans, bone density scans,

03:52.880 --> 03:59.120
that kind of stuff, just basic imaging stuff. But I was doing a lot of publication as well with,

03:59.920 --> 04:03.520
you know, material that I had from McGill University because we had a PET scan,

04:04.320 --> 04:09.360
which was sort of a new technology at the time to diagnose cancers. I know I dove

04:10.000 --> 04:14.160
deep into that. I was publishing a lot and I wanted to do more in cancer and more in oncology.

04:14.800 --> 04:21.760
So I ended up moving my family to Alberta to work in a large cancer center, took over a large

04:21.760 --> 04:28.800
face to clinical trial of targeted radionuclide therapy using medical isotopes to treat stage four

04:28.880 --> 04:35.840
cancers. These were neuroendocrine cancers at the time. And the idea was that you would

04:35.840 --> 04:44.880
take these beta emitting isotopes, you would link them to a molecule that would then deliver

04:44.880 --> 04:52.560
the radiation to a particular receptor on the tumor cell. And then the radiation would be dropped

04:53.520 --> 04:59.120
picked up by the cell. It would then, the beta radiation would then cause single strand or

04:59.120 --> 05:05.760
double strand breaks. And it would either kill the cell or render the cell unable to replicate.

05:05.760 --> 05:13.200
And while sparing healthy tissue, and so the half-life of these medical isotopes was quite short. It

05:13.200 --> 05:19.600
was only about six hours, half-life. So essentially, if you treated the patient with an injection,

05:20.400 --> 05:27.920
the material would get delivered throughout the body to the tumors. And then the patient would

05:27.920 --> 05:34.640
pee the rest of it out. So the rest of it would be excreted in urine. And you would monitor them,

05:34.640 --> 05:38.720
maybe for an hour or two, just to make sure that they didn't have any kind of unexpected

05:38.720 --> 05:43.360
reaction. Usually there was no reaction at all. And you could send them home, that you could do

05:43.360 --> 05:48.960
these treatments as really as an outpatient. They didn't need to be hospitalized and so on.

05:48.960 --> 05:56.400
So it was a very fascinating technology that had been developed in Europe. And FDA sat on this

05:56.400 --> 06:04.240
for almost 20 years. They refused to approve any of these medical isotope treatments. And so

06:05.200 --> 06:10.160
unfortunately, my program was sabotaged. At the time I didn't realize, I didn't know why it was

06:10.160 --> 06:16.080
sabotaged. I found out later that the Trudeau government would go on to invest hundreds of

06:16.160 --> 06:20.800
millions of dollars into this. They wanted to have a monopoly. They wanted to have it in Vancouver,

06:20.800 --> 06:25.280
British Columbia and call themselves global leaders in this technology. Now this was all

06:25.280 --> 06:30.960
before the pandemic, right? And so I had actually been fighting at legal battles since 2016 with

06:30.960 --> 06:38.240
the health authorities in Canada realized that the entire medical system is corrupt top to bottom.

06:38.880 --> 06:44.080
And that included all the health authorities. That included the medical boards like in the

06:44.160 --> 06:48.320
Canada, it's the College of Physicians and Surgeons. That's the medical board in the United States.

06:48.320 --> 06:54.400
They are, I believe, called medical boards. Completely corrupt universities. Completely corrupt.

06:55.520 --> 07:02.320
And of course, the politicians were corrupt. So I had that sort of revelation a few years before

07:02.320 --> 07:08.160
the pandemic. And because I refused to settle, I refused to sort of take any payoff that they put

07:08.160 --> 07:12.320
in front of me. They came after my license, took my license hostage and said, basically, we won't

07:12.320 --> 07:17.440
allow you to practice medicine until you sign those legal documents and those non-disclosures.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.080
And they said, we'll destroy your reputation. We'll never allow you to practice medicine again.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.520
So I've been fighting really that legal battle. The non-disclosures are about the radionucleotides.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.480
The non-disclosures are about that technology here. No, not about the technology that they,

07:32.480 --> 07:36.400
you know, they weren't really, they didn't care about that. It was non-disclosure, basically,

07:36.400 --> 07:41.120
that the program got sabotaged in the province of Alberta. They left those patients

07:41.120 --> 07:46.080
actively to die because it was stage four patients who had failed all other treatments.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.280
And they took this technology and basically rendered it unavailable in the entire province.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.800
So they have the deaths of thousands of cancer patients on their hands,

07:54.800 --> 07:59.200
but they didn't want anyone to know about it. Simply one day, the technology was no longer

07:59.200 --> 08:04.640
available in the entire province. And so that was what I had to sign that I would never speak

08:04.640 --> 08:08.720
to my colleagues about this again. And I would leave the province and give up all my contracts.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.600
I was producing this stuff, though, like the radionucleotides is something you had to make

08:13.600 --> 08:20.640
on the bench, like at the day of the treatment. Yeah, so we had a radio pharmacy, but we didn't

08:20.640 --> 08:27.600
have the ability to produce the medical isotopes ourselves. You need, you know, you need a decent

08:27.600 --> 08:32.800
size cyclotron. So we were actually ordering the stuff from Europe. They would ship out,

08:32.800 --> 08:37.440
there was two components. There was the medical isotope, and then there was the peptide component.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.840
And we would basically import both of those. Now, as you're importing radiation with a half life

08:43.840 --> 08:49.120
of six hours, obviously, you're going to lose a lot of it just by decay by the time it gets to

08:49.120 --> 08:53.440
you. But then, you know, we had our radio pharmacy sort of put it together. It was sort of like a,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.960
like a little kit where they would put those components together so that we could then

08:58.960 --> 09:04.640
inject it into the patient. Now, the Trudeau government, the Justin Trudeau government is

09:04.720 --> 09:11.600
actually heavily invested in building those cyclotrons on site in Vancouver so that they could

09:11.600 --> 09:17.440
produce the medical isotopes on site so that, you know, you then you'd have a huge radio pharmacy

09:17.440 --> 09:23.120
on site to put it together with whatever peptide or molecule you need. That is the targeting molecule.

09:23.120 --> 09:28.960
And you could inject patients without losing a lot of the radiation in transit. So they're

09:28.960 --> 09:34.080
building the facilities in Vancouver to be able to do that. And really, they've monopolized this

09:34.080 --> 09:39.360
technology because I was the referral center for all of Canada. So they wanted the monopoly.

09:39.360 --> 09:46.320
And the idea was that they would set up private clinics that would function parallel to the public

09:46.320 --> 09:52.800
system where they could then bring in wealthy clients from Asia, you know, China, India, Japan,

09:52.800 --> 09:59.680
fly them into Vancouver, which is a very easy flight into Canada and then have them treated

09:59.680 --> 10:06.720
at these state-of-the-art cancer centers. And so I really came into the pandemic as a retired

10:07.280 --> 10:13.920
physician because I gave up my license. You know, in this situation, I simply gave up my license.

10:14.880 --> 10:25.040
And so now 2020 hits, I am 40, 41 years old or 40 years old when the pandemic hits. I'm 40 years

10:25.040 --> 10:34.000
old and retired, right? And so I can look at the pandemic really without any propaganda,

10:34.000 --> 10:39.760
you know, in the workplace, without any pressures, peer pressures, really without really any input

10:39.760 --> 10:46.080
for my colleagues, you know, I could look at it as objectively as I could. And to me, I just

10:46.960 --> 10:51.600
I couldn't understand the fear. Like, I couldn't understand the fear mongering at the beginning.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.240
And I looked at some numbers. I think it was, I think I saw the numbers by Ewanidis

10:57.280 --> 11:04.080
in terms of the case fatality rate. And it was like 99.9% survival rate or higher for, you know,

11:04.080 --> 11:11.360
anyone who was all the age categories, except maybe age 70 plus. So I couldn't understand

11:12.080 --> 11:17.200
the fear and the panic and the whole lockdowns and, you know, two weeks to flatten the curve and

11:17.920 --> 11:24.240
and the six feet apart and all that just absolute nonsense, you know, and like one of the most

11:24.240 --> 11:30.880
hilarious things to me was the arrows in the aisles in stores. So so we have these we have these

11:30.880 --> 11:35.760
stores in Canada called, you know, the dollar dollarama, right? Dollarama one dollar stores.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.560
And what they do is they would have arrows going one way. And then the next aisle, the arrows

11:40.560 --> 11:45.120
were going the opposite way. And I thought like, this is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen.

11:45.920 --> 11:50.400
And so, you know, I would go, you know, the opposite way just for fun. And you should see the looks

11:50.400 --> 11:54.640
on people's faces. I mean, they were, it was like I was, I was going to kill them when I was

11:54.640 --> 12:00.320
approaching them, like they were absolutely petrified. And the whole thing was like,

12:00.320 --> 12:06.720
homical, right? Another situation where I, you know, the insanity of this was, you know,

12:06.720 --> 12:12.800
when people now Costco is very popular in Canada. And so we would go to Costco. And then I would

12:12.800 --> 12:20.400
see these lineups just around the blocks and, you know, snaking around, you know, these gigantic

12:20.400 --> 12:24.320
lineups outside the Costco, because I guess there was a limited number of people you could allow

12:24.320 --> 12:28.240
in at a certain time and they were counting how many people were in and how many people were coming

12:28.240 --> 12:33.360
out. And then, you know, some people were standing six feet apart. Some some people weren't. I mean,

12:33.360 --> 12:38.720
the whole thing was just idiotic. I remember, I remember that very well. We didn't do,

12:39.680 --> 12:44.080
I guess you guys had it much stricter up there than we had it down here. But the same principles

12:44.080 --> 12:53.200
were rolled out. That's for sure. Did you, did you then have any personal experience yourself with

12:54.240 --> 13:00.640
the virus at any time, like that convinced you that that the spread was real or family members

13:00.640 --> 13:07.920
or anything like that? I mean, I heard you say that the case fatality rate was very low, but I'm

13:07.920 --> 13:12.480
sure by now, four years into this, you're aware that lots of people have argued that there wasn't

13:13.040 --> 13:17.040
there are lots of places where there does isn't really evidence of spread. How do we,

13:17.040 --> 13:21.520
was there a lot of excess mortality in Alberta? I think when I looked it up, there actually was.

13:23.760 --> 13:29.360
You know, that is that that's a good question. I was trying to figure out if I had been exposed

13:29.360 --> 13:36.000
to this thing. And if and it was really, I couldn't, if basically there hadn't been a declared pandemic,

13:36.000 --> 13:42.560
I couldn't have told you that I was exposed to anything particularly novel or something that

13:42.560 --> 13:48.800
I had never experienced before. So I didn't have that experience in 2020. I can tell you since then,

13:48.800 --> 13:59.200
I could say that I do feel I had a couple of colds that were particularly strong. I would say

13:59.200 --> 14:03.760
maybe stronger than I've been used to. So I could say I've been exposed to something in the last

14:04.400 --> 14:11.760
three years that is maybe stronger than what I've experienced in the past. But I mean, certainly

14:11.760 --> 14:18.880
in 2020, I did not experience anything out of the ordinary. And so, you know, and again, I was,

14:18.880 --> 14:23.680
you know, I did look into, okay, well, what should I be taking? Okay, I was taking vitamin D, I was

14:23.680 --> 14:31.120
taking, you know, zinc, vitamin C, quercetin, every now, you know, I throw some NAC or lysine in there,

14:31.120 --> 14:37.280
what have you. And so I did take some steps to kind of try to protect myself. But I really

14:37.280 --> 14:45.520
didn't feel like I experienced anything novel in 2020, definitely not in 2020. And so I can tell

14:45.520 --> 14:54.400
you, I more or less ignored 2020. I mean, I, you know, I sort of, you know, I guess went along

14:55.360 --> 15:01.360
with some of the nonsense in terms of the, you know, the six feet apart or what have you, you know,

15:01.360 --> 15:06.000
just to not, I mean, I would always wear the mask under my nose because I don't like having

15:06.000 --> 15:11.120
anything over my nose blocking blocking my breathing. So, and it was, you're right, I mean, it was a

15:11.120 --> 15:16.640
little bit vicious in Canada, you know, they would go after people who weren't wearing masks properly,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.240
they would have them, you know, they would call security, they would have you dragged out of a

15:20.240 --> 15:29.280
store or what have you. So, did you, did you take any of the, the products at some point? Like,

15:29.280 --> 15:35.040
did you take an injection at all? I have not taken any injection and I have not taken a test. Okay.

15:35.760 --> 15:44.560
And nobody in my family has my immediate family. Now, I think my wife took a PCR test once,

15:45.440 --> 15:50.800
because I think she panicked. But I was like, no injections, no testing, like that was,

15:51.600 --> 15:56.720
I've gone through the entire pandemic with with that. Now, the reason why you came back then,

15:56.720 --> 16:01.360
I mean, it not came back, but like it's, it feels very much like you're sort of kind of coming

16:01.360 --> 16:06.320
out of retirement in the sense of, you know, using your medical background to speak out about what's

16:06.320 --> 16:11.680
going on. So how, how is that transition back? Ben, it looks like you were doing geology or

16:11.680 --> 16:19.040
something in your spare time. You know, I love, I love gemstones. I love the fossils. So that's

16:19.040 --> 16:26.560
something I, you know, I collect and enjoy. Honestly, yeah, that that's a good question,

16:26.560 --> 16:31.760
because, you know, 2020, I was, I was basically ignoring the pandemic thinking, whatever it is,

16:31.760 --> 16:37.440
it's going to blow over. You know, it's obviously not sustainable. If no one's dying or people are

16:37.440 --> 16:42.480
not dying in large numbers, whatever's happening is obviously not sustainable over the long term.

16:43.120 --> 16:47.520
That was my reasoning. You know, then we hit 2021 and the whole vaccine issue and the whole

16:47.520 --> 16:54.000
vaccine rolls out. There were some red flags for me with that. And I will, you know, I will always

16:54.000 --> 16:59.920
admit, I did not know how toxic these things were going to be, or how toxic they, you know,

16:59.920 --> 17:07.600
they definitely appear to be now. But I had some questions about, as soon as I heard,

17:07.600 --> 17:13.600
it was, it was going to be mRNA and lipid nanoparticle technology, I had some serious questions. I was

17:13.600 --> 17:18.960
like, okay, why, like, why are they using these things? Can we go back? Just very, very, very,

17:18.960 --> 17:25.600
very, yeah, in your radio nucleotides, what is it when they mix them together? What, what,

17:25.680 --> 17:30.640
how do they get them to go in then? How are the peptide and isotope get mixed together? And then

17:30.640 --> 17:35.920
are they also need a carrier molecule of some kind or the peptide can be dissolved with the

17:35.920 --> 17:41.520
radio molecule somehow and injected in there's a there's some kind of chelation that happens.

17:41.520 --> 17:47.680
Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So there's there's an additional there's an additional molecule that

17:47.680 --> 17:55.280
chelates. Okay. The, the, the radionuclide with the with the peptide. Okay. Yeah.

17:56.480 --> 18:00.800
It wouldn't be like you were using lipid nanoparticles to do that. And that's why no, no, no, no, no,

18:00.800 --> 18:07.200
no, but but you know what, but that's, but that's the funny part is that because I was aware that

18:08.080 --> 18:12.960
there had been a lot of attempts made in oncology to use lipid nanoparticles as as carriers

18:13.920 --> 18:20.400
for chemotherapy, right? And I know they had lots of problems with it. I know they had they had,

18:21.920 --> 18:27.280
I know that these were inflammatory, you know, highly inflammatory. I know that they could not

18:27.280 --> 18:32.080
control the delivery of the lipid nanoparticles. And that was one of the, that was actually one

18:32.080 --> 18:36.320
of the major problems because if you're, if you're, if you're loading them with chemotherapy and

18:36.320 --> 18:39.760
you're hoping that these things, you know, get delivered to the tumors. Well, what's really

18:39.840 --> 18:43.920
happening is they're dumping chemotherapy all over the place. And you have this sort of

18:43.920 --> 18:50.000
uncontrolled release of chemotherapy in places where you really may not want chemotherapy,

18:50.000 --> 18:57.600
right? And so I was sort of, you know, vaguely aware of this that the lipid nanoparticles had

18:57.600 --> 19:02.320
never worked that like there was these things were problematic, like they never figured out

19:03.440 --> 19:06.640
in terms of targeting. And I know that, you know, they were then sort of thinking about,

19:06.640 --> 19:13.120
you know, monoclonal antibodies and ways of maybe attaching monoclonal antibodies to, to,

19:13.120 --> 19:17.840
to find ways of delivering them. But, but it was basically as far as I was concerned,

19:17.840 --> 19:23.120
it was one of these failed technologies that had never worked. And mRNA, that's a whole

19:23.120 --> 19:30.480
kind of worms that I really wanted nothing to do with. Because again, it's something that had

19:30.560 --> 19:38.000
never worked in any sort of, you know, condition that that as far as I was aware. So now you're

19:38.000 --> 19:44.240
combining these two, you're combining what in my mind were two failed technologies together,

19:44.240 --> 19:50.240
right? And I just remember my gut feeling was I want to have nothing to do with something that

19:50.240 --> 19:57.920
is this experimental with so many unknowns. And that's without knowing anything about myocarditis

19:57.920 --> 20:02.480
and all that kind of stuff. So many unknowns with people on TV telling us that there were

20:02.480 --> 20:10.080
almost no unknowns. It was a it was a win-win. This is a this is a no-brainer. Yeah. And I can

20:10.080 --> 20:16.320
tell you having run a clinical trial for several years, and really a proper clinical trial

20:17.920 --> 20:24.640
with stage four cancer patients where I had to do, you know, full informed consent. I had to go

20:24.640 --> 20:31.440
over all the possible risks, not just the benefits, the idea that you would give something

20:31.440 --> 20:38.960
completely experimental to a healthy person with so many unknowns. It just again, it seemed

20:38.960 --> 20:45.600
completely insane to me. But you know, I looked around and I'm like, Holy crap, everyone is lining

20:45.600 --> 20:51.120
up for this. People are lining up outside of Walmart. They're lining up in in parking lots.

20:51.200 --> 20:58.640
They're lining up, you know, at Superstore. I mean, they're basically lining up for these injections.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.400
No one's talking to their doctor or at least most people didn't even talk to their doctor

21:02.400 --> 21:09.680
about it. They're just getting to get these shots. And that like that. And I remember that vividly

21:09.680 --> 21:15.200
because this is like spring of 2021. And the politicians are like, come on, just just get one

21:15.200 --> 21:20.560
shot, right? Let's just get 70% of people getting one shot. We get the herd immunity. We're going

21:20.560 --> 21:26.640
to be out of this thing so fast. And now these were sleaze balls, like the politicians, a lot

21:26.640 --> 21:31.680
of these were very sleazy politicians that were pushing this stuff. And in terms of the medical

21:31.680 --> 21:38.160
system that I had experience with the corruption in the medical system, the same corrupt bureaucrats

21:38.160 --> 21:44.320
that killed my cancer program and basically destroyed my career, we're now pushing the vaccines.

21:44.320 --> 21:48.480
I mean, there was no there was no change in the bureaucracy in the healthcare bureaucracy.

21:48.560 --> 21:54.880
And I think that's something that doesn't get talked about very much that, you know, these people

21:54.880 --> 21:59.680
that were pushing this stuff, these were lifetime bureaucrats, you know, that had been occupying

21:59.680 --> 22:04.240
their positions for a very, very long time. I mean, look at Fauci, right? I mean, talk about a

22:04.240 --> 22:11.200
lifetime bureaucrat and and Burke's and Redfield, all of them, the heads of that initial start of

22:11.200 --> 22:18.080
this in America were no doubt long time servants, definitely. Yeah. And so same thing in Canada,

22:18.080 --> 22:23.440
you know, corrupt bureaucrats, who I know were completely corrupt, just pushing this stuff on

22:23.440 --> 22:29.520
everybody. That was when I started to not panic, but I really started to get concerned. I'm like,

22:29.520 --> 22:34.800
okay, they're pushing this into they want to put this into everybody, but they still hadn't talked

22:34.800 --> 22:42.480
about the kids yet. Right. It was only in the summer of 2021, where they were like, now this

22:42.480 --> 22:47.360
is going into kids. Yep. This is going into kids. And of course, you know, first, it was like 12

22:47.360 --> 22:51.840
to 19. And I thought, okay, no way, parents are going to put up with this crap. And they did.

22:52.800 --> 23:00.240
And they got I can tell you it in Canada, they got 80% of kids 12 to 19 injected with this stuff.

23:00.240 --> 23:07.680
Wow. At least at least two doses. Wow. 80%. This is 12 to 19 years old. I mean,

23:07.680 --> 23:12.160
forget all the, you know, immune issues, autoimmune issues or whatever. Myocarditis, you know,

23:12.160 --> 23:17.520
everyone knows blood clots. What about the fertility? Yeah. What about the fertility? Like,

23:18.720 --> 23:23.920
how do you sometimes generation of kids? Sometimes I think the only hope is that these people were

23:23.920 --> 23:30.560
diabolical enough to put out some placebo batches so that the total devastation they caused is

23:30.560 --> 23:39.200
harder to trace to the shot. Right. It's awful, man. I don't know what to say. And, and, and I really,

23:39.280 --> 23:45.120
you know, it's hard for us to really gauge what happened in, in Canada versus what we were

23:45.120 --> 23:50.160
allowed to see happening in Canada. And the same, I think can be said for every English-speaking

23:50.160 --> 23:57.760
nation that certain news made it here and certain news didn't. And for America, it often felt like

23:57.760 --> 24:04.320
the worst examples of, of authoritarianism in Canada, for example, made a lot of circulation

24:04.320 --> 24:09.200
over here where, you know, Trudeau is just saying, if you want to travel on a train or whatever.

24:09.200 --> 24:14.320
Yeah. Yeah. The same with the guy from Australia who was saying you're of anti, if you have support

24:14.320 --> 24:21.040
for people who have ideas about anti-backs, you're anti-backs. So those, those things were sent to us

24:21.040 --> 24:26.320
as showing us how bad it could be. Right. And they did it to you guys, I think, because your

24:26.880 --> 24:30.320
legislative system kind of permits it, whereas maybe there's some

24:30.960 --> 24:37.680
last bastion of checks and balances or laws against things that they couldn't quite do it here,

24:37.680 --> 24:42.240
like they did it where they, where they could, and they really hit you guys some places really hard.

24:43.280 --> 24:50.880
They did. Yeah. And I can tell you, I think it's also important to remember not just what they did

24:50.880 --> 24:55.840
to try to force as many people, you know, to take these shots as possible, but when they did it.

24:56.560 --> 25:02.720
And so, you know, when you sort of look back, you know, the spring of 2021, there was none of this

25:02.720 --> 25:07.360
animosity and this like, well, we're going to punish you and we're going to, you know, we're

25:07.360 --> 25:10.800
going to fire you and we're going to make sure you cannot get government support if you don't take

25:10.800 --> 25:16.000
these shots. I mean, it was just like, Hey, let's get to her and immunity. You know, let's just get,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.560
you know, 70%. I remember that kept moving the goalposts. First, it was just 70%. It was enough

25:20.560 --> 25:28.160
than 75, 80%, 85%. I remember that too. Yep. Moving those goalposts. When I really panicked

25:28.960 --> 25:34.240
about where they were going with this was in the summer of 2021, you know, they, they did the whole

25:34.240 --> 25:40.640
booster thing in Israel. And that seemed to just crash and burn very quickly. And the moment they

25:40.640 --> 25:45.440
started talking about the kids, I thought, okay, I can't, like, this is not, this is not going to

25:45.440 --> 25:50.400
go like this is not going to pass. You know, whatever I may have thought in 2020 that this whole thing

25:50.400 --> 25:55.840
it was just going to pass. Now we're, we're in something permanent here. They're talking about

25:55.840 --> 26:01.200
booster shots. And they know that they had to basically say that the first two shots had failed

26:01.200 --> 26:05.920
in order to get people to accept taking a third shot, because they went all in on the first two

26:05.920 --> 26:13.200
shots. Right. And so in a way, they had to admit that, well, actually, you know, the first two

26:13.200 --> 26:17.840
shots really didn't work. So now you need the booster, right? And that was a, you know, that was a

26:17.840 --> 26:25.600
psychological operation in it in itself. But I can tell you, and I don't know if the Americans

26:25.600 --> 26:31.760
experienced this to the same degree, but in Canada, they came extremely aggressively after kids,

26:32.720 --> 26:37.840
getting kids vaccinated, making sure that these shots, and I can tell you, yeah, 80% was the uptake

26:37.840 --> 26:43.760
for kids 12 to 19. That's when I started speaking out really online. And then they came for the

26:43.840 --> 26:48.640
kids five to 11 years old. And they managed, and I thought like that is like, this thing is

26:48.640 --> 26:55.920
that on arrival, no way will parents of younger kids allow this, especially none of those kids

26:55.920 --> 27:00.320
were dying. Well, I mean, pretty much none of the kids 12 to 12 to 19 were dying either.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.560
But I could see, you know, I could see how they could fool, especially the, you know, with the

27:06.560 --> 27:12.000
older kids 17, 18, 19, of course, then the university mandates came where they really forced it into

27:12.000 --> 27:18.240
all those young kids. But I thought, well, maybe parents will draw the line at five to 11 years old.

27:19.120 --> 27:26.080
And again, they managed to, they managed to force it through. And so about 50% of those kids have

27:26.080 --> 27:30.800
had at least two shots in Canada. Right. I know it's not as bad in the United States.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.560
No, it's not. But they got the, they got the university kids here really well. That's it.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.960
That's well, they got the university kids everywhere. And Canada, United States.

27:42.080 --> 27:48.560
It was a real crucial, crucial mistake that we made in 2020, where more parents should have

27:48.560 --> 27:53.040
either insisted, okay, you're gonna do that, we're not gonna pay for that, then we're gonna stay

27:53.040 --> 27:59.120
home a year. And then we had power back then. But once we said, well, I don't know, I guess so

27:59.120 --> 28:03.840
you got to do what you got to do, then the kids now realize that mom and dad don't know what

28:03.840 --> 28:08.320
they're talking about anymore. And they're turned to the same authority that I guess I have to turn

28:08.320 --> 28:14.240
to. And we, we really blew it there. I think we have to turn back to those kids and explain how

28:14.240 --> 28:21.760
bad we blew it. Absolutely. So, you know, I had, I had, you know, some of my daughter's

28:21.760 --> 28:28.240
classmates were saying, well, you know, I didn't necessarily, you know, want the vaccine, but I had

28:28.320 --> 28:35.120
no choice my my parents took me and I had no choice. This is like 12 years old, right? And you

28:35.120 --> 28:39.760
could see even like at this age, some of these kids realize like, you know, they have no, they

28:39.760 --> 28:47.280
have no power in this situation. It's just a horrible thing that happened. So I really think the bulk

28:47.280 --> 28:54.160
of the crime of this thing, if we're looking at it, you know, on a time scale, is the second half

28:54.160 --> 29:00.800
of 2021. Because this is where they, this is where it was no longer the carrot. It was no longer

29:00.800 --> 29:06.640
the million dollar lottery or get a donut or get a joint or get a lap dance or whatever the

29:06.640 --> 29:12.800
incentives were to get vaccinated because right, they started with the incentives. Then they came

29:12.800 --> 29:20.000
with the stick, which was, okay, we're going to fire you. And, and, you know, basically corporations

29:20.000 --> 29:28.720
whole scale took on the vaccine mandates and forced this. So, so, you know, why? And, and, you

29:28.720 --> 29:34.080
know, it's like it was so aggressive that second half of 2021, that's when all the vaccine mandates

29:34.080 --> 29:40.000
came. It was the university mandates, right? For the first two shots. It was the healthcare workers.

29:41.200 --> 29:48.960
Like here in Canada, it was October 15 2021. And when I dug into that deadline to submit proof

29:48.960 --> 29:53.840
all that you had two shots, that deadline, you could see that deadline all across the world.

29:54.560 --> 30:00.400
So this was literally a global push. It was in the United States, these deadlines, you know,

30:00.400 --> 30:06.080
it was in Italy, France, it was in Africa, like you name it, public servants who were dependent

30:07.200 --> 30:13.440
on the government for their job and, and, and salary. They hit them with the, with the vaccine

30:13.440 --> 30:19.040
mandates during that time period. This was the, the second half of 2021. And this is really where

30:19.040 --> 30:27.760
I, I see the maliciousness of this whole thing and, and the malicious intent. And, and, and I always

30:27.760 --> 30:34.880
ask why did, because they already had like 70% of people taking two shots, right? Why did they need

30:34.880 --> 30:42.080
the last 15, 20% to the point where they were willing to burn down institutions to the ground,

30:42.160 --> 30:49.360
throw all medical ethics down the toilet, um, and really throw experienced, valuable people

30:49.360 --> 30:56.480
out on the street. They were willing to go, they were willing to do anything to get that last 15,

30:56.480 --> 31:01.920
20% injected by any means possible. And, and like this is when Trudeau comes out and says,

31:01.920 --> 31:06.800
don't think you can get on a plane or a train and sit next to a vaccinated person, right? And

31:06.800 --> 31:11.840
calling, calling the, the unvaccinated racists and misogynists and, and, and, and people that

31:11.840 --> 31:16.880
do we even tolerate these people? Should these people have access to healthcare? Should we be

31:16.880 --> 31:22.080
taxing them? Should, should they pay higher insurance rates, right? Should they actually

31:22.080 --> 31:27.840
have any access to, to healthcare? This is when the brutality of this thing took place.

31:28.560 --> 31:35.920
Why the hell did they want the last 15 to 20% of populations in the US, Canada, UK, Australia,

31:35.920 --> 31:43.120
injected? That is my big question. Like why, right? Because you've got 70% of the population

31:43.120 --> 31:50.960
by that point, just by, you know, the usual propaganda, right? The usual sort of, um, manipulation

31:50.960 --> 31:55.280
techniques in the media peer, a little bit of peer pressure. Hey, you're going to kill grandma,

31:55.280 --> 31:58.720
or hey, everyone's doing it. Don't you want to do it for your community and, and don't you want

31:58.720 --> 32:03.680
to protect the healthcare system from collapsing, right? Those were the techniques that were used,

32:03.760 --> 32:10.640
but why did they go so aggressively after that last 10, 15%? I think, I think there's an answer

32:10.640 --> 32:17.520
there that it doesn't get talked about. But I think it's something that maybe will reveal itself

32:18.880 --> 32:25.600
over the coming years. Why did they need that extra population so that they could then say,

32:25.600 --> 32:31.200
well, we've got 85% or 90% of the people injected with at least one dose of this stuff. And who

32:31.200 --> 32:36.000
cares about the last 10%? They're crazy. They're a fringe minority and will lock them out of society

32:36.000 --> 32:45.760
and everyone else did the right thing. I think actually what they want is the elimination of

32:45.760 --> 32:51.600
the control group. I mean, yeah, they I'm sure that's part of it. Yeah. You don't want to have

32:52.320 --> 32:56.640
people at work that, you know, for three years, don't get sick while everybody else at work gets

32:56.640 --> 33:02.480
sick, right? That would be a real pain in the ass. Especially if that person isn't a triathlete

33:02.480 --> 33:08.960
or a vegan or whatever people imagine makes them special, right? If they're just an average dude

33:08.960 --> 33:13.120
who plays video games at night, but never gets sick because he didn't take the shot. That's a

33:13.120 --> 33:17.920
pretty that's a pain in the butt to have around on a college campus that could be devastating,

33:17.920 --> 33:25.920
right? I mean, so that that's one of the main issues there was college kids and how everybody feels

33:26.880 --> 33:31.600
if there are a bunch of people on college campus that don't have the health issues that everybody

33:31.600 --> 33:37.280
else seems to think is normal, that would be a very big big deal breaker. So they had to get

33:37.280 --> 33:41.600
rid of that. I think that's one of the reasons they had to do it. Yeah. And I think honestly,

33:42.320 --> 33:49.120
I think they failed. I feel like there is just big enough of a control group

33:49.920 --> 33:59.280
where you can't just sort of bury the last group of unvaccinated and say, well, these are lunatics

33:59.280 --> 34:05.600
and we'll just, we won't even look and see what's going on there. So I think they fell short of the

34:05.600 --> 34:12.960
mark. I think they really fell short of the mark there. And it may be they're undoing down the road.

34:13.600 --> 34:21.760
But I think they didn't quite get where they were going. And they really went all in like this was

34:21.760 --> 34:27.360
like all in they were willing to burn every institution to the ground. Every concept of ethics,

34:27.360 --> 34:32.720
you know, medical ethics or ethics. Otherwise, they burnt it all to the ground to like you said,

34:32.720 --> 34:39.840
I guess eliminate that that that control group. And I do think they failed. Now it is tragic that

34:39.920 --> 34:45.840
they got as many people as they did. I think that's a tragedy. But but I do think that they they

34:45.840 --> 34:54.880
failed. So let's flip the script a little bit. And so did you have a lot of like former colleagues

34:54.880 --> 35:00.560
then that that you were in contact with at the start of the pandemic that also were kind of like

35:00.560 --> 35:05.520
what the hell's happening that we're panicking or or you were already kind of disconnected from

35:05.520 --> 35:11.920
that community. And I think because of of the legal situation I was in, actually a lot of my

35:11.920 --> 35:18.160
colleagues have been threatened. They were threatened to kind of cut ties with me. And so I was more

35:18.160 --> 35:25.280
or less disconnected from from the medical community, which in a way was probably protected. Sure.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.040
Absolutely. Right. Because because one thing I realized, you know, when I read,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.960
you know, when I read a lot of these sort of interactions between positions and so on,

35:35.680 --> 35:43.120
I realized how much peer pressure there was at all of these institutions. Unless you were like

35:43.120 --> 35:48.000
completely private and you had like a completely private clinic with like-minded individuals and

35:48.000 --> 35:52.800
you could basically say, well, the hell with you, I'm not implementing any vaccine mandate or what

35:52.880 --> 35:58.080
have you, you if you didn't, if you didn't have that and most doctors don't, then you and so if

35:58.080 --> 36:02.640
you were a part of the system in any way, you really were subjected to an incredible amount of

36:03.200 --> 36:10.960
peer pressure. And I think, you know, you can resist peer pressure to some degree, but then

36:10.960 --> 36:17.440
if it's just over a long period of time and everyone's doing it and you know, all your nurses are

36:17.440 --> 36:22.320
doing it and all the texts are doing it. And of course, they quickly eliminate the people who are

36:22.320 --> 36:27.040
not complying, you know, they quietly, well, they put them on unpaid leave, basically what

36:27.040 --> 36:30.960
happened in Canada, they just put everyone on unpaid leave and said, well, if you're not,

36:30.960 --> 36:35.600
if you don't submit your vaccine status, like we'll fire you. And a lot of people resisted

36:35.600 --> 36:40.800
initially and they kept sort of postponing the deadline and eventually they just got rid of

36:40.800 --> 36:46.720
whoever was non-compliant. But if you're in that environment and the non-compliant people basically

36:46.720 --> 36:53.520
disappear and everyone else has done this thing where they've taken two shots or three shots or

36:53.520 --> 36:59.920
what have you, I think the peer pressure is a huge part of that. And I think it wants to stay in the

36:59.920 --> 37:08.560
system. Anyone who stayed in the system psychologically to resist that over a long term, I think is

37:08.560 --> 37:16.480
very difficult. So you literally had to be kicked out of the system to, I think, to be fully protected.

37:17.680 --> 37:23.680
And be able to, you know, or to extricate yourself, you would almost need to be thrown out. I mean,

37:23.680 --> 37:30.800
yeah, it's a, it's a, oh my gosh, it's such a, and you know, and you know, and you know what,

37:30.800 --> 37:37.200
JJ, another thing I find right now is that there's another element to this. Because, you know, a lot

37:37.200 --> 37:42.640
of us are complaining about, well, how come doctors are not waking up? How come they continue to

37:42.720 --> 37:47.200
be part of the system? And maybe some of them have stopped taking booster shots, but like,

37:47.200 --> 37:51.280
you know, if you're now in your like fourth or fifth or sixth shot, I mean, what the hell does

37:51.280 --> 37:57.040
it matter? You know, you've taken four or five, six injections of this stuff, right? But look at how,

37:57.840 --> 38:05.040
how almost impossible it is for anyone who's sort of complied and stayed in that system to then

38:05.040 --> 38:11.520
try to come out of it. There's been almost nobody. Yeah. Right. It's almost like,

38:12.080 --> 38:18.560
it's almost like people just are mentally broken. And maybe just resigned to, maybe they don't have

38:18.560 --> 38:24.000
the strength, maybe they don't have the mental strength to realize they made a huge mistake and

38:24.000 --> 38:30.320
try to, you know, course correct. It's like no one can course correct at this point.

38:31.280 --> 38:35.200
That's what's so shocking to me. It's like you either managed to get, you know, on the right

38:35.200 --> 38:40.160
course fairly early on. And even even a lot of the doctors in our movement, let's say,

38:40.720 --> 38:46.480
broadly speaking movement, even a lot of them took took a couple of shots before maybe they

38:46.480 --> 38:53.360
realized the situation, right? But then if you didn't realize it back then, there's almost nobody

38:53.360 --> 38:58.160
was correcting at this point. Yeah. At least in the medical field.

38:58.160 --> 39:03.360
No, it's very extraordinary. I mean, I came, the University of Pittsburgh is a faculty of

39:03.360 --> 39:12.800
neurobiology. The faculty is I think 135 faculty members. And from, I've heard from none of them,

39:12.800 --> 39:17.920
not one, not even now. And maybe you could reach out and say, wow, I guess you weren't so crazy.

39:17.920 --> 39:22.560
Oh, they think it's a lab leak. And they can at least tell me that they've been watching the news

39:22.640 --> 39:29.680
and heard that what I was suggesting might have happened in February of 2020 is still might be

39:29.680 --> 39:35.120
possible. And then I wasn't crazy. Even though I don't think it's an adequate explanation now,

39:35.120 --> 39:43.360
I still am fascinated by the fact that how how how I appear to have been right so long ago that

39:43.360 --> 39:48.880
none of these people have have even called to say, wow, I hope you're okay. Or, you know, I remember

39:48.880 --> 39:52.960
your wife from the barbecue, she was really sweet. And your kids weren't crazy either. So I

39:52.960 --> 39:58.800
hope you guys are all right. Not a peep, not one phone call, that one email. It's extraordinary.

39:58.800 --> 40:04.560
Same same thing here. It's it's no one from my circle, sort of even an extended circle.

40:06.640 --> 40:13.920
And in my, you know, medical career, my previous jobs, you know, university, so on, no one has

40:13.920 --> 40:19.600
reached out. No one has said a word. I get so I get outreach when it comes to physicians,

40:19.600 --> 40:26.080
I'll get outreach from physicians in other countries, I'll get outreach from spouses of

40:26.080 --> 40:32.000
physicians who are freaking out and who know that something's wrong. And they're like, oh, my god,

40:32.000 --> 40:37.280
like, what do we do this and that is my, you know, husband gonna have a heart attack or a stroke or

40:37.280 --> 40:42.960
blood clot or whatever. So I'll get outreach from from immediate family members. But that's as far

40:43.040 --> 40:49.840
as it goes. I don't get outreach from from the physicians themselves. And so I'm like, really,

40:49.840 --> 40:56.160
like, is everyone really going down with this ship? That's that's, and it's, you know, I mean,

40:56.160 --> 41:00.800
is it too late? I don't think it's too late ever to course correct, but it takes a lot of

41:01.760 --> 41:06.080
strength, I guess, at this point, to do it. And it seems people don't have it.

41:07.120 --> 41:11.920
Yeah, I think it's also part of the, you know, how much you actually give up when you do it.

41:12.400 --> 41:17.040
When you not give up, but what you let go of, they have a pretty, you know,

41:18.480 --> 41:24.720
developed idea of how the world works. And this is very contrary to that. And so,

41:25.520 --> 41:30.480
you know, they put all of their eggs in the idea that, well, they wouldn't be telling us to do it

41:30.480 --> 41:35.680
if they didn't figure it out already, you know, if it wasn't okay. And I, I don't buy that. But,

41:35.680 --> 41:40.080
but I know that a lot of people were duped by people who gave that excuse. I mean,

41:40.160 --> 41:46.720
Robert Malone says that he took two shots because he thought they must have fixed it. And I don't,

41:46.720 --> 41:53.120
I don't know. I just, for me, it's hard for me to imagine how anybody could think that

41:53.120 --> 41:58.640
transfection was something that would work on children. I guess, I even have a video of myself

41:58.640 --> 42:08.640
in my garden saying in 2020 that her 2021, that I actually thought that maybe it helped my parents,

42:08.640 --> 42:17.040
but I don't need to take it. And I was trying to not necessarily be totally skeptical,

42:17.040 --> 42:21.600
saying that there's a chance that it might have done something. Maybe it's not a totally evil

42:21.600 --> 42:28.640
thing, but to argue that healthy younger adults should take it as just absurd. And we have to be

42:28.640 --> 42:33.440
realistic about the immunology that I understood at the time, which I understand better now.

42:34.160 --> 42:40.400
What is your, you said you did four years of immunology. So what is your take on

42:40.400 --> 42:46.160
expressing a spike protein using a lipid nanoparticle in somebody's body? And then what happens to,

42:46.160 --> 42:51.920
how does the immune system supposedly process that cartoon? And then what do you think is a much

42:51.920 --> 42:56.960
more realistic cartoon of what happens when somebody's transfected? Well, I mean, I'll be honest with

42:56.960 --> 43:08.320
you, I find myself, I really feel like I'm sort of like learning to swim here. And you know,

43:08.320 --> 43:12.800
someone who's just been thrown into water and like, try to figure out how to swim here. Because,

43:12.800 --> 43:17.920
I mean, I'm two, I'm more than two decades removed from my, you know, from my undergrad

43:18.880 --> 43:25.920
immunology, undergrad. So I'm trying to learn, I'm trying to learn as much as I can about this.

43:25.920 --> 43:34.160
And, you know, it's interesting, because even this idea of the DNA contamination in these,

43:35.120 --> 43:41.920
in the vials was not a thing. You know, last year, it was not even a no one knew about it,

43:41.920 --> 43:46.160
no one talked about it. You know, the fact that, you know, there was this, whatever,

43:46.160 --> 43:51.040
there were these limits, apparently, that these regulatory agencies had put on the quantities of

43:51.040 --> 43:56.560
DNA. And yet, it was not, it was not even an issue of discussion, right? I remember the big

43:56.560 --> 44:04.720
thing was, the big topic was, well, can, you know, the mRNA somehow reverse transcribe into the genome

44:04.720 --> 44:10.880
and, and, and can there be, you know, an integration event this way? And then, of course, you know,

44:10.880 --> 44:14.720
sort of the mainstream is like, no, no, no, that can't, there's no way that can possibly happen.

44:14.720 --> 44:19.520
Then there's a paper that shows that, well, it kind of could happen in vitro. So, but I mean,

44:19.600 --> 44:24.480
that was as far as that discussion went, right? And then, you know, then you've got this whole

44:24.480 --> 44:29.200
DNA contamination, you know, with Kevin McCurnan and, and Philip Buckholtz and so on. And, and I

44:29.200 --> 44:39.280
actually got myself into a little bit of trouble. When I reacted, you know, to some of these posts

44:39.280 --> 44:45.040
where, you know, and it does seem that this, this DNA contamination, the presence of it, at least

44:45.040 --> 44:50.080
it seems like it's been reproduced, the confirming that it is there. Yeah, that's basically there.

44:50.080 --> 44:54.880
No one seems to be sort of arguing that, no, that's, that's not a thing. You know, we're not arguing

44:54.880 --> 44:59.440
well, how much quantity and, and does it do anything clinically and so on. But so I mean,

44:59.440 --> 45:05.520
that at least seems to be confirmed, is my understanding, right? But then, you know, you've got Philip

45:05.520 --> 45:09.920
Buckholtz come out comes out and says, well, there's no, there's no way that this can cause

45:09.920 --> 45:14.560
cancer or that, you know, the, the Pfizer vaccine can cause cancer. And, and I'm coming from this

45:14.640 --> 45:20.720
from a, from a completely a clinician perspective where I'm looking at people developing all these

45:20.720 --> 45:24.640
cancers, you know, vaccinated people developing all these extremely aggressive cancers. And so,

45:25.200 --> 45:31.360
so I can tell you, like, I'm learning about this stuff. You know, to me, it's, it's, it's, it's

45:31.360 --> 45:39.120
fascinating. Now, the, my understanding of the lipid nanoparticle is, is that there's absolutely no,

45:39.520 --> 45:48.960
um, there's no way to control the delivery of this thing at all, at least in the, in the lipid

45:48.960 --> 45:52.480
nanoparticle that we're dealing with with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that this thing,

45:53.600 --> 45:59.200
um, if it ends up in, in, in the bloodstream like that, that's it. It's, there's, there's no way to,

45:59.840 --> 46:05.280
you know, predict or control where this stuff goes, right? And it could theoretically go everywhere.

46:06.240 --> 46:12.800
And I mean, on ironically, the, the guy that a lot of people credit for having invented this

46:12.800 --> 46:21.280
stuff, Peter Kullis has been on stage in 2022 saying that he said in the same question and answer

46:21.280 --> 46:29.840
session after a lecture that after the vaccine was said to be 95% effective, he opened up bourbon.

46:30.560 --> 46:36.880
And then in the second question, he said, Oh no, we can't target this. I wasted the post, I wasted

46:36.880 --> 46:43.280
five postdocs trying to target lipid nanoparticles to someplace. And the last postdoc actually

46:43.280 --> 46:48.400
demanded a different project or she was going to quit. And that was his way of explaining how

46:48.400 --> 46:53.280
they couldn't target it anywhere. So he thought that I guess that doesn't matter. I guess they

46:53.280 --> 47:01.440
work anyway. I mean, I don't know, it's extraordinary. Yeah. And then how did they, and how did they

47:01.440 --> 47:06.800
justify or how did they explain that this stuff was just staying in the arm? No, I mean, that's

47:06.800 --> 47:12.400
exactly what Peter said it won't. Then he knew it wouldn't. And I'm sure that he feels like he told

47:12.400 --> 47:17.920
them that it wouldn't. So that's why he felt very free to say it. It was really extraordinary. And

47:17.920 --> 47:24.640
that was in 2022. So it was well after they burnt Byron Bridal's career for suggesting that

47:24.640 --> 47:29.600
that was possible. So there's a lot of highly contradictory stuff going on, for sure.

47:30.400 --> 47:38.240
Yeah. And and and what, you know, what amazes me is that they're they're plowing ahead. I mean,

47:38.240 --> 47:41.920
they've come out openly. I think it was it was either Albert Burlauer, Stefan van Seller,

47:41.920 --> 47:47.840
both of them who said like, yeah, we're gonna use this same lipid nanoparticle for all future

47:47.840 --> 47:53.280
vaccines. And there's no like, you know, like, oh, no, we're we're doing more investigation. We,

47:53.280 --> 47:58.640
you know, we want to maybe develop a new new nanoparticle or lipid nanoparticle. Like there's

47:58.640 --> 48:03.120
that they're like, no, we're using the same thing. And we're going to use it in all future products.

48:04.480 --> 48:10.960
So they really don't seem to care that this thing basically ends up going everywhere and

48:10.960 --> 48:19.280
delivering the payload, which again, there's obviously questions surrounding what is the payload

48:19.280 --> 48:24.320
really composed of right now. I talked to, you know, David Speaker, who did

48:25.360 --> 48:29.360
again, some of the confirmation of the DNA contamination here in Canada. And you know,

48:29.360 --> 48:34.400
he's talking to me about these like, well, not just the DNA sort of fragments and plasmids and

48:34.400 --> 48:39.920
all that stuff, but then these like complexes, these DNA RNA hybrids. Yeah, they make like a

48:39.920 --> 48:46.960
triple helix of some kind. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so like imagine, let's assume that that is,

48:46.960 --> 48:50.640
there's a whole bunch of that, you know, these sort of triple heluses in there.

48:51.280 --> 48:56.880
And then you put it in in this lipid nanoparticle that delivers this stuff everywhere. I mean,

48:58.160 --> 49:03.600
I that's just in this this the whole thing is insane. Well, maybe everybody, maybe everybody

49:03.600 --> 49:08.800
will develop superpowers and it will be fine. Yeah, seriously. Well, they've put it enough people

49:08.800 --> 49:14.240
that that, you know, maybe some, you know, that's funny, you mentioned that, because

49:14.800 --> 49:18.400
there have actually been some claims that some people, their cancer went away,

49:19.920 --> 49:25.280
that after taking the COVID vaccines. Yeah, now again, anecdotal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:25.920 --> 49:32.960
Wow. But but again, so got got only knows, but but but if you're delivering, if you're delivering,

49:34.320 --> 49:38.320
you know, there's these various types of genetic material all over the body. I mean,

49:38.960 --> 49:45.120
I can only assume that this completely makes the immune system go nuts. Yeah. And I just don't

49:45.120 --> 49:53.040
have the, you know, I don't have the, you know, so the training, you know, to be able to tell you

49:53.040 --> 49:57.680
exactly, you know, what's happening with the immune system, maybe they don't even know. Maybe they

49:57.680 --> 50:03.120
themselves don't even know. Oh, I assure you they don't. But that's only because I think that's

50:03.120 --> 50:08.640
where you should always put your bet. No, for sure, they don't. They want us to believe that

50:08.640 --> 50:12.080
it's real simple and it's just antibodies. So if you make antibodies, you're fine.

50:12.800 --> 50:20.240
And that's definitely really not the way it is. What's your, what's the plan now? Like what,

50:20.240 --> 50:26.800
what, what are we doing with the the wellness company in in Canada? In America, the wellness

50:26.800 --> 50:34.320
company feels like they are a, at least would like to try to project as an alternative

50:35.040 --> 50:41.840
sort of, you know, telemedicine and I'm not necessarily against that. I'm, I have an HMO

50:41.840 --> 50:49.040
that we have a doctor that tolerates our stance now. But unfortunately, as I told you before,

50:49.040 --> 50:55.920
we started the stream, we gave them everything in 2022. So we've only just become trying to

50:55.920 --> 51:00.960
buck the system. So we haven't really tested it yet. And because we don't have insurance right

51:00.960 --> 51:07.360
now, we're not really testing it. So it's all, it's all just up in the air for me right now. But

51:07.360 --> 51:12.880
I don't, I don't have a, I don't have a bone to pick with the wellness company. I don't have a

51:12.880 --> 51:19.920
bone to pick necessarily with FLCC or any of these other groups. But it appears to me that

51:19.920 --> 51:24.400
recently there has been a bone to pick with the wellness company and people are suggesting that

51:24.400 --> 51:30.000
this, this lumberjack or whoever he is that the young guy that runs part or that started the company

51:30.080 --> 51:36.080
or as part of the company or I don't know. So how did you get recruited by them? What do you do for

51:36.080 --> 51:41.440
them? What do you not do for them? And what's your feeling on this attack or or are, let's not

51:41.440 --> 51:47.040
call it a tack, let's call it an extra attention that's being given to the wellness company. It's

51:47.040 --> 51:54.960
right. Not all positive. So, so I never belonged to any groups. And it's sort of not the way I am,

51:55.040 --> 52:01.360
I guess, you know, that's sort of my personality. I, I am very independent. I don't like to, you know,

52:01.360 --> 52:07.600
be as so, you know, purely associated with one group or another or belong to these groups. I've

52:07.600 --> 52:14.800
kind of always done my own thing. So Dr. Paul Alexander reached out to me and said, listen,

52:14.800 --> 52:19.840
you know, there's a bunch of us in this great company and we, we'd like you to join and we,

52:19.840 --> 52:24.800
you know, we want you to join on, on a advisory, like a, like a medical board,

52:24.800 --> 52:30.960
like a medical board advisory to, because we're expanding into Canada. And so, you know,

52:30.960 --> 52:34.720
it's, we've got Dr. Peter McCullough, as the chief scientific officer and a bunch of these

52:34.720 --> 52:37.920
other great doctors. And so, and I thought, you know, okay, that sounds like a great idea.

52:38.640 --> 52:45.280
And so I joined the wellness company and, you know, we, I got to interact with and work with

52:45.360 --> 52:50.560
really a bunch of great doctors. And that is what I see the wellness company as the wellness

52:50.560 --> 52:59.040
company to me is a group of fantastic doctors who saw who are basically outside the medical

52:59.040 --> 53:04.080
establishment saw through a lot of the nonsense in the pandemic. And it's, it's, it's a place where

53:04.080 --> 53:09.840
we can sort of bounce ideas back and forth. You know, we meet once a week or once every two weeks,

53:10.640 --> 53:16.160
we discuss what's going on, you know, we were constantly in touch with each other with emails

53:16.160 --> 53:23.360
and all that. So, so that to me is, is really the core of, of what the wellness company is. It's,

53:23.360 --> 53:30.240
it's sort of a, a getting together of, of minds, of great minds. And I was honored to, you know,

53:30.240 --> 53:36.160
be able to, you know, work with Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Harvey Reich, you know,

53:36.160 --> 53:43.440
Dr. Roger Hopkins in Canada, Dr. Mark Trosi. And, you know, there, there's some, it's allowed me

53:43.440 --> 53:52.160
to collaborate on some papers as well that are, you know, we're trying to get published in terms of,

53:52.160 --> 53:59.280
you know, vaccine injuries or autopsy reviews. And, you know, so they had products that they were

53:59.280 --> 54:05.440
offering to deal with, or to try to deal with, you know, some of the vaccine injuries.

54:06.800 --> 54:14.400
Is the guy Hodgkinson that you mentioned, is he an older fellow with glasses? And if I could say

54:14.400 --> 54:21.120
it in the most complimentary way, he's a very ornery guy. I mean, he's a friendly dude. I think

54:21.120 --> 54:27.120
he's very smart. I'm not saying anything negative about him. But I, I remember this name from the

54:27.200 --> 54:36.880
Doctors for COVID ethics in 2021, before they split off or something. And after they, the two groups

54:37.520 --> 54:42.880
divided into like the UK international something, something's in the Doctors for COVID ethics,

54:43.440 --> 54:49.440
then I think Roger may have left and just gone, you know, and worked on his own thing. Or maybe he

54:49.440 --> 54:54.720
left and joined one group or not the other group. And I lost kind of track of who he was. But what

54:55.040 --> 55:01.040
he's he he's a Canadian pathologist. That's right. Okay. Yes. That's him. That's him. He's he's he's a

55:01.040 --> 55:06.400
guy I would like to meet again, because he really came off to me as someone who was trying to let

55:06.400 --> 55:11.280
common sense lead. And he got really frustrated a lot when people wouldn't start first with,

55:11.280 --> 55:17.360
come on people. I remember that a lot. So I had a good impression of that guy. I'm glad to hear

55:17.360 --> 55:23.440
that he's he's tangled up with you. That's good. Yeah. And so, you know, this is how I see the

55:23.440 --> 55:31.360
we're sort of, you know, we're a group of doctors where we're there in an advisory role. And now

55:31.360 --> 55:38.960
what's interesting is that the so the company is expanding, expanding, expanding, and it's trying

55:38.960 --> 55:45.680
to expand in many different directions, ran into difficulties in Canada, with Health Canada,

55:46.240 --> 55:51.520
you know, coming after the the Canadian branch saying, okay, you know, you got to take all

55:51.520 --> 55:56.880
these products off and and you got to fill out some forms or get some number or what have you,

55:56.880 --> 56:01.520
right? And then they ran into some issues. So the Canadian part has been actually slowed down

56:01.520 --> 56:07.600
quite a bit. So I think that renewed the focus and the company is now expanding. It's expanding.

56:07.600 --> 56:13.840
So it's expanding beyond bringing doctors together. Now they're, you know, they've got

56:13.840 --> 56:21.920
partnership with Vigilant Fox and Vigilant News with Gateway Pundit. You've got you've got

56:21.920 --> 56:28.880
to deal with rumble and so on. So it's it's it's focused on seems to be like a rapid expansion.

56:29.680 --> 56:34.080
Now this is I think this is what rubs people the wrong way. And I think this is where where

56:34.080 --> 56:41.440
some people get concerned, especially when one entity seems to suddenly be everywhere, right?

56:41.520 --> 56:48.080
Or seems to be expanding at a very at a very high rate. So so that's where we're at right now.

56:48.080 --> 56:54.640
Now what's what I find interesting is that I come under attack from from every possible angle,

56:54.640 --> 57:01.680
from every direction, you know, and it's and I think the reason is because my approach to this

57:01.680 --> 57:07.200
whole thing, especially with these products, right, with these, you know, with the lipid nanoparticle

57:07.200 --> 57:14.640
mRNA products. My approach is the clinical. I want to know what these things are doing clinically.

57:14.640 --> 57:19.360
What is happening to people who've taken two, three, four, five, six of these injections,

57:19.360 --> 57:26.400
right? That is my focus. And this is I think what everyone else is trying to sweep under the rug.

57:28.560 --> 57:34.080
Even right now you've got the the UK government is changing the way it's going to report excess

57:34.160 --> 57:40.640
deaths. So that suddenly that excess deaths disappear, right? I get viciously attacked on the

57:40.640 --> 57:47.920
cancers. This this idea of turbo cancer and that there is a particular phenomenon that is unique

57:48.800 --> 57:56.880
to the lipid nanoparticle mRNA platform. There's this oncogenic phenomenon that is unique to that

57:56.880 --> 58:01.600
particular platform. And I don't have enough information to know, well, does it happen with

58:01.600 --> 58:07.360
AstraZeneca and J and J with a different delivery mechanism? And is this really a spike protein

58:07.360 --> 58:14.800
issue, regardless of the delivery mechanism? Or is really the lipid nanoparticle a big, big part of

58:14.800 --> 58:20.160
this? And the way this this genetic material gets delivered all over the body in a very

58:20.720 --> 58:30.000
efficient way, it seems, right? But but this idea of turbo cancer being a phenomenon specific

58:30.080 --> 58:37.280
to this particular product. I think it's something that the medical establishment wants to bury

58:37.280 --> 58:41.280
the politicians, you know, they don't they don't want anything to do with it. And obviously the

58:42.160 --> 58:48.720
sort of the pharmaceutical industry does not want to to to allow even for a one in a million

58:48.720 --> 58:53.840
chance, like they do with myocarditis, right? You saw what they did with myocarditis, they basically

58:53.840 --> 58:58.880
admit it and they say, well, it's rare. Yeah, one in 10,000, one in 20,000, rare and mild,

58:58.880 --> 59:03.920
but they admit it. And you know, they might even put a warning on the label and what have you,

59:03.920 --> 59:09.360
right? You know, we have this new study, this 99 million people study that's like, oh, well,

59:09.360 --> 59:14.000
you look, it's admitting myocarditis and pericarditis. And again, it's this red herring because

59:14.720 --> 59:21.120
what it does really, it's it neuters, the topic. And the way it neuters, the topic is that both

59:21.120 --> 59:25.600
sides will say, well, one side will say, look, it proves the injuries are much greater than we

59:25.680 --> 59:28.800
thought. And so on, the other, the other side says, well, you didn't do the statistics properly,

59:28.800 --> 59:32.880
and it's still one in a million, right? And it's still a rare event. And it basically,

59:32.880 --> 59:38.320
the topic's been neutered. Yeah, I think that I've been, I've been, I've been trying to teach

59:38.320 --> 59:42.480
various aspects of how they limit the spectrum of debate so that it really feels like you're

59:42.480 --> 59:46.240
arguing, but you're not actually arguing. Because as long as you argue about what they want you to

59:46.240 --> 59:52.480
argue about, you're never even paying attention to what the real ball is. I think just to give you

59:52.480 --> 59:56.880
an example of this one that I've been pushing for a couple of years now, there were a lot of

59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.280
people that I ran into behind the scenes in 2020 and 2021 that were hyper focused on aspects of

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:09.600
the spike protein as being as being number one, perfect evidence of it being a laboratory leak,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:16.320
but perfect evidence of it being a toxin or an engineered pathogen or or whatever. And it feels

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.520
very much now in retrospect, like those people were put there so that the the methodology of

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:29.600
transfection could be absolved of any fault and we could blame it all on this imaginary gain of

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.720
function spike protein that had these special attributes that if we just fixed it, then everything

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.800
would have been fine. But since we rushed it and we didn't know any better, we did we made a mistake,

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.960
but we can fix that in the next round. And I feel as though that is now being kind of replaced

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:54.080
with the DNA story, if only because they needed more of this same thing because the spike didn't

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.280
hit it as well as they hoped it was something like this. I totally agree with you. And I'm always

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:06.880
looking to see, you know, how how anyone might be trying to absolve the technology itself,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.960
just in the broad sense, right? And so how how can you clean it up, right? It's almost like

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.640
this idea. Well, well, that was the first generation and and of this technology. And well, we got

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.440
something wrong here, but you know, we fixed this with we fixed this manufacturing process. I'm so

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:31.120
happy to hear you say this. Oh my gosh, or or or you know, we fixed this law or what have you

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.760
and how these things are produced. And and to me, it's very simple. It's very simple because

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.080
what you see is you see the big money is plowing ahead with this

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.440
by building all the facilities, the factories all around the world and so on. And they're doing

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:58.720
it in a manner where the they're assuming that the acceptance of the population is a foregone

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:05.280
conclusion. You don't invest billions and billions and billions of dollars into facilities. If there's

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.160
a question, if the population is going to basically rise up and say absolutely not, and no one's going

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:16.240
to take the product, they're assuming that they've won the war on on the population accepting these

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:23.520
products. Now it's just a question of how do they bring people there, right? Because obviously with

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.040
the COVID vaccines, the I mean, we're down to what 10, 15% of people taking it. So they need to

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.040
figure out. Oh, I think you're so right that we are not where they wanted us to be. They really

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.240
did not want us to be where we are. And so now they have they're having a trouble adapting their

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.680
plan because their plan was to go all in. And and I don't think they have many alternatives

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.080
other than to continue doubling down until enough of us say no. Yeah. And and you know what? It's

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.440
fascinating because when you look at the way the last booster has been marketed by let's think

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.440
about that, right? Well, first they went with this the by valent booster nonsense where you get

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:10.080
you get two types of spike, right? And but you know, every time they they roll out a booster shot,

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:17.360
there's a significant drop off in uptake. And I think once the initial booster uptake was only

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.960
down to like 40, 50%. I think they probably knew that they had a problem. Yeah. And then every

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.520
since then, you know, it just drops and it's down to 25%. It's not down to 15%. Right. Now,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:33.360
there was a huge marketing push with this last booster shot. And again, a lot of people didn't

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.200
catch it and notice it. And I'd kind of gone back into the literature and try to figure out what

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:45.680
they're thinking. And the marketing was this, they were trying to remarket the boosters as an

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.200
annual shot that you take with your flu vaccine. And it's just as safe as the flu vaccine. And

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.120
and it's an annual shot that you get at your doctor. And wouldn't it be convenient if you just

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.880
got both shots in one visit? I mean, they're both safe. They're doing it here too. Absolutely. They

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:09.920
are. Yep. Right. And I and I see there was a lot of money actually that went into this marketing

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:16.400
campaign of the double shot. I mean, we had we had the we had the Toronto mayor, Olivia Chow,

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.520
you know, at a press conference, say, I got I got my two Jabs, you know, go get your double

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.920
jab. Just get your double jab. And this this idea of the double jab, the two different

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.800
band dates, two different colored band dates to show you got well, you got one flu and you got

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.160
one COVID, right? This was a marketing campaign to try to bring the uptake at least to 50%, which

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.360
is what they were talking about. Well, we managed to get uptake of the flu vaccine to about 50% over

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:51.120
time. If we, you know, change the marketing, maybe we can get everybody else to taking these

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.760
mRNA products back to 50%. And maybe that's just the first step. They're like, well, if we can

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.800
get everyone to 50%, maybe eventually we could figure out ways of getting, you know, the uptake

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:06.400
higher. But but when you see, like, I mean, they've they've plowed ahead with this technology to

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.200
like this technology, as far as they're concerned, is here to stay. It's it's just how do we

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.840
remarket it to make it palatable. And you're right. I mean, I am concerned that the DNA contamination

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:27.120
as as honest as some of these individuals are. And I believe they are honest in the work that

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.560
they do. Absolutely. I do believe that the sudden

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.880
what do you call it? The the sudden exposure and the wide exposure of this DNA contamination story,

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.400
where a lot of news outlets are covering it, I can tell you there's an in there's a there's a

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.640
rebel news, for example, has never given me an interview in the last sort of seven years that

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.840
I've been fighting corruption here in Canada. And it's a huge news story for them. They ran

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.800
with a huge interview on the DNA contamination story. They will not touch any story about

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.760
turbo cancer. They will not touch, you know, all the work that I had done about, you know, Canadian

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.600
doctors dying suddenly or any of the sudden deaths that I've been covering. And yet they did a

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:19.840
huge interview on the DNA contamination story, right? Because that apparently was greenlit to

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.880
get out there into a broader audience. So I am worried that that is actually being that

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:37.760
story is being used to effectively rehabilitate the mRNA platform where

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:43.520
maybe they clean up the DNA contamination or their manufacturing processes. Maybe they come up

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.240
with us with a different manufacturing process instead of DNA plasmids and E. coli or whatever

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.280
it is, right? And then suddenly the technology is as good as new. And look, it actually, it works

01:06:53.280 --> 01:07:00.480
great. We just have to fix, you know, my friend, my friend has been arguing that one of the directions

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.640
they may go is one that they've been seeding in our heads for a long time, this personalized

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.920
medicine. And so if they have to make a personalized RNA vaccine for you, then there's no FDA involved,

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.960
right? Because it's just made for you. And that's one possibility of where they are taking this

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.240
idea that the now that we got lucky and the pandemic proved that this stuff works like a charm,

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.040
we might as well just roll it out everywhere. I mean, it's it's frightening. It definitely is

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.800
frightening. It is. It is. And you're right. And in that regard, the personalized aspect,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:41.440
as far as I can tell, they're bringing it through these the cancer vaccine, right? So the mRNA

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:47.120
cancer vaccine is a personalized vaccine, right? It is tailored to your specific tumor.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.040
Right. When you look at the literature that they put out on it, it's they say, well, you know,

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:59.040
we take a sample of your tumor and we run it through our whatever, you know, processes and

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.280
they they figure out which, which, you know, genetic sequences they want to use from your tumor.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.120
And then they produce it, they produce a special vaccine batch just for you. And then they give

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:19.680
it back to you and they inject you with several shots, right? They're actually the, you know,

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.880
the guy who fell for this, unfortunately, recently, he's got a great for glioblastoma.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.960
As an Australian, I believe he's a pathologist, Australian pathologist Professor Scalia.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:36.640
And he this summer, you know, a big time guy in Sydney, like a huge professor,

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:43.280
run some huge institute in Sydney, and he gets diagnosed with a great for glioblastoma.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.280
And so, of course, it doesn't say could be related to the vaccine or whatever, nothing, right?

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:59.760
And basically what he does is he, he sets up a collaboration with Moderna to receive a personalized

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.680
mRNA cancer vaccine outside, I believe it's outside of their trials, which they're doing

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:17.040
for melanoma. And they're doing a special treatment for him to tailor the technology

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:24.000
to treat his glioblastoma. And he's basically now coming out saying, well, this is first in the

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.600
world. I'm the first in the world to get this, you know, personalized treatment and so on.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.720
I would recommend people look into that. It's a fascinating story.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.280
Wow.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:41.760
Scalia, S-C-O-L-Y-E-R. Professor Scalia, I could look up his first name.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.880
But it's, and it's, it's, they're doing it very publicly. Professor Richard Scalia.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.520
And they're being very public about it. And it's fascinating because I don't know if,

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.720
again, I don't think he's part of their trial, part of their clinical trial,

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.160
phase three trial, because they started phase three trials on these personalized

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.520
cancer vaccines, but specifically for melanoma. But they're adopting it in his case to glioblastoma.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.960
This is where it's headed, right? I mean, I mean, this is where they're pushing the technology.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.960
I do not know. I don't know.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.480
I don't know. This is really great that you said this because I did not know that Moderna had

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.800
already done it. That was already doing it. That's cool. Yeah, yeah, they're doing the,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.360
I believe it's phase three trials, and they're doing them in Australia for melanoma.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.200
I believe it's in partnership with Merck as well.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.920
Now, I also see the push, and I don't know how you feel about the self-amplifying mRNA

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.000
vaccine. I feel like it's probably a bad idea if it works. But anyway, I get their,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.480
their sales pitch is silly, right? That, well, we won't put as much in you, and then it'll make

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.960
copies of itself. That's horrible marketing. It's horrible. I mean, my God, like if people

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.200
don't want this, it's not because, you know, they were upset that they got, you know, too much RNA

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.360
with the Pfizer and Moderna. Like, you know, they're upset because they got injured or,

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.840
I mean, this idea that, you know, we'll only give you 20% of the, you know, of the genetic

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.200
material, that that's a horrible sales pitch. But I guess they need a sales pitch of some kind.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.760
Yeah, I think it's a little bit too much orchestration for me too, the idea that they can, you know,

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.160
they're basically then, you know, not getting into the debate about whether viruses exist as we

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.480
are told they exist or not, but they're basically creating a virus if they can put an mRNA into

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:49.280
your body and get it to make copies of itself. That's a pretty, it's a pretty, I think it seems

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.840
like a pretty serious, I don't know why I don't like this phrase for this thing, but it's like

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.440
gain a function almost, right? I mean, it's transmission, but transmission on turbo, if they

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:05.200
can do that. So it doesn't sound like a good idea, indeed. Yeah, exactly. And I think what, I mean,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:11.200
if this, they claim this works, but assuming that this technology works as they say they do,

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:20.240
I think it actually opens up even more questions about the entire platform, right? Then we had

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:28.240
with just the original idea. And this kind of brings me back to, like you said, the focus on

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.480
spike to try to exonerate the platform in the sense that, well, if we just put a different protein

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.000
in there, a different sequence, then it's going to be okay. All the problems with the spike protein

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.520
will disappear. I assume that's why nobody's questioning the use of it for RSV or pneumonia

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.960
or any of this other thing, because they assume, well, that's not a gain a function protein,

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:55.280
it'll be fine. I mean, otherwise, how can you rationalize this that it will just work? And you

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:01.360
can replace existing or create something that doesn't exist, I actually is what were most of

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:07.120
these things are there. They're quote unquote vaccines for targets that we have never been able

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.080
to vaccinate against before. The RSV one really drives me nuts because it feels like

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.760
marketing with fear to old people. And they're doing it on TV here in America, and it's just

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:26.320
awful. It's really awful. Yeah, so I think you're absolutely right. I think

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:36.480
there will be a push, a very strong push to exonerate the platform in one way or another.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:44.640
And again, I am assuming that the vast majority of the problems we're seeing

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.880
with the COVID vaccines, we're going to see the same problems with the RSV vaccine,

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.360
we're going to see the same problem with an influenza mRNA vaccine, with a CMV vaccine,

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.280
with an HIV vaccine, if they come out with one. I think a lot of the problems,

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:06.560
again, I'm hypothesizing here, but my hypothesis is that a lot of the problems are going to be

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:13.760
the same. If not, if not, most of them, or maybe even all of them. Yeah, I don't think there can

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:20.080
be almost any doubt. I mean, I came out really early because we used transfection in our animals

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:27.040
all the time. And so we expressed proteins in the brains of rats and monkeys and studied the effects

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.800
as the protein came into expression. But we also understood that that wasn't an augmentation

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.360
that the animal would live through. Eventually, the immune system would come in and take those

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:45.440
neurons out. And so if you wanted to see the anatomical place that you altered the protein

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.640
expression, you had a certain window where you could do the experiment, you could watch the animal,

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.040
you could do the behavior, you could do the amino histochemistry. And if you did it within that

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.360
window, you'd get a nice stain. And there would be these fluorescent neurons. And you could say,

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.320
look, we transfected neurons in the amygdala and fear freezing behavior changed. And so that means

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.320
our protein is involved in fear freezing behavior. If you took that same experiment and let it go

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.000
for more weeks, the neurons that you transfected would all be gone. And the effect on the behavior

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.240
would all be gone because those neurons would have been removed from the circuit. And so you

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:29.200
wouldn't be able to affect the behavior anymore. And that was just given. We just understood that

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:34.800
the limitations of this technique are that once you transfect these neurons, the immune system

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.760
will eliminate them. So when they started to explain on television that they were thinking

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:44.480
about transfecting people and calling an investigational vaccine, I was like, wait a minute,

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.560
this doesn't make any sense. And when the first person selling it on PBS NewsHour was Bill Gates,

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.800
I was livid. I was like, you got to be kidding me. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.480
And so I went from being completely bought into everything and wanting to be an academic superhero

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:11.440
to wishing I could take those many years back in some respects. And so what are you going to do

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.080
now? What are you up to now? You're still happily retired. And so you can choose to spend your time

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.040
as you will. Do you have a family? Are they're all behind you? How's that all work?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:28.960
Yeah, my family's behind me. I have two kids. They understand to some degree what's going on.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.560
And I think I think that's important. You know, sometimes my wife's like, don't tell them that

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.520
or don't show them this and this. I'm like, I, you know, they have to understand you, you know,

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.120
you can't shield your kids with, you know, from things that are going to affect them.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.520
Obviously, you know, through their adult life and in their future. Because I think we are,

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:55.680
we are headed in a new, well, I mean, I shouldn't say, I mean, we are in a new, we are in a new

01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:02.880
paradigm. And it's, and I think most people don't understand what that paradigm is. I think there's

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.760
a lot of focus on it being like a biological warfare or gain affection and so on. And I don't

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.040
think that's the right paradigm. I think we are in a basically a genetic.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.320
Oh, that's the right word for it. Um, genetic manipulation, genetic modification.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.640
A friend of mine, a friend of mine, Mark Coolack would say that they inverted us and

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.760
changed us into experimental animals. They might not be experimenting on all of us all the time,

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:35.440
but that's the plan. Um, I actually had another friend of mine shock me this morning and explain

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:41.760
that you can think of Israel as, as, as Gaza being a weapons lab and Israel is being a medical

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:48.720
lab. And there isn't really much to say that, that says that's a very bad characterization because

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.480
it kind of is. You know what, you just brought up something, uh, something very fascinating. And

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.360
I want to jump on it right away before I forget because there's, there's a clip. So there was

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:06.160
an interview that Jordan Peterson did with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli president. It wasn't that

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.440
long ago. It was maybe, I, maybe now it's been, you know, six months ago or this, this is very

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.080
ominous. I don't like that guest list at all. Oh my goodness. No, but, but this is, this is

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.320
fascinating. And at, you know, at some point I ran across this clip completely by accident.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:28.240
It was about a three minute clip of Benjamin Netanyahu talking about how he procured the vaccine.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.880
And, and the reasons behind it and so on. And the, and the final, the piece of this,

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:40.640
which is about three or four minutes long, was clipped out of the interview. And it's not available

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.960
on YouTube. And I, and I, I sat through the whole interview and I'm like, okay, where's this?

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.280
Where's this thing? It was edited out. They edited it out. Oh, but the clip is out there. And, and

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.000
I'm telling you, it is like the best three or four minutes anyone will spend, you know,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.200
listening to Benjamin Netanyahu, because what he goes on to say is that, well, first he wanted

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.360
Israel to be the first one to get the vaccine. So he made a special deal with Pfizer. No problem.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.880
Then he says, well, we have pretty much the entire population on a digital,

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.720
digital healthcare system. So then he says, well, we knew exactly what the vaccines were doing.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.360
Because everyone's healthcare was digitized. So they knew what the vaccines were doing. And he

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.680
just says it openly like that, right? And then he says, well, we basically handed everyone's

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:36.720
digital health information to the pharmaceutical industry. And then he says what, what actually

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:44.480
is the plan going forward? And what he says is that on top of this medical digital information

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:51.840
database, we will put a genetic database of each individual in Israel. We'll put a genetic, we'll

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.880
get the genomic, you know, we'll get the genome of everybody in Israel. And then he laughs and he

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.960
says, oh, well, we might have to pay like the people who don't want to give us a DNA sample,

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:07.600
we might have to pay them to, you know, incentivize. But he said we're going to get the genetic

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:14.480
information of everyone and put it on top of this medical database. And then he literally says

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:17.680
we're going to give it to the pharmaceutical industries and they're going to run it through

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:25.440
their AI algorithms. Exactly. To develop a whole host of new drugs.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.760
That's the whole plan. They have been thinking this for decades already that the human genome

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:39.280
project actually started out with this, this ended with this revelation after sequencing the genome

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.240
and coming up with all these markers that the only way they enter any hope of cracking the actual

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:49.920
code was to sequence every human they could possibly sequence. And it's fascinating that in

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.360
this three, four minute clip, he lays out the whole thing. And he basically says, you know,

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.640
like he says, yeah, some people will not want to give their DNA sample. So we'll just pay them.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:07.120
We'll just incentivize them. I can't believe it's taken me this long to hear you speak this

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.800
stuff because it's really almost, I mean, it is dead on balls accurate for where I find myself

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.720
thinking they really have. And it's not just me, you know, there's a couple other people. I really

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:25.760
want to give credit to my friend Mark Coolack because he really had me not seeing it fully and

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:33.680
not had me seeing it but helped me to see it more fully as as why because that's also what dispels

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.120
this myth that they're trying to just depopulate because they don't want to just depopulate. They

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.840
want to reduce population and use us as we go. There's a they need to collect the data as we go.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.320
They can't just kill us all and burn us. That's not what they want at all. Why would they do that?

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:57.040
They're missing out on millions of possible data points. And I think if they if you think

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.720
even more darkly about it, if the goal from global governance is to get us down to a billion,

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.720
then this is the last opportunity they have to collect this many examples of the human genome.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.920
It's like how many games of go or how many games of chess can you play before you figured out the

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:20.720
game? That's what the human genome and medical data attached to it is. It's examples of the same

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.840
game and they imagine that if they have enough of these games that the AI will solve the problem

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.200
and then they'll be the futurists that they think they should be. I really imagine that this mythology

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:36.880
is why what's propelling this. In 10 more years, the computers will be enough or in 10 more years

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.920
will have enough data. And they've been saying that since the 80s, unfortunately.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.200
Yeah. No, and I mean, it's it's it's fascinating because I mean, as as I mean, he's he's the

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.640
president of Israel. He obviously has, you know, direct access to to Pfizer, for example, and he's

01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:00.080
laying this out and he's and he really like to him, it's a matter of fact, it's a foregone conclusion

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:06.560
that this is where it's headed. So it was just a fascinating like it blew my mind when I saw

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:12.160
the clip. I was like, Oh my God, he's just he's just laying it all out. Did you speak or give a

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:18.000
talk at the NCI at all? Or did you how do you how is that going in Canada now? I gave a talk a

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.040
long time ago, but I heard now they're some they're going to put out a report or something. I don't

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:28.640
know where that is at. Yeah. So I did give a report to NCI. It was more focused on things like mandates

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.720
and the way the government was manipulating data. And even the even all the doctors that have now

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.320
taken, you know, four or five, six shots, dropping dead, dropping, you know, dying,

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:43.200
suddenly developing all kinds of bizarre cancers and so on. I did give, I think it was almost three

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.720
hour testimony. Oh, wow, good for you. They, you know, they put it into the report, the transcripts

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.240
in there, they put out it's like a 5000 page. Oh, there's there's a link in the chat already. Great.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.680
Thank you. Yeah. So so yeah, that's that's all on record. That that's all out there. And I gave

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.600
some some documents as well. I did give sort of a I guess you could say a primer on on the

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:12.560
turbo cancer and what I think that is or as far as as we know up to this point and what might be

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.680
happening. Are you also can you confirm this for me from your own perspective? I know you're not a

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:22.560
practicing cancer doctor now, but I've heard many people explain it this way and I don't really

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:29.120
explain it very often because I'm not a cancer doctor. But is it a is the the prevalent thinking

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:35.600
that your body is always managing that problem? And so if you stop the management of it, you could

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.360
release. Is that how you see it? The turbo cancer is not really that now we have a new kind of

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:47.280
cancer, but so much that your immune system has become so lack of vigilance that it appears to

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.400
be turbo. And in a normal healthy person, this would never happen. Is that kind of how you're

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:59.840
seeing it? I think that's part of it. I don't think it's the full full answer because I'll tell

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:08.080
you so so this is the idea that you have sort of ongoing surveillance, carried out by the immune

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.880
system. And then if you damage that surveillance in various ways, then a cancer could potentially

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.560
you know, grow in a completely uncontrolled manner which which which which would explain some of

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:28.160
the behavior. There's more to it though. Okay, I'm excited. So the the component that I'm

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:37.840
very concerned about which I and I don't understand it is there has to be a local effect.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.640
And it's basically where the lipid nanoparticle delivers the genetic payload

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.120
in certain locations. There there is a local effect. I think there's a reason why

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.240
you know, a lot of these are bone marrow cancers or cancers of the cancers of the pancreas,

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.360
cancers of the testes, cancers of the gallbladder. When you think about that argument, I like that

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.600
argument a lot. Thank you very much. When you think about lipid nanoparticles being cleared by

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:12.000
the liver, right, the hepatobiliary system, how come we're seeing stage four calangiocarcinomas

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.440
in young people, stage four, you know, pancreatic cancers, gallbladder cancers,

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.000
colon cancers, how do you explain that, right? And I mean that that that gives you the entire

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.560
clearance pathway for the lipid nanoparticles, for example, right? But then you also have

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.880
testicular cancers. Well, we know there's, you know, accumulation of lipid nanoparticles in

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:40.320
tested testes. And so, and again, no one talks about this really, but beyond the damage to the

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.800
immune system. And again, there's various mechanisms of that, which is a systemic thing,

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.360
right? That's a systemic issue. I believe there's a local issue. And it's a problem of not this,

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.920
it's not a problem of the spike protein. It's a problem of the lipid nanoparticle delivering the

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:05.600
payload in sufficient quantities to a certain location. And there's a local effect. I see

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:17.920
that is carcinogenic. So that's my that is at least my feeling that that is a crucial part of it.

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.520
And so there you can go back to where the lipid nanoparticle, they're almost not talking about

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:29.040
it, but they know that they they do a preparation to it that makes it appear inert. But as soon as

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.680
it delivers, it's it's payload, it becomes this very cationic, dangerous compound again. And there,

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:42.000
if you had DNA damage or nicking or mitochondrial damage, all this other stuff that we don't understand,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.320
I think it's almost too convenient that we're always talking about the spike.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.680
And the thing is, is if if if the lipid nanoparticle is a big part of this,

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:59.600
all of these cancers, then the entire platform is dead. Yes, absolutely, it is. Right. Which is

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:06.800
why I think there's such an aggressive effort to suppress any talk about turbo cancers or

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.640
cancers being caused by the vaccines, because like I said, it's someone's going to stumble

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:18.400
upon something. So are you worried that that's what the SV 40 is about? Like this whole, you know,

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.040
SV 40 is in the DNA. And so then they can blame the cancer on that when it's, you know,

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.280
I think the S 40 SV 40 is a red herring. Yeah, I've been feeling that. I'm not going to look,

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.800
I'm not going to exclude it. I'm not going to say no way. That's not a possible mechanism.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:43.200
I just I feel it's a red herring. And I don't think I just don't think it explains a lot of

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.840
what I'm seeing. But like I said, someone someone may stumble at some point

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.240
upon maybe more about, you know, the lipid nanoparticles. And it doesn't have to be one

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.760
explanation either, right? They could all be contributing to your right. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:03.120
and the thing is, is I've said this in other interviews, is that, you know, we're most likely

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:08.000
looking at multiple mechanisms occurring in different people, because again, the behavior is

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.080
different. So, so I see certain patterns, right? I'm trained in pattern. I mean,

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.400
radiology is a pattern recognition specialty. Like, you know, if we're honest about it. Okay.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:23.120
And so I do see patterns where, for example, some people will, you know, they'll have a

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:28.880
Pfizer or Moderna and like within three, four months, bam, they've got a great for glioblastoma.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.320
And it's always like that. It's always that three, four month time period, right? And then

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.000
it'll kill them in in about in less than a year. And I've seen a lot of those, right?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.800
So you see the ones where they'll kill you in a matter of months, those, those processes. And

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.040
it doesn't matter what you throw at them. The oncologist, they can throw all kinds of chemo,

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:49.840
all kinds of radiation therapy, all kinds of immunotherapy. Nothing works. Nothing

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:55.760
works. This thing is just on fire. And there is nothing the oncologist can do to put it out.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:00.240
And you're dead in a matter of months, sometimes even weeks, but let's say usually a matter of

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.240
months, right? But then you've got situations where someone is, you know, struggling with this

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:10.640
cancer for a year, year and a half. And it seems that there's partial response to chemo or maybe

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.960
you get like a short term remission where this thing appears to go into remission for a couple

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:20.080
of months. And then it comes roaring back. And then it's, you know, it's usually more aggressive.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.680
And then and then so there are multiple patterns that are happening, which probably means that

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:33.920
there's multiple mechanisms. And so again, I don't know if I don't know if they have the ability to

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.080
track any of this. I don't know if they can track any of these reactions through lots,

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:43.360
lot numbers, for example, I don't know. But there's certainly it looks like there's multiple

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:50.000
mechanisms at play, but I'm very concerned about the local effect that the lipid nanoparticles have

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.520
on particular tissues. I'm glad that you said that because it is really, there's no doubt in my

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:03.840
mind that there has to be some we need to attribute some aspect to to all of these things. And so

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:08.560
it's really important. I really, I really think that's helped me understand this better. That's

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:15.280
really great. It is one hour and 29 minutes. And I don't think I ever asked you to stay for a week.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:21.680
So I can have you back anytime you want. I'm actually so pleasantly surprised that your take

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:28.400
on this pandemic that, yeah, I don't know how it is that I haven't met you before. I guess it's

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:36.000
because that's by design. Everybody with with the humble humility to be skeptical but not be

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.600
certain seems to be separated from and only the people who are certain they know what's going on

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.920
are rising. And so I really am so happy to talk to someone who isn't certain that what they know

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:53.680
is going on, but just certain something is going on. So I can't compliment you enough for for

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:59.680
risking your retirement and comfort speaking out on behalf of Canadian citizens. I hope that

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:07.040
you can continue to do so. Is there a place where you're findable? How do you spread your word? Do

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:12.480
you have a website or anything like that? Yeah, no, I really, you know, I really enjoy this conversation

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:17.920
and I appreciate, I appreciate, you know, sort of being able to explore these things and just

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:23.840
kind of kind of see, you know, where where it takes us, you know, where the discussion takes us.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:28.400
It's it's it's it's rare that, you know, we can get those kinds of conversations. So I really

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:36.320
appreciate that. People can find me on Twitter at MAC SMD and on sub stack MAC SMD dot sub stack

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:43.040
dot com. There's been a lot of effort I could tell you to have me sort of silenced to make sure that

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:48.960
I don't rise or that I don't get, you know, there's a lot of shows that I haven't been able to get

01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.760
on or a lot of people who won't interview me, a lot of conferences I haven't been invited to. So,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:59.920
so there is all of that kind of going on in the background and I get it, you know, it's that's

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:07.440
sort of the nature of I don't even want to call it resistance, but it's basically the nature of

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:13.120
of this this this field that we're in. But I'm just pushing, I just push, I just keep pushing

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.120
forward. Right. I mean, that's I would, I would think the only thing that I could that I could

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:26.800
offer is that after all of my experience starting in 2020, I would say I've been contacted by no

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:35.040
less than 15 people who never intended to help me and have ended up basically not helping me and

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.760
they're not they're not my friend anymore. But at one point, they profess to be a supporter and a

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:47.600
friend. And so we've come an awful long way in these four years. And so now I think it's there's a

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:53.360
there's a lot of the American word is a slog. You just have to we're just gonna have to walk

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.080
through the mud now. And there's a goal over there. And we just need to do that slog now. And it

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.160
starts with our kids. It starts with young people. It starts with giving all of these doctors the

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:11.440
opportunity to realize without humiliation how well they were taken by this this fear and confusion

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.080
and doubt that they put out there and seated. I've been trying to say for a long time that one of

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.640
the things that they did it with is a is a hint that the worst case scenario has to be avoided and

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:29.760
it is now possible. And so they scared us into believing that if we didn't conform, that potentially

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:35.280
something could spiral out of control. And that potential has been the fear that they got everybody

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:41.280
in line with in Israel and they got everybody to test in America. And so that's really

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.760
it's going to be a one person at a time kind of thing. And as you as you noted, so many people

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:55.440
are in it where it will cost them too much to to snap out of it. And so unfortunately, a lot of

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:00.960
them are going to have to lose somebody and then doubt how they lost them. I just in December

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:08.320
of last year, one of my friends had a aneurysm that nobody expected. He's 49. He has two beautiful

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:14.800
daughters and a beautiful that a perfect family. And it's just gone now. And I have almost no doubt

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:21.920
in my mind that you don't. This is not an it's not a random thing that happened to him. And

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.080
unfortunately, because of the way the pandemic went, a guy who I've been friends with for 25

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:35.520
years wasn't really listening to me and didn't really take my my skepticism seriously, because

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.080
you know, I was that crazy guy all the time. And it's unfortunate. But yeah, we're we're much

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:49.680
farther than we were in 2020. And yeah, that's true. And so I do but but I think and I think,

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.240
you know, as you say, I think we're we are though at a point where the people who will

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:56.960
really wake up are the people who are going to lose

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.160
have to lose something. Yes, they do. Absolutely. At the very, very, very minimum, they have to

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:10.320
apologize to a lot of people and a lot of patients. And you know, imagine how moving it would be,

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.160
though, if a lot of people would say, wow, I made a mistake, I took this too, but we're never going

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:20.240
to do it again. It would be wonderful, wouldn't it? If you could get the average physician in

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.400
America to start there, because maybe even then, then the skepticism of, I don't want to start a

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.280
whole another conversation, but you know, the difference even between the Canadian childhood

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.680
schedule and the Norwegian schedule and the American schedule becomes very obvious. What's

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.880
going on here is pretty pretty creepy. So we have a long ways to go. But I think this is actually

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.880
a very good networking moment. And I'm very happy to meet you. I'm very happy to know you're around

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.720
on this planet. And I hope we see each other again. Absolutely. Yeah, it was a pleasure. Thank you

01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:00.160
very much. Thank you. This is Dr. William Macus. And he's from Alberta, Canada. And he is a new

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.840
friend of Gigo and biological. Thank you very much for joining me. I'll see you again soon.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:10.720
Take care. Yep. I'm going to end this little meeting there. Thank you very much, guys, for joining me.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:17.280
This has been Gigo and biological. That's the guy that's him on LinkedIn. This is him on Google

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.760
Scholar. This is him on research gate. And you can also Google him, of course, and you can find

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.200
them in a bunch of places there. He's also on Twitter. And I think on Instagram as well, you can see

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.560
him there. I don't know what to say. I really liked his take on a lot of things. I really liked

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:42.480
his his humbleness. I really felt as though whoops, I really felt as though he wasn't necessarily

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.400
certain about anything. And he was very, very humble in terms of his, you know, interpretation

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:55.680
of where he is and what his role is in this all, talking about doctors dying to the shot and

01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:01.280
nobody talking about them bringing attention to these kinds of things. It's happy. I'm happy to see

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.960
that that there are more people who are just trying to sort of move this ball forward

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.040
regardless of the resistance. And so thank you very much for joining me. This has been

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:17.840
Gigo and biological, a high resistance. Illinois's information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:28.480
I'm really happy that this happened. And I have a friend, Kara, to thank for this. So Kara in Canada,

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:37.280
a supporter and my unofficial scheduler. You scored a big goal here. Thank you very much for introducing

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:44.480
me to Dr. Macus. And yeah, thanks for being up there for me with you and Jeff and your family.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.240
Thank you very much, everybody, for supporting me. This is Gigo and biological. My name is Jonathan

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.560
Cooey. I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This is the back of my garage.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.160
And I will probably see you tomorrow. What's tomorrow? Tomorrow's Saturday? Is that right?

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:05.280
My gosh, I'm losing my mind here. No, tomorrow's Friday. I'll definitely see you tomorrow. So

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:11.040
it'll be my show. And we'll do a little brief. We'll have some slides. We'll have some music.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.360
We'll talk some smack about what everybody's talking smack about. Lots of sub stacks and all

01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.640
kinds of stuff talking about Mark and me. So we got to get this biology cleared out. We got to get

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.400
this story cleared out. So we'll see you tomorrow because that's what we do here. Thank you very

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400
much.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.320
It's Cara with a C. Cara with a C.
