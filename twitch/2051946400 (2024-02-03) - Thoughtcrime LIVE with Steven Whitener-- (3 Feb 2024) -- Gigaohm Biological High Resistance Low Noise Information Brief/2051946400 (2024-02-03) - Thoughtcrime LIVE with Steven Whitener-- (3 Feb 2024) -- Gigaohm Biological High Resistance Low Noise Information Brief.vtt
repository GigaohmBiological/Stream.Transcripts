WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:55.200
if

00:55.200 --> 00:57.440
There's a little echo, though.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.360
Oh, OK, I know.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.520
I heard an echo on somebody else's mic, not on mine.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.240
That's probably mine.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.520
I got a speaker right next to my mic.

01:03.520 --> 01:04.920
Oh, oh, yeah.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.000
I think you were you going to stream as well, JJ, or?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.040
I am, but it's just going to be me.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.360
I mean, you won't see it, right?

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
It's OK?

01:13.360 --> 01:14.480
No, yeah, that's fine.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.400
I just didn't want to.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
I didn't want there to be out.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.040
I want to do a little sound check beforehand,

01:18.040 --> 01:19.960
make sure you weren't going to get echo while you were doing

01:19.960 --> 01:20.720
that and all.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.520
And that's fine.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.160
Yeah, it's already live, so you're already doing it.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.760
It's wrestling, well, howdy.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.680
Let me see if I can get that up here.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.280
OK.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.640
This is where we are right now.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.880
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to talk

01:35.880 --> 01:38.480
to Republic Broadcasting Network.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.520
And the host's name is Stephen Whitener.

01:42.520 --> 01:47.320
He has a broadcast called Truth.

01:47.320 --> 01:47.760
Oh, sorry.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.520
Thought crime.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.360
Thought crime live.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.400
Thought crime live.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.440
Thought crime live, yes, sir.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.800
I'm showing him the picture of your website right now,

01:53.800 --> 01:55.240
so it's not that I can't read.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.000
It's just that I was looking at a different screen.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.080
So we're going to start that at 9 o'clock.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.920
We're doing a sound check right now.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.880
Steve, I'm not talking anymore to them.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.640
I'm talking to you.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.520
Go ahead.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.400
Oh, terrific.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.120
Yeah, well, thanks for joining me this morning.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.720
It's going to be very good.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.280
I think that my listeners really appreciate what you have to say.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.880
I've learned a lot from you.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.600
And you know, your real thought criminal,

02:16.600 --> 02:20.760
that's kind of what the, and I'll tell the guy, if anybody's

02:20.800 --> 02:23.800
watching the stream, when you could see it on the website,

02:23.800 --> 02:24.600
what happened to me?

02:24.600 --> 02:27.880
I worked at this hazardous waste treatment company

02:27.880 --> 02:30.320
and blew the whistle on them back in 1990.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.000
And how did you chloride gas?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.160
I kind of blew the whistle on them, and it caused me.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.240
And I kept me beat down for a lot of years.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.680
So I started this radio show, and now I

02:39.680 --> 02:42.000
have a lot of respect for people who speak out

02:42.000 --> 02:44.360
and tell the truth, and I've learned a lot from you.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.920
And that's kind of why I wanted to have you on.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.460
I'm in your stream pretty often, and we'll

02:48.460 --> 02:49.720
post a comment now and then.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.480
But I'm not on there every day.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.400
You're the go-to for me when it comes to all things

02:55.400 --> 02:56.400
scyop COVID.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.120
The Scooby Doo, as you call it.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.720
Well, that's just really great to hear,

02:59.720 --> 03:02.400
because I don't get a lot of feedback about anyone

03:02.400 --> 03:02.920
hearing it.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.000
So to have someone who has a platform

03:06.000 --> 03:08.240
and is trying to get it out, also hearing it,

03:08.240 --> 03:11.600
this really makes me have a little hope.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.160
Yes, sir.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.200
Well, a lot of people are going to hear it today.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.600
And anybody in the chat, in the second hour,

03:16.600 --> 03:20.480
they could call in to, I'll hear the phone number, too.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.560
OK.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.240
All right, thanks a lot.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.720
And listen, I'll let you speak to the stream

03:26.720 --> 03:28.480
until we come up.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.960
You'll hear the bumper music.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.840
And I kind of let the bumper music play a little longer.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.280
People, that's just me.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.080
OK, it's no problem, you know?

03:38.080 --> 03:40.000
You just cue me in whenever.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.480
And otherwise, I'll just try it and remain

03:42.480 --> 03:44.400
a little quiet in the background.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.640
I assume you can control me on mute and stuff,

03:46.640 --> 03:49.440
so I won't worry about that.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.400
Well, unless your own is.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.120
But I don't hear any kind of anything

03:53.120 --> 03:55.040
in the background, even when you're talking now.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.480
So you probably could keep your microphone on.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.480
OK, I do change.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.960
I take my mute on and off when I'm not talking.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.040
But that's just because I'm walking around here,

04:05.040 --> 04:07.400
and there's a dog or whatever, sometimes.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.840
But I don't hear anything now.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.480
I think you probably could just leave it off.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.480
OK, OK.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.880
All right, thanks a lot.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
You bet.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.200
I guess we're all set.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.240
Thanks, Frank, how's Texas?

04:28.240 --> 04:32.760
I'll put the sound back in your ear when the ads start.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.720
OK.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.920
All right.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.360
Everything OK down in Austin, Frank?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.000
Oh, yeah, I'm raining a little bit.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.040
But it's not very cold, so.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.400
Wow.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
You're pretty good, you know.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.240
I appreciate you being there, man.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.960
And I think you'll really like what this guy had to say.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.520
He's very, very intelligent guy.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.080
I've learned a lot from him.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.000
You remember that Dermot, that Karen Devore I had on him?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.480
I mean, this guy, I think, yeah, I think he's

05:02.480 --> 05:04.040
like a level above that, I believe.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
He's a scientist guy.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.240
You know, he's really smart.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
Yeah.

05:07.240 --> 05:13.360
So that also leads me to the idea that I'm telling us

05:13.360 --> 05:18.440
what their plans are is they don't really care.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.400
So I can mute Skype.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.320
I didn't think about that.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.200
I'm kind of an idiot.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.640
So I muted Skype now.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.360
We can still hear them, but I'm not talking to them.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.040
I'm really, really excited that Tony is saying

05:39.040 --> 05:40.600
that he liked the show yesterday.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.040
When that idea came into my head as I was watching Fortnite,

05:44.040 --> 05:47.880
I thought, oh my gosh, this is such a good opportunity.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.080
It's such a giant opportunity to show people

05:51.080 --> 05:56.880
how this incremental step from chess to go to self-driving

05:56.880 --> 06:00.840
is still like this tiny little start of the race

06:00.840 --> 06:02.960
and all the way at the end of the marathon

06:02.960 --> 06:06.520
might be understanding a genome of a small animal

06:06.520 --> 06:07.280
or an insect.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.480
I mean, we are galaxies away from being

06:12.480 --> 06:16.960
able to usefully augment the genome of a human being.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.040
Never mind just the immune system.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.400
I mean, it's extraordinary where we are.

06:21.400 --> 06:26.560
And I really think that some of these technological claims

06:26.560 --> 06:28.920
that have been made by Elon Musk, especially

06:28.920 --> 06:32.640
with regard to AI and its potential uses, especially

06:32.640 --> 06:35.520
with regard to interacting with the brain,

06:35.520 --> 06:40.960
these are two places where they have really put themselves

06:40.960 --> 06:43.040
out on a limb with the claims that they've made

06:43.040 --> 06:44.080
and the things that they've said.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.960
And it becomes very easy to show them and show others

06:48.960 --> 06:54.480
that these people are way out on a limb of conjecture

06:54.480 --> 06:57.400
that has nothing to do with biology.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.680
And if you see that so clearly as those examples,

07:00.680 --> 07:03.400
then when you start to look at some

07:03.400 --> 07:05.840
of these more subtle examples, and you

07:05.840 --> 07:08.440
can see that they're actually also extended out

07:08.440 --> 07:09.840
onto a very narrow limb.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.040
But where they are in the canopy makes it harder

07:13.040 --> 07:16.280
to discern that they're really only on one limb.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.440
And all of these ideas that are around them

07:20.440 --> 07:23.400
seem to be supporting them, but in reality, they aren't.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.120
And that's how virology has been basically constructed.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.920
That's what that's the kind of work we have to do.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.320
We have to be able to teach our children that the illusion

07:33.320 --> 07:36.080
that there is a firm foundation underneath virology,

07:36.080 --> 07:39.200
especially RNA virology, that illusion has to be dispelled,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.560
just in the same way that we dispel

07:41.560 --> 07:44.320
the illusion of how great electric cars are

07:44.320 --> 07:50.760
and how easy it is to get batteries or how dangerous it is

07:50.760 --> 07:55.840
if they start on fire or how well the autopilot works.

07:55.840 --> 08:02.400
And you can't underestimate how important that is.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
This is the bumper music, I guess.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.200
Good morning, Mark and Maylin.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.600
How are you, Maylin?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.240
Tiny little nerd burglar.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.760
What would you say if I told you we have a new tool

08:27.760 --> 08:30.640
that will increase production and lower maintenance costs

08:30.640 --> 08:31.840
for your meat processing?

08:31.840 --> 08:34.840
What would you say if we had a new tool that would lower

08:34.840 --> 08:38.640
your maintenance costs of your meat production?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.440
Maybe I can do a voice thing, you know?

08:40.440 --> 08:43.240
Maybe that's a way to make some money.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.280
I need to get a voice thing for like Gatorade or something,

08:46.280 --> 08:47.280
though.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.760
Can you afford not to try the ease off?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.840
It installs fast with just three bolts

08:56.840 --> 08:58.440
in place of your current dropper.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.720
The effortless operation will reduce fatigue and injuries,

09:01.720 --> 09:03.840
speed up your line, eliminate downtime,

09:03.840 --> 09:05.320
and increase profit.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.080
How can I order my ease off?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.800
Go to easeoff.com, E-A-Z-E.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.920
Ease off, baby, this sounds great.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.320
Because we are offering $200 off on the new E-Z4

09:15.320 --> 09:17.840
for a limited time, easeoff.com.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.520
We make pigs fly.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.440
We make pigs fly, wow, that's fun.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.080
932-6419.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.720
You're listening to Republic Broadcasting Network,

09:29.720 --> 09:33.760
because you can handle the truth.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.640
That's awesome.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.480
Because you can handle the truth.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.880
You're listening to Republic Broadcasting Network.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.520
This is Jonathan Cooey coming to you live with Thought Crime

09:49.520 --> 09:52.400
radio and host, Stephen Whitener.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.520
This is the bumper music, I guess.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.000
All right, this is going to be fun.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.280
I am going to be a little bit limited, though.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.800
You understand, because I will be only talking.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.440
I don't get to draw a picture or show any pictures,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.840
which it'll be a little bit of a challenge.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.040
But maybe I'll still be drawing pictures for you.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
We'll see.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.560
No, I'm definitely muted.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.240
Is this Aussie?

10:37.240 --> 10:40.480
Sorry, I don't know this music, but it seems like it sounds

10:40.480 --> 10:43.760
like I should know it.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.040
Wow, doing a stream with coffee, that's a different flip.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.480
Don't go too deep, too fast.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.360
That's what she, I never mind.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.760
I won't make that joke.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.000
Yeah, that's what I thought, Aussie.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.720
McDuff lives is in the chat, hello.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.640
How do I rate with such a celebrity

11:16.680 --> 11:20.120
in the chat, Mark Hewson-Tonic and McDuff in the chat?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.160
This is a real party.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.360
All right.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.160
I guess he does let it play out for a little while,

11:32.160 --> 11:33.920
but that's all right, no problem, we wait.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.280
You guys should call in.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.720
It looks like there's a number there,

11:41.720 --> 11:45.480
1-800-724-2719 extension three.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.520
Donate by phone, oh no, that's not what we want.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.080
Where is the phone number?

11:52.080 --> 11:58.840
Listen live, comment on air, and this is at 5-1-2-2-4-8-8-2-5-2.

11:58.840 --> 12:05.640
And you can call toll-free at 8-100-1 or 3-1-3-9-4-4-3.

12:05.640 --> 12:15.840
To comment on air, dial 5-1-2-2-4-8-8-2-5-2 and toll-free at 1-800-3-1-3-9-4-4-3.

12:15.840 --> 12:20.600
That's got to be, I should be able to do some low-rent voice-overs.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
I mean, come on, right?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.120
I don't know, anyway.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.320
I got a mic to do it.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.640
Howdy, y'all.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.200
Here we go.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.320
Good morning.

12:29.320 --> 12:34.800
Man, masters of war, wage war by way of deception.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.920
Followed in this wage piece by way of the truth.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.880
Good morning, y'all.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.360
I'm Stephen Douglas Whitener, and you're

12:40.360 --> 12:42.560
listening to Republic Broadcasting Network

12:42.560 --> 12:45.560
at republicbroadcasting.org.

12:45.560 --> 12:52.120
And if you've been, it's February the 3rd, 2024.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.560
Roundhog Day was yesterday.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.240
I'm really thrilled to be here, y'all.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.800
I mean, RBN, it's a listener-supported platform.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.680
And I've been here about three years.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.000
If this is the first time you've listened to me,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.200
or the first time you've heard Thought Crime Live,

13:07.200 --> 13:11.720
I think we have some new folks joining today with my guest on the stream.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.480
I want to say hello to y'all, too.

13:13.560 --> 13:18.120
And there's also a chat that's Thought Crime Live,

13:18.120 --> 13:23.920
chattango.com, also, if you want to join us there.

13:23.920 --> 13:29.800
And if you can help RBN maintain this platform for free speech,

13:29.800 --> 13:32.520
you go to publicbroadcasting.org.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.040
There's a big yellow donate button there.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.480
One of our co-hosts says that you can just smash it with PayPal.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.440
And there's also a number that you can call,

13:42.440 --> 13:46.240
if you could set up a monthly donation with a credit or debit card.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.960
It's 800-724-2719, extension 3.

13:50.960 --> 13:55.720
That's 800-724-2719, extension 3.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.000
And I mean, and also with the thing happening with the truckers

13:59.000 --> 14:00.840
that happened up in Canada, too.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.680
And you want to remain anonymous, but still support free speech.

14:03.680 --> 14:08.520
You can mail a check payable to RBN or a money order,

14:08.520 --> 14:09.360
or just cash.

14:09.360 --> 14:13.120
I mailed some cash, which probably will be a crime one of these days,

14:13.120 --> 14:20.360
to 2251 Double Creek Drive, Suite 302, Round Rock, Texas, 78664.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.560
I'll give that one more time.

14:21.560 --> 14:29.000
2251 Double Creek Drive, Suite 302, Round Rock, Texas, 78664.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.480
And I just wanted to get that in.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.200
I'm really honored to be here.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.640
And I am excited about the guest I have.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.560
I have mentioned this gentleman's work before a paraphrase.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.560
I won't go say quoted.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.040
I've tried to paraphrase what he's had to say.

14:43.040 --> 14:50.440
I respect people who have blown the whistle.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.400
That just caused me.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.920
And it caused you to tell the truth sometimes.

14:55.920 --> 14:59.080
And this gentleman, he's a very smart guy.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.880
JJ, let me let you give your introduction.

15:01.880 --> 15:06.040
Tell folks who you are at gig on biological.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.400
Good morning, Steven.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.360
Thank you very much for having me on.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.040
I'm not normally talking this so early,

15:12.040 --> 15:15.800
so I really appreciate you getting me up and going.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.760
A lot of times for me, the hard thing

15:17.760 --> 15:21.480
is to hit the go button and go live.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.920
And so it's very nice to have an excuse to be up so early

15:23.920 --> 15:25.680
and doing it.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.640
My introduction can be very long,

15:27.640 --> 15:30.960
but I'll try to make it as short as possible.

15:30.960 --> 15:35.960
I'm a Wisconsin boy who moved to the big city of Chicago

15:35.960 --> 15:38.600
to go to university.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.840
And I lived in Chicago.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.760
Hold on one second.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.840
You need a problem there?

15:45.840 --> 15:46.720
No, I can't.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.800
I'm sorry, I'm alive.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
You've got to go out.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.600
Thank you though, honey.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.320
Shut the door.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.440
I got my boys on that.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.240
No problem.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.280
Yeah, exactly.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.440
Sorry about that.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.560
It's OK.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.040
RBN is listed and is used to that with me.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.360
It sounded like someone was shoeing horses one day.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.080
That's funny.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.240
So I am a Wisconsin boy.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.400
I moved to Chicago for university,

16:07.400 --> 16:10.720
and then I spent a number of years in Chicago

16:10.720 --> 16:12.640
as a young man kind of treading water,

16:12.640 --> 16:14.120
trying to figure out what I wanted to do.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.040
I went to university with the intention

16:16.040 --> 16:18.400
of going right to med school and becoming

16:18.400 --> 16:20.640
a big important doctor.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.680
And then I got waitlisted for a few years in a row.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.880
And at first, I started teaching high school

16:26.880 --> 16:29.400
as a way of treading water.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.680
And then that pay isn't very good.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.080
So I started bartending at night,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.280
and that pay is actually really good.

16:36.280 --> 16:40.840
And a couple years in a row, I decided just to bartend.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.680
And that, I don't know if that was the right thing for me

16:44.680 --> 16:47.800
to do at the time from anyone else's perspective.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.520
But I think from a sort of growing up,

16:50.520 --> 16:52.800
young man's perspective, it was really good for me

16:52.800 --> 16:57.640
to kind of hit a soft rock bottom with bartending

16:57.640 --> 17:01.480
and getting pretty cocky about how the money was coming in

17:01.480 --> 17:03.040
and whose money it was.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.440
And I rubbed the bar owner the wrong way

17:06.440 --> 17:08.440
by giving the keys to the wrong person

17:08.440 --> 17:11.000
and just casually taking a day off.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.080
And I got fired.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.520
And it's pretty hard, in retrospect,

17:14.520 --> 17:17.840
to come upon a bar gig like I had,

17:17.840 --> 17:19.600
where I was working three nights a week

17:19.600 --> 17:21.520
and making enough money and more.

17:21.520 --> 17:25.200
And so finding another gig like that in Chicago wasn't easy.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.640
And I was forced to kind of panic.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.360
And I got a technician job at the University of Chicago

17:31.360 --> 17:33.440
that reminded me that I had been a biologist

17:33.440 --> 17:36.120
since I was a little kid and that I needed to do something

17:36.120 --> 17:39.440
more than mixed drinks and entertain people.

17:39.440 --> 17:43.040
And so I started working with this guy

17:43.040 --> 17:45.560
at the University of Pittsburgh, sorry, sorry,

17:45.560 --> 17:50.120
University of Chicago who taught me a couple techniques

17:50.120 --> 17:53.680
that allowed me to move to the Netherlands,

17:53.680 --> 17:57.440
do my PhD in the Netherlands, meet my wife in Amsterdam

17:57.440 --> 17:59.320
and then move together with her to Norway

17:59.320 --> 18:04.240
where I continued my training in a laboratory there in Toronto.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.400
And we had a couple boys in Norway

18:06.400 --> 18:07.920
and then we moved back to the Netherlands

18:07.920 --> 18:10.320
with every intention of getting tenure there

18:10.320 --> 18:13.880
and settling down in the Netherlands where her family is.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.920
And I didn't get tenure.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.560
I mean, I got some EU money in my first couple years there

18:19.560 --> 18:22.960
and then I just couldn't get anything to work sustainably.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.680
And so after four years in the Netherlands,

18:25.680 --> 18:29.360
we had no choice really because my wife had also gotten a PhD

18:29.360 --> 18:33.040
in plant biology, but we did not pursue her career.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.040
She didn't really enjoy it.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.200
She just finished her degree to finish it.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.640
And so we moved to America because that's where I had my,

18:39.640 --> 18:42.800
you know, previous, you know, my whole life was here.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.480
And we moved to the University of Pittsburgh.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.040
I'd never lived or been to Pittsburgh before.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.280
I flew here and it's a beautiful little town

18:49.280 --> 18:51.680
with lots of trees and hills and water.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.880
And so from the air, it was just like,

18:53.880 --> 18:55.440
wow, Pittsburgh is like this.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.480
I have to admit, I grew up in Wisconsin.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.800
I'm a Packer fan.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.520
And when I was a child, the Steelers were winning the Super Bowls

19:02.520 --> 19:07.160
and everybody hated Lin Swan and Terry Bradshaw.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.200
So I never liked Pittsburgh.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.640
I never wanted to like Pittsburgh.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.320
And so coming here was a little weird

19:12.320 --> 19:14.200
because I also didn't like the Pirates

19:14.200 --> 19:16.120
because I'm a Cubs fan.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.920
And so it was a real strange place to be so attracted to.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.400
I had a couple of three good years

19:22.400 --> 19:24.320
at the University of Pittsburgh,

19:24.320 --> 19:26.800
trying to keep my career going.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.160
And when the pandemic broke out,

19:30.160 --> 19:31.680
I was already working on,

19:31.680 --> 19:34.760
serendipitously, a bike ride series

19:34.760 --> 19:37.800
where I was doing Journal Club for neurobiologists

19:37.800 --> 19:41.760
on my bicycle, on my way back or on my way to work.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.080
And I had an electric assist bike.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.760
So it allows you to get exercise,

19:45.760 --> 19:49.680
but still cover like 15 or 20 miles without killing yourself.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.680
And so I could talk on my bike while I was riding

19:52.680 --> 19:54.800
and it was a really cool little show

19:54.800 --> 19:56.440
that when the pandemic broke out,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.200
I just did a couple bike rides

19:58.200 --> 20:01.600
where I did a coronavirus biology review.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.240
And at some moment in 2020,

20:05.240 --> 20:10.240
I got an email from the administrative offices

20:11.200 --> 20:16.200
of the media department of the hospital

20:17.000 --> 20:19.200
that is attached to the University of Pittsburgh.

20:19.200 --> 20:24.200
The universe, it would be the UPMC medical system.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.320
And she said that the Pittsburgh Gazette

20:27.320 --> 20:29.600
had contacted me for an interview,

20:29.600 --> 20:31.920
but they informed the Pittsburgh Gazette

20:31.920 --> 20:34.920
that my expertise was not virology

20:34.920 --> 20:37.280
and I was not to speak to them,

20:37.280 --> 20:39.520
even if they contacted me directly.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.200
They said they saw my YouTube channel

20:41.200 --> 20:44.000
and they said, okay, at the end of this email

20:44.000 --> 20:46.200
with a question mark, which I found bizarre.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.440
And a few months later, my immediate supervisor asked me

20:49.440 --> 20:50.440
not to come in anymore

20:50.440 --> 20:53.160
because I wasn't getting my temperature taken

20:53.160 --> 20:56.280
and I wasn't putting a sticker on my ID every day.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.200
And I was also getting an arguments

20:58.200 --> 20:59.760
with people about whether you could read

20:59.760 --> 21:03.360
about legitimate science in the New York Times or not.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.800
Anyway, it just so happens

21:05.800 --> 21:07.160
that the University of Pittsburgh

21:07.160 --> 21:09.440
had just extended my contract in July

21:09.440 --> 21:10.920
when they sent me home in October.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.080
So that meant I had like eight months.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.720
And so during that eight months,

21:14.720 --> 21:17.480
I just kept teaching immunology online

21:17.480 --> 21:19.360
and that got me enough followers

21:19.360 --> 21:21.920
to keep doing it for the whole year.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.760
And then early in 2022, I got a phone call

21:24.760 --> 21:27.840
from some guy by the name of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.360
And he asked me to help consult on a book

21:30.360 --> 21:32.080
that he released a couple months ago

21:32.080 --> 21:33.720
called The Wuhan Cover Up.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.480
And some of the biology that I teach every night

21:36.480 --> 21:37.680
is definitely in that book.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.120
And there's some quotes in there from me,

21:39.120 --> 21:41.080
which is kind of fun.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.240
And then for a brief period of time

21:43.240 --> 21:44.680
for about six months after the book,

21:44.680 --> 21:46.240
I worked for Children's Health Defense,

21:46.240 --> 21:48.680
but my, and that's the nonprofit

21:48.680 --> 21:50.880
that Bobby used to be the spokesperson for.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.440
And that didn't really work out apparently

21:54.440 --> 21:58.960
because what I do on my stream is still too raw.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.800
And when I bumped into the management

22:01.800 --> 22:03.400
a number of times about what I was saying

22:03.400 --> 22:07.560
and eventually to my own surprise, to be quite honest,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.480
my whole family was taken by surprise by it on January 4th.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.120
They just decided to lay me off.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.400
So we're back again shaking a can on the internet,

22:14.400 --> 22:18.040
but we have a good little core of followers.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.920
And I know from my previous years of doing this

22:21.920 --> 22:23.080
that I think it's pretty important.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.520
So we're going to try and keep it going.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.920
I apologize for that extremely long introduction,

22:26.920 --> 22:28.440
but it is kind of a,

22:28.440 --> 22:30.120
it's kind of an interesting thing to hear

22:30.120 --> 22:34.160
because it's so serendipitous that I find myself here.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.120
It's not. Yes.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.960
You definitely qualify as a thought criminal, sir.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.120
I mean, to interrupt you,

22:40.120 --> 22:43.520
but that definitely established your bona fides there.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.920
You know, it's, and I've learned from you too.

22:45.920 --> 22:49.520
I looked, the listeners may be aware

22:49.520 --> 22:51.080
of some of the things that you talk about,

22:51.080 --> 22:52.920
but you, you bring it together.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.000
The word transfection that you use,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.760
I think needs to be used more.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.800
We need to spread a lot of this information far and wide.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.920
You know, RBN listeners spread RBN too,

23:04.920 --> 23:09.840
but you know, I see how you say that the battle is for our kids.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.080
Let me let you get back to that

23:11.080 --> 23:15.320
because what you have to say is even more important than that.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.560
But I'm glad you did that because, you know,

23:17.560 --> 23:21.520
I don't know that everybody would know.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.400
You know, I do believe what you say in is sincere.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.760
Okay, I've not met you personally

23:25.760 --> 23:27.480
as I have some of my guests and all,

23:27.480 --> 23:29.960
but I have followed you and do trust

23:29.960 --> 23:32.320
what you say to be sincere.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.600
Well, I mean, that's really, I really appreciate that,

23:35.600 --> 23:38.720
but I also want to emphasize to everybody that's listening

23:38.720 --> 23:43.680
that one of the core messages

23:43.680 --> 23:46.120
that I try to put out every day is that we all,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.920
as adults, have to take responsibility for learning this.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.360
It can't be something where, you know,

23:51.360 --> 23:53.600
we have a friend that knows about used cars,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.880
and so we're just gonna rely on our friend

23:55.920 --> 23:58.240
to help us buy a used car or whatever.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.880
We've got to really learn this biology ourselves

24:00.880 --> 24:03.840
because it is who we are and it is who our kids are.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.960
And if we don't impart this understanding

24:06.960 --> 24:09.760
of what is sacred to our children,

24:09.760 --> 24:12.160
then they're gonna grow up believing whatever the TV

24:12.160 --> 24:14.960
and social media, which is even worse, tells them.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.360
And that's, I think, the other transition point

24:17.360 --> 24:19.240
that I'm, you know, as a biologist,

24:19.240 --> 24:21.560
it seems kind of weird to emphasize this all the time,

24:21.560 --> 24:25.920
but we are, you and I, I think, I'm 52,

24:25.920 --> 24:29.240
we are a generation that can understand

24:29.240 --> 24:30.680
the transition that we're at,

24:30.680 --> 24:33.440
because we grew up at a time where kids would be bored

24:33.440 --> 24:34.920
and then get in trouble outside.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.080
We were a generation that the solution was,

24:38.080 --> 24:42.040
get out of the house, don't come back and tell dinner.

24:42.040 --> 24:46.080
And that kind of growing up with boredom

24:46.080 --> 24:49.120
that you yourself are responsible for filling,

24:49.160 --> 24:51.800
something that I see in my kids all the time,

24:51.800 --> 24:54.120
they don't experience it because they have a number

24:54.120 --> 24:58.520
of place fillers that are ready and waiting

24:58.520 --> 25:00.240
so that they never have that problem.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.560
And when we were kids, that would have been like

25:02.560 --> 25:05.920
daydreaming, watching TV, but it's much worse now

25:05.920 --> 25:08.680
because they're putting short,

25:08.680 --> 25:10.960
sometimes malevolent thoughts in their heads.

25:10.960 --> 25:15.120
And that includes these ideas about scary biological

25:15.120 --> 25:17.600
phenomenon that probably don't exist

25:17.600 --> 25:20.720
in order to govern the globe.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.720
And so my main message,

25:22.720 --> 25:25.880
and I think that's what you're trying to get me to spit out here,

25:25.880 --> 25:30.200
is that as a biologist, I walked into the pandemic

25:30.200 --> 25:35.040
thinking that vaccinations in general were a good idea.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.000
And that maybe the United States applied

25:38.000 --> 25:41.920
some of these vaccinations too early or too often,

25:41.960 --> 25:45.320
but I had not yet evolved my thinking to the stage

25:45.320 --> 25:47.120
where I was considering the possibility

25:47.120 --> 25:50.000
that they could just be wholly unnecessary

25:50.000 --> 25:54.120
or that they are being applied in a criminally negligent way.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.600
But when the pandemic came around

25:56.600 --> 25:58.760
and they started saying that they were gonna use

25:58.760 --> 26:01.640
this technology called transfection to immunize,

26:01.640 --> 26:05.120
old people, I immediately saw that they were also

26:05.120 --> 26:07.800
eventually going to, they were thinking

26:07.800 --> 26:10.440
that they were going to immunize everybody this way,

26:10.440 --> 26:12.440
it started to really upset me

26:12.440 --> 26:14.520
because I have been using transfection

26:14.520 --> 26:19.200
for between 10 and 15 years in my own work on mice.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.960
I understand what it's meant to do,

26:20.960 --> 26:23.640
but I also understand that there are tremendous limitations

26:23.640 --> 26:27.800
to trying to do these kinds of things in a living system.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.920
And so unlike all the work that I've ever done

26:30.920 --> 26:35.640
where part of the built-in plan is to sacrifice the animal

26:35.640 --> 26:40.080
in order to accurately describe the anatomy

26:40.120 --> 26:42.480
of the locations that you recorded from

26:42.480 --> 26:44.520
or the cells that you modified,

26:44.520 --> 26:47.200
we don't plan to do any of those things

26:47.200 --> 26:50.440
with an old person or a young person that we transfect,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.720
we want them to live a long, healthy life.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.280
And that's not something that anybody

26:55.280 --> 26:57.960
in my neck of the woods when using transfection

26:57.960 --> 27:00.040
ever had as an expectation.

29:40.080 --> 30:03.440
I'm with the barrel, healthy meats that have planes like natural

30:03.440 --> 30:05.880
or free range or even cage free in terms

30:05.880 --> 30:08.760
that were actually created by the industrial food industry

30:08.760 --> 30:10.480
to make us feel all warm and fuzzy

30:10.480 --> 30:13.040
about buying the low-quality products.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.640
I'm talking about truly nourishing pasteurized meats,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.640
the kind that you'll never really find in a grocery store.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.560
Our farmers are doing things beyond organic.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.280
Our beef is 100% grass-fed and grass-finished

30:26.280 --> 30:27.600
and raised on pasture-free food.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.200
I'm working on that, Jeffrey.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.600
Trust me, that's part of the whole clone thing

30:31.600 --> 30:35.640
that I'm trying to really, I got to nail it all the way down

30:35.640 --> 30:36.840
before I start doing it.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.800
Because this is the end of that.

30:39.800 --> 30:43.440
That whole argument about clones and RNA fidelity

30:43.440 --> 30:46.160
could potentially end a lot of this discussion

30:46.160 --> 30:51.800
and unite the disparate positions on no virus together in one.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.200
So we got to do it right, but I'm definitely working on it, Jeffrey.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
Good to see you.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.440
You hear about where your food comes from

30:56.440 --> 30:59.240
and you have definitely made it to the right place.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.640
As a wild casters member, you'll be supporting

31:01.640 --> 31:04.480
the most highly principled farmers in America

31:04.480 --> 31:06.480
and getting the most nutrient-dense,

31:06.480 --> 31:09.120
nourishing and sustainable meats in the world.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.320
Psychedelic beef.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.720
That's what the music sounds like.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.720
Interesting news.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.800
Due to all the recent claims about possible nuclear wars,

31:39.800 --> 31:42.520
viruses, solar flares, and civil unrest,

31:42.520 --> 31:45.440
people are scrambling to prepare and stockpile food.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.240
But the one thing out of reach for a minute

31:47.240 --> 31:48.240
is an underground bunker.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.240
I'm going to get my re-print.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.080
Until now.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.440
Because you can now have a 3D-printed underground bunker

31:53.440 --> 31:55.040
in just one day.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.320
Unexcovator digs a hole in your backyard,

31:57.320 --> 32:00.720
and 3dbonkers.com shows up in a small truck

32:00.720 --> 32:03.200
and sets up their 3D printer under a tent

32:03.200 --> 32:04.840
completely on the tent.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.920
They can print as many rooms as you want

32:06.920 --> 32:08.080
and a fraction of the cost

32:08.080 --> 32:10.160
compared to traditional metal bunkers.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.520
3dbonkers uses polymer concrete,

32:12.520 --> 32:14.120
which is five times stronger.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.120
3dbonkers uses concrete.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.120
Hello, welcome.

3dbonkers is looking for a business partner

32:21.960 --> 32:24.400
that can help bring this technology into the world

32:24.400 --> 32:26.320
as we need to protect our way of life

32:26.320 --> 32:29.040

A bunker will not save you from this shit.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.160
And welcome back, y'all.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.320
You're listening to Thought Crime Live

33:10.320 --> 33:12.240
on Republic Broadcasting Network.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.520
And I'm joined by Jonathan Kui, JJ Kui,

33:16.520 --> 33:20.200
of giga-arm-biological.com.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.640
And, you know, as a kid, I wanted to have chemistry set

33:23.640 --> 33:24.680
when I was six years old.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.080
I remember when I looked at science

33:27.080 --> 33:29.080
as to something that would elucidate

33:29.080 --> 33:30.600
what was the sacred biology.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.160
Now, since it's been Frankenstein since then, you know,

33:33.160 --> 33:34.920
when I, the more I learned,

33:34.920 --> 33:37.120
it just, let me let you go back to you.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.440
I just relate so much to what you say, sir.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.280
Well, that's very nice.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.280
I guess you just kind of triggered in me something.

33:46.280 --> 33:50.360
I just did a show yesterday, which I think

33:50.360 --> 33:52.560
can bring a bigger picture idea

33:52.560 --> 33:55.160
to the forefront a little bit

33:55.160 --> 33:57.960
in terms of how they've convinced these people

33:57.960 --> 33:59.440
to participate in this.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.400
And one of the things that I think needs to be made clear

34:02.400 --> 34:04.760
to the, again, we're talking to college age kids.

34:04.760 --> 34:08.920
We're talking to young kids whose teachers

34:08.920 --> 34:11.000
in their schools are probably a little confused

34:11.000 --> 34:12.440
about this as well.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.360
But we need everybody to understand

34:14.360 --> 34:18.600
that artificial intelligence is being hyped

34:18.600 --> 34:20.760
as something with potential very much

34:20.760 --> 34:23.120
in the same way that genetic therapies

34:23.120 --> 34:25.320
were hyped in the 80s.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.400
There's a really interesting sort of anecdote

34:27.400 --> 34:31.160
that I can tell you of a guy by the name of Robert Malone

34:31.160 --> 34:33.000
who was cutting his teeth

34:33.000 --> 34:35.560
in some of the most important virology labs

34:35.560 --> 34:38.120
and surrounded by some of the most important virologists

34:38.120 --> 34:39.960
in the late 70s, early 80s

34:41.400 --> 34:44.440
in his graduate school work.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.960
And during his grad school work,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.920
he had the choice of working with some of the,

34:49.920 --> 34:53.920
at the time, preeminent biologists from Murray Gardner

34:53.920 --> 34:58.920
to Robert Gallo to even to somebody like David Baltimore.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.000
And so all of these, you know,

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
grandfathers of modern virology circulating as a postdoc then

35:07.520 --> 35:10.800
convinced him that in 10 or 15 years

35:10.800 --> 35:13.680
that virology was going to progress at such a pace

35:13.680 --> 35:15.440
and our understanding of the genome

35:15.440 --> 35:17.400
was gonna progress at such a pace

35:17.400 --> 35:21.360
that there would be genealogists or geneticists

35:21.360 --> 35:24.640
that were using retroviruses to cure childhood diseases

35:24.640 --> 35:29.520
in every local hospital in the nation in a few years.

35:29.520 --> 35:33.240
And so what we need to understand as adults

35:33.240 --> 35:36.680
that we can partake or impart on our children

35:36.680 --> 35:39.560
is that these stories of what was about to happen

35:39.560 --> 35:41.800
when we understood the genome better

35:41.800 --> 35:43.880
or when we had faster computers

35:43.880 --> 35:45.440
or when we collected enough data

35:45.440 --> 35:49.280
that we were finally going to be able to crack the code,

35:49.280 --> 35:52.120
so to speak, they've used that phrase a lot

35:52.120 --> 35:55.840
to imply that we're going to be able to see the blueprints

35:55.840 --> 35:59.080
and the instruction manual of life.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.800
And once we do that, we won't need God anymore

36:01.800 --> 36:04.400
or God will be irrelevant or we'll finally have proven

36:04.400 --> 36:07.520
that God doesn't exist because we will have attained

36:07.520 --> 36:10.120
this transhuman mastery of ourselves.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.680
This story, Steve, has been told for decades,

36:13.680 --> 36:17.640
especially in secret meetings and in meetings

36:17.640 --> 36:21.280
of secret societies and meetings of really rich people

36:21.280 --> 36:24.840
at very expensive dinners talking about their plans

36:24.840 --> 36:28.680
for how they're going to govern the world.

36:28.680 --> 36:33.600
This mythology about how eventually if we collect enough data,

36:33.600 --> 36:36.240
there will be enough numbers, enough measurements

36:36.240 --> 36:38.680
that an AI will be able to take that data

36:38.680 --> 36:40.800
and convert it into understanding.

36:40.800 --> 36:46.680
That has been sort of belied by the progress

36:46.680 --> 36:49.080
of understanding chess versus understanding

36:49.080 --> 36:52.200
the Chinese game Go versus understanding now.

36:52.200 --> 36:56.160
The example that I used yesterday in my show was the success

36:56.160 --> 37:00.400
or lack of success of the autopilot in Tesla.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.520
And one of the things that I think is now becoming more

37:04.520 --> 37:08.080
and more especially obvious with regard to Elon Musk

37:08.080 --> 37:11.080
and some of the things that he claims is very similar

37:11.080 --> 37:14.400
to how all of those virologists, Bamboozled Robert Malone

37:14.400 --> 37:17.680
when he was a young guy so long ago into believing

37:17.680 --> 37:19.880
that genetic technologies were going to evolve

37:19.880 --> 37:22.680
at light speed and that within 10 years there would be

37:22.680 --> 37:24.960
a geneticist that could fix childhood diseases

37:24.960 --> 37:28.120
using retroviruses, they are bamboozling us

37:28.120 --> 37:31.160
into believing that eventually with enough cores

37:31.160 --> 37:33.840
or with enough time or with enough data,

37:33.840 --> 37:36.800
artificial intelligence is going to be able to do things

37:36.800 --> 37:39.720
that heretofore were considered impossible

37:39.720 --> 37:41.880
or at least borderline magic.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.480
And I really can't emphasize enough how even

37:45.480 --> 37:51.480
if this is a future possibility, we are not scratching

37:51.480 --> 37:53.960
that surface of that future possibility yet

37:53.960 --> 37:58.320
and that these people are actually enchanting our children

37:58.320 --> 38:01.240
with this idea that AI is so powerful,

38:01.240 --> 38:02.800
you might as well go limp.

38:02.800 --> 38:06.560
AI is so amazing that you might as well forget about it

38:06.560 --> 38:09.120
that everything that you're going to do and learn

38:09.120 --> 38:12.520
in the future is going to be better than done better by AI

38:12.520 --> 38:14.800
so there's no reason for you to learn to draw,

38:14.800 --> 38:16.520
there's no reason for you to learn to paint,

38:16.520 --> 38:18.520
there's no reason for you to make music,

38:18.520 --> 38:20.280
there's no reason for you to be creative,

38:20.280 --> 38:24.040
you have been relegated to basically nothing

38:24.040 --> 38:25.840
and that we have to break it.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.680
Yes.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.800
Bottom of the hour break.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.280
Thanks JJ, that's terrific.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.520
Oops, I don't know how this is working

38:35.560 --> 38:40.520
so we're just playing along, trying to give them a sound bite.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.520
I don't know if this is working or not.

38:56.520 --> 38:58.120
It's very interesting to do it this way,

38:58.120 --> 39:00.960
I don't know what to say other than it's very interesting.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.520
We've got a song and then we're probably going

39:02.520 --> 39:07.160
to have another thing.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.320
How do I do that where I get that off?

39:10.320 --> 39:14.120
So I have to turn that one off better.

39:14.120 --> 39:17.920
We're going to have another rock and roll.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.720
Test, test, test, test, test, test.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.400
You are tuned in for the Republic Broadcasting

39:24.400 --> 39:31.080
Tesla, this is our website by going to republicbroadcasting.org.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.720
Yeah, I wouldn't be licensed to have a,

39:32.720 --> 39:35.600
I would like to have a flashing light.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.600
People often write to tell us what has happened for them

39:38.600 --> 39:40.720
since starting Extendivite.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.560
Allow me to read one.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.880
This product has been a godsend for my father,

39:44.880 --> 39:47.680
who suffered from a heart attack about two years ago.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.480
He was prescribed medications for him.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.240
So you're saying I need to start a talk radio show or what?

39:52.240 --> 39:55.160
He almost died, but he has to be able to afford

39:55.160 --> 39:56.880
most of the medications.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.280
After researching alternatives, I have to talk to Ted.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.200
Maybe Ted can hook up some kind of live audio only on my website.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.040
That would actually be really Ted.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.280
If you are there, that's actually a really good idea.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.560
Maybe we could just have like a stream that's audio only.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.440
And I'm grateful that it is available.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.960
I don't know how I would send that out.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.080
Maybe there's a, let me see if I can do that.

40:17.080 --> 40:21.480
9288822 or visit Extendivite.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.640
So I got nine minutes.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.640
Nine minutes.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.320
I'll set my little thing here.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.840
It's at my little thingy here.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.760
It's at your life.

40:31.760 --> 40:36.520
We can't go by.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.160
Are you sick of censorship?

40:38.160 --> 40:38.680
T.R.U.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.080
Sick of censorship.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.800
D.L.B. stands for truth, liberty, and balance.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.760
We are the newest and most unique social media.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.760
Is your name, Bill of Betancourt?

40:46.760 --> 40:49.640
Have you written a blog that's made people angry?

40:49.640 --> 40:52.040
Then call now 1-800.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.880
All my blog makes people angry, but people are united.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.520
With that vision, T.L.B.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.680
Talk was born.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.040
Our battlefield is in cyberspace.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.240
The battle we're in can be won by clicks of buttons

41:04.240 --> 41:05.600
and voting with your wealth.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.120
T.L.B. Talk has no hidden agendas, no corporate funding.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.000
And we do not sell, trade, or give away

41:12.000 --> 41:14.200
any of your information.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.680
Our platform runs off of generous donations

41:16.680 --> 41:18.840
of members and merchandise profits.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.840
So please check out our site.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.360
It's the best around.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.520
And be sure to stop by our store.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.000
It's loaded with items that'll have you feeling

41:27.000 --> 41:29.360
a sense of member pride and victory.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.040
It seems like a flying by my seat of the pants kind of deal.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.720
He's not asking any questions, so I

41:33.720 --> 41:35.840
would like it to be giving me a little direction, but it's

41:35.840 --> 41:36.840
all right.

41:36.840 --> 41:39.840
Hi, Tom Bolton.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.000
Oh, that was a pig.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.360
I know so many of you are finding our easy four carcass drop

41:44.360 --> 41:47.080
and lift, an essential tool for your meat processing

41:47.080 --> 41:47.720
operation.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.480
The carcass drop and lift.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.640
Wow, that's some weird weird.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.920
First, our right height, weird advertisement.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.040
Steel or aluminum frames.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.640
Our customers love this back-saving innovation

41:58.640 --> 42:02.240
that enhances sanitation and speeds production.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.480
Next, our beef cradles with stainless steel or aluminum

42:05.480 --> 42:08.120
frames eliminate rust and corrosion.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.480
We hope you'll compare our quality and prices

42:10.480 --> 42:13.640
for this essential part of your processing line.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.760
Our cradles are especially effective when

42:15.760 --> 42:17.680
used with our power skinner.

42:17.720 --> 42:20.880
And finally, our hook tumbler will keep your hooks clean

42:20.880 --> 42:21.960
and polished.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.080
Esauff.com.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.720
I actually have a good transition now,

42:25.720 --> 42:28.160
so hopefully he'll just hand it off to me one more time.

42:28.160 --> 42:28.600
Tails 2.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.000
Esauff, LLC.

42:30.000 --> 42:30.840
You've got to write that down.

42:30.840 --> 42:35.280
417 932 6419.

43:05.280 --> 43:28.240
I can just do a confession right now.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.720
I wouldn't be good enough to pick up my guitar and play

43:30.720 --> 43:32.200
with this.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.200
It would take me a while, and I would look like a fool.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.120
So don't think that that guitar is back there

43:36.120 --> 43:38.520
for any other reason than to admit that I'm a beginner.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.920
I've always been a beginner.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.840
I appreciate you joining me today.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.040
I have.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.440
It is Dr. Cooey, though, isn't it, John?

43:47.440 --> 43:51.360
I mean, I just have to say that I wanted the listeners to.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.520
Yeah, you are.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.080
You're Dr. Cooey, too, right?

43:54.080 --> 43:56.680
I mean, you're a research scientist.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.160
I think you might be a humble one.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.680
That's a rare thing.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.320
I am a PhD.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.880
I don't say doctor because I feel like a lot of people get

44:04.880 --> 44:07.680
confused, and I think it's better if you're a PhD to just say

44:07.680 --> 44:10.600
Mr. And not confused anyone.

44:10.600 --> 44:15.400
You know, like Mrs. Biden is also a PhD,

44:15.400 --> 44:17.440
but she calls herself Dr. Biden all the time.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.560
And I feel like that's really disingenuous.

44:19.560 --> 44:23.080
She confuses everybody with that.

44:23.080 --> 44:23.720
But you can.

44:23.720 --> 44:24.960
You can look me up on PubMed.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.400
You can look me up on PubMed.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.440
The listeners know that, yes or go ahead.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.600
Yeah, you can look me up on PubMed, though.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.760
And you can find that I've been a legitimate academician.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.840
I usually call them nowadays.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.040
For a very long time, I was going for tenure.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.720
I wanted to be a professor.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.000
That was my goal.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.520
And I did really enjoy that job.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.720
I do really enjoy it.

44:46.720 --> 44:50.520
Because as a professor, as a research professor,

44:50.520 --> 44:52.600
one of the things that's involved in that

44:52.600 --> 44:53.720
is having apprentices.

44:53.720 --> 44:56.600
And the grad students that come work with you,

44:56.600 --> 44:57.800
they call them grad students.

44:57.800 --> 44:59.400
But what they really are are apprentices.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.880
And you're teaching them basically

45:00.880 --> 45:03.560
to learn how to write grants, learn

45:03.560 --> 45:05.680
how to formulate experiments that get funded,

45:05.680 --> 45:08.760
and learn how to do the experiments that get funded.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.960
Now, I could do the experiments, and other people

45:10.960 --> 45:13.360
could write, but I couldn't combine those two.

45:13.360 --> 45:15.400
And so that's why I didn't really succeed.

45:15.400 --> 45:18.960
But part of the reason why I think I didn't succeed

45:18.960 --> 45:22.360
is because I didn't really understand how the sausage was

45:22.360 --> 45:23.160
made.

45:23.160 --> 45:25.600
And the way the sausage is made is how

45:25.600 --> 45:28.360
you can extend the answering of the same question

45:28.360 --> 45:31.040
over several years or several projects.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.560
And it's not to say that these people

45:32.560 --> 45:37.440
do it with disingenuous or malevolent ideas in mind.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.160
But they've come to understand that's how the system works.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.640
The grant proposal NIH system is not

45:43.640 --> 45:46.720
designed to solve problems and then move on.

45:46.720 --> 45:52.160
It's designed to sort of explore a possibility space.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.200
And even when the possibility space

45:54.200 --> 45:57.720
has now been exhausted, oftentimes

45:57.720 --> 46:00.920
the funding mechanism is set up in such a way

46:00.920 --> 46:05.400
that all of the people that are dependent on that funding

46:05.400 --> 46:08.760
mechanism are unwilling to admit that the question has

46:08.760 --> 46:09.800
been answered.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.560
And so the funding will not be removed from them

46:12.560 --> 46:14.720
because it requires the funding.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.680
In order for the funding to move on,

46:17.680 --> 46:20.200
those people have to agree collectively

46:20.200 --> 46:21.560
that that question has been answered.

46:21.560 --> 46:26.160
And so you get this incredible inertia in academia

46:26.160 --> 46:29.000
where the same question gets asked many, many times

46:29.000 --> 46:30.480
by many, many people.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.840
And you might think that that results in thoroughness,

46:32.840 --> 46:36.040
but in a malevolent system where you

46:36.040 --> 46:40.280
have pharmaceutical companies and other weaponized piles

46:40.280 --> 46:43.800
of money influencing that, you can get a lot of dead space

46:43.800 --> 46:47.840
in academia where the same bad ideas are pursued for decades.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.200
And that's where you get statins.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.600
That's where you get all these bad cancer treatments.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.680
That's where you get billions of dollars thrown into the wind

46:54.680 --> 46:57.720
when we know that there are certain good ideas that

46:57.720 --> 46:58.560
should be pursued.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.800
But then you'd have billions of dollars

47:00.800 --> 47:03.120
in lots of people out of work or lots of people

47:03.120 --> 47:05.480
having to shift their whole paradigm.

47:05.480 --> 47:07.440
And that might even include the money

47:07.440 --> 47:09.840
that they're making with the products that they sell.

47:09.840 --> 47:14.000
And so this is really a spectacular time

47:14.000 --> 47:17.360
because it took me getting kicked out of that moving truck

47:17.360 --> 47:19.520
where I was like, but I really like my job

47:19.520 --> 47:20.480
and I'm really good at it.

47:20.480 --> 47:21.920
Why would you throw me out?

47:21.920 --> 47:24.040
And I just couldn't understand it.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.400
I had, it took me a long time to realize

47:27.400 --> 47:31.400
that I was not, I was never gonna be let back in.

47:31.400 --> 47:33.640
I really thought at some point they were gonna come around

47:33.640 --> 47:34.840
and they were gonna see I was right

47:34.840 --> 47:36.360
and I would be back to neurobiology

47:36.360 --> 47:37.680
and everything would be great.

47:37.680 --> 47:40.360
And I, it took me a long time to accept

47:40.360 --> 47:44.520
that what I was doing was gonna permanently ostracize me.

47:44.520 --> 47:46.880
And it's probably how you felt all those years ago

47:46.880 --> 47:48.640
when you spoke out that you thought you were doing

47:48.640 --> 47:50.440
the right thing and that people would listen

47:50.440 --> 47:52.560
and that these problems would get fixed.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.400
And instead it's like, no.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.480
And in fact, it's worse than that.

47:56.480 --> 48:01.480
You have essentially admitted that you will not play.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.880
And it's since you're not gonna play, you gotta go.

48:04.880 --> 48:06.520
So that's where I found myself.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.360
I've been there in a way just,

48:10.360 --> 48:12.640
but that was, you know, with the Aqua Tech thing,

48:12.640 --> 48:16.760
but it just, I, it beat me down for so many years

48:16.760 --> 48:19.640
it's only when I started to talk back again

48:19.640 --> 48:23.920
to stand up that I started to change myself a little bit.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.160
That's, that's where the real battle took place.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.280
And like, I think that the most important battle after that

48:29.280 --> 48:31.720
is just as you were pointing out with our kids,

48:31.720 --> 48:35.360
you talk of college age kids too, but I mean, public school,

48:35.360 --> 48:38.640
public indoctrination systems are just,

48:38.640 --> 48:40.320
they're, that's weaponized too.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.640
That's such a trauma-based mind control thing

48:43.640 --> 48:45.440
they were doing there with the masks

48:45.760 --> 48:48.120
and it looks like they look like little prisons now to me

48:48.120 --> 48:49.280
when I got, when I was going.

48:49.280 --> 48:53.440
It just, that's a different subject, but let me,

48:53.440 --> 48:57.200
you said that you followed the way this illusion

48:57.200 --> 49:02.200
of consensus was created to sell that a pathogen

49:02.360 --> 49:04.080
made its way around and around the world.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.320
And that's not true.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.440
That just, the data doesn't back that up at all.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.520
And you wanna just start with there,

49:10.520 --> 49:13.040
cause if anybody, I can hear people saying,

49:13.120 --> 49:15.680
well, I tested positive for this and then you know,

49:15.680 --> 49:19.080
it's like, oh, I just, I have to step away from that

49:19.080 --> 49:20.760
and not even pay any attention to it.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.880
And those tests are just worthless to me.

49:22.880 --> 49:26.520
Why, I don't care what that rapid COVID test says.

49:26.520 --> 49:28.680
Who, you know, that's irrelevant to me.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.520
To me, that's a weapon used against us

49:30.520 --> 49:32.240
and I just don't have anything to do with it.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.720
But what would you say to somebody who is still

49:34.720 --> 49:35.760
in that paradigm?

49:35.760 --> 49:38.040
How would you, how would you go about that?

49:38.040 --> 49:39.560
So that's a, that's a tough one, right?

49:39.560 --> 49:41.640
You're describing the deepest of the deep people

49:41.640 --> 49:46.640
and that we have to realize that before too long,

49:47.640 --> 49:50.520
we're gonna have to just do things anyway.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.920
I'm not saying we leave them behind,

49:51.920 --> 49:53.880
but some people are gonna be unrescuable.

49:53.880 --> 49:57.840
But from that perspective, one of the best places to start

49:57.840 --> 50:00.440
that sometimes wakes people up is to ask them,

50:01.480 --> 50:02.760
what do you think would have happened

50:02.760 --> 50:05.800
if we would have rolled out all of these tests in 2018?

50:05.800 --> 50:06.840
What would we have found?

50:06.840 --> 50:08.320
Nothing.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.360
And just leave it there for a second.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.400
Just let them think about the possibility

50:12.400 --> 50:15.840
that there were at some point in 2021,

50:15.840 --> 50:20.640
there were 254 different emergency use authorized

50:20.640 --> 50:24.920
testing diagnostic products in America alone.

50:24.920 --> 50:28.480
Now, how many of those products were brought to market rushed?

50:28.480 --> 50:30.120
How many of them were brought to market

50:30.120 --> 50:31.760
without proper quality control?

50:31.760 --> 50:35.560
How many were brought to market without proper testing?

50:35.560 --> 50:37.720
We don't know because all of those,

50:37.720 --> 50:40.200
and I mean literally all of those products

50:40.200 --> 50:41.320
are gone.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.160
They're not there.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.400
You can't find an example of them to look and see

50:44.400 --> 50:48.120
and test again to see if those were really good products

50:48.120 --> 50:49.880
or that that company was doing what they were doing.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.160
There were so many instant startup companies

50:53.160 --> 50:55.460
that bought molecular biological tools,

50:55.460 --> 50:58.080
ordered the reagents and purported to be doing weekly

50:58.080 --> 51:01.480
testing for police departments and places all around

51:01.480 --> 51:05.000
the United States, and all of those companies are gone.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.280
They're gone.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.240
The companies that made millions of dollars

51:08.240 --> 51:11.720
testing police officers every day in California,

51:11.720 --> 51:13.280
those companies are gone.

51:13.280 --> 51:17.120
So we can't look at what amplicons they amplified,

51:17.120 --> 51:20.640
what primers they used, what machines they worked on.

51:20.640 --> 51:22.800
We don't even know if their protocols

51:22.800 --> 51:26.320
are still on a piece of paper somewhere, and they're all gone.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.120
And so what you need to ask those people to get them started

51:29.120 --> 51:30.800
is to think what would have happened

51:30.800 --> 51:35.160
if this large group of products and equipment

51:35.200 --> 51:38.040
and machines was rolled out in 2018

51:38.040 --> 51:40.080
and all of these places at the same time

51:40.080 --> 51:41.400
and they started testing.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.160
Do you actually believe they would have found nothing

51:44.160 --> 51:47.600
until October of 2019, and that you would have been able

51:47.600 --> 51:51.640
to chart its accurate spread from Wuhan all around the world?

51:51.640 --> 51:54.200
Because that's what they want you to believe.

51:54.200 --> 51:57.200
And there is no precedence in biological history

51:57.200 --> 52:01.880
for a molecule of RNA to be able to high fidelity copy itself

52:01.880 --> 52:03.680
for five years sustained.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.320
It's never even come close.

52:06.320 --> 52:10.240
And so if you can point out that what we are essentially doing

52:10.240 --> 52:13.400
is taking lots of pictures that we never took before

52:13.400 --> 52:16.080
and claiming that, look, every time I take a picture

52:16.080 --> 52:17.960
in my backyard, I see a cardinal.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.440
And you have no pictures from 2018.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.920
And so you claim that the Cardinals just came

52:23.920 --> 52:25.760
and they're infesting your backyard.

52:25.760 --> 52:28.680
But if you had pictures from 2018,

52:28.680 --> 52:30.960
you would see that the Cardinals were there too.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.960
And so the big picture is trying to make people understand

52:34.960 --> 52:37.280
that the possibility is endless

52:37.280 --> 52:42.280
because we've gone from not measuring anything

52:42.400 --> 52:45.600
to having a million thermometers

52:45.600 --> 52:49.240
in every location in the world

52:49.240 --> 52:51.360
and then claiming there's global warming.

52:51.360 --> 52:54.840
We have no measurements from before 2020.

52:54.840 --> 52:57.240
So how can you put this into context,

52:57.240 --> 53:00.280
especially when you're taking the test seriously,

53:00.280 --> 53:01.800
even when you don't have symptoms?

53:01.800 --> 53:04.960
That's where this all spiraled out of control

53:04.960 --> 53:09.120
was the idea that we could track this RNA

53:09.120 --> 53:11.320
even when symptoms weren't present,

53:11.320 --> 53:14.600
these tests were purported to be meaningful.

53:14.600 --> 53:18.680
And so if you combine these four or five observations

53:18.680 --> 53:23.120
that there were 254 at the maximum sometime,

53:23.120 --> 53:26.120
different diagnostics that are all gone now

53:26.120 --> 53:28.440
and that we don't have any control data

53:28.440 --> 53:31.480
from pre-pandemic to know whether any of these diagnostics

53:31.480 --> 53:34.000
would have brought the same signal then.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.920
And so therefore, the idea that this is just the evidence

53:38.920 --> 53:40.400
that we need to understand

53:40.400 --> 53:42.960
that there is a phenomenon happening now that started

53:42.960 --> 53:45.480
but wasn't happening in 2019

53:45.480 --> 53:50.720
is just an absolutely false dichotomy that we cannot accept.

53:50.720 --> 53:54.280
It's not either or, it is that it could have always been there

53:54.280 --> 53:57.680
or a signal that was there could be confounded

53:57.720 --> 53:59.400
as this agent.

53:59.400 --> 54:04.320
And it's so much safer for the people that run this show

54:04.320 --> 54:08.320
for it to be a giant pile of misleading statements

54:08.320 --> 54:12.800
and outright lies than it is to be some combination

54:12.800 --> 54:14.760
of cover-up and bio-weapon.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.760
Yeah, it's just about deception.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.720
And as you pointed out, the protocols were what caused,

54:23.240 --> 54:24.160
well, you didn't point out here,

54:24.160 --> 54:25.480
but you have that the protocols

54:25.520 --> 54:27.120
was what spiked the mortality

54:27.120 --> 54:30.360
and that there was no spread from country to country

54:30.360 --> 54:34.880
that showed up with the only thing there was a pandemic

54:34.880 --> 54:37.480
of was fear and compliance.

54:37.480 --> 54:38.320
Absolutely.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.400
And I think as you just said,

54:40.400 --> 54:42.920
that's before we go to break, I think it's coming soon.

54:44.560 --> 54:48.040
The idea that what they did was have us focus

54:48.040 --> 54:51.400
on the wrong questions in 2020 and 2021

54:51.400 --> 54:52.840
so that you and I wouldn't notice

54:52.840 --> 54:54.600
that they were killing people with ventilators.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.280
We wouldn't notice that they were killing people

54:56.280 --> 54:59.960
with anesthesia and revdesivir.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.240
We wouldn't notice that they were killing people

55:03.240 --> 55:06.400
in old folks' homes and we would be thrown these numbers

55:06.400 --> 55:09.640
out of context and the confusion and uncertainty

55:09.640 --> 55:13.720
and doubt that those numbers and the illusion of consensus

55:13.720 --> 55:17.240
on TV and social media about what those numbers meant

55:17.240 --> 55:21.560
made us very, very unlikely to question the basis

55:21.560 --> 55:24.580
for what they were saying and the basis for their projections.

55:24.580 --> 55:27.380
And it took us because of the effectiveness

55:27.380 --> 55:30.260
of this operation and getting us to solve the mystery

55:30.260 --> 55:32.500
of the novel virus and whether they were lying about it

55:32.500 --> 55:34.720
being a lab leak or a natural virus,

55:34.720 --> 55:37.980
got us to avoid asking the question

55:37.980 --> 55:40.980
of do we really have something here or not?

55:40.980 --> 55:42.180
And that was what it was.

55:42.180 --> 55:45.420
It was panicking us into asking the wrong questions

55:45.420 --> 55:46.380
for three years.

55:46.380 --> 55:49.060
And if we asked the right questions in 2020,

55:49.060 --> 55:50.900
like some of these people were,

55:50.900 --> 55:53.340
we would have avoided this mess entirely.

55:55.140 --> 55:58.660
I think it's clear that this was a military operation.

55:58.660 --> 55:59.660
Absolutely.

55:59.660 --> 56:04.180
War crime committed against every person on the planet.

56:04.180 --> 56:06.580
This depopulation agenda is part of it,

56:06.580 --> 56:10.260
but it's also about creating that new control grid

56:10.260 --> 56:12.380
with the central bank digital currency,

56:12.380 --> 56:16.460
the vaccine passport, the proximity sensors

56:16.460 --> 56:19.020
with this little NSA low jack I have in my hand,

56:19.020 --> 56:22.260
I call it, you know, this thing is a weapons platform.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.620
I talk about that a lot too.

56:23.620 --> 56:25.900
And it just, that's part of it.

56:25.900 --> 56:29.860
The whole thing is part of a whole, you know,

56:29.860 --> 56:32.140
you have to, they're bringing this together

56:32.140 --> 56:33.140
as a control grid.

56:33.140 --> 56:34.580
It's not one thing or another.

56:34.580 --> 56:36.940
And that part's really scary.

56:36.940 --> 56:38.420
I really appreciate you coming on.

56:38.420 --> 56:40.300
We don't have a break until a couple of minutes,

56:40.300 --> 56:44.180
but you guys, next hour, if you have questions for a change,

56:44.180 --> 56:52.660
you can call 512-248-8252, that's 512-248-8252.

56:53.100 --> 56:56.180
But let your chat know that too.

56:56.180 --> 56:58.220
So next hour, we'll take some callers.

56:58.220 --> 57:02.020
And you just mentioned Rhett Weinstein too,

57:02.020 --> 57:03.980
how he was put in place, and a lot of other people

57:03.980 --> 57:06.820
were put in place to create this thing.

57:06.820 --> 57:09.660
And I saw something with him the other day.

57:09.660 --> 57:12.620
And do you want to speak about that?

57:12.620 --> 57:13.620
Sure.

57:13.620 --> 57:15.780
You said that the fair and cleavage site and all that,

57:15.780 --> 57:16.620
yes or go ahead.

57:16.620 --> 57:17.620
Sure.

57:17.620 --> 57:19.980
So what I think, one of the things that people are forgetting

57:19.980 --> 57:21.820
are some of the things that are easy to forget.

57:21.860 --> 57:23.700
If you weren't involved in it like I was

57:23.700 --> 57:26.580
from the very beginning, is that in 2020,

57:26.580 --> 57:29.540
there were certain parts of this biological narrative

57:29.540 --> 57:31.140
that were emphasized by everyone.

57:31.140 --> 57:33.300
And some of the people that were emphasizing it early

57:33.300 --> 57:35.460
had no business knowing it.

57:35.460 --> 57:38.300
And this comes down to this fear and cleavage site,

57:38.300 --> 57:40.980
which is essentially an enzymatic cleavage site,

57:40.980 --> 57:44.620
which was purported to be an unnatural signature

57:44.620 --> 57:47.780
in the spike protein of the original virus.

57:47.780 --> 57:50.780
And so here you have a bunch of people

57:50.860 --> 57:52.580
in the backwoods of the internet

57:52.580 --> 57:55.460
that are already aware of the spike protein

57:55.460 --> 57:58.340
of coronavirus as being the immunogenic protein

57:58.340 --> 58:01.820
and already aware that a fear and cleavage site is dangerous.

58:01.820 --> 58:04.940
And some of the people that were made aware of this

58:04.940 --> 58:06.660
were had to have been planted.

58:06.660 --> 58:09.060
Because in the end, the fear and cleavage site

58:09.060 --> 58:11.740
wasn't tracked, they didn't wait for the cleavage site

58:11.740 --> 58:13.580
to disappear and then announced that the fear

58:13.580 --> 58:16.860
and cleavage site had gone away in variant V.

58:16.860 --> 58:18.780
And so now it was much safer.

58:18.780 --> 58:21.860
They started this whole narrative in 2020

58:21.860 --> 58:24.100
with the idea that the fear and cleavage site,

58:24.100 --> 58:25.740
and we've heard this just recently

58:25.740 --> 58:27.620
from the US Right to Know story,

58:27.620 --> 58:30.260
that the fear and cleavage site is what allowed the virus

58:30.260 --> 58:33.140
to become the most infectious virus in 100 years.

58:33.140 --> 58:35.860
But then if it's such an important aspect

58:35.860 --> 58:38.220
of the virulence and the infectivity of the virus,

58:38.220 --> 58:40.580
why weren't we tracking the presence of the fear

58:40.580 --> 58:42.820
and cleavage site for the entire pandemic?

58:42.820 --> 58:46.380
And we were sequencing it, we were sequencing the whole virus,

58:46.380 --> 58:47.620
but nobody ever talked about

58:47.620 --> 58:49.500
whether the fear and cleavage site was changing

58:49.500 --> 58:51.260
or disappearing or whether some variants

58:51.260 --> 58:53.380
still had it and others didn't.

58:53.380 --> 58:57.420
And this is a key, key thing to see

58:57.420 --> 58:59.740
that we were encouraged to argue about that

58:59.740 --> 59:01.380
for a year and a half and in reality,

59:01.380 --> 59:03.220
it was never meaningful.

59:03.220 --> 59:05.580
And in fact, what we should have been arguing about

59:05.580 --> 59:08.180
is should we be using remdesivir on old people?

59:08.180 --> 59:10.700
Should we be giving these people antibiotics or not?

59:10.700 --> 59:12.680
Should we be using steroids or not?

59:12.680 --> 59:14.740
Because instead they had a protocol.

59:14.780 --> 59:16.700
And if you declared people,

59:16.700 --> 59:19.220
if you declared that people were COVID,

59:19.220 --> 59:21.940
then you were completely off the hook for any malpractice

59:21.940 --> 59:23.060
and you could do whatever you want,

59:23.060 --> 59:25.500
as long as it was on the CDC protocol.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.660
It's really frightening.

59:27.780 --> 59:30.060
That's the deal with the protocols,

59:30.060 --> 59:32.540
is they distracted us so that we wouldn't notice

59:32.540 --> 59:35.220
that they were creating these mass casualty events

59:35.220 --> 59:36.780
that they could misconstrue as spread.

59:36.780 --> 59:38.700
We'll be right back, folks.

59:38.700 --> 59:41.220
Yeah, thanks very much, Judge, we'll be right back.

59:41.220 --> 59:48.140
MUSIC

59:48.140 --> 59:49.740
HUHA!

59:49.740 --> 59:51.420
It gets to be like, I saw it,

59:51.420 --> 59:54.980
he gave me a 22nd morning over there, which was handy.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.940
HUHA!

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.820
Are you guys going to call in or what?

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:08.460
It's here 512-248-8252.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.340
There used to be this guy in Chicago called,

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.940
well, he was in other cities too,

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.700
Man Cow's Morning Madhouse.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.140
Did you ever hear this in the 2000s?

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.220
And you were supposed to call in

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.060
and you always had to say,

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.620
hey, Man Cow, I love you, love your show.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.180
It was really, it was a funny thing

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.380
for a while in Chicago.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.980
I don't know where he was syndicated,

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.020
though I don't think he was in Chicago.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.020
Man Cow's Morning Madhouse, you remember that?

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.020
Anybody?

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.340
No.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.460
Homeowners, are you in foreclosure?

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.180
Homeowners, are you in foreclosure?

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.220
The closure lawsuit for Suspector Lender

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.220
has coerced you into an illegal mortgage transaction.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.140
A huge number of mortgages made in the last 10 years

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.740
have legal issues and are possibly defective.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.860
State laws and the US Supreme Court have upheld.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.980
I hope my wife is home because the kids

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.460
are really probably burning the house down right now.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.420
In favor of the homeowner, if your mortgage has been sold

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.420
or is not going to ask her if she's home.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.220
It may be defective and you may be...

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.380
Thanks for listening, guys.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.340
Thanks for being here.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.740
What advice would you give a teenager aspiring

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.180
to become a medical doctor at these types?

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.020
Yikes.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.820
Wow.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.820
Interesting question.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.100
That's going to be tough.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.420
It's too bad there's a person that's in the chat

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.380
every once in a while by the name of Elizabeth Rogers.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:33.220
And she's a recent graduate and she's having

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:36.580
a lot of trouble integrating because of her understanding

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.860
and how that's not very acceptable in America.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.860
Is the Supreme Yoga.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.020
I didn't see her in the chat yet,

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.340
but she's sometimes here at night.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.180
She's real cool.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.900
The towers above all the herbs, herbal minerals

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.820
and earth-made adaptions.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.660
What's up?

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.260
Oh, picture of the doggy.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.100
Nice.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.300
That have the ability to synergistically make better

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.420
and carry other substances to its prescribed definition.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.300
Yeah, you could become a D.O.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.420
Most any herb, food or mineral is amplified

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.500
with ionic potential.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.380
Superimposing superior efficacy.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.780
Learn the guitar.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.620
Ha ha ha.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.140
Sorry, I do that online.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.860
My headphones get really itchy.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.900
I apologize for that.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.740
That's kind of gross probably for some people

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.860
to think that's gross, but my ears are so clean

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.860
because I do it like 50 times a day.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.060
And the Supreme Yoga.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:21.900
I don't know if you know this,

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:24.540
but dogs really love to have their ears scratched

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.900
and I'm kind of like that.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.500
The healing power of music.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.500
RBN when ordering.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.060
That's G-O-R-B-N.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:34.900
Mm-mm.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.660
Oh, his wife is a recovering COVID nurse, he says.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:40.820
Well, didn't know that.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.740
They're hanging over their heads

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.300
whenever they're using pharmaceutical drugs.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.780
For some, the short-term relief can turn

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.100
into an opioid addiction nightmare.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.060
Oh, nice commercial.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.140
CBD oil is a billion dollar industry.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.020
CBD oils and opioids.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.100
What's better than opioids

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.860
and is actually healthy for you.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.300
However, CBD oil is stripped of all other helpful compounds

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.900
found in the hemp plants.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.420
According to neuroscientists, the whole hemp plant,

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.460
otherwise known as hemp paste,

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:16.020
is even more effective than the chemically processed CBD oil.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.780
Are you ready to take back your health?

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.540
You can try hemp paste for the price of a cup of coffee.

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.300
Become a naturopath, but I don't know where you go

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.340
for school like that.

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.020
Where do you go to school for a naturopath?

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.780
Hey, welcome back, thought criminals.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.140
You listened to Thought Crime Live

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.300
on Republic Broadcasting Network.org.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.500
And let me turn it back over to you, JJ.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.900
You got interrupted there.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.940
We were talking about whether this thing even really

01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:59.460
was it ever really sequenced?

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.820
Does it even, you know, that it was all a tool of control

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.140
and manipulation, I believe?

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.020
Yeah, thanks.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.260
The two things that we talked about in the previous breaks,

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.580
one was just the misrepresentation of transfection

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.140
as a methodology that might be useful in healthy humans.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.540
And the other one was talking about the misleading

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.900
sort of exaggeration of the power of AI

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.500
and what AI really is versus what it isn't.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.780
I think one of the things to combine those two ideas together

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.700
would be to make people realize that transfection,

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.220
which is this general term which describes the use of DNA

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:44.940
or RNA to express a protein in anywhere.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.660
So if you use it in a cell culture, it's transfection.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:53.660
If you use RNA or DNA to express a protein in a mouse,

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.620
it's transfection.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.500
If you do it with injection into a plant, it's transfection.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.340
And so this is a very general term

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.900
that's been around for a long time.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.300
And there's lots of companies that have had various products

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:08.380
called transfection agents that have been like lip effectamine

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:12.540
or gold particles or you can even use electricity to do it.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.940
So the idea of applying transfection

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:20.940
to usefully augment the human genome or the human animal

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.340
is something that they have seen as a coming technology

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.780
for many, many years, but they've also known

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.340
that there's no way to usefully start to understand

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.140
how to employ this methodology

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:40.340
by doing proxy studies in mice or in monkeys.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.140
And the reason why those don't work is because

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:47.780
the complications that are a mouse

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.660
or the complications that are a monkey

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.860
and the complex sort of pattern integrity

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.420
that those animals are, they are sufficiently specific

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.020
and sufficiently different from our own

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.740
that although we can learn general principles

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.540
about how these biological systems work

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:09.100
by studying those animals, what we learn from monkeys

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.860
and mice as we get more sophisticated

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.620
becomes ever more specific for mice and monkeys

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.140
and ever more non-relevant for our own biology.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.140
And they have known this for decades, Steve.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.540
So one of the things they need to do is to transform

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.780
the way our children think about their own sovereignty

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.460
over their bodies so that they accept the fact

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.100
that if we're gonna get to this next stage of medicine,

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.980
which is personalized medicine,

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.900
you're gonna have to accept that we don't test things

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.020
in randomized control trials anymore.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.660
We test things on you.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.740
And so this is really part of the inversion

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.940
that was going on right now

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.980
was trying to invert the idea that you have the choice.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.780
No, now we're telling you what you have to do.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.780
And this inversion is not for us.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.460
They knew that we were gonna complain until we were dead.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.820
But it's for our kids and that's really what it,

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.380
that's why I keep emphasizing it.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.220
They want us to pass this compliance onto our kids.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.220
Yes, I agree.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.560
If we, I see it in the young ones that are always

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.580
on the screen, just like you were talking about

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.460
how we, oh, how we were bored as kids.

01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:20.420
Oh, I see you're the top of the hour folks.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.780
We'll be taking your calls all next hour.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.980
Hang on, thought criminals, be right back.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:25.980
Yeah.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:26.980
Yeah.

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.980
Yeah.

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.980
Yeah.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.980
Yeah.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.980
Yeah.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980
Yeah.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980
Yeah.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.980
Yeah.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980
Yeah.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.980
Yeah.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.300
You know, they could replace doctors with some AI.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.700
I mean, AI is not that it's useless.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.260
It can, it can speed things up and it can make,

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.060
it can make certain diagnosis faster and more accurately

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.380
like when they're looking at X-rays or MRIs and stuff like that.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.260
But it's still ultimately is, is being trained by a human.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:08:00.740
And so you're never gonna, you're, you're setting in motion

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.500
something that you train, just like what you're doing in case

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.020
you didn't know every time you're doing one of these,

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.820
these capture things, you're actually training an AI

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.500
to identify the motorcycle.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.180
You're identifying the stairs.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.100
You're identifying the trains.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:18.660
You're teaching an AI there, not any different than what they do at Tesla

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:24.740
when they label all these videos by hand in order for the AI to have the data.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.540
It's the same thing and they want to do that with the human genome.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.460
And that's where it's really ridiculous because what are they going to measure?

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.420
What are they going to annotate it with?

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:39.340
iPhone data, heart rate, temperature, you know, these are very crude measurements

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:43.100
that don't tell them anything about the dynamic pattern integrity that's going on

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.980
that's you, you know, so that's where we are.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:46.700
It's a southern revolver.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.300
I'd rather be ruled by China than Jews.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.740
Call it with the anti-Semitic marks, right?

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.700
Ooh, anti-Semitic, what the hell?

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.740
You steal and elect him and terminate the Republic.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.660
It doesn't mean it's determinates the people.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.020
Ooh, some, some pretty crazy, uh...

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.540
Take the vaccine.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.380
Ooh, cute little gates.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.340
Thought criminals, though.

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.580
There was a way for you still on 10 or six.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:13.060
What needed to be done is to object to every single state.

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.820
We've got another hour yet, so I've got to, I've got to, hopefully there's some coffee

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.820
coming down here.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.620
I need some coffee.

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:24.940
The Patrick and Jeremy show, Tuesday at nine central and Wednesday at one central.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.900
You can't handle the truth!

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.660
You're listening to Republic Broadcasting Network.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:35.620
Visit republicbroadcasting.org today because you can handle the truth.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.620
I think we're back.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.340
Yeah, but nursing is brutal.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.780
Oh, my gosh, nursing is brutal.

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.780
Um...

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.820
Don't you mess with the wall?

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.060
Talk about coming in on the low end of the totem pole.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:04.060
You were built in that plane.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:08.060
You were built all around.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.060
You were the high beyond walls.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.060
You were the high behind houses.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.060
I just want you to know I can see three of us.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.060
I want you to know.

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.060
75 people watching.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:26.060
Wow, thanks, guys.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.060
Thanks for being here.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.060
That's really cool.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.060
I appreciate that.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:55.340
I would be, if I was doing this, I would be playing, um, I would be playing immortal

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:56.340
technique.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.820
Uh, I like that.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.820
The dominant species.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.340
I think that's the song I would use.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.580
If it wasn't so, it's got efforts in it, and I know people don't like that.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:11.020
But otherwise, I would use that song every day on my show.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.460
I don't know if this is Aussie or Sabbath, and I know that makes me a loser, but, uh,

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.380
I didn't listen to Aussie and Sabbath enough.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.180
It was always my roommates who played that stuff.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:25.100
I was really into technical music, I'm very sorry, but I really liked.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.820
Bayla Fleck of the Fleck tones describes everything that I am and everything that

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.740
I wanted to be then, and, uh, the reason why I only played around with guitar was because

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:38.260
I idolized Bayla Fleck, and if you know who Bayla Fleck is, then you know that you don't

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.780
have any, any misconceptions about becoming Bayla Fleck.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:50.940
You just like to play some music and play along, so, Bayla Fleck, Victor Luton, um, Mike

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:58.620
Stern, uh, I got into Chick-fil-A for a while because of Bayla Fleck, um, John

01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.620
Schofield.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.700
I liked a lot, I like a lot, um, and then I'm, I'm Real Miles Davis, Bill Evans, kind

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:12.980
of guy too, Bill Evans, oh my gosh, I play Bill Evans a lot, a lot, Bill Evans, um, and

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.020
then most of the time music is just, uh, reminiscent for me.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.660
I play a lot of old stuff that I used to like or reminds me of old times, reminds me of

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.660
Nathan.

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:30.100
Um, I listened to Joe Sanger, you're listening to Thought Crime Live on Republic Broadcasting

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.100
Network.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.700
This is our two of Thought Crime Live for February the 3rd, 2024.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:41.540
Wow, time sure is flying in, and I'm joined today by Dr. Jonathan Cooey, JJ Cooey of

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:48.060
GigaOMBiological.com, and we've just been committing thought crimes here talking a lot

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:53.340
about the biology and the scyop that was known as COVID, and, uh, let me turn it back

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.820
to you, sir, I've already got a lot of feedback from people saying you should be a regular

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.500
guest and I knew that they would feel that way.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.980
I've learned a great deal from following your stream.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.220
Oh, thank you very much.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.500
That's our question for JJ too.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.340
Let me, let me toss this out to y'all.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.220
If you would like to have a question, it's 512-248-8252.

01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.580
We will take callers this hour.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.820
Yes, sir, please go ahead.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:17.060
Um, so I would, I would like to just put a shout out there for people, not only to look

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:22.940
for GigaOMBiological and join my streams and, and, and listen to my broadcast, but I would

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:28.780
like you to try and locate someone by the name of Jessica Hockett, um, and, uh, locate

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:35.060
someone by the name of Mark Koolack, who, who, who streams under the name Mark Hewsittonic

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.420
live on YouTube.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:42.580
He recently lost his main channel because he covers some of the very same stuff that

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.580
I cover.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:49.340
Um, and some of these people are better at seeing this elephant from other sides.

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:54.060
Another person that I really like your viewers to become familiar with is a guy by the name

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:59.300
of Denny, D-E-N-I-S, Denny Rancor.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:05.500
He is a Canadian, um, used to be a physicist and a professor of physics, um, but lost

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:10.500
his job after an extended battle over free speech with the faculty.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.940
He won that case eventually and so now he's just kind of a free thinker and he has done

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.180
a lot of analysis on all cause mortality.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:23.820
So just for your viewers out there real quick, um, run through all cause mortality is just

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.020
what it sounds like.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:30.020
All the people that have died every year in America, it might be of a surprise to some

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:39.180
people that between 2,700,000 and 3,000,000 Americans die every year, which is somewhere

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:46.420
between 50 and 65,000 Americans every week, every year all the time.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:51.180
And so when they were telling us that there were a thousand people dying of COVID and

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:56.340
giving us no context in which to process that number, it sounds like a slaughter bath.

01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:02.580
But if they had told you that every week in America, we expect between 55 and 65,000 Americans

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:08.420
to pass away from all causes, then it would be into a context that you might better to

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420
be able to understand.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.340
Now imagine if they had taken this and said that every year we lose about 15,000 people

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:22.060
to unexplained pneumonia and we save about another 50,000 people from unexplained pneumonia

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:27.980
every year and the way we do it is broad spectrum antibiotics and some steroids if it goes nuts.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:35.040
And we stopped doing that and the deaths from secondary pneumonia went up as high as triple

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.880
they've ever been in the last two decades.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:43.120
And so there are some fundamental aspects of how the medicine was executed, how medicine

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.640
was changed at the start of the pandemic that has been confounded as evidence of a spreading

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.280
pathogen when really it feels a lot more in retrospect like it was evidence of some spreading

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.280
bad ideas.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.520
It's very, very well put.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.600
Someone wanted me to ask, did you think there was any link with the 5G and the spread at

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.600
all?

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:09.160
That some people have speculated on that too, they just wanted your opinion on that.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:14.640
Well I mean the 5G at the beginning of the pandemic was used more as a distraction and

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.280
so I can tell you that there were quite a few people that I was interacting with at the

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.440
beginning of the pandemic behind the scenes that were insistent that one of the ways that

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.080
the Chinese government or whoever was attacking us with this novel pathogen was going to work

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:38.080
against us, was going to confuse people by saying that the rollout of 5G was actually

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.320
what they were doing and that this whole COVID thing was a cover up and so it's interesting

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.320
that 5G was one of these major narratives that was tied into the beginning but then also

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.640
the brass tacks on the ground is that in a lot of places around the world they were indeed

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.280
rolling out 5G towers at the start of the COVID pandemic.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:08.040
So it is not something that can be discounted but what you need to see as a passive or casual

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:15.800
viewer of this very interesting time in history is to see how aggressively the issue of 5G,

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:24.280
its technology, its potential danger for your children was completely confounded with the

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.440
presence of a pathogen and so instead of legitimately questioning whether or not these

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:35.200
high powered towers should be near residential areas we were instead arguing about whether

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.720
5G was capable of interacting with some nanoparticle that they may or may not have released and

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.920
so by having us get into these very vigorous discussions and these very limited debates

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.000
that have nothing to do with reality we have neither effectively questioned the spread of

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.960
a novel pathogen nor have we effectively questioned the safety of 5G and 5 years later

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:01.640
we are still asking the wrong questions about both of these issues.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:08.360
And we have yet to question or hold the pharmaceutical companies liable for the vaccine.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:16.920
So you know I wish I had never been vaccinated and I was bamboozled into taking something

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:24.280
into H1N1 scottop you know I got they I was damaged by those and pharmaceuticals have harmed me

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.920
I mean that's a whole other subject but I so much better without big pharma that just that's not

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:39.120
beneficial to humans it just it's just that just why I can't believe people are still buying into

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.800
that and it's killing people I care about you know you were talking about some people maybe you

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.240
have to be left behind or whatever that breaks my heart sometimes I know that you know this

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:56.760
thing is daunting and we have to talk to the kids you you mentioned that too let me let me we

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.680
have some caller caller already let me get the caller's question here Patrick and Texas

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:09.920
Patrick you have a question for John I do I think your doctor's gonna be a great asset for our people

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:17.360
because if there's a Rockefeller all-pathic medicine they've always it's even before Rockefeller

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.720
it was corrupt they were always you know they would not do what the Indians did are you steaming

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.120
tents natural remedies are very effective ten times more effective than in the point that they

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:36.720
were feeding you know people for acceptance they give mercury and stuff like that but you know to

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:43.280
think about it is like you know there's a 5G there's we're so sensitive there's a there's a study

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.000
where this there was a classroom where all the kids came down leukemia or vast majority of them and

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.520
they found out that these they were not opening the windows and letting sunlight come in and it was

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.200
all about the lights they weren't getting we're so just a simple thing is life full spectrum of

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:08.320
light can can lead to outbreak of leukemia you know what about 5G what's that gonna do to us

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:15.840
you're gonna give us all you know brain tumors I don't know but you know I think you know you know

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:24.240
is this is the Rockefeller all-pathic medicine that's you know that's as sparked this or is it

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.440
was it corrupt before this or how why are all the doctors so complicit it's a good question you

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.960
know part of it has to do with the way that they are educated I think a large fraction of it has

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.160
to do with the way that they are educated I mean if you talk to the average medical school graduate

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.360
now you're gonna find that that they may not even have a real immunology class they certainly

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.760
don't have a vaccinology class even though we've heard for the last three years that there are

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.560
all these people that call themselves vaccinologists I don't know where they learn their trade or

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.120
what school they trained in because it seems like a moniker that you just claim when you're on

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.160
this train where you think that vaccines are great and I I don't necessarily have the the

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.960
receipts to say that it goes right back to the Rockefeller family but I don't think that anyone

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:20.400
would argue with the idea that the Rockefellers fundamentally changed the way that medicine existed

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:26.240
in the United States by using weaponized piles of money to influence the way that medicine was

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.960
taught and influence the foundational principles of medicine to rather than looking at the patient

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.960
as a whole and and trying to decide what they're doing wrong that you could bring them back to well

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:44.480
being you try to think of something that you can give them that comes from your product line and

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.440
again this was you know what do we do with all these chemicals that we get from from the oil

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:55.360
industry what do we do with all this extra stuff that we have and we're finding they they

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.680
realize that this could all be products if we could be convinced that these things were

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:07.600
had medicinal value so I don't I don't I don't want to discard the the the callers I mean he's

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.120
definitely right that they have a seminal role in this but I also want to caution everybody

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:19.040
listening to not think that is as simple as the Rockefellers because the Rockefellers is actually

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:26.720
a pretty mainstream answer to this problem and I want to encourage everybody that that any of these

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.600
so you know right in front of your face answers to this problem are likely to be incorrect or at

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.560
least incorrect enough so that we're not going to get the get the touchdown that we want by saying

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.160
it was the Rockefellers we've got to go against we've got to go first of all we need to make sure

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.920
that we isolate live people and people that are currently at the heads of these weaponized piles

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.040
of money because that's really what it is we're we're dealing with wet piles of money that are

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:59.680
so big that that governments have to listen to them and that that is the unseen force that's working

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.400
in the background I don't know who or what their names are but I do know that there are piles of

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:10.000
money that are so big that they can influence individuals and influence whole governments and

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.480
that's where this whole problem lies because we think as people that watch TV that the way that we

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.840
we excise ourselves from this situation is to elect the right people but if all of the people

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.760
that we are allowed to elect are already under the auspices of these large piles of money then we

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.160
we are electing nobody and we are never really going to get out of this terrific answer thank you very

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:41.200
much thank you thank you for your Patrick yeah I'll point I say that you can vote for the puppets

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.960
but you never get to vote for the puppeteer that that's well put sir uh next up we have

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.360
Sherry in Kansas Sherry thank you very much for the call

01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:03.840
uh do we have Sherry um JJ I'll tell you up front I'm more of a terrain theory type person than

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:12.480
germ theory um but and I I do believe that it's a lot of people just don't

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:23.600
detoxify because of all the crap they're putting in but and then crap in our environment um but

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:30.400
I've heard people say that if you're talking like the number of cells you have in our skin

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:38.160
sheet that a lot more of them are not considered our DNA but we couldn't live without them

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:47.920
and so when you talk about the 5G and all this this wireless energy in our environment

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:56.320
I mean it's got to be affecting stuff that keeps us healthy like those little bacteria and

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.440
you know everything in our microbiome

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:07.200
with their active denial systems we know they can cause people to crap and they can cause

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.960
people to change emotion it can be affecting that stuff too

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.720
I was gonna let you finish there I completely agree um the terrain and germ theory uh debate

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:30.240
is actually another one of these you know one side wins the other side loses kind of thing if

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.120
you if you fight for one of those as being the dominant theory then you're not really fighting

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.640
for the middle ground there which is really what we should be fighting for um I agree totally um

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.440
with your assessment and I would have gone there already with the previous caller in the sense of

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:54.400
saying that um the United States as a culture unfortunately the the masses the tv watching masses

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.440
are not taking care of themselves and they haven't taken care of themselves for 20 years because

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:04.640
the food hasn't been available the culture tells them to sit on their couch and watch tv

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:10.800
and and being overweight and unhealthy has become uh just what Americans are and this

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:17.440
is a fundamental thing that gets ignored every time that these people go to the doctor's office

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.000
there the doctor doesn't start with well if you wouldn't have mistreated your body for the last

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.280
25 years we wouldn't be here and so maybe we should reverse some of those habits that are that

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.520
brought you to this stage they are just looking for the product that they should give out the

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.280
product that they should sell the product they should prescribe and so these these issues I think

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:45.840
can't be underestimated and so if you if you can teach the children and teach young people that

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.880
that just by watching the amount of crap that comes into their body just by drinking clean

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:57.120
water just by by maintaining as you said the microbes in their gut and the microbes on their

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:05.280
skin and not using antibiotics all the time not using um products that that disrupt the microbiome

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.920
we as you said understand that that a a diverse and well functioning microbiome results in

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.920
in well-being in the sense of less depression it results in in more energy it results in better

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.760
health it results in lower weight all of these things and we can't underestimate how the American

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:32.000
culture with processed foods it's kind of making it almost a requirement if you're going to consume

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.040
these products then you're going to have a microbiome and you're going to have an immune system

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.480
that is necessarily compromised if you expose your skin to these cosmetics that have these

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:48.320
untested or unproven chemicals in them over years then you're going to develop immune

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:56.160
abnormalities you're going to develop digestive and metabolic abnormalities that cannot be explained

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.880
by our understanding of a healthy body and they cannot be explained by our understanding of how

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.640
pharmaceuticals work or don't work because we are not at starting at the foundation which is what

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.040
have you done to your sacred biology to set it out of balance and how long have you been doing

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.440
those things and those are questions that we don't ask and i'm assuming or hoping that that's

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.440
really the kind of point you want to make and i totally agree yes sir and not yet myself too

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.160
thanks sherry hey we'll be right back after the break y'all thanks for the call sherry be right

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:37.280
back folks just trying to keep it up holy cow

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:52.720
absolutely it is it has to be half the immune system because it's like half of your exposure

01:28:52.720 --> 01:29:00.000
to the outside world is your gut and the other half is your lungs i mean

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.960
i do like the the old-fashioned guitar music

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:19.440
we can do call-ins i can do a call-in anytime i've got a phone number on my website it'll ring

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.920
on my website it'll ring on me right here i mean i could do it any night we can have a call in

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.680
um i we can definitely do that it's a nice way to have a show if you if you pick a night

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.480
um about it i'll do a call-in show that's fine i just don't think very many people are going

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.600
to call in but that's right i've always left coffee and after traveling so much to air up

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:49.680
south america in trying so many different coffees that were so good and that's my blower in the

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.520
background i apologize if you can hear that

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:08.240
happy birthday to kara jeff from earth happy birthday

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:17.200
happy birthday to your friend and lover happy birthday to kara you have to try out it's fresh

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.920
it is our birthday today right i think so and you will definitely see the difference

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:32.400
steve rayvon baby come on that guy was uh that guy was a spirit um

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.040
yeah steve rayvon is definitely somebody that can we skip last break yes you can

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:46.640
i don't need to break it's 10 21 we have a last break you really want to stay out of the system

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.920
are you prepared to buy into the biggest scams since the iraqitan are if not then put your money

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:57.600
where it belongs in your possession not steve rayvon used to play on a guitar that would cut up

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.480
the normal person's hands like i think he played with 13 gauge strings or something crazy like that

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:09.040
and then bent them all around two full steps i would have bloody fingers after 15 minutes of

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:16.240
doing scales on his guitar i bet gold backing the only gold that i want is just a beast

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.720
an absolute beast it's too bad that he had to drink so hard though i mean you know that's

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.360
what's too bad about it he should still be alive in my mind

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:29.200
to get the full story but maybe we wouldn't have gotten the same s-r-v had he not burnt out in

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.760
that way i don't know once you've read the whole story about the scam being perpetrated on an

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.560
unsuspecting public and how you can avoid being a victim by purchasing these beautiful

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.600
barterable tradable sheets of gold at tremendous savings sheets of gold i don't know why everybody's

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:49.440
selling all this gold and stuff it's weird i hope that it's a good idea i hope that gold

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:54.560
holds its value uh when the dollar crashes i don't know how that's gonna work

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.520
okay there's one at the bottom of the hour but the one we could skip would be at 50 minutes okay

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:07.360
well we'll see it's the bottom of the hour right now oh wow she is got a long ways yet

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:14.720
call kettle meringue limited remember no denar no celery and no carrots if you buy from someone

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:23.680
else tell them you want a you not be yes call kettle meringue lpd today at six zero two seven nine

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.200
nine eight two cattle might be better than gold yeah they're harder to store though i can keep gold

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:34.960
in a little drawer i would love to have cattle and some more chickens definitely

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:47.200
i mean i listened to lead Zeppelin too right come on great job jj says steven so i guess we're

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:56.880
still rocking yeah that's what i want to do we're going to join a co-op farm soon i think this

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.840
ringing probably will

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.000
prince you know my uncle actually sold prince's perfume for a while i i i crap you not

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.480
eh uh there was a time when my uncle was actually talking to prince um of course that business deal

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.600
went bad and now they're not they weren't friends anymore at the end but actually at one point my

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:23.200
uncle was at a party at at prince's house and they bumped into madonna on the dance floor i

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.920
crap you not that's that's actually happened in my family that's really bizarre prince yes

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:41.280
there was this this perfume that he did um it was like called 50 50 whatever and they may see

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.800
sold it and stuff my uncle made that perfume for him i'm not kidding and they didn't go well so

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:53.040
they're not friends now that was like i think that might have already been 20 years ago or something

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.320
but at some moment i had very high hopes that i was going to drive to minnesota and hang out with

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.680
prince that's funny i actually thought that might have been something

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.880
live on republic yeah i know prince's dead i'm steven douglas white and your host i really

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.680
appreciate you joining me uh that was we we were talking to sherry at kansas and i appreciate

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:19.600
those work kind work sherry this this man has taught me a lot that i followed his uh uh uh

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:25.120
streams on giga on biological and response to something that you said you could see the result

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:31.360
of me getting rid of big pharma and trying to readjust the toxins i take in uh probably i think

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:36.720
it might be on my page and army in but if you go to my facebook or or uh twitter i i uh

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.160
the facebook page has the the pictures of how i looked the day i started on army and i was sitting

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.280
on a little red ball outside of target and two years later so i had made a lot of changes and i

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.440
try to i'm not trying to brag about it so much i feel like it's a kind of prideful i say that

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:56.560
sometime but i want to encourage anybody that that thinks they can't make changes in themselves

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:03.120
that look i did this you can do it too you know people inspired me to try and and you guys rbn

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:08.160
was like a family to me too you know it just just knowing that people were listening really had

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.200
an effect on me i want to thank all the listeners for that too and ask you please keep rbn and they

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.880
keep these uh these conversations going too and and with that uh let me go to the next

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.240
caller we have uh Bill and Kentucky thanks for calling bill hey hey uh talk a good talk to you

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.920
again steven talk to you a couple nights you're in blackburn uh one one thing that you have changed

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.400
too besides look like you're better helping lost law weight and everything you got a lot more

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:42.240
hair you got so it's just more like a Robert Planter well i am that long-haired country boy

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:50.480
that's true you have a question for jay j sir yes i do i very much do but what do you know about

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:57.680
that i keep hearing about disease x or pandemic or epidemic x so do you have any inkling on what

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:07.120
that may be or is that just a rumor or what uh bill unfortunately um disease x was a generic

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:13.360
term for the next pandemic and it was already in use um i believe the first time really in 2018

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:22.560
and and it is something that um in these circles of bureaucrats and and and government operatives

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:29.680
it means the the next pandemic and so they're recycling this term and they they have never

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.640
used it at the wef until this year and so i do really think that this is a media campaign to give

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:43.680
you more reinforcing ideas that um that there is another pandemic coming in and it's very likely

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:49.840
to come and so they have to have this plan for disease x and the idea is to imply that there are

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.000
number of different possibilities and that's why they call it disease x i'm not

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.880
i don't at all believe that this is a threat to our children or to us um but i do believe that there

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:07.760
are ways uh you know using lies and and using other biotechnology that they could fool us into

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.200
believing that there was a disease x and so that's the kind of that's the kind of biology i'm trying

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:18.160
to teach and trying to get everybody to understand that that there are tools there are molecular

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.920
biological tools and signals that could be used and misconstrued as spread and whether or not

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.440
they did that this time um is up for grabs because it's a criminal investigation or at least it should

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.480
be so i don't have the answers but whether they could use it the next time is without a doubt

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.480
certain um they could definitely use the biology that i've described to create the next illusion

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.320
of a pandemic and uh i don't think this time they'll fool around i don't think this time they will go

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.480
use any half measures and that's what i'm most afraid about so if we can get our children to

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.000
understand this mythology before they pull that alarm um it would be really great so that's what

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:05.680
disease x is in a nutshell bill thanks for the call this is not a guarantee i'll never get it

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:14.800
or anything but i'm so far missed having the well having told it i've had that uh i take

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:21.200
z 50 milligrams every day vitamin c and uh bill we're coming up on the break sir i'm sorry to

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:28.720
interrupt you uh uh uh any uh can you hold on to the after the break oh no that's okay i i'll

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.120
i'll just go all right thanks for the call sir yeah appreciate you listed sir thanks for the call

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:39.840
i always appreciate your input be right back folks yeah i don't know how this works they

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.960
they get told how many i guess what it is is that they have a certain number of commercials they've

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:53.520
they've agreed to play and so the producer is is counting all of those things and uh he's trying

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:58.160
to make it so that they can skip the break at the end so he wants to skip the break at 50 minutes

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.760
before the hour and so i think that's why he's working in a little of these here

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.640
they are on an internet radio you can see it here um i don't know if they're on the radio radio

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.720
oops um

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.200

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.880

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.840
but in the world is an easel up drop and lift

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.440
our ease off is a new tool to increase production for your meat processing company

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.000
that will get that whole hog or just to give you guys an update i think i'm gonna not stream

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.560
again today after this and instead i'm gonna work on getting the two previous streams up on

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.840
sub stack with a transcript and with subtitles um i hope i'll do a stream tomorrow but i'm not

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:11.920
sure yet because we have basketball tomorrow um but then the rest of them i'm gonna do a stream

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.360
tomorrow because i want to do a stream every day but i don't know when it's going to be and i don't

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.840
think it's going to be a big deal it'll probably just be a study hall um and then i am trying to

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.400
convert to daytime streaming now i'm hoping that i'm going to come on sometime between

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.480
one and two in the afternoon weekdays and then do a question and answer call in at night when i

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.760
have time um nine three two six four one nine and yes you can hire me as a tutor

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:43.040
um find your inner revelate um but yeah that's that's the plan moving forward i'm going to try

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:50.240
and put most of my streams um subtitled and sub-stacked um a few days afterward this week i felt behind

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.800
and i apologize but i i will finish those two this weekend that i think are worthy of it um the

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:04.960
us right to know scooby doo show and um and uh the other one that i did on ai yesterday um

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.840
so those two will be up on sub-stack over the weekend and i hope that the transcripts will be

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.880
edited as well so that'll be nice i think um and that's kind of one of the ways that i'm trying to

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:21.600
get the productive productivity up and the other way to do it is with um thank you with um

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:29.600
with uh putting out a pdf version of it i'm not sure um whether we're going to do a pdf of the

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.920
transcript or whether we're going to try to make a slide deck every week i think it's going to be

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.360
a slide deck but that's tricky because my slide decks are so moving and they're so layered that

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.000
when you make a print of them they don't come out right so i need to make a separate slide deck

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:51.440
which which which is corresponding to the one that i use in the live stream and that turns out to

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.840
be more work than you think because i got like 80 slides in a deck and so then those slides all

01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:02.480
need to be broken up into their component parts or summarized in a way that's not moving and so

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:07.840
that's a little more work than i anticipated so that's that's where we are but the support is

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:13.920
coming in you guys are sharing and we're growing slowly so we've just got to keep hammering um

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:20.720
keep hammering is that a Joe Rogan guy's thing keep on hammering i think it is sorry i said that

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.520
i don't know if we can prepare for the crash other than if all of my neighbors were on my team

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.120
i would be better off and i think that's how you have to think about it if all your neighbors

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:39.520
are on your team then when the collapse does happen um it would be it would be okay you know um

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.760
back y'all you're listening to um thought crime live on republic broadcast network dot org

01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.400
all right i just caught an echo there somehow

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.240
i don't know why that happened but

01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:04.800
is it still happening yeah it's still okay now it's gone thanks i don't know what that was but

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.000
sorry folks i had a little echo but listen thanks for joining me and um i'm joined by jonathan

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.040
dr jonathan cooey jj coo and i want to let you give your uh cite out again for all the listeners i'm

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.840
sure that they would uh uh like to know that man also i wanted to mention to the folks in your stream

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.640
that if they they've never listened to rbn before last i wanted to recommend that last saturday i had

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:31.520
a show uh all was on mike gaddies rebel madman radio show we had the u.s.s. liberty survivors

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:37.760
on and if any of y'all have not heard that yet it was last saturday rebel madman radio you can

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.160
find it in the archives i wanted to recommend that very much to anyone who hasn't heard it and let

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.840
me let me let you give your information again too sir uh my name is jonathan cooey you can find me

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:56.000
at giga ohmbiological.com um giga ohm is kind of a hard thing to spell it's g-i-g-a-o-h-m

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:05.360
it is uh it is a lot of ohms um not to be confused with uh giga uh what was it uh uh giga watts which

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:12.000
was on um back to the future they needed to get 1.21 gigawatts in order to go back to the future

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.120
this is giga ohm which is resistance and it's uh it's a term that came from when i was a biologist

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.880
and so i liked being a biologist and this was my way of reminding myself that i once was an

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.440
academician and no longer am so giga ohmbiological.com thanks steve

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.880
okay thanks and next up we have art in georgia art thanks very much for the call sir

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.920
well you kind of you gotta throw a monkey wrench in there on me uh because that's exactly what i

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.120
was calling in about was people in the chat room were asking what the name was in the website

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.280
but since she's already got that out of the way i will ask there's another question in the chat

01:45:51.280 --> 01:46:00.800
room and that's uh for those that might be interesting interested flotcrimelive.chattango.com

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:11.840
c-h-a-t-a-m-g-o flotcrimelive.chattango.com and it's an anonymous tech uh participant wants to

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:20.640
know if colloidal silver does any good like to support healthy guts um my long and short my

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:29.760
my short answer should really be i don't know um colloidal silver sounds like something that might

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.760
yeah i don't know that doesn't sound like something that i would necessarily use to augment my gut

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:43.680
bacteria i would really concentrate on using fermented foods so um sauerkraut yogurt fermented

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.320
vegetables this kind of thing is where you're gonna from from my understanding is much better

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:54.320
than trying to use any kind of inert substance to augment those microbes i think you should feed

01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:01.760
them not not tweak them i think you should feed them um just feed them right that's what i do i do

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:12.080
a lot of uh kimchi and kombucha i think that's probably very very good i agree i i i i like the

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:17.840
fermented foods and my i can tell you my experience with the colloidal silver back when i used to

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:25.200
suffer all the time from sinus infections constantly i would snort some of the colloidal silver but you

01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:32.000
know it never it it may help me breathe a little short term but it or kill some of those

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.800
bacteria up there but it through the the whole biome off until i stopped trying to intervene

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:45.040
and and tried to cure the problem i i i i would like to just piggyback on that because the last

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:51.200
couple collars have brought it up and i think we should all you know really reconsider the

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:57.040
importance that we attribute to the health of our guts and i really um and this is also something

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.000
that i'm learning now over the last couple years this is not something that i was preaching pre 2022

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.280
but i have come to understand and in fact you can look at the youtube channel that i was running

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:13.760
back in the day that i did a bike ride um that was actually about a study where they did an

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:20.320
anatomical tracing of neurons from the gut and they trace these neurons all the way back to

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:25.680
all kinds of different places in the brain so essentially the anatomy of a monkey if you look

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:32.000
at the connectivity between brain regions and the gut the connectivity with the gut is absolutely

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.560
extraordinary much more than what traditional you know cartoons of how the human body works in

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.840
in grade school would would describe it and in fact not only is the nervous system and the

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.040
central nervous system intimately connected to the gut but then you have this immune system

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:56.320
that is working with tolerance in the gut as as as a sort of symphony between a neurological

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:03.600
modulation of the gut processes and also an immunological modulation of the gut process so if you think

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.240
about the fact that your brain and your immune system are working in concert to decide what comes

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:14.240
in and what doesn't and what you utilize and what you don't utilize then you really almost

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.120
have summarized like 80 percent of all that it means to be human and you're talking only

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:25.680
about your brain your immune system and the microbiome of your gut and yet somewhere on the tv

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.320
covid has always been about the virus and about antibodies which have nothing to do

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.080
with the well-being and health of humans it's the scooby-doo it's the scooby-doo

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.840
diverse deception and yes that I agree completely I hey thanks very much for

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:49.120
call art and yeah hello Chad I really appreciate you guys I don't always I have sometimes my

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.160
wife will get it but I can't follow it usually while I'm talking I'm walking and talking so I

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:59.360
check it afterwards but thanks very much for calling in and giving that and next up I have a

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:06.960
fellow RBN host mr. William Rapilam hi William thanks for the call sir oh yeah hi Steven yeah

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:15.520
and hi JJ it's good to hear you um I agree with so much of what you say and I want to you know first

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:24.080
give my respects to this show and you know everything that's being discussed I wanted to address

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:32.960
something though I just want to ask you about are you familiar with Dr. Stefan Lanka I am

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:41.600
how they've debunked I am virology altogether yes using the the cell culture and he did the

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:46.080
cell culture experiment where he didn't use any sputum from a sick person got the exact same

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:53.040
result yes and then okay and then you know I just I didn't hear that kind of talked about

01:50:53.040 --> 01:51:00.240
here I don't know you mentioned being sort of more in the centrist on the germ theory versus

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:08.240
terrain theory and I I didn't really understand why you took that position there I mean I'm just

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.720
I'm trying to go after the truth whatever that is I don't really have any I can I can take it from

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.440
there I think it's a really important question because I don't want anyone listening to think

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:27.680
that I think that Stefan Lanka himself is a loony tune I think he's he's a real grandfather in

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:33.840
this in this fight against this mythology um and he was around back when you know aids and these

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:39.440
kinds of things were the feature of this mythology what I want to stress to you and everyone else

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:49.520
with this question is that there is a very big danger um in in suggesting that all previous

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:58.480
biology with regard to viruses is is is fake is very different than being wrong and versus fake

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:03.920
and I think that a lot and I'm not saying that Stefan Lanka is doing it but I am saying that there

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:11.280
are other nefarious actors who have adopted the flag of no virus and then taken it to a logical

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:18.560
extreme which is now as divorced from biological reality as the model of again a function virus

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:25.360
that can that can accurately transcribe itself for five years straight there are both at this stage

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:31.200
there are people representing both sides of that equation in a ridiculous sense and the reason why

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:39.600
the no virus in the extreme is ridiculous is because it discounts often discounts the idea that

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:47.200
there are viruses at all and we know and I assure you that even Stefan Lanka knows that there are

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:53.280
viruses that carry genetic signals between bacteria there are viruses that carry genetic

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:58.800
signals between plankton and the ocean there are genetic signals that carry or there are viruses

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:08.240
that carry genetic signals between the the roots of trees and the the the rhizomes of the fungi that

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.600
are symbiotic with them in the soil so we know there are virus particles that are released in

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:19.200
the brain that that take RNA from one neuron to another there are endogenous viruses that are

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:27.200
responsible for moving pieces of RNA between our gamete chromosomes and actually crossing over

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:32.640
the reassortment of genes it gives us all of the variation in our children his is actually

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:39.840
modulated by endogenous viruses so we understand that these signals exist we understand that they're

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:46.800
there but what has been identified by these no virus people is the idea that these signals are

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:53.520
responsible for disease and they are not but remember that's different than saying that there are no

01:53:53.520 --> 01:54:02.480
signals yes exactly and I so I want you to understand that I agree with them sure sure okay so this is

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:07.760
I don't know who you're speaking up to take no virus but I you know I listen to Dr. Tom Cowan

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.800
I listen to you know Dr. Andrew Kaufman and then there there's a lot of people in their camp

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:20.480
there is like the couple from Mark and Sam Bailey and they have been asking the people that are

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:27.760
saying that viruses are pathogenic to come to the table and debate them and you know there have

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:34.720
been a couple of attempts and they've absolutely failed they'll because their basis on their science

01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:44.400
is based on a computer model they don't even use the cell culture anymore to organically produce

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:50.960
an actual genome can I can I interrupt here just to make sure just can I interrupt here

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.240
can I interrupt here because I really want you to understand that I'm not arguing with you that

01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.680
I wait wait wait wait wait real quick let me just let me just compound that I did understand what

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:07.840
you said okay you're talking about viruses now if we were to find what is a virus right it's a

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:14.320
we agree that it's a it's a it's a strand of either RNA or DNA that's wrapped in a lipid coat

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.040
is that is that your understanding because that's the mainstream definition of what a virus is

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:26.080
and then the other question I would pose on that is that is it not an exosome well okay so you

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.640
you're opposing there you're putting questions and I love the questions but I really wanted to

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:36.480
interrupt you because I need to make an important point here and that is that when I was still

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:44.640
a consultant for Robert F Kennedy junior I reached out on behalf of CHD and I tried to make a bridge

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:52.480
with these no-virus people very specifically about the idea that RNA virology is a hoax and that

01:55:52.480 --> 01:56:02.320
actually RNA virology is based on a bedrock methodology of RNA clones so they find sequences

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:10.160
in the wild they make a lot of DNA and then they convert that DNA to RNA and then that RNA will cause

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.840
cytopathic effects that RNA will cause an immune reaction in an animal if you inject it in their

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:22.720
nose that RNA will cause a sequencing reaction that's highly robust in a cell culture and so

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:32.880
all of the illusion of RNA virology can be created using laboratory proven bench techniques for

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:39.920
DNA manufacture and RNA manufacture and I reached out to the no-virus people two years ago to try

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:47.920
and explain to them that virology could use RNA infectious clones to lie about RNA virology

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:55.120
as a field and they chose to do one thing and one thing only and that is to discredit me

01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:01.440
to call me a liar and to try to get me fired they didn't reach out and say oh let's hear more about

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:07.520
how it is that everybody could be fooled I'm talking about Christine Massey I'm talking about

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:13.120
Tom Cowan I'm talking about Alex Zeck and I'm talking about the two Bailey's all of them

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.240
I reached out to the Bailey's in 2020 and they told me they couldn't do an interview because she

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:24.160
was having a baby and then after that it was over no one would talk to me the moment they reach out

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.840
and say wow it's interesting that you've been trying to say that RNA RNA infectious clones could be

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:34.480
used to create the illusion of a pandemic because we didn't understand that's what you were saying

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.560
when we tried to ruin your family's life last year that's what I would like

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.040
because I got myself fired twice already for fighting through this biology and twice I've

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:50.880
tried to reach out to them to find out what they're saying and they have ignored me and instead tried

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.960
to lambast me and that's unfortunate because I want to I want to make a bridge here

01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.560
I know I'm I'm dubious about this I I've got to because I've been listening to them for years

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:06.640
they've been trying to get somebody to come to the table every once in a while somebody will

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:10.880
but you're saying that they've taken you and they've swept you under the rug and covered you up

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.920
you can watch the video my friend there's a video with all there's a video with all five of them

01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:21.520
addressing me and when they address me they insult me and they say that clones are imaginary

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:27.760
and I'm actually arguing that viruses are imaginary and they use clones to create the illusion and

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.440
they're ignoring me why would they ignore that why would they ignore that what do they do

01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:40.080
what do these clones actually do they create the molecular signal that they say is impossible

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:46.000
which is a high fidelity RNA signal that can be sequenced using PCR and using Sanger sequencing

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.440
which they say is an illusion but it's not in the context of clones it's always been an illusion

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:57.440
in the context of these stupid bats but it's not an illusion when it comes to making DNA on a bench

01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.320
they've been able to make DNA on a bench at high fidelity for 20 years and so the fact that

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:06.960
they've told you that oh we found this genetic signal it suggests that they could just put it

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:11.920
there and I've been arguing that from the beginning but it's not just that they're lying about they're

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:17.200
being viruses it's they're lying about the fidelity of this signal and they've placed it there and

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:26.240
told you it's viruses I'm trying to help them and they won't listen okay so they're not saying this

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:31.680
obviously because they don't report that viruses cause disease or pathogenic or

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.680
that they actually they won't have a discussion about how the illusion is created they just

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:43.840
want me to argue about isolation and and purification and I've already admitted that they can't do

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.640
that so let's have a discussion about what RNA clones are let's have a discussion about what

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:56.480
all these papers are and they won't okay all right well let me let me ask you something let me

01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:05.520
ask you this okay so you have this lipid coded DNA sequence and it's claimed by mainstream science

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:11.360
that what happens is that DNA sequence will get into the cell biology cell you know machinery

02:00:11.360 --> 02:00:16.960
and it will bind to the other DNA sequences in that cell machinery and in fact the in fact

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.640
uh and it actually starts then it would start replicating but by itself it's totally inert

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.280
without having to I spend hours and hours every night telling people that this is a lie that this

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:34.480
is not true that it's not possible for a cell to do something that it doesn't already do it's like

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:39.280
saying that you can take a cuckoo clock and make it to make toast you can't do that you can make a

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.160
cuckoo clock ding at the wrong time and you can make it read the wrong clock the wrong time but

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.120
you can't make it make toast and a virus cannot make a cell do something that it doesn't already

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:54.320
do and that's why viruses are just hijacking the machinery of exosomes which is something I've

02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:01.360
also been saying for three freaking years come on yeah listen what I what I heard you explained

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:10.080
it was that these virology the cart was before the horse that exosomal biology should have been

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:14.160
the basis of virology of course it should have been of course it should have been

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:21.440
of course of course because they're purporting to analyze a signal that is predominated at this

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.960
size scale by signals that are endogenous and instead people like Nathan wolf and all of

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:31.840
others have convinced us that at this size scale the only thing that exists are viral pathogens

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:38.000
there's no endogenous communication there's no there's no signaling here it's just all viruses

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.600
and this is the lie this is the lie okay okay let let me let me try to understand okay so you

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:51.120
hey you're okay yeah i'm sorry i don't want to interrupt you we've got a couple more callers with

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:59.600
i i really appreciate uh i i hope that dr kooie will return people i've got a look people would

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:05.360
love to hear this again the more of this i think uh jj let me bring that up before we run out of time

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:08.400
uh i'm available every Saturday that you are my friend

02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:16.240
terrific and hey can you can you stay with can you take the callers to yeah of course is that cool

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:20.800
can you stay and do you want to handle these yeah if you can we got two more callers here if you

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.520
want to hang out is that cool if we're trying to get through them before i go it's bob and utah

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:32.160
first bob thanks very much for the call you have a quick question for a jj jj yeah good job

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:39.600
william uh you covered most of uh what we expected i want to ask about the infectious clones what

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:48.880
exactly is the process uh by which uh these are synthesized or created in the lab um so it's a

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:53.840
it's a pretty standard technique that they're trying to give uh ralph barrick extra credit for

02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:01.360
having developed but in reality um molecular biology on the bench has been creating DNA sequences

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:06.400
from scratch and cutting them into pieces and getting them to stick together again in the ways

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.920
that that they would like them to do that's how all molecular biology and academia is done and so

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:18.080
what what they've done with corona viruses is really weird because when they find corona viruses

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:24.960
before the pandemic they find a signal of RNA as signal meaning that they they can hear some noise

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:31.600
on a radio or they can find uh the the signs of somebody having been in a garage but they don't

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:37.920
have the person they haven't caught the intruder they've just found a sign and from that sign they

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:43.760
can they can purport to create recreate the whole intruder and so from this perspective what they're

02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:51.040
doing usually before the pandemic was they were looking for a particularly conserved gene only

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:58.160
about 300 base pairs long and if they found that sorry what looking where looking in a bat

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:05.040
up there in a bat in a bat in a bat anus in people's lungs in whatever in some kind of sample they're

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:12.320
looking for an RNA signal which they can use PCR to find but that does not mean that that signal is

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:18.560
specific for something but they claimed it was now they've been telling us a story that if they

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:24.560
look with PCR they can also find other genes present in these in these bats but for some reason

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.480
when they put this into culture it never grows so the way that they have overcome this problem

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:37.600
is by assembling what they call a synthetic corona virus genome now is this a real thing

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:42.480
you're going to have to argue with these scientists about it but they claim to have found these genes

02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:49.200
in the wild and if they assemble these genes using synthetic DNA then they can create some of

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:56.080
the effects of viruses in cell culture and in animals so what i'm telling you is that for the

02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:05.200
last 15 years corona virus biology is based on one RNA signals that they claim to find in the wild

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:12.240
and two synthetic guys asked about in the lab hello i'm still talking i'm still talking

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:19.520
so so they they find this sequence in the wild and they create a DNA copy of it now the reason why

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:25.680
that's important is because the RNA signal like a cake can't just be put back in the oven and then

02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:30.400
you pull out two cakes and then put the cake in the oven again you pull out three cakes RNA doesn't

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:36.880
work that way but DNA is like a recipe i can make lots of copies of the DNA recipe

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:43.840
so then what i'm suggesting to you is is that unlike virology where you can't grow a lot of a

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:50.960
virus if i wanted to make a lot of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence i could make a lot of it i could make a

02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:55.600
truckload of it and then i could spread it out in different bottles and i could spill it in different

02:05:55.600 --> 02:06:00.240
countries and wherever you looked wherever you looked for the PCR test

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:10.640
no no and that's the point that's the point no you cannot they in order to find this sequence in

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:16.560
the wild they need a hundred different primer pairs which makes it possible for a hundred

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:22.000
different error signals a hundred different false positives to result in them saying look we found

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:32.160
this sequence it's complete nonsense when i say clone they are making a pure RNA and they are

02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:36.960
telling you that that pure RNA is natural that's what i'm saying and it's not it would be like saying

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:42.720
we're gonna make a million uniforms for an NBA team and then we're gonna say that's evidence that

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.840
this NBA team is popular that's not how this works

02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:55.040
yes okay let me say this i don't want to are you with you because i know you've had a rough time

02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:02.240
and you've changed your views a lot i want to talk to other people out there if if if there are no

02:07:02.240 --> 02:07:08.560
real contagious viruses in reality i'm sorry to cut you off i'm sorry to cut you off bob we we're

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:14.800
coming up on the end of the show and i apologize to brian uh in uh washington uh we're not but

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:19.520
listen i really want to thank you again for joining me terrific show i hope you'll join me again
