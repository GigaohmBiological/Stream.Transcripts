00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
The Truth

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
You

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Let it in my world

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Like it's your little toy

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
You were gone in my head

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And you hide from my head

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
And you turn it from the first bullet sight

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
And you turn it from the first bullet sight

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
You're the master of war

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
You

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Like dreams of old you lying they see

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
Whole war can be won, you want me to believe

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Where I see through your eyes and I see through your brain

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Like I see through the water that's rockin' my train

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
Like I see through the water and runnin' down my train

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
You're the best in all triggers for the others to fire

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
And you sit back and watch while the death count gets higher

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
You hide in your mansion while the young people fly

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Through the good body to be prepared

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
You're the best in the world

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
Welcome back y'all, you're listening to Thought Crime Live on Republic Broadcasting Network

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
This is our two of Thought Crime Live for February the 3rd, 2024

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Well, time sure is flyin' and I'm joined today by Dr. Jonathan Cooey

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
J.J. Cooey of gigaombiological.com

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
And we've just been comin' thought crimes here

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Talkin' a lot about the biology and the cyop that was known as COVID

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
And let me turn it back to you, sir

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I've already gotten a lot of feedback from people saying

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
You should be a regular guest and I knew that they would feel that way

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I've learned a great deal from following your stream

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And if you guys have a question for J.J. too

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Let me toss this out to y'all

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
If you would like to have a question, it's 512-248-8252

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
We will take callers this hour

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yes, sir, please go ahead

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
So I would like to just put a shout out there

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
For people not only to look for gigaombiological

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And join my streams and listen to my broadcast

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
But I would like you to try and locate someone by the name of Jessica Hockett

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And locate someone by the name of Mark Koolack

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Who streams under the name Mark Hewson-Tonic Live on YouTube

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
He recently lost his main channel because he covers some of the very same stuff that I cover

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Some of these people are better at seeing this elephant from other sides

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Another person that I'd really like your viewers to become familiar with

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Is a guy by the name of Denny D-E-N-I-S

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Denny Rancor

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
He is a Canadian, used to be a physicist and professor of physics

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
But lost his job after an extended battle over free speech with the faculty

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
He won that case eventually

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And so now he's just kind of a free thinker

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And he has done a lot of analysis on all-cause mortality

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So just for your viewers out there real quick

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Run through all-cause mortality is just what it sounds like

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
All the people that have died every year

04:53.000 --> 05:04.000
In America, it might be a surprise to some people that between 2,700,000 and 3,000,000 Americans die every year

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
Which is somewhere between 50 and 65,000 Americans every week, every year, all the time

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
And so when they were telling us that there were 1,000 people dying of COVID

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And giving us no context in which to process that number

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
Sounds like a slaughter bath, but if they had told you that every week in America

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
We expect between 55 and 65,000 Americans to pass away from all causes

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Then it would be into a context that you might better be able to understand

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
Now imagine if they had taken this and said that every year we lose about 15,000 people to unexplained pneumonia

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
And we save about another 50,000 people from unexplained pneumonia every year

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
And the way we do it is broad spectrum antibiotics and some steroids if it goes nuts

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
And we stopped doing that and the deaths from secondary pneumonia went up as high as triple

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
They've ever been in the last two decades

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
And so there are some fundamental aspects of how the medicine was executed

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
How medicine was changed at the start of the pandemic that has been confounded as evidence of a spreading pathogen

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
When really it feels a lot more in retrospect like it was evidence of some spreading bad ideas

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
I very, very well put someone wanted me to ask did you think there was any link with the 5G and they spread it all

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
I mean that some people have speculated on that too, they just wanted your opinion on that

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
Well, I mean the 5G at the beginning of the pandemic was used more as a distraction

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
And so I can tell you that there were quite a few people that I was interacting with at the beginning of the pandemic

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
Behind the scenes that were insistent that one of the ways that the Chinese government or whoever was attacking us

06:55.000 --> 07:06.000
With this novel pathogen was going to work against us was going to confuse people by saying that the rollout of 5G was actually what they were doing

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
And that this whole Covid thing was a cover up and so it's interesting that 5G was one of these major narratives that was tied into the beginning

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
But then also the brass packs on the ground is that in a lot of places around the world they were indeed rolling out 5G towers at the start of the Covid pandemic

07:26.000 --> 07:37.000
So it is not something that can be discounted but what you need to see as a passive or casual viewer of this very interesting time in history

07:37.000 --> 07:52.000
Is to see how aggressively the issue of 5G, its technology, its potential danger for your children was completely confounded with the presence of a pathogen

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
And so instead of legitimately questioning whether or not these high powered towers should be near residential areas

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
We were instead arguing about whether 5G was capable of interacting with some nanoparticle that they may or may not have released

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
And so by having us get into these very vigorous discussions and these very limited debates that have nothing to do with reality

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
We have neither effectively questioned the spread of a novel pathogen nor have we effectively questioned the safety of 5G

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And 5 years later we're still asking the wrong questions about both of these issues

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
And we have yet to question or hold the pharmaceutical companies liable for the vaccine

08:34.000 --> 08:44.000
So you know I wish I had never been vaccinated and I was bamboozled into taking something to the H1N1 scyop

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
You know I was damaged by those and pharmaceuticals harmed me

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
I mean that's a whole other subject but I'm so much better without big pharma

08:56.000 --> 09:06.000
That's not beneficial to humans, I can't believe people are still buying into that

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
And it's killing people I care about, you were talking about some people maybe have to be left behind or whatever

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
That breaks my heart sometimes, I know that this thing is daunting

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
And we have to talk to the kids, you mentioned that too

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Let me, we have some caller already, let me get the caller's question here

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Patrick and Texas, Patrick you have a question for Jonathan

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
I do, I think the doctor's gonna be a great asset for our people

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
There's a Rockefeller all-pathic medicine

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Even before Rockefeller it was corrupt

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
They were always, they would not do what the Indians did

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
They used steaming tents, natural remedies were very effective

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Ten times more effective than the point that they were feeding the people

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Except for mercury and stuff like that

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
But you know, the thing about it is like

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
There's a 5G, there's so sensitive, there's a study where there's a classroom

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Where all the kids came down with leukemia or vast majority of them

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
And they found out that they were not opening the windows and letting sunlight come in

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
And it was all about the light, they weren't getting, we're so sensitive

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Just a simple thing is light, a full spectrum of light

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Can lead to an outbreak of leukemia

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
What about 5G? What's that gonna do to us?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
It's gonna give us all brain tumors, I don't know

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
But you know, I think, you know

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
Is this a Rockefeller all-pathic medicine that's sparked this?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Or is it what the corrupts before this?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Or why are all the doctors so complicit?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
It's a good question, you know

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Part of it has to do with the way that they're educated

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I think a large fraction of it has to do with the way that they're educated

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
I mean, if you talk to the average medical school graduate now

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
You're gonna find that they may not even have a real immunology class

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
They certainly don't have a vaccinology class, even though we've heard for the last three years

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
That there are all these people that call themselves vaccinologists

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
I don't know where they learn their trade or what school they trained in

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Because it seems like a moniker that you just claim when you're on this train

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Where you think that vaccines are great

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
And I don't necessarily have the receipts to say that it goes right back to the Rockefeller family

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
But I don't think that anyone would argue with the idea that the Rockefeller's fundamentally changed

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
The way that medicine existed in the United States

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
By using weaponized piles of money to influence the way that medicine was taught

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
And influence the foundational principles of medicine to

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Rather than looking at the patient as a whole

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And trying to decide what they're doing wrong

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
That you could bring them back to well-being

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
You try to think of something that you can give them that comes from your product line

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And again, this was, you know, what do we do with all these chemicals that we get from the oil industry

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
What do we do with all this extra stuff that we have and we're finding

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
They realized that this could all be products

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
If we could be convinced that these things were had medicinal value

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
So I don't want to discard the callers

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
I mean, he's definitely right that they have a seminal role in this

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
But I also want to caution everybody listening to not think that it's as simple as the Rockefellers

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Because the Rockefellers is actually a pretty mainstream answer to this problem

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
And I want to encourage everybody that any of these

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
So, you know, right in front of your face answers to this problem are likely to be incorrect

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Or at least incorrect enough so that we're not going to get the touchdown that we want

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
By saying it was the Rockefellers

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
We've got to go against, we've got to go first of all

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
We need to make sure that we isolate live people and people that are currently

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
At the heads of these weaponized piles of money

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Because that's really what it is

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
We're dealing with piles of money that are so big that governments have to listen to them

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And that is the unseen force that's working in the background

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't know who or what their names are

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
But I do know that there are piles of money that are so big

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
That they can influence individuals and influence whole governments

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
And that's where this whole problem lies

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Because we think as people that watch TV

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
That the way that we excise ourselves from this situation

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Is to elect the right people

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
But if all of the people that we are allowed to elect

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Are already under the auspices of these large piles of money

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Then we are electing nobody and we are never really going to get out of this

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Terrific answer, Ned

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Thank you for your call, Patrick

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, I'll point, I say that you can vote for the puppets

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
But you never get to vote for the puppeteer

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That's well put, sir

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Next up we have Sherry in Kansas

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Sherry, thank you very much for the call

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Do we have Sherry?

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Um, Jay Jay, I'll tell you up front

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm more of a trained, scary type person than germ theory

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
But, and I do believe that it's a lot of people just don't

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Detoxify because of all the crap they're putting in

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
But, and then crap in our environment

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
But, I've heard people say that if you're talking like

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
The number of shelves you have in our skin sheet

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
That a lot more of them are not considered our DNA

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
But we couldn't live without them

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
And so, when you talk about the 5G and all this

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
This wireless energy in our environment

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
I mean, it's got to be infecting stuff that keeps us healthy

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
Like those little bacteria and everything in our microbiome

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
With their active denial systems

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
We know they can cause people to crap

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
And they can cause people to change emotions

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
They can be infecting that stuff too

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I was going to wait to finish there

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I completely agree

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
The terrain and germ theory debate is actually another one of these

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
You know, one side wins, the other side loses kind of thing

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
If you fight for one of those as being the dominant theory

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Then you're not really fighting for the middle ground there

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Which is really what we should be fighting for

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I agree totally with your assessment

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
And I would have gone there already with the previous caller

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
In the sense of saying that

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
The United States as a culture

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Unfortunately, the masses

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
The TV watching masses are not taking care of themselves

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And they haven't taken care of themselves for 20 years

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Because the food hasn't been available

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
The culture tells them to sit on their couch and watch TV

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
And being overweight and unhealthy has become just what Americans are

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
And this is a fundamental thing that gets ignored

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Every time that these people go to the doctor's office

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
The doctor doesn't start with

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, if you wouldn't have mistreated your body for the last 25 years

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
We wouldn't be here

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
And so maybe we should reverse some of those habits that are

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
That brought you to this stage

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
They are just looking for the product that they should give out

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
The product that they should sell

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
The product they should prescribe

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
And so these issues I think can't be underestimated

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
And so if you can teach the children

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And teach young people that

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
That just by watching the amount of crap

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Comes into their body

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Just by drinking clean water

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Just by maintaining as you said

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
The microbes in their gut

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
The microbes on their skin

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
And not using antibiotics all the time

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Not using products that disrupt the microbiome

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
We, as you said, understand that a diverse and well-functioning microbiome

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Results in well-being

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
In the sense of less depression

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It results in more energy

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
It results in better health

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It results in lower weight

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All of these things

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
And we can't underestimate how the American culture with processed foods

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
It's kind of making it almost a requirement

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
If you're going to consume these products

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Then you're going to have a microbiome

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And you're going to have an immune system

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
That is necessarily compromised

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
If you expose your skin to these cosmetics

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
That have these untested or unproven chemicals

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
In them over years

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Then you're going to develop immune abnormalities

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
You're going to develop digestive and metabolic abnormalities

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
That cannot be explained by our understanding of a healthy body

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And they cannot be explained by our understanding of how pharmaceuticals work

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Or don't work because we are not

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
At starting at the foundation

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Which is what have you done to your sacred biology

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
To set it out of balance

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And how long have you been doing those things

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And those are questions that we don't ask

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And I'm assuming or hoping that

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
That's really the kind of point you want to make

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
And I totally agree

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Yes sir, it does

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That was the park again

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
With your guest

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Thanks Sherry, hey

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
We'll be right back after the break y'all

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Thanks for the call Sherry

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Be right back folks

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
I'm marching

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Outside my window in the rain

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I play checkers

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm sick of checkers

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I'm sick of pain

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Outside my window in the rain

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
I play checkers

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I'm sick of checkers

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm sick of pain

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Outside my window in the rain

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I'm sick of checkers

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
I'm sick of checkers

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
I'm sick of pain

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm sick of pain

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Mondays every Monday

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I see my hall of wine

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I like pain with

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
My name is John

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
I'm the founder of Blackout Coffee

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
And I started Blackout

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Because I really love coffee

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I've always loved coffee

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And after traveling so much to Europe, South America

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
In trying so many different coffees

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
They were so good

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
And every time I came back to the US

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I was so disappointed with the coffee

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So I figured that I had to do something about it

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
The biggest difference is

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Really is on the beans

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
And the roasting process

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
How we roast it

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And I'll fresh it in

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
The fresh of the roast, the bed of the quality

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Here I have like all of the coffee

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's roasted within one to two days

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Prior to being shipped

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
So it literally gets to consumers' house

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Within three to five days after being roasted

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
If you like coffee

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
You have to try ours

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
It's fresh roasted

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It's one of the best beans that we can get

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And you will definitely see the difference

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
This is Blackout Coffee.com

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Use the coupon code REPUB10

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
That's REPUB10

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you truly want to stay out of the system?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
Are you prepared to buy into the biggest scam

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Since the Iraqi Denar?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
If not, then put your money where it belongs

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
In your possession

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Not in the hands of an international MLM cartel

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
At Kettle Marine Limited

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000

With elusive gold backing

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Gold backing

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
The only gold that I want

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Is in my back pocket

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Not backed by promises of an operation

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Is suspect of

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Giving a rating of C-minus

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000

And go to the Valkombe Bullion Vault

Once you have read the whole story about the scam

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Being perpetrated on an unsuspecting public

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And how you can avoid being a victim

Standing will break in the wind

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
I hope it ain't great my step don't fall tight

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I'd rather be breathing

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Than something I've been

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
You won't have me like

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Jonathan Siegel

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
He tried to find

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
All his way

Ain't no need to be born

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
It's a great life

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
If you know we can

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It's a great life

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
If you're trying to be strong

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Turn your head and face the season

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Right the wind before it's gone

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Oh it's the sound of the river

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And welcome back y'all

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Welcome back y'all

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
You're listening to Fall Crime Live

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
On Republic Broadcasting Network

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm Steven Douglas White

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
And your host

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I really appreciate you joining me

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
We were talking to Sherry in Kansas

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
And I appreciate those

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Work kind work Sherry

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
This man has taught me a lot

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
That I've followed his

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Streams on Giga on biological

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And in response to something that you said

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
You could see the result of me getting rid of big pharma

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And trying to readjust

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I think it might be on my page in R.B.M.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
But if you go to my Facebook

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Or Twitter

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
The Facebook page has

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
The pictures of how I looked

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
The day I started on R.B.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I was sitting on a little red ball

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I sat at Target

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
And two years later

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
So I made a lot of changes

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
And I try to

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm not trying to brag about it

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
So much I feel like it's

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Kind of prideful

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I say that sometimes

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
But I won't encourage anybody

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That thinks they can't make changes

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
In themselves

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Look I did this

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
You can do it too

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
You know people

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Inspired me to try

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
And you guys, R.B.M.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Was like a family to me too

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
You know it just

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Knowing that people were listening

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Really had an effect on me

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I want to thank all the listeners

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
For that too

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
And ask you please

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Keep R.B.M. and keep these

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Conversations going too

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
And with that

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Let me go to the next caller

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
We have Bill and Kentucky

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Thanks for calling Bill

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Hey, good talk to you again

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Stephen, talk to you

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
A couple nights

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
You're in Blackburn

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
One thing that you have changed

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
To besides

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Look like you're a better health

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
And lost a lot of weight

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
And everything

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
You got a lot more hair

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You got more like

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Robert Planter

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, I am that long-haired

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Country boy, that's true

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
You have a question for J.J. Sir?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Yes, I do.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I very much do.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
What do you know about

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
That I keep hearing about

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The Z-X or pandemic

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Or epidemic eggs

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Do you have any inkling

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Or what that may be

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Or is that just a rumor or a

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
What?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Bill, unfortunately

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Disease X was a

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Generic term for the

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Next pandemic

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
And it was already in use

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I believe the first time

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Really in 2018

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And it is something that

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
In these circles

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Of bureaucrats and

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Government operatives

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
It means the next pandemic

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
And so

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
They're recycling this term

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And they have never used it

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
At the W.E.F.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Until this year

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And so I do really think

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
That this is a media campaign

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
To give you

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
More reinforcing ideas

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That there is another

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Pandemic coming

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And it's very likely to come

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
And so they have to have

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
This plan for disease X

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And the idea is to imply

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
That there are a number

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Of different possibilities

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
And that's why they call it

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Disease X. I don't at all

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Believe that this is a threat

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
To our children or to us

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
But I do believe that there are

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Ways using lies

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And using other biotechnology

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
That they could fool us

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Into believing that there was

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
A disease X

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And so that's the kind of

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
That's the kind of biology

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I'm trying to teach

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
And trying to get everybody

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
To understand that

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
There are tools

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
There are molecular

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Biological tools and signals

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
That could be used

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And misconstrued as spread

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
And whether or not they did

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That this time is up for grabs

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Because it's a criminal

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Investigation or at least it

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Should be so I don't have

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
The answers

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
But whether they could use it

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
The next time is without a

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Doubt certain

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
They could definitely use

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
The biology that I've

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Described to create the

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Next illusion of a pandemic

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And I don't think this time

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
They'll fool around

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't think this time they

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Will go

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Use any half measures

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
And that's what I'm most

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Afraid about

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
So if we can get our children

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
To understand this mythology

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Before they pull that alarm

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It would be really great

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
So that's what disease X is

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
In a nutshell

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
So thanks for the call

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
One of the things I want to say

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
This is not a guarantee

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I'll never get it or anything

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
But I'm so far missed

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Having the

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
You know, having COVID

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I've had that

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I think 50 milligrams

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Everyday vitamin C

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Well, we're coming up

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
On the break, sir.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I'm sorry to interrupt you

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Can you hold on to the

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
After the break?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Oh, no, that's okay.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
I'll just go on.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Thanks for the call, sir.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Appreciate you listening, sir.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Thanks for the call.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
I always appreciate your input.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Be right back, folks.

29:01.000 --> 29:09.000
In its high, oh, hey

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
I am a white destroyer

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Or I will show you silver and gold

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
And I will bring you treasure

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
I will wave a widowing flag

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
And I will be your lover

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
And I will show you grotto

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
And cave and cypher of fish all over

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
And I will show you

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I want the truth!

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
You can't handle the truth!

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
You're listening to

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Republic Broadcasting Network

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Real news, real talk, real people

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Because you can handle the truth!

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
People often write to tell us

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
What has happened for them since

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Starting Extendivite?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Allow me to read a few.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
After taking Extendivite for about six months

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I've noticed improvement on the numbness of my hands and wrists

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
From the carpal tunnel syndrome

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I will continue to buy product.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
This formula is very powerful.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I am feeling much better.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
My heart rate and blood pressure is stabilized

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
My lower edema has reduced

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
And lower leg pain due to blood clots has disappeared

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
This product has relieved what appears to be an angina problem

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Pain in the chest after climbing stairs

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And short on breath

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
I'm quite happy about it

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
To order, call 1-877-928-8822

With our remote control

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
That sounds great, but can I afford it?

Sure, and the ease-off installs fast

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000

To the sea star

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
People say, well I'm no good

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I'm crazy, I have to live

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
Shocking stone in the moment

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I get drunk in the afternoon

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Trying to lock me off

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And lock me off to the town

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And lock me around in the shade

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
And I ain't got no money

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But the damn show got it made

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I ain't asking nobody for nothing

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
If I can't get it on my own

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
If you don't lock the way I'm living

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Just leave the throne here

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Took the poor alone

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Welcome back y'all

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You're listening to

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Thought crime live on Republic broadcast

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
The network got a lot of GG

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And I just caught it

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Echo there somehow

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I don't know why that happened

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
But

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Am I coming?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Yeah, it's still okay, now it's gone

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Thanks, I don't know what that was

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Sorry folks, I had a little echo

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
But listen, thanks for joining me

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I'm joined by Jonathan

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Dr. Jonathan Cooey, JJ Cooey

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And I want to let you give your

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Sight out again for all the listeners

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I'm sure that they would like to know that

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
And also I wanted to mention to the folks

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
In your stream that

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
If they've never listened to RBN before

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Last, I wanted to recommend that last Saturday

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
I had a show

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
All was on Mike Gaddy's

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Rebel Madman radio show

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
We had the USS Liberty survivors

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And any of y'all have not heard that yet

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
It was last Saturday

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
You can find it in the archives

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
I wanted to recommend that

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Very much to anyone who hasn't heard it

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Let me let you give your information

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Again, too, sir

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
My name is Jonathan Cooey

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
You can find me at

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
GigaOMbiological.com

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
GigaOM is kind of a hard thing to spell

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
It's G-I-G-A-O-H-M

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
It is a lot of homes

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
Not to be confused with Giga

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What was it?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Giga Watts, which was on

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Back to the future

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
They needed to get 1.21 Giga Watts

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
In order to go back to the future

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
This is GigaOM, which is resistance

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And it's a term that came from

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
When I was a biologist

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And so I liked being a biologist

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And this was my way of reminding myself

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
That I once was an

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Academician and no longer am

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So GigaOMbiological.com

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
Thanks, Steve

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Okay, thanks

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And next up we have Art in Georgia

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Art, thanks very much for the call, sir

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Well, you kind of threw a monkey wrench

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
In there on me, because that's exactly

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What I was calling in about

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Was people in the chat room were asking

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
What the name was in the website

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
But since she's already got that out of the way

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
I will ask, there's another question

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
In the chat room

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And that's, for those that might be

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Interesting, interested

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
Thoughtcrimelive.chattango.com

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
C-H-A-T-A-M-G-O

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Thoughtcrimelive.chattango.com

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
And it's an anonymous

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
participant

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Who wants to know if

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Colloidal Silver does any good

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Like to support healthy guts?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
My long and short

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
My short answer should really be

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
I don't know

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Colloidal Silver

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Sounds like something that

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Might

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, I don't know, that doesn't sound like

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Something that I would necessarily use

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
To augment my gut bacteria

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I would really concentrate on

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Using fermented foods

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
So sauerkraut, yogurt, fermented vegetables

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
This kind of thing is where you're going

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
From my understanding is much better than

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Trying to use any kind of inert substance

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
To augment those microbes

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I think you should feed them

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Not sweet them, I think you should feed them

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Just feed them

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
That's what I do, I do a lot of

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Kimchi and kombucha

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I think that's probably very, very good

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I agree, I like the fermented foods

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
And I can tell you my experience

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
With the Colloidal Silver

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Back when I used to suffer

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
All the time from sinus infections

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Constantly, I would snort some

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Of the Colloidal Silver

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
But, you know, it never

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
It may help me breathe a little short-term

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
But it or kill some of those bacteria up there

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
But it threw the whole biome off

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Until I stopped trying to intervene

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
And tried to cure the problem

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
I would like to just piggyback on that

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Because the last couple of callers have brought it up

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
And I think we should all

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You know, really reconsider

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The importance that we attribute

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
To the health of our guts

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
And this is also something

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
That I'm learning now over the last couple of years

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This is not something that I was preaching

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Pre 2022

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
But I have come to understand

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
And in fact, you can look at the YouTube channel

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
That I was running back in the day

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
That I did a bike ride

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
That was actually about a study

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Where they did an anatomical tracing

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Of neurons from the gut

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And they traced these neurons

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
All the way back to

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
All kinds of different places in the brain

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So essentially the anatomy of a monkey

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
If you look at the

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Connectivity between brain regions

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And the gut, the connectivity with the gut

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Is absolutely extraordinary

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Much more than what

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Traditional cartoons

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Of how the human body works

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
In grade school would describe it

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
And in fact, not only is the nervous system

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And the central nervous system

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Intimately connected to the gut

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
But then you have this immune system

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
That is working with tolerance

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
In the gut

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
As a sort of symphony

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Between a neurological

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Modulation of the gut processes

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And also an immunological

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Modulation of the gut process

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
So if you think about the fact

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That your brain and your immune system

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Are working in concert

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Decide what comes in and what doesn't

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And what you utilize

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
And what you don't utilize

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
And you have summarized like

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
80% of all that it means to be human

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
And you're talking only about

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Your brain, your immune system

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
And the microbiome of your gut

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
And yet somewhere

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
On the TV, COVID has always been

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
About the virus and about antibodies

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Which have nothing to do with the

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Well-being and health of humans

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
It's the Scooby-Doo

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Deversed deception

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And yes, I agree completely

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Hey, thanks very much

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And yeah, hello Chad, I really

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Appreciate you guys

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
I don't always

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Sometimes my wife will get it

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
But I can't follow it

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Usually while I'm talking, I'm walking

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And talking, so I check it afterwards

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
But thanks very much for calling in

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
And giving that

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
And next up, I have a fellow

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
RBN host, Mr. William Rapillum

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Hi, William, thanks for the call, sir

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Oh, yeah, hi, Steven

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah, and hi, JJ

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I agree with so much of what you say

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And I want to, you know, first

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Give my respects to

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
This show and, you know, everything

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
That's being discussed

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I wanted to address

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Something, though, I just want to ask you

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
About, are you familiar with

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Dr. Steph on Lanka

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
And how they get bumped

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I have virology all together

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Yeah, using the cell culture

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And he did the cell culture

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Experiment where he didn't use

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And he spewed them from a sick person

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Got the exact same result

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And then, okay, and then

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
You know, I just, I didn't hear that

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Kind of talked about here

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I don't know, you mentioned

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Being sort of more in the centrist

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
On the German theory

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Versus terrain theory

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And I didn't really understand

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Why you took that position

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
There, I mean, I'm just

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I'm trying to go

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
After the truth, whatever that is

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I don't really have any

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I can take it from there

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I think it's a really

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Important question because

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I don't want anyone

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Listening to think that I think

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
That Steph and Lanka himself

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Is a looney tune, I think he's

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
He's a real grandfather in this

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Fight against this mythology

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And he was around back when

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
You know, AIDS and these kinds of

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Things were the feature of this

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Mythology. What I want to stress

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
To you and everyone else with

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
This question is that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
There is a very big danger

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
In

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
In suggesting that

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
All previous biology

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
With regard to viruses is

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Is fake

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Is very different than being

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Wrong and versus fake

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And I think that a lot, and I

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Not saying that Steph and

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
But I am saying that there

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Are other nefarious actors

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Who have adopted the flag of

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
No virus and then taken

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
It to a logical extreme

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Which is now as divorced

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
From biological reality

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
As the model of again a function

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Virus that can accurately

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Transcribe itself for five

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Years straight. There are both

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
At this stage, there are people

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Representing both sides of that

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Equation in a ridiculous sense

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The reason why

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
The no virus in the extreme

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Is ridiculous is because

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It discounts, often discounts

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
The idea that there are viruses

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
At all. And we know

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
And I assure you that

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Even Steph and Lanka knows

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
That there are viruses that

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Carry genetic signals between

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Bacteria. There are viruses

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
That carry genetic signals

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Between plankton and the ocean

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
There are genetic signals that

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Carry genetic signals between

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
The roots of trees

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And the

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
The rhizomes

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Of the fungi that are

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Symbiotic with them in the soil

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
So we know there are virus

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Particles that are released in the

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Brain that take RNA from one

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Neuron to another. There are

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Indogenous viruses that are

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Responsible for moving pieces of

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
RNA between our gamete

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Chromosomes and actually

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Moving over the

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Reassortment of genes that gives

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Us all of the variation in our

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Children is actually modulated

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
By endogenous viruses

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
So we understand that these

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Signals exist, we understand

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That they're there, but what has

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Been identified by these no

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Virus people is the idea that

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
These signals are

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Responsible for disease and they

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Are not. But remember, that's

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Different that's saying

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's exactly and so I want you

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Can I jump in?

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Sure.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Okay, so this is

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I don't know who you're speaking

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Of the things that no virus

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
But I listen to Dr. Tom Cowan

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I listen to Dr. Andrew Kaufman

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
And then there's a lot of

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
People in their camp

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
That is like a couple from

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Mark and Sam Bailey

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And they have been asking the

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
People that are saying that

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
To come to the table

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And debate them and

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
You know, there have been a

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Couple of attempts and they've

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Absolutely failed because

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Their basis on their science

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Is based on

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
A computer model

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
They don't even use the

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Cell culture anymore to

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Organically produce an actual

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Genome that is

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
That is subject to new

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
A pathogen

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Representation.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Can I interrupt here because

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I really want you to understand

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
That I'm not arguing

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Let me just

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Compound that I did

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Understand what you said, okay

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
You're talking about

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Viruses now if we were to

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Find what is a virus, right?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Do we agree that it's a

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Strand of either RNA or DNA that's

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Wrapped in a lipid coat

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That's the same definition of what

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
A virus is and then the other

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Question I would pose on that

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Is that not an exosome?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Well, okay, so

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
You're putting questions

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And I love the questions, but

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I really wanted to interrupt

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
You because I need to make

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
An important point here and that

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Is that when I was still

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
A consultant for

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Robert F Kennedy Jr. I reached

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Out on behalf of CHD

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
With these no-virus people

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Very specifically about the idea

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
That RNA virology

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Is a hoax

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
And that actually RNA virology

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Is based on a bedrock

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Methodology

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Of RNA clones

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
So they find sequences in the

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Wild, they make a lot of

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
DNA and then they convert

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
That DNA to RNA and then that

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
RNA will cause

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
A psychopathic effects

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
That RNA will cause an

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Immune reaction in an animal

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
If you inject it in their nose

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
That RNA will cause a

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Sequencing reaction that's

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Highly robust in a cell culture

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
And so all of the illusion

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Of RNA virology can be created

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Using laboratory-proven

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Bench techniques for

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
DNA manufacture and

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
RNA manufacture and I reached out

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
To the no-virus people

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Two years ago

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
To try and explain to them

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
That virology could use

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
RNA infectious clones

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
To lie about RNA virology

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
As a field

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And they chose

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
To do one thing and one thing

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Only and that is to discredit

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Me, to call me a liar

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
And to try to get me fired

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
They didn't reach out and say

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Oh, let's hear more about

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
How it is that everybody

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm talking about Tom Cowan

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm talking about Alex Zeck

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
And I'm talking about the two

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Bailies, all of them

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I reached out to the Bailies

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
In 2020 and they told me

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
They couldn't do an interview

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Because she was having a baby

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And then after that it was over

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
No one would talk to me

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
The moment they reach out

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And say, wow, it's interesting

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
That you've been trying to say

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
That RNA infectious clones

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
When we tried to ruin

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Your family's life last year

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That's what I would like

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Because I got myself fired

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Twice already for fighting through

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
This biology and twice I've tried

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
To reach out to them to find

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Out what they're saying and they

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Have ignored me and instead

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Tried to ask me and that's

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Unfortunate because I want to

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Make a bridge here

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I'm dubious about this

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Because I've been listening to

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Trying to get somebody to come to the table

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Every once in a while, somebody will

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
But you're saying that they've taken you

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And they've swept you under the rug

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And covered you up

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
You can watch the video

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
There's a video with all five of them

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Accepting me and when they address me

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
They insult me and they say that

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Clones are imaginary

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
And I'm actually arguing that

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Viruses are imaginary and they use

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Clones to create the illusion

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And they're ignoring me

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Why would they ignore that?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
What do they do?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
What do these clones actually do?

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
They create the molecular signal

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
That they say is impossible

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Which is a high fidelity RNA signal

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
That can be sequenced using PCR

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And using Sanger sequencing

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Which they say is an illusion

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
But it's not in the context of clones

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's always been an illusion in the context

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Of these stupid bats

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
But it's not an illusion when it comes to making

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
DNA on a bench

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
They've been able to make DNA on a bench

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
At high fidelity for 20 years

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And so the fact that they've told you

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
That we found this genetic signal

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
It suggests that they could just put it there

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And I've been arguing that from the beginning

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
But it's not just that they're lying

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
About their being viruses

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It's they're lying about the fidelity of this signal

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
And they placed it there

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
And told you it's viruses

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I'm trying to help them

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
And they won't listen

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Okay, so they're not saying this

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Obviously, because they don't

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
They don't purport that viruses cause disease

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Or are pathogenic

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Or that they actually

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
They don't have a discussion

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
About how the illusion is created

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
They just want me to argue about isolation

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Well, let me ask you

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And I've already admitted that they can't do that

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
So let's have a discussion about

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
What RNA clones are

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Let's have a discussion about what all these papers are

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
And they won't

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Okay, well, let me

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Let me ask you something

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Let me ask you this, okay, so

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
You have this lipid-coded

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
DNA sequence

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And it's claimed

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
By mainstream science that

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
What happens is that DNA sequence

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Will get into the cell by all the cell

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
You know machinery and it will

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Bind to the other DNA sequences

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Not cell machinery and in fact

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
In fact

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And then actually start

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Then it would start replicating

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
But by itself, it's totally inert

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Having a host of hours

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
And hours every night

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Telling people that this is a lie

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
That this is not true

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
That it's not possible for a cell to do something

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
That it doesn't already do

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It's like saying that you can take a cuckoo clock

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
And make it to make toast

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
You can't do that

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
You can make a cuckoo clock

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Ding at the wrong time

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And you can make it read the wrong time

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
But you can't make it make toast

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And a virus cannot make a cell

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
It's like you're jacking the machinery of exosomes

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Which is something I've also been saying

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
For three-three

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Yes, thank you

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Listen, what I heard you explain

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Was that this

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
virology

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
The cart was before the horse

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
That exosomal biology

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Should have been the basis of virology

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Instead of the other way around

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Of course it's been

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Of course, of course

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Because they're purporting to analyze

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
A signal that is predominated

51:47.000 --> 51:50.800
dominated at this size scale by signals that are endogenous.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.920
And instead, people like Nathan Wolf and all of others

51:53.920 --> 51:56.000
have convinced us that at this size scale,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.600
the only thing that exists are viral pathogens.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.520
There's no endogenous communication.

52:00.520 --> 52:03.200
There's no signaling here.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.720
It's just all viruses.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.280
And this is the lie.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.120
This is the lie.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.200
OK, let me try to understand.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.800
So you have to jump on to.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.000
Yeah.

52:15.000 --> 52:15.440
I'm sorry.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.200
I don't want to interrupt you.

52:16.200 --> 52:21.200
I've got a couple more callers with what I really appreciate.

52:21.200 --> 52:24.560
I hope that the doctor will return people.

52:24.560 --> 52:27.320
I've got to look people would love to hear this again.

52:27.320 --> 52:30.640
More of this, I think, JJ, let me bring that up

52:30.640 --> 52:32.680
before we run out of time.

52:32.680 --> 52:36.000
I'm available every Saturday that you are, my friend.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.240
Terrific.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.400
And hey, can you stay with?

52:39.400 --> 52:42.200
Can you take the callers to?

52:42.200 --> 52:43.520
Is that cool?

52:43.520 --> 52:44.080
Can you stay?

52:44.080 --> 52:47.040
Yeah, if you can, we've got two more callers here.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.480
If you want to hang out, is that cool?

52:49.480 --> 52:51.040
If we're trying to get to them before I go,

52:51.040 --> 52:52.400
it's Bob in Utah, first Bob.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.440
Thanks very much for the call.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.120
You have a quick question for AJ.

52:55.120 --> 52:57.120
AJ.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.160
Yeah, good job, William.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.400
You've covered most of what we expected.

53:02.400 --> 53:05.560
I want to ask about the infectious clones.

53:05.560 --> 53:11.000
What exactly is the process by which these are synthesized

53:11.000 --> 53:14.040
or created in the lab?

53:14.520 --> 53:17.120
So it's a pretty standard technique

53:17.120 --> 53:20.360
that they're trying to give Ralph Berwick extra credit

53:20.360 --> 53:21.240
for having developed.

53:21.240 --> 53:24.960
But in reality, molecular biology on the bench

53:24.960 --> 53:29.360
has been creating DNA sequences from scratch

53:29.360 --> 53:31.400
and cutting them into pieces and getting them

53:31.400 --> 53:33.040
to stick together again in the ways

53:33.040 --> 53:34.440
that they would like them to do.

53:34.440 --> 53:38.280
That's how all molecular biology and academia is done.

53:38.280 --> 53:42.760
And so what they've done with coronaviruses is really weird,

53:42.760 --> 53:45.720
because when they find coronaviruses before the pandemic,

53:45.720 --> 53:49.360
they find a signal of RNA, a signal,

53:49.360 --> 53:52.720
meaning that they can hear some noise on a radio

53:52.720 --> 53:56.000
or they can find the signs

53:56.000 --> 53:57.720
of somebody having been in a garage,

53:57.720 --> 53:59.720
but they don't have the person.

53:59.720 --> 54:01.600
They haven't caught the intruder.

54:01.600 --> 54:02.960
They've just found a sign.

54:02.960 --> 54:05.880
And from that sign, they can report

54:05.880 --> 54:08.760
to recreate the whole intruder.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.080
And so from this perspective,

54:10.080 --> 54:13.040
what they're doing usually before the pandemic

54:13.040 --> 54:17.400
was they were looking for a particularly conserved gene,

54:17.400 --> 54:19.960
only about 300 base pairs long.

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
And if they-

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
Looking at-

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
Looking at-

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Looking at-

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
Looking at-

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Looking at-

54:25.960 --> 54:26.960
Looking at-

54:26.960 --> 54:29.760
In a bat, in a bat anus, in people's lungs,

54:29.760 --> 54:31.520
in whatever, in some kind of sample,

54:31.520 --> 54:34.120
they're looking for an RNA signal,

54:34.120 --> 54:36.120
which they can use PCR to find.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.760
But that does not mean that that signal

54:38.760 --> 54:40.360
is specific for something,

54:40.360 --> 54:42.280
but they claimed it was.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.280
Now, they've been telling us a story that if they look with PCR,

54:46.280 --> 54:50.280
they can also find other genes present in these bats.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.560
But for some reason, when they put this into culture,

54:52.560 --> 54:54.120
it never grows.

54:54.120 --> 55:01.320
So the way that they have overcome this problem is by assembling what they call a synthetic

55:01.320 --> 55:02.800
coronavirus genome.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.360
Now, is this a real thing?

55:04.360 --> 55:07.160
You're going to have to argue with these scientists about it.

55:07.160 --> 55:11.720
If they claim to have found these genes in the wild, and if they assemble these genes

55:11.720 --> 55:19.360
using synthetic DNA, then they can create some of the effects of viruses in cell culture

55:19.360 --> 55:20.360
and in animals.

55:20.360 --> 55:27.040
So what I'm telling you is that for the last 15 years, coronavirus biology is based on

55:27.040 --> 55:32.680
one RNA signals that they claim to find in the wild, and two-

55:32.680 --> 55:35.640
Okay, that's about in the lab.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.640
Now, hello.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.640
There's the plasma.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.800
Yes, go ahead with, yes.

55:40.800 --> 55:45.160
So they find this sequence in the wild, and they create a DNA copy of it.

55:45.160 --> 55:51.120
Now, the reason why that's important is because the RNA signal, like a cake, can't just be

55:51.120 --> 55:54.920
put back in the oven, and then you pull out two cakes, and then put the cake in the oven

55:54.920 --> 55:56.440
to get you pull out three cakes.

55:56.440 --> 56:01.000
RNA doesn't work that way, but DNA is like a recipe.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
I can make an eye-

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Yeah, I know about...

56:03.000 --> 56:11.120
I'm suggesting to you is that unlike virology, where you can't grow a lot of a virus, if

56:11.120 --> 56:17.240
I wanted to make a lot of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, I could make a lot of it, I could

56:17.240 --> 56:21.480
make a truckload of it, and then I could spread it out in different bottles, and I could spill

56:21.480 --> 56:22.480
it in different countries.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.480
Okay, okay.

56:23.480 --> 56:24.480
Here's my question.

56:24.480 --> 56:31.360
Are they paying with one giant long, we're forward and first primer, a long distance

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
apart?

56:32.360 --> 56:33.880
Oh, that's the point.

56:33.880 --> 56:35.800
The point you cannot.

56:35.800 --> 56:40.600
In order to find this sequence in the wild, they need 100 different primer pairs, which

56:40.600 --> 56:47.520
makes it possible for 100 different error signals, 100 different false positives to result in

56:47.520 --> 56:48.520
this.

56:48.520 --> 56:49.520
Okay.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.520
Look, we found this sequence.

56:50.520 --> 56:55.160
You say clone, they're being 100 different sections of it over and over.

56:55.160 --> 57:00.280
When I say clone, they are making a pure RNA, and they are telling you that that pure RNA

57:00.280 --> 57:01.280
is natural.

57:01.280 --> 57:02.680
That's what I'm saying, and it's not.

57:02.680 --> 57:07.960
It would be like saying, we're going to make a million uniforms for an NBA team, and then

57:07.960 --> 57:11.400
we're going to say that's evidence that this NBA team is popular.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.760
That's not how this works.

57:12.760 --> 57:20.480
I don't want to argue with you because I know you've had a rough time.

57:20.480 --> 57:23.760
And you've changed your views a lot.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.880
I want to talk to the other people out there.

57:26.880 --> 57:34.640
If there are no real contagious viruses in reality, I'm sorry to cut you off, Bob.

57:34.640 --> 57:41.080
We were coming up on the end of the show, and I apologize to Brian in Washington.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.440
But listen, I really want to thank you again for joining me.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
Terrific show.

57:44.440 --> 57:46.760
I hope you'll join me again on RBN.

57:46.760 --> 57:51.040
Some of the other hosts may won't invite you on too, because you know what you're talking

57:51.040 --> 57:54.040
about your real fault criminal and inspire me very much.

57:54.040 --> 57:57.640
One more time as we go out, give folks your information, sir.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.640
My name is Jonathan Cooe.

57:58.640 --> 58:05.360
You can find me at gigahomebiological.com, G-I-G-A-O-H-M, biological.com.

58:05.360 --> 58:08.840
And you can also find me on Twitch with the same name, gigahome, biological.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.440
It's a channel.

58:10.440 --> 58:13.720
Unfortunately, Twitch isn't the best platform, but that's where to find me for now.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.080
And you can look me up on my website.

58:15.080 --> 58:17.080
Thank you very much, Steve, for having me.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.080
Great.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.080
Thanks very much.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.520
And RBN, remember, a thought crime of day helps keep tyranny at bay.

58:22.520 --> 58:24.520
Y'all be good to each other.

58:24.520 --> 58:25.520
Nice.

58:25.520 --> 58:54.360
Are you one of the millions of people who feel

58:54.360 --> 58:59.280
like there is a dark cloud hanging over their heads whenever they're using pharmaceutical

58:59.280 --> 59:00.280
drugs?

59:00.280 --> 59:05.560
For some, the short term relief can turn into an opioid addiction nightmare.

59:05.560 --> 59:09.960
Have you ever wondered why CBD oil is a billion dollar industry?

59:09.960 --> 59:15.520
It's because it works better than opioids and is actually healthy for you.

59:15.520 --> 59:21.800
However, CBD oil is stripped of all other helpful compounds found in the hemp plants.

59:21.800 --> 59:27.440
According to neuroscientists, the whole hemp plant, otherwise known as hemp paste, is

59:27.440 --> 59:31.400
even more effective than the chemically processed CBD oil.

59:31.400 --> 59:34.640
Are you ready to take back your health?

59:34.640 --> 59:50.320
You can try hemp paste for the price of a cup of coffee.

59:51.800 --> 59:58.360
You're listening to Real Talk Radio, only on the Republic Broadcasting Network.
