WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'll be traveling through the road

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Come you master the wall

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
You were the man to be gone

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
You were built with death planes

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
You were that built on a mountain

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
You would hide behind walls

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
You would hide behind death

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
I just want you to know I can see you through your mans

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I want you to know I can see you through your mans

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
You had never done nothing

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
But now to destroy

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
You bled him in my world

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Like he's your inner toy

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
You were gone in my head

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And you hide from my heart

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And you tell him from my past

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And you tell him from my past

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And you tell him from my past

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
And you tell him from my past

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You're the man to be gone

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
You're the man to be gone

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Like dreams of old you lie and they see

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Whoa, walk everyone you want me to believe

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
But I see you through your eyes

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
And I see you through your brain

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Like I see you through the water

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
And the rock near my train

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Like I see you through the water

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And the rock near my train

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
You're the passing road train

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Is for the others to fire

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
And you sit back and watch while my death

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Count you tired

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You hide in your mansion

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
While the young people bleed

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
So knock your bodies away

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
You're the man to the world

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
You're the man to the world

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And then masters the war, wage war

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
By way of deception

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Thought criminals wage peace by way of the truth

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Good morning y'all

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm Stephen Douglas Whitener

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
And you're listening to

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Republic Broadcasting Network

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
At republicbroadcasting.org

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And if you've been

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
It's February the 3rd, 2024

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Groundhog Day was yesterday

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm really thrilled to be here y'all

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I mean RBN

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
It's a listener supported platform

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
And I've been here about three years

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
If this is the first time you've

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Listen to me or the first time you've

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Heard Thought Crime Live

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I think we have some new folks

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Joining today

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
With my guest on a stream

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I want to say hello to y'all too

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And there's also a chat

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
That's Thought Crime Live

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Chattango.com

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Also if you want to join us there

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And if you can help RBN

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Maintain this platform

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
For free speech

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
You go to republicbroadcasting.org

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
There's a big yellow

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Donate button there

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
One of our co-hosts says

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
That you can just smash it with PayPal

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
And there's also a number

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
That you can call

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
If you could set up a monthly donation

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
With a credit or debit card

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
It's 800-724-2719

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Extension 3

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And also with the thing happening

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
With the truckers that happened up in

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Canada too

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
And you want to remain anonymous

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
But still support free speech

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
You can mail a check

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Payable to RBN

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Or a money order

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Orch's cash

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I mailed some cash

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Which probably will be a crime

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
One of these days

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
2-2-2-5-1

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Double Creek Drive

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Sweet 302

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Round Rock, Texas

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
7-8-6-6-4

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'll give that to you

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
2-2-5-1

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Double Creek Drive

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Sweet 302

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Round Rock, Texas

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
7-8-6-6-4

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I'll give that one more time

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
2-2-5-1

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Double Creek Drive

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Sweet 302

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Round Rock, Texas

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
7-8-6-6-4

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
And I just wanted

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
To get that in

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm really honored

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
To be here

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
And I am excited

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
About the guest I have

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I have mentioned

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
This gentleman's work

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Before a paraphrase

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I won't say quoted

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I've tried to paraphrase

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
What he's had to say

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I respect people

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Who have

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
You know, blown the whistle

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Because that just

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
It cost me

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
And it cost you to tell the

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Truth sometimes

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And this gentleman

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I wanted to

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
He's a very smart guy

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
JJ, let me let you

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Give your introduction

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
To tell folks

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Who you are

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Gig Am biological

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Good morning

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Steven, thank you very

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Much for having me on

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm not normally talking

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
This so early

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
So I really appreciate

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
You getting me

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Up and going

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
A lot of times for me

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
The hard thing is to

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Hit the go button

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
And go live

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And so it's very nice

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
To have an excuse

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
To be up so early

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
And doing it

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
My introduction can be

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Very long

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
But I'll try to make it

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
As short as possible

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm a Wisconsin boy

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Who moved to the big city

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Of Chicago to go to

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
University

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And I lived in

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Chicago

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Hold on one second

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
You need a problem there

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
No, I can't

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
I'm sorry

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm alive

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
You gotta go out

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Thank you though, honey

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Shut the door

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
I got my blood

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, exactly

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
It's okay

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
RBN is listed

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Is used to that

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
With me

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
It sounded like someone

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Was chewing horses

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
One day

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
That's funny

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
So I am a

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Wisconsin boy

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I moved to Chicago

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
For university

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And then I spent

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
A number of years

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
In Chicago

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
As a young man

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Kind of treading water

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Trying to figure out

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
What I wanted to do

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I went to university

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
With the attention

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Of going right to med school

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And becoming a big important

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Doctor

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
And then I got waitlisted

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
For a few years

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
In a row

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
And at first I started

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Teaching high school

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
As a way of treading water

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And then that pay

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Isn't very good

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
So I started bartending

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
At night

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
And that pay is

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Actually really good

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And a couple of years

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
In a row

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I decided just to bartend

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
And that pay is

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Actually really good

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
So I decided

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Just to bartend

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And that

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't know

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
If that was the right thing

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
For me to do at the

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Time from

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Anyone else's

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Perspective, but I think

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
From a sort of

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Growing up

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Young man's perspective

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
It was really good for me

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
To kind of hit a soft rock

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Bottom with

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Bartending and getting

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Pretty cocky about

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
How the money was coming in

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And who's money it was

07:33.000 --> 07:38.120
by giving the keys to the wrong person and just casually taking a day off and I got

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
fired.

07:39.120 --> 07:45.560
And it's pretty hard in retrospect to come upon a bar gig like I had where I was working

07:45.560 --> 07:48.440
three nights a week and making enough money and more.

07:48.440 --> 07:54.280
And so finding another gig like that in Chicago wasn't easy and I was forced to kind of panic

07:54.280 --> 07:59.520
and I got a technician job at the University of Chicago that reminded me that I had been

07:59.520 --> 08:03.920
a biologist since I was a little kid and that I needed to do something more than mixed

08:03.920 --> 08:06.520
drinks and entertain people.

08:06.520 --> 08:16.140
And so I started working with this guy at the University of Chicago who taught me a couple

08:16.140 --> 08:22.440
techniques that allowed me to move to the Netherlands, do my PhD in the Netherlands,

08:22.440 --> 08:28.720
meet my wife in Amsterdam and then move together with her to Norway where I continued my training

08:28.720 --> 08:31.160
in a laboratory there in Toronto.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.960
And we had a couple boys in Norway and then we moved back to the Netherlands with every

08:34.960 --> 08:40.960
intention of getting tenure there and settling down in the Netherlands where her family is.

08:40.960 --> 08:46.360
And I didn't get tenure, I mean I got some EU money in my first couple years there and

08:46.360 --> 08:49.920
then I just couldn't get anything to work sustainably.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.840
And so after four years in the Netherlands we had no choice really because my wife had

08:54.840 --> 09:00.320
also gotten a PhD in plant biology but we did not pursue her career, she didn't really

09:00.320 --> 09:03.300
enjoy it, she just finished her degree to finish it.

09:03.300 --> 09:08.240
And so we moved to America because that's where I had my previous, my whole life was

09:08.240 --> 09:11.240
here and we moved to the University of Pittsburgh.

09:11.240 --> 09:16.000
I'd never lived or been to Pittsburgh before I flew here and it's a beautiful little town

09:16.000 --> 09:21.280
with lots of trees and hills and water and so from the air it was just like, wow, Pittsburgh

09:21.280 --> 09:22.280
is like this.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
I have to admit.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.480
I'm up in Wisconsin, I'm a Packer fan and when I was a child the Steelers were winning

09:28.480 --> 09:34.000
the Super Bowls and everybody hated Lin Swan and Jerry Bradshaw.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.360
So I never liked Pittsburgh, I never wanted to like Pittsburgh and so coming here was

09:38.360 --> 09:42.960
a little weird because I also didn't like the Pirates because I'm a Cubs fan.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.600
So it was a real strange place to be so attracted to.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.440
I had a couple of three good years at the University of Pittsburgh trying to keep my

09:52.440 --> 10:00.440
career going and when the pandemic broke out I was already working on serendipitously a

10:00.440 --> 10:05.600
bike ride series where I was doing Journal Club for neurobiologists on my bicycle, on

10:05.600 --> 10:11.640
my way back or on my way to work and I had an electric assist bike so it allows you to

10:11.640 --> 10:16.880
get exercise but still cover like 15 or 20 miles without killing yourself.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.440
And so I could talk on my bike while I was riding and it was a really cool little show

10:21.440 --> 10:26.800
that when the pandemic broke out I just did a couple bike rides where I did a coronavirus

10:26.800 --> 10:37.920
biology review and at some moment in 2020 I got an email from the administrative offices

10:37.920 --> 10:45.280
of the media, the media department of the hospital that is attached to the University

10:45.280 --> 10:46.280
of Pittsburgh.

10:46.280 --> 10:54.840
It would be the UPMC medical system and she said that the Pittsburgh Gazette had contacted

10:54.840 --> 11:01.000
me for an interview but they informed the Pittsburgh Gazette that my expertise was not

11:01.000 --> 11:06.320
virology and I was not to speak to them even if they contacted me directly.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.760
They said they saw my YouTube channel and they said okay at the end of this email with

11:10.760 --> 11:15.680
a question mark which I found bizarre and a few months later my immediate supervisor

11:15.680 --> 11:19.880
asked me not to come in anymore because I wasn't getting my temperature taken and

11:19.880 --> 11:24.920
I wasn't putting a sticker on my ID every day and I was also getting arguments with

11:24.920 --> 11:28.720
people about whether you could read about legitimate science in the New York Times or

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
not.

11:29.720 --> 11:35.320
Anyway, it just so happens that the University of Pittsburgh had just extended my contract

11:35.320 --> 11:39.960
in July when they sent me home in October so that meant I had like eight months.

11:39.960 --> 11:45.120
And so during that eight months I just kept teaching immunology online and that got me

11:45.120 --> 11:48.800
enough followers to keep doing it for the whole year.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.480
And then early in 2022 I got a phone call from some guy by the name of Robert F. Kennedy

11:53.480 --> 11:59.000
Jr. and he asked me to help consult on a book that he released a couple months ago called

11:59.000 --> 12:03.880
the Wuhan cover up and some of the biology that I teach every night is definitely in

12:03.880 --> 12:08.160
that book and there's some quotes in there from me which is kind of fun.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.200
And then for a brief period of time for about six months after the book I worked for Children's

12:12.200 --> 12:19.400
Health Defense and that's the non-profit that Bobby used to be the spokesperson for.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.720
And that didn't really work out apparently because what I do on my stream is still too

12:23.720 --> 12:30.120
raw and when I bumped into the management a number of times about what I was saying and

12:30.120 --> 12:36.000
eventually to my own surprise to be quite honest my whole family was taken by surprise

12:36.000 --> 12:38.960
by it on January 4th they just decided to lay me off.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.960
So we're back again shaking a can on the internet but we have a good little core of

12:43.960 --> 12:49.760
followers and I know from my previous years of doing this that I think it's pretty important

12:49.760 --> 12:51.200
so we're going to try and keep it going.

12:51.200 --> 12:56.040
I apologize for that extremely long introduction but it is kind of a it's kind of an interesting

12:56.040 --> 13:01.600
I think that was it's so it's so serendipitous that I find myself here.

13:01.600 --> 13:08.120
Yes you definitely qualify as a thought criminal sir I mean to interrupt you but that definitely

13:08.120 --> 13:13.480
established your bona fides there you know it's I've learned from you too I look the

13:13.480 --> 13:19.320
listeners may be aware of some of the things that you talk about but you you bring it together

13:19.320 --> 13:24.280
the word transfection that you use I think needs to be used more we need to spread a

13:24.280 --> 13:31.800
lot of this information far and wide you know RBN listeners spread RBN too but you

13:31.800 --> 13:37.320
know I see how you say that the battle is for our kids let me let you get back to that

13:37.320 --> 13:42.360
because what you have to say is even more important than than that but I'm glad you

13:42.360 --> 13:49.200
did that because you know I don't know that everybody would would know you know I do believe

13:49.200 --> 13:53.200
what you say in a sincere okay I've not met you personally as I have some of my guests

13:53.200 --> 13:59.200
and all but I have followed you and do trust what you say to be sincere.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.640
Well I mean that's really I really appreciate that but I also want to emphasize to everybody

14:04.640 --> 14:12.400
that's listening that one of the core messages that I try to put out every day is that we

14:12.400 --> 14:17.720
all as adults have to take responsibility for learning this it can't be something where

14:17.720 --> 14:21.280
you know we have a friend that knows about used cars and so we're just going to rely

14:21.280 --> 14:26.880
on our friend to help us buy a used car or whatever we've got to really learn this biology

14:26.880 --> 14:32.360
ourselves because it is who we are and it is who our kids are and if we don't impart

14:32.400 --> 14:37.800
this understanding of what is sacred to our children then they're going to grow up believing

14:37.800 --> 14:43.040
whatever the TV and social media which is even worse tells them and that's I think the other

14:43.040 --> 14:47.800
transition point that I'm you know as a biologist it seems kind of weird to emphasize this all

14:47.800 --> 14:55.960
the time but we are you and I I think I'm 52 we are a generation that can understand

14:55.960 --> 15:00.200
the transition that we're at because we grew up at a time where kids would be bored and

15:00.240 --> 15:05.120
then get in trouble outside we were we were a generation that the solution was get out

15:05.120 --> 15:12.160
of the house don't come back until dinner and and that that kind of growing up with

15:12.160 --> 15:17.840
boredom that you yourself are responsible for filling something that I see in my kids

15:17.840 --> 15:24.000
all the time they don't experience it because they have a number of place fillers that are

15:24.000 --> 15:27.960
that are ready and waiting so that they never have that problem and when we were kids that

15:27.960 --> 15:33.480
would have been like daydreaming watching TV but it's much worse now because they're

15:33.480 --> 15:39.120
they're putting short sometimes malevolent thoughts in their heads and that includes

15:39.120 --> 15:46.840
these ideas about scary biological phenomenon that probably don't exist in order to to govern

15:46.840 --> 15:50.640
the globe and so my my main message and I think that's what you're trying to get me

15:50.640 --> 15:58.800
to spit out here is that as a biologist I walked into the pandemic thinking that vaccinations

15:58.800 --> 16:06.200
in general were a good idea and that maybe the United States applied some of these vaccinations

16:06.200 --> 16:12.920
too early or too often but I had not yet evolved my thinking to the stage where I was considering

16:12.920 --> 16:18.560
the possibility that they could just be wholly unnecessary or that they are being applied

16:18.560 --> 16:24.520
in a criminally negligent way but when the pandemic came around and they started saying

16:24.520 --> 16:29.560
that they were going to use this technology called transfection to immunize old people

16:29.560 --> 16:34.760
I immediately saw that they were also eventually going to they were thinking that they were

16:34.760 --> 16:40.320
going to immunize everybody this way had started to really upset me because I have been using

16:40.320 --> 16:46.920
transfection for between 10 and 15 years in my own work on mice I understand what it's

16:46.920 --> 16:51.760
meant to do but I also understand that there are tremendous limitations to trying to do

16:51.760 --> 16:57.480
these kinds of things in a living system and so unlike all the work that I've ever done

16:57.480 --> 17:04.680
where part of the built-in plan is to sacrifice the animal in order to accurately describe

17:04.680 --> 17:11.560
the autonomy of the locations that you recorded from or the cells that you modified we don't

17:11.560 --> 17:17.040
plan to do any of those things with an old person or a young person that we transfect

17:17.040 --> 17:22.640
we want them to live a long healthy life and that's not something that anybody in my neck

17:22.640 --> 17:28.520
of the woods when using transfection ever had as an expectation you don't expect a mouse

17:28.520 --> 17:32.960
that you've transfected in their brain to live a long and healthy life you don't expect

17:32.960 --> 17:37.640
to be able to transfect a monkey multiple times in its life and therefore I had to live

17:37.640 --> 17:42.800
the long and healthy life that's not a built-in part of any experiment so the idea that suddenly

17:42.800 --> 17:49.520
at 2020 they had Bill Gates on the PBS NewsHour telling us that this new kind of vaccine where

17:49.520 --> 17:54.800
they toss in some RNA is actually really cool because then your body becomes the vaccine

17:54.800 --> 18:01.360
factory and that spectacular combination of words is the most insidious lie I've heard

18:01.360 --> 18:08.640
in my lifetime and that that idea it needs to be dispelled we can't have any college

18:08.640 --> 18:15.680
children college young adults regurgitating this idea in five years because if they are

18:15.680 --> 18:21.040
we will be and that I really think is the the heart of the heart of the heart of these

18:21.040 --> 18:27.400
kids these young adults don't understand what they were coerced into doing and how biologically

18:27.400 --> 18:33.560
dissimilar it is to previous vaccinations which in and of themselves were already worthy

18:33.560 --> 18:40.280
of scrutiny for the last ten years ask any autism mom or dad and so we are in trick we

18:40.280 --> 18:47.440
are at a situation where we are arguing about the most recent version of a lie and we're

18:47.440 --> 18:51.960
even being tricked into not connecting this recent version of the lie with the previous

18:52.880 --> 18:57.280
how's that we're coming up on the first break that was terrific JJ we'll be right back

18:57.280 --> 19:00.480
thought criminals hang on

19:21.960 --> 19:32.960
I want to be like Jonathan see you try to find all this way

19:32.960 --> 19:43.960
ain't no need to be before you lift up your voices it's time you should say it's a great

19:43.960 --> 20:06.640
life I'm so excited to have you as part of the wild

20:06.640 --> 20:11.440
pastures family and we look forward to bringing you the pastures meets that you and your

20:11.440 --> 20:16.640
family will love now we started well pastures because so many of my clients would tell me

20:16.640 --> 20:22.080
they just couldn't find high quality pastures meets and even when they did it was so expensive

20:22.080 --> 20:26.400
that they couldn't afford to eat it regularly now I'm not talking about the bottom of the

20:26.400 --> 20:31.880
barrel healthy meats that have planes like natural or free range or even cage free terms

20:31.880 --> 20:36.120
that were actually created by the industrial food industry to make us feel all warm and

20:36.120 --> 20:41.960
fuzzy about buying their low quality products I'm talking about truly nourishing pastures

20:41.960 --> 20:47.000
needs the kind that you'll never really find in a grocery store our farmers are doing things

20:47.000 --> 20:53.680
beyond organic our beef is 100% grass fed and grass finished and raised on pastures free from

20:53.680 --> 20:59.400
chemicals and other pesticides our chickens are 100% pastures raised where they get their

20:59.400 --> 21:05.040
natural diet of grass and forage and insects we will never settle for free range which is

21:05.120 --> 21:11.360
actually one of the most deceptive terms in the chicken industry in fact less than 0.1% of the

21:11.360 --> 21:17.120
chicken consumed in the United States is truly pasture raised in the way that ours is and our

21:17.120 --> 21:22.880
pork is 100% pastures raised as well so if you care about where your food comes from you have

21:22.880 --> 21:28.240
definitely made it to the right place as a wild pastures member you'll be supporting the most

Welcome back y'all you're listening to thought crime live on republic broadcasting network

23:38.400 --> 23:48.560
and i'm joined by Jonathan kooie jj kooie of giga arm biological.com and you know as a kid i

23:48.560 --> 23:53.920
wanted to chemistry set when i was six years old i remember when i looked at science as to something

23:54.000 --> 23:59.200
that would elucidate what was the sacred biology now assistant frankenstein since then you know

23:59.200 --> 24:05.200
when i the more i learned it just let me let you go back to you i just relate so much to what you

24:05.200 --> 24:12.720
you say sir well uh that's that's very nice um i guess you just kind of triggered in me something

24:12.720 --> 24:19.920
i just did a a show yesterday which i think um can bring a bigger picture idea to the forefront

24:20.000 --> 24:25.760
a little bit um in terms of how they they've convinced these people to participate in this

24:26.320 --> 24:30.800
and one of the things that i think needs to be made clear to the again we're talking to college

24:30.800 --> 24:36.800
age kids we're talking to young kids um who's whose teachers in their schools are probably a

24:36.800 --> 24:42.720
little confused about this as well but we need everybody to understand that that artificial

24:42.720 --> 24:49.120
intelligence is being hyped as something with potential very much in the same way that genetic

24:49.120 --> 24:54.400
therapies were hyped in the 80s um there's a really interesting sort of anecdote that i can

24:54.400 --> 25:00.640
tell you of a guy by the name of robert malone um who was cutting his teeth in some of the most

25:00.640 --> 25:05.680
important virology labs and surrounded by some of the most important virologists in the late 70s

25:05.680 --> 25:14.160
early 80s um in his in his uh graduate school work and during his grad school work um he had the

25:14.160 --> 25:20.480
choice of working with some of the the at the time preeminent biologists from from muri gardener

25:20.480 --> 25:28.480
to uh robert gallo to even uh to somebody like um david baltimore and so all of these you know

25:28.480 --> 25:36.400
grandfathers of modern virology um circulating as a postdoc then um convinced him that in 10 or 15

25:36.400 --> 25:42.080
years that virology was going to progress at such a pace and our understanding of the genome was

25:42.160 --> 25:48.640
going to progress at such a pace that there would be genealogists or geneticists that were using

25:48.640 --> 25:55.680
retroviruses to cure childhood diseases in every local hospital in the nation in a few years

25:56.320 --> 26:03.200
and so what we need to understand as adults that we can partake or impart on our children

26:03.200 --> 26:08.320
is that these stories of what was about to happen when we understood the genome better

26:08.400 --> 26:13.600
or when we had faster computers or when we collected enough data that we were finally going to be

26:13.600 --> 26:20.880
able to crack the code so to speak they've used that phrase a lot to to imply that we're going to be

26:20.880 --> 26:27.520
able to see the blueprints and the instruction manual of life and once we do that we won't need

26:27.520 --> 26:33.200
god anymore or god will be irrelevant or we'll finally have proven that god doesn't exist because

26:33.200 --> 26:39.680
we will have attained this transhuman mastery of ourselves this story Steve has been told for

26:39.680 --> 26:46.560
decades especially in secret meetings and in in meetings of secret societies and meetings of

26:46.560 --> 26:52.880
of really rich people at at very expensive dinners talking about their plans for how they're going to

26:52.880 --> 27:00.560
to govern the world this mythology about how eventually if we collect enough data there will

27:00.560 --> 27:06.000
be enough numbers enough measurements that an AI will be able to take that data and convert it

27:06.000 --> 27:14.560
into understanding that has been sort of belied by the the the progress of understanding chess

27:14.560 --> 27:20.480
versus understanding the Chinese game go versus understanding now the example that I used yesterday

27:20.480 --> 27:28.720
in my show was the the success or lack of success of the autopilot in Tesla and one of the things that

27:28.720 --> 27:35.120
I think is now becoming more and more especially obvious with regard to Elon Musk and some of the

27:35.120 --> 27:41.040
things that he claims is very similar to how all of those virologists bamboozled Robert Malone when

27:41.040 --> 27:46.880
he was a young guy so long ago into believing that genetic technologies were going to evolve at light

27:46.880 --> 27:51.520
speed and that within 10 years there would be a geneticist that could fix childhood diseases

27:51.520 --> 27:57.840
using retroviruses they are bamboozling us into believing that eventually with enough cores or

27:57.840 --> 28:03.920
with enough time or with enough data artificial intelligence is going to be able to do things that

28:03.920 --> 28:11.200
heretofore were considered impossible or at least borderline magic and I really can't emphasize

28:11.200 --> 28:19.120
enough how even if this is a future possibility we are not we are not scratching that surface of

28:19.120 --> 28:24.880
that future possibility yet and that these people are actually are actually enchanting our children

28:24.880 --> 28:32.240
with this idea that AI is so powerful you might as well go limp AI is so amazing that you might

28:32.240 --> 28:36.560
as well forget about it that everything that you are going to do and learn in the future is going

28:36.560 --> 28:41.600
to be better than better than better by AI so there's no reason for you to learn to draw there's

28:41.600 --> 28:45.760
no reason for you to learn to paint there's no reason for you to make music there's no reason

28:45.760 --> 28:52.320
for you to be creative you have been relegated to to basically be right hey we'll be right back

28:52.320 --> 28:55.440

33:31.200 --> 33:43.680
my ear holds i'm leaving me and now we're two of its own my ear holds i'm leaving me and i'll

33:43.680 --> 33:51.200
take somebody's gotta face three states when you try to give a hand but don't just want

somebody doesn't want to understand straight states

33:55.680 --> 34:02.000
some can take it like a male straight states straight states

34:03.600 --> 34:09.760
welcome fuck criminals i appreciate you joining me today i have uh

34:11.120 --> 34:17.440
it is dr cooey though isn't it john i mean i just have to say that i wanted to listen to

34:17.440 --> 34:23.120
yeah you are you're dr cooey too right i mean you you you're a research scientist i i think

34:23.120 --> 34:30.480
you might be a humble one that's a rare thing um i am uh phd i don't say doctor because i feel

34:30.480 --> 34:35.600
like a lot of people get confused and i think it's better if you're a phd to just say mister and uh

34:35.600 --> 34:42.480
not not confuse anyone you know like like uh like uh mrs. Biden is also a phd but she calls

34:42.560 --> 34:47.200
herself dr. Biden all the time and i feel like that's really just ingenious she confuses everybody

34:47.200 --> 34:54.960
with that but you can i respect it yes sir i wanted to let the listeners know that uh yes sir go ahead

34:54.960 --> 35:00.240
yeah you can look me up on pub med though um and you can find that i've been a a legitimate

35:00.240 --> 35:06.000
academy magician i usually call them nowadays um for a very long time i was uh i was going for

35:06.000 --> 35:12.400
ten year i wanted to be a professor um that was my my goal and i did really enjoy that job i do

35:12.480 --> 35:18.160
really enjoy it because as a as a professor as a research professor one of the things that's

35:18.160 --> 35:23.120
that's involved in that is having apprentices and the the grad students that come work with you

35:23.120 --> 35:26.880
they call them grad students but what they really are are apprentices and you're teaching them

35:26.880 --> 35:32.320
basically to to learn how to write grants learn how to formulate experiments that get funded and

35:32.320 --> 35:37.520
learn how to do the experiments that get funded now i could do the experiments and other people

35:37.520 --> 35:42.160
could write but i couldn't combine those two and so that's why i didn't really succeed but

35:42.800 --> 35:48.240
part of the reason why i i think i didn't succeed is because i didn't really understand how the

35:48.240 --> 35:54.320
sausage was made and the way the sausage is made is how you can extend the answering of the same

35:54.320 --> 35:59.600
question over several years or several projects and it's not to say that these people do it with

36:00.160 --> 36:05.920
with uh disingenuous or malevolent ideas in mind but they've come to understand that's how the

36:05.920 --> 36:12.960
system works the the grant proposal nich system is not designed to solve problems and then move

36:12.960 --> 36:21.120
on it's designed to sort of explore a a possibility space and even when the possibility space is now

36:21.120 --> 36:28.080
been exhausted oftentimes the the funding mechanism is such is set up in such a way that all of the

36:28.080 --> 36:35.120
people that are that are dependent on that funding mechanism are unwilling to admit that the question

36:35.200 --> 36:41.200
has been answered and so the funding will not be removed from them because it requires the fund

36:41.200 --> 36:46.880
in order the funding for the funding to move on those people have to agree collectively that

36:46.880 --> 36:53.520
that question has been answered and so you get this incredible inertia in academia where the same

36:53.520 --> 36:58.800
question gets asked many many times by many many people and you might think that that results in

36:58.800 --> 37:05.120
thoroughness but in a malevolent system where you have pharma pharmaceutical companies and other

37:05.920 --> 37:11.440
weaponized piles of money influencing that you can get a lot of dead space in academia where the

37:11.440 --> 37:16.400
same bad ideas are pursued for decades and that's where you get statins that's where you get all

37:16.400 --> 37:21.520
these bad cancer treatments that's where you get billions of dollars thrown into the wind when

37:21.520 --> 37:26.240
we know that there are there are certain good ideas that should be pursued but then you'd have

37:26.240 --> 37:31.360
billions of dollars in lots of people out of work or lots of people having to shift their whole

37:31.360 --> 37:35.680
paradigm and that might even include the money that they're making with the products that they

37:35.680 --> 37:43.040
sell and so this is really it's really a spectacular time because it took me getting kicked out of

37:43.040 --> 37:47.360
that moving truck where I was like but I really like my job and I'm really good at it why would

37:47.360 --> 37:54.480
you throw me out and I just couldn't understand it I had it took me a long time to realize that

37:54.560 --> 37:59.520
I was not I was never going to be let back in I really thought at some point they were going to

37:59.520 --> 38:02.960
come around and they were going to see I was right and I would be back to neurobiology and

38:02.960 --> 38:08.560
everything would be great and I it took me a long time to accept that what I was doing was going to

38:09.120 --> 38:14.320
permanently ostracize me and it's probably how you felt all those years ago when you spoke out that

38:14.320 --> 38:18.080
you thought you were doing the right thing and that people would listen and that these problems

38:18.080 --> 38:24.960
would get fixed and instead it's like I know and in fact it's worse than that you have you have

38:24.960 --> 38:30.400
essentially admitted that you will not play and it's since you're not going to play you got to go

38:31.280 --> 38:37.840
and so that's where I thought I've been there in a way just but that was you know with the

38:37.840 --> 38:45.120
Aquatec thing but it just I it beat me down for so many years it's only when I started to talk back

38:45.200 --> 38:51.680
again to stand up that I started to change myself a little bit that's that's where the real battle

38:51.680 --> 38:56.560
took place and like I think that the most important battle after that is just as you were pointing

38:56.560 --> 39:03.120
out with our kids you talk of college age kids too but I mean public school public indoctrination

39:03.120 --> 39:09.600
systems are just there that's weaponized to that that's that's such a trauma based mind control

39:09.600 --> 39:14.000
thing they were doing there with the masks and and it looks like they look like little prisons now

39:14.000 --> 39:17.760
to me when I got when I was going it just that that's a different subject but

39:18.640 --> 39:26.640
let me you said that you followed the way this illusion of consensus was created to sell that a

39:27.840 --> 39:32.880
pathogen made its way around and around the world and that's not true that just the data

39:32.880 --> 39:38.160
doesn't back that up at all and you want to just start with there because people if anybody's I

39:38.240 --> 39:44.640
hear people saying well I tested positive for this and then it's like oh I just I have to step

39:44.640 --> 39:49.520
away from that and not even pay any attention to and those tests are just worthless to me why

39:49.520 --> 39:55.200
I don't care what that's rapid covid test says who you know that that's irrelevant to me to me

39:55.200 --> 39:59.600
that's a weapon used against us and I just don't have anything to do with it but what would you say

39:59.600 --> 40:04.960
to somebody who is still in that paradigm how would you yeah how would you go about that um so that's

40:05.440 --> 40:10.240
a tough one right you're describing the deepest of the deep people and that that we have to

40:10.240 --> 40:17.280
realize that that before too long we're we're gonna have to just do things anyway I'm not

40:17.280 --> 40:21.680
saying we leave them behind but some people are gonna be unrescuable but from that perspective

40:22.640 --> 40:26.720
one of the best places to start that sometimes wakes people up is to ask them

40:28.080 --> 40:32.480
what do you think would have happened if we would have rolled out all of these tests in 2018 what

40:32.560 --> 40:37.760
would we have found nothing and just let this leave it there for a second just let them think

40:37.760 --> 40:46.080
about the possibility that there were at at some point in 2021 there were 254 different emergency

40:46.080 --> 40:53.520
use authorized testing diagnostic products in America alone now how many of those products were

40:53.520 --> 40:58.240
brought to market rushed how many of them were brought to market without proper quality control

40:58.240 --> 41:04.400
how many were brought to market without proper testing we don't know because all of those and

41:04.400 --> 41:09.920
I mean literally all of those products are gone they're not there you can't find an example of

41:09.920 --> 41:15.280
them to look and see and test again to see if those were really good products or that that company

41:15.280 --> 41:20.720
was doing what they were doing there were so many instant startup companies that bought molecular

41:20.720 --> 41:26.960
biological tools ordered the reagents and purported to be doing weekly testing for police departments

41:26.960 --> 41:32.160
in places all around the United States and all of those companies are gone they're gone

41:32.720 --> 41:38.240
the companies that made millions of dollars testing police officers every day in California

41:38.240 --> 41:44.880
those companies are gone so we can't look at what amplicons they amplified what primers they used

41:44.880 --> 41:50.160
what what machines they worked on we don't even know if their protocols are still on a piece of

41:50.160 --> 41:55.600
paper somewhere and they're all gone and so what you need to ask those people to get them started

41:55.680 --> 42:02.640
is to think what would have happened if this large group of products and equipment and machines

42:02.640 --> 42:08.320
was rolled out in 2018 and all of these places at the same time and they started testing do you

42:08.320 --> 42:13.680
actually believe they would have found nothing until October of 2019 and that you would have

42:13.680 --> 42:19.280
been able to chart its accurate spread from Wuhan all around the world because that's what they

42:19.280 --> 42:25.760
want you to believe and there is no precedence in biological history for a molecule of RNA

42:25.760 --> 42:32.000
to be able to high fidelity copy itself for five years sustained it's never even come close

42:32.800 --> 42:38.240
and so if you can point out that what we are essentially doing is taking lots of pictures

42:38.240 --> 42:43.600
that we never took before and claiming that look every time I take a picture in my backyard I see

42:43.680 --> 42:50.400
a cardinal you have no pictures from 2018 and so you claim that the cardinals just came

42:50.400 --> 42:55.520
and they're infesting your backyard but you if you had pictures from 2018 you would see

42:55.520 --> 43:00.800
that the cardinals were there too and so we've got the big picture is trying to make people

43:00.800 --> 43:08.160
understand that the possibility is endless because we were we've gone from not measuring anything

43:08.880 --> 43:16.320
to having a million thermometers in every in every location in the world and then claiming

43:16.320 --> 43:23.760
there's global warming we have no measurements from before 2020 so how can you put this into context

43:23.760 --> 43:28.880
especially when you're taking the test seriously even when you don't have symptoms that's where

43:29.440 --> 43:34.080
you know this all spiraled out of control was the idea that we could track this

43:34.640 --> 43:41.120
this RNA even when symptoms weren't present these tests were were purported to be meaningful

43:41.120 --> 43:48.640
and so if you combine these four or five observations that there were 254 at the maximum sometime

43:49.680 --> 43:55.200
different diagnostics that are all gone now and that we don't have any control data from

43:55.200 --> 43:59.680
pre pandemic to know whether any of these diagnostics would have brought the same signal then

44:00.560 --> 44:07.200
and so therefore the idea that this is just the evidence that we need to understand that there

44:07.200 --> 44:15.120
is a phenomenon happening now that started but wasn't happening in 2019 is is just an absolutely

44:15.120 --> 44:20.240
false dichotomy that we cannot accept it's not either or it is that it could have always been

44:20.240 --> 44:28.320
there or a signal that was there could be confounded as as this agent and and it's so much safer

44:29.120 --> 44:35.200
for the people that run the show for it to be a giant pile of of misleading statements and

44:35.200 --> 44:41.200
and outright lies then it is to be some combination of cover-up and bio-weapon

44:43.280 --> 44:49.360
yeah it's just about deception and as you pointed out the protocols were what caused the uh uh uh

44:49.360 --> 44:53.520
well you didn't point out here but you have that the protocols was what spiked the mortality and

44:53.520 --> 44:59.680
that there was no spread from country to country that showed up that with the it just it the only

44:59.680 --> 45:06.240
thing there was a pandemic of was fear and compliance that that's the way it looks like to me as you

45:06.240 --> 45:12.080
just said you know that's the before we go to break i think it's coming soon um the idea that

45:12.480 --> 45:18.960
what they did was have us focus on the wrong questions in 2020 and 2021 so the you and i wouldn't

45:18.960 --> 45:22.720
notice that they were killing people with ventilators we wouldn't notice that they were killing people

45:22.800 --> 45:29.760
with with anesthesia on on and revdesivir we wouldn't notice that they were they were killing people

45:29.760 --> 45:35.520
in old folks homes and we would be thrown these numbers out of context and the confusion and

45:35.520 --> 45:41.680
uncertainty and doubt that those numbers and their the illusion of consensus on tv and social media

45:41.680 --> 45:48.720
about what those numbers meant made us very very unlikely to question the basis for what they were

45:48.720 --> 45:54.240
saying and the basis for their projections and it took us because of the effectiveness of this

45:54.240 --> 45:58.880
operation and getting us to solve the mystery of the novel virus and whether they were lying about

45:58.880 --> 46:05.600
it being a lab leak or a natural virus got us to avoid answering asking the question of do we really

46:05.600 --> 46:11.520
have something here or not and that was what it was it was panicking us into asking the wrong

46:11.520 --> 46:17.440
questions for three years and if we asked the right questions in 2020 like some of these people were

46:17.440 --> 46:24.880
we would have avoided this mess entirely i think it's clear that this was a military operation

46:24.880 --> 46:32.080
it absolutely war crime committed against every person on the planet it this depopulation agenda

46:32.080 --> 46:37.920
is part of it but it's also about creating that new control grid with the central bank digital

46:37.920 --> 46:44.720
currency the vaccine passport the the proximity sensors with this little nsa low jack i have in

46:44.720 --> 46:50.480
my hand i call it you know this thing is a weapons platform i talk about that a lot too and

46:50.480 --> 46:57.600
it just that's part of the whole thing is um part of a whole you know you have to they're bringing

46:57.600 --> 47:03.440
this together as a control grid it's not one thing or another and that that part's really scary i

47:03.440 --> 47:07.440
really appreciate you coming on we don't have a break until a couple of minutes but you guys next

47:07.520 --> 47:18.720
hour if you have questions for JJ you could call 512-248-8252 that's 512-248-8252

47:18.720 --> 47:24.640
i wanted to let your chat know that too so next hour we'll take some callers and

47:26.400 --> 47:30.640
you just mentioned red wine steam too how he was put in place and a lot of other people were put

47:30.640 --> 47:37.360
in place to create this this thing and i saw something with him the other day and it uh

47:37.360 --> 47:41.280
would you want to you want to speak about that what the you said that the fair and cleavage

47:41.280 --> 47:46.000
site and all that yes sir go ahead sure so what i think um one of the things that people are

47:46.000 --> 47:50.160
forgetting or some of the things that are easy to forget if you weren't involved in it like i was

47:50.160 --> 47:56.000
from the very beginning is that in 2020 there were a certain parts of this biological narrative

47:56.000 --> 48:00.240
that were emphasized by everyone and some of the people that were emphasizing it early had no

48:00.240 --> 48:05.760
business knowing it and this this comes down to this fear and cleavage site which is essentially

48:05.760 --> 48:12.400
an enzymatic cleavage site which was purported to be an unnatural signature in the spike protein

48:12.400 --> 48:19.360
of the original virus and so here you have a bunch of people in the backwoods of the internet that

48:19.360 --> 48:25.440
are already aware of the spike protein of coronavirus is being the immunogenic protein and already

48:25.440 --> 48:31.200
aware that a fear and cleavage site is dangerous and some of the people that were made aware of

48:31.200 --> 48:36.480
this were had to have been planted because in the end the fear and cleavage site wasn't tracked

48:36.480 --> 48:40.560
they didn't wait for the cleavage site to disappear and then announced that the fear and cleavage

48:40.560 --> 48:46.960
site had gone away in in variant v and so now it was much safer they started this whole narrative

48:46.960 --> 48:52.480
in 2020 with the idea that the fear and cleavage site and we've heard this just recently from the

48:52.560 --> 48:57.600
us right to know story that the fear and cleavage site is what allowed the virus to become the most

48:57.600 --> 49:03.280
infectious virus in a hundred years but then if it's such an important aspect of the virulence

49:03.280 --> 49:07.600
and the infectivity of the virus why weren't we tracking the presence of the fear and cleavage

49:07.600 --> 49:13.440
site for the entire pandemic and we were sequencing it we were sequencing the whole virus but nobody

49:13.440 --> 49:17.360
ever talked about whether the fear and cleavage site was changing or disappearing or whether some

49:17.360 --> 49:25.200
variants still had it and others didn't and this is a key key thing to see that we were encouraged

49:25.200 --> 49:30.640
to argue about that for a year and a half and in reality it was never meaningful and in fact

49:30.640 --> 49:34.720
what we should have been arguing about is should we be using remdesivir on old people

49:34.720 --> 49:39.200
should we be giving these people antibiotics or not should we be using steroids or not

49:39.200 --> 49:45.280
because instead they had a protocol and if you declared people if you declared that people were

49:45.280 --> 49:49.360
covid then you were completely off the hook for any malpractice and you could do whatever you

49:49.360 --> 49:55.680
want as long as it was on the cdc protocol it's really frightening um that that's that's the deal

49:55.680 --> 49:59.920
with the protocols is they they distracted us so that we wouldn't notice that they were creating

49:59.920 --> 50:05.520
these mass casualty events that they could misconstrue us we'll be right back folks uh yeah thanks very

50:05.520 --> 50:20.160
much schedule we'll be right back

50:24.080 --> 50:33.520
i was born in dixieland on a reconstructed till the end in carolina i was raised by my granddaddy

50:33.520 --> 50:43.680
in my daddy's way they both taught me right from wrong how to fight and how to get along

50:43.680 --> 50:49.440
but my own life now is almost gone in southern ground i belong

homeowners are you in foreclosure expecting to be served with a foreclosure lawsuit or

51:06.000 --> 51:11.680
suspect your lender has coerced you into an illegal mortgage transaction a huge number of mortgages

51:11.680 --> 51:17.040
made in the last ten years have legal issues and are possibly defective state laws and the u.s.

51:27.440 --> 51:32.320
closing the loan it may be defective and you may be paying the wrong party and the lender may

51:32.320 --> 51:37.120
not have standing or the right to foreclose or collect payments under the law if you would like

53:20.320 --> 53:25.040
it's because it works better than opioids and is actually healthy for you

however cb d oil is stripped of all other helpful compounds found in the hemp plants

and welcome back thought criminals uh you listen to thought crime live on republic

54:14.800 --> 54:21.040
broadcasting network dot o rg and let me turn it back over to you jj you got interrupted there

54:21.040 --> 54:26.400
we were talking about whether this thing even it really was it ever really sequence does it even

54:26.400 --> 54:32.080
you know that it was all a tool of control and and manipulation i believe

54:33.040 --> 54:39.520
uh yeah thanks um the the two things that we talked about in the previous breaks one was

54:39.520 --> 54:45.280
just the misrepresentation of of transfection as a methodology that might be useful in healthy

54:45.280 --> 54:50.720
humans and the other one was talking about the misleading sort of exaggeration of the

54:51.200 --> 54:57.920
the power of ai and what ai really is versus what it isn't um i think one of the things to combine

54:57.920 --> 55:02.880
those two ideas together would be to make people realize that transfection which is this

55:03.680 --> 55:13.120
general term which describes the use of dna or rna to express a protein in anywhere so if you use

55:13.120 --> 55:20.240
it in a cell culture it's transfection if you use rna or dna to express a protein in a in a mouse

55:20.240 --> 55:25.760
it's transfection if you do it with injection into a plant it's transfection and so this is a

55:25.760 --> 55:29.920
very general term that's been around for a long time and there's lots of companies that have had

55:29.920 --> 55:36.240
various products called transfection agents that have been like lip effectamine or gold particles

55:36.240 --> 55:44.400
or you can even use electricity to do it so the idea of applying transfection to usefully augment

55:44.400 --> 55:52.080
the human genome or the human the human animal is something that they have seen as a coming

55:52.080 --> 55:58.720
technology for many many years but they've also known that there's no way to usefully start to

55:58.720 --> 56:06.960
understand how to employ this methodology by by doing proxy studies in in mice or in monkeys

56:06.960 --> 56:14.240
and the reason why those don't work is because the the complications that that that are a mouse

56:14.240 --> 56:20.320
or the complications that are a monkey and the the complex sort of pattern integrity

56:20.320 --> 56:26.480
that those animals are they are sufficiently specific and sufficiently different from our own

56:26.480 --> 56:32.240
that although we can learn general principles about how these biological systems work by

56:32.320 --> 56:38.880
studying those animals what we learn from monkeys and mice as we get more sophisticated becomes

56:38.880 --> 56:46.320
ever more specific for mice and monkeys and ever more non relevant for our own biology and they

56:46.320 --> 56:52.880
have known this for decades Steve so one of the things they need to do is to to transform the way

56:52.880 --> 56:57.920
our children think about their own sovereignty over their bodies so that they accept the fact

56:57.920 --> 57:02.480
that if we're going to get to this next stage of medicine which is personalized medicine

57:02.480 --> 57:07.680
you're going to have to accept that we don't test things in randomized control trials anymore we

57:07.680 --> 57:13.680
test things on you and so this is really part of the inversion that was going on right now was

57:13.680 --> 57:20.400
trying to invert the idea that you have the choice no now we're telling you what you have to do

57:20.400 --> 57:24.960
and this inversion is not for us they knew that we were going to complain until we were dead

57:24.960 --> 57:29.600
but it's for our kids and that's really what that's why I keep emphasizing it they want us to

57:29.600 --> 57:38.400
pass this this compliance onto our kids yes I agree if we I see it in the young ones that are

57:38.400 --> 57:43.840
always on the screen just like you were talking about how we oh how we were bored as kid oh I

57:43.920 --> 57:50.000
hear the top of the hour folks we'll be taking your calls all next hour hang on thought criminals

57:50.000 --> 57:52.560
we write back

58:13.840 --> 58:30.080
oh

58:43.840 --> 58:49.840

What needed to be done is to object to every single state.

59:38.840 --> 59:41.840
The COVID-19 virus was the same.

59:41.840 --> 59:45.840
