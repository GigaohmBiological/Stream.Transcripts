WEBVTT

00:24.423 --> 00:27.644
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

00:39.892 --> 00:40.312
Testing 1, 2.

00:41.033 --> 00:41.353
Test 1, 2.

00:42.053 --> 00:43.874
Good evening, good afternoon, good morning.

00:43.954 --> 00:45.055
Fletch, good to see you.

00:45.075 --> 00:46.756
12.23 in Pittsburgh.

00:46.836 --> 00:49.737
Coming at you hard and fast this morning.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.639
Hopefully I got about an hour for you, a little less.

00:54.220 --> 00:54.600
We'll see.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.321
I got to be at the gym at 2 still.

00:57.081 --> 00:59.322
And I have other obligations.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.424
But yes, I need to get a stream out there.

01:02.444 --> 01:03.265
I need to see you guys.

01:03.285 --> 01:04.205
I need to say hello.

01:06.206 --> 01:07.387
Let's do it, I guess.

01:10.697 --> 01:10.938
EWA 471

01:20.632 --> 01:26.654
Harry, keep an eye on that point out I gave you.

01:26.774 --> 01:27.594
He's on 122.5.

01:27.794 --> 01:29.015
I'll be right back.

01:29.095 --> 01:37.398
Indianapolis Center, you have any traffic for Ares 31?

01:37.518 --> 01:38.338
Ares 31 negative.

01:38.558 --> 01:45.261
The only traffic I have is a TWA L-1011 in your 6 o'clock position, range 15 miles.

01:46.421 --> 01:49.082
And an Allegheny DC-9 in your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

01:50.567 --> 01:53.849
Standby 1, I'll take a look at broads and over.

01:54.050 --> 01:56.952
Aries 31 has traffic 2 o'clock, slightly above and descending.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.033
Aries 31, roger.

01:59.593 --> 02:01.835
I have a primary target about that position now.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.617
I have no known high-altitude traffic.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.638
Standby 1, I'll check low, over.

02:07.579 --> 02:09.600
Dick, will you check low altitude and see if they know who this is?

02:09.620 --> 02:13.423
Senator Aries 31, the traffic's not lower than us.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.590
One o'clock now, still above me and descending.

02:18.111 --> 02:21.894
Aries 31, can you say aircraft type?

02:21.954 --> 02:23.396
Negative, Senator.

02:23.416 --> 02:24.616
No distinct outline.

02:25.317 --> 02:28.660
To tell you the truth, the target is rather brilliant.

02:29.580 --> 02:35.045
It has the brightest anti-collision lights I think I've ever seen, alternating white to red.

02:35.065 --> 02:37.667
The colors are a little striking.

02:39.038 --> 02:40.680
Center, this is TWA 5-17.

02:41.721 --> 02:44.725
Traffic now looks like extra bright landing lights.

02:45.185 --> 02:47.368
I thought Ares had his landing lights off.

02:49.690 --> 02:51.072
Could be a satellite.

02:51.172 --> 02:55.938
Ares 31, I have the primary target now in your 10 o'clock position, five miles away.

02:57.648 --> 02:58.109
Wait a second.

02:58.129 --> 02:58.489
Stand by one.

03:12.336 --> 03:13.017
Okay, Senator.

03:13.197 --> 03:14.698
Aries 31, the traffic has turned.

03:14.738 --> 03:16.660
He's heading right for my White Hill.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.823
We're turning right immediately and leaving flight level 350 now.

03:19.963 --> 03:22.345
Aries 31, descend and maintain flight level 310.

03:23.005 --> 03:25.087
Ray Gallegany, triple four, turn right 30 degrees.

03:25.107 --> 03:26.989
Get on the order of the 45th recon way.

03:27.009 --> 03:28.810
See what the hell they could be testing up there.

03:28.850 --> 03:30.372
This is Lindenapolis Center.

03:30.492 --> 03:34.175
Do you have any test operation in the restricted area 2508?

03:34.315 --> 03:34.996
Aries 31, roger.

03:35.819 --> 03:40.583
The traffic is quite luminous and is exhibiting some non-ballistic motion, over.

03:40.603 --> 03:41.163
Roger, Ares 31.

03:41.203 --> 03:42.664
Continue to send it to your discretion, over.

03:43.025 --> 03:43.665
Okay, center.

03:43.985 --> 03:45.747
Center pilot's discretion is approved.

03:46.007 --> 03:49.550
The traffic is approaching head-on, ultra-right, and really moving.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.431
And right by us, right now.

03:51.591 --> 03:53.213
Now, that was really close.

03:53.413 --> 03:56.775
Ares 31 is out of 3-4-0 on the traffic pattern.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.297
Ask them if they want to report officially.

03:58.317 --> 04:00.478
DWA 517, do you want to report a UFO, over?

04:07.282 --> 04:10.223
EWA 517, do you want to report a UFO, over?

04:11.884 --> 04:15.305
Negative, we don't want to report.

04:16.405 --> 04:18.706
Ares 31, do you wish to report a UFO, over?

04:19.667 --> 04:25.369
Negative, we don't want to report one of those either.

04:25.469 --> 04:27.450
Ares 31, do you wish to file a report of any kind, over?

04:29.070 --> 04:32.992
I would know what kind of report to file, Senator.

04:33.092 --> 04:33.972
Ares 31, me neither.

04:34.512 --> 04:36.373
I'll try to track traffic to destination, over.

04:42.261 --> 04:44.902
Run into the tunnel.

04:46.323 --> 04:49.644
You have to go as fast as you can.

04:52.284 --> 04:53.865
You can trust me.

04:54.365 --> 04:57.206
It's real.

04:57.386 --> 04:57.826
It's real.

05:02.035 --> 05:07.239
I'm actually going to pause this for one second and see how quickly I can get YouTube running.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.882
I forgot to open up a second window for that and it might start right now.

05:09.902 --> 05:10.262
Who knows?

05:28.865 --> 05:30.826
Let me see if that works.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.747
History here.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.968
Let's see that one.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.669
No, that's not working.

05:42.310 --> 05:43.650
Let me see if I can do this.

05:43.670 --> 05:47.151
Hold on a second.

05:48.412 --> 05:48.912
Dismiss.

05:51.459 --> 05:52.640
It's now loading again.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.020
Murder and lies for what?

05:54.420 --> 05:55.981
Oh, excellent connection.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.961
And let me see if I see my little stream here.

05:59.021 --> 06:00.762
If I see it pop up, I'm gonna go.

06:00.782 --> 06:03.023
Go gadget.

06:04.063 --> 06:04.663
Come on now.

06:05.183 --> 06:05.684
Show it to me.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.004
Talk to me goose.

06:08.144 --> 06:09.185
Do we have it?

06:09.965 --> 06:10.885
I hope we have it.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.107
I still don't actually see it running.

06:20.475 --> 06:23.077
It says excellent connection, but I don't see it running.

06:24.638 --> 06:30.781
I'm gonna stop this and then I'm gonna start it again.

06:30.821 --> 06:31.782
I wonder if that'll work.

06:33.543 --> 06:34.043
Yes!

06:34.203 --> 06:35.404
We got YouTube going.

06:35.584 --> 06:38.806
I will, uh... I think it's working now.

06:38.926 --> 06:40.907
I think I'm gonna get back to going here.

06:41.208 --> 06:41.468
Uh, yeah.

06:41.528 --> 06:42.368
It looks like it's running.

06:42.608 --> 06:43.129
Let's do it.

06:43.349 --> 06:43.849
Let's do it.

06:44.029 --> 06:44.289
Do it.

06:44.369 --> 06:44.630
Do it.

06:44.690 --> 06:44.950
Do it.

06:47.052 --> 06:47.933
Yes, yes.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.075
Great to see you guys.

06:49.956 --> 06:50.717
Good to be here.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.679
That was Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

06:52.739 --> 06:56.865
One of the best movie scenes ever shot, quite frankly.

06:57.165 --> 07:00.449
And it was just a bunch of American guys working in an airport.

07:02.532 --> 07:19.490
putting hands on each other's shoulders uh and the uh feature guy who kept his cool through the whole thing was the african-american dude the black guy um again one of those things you just don't see portrayed in the movies anymore where white guys and black guys

07:20.211 --> 07:23.692
work together in the same office and race isn't an issue.

07:24.833 --> 07:34.456
There was actually a black guy in the background working too, so it was almost like a real representation of what modern America was in the 80s.

07:35.076 --> 07:36.997
And then something really bad happened.

07:37.037 --> 07:38.957
I don't know what happened, but a bunch of...

07:40.981 --> 07:44.885
A bunch of people messed with what was going on when I was a kid, ladies and gentlemen.

07:44.965 --> 07:51.791
This stream is dedicated to the memory of Brandy Vaughn, someone who said it exactly right when no one else around her would.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.272
My name is Jonathan Couey.

07:53.292 --> 07:55.434
I'm the chief biologist of GigaOM Biological.

07:55.454 --> 07:57.416
I'm coming to you out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.919
I presented to a number of people throughout the course of the pandemic.

08:00.959 --> 08:01.500
You can find

08:02.020 --> 08:06.341
my work from my academic career on the National Library of Medicine.

08:06.821 --> 08:13.242
I've presented for most of the groups that we have come to understand as dissident groups.

08:13.282 --> 08:14.663
They're not really dissident groups.

08:14.763 --> 08:20.844
Instead, they appear to be sabotage-controlled opposition where the truth is never going to get out there.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.445
And there are victims, there are unwitting victims, there are even people that have probably been

08:26.405 --> 08:28.927
the victim of a giant Truman show for their whole lives.

08:30.528 --> 08:41.755
Fortunately for my children and for my friends, anybody following me, not very many people, the truth is out there and I think we're very, very close.

08:42.175 --> 08:44.196
You see that train there whistling the truth.

08:45.457 --> 08:48.499
There's a lot of meddlers on that picture right there, but right there,

08:50.318 --> 08:54.061
Drawn by Ben Garrison himself is Jonathan Cui.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.544
I'm working on a new series on the basketball court.

08:57.564 --> 09:02.668
I'm also working on a new biology curriculum for high school students and freshmen in college.

09:03.348 --> 09:09.734
And actually, to my own surprise, I think I'm going to be ready to start teaching that biology next week.

09:11.047 --> 09:23.707
I will be updating my schedule on my Google schedule so that it shows up on the calendar on Gigaohm Biological and I will definitely

09:26.505 --> 09:27.566
Next week, we're going to start.

09:27.887 --> 09:38.137
It's going to be a lot of study halls at first to try and get some of these ideas out there and make sure that nobody mistakes these for me claiming all of these ideas as my own.

09:39.219 --> 09:47.447
Rather, I think I'm just going to be one of the few people in recent memory who's going to attempt to bring some of these ideas back to the fore.

09:48.348 --> 10:03.958
and frame them correctly so that we can also, as we teach our kids biology as a principle of pattern integrity, so as we teach our kids the truth listed there in the lower, what is that side of the screen there?

10:03.978 --> 10:04.859
That's the right side.

10:05.519 --> 10:06.560
RNA cannot pandemic.

10:06.600 --> 10:12.244
Intramuscular injections or dumb transfection was always a crime and population pyramids are a real problem in need of solving.

10:12.785 --> 10:17.568
If you want to support this work, please go to Gigome Biological and find a way to help us.

10:18.189 --> 10:20.230
We are always running on fumes here.

10:20.270 --> 10:23.252
We've always been running on fumes except for when we were being paid by

10:24.733 --> 10:25.834
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

10:25.914 --> 10:31.676
And so as sad as it makes me to say it, I do need your help.

10:31.796 --> 10:32.817
I do need your support.

10:33.397 --> 10:35.538
And I will humbly accept any amount.

10:37.158 --> 10:41.940
And some people even just send, you know, 10 bucks in cash to the P.O.

10:41.980 --> 10:42.281
Box.

10:42.501 --> 10:46.722
And even that helps because cash still works in America and my family eats.

10:46.742 --> 10:47.183
So

10:48.643 --> 10:52.645
We also spend a little bit of the family money on stream.gigaom.bio.

10:52.665 --> 10:55.646
So if you are going to share the work, please go there.

10:55.987 --> 10:58.268
And we are also live streaming there.

10:58.488 --> 11:02.930
And if you can check on that stream and let me know how it's going, let me know that you see it there.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.350
Let me know that there are some viewers there.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.431
That also helps keep me encouraged a lot.

11:06.591 --> 11:11.073
And if you want to have a conversation with your fellow viewers, please go to gigaom.bio.

11:11.093 --> 11:11.914
We also pay for that.

11:12.874 --> 11:15.836
And those accounts will be eventually linked.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.797
I'm not sure where Ted is on that development.

11:17.837 --> 11:18.957
Anyway, it's long story short.

11:21.219 --> 11:21.879
We're working hard.

11:43.048 --> 12:06.227
and wow guess what ladies and gentlemen that's it that is it we are just gonna cut right over here and i'm gonna say good morning my name is jonathan cooey i'm coming to you live out of pittsburgh pennsylvania i have got a very quick stream for you no introduction no big hammering on what's going on here i just want to show you a video i want to do a study hall this is a ramp up to the beginning of a new biology 101

12:07.548 --> 12:27.703
And I assure you, over the last couple weeks, things have started to move faster and faster as the new model of Biology 101 comes into focus and it starts to sort of spontaneously align with so many points in history, observations in history that would otherwise be kind of dangling.

12:28.684 --> 12:30.526
And that's what I find most spectacular.

12:30.566 --> 12:40.534
It's also going to reorient ourselves with regard to what mentors in the past we look up to, what thought leaders we look to in the past for guidance.

12:41.135 --> 12:47.741
Because I think up until this point, we have been led to believe that we should take our guidance from fools.

12:48.842 --> 12:53.506
And I don't mean fools in the sense of idiots.

12:53.586 --> 12:55.807
I mean fools in the sense of people who were

12:56.788 --> 13:02.796
wittingly or unwittingly put in front of us with these bad ideas, with these mythologies, to perpetuate them.

13:03.336 --> 13:04.217
And it's not our fault.

13:04.277 --> 13:06.180
Remember, it's not our fault, ladies and gentlemen.

13:06.240 --> 13:10.525
It's actually our parents' fault that we inherited these people.

13:10.545 --> 13:11.286
It is the 26th of March, 2025.

13:15.026 --> 13:18.128
roughly five years to to pull our heads out.

13:18.188 --> 13:25.711
And some of us have been able to make progress in our understanding and others of us have been stuck in a script that we are paid to be stuck in.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.592
That is the unfortunate message.

13:29.053 --> 13:30.974
It's not a message that everybody likes.

13:31.054 --> 13:35.816
It's not a fun message to tell everybody that you've been lied to.

13:36.016 --> 13:40.298
But if you want to start somewhere, we need to begin with the truth.

13:42.114 --> 13:45.658
And up until now, there's nobody on social media giving that away for free.

13:45.898 --> 13:48.040
That's the most important thing to understand.

13:48.140 --> 13:52.785
Elon Musk did not buy Twitter to give the truth away for free.

13:53.285 --> 13:58.350
And so that is the message of hope, that the truth's available, it's just not available for free on social media.

13:58.370 --> 14:06.438
You gotta come to that realization and accept it as fact, and then you can start to move forward to look for and try to start with the truth.

14:07.865 --> 14:14.491
And in my humble opinion, the 30,000 foot view is that the truth is, this is for all the marbles.

14:14.551 --> 14:16.352
This is for our grandchildren.

14:16.953 --> 14:26.541
These people are playing a multi-generational game that ends in our grandchildren's enslavement and their enslavement to a technocratic world government.

14:26.881 --> 14:27.581
That's it.

14:28.916 --> 14:35.599
They're going to be chipped, and they're going to be tracked, and they're going to be monitored, and they're going to be used as an experimental animal.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.900
That is the plan.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.281
And they're going to like it.

14:42.099 --> 14:46.900
And so it is tough message for some people to hear that it is just murder and lies.

14:46.961 --> 14:48.121
Whoops, that way, that way.

14:48.721 --> 14:54.283
It's just murder and lies that we witnessed over the last five years.

14:54.363 --> 15:00.585
And it is just a anticipated rise in all cause mortality that was sculpted using murder and lies.

15:00.645 --> 15:02.665
That is a tough message to bring.

15:03.206 --> 15:10.968
It's not a fun message, but it is a hopeful one because what that means is if these murder and lies, if they have an explanation,

15:12.145 --> 15:15.547
then we don't need to fear all of these mythologies.

15:15.607 --> 15:18.768
We don't need to be afraid that we're not up to date on our shots.

15:18.828 --> 15:25.292
We don't need to be afraid so much of what we put in our mouths as we need to be afraid of what we put in needles.

15:28.837 --> 15:31.958
That's really the truth that we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.218
That's where we're going to start.

15:33.258 --> 15:36.319
The illusion requires your participation to sustain.

15:36.980 --> 15:40.121
Transfection in healthy people was always a crime.

15:40.161 --> 15:49.864
This is where my journey started because I had used transfection as an academic and understood that they were not investigational vaccines, but just a joke.

15:51.869 --> 15:58.173
The second thing that I've kind of figured out, it took me a couple years later, almost three years later, is that RNA cannot pandemic.

15:58.633 --> 16:06.839
The molecule of RNA, the concept of RNA being the foundation of a pandemic is biochemically ridiculous.

16:07.773 --> 16:16.639
And I think a lot of these people know it, and they have to be in place to sustain that illusion by insisting that this is a phenomenon that can actually occur.

16:17.340 --> 16:22.764
I'm not even sure that any form of pandemic, except for maybe a virus, I mean, sorry.

16:24.378 --> 16:30.400
Maybe a bacteria or maybe a bacteriophage could spread in what would be described as a pandemic.

16:30.440 --> 16:47.306
But the idea of an RNA virus that replicates in our cells and does whatever they say it does with its constitution essentially being the coronavirus cartoon is the ultimate in absurdity.

16:48.308 --> 16:53.630
And finally, the conclusion that took me a lot longer to say out loud.

16:53.730 --> 17:00.772
It took me actually nine years after Brandy Vaughn was able to say it out loud, was I able to have the guts to say, you know what?

17:01.652 --> 17:04.953
I'm gonna say it out loud and see if any doctor corrects me.

17:05.674 --> 17:06.895
And that was about a year ago.

17:07.616 --> 17:09.417
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

17:10.078 --> 17:11.279
I was saying it longer.

17:11.339 --> 17:17.464
I was saying that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

17:17.844 --> 17:23.269
But I think you can just take the all caps there because no doctor has been able to challenge that.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.371
No doctor has bothered to send me an email.

17:25.851 --> 17:28.053
By the way, here are the four exceptions.

17:29.963 --> 17:39.031
Just like no one has ever been able to justify why they didn't call it transfection in 2020 like I did and insisted that they do.

17:40.192 --> 17:44.095
Kevin McKernan cannot explain why he didn't tell everybody it was a transfection.

17:44.696 --> 17:51.081
Brian Hooker with 16 years of genetic transfection and transformation experience in plants.

17:53.444 --> 17:57.987
could have told you it was a transfection and transformation in 2020, but did not.

17:58.548 --> 18:05.413
He also could have told you that Brandy Vaughn had an excellent way of explaining that intramuscular injection is dumb, but he did not.

18:07.214 --> 18:13.558
Brian Hooker could have also told you at the beginning of 2020 that he has been fighting to get everyone to understand that the U.S.

18:13.598 --> 18:16.921
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise, but he did not.

18:18.817 --> 18:32.763
And the reason why that they did not is because these people were all put in place to make sure that we wouldn't learn the requisite biology to understand what was happening, to understand the multi-generational game that already started with our parents.

18:36.314 --> 18:42.780
And so these ideas have been around a long time and these people have known that they're going to push these ideas for a long time.

18:43.260 --> 18:57.172
That's why there is an unblemished track record of them pushing these ideas even before they were plausible, even after lots of information and ideas and observations came to light that were contrary to their assumptions.

18:57.915 --> 19:02.141
They still think that AI with the right amount of data is going to solve this problem.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.544
That's what the murder and lies were for.

19:05.205 --> 19:07.488
The Human Genome Project is ongoing.

19:09.391 --> 19:11.814
It is a sort of biosecurity imperative.

19:13.271 --> 19:19.375
And I tried to make this clear, but I'm going to try and make it clear again really quickly here before we go on to the study hall.

19:19.756 --> 19:27.581
The Human Genome Project will require very similar to solving the game of Go or solving the game of chess.

19:27.682 --> 19:31.044
First, they need to know what the data is.

19:31.144 --> 19:32.025
What is a game?

19:33.306 --> 19:40.571
And the game, one single example of a game would be my child and her genome.

19:41.255 --> 19:44.317
and all of our medical data from birth to death.

19:45.738 --> 19:49.520
That would be a perfect game of the Human Genome Project.

19:50.313 --> 19:52.894
and now they need as many of those as possible.

19:52.934 --> 20:14.444
So first of all, understand that even sequencing the genome is still not something that all people in the field agree upon how it would be done, how it should be organized, and how it could be organized across people and races and ethnicities and backgrounds so that we could make comparisons that were useful

20:18.547 --> 20:27.071
And the wonderful thing about it is, is that it does not take into account the fact that the genome itself is expressing on an environment.

20:27.131 --> 20:29.172
It's on a set of conditions.

20:29.772 --> 20:32.954
And those conditions can be optimal or they can be suboptimal.

20:33.814 --> 20:37.136
And the resulting phenotype will be very different depending on whether

20:38.075 --> 20:40.736
the conditions are optimal or suboptimal.

20:41.416 --> 20:59.040
And that means even our phenotypic readout of the genome, which we are going to use to interpret the presence of genes, the presence of mutations, is all subject to an entire developmental time course which changes the phenotype of the genes depending on

20:59.560 --> 21:08.363
the individual conditions present and whether they're optimal or suboptimal using as broad a terms as possible so that you can understand the picture I'm trying to paint.

21:08.983 --> 21:13.925
They don't even know what all the data is for a single individual.

21:13.945 --> 21:22.968
20 years ago it was what we'll sequence all the DNA and then we'll keep track of all their medical data and what they eat.

21:24.898 --> 21:32.420
And then it got more and more and more and more sophisticated as they understood the necessity that the game was so complicated.

21:33.501 --> 21:37.242
You know, you might sit down at the table of a Go game and think, wow, this is pretty simple.

21:37.302 --> 21:39.743
I guess I just, it's black and white chips.

21:39.803 --> 21:41.603
And then if they're surrounded, they turn over.

21:41.623 --> 21:42.444
That's pretty simple.

21:42.464 --> 21:43.244
It's like Connect Four.

21:46.260 --> 21:53.644
But then you realize the permutations of the game start to multiply in your head, and you realize you have no concept of how to win that game.

21:54.245 --> 22:06.492
That realization that you could have as a thought experiment when you've never played the game Go, or maybe even never played the game Chess, you could have that thought experiment with a more limited set of outcomes.

22:07.153 --> 22:14.237
And still, you would not be close to the... They're still quantifying this problem.

22:17.023 --> 22:21.266
What degree of the perfect human genome game do they need per person?

22:21.847 --> 22:27.170
Can they get away with just sequencing all of the college kids with COVID tests?

22:27.271 --> 22:38.579
Is that going to be enough to interface back with the EPIC database and then rematch the de-identified records to the genotype and then they'll have this data and will that be enough to shed light on something new?

22:40.435 --> 22:42.617
Because these are the real questions that they are asking.

22:43.137 --> 22:47.240
Then they need to store this data in such a way so that they can ship it around.

22:47.260 --> 22:54.086
You know, right now, the PBS NewsHour is doing stories about how 23andMe is going out of business.

22:54.146 --> 22:56.507
Where are these millions of genomes going to go?

22:57.929 --> 22:59.290
Are they valuable or not?

22:59.710 --> 23:00.731
Of course they're valuable.

23:03.193 --> 23:04.894
Of course that data is valuable.

23:06.601 --> 23:10.203
probably not just data, it might also be samples to go along with the data.

23:11.103 --> 23:19.527
It might have already been de-identified using, you know, periphery data and metadata and AI just because they can.

23:21.368 --> 23:30.252
Just because the data is de-identified doesn't mean the user of the data has promised to keep it de-identified.

23:31.593 --> 23:34.134
That's something that I don't think anybody really understands.

23:35.299 --> 23:59.191
But one of the reasons why AI and the current CDC director nomination is interested in health records is precisely because using AI and the Human Genome Project data to try and interface with medical records to see signals which correlate with genetic signals is the bare minimum.

24:00.282 --> 24:14.192
that this project could yield and be called an outcome, where they interface with a machine learning algorithm, the data that they stored in a way and a fashion that the machine learning algorithm can use.

24:14.613 --> 24:16.294
This is all in development.

24:18.413 --> 24:30.439
And it would be impossible for this to go forward if they hadn't created the remnant stream of PCR testing that's active in all hospitals and doctors and all over the place.

24:31.019 --> 24:33.761
Because those remnants are producing genomic data.

24:34.588 --> 24:45.431
that can be de-identified and then in the future re-assembled with the existing databases so that they can start running this AI.

24:45.911 --> 24:51.813
Obviously, in the coming generations, they'll be collecting all this data from birth, obviously.

24:51.873 --> 24:55.254
But right now, we're just trying to set up an infrastructure.

24:55.274 --> 24:59.315
We're just trying to set up all the pieces that are necessary.

24:59.355 --> 25:01.496
That's why the digital ID is not there yet.

25:01.556 --> 25:03.437
That's why digital currency is not there yet.

25:04.617 --> 25:07.239
a subdermal implant is not there yet.

25:08.679 --> 25:10.340
It's a stepwise thing.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.802
Why would they want all that data if they have nowhere to store it?

25:16.664 --> 25:23.848
And then after all this is done in 10 or 20 years, they'll start to make predictions which can be validated.

25:25.933 --> 25:27.273
These are all things to come.

25:27.353 --> 25:30.074
These are not things that have already happened or are happening.

25:30.134 --> 25:39.277
Everything else that they've done is low-hanging fruit bullshit that has been distorted as stepwise progress in the Human Genome Project.

25:39.697 --> 25:50.741
And the COVID-19 pandemic theater had a bunch of people connected directly to the Human Genome Project because of this intimate connection.

25:54.298 --> 26:01.480
That's why all the people that could have said, transfection, save myself, didn't say it, even after I asked them to say it.

26:02.980 --> 26:11.943
For years and years and years, until finally they started to make fun of me about it, but not admitting that this might've saved college kids.

26:14.963 --> 26:15.964
Here's the study hall.

26:16.044 --> 26:21.265
In Britain today, diseases that we had almost forgotten have returned.

26:24.932 --> 26:31.895
New outbreaks of measles have occurred, and as a result, some children are already paying the price.

26:34.996 --> 26:37.718
Some say it's all down to this man.

26:39.178 --> 26:49.783
He is convinced that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could be damaging some of the children it's supposed to protect, that it could be causing autism.

26:52.742 --> 26:55.883
But the medical establishment says he is scaremongering.

26:56.923 --> 27:00.084
It claims that the MMR vaccination is safe.

27:03.024 --> 27:08.446
The result has been confusion, and many parents have shunned the MMR jab.

27:10.126 --> 27:14.887
Accusations have been made by both sides, questioning the motives of those involved.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.368
But what does the science show?

27:19.625 --> 27:27.029
Tonight, Horizon reveals new evidence that could provide the answer to the question so many parents have been asking.

27:28.030 --> 27:30.411
Does NMR cause autism?

27:43.839 --> 27:44.880
I would publish that.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.541
I will publish that for you if you want.

27:49.966 --> 27:51.087
I will publish that list.

27:53.068 --> 27:53.889
I don't know who that is.

27:53.949 --> 27:54.689
Yong Insef.

27:54.729 --> 28:00.674
I don't know what, how to say your name, but I would definitely publish that list for you of the EUAs.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.462
John in San Francisco.

28:11.542 --> 28:12.022
I get it.

28:12.102 --> 28:12.382
Nice.

28:12.642 --> 28:13.023
Okay.

28:16.405 --> 28:16.705
Stop it.

28:21.038 --> 28:22.459
So you see where this is, right?

28:22.780 --> 28:23.480
Episode 10, 2005.

28:23.740 --> 28:28.925
It's okay, Jamesy.

28:29.325 --> 28:30.026
Shall we sing a song?

28:30.966 --> 28:32.988
Show me the way to go home.

28:33.008 --> 28:34.950
It's okay, Jamesy.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.691
No.

28:37.152 --> 28:37.892
No, no, no, Jamesy.

28:38.773 --> 28:44.298
Wherever I may roam, you'll always find me singing this song.

28:44.938 --> 28:46.720
Show me the way to go home.

28:47.140 --> 28:47.460
Hey!

28:57.952 --> 29:00.003
Well, James is 11 now and...

29:02.825 --> 29:05.607
We've known he's been autistic since the age of two.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.410
He's quite severely autistic.

29:08.430 --> 29:12.854
He's got no language and he's got quite severe learning difficulties.

29:12.894 --> 29:16.797
So he's on the extreme end of the, the more severe end of the spectrum really.

29:17.878 --> 29:23.063
But he's a lovely boy and he's usually very happy and very affectionate.

29:23.883 --> 29:29.188
But sometimes he gets very frustrated and I think

29:30.369 --> 29:36.093
Perhaps because of his difficulty in communication, he will injure himself.

29:36.113 --> 29:39.956
And then if you try and stop him, he will sometimes get quite aggressive.

29:42.598 --> 29:43.999
Can you press play?

29:45.440 --> 29:45.900
Good boy.

29:48.162 --> 29:48.723
There.

29:49.223 --> 29:55.288
Lawrence is 11 now, and we've known he's had autism since he was about three.

29:56.243 --> 29:56.483
Look.

29:56.824 --> 29:58.767
Wind it up.

29:58.947 --> 29:59.428
Wind it.

29:59.809 --> 30:00.149
Wind it.

30:00.410 --> 30:01.191
Wind it.

30:01.271 --> 30:02.393
If something goes wrong.

30:03.174 --> 30:05.518
Like this.

30:05.558 --> 30:06.520
No, it's working.

30:13.698 --> 30:25.662
Well, he's rewound this this much that it's more or less had it, this video.

30:26.782 --> 30:29.083
But he doesn't understand that.

30:29.183 --> 30:33.104
And as far as he's concerned, I'm not fixing it.

30:33.664 --> 30:36.905
Because I haven't been able to help him with this video now, he's cleared off.

30:36.945 --> 30:37.926
He's gone downstairs.

30:38.626 --> 30:41.347
because I'm no more used to him at the moment.

30:45.527 --> 30:47.828
Lawrence and James both have autism.

30:51.089 --> 30:52.669
Autism is not one disease.

30:53.369 --> 30:57.350
It's thought to be a spectrum of disorders, ranging widely in severity.

31:00.231 --> 31:06.612
But there are three features that are common to all children with autism, the so-called triad of impairments.

31:08.428 --> 31:17.231
One is a lack of the capacity for social engagement, forming social relationships, even recognising that other people are human beings.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.252
He's not interested in other people.

31:19.492 --> 31:21.773
He's only interested in other people to get things for him, really.

31:25.414 --> 31:27.315
I think that's why they don't look at you.

31:28.328 --> 31:33.111
Lawrence can't be bothered to make a lot of eye contact because he's interested in what he's doing.

31:33.131 --> 31:34.651
He doesn't want to know what you're doing.

31:34.671 --> 31:43.316
The second part of the triad is a problem with language, and in the most severe cases, no language at all.

31:44.482 --> 31:45.023
Good boy.

31:48.006 --> 31:51.410
I'd never had any concept of language.

31:51.450 --> 31:59.740
I suppose the earliest manifestation of that sort of problem was, you know, not pointing things out to show people things.

32:01.121 --> 32:04.285
The third part of the triad is a lack of imagination.

32:05.902 --> 32:06.502
There we are.

32:06.842 --> 32:10.224
He's not able to role play or anything like that.

32:10.884 --> 32:19.088
And I think you don't appreciate the imagination of a child until you have a child with no imagination.

32:20.632 --> 32:21.613
Now that's interesting.

32:21.713 --> 32:33.764
So I just want to point out that on this show, the guy started with acknowledging the spectrum of autism and that his kid was on the far end of it.

32:33.924 --> 32:36.727
All of these parents accept that autism is a thing.

32:37.387 --> 32:45.294
The announcer said that it's a spectrum of disorders, which comes closer, I guess, to hitting the mark.

32:47.316 --> 32:55.662
But really, what we're dealing with is what 2013 Brian Hooker said, which is neurological damage from intramuscular injection.

32:55.702 --> 32:58.364
Now, he didn't say intramuscular injection, he said vaccines.

32:59.685 --> 33:10.973
And he also will add later, after 2013, he will emphasize it more, that his kid got a series of shots when he had an ear infection, and so that made it worse.

33:12.153 --> 33:18.918
In this case, we're not talking about anything right now that I hear people talk about regularly with autism.

33:18.958 --> 33:25.422
In fact, there are lots of people on the internet who can record a video and claim to have autism.

33:27.563 --> 33:28.984
They have their own channels.

33:29.906 --> 33:32.507
They have a hard time keeping a job because I have autism.

33:32.987 --> 33:35.929
They don't seem to have problems with social engagement.

33:35.969 --> 33:38.210
They don't seem to have problems with language.

33:39.190 --> 33:45.093
And they don't seem to have a lack of imagination because they can operate a camera and claim that they have autism on YouTube.

33:46.173 --> 33:54.077
This last one, lack of imagination, is really compelling to me because it's been a long time since I've heard anybody describe the symptoms of autism.

33:55.405 --> 33:55.885
as this.

33:57.106 --> 34:05.310
I think Andrew Wakefield says it has something to do with the gut and projectile diarrhea, which is interesting.

34:13.935 --> 34:17.477
Autism is a lifelong condition for which there is no cure.

34:19.238 --> 34:24.641
And what frightens many parents is that increasing numbers of children are now being diagnosed with it.

34:29.409 --> 34:34.553
In Britain, in the 1970s, autism was found in one in 2,000 children.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.777
Since then, there has been an apparent tenfold rise.

34:39.838 --> 34:44.922
Now, at least one child in 200 is diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder.

34:46.803 --> 34:49.145
Other countries have seen a similar rise.

34:51.507 --> 34:56.071
Science had no explanation for why autism should be increasing at such a rate.

34:58.544 --> 35:00.925
But one parent thought she knew the answer.

35:01.805 --> 35:05.507
And this would spark one of the biggest health crises of recent years.

35:08.968 --> 35:12.030
Rosemary Keswick has a 16-year-old son, William.

35:12.050 --> 35:16.892
I think the cat's sitting here forlornly wondering where he is.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.913
This is William's way of school.

35:24.015 --> 35:26.956
William now requires specialist residential care.

35:29.264 --> 35:32.167
But when he was a baby, things were very different.

35:33.888 --> 35:35.450
When William was born, he was wonderful.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.552
I had a great pregnancy, no problems at all.

35:38.993 --> 35:43.777
William was thriving and growing and jolly and bouncy and beautiful.

35:48.641 --> 35:51.163
William had an MMR at 15 months.

35:52.645 --> 35:54.647
And from then on, he

35:57.526 --> 35:59.506
For want of a better word, he disintegrated.

35:59.526 --> 36:15.670
The MMR jab combines three childhood vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella into one injection, which is first given at around 12 to 18 months.

36:17.430 --> 36:20.411
It has virtually eradicated these diseases from the UK.

36:21.331 --> 36:23.912
Throughout the world, it's saved hundreds of lives.

36:24.986 --> 36:25.506
Hundreds!

36:26.026 --> 36:31.709
But shortly after her son had the jab, Rosemary Keswick noticed a change in his behaviour.

36:33.329 --> 36:36.011
He stopped using the beginning words.

36:36.331 --> 36:38.992
So book became ook and ball became awl.

36:39.692 --> 36:46.675
And then over the next 12 months, those words just dissolved and the very last word that he had was juice.

36:47.455 --> 36:54.038
He developed a raging, raging thirst and juice became oos and oos became oo and then it went completely.

36:58.112 --> 37:02.093
William now has no language and severe learning difficulties.

37:02.593 --> 37:20.038
So my father is a special ed teacher and used to work with severely handicapped kids in Indiana when I was a kid and I find myself just constantly wondering if every child that my dad worked with that was severely handicapped in some way or another was a damaged kid even back then.

37:22.155 --> 37:30.720
I just am... Exactly like those kids.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.081
And a lot of these kids were incontinent too.

37:33.941 --> 37:37.103
And they were just called severely retarded kids.

37:37.763 --> 37:39.304
We used to call them retarded.

37:40.484 --> 37:41.285
And it was fine.

37:42.726 --> 37:43.406
That was the word.

37:46.087 --> 37:53.589
I'm just very, very horrified by the fact that, you know, if you just reorient your understanding, you can see it clear as day.

37:53.729 --> 37:56.570
...of autism and just after the MMR.

37:58.210 --> 38:01.271
Rosemary was convinced the three things were connected.

38:02.091 --> 38:12.513
Within days after the vaccination, William was suffering from diarrhoea 10 times a day, which to me as a mother, and especially as William was my second child, was not normal.

38:14.577 --> 38:17.360
I knew he had a problem with the gut.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.222
I knew that everything had changed.

38:21.003 --> 38:26.188
I can give you a link here of the archive of all of these videos.

38:26.508 --> 38:31.833
All seasons, all seasons, all 512 episodes are available right there.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.514
I've already downloaded enough for

38:34.358 --> 38:41.122
a few study halls, let's put it that way, but you can go through it and you will not believe the titles you will find.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.804
It's a gold mine, ladies and gentlemen.

38:43.844 --> 38:45.285
There's the link for you right there.

38:47.186 --> 38:48.787
And I gotta get done, so I'm gonna keep going.

38:49.828 --> 38:54.450
After the MMR, but what I didn't know was what the link was.

38:57.492 --> 39:03.276
It was then that Rosemary came across the work of a doctor working at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.196
His name was Andrew Wakefield.

39:16.219 --> 39:21.601
At the Defeat Autism Now conference in Washington, Andrew Wakefield is the guest of honor.

39:25.842 --> 39:27.343
I love the man for what he's done.

39:27.363 --> 39:28.783
He should get a Nobel Prize.

39:28.843 --> 39:31.244
He's put everything on the line for our children.

39:31.364 --> 39:34.165
A truly good man who bears the truth.

39:35.745 --> 39:42.168
He is now famous throughout the world as the man who proposed a link between autism and MMR.

39:43.109 --> 39:44.610
Looks like he's suffering a lot.

39:45.090 --> 39:45.590
Oh boy.

39:45.610 --> 39:48.972
But back in the 1990s, he knew little about autism.

39:53.594 --> 39:56.556
Dr. Wakefield is an expert in bowel diseases.

39:57.745 --> 40:07.992
He was working on a controversial theory that linked the single measles vaccine to a type of bowel disease called Crohn's, a theory that has never been substantiated.

40:09.633 --> 40:15.116
Wakefield's work didn't involve MMR, but a different vaccine and a different disease.

40:16.377 --> 40:23.842
Still, Rosemary believed he might provide the missing link, how the MMR could have caused her son's problems.

40:25.396 --> 40:35.403
I picked up the phone and phoned Dr Wakefield and said to him, I'm a mother of an autistic child and he stopped me and said, I don't know anything about autism and I'm a gastroenterologist.

40:35.884 --> 40:46.091
And I said, well, I have a theory based on my own observations that the gut itself is the start point of my child's neurological problems.

40:48.812 --> 40:52.994
What an interesting idea that is, you know, to come up with that on your own.

40:53.695 --> 40:54.695
That's a pretty good idea.

40:55.416 --> 40:56.316
I think that's impressive.

40:59.658 --> 41:05.962
At the end of the conversation, I said, by the way, actually, I think that the MMR has something to do with this because that's when my son changed.

41:07.463 --> 41:09.284
The MMR has something to do with it.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.965
That's also an interesting position to take.

41:12.126 --> 41:12.766
I like that.

41:12.926 --> 41:13.306
It's good.

41:17.717 --> 41:19.057
He did not put the phone down on me.

41:22.838 --> 41:29.620
So Rosemary took William to the Royal Free Hospital, where Andrew Wakefield was based, to find out what had happened to him.

41:33.641 --> 41:41.683
There, William was examined using a colonoscope, a flexible camera that allowed the doctors to look inside his bowel.

41:44.699 --> 41:48.661
The colonoscopy revealed that William's bowel was inflamed and scarred.

41:49.881 --> 41:53.983
And the damage wasn't quite like anything that Wakefield had seen before.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.605
It appeared to be a new form of bowel disease.

42:01.406 --> 42:04.508
The children have a patchy inflammation of the colon.

42:04.748 --> 42:10.230
They also have great big swollen lymph glands in the terminal ileum, that is the end of the small intestine.

42:10.913 --> 42:17.080
And that combination, as we call it, ileal hyperplasia, is the core of the gastrointestinal syndrome.

42:20.505 --> 42:24.089
Soon it became clear that William's case wasn't unique.

42:26.804 --> 42:31.449
I started receiving phone calls on the grapevine on the network.

42:31.789 --> 42:35.012
Parents had heard that there was somebody who had discovered something.

42:35.933 --> 42:39.356
And increasingly, parents were coming to me with the same story.

42:39.716 --> 42:42.779
The same thing has happened to their child in exactly the same way.

42:45.101 --> 42:47.544
So Rosemary told them about Dr. Wakefield.

42:49.232 --> 42:58.316
And soon, more and more parents were arriving at the Royal Free with similar stories of bowel disease and autism following the MMR jab.

42:59.897 --> 43:05.760
Interestingly, we set out to study 10 children we thought we might find inflammation, perhaps in one or two based upon the history.

43:06.340 --> 43:11.082
We've now looked at 40 children, and 39 of those have exactly the same findings.

43:11.322 --> 43:12.563
Word perfect sucks!

43:15.504 --> 43:18.546
Doctor Wakefield started trying to put the pieces together.

43:20.799 --> 43:31.150
Could the MMR jab be causing a strange new kind of bowel disease that was turning the children autistic?

43:34.853 --> 43:38.577
Then he started to investigate an even more disturbing possibility.

43:39.458 --> 43:41.340
Could MMR be an explanation?

43:41.380 --> 43:43.402
Seriously, there's somebody outside your window.

43:47.873 --> 43:53.557
If so, the rise in different countries should match the introduction of MMR.

44:00.021 --> 44:09.828
Sure enough, according to Dr. Wakefield, the MMR vaccine had been introduced in the US in the mid-70s, just as autism started to increase.

44:09.888 --> 44:13.531
You know, interesting, Henry, she didn't really say why she thought it was the gut.

44:14.468 --> 44:16.090
She just said she thought it was the gut.

44:17.271 --> 44:20.033
It's actually a great observation.

44:20.354 --> 44:21.175
I missed it too.

44:22.015 --> 44:22.816
I missed it too.

44:22.916 --> 44:33.807
Diarrhea 10 times a day, I guess, but it's not immediately apparent to me that a lay person would then say, that's the reason why he can't talk, because he's got diarrhea.

44:38.174 --> 44:42.317
Whilst in the UK, autism started rising in the late 80s.

44:43.037 --> 44:46.899
Again, just as the MMR vaccine was being introduced.

44:47.139 --> 44:48.500
Right after the Vaccine Act.

44:48.981 --> 44:57.326
The potential implications must have been a tremendous burden for Dr. Wakefield because I guess at the time there was a decision to be made.

44:58.546 --> 45:00.047
Do we just bury it?

45:00.087 --> 45:03.009
Do we pretend it's not existing?

45:03.369 --> 45:07.752
Or do we forge ahead and identify what's really happening?

45:13.234 --> 45:21.040
If MMR really was the cause of an epidemic of autism, this was a public health disaster of huge significance.

45:22.861 --> 45:26.424
It would mean thousands of babies were being damaged by the vaccine.

45:28.598 --> 45:32.303
This became a central claim of the anti-MMR campaign.

45:32.483 --> 45:46.441
Now the problem with this again, remember, is that if you have to reach a certain threshold where you don't have social engagement, where you have almost no language, or you have no real imagination in play,

45:47.526 --> 45:59.150
then lots of kids will be under that threshold and just assumed to be developing slow or having a developmental learning disability or some other thing that doesn't get qualified as autism.

46:00.351 --> 46:14.456
And this is the most dangerous thing of this narrative about the MMR causing autism because the sub-threshold damage potential of intramuscular injection is unquantifiable.

46:18.305 --> 46:29.308
How long it could take to manifest, how it will manifest will be individually determined by the individual circumstances of their particular schedule and exposure.

46:30.683 --> 46:33.905
and of all of the other things that happen in their lives.

46:33.965 --> 46:39.427
Some people have very optimal conditions and have been breastfed for four years.

46:40.327 --> 46:46.370
Other people were bottle fed and their parents weren't as healthy and their environment wasn't as healthy.

46:46.971 --> 46:51.993
And so again, the potential differences in those outcomes cannot be quantified.

46:53.860 --> 47:12.780
And if they all are led to believe that there is a single thing that can be identified as autism spectrum disorder, and that it probably has a single cause, then neurological damage due to poisoning from intramuscular injection will never be

47:14.302 --> 47:27.086
never be treated the way it should be treated, which is more like hitting children with baseball bats over their head and just arguing that if you wait long enough or you spread them out, everything would be fine.

47:31.788 --> 47:43.512
We are facing an autism epidemic, and if it isn't taken seriously now, when it does come home to roost, the cost to the nation is going to be absolutely unbearable.

47:48.712 --> 47:55.795
But the question remained, how could a vaccination designed to protect children be causing autism?

47:57.456 --> 47:57.916
Wakefield.

47:57.976 --> 48:06.699
I just got the update that my stream on YouTube was suspended for policy violations.

48:06.799 --> 48:11.321
I'm hoping that that doesn't mean they're gonna wreck my channel, but anyway, now you know what's up.

48:11.921 --> 48:13.602
I didn't even say, what did I say today?

48:14.162 --> 48:15.423
Believed he had an answer.

48:28.172 --> 48:33.253
Sorry, I just wanted to stop the YouTube stream there just to make sure.

48:33.853 --> 48:36.994
A small amount of virus is injected into the body.

48:40.535 --> 48:45.476
Because the virus has been weakened, the body's immune system easily defeats it.

48:46.252 --> 48:57.920
So the only thing is, in it is a weakened virus, that's it, there's nothing else in there, no preservatives, no inert ingredients, no other things, because that's already wrong, right?

48:58.700 --> 49:02.743
I don't know what it is, but it ain't just measles virus.

49:04.644 --> 49:06.105
Leaving the child protected.

49:09.127 --> 49:15.832
But Wakefield suspected that by giving three different viruses, the immune system was being overwhelmed.

49:17.842 --> 49:33.575
So it could not possibly be the combination of substances being placed in a location for maximum damage.

49:34.716 --> 49:38.419
I don't want you to think that I'm going to start arguing that the adjuvants did it.

49:38.499 --> 49:44.925
What I want you to understand, it is a combination of substances and the viruses are not

49:46.613 --> 49:52.798
They're not biologically inert just because they're weakened or whatever they describe them as.

49:53.119 --> 50:04.949
They are also potentially extremely toxic, immunogenic, and being placed in the worst possible location for your immune system to judge them appropriately.

50:06.704 --> 50:17.294
And so do not for one second allow them to trick you into believing that it is just the adjuvants, even though that is important and an understandable concern.

50:18.755 --> 50:32.207
The protein biologic that is put in the same place as the adjuvant has equal or more potential dangers for the maladaptive augmentation of the immune system.

50:34.517 --> 50:50.272
Mercury is much less likely to make your immune system go haywire than a biologic imperfectly produced and imperfectly used for an intention that it is inappropriate for.

50:53.716 --> 50:59.021
Instead of being defeated, the measles virus from the vaccine remains in the body.

51:02.659 --> 51:09.484
Wakefield's theory was that the measles virus causes a persistent infection of the gut, leading to bowel disease.

51:10.645 --> 51:17.509
This bowel disease stops the gut from digesting food properly, creating toxic chemicals called opioids.

51:19.671 --> 51:28.137
These opioids then enter the bloodstream and make their way to the brain, where they damage the developing brain, causing autism.

51:29.137 --> 51:30.779
Holy crap, I didn't know that.

51:31.738 --> 51:33.399
That's impressive.

51:35.441 --> 51:39.243
They make opioids and wow, I didn't know that.

51:39.804 --> 51:40.444
I didn't know that.

51:42.646 --> 51:45.187
It was a bold and controversial theory.

51:47.709 --> 51:51.532
One thing that's interesting is that where is the measles virus replicating?

51:51.592 --> 51:59.177
The assumption, I guess, is that it replicates in the gut epithelium, a single layer of cells that separates you from the outside world.

52:01.863 --> 52:03.344
Otherwise, where is it replicating, right?

52:03.384 --> 52:05.465
I don't know, where is it replicating then?

52:06.345 --> 52:07.946
It's interesting to think about this.

52:08.526 --> 52:10.627
There's other places that it could replicate in the gut.

52:15.149 --> 52:22.012
Wakefield decided to write a paper outlining his theory and describing William and 11 other cases.

52:23.913 --> 52:30.696
He succeeded in getting it published in one of the world's leading medical journals, The Lancet.

52:33.956 --> 52:38.458
The paper described the new form of bowel disease associated with autism.

52:39.818 --> 52:45.340
Don't forget that Peter Daszak has a paper with him from years earlier and that can't be by chance.

52:45.400 --> 52:45.681
Come on.

52:46.341 --> 52:54.644
On its own, this would have attracted little attention outside the medical community, but the second half of the paper was explosive.

52:57.299 --> 53:05.922
Even though, as Wakefield himself admitted, there was no proof that MMR was the cause of autism, the paper raised that possibility.

53:13.624 --> 53:18.546
As well as having an autistic son, Mike Fitzpatrick is also a GP.

53:19.426 --> 53:22.007
So he soon became aware of Wakefield's research.

53:22.767 --> 53:32.350
When I first heard about the Lancet paper alleging a link between MMR and autism, I was concerned as a GP, because here we were doing baby clinics where we were giving the MMR routinely.

53:35.171 --> 53:37.892
I was even more concerned as a parent of an autistic child.

53:40.213 --> 53:42.334
So I made it my business to check it out very thoroughly.

53:46.186 --> 53:54.108
Well, when I got to read the Lancet paper, I must say I was really shocked because it was such an insubstantial and speculative paper.

53:55.968 --> 54:03.830
According to his critics, not a single stage of the mechanism linking MMR to autism was supported by scientific evidence.

54:04.050 --> 54:14.393
And that's funny because not a single mechanism of ivermectin is proposed either for its curing of COVID, prevention of COVID, or the curing of cancer.

54:15.543 --> 54:16.563
It's just absurd.

54:18.904 --> 54:20.784
But here, of course, it's fine.

54:21.245 --> 54:22.605
There's no explanation.

54:22.645 --> 54:25.586
There's no mechanism given, so it's obviously fake.

54:27.726 --> 54:31.667
There was no evidence that MMR could overload the immune system.

54:33.668 --> 54:37.089
No evidence that the measles virus had infected the gut.

54:39.344 --> 54:47.251
No evidence that this infection had caused bowel disease, and no evidence that the bowel disease was causing autism.

54:48.051 --> 54:52.995
There were four speculative stages in the theory, each of which was highly speculative.

54:55.337 --> 55:00.882
But what really propelled the theory into the headlines was a press conference given to launch the paper.

55:01.662 --> 55:04.925
There, Andrew Wakefield made a controversial suggestion.

55:06.744 --> 55:15.088
There is sufficient anxiety in my own mind over the safety of the MMR vaccination, and I think that it should be suspended in favor of the single vaccines.

55:18.750 --> 55:27.935
Wakefield was suggesting that instead of the combined MMR, children should be given measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately.

55:28.395 --> 55:35.099
Now, in that scenario, my assumption would be that they would get more adjuvants than they would have in the combined shot.

55:37.395 --> 55:53.622
So again, here, what are we really arguing about in the current context of our understanding here, where Brett Weinstein and the Health and Human Services Secretary are both convinced that it's adjuvants, but they haven't really gotten around to looking into them yet, but they will soon.

55:53.642 --> 56:03.167
The result was a media storm.

56:03.911 --> 56:04.451
I'm sure that's fine.

56:31.448 --> 56:35.071
Just like circumcising that baby irrespective of sex.

56:35.311 --> 56:38.353
Cut off the clitoris, cut off the foreskin.

56:38.413 --> 56:40.294
I'm sure that's fine.

56:40.914 --> 56:41.915
They're better off.

56:45.638 --> 56:50.021
And from that day on, MMR vaccination rates started to fall.

56:50.321 --> 56:55.024
This clinic in South London has been inundated with parents demanding... It's getting 500 calls a day.

56:56.414 --> 57:01.299
Parents began demanding the single vaccines, just as Dr Wakefield had recommended.

57:03.741 --> 57:06.744
According to Wakefield, this was the perfect solution.

57:07.665 --> 57:10.747
The protection of the vaccines without the risks of MMR.

57:12.776 --> 57:13.957
but others disagreed.

57:14.137 --> 57:15.258
You understand, right?

57:15.318 --> 57:17.959
That story is very, very specific.

57:18.159 --> 57:25.844
It is the combination that overloads the immune system and causes the overproduction of opioids that causes autism.

57:26.344 --> 57:34.670
It's a very, very specific story to describe why intramuscular injection is dumb in one particular way and context.

57:35.170 --> 57:36.531
One intramuscular injection.

57:37.011 --> 57:38.112
Not all of them, just one.

57:38.572 --> 57:41.754
Three separate ones is better than one, if you do it right.

57:46.775 --> 57:53.959
That suggestion in practice would result in many, many children being unprotected.

57:55.380 --> 57:56.320
It's six injections.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.642
The likelihood that many children would not come back for the six.

58:00.202 --> 58:01.483
That's remarkable, isn't it?

58:01.563 --> 58:03.284
That is freaking remarkable.

58:03.364 --> 58:06.886
It's just every time I am more shocked.

58:07.166 --> 58:09.187
Six injections I think is very high.

58:09.207 --> 58:12.629
It was an irresponsible suggestion.

58:15.865 --> 58:19.447
Perhaps the biggest fear is the impact on rubella vaccination.

58:23.951 --> 58:28.293
Rubella, or German measles, causes only a mild disease in children.

58:29.454 --> 58:36.299
So it's possible that with single vaccines available, many parents wouldn't bother giving their babies the rubella vaccination.

58:38.861 --> 58:42.043
Rubella and measles are pretty close to the same, don't they?

58:43.581 --> 58:51.847
The fear was that Rubella would be passed from unvaccinated children to expectant mothers with devastating consequences.

58:53.269 --> 58:55.951
This is exactly what happened before MMR.

58:57.573 --> 59:03.555
Whenever there was a rubella outbreak amongst children, women got rubella from their own children.

59:04.415 --> 59:11.957
In some cases, it was diagnosed in pregnancy, resulting in a rubella termination, for which, in the bad years, there would be 800 a year.

59:12.897 --> 59:25.440
Those women who didn't get diagnosed in pregnancy would continue with their pregnancy, unaware that they'd been infected, and then give birth to a child with congenital rubella syndrome.

59:28.206 --> 59:35.050
Camilla suffers from congenital rubella syndrome, and as a result, she was born deaf and blind.

59:37.051 --> 59:40.994
With the introduction of MMR, such cases have virtually disappeared.

59:42.215 --> 59:48.298
But the fear was that offering the choice of single vaccines would mean more cases like Camilla.

59:50.686 --> 59:51.327
I mean, I don't know.

59:51.407 --> 59:52.588
I don't have the expertise.

59:52.808 --> 59:54.250
There was no easy way out.

59:55.051 --> 59:58.114
Introducing single vaccines could put children at risk.

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:05.782
But if Wakefield was right, this could be a price worth paying to prevent an epidemic of autism.

01:00:05.882 --> 01:00:12.969
I don't understand why children would be at risk because they don't give the rubella vaccine until if they give the MMR it.

01:00:14.162 --> 01:00:18.684
at one year or 18 months, then I don't understand this completely.

01:00:18.704 --> 01:00:19.245
Maybe I missed something.

01:00:19.265 --> 01:00:24.467
The vital question was, could Wakefield get the evidence to back up his theory?

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:32.871
A key piece of evidence in Wakefield's paper was the timing.

01:00:33.912 --> 01:00:40.675
In all 12 cases that he described, symptoms had appeared within a couple of months of receiving the MMR.

01:00:41.837 --> 01:00:45.280
For Rosemary Keswick, this was clear evidence of a link.

01:00:46.502 --> 01:00:55.490
It was quite clear to us as a family that William was perfectly normal, perfectly all right when he was born and right up until he had the MMR.

01:00:57.292 --> 01:01:01.256
But to scientists, such evidence has to be taken cautiously.

01:01:05.239 --> 01:01:10.468
I think that there's an inevitable tendency to mistake subsequence for consequence.

01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:18.722
That is to assume that because one particular event follows another, that therefore the preceding event caused it.

01:01:21.534 --> 01:01:30.077
The problem is, MMR is usually given between 12 and 18 months, which is also when autism is often first spotted.

01:01:31.178 --> 01:01:35.379
So you will inevitably get the two events occurring together just by chance.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:40.841
That is remarkable, because here's where the genetics comes in.

01:01:40.901 --> 01:01:42.381
Then we don't really know.

01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:45.122
It just could be temporarily a coincidence.

01:01:47.143 --> 01:01:50.084
It's even possible to calculate how often this will happen.

01:01:52.035 --> 01:01:54.737
There are about 700,000 births in the UK every year.

01:01:55.598 --> 01:02:00.801
And about 2 out of every 1,000 will develop signs of autism at some time.

01:02:00.941 --> 01:02:01.822
Shut the door, please.

01:02:02.182 --> 01:02:04.103
So that gives us about 1,400 such children every year.

01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:18.427
If we now ask the question, well, what proportion of those would develop autism during the period of interest, which is one year to 18 months, then the answer is slightly in excess of 50%.

01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:25.514
So we can say of the 1,400, let's say about 800 would develop signs of autism in that particular period.

01:02:26.235 --> 01:02:31.080
If we now ask the question, well, of the 800 children, how many will have received the MMR vaccine?

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.802
About 80%, let's say.

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:34.964
That brings us down to 600 children.

01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:37.766
So 600 children in a six-month period.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:41.630
So we're talking about, in any given month, one-sixth of 600.

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:48.016
100 children would develop signs of autism within one month of having received the MMR.

01:02:48.777 --> 01:02:53.599
But now imagine that you're a parent of a child who has had the MMR vaccine.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.560
You're bound to associate one with the other.

01:02:55.921 --> 01:03:04.245
And yet the statistics suggest that simply by chance, even if there is no causal link, a hundred such cases will appear every year.

01:03:11.028 --> 01:03:15.110
But Wakefield and his supporters claimed it wasn't just a matter of timing.

01:03:16.274 --> 01:03:20.396
They believed that MMR was linked to a very particular kind of autism.

01:03:23.498 --> 01:03:32.764
Our children are autistic in a different way from autism that was originally postulated, was originally talked about.

01:03:33.304 --> 01:03:34.985
Our children are regressive autistics.

01:03:39.668 --> 01:03:43.190
The conventional theory was that autism is present from birth.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.603
But the families who came to see Dr Wakefield seemed to have a different story.

01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:55.948
Their children seemed to be normal until the MMR.

01:03:57.149 --> 01:04:00.552
It's quite difficult to look at the ones when he was really young.

01:04:00.992 --> 01:04:02.393
These sort of photographs

01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:13.216
Before you knew that anything was wrong, he used to like visiting, sitting with his grandma, and he had little friends.

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:21.102
When he was about two and a half, we realized that there was something wrong, but we didn't know how serious it was going to get.

01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:32.271
Like Rosemary Keswick, Sue believes that her son was developing completely normally, and then his development stopped.

01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:33.592
He regressed.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:39.622
This is Lawrence when he was about nine years old.

01:04:41.663 --> 01:04:50.548
He'd gone from a chubby, healthy baby like this to a child thin and ill, cold, weak.

01:04:52.469 --> 01:04:56.711
We got to the stage where we weren't able to take him out for a walk or anything.

01:04:57.912 --> 01:05:00.934
He'd basically turned his face to the wall in the end.

01:05:03.601 --> 01:05:10.566
Many campaigners claimed that the emergence of this regressive form of autism proved that something was damaging the children.

01:05:12.668 --> 01:05:15.470
But is there really a new regressive form of autism?

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:21.755
If anyone would have noticed a change in the condition, it would be Lorna Wing.

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.884
In the 1940s, Lorna Wing trained as an adult psychiatrist,

01:05:33.962 --> 01:05:38.684
But her career changed direction when her own child was diagnosed with autism.

01:05:40.825 --> 01:05:48.529
She became one of the first researchers in the country to study the condition and is now respected by both parents and scientists.

01:05:49.569 --> 01:05:53.651
And over her long career, she has come across many reports of regression.

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:57.850
autism can begin any time up to the age of three.

01:05:58.611 --> 01:06:09.315
So this notion of a child apparently developing normally and then becoming autistic is certainly not new, not new at all.

01:06:12.477 --> 01:06:17.279
This footage from the 1960s shows a happy, normally developing toddler.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.541
This child went on to develop severe autism.

01:06:26.576 --> 01:06:29.597
So regression existed long before MMR.

01:06:30.537 --> 01:06:38.980
And a recent study has shown that it occurs just as often in children who haven't had MMR.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:51.063
In my experience, I haven't seen any increase in the number of people who say that their child became autistic after developing normally.

01:06:55.316 --> 01:07:01.500
So far, there was no conclusive evidence that MMR had caused a single case of autism.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.882
But that didn't stop the decline in public confidence in the vaccine.

01:07:11.005 --> 01:07:20.631
As increasing numbers of parents shunned the MMR vaccine, diseases, which in Britain had almost been consigned to history, have returned.

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:26.248
Cases of measles and mumps have started to rise.

01:07:30.209 --> 01:07:34.471
And these diseases have already claimed their first victims.

01:07:46.155 --> 01:07:49.356
Most people think of measles as a rash and a week off of school.

01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:52.870
It's not quite that simple.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:58.733
It'd be nice if it was just a week off school and a rash, but, you know.

01:07:58.913 --> 01:07:59.313
It's not?

01:07:59.634 --> 01:07:59.874
No.

01:08:00.194 --> 01:08:01.135
More complicated?

01:08:01.575 --> 01:08:02.755
Very complicated, yeah.

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:11.100
When he was two years old, Matthew had a kidney transplant.

01:08:12.441 --> 01:08:19.845
It saved his life, but it left his immune system weakened, putting him at particular risk from childhood diseases.

01:08:22.739 --> 01:08:29.407
And in 2002, Matthew discovered just what measles can do.

01:08:36.317 --> 01:08:40.360
Matthew got up at quarter to five one morning to go to the toilet.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.122
On the way back, he just collapsed in the hallway.

01:08:43.782 --> 01:08:46.904
I went out to see what was the matter and he was just having a fit.

01:08:48.185 --> 01:08:51.347
He was just laying on his side and all his body was shaking.

01:08:51.407 --> 01:08:53.409
He just wasn't responding to anything.

01:08:58.312 --> 01:09:02.315
Matthew was rushed to hospital where his condition deteriorated.

01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:09.523
And it was just getting worse in front of our eyes.

01:09:10.784 --> 01:09:13.006
He'd lost the use of his hands, his legs.

01:09:13.706 --> 01:09:16.048
And then on the Sunday, his eyesight went.

01:09:16.188 --> 01:09:17.690
He just couldn't see anything.

01:09:19.771 --> 01:09:24.495
After two weeks of investigation, doctors discovered what was causing the damage.

01:09:25.076 --> 01:09:25.816
It was measles.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:29.460
Called it measles encephalitis.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:33.743
It just swelled his brain up and affected all the left-hand side of his body.

01:09:36.929 --> 01:09:41.110
Matthew has been left with brain damage from which he may never fully recover.

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:43.811
Matthew can no longer walk.

01:09:43.871 --> 01:09:46.651
He can't use his left leg and his left arm.

01:09:47.111 --> 01:09:48.072
He's just like jelly.

01:09:49.032 --> 01:09:50.292
It's affected his hearing.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:53.293
He's been registered partially sighted.

01:09:53.313 --> 01:09:56.034
His main hobby was reading.

01:09:56.054 --> 01:09:59.234
Obviously now he's lost his sight, he can't read.

01:10:02.635 --> 01:10:05.176
Chapter four, confusion in the marketplace.

01:10:06.365 --> 01:10:15.179
With his weakened immune system, Matthew couldn't have the MMR jab himself, so his health had relied on other children being immunised.

01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:21.231
But the area of London where he lived had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.

01:10:21.912 --> 01:10:30.976
The only protection that the immunosuppressed children have is that the uptake of the MMR jab is kept to a high.

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:40.901
Because once they've caught a disease such as measles, it's sort of, it's just ruined Matthew's life really.

01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:48.805
It isn't only children like Matthew who are at risk.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:54.987
If this continues for a number of years, we will undoubtedly have the return of epidemic measles.

01:10:55.548 --> 01:11:00.610
And with that, there will be children who will die and children who will be brain damaged.

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.530
This isn't a hypothetical risk.

01:11:06.392 --> 01:11:08.593
The authorities were facing a real problem.

01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:14.655
Dangerous diseases were on the rise, while MMR uptake fell further.

01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:21.534
To turn the tide, they needed a conclusive answer to the questions over MMR.

01:11:22.655 --> 01:11:25.938
So they turned to a method they hoped would provide that answer.

01:11:27.159 --> 01:11:28.039
Epidemiology.

01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:33.483
Epidemiology is the study of the health of populations.

01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:38.087
Huge populations.

01:11:41.847 --> 01:11:50.174
and really requires measuring events that happen to lots of people in order to try and work out what are the causes of ill health.

01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:59.521
Dr Wakefield had claimed that the rise in autism had started at about the time MMR was introduced.

01:12:00.642 --> 01:12:05.385
So epidemiologists looked more closely to see if the data really matched up.

01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:09.869
The story turned out to be much more complicated.

01:12:12.168 --> 01:12:15.049
The rise occurred before MMR was introduced.

01:12:15.569 --> 01:12:18.050
It continued after MMR was introduced.

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:25.692
Even though the uptake rate of MMR was constant, the rates at which autism was being diagnosed were increasing.

01:12:29.394 --> 01:12:33.995
And in Japan, the MMR vaccine was withdrawn in 1993.

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:39.297
But a recent study has shown that autism rates there have still risen.

01:12:45.703 --> 01:12:53.389
So the evidence suggests that NMR wasn't responsible for the epidemic, but that still didn't prove that it was safe.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:13:04.679
To really find out whether NMR increases the risk of autism, scientists needed a way of comparing children who did have the vaccine with children who didn't.

01:13:05.579 --> 01:13:08.742
And in one country, just such a study was possible.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:21.888
In Denmark, every child is given a unique social security number on the day they are born.

01:13:23.249 --> 01:13:28.772
This number... Are they about to make an argument for the healthcare data system?

01:13:28.852 --> 01:13:29.192
Wow.

01:13:29.713 --> 01:13:32.694
...is used to record every medical event in their history.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:38.838
So researchers pulled out the data for every child in Denmark born between 1991 and 1998.

01:13:38.878 --> 01:13:40.259
More than half a million children.

01:13:48.945 --> 01:13:56.012
Although the majority of Danish children do receive the vaccine, there were almost 100,000 children who hadn't.

01:13:57.253 --> 01:14:01.357
So scientists could compare the rate of autism in those two groups.

01:14:05.962 --> 01:14:11.407
And they found that the rate was the same, whether they'd had MMR or not.

01:14:12.776 --> 01:14:13.456
There was no difference.

01:14:13.476 --> 01:14:17.237
In fact, there was a slightly higher risk in the unvaccinated group.

01:14:17.277 --> 01:14:23.859
It wasn't statistically significant, but there was absolutely no evidence of an increased risk in those that had been vaccinated.

01:14:27.741 --> 01:14:32.342
Opponents of MMR have claimed that there might be flaws in the Danish analysis.

01:14:33.814 --> 01:14:39.738
But there have been more than a dozen epidemiological studies using different methods in different countries.

01:14:40.659 --> 01:14:44.922
And overwhelmingly, they have found no link between MMR and autism.

01:14:46.703 --> 01:14:51.886
To the scientific world, the statistics confirmed that MMR is safe.

01:14:53.167 --> 01:14:59.692
It's absolutely clear that if there has been a large rise in autism, it's got absolutely nothing to do with the vaccine.

01:15:01.525 --> 01:15:12.996
It's been given in 80 countries for 30 years, in millions of doses, and if it did cause a significant adverse reaction, it would have been picked up somewhere by now.

01:15:13.296 --> 01:15:16.339
You know, I'm at a loss to what more can be done.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:22.565
There is no epidemiological evidence to suggest that there is a link between the two.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:25.488
As far as anything you can ever say is safe, MMR is safe.

01:15:27.062 --> 01:15:34.248
The epidemiology had shown that the huge rise in autism had not been caused by MMR.

01:15:39.812 --> 01:15:43.935
But if MMR wasn't responsible for the rise, then what was?

01:15:46.697 --> 01:15:51.961
Many experts believe that the increase in numbers may be largely down to better diagnosis.

01:15:52.878 --> 01:15:57.863
that there have always been a similar number of autistic people, but they never got diagnosed.

01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:08.259
Now I can think back to when I was working in an old-fashioned mental hospital as a psychiatrist for adults.

01:16:09.859 --> 01:16:24.243
It's absolutely clear to me that a number of the people I knew then who were chronically ill and had lived a long time in the hospital were certainly autistic people grown up.

01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:31.853
that's pretty amazing, wow

01:16:38.544 --> 01:16:39.264
That's amazing.

01:16:39.444 --> 01:16:44.587
She was just... The only evidence which I've seen cited is epidemiological.

01:16:45.428 --> 01:16:47.109
Now, to me, that's statistics.

01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:49.950
Now, statistics either turn you on or they don't.

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:54.793
I don't... I don't have time for statistics when I see a sick child in front of me.

01:16:55.313 --> 01:16:59.235
Super easy to use placebo to make those statistics work.

01:16:59.255 --> 01:17:04.038
Although the epidemiology showed that MMR couldn't be a risk for the vast majority of children,

01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:12.674
Wakefield and his supporters now believed that there might be a small group of children that had been damaged by MMR.

01:17:15.436 --> 01:17:20.498
If this so-called subset was small enough, it wouldn't be detectable by epidemiology.

01:17:21.338 --> 01:17:23.979
And Wakefield claimed this wasn't just a theory.

01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.241
He had scientific evidence to back it up.

01:17:30.865 --> 01:17:34.966
The clue lay in the new form of bowel disease that Wakefield had discovered.

01:17:36.606 --> 01:17:38.287
It seems not too bad at the moment.

01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:44.588
Sue McGowan believes that her son is suffering from this bowel disease.

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:50.149
It's just here, and it will just swell like this, here.

01:17:50.169 --> 01:17:53.070
And then, you know, he likes you to rub it like this.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:04.387
At one point, Lawrence virtually stopped eating, and his weight dropped to two stone eight, the typical weight of a child half his age.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:17.097
I think it's a gut problem, and that, I think, is affecting his mental condition, because something sends him berserk every so often, and it always happens just after he's eaten.

01:18:24.895 --> 01:18:26.118
Oh boy.

01:18:43.534 --> 01:18:55.322
One terrifying additional aspect of this which could be awful for the complicated understanding of these kinds of damaged kids is what is given to them

01:18:57.884 --> 01:19:15.693
to investigate their bowel and to fix their digestive problems can be something like Miralax, which can be devastating to the microbiome and may make whatever process is there much, much worse.

01:19:16.254 --> 01:19:17.234
Just another side.

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:20.656
Leads to a worsening of his autistic behavior.

01:19:22.648 --> 01:19:26.471
Because of the nature of his problems, we don't know what kind of pain he's in.

01:19:27.511 --> 01:19:33.395
Anybody who's had a stomachache or diarrhoea, imagine having that all the time.

01:19:33.415 --> 01:19:43.862
For Wakefield, the bowel disease that children like Lawrence are suffering from is a key symptom of this vulnerable subset.

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:45.243
Rub it, rub it, rub it.

01:19:46.072 --> 01:19:50.853
But in fact, bowel problems are common in children with neurological conditions.

01:19:51.813 --> 01:19:57.014
So most gastroenterologists have tended to see such symptoms as unsurprising.

01:20:04.396 --> 01:20:12.178
Neurologically abnormal children, about 50% of them have constipation, some diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain.

01:20:13.197 --> 01:20:21.264
I 100% agree with John from San Francisco that it has something to do with the innervation of the gut.

01:20:21.664 --> 01:20:28.890
And the new Biology 101 is gonna take this into account in a way that you've probably never imagined.

01:20:29.471 --> 01:20:31.733
And I'm so excited to share it with you next week.

01:20:32.273 --> 01:20:34.515
I get chills thinking about it right now.

01:20:34.575 --> 01:20:35.376
I'm really excited.

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:36.196
Pain.

01:20:37.237 --> 01:20:40.320
So to me, that's not a surprise.

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:50.492
If anything, Professor Sandy believes it's not the bowel disease that is causing autism, it's the autism that's causing the bowel problems.

01:20:51.893 --> 01:20:56.737
The reason is that the brain and the digestive system are very closely linked.

01:20:59.472 --> 01:21:02.593
After the brain, the gut has the largest number of nerves in it.

01:21:03.494 --> 01:21:05.795
So it's very influenced by feelings in the brain.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:15.099
As we know, you're going for an interview and you're running to the loo, so the gut-brain axis works, but it's mostly that way around, not the other way around.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:21.491
But Wakefield claims that sceptics like Professor Sandhu are missing the point.

01:21:22.351 --> 01:21:26.893
He says that children such as William and Lawrence don't just have bowel problems.

01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:32.956
They have a specific new form of bowel disease that is particularly associated with autism.

01:21:36.838 --> 01:21:41.840
Using a colonoscope, this is visible as a distinctive pattern of damage in the gut.

01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:46.102
The man who performed the original investigations

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:48.358
was Simon Murch.

01:21:49.719 --> 01:21:54.080
The first two or three children had really very striking changes.

01:21:55.621 --> 01:22:00.322
One had ulceration in the bottom of the small bowel, what's called the terminal ileum.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:06.004
And that was of sufficient severity that we actually thought this was Crohn's disease.

01:22:06.504 --> 01:22:16.788
We've now scoped over 200 children, in other words, performed this invasive procedure on 200 children to investigate the intestinal tract and find that there is a remarkably consistent disease.

01:22:19.048 --> 01:22:29.490
Although Wakefield's claims are supported by a small number of scientists, the majority of gastroenterologists are still sceptical about the existence of the new condition.

01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:39.653
Certainly I've talked to the majority of my colleagues around the UK, in UK and North America, and they pretty well agree with us.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:46.234
I mean, where perhaps we haven't been very good is actually saying this to the public, that this is a whole lot of nonsense.

01:22:49.895 --> 01:22:57.902
But Wakefield responded that he had a second key piece of evidence that showed that a subset of children could have been damaged by MMR.

01:23:00.284 --> 01:23:03.787
He claimed to have found the measles virus in their bodies.

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:14.685
Wakefield's theory was that the measles virus in the vaccine was causing a persistent infection.

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:20.129
So it should be possible to find traces of the virus in the child's body.

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:25.872
His own laboratory had searched for the virus, but without success.

01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:32.536
But then he met someone who was to take his research to a new stage.

01:23:35.871 --> 01:23:43.052
John O'Leary is an expert at detecting viruses, even when there's only a small amount of the virus to find.

01:23:44.033 --> 01:23:46.553
Only a tiny amount available.

01:23:46.593 --> 01:23:47.513
What will they use?

01:23:48.293 --> 01:23:58.536
He uses a technique called PCR, which can make copies of the genetic code inside a virus, turning a single copy into billions.

01:23:59.536 --> 01:24:00.176
Interesting.

01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:07.315
So, with PCR, you can detect even a single virus particle.

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:09.396
Wow, even a single virus particle.

01:24:09.436 --> 01:24:10.297
That's impressive.

01:24:13.659 --> 01:24:19.723
Wakefield sent O'Leary small samples of bowel tissue that he'd taken during the examination of the children.

01:24:21.324 --> 01:24:24.686
O'Leary tested these samples for the presence of the measles virus.

01:24:25.851 --> 01:24:31.435
Using proprietary primers for a number of different proteins, I'm sure.

01:24:31.535 --> 01:24:35.899
What he found would reignite the MMR controversy once more.

01:24:36.879 --> 01:24:41.543
We've identified a persistent measles virus infection in the guts of these children.

01:24:43.581 --> 01:24:47.303
which is statistically significant as compared to normal controls.

01:24:47.864 --> 01:24:50.245
Statistically significant.

01:24:50.325 --> 01:25:01.752
So they are going on statistics that the signal is present in the controls, but it is p-value significantly different in the infected kids.

01:25:02.573 --> 01:25:03.733
Holy shit.

01:25:03.753 --> 01:25:05.274
That is much more likely.

01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:06.215
That's a lab leak.

01:25:09.457 --> 01:25:10.798
Wow, that's amazeballs.

01:25:13.115 --> 01:25:20.617
O'Leary claimed to have found the measles virus in 82% of the samples from the autistic children examined by Dr. Wakefield.

01:25:22.358 --> 01:25:27.819
Then he went further and claimed to have found the virus in the blood of autistic children.

01:25:27.839 --> 01:25:37.522
What O'Leary had found was fragments of the measles virus in both the blood and gut samples.

01:25:38.862 --> 01:25:42.383
Now, there was no reason why the measles virus should be there.

01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:46.571
And where did it come from in vaccinated children?

01:25:47.311 --> 01:25:48.771
It had to have come from the vaccination.

01:25:53.213 --> 01:26:01.275
It tells us that in children whose only recorded exposure to the virus has been as the vaccine, the vaccine or the virus is still there in their intestine.

01:26:01.675 --> 01:26:06.517
The problem is that our expert, James Lyon Weiner, is sure that

01:26:13.519 --> 01:26:20.287
The target of vaccinations are being transmitted asymptomatically all the time.

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:24.092
Asymptomatic carriers are created by the vaccine schedule.

01:26:25.512 --> 01:26:41.248
And so the idea that these people are only exposed to the virus via the vaccine stands in contradiction to what people like James Lyons Weiler and others teach us about the vaccination schedule and what it accomplishes and what it doesn't.

01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:43.290
Also kind of unfortunate.

01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:50.626
often many years later.

01:26:52.887 --> 01:26:57.590
O'Leary's research propelled the MMR controversy into the news once more.

01:27:00.412 --> 01:27:03.334
Headlines presented it as proof of a link.

01:27:07.076 --> 01:27:11.859
But again, many scientists were not convinced by O'Leary's work.

01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:27.972
We had been waiting for really some time to see when this material was going to come out in a peer-reviewed journal and so on, and it was a big disappointment, frankly, from a virological point of view, almost impossible to assess.

01:27:30.074 --> 01:27:33.679
The problem is that PCR can sometimes be too good.

01:27:34.847 --> 01:27:44.495
It's incredible power to copy a single piece of genetic material means that the tiniest bit of contamination can make the results worthless.

01:27:45.136 --> 01:27:52.663
According to his critics, O'Leary's paper didn't have enough detail to show whether his methods were reliable or not.

01:27:54.324 --> 01:28:05.530
Because it's so sensitive, anything that's a contaminant that creeps in from, in this case, a measles sequence, either in the lab or in the sample that you're looking at, or floating in the air or whatever, can actually give you a very misleading result.

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:06.730
Interesting.

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:09.832
I wonder if they had that same problem during COVID.

01:28:09.852 --> 01:28:18.536
I mean... I didn't expect this to be here, but I'm very happy it is.

01:28:20.778 --> 01:28:23.299
And so, the two sides were deadlocked.

01:28:24.997 --> 01:28:35.765
The anti-MMR campaign believed that they had strong clinical evidence, the new bowel disease and the presence of the measles virus to back up their claims.

01:28:37.266 --> 01:28:42.569
But the medical establishment dismissed their case, preferring to rely on epidemiology.

01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:51.396
And for years, little independent clinical research into these claims was funded to the anger of many parents.

01:28:52.825 --> 01:28:56.167
It needs clinical, scientific research.

01:28:56.267 --> 01:28:57.648
Forget the epidemiology.

01:28:58.249 --> 01:29:03.252
Look at the children, look at the samples, look at the samples down a microscope.

01:29:04.232 --> 01:29:05.193
Keep the science.

01:29:08.695 --> 01:29:15.519
The lack of such research has fuelled suspicion that the government simply wasn't taking people's concerns seriously.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.342
But now at last, the deadlock is being broken.

01:29:20.876 --> 01:29:24.118
New clinical research is going on to answer the questions.

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:29.322
Is there a subset of autistic children with a new form of bowel disease?

01:29:30.202 --> 01:29:34.445
And can the measles virus be found in the blood of autistic children?

01:29:38.908 --> 01:29:39.788
Mass General.

01:29:41.029 --> 01:29:41.469
What?

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:44.431
I'm going to quit.

01:29:44.451 --> 01:29:45.352
That's what you want to do.

01:29:46.491 --> 01:29:50.593
Timothy Bui is a pediatric gastroenterologist in Boston.

01:29:52.833 --> 01:30:00.256
What makes him unique is that he works in a clinic that specializes in the care of children with autism and related disorders.

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:08.900
Like Dr. Wakefield, he has found that many of these children do have real bowel problems that are worthy of investigation.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.002
And in some cases, the parents blame their child's problems on MMR.

01:30:15.916 --> 01:30:19.599
Well, she got the MMR shot about 18 months old, about 20 months, 22 months.

01:30:19.759 --> 01:30:22.542
It was just, everything started dropping away.

01:30:22.562 --> 01:30:24.423
It was just like one day all of a sudden a wall went down.

01:30:24.463 --> 01:30:27.886
So she stopped responding, she stopped talking, she stopped looking at us.

01:30:27.906 --> 01:30:30.168
It was scary.

01:30:30.188 --> 01:30:31.409
It was like I lost my child.

01:30:32.366 --> 01:30:40.810
Parents are not being reassured by an answer that we think this is okay, we know this is okay, epidemiologically this looks okay.

01:30:41.711 --> 01:30:44.352
Parents are not confident with that answer yet.

01:30:44.792 --> 01:30:51.116
We need to do the work to look for the answers and try to confirm or refute the finding.

01:30:56.630 --> 01:31:05.252
The question is, do these children have a unique pattern of damage caused by a new form of bowel disease, as claimed by Andrew Wakefield?

01:31:06.793 --> 01:31:09.013
Answering that requires colonoscopy.

01:31:12.114 --> 01:31:19.996
So this is a colonoscope, and it has camera technology that really allows us to look down with light into the gut.

01:31:28.223 --> 01:31:33.127
And literally, winding through the colon is like driving a Grand Prix.

01:31:33.527 --> 01:31:36.549
We try to be very careful to come around corners.

01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:40.853
Wheels on the top of the scope here let me turn.

01:31:40.873 --> 01:31:44.135
I can use my body to turn and reposition the scope.

01:31:47.177 --> 01:31:51.000
I think people who are very good endoscopists are quite artistic.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.922
They look like they're doing Tai Chi at times.

01:31:56.164 --> 01:31:56.985
What did he eat?

01:31:57.737 --> 01:31:58.677
Holy moly.

01:31:59.718 --> 01:32:01.738
We're going to get a culture of seeds here.

01:32:01.778 --> 01:32:03.238
I do not know what he ate.

01:32:04.179 --> 01:32:04.839
Look at that.

01:32:06.359 --> 01:32:13.041
One of the biggest challenges, I think, sometimes to get into the end part of the small intestine, because it's a very sharp turn.

01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:18.142
That's a long drive.

01:32:19.022 --> 01:32:19.482
Dang it.

01:32:19.502 --> 01:32:22.423
Finally, Dr. Bui maneuvers into the small intestine.

01:32:23.623 --> 01:32:26.344
Here, he finds prominent nodules of lymph tissue

01:32:28.248 --> 01:32:33.651
Enlarged lymph nodules in the gut are one of the features associated with the new disease.

01:32:34.831 --> 01:32:38.353
And you can actually see them beautifully illustrated in this child.

01:32:38.773 --> 01:32:43.695
He's got an area on the small bowel that is on one side of the bowel.

01:32:43.735 --> 01:32:44.656
It's very smooth.

01:32:45.216 --> 01:32:48.918
And on the other side of the bowel, it's very lumpy and bumpy and nodular.

01:32:50.199 --> 01:32:52.219
But this child isn't autistic.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.161
He's developmentally completely normal.

01:32:55.968 --> 01:32:59.631
Most pediatric gastroenterologists would say that they see this very frequently.

01:32:59.671 --> 01:33:04.214
They see it in most children, especially children in this age, under age seven or eight.

01:33:05.836 --> 01:33:07.417
His research is still ongoing.

01:33:08.718 --> 01:33:23.549
But despite having performed colonoscopies on hundreds of children, both with and without autism, Dr. Bui has so far seen nothing that convinces him that autistic children have a new or distinctive form of bowel disease.

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:26.870
So I'm going to advance here.

01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:27.910
It's almost two o'clock.

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:30.171
This is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:30.191 --> 01:33:33.271
There's a lot of history we still have to study and catalog.

01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:36.512
I think the BBC Horizons show is one of those things.

01:33:36.552 --> 01:33:39.233
I dropped it in the link earlier, or in the chat earlier.

01:33:39.273 --> 01:33:42.474
You can find all of these episodes, watch them at your leisure.

01:33:43.254 --> 01:33:47.878
Ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of this is the idea that intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:33:47.919 --> 01:34:00.650
There's no medicine that they can justify injecting into your muscle with a good biological explanation, just like there is no good biological explanation that's natural for what happened in 2020 to 2022.

01:34:03.183 --> 01:34:10.931
The only thing that they can do is use synthetic recombinant genetics to make DNA and RNA, and they can use that trick to do lots of things.

01:34:11.331 --> 01:34:22.584
And that includes making a very large, absolutely unnatural quantity of a pure DNA, which is the ultimate PCR positive.

01:34:23.789 --> 01:34:26.851
And so PCR has a diagnostic, is a fraud.

01:34:26.891 --> 01:34:40.060
And in fact, you heard in this video that for the results of Andrew Wakefield's own papers, they specifically used the, you know, contamination could be the result here.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:44.441
as justification for discarding his findings.

01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:59.847
Now what you need to see is that very same hypersensitivity, that super ability of PCR to do what they claim it can do, is no different than what it could have done in 2020 on a very hot background.

01:34:59.967 --> 01:35:00.207
Again,

01:35:01.132 --> 01:35:08.697
I will point out that this hot background was there during the making of this and during all of the MMR studies that Andrew Wakefield did.

01:35:09.257 --> 01:35:15.822
And that background was ignored, a background that has insufficiently been described to you up until this stage.

01:35:16.562 --> 01:35:24.167
But next week, we will start with this as the foundation of our understanding of what is going on with our own biology.

01:35:24.327 --> 01:35:29.551
Our new Biology 101 is going to be founded in this understanding of what that background is.

01:35:30.546 --> 01:35:43.537
And of course, the dismissal of the pandemic can be really edified almost exclusively by this one idea that if they had an agent in Wuhan and they can make a pure synthetic quantity, then she could have certainly found it.

01:35:44.980 --> 01:36:03.157
Transfection is a crime, ladies and gentlemen, and Brian Hooker could have told college kids that in 2020, just like he could have told you that Brandy Vaughn was the closest to getting it correct before the pandemic that intramuscular injection is a pretty questionable methodology for the application of medicine.

01:36:03.797 --> 01:36:05.518
The way they got away with it is placebo.

01:36:05.558 --> 01:36:10.621
It's probably also the way that they get away with the childhood vaccine schedule as we know it.

01:36:11.242 --> 01:36:13.663
Ladies and gentlemen, endemic is a myth.

01:36:13.843 --> 01:36:15.404
Endemicity is a myth.

01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:19.046
And racism is not endemic to the American culture.

01:36:19.587 --> 01:36:22.909
You can dismiss this with one statement, RNA cannot pandemic.

01:36:22.989 --> 01:36:28.372
All you need is a hot background and non-specific PCR test, just like described in that 2005 BBC video.

01:36:30.313 --> 01:36:31.595
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:36:31.775 --> 01:36:34.298
RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:36:34.338 --> 01:36:40.204
Transfecting healthy people is a crime and the population pyramids is a problem in need of solving.

01:36:40.304 --> 01:36:41.426
Thanks very much for being here.

01:36:41.446 --> 01:36:49.775
I will see you guys again probably tomorrow for another study hall as I try to get warmed up and get ready to start teaching next week.

01:36:49.795 --> 01:36:50.516
Thanks for being here.

01:36:50.556 --> 01:36:50.917
See you soon.

01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:03.487
Congratulations, Jay Bhattacharya, the new director of the NIH.

01:37:04.268 --> 01:37:09.349
That's the reason why I have the green light to go on the new Biology 101.

01:37:10.029 --> 01:37:11.790
It's going to hit hard, ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:17.272
By the end of next week, there are going to be some tears being shed, I assure you.

01:37:17.872 --> 01:37:19.232
I've got a great gift for you.

01:37:19.272 --> 01:37:19.913
I can't wait.

01:37:20.233 --> 01:37:21.053
I cannot wait.
