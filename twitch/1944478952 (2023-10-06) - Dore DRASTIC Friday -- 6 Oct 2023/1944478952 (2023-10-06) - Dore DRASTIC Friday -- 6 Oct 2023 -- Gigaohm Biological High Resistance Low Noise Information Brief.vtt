03:16.680 --> 03:22.120
I was telling him to say it, he should have put Bobby on when he was on his when it was

03:22.120 --> 03:30.080
at his house in November of 2021, not in 2023, 14 months later, he should have had the courage

03:30.080 --> 03:33.360
to speak out when he knew what he didn't.

03:33.360 --> 03:46.160
That's the point we're noticing, numerous times over the past month is means nothing

03:46.160 --> 03:49.480
now means nothing.

03:49.480 --> 04:13.360
He knew in 2020, he knew in 2021 for sure.

04:13.360 --> 04:37.520
Mike Vandenberg, next date, Mike Vandenberg, next date.

04:37.520 --> 05:04.600
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, this is King of Home Biological, High Resistance Low

05:04.600 --> 05:10.320
Noise Information Brief brought to you by a biologist, it's the 6th of October, 2023.

05:10.320 --> 05:21.160
We are still battling this very limited spectrum of bait, which was basically sculpted by and

05:21.160 --> 05:25.680
crafted by people like Brett Weinstein, who at the beginning of the pandemic made it seem

05:25.680 --> 05:28.960
very possible that the worst case scenario could happen.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.780
He made it very possible to believe that Vandenas could save you, he made it very possible

05:33.780 --> 05:39.900
to believe that locking down and staying away from your grandparents was a great idea.

05:39.900 --> 05:45.760
Brett Weinstein perpetuated the narrative for at least the first two years of the pandemic

05:45.760 --> 05:55.500
which created a perception of this sort of consensus that yeah, it's dangerous.

05:55.500 --> 06:03.620
Yeah, there's a virus, you've got to do something and in doing so, he misled the young.

06:03.620 --> 06:11.260
In doing so, they've all misled the young and that's why we should be pissed.

06:11.260 --> 06:19.900
Because this necessity as a plea, this necessity as an excuse for every infringement of human

06:19.900 --> 06:25.540
freedom, it's the argument of tyrants and it's the creed of slaves, you need to learn

06:25.540 --> 06:37.140
your history before they erase it forever.

06:37.140 --> 06:43.140
I really believe that the Rick Wall at the back of the theater is visible and they are

06:43.140 --> 06:50.100
clearing the tables and chairs because that has become no longer profitable to maintain

06:50.100 --> 06:56.420
this illusion of freedom and so you can see it, I can see it, how are we going and what

06:56.420 --> 07:01.660
are we going to do about the fact that there was no spread in New York City, about the

07:01.660 --> 07:06.420
fact that they keep lying about infectious clones, about the fact that they keep lying

07:06.420 --> 07:13.660
about placebo batches and giving the Nobel Prize for transfection.

07:13.660 --> 07:31.660
Let's get going biological, very happy to be here tonight, thank you for joining me.

07:31.660 --> 07:41.300
Good evening, my name is Jonathan Cooley, I am the biologist that brings you this show

07:41.300 --> 07:48.340
as often as possible almost nightly now for quite some time, we are trying to fight this

07:48.340 --> 07:55.420
idea that the illusion of consensus that is created by TV and social media is now starting

07:55.420 --> 08:01.460
to bait us to hate each other, it's starting to bait us to behave ever more ridiculously

08:01.460 --> 08:06.260
and we need to wake up and apologize to our kids for not seeing through this much earlier

08:06.260 --> 08:12.300
and for falling for this mystery that we all have to solve and I hope that you and your

08:12.300 --> 08:17.140
friends are starting to realize that that's really the trick that they pulled on us and

08:17.140 --> 08:23.540
it's a way of governing us, this is the strategy by which the American government and Western

08:23.540 --> 08:31.780
governments have decided to govern their societies is with a complex web of coordinated lies

08:31.780 --> 08:35.940
and it could very well be that they have completely exaggerated the biological significance

08:35.940 --> 08:43.700
of this event with the express written consent of permanently changing what our kids perceive

08:43.700 --> 08:52.580
to be true and once they've changed what our kids perceive to be true, we're done and that's

08:52.580 --> 08:57.100
something you really need to understand is the reason why I'm mad at Brett Weinstein and Sam

08:57.100 --> 09:02.220
Harris and all these other people who have taken part in laying down the worst case scenario

09:02.220 --> 09:07.820
narrative at the beginning of the pandemic, the conformist narrative at the beginning of the pandemic,

09:07.820 --> 09:14.620
the Jordan Peterson, we should just shut up and take the shot, let's wait six months and see what

09:14.620 --> 09:20.860
happens kind of thing, let's let the Jews get on the train and then we'll check on them in a few

09:20.860 --> 09:28.940
months and see if they're okay. Now you might be a little offended by that last statement but

09:28.940 --> 09:36.060
one of my good friends is someone who has the authority to speak that way and she assures me

09:36.780 --> 09:43.980
that that analogy is apt here. You can't wear the uniform for 20 years and then take it off now

09:43.980 --> 09:53.500
and claim everything is good and you can't have said all of the things that these people said

09:53.500 --> 09:58.380
that the dark web said at the beginning of the pandemic and in the year up to the pandemic

09:59.980 --> 10:05.580
and then just say now you're a good guy. There's no way that you woke up this late

10:05.580 --> 10:11.340
on accident. There's no way you were this on narrative in the first year on accident.

10:13.740 --> 10:21.100
No, there's only one way to explain that and that's really where the heart of this

10:21.980 --> 10:26.940
is right now. We're trying to sort out moving the people on this map that are interesting

10:28.460 --> 10:33.900
because right now the faith is very simple. Well the faith is that there's a novel virus we had to

10:33.900 --> 10:40.620
do something the mRNA saved between 13 and 16 million lives and there's most certainly a virus

10:40.620 --> 10:45.340
coming again because gain of function hasn't been did we haven't done anything about it and because

10:45.340 --> 10:51.580
of the acceleration of our molecular biological techniques it sooner or later is going to be easy

10:51.580 --> 10:58.380
enough to order a kid online and make a coronavirus pandemic in your kitchen. Maybe it'll even be a

10:58.460 --> 11:03.020
high school science project de attenuated pandemic virus poster.

11:08.780 --> 11:13.820
And the way to sort through these people that are parading around as leaders is to scrutinize

11:13.820 --> 11:20.940
their take on the vaccination schedule in America scrutinize their take on the

11:21.740 --> 11:29.260
the CICP on the VICP on the PrEP Act on the difference between the vaccine schedule in

11:29.260 --> 11:37.660
America and in other countries and on the FDA and the CDC because if they're at all

11:37.660 --> 11:43.020
mealy mouth or at all apologetic then you know right away you can see right through them if

11:43.020 --> 11:48.620
they're have the courage to say the transfection is an immunization you might have a real ally

11:48.620 --> 11:54.780
on your hands and if they have the courage to actually admit that it's very possible that all

11:54.780 --> 11:59.980
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the

11:59.980 --> 12:06.620
immune system is just plain ridiculous then you really might have an ally on your hands.

12:07.900 --> 12:14.940
Now don't get me wrong I'm very well aware that our friend Robert F Kennedy Jr. has never or at

12:15.020 --> 12:21.900
least seems to avoid saying on screen that he thinks that the vaccine schedule in America is bad

12:21.900 --> 12:29.180
and that people shouldn't take vaccines he's very careful to say he wants the schedule tested

12:29.180 --> 12:33.980
he's pro vaccine and that he just wants safe vaccines.

12:35.980 --> 12:42.860
Now if you see him as a lawyer and you see him as a politician and you see him as something other

12:42.940 --> 12:50.140
than a biologist and perhaps it's easy to understand but I have every intention of influencing him

12:51.100 --> 12:56.540
to if at all possible through direct and indirect influences I guess it can only be

12:56.540 --> 13:03.500
indirect at this point because I work for who I work for but I want him to be here I want him to

13:03.500 --> 13:10.700
be where Peter McCullough is and I want him to openly say it before he gets elected not after

13:11.660 --> 13:17.180
but maybe that's not in the cards maybe the only way to the White House is to appease those

13:18.060 --> 13:27.100
sleepers out there who will not have the time or the courage to to figure this out even if

13:27.100 --> 13:32.620
we throw them a lifeline they're not going to grab on tight enough and Bobby may have the right

13:32.620 --> 13:36.860
play here but I want you to understand that Peter McCullough has flipped that around already

13:36.940 --> 13:40.620
and of course we've been paying a lot of attention to Robert Malone and the people that he points

13:40.620 --> 13:47.020
to and the people that he ignores and more importantly we've gone back to early emergent

13:47.020 --> 13:55.260
Robert Malone in 2021 and seen some very curious patterns with regard to who he performs with

13:56.780 --> 14:04.460
and it wasn't the local news in Virginia it wasn't the let's say typical podcaster

14:07.500 --> 14:14.220
we've also had a recent visit by Denny and Peter on the show and although I botched the time it was

14:14.220 --> 14:21.260
a really good interview if you missed it check it out please I did a stream this past couple days

14:21.260 --> 14:27.660
about Philip Buckholtz who's a guy who I believe he testified in front of the South Carolina Senate

14:28.460 --> 14:33.340
about the contents of the mRNA shots and the fact that they had this plasmid contamination

14:34.300 --> 14:39.100
and he spoke very authoritatively and I have no doubt that he found the DNA that he did

14:39.820 --> 14:48.300
he's also intimately involved with testing for coronavirus using PCR early in the pandemic

14:49.340 --> 14:56.700
and is a well in that in that chat or talk he is a self-proclaimed expert but he is an expert

14:56.700 --> 15:01.100
I mean you can see that he's got he's got chops obviously he's much more of an expert than I am

15:03.420 --> 15:09.580
but rather than having any discussion at all he made a pretty weak statement about PCR

15:09.580 --> 15:15.980
which was simply that you know incompetent hands PCR is very accurate and so this is the kind of

15:16.780 --> 15:22.060
shell game that they keep playing and so he blocks me instead of explaining what he meant by that or

15:22.060 --> 15:26.860
addressing the fact that they didn't use nested primers or they addressed the fact that

15:27.660 --> 15:32.060
that their primers that they did choose wouldn't be specific for one coronavirus we're not going

15:32.060 --> 15:37.820
to talk anything about that we're just going to tell the whole world that everybody who doubts

15:37.820 --> 15:43.260
PCR is completely wrong because in competent hands PCR is highly specific

15:46.220 --> 15:50.620
cars don't hurt people because in competent hands cars are amazing

15:52.220 --> 15:56.940
kitchen knives don't hurt people because in competent hands they make great food

15:57.660 --> 16:05.420
I mean even even deer hunting rifles don't hurt people in competent hands they they set the table

16:05.420 --> 16:14.700
so it's a very disingenuous argument but it was used on Twitter as kind of a dunk and then also

16:14.700 --> 16:21.660
when I called him out on that he blocked me no discussion no rebuttal just block very similar

16:22.060 --> 16:28.700
just block very similar to Kevin McCurnan very similar to George Webb very similar to

16:28.700 --> 16:33.180
Robin Martinotti all the people who for whatever reason

16:36.700 --> 16:42.300
aren't interested in finding out how not certain they should be but instead just want to wield this

16:42.300 --> 16:50.380
false certainty as a clungent and it's unfortunate because this is how this illusion of consensus

16:50.380 --> 16:56.940
is created it's created by people who came out very early and were very certain about certain

16:56.940 --> 17:05.180
things think about how odd it is that some random Russian living in Canada was one of the first

17:05.180 --> 17:14.140
people to publish a blog on medium a relatively new web platform about the fear and cleavage site

17:14.940 --> 17:20.860
and so while medium was a pretty struggling platform before the pandemic it's become quite

17:20.860 --> 17:27.020
a strong little thing and more importantly Yuri Dagan made his debut about the fear and cleavage

17:27.020 --> 17:33.580
site very early in 2020 even though he's into I don't know youth genetics or something like that

17:36.220 --> 17:41.020
another person who came out very early about the fear and cleavage site was James Lyons Weiler a

17:41.100 --> 17:53.100
guy who wrote a an autism book with Sky Horse Publishing and it should be right there but I don't

17:53.100 --> 18:05.900
see it right now and I always never recognize the back cover of it it's there but I don't see it

18:05.900 --> 18:13.580
however we'll get it now and James Lyons Weiler also wrote a blog in February of 2020 where he

18:13.580 --> 18:19.900
had already identified the fear and cleavage site as a signal that the virus could be dangerous

18:21.500 --> 18:26.060
now I was very impressed and I remained very impressed with these two guys finding that

18:26.060 --> 18:30.780
identifying that attribute of the early sequence when it was first released

18:31.660 --> 18:42.780
because neither of them is virologists neither of them has any previous evidence in their CV before

18:42.780 --> 18:53.180
2020 of being particularly good at using a blast or working with genetic sequences and scanning them

18:53.180 --> 19:00.460
for fear and cleavage sites or enzyme sites so it's rather curious that both of them happened

19:00.460 --> 19:10.860
upon it almost in the same week and yeah it's strange but remember that this illusion of consensus

19:10.860 --> 19:20.140
was in my humble opinion started at the very very beginning once the plan was was to be executed

19:20.940 --> 19:27.340
the plan included the seeding of these two distinct narratives which is a narrative of

19:27.340 --> 19:34.620
a natural virus escaping from a wet market spreading around the world and a lab leak

19:35.340 --> 19:43.260
happening in the same city you know somewhere between 300 yards and three miles away whatever

19:43.260 --> 19:49.180
the right distance is maybe it's 10 miles away but the point is is the geographic location of

19:49.260 --> 19:57.500
this giant wet market with alien species in it and the five different coronavirus potential

19:57.500 --> 20:03.980
coronavirus laboratories that were there including the the BSL4 lab which really wouldn't have been

20:03.980 --> 20:08.380
used for coronavirus anyway which is kind of like a a red herring as well

20:11.020 --> 20:16.620
where we were set up from the very beginning for that argument to occur for that cover up to be

20:17.580 --> 20:22.540
argued about for it to be used by both sides really because China also used it

20:28.380 --> 20:33.100
and that illusion of consensus of this dangerous novel virus circulating the world

20:34.060 --> 20:40.700
and causing this this excess mortality over there that that's the illusion and that's the

20:40.700 --> 20:47.660
faith that nobody will question up until that the other thing that they won't question of course

20:47.660 --> 20:54.300
is the effectiveness of the mRNA the need to do it and the fact that beside the despite the fact

20:54.300 --> 20:59.820
that we rushed it despite the fact that it had all this contaminants in it it's been surprisingly

20:59.820 --> 21:05.820
safe that's going to be the argument that they're always going to make even after we get to the

21:05.820 --> 21:09.660
point where they admit that there's extra DNA in there because they rushed it and they used this

21:09.660 --> 21:13.660
horrible bacterial culture recombinant DNA method

21:15.980 --> 21:17.420
they're still going to point to the

21:18.060 --> 21:25.900
posity quote unquote of of adverse events and say that well yeah I guess we did and then that makes

21:25.900 --> 21:31.980
it even better the record we have right because that's not going to make them turn around and

21:31.980 --> 21:38.060
acknowledge the adverse events that they're already ignoring that they're already in denial of

21:39.020 --> 21:44.060
the DNA in there is not going to convince anybody to suddenly say oh there's is real now

21:44.940 --> 21:51.580
oh I get it and I think that's part of the trick that nobody is really seeing on our side

21:52.460 --> 21:55.500
we can fight for this DNA being in there all we want

21:56.700 --> 22:01.180
but that's not fighting for the fact that people were killed by remdesivir it's not fighting for

22:01.180 --> 22:07.100
the fact that people were killed by opiates and then rolled into this as excess deaths

22:07.180 --> 22:14.380
that that's not keeping track of the fact of who killed who when and why those people died

22:17.820 --> 22:22.940
that's actually keeping our eyes completely off the ball and focused on this crap

22:26.780 --> 22:30.140
because now what are we arguing about again we're arguing about well

22:30.940 --> 22:36.220
this group of people over here thinks that almost nobody has any adverse effects from the shots at all

22:37.100 --> 22:41.740
this group over here thinks that a bunch of people were hurt by the shot and continue to be

22:41.740 --> 22:48.380
hurt by the shot and this group over here says there's a bunch of DNA in it so what are we really

22:48.380 --> 22:54.940
changing even if we convince these people that there was DNA in it we're not even starting

22:55.660 --> 23:02.060
to try to convince them that the that the adverse events that we were already aware of are real

23:02.060 --> 23:08.700
because they don't think they are so i i don't think a lot of people see how we're really

23:08.700 --> 23:13.660
struggling inside of this plastic bag still we're not getting out we're inhaling it

23:15.500 --> 23:19.260
we're sucking in on a plastic bag right now we are not getting out of this

23:20.060 --> 23:25.980
if we're going to argue about the DNA because then what we're not talking about

23:26.700 --> 23:30.620
goes farther and farther and deeper and deeper into the cave

23:32.140 --> 23:35.340
and we keep wandering around following different flashlights

23:37.260 --> 23:40.620
and the hole to the sky was already right there it's just dark now

23:45.980 --> 23:50.700
it's dark now because everybody started to be quiet the the illusion of consensus

23:51.340 --> 23:57.180
for a time has been broken the illusion of consensus that we make fun of here with this

23:57.180 --> 24:00.220
so i'm going to escape from here and we'll come back to that later

24:01.580 --> 24:07.580
i got two videos for you to watch with me tonight the first one is really exciting because

24:08.060 --> 24:27.740
Josh Getsko was on was on Dr. Campbell's show that nurse Campbell guy talking about process one and process two of the Pfizer vaccine production and how the trials were done with

24:28.380 --> 24:30.060
with small batch

24:32.860 --> 24:39.820
small batch what was i calling it a craft brew beer and the large batch was done with miller light

24:40.780 --> 24:46.940
and so we we already knew this of course but now they're coming out with this as if it's a new story

24:47.980 --> 24:51.500
as if we didn't already know this is how they did it but it's nice that we're doing that

24:52.220 --> 24:56.700
and it's nice that Josh is getting some attention because he was of course on our show

24:57.580 --> 25:02.460
at least once you might remember him and i think he was on the show for bears but i don't remember

25:02.460 --> 25:06.780
what we talked about the second time if he was on a second time to take out any impurities after

25:06.780 --> 25:12.140
that PCR process was used again to create the template where then they you know they they use

25:12.140 --> 25:18.140
that to generate the mRNA in process two they use a different method to generate it started over

25:20.060 --> 25:25.740
so uh the Vax is super safe and effective and all that stuff John Campbell's got some here's some

25:26.700 --> 25:31.980
some concerning information about the the Vax that you didn't know

25:33.020 --> 25:38.060
get this did you know that there's two different batches there was the batches they tested

25:38.060 --> 25:43.340
and there's the batches they gave you and they weren't formulated the same did you know that

25:43.340 --> 25:47.260
watch this so you're you're an academic Josh at a Hebrew university but basically you've got

25:47.260 --> 25:51.900
links with the states as well though and um you've been studying some pretty interesting things

25:51.980 --> 25:57.740
and the first one we wanted to talk about is the um the different processes that we used in the

25:57.740 --> 26:03.260
production of the Pfizer vaccine now there seems to be process one and process two and this has

26:03.260 --> 26:07.180
got particular processes we used in the trials just give us a bit of background on that Josh if

26:07.180 --> 26:14.140
you don't mind please okay yeah sure so the key point here is that in the clinical trial that Pfizer

26:14.140 --> 26:20.860
BioNTech ran on their covid vaccine they used uh vaccine doses that were made with one manufacturing

26:20.860 --> 26:26.380
process what you referred to as process one but what was given to the public after the trial

26:26.380 --> 26:32.380
was not the same type of doses instead they used a different manufacturing process an upscale

26:32.380 --> 26:37.740
manufacturing process they call process two and that was what everybody received when they got

26:37.740 --> 26:42.060
vaccinated and now now the question for what's the difference between these two processes does it

26:42.060 --> 26:46.940
matter and and it probably does matter a lot a lot and I can walk you through some of the evidence

26:47.100 --> 26:51.660
of why we think it matters but just to give you sort of the general background and I don't know all

26:51.660 --> 26:56.780
of the technical details of this I know enough to kind of understand it but we all have learned

26:56.780 --> 27:00.860
about pieces so what do you need to do to make an mRNA vaccine you need to create you need to

27:00.860 --> 27:06.620
generate mRNA how do you do that well mRNA is like a copy of a part part of a strand of DNA so you

27:06.620 --> 27:12.860
need DNA as sort of your backbone template that you can then create mRNA off of that DNA okay

27:12.940 --> 27:18.540
so where do you get that DNA from well you can with the process one they were basically using

27:18.540 --> 27:24.220
a PCR process to duplicate DNA right that's what they do with with PCR they want to check do you

27:24.220 --> 27:31.740
have any of any of this remnant of DNA in your nose that we can say was you know covid was

27:31.740 --> 27:35.900
SARS-CoV-2 or whatever right so they replicated right that's the whole idea behind the PCR

27:37.100 --> 27:41.420
and it's relatively clean to do it that way and they were also used to your you know

27:41.580 --> 27:46.700
who does make my that's what they do with with PCR they want to check do you have any any of this

27:48.300 --> 27:52.940
remnant of DNA in your nose that we see you're not going to have a remnant of DNA you're going

27:52.940 --> 27:57.580
to have a remnant of RNA because there's no DNA involved in a coronavirus infection but I think

27:57.580 --> 28:04.380
that's just a slip up and just a mistake when you get tested by a PCR for a coronavirus you are

28:04.380 --> 28:10.780
tested for the RNA because the RNA is first exposed to reverse transcriptase that's why it's called

28:10.780 --> 28:17.580
RT-PCR reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction so in order to generate the DNA

28:18.620 --> 28:26.540
that's used to detect or sampled to detect the coronavirus you use reverse transcriptase to

28:26.540 --> 28:33.020
convert all the RNA of the sample or a lot of it into DNA and then you probe that DNA

28:34.220 --> 28:40.220
so reverse transcriptase is intimately involved in the PCR test for a coronavirus all the time

28:40.780 --> 28:48.140
said clear I hope that's very clear that enzymatic step is singular so if you miss the coronavirus

28:48.140 --> 28:54.220
in that enzymatic step then you you'll never find it and if you find one molecule of something

28:54.220 --> 29:03.020
that overlaps with your primers in that in that reverse transcriptase reaction then you will find

29:04.220 --> 29:08.460
so it's not like you're you're immediately sampling the swab when it comes out your first

29:08.460 --> 29:16.780
making DNA from the swabs RNA then you're doing PCR reverse transcriptase PCR

29:17.500 --> 29:21.900
you can say was you know covid was SARS-CoV-2 or whatever right so they replicated right that's

29:21.900 --> 29:28.220
the whole idea behind the PCR and it's relatively clean to do it that way and they were also using

29:28.220 --> 29:36.140
a very very high quality system using these magnetic these sort of magnetic beads to take out any

29:36.220 --> 29:41.180
impurities after that PCR process was used again to create the template where then they you know

29:41.820 --> 29:48.380
they use that to generate the mRNA in process two they use a different method to generate the

29:48.380 --> 29:54.860
DNA backbone okay where they basically have a DNA template that they put into this thing called a

29:54.860 --> 30:02.540
plasmid which is part of a bacteria okay and so when the bacteria where the plasmids can duplicate

30:02.540 --> 30:07.180
and then the bacteria also duplicates and it turns out to be a far more cost-effective

30:07.740 --> 30:12.140
scalable way you know you can just have the instead of like having to put in a PCR machine

30:12.140 --> 30:15.500
you just have these big bats of I don't know actually how big they are but you know you have

30:15.500 --> 30:21.180
these bats of bacteria growing and they can replicate very very quickly and then you basically you

30:21.180 --> 30:26.060
take the plasmids and you you take their DNA and you make it they make it linear instead of like

30:26.060 --> 30:31.740
wrapped up and then they use that to to generate the mRNA but after that point what they need to do

30:31.820 --> 30:38.380
is they have the plasmid DNA and they have the bacteria still in that goo and they need to clean

30:38.380 --> 30:44.860
that out and purify it okay so he's yeah I think he's getting the sequence a little bit wrong you

30:44.860 --> 30:49.260
got to take the you're going to lice the bacteria which means you're going to break the bacteria open

30:50.060 --> 30:56.540
you're going to extract the circular plasmid DNA from the bacteria then you're going to use

30:56.540 --> 31:03.260
enzymes to cut that plasmid into the piece that you want and I believe you will separate that out

31:03.260 --> 31:12.060
first before you start making your RNA and it's the separation of the spike DNA that you want to

31:12.060 --> 31:21.820
transcribe into RNA that you have to separate from the DNA that was part of the of the plasmid which

31:21.820 --> 31:28.940
allowed it to efficiently be replicated by the bacteria which includes this SV40 promoter series

31:28.940 --> 31:38.300
and etc so you're separating two pieces of DNA from one another I believe because otherwise if

31:38.300 --> 31:43.820
you turn the whole thing into RNA first then you'd also have RNA for the SV40 that you would need to

31:43.820 --> 31:50.380
separate from the RNA of the spike and that would be crazy I can't that's that's got to be wrong

31:51.340 --> 31:56.140
so first you're going to take the plasmid you're going to cut your piece of interest out

31:57.020 --> 32:02.460
and then the trick is you have to separate the piece of interest from all of this stuff which was

32:02.460 --> 32:07.420
necessary to be there in order for the plasmid to efficiently replicate in the bacteria

32:09.100 --> 32:14.700
and so it's that separation that can't go very well because it's DNA from DNA and it's different

32:14.700 --> 32:24.220
weights and so it's never going to be perfect I guess but I could be wrong I'm happy to be

32:24.220 --> 32:29.500
corrected if somebody in the chat wants to correct me that's fine that's where they seem to have

32:29.500 --> 32:34.060
done a terrible job oh and I don't know if you've been following any of the revelations that are

32:34.060 --> 32:37.820
coming out where more and more researchers around the world are replicating this finding

32:38.540 --> 32:46.220
that there are high levels of this plasmid DNA remnants in the vials of the Pfizer vaccine that

32:46.220 --> 32:51.900
have been tested in addition to that we know from Pfizer's own documents that they've submitted to

32:51.900 --> 32:59.740
various regulatory agencies that there's there's some residual lipopolysaccharide the otherwise known

32:59.740 --> 33:05.260
as endotoxin this is the membrane so what is the bacteria that they use for you know duplicating

33:05.260 --> 33:11.660
this is E. coli bacteria and which is a type of bacteria that's known as gram-negative bacteria

33:11.660 --> 33:17.260
and the membranes of gram-negative bacteria are highly inflammatory they're called endotoxin for

33:17.260 --> 33:25.580
a reason and so there are higher levels of this endotoxin in the process to vials and again this

33:25.580 --> 33:33.340
is based on what we know from Pfizer's own filings to the regulator. I just see if I've got this right

33:33.340 --> 33:38.620
so far Joshua we just run this past you so the process one they synthesize the DNA

33:40.140 --> 33:45.180
I assume synthesize it in the right bases in the right order and then they multiply the amount

33:45.180 --> 33:50.140
of DNA with a PCR process now I'm not a forensic specialist but I think we probably do this in

33:50.140 --> 33:54.220
in forensics where there's a tiny amount of DNA found at a crime scene for example or in an

33:54.220 --> 33:58.300
archaeological specimen which is a fascinating field and they're able to multiply up the amount

33:58.300 --> 34:02.780
of DNA so they've got enough to sort of be able to recognize it so they use this duplication process

34:02.780 --> 34:06.540
and that PCR process it's the same as you used in testing where you duplicate the amount of RNA

34:06.540 --> 34:10.380
that's present and of course there's a debate about that and how much it should be duplicated

34:10.380 --> 34:14.620
and whether that can give rise to false positive results of course but leaving that aside so that

34:14.620 --> 34:19.260
here the increase the amount of DNA you use that DNA to make the RNA so the DNA is the code to make

34:19.260 --> 34:25.260
the RNA so it's DNA makes RNA makes proteins that is the way it goes in biology and that's trial

34:25.260 --> 34:30.220
process one but trial process two sounds a bit more like making beer to me and so you can hear

34:30.220 --> 34:36.780
right that the process one versus process two process one can still have spike DNA in it

34:39.180 --> 34:45.100
it just won't have the the promoter series and this other things that are the the antibody

34:45.100 --> 34:51.420
biotic resistance cassette that would be present in the plasmid DNA used in the bacterial culture

34:51.420 --> 34:58.700
version of the grow-up but it could still have spike DNA and that's very likely just because

34:58.780 --> 35:04.140
again for the same reasons it's hard for them to separate these completely even if they digested

35:04.140 --> 35:11.260
them then there's going to be fragments of spike DNA in the original shot and so yeah but there

35:11.260 --> 35:15.820
won't be the the possibility of there being any bacterial components which there is of course

35:15.820 --> 35:20.940
in process two or batch two or whatever they're calling it um you uh you push it put it all in

35:20.940 --> 35:25.900
some big vat instead of using yeast they use bacterium e coli bacteria we believe

35:27.820 --> 35:31.820
oh we know we know we know a lot about their manufacturing method and a lot of it came through

35:31.820 --> 35:37.340
the ema data breach uh other other writings about it there's publications we we know

35:38.620 --> 35:42.940
that's good so the process to you kind of make a batch now a plasmid is basically a way for

35:42.940 --> 35:46.380
transferring genetic material from one bacterium to another as far as i understand it i think

35:46.460 --> 35:50.700
that's right yeah yeah so so the use in this kind of way the DNA is in the plasmid

35:51.420 --> 35:55.260
and uh that means you've got bacterial components there as well and we don't want

35:56.140 --> 36:01.500
DNA from the plasmid and we don't want other things like like like bits of cell membrane

36:01.500 --> 36:06.220
left over right um i would imagine if you gave if you did have cell membrane in any injection

36:06.220 --> 36:09.740
we're not saying the cell membrane in this but if you did have gamma negative cell cell membrane

36:09.740 --> 36:13.260
in the injection that will make you feel pretty rough for a period of time it could and it's

36:13.340 --> 36:18.780
toxic about that later how that might be linked to some of the some of the uh adverse events that

36:18.780 --> 36:24.460
came up and have been um you know so they're saying that this is so he's just said

36:25.740 --> 36:30.940
that there's correct me if i'm wrong what i'm hearing is that he said that the battery totally

36:30.940 --> 36:37.180
different processes for me he also said that the bacterial components could also contribute to

36:37.180 --> 36:42.780
adverse events so here we go almost throwing another oh we are we're throwing another possibility

36:42.780 --> 36:48.540
log on the fire and that's fine i'm not i don't have anything i don't have any problem with that

36:49.820 --> 36:55.420
i just don't want anybody to get the idea that all of these these things can be corrected because

36:55.420 --> 37:02.860
at the end of the day you're still left with transfection the best possible lipid nanoparticle

37:02.860 --> 37:11.420
transfection with the best uniform lipid nanoparticle size the best uniform lipid nanoparticle

37:11.420 --> 37:19.180
concentration of RNA the best purity of RNA transcript the best purity with the least amount of

37:20.060 --> 37:25.500
any contamination would still result in the expression of a foreign protein throughout

37:25.500 --> 37:30.300
your body and anywhere it does that you will be challenging your immune system to clear that

37:30.300 --> 37:38.860
protein by killing your own cells without causing autoimmunity and that is not a game of Russian

37:38.860 --> 37:45.740
roulette that you can play forever it's just not and anybody who's gotten away with four or five shots

37:48.540 --> 37:54.220
you know maybe they got lucky and got a placebo maybe they got lucky and it hasn't manifested

37:54.220 --> 38:01.980
itself yet maybe they got lucky some other way but i think statistically speaking this is just

38:02.060 --> 38:09.340
gonna it's gonna be overwhelming at some point my neighbor right now is is has been in bed for

38:09.340 --> 38:14.380
a couple days and she's apparently as sick as she's ever been in her life thank goodness they

38:14.380 --> 38:19.340
didn't vaccinate their children but they are vaccinated and they are worried because they

38:19.340 --> 38:24.700
tested it it's covid and she's isolating in the whole nine yards but it's never dawned on them

38:24.700 --> 38:28.860
that why doesn't anybody else in their house get sick with this extremely dangerous virus

38:29.100 --> 38:33.980
is it really possible that the isolation in the bedroom is sufficient

38:35.820 --> 38:40.220
i thought the fear and cleavage site made it the most infectious virus in the history of mankind

38:42.380 --> 38:47.420
and yet somehow if you just close the door and everything's good

38:49.260 --> 38:54.300
and people are are very sick i don't know why they are very sick but they apparently are very

38:54.380 --> 39:00.380
sick and none of them not one of them is interested in questioning the possibility that maybe the

39:00.380 --> 39:08.620
last injected medication designed to augment my immune system has made my my immune system worse

39:09.260 --> 39:13.740
has made my immune system prone to overreaction has made my immune system vulnerable

39:14.700 --> 39:19.180
all three of those don't even have to be mutually exclusive it could be additive

39:20.060 --> 39:27.820
it's not the contaminants ladies and gentlemen although it could be in addition to

39:31.180 --> 39:35.660
but it would be very much like saying you know those multicolored sprinkles on your

39:36.620 --> 39:42.300
on your on your five scoop ice cream sunday with a shell of chocolate on it

39:42.300 --> 39:45.820
those multicolored sprinkles have some pretty bad coloration in them

39:46.700 --> 39:53.580
you know blue red and i'm sorry red five and and and four blue those are really toxic

39:54.780 --> 39:57.180
those are really toxic colors you shouldn't eat those

39:59.340 --> 40:03.900
but you go ahead and keep eating three scoops of ice cream with chocolate all over them but

40:03.900 --> 40:06.780
that was that that artificial colors man those are real bad

40:07.100 --> 40:17.100
no the the bad habit is the the eating ice cream three times a day the bad habit is having a

40:17.100 --> 40:22.540
pack of cigarettes the the bad idea is transfecting yourself now if the

40:22.540 --> 40:25.980
transfection also turns out to have crap in it well yeah it's even worse

40:27.740 --> 40:32.300
if your cigarette turns out to have mold in it yeah that's even worse if your cigarette has

40:33.260 --> 40:35.580
has formaldehyde in it yeah that's even worse

40:38.940 --> 40:43.020
if the heroin you bought on the street is also contaminated with something yeah that's

40:43.020 --> 40:48.140
even worse and if you took a transfection and it's got some bacterial

40:48.700 --> 40:53.100
cell wall in it or it's got some bacterial plasmid and that's even worse

40:56.620 --> 40:58.940
but that's the way you need to think about it it's even worse

40:59.660 --> 41:05.900
this isn't why this makes it even worse

41:08.140 --> 41:14.300
Jimmy Dorr if you're watching this show this isn't why there are there are

41:15.500 --> 41:17.820
adverse events this makes it worse

41:19.100 --> 41:24.220
king the vaccine the one that they tested and then the one that they gave you yeah

41:24.220 --> 41:28.220
it's not the same yeah and the way we know this is from Pfizer's own data yeah

41:28.780 --> 41:35.420
and now he's just said that this is being linked to adverse events yeah and it seems that they're

41:35.420 --> 41:40.620
doing this other way because it's more expedient it's cheaper yeah even though it's going to have

41:40.620 --> 41:46.220
more adverse effect if their bottom line goes up and it's just quicker cheaper and they can do it

41:46.220 --> 41:51.260
that way I mean that's what I'm I think well insinuating I think that's what he's saying yeah

41:51.260 --> 41:56.460
but of course the FDA said it's like these guys aren't aware that in the original Pfizer

41:56.460 --> 42:01.100
trial 20 people died in the treated group and only 14 died in the untreated group

42:07.660 --> 42:15.500
as that the vaccine is safe and effective Kurt and it will keep you from being hospitalized sick

42:15.500 --> 42:20.540
or deaf and it's fantastic it's super safe so let's listen well he has a little bit more to say now

42:20.540 --> 42:26.060
he's talking about how it's connected to adverse events written up in the mainstream academic

42:26.060 --> 42:32.460
press that we didn't see hardly at all in the trials so we can talk about that later indeed

42:32.460 --> 42:37.740
now have I got that summary roughly right Josh is that that summary exactly right and okay

42:37.740 --> 42:42.620
before we get past this I want to make this point very clear is that yeah when you're when

42:42.620 --> 42:50.220
you're making a biological medical product or biologic the process is crucial in fact some with

42:50.220 --> 42:56.300
some people say the process is the product because you're dealing with these very complex

42:56.300 --> 43:02.380
you know the process is the product is actually a very pertinent statement here because as Peter

43:02.380 --> 43:07.260
McCullough so aptly pointed out in his appearance on my stream when he was discussing with Denny

43:07.260 --> 43:14.460
Rancour and we were talking about briefly at the end about the Nobel Prize it's ridiculous for anyone

43:14.460 --> 43:20.380
to claim that they invented this mRNA technology because in order to produce

43:21.980 --> 43:27.500
the transfection product which a lot of people are lackadaisically calling a vaccine

43:28.620 --> 43:37.740
in order to produce the transfection product thousands of patented processes ideas devices

43:38.620 --> 43:45.660
solutions algorithms were involved in the production of these transfection products

43:47.180 --> 43:51.340
and so it's really ridiculous to claim that well you know pseudo-uridine was the idea

43:52.780 --> 43:59.500
or codon optimization was the idea because again it's not it was pseudo-uridine is what they said

43:59.500 --> 44:06.300
was the idea and that's what gave them the Nobel Prize but that's not what enabled the production

44:06.380 --> 44:12.220
of a billion doses and that was really what what Peter was trying to say and maybe alluding

44:12.220 --> 44:18.300
to the fact that really we needed to pay attention to what we really claimed to have done

44:19.180 --> 44:27.020
which is make billions of doses of a previously non-existing product that contains lipid nanoparticles

44:27.020 --> 44:36.220
of a particular size and an RNA of a particular claimed purity and if that's really not what they

44:36.300 --> 44:41.500
did that's not what they manufactured or they took shortcuts that they knew

44:42.460 --> 44:47.420
would lead to something that was not that then maybe we have some ground to stand on

44:50.460 --> 44:56.780
chemical interactions large molecules i'll give you an example have you ever heard of the cutter

44:56.780 --> 45:02.700
incident no based on the cutter incident and this there was a book written by one of the you

45:02.700 --> 45:07.580
know high priest effect how can he not know about the cutter incident that's really weird

45:09.180 --> 45:09.500
wow

45:12.300 --> 45:15.180
john camel doesn't know about the cutter incident wow

45:15.740 --> 45:21.100
technology in the u.s. paul off it on this topic but what happened the cutter incident happened

45:21.100 --> 45:26.860
with the original polio vaccines in the 1950s so jones salt you know created this polio vaccine

45:26.860 --> 45:31.900
they ran a trial on about two million children it was very successful and so then they turned it

45:31.900 --> 45:35.580
over to a few different labs and they said okay now we need to make a bunch of this stuff

45:35.580 --> 45:39.820
but they didn't provide them with the precise directions on how to exactly replicate

45:39.820 --> 45:45.500
salt's process can you believe that so i know kurt brought this up on the show originally

45:45.500 --> 45:49.340
that's how i first found out about this the first batches of the polio vaccine

45:50.300 --> 45:56.380
not good so go ahead so what happened in the cutter laboratory they were making vaccines that

45:56.460 --> 46:02.380
had live polio virus and when they injected them into kids they got polio there were over 200,000

46:02.380 --> 46:08.940
kids who got a short-lived polio a few hundred who got permanent polio and a few if you could

46:08.940 --> 46:14.300
actually die this is not conspiracy theory this is not anti-vax mythology you know this is this

46:14.300 --> 46:21.100
is accepted history and one of the key lessons that was learned from that is yeah the guy in the

46:21.180 --> 46:27.980
blue shirt is being interviewed by john campbell and and jimmy dor is showing the interview of

46:27.980 --> 46:35.820
john campbell's youtube video on his youtube show so this is actually like some kind of multi-dimensional

46:35.820 --> 46:41.260
stream because i'm streaming somebody who's streaming someone else's youtube video and so

46:41.260 --> 46:47.500
i'm watching someone else watch someone else's youtube video and if you can't handle that and you

46:47.580 --> 46:52.780
need i'm just teasing i was going to say something tough i'm just teasing you but that's what's

46:52.780 --> 46:56.220
happening that's why you're confused and you're dealing with something complicated like a

46:56.220 --> 47:02.540
vaccine a biological drug you need to be very precise about the method and once you change the

47:02.540 --> 47:06.780
method you change the product and you can't just assume that it's going to have the same effect

47:07.500 --> 47:13.660
on people so you need to do another uh clinical trial on your new product it's not the same product

47:14.220 --> 47:19.020
now we've talked about this many times on stream i'd just like to remind you that the analogy that

47:19.020 --> 47:25.580
i've used a few times that you might remember with a ding is um the idea that your grandma or in my

47:25.580 --> 47:33.340
case my wife makes the most fantastic apple pie with just the hint of lemon the crust is great

47:33.340 --> 47:41.260
everything is magnificent but if you just decided okay let's make 10 000 of those it's not as simple

47:41.340 --> 47:48.300
as saying okay let's make 10 000 of those you can't just make them one by one you're going to scale

47:48.300 --> 47:56.060
things up and you can imagine that very quickly my wife or whoever is going to take the recipe

47:56.060 --> 48:02.540
from my wife is going to have a problem on their hands understanding how to translate this small

48:02.540 --> 48:11.740
scale small batch boutique pie that can go wrong occasionally into something that we can make at

48:11.740 --> 48:17.900
scale the way that you buy the ingredients the way that you mix them how do you mix them how do you

48:17.900 --> 48:22.060
get the pies out where do you go with them how do you package them how do you store them how do you

48:22.060 --> 48:28.940
get them around the country is all very different then come over to my house and have a pie it's

48:28.940 --> 48:36.060
very different than come to my lab and i'll make you nanograms of RNA and we can test it out

48:38.380 --> 48:43.740
and that we have talked about many times even Vincent racking yellows talked about that but he's

48:43.740 --> 48:49.500
talked about it in a very wow isn't that crazy that they went from nanograms to kilograms

48:49.820 --> 48:59.340
nanograms to kilograms is is closer to one apple pie to 500 000 apple pies

49:01.580 --> 49:08.940
think about that i mean 10 000 pies already sounded quite absurd but we're talking about going from

49:08.940 --> 49:18.540
real craft brewery you know like like a barista contest and you know i was about to show you

49:18.620 --> 49:25.100
something dumb there a barista contest and you know here's your cup of coffee sir

49:27.340 --> 49:33.100
i taste the beans are from south america and you've triple done whatever bing bang boom with the

49:33.100 --> 49:36.620
with mushrooms and stuff wow this is the best cup of coffee i've ever had

49:37.420 --> 49:43.020
now let's go open a a franchise in in in 30 cities next week

49:43.900 --> 49:49.420
it doesn't work and so now that is a problem

49:50.940 --> 49:57.980
love watch that just watch out because what that suggests is is that wait so if my doctor

49:57.980 --> 50:04.300
has a little RNA machine then he could make RNA for me and it would be better if we just made

50:04.300 --> 50:09.500
smaller batches it would be better you mean we could make it even safer than it was because

50:09.500 --> 50:15.100
the tv said it was safe i don't know anybody that's really hurt i just can't breathe anymore and

50:15.100 --> 50:21.180
i get sick a lot but i'm not hurt by i mean you see where this goes you see how enticing it is

50:21.740 --> 50:29.660
to think again mystery solved they rushed it mystery solved it's the dna mystery solved it's

50:29.660 --> 50:38.140
the endotoxin careful ladies and gentlemen be careful so that's what will end it so i don't

50:38.140 --> 50:42.540
know how much i'm allowed to say but i'm just going to show what john campbells showed

50:44.380 --> 50:50.220
next one is uh quite fun it's 30 minutes i'm going to speed it up a little bit but i won't speed

50:50.220 --> 51:01.020
it up very much because there is an accent in the show so let's see here i think i'm going to enjoy

51:01.100 --> 51:06.220
this i haven't watched it but i'm excited it's more scooby-doo business

51:11.100 --> 51:15.820
it's also on a balance for me can you imagine internet platforms like google search twitter and

51:15.820 --> 51:21.180
google translate being used to unravel the mystery behind the origins of sasco v2 a crack team of

51:21.180 --> 51:26.460
data scientists mathematicians engineers and biologists did exactly that to amass evidence

51:26.460 --> 51:31.020
that has now compelled the world to set up and take notice of the hypothesis that sasco v2

51:31.020 --> 51:36.460
the virus that causes covid-19 is this too fast or is it okay she's she's already pretty fast but

51:36.460 --> 51:42.060
it'll be all right i think 19 may have emerged from a lab in china the team calls itself drastic

51:42.060 --> 51:46.860
it is an informal amalgam of experts and researchers from across the world who painstakingly pieced

51:46.860 --> 51:51.820
together various strands of data your mouse ready that lab origin of the virus is a plausible

51:52.780 --> 51:56.620
watch my whole family is going to be on discoveries made by drastic a significant

51:56.620 --> 52:01.580
in unraveling the mystery behind the origins of sasco v2 my whole family is going to be on indian

52:01.580 --> 52:04.540
television holy crap

52:08.860 --> 52:14.620
more than 20 researchers there it is oh my gosh look it's my whole family on indian television

52:14.780 --> 52:22.300
oh dear goodness what was i thinking investigating covid-19 what a dumb twitter handle picture

52:29.820 --> 52:33.660
that's not right but steam members had been researching the origins of covid-19

52:33.660 --> 52:38.300
okay maybe they had been researching the origins so this is yuri dagan this is the

52:38.620 --> 52:48.860
the russian living in canada who published with rosza ro rosana sogretto

52:50.060 --> 52:55.660
um and they published a paper about the fear and cleavage site this is mona and her husband who

52:57.100 --> 53:02.780
published the paper about the moyang mine and the fact that ratg 13 the virus which

53:03.340 --> 53:09.340
shengli she reported as being the closest relative to sars covid-19 and their database

53:09.340 --> 53:18.700
was actually also previously published as a virus with the number 491 i believe rs 491

53:19.260 --> 53:26.460
bat corona virus rs 491 and then this is a french researcher who actually is the one that

53:27.420 --> 53:32.300
tucker carlson said had found a drastic and again i would argue that he joined around the

53:32.300 --> 53:38.140
same time that charles rixie joined maybe before charles rixie but not much before

53:41.180 --> 53:47.100
and so was definitely not part of the original drastic team at all and so that's that should

53:47.100 --> 53:52.460
be kept clear before they joined the group then they started working with each other informally

53:52.540 --> 53:59.420
luigi was part of the original group and there's the real one that's the guy who started it all

53:59.420 --> 54:07.660
right billy boston and so there's yuri there's rosana is his co-author andre guffinette is a

54:07.660 --> 54:11.980
md from belgium and he actually reviewed a couple of the papers that i also reviewed i think he

54:11.980 --> 54:19.820
reviewed mona's paper with me and he also reviewed yuri's paper with me um let's see day

54:20.140 --> 54:25.020
was some guy i think who lives in australia and he's got a lot of seems like he's got a lot of

54:25.020 --> 54:32.620
knowledge about about the sequences the seeker is the guy who found the phd thesis and the master's

54:32.620 --> 54:41.260
thesis in chinese about the minors that got sick and luan um yeah so there's a few people to mention

54:41.260 --> 54:47.820
see where we go here after joining there's me again down there he's drastic they worked as a

54:47.820 --> 54:53.500
team sharpening each other's insights and connecting the dots to demystify so luigi warn is a guy who

54:53.500 --> 55:01.900
did um a postdoc with not steven ben cell but the other guy with the funny glasses um and so luigi

55:01.900 --> 55:10.380
warn was actually also involved in the sort of figuring out that sudo yuridine worked here i'm

55:10.460 --> 55:16.300
not really sure what else he did but he definitely was involved in some of the research um at a

55:16.300 --> 55:22.940
crucial time since of covid-19 this website hosts the research work of these twitter detectives

55:22.940 --> 55:29.260
on the origins of covid-19 but these researchers are not the only contributors of this uh i believe

55:29.260 --> 55:36.540
that this website was actually really just started about a month or so after charles rixie joined

55:36.540 --> 55:45.100
and a month or so after antonio i think joined francisco was very early in coronavirus movie was

55:45.100 --> 55:54.060
very early in kevin mck h was very early in um kevin mck h is a really interesting fella that i

55:54.060 --> 56:01.580
you know i could talk about but then i'd probably get killed on the origins of covid-19 but these

56:01.660 --> 56:06.460
researchers are not the only contributors of drastic many of its members prefer to operate

56:06.460 --> 56:13.100
anonymously some of the drastic team members like india based scientists so prefer to operate

56:13.100 --> 56:17.340
anonymously was one of the reasons why i didn't like working with them and i was certainly very

56:17.340 --> 56:20.620
upset when they kind of basically asked me to leave because i wanted to talk about the

56:20.620 --> 56:26.220
transfection but then i asked ever after asking me to leave they kept me in the group kind of

56:26.220 --> 56:32.300
sort of i'm still on their web page etc but when you click on that web page i could never get

56:32.300 --> 56:39.660
billy to put any links to my channels on there or to my twitter on there which is really strange

56:39.660 --> 56:44.780
right i guess my twitter probably was linked but i couldn't get him to link to my youtube or to my

56:44.780 --> 56:51.660
review or to to my twitch and at one point i was told that that's because the person that ran

56:51.740 --> 56:57.820
that website was actually in empt in tie land and they couldn't get in touch with them right now

56:57.820 --> 57:01.660
but as soon as we get in touch with them we'll put all your links up and they're not up

57:03.340 --> 57:09.020
so this is mona i think she's pretty good person at least in so far as what she's done she's pushed

57:09.020 --> 57:15.660
this you know idea that the coronavirus sequences like this were found in a bat cave and it was a

57:15.660 --> 57:20.940
cave that they've been interested ever since they found it ever since these three guys got sick

57:20.940 --> 57:27.260
and died apparently couple dr monali rahalkar and dr rahul bahulikar have been vocal about their

57:27.260 --> 57:33.500
findings in this article published on thirteenth june 2021 in an india based news magazine the week

57:33.500 --> 57:37.980
the scientists duo from pune described their discoveries that can help in clearing the haze

57:37.980 --> 57:43.020
around the origins of the virus they write that as a scientific couple they were intrigued by the

57:43.020 --> 57:48.940
virus and started an online expedition at the end of march 2020 the journey led them to discover

57:49.020 --> 57:53.100
the link between a copper mine in china at the nearest relative of sars kovitu

57:54.540 --> 58:00.380
i rahul my husband we started this uh investigation or searching for kovit 19 origins

58:00.380 --> 58:06.300
last year uh we came across several papers and the two of them actually said that the kovit 19

58:06.300 --> 58:10.620
was uh you know having a zoonotic origin these papers were published in lancet and nature

58:10.620 --> 58:14.860
medicine but we were not completely convinced by these papers reading some more papers we found

58:14.940 --> 58:18.380
that there was a very interesting one published uh from north carotina university

58:18.380 --> 58:23.100
which talked about chimeric karuna viruses so we thought that oh okay such things can also happen

58:23.100 --> 58:27.660
and this paper was written by vinik menachari or the first author and you will be very interested

58:27.660 --> 58:34.620
to know that uh she's angry the um bat woman or the uh center for uh uh emerging diseases head had

58:34.620 --> 58:39.820
also co-authored this paper the scientist couple further write about china's foremost coronavirus

58:40.140 --> 58:45.500
institute housing one of the world's largest elections of bat samples and bat virus trains

58:45.500 --> 58:50.140
the vuhan institute of virology and its lead researcher she zengli who was among the first

58:50.140 --> 58:55.340
to identify horseshoe bats as national reservoirs for sars kov the virus that sparked an outbreak

58:55.340 --> 59:00.940
in 2002 they refer to this article in us based magazine scientific american published on eleventh

59:00.940 --> 59:07.180
march 2020 carrying statements by she zengli referring to a 2012 incident the article reads

59:07.180 --> 59:11.660
she's team had been called in to investigate the virus profile of her mind shaft in unence

59:11.660 --> 59:16.460
mountain and smuji and county the six miners suffered from pneumonia like diseases and to

59:16.460 --> 59:21.980
died after sampling the cave for one year the researchers discovered a diverse group of coronaviruses

59:21.980 --> 59:27.260
in six bat species in many cases multiple viral strains had infected a single animal

59:27.260 --> 59:33.180
turning it into a flying factory for new viruses the article for this a flying factory defined

59:33.180 --> 59:43.580
by multiple positive PCR tests flying factory that's it nothing more multiple s proteins multiple

59:43.580 --> 59:49.340
and proteins meant a flying factory that's it that's all they could find PCR that's it said

59:49.340 --> 59:54.460
the genomic sequence of the virus eventually named sars kov 2 was 96 percent identical to

59:54.460 --> 59:59.820
that of a coronavirus the researchers had identified in horseshoe bats in uni and of course 96 percent

59:59.900 --> 01:00:06.940
identical means that the vast majority of identified t cell epitopes are identical to previous coronaviruses

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:14.940
related to it from years ago that's significant because it kind of tells you how much coronavirus

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.940
really changes and how much of the coronavirus genome is either stagnant or unknown or undescribed

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.140
or assumed but you can't have it both ways

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:33.260
significantly the article did not specify the name of the 2012 virus the indian scientific couple

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:39.500
referred to another article published in nature on third february 2020 and co-authored by she zengli

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:45.500
which mentions that rat g13 found a new non-probins was 96.2 percent similar and the closest relative

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.940
of sars kov 2 but this is what she zengli did not disclose to readers of scientific american

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:59.020
and nature she zengli the bad woman did not reveal that this rat g13 had an older name and this

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:05.340
older name was uh bt kov 491 we found this in a pre-print by a doctor dean benston and it was

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:11.900
available on the internet in april 2021 uh this was the second law which we uh found uh in scientific

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:17.660
she zengli was also talking about this mojang mine shop which uh where there was an incident uh

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:22.700
where uh two of the six miners had died in a pneumonia like illness but she had not revealed

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:28.380
that uh she got the rat g13 from this mine not to confirm that this particular mine was the same

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.060
we were searching for again and on uh there was a paper in the very famous journal science

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.620
which confirmed that uh they had also written about this incident and this confirmed that

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:44.540
this was the same mine the mine shop in mojang uh where three miners had died due to a pneumonia

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:50.940
like illness and uh the mine was the same where rat g13 sample was picked up by she zengli

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:56.140
coincidentally at least three other researchers reached the same conclusions independently

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.100
around the same time

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:05.420
us based scientist and entrepreneur hugi baron ockland based engineer and data scientist

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.460
gels demenov and russian canadian biotype entrepreneur eury diggin all of whom were among

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:16.380
the founding members of drastic later in this article public see later this is not right i

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:25.820
think it's really weird um i feel like this is out of order but maybe i'm wrong so i'm not

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:37.420
gonna commit to it yet but they definitely found the phd and master's thesis when drastic

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:49.660
was already formed and i'm pretty sure they also figured out rat g13 when drastic was already

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.860
formed so i feel like this narrative is wrong but i don't know

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:58.220
in an american online publishing platform medium on 22nd april 2020 you reported out

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.220
yes on 22nd april 2020 if that's his first one

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:09.340
i don't think that though she knew about rat g13 she only disclosed it in january 2020

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:15.260
when i wrote the medium article in april i was already kind of suspicious at whether the ritg

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:20.060
sample was collected from the same spot as this four nine and one fragment they were both listed

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:25.260
as coming from unan four nine one was uh more detailed coming from the small jiang mine and

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:31.260
ritg 13 is actually was very broadly described as coming from the puer city autonomous region

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:35.260
and so that raised suspicion because you know the genomic fragment match hundred percent

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.860
and this was also noticed by my co-author rasana segretta independently even back in

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:43.820
pink march and so we put kind of the two and two together and we realized that you know

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:49.100
a hundred percent match for the fragment so independently two people in canada came to the

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:57.740
conclusion that these two viruses were the same like really how would they have done that without

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:01.580
already being in the same group together as the people who discovered that the mine was the same

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:09.180
you see they're kind of portraying it as though mona figured it out separate from yuri figured it

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:18.380
out separate from luigi but luigi is actually tweeting i believe knowing that yuri and mona

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:26.460
are working on this like we're all working on it it's a really weird sort of rewrite of the story

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:32.140
that so many different people figured it out together independently and then came together as

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:38.060
drastic because that's not what happened it's weird and all of the details of collection being

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:43.340
very similar most likely means that you know rpg 13 comes from it's basically the full g

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.620
it fact it's starting to become very clear in my head why they would say this because then drastic

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:57.740
doesn't mean anything then drastic wasn't this operation to set up a group of people to go out

01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:06.540
and scream lab leak but i know for a fact it was and it united a bunch of people with the same

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:15.420
suspicions and then the fire was then thrown into that group in the form of phd theses and

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.300
you know sequences and you know these kind of clues and oh yeah what do you think and whatever

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:27.580
this is a rewrite what this is is trying to make it seem like all kinds of people around the world

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.500
were figuring out the same thing at the same time and that's what brought them together

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:40.620
when in reality a bunch of skeptics were brought into a group me being one of them

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:47.180
Dan Saratkin the crazy man being one of them Yuri Degan being one of them Luigi Warren who

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:55.980
knew all about the RNA being one of them and brought into a group that could then be used to create what

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:04.540
the illusion of consensus and i think they actually thought that they could influence me not to talk

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:09.100
about the transfection by making an illusion of consensus that these people all agreed that it

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:16.380
was most important absolutely the most important thing to figure out was where did this virus come

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:24.060
from so much so that i had a member of drastic come to my house in Pittsburgh to make sure that

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:30.060
i understood that where this virus came from was the most important mystery to solve and that

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.660
leaked documents could lead us right to the person we needed to unmask or the people we needed to put

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:42.060
in jail somebody made the virus and that making of the virus allowed it to go around the world

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:48.620
like magic and he thinks that he's on to the molecular clue that allowed the virus to go around

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:59.980
the world like magic you know of the 491 fragment that was published in 2016 an enigmatic person

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:04.700
from eastern India who calls himself seeker and prefers to stay anonymous helped both Monalia

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:09.660
and Yuri connect the dots between Ratji one three i agree Catherine but i think Catherine at that

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:17.180
time they really thought that i was in i was under their control i was under their control i was

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:22.300
doing what they were encouraging me to do i was saying the things that they wanted me to say

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:33.020
on my bike so yeah he did lead you to me and people were promoting me at that time and then

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:40.140
suddenly not anymore around the time when i tried to get in touch with Alina Chan about her paper

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:46.140
as things started to go south about the time i started talking about natural immunity being the

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:51.900
only way out that that if the vaccine worked at all we would want to save it for the people who

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:57.420
need it maybe but we certainly wouldn't want to give it to everybody because that doesn't really

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:02.620
make biological sense but you know i didn't even know that there were papers and mechanisms to

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:12.060
describe that yet i was just talking off my gut or ra 491 found in mochiang mine in chanas yunan

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:18.460
and sas kowi too the seekers email said that actually he had found a master thesis published

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:24.700
from china and he also sent us a link to the master thesis this thesis talked about the pneumonia

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:30.140
cases which had happened to this particular minors in the mochiang my shop so it was a very

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.020
detailed account of the illness what happened to the minors which had gone to clean up the mind

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:41.020
now what happened to these people so these people started experiencing a fever cough and later on

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:46.140
that cough turned into pneumonia china or chinese doctors could have thought that this could be

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:53.100
related to sas and therefore they they consulted dr zong nanshan now dr zong nanshan is known as

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:58.860
the sas doctor of china and he has also provided very important inputs in covid-19 so zong nanshan

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:04.860
remotely consulted these cases and he described this particular patients pneumonia to be of the

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:10.060
viral origin so the minors pneumonia resemble covid-19 in all different senses and in our paper we

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.940
have purely compared that in contrast to that she's angry mentioned in her interview with

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:20.700
scientific american that the minors have contracted a fungal disease and this was there were no

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:26.620
reasons given by her and so this case becomes even more suspicious in this article in medium

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.980
geeelstemonov points to conclusions in a master thesis under the guidance of sas expert dr zong

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:36.860
nanshan dr zong was consulted by the kunming hospital after the second minor died and had

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:42.060
got the two remaining patients and the two recovered ones to be tested again for sas antibodies

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.020
the vohan institute of virology handled these tests which all turned out positive while the

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:51.660
master thesis concludes that the unknown virus that led to cevia pneumonia could be the sas

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:56.540
like coronavirus from the chinese rufus horseshoe bat or another bat's sas like coronavirus

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.860
it also juxtaposes this conflicting opinion of she's angry geeelse writes that it's odd that

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:08.620
a 2016 phd thesis under the guidance of gaufu china's cdc head concluded that the cause of the

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:14.060
2012 outbreak was not yet clear totally ignoring the opinion and diagnosis of dr zong nanshan

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:19.020
also ignoring the four sas antibodies test done at the vohan institute of virology that all turned

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:24.780
out positive besides ignoring the fact that the wiv did indeed follow the lead of dr zong nanshan

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:31.020
and went sampling bats in that very cave in 2030 when our drastic member the seeker found the

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.340
thesis the master's thesis from the mojiang mine it essentially confirmed that yes the

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.740
four nine one is the same as rpg 13 because it was collected after the miners got started like

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:44.700
pneumonia and the wohan institute of virology was actually invited to investigate both the

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:49.900
miners and then the cave later where they sampled several viruses from the bats so that confirmed

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:54.780
our suspicions and eventually the wohan institute virology was you know forced to admit that yes

01:10:54.780 --> 01:11:00.220
this is the same virus same sample which for some reason they renamed from originally four nine one

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:04.940
to rpg 13 and that was a very suspicious thing to do because they never mentioned in their paper

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:10.140
how they came across rpg 13 in the 2020 paper they just you know very short sentence mentioning

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:14.140
that oh we matched you know small fragment but they didn't say what kind of fragment it was

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:21.020
and then they made a hint that they sequenced rpg 13 fully only after they noticed the fragment

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:26.140
which is very odd because also we discovered later that they sequenced rpg 13 and 2018

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.460
basically when they uploaded the sequencing data to jin bank we noticed that it said

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.660
year of sequencing 2017 and 2018 one of our drastic members Francisco diocese noticed this

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:40.060
and then also we confronted the wohan institute were all jasking when exactly the sequenced rpg 13

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:44.380
genome and they were forced to again admit that they actually sequenced it much earlier they sequenced

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:50.860
it in 2018 some plastic people were able to actually show that effectively rpg 13 was nothing else

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.540
that another virus was the same virus under a different name which was four nine nine one

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.140
and that's four nine nine one was the name of the virus in the description of the accident

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:03.180
of the miners in moshank so when drastic people found the story of the moshank mine

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:07.420
they found it by four nine nine one and it took a lot of time to actually be able to say well

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:12.220
actually four nine nine one from the moshank mine is the rpg 13 that she generally is talking about

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.140
so people are suspecting that the change of name may be a way to try to actually

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:20.860
hide the link to the mine it's not very clear but some people find it quite suspect

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.060
the scientific couple from Pune and Yuri Dagan then independently drew an important link

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:30.860
between batwoman she's angry his controversial research work in the wohan institute of biology

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:35.660
and a possible lab origin of sars kovita no sorry it's two years ago

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:42.700
has denied the fact that they had a sars coronavirus to before the pandemic it is an

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:47.580
intriguing fact that they had this rpg 13 from the beginning now they were doing various

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:54.220
experiments which created primary virus is rachi 13 is 96.2 percent related to sars kovita

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:59.660
so there is a possibility that this particular virus rachi 13 was either not what i wanted

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.380
or a synthetic model my main my main reason for showing this video was because i wanted to show

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.300
you what you can do here to find out how bad it is

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:14.060
so i am looking at the wrong search here

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:23.340
hey everybody how's it going i hope that gosh i love him um hey let's see i want to do a dark

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.980
course Yuri

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:49.580
would you be surprised to know would you be surprised to know that in in 2020 Yuri Dagan

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.220
a member of drastic

01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:01.980
was on the dark horse podcast in june 2020 june of 2020

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.060
before i even knew who the hell bread wine steam was

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:18.620
hey folks welcome to the dark horse podcast i have with me Yuri Dagan

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:26.540
who is in moscow he is a tech entrepreneur and longevity researcher who has recently

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:34.300
come to my attention as someone who has done extensive work looking into the origins of the

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:41.420
sars kovita pandemic and i was very impressed when i read his paper on medium i talked about it

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:47.660
previously on the podcast with heather and so many of you have seen his work what you may or may not

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:53.740
know is that especially this week that work has shown up in a number of mainstream publications

01:14:53.740 --> 01:15:02.140
as a a strong bit of research pointing in the direction of at least not shutting down the

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:10.060
laboratory origin hypothesis for the virus well what's even worse is if you do this and you realize

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:19.660
that bread wine steam is actually most likely an orchestrated phenomenon

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:29.740
let's just take a look at this really quick to make you aware that this is out there and then

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:36.780
you can do your own research you can watch your own videos i'll put this in here in the chatty chat

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.700
as well let's just check this one out

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:51.660
that's the that is the end of the liberal arts college that is the end of liberal arts college

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.660
right there all right uh so

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:04.220
i hope you're ready oh wow that the man at the center of the controversy

she said milk coffee please yes milk cream testing testing

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:20.140
look at his face well if you can really yeah how about that the man at the center of the controversy

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.340
she said milk right now yes

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:48.700
go hey hey oh oh he says he's not going to go hey hey oh oh he's going to want to hear a goddamn thing

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:53.980
you have to say you can't tell my mother you shut the fuck up he's the white bass father they never

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:59.100
didn't even be holding him and him and all these people accountable we don't really do it all please

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:07.740
i want to thank the council for the incredible plan you have put together please let's all give

01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:15.020
him a round of applause

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:25.500
so is there a beginning to the story and all kind of sort of

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:31.820
um the beginning of the story is that evergreen

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:39.260
was the most experimental of experimental i'm going to interrupt him for just one second

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:43.420
i'm going to go back to the guy who asked this question right here the dude can you see my arrow

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:48.540
that guy right there that guy is a group a part of a group of three

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:59.020
the college professors who have been submitting gender studies papers that were fake

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:06.300
and getting them accepted into big journals to prove that gender studies was a disaster

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:15.820
and what you see here is him and his two colleagues who are involved in this

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:22.300
gender studies debunking exercise two of which are putting their faculty positions on the line to

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:31.100
do it telling Brett Weinstein story and putting Brett Weinstein in front of them as a as a figure

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:42.060
head or a leader even though they've been busy trying to break this weird fake university whole

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:47.980
entire departments that are fake trying to break that mythology for a while

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.500
now we put Brett in front of all of them and all of their work even though in this

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.980
documentary they will talk about the work that these other people have done Brett is the star

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:05.020
and that's questionable to the point of why are you'll see later why are there so many good

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:09.260
recordings the ones we have seen so far weren't that good but they'll get better

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:17.580
is there a beginning to the story and all kind of sort of um the beginning of the story

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:26.540
is that evergreen was the most experimental of experimental how do i describe this place

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:31.420
i find evergreen is i was told that it's a place where a lot of people use drugs

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:36.860
i can be comfortable for who i am like psychedelic drugs he's very outdoorsy so it gives you that

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:44.220
ah fresh filling you know i like that an evergreen student is looking for something that

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.300
isn't as common in the educational structure in america they are searching for more independence

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.420
for cadence in life

01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.020
it was a place that survived long after the era of the founding of experimental colleges was over

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.900
the core elements of it were a couple things one was

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:15.180
the literal total freedom of faculty to teach what they want in whatever manner they want

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:20.780
so long the students showed up to the classes um it was founded by washington state governor

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:26.380
daniel evins the best friend of bill gates senior in case you're unaware um it's an interesting

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.860
college with an interesting history 16 credits a quarter sometimes 48 quarters

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.940
an entire year so you'd be with one group of students 25 if you're teaching alone 50 if you're

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:40.540
teaching someone else for 16 hours a week on field trips 24 seven the entire year you're

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.900
just developing community it was actually an extraordinary place to be and to learn

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:51.740
about the brains of other human beings and also to develop theory which is part of what we were

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:56.140
doing there so we didn't want anything to start to go around actual theory about what to go

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:01.420
awry but we don't exactly know i thought they taught evolution a new president george bridges

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:08.540
was hired hey welcome we are going to have a great year ahead at first he hired a friend of his to

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:15.740
interview a great many students faculty alumni staff in order to get the lay of the land and

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:24.220
evergreen being as far left to college as exists in the country was chronically suspicious the

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:30.780
faculty were of administrators right anything administration wanted to do the faculty would

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:37.100
if anything they were biased in favor of discussing it more than necessary and not letting anything

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:42.540
pass because um basically it was labor versus management and everybody's mind the job this

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:48.140
president who was clearly out to do something had in front of him was how am i getting

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:55.260
how am i going to convince this very left with faculty to not only look the other way while i

01:21:55.260 --> 01:22:01.740
make radical changes to the college but actually embrace my bloat of administration and my tearing

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.740
down of the evergreen model how can i do that i can do it by embracing equity we have three major

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:12.140
goals for today's forum the first is to continue to learn about the perceptions and

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:18.300
experiences of our students faculty and staff of color the second is to create and establish a

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.620
series of i don't think she broke her neck with that one and the third is to inspire every member

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.420
of the evergreen community as we move ahead to advance diversity here on our campus

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:34.780
i'd like to read a list of core tenets developed by a group of anti-racist educators who was

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:40.220
who were on a panel at the race and pedagogy conference in Tacoma last year here are the

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:49.260
tenants racism exists today in both traditional and modern forms racism is an institutionalized

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:55.100
multi-layered multi-level system that distributes unequal power and resources between white people

01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:01.900
and people of color as socially identified and disproportionately benefits whites all members

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:07.100
of society are so socialized to participate in the system of racism albeit within varied

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:14.780
social locations all white people benefit from racism regardless of intentions no one chose to

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:21.580
be socialized into racism so no one is quote unquote bad but no one is neutral to not act against

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:29.580
racism is to support racism racism must be continually identified analyzed and challenged no one is ever

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:37.100
done the question is not did racism take place but rather how did racism manifest in that situation

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:43.580
the racial status quo is comfortable for most whites therefore anything that maintains white

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:50.860
comfort is suspect the racially oppressed have a more intimate insight via experiential knowledge

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:55.660
of the system of race and then their racial oppressors however white professors will be seen

01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:02.700
as having more legitimacy thus positionality must be intentionally engaged resistance is a

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:08.540
predictable reaction to anti-racist education and must be explicitly and strategically addressed

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:16.380
wow good how many pages there are i believe these core tenants can be a guide for our work moving

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:22.220
they are core ten actions to educate our health not tenants ten and our students ten tenants

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:29.020
we galvanize white privilege in the form of curriculum exulting tenants yeah tenants not

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:40.220
tenants literature theory and scientific thinking or so we don't examine how those canons are made

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:47.100
i believe we are capable of unlearning the habits of mind that perpetuate white privilege

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:54.700
what i am uncertain of is our collective will to examine those habits

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:03.020
this i believe i believe evergreen can create a more vibrant community this i believe

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:10.300
i racist activists this i believe he said is that any different than saying this i believe is

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:18.940
like bret does that vaccines are the greatest invention of mankind in medicine this i believe

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:25.180
it's in a university but look what we're seeing here look at the production of this

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:33.180
this is a documentary that is not meant to show these people in a bad light it's giving them

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:38.220
an opportunity to say exactly what they wanted to say with a great recording

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.700
in both of my ears with no noise

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:49.020
breath's not explaining it one of these other people isn't explaining it so that we

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:54.700
understand explicitly how dumb it is from the moment we say it but instead we're allowing them

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:58.140
to say it at their own pace and their own cadence

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:08.300
so don't see this movie as a expose on what they did to Brett Weinstein see it as a message

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.940
and Brett Weinstein is the messenger and the message the part of the message is being

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:20.700
co-opted is the message of the people that actually made this movie that thought that they were

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:27.980
going to elevate their own cause a fight against gender studies and that kind of nonsense academia

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:34.700
they were going to elevate their own cause by elevating the cause of Brett Weinstein when instead

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:42.460
what happened was basically their entire movement was co-opted on our staff and faculty and among

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:49.580
our students if we break our 45 year pattern of occasionally turning toward these issues

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:57.340
briefly with deep but short run commitment that fades yes a boat anchor exactly it's like a boat

01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:02.780
a words of action disappearing into the background as we return to business as usual

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.820
breaking this cycle will take sustained and stubborn

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:13.820
going a little short color critical and audacious goal of eliminating racism and violence in our

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:21.660
world i believe we're all privileged to engage in that work in a learning community that wants

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:29.420
to be better and i believe we have the will to do so thank you for coming today an imaginary

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:37.020
community i don't know if i saw an imaginary there was a faculty meeting with an unusual

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:50.060
agenda the agenda involved the faculty voting to require our union to insert into our contract

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:57.500
a provision in which every faculty member would reflect on their own growth relative to their

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:05.340
personal racism each and every year in their self evaluation there is something preposterous

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:10.300
about this idea these other these other we all have this internal racism these other two people

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:15.020
have been asked to personally reflect on our own internal racism every year i still would have

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:20.140
been troubled by the fact of the assumption that it was present but nonetheless it would

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:25.180
not have posed the danger in the institutional context of here could you write to us about your

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:33.180
own racism every year in your self evaluation which then becomes fodder for promotion for firing for

01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:40.860
all sorts of proceedings and so at the point that this faculty meeting occurred i went to it and

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:50.940
um i stood up and i said i said i've never been afraid to stand before this faculty before but

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:58.940
i have real trepidation about what i'm about to say i then said look i believe my record is strong

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:05.660
enough that i can afford the accusation that i expect to come back but this is a terrible idea

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:12.780
for us we must not vote for this proposal and then we held the vote i think it was 70 to 2

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:19.020
an anonymous vote no not anonymous i think it would have been very different if it had been

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:26.940
anonymous because i was leaving the room within 15 minutes i had three conversations where other

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:35.180
faculty members told me these are tenured faculty members only one of whom was a straight white guy

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:40.860
told me they agreed with me but could not vote their conscience in that room i totally see that

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:46.300
and i thought this is insane these are tenured faculty members there's actually nothing that

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:52.380
can happen to them here and they're safe why can't they vote their conscience my goal one of my

01:29:52.380 --> 01:30:01.100
goals is to have diversity equity race be a part of everything it's not what you do at 10 o'clock

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:07.980
on the agenda and then you move on to something else so my question we started talking about

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:16.780
attention that i feel a lot as someone is trying to work on these issues there is white fragility

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:24.140
people do and i'm thinking of faculty choose not to or choose to engage in this they make

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:35.340
that choice how do i acknowledge the horror of racism and know that if i speak at that level

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:42.620
people will leave or not engage the way that you keep them in is the is the you know i'm so

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:46.940
glad you brought that up i've heard that before can you tell me more here's how you know so that

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:51.980
kind of welcoming you them to bring it to you so that you can kind of look at it sometimes just a

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:57.020
question can be really powerful i find it very ironic that she has an amulet on her chest that

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:04.780
is empty i think it's a symbol for the emptiness that she represents and the emptiness of this

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:11.580
idea or yeah i used to i used to see that that way too and then somebody shared this and i you know

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:19.260
so you're just kind of diplomatically but the um the non-cuddling is that you're not letting it

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:25.580
stop you right and that that's the call you're not giving up or going away you're just trying

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:30.460
to figure out how to how to diplomatically keep them in and keeping them in is an interruption

01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:36.300
to what they really want to have happen the line about not being able to fire somebody over what

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:44.060
they believe struck me as really poignant um and for this institution relevant and so far as we have

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:51.980
this libertarian ethos where faculty autonomy is really privileged i can't make you agree or

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:58.620
disagree i hate to even use that language of a career disagree but nonetheless um but when you're

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:05.900
here you are required by your job to create an atmosphere in which all children can learn that

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:12.140
idea that this is trying to control people's thinking no but um not addressing these kinds of

01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:17.660
attitudes does affect people's abilities to learn that is part of your job it's it's a theoretical

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:24.300
framework just like any other theoretical framework but that's the one that where this this

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:29.020
institution stands behind and that you're going to have to grapple with right so i mean that might

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.460
be a great note to end on right so thank you so much

01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:41.020
at some point i confront she's awesome she's awesome and i've said you're remaking the college

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:44.220
you haven't left enough time in faculty meetings you're burning up all the time in

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:49.740
faculty meetings on these announcements you have to let us discuss these things and so he arranged

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:55.820
something like six meetings that were supposed to solve this problem where 20 people at a time

01:32:55.820 --> 01:33:00.380
could sign up to have a discussion with the president so the email list was the only place

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.180
left at which we could access every other member of the faculty and have a discussion

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:11.900
which is why i repeatedly went to the email list and said look we've got a problem we've got

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:17.260
authoritarianism taking over the college this intersectional stuff is dangerous and being deployed

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:25.660
in a way that's a hazard to the core values of the institution and one of the other things that

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:32.300
you said i believe uh was we keep on hearing that we are at an incredibly racist institution

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:41.100
and we have yet to hear any credible evidence for racism here on campus we have a problem with

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:48.460
racism here on campus and we have a problem with other folks not being treated the way that they

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:52.700
should be treated and this isn't going to continue on my watch

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:01.100
the field is the same or asking for a period of inertia there is a canoe

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.700
whether ever being stayed college we do diversity well you go get the nation in diversity

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.460
but one thing we're not leading the nation in is equity

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:20.300
and what that means is that some of y'all sit in these seats and some of y'all sit in these seats

01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.420
i've had experiences but it ain't been right

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.220
the cost is too high

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:37.500
and the implications are too much it's hilarious because who the hell is this

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:43.980
what life experience does he have that trumps the life experience of all the other people in the room

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:51.580
i'm sure he's not a holocaust survivor i mean who the hell is this guy he's got a pretty god damn

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:54.540
nice suit for being the victim of systemic racism

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:04.780
and at some point in time if this campus is going to stand up for what it espouses to be

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:12.460
needs to say enough is enough i established in charge trying this equity council this

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:18.220
incredible equity council with developing a plan for institutional change how do we have this

01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:23.900
footage did they really film it like this did they really film it with such high def i don't know

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:29.660
very many institutions that film with this high def you might have a camera in the back on a tripod

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:37.980
but you see what i'm saying here ladies and gentlemen systemic change that would enable

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:42.060
evergreen to acknowledge and address the equity gaps that are pervasive on our campus

01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:49.740
and i want to thank with immense gratitude is that two different camera angles for the work

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:57.260
you've invested the heartbreaking effort you have gone through and for the incredible plan

01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:00.620
you have put together please let's all give them the right

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:11.980
so what they changed to another camera there's another camera there's another there's two cameras

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:19.260
on it it was not a forum it was a celebration of the equity plan which had supposedly been

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:23.660
distributed to the faculty but wasn't actually not available to them until i emailed the faculty

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:28.940
with this document you know irony of ironies i'm the one sending out this plan and saying actually

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:37.500
y'all should read this um so the meeting occurs it is a celebration at the celebration architects

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:45.900
of the plan essentially say this plan is going to happen because it is no longer acceptable

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.860
that our mission and vision only applies to a few

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:57.260
so as we think about this plan we should be thinking about how are we unscrewing

01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:03.980
the screws and it will take many hands to do this to unscrew the structure of institutional racism

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:11.420
we have a beginning to do this and our hope is that we are inviting you and what it is is this

01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:17.660
really it's a bizarre inversion very oh i got to get my microphone i hear the rain

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:27.340
shit sorry about that i'm coming right back

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:49.580
it's a severe inversion from and it's very similar to the inversion of the protocols

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:54.940
versus the virus and i think that they've done this with a lot of things in american culture

01:37:54.940 --> 01:38:01.500
but the very gist of it is that what you're looking at is a person who hears the whole

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:09.740
of of her experience in life and what the tv and social media has done is convinced her

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:20.380
that almost this entire thing is stained exclusively by systemic racism everything contained within

01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:29.500
the experience of her life has been tainted by systemic racism tainted in a way that her own

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:36.780
input to her destiny could never overcome tainted in a way that her own actions can never overcome

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.260
tainted in a way that her choices had no effect on

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:49.420
just like people have been led to believe that if this is the total number of people that died

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:53.340
in the last three years the vast majority of them have been killed by covid

01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:03.420
it's the exact same illusion that they have gotten you to ask the wrong question how do we fix this

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:10.700
systemic racism that's held me and my people back if you're asking that question then you're

01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:15.180
not asking how you can improve yourself and improve your family and improve your day

01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:22.780
and improve your habits improve your schools and improve your communities you're asking how to fix

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:30.860
systemic racism which means you're never going to fix a lot of things in the community that need

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:38.140
fixing because you're focused on a non-problem a problem that actually has a lot more to do with

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:47.740
individual choices individual prejudices and individual experiences systemic racism is an illusion

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:55.500
it may be a factor just like wind is a factor when you drive your car down the road but you know

01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:01.500
unless the wind's blowing really hard generally speaking wind doesn't affect automobiles

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:10.060
and unless you're really weak I mean really weak sticks and stones may break my bones but

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:15.020
names will never hurt me it's gonna have to be some really loud yelling

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.900
and that's what i'm talking about here we need to stop this we need to

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:28.540
they're misleading our children with this mythology about systemic racism being more

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:34.220
important than what they do with their own lives the choices that they make the words that they

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.100
say the promises that they make and the promises that they keep

01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:47.740
rather than teaching them the stoic stoic idea of thinking about how well you did your day and

01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:51.660
making it better tomorrow let's think about how the system holds me back

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:02.140
instead of thinking about driving a car better i'm going to think about all the ways that the

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:13.020
wind is getting in my way you to come along we're going to do it don't get it twisted

01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:20.460
but we would like for you to join us on this road on this journey

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:28.700
so we invite you we want more conversation and we know there's much more work to be done

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:36.300
we invite that conversation but if you want to be an obstructionist to work on your own

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.100
she's crying

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:48.220
so the charge for them was to do something relatively small from the present and they

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:53.020
go into how we're going to start hiring in the future and how you know just they they go

01:41:53.020 --> 01:42:02.140
way beyond what it is mission and just mission leap how about yeah um and some of the things

01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:07.820
that they argue some of the things that this plan which we know that no one has seen because

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.580
it literally has not been made available even though the claim was that it was available

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:21.020
are things like from now on not just individuals hired to positions need to have an equity

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:26.060
justification but every single position itself needs to have an equity justification

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:31.820
wow which means wow how do you hire a chemist does chemistry have an equity justification

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.340
how do you hire an artist who doesn't happen to be engaged in in social justice issues

01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:43.340
that's the end of the liberal arts college so is it more important to fight the equity movement

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:49.740
at evergreen state or would it be more important to feature the fact that these other three people

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:55.660
who they're barely showing on the camera have been writing ridiculously false papers in the

01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:03.900
social sciences including gender studies and getting them published potentially cracking the

01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:13.020
narrative of gender studies and breaking this this hold that they have on academia which is the

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:18.300
the intellectual bedrock upon which this transgender movement in

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:28.460
in our society is based i find this highly disturbing that these people who are doing

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:35.500
such a courageous thing are making a movie about the wine steams and the equity issues

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:42.940
at evergreen instead of the wine steams calling attention to their attack on an entire academic

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:51.420
field or fields and how that would clean up universities around the world certainly around

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:59.100
the united states as opposed to worrying about a bunch of lame-os in in a conch in a college

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:04.460
that's in the middle of nowhere and isn't sending their graduates anywhere of consequence so who

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:12.060
cares why not feature the wonderful work of these other three people who keeps barely getting in

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:19.180
the shot who have written academic papers that are fake which have shown the gender studies as

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:26.300
a field is fake seems like a lot bigger football the spike is the end of liberal arts college right

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:31.660
there right so that is that is one of many things in this document you know i i have i have i have

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.900
my we printed it out and i have my hand scrawled like every single page like what are they doing

01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:41.420
oh my god so we're gonna do something for you today that we did as a group in in august

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:47.100
and we're going to ask for key stakeholders that are on this campus

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:57.500
to get on board our journey to equity so what i'm going to do first is ask this is the council

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:01.820
our council is large expansive and we're going and we're going to get on a canoe

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.620
okay and we're going to get on a canoe what is with the super giant necklace like what's that

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:15.740
is that a is that a cultural thing i don't know the culture that uses big giant plastic black

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:25.180
makelases it's gonna sometimes have fierce weights unbearable headwinds and sometimes

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:31.740
intentional or unintentional extra rocking of the boat because we're not on the same page or on the

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:39.900
same heartbeat the canoe was a metaphor for the journey to this magical land of what they were

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:45.580
calling equity and so the idea i mean the whole thing is almost too preposterous to believe but

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:53.260
with uh distinctly non hospitable to canoe the lady back here this lady is brilliant

01:45:53.820 --> 01:46:00.620
she's hilarious she's sharp as a knife and we should make movies about her i think i think

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:05.340
Lindsay's really cool i think this guy over here peat is also really cool and really smart

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:13.340
and i don't really know but it just is very suspicious to me that their work is being overshadowed

01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:18.860
by Brett's work in this documentary we're calling equity and so the idea i mean the whole thing is

01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:26.780
almost too preposterous to believe but with uh distinctly non hospitable to canoe shots of a rocky

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:33.180
coastline on which waves are breaking heavily and the sound of those waves breaking so if we

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:41.420
can bring this canoe forward so we can make sure it's a straight canoe if we need to have our canoe

01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:45.340
john let me know if this is not okay can there be can it be three wide

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:51.660
two wide okay so we got to make this happen i mean the whole thing didn't hang together uh visually

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:56.300
auditorily conceptually mathematically really the canoe was not well thought out

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.860
that's really it seems good it's we're sending the college down the river

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:04.780
well i mean you know i did and i must say this is very uncomfortable for me because i think if

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:09.500
there are two populations that really have an extremely strong claim in the u.s. to

01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:17.740
consistent structural oppression it's indians and africans people of african origin

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.940
yeah especially with love to come on board with the idea of you know a canoe journey to

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:28.460
somewhere but this looked like they had cloaked a freight train in the imagery of a canoe oh hold

01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:37.340
on one second um the senior administrators um you have to ask for permission and commit

01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:43.020
some things before boarding the canoe so can we step back out

01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:50.060
so uh i would like to board the crew because i'm committed to enhancing and furthering

01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:55.100
inclusion and equity campus community all school students and staff

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:58.540
faculty and to do that with compassion and kindness

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:07.980
um personally i am committed to making evergreen a more student ready campus and as a provost

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:14.140
i am committing resources help train our faculty become

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:22.700
be able to promote equity inclusion in the classroom and outside the classroom

01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.900
i carry with me the legacy of boarding schools and i carry with me the legacy

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:33.980
but wouldn't you agree then that that's weird right if james lindsey has published books

01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:40.300
and is actually working on this if that lady and pete i apologize i don't remember the other

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:45.820
lady's name are working on this and attacking it from the inside

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:52.860
i don't really understand how we're able to tell this story so well why is this story so well

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.420
produced why is there so much good footage with different angles of this stunt

01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:01.740
unless it was always intended to be a stunt

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:07.500
unless bret Weinstein might have always been intended to testify in front of the senate

01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:21.420
and to be elevated to a status of internet biology equity guy just in time for the start of a

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:32.300
uh biological crisis just in time to have his eighth podcast have sam harris on it in december

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:39.900
of 2019 for them to say that when there comes a particularly deadly pandemic we won't have time

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:49.900
for the anti-vax mentality i'm trying to show you that there is a possibility that this red thread

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:58.300
doesn't run back straight through north carolina and eco-health alliance and nih so much as it runs

01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:07.340
straight through peter teal elan musk the intellectual dark web which includes all of those people

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:15.180
and all of the people that they influence and have brought up and have have lifted out of the

01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:25.100
algorithmic fog and into prominence as podcasters teo van you know i don't know there's lots of these

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:33.100
mid-level podcasters that all pay homage all the way up to pyramid to the wine steins and rogan

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:43.260
and i'm trying to tell you that this was orchestrated and their rise to prominence

01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:48.460
around rogan was orchestrated rogan might have been spontaneous and co-opted by people like

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:57.180
brat wine stein i mean brat wine stein claimed to be the the scientific advisor to joe rogan that

01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:02.380
joe rogan calls him he said that to us in the signal chats but there's no question that

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:09.900
something is here and this high level of documentation of this stupid little po-dong college

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:18.540
and it's stupid little equity freak out in whenever this was 2016 is orchestrated

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:24.700
of adoption where's the adoption and i'm here because i refuse i think this is the sound of

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:30.140
wings that they're they're stimulating in the room it's not me and i refuse to let whiteness

01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:37.180
consume me and i'm going to say that word explicitly whiteness i refuse i refuse for my mother

01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:41.900
i refuse for her mother for my grandfather for my ancestors for my brothers and sisters my

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:51.580
relatives today i refuse i'm here and i commit the position of privilege and power i occupy as

01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:57.020
the president of this college to invest in this council its initiatives and its homes

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:06.780
is the hat authentic

01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:20.220
i'm sitting there in this room with several hundred other people and i can wow in my mind

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:24.540
almost count the people in the room who understand that something terrible is a foot

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:29.180
who understand that a this is a bizarre way to do this b it's duplicitous they've

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:33.260
they've told us that they're sharing this document they've they've told us that we're going to be

01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:38.380
able to discuss it and then they've threatened us for daring to think about questioning it and

01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:46.220
so there's a way in which sitting in that room you know i knew that heather was a couple blocks away

01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:50.300
and that she would understand this exactly as i did i knew that there was

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.220
ah i hesitate to say it but there was a dean in the room who i knew wasn't going to say anything

01:52:56.220 --> 01:53:01.820
but he knew how wrong this was and so there's a way in which you just there's a sea of people

01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:08.540
engaged in a shared delusion and then there's a few people witnessing the delusion and isolated

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:15.820
unable to exchange words or anything that sense of being alone in a crowd is profound and that

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:19.740
really was how that meeting felt in a crowd of people who are supposed to be your colleagues

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:29.020
yeah who are sleepwalking structural institutionalized inequality or racism right so an anti-racist

01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:35.100
frame understands racism as a system while individual players partake in it it's not dependent on

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:40.780
individual players right it's embedded in the fabric of the society in all the institutions

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:45.980
the norms the practices the policies the unbelievable the way that history is told

01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:51.580
and the and it functions to ensure an unequal distribution of basically everything between

01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:55.900
people of color as a whole and white people as a whole world i had started attending every

01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:02.300
faculty and going to every presentation because there were bomb shells dropped every time and

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:05.580
nobody appeared to be tracking all of it if you can just take a moment to look at this image

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.100
and look at the two different realities that these students face at the same place

01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:17.740
so for folks that are younger don't think this is some distance memory a far far long ago okay

01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:24.540
it's about us as faculty and staff but you know what it's also not about you most of the people

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:30.060
who have their mental faculties about them we're learning to avoid these things because every single

01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:34.220
one of them put you in a bind i can't emphasize this enough this is not what do you think happened

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:40.620
to Brett Weinstein when he lost his job at Evergreen State have you ever looked it up

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:47.660
was it like me where they just made him go home and live out his contract paid it out and then

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:55.900
ignored him where he could never go on and have a career and since Brett is from a poor family that

01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:01.020
doesn't even deserve a note in his is Wikipedia i guess we can assume that he got basically

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:07.020
thrown out on the street right no he settled for a half a million dollars and we don't know what

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:13.340
Heather got so just get rid of it it is not possible to avoid being socialized into a racist

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:18.300
worldview if you're white it's not possible it's coming out as 24 seven the only way to resist

01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:24.220
it is to be able to see it and think it through so to deny it is not going to help you i encourage

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:30.220
you to look them up as well marsha p johnson and sylvia ruevera their actions were initially

01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:35.740
to throw a heavy weight and a bottle at cops that's a good place oh it is very very different

01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:43.660
strategies right one is political organizing another one is uh non-traditional maybe you know

01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:52.220
more resistance more violent kind of action and also prayer three different political strategies

01:55:52.220 --> 01:56:02.300
through education violence and prayer boy them three different strategies maybe violence

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:11.660
and prayer wow entire of waiting for change to happen they forcefully took the island back

01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:19.420
and i tell this story because of first generation students first generation students of color

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:26.460
we all share similar struggles the students are taking a stand they're not powerless they're not

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:31.740
objects in the sense they're subjects in the sense they're powerful they said we're going to have

01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:38.940
these conversations one way or another and that administration still said no and then now that

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:49.100
administration ain't there anymore so we'll watch part two some other time

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:55.580
um i i don't i don't think it's not worth our time because it does get interesting at some

01:56:55.580 --> 01:57:02.780
point how the the narrative evolves um if you would like to watch Brett Weinstein and Yuri Dagan

01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:12.540
i can give you that link here um if you want to watch the original special broadcast of

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:22.540
the drastic from 2021 you can look here and if you want to see the latest jimmy door where he's

01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:30.140
having josh getsco um and john rewatching a john campbell episode you can watch it there

01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:38.060
um i really think we're making a lot of progress you know it is an illusion of consensus

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:45.100
that they have created and it is the illusion of consensus that we need to get rid of or get

01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:52.700
get back from um and so i don't think you can us to underestimate the importance of cracking

01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:59.740
this illusion of consensus because the illusion of consensus is everything a consensus that vaccines

01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:06.220
are great a consensus that the mRNA it was rushed but it would otherwise have worked even better

01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:12.300
a consensus that it's likely a lab leak and they lied about it and the lying about it was actually

01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:18.380
the best evidence and that because they lied about it was likely gain a function and so it

01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:25.500
will come again and of course by accepting that you're also accepting that we don't always know

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:29.100
how to treat a respiratory disease and doctors don't always know what will work

01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:36.460
and that there can be a new cause of death that arrives on the scene and and and sweeps the world

01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:43.340
like a fog but we don't need to look at all cause mortality to see it we don't need to learn how the

01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:48.540
rest uh the immune system works because it's just antibodies and that's the same way that vaccines

01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:55.820
work and by misleading our kids about these stupid with this stupid biological principles

01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.980
our kids may never come to realize that the vast majority of people that were killed between

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:11.660
2020 and 2023 were killed by protocols and by the transfection rather than by a dangerous novel

01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:15.340
virus that was released from a laboratory in Rulon and circulated the globe for three years

01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:20.300
but they're growing up thinking that because that's what the universities tell them that's

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:24.700
what the university professors tell them that's what 60 minutes tells them that's what the tv tells

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:29.500
them that's the only stuff that facebook allows and that's what tiktok tells them

01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:33.020
tiktok even tells them that their government's responsible for it

01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:43.500
and so they have misled our young they have misled us and a planet about the potential for

01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:48.860
pandemics and they have misled us by an illusion of consensus nobody disagrees with it even the

01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:58.460
dissidents don't disagree and that's what allowed them to get us to focus on solving the mystery

01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:05.100
of the Batcave zoneosis instead of considering the fact that we know nothing about the background

02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:12.780
signal that this would have found had we rolled out this suite of tests in 2019 and it gets you

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:18.460
distracted from the fact that an endemic coronavirus signal with a PCR test that could find it would

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:23.900
have been enough to roll out deadly protocols and justify the rollout of a

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:31.100
transfection across the world they also could have released released an infectious clone to see that

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:38.300
very sequence around the world and then use that background coronavirus and that non-specific

02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:42.700
PCR test to perpetuate it so that they could justify the use of protocols that were murder

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:48.540
and roll out a transfection that wasn't medicine it could have been a transfection agent done

02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:54.540
for the same reasons again no virus doesn't make any sense because we know that there are lots

02:00:54.540 --> 02:01:01.020
of molecular techniques that could and will transfect can be aerosolized can be applied

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:07.420
and we do know that infectious clones are real coronavirus is not being might not be all

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.940
they're cracked up to be many viruses might not be all they're cracked up to be that's very

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:13.020
different than there are no viruses at all

02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:21.180
protocols were murder transfection is not medicine they led us to believe something by

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:26.540
getting us to disregard the old cause mortality to accept a test there wasn't really a test

02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:31.580
and to ignore the financial incentives that applied that test they don't want you to think

02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:36.380
about infectious clones is the only way that they can really use RNA against you because they want

02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:42.460
to invert your rights into privileges and they want you to ask for permission for everything

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:47.500
and more importantly they want your kid to ask permission for everything including can I have

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:54.620
my medical data back ladies and gentlemen if you'd like to follow me or communicate with me you can

02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:58.940
do that at giggle and biological.com if you scroll down from the front page you can subscribe

02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:04.300
and get a notice of when I go on and also occasionally an email which really

02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:08.140
is kind of falling dead since I've done my everyday streams where we're going to get

02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:12.940
there eventually I'm just building the stream and building the steam if you want to communicate

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:17.260
we also have this thing that's kind of like twitter but it's not just have to put your email in and

02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:21.820
then you can start chatting with us there you can read everything without without registering

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:26.620
and if you want to support with a one-time donation you can do that at the front page as well

02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:32.220
but that's not necessary the best thing to do would be to share my work so post it everywhere you can

02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:37.340
take a screenshot of this particular shot to make sure that everybody understands this is the main

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:42.220
message intramuscular injection or any combination of substances meant to augment the immune system

02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:47.260
is dumb and if you want to say it's short and sweet for the current set then just say

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:52.300
transfection is not immunization and we need to stop all of that transfection stuff because they

02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:59.820
are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary thanks very much for joining me

02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:05.260
guys don't forget about the broken science initiative I have a lot of really cool

02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:12.060
I went fast a lot of really cool podcasts and little shorts and Emily's put together so

02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:16.380
check them out this has been ging on biological see you guys again tomorrow night boy I'm hungry

02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:20.380
and thirsty whoa

02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:55.500
so

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:44.060
You
