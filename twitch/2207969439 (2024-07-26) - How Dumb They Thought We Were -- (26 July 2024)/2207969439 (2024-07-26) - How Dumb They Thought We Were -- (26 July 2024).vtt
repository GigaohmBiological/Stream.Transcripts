WEBVTT

00:36.547 --> 00:55.075
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones, you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

00:55.355 --> 00:57.356
It's just a big hassle in the end.

00:57.956 --> 01:03.499
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75%

01:05.003 --> 01:13.669
mortality, and there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

01:13.729 --> 01:16.231
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

01:19.431 --> 01:38.003
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

01:39.084 --> 01:47.550
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment

01:49.713 --> 01:51.274
I think truth is good for kids.

01:51.694 --> 01:55.496
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

01:55.996 --> 01:57.617
We want everybody to feel good.

01:57.637 --> 01:59.998
That's not the way life is.

02:02.519 --> 02:04.020
But you can tell if someone's lying.

02:04.660 --> 02:06.441
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:08.221 --> 02:08.962
And I have lied.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.002
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:10.022 --> 02:10.963
I don't want to lie.

02:11.443 --> 02:12.784
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

02:12.884 --> 02:13.944
I try not to be a liar.

02:13.964 --> 02:14.804
I don't want to be a liar.

02:15.365 --> 02:18.086
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

02:20.458 --> 02:23.599
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.920
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

02:27.881 --> 02:28.641
Isolation, what was it?

02:28.801 --> 02:29.922
Isolation and purification.

02:31.743 --> 02:32.463
Of the virus?

02:32.563 --> 02:32.743
Yes.

02:34.004 --> 02:35.784
Well, you isolate a virus by

02:42.586 --> 03:04.828
finding the virus which causes a disease you purify a virus by making a lot of I mean just by purifying it so you get a pure virus I don't understand what the issue they interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different no it depends on how they used it can you explain the process of HIV isolation

03:08.032 --> 03:09.993
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

03:10.054 --> 03:11.895
I mean, he actually isolated it.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.098
I mean, why should I do all of this?

03:16.178 --> 03:18.220
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

03:23.183 --> 03:24.844
It's literally turning into a worst-case scenario.

03:24.864 --> 03:28.287
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with, essentially, a worst-case scenario.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.110
He is the life of parties he has never attended.

03:43.312 --> 03:47.375
If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.

03:47.395 --> 03:51.298
When in Rome, they do as he does.

03:52.940 --> 03:55.822
He is the most interesting man in the world.

03:58.444 --> 04:04.229
I don't always ruin things, but when I do, I prefer the great reset.

04:05.270 --> 04:06.491
Stay awake, my friends.

04:24.537 --> 04:25.772
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.212
That system is our enemy.

04:29.692 --> 04:32.193
But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see?

04:32.273 --> 04:39.055
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save.

04:39.456 --> 04:44.437
But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.

04:44.617 --> 04:49.079
You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

04:49.899 --> 04:56.002
And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

04:58.473 --> 04:59.594
Were you listening to me, Neo?

05:00.514 --> 05:02.035
Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?

05:02.756 --> 05:03.637
I was... Look again.

05:05.518 --> 05:05.878
Freeze it.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.904
This... This isn't the Matrix.

05:14.124 --> 05:14.344
No.

05:16.565 --> 05:18.927
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.110
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.638
It's a real commercial with really Robert Malone.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.839
It's not AI.

05:32.540 --> 05:38.065
It's a commercial that was made by Mickey Willis for the movie Pandemic 3 or Plandemic 3.

05:38.766 --> 05:45.372
It is a real commercial that Robert Malone really sat in and cameras were really used to make.

05:46.373 --> 05:49.196
Do not see it any other way.

05:49.376 --> 05:49.877
It's real.

06:00.765 --> 06:00.926
you

08:59.400 --> 08:59.520
you

10:19.973 --> 10:22.394
I don't know.

10:46.957 --> 10:47.117
The.

11:14.249 --> 11:15.250
That was fantastic.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.831
Did you hear that little tempo change at the beginning there?

11:20.532 --> 11:22.073
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

11:22.093 --> 11:22.714
It's Friday.

11:22.774 --> 11:23.434
Thank goodness.

11:23.714 --> 11:24.454
Oh my gosh.

11:26.235 --> 11:29.877
I definitely need to take my scheduled Saturday off tomorrow.

11:32.779 --> 11:36.901
Not whining, just saying, I think this week has been a lot of work.

11:37.001 --> 11:38.861
I think we've earned a day off.

11:39.002 --> 11:50.666
Sunday, we're going to come back strong with a introductory biology lesson for everybody as a leaping off point for the coursework we're going to try and do.

11:51.347 --> 11:58.509
And so Sunday afternoon biology will be very fun, an exciting way to start the second half of the summer.

12:00.330 --> 12:17.414
And so today I'm just going to clean up a little bit with one more of these, trying to get people across the finish line of understanding how these people have taken what has been perceived to be true and misconstrued it with what is true and vice versa.

12:17.674 --> 12:21.835
And that's why our consciousness remains prime real estate.

12:22.115 --> 12:25.296
I'm afraid the bad news is we got to get off social media.

12:26.257 --> 12:37.192
Because as long as we stay on social media, we're never going to usefully spread the word about the fact that there's no epidemiological evidence of a gain-of-function pandemic.

12:39.186 --> 12:48.370
If we don't get off social media, we're never going to have any useful discussions about what infectious clones as a term mean to virology, especially RNA virology.

12:49.151 --> 13:02.917
We're never going to get to the stage where we're talking about how easily, I mean easily, placebo batches could have been used and could even be used in the current vaccine schedule in order to make sure that nobody becomes aware of the scam.

13:03.397 --> 13:07.639
I mean, aren't placebos also much easier and cheaper to sell and make?

13:08.995 --> 13:11.376
I think there's just a lot of things we haven't thought about.

13:12.697 --> 13:14.658
And, wow, is that a weird sentence?

13:14.778 --> 13:17.579
I think there are a lot of things we have not thought about.

13:18.760 --> 13:36.929
Transfection in healthy mammals is something that we haven't really thought about before the pandemic as anything other than, you know, something appropriate for a lab in an animal you're going to sacrifice, but not in a healthy child or a grandmother that you want to be around for five more Christmases.

13:38.314 --> 13:42.336
Um, not for a grandmother that you want to be at everybody's graduation.

13:43.636 --> 13:47.198
And yet here we are where not only that, but the protocols were murdered.

13:47.238 --> 13:48.699
Gain of function is a mythology.

13:48.739 --> 13:50.039
They want us to teach our kids.

13:50.639 --> 13:53.321
They've scared our grandparents into teaching us.

13:54.321 --> 13:58.143
And, uh, that scooby-doo about the laboratory leak, that's the real deal.

13:58.183 --> 14:07.447
That's the, that's the military exercise that Robert Malone and his minions were designed to make sure that we stayed right in the rails, right on the rails.

14:09.159 --> 14:36.385
And the way to understand it from a 30,000-foot perspective is to see that weaponized piles of money, big private piles of money, big corporate piles of money, and probably a lot of others that we are not aware of, like even military piles of money, have been used to convince us to argue about the origins of the novel virus, that we were living through something that needed solving, a mystery, if you will.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.307
And participating in that argument accepted the premise.

14:40.367 --> 14:44.333
And that premise is now a story that we're teaching our kids, still arguing about it.

14:45.354 --> 14:50.261
And this is going to permanently enslave our grandkids if we don't watch out.

14:50.381 --> 14:52.244
University endowments, indeed.

14:54.616 --> 14:56.537
It's amazing where we are at this stage.

14:58.097 --> 15:03.859
Twitter has basically stopped being a useful place anymore because the narrative is way off the rails.

15:04.720 --> 15:11.182
The clock has run out, or the clock has not run out rather, but the narrative has kind of run out of tricks.

15:13.003 --> 15:21.086
And I don't know what they're going to do once the weaponized piles of money become useless or transition into this new system.

15:23.550 --> 15:29.412
I think there's going to be a lot of checking out that's going to be necessary in order for this to get pulled off and whatever they're planning on doing.

15:29.432 --> 15:31.132
I just don't, I don't understand anymore.

15:31.152 --> 15:32.172
I don't think they can make it.

15:32.292 --> 15:41.795
I don't think it can happen because too many people can see and many, many, many more are about to see when they are shown.

15:41.855 --> 15:42.615
That's what I think.

15:43.335 --> 15:46.516
If you guys stay vigilant and keep sharing this work, I think

15:47.472 --> 15:57.237
I think we can actually get across the finish line this summer with a lot of people because they've been telling this story about what they're going to do and when they're going to do it in 10 years from now.

15:57.978 --> 16:08.023
As soon as it becomes a little cheaper, as soon as the computers are a little more inexpensive or a little faster, this is all one continuous mythology that started way back when.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.125
You saw the face there, you see the face there.

16:11.237 --> 16:15.261
It started way back when, 40 years ago or more.

16:15.962 --> 16:19.325
That's why Tony Fauci was hired and never fired.

16:20.907 --> 16:24.470
Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.

16:24.510 --> 16:25.231
So why fire him?

16:27.102 --> 16:30.603
Why would you fire a guy who's so good at his job?

16:30.663 --> 16:34.465
Why would you fire him when he's got so many people that have trained with him?

16:35.385 --> 16:45.009
So many people that trained under the illusion of HIV and what it was and how it's isolated and how it's found and how to test for it and what PCRs work for it.

16:46.150 --> 16:49.791
Don't you understand how many of these people have gone through the temple of HIV?

16:49.831 --> 16:56.114
We looked at, we saw it on the beginning of Jessica Rose's CV yesterday.

16:58.376 --> 16:59.356
That's extraordinary.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.338
And so the charlatan list is the only list we need to make.

17:03.638 --> 17:18.024
There's an illusion being pulled on us, ladies and gentlemen, an illusion that is sustained throughout history because of a certain moment in our history and how they've forever after that basically been in control of the narrative.

17:18.084 --> 17:18.484
That's the

17:19.304 --> 17:24.988
The wave of consensus that we're now being subject to on social media, though, is something like it's never been seen before.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.450
There is no precedence for this in history.

17:28.510 --> 17:40.478
The ability to control the narrative, or even worse, produce the narrative, which is what this artificial wave going away from the shallow water represents as this kid learns to safely surf.

17:44.332 --> 17:51.478
We need to teach our kids to safely surf this illusion of consensus on the internet or get them off.

17:51.538 --> 17:57.842
And I would prefer to get them off, but I don't know how... I don't know how... I don't know how...

17:59.329 --> 18:00.429
how realistic that is.

18:00.489 --> 18:26.400
I think we gotta get them to exercise their informed consent and choose to get off by staying focused on the biology and teaching it to them, by staying focused on not taking the bait on social media, the kind of stories and hamster wheels that we need to get into and focus on our local communities and school boards, our neighbors,

18:28.157 --> 18:32.579
My neighbor brought me over eggplant parmesan yesterday.

18:32.639 --> 18:33.039
Hello!

18:35.620 --> 18:36.900
That was pretty spectacular.

18:38.761 --> 18:40.701
I guess my sound effects went out.

18:41.502 --> 18:43.722
So I gotta move this down over here.

18:44.603 --> 18:45.743
Get those up there.

18:45.763 --> 18:50.905
I wanted to say I got eggplant parmesan yesterday.

18:53.311 --> 18:54.472
And that was very tasty.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.933
There's still one third of it left.

18:55.973 --> 18:58.394
You're not going to believe how big that dish was she brought over.

19:00.295 --> 19:01.716
I'm really happy everybody's here.

19:01.736 --> 19:04.778
52 viewers, holy cow.

19:06.099 --> 19:07.900
Yeah, it was really good eggplant parm.

19:09.710 --> 19:10.831
My wife doesn't make it.

19:10.891 --> 19:13.292
It's not because she wouldn't eat it or because she can't.

19:13.412 --> 19:18.236
It's more because I think she's worried that the rest of the crew would whine about it.

19:18.356 --> 19:26.481
And given the amount of work it requires, well, anyway, she was also very jealous when I sent her the picture of the food.

19:27.522 --> 19:33.345
I'm going to fade this music out in hopes that we won't get too much of a bump there.

19:33.826 --> 19:36.828
And we're looking for a paradigm shift, ladies and gentlemen.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.089
We're hoping that we can

19:39.136 --> 19:44.457
make something happen in the next couple weeks and months as we try to push this forward.

19:44.517 --> 19:54.360
So if you were at all interested in helping share this work and interested in helping people engage in United Noncompliance, now is the time.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.440
Now is the time to get a little crazy with it.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.442
Get a cup of coffee, sit in front of Twitter and just repost, post things.

20:02.582 --> 20:04.302
You could just take, you know,

20:06.400 --> 20:13.502
five videos from my website and post them on Twitter or post them on Facebook and just leave them there and have that be your thing.

20:14.582 --> 20:24.245
GigaOM Biological right now, more than anything, needs you to share this work because I think if we get it out, people are going to convert and convert fast.

20:45.693 --> 20:49.655
Welcome to the show ladies and gentlemen it is the 26th of July 2024 and I can't believe

20:54.158 --> 20:54.999
we are still here.

20:55.079 --> 21:07.688
On the other hand, I'm very humbled that I'm still here and able to do this with some capacity every day, mostly because of people who watch this show and those of you that share it.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.751
GigaOM Biological is brought to you by a biologist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.553
That's in the USA, the United States of America.

21:15.573 --> 21:17.275
It is a message primarily intended

21:17.955 --> 21:29.283
for all free humans on the planet but especially Americans because we are indeed in a unique trap and we have a very unique constitution that we should defend insofar as it is defendable.

21:29.303 --> 21:34.067
I am a human just like you and I do believe that the biology is the way out

21:35.267 --> 21:36.508
I also think you should pray.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.891
I also think that you should connect with your family.

21:39.911 --> 21:53.561
And I also think that you should try to understand this set of truths as best you can from all angles so that you can try to explain it to anyone who happens to bring up one aspect of it.

21:54.462 --> 21:55.723
It's really worthwhile.

21:56.403 --> 22:11.165
to start to realize that from the PBS NewsHour all the way to the craziest and fringiest people that have risen beyond 10,000 followers, you can rest assured that these people and these entities and these sort of

22:13.220 --> 22:15.581
personalities are all there for a reason.

22:15.621 --> 22:18.542
They're all there because they are part of the way that we are governed.

22:19.763 --> 22:26.545
And this stems back to statements made already in the 1920s by people like Edward Bernays.

22:27.466 --> 22:32.448
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

22:32.988 --> 22:38.711
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and RNA cannot pandemic.

22:39.651 --> 22:50.857
Viruses are not pattern integrities is another way to think about that, and that'll come into play as we move forward in the coming weeks with this sort of general idea of how to think about general biology.

22:51.477 --> 22:52.278
in a different way.

22:53.258 --> 22:58.082
So they've created the illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

22:58.642 --> 23:17.355
Yesterday, one of the things that I showed you was this video from early 2021, or maybe it's the second, like August 21, July of 21, of Li Min Yan talking about the one-year anniversary of the Federation of China or something like this.

23:19.286 --> 23:21.148
It's extraordinary for a number of reasons.

23:21.188 --> 23:27.733
I'm going to play another small segment of it here before moving on, but rest assured or not, that's not the right phrase.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.556
Please be aware that that.

23:32.552 --> 23:44.107
Mark Hucytonic, Mark Kulak, Hucytonic ITS, has done some fantastic work trying to look at the background of Li Mingyan.

23:44.247 --> 23:51.035
And as far as we can tell, as far as he can tell, it looks like she's married to a Sri Lankan man.

23:52.176 --> 24:05.597
who may even have a job currently in Philadelphia, who has a lot of NIH funding and a history of working on, let's say, the more interesting coronaviruses in Tony Fauci's repertoire or resume.

24:08.357 --> 24:27.453
And so it's a very, very curious situation that we're in because while we were offered Lee Minyan as someone who is a virologist with the credentials necessary to be touted by Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and Rudy Giuliani and Peter Navarro,

24:29.881 --> 24:41.228
Yeah, she's just basically the wife of an NIH scientist, the wife of an NIH virologist, and the wife of an NIH pandemic virologist.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.329
It's extraordinary.

24:44.130 --> 24:51.914
If Mark's data, Mark's information is correct, which I mean, somebody would say it wasn't, right?

24:51.974 --> 24:59.359
I mean, then we're really at an inflection point because then all of these people are frauds.

25:00.820 --> 25:23.151
all of them it is one gigantic show if it turns out to be what mark has reported in the last couple shows is even remotely related to reality so i'm gonna switch back down over here and then play this video hey what the heck

25:27.776 --> 25:28.556
Why didn't that play?

25:28.697 --> 25:29.817
Oh, I know what's wrong.

25:29.877 --> 25:34.320
We're having a little memory malfunction here.

25:35.841 --> 25:38.543
When you have big slide decks.

25:40.143 --> 25:44.466
We have to get her citizenship because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

25:46.828 --> 25:47.568
Thank you.

25:48.689 --> 25:49.329
Thank you.

25:49.389 --> 25:50.530
Thank you, everyone.

25:50.910 --> 25:53.992
I cannot name all the people who helped me.

25:54.532 --> 25:55.553
Mayor Rudy.

25:56.693 --> 25:57.573
What did he say?

25:57.593 --> 26:03.756
We have to get her citizenship, because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

26:06.117 --> 26:06.838
Thank you.

26:07.978 --> 26:08.619
Thank you.

26:08.699 --> 26:09.819
Thank you, everyone.

26:10.199 --> 26:13.321
I cannot name all the people who helped me.

26:13.821 --> 26:22.065
Mayor Rudy, Mr. Bannon, Dr. Navarro, Mr. Bilkert, all the people, our honored guests, the Morgan family,

26:22.361 --> 26:37.433
Mr. Bill Gertz is a guy who interviewed me in 2020 and actually quoted me in the Washington Times right underneath Tony Fauci.

26:37.513 --> 26:41.596
The quote from me was from an email that I sent to him in reply to his questions.

26:43.877 --> 26:48.081
His quote from Tony Fauci was, of course, Tony Fauci's press quote.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.743
And that got me some very

26:52.141 --> 27:00.217
bad attention from the faculty and from the corporation that owns the hospital that works for or works with the University of Pittsburgh.

27:00.902 --> 27:07.423
That's when I got the email from their media department saying, we've seen your YouTube channel.

27:07.523 --> 27:10.504
If the newspapers call you, don't talk to them again.

27:11.384 --> 27:14.585
So this is interesting that she mentions Bill Gertz.

27:14.705 --> 27:19.726
I guess Bill Gertz is the guy who did an article about her or something like that.

27:20.446 --> 27:22.306
Honored guest, the Morgan family.

27:23.367 --> 27:24.567
I'll reel it back a little bit.

27:25.888 --> 27:29.049
I cannot name all the people who helped me.

27:29.510 --> 27:42.457
Mayor Rudy, Mr. Bannon, Dr. Navarro, Mr. Bilkos, all the people, our honored guests, the Morgan family, all the people, Raheem, Natalia, young but beautiful, but talented.

27:43.266 --> 27:44.347
Yeah, all the people.

27:44.367 --> 27:45.747
I appreciate everyone.

27:45.807 --> 27:48.068
I appreciate everyone here without your effort.

27:48.428 --> 27:49.969
We can never do this.

27:50.229 --> 27:58.933
China, try to despair us, not only from physics, but also to silence us once you are treated as nuts.

27:59.273 --> 28:00.654
You are treated as liars.

28:00.994 --> 28:05.555
Once they ruin your reputation, your words cannot be heard.

28:05.835 --> 28:07.976
That's also another type of silence.

28:08.336 --> 28:09.296
So we need to fight.

28:09.316 --> 28:12.618
We need to stand out, bravely tell people, you cannot win.

28:12.878 --> 28:13.898
We are winning.

28:14.278 --> 28:16.839
And one more word, no vaccine passport.

28:17.159 --> 28:18.620
We need a safe vaccine.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.901
And the vaccine cannot overcome bio warfare.

28:25.586 --> 28:30.487
We need a safe vaccine, but a vaccine cannot overcome bio-warfare.

28:30.687 --> 28:31.247
Thank you.

28:31.547 --> 28:31.887
What?

28:38.529 --> 28:39.849
No vaccine passport.

28:40.189 --> 28:44.210
We need a safe vaccine, and the vaccine cannot overcome bio-warfare.

28:44.470 --> 28:44.930
Thank you.

28:56.476 --> 28:58.137
That's pretty extraordinary, don't you think?

28:58.297 --> 29:01.018
I mean, so.

29:01.799 --> 29:06.101
We have to get her citizenship because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

29:06.661 --> 29:06.881
What?

29:08.302 --> 29:09.623
Oh, I know what's going on here.

29:09.663 --> 29:10.783
OK, I got to escape again.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.844
I made a error on this slide.

29:12.924 --> 29:14.805
I didn't get rid of this behind here.

29:15.586 --> 29:20.908
So I thought that I would start today with a little fun before we go too far.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.590
Now, this fun does have some swearing in it.

29:24.757 --> 29:26.838
Um, and I'm not going to go too long with it.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.420
Um, and not too deep into it.

29:30.440 --> 29:35.763
Uh, but I just want you to see kind of how, what extraordinary place we are in.

29:36.343 --> 29:41.006
Um, because it is a very extraordinary place.

29:42.647 --> 29:46.509
Um, maybe I should just preface this first.

29:47.069 --> 29:48.490
Uh, let me just preface this first.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.711
I didn't know I was going to go here and then suddenly I'm here.

29:52.092 --> 29:52.192
Um,

29:55.990 --> 29:56.691
Where do I start?

29:56.811 --> 30:19.368
My boys play a game called Ark and Ark is a very strange game because it involves high-definition graphics that kind of have an engine that's similar to Minecraft in the sense that you have to cut trees down and you have to, you know, you can get stuff, resources, and then build things with them or whatever.

30:20.347 --> 30:28.694
In this game you can tame animals and there's blood and it's stupid and my wife and I had a lot of trouble with it for a long time.

30:32.357 --> 30:38.882
ARK is a game where there are all kinds of prehistoric animals that are represented as known.

30:40.199 --> 30:41.840
They have scientific names.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.161
They're not like, you know, big hairy one, big hairy two.

30:45.721 --> 30:53.324
They have like Latin names that, that populate this very, you know, populated ecosystem.

30:53.364 --> 31:01.126
There potentially could be hundreds, if not maybe even a couple thousand species.

31:01.186 --> 31:01.566
I don't know.

31:01.867 --> 31:07.589
I'd have to ask somebody who knows more about the game, but the point is, is that a, a level of, of

31:09.304 --> 31:15.928
fidelity and understanding and how much we've dedicated to naming these things is really extraordinary in that game.

31:16.969 --> 31:32.298
And I find it also strange that dinosaurs, for example, there's no, there aren't really any serious university departments that study dinosaurs.

31:32.478 --> 31:37.501
And, and Brett Weinstein, when he talks about evolution is never talking about the fossil record.

31:40.103 --> 31:53.946
And so I just wanted to start with something funny and fun, not to debate whether or not dinosaurs are real, although I am a biologist, and at some point in time, I'm gonna be very tempted to tackle that as succinctly as possible.

31:53.966 --> 32:02.648
I think there's a lot of reading and listening to do before I do that, and it's not a priority.

32:04.875 --> 32:06.557
But I think it's a very funny topic.

32:06.697 --> 32:12.845
And so it was recently covered on Joe Rogan by a guy who purports to be a dinosaur hunter.

32:13.406 --> 32:19.774
So we're going to listen to a guy who is a dinosaur bone hunter collector.

32:21.138 --> 32:43.210
paleontologist if you will and he's going to debunk a YouTube video that Jamie's gonna play for Joe and and this dude and it's it's hysterical because he's got a yellow beard and he's got a shirt on that has some kind of spaghetti monster or something on it and

32:44.474 --> 32:45.955
It's a pretty extraordinary video.

32:45.975 --> 32:48.577
So just, we'll see how long we can tolerate it.

32:48.617 --> 32:58.484
Just for five minutes, just to kind of clear our minds before we turn our heads back to seriousness.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.405
But this is kind of serious, right?

33:00.445 --> 33:02.587
Because this is where

33:06.741 --> 33:08.441
Well, I hope I'm not using too much time.

33:08.521 --> 33:10.722
This is where the narrative is created.

33:10.762 --> 33:16.943
This is the fifth generation warfare and what is going to happen here, maybe it's too much of a preface, but I got to say it.

33:17.464 --> 33:21.184
What's going to happen here is they're going to watch a video and debunk it.

33:21.865 --> 33:34.188
And while they're doing it, Joe Rogan is going to complain about why it is that if anybody can, if anybody can make a YouTube video and sound smart, then anybody can make a YouTube video and sound smart.

33:34.208 --> 33:35.488
And that's really dangerous.

33:37.233 --> 34:03.164
then they agree on it and then they proceed to debunk it and so the illusion of consensus that's created by this incredibly over-the-top video that's like 30 minutes long that we're only gonna watch like five or ten minutes of the illusion of consensus is is that bad YouTube content made by people with bad intentions is

34:04.414 --> 34:09.856
can be dangerous because, you know, they could make people believe that there are no dinosaurs when there are dinosaurs.

34:09.916 --> 34:13.197
And, oh my gosh, imagine the consequences of that.

34:13.257 --> 34:19.339
If you convince somebody that there were no dinosaurs, the whole world, I mean, once that got out, the whole world would collapse.

34:22.489 --> 34:42.871
And so that, this is really extraordinary because instead of talking about how Joe and this character can work together to create the illusion of that Joe and his guests work together to create the illusion of consensus about what questions are smart to ask and what answers are the right ones to debate about.

34:45.615 --> 34:57.585
They purport to dance around, they dance together saying that, you know, people that make YouTube videos are dangerous because, you know, if you sound smart enough, you'll get away with it and people will believe you.

35:00.728 --> 35:03.150
And so we've got to kind of do the opposite, I think.

35:03.210 --> 35:10.375
That's kind of my idea in terms of how to get back to YouTube in a way that is meaningful and useful.

35:10.835 --> 35:14.258
And yeah, anyway, let's do this.

35:14.338 --> 35:16.939
I hope I just didn't blow it and I lost a bunch of viewers now.

35:18.060 --> 35:19.101
Current slide, here we are.

35:21.403 --> 35:21.924
Hello.

35:23.125 --> 35:24.247
Hey, don't have to swear.

35:24.267 --> 35:26.249
The dinosaurs are not real video.

35:26.710 --> 35:27.370
Just do it.

35:27.410 --> 35:34.038
God, see if we probably can't play it on YouTube or we'll get pulled, but we can play the audio, right?

35:34.819 --> 35:35.340
Play the audio.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.983
We'll put the video up on the screen and play the audio for you.

35:38.043 --> 35:40.707
And you could just fucking your head could turn beet red.

35:41.227 --> 35:42.588
Smoke's gonna come out of your ears.

35:43.009 --> 35:49.394
Because the thing is about these videos, and this is the issue that I have with not just videos, but also with blogs.

35:50.955 --> 35:55.980
People, you're writing things and you're not being checked as you're going along.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.122
So it's just you broadcasting an idea.

35:59.142 --> 36:00.243
It's not a conversation.

36:00.443 --> 36:05.267
And because of that, you can give off the illusion of expertise without being checked.

36:05.408 --> 36:07.429
Here it goes, dinosaurs never existed.

36:07.770 --> 36:09.091
And by the way- Oh my God, Eric Dubé?

36:09.651 --> 36:24.597
this is the flat earth guy yeah the guy that does 200 proofs the earth is flat that everybody has debunked fucking a thousand no no no shills okay so first of all already they're playing one card right

36:25.077 --> 36:28.919
And we've talked about this card before, but I want to point it out very clearly.

36:28.959 --> 36:34.361
The flat earth idea is often used as an anchor or a weight.

36:34.621 --> 36:41.024
In other words, you know, you can't swim if you believe in flat earth, then everything else is over.

36:41.124 --> 36:45.226
And to a certain extent, I think that's how some of these ideas are used.

36:47.106 --> 36:50.528
And it's more or less kind of the same

36:52.677 --> 36:59.641
It's more or less kind of the same idea of me saying that David Icke is somebody that they've used for many, many, many years.

37:00.781 --> 37:02.482
They have to have one person out there.

37:02.542 --> 37:05.844
And that's why he says things like they're all really lizards.

37:06.784 --> 37:19.711
Because if he didn't say things like UFOs and lizards and this kind of stuff, then his, you know, the real stuff that he talks about, how these people are working against us and how they do it would be

37:21.977 --> 37:23.418
would be undiscreditable.

37:24.358 --> 37:25.979
It would be undeniable then.

37:26.099 --> 37:29.801
But this makes it very easy to deny this guy in theory, right?

37:29.861 --> 37:34.083
Oh yeah, but he's a flat earther, so what he says about dinosaurs can't possibly be real.

37:34.844 --> 37:35.924
Oh, okay.

37:36.544 --> 37:38.505
Well then that clears everything up here.

37:38.565 --> 37:41.227
You see, so already they're kind of starting something funny.

37:42.327 --> 37:44.929
Listen to this guy.

37:45.069 --> 37:54.595
Don't you dare mention Owen's name, you asshole.

37:54.895 --> 38:01.099
The next thing you should see is the thing on his hand, because that's really strange to me, and I'll tell you why.

38:01.159 --> 38:03.740
Because he's on the Joe Rogan program.

38:05.101 --> 38:08.643
You know, like this for most people would be like, what?

38:10.379 --> 38:15.503
more exposure than you're ever gonna get in your life again, and an hour of it.

38:16.524 --> 38:28.854
So how is it possible that he's so tired that he decides to lean not on the top knuckles like this, but on the secondary knuckles like this?

38:28.974 --> 38:31.216
Like who even leans like that?

38:31.316 --> 38:36.800
And why would you show so much disinterest in being on the show?

38:36.860 --> 38:38.542
Why would you show, oh, I'm so tired?

38:39.636 --> 38:43.158
Why would you ever take the posture like this?

38:48.721 --> 38:51.282
To me, it's obvious that there's something else happening here.

38:51.302 --> 38:52.062
I don't know what that is.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.303
Is that a three?

38:53.903 --> 38:56.345
Is that a pyramid there?

38:56.465 --> 38:57.685
Something silly like that?

38:57.745 --> 38:58.946
I don't know, but it's just dumb.

39:00.683 --> 39:01.363
It's just dumb.

39:02.104 --> 39:03.265
Maybe it's just to confuse us.

39:03.365 --> 39:07.307
Writing things, and you're not being checked as you're going along.

39:07.407 --> 39:10.449
So it's just you broadcasting an idea.

39:10.469 --> 39:11.570
It's not a conversation.

39:11.770 --> 39:16.593
And because of that, you can give off the illusion of expertise without being checked.

39:16.733 --> 39:17.173
Here it goes.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.754
Dinosaurs never existed.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.676
And by the way- Oh my god, Eric Dubé?

39:20.696 --> 39:22.377
This is the flat earth guy.

39:22.397 --> 39:24.818
Yeah, the guy that does 200 proofs the earth is flat.

39:26.620 --> 39:33.187
Everybody has debunked fucking Shills are listen to this guy Don't you dare mention Owens name you asshole in 1842

39:42.337 --> 39:59.829
Or, in other words, the existence of dinosaurs was first speculatively hypothesized by a knighted museum head coincidentally in the mid-19th century during the heyday of evolutionism before a single dinosaur fossil had ever been found.

40:00.009 --> 40:00.409
Wrong.

40:00.429 --> 40:01.951
Pause.

40:02.051 --> 40:02.671
Pause.

40:02.711 --> 40:03.031
Pause.

40:03.111 --> 40:03.892
Every time, pause.

40:04.692 --> 40:28.242
uh dinosaurs uh we we discovered marine reptiles and the first dinosaurs about a century before that so that right there eric you're fucking wrong so three or four times like don't bring your flat earth bullshit into my profession now my profession this guy's got a profession with a yellow beard and a hockey jersey with some kind of

40:29.085 --> 40:32.487
Some kind of, I don't know what that is like squid monster there.

40:32.527 --> 40:33.568
I can't really read that.

40:33.588 --> 40:35.369
I've tried to read it a couple of different times.

40:36.369 --> 40:38.971
Um, I just find it extraordinary.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.332
I find it absolutely extraordinary.

40:41.372 --> 40:47.596
Now, remember what I'm trying to show you is that you don't, we don't, they're misleading the young.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.558
They're misleading people under 30.

40:52.830 --> 41:00.913
And maybe only half of the population of the people under 30, or maybe only half of the people in America and two thirds of the people outside of America.

41:00.973 --> 41:01.433
I don't know.

41:04.074 --> 41:20.321
Not everybody watches Joe Rogan, but the point is, is that how many Joe Rogans do they need to have in order to have a sort of monopoly on what we think and what questions we are asking.

41:22.216 --> 41:31.024
And now again, they're complaining about a single YouTube person as being a pain in the ass, a single YouTube guy spreading misinformation.

41:31.084 --> 41:37.789
And they are, we, I want you to see is that the way that this is done is the Lex Friedman podcast.

41:37.809 --> 41:38.970
Cause that's two people.

41:40.071 --> 41:47.638
One could be witting and one might be unwitting, but most of the time it's two people that are wittingly working together

41:48.735 --> 41:57.257
to portray an illusion of consensus about what questions to ask and what answers are the most interesting to discuss.

41:58.938 --> 42:04.499
Joe Rogan's pretty good at it, but more than likely, Joe Rogan, it's his guests that are doing it.

42:04.639 --> 42:13.662
And Joe Rogan is just really good at being that sounding board or that reflector device or whatever you want to call it that he is as a conversationalist, which is fine.

42:16.880 --> 42:25.910
But what you see with Brett Weinstein and his wife is probably Brett playing his wife a little bit and actually working with his brother and all these other guys, including Joe Rogan.

42:27.632 --> 42:36.302
When I was still in contact with Brett Weinstein, he bragged to our Signal Chat that he was the scientific advisor to Joe Rogan.

42:38.735 --> 42:41.556
I mean, I'm not, I don't, I don't, I'm not making, I can't make anything up.

42:41.676 --> 42:45.358
I just, I can only just tell the truth and whatever comes out, comes out.

42:45.858 --> 42:49.000
Sometimes I remember the fun details and sometimes not.

42:52.521 --> 43:06.488
But this, this little bit right here, so that you can see how these Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk talking just now was one of these things.

43:07.563 --> 43:17.431
And to the extent to which each of them understands what role they're playing, I don't know, but I am absolutely certain that they understand they're playing a role.

43:19.152 --> 43:32.002
Because none of these people have risen to prominence, fame, and that much social power without the blessing of the people that are running this theater.

43:32.562 --> 43:33.403
There's just no way.

43:34.384 --> 43:35.205
It's not possible.

43:36.135 --> 43:46.864
And they may be from, some of these people may be from competing factions that are running parts of this theater, but it isn't 10 factions.

43:48.565 --> 43:53.169
It's not 20 different groups or 20 different weaponized piles of money fighting.

43:53.809 --> 44:04.658
There might be some Asian component and some North American component or some European and English component, London component and Vatican component, or I don't know what, but

44:07.461 --> 44:15.771
These people all know that they're playing for bigger powers than their sponsors or whatever it is that they're hawking in the day.

44:15.791 --> 44:19.495
Oops, I'm gonna let that go just a little bit longer because it's fun.

44:21.665 --> 44:47.665
studies of science when in 1854 Ferdinand Van Der Veer Hayden during his exploration of the upper Missouri River found proof of Owen's theory a few unidentified teeth he mailed to leading paleontologist Joseph Leidy who several years later declared them to be from an ancient extinct Trachodon dinosaur which beyond ironic

44:48.445 --> 45:17.660
so that's because we can do things like look at modern analogs and see how teeth are fucking made we know if it's a predator or if it's prey we know if it's an herbivore or a carnivore we know how teeth are fucking built even back then even when they're doing naturalist we know how teeth are built so what he means is we know how teeth in the animal kingdom um are shaped depending on the

45:18.678 --> 45:22.981
the biology of the animal.

45:24.342 --> 45:26.643
It's very imprecise language.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.626
It's designed specifically to mislead the young.

45:30.106 --> 45:32.407
And then Joe Rogan laughing at him.

45:32.447 --> 45:43.235
Is he laughing at him because he realizes how ham-fisted this rebuttal is and how much he's discrediting himself by constantly swearing?

45:46.069 --> 45:48.191
I mean, shouldn't you instead be laughing at him?

45:48.231 --> 45:54.735
It's just kind of the way also when, um, when the guy who went to space, what is his name?

45:55.516 --> 46:04.542
Is it, is it, is it not Glenn, but the other dude, um, Buzz Aldrin has knocked a couple of people out, right?

46:04.582 --> 46:05.303
I mean, what kind of,

46:06.047 --> 46:07.268
What kind of reaction is that?

46:07.328 --> 46:15.234
If you climbed Mount Everest, would you really be so angry at somebody that you'd knock them out if they said you didn't?

46:15.915 --> 46:23.721
I mean, it doesn't seem compatible with having achieved the greatest achievement in mankind's history.

46:25.302 --> 46:28.103
to even be vulnerable to something like that anymore.

46:28.223 --> 46:29.183
That seems crazy.

46:29.223 --> 46:39.026
You almost died in outer space and spent like a week farther away from the Earth than any other human being or however long they were away.

46:39.086 --> 46:40.967
And then you came back successfully.

46:40.987 --> 46:53.731
And I have a hard time understanding that press conference from when they first got in front of the press and started talking about their moon landing stuff.

46:55.120 --> 47:00.445
And here we have again, another guy who's not, doesn't seem normal for me.

47:01.406 --> 47:17.100
If this guy is a private paleontologist, not working for a university, not on government grants, but apparently selling replicas of bones to museums all over the world for thousands of dollars.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.601
And that's their real business.

47:18.681 --> 47:19.962
They make the replicas.

47:20.762 --> 47:23.043
You know, there are private owners of these skeletons.

47:23.083 --> 47:27.285
These skeletons go for potentially millions of dollars, but then you never see the skeleton.

47:27.305 --> 47:33.669
You see a cast of the skeleton that these private bone companies are the curators of.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.630
They own the molds.

47:37.711 --> 47:48.677
And this is the guy who's swearing at you to tell you that these things are real, which is extraordinary because, again, what are the consequences of the idea that, well,

47:49.822 --> 47:52.803
Dinosaurs have been grossly exaggerated.

47:52.823 --> 47:56.004
Of course, there are mammoths.

47:56.084 --> 47:57.545
Of course, there are woolly mammoths.

47:57.585 --> 47:59.626
We found those in the permafrost.

47:59.666 --> 48:03.227
So not all of these stories are made up.

48:03.267 --> 48:07.148
But what if some of the larger ones are fabrications?

48:10.530 --> 48:11.290
You know, what if even

48:12.065 --> 48:19.406
three or four of them are fabrications because they're so valuable in private collections that people will pay millions of dollars for them.

48:21.527 --> 48:22.947
It seems extraordinary, right?

48:24.007 --> 48:25.547
And so that's really where I was.

48:25.607 --> 48:39.290
When I was a little kid, I walked into the museum and the first time I was ever taken to a museum that mattered at all was actually to see the collection of King Tut.

48:40.669 --> 48:49.316
And so we actually went all the way to Chicago with my family to go to the, take my grandma to the field museum.

48:49.496 --> 48:51.058
I believe it was at the field museum.

48:51.798 --> 48:56.742
And because the memory is very clear, that was where I saw my first brontosaurus skeleton.

48:57.803 --> 48:59.124
And it's a huge skeleton.

48:59.264 --> 49:03.748
I could not figure out how it was that they had mounted all those rocks so high.

49:05.529 --> 49:09.130
and how they were so big and then they only had little wires going through it.

49:09.170 --> 49:11.110
How did they get those wires in those rocks?

49:11.170 --> 49:15.171
Like did they drill them in or how is that even safe?

49:17.611 --> 49:19.912
It's got to be tons, right?

49:19.952 --> 49:23.653
I mean, some of those bones might weigh as much as a car or am I an idiot?

49:25.013 --> 49:28.614
I was a little kid asking those questions, but that's what I was asking.

49:29.374 --> 49:31.034
How did they get those rocks so high?

49:32.174 --> 49:33.115
Isn't that dangerous?

49:33.135 --> 49:34.635
How come that metal doesn't bend?

49:38.337 --> 49:44.700
Only many, many, many years later did I find out there are no real bones in any museum on display.

49:46.101 --> 49:48.242
This guy just said, well, yeah, but that's the way it is.

49:48.262 --> 49:49.043
I mean, come on.

49:51.983 --> 49:52.743
drawings like this.

49:53.243 --> 49:56.864
It's like the Megalodon tooth on my arm.

49:57.204 --> 49:58.005
It is a predator.

49:58.065 --> 49:59.325
It's obviously a serrated tooth.

49:59.345 --> 50:00.805
Is it Megalodon or Megalodon?

50:00.825 --> 50:01.786
How do you say it?

50:01.946 --> 50:02.766
It depends.

50:02.786 --> 50:04.846
Your emphasis can be on a different syllable.

50:05.546 --> 50:07.727
So, syllable.

50:07.807 --> 50:08.047
What?

50:09.708 --> 50:09.948
What?

50:12.048 --> 50:15.329
And he's pointing to his Mastodon tooth, but did he show it to you?

50:16.749 --> 50:18.311
Did he show you the mastodon tooth?

50:18.751 --> 50:20.714
Cause now they're not watching the video.

50:20.734 --> 50:22.116
So I guess he's not tired anymore.

50:22.156 --> 50:23.718
He's not like this talking to Joe.

50:24.118 --> 50:24.418
Yeah.

50:24.439 --> 50:25.700
I mean, you know, the same thing.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.082
It's, it's really, uh, yeah.

50:27.322 --> 50:28.704
Uh-huh.

50:29.405 --> 50:34.251
And then he puts his arm down and he says, yeah, the mastodon tattoo down here, the one that you can't see right now.

50:35.834 --> 50:55.755
right so watch carefully what happens when he decides to watch the video again before or a carnivore we know how teeth are fucking built even back then even when they're doing naturalistic drawings like this it's like like the the the megalodon tooth on my arm it is a predator it's obviously a serrated is it megalodon or megalodon

50:56.015 --> 50:56.755
How do you say it?

50:56.915 --> 50:57.896
It depends.

50:57.936 --> 51:00.537
Your emphasis can be on a different syllable.

51:00.857 --> 51:01.557
It's both.

51:01.757 --> 51:03.598
It's not like nuclear and nuclear?

51:04.198 --> 51:04.998
Did you hear it?

51:05.459 --> 51:11.681
Your emphasis can be on another syllable.

51:13.122 --> 51:14.422
What is he, from another planet?

51:15.622 --> 51:19.204
There's no accent of English on the whole Earth.

51:20.060 --> 51:22.103
that says those two words like that.

51:22.163 --> 51:23.025
List again, please.

51:23.285 --> 51:27.411
I mean, this is absurdity at the highest level.

51:29.534 --> 51:30.135
Ah, darn it.

51:30.896 --> 51:31.157
Sorry.

51:35.936 --> 51:37.197
It was like right here, I don't know where.

51:37.217 --> 51:40.739
Like, don't bring your flat-earth bullshit.

51:40.979 --> 51:47.283
During his exploration, declared them to be from an ancient, extinct, Trachodon dynasty.

51:47.383 --> 51:50.125
Two unidentified, long-lost animals.

51:50.565 --> 51:56.269
Like, don't bring your f- Uh, we- we discovered marine reptiles and the first dinosaur.

51:56.389 --> 51:58.470
Even when they're doing naturalistic drawings like this.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.891
It's like, how teeth are fucking made.

52:00.931 --> 52:01.352
There we go.

52:02.273 --> 52:05.294
We know if it's a predator or if it's prey.

52:05.675 --> 52:08.056
We know if it's an herbivore or a carnivore.

52:08.296 --> 52:10.057
We know how teeth are fucking built.

52:10.697 --> 52:13.698
Even back then, even when they're doing naturalistic drawings like this.

52:14.198 --> 52:17.820
It's like the Megalodon tooth on my arm.

52:18.160 --> 52:18.961
It is a predator.

52:19.001 --> 52:20.241
It's obviously a serrated tooth.

52:20.261 --> 52:21.742
Is it Megalodon or Megalodon?

52:21.782 --> 52:23.022
How do you say it?

52:23.743 --> 52:26.524
Your emphasis can be on a different syllable.

52:26.844 --> 52:27.544
It's both.

52:27.724 --> 52:29.585
It's not like nuclear and nuclear?

52:29.805 --> 52:30.166
No, no.

52:31.246 --> 52:33.428
Do you know how hard it is to talk like that?

52:33.488 --> 52:36.271
Like to change the accent on words like that?

52:36.811 --> 52:40.575
Your emphasis, your emphasis could be on another syllable.

52:41.055 --> 52:43.237
Like that was, that's pretty impressive.

52:45.014 --> 52:46.835
I would like to try to practice doing that.

52:47.075 --> 52:48.095
It doesn't have two U's.

52:50.216 --> 52:54.837
But it's spelled the same, but it's like Dimetrodon or Dimetrodon.

52:55.157 --> 52:55.797
It's the same thing.

52:55.977 --> 52:57.878
Megalodon or Megalodon.

52:59.999 --> 53:08.421
Does anyone know what effect psychologically it has when you listen to two people and one laughs at the other one?

53:09.281 --> 53:14.283
Does that send a psychological signal of agreement?

53:15.542 --> 53:29.153
Is that when Joel laughs with him, does that create the illusion of, oh, these two guys definitely agree that this is ridiculous, that these guys agree that what the dude with the yellow beard is saying is right?

53:29.713 --> 53:30.314
I think it does.

53:35.822 --> 53:36.223
Keep doing this.

53:36.243 --> 53:36.663
What is it, 20 minutes?

53:36.683 --> 53:37.384
Now he's got his arm up again.

53:37.404 --> 53:39.566
Now he's got his arm up there again.

53:55.564 --> 54:08.754
necessary for the blossoming theory of evolution would be hypothesized and then conveniently discovered by teams of evolutionist archaeologists purposely out looking to find such fossils.

54:08.814 --> 54:09.715
I'm glad I brought a lot of beer.

54:09.775 --> 54:21.924
And it is even more dubious that such fossils have supposedly existed for millions of years but were never found by or known to any civilization in the history of humanity until evolution.

54:22.965 --> 54:35.161
Okay, yeah, the reason why we didn't know about things beforehand because we weren't doing shit like wholesale intellectual studies of science when people were building fucking pyramids and stuff like that.

54:35.541 --> 54:37.023
That's why we have different ages.

54:38.024 --> 54:57.533
in throughout anthropological records we have the so he's saying that when people were doing pyramids they were too stupid to be digging for fossils they were too dumb to think about that stuff they still had to figure a lot of other things out so they wasted all their time building pyramids that's that's pretty impressive he's got a pretty good insight into

54:58.093 --> 55:21.826
and Iron Age and all that because we have to do things like figure out the land around us and when we start finding really old bones like hey this looks like a really big chicken bone what the fuck or this looks like a huge human with a single eye what the fuck we start looking at stuff like that saying I really can't stress how obvious it is

55:22.893 --> 55:28.459
if you don't conduct yourself in a professional way that your intention is not to be taken seriously.

55:29.140 --> 55:29.741
It can't be.

55:30.541 --> 55:42.454
The only people that would take him seriously professionally in that outfit would be people that if he was speaking in such a way that kind of projected or demanded that respect.

55:42.474 --> 55:43.696
This kind of

55:44.679 --> 55:45.580
It is absurd.

55:46.140 --> 55:54.767
But this absurdity on the background of, oh yeah, well, they were probably smoking before they started or whatever is exactly what is the magic.

55:55.828 --> 56:01.492
Because there's no way anyone would ever come onto my stream.

56:01.733 --> 56:10.299
And even if it was Snoop Dogg, we wouldn't sit here and start with a big spliff and be on screen doing that.

56:10.580 --> 56:11.801
That would just be insane.

56:12.881 --> 56:16.803
because it's not the message that we're trying to send.

56:16.843 --> 56:21.144
It's not the work that I'm doing.

56:21.484 --> 56:29.327
If at the end of the stream, you know, Snoop Dogg said, okay, now we're going in, now we're going into the other part of the garage, turn that camera off.

56:29.347 --> 56:35.230
Well then, you know, that might be the joke that we end with, but you see what the problem is?

56:41.298 --> 56:43.560
The other thing to think about, and then we're going to move on.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.841
This was where I wanted to get, thank goodness.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.644
I was a little bit struggling because I couldn't remember where we were.

56:50.084 --> 57:08.798
The other thing to think about is, is that if these bones are so rare and so real, then why are they not treated just like, let's say, a perfectly preserved sarcophagus from Egypt?

57:09.959 --> 57:16.163
or a burial ground of Native Americans.

57:17.183 --> 57:32.051
If we only have three intact skeletons that even remotely resemble dinosaurs per se, why aren't these things the most cherished national treasures of the United States?

57:32.712 --> 57:34.813
Why are they all in private collections?

57:35.353 --> 57:36.874
They're not artwork.

57:39.013 --> 57:41.774
It's bigger than that, if that's the case, isn't it?

57:42.374 --> 57:45.415
And so all of this stuff just doesn't jive.

57:45.695 --> 57:47.895
All of it really doesn't jive.

57:48.416 --> 57:58.758
The most important thing that doesn't jive is how uninterested modern biologists in academia are in this subject.

57:58.858 --> 58:04.480
The only people that are interested in it are guys like this and kids under the age of 12.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.721
And there's gotta be a reason.

58:08.062 --> 58:12.606
There's gotta be a reason why all of the dinosaur enthusiasts are kids.

58:13.347 --> 58:22.776
All of the dinosaur scientists are... It's a crazy place we live in right now, ladies and gentlemen.

58:22.816 --> 58:27.501
It's a crazy place and I think we need a new consensus about biology that we definitely understand.

58:28.322 --> 58:33.789
We need a new consensus about the idea that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

58:34.330 --> 58:43.102
And there's hundreds of thousands of biologists and doctors and probably also lawyers like patent lawyers should have known already that that was the case.

58:44.568 --> 58:54.772
There's a lot of technology that has been rolled out as commercial products in the pharmaceutical industry and the biosciences industry that serves academia.

58:55.232 --> 59:03.915
And all of those people definitely knew that transfection was a word that described lipid nanoparticles being used to deliver RNA to a target.

59:05.776 --> 59:08.057
That's why there's a product called Lipofectamine.

59:10.495 --> 59:25.483
So RNA cannot pandemic is something that I think every academic biologist should think very hard about what they know and don't know about the factual nature of that statement.

59:25.503 --> 59:38.771
If you really know that RNA can pandemic and how you know it, because I really think the argument that there's never been a good argument made that RNA can pandemic, never.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.003
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever.

59:41.063 --> 59:51.703
The only argument that they make is virology and RNA virology is very, very weak as the no virus people like Mark Bailey have demonstrated in a lot of their work.

59:53.712 --> 01:00:01.936
The vaccine schedule in the USA is a criminal enterprise, and we can start on any number of ways to describe why that's the case.

01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:15.143
But despite having maybe 10 or 15 or even 20 less shots than the United States, there are no other countries in the world that are suffering from diseases that we are not.

01:00:16.178 --> 01:00:17.139
Let me repeat that.

01:00:17.859 --> 01:00:26.203
There are no diseases in the world that are the least prevalent in America because of our extraordinary vaccine schedule.

01:00:27.284 --> 01:00:38.109
Like in all other places, we really have a lot of this rotavirus stuff, but thank goodness we in America are giving all of our kids a rotavirus vaccine thanks to none other than Paul Offit.

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:43.292
But the rest of the world that doesn't use the rotavirus, they're all, my goodness, they've got problems.

01:00:43.332 --> 01:00:44.993
That rotavirus, that's a pesky thing.

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:51.810
We've got to teach our young parents that this is a lie.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:57.313
We've got to teach our young children that this is a lie so that they grow up and change the world.

01:00:58.573 --> 01:01:00.334
That's how we are going to change the world.

01:01:00.354 --> 01:01:03.256
We're going to teach the kids and they're going to change the world.

01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:13.601
Unfortunately, because of everyone from Nancy Pelosi on up, the people that just went along with it because yeah, sure.

01:01:13.661 --> 01:01:14.101
I'll do it.

01:01:14.978 --> 01:01:24.927
all the way up to the people who are the masterminds of it, including the people like Joshua Lederberg, who have been a thought leader in America for a couple generations.

01:01:26.288 --> 01:01:38.418
Hilary Koprowski, Bob Gallo, David Baltimore, all of these people are thought leaders that from whom Robert Malone and Judy Mikovits and these people descend, even Tony Fauci.

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:41.812
It's murder and lies, ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:44.953
We gotta remind people that it's murder and lies, and we gotta teach people.

01:01:44.973 --> 01:01:58.340
This is how coronavirus invades your body, sinking its crown-like spikes into your cells, using molecular deception to pick their locks, and hijacking your body.

01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:05.709
But there is one way to prevent this, by using one of the virus's weapons on itself.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.011
Hey, smart people, Joe here.

01:02:08.612 --> 01:02:15.758
Right now, there's about 7 billion people all waiting for the same thing, a vaccine that will protect us from the virus causing COVID-19.

01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:19.341
And if you're like me, you want to know what's in it, what makes it work.

01:02:19.581 --> 01:02:20.462
So this is, of course, 2021.

01:02:20.502 --> 01:02:21.062
And here we go.

01:02:21.102 --> 01:02:21.262
Work.

01:02:25.726 --> 01:02:32.452
Making a vaccine and getting it out to the public is a long process with a lot of steps, so we can make sure the vaccine is safe and effective.

01:02:32.952 --> 01:02:35.855
And it's pretty typical for that to take 10 years or more.

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:43.141
In an emergency, like this pandemic, well, we can't skip any of those steps, but we can speed this up by doing some of them at the same time.

01:02:43.541 --> 01:02:45.242
Now, what are they just doing right there?

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:52.488
What they're doing is using a simple cartoon to cast an enchantment.

01:02:53.209 --> 01:02:54.350
Do you know what the enchantment is?

01:02:55.342 --> 01:03:01.467
I wonder if Robert Malone would know what the enchantment is, seeing as he's like a bio, bio scientist, something, something.

01:03:01.868 --> 01:03:02.588
Ruby, is that you?

01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:07.913
Do you know what the enchantment is?

01:03:08.854 --> 01:03:22.766
The enchantment of course is, is that the, the fact that it takes 10 years was just because we're lazy or we're slow, or we don't want to spend all the money at once, or because we're never in a hurry usually.

01:03:25.523 --> 01:03:40.846
The reason why it takes 10 years is because of the ethical process of deciding when it is ethically justified to test an idea, a therapy, a methodology, a drug on humans.

01:03:44.126 --> 01:03:53.328
And so by putting them all at the same time, you have completely voided the main reason why it used to take 10 years.

01:03:54.588 --> 01:04:03.394
because it takes 10 years when the ethical concerns are taken into account in the way that we thought and previously was proper.

01:04:05.076 --> 01:04:13.241
And so here's PBS News producing videos for YouTube with this guy already in 2020.

01:04:13.301 --> 01:04:15.983
I think this is from 2020, actually, if I put them in the right order.

01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:20.787
Let me just see where the dog is really quick, because I thought she walked in here

01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:45.709
Thank you for that.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:51.500
Sorry, I am home alone and I have the garage cracked at the bottom so that we get some cross breeze in here and then.

01:04:54.133 --> 01:05:02.100
So they're already pulling a trick on you when they, when he just says, well, you know, normally it takes 10 years, but this time we're going to, we're going to do all these at the same time.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:02.760
And it's fine.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:03.341
No, it's not.

01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:18.273
Because if you do them all at the same time, then the ethical considerations, which were the basis for the timeline in the first place are completely thrown out the window just by moving these very pretty, pleasing colored lines together instead of apart.

01:05:20.555 --> 01:05:21.236
Stop lying.

01:05:27.436 --> 01:05:33.405
Like this pandemic, well, we can't skip any of those steps, but we can speed this up by doing some of them at the same time.

01:05:34.046 --> 01:05:37.370
But none of that can happen until you figure out the first step.

01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:41.095
What do you put in your vaccine that will make it protect people?

01:05:41.849 --> 01:05:43.670
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

01:05:44.011 --> 01:05:47.173
We're going to visit a lab and meet some scientists who study the coronavirus.

01:05:47.593 --> 01:05:57.279
We're also going to meet a really big, awesome science machine and learn how they used it to design this, the key ingredient inside the very first COVID-19 vaccines.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:03.984
Now here's my goal with this video, to show you what exactly is in the new COVID vaccines that makes them work.

01:06:04.424 --> 01:06:07.766
and how they got made faster than any vaccine in history.

01:06:08.286 --> 01:06:15.731
My hope is that you'll be better informed when you get your shot, and you'll have a new appreciation for why science like this is so important.

01:06:16.491 --> 01:06:18.732
This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine.

01:06:25.293 --> 01:06:33.220
It turns out that some of the most important research for making the COVID-19 vaccine is happening right down the road from me, at the University of Texas.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.983
Which is pretty cool, because I did my PhD right here.

01:06:37.404 --> 01:06:40.566
And in here is the lab of Dr. Jason McClellan.

01:06:40.827 --> 01:06:44.029
He studies how pathogens like coronavirus cause disease.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:50.475
There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common

01:06:50.555 --> 01:06:52.516
That said, coronavirus wrangler.

01:06:52.536 --> 01:06:53.777
I don't know if you saw that or not.

01:06:53.817 --> 01:06:55.979
That's them, I guess, trying to be funny.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:06.166
So keep in mind that Mark just did a show and has a website called therealevent201.com.

01:07:07.246 --> 01:07:18.534
And there you can find an event that took place in 2018 where the lady who was on the front cover of Time with a few other people like Big Barney,

01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:26.065
and Weissman and Karaku or whatever her name is.

01:07:27.426 --> 01:07:36.495
Anyway, you saw that, you've seen that Time Magazine article where she was talking about, giving a talk about using the spike protein as a vaccine.

01:07:38.365 --> 01:07:53.022
Ralph Baric has been talking about using the spike protein as a vaccine for quite a while, or the spike protein being a neutralizing target for a little while, or antibodies to the spike protein being the antibodies that we have to look for as a correlate of protection,

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.458
And so it's not a new story, it's an old story.

01:07:56.478 --> 01:07:57.639
It's the standard story.

01:07:58.219 --> 01:08:03.842
It's the standard biosecurity narrative that there are viruses called coronaviruses.

01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:06.464
There are viruses called SARS coronaviruses.

01:08:06.524 --> 01:08:09.105
SARS coronaviruses cause respiratory disease.

01:08:09.605 --> 01:08:14.528
We make antibodies to the spike protein of SARS and that's how we fight it off.

01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:17.550
That's the narrative they've been telling us for almost 20 years now.

01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:28.655
And this guy is going to try and reiterate it in such a way that it sounds like, you know, we're learning and it's a new idea and this is cutting edge.

01:08:29.824 --> 01:08:31.045
This is the narrative.

01:08:31.125 --> 01:08:33.947
This is the narrative they've published over and over again.

01:08:33.967 --> 01:08:50.921
HecoHealth Alliance and Peter Daszak published this narrative and even publish experiments that purport to edify this narrative as the reality of our high fidelity understanding of how SARS coronaviruses from bats interact with human populations.

01:08:57.398 --> 01:09:03.482
There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common cold.

01:09:04.043 --> 01:09:07.745
And then there have been three coronaviruses that have caused pandemics.

01:09:08.346 --> 01:09:13.549
And that's the first SARS coronavirus back in 2002, the MERS coronavirus in 2012, and now SARS-CoV-2, which emerged earlier this year.

01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:25.436
At the end of December 2019, it was on the news that there was these pneumonia clusters in China.

01:09:25.616 --> 01:09:30.039
In the scientific community, we thought maybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus.

01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:39.884
I was actually snowboarding with my family and my collaborator Barney Graham at the Vaccine Research Center at the NIH called and he said he's been in contact with US CDC, Chinese CDC.

01:09:40.084 --> 01:09:44.206
It looks like it's a beta coronavirus similar to SARS and they wanted to move.

01:09:44.326 --> 01:09:49.510
So Barney, Barney Graham, I believe is the guy and Mark could correct me if I'm wrong.

01:09:49.991 --> 01:09:58.658
I think Barney Graham is the guy who was roommates with a dude from Pfizer at Rice University when they were in college.

01:09:58.698 --> 01:10:03.041
And then now like he's the head of the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center.

01:10:03.902 --> 01:10:07.345
And that guy was one of the heads of Pfizer, not the dude like the,

01:10:07.885 --> 01:10:11.831
The one that like hugged the lady from the EU and gave her a kiss on the lips.

01:10:13.152 --> 01:10:14.634
Not Bourla, but some other dude.

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:19.261
No, not Yidden, like a current Pfizer guy.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.066
Why doesn't it start again?

01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:26.917
rapidly try and make a vaccine and I said we're definitely in.

01:10:27.217 --> 01:10:32.460
So you're just like scrolling through your phone in this ski lodge, you're like we gotta get to work.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:41.864
So while the rest of us were focused on royal family drama and just hearing the first mentions of coronavirus for the very first time, scientists like Jason knew this was serious.

01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:43.546
and they were already getting to work.

01:10:43.926 --> 01:10:50.756
As soon as researchers in China decoded the virus's genome and published it online, Jason's lab could start designing a vaccine.

01:10:51.216 --> 01:10:57.826
I texted Daniel Rapp, my graduate student, and let him know to be on high alert, because as soon as we get the sequence, we're going to move as quickly as we can.

01:10:58.246 --> 01:11:02.690
Jason was on that winter vacation and texted me that it was a coronavirus.

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:06.754
And eventually, in early January, the sequence was released online publicly.

01:11:07.155 --> 01:11:08.876
And then things started moving pretty quickly.

01:11:09.357 --> 01:11:10.237
Let's step back for a minute.

01:11:10.758 --> 01:11:12.079
What does a vaccine do?

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.681
Well, it trains your immune system.

01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:22.769
Let's step back for a minute and realize that one of the easiest ways that a national security state could execute this illusion

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:38.314
would be to first have the DOD develop a widely universally activating immunogen that would guarantee you a robust antibody response after four or five exposures.

01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:52.337
Maybe you'd say, for example, hire somebody like Robert Malone and send him to a place like EpiVax and have EpiVax as a company screen a bunch of people for universal epitopes which are shared across

01:11:54.518 --> 01:12:10.007
major histocompatibility complex molecules across different backgrounds to identify molecular motifs that can trigger lots of people's MHC and therefore trigger antigen presentation and trigger an immune response, an antibody response.

01:12:10.548 --> 01:12:21.094
And so if you wanted to say, for example, have a guaranteed successful vaccine, a vaccine that would produce a robust antibody response, even in the boosters,

01:12:22.575 --> 01:12:38.060
One of the ways to do it would be to take something like technology that would be developed at some place like EpiVax and take that technology and make a small DNA clone of it and then put that clone somewhere where you wanted it to be found.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.641
And then when you found it, you'd say, well, we need a vaccine for it.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:42.061
And we got one.

01:12:43.755 --> 01:12:56.038
And so because he called Barney Graham, he's essentially calling Tony Fauci, which means he's essentially calling DITRA and DOD and HHS and all of the intelligence agencies in the entire national security apparatus.

01:12:56.078 --> 01:12:59.139
Because once you're talking to Barney Graham, you're talking to them.

01:13:01.399 --> 01:13:06.780
And so he's not like, you know, six degrees of separation away from Kevin Bacon here.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.641
We're talking about, he called Barney Graham.

01:13:09.454 --> 01:13:14.658
from the ski hill, and Barney Graham is directly connected to the national security state.

01:13:14.698 --> 01:13:15.599
There can be no doubt.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:22.484
That's why this guy, while he tells the story, is saying things like, when you get your shot, you want to know what's in it.

01:13:22.885 --> 01:13:26.908
Assuming you're going to get your shot, because when you get your shot assumes that.

01:13:32.029 --> 01:13:39.291
system to know what a germ, like a virus, looks like, so that they can recognize the germ, fight it off, and keep you safe without you getting sick.

01:13:40.271 --> 01:13:42.572
This is the virus that causes COVID-19.

01:13:43.012 --> 01:13:50.014
The outer shell is made of a few different kinds of proteins, but these proteins sticking off the side are the most important part, the spike.

01:13:50.734 --> 01:13:56.776
These spikes are what give this family of viruses their name, the coronaviruses, because they look kinda like a crown.

01:13:57.256 --> 01:14:00.577
The coronavirus uses that spike to sneak into our cells.

01:14:01.317 --> 01:14:11.867
The three-dimensional shape of that spike is super important, because that exact shape is what lets the virus latch on to receptors on the outside of our cells, almost like picking a lock.

01:14:12.547 --> 01:14:14.689
And then it sneaks inside.

01:14:15.069 --> 01:14:24.017
Those shapes sticking out on the outside of a virus are also what your immune system is feeling for, to figure out if this is a foreign invader, if it should attack or not.

01:14:24.818 --> 01:14:32.324
The problem is, the first time your body sees a virus, your immune system responds so slowly that the virus has time to make gazillions of copies of itself.

01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:34.466
And you can still get very, very sick.

01:14:35.186 --> 01:14:36.807
That's what's great about a vaccine.

01:14:36.968 --> 01:14:45.954
It trains your immune system what to look for, so when the real virus shows up, your body can respond super fast and destroy the virus before it has a chance to hijack your cells.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:50.218
Now that's funny, hijack your cells before it has a chance to hijack your cells.

01:14:50.698 --> 01:14:51.899
They've never shown that

01:14:53.422 --> 01:15:00.246
that infection or viral load or any of these things are confirmably lower in people that are vaccinated.

01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:01.347
That's not a correlate.

01:15:02.347 --> 01:15:03.508
That's never been a correlate.

01:15:03.568 --> 01:15:12.694
Not in one, not in one grant proposal, not in one grant call has that never, that's never been a correlate of immunity.

01:15:13.054 --> 01:15:17.377
The amount of virus that's made and the amount of virus that's made cannot be measured.

01:15:18.257 --> 01:15:23.038
So the whole concept that this is what this guy's saying, I don't even know where he would learn this from.

01:15:23.078 --> 01:15:39.962
You would have to buy a comic book about virology from somebody like Vincent Racaniello before you would get to that absolutely ridiculous child-level approximation of what might happen in the event of viruses being real in the first place.

01:15:42.383 --> 01:15:49.468
But the idea that he thinks that antibodies prevent the virus from being able to hijack your cells and make lots of copies of it.

01:15:49.508 --> 01:15:53.590
But the first time you see the virus, it makes lots of copies of itself.

01:15:53.730 --> 01:16:01.275
But then the next time it doesn't, well, that's a pretty extraordinary claim that should be pretty extraordinarily easy to measure.

01:16:01.335 --> 01:16:03.016
But of course it's never been measured.

01:16:04.557 --> 01:16:05.718
They can't measure that.

01:16:09.053 --> 01:16:14.883
It's an extraordinary statement that makes clear that he's not the one who's making the script.

01:16:14.924 --> 01:16:16.306
This is not a smart guy.

01:16:16.366 --> 01:16:17.168
This is an actor.

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:19.912
And that should insult you.

01:16:21.274 --> 01:16:23.175
So what's actually in a vaccine?

01:16:23.575 --> 01:16:26.096
Well, sometimes a vaccine has a weakened or dead virus.

01:16:26.296 --> 01:16:29.677
That's how polio and measles and mumps and some other vaccines work.

01:16:30.217 --> 01:16:34.279
But these days, a vaccine usually just contains a little piece of the virus.

01:16:34.759 --> 01:16:36.260
The newest COVID-19 vaccines?

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.900
They're just the spike.

01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:49.745
But for that spike to work as a vaccine, to train your immune system to recognize the actual virus, it has to have the same three-dimensional shape as the spike on the whole complete virus.

01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:56.004
But making the spike all by itself, not attached to the rest of the virus, turns out to be really hard.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:17:00.148
Because the spike is actually pretty floppy, just floating around on its own.

01:17:00.188 --> 01:17:02.871
It doesn't look much like the spike on the actual virus.

01:17:03.572 --> 01:17:06.855
And this is the key thing Jason's lab figured out how to make.

01:17:07.276 --> 01:17:10.459
For years, they'd studied SARS and- But that was a lie.

01:17:12.185 --> 01:17:13.346
Isn't that extraordinary?

01:17:13.406 --> 01:17:20.311
I mean, they have all these fancy tools, all these three-dimensional models, and then they tell you that the spike protein.

01:17:20.771 --> 01:17:30.438
Now, I don't, I'm not going to tell you that as a molecular biologist, I can definitively tell you, you know, what conformational changes occur and whether they occur or not and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:32.060
I don't, I can't confirm to you that

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:40.866
that antibody-dependent enhancement is the binding of antibodies to the open configuration of the spike to stabilize it.

01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:56.778
I can't tell you all that stuff, but I can tell you that there is a consensus among molecular biologists that this protein is real and it shares some sort of homologous functionality with other proteins which serve a similar function to bring two membranes together.

01:17:57.438 --> 01:18:24.205
So in that sense, this protein is known to change conformations, and this protein in particular, because it has two furin cleavage sites that enable it to be the most infectious virus in history, according to Charles Rixey, also has this dissociatable subunit, this ACE1 receptor binding domain that the S1 subunit just kind of gets cleaved and released on its own, supposedly, according to this mythology.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.943
And so, it's not just floppy like this, but it changes conformation.

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:44.753
And in one conformation, there's a hydrophobic portion of the protein that's supposedly exposed in what allows the membrane fusion to occur and might make it a more pathogenic protein if that hydrophobic part is exposed.

01:18:45.374 --> 01:18:53.139
That might be one of the damage-associated molecular patterns that your body makes memory to if all of these proteins are real.

01:18:54.369 --> 01:19:13.099
Now, if the spike protein, for example, was the EpiVax developed immunogen, and they wanted to find the spike protein somewhere, so they put it in a coronavirus sequence, or they put it in on a background where the rest of the coronavirus genes are available, then the illusion is done.

01:19:13.886 --> 01:19:15.508
Nobody has to be infected by it.

01:19:15.548 --> 01:19:17.291
It doesn't have to be found in lots of places.

01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:30.688
They only had to find it in the one time that is going to be used to justify Jason McClellan's work, to justify Barney's choice, to justify that Moderna lady who was on that Ted Talk on stage saying it took us 45 minutes to design it.

01:19:33.089 --> 01:19:35.971
And so it's not floppy, it's about a conformational change.

01:19:36.031 --> 01:19:44.757
So science guy here talking about big science machines and trying to make you better informed before you take your shot is a liar.

01:19:45.638 --> 01:19:48.300
He's an actor and a well-paid one at that probably.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:58.267
He may not even know to what extent he is lying, but this guy probably, you know, it's wrong.

01:20:01.331 --> 01:20:04.773
MERS viruses, which are really closely related to the virus that causes COVID.

01:20:05.293 --> 01:20:08.815
So they already knew what tiny tweaks to make, to freeze to make.

01:20:09.215 --> 01:20:12.336
For years, they'd studied SARS and MERS viruses.

01:20:12.596 --> 01:20:20.340
Oh, MERS and SARS viruses are the viruses that Li Min Yan's husband studied and was funded to study by NIH and Tony Fauci.

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.402
And actually Li Min Yan as well was funded and worked for.

01:20:24.422 --> 01:20:28.044
Yeah, it's very close circle, interesting times.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:31.005
which are really closely related to the virus that causes COVID.

01:20:31.505 --> 01:20:37.287
So they already knew what tiny tweaks to make to freeze the coronavirus spikes into the perfect shape.

01:20:37.727 --> 01:20:42.629
So we got to work designing our stabilizing mutations into the new spike sequence.

01:20:42.869 --> 01:20:49.771
There was just two amino acids that we knew would, if we mutated them, that would stabilize the spike protein and make it a lot easier to work with in the laboratory.

01:20:50.271 --> 01:20:55.212
A protein, like the coronavirus spike, is a long folded string of individual units called amino acids.

01:20:55.692 --> 01:21:00.934
And these strings of amino acids are built using code written in RNA and stored in DNA.

01:21:01.574 --> 01:21:07.855
By changing, or mutating, the letters of DNA code, we can change the amino acids in our protein string.

01:21:08.335 --> 01:21:14.197
So it's cool, so you're like building scaffolding into the protein to be like, freeze in this shape.

01:21:14.357 --> 01:21:15.397
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

01:21:15.977 --> 01:21:18.820
How do you get from there to making the actual spike protein?

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:19.540
I can show you.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:19.801
Okay.

01:21:20.381 --> 01:21:25.806
Scientists are able to grow special immortal human cells outside the body, which they use as factories.

01:21:26.306 --> 01:21:30.150
They put a modified gene for something like their spike protein into those cells.

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:32.111
And then they'll start spitting out this protein.

01:21:32.472 --> 01:21:34.674
So they're just pumping it out into the liquid.

01:21:35.074 --> 01:21:35.714
Yeah, that's right.

01:21:35.794 --> 01:21:40.697
They take that liquid, run it through special purification machines, and are able to isolate a pure sample.

01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:45.420
Now, how is that any different than virology using clones?

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.801
It's not any different at all.

01:21:49.603 --> 01:21:57.067
So he says that they put a cloned gene into the cells, and then the cells start spitting out the protein.

01:21:57.087 --> 01:21:59.809
Do they spit out the protein all packaged up nice?

01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:04.552
Or do they spit out the protein on small membrane-bound vesicles?

01:22:06.015 --> 01:22:09.598
I think they do it on membrane-bound vesicles, which technically is exosomal.

01:22:10.518 --> 01:22:15.342
So they're shedding the protein, but the proteins are attached by a lipid particle bubble.

01:22:17.964 --> 01:22:31.094
And so what you're seeing here is a, you know, they tell you the truth, they show you the truth, but then they have a lot of people that agree that the truth is invisible or that that's not what you see.

01:22:32.534 --> 01:22:33.734
But he just said it right there.

01:22:34.034 --> 01:22:36.115
That's exactly what infectious clones are.

01:22:36.955 --> 01:22:37.835
He said it right here.

01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:41.116
You're going to change the DNA in order to change the protein.

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:44.757
But what you're changing is the RNA, of course, they're going to inject the RNA.

01:22:47.158 --> 01:23:00.682
And so while he's talking about making the spike protein, and while he's talking about making the spike protein in those cultures, just like Brian Artis at the Red Pill talked about them making venom.

01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:09.092
What he is failing to notice is that in order to get there, you have to be able to make the DNA and lots of it.

01:23:10.893 --> 01:23:11.633
And how do you do it?

01:23:11.673 --> 01:23:14.334
You do that in cell culture and bacterial cultures.

01:23:15.394 --> 01:23:19.596
You take the DNA and you grow it in a bacterial culture.

01:23:19.616 --> 01:23:26.498
And when you have enough of that DNA, then you put it on that cell culture and the cell culture makes the RNA and the protein.

01:23:28.168 --> 01:23:31.230
They're telling you how virology is done right here.

01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:37.014
Because all you got to do is add an RNA polymerase and an N-protein and an M-protein and there you go.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:43.218
That's exactly what the no-CM technique of Ralph Baric is all about.

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:48.582
The minimum number of coronavirus genes you need to get packaging to occur.

01:23:49.282 --> 01:23:55.427
And that guy is exclusively, exclusively talking, exclusively talking

01:23:56.286 --> 01:23:58.067
about packaging with the N-protein.

01:23:58.107 --> 01:24:01.829
And the N-protein is almost enough to get packaging to occur on its own.

01:24:01.869 --> 01:24:07.131
Is there any surprise that making the spike protein would also get packaging to occur?

01:24:07.191 --> 01:24:14.115
The spike protein is the most abundant subgenomic RNA produced whenever they do these experiments.

01:24:16.846 --> 01:24:19.487
Immortal human cells he's using there.

01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:28.891
Yeah, you know, that's because that's normal word in DNA By changing or mutating the letters of DNA code we can change the amino acids in our protein string.

01:24:29.352 --> 01:24:29.732
So it's cool.

01:24:29.752 --> 01:24:35.234
You're like building Scaffolding into the protein to be like freeze in this in this shape.

01:24:35.394 --> 01:24:36.415
Yeah, that's a good way to put it

01:24:36.855 --> 01:24:39.816
How do you get from there to making the actual spike protein?

01:24:40.156 --> 01:24:40.576
I can show you.

01:24:40.756 --> 01:24:40.836
Okay.

01:24:41.396 --> 01:24:46.838
Scientists are able to grow special, immortal human cells outside the body, which they use as factories.

01:24:47.318 --> 01:24:51.159
They put a modified gene for something like their spike protein into those cells.

01:24:51.379 --> 01:24:53.119
And then they'll start spitting out this protein.

01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:55.780
So they're just pumping it out into the liquid?

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:56.700
Yeah, that's right.

01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:03.242
They take that liquid, run it through special purification machines, and are able to isolate a pure sample of their spike protein.

01:25:03.982 --> 01:25:08.605
But how do they know for sure that this special spike protein looks like the real thing?

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:13.629
They take that liquid, run it through special purification machines, and are able to isolate a pure sample of their spike protein.

01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:14.430
Pure sample?

01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:15.891
What's that stuff down here?

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.863
How come it's not like a... I mean, I see it's a peak, but it's got a lot of trail here.

01:25:33.483 --> 01:25:34.524
It's got stuff up here.

01:25:35.165 --> 01:25:36.326
It's not a pure spike.

01:25:36.986 --> 01:25:37.647
But that's okay.

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:39.428
That's not the point for what he's saying.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:47.214
Just keep in mind that what he's going to do now is he's going to talk about the big science machine and they're going to take this pure sample of the protein

01:25:47.754 --> 01:26:01.817
that they made a quantity that would never exist in nature using a quantity of RNA that would never exist in nature, a quantity of cultured cells that would never exist in nature, starting with a quantity of pure DNA that would never exist in nature.

01:26:04.144 --> 01:26:22.252
And when they got all the way to this highly pure sample of the protein, they're able to use a computer and an electron microscope to create shadows of the protein at many different angles, and then use a computer program to take all of those shadows and create a three-dimensional average of the shape of the protein.

01:26:23.854 --> 01:26:45.075
And Robert Malone, at the beginning of the pandemic, was able to do the same thing with the 3CL protease and one other viral protein in order to interface that computer-generated model of X-ray crystallography, that's what they're going to do here in a minute, that computer model, and to interface that with all known drugs and pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog.

01:26:45.939 --> 01:26:56.406
to identify fumotidine, silicoxib, ivermectin, and remdesivir as good candidates to treat COVID.

01:26:56.446 --> 01:27:07.833
Although he was on a show with people and supported people like Pierre Cory and Robert Malone, I'm sorry, Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch, all of whom have advocated

01:27:08.893 --> 01:27:10.495
very vigorously for ivermectin.

01:27:10.535 --> 01:27:13.757
He himself has never said yes or no, ivermectin is great.

01:27:14.258 --> 01:27:17.540
He's just said that they've not allowed us to talk about it.

01:27:18.121 --> 01:27:24.726
Just like he's never said hydroxychloroquine is really great, even though what he has said is that they haven't allowed us to talk about it.

01:27:24.766 --> 01:27:26.348
You must see it for what it is.

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:36.436
This is an elaborate military exercise, a military operation designed to trick us into misleading our children about RNA's pandemic potential.

01:27:40.336 --> 01:27:46.279
But how do they know for sure that this special spike protein looks like the real thing, 3D shape and all?

01:27:46.839 --> 01:27:48.440
Well, they take pictures of it.

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.781
Using a big, awesome science machine.

01:27:52.241 --> 01:27:54.502
This is a cryo-electron microscope.

01:27:54.983 --> 01:28:01.426
This machine took a 3D picture of the coronavirus spike and helped design the very first COVID-19 vaccine.

01:28:01.606 --> 01:28:03.487
I got the big science machine.

01:28:03.567 --> 01:28:04.707
Looks like a giant microwave.

01:28:04.927 --> 01:28:08.289
I mean, the room is like a million dollars, and then the microscope's another million.

01:28:08.749 --> 01:28:11.510
So you're saying don't touch this screen, right?

01:28:11.530 --> 01:28:13.871
So you can see like the floor is separate from the instrument.

01:28:13.931 --> 01:28:14.751
So it's on its own.

01:28:14.991 --> 01:28:15.892
Vibrations are bad.

01:28:16.312 --> 01:28:20.774
These are wall panels that contain water running behind them to keep the temperature constant in the room.

01:28:20.854 --> 01:28:34.219
And then it also has to be... I mean, I don't know really why anybody does this anymore because Robert Malone at the beginning of the pandemic used DITRA's technology codified in the domain server to generate with a small crack

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:53.027
volunteer team, almost like the A-team, got together and made an x-ray crystallography computer model that was sufficient to identify ivermectin, silicoxib, famotidine, and remdesivir.

01:28:53.047 --> 01:28:56.229
And at least two of those have been widely advocated for.

01:28:57.769 --> 01:29:03.432
It's not really clear why domain did not identify hydroxychloroquine, but you know, whatever.

01:29:04.127 --> 01:29:07.768
Maybe because there was already a paper on that, he didn't bother to include it in the scan.

01:29:08.168 --> 01:29:09.728
Electromagnetically shielded, too.

01:29:10.008 --> 01:29:10.829
That is nuts.

01:29:10.849 --> 01:29:12.829
Look at this beefy cable over here.

01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:15.030
So that's the 200,000 volts coming from that.

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:15.510
OK.

01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:15.950
Yeah.

01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.950
So don't lick that one.

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:17.130
Yeah.

01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:19.471
Oh, this is science-y.

01:29:19.511 --> 01:29:21.331
Look at all that science happening in there, man.

01:29:21.371 --> 01:29:23.612
It's kind of a marvel of physics and engineering.

01:29:24.132 --> 01:29:25.292
Can you play Doom on this thing?

01:29:26.432 --> 01:29:28.933
Some of our computers, you'd be able to play at max settings.

01:29:31.476 --> 01:29:37.180
So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question, but why can't you just use a regular light microscope to take a picture of a protein?

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:46.647
Well, the wavelength of visible light is on the order of hundreds of nanometers, and that means the smallest things you can see with visible light are also on the scale of hundreds of nanometers.

01:29:47.287 --> 01:29:53.591
But what we want to see, the atoms in a protein molecule, they're angstroms apart, tenths of a nanometer.

01:29:53.932 --> 01:29:55.413
So we can't use visible light.

01:29:55.733 --> 01:29:58.415
We have to use a special electron microscope.

01:29:58.775 --> 01:30:07.218
So super high energy electrons make very tiny wavelengths, which lets you see very, very small resolution things.

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:07.618
That's right.

01:30:07.899 --> 01:30:08.239
Okay.

01:30:09.199 --> 01:30:10.339
I want a camera like that.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.740
That's better than 4K.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.801
We could go angstrom K.

01:30:14.381 --> 01:30:24.066
So, to take a 3D picture of a protein with a cryo-electron microscope, first you put a drop of protein onto a special metal grid, then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane.

01:30:24.386 --> 01:30:29.068
When we shoot a beam of electrons at it, these proteins will be in all kinds of random orientations.

01:30:29.468 --> 01:30:31.689
Each orientation leaves a particular shadow.

01:30:31.869 --> 01:30:37.372
Powerful computers look at all of those 2D images, and then combine them into a final 3D shape.

01:30:37.692 --> 01:30:41.174
It's kind of like using a bunch of 2D photos to make a 3D model.

01:30:41.914 --> 01:30:52.598
And when Jason and Daniel and their team looked at the spike that they made with their tiny little tweaks and mutations, their spike has the same 3D shape as the spike on the whole virus.

01:30:52.818 --> 01:30:53.258
Pretty cool.

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:55.339
Now we can put that spike into people.

01:30:56.379 --> 01:30:57.400
And how would they do that?

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.820
How would they determine that?

01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.321
Well, they would make the regular spike, I guess, right?

01:31:01.341 --> 01:31:01.641
Or what?

01:31:02.662 --> 01:31:08.004
Don't they have to make the spike on the virus and then compare that using the same methodology?

01:31:08.044 --> 01:31:10.805
Because if you can't take a picture of the viral spike,

01:31:11.658 --> 01:31:28.720
this way you see what that is that's that's strange that's a strange claim and they i because the assumption still is then that the process of doing the electron microscopy doesn't change the three-dimensional structure of the protein

01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:36.115
And keep in mind, if you had that three-dimensional image of the outside of a bunch of bananas, would you know anything about what they taste like?

01:31:36.155 --> 01:31:43.041
Are there a texture inside or the difference between the peel and the fruit part or where the seed is in the banana?

01:31:45.423 --> 01:31:50.567
And so they've got a three-dimensional shape and they've got a sequence.

01:31:50.807 --> 01:31:51.728
And then now what?

01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:58.203
They can now tell where all those proteins are, where all those amino acids are.

01:31:58.804 --> 01:32:05.806
There is really good hard science behind a lot of this stuff, but we have to trust it.

01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:17.789
We have to trust the experts that are doing this kind of science, that the resolution and the specificity and the fidelity of their measurements are what they say they are.

01:32:18.837 --> 01:32:35.560
And in the case of proteins and making pure protein and then doing this kind of thing, it makes sense to me that it's possible, although there should be some noise in the computer generated model that would be generated by that tail of incomplete, errored spike proteins.

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:38.861
I mean, it wasn't one stack, it was a smear.

01:32:39.521 --> 01:32:44.082
And so that smear should contribute to error in this three-dimensional model.

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:47.863
And again, you know, given what Robert Malone was able to accomplish with a

01:32:48.743 --> 01:32:52.486
And see if it trains their immune system and protects them from the real virus.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.041
It works.

01:33:15.701 --> 01:33:18.243
This protects people from COVID-19.

01:33:18.543 --> 01:33:25.930
The research you just saw from those scientists is literally what's being used in the very first COVID-19 vaccines.

01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:28.932
And some of those vaccines work in a really cool way.

01:33:29.412 --> 01:33:41.823
Instead of having to make the actual spike protein in these big factories with huge tanks of cells like the ones we saw, some of these new vaccines, the genetic instructions for making the spike is all that's in the shot.

01:33:42.503 --> 01:33:44.344
on a molecule called mRNA.

01:33:44.865 --> 01:33:47.767
Your body uses those instructions to make the spike.

01:33:48.447 --> 01:33:49.808
You are the factory.

01:33:50.529 --> 01:33:51.269
That's awesome.

01:33:51.750 --> 01:34:02.397
This is a really... See, that's a really big lie, because what he told you there is that what we just saw you making with the spike protein and those huge vats, he's implying that you don't need those.

01:34:02.437 --> 01:34:06.400
All you're just going to do is stop one step earlier.

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.841
You still need to make the huge vat of DNA.

01:34:09.662 --> 01:34:12.825
You still need to do the recombinant DNA part, wow.

01:34:28.061 --> 01:34:30.983
And some of those vaccines work in a really cool way.

01:34:31.463 --> 01:34:51.015
Instead of having to make the actual spike protein in these big factories with huge tanks of cells, like… Instead of having to make the spike protein in those factories with huge tanks of cells, which we never had to do, we do that with antibodies and we do that with venom and any other biologic we make.

01:34:54.634 --> 01:35:00.116
And we have to do that also to make enough DNA, to make enough RNA, to have enough RNA to inject in people.

01:35:00.596 --> 01:35:01.876
Still have to make it the same way.

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:10.579
They still had to go, as Vincent Rancid Yellow said in 2020, they still had to go from nanograms to kilograms, which is just amazing.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.901
Nanograms of DNA were the way they did it before the pandemic.

01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:22.903
And now they're doing it with, with grams of DNA, even kilograms.

01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.751
according to them.

01:35:43.351 --> 01:35:44.091
That's awesome.

01:35:44.471 --> 01:35:46.752
And this is a really incredible piece of science.

01:35:47.412 --> 01:35:50.353
A year ago, no one had ever seen this virus before.

01:35:50.553 --> 01:35:55.975
And thanks to these scientists, and thousands of others around the world, now we have vaccines that work.

01:35:56.475 --> 01:36:03.617
It's going to take months, maybe years, to get these vaccines, and the dozens of others still being worked on, to the billions of people that need them.

01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:05.858
And that's a huge challenge on its own.

01:36:06.418 --> 01:36:08.319
But this is a really hopeful story.

01:36:08.699 --> 01:36:12.020
No vaccine in history has ever been invented this fast.

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:14.621
And we were able to do it safely.

01:36:15.121 --> 01:36:21.344
We were able to do this so quickly because scientists like Jason and his lab and others, they were ready.

01:36:21.984 --> 01:36:27.587
Because they were studying basic scientific questions about other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS.

01:36:28.167 --> 01:36:34.210
They've spent years trying to figure out their secrets, so that when this one showed up, they were already 10 steps ahead.

01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:40.213
And to me, that's why work like this, supporting basic research, is so important.

01:36:40.973 --> 01:36:42.334
And why we need it.

01:36:43.968 --> 01:36:44.669
Stay curious.

01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:47.151
And get your vaccine.

01:36:47.551 --> 01:36:48.352
As soon as you can.

01:36:48.632 --> 01:36:50.534
I am really ready for this to be over.

01:36:51.254 --> 01:36:54.737
As always, a very special thank you to everyone who supports the show on Patreon.

01:36:55.197 --> 01:36:58.840
If you'd like to learn more about our community, there's a link down in the description where you can learn more.

01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:06.827
We really appreciate your support, and if you don't want to support us that way, we're just glad you're here learning with us this week, and I'll see you in the next video.

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:09.689
Who's there?

01:37:12.051 --> 01:37:12.772
Vaccinate who?

01:37:16.246 --> 01:37:17.006
That was pretty good.

01:37:18.407 --> 01:37:18.927
I'll keep you.

01:37:22.008 --> 01:37:23.588
Vaccinate everyone, it said.

01:37:24.268 --> 01:37:25.068
That was the joke.

01:37:25.949 --> 01:37:27.669
Vaccinate everyone, see it?

01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:35.371
Okay, so what I'm trying to give you the idea of, try to remind you of how hard they went.

01:37:35.771 --> 01:37:39.412
They went so hard in the paint that they just had people lying.

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:47.383
lying with confidence, lying with convincing faces, lying with transformers behind them to mislead the young.

01:37:48.084 --> 01:37:54.387
Over 2 million Americans are receiving vaccinations every day, fueling hope the end of the pandemic is near.

01:37:55.247 --> 01:38:03.071
But since the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in Wuhan, China 14 months ago, over 100 million people worldwide have been infected.

01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:09.354
And with each infection, the virus has had the chance to mutate into genetic offspring called variants.

01:38:10.194 --> 01:38:20.599
One of those variants, first identified in the UK, has spread across the US and is estimated to be 50% more transmissible than the original virus and likely more deadly.

01:38:21.679 --> 01:38:31.503
Nationwide, COVID-19 cases have fallen, but public health officials are warning if these variants continue to spread, they could trigger a new surge of infections.

01:38:33.224 --> 01:38:35.105
The story will continue in a moment.

01:38:38.877 --> 01:38:39.677
News the U.K.

01:38:39.717 --> 01:38:45.179
variant had reached American shores came last December at the University of California, San Diego.

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:56.004
The variant was found as part of an extensive coronavirus surveillance and testing system that has kept nearly 25,000 people living and working on campus.

01:38:58.284 --> 01:39:04.687
Vending machines designed to dispense candy bars now offer nasal swabs for COVID testing.

01:39:06.021 --> 01:39:10.262
And golf carts go on daily runs collecting samples taken from wastewater.

01:39:16.804 --> 01:39:29.048
Environmental engineer Smriti Kartikeyan showed us how robots placed near over 300 student dorms and research buildings suck up sewer samples, looking for early evidence someone might be infected with the virus.

01:39:29.609 --> 01:39:30.989
And if there's a positive, what happens?

01:39:31.445 --> 01:39:38.251
If there's a positive, they will send targeted notices saying, you're building, the wastewater has been positive, and please go get tested.

01:39:38.952 --> 01:39:51.083
Many positive samples from wastewater and nasal swabs are sent here to nearby Scripps Research, where infectious disease researcher Christian Anderson's lab performs genetic sequencing to identify any variations.

01:39:51.636 --> 01:39:53.817
It's really important that we keep an eye on the virus.

01:39:54.237 --> 01:39:55.177
How is it evolving?

01:39:55.517 --> 01:39:56.397
How is it transmitting?

01:39:56.437 --> 01:39:57.157
How is it changing?

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:07.360
Genetic sequences from around the world are constantly being analyzed in a database called Nextstrain that Anderson and other scientists use to visualize how variants are spreading.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.601
These are beautiful colors, but what am I looking at?

01:40:11.081 --> 01:40:12.642
You can think of this as a family tree.

01:40:13.002 --> 01:40:16.665
And what we have is down here, this is the first one in Wuhan.

01:40:17.065 --> 01:40:19.226
Viruses mutate over time.

01:40:19.786 --> 01:40:23.629
You see mutations coming up, and that's when you start getting these branching patterns.

01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:28.012
So then you have sisters and brothers here, and then you have aunts and uncles.

01:40:28.052 --> 01:40:30.873
And what's the practical use of having a tree like this?

01:40:31.214 --> 01:40:36.557
The practical use is that somebody like me can go in and just look at, like, how is this all related?

01:40:37.375 --> 01:40:43.560
Since the original virus was first identified in December 2019, thousands of variants have been documented.

01:40:44.181 --> 01:40:49.505
Anderson says scientists are keeping a close eye on three of them they call variants of concern.

01:40:49.846 --> 01:40:56.892
And that's the UK variant, which was, you can see here, was identified of dates back to about September of last year.

01:40:57.392 --> 01:41:00.835
And then all of a sudden you get a lot of these, and that's because it's more transmissible.

01:41:01.374 --> 01:41:08.517
So transmissible, the Centers for Disease Control has projected the UK variant will be the dominant strain in the US in the next month.

01:41:09.277 --> 01:41:17.580
The variants from Brazil, seen in red, and South Africa, seen in orange, have already spread to dozens of countries, including the US.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.462
Variants arise because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly making copies of itself.

01:41:24.263 --> 01:41:29.465
As it replicates, tiny mistakes or mutations can occur in its genetic code.

01:41:30.225 --> 01:41:32.307
They're rare and usually insignificant.

01:41:32.888 --> 01:41:38.495
But once in a while, one or more mutations team up to create a more dangerous variant of the virus.

01:41:39.035 --> 01:41:41.538
We are reading evolution's lab notebook.

01:41:42.399 --> 01:41:50.849
Every time one of these pops up, it's telling us exactly how evolution benefits at the expense of the fitness of humankind.

01:41:53.041 --> 01:42:03.065
It's not that dissimilar from the narrative that on the high wire, we heard from Andrew Huff that this virus is like 100,000 years in the future of evolution.

01:42:03.105 --> 01:42:10.348
And so we're really actually watching evolution that should have happened 100,000 years from now, but it's all happening right now in front of us, which is

01:42:11.766 --> 01:42:23.333
pretty extraordinary that this guitar playing folk song singing fake, who actually is part of the illusion of the Human Genome Project, right?

01:42:23.373 --> 01:42:28.636
This guy and his tenure extend all the way to the Human Genome Project.

01:42:28.656 --> 01:42:40.383
So he's part of the illusion where, yeah, we made some restriction enzyme maps of one or two genomes, and now we've made a, we've sequenced the whole genome, the human genome is done.

01:42:41.732 --> 01:42:43.434
It's just a great big, gigantic lie.

01:42:45.035 --> 01:42:51.682
And it won't be done for a very long time, and certainly not until they can start sampling people at will.

01:42:51.723 --> 01:43:02.254
Who knows, maybe they were taking samples from different buildings at those universities to see if they could get reliable genetic signals from the people in the building.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:15.838
such that they could compare dorm A to dorm B and see that, okay, well, our computers are finding the sequences of 30 humans here, and those are different than the 30 humans over here.

01:43:17.365 --> 01:43:35.750
Once they have you believing that taking sewer samples is for the virus, and you say, okay, well, I guess the virus exists, then you're never ever going to question the possibility that maybe they're gonna see if they can sequence everybody that lives in a dorm by just taking the sewer sample, and then they never have to sequence anybody anymore.

01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:45.052
Or maybe they can take all of the tests from the people that are in that dorm, and then use those tests as a way of seeing what information is available.

01:43:45.532 --> 01:43:46.293
in the sewer sample.

01:43:46.333 --> 01:43:49.217
There's lots of things they could be doing here.

01:43:49.678 --> 01:43:54.024
And the illusion of consensus created by this video is it's just to save us from a pandemic.

01:43:54.084 --> 01:43:59.491
It could have nothing to do with the 20 year project that this guy's been the head of, the Human Genome Project.

01:44:01.104 --> 01:44:09.368
Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, is a geneticist who 20 years ago oversaw the decoding of the human genome.

01:44:10.148 --> 01:44:13.409
He says he's surprised by how much this virus is evolving.

01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:18.672
Why are the variants of concern that we're seeing in places like the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil

01:44:19.412 --> 01:44:20.532
of such concern.

01:44:20.872 --> 01:44:29.975
It turns out that some of these mutations actually change the behavior of this virus in a way that makes it more infectious or more serious.

01:44:30.495 --> 01:44:43.579
And the evidence is that for both the B.1.1.7, which is primarily seen in the U.K., but increasingly in the U.S., and the South African B.1.3.5.1, that they are more transmissible.

01:44:43.619 --> 01:44:44.959
They're just really successful.

01:44:44.979 --> 01:44:46.620
We're seeing evolution in motion.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:52.701
I think it's been rarely seen as clearly as right now how evolution works.

01:44:53.101 --> 01:44:54.841
In that way, it was pretty predictable.

01:44:54.901 --> 01:45:07.724
What wasn't predictable, for me anyway, was that there would be so many copies of this virus that even a slow evolutionary process could, in just a matter of a few months, produce some viruses that we're worried about.

01:45:08.224 --> 01:45:15.665
And there are so many copies because... It's a pandemic, and it's been very successful in infecting millions and millions of people.

01:45:15.945 --> 01:45:18.426
These samples were from the patient's lung.

01:45:18.606 --> 01:45:24.347
An early clue about how the virus was mutating came last summer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

01:45:25.107 --> 01:45:37.290
Infectious disease specialist Dr. Ghadi Haidar says a cancer patient with a compromised immune system came in with a COVID-19 infection that persisted for over 70 days, far beyond the typical few weeks.

01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:43.691
We had no idea at the time that people could still be actively infectious for that long.

01:45:43.951 --> 01:45:52.955
And it really wasn't until after he passed away that we started running some additional testing on samples that he had allowed us to collect from him when he was alive.

01:45:53.395 --> 01:46:00.758
And that's when we found that the virus really quickly began to develop all these deletions and mutations throughout the patient's life.

01:46:01.399 --> 01:46:05.300
This electron microscope image shows a sample taken from the patient's windpipe.

01:46:05.921 --> 01:46:09.642
Tiny spheres looked like the original virus from Wuhan, China.

01:46:10.343 --> 01:46:13.004
But genetic sequencing revealed a different story.

01:46:13.683 --> 01:46:16.086
There were small gaps where information should be.

01:46:17.448 --> 01:46:23.777
Irish-born University of Pittsburgh virologist Paul Dupre says the UK variant has some of these same deletions.

01:46:26.461 --> 01:46:30.466
Irish-born Paul Dupre is, in my humble opinion, a prick.

01:46:31.864 --> 01:46:45.541
At the beginning of the pandemic, when I was still fully invested in the idea of a lab leak, he put out a paper where they showed a animal model of infection and showed that they were finding spike protein in the brain.

01:46:46.502 --> 01:46:49.967
And I sent him an email and the first author an email

01:46:51.611 --> 01:47:03.496
asking, listen to this carefully, asking if I could see their better images of where it's found in the brain because I was really curious and I was still employed at the university at the time.

01:47:04.976 --> 01:47:12.359
His reply to me was that I should know better than assuming that the first author isn't also a professor and I was confused.

01:47:13.936 --> 01:47:22.792
But he was actually scolding me in his reply because I had said, dear Professor Dupree and Dr. somebody or other.

01:47:24.295 --> 01:47:27.836
thinking that that somebody or other was a postdoc, but not a professor.

01:47:28.336 --> 01:47:38.539
And he tried to come to her rescue by saying that I was being sexist in the email by not assuming that she was also a professor, even though she was the first author on the paper.

01:47:38.599 --> 01:47:43.740
And oftentimes first authors are not professors, they're postdocs, they're PhD students.

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:45.100
I made an assumption, sorry.

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.742
But since we're in a pandemic and we're talking about your recent science paper or big paper,

01:47:51.562 --> 01:48:03.914
It seems so random and off the hook to make it a sexist thing instead of, oh yeah, by the way, she's also a professor in my department and here's the data that you're really interested in.

01:48:03.934 --> 01:48:05.716
Let us know if you need anything else.

01:48:06.837 --> 01:48:15.406
He was a gigantic prick and said he would never collaborate with somebody who behaved in such an unprofessional manner.

01:48:17.706 --> 01:48:24.448
I actually called her doctor instead of professor and that was the thing that was wrong and condemned me from ever seeing any of his data.

01:48:24.928 --> 01:48:37.552
This guy at the start of the pandemic was trying to make a combination measles with a coronavirus spike on it so that he would have a coronavirus and measles vaccine all in one.

01:48:37.732 --> 01:48:38.852
I shit you not.

01:48:48.038 --> 01:48:52.659
leaving some scientists to believe it may have started in an immunocompromised patient.

01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:58.201
When you have a patient who is sick for so long, there's the opportunity for the virus to replicate.

01:48:58.221 --> 01:48:59.541
He's such a dick.

01:48:59.681 --> 01:49:01.842
And every time a virus has that opportunity.

01:49:01.862 --> 01:49:02.362
So fake!

01:49:02.622 --> 01:49:05.003
There's also an opportunity for it to make a mistake, right?

01:49:05.443 --> 01:49:07.664
And that's how viruses change.

01:49:08.064 --> 01:49:13.326
Those mistakes give the virus just a little bit of a competitive edge.

01:49:13.666 --> 01:49:14.186
For example,

01:49:15.026 --> 01:49:16.507
Can it get into a cell better?

01:49:17.107 --> 01:49:18.207
Dupre says yes.

01:49:18.667 --> 01:49:20.788
He used this animation to show us how.

01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:28.611
It starts with the spike protein, seen in red, which the virus uses to latch onto and enter a human cell.

01:49:29.172 --> 01:49:35.394
So if you've been infected, you'll make antibodies, these blue molecules that bind to the outside of the virus spike.

01:49:36.074 --> 01:49:40.476
And what they do is they block the virus getting into the cell.

01:49:40.676 --> 01:49:42.017
They can't bind the receptor.

01:49:42.737 --> 01:49:49.165
Now, if you talk like an Irishman, you don't sound any smarter if you say stupid things.

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:52.889
And my accents are terrible, so I won't do that.

01:49:52.949 --> 01:49:55.091
But, oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

01:49:56.353 --> 01:50:02.260
Just because he says it in a charming, or some people think it's charming, I find it annoying as hell.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.523
Just because he says it in a charming accent doesn't make it any smarter.

01:50:08.563 --> 01:50:15.990
The antibodies are... He's an NIH, DOD, NIAID lap dog.

01:50:17.691 --> 01:50:18.732
He is pathetic.

01:50:19.833 --> 01:50:21.255
And he's a useful idiot.

01:50:22.075 --> 01:50:23.617
There's no question in my mind.

01:50:24.558 --> 01:50:31.404
That's why when I asked him for the data, he said that I should call the girl a professor because, you know, I'm sexist.

01:50:33.032 --> 01:50:36.773
This guy is playing their game as best he possibly can.

01:50:38.273 --> 01:50:42.074
Trying to climb the university academia ladder as best he can.

01:50:42.334 --> 01:50:46.575
The highest route, the fastest route to the top, infectious disease.

01:50:47.896 --> 01:50:51.116
No different than Christian Anderson that we saw earlier in the same video.

01:50:51.656 --> 01:51:02.619
The same level of molecular biological scammer who wittingly or unwittingly is perpetuating this narrative of RNA virology.

01:51:04.857 --> 01:51:23.352
that has only reached the stage that it has in modern age because of the technology that was developed during the Human Genome Project, was perfected and industrialized during the Human Genome Project, and that is making DNA, you know, 3,000 base pairs at a time.

01:51:23.932 --> 01:51:26.474
They can do that and making lots of it.

01:51:26.514 --> 01:51:31.898
They can do that and they can sequence DNA that's about that long.

01:51:31.938 --> 01:51:32.559
They can do that.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:40.466
And that technology is all the technology that's required in order for this molecular illusion of a pandemic to have been created.

01:51:40.866 --> 01:51:56.040
And for these jackasses to agree about it, or to be so inept in their, their ability to see the boundary of the irreducible complexity that is our sacred biology, that they are actually, they are incapable of knowing.

01:51:57.661 --> 01:52:01.004
This guy could be incapable of knowing he could be used, but

01:52:03.976 --> 01:52:05.777
Yeah, it's disturbing.

01:52:07.118 --> 01:52:10.199
Variant, the yellow, illustrating the variant.

01:52:10.239 --> 01:52:12.180
The antibodies can no longer bind.

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:21.444
The virus is able to attach to that receptor, latch on, and bingo, that person gets infected.

01:52:21.924 --> 01:52:24.806
Is there anything we can do to stop the virus from mutating so much?

01:52:25.666 --> 01:52:42.979
i don't understand he's talking like if i were to talk like this and the variant that you see in yellow then binds and you see it's now connected and then prevented and so then you have an infection

01:52:44.397 --> 01:52:48.240
but he's talking in an Irish accent, which even makes it more slappable.

01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:49.240
I don't get it.

01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:51.602
This is just ridiculous is what it is.

01:52:52.523 --> 01:53:02.089
60 Minutes, the exact same program that promoted George Webb and that Robert Malone promoted.

01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:04.931
Yeah, see it now?

01:53:05.372 --> 01:53:09.915
That promoted Peter Daszak and that promoted Nathan Wolff.

01:53:10.788 --> 01:53:11.068
See it.

01:53:11.628 --> 01:53:17.490
We can certainly stop it making as many mutations by stopping it infecting as many people.

01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:24.872
If we block its transmission, if we wear a mask, if we get vaccinated, if we do social distancing, so there's a practical thing that we can do.

01:53:25.392 --> 01:53:28.393
But physically, biologically, is there something that we can do?

01:53:28.473 --> 01:53:32.234
Is there a magic bullet that we can shoot at it that stops it making mutations?

01:53:34.315 --> 01:53:44.964
To understand the threat posed by mutations, public health... So the agreement, the illusion of consensus is that the mutations will be a source of danger going into the future.

01:53:46.646 --> 01:53:51.830
This is also the narrative that Gerrit van den Bosch was brought on the scene in late 2020 to start and fuel.

01:53:55.151 --> 01:54:05.080
This was also in late 2020 and early 2021 is when I started saying the same thing, mainly because Luigi Warren sent me a paper about Marek's disease.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:11.505
And I came to the conclusion myself that, wow, if this vaccine works the way they say it works, then the virus is going to change.

01:54:11.926 --> 01:54:12.666
Holy shit.

01:54:14.148 --> 01:54:16.069
There's a guy in Belgium saying the same thing.

01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:17.110
Holy cow.

01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:17.911
I'm convinced.

01:54:21.772 --> 01:54:28.778
Luigi Warren is a guy who is part of the intellectual property ladder in Moderna.

01:54:29.959 --> 01:54:37.745
He was featured in a foldout in the USA Today in 2020, and he was a member of the original drastic.

01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:51.376
And ever since we started talking about transfections, he has been largely focused on American politics and not at all talking about the transfection technology that has surely injured many and killed many.

01:54:53.191 --> 01:55:00.474
It's just one of the many little coinkydinks quirks of the drastic team that they never really saved anybody.

01:55:00.514 --> 01:55:04.136
And Luigi Warren, unfortunately, is one of those people that never saved anybody.

01:55:04.516 --> 01:55:16.581
And the last communication I had with him was about a paper about Marek's disease trying to hint to me that I needed to talk about the fact that the transfection was gonna make the virus change in a very scary way.

01:55:17.161 --> 01:55:18.182
It could even get worse.

01:55:19.462 --> 01:55:20.983
And so I wrote a review about it.

01:55:24.468 --> 01:55:26.209
We were played, ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:26.269 --> 01:55:27.649
I was played like a puppet.

01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:32.812
I just didn't understand how many people were strings instead of friends.

01:55:34.532 --> 01:55:36.293
Wow, that's the best I've ever expressed it.

01:55:37.393 --> 01:55:38.774
I was played like a puppet.

01:55:38.834 --> 01:55:42.295
I just didn't understand how many people were strings rather than friends.

01:55:43.416 --> 01:55:52.940
But almost all of my so-called friends in 2020 and 2021 were inevitably new strings being put in me, in my shoulders and in my heart.

01:55:56.932 --> 01:56:04.355
And people who were skillfully using TV or social media were also having strings put in their heart.

01:56:05.715 --> 01:56:08.456
Experts are studying the Brazilian city of Manaus.

01:56:09.116 --> 01:56:14.338
Last spring, COVID swept through the population, leaving about 70% infected.

01:56:15.018 --> 01:56:18.940
As a result, some researchers believe the city had reached herd immunity.

01:56:19.858 --> 01:56:26.261
But then, starting this past December, epidemiologists suspect thousands were reinfected with the Brazilian variant.

01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:28.682
Hospitals there were overwhelmed.

01:56:29.302 --> 01:56:32.564
Health officials reported up to 150 deaths a day.

01:56:33.164 --> 01:56:40.107
And a recent study suggests the variant is more infectious than earlier strains and may be better at evading antibodies.

01:56:40.767 --> 01:56:52.790
At Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Dr. David Ho, known for his groundbreaking HIV research, is now working to identify which variants are present in New York City.

01:56:53.470 --> 01:57:00.252
Since January, his team has analyzed over 2,000 nasal swabs taken from people who had tested positive for COVID-19.

01:57:01.365 --> 01:57:08.849
What was unexpected was there were only sporadic cases, the UK, Brazilian and South African variants.

01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:12.811
But instead we noticed that we had a homegrown variant.

01:57:13.252 --> 01:57:13.792
Something new.

01:57:14.312 --> 01:57:18.014
Something new that was dominating and rising.

01:57:18.054 --> 01:57:24.598
And so they're creating an illusion of consensus that around the world there are different variants and all these scientists agree about it.

01:57:24.638 --> 01:57:25.618
Isn't it extraordinary?

01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:26.679
Very rapidly.

01:57:27.019 --> 01:57:28.060
How rapidly is it growing?

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.301
it's over 20 percent.

01:57:30.642 --> 01:57:31.683
Over 20 percent.

01:57:31.903 --> 01:57:34.705
So that's a rapid rise in the last couple of months.

01:57:35.126 --> 01:57:39.089
Dr. Ho says the New York City variant is doubling roughly every two weeks.

01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:47.377
And city health officials announced this past week they found the variant in 39 percent of the COVID-19 samples they recently sequenced.

01:57:47.737 --> 01:57:53.162
Dr. Ho is concerned because that variant shares a key mutation with one found in South Africa.

01:57:54.386 --> 01:57:58.149
Several studies have looked at the effect- The one in South Africa might be Omicron.

01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.930
In the U.S.

01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:00.751
against that South African variant.

01:58:01.612 --> 01:58:09.598
Both in laboratory tests and clinical trials, the vaccines appear to be somewhat less effective at eliciting an immune response or preventing infection.

01:58:10.519 --> 01:58:17.004
But the companies anticipate the vaccines will still provide protection from severe disease from that South African variant.

01:58:17.585 --> 01:58:22.609
What people are worried about is, I got a vaccine, I thought I was safe, and now you're talking about all these variants.

01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.650
Where am I?

01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:25.341
I'm in the same boat.

01:58:25.762 --> 01:58:34.473
I got vaccinated and I felt protected for a while until we realized there was so much of the homegrown variant in New York.

01:58:35.053 --> 01:58:37.657
How do you put this in perspective for people who are watching this right now?

01:58:38.237 --> 01:58:40.520
I think we have to be a bit concerned.

01:58:41.161 --> 01:58:43.562
But that doesn't say the vaccines don't work.

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:47.445
Even in South Africa, the vaccines still work to some extent.

01:58:47.505 --> 01:58:52.548
It's just not as highly protective as we had against the original strain.

01:58:52.908 --> 01:59:00.452
In addition, vaccine may not protect against infection, but may protect against disease or death.

01:59:01.093 --> 01:59:06.596
Dr. Collins says so far, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear effective against the UK variant.

01:59:07.236 --> 01:59:16.479
And this past week, a small laboratory study found the Pfizer vaccine elicited the same strong immune response against the Brazilian variant as against the original virus.

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:22.342
Drug companies say they are working to retool their vaccines and create booster shots as needed.

01:59:22.562 --> 01:59:24.322
It's a really weird way he said that.

01:59:28.006 --> 01:59:34.316
The virus created a robust, or the vaccine created a robust immune response against the variant.

01:59:34.356 --> 01:59:36.199
I don't, that's a really weird way to say it.

01:59:36.239 --> 01:59:38.122
I won't bother to go back, sorry.

01:59:39.028 --> 01:59:40.468
to keep up with the variants.

01:59:41.208 --> 01:59:44.389
What keeps you up at night in terms of the variants down the line?

01:59:44.969 --> 01:59:57.252
If I have an anxiety, it's that something worse than the South African variant is out there that will get to the point where the vaccines no longer appear to be fully protective against a bad outcome.

01:59:57.932 --> 02:00:03.173
And that will certainly drive us then to do a redesign of the vaccines as quick as we can.

02:00:03.613 --> 02:00:10.835
Recently, a variant has been found in New York City that has some of the characteristics of the variant of concern found in South Africa.

02:00:11.415 --> 02:00:21.978
I'm not, on the surface of it, overly alarmed about that, but it's going to deserve a real lab experiment to make sure that our vaccines would still provide immunity against that.

02:00:22.838 --> 02:00:27.082
Oh yeah, that's right, Botswana, good call.

02:00:27.222 --> 02:00:32.306
And then they actually weren't sequenced in Botswana, right?

02:00:32.346 --> 02:00:37.009
They came back to Belgium or something and then they actually were, that's right, good one, good call.

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.440
There cannot be a filter.

02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:48.141
I will not stand for that.

02:00:48.221 --> 02:00:49.441
Neither will Dr. Fauci.

02:00:50.161 --> 02:01:02.705
And absolutely, if we ever come across as having the truth of the matter distorted by what is politically or economically convenient, then we will have lost the public trust.

02:01:03.005 --> 02:01:13.168
Isn't that funny that he would say that, knowing full well that he was going to get exposed as having sent emails that said, we got to do a devastating takedown on Jay Bhattacharya?

02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:15.931
Can you see how scripted that is now?

02:01:16.792 --> 02:01:20.414
There's no way that that's by accident.

02:01:20.554 --> 02:01:34.344
It is to make sure that those two videos could be put together at some point in time to show you exactly how crazy the Scooby-Doo mystery is that he was so bold as to go on to 60 Minutes and say that Tony Fauci would never hide anything.

02:01:34.664 --> 02:01:36.705
Of course Tony Fauci wouldn't hide anything.

02:01:37.006 --> 02:01:37.906
He's a great guy.

02:01:38.307 --> 02:01:40.328
I wouldn't stand for it and neither would Tony.

02:01:41.909 --> 02:01:43.310
Oh my gosh, they're lying.

02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.909
Hilarious.

02:01:50.131 --> 02:01:55.095
Dr. Collins says right now we have a window of opportunity.

02:01:55.255 --> 02:02:04.403
And that Americans need to get vaccinated, avoid large gatherings, and wear masks to prevent the virus from spreading and mutating even more.

02:02:05.023 --> 02:02:08.527
To continue to hear that this isn't over yet,

02:02:09.506 --> 02:02:11.927
has got to be a hard thing for all of us.

02:02:12.467 --> 02:02:14.367
I don't want to sound so pessimistic, though.

02:02:15.088 --> 02:02:16.988
We are making amazing progress.

02:02:17.408 --> 02:02:21.029
We just got to hang on and don't blow it at the end.

02:02:21.509 --> 02:02:26.131
If you're the guy running for the finish line, don't trip right there on the 10-yard line.

02:02:26.571 --> 02:02:28.251
Try to get all the way to the goal.

02:02:29.051 --> 02:02:29.812
We can see it.

02:02:30.372 --> 02:02:31.212
We are going to get there.

02:02:31.592 --> 02:02:35.013
But this is not the moment to relax or stop running hard.

02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:39.043
I would say that's the case for sure for us right now.

02:02:39.124 --> 02:02:40.926
It's not the case we have to get across.

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:42.588
Where did the virus that changed the world?

02:02:42.668 --> 02:02:43.930
Oh, that was going to be Fauci there.

02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:46.173
Where did the virus that changed the world come from?

02:02:47.036 --> 02:02:50.798
So Reason TV is a Bret Weinstein spin-off.

02:02:50.878 --> 02:02:54.140
It's underneath Joe Rogan and Bret Weinstein and the Intellectual Dark Web.

02:02:54.260 --> 02:03:05.346
One of the first scientists to question this narrative was Botao Zhao, who on February 6th distributed a paper arguing that the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.

02:03:05.786 --> 02:03:10.829
The author pointed out that there was no evidence that the vendors at the wet market in Wuhan sold bat meat.

02:03:11.209 --> 02:03:16.671
On the other hand, there were two research labs studying bat-borne coronaviruses located in Wuhan.

02:03:16.871 --> 02:03:21.773
So this is eight months ago, and he's showing you how he solved the lab leak.

02:03:21.953 --> 02:03:28.955
Bo Tao Xiao withdrew the paper two weeks later, after Chinese authorities declared that the lab leak theory had no merit.

02:03:29.215 --> 02:03:33.077
China is being accused of censoring critical data about the coronavirus.

02:03:33.137 --> 02:03:44.481
The renowned law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, Xu Jiangrun, is known to be missing after publicly condemning Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to contain the spread of the virus at an early stage.

02:03:44.741 --> 02:03:48.905
The Chinese government proceeded to clamp down on research into the virus's origins.

02:03:49.006 --> 02:03:54.772
New regulations restricting the publication of research about coronavirus.

02:03:55.212 --> 02:03:59.456
Any paper that traces the origin of the virus should be strictly managed.

02:04:00.017 --> 02:04:10.647
To this day, the Chinese government won't allow outside researchers to test blood drawn from employees of the Wuhan lab, who may have been among the first humans infected with COVID in November of 2019.

02:04:12.048 --> 02:04:16.532
According to the official record, they were hospitalized with a pneumonia-like disease.

02:04:17.233 --> 02:04:29.002
There's no proof that the virus originated from a lab, but there's also no proof that humans first became infected by eating bat or exposure to pangolins, a theory that was treated as unimpeachable fact early in the pandemic.

02:04:29.383 --> 02:04:38.010
A group of scientists signed a statement published in The Lancet denouncing speculation about non-natural origins of the virus as conspiracy theories.

02:04:38.630 --> 02:04:51.893
Only after some emails became public did it become clear that the scientist who brought his colleagues together to co-sign the Lancet statement was Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance, the nonprofit that secured U.S.

02:04:51.933 --> 02:04:57.934
government funding for controversial research on bat-borne coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

02:04:58.334 --> 02:05:04.835
Daszak also co-authored a June 2020 op-ed in The Guardian headlined, Ignore the Conspiracy Theories.

02:05:05.175 --> 02:05:08.116
Scientists know COVID-19 wasn't created in a lab.

02:05:08.977 --> 02:05:11.559
So that's how they played us, right?

02:05:11.599 --> 02:05:14.382
They went over the top on both sides.

02:05:15.082 --> 02:05:15.983
That's how they played us.

02:05:16.043 --> 02:05:16.884
It's a scooby-doo.

02:05:16.964 --> 02:05:18.706
It was a theater all along.

02:05:28.235 --> 02:05:32.859
That episode does not reflect well on scientists.

02:05:32.899 --> 02:05:39.504
And then that guy is the guy who wrote a book with Alina Chan, the Canadian who had a preprint that never got printed.

02:05:39.584 --> 02:05:57.818
And that was enough for her to get a permanent position at the Broad Institute, which is at MIT, where Matt Lander works, the former boss of the Human Genome Project people that used to work underneath Francis Collins, of course, as they just told you, and also worked closely with none other than Kevin McKernan.

02:05:59.872 --> 02:06:09.879
It's writer Matt Ridley says that Anthony Fauci's private emails, which were made public through a Freedom of Information Act request, show that behind the scenes, scientists were taking the lab leak theory seriously all along.

02:06:10.219 --> 02:06:19.446
A number of leading virologists were talking to each other and were saying to each other, we think this might look a bit like a... So keep in mind that Canadian

02:06:21.673 --> 02:06:29.496
Chinese, Alina Chan, and a British guy named Matt Ridley are the ones who make the lab leak book first, right?

02:06:29.536 --> 02:06:30.336
Just think about it.

02:06:30.376 --> 02:06:34.878
It's all five eyes, controlled demolition of the idea of America.

02:06:34.918 --> 02:06:36.459
That's what it is.

02:06:37.199 --> 02:06:45.162
And any bastion of freedom loving sovereign citizens of the UK, because that's the other problem they have.

02:06:45.902 --> 02:06:47.066
engineered in the laboratory.

02:06:47.347 --> 02:06:50.897
And then they all got on a phone call with Anthony Fauci.

02:06:51.318 --> 02:06:52.722
And at the end of that phone call,

02:06:53.433 --> 02:06:58.817
They all did a very rapid vault pass and started writing articles almost immediately.

02:06:59.218 --> 02:07:06.083
And in the case of Peter Daszak, the fact that he had orchestrated the letter was not at all clear until emails were leaked.

02:07:06.524 --> 02:07:10.747
Does raise very serious concerns that Dr. Daszak needs to answer.

02:07:11.448 --> 02:07:14.070
I've tried to correspond with him numerous times.

02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:18.013
I've never yet had a raise very serious concerns that.

02:07:18.294 --> 02:07:20.095
So here you see Stanley Perlman.

02:07:20.135 --> 02:07:21.896
Stanley Perlman actually worked with the

02:07:22.717 --> 02:07:28.180
with the husband of Li Min Yan unless Mark Kulak is off his rocker.

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:50.014
So that Stanley Perlman is also the guy that I've cited in all of my early immunology 101 lectures about coronavirus because his seminal papers about the original SARS virus in 2004 and five and six are all about T cell immunity being paramount and primary.

02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:58.945
with regard to whether or not an animal model of coronavirus infection is successful and surviving is T cells.

02:07:58.985 --> 02:08:04.168
So, all these are very interesting names that we know and known for a while.

02:08:04.728 --> 02:08:15.014
Kristen Dorsten is the guy who did the PCR test for the first SARS and for this one, working closely with a guy by the name of Pottinger, I believe, at some point, or Pottinger was around

02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.981
for both of those viruses as well.

02:08:19.141 --> 02:08:26.763
And William Koresh, I think, is the original founder of EcoHealth Alliance back when it was called the World Wildlife something, something.

02:08:28.003 --> 02:08:29.223
We could go on and on and on.

02:08:29.283 --> 02:08:30.624
Leo Poon, interesting.

02:08:30.664 --> 02:08:36.145
That's actually the boss of EcoHealth Alliance.

02:08:38.419 --> 02:08:39.180
of Li Min Yan.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:42.164
So yeah, we're really pretty deep in the rabbit hole at this point.

02:08:42.204 --> 02:08:43.206
I mean, I don't even know what to say.

02:08:43.646 --> 02:08:45.469
Dr. Daszak needs to answer.

02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:48.773
I've tried to correspond with him numerous times.

02:08:48.974 --> 02:08:50.896
I've never yet had a response.

02:08:51.197 --> 02:08:53.860
Daszak also didn't reply to Reason's interview request.

02:08:54.361 --> 02:08:59.205
Ridley has co-authored Viral, a new book about the ongoing hunt for the origins of the coronavirus.

02:08:59.765 --> 02:09:08.872
His writing partner is Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard scientist Alina Chan, one of the earliest and most outspoken public skeptics of the natural origin hypothesis.

02:09:09.212 --> 02:09:14.416
She says that when she and her colleagues... She was actually five months behind most of us, but that's okay.

02:09:14.496 --> 02:09:14.957
Go ahead.

02:09:15.037 --> 02:09:15.617
Promote her.

02:09:15.637 --> 02:09:17.198
That's wonderful.

02:09:17.298 --> 02:09:21.782
...published a preprint questioning the consensus that she hadn't been aware of the Lancet letter

02:09:22.122 --> 02:09:28.646
So she published a preprint, they even acknowledge it, which never got published, but somehow she still got hired by MIT.

02:09:29.067 --> 02:09:31.548
That's not usually how science works.

02:09:31.849 --> 02:09:38.133
Organized by Daszak, but that she believes it could have had a major chilling effect on the scientific discussion in those early days.

02:09:38.573 --> 02:09:42.676
So they're saying that anyone who's saying that this virus didn't come from nature is a conspiracy theorist.

02:09:42.716 --> 02:09:48.580
People, when they read this letter, they might have thought, then I'm not going to put my neck out there to say that this might have come from a lab.

02:09:48.976 --> 02:09:51.478
Chan, a molecular biologist, argued in the paper.

02:09:51.538 --> 02:09:59.305
It's funny because she wasn't, she's a Canadian and she wasn't at, as a scientist at the beginning and when she wrote that she was just a postdoc.

02:10:00.137 --> 02:10:02.957
So they promoted her for a preprint that never got published.

02:10:03.017 --> 02:10:04.438
That's really what we're seeing here.

02:10:04.898 --> 02:10:10.999
Or that because SARS-CoV-2 was so well adapted to humans, there was reason to be skeptical that it had recently come from an animal.

02:10:11.159 --> 02:10:20.180
If it had recently come from bats or pangolins, she would have expected the virus to have been rapidly mutating in the early days of the pandemic to become better adapted to human tissue.

02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:29.322
For me, the light bulb moment was when I read in the news that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared genetically stable.

02:10:29.724 --> 02:10:36.706
Chan credits this insight partially to her experience living through the SARS outbreak of 2003, which she lived through in Singapore.

02:10:37.207 --> 02:10:43.689
In that situation, in that outbreak, the virus had rapidly picked up dozens of mutations in the early three months of the outbreak.

02:10:43.829 --> 02:10:47.370
In comparison, for SARS-CoV-2, there were very few of these mutations.

02:10:47.770 --> 02:10:57.474
So it suggested to me that this virus had already picked up many useful mutations for infecting and transmitting amongst humans prior to its detection in December 2019.

02:10:58.354 --> 02:11:08.043
Another major difference is that during the 2003 outbreak, authorities discovered previous SARS infections among animals being sold at markets in South China within a couple of months.

02:11:08.523 --> 02:11:13.648
That's not the case with SARS-CoV-2, despite initial suspicions that a seafood market was to blame.

02:11:14.028 --> 02:11:23.911
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, even though the first cluster of cases identified was at the seafood market, they never found any signs of animals that were infected by this virus.

02:11:24.011 --> 02:11:30.633
So up till today, there's no sign of an animal that was ever infected by SARS-CoV-2 and then gave it to humans.

02:11:31.004 --> 02:11:40.430
When the World Health Organization sent a team to investigate the virus's origins in January 2021, EcoHealth Alliance's Dajak was the only American member included.

02:11:40.751 --> 02:11:45.194
The team dismissed the lab leak hypothesis before WHO leadership later backtracked.

02:11:45.214 --> 02:11:45.734
There she is.

02:11:45.954 --> 02:11:51.418
The findings suggest that the laboratory incident hypothesis

02:11:52.916 --> 02:12:12.601
is extremely unlikely and to explain the introduction of the virus into the human population, and, therefore, is not a hypothesis that will suggest that will implies to suggest future studies.

02:12:12.841 --> 02:12:18.842
Dajak granted an interview to 60 Minutes following that trip to Wuhan and suggested that farm animals were the likely culprit.

02:12:19.144 --> 02:12:25.649
But there's no direct evidence that any of those animals were actually infected with the bat virus.

02:12:26.110 --> 02:12:26.530
Correct.

02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:35.618
Now what we've got to do is go to those farms and investigate, talk to the farmers, talk to their relatives, test them, see if there were spikes in virus there first.

02:12:35.958 --> 02:12:42.744
So the team doesn't actually know if any of the farmers or the truckers were ever infected.

02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:43.880
No one knows yet.

02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:44.761
No one's been there.

02:12:44.861 --> 02:12:45.521
No one's asked them.

02:12:45.581 --> 02:12:46.381
No one's tested them.

02:12:46.501 --> 02:12:47.241
That's to be done.

02:12:47.481 --> 02:12:52.243
There's a detail that emerged after the 60 Minutes report that Ridley would like Daszak to explain.

02:12:52.783 --> 02:13:01.526
Recently leaked documents show that EcoHealth Alliance applied for a research grant related to inserting what's called a furin cleavage site into SARS-like coronaviruses.

02:13:01.826 --> 02:13:11.569
This very furin cleavage site makes SARS-CoV-2 highly infectious in humans, and it's what distinguishes it from any SARS-like coronaviruses yet found in the wild.

02:13:11.849 --> 02:13:15.572
Now imagine again that there were thousands of these podcasts, right?

02:13:15.732 --> 02:13:16.653
Thousands of them.

02:13:17.414 --> 02:13:22.538
Including Sky News Australia doing a whole documentary about the exact same thing.

02:13:23.258 --> 02:13:27.342
Using all kinds of crazy music, all kinds of crazy cuts.

02:13:28.643 --> 02:13:33.767
The live escape version is so freaking likely.

02:13:34.007 --> 02:13:35.729
One way or the other it came out of Wuhan.

02:13:36.482 --> 02:13:39.364
The logical next step is whether the U.S.

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:42.226
contributed to this pandemic starting.

02:13:43.907 --> 02:13:47.089
Researchers in the Chinese government were on U.S.

02:13:47.129 --> 02:13:48.049
government payroll.

02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:51.151
The consequences are enormous.

02:13:51.792 --> 02:13:56.135
No accident like this has ever happened in human history.

02:13:57.576 --> 02:14:02.419
Scientific debate about the origins of COVID was actively suppressed.

02:14:03.559 --> 02:14:05.641
One's tempted to use the word conspiracy.

02:14:11.024 --> 02:14:11.084
you

02:14:24.107 --> 02:14:25.968
This is what Australia is doing to us.

02:14:26.028 --> 02:14:28.308
This is what Australia is doing to the UK.

02:14:28.849 --> 02:14:32.430
This is what the Five Eyes countries are doing to each other.

02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:36.151
Have been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate.

02:14:36.891 --> 02:14:42.573
Scientists, government officials, and intelligence agencies at first insisted.

02:14:42.813 --> 02:14:44.114
She's basically an actor.

02:14:44.154 --> 02:14:45.574
They're all basically actors.

02:14:45.634 --> 02:14:46.735
They're doing their show.

02:14:46.775 --> 02:14:48.275
They're doing their thing.

02:14:48.675 --> 02:14:50.056
They are not biologists.

02:14:50.096 --> 02:14:51.136
They're not teachers.

02:14:51.196 --> 02:14:52.677
They're not mystery solvers.

02:14:53.297 --> 02:14:54.377
They are journalists.

02:14:54.577 --> 02:14:57.218
They say, they tell you what they were told.

02:14:58.058 --> 02:14:59.799
They tell you what they think they saw.

02:14:59.859 --> 02:15:00.319
That's it.

02:15:00.399 --> 02:15:01.459
That's all they can do.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.600
They are limited by the questions that they ask.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.101
And more importantly, they are limited by the people that they talk to.

02:15:10.822 --> 02:15:19.384
And since there is already a system in place to determine who they talk to, a funnel, if you will, connections, a network,

02:15:20.523 --> 02:15:47.616
then it's very easy to see why somebody like her who doesn't have the sophistication to understand what synthetic biology has given to this biosecurity narrative and given to people like Peter Daszak and people like Nathan Wolf and people that work on these constructs, these mythologies about what RNA can and can't do if it has the right combination of bases, including a fear and cleavage site.

02:15:53.080 --> 02:16:00.429
It's extraordinary that the furin cleavage site didn't need to be removed from the spike protein to make sure that it doesn't, you know, really dangerous somehow.

02:16:00.489 --> 02:16:05.916
But if it's on the spike and the spike is on the virus, then it's really dangerous, I guess, somehow.

02:16:06.416 --> 02:16:10.401
Like, I don't know, the blades are sharper or something.

02:16:11.002 --> 02:16:12.243
The virus was natural.

02:16:13.081 --> 02:16:17.985
Now, more than three years on, their cover-ups are being exposed.

02:16:18.726 --> 02:16:30.116
Key figures- But Australians lost their job, Australians weren't allowed to cross internal borders, Australians were beat down by mandates and all kinds of other shit.

02:16:32.058 --> 02:16:40.405
And so there's only two conclusions you can come to, either the government is wholly, wholly responsible for doing that,

02:16:41.482 --> 02:17:02.330
with the intention of souring the public to America, to drilling the public into the idea that lockdowns work, to using Australia and New Zealand as examples of how lockdowns work for the rest of the Five Eyes countries.

02:17:04.371 --> 02:17:07.012
And so then the narrative play

02:17:08.425 --> 02:17:24.036
involves the Lollapalooza of liars, that is, people like Sherry Markinson, people like Pierre Kory, people like The Heart Group, people like Panda, people like Jikki Leaks, people like Meryl Ness and Robert Malone.

02:17:24.677 --> 02:17:34.624
And they're all over in these Five Eyes countries, all promoting each other or agreeing not to antagonize one another or agreeing to ignore each other's points.

02:17:37.501 --> 02:17:42.944
And in Australia, you see a very, very sharp narrative that America is behind it.

02:17:43.764 --> 02:17:48.846
It's not our business partner and close native friend, China.

02:17:49.466 --> 02:17:50.227
Couldn't be them.

02:17:51.007 --> 02:17:52.608
The one that we trade with all the time.

02:17:52.648 --> 02:17:53.348
It's not China.

02:17:53.668 --> 02:17:54.729
It's probably America.

02:17:56.263 --> 02:18:06.011
And Sky News is also the place where the lefties losing it people are, that talk exclusively about American politics in a ridiculing way.

02:18:06.512 --> 02:18:12.617
Not in a, oh my gosh, I think America might be undermining, being undermined from within.

02:18:12.677 --> 02:18:19.622
And since America is supposed to be the shining beacon of freedom, all of us in the West should be worried about what's happening in America.

02:18:20.003 --> 02:18:24.967
Is that happening on Australian news or on UK news or in Canada news?

02:18:25.982 --> 02:18:30.364
No, not even on the alternative Fox News like Sky News Australia.

02:18:30.384 --> 02:18:31.125
They're not worried.

02:18:31.165 --> 02:18:31.985
They think it's funny.

02:18:32.025 --> 02:18:32.446
It's great.

02:18:32.486 --> 02:18:33.186
It's exciting.

02:18:33.226 --> 02:18:33.726
It's news.

02:18:33.766 --> 02:18:34.287
It's fun.

02:18:34.667 --> 02:18:35.327
It's clicks.

02:18:36.488 --> 02:18:37.588
It's bullshit.

02:18:37.708 --> 02:18:45.573
It's part of a national security operation that extends around the world and is being coordinated by these five eyes intelligence agencies.

02:18:45.653 --> 02:18:46.673
See it for what it is.

02:18:47.454 --> 02:18:51.036
So calling out their deception and they don't like it.

02:19:01.109 --> 02:19:03.230
I wake up at usually about 2 or 3 a.m.

02:19:03.290 --> 02:19:09.594
and think about it, honestly, because, you know, it is, it's something that we all played a role in.

02:19:09.614 --> 02:19:10.795
Is that Kadlec?

02:19:12.336 --> 02:19:14.977
Did they say his name when they showed him the first time?

02:19:15.037 --> 02:19:16.398
Did they say that he was Kadlec?

02:19:16.418 --> 02:19:17.538
Because I think that's Kadlec.

02:19:17.579 --> 02:19:18.299
Isn't that Kadlec?

02:19:19.554 --> 02:19:20.275
Is that Kadlik?

02:19:20.555 --> 02:19:21.796
Does anyone recognize that guy?

02:19:21.836 --> 02:19:22.737
I think that's Kadlik.

02:19:23.458 --> 02:19:23.958
Aw shite.

02:19:27.742 --> 02:19:32.946
No one in charge wants to be seen as being responsible for that at all.

02:19:43.243 --> 02:19:48.066
I've been investigating and reporting on COVID since it first shook the world in early 2020.

02:19:49.287 --> 02:19:55.410
I've been making labeled folders about different topics about Corona since the beginning of the pandemic.

02:19:55.530 --> 02:19:56.091
My goodness.

02:19:56.971 --> 02:19:58.572
I've been making different colored folders.

02:19:58.592 --> 02:20:00.053
It's been quite the journey.

02:20:02.762 --> 02:20:14.596
Once a conspiracy, now a laboratory origin of COVID-19 is a serious hypothesis that leading intelligence agencies and scientists believe started the pandemic.

02:20:15.217 --> 02:20:22.886
More evidence now points to the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the source of the outbreak than any other origin.

02:20:24.847 --> 02:20:27.330
It's only taken a book, a documentary.

02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:28.732
Sherry Markinson.

02:20:29.272 --> 02:20:30.113
Surprise, surprise.

02:20:30.133 --> 02:20:31.435
She's also selling a book.

02:20:32.015 --> 02:20:36.841
Oh, she's like the, looks like she's like the Australian version of Glenn Beck.

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:40.205
To uncover the crucial evidence.

02:20:40.545 --> 02:20:42.147
I wish I had such a big glass.

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:42.688
Welcome.

02:20:42.788 --> 02:20:44.149
Thank you so much for your time.

02:20:44.470 --> 02:20:45.250
Thank you very much.

02:20:46.109 --> 02:20:53.253
In 2021, in the first installment of this documentary, I spoke with former President Donald Trump.

02:20:53.953 --> 02:20:58.295
He was under no illusion as to the origins of COVID-19.

02:20:59.096 --> 02:21:00.816
You've seen all of the intelligence.

02:21:01.317 --> 02:21:03.238
He spoke to her?

02:21:06.099 --> 02:21:06.619
Wow.

02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:08.560
Wow.

02:21:09.101 --> 02:21:11.802
When do you think the virus first started?

02:21:12.250 --> 02:21:24.314
Well, some of the intelligence is classified, and I can't talk about it, but common sense tells you it most likely, and when I say most likely, like 95 percent came from the Wuhan lab.

02:21:25.395 --> 02:21:34.438
I don't know if they had bad thoughts or whether it was gross incompetence, but one way or the other, it came out of Wuhan, and it came from the Wuhan lab.

02:21:35.325 --> 02:21:43.858
Back then, I also spoke with Mike Pompeo, former US Secretary of State and former head of the CIA.

02:21:44.779 --> 02:21:48.865
He was adamant all evidence pointed to the Wuhan lab.

02:21:49.721 --> 02:21:58.363
There was an enormous, albeit indirect, evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the center point for this.

02:21:58.463 --> 02:22:00.484
Remember, too, there were 14 of them.

02:22:00.564 --> 02:22:06.286
How different is this than Lee Min Yan being on Steve Bannon's War Room?

02:22:09.126 --> 02:22:14.128
How different is this than Robert Malone being on Tommy Podcast?

02:22:15.489 --> 02:22:20.911
How different is this than the Jihad Truth podcast and Jessica Rose?

02:22:24.053 --> 02:22:28.615
There's no difference at all because it's all the same malevolent show.

02:22:29.497 --> 02:22:36.538
American diplomats on the ground in Wuhan at this time, who were watching and observing what was taking place inside of Wuhan.

02:22:36.598 --> 02:22:47.420
I hope one day that we'll be able to get that information out more broadly, but as I come back to it, the cumulative evidence that one can see points singularly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

02:22:49.281 --> 02:22:54.642
In the past 30 years or so, new and sudden infectious diseases have been presented globally.

02:22:58.325 --> 02:23:01.267
The Wuhan Institute has the world's largest.

02:23:01.367 --> 02:23:03.909
I mean, is there anything more you need to see?

02:23:03.949 --> 02:23:06.991
Because she played a Chinese clip there with subtitles.

02:23:07.972 --> 02:23:14.736
Isn't that very similar to, say, sort of admitting that you're with them?

02:23:17.978 --> 02:23:19.279
I don't know what to say anymore.

02:23:19.479 --> 02:23:22.261
I just know for sure Australia has been lost for a while.

02:23:23.002 --> 02:23:25.904
I know Australia and New Zealand were used against America.

02:23:26.681 --> 02:23:37.830
They were used to create the media impression that was necessary to bamboozle the United States, to break it up, to fracture it intellectually, to fracture it socially.

02:23:38.350 --> 02:23:41.453
And now they are fracturing us economically, although we already were.

02:23:43.624 --> 02:23:46.027
And they're using five eyes countries against us.

02:23:46.047 --> 02:24:07.008
A lot of those citizens don't know they're being used, but most of those governments know they're using, they're, they're being used because they are playing for the crown, which is really one of the, the city of London, which is probably one of the, it's probably one of the weaponized piles of money we need to be most concerned about because it's a very old weaponized pile of money.

02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:16.846
I think Winston Churchill called the UK a lion, the America was an elephant, and Russia was a bear.

02:24:16.926 --> 02:24:29.199
So maybe the lion just means that they're loyal to the crown, which would make Robert Malone a lion, which would make the connection with Jill Glasspool Malone's father not insignificant then, wouldn't it?

02:24:29.259 --> 02:24:31.020
But that's back to the lion thing.

02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:32.021
We didn't want to do that today.

02:24:32.262 --> 02:24:34.043
Collection of bat coronaviruses.

02:24:35.436 --> 02:24:45.012
Inside the secretive laboratory, scientists were conducting risky research to make viruses more infectious to humans.

02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:48.957
they were sampling?

02:24:49.218 --> 02:24:59.442
Or there's a national security state that had vested interest in us assuming or coming to the conclusion that they were risking world health with their experiments.

02:24:59.482 --> 02:25:02.704
And then they used 60 Minutes to tell us that story.

02:25:02.744 --> 02:25:06.966
And then they used an argument between Rand Paul and Tony Fauci to tell us that story.

02:25:07.406 --> 02:25:09.947
Then they used Drastic on Twitter to tell us that story.

02:25:09.987 --> 02:25:15.850
Then they used Sherry Markinson to tell us that story and Alina Chan and Matt Ridley to write a book about that story.

02:25:15.890 --> 02:25:16.931
Do you see what I'm saying?

02:25:17.844 --> 02:25:30.797
The national security state is the only apparatus, the biosecurity state is the only apparatus that benefits from this mythology and the only one that has any vested interest in it existing.

02:25:32.638 --> 02:25:34.180
And so they're responsible for it.

02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.084
They are the ones who have to prove that the pandemic actually happened.

02:25:38.124 --> 02:25:40.085
And they're the only people that we're not asking.

02:25:41.387 --> 02:25:42.628
We're taking their word for it.

02:25:44.448 --> 02:25:48.072
We're taking their word for it when we take the word of Robert Malone.

02:25:48.112 --> 02:25:52.858
We're taking their word for it when we take the word of Li Min Yan.

02:25:52.898 --> 02:25:56.142
We're taking the word of their word when we take the word of

02:25:58.402 --> 02:26:00.963
of David Martin, whose brother works at the CDC.

02:26:01.383 --> 02:26:17.151
We're taking the word of them when we take the word of Tony Fauci, or Francis Collins, or David Baltimore, or Robert Malone, or Meryl Nass, or any of these people who have been working with this biosecurity state for decades.

02:26:18.172 --> 02:26:19.032
That's the reality.

02:26:20.441 --> 02:26:30.506
And until we come to terms with that reality, we are going to be stuck in a very simple model where, you know, America did it or America did it to China or China lied about it or something like that.

02:26:30.546 --> 02:26:36.869
When in reality, this is an entire mythology that goes all the way down to the fact that RNA cannot pandemic.

02:26:36.889 --> 02:26:38.970
So this whole story is an illusion.

02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:54.361
bats to see whether or not these bats had viruses that look like SARS or were SARS-like to see whether there would be the risk or the transmission from a bat to an intermediate host to potentially a human.

02:26:54.861 --> 02:26:56.062
Very risky research.

02:26:56.642 --> 02:27:00.683
It certainly is, particularly if you did it under the conditions as we understood.

02:27:00.703 --> 02:27:02.604
I think that's, I think that's Cadillac.

02:27:02.624 --> 02:27:08.146
The US was funding research in Wuhan via an American group, EcoHealth Alliance.

02:27:09.067 --> 02:27:20.311
The extent of their risky research came to light in this proposal, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and their American partners drew up in search of funding.

02:27:21.653 --> 02:27:27.934
They were experimenting with the parts of COVID-19 that scientists find so unusual.

02:27:28.594 --> 02:27:29.755
It's what makes the virus.

02:27:29.835 --> 02:27:47.198
And of course, the diffuse proposal is the reason why Charles Rixey came to my house in 2022 to make sure that I would not take the stand that I was taking for the last three months before that, which was I was ignoring the diffuse proposal because it was stupid on target.

02:27:49.206 --> 02:27:55.549
It's like, oh, you know, like this group on drastic on Twitter has been looking for real hard evidence that the U.S.

02:27:55.609 --> 02:27:59.551
did it for over a year and then over two years.

02:27:59.591 --> 02:28:03.452
And then suddenly the diffuse proposal gets leaked to Charles Rixey.

02:28:04.873 --> 02:28:14.197
And Charles Rixey decides to give it to a bunch of unknown anonymous foreigners on Twitter in order to make a report before they released it.

02:28:15.236 --> 02:28:40.127
because his patriotism and his loyalty to America was so great that when the defuse proposal was leaked to him, he gave it to a bunch of anonymous foreigners on Twitter and then simultaneously tried to re-recruit me back into that group that had already thrown me out a year earlier because I wanted to talk about transfection because I didn't think the origin story mattered anymore if they were going to insist on transfecting people.

02:28:43.482 --> 02:28:44.943
They are all liars.

02:28:45.024 --> 02:28:47.786
The unfortunate thing for me is that they've all lied to me.

02:28:48.507 --> 02:28:52.651
They all came into my life and messed with me and my family, my ability to make a living.

02:28:53.552 --> 02:29:01.559
And so I have an especially personal story that involves all kinds of people, even people that were on 60 minutes like that Dupree guy.

02:29:03.001 --> 02:29:04.322
You can't make this shit up.

02:29:07.659 --> 02:29:20.211
And I can't make up what Charles Rixey did and how he acted and what he said, who he's followed, who he's promoted, what ideas he has stuck to for four years.

02:29:20.271 --> 02:29:22.773
I can't change who Kevin McCarran is.

02:29:22.833 --> 02:29:32.783
I can only point to them and show you that their inconsistencies with who they're supposed to be, with their claimed persona,

02:29:34.778 --> 02:29:43.705
and their inconsistencies with regard to how they have attempted, quote unquote, to lower a ladder into the cave, reveals them for the liars that they are.

02:29:43.745 --> 02:29:55.315
And if you do your homework and look at what these people were saying in 2020 and 2021, you find out that many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many of these people were liars.

02:30:00.679 --> 02:30:03.621
Looking at all the same people, just making sure I don't miss anything.

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:04.362
It's a lot of him.

02:30:05.759 --> 02:30:10.480
who's never on American TV, but I guess he's on Australian TV, which I already find really weird.

02:30:12.561 --> 02:30:14.762
Okay, let's just go on and get this done.

02:30:16.122 --> 02:30:21.203
Ladies and gentlemen, they created the illusion of consensus by sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

02:30:22.204 --> 02:30:22.504
Okay?

02:30:23.564 --> 02:30:26.385
And that limited spectrum of debate was created by them.

02:30:27.375 --> 02:30:28.696
They showed up in 2020.

02:30:29.097 --> 02:30:40.869
If we just go to a flashpoint in May of 2020, when, when Alina Chan put out her preprint, we can see and look at what these people were doing or not doing and see that they were there ready to go.

02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:44.192
Kevin McKernan was there ready to go.

02:30:44.272 --> 02:30:49.698
Kevin McCairn and George Webb and Paul Cottrell and Addy Adds were there ready to go.

02:30:50.683 --> 02:30:56.885
And they knew already that Andy Kaufman was there ready to go on the no virus team.

02:30:56.925 --> 02:31:00.466
And they were tooting his horn as loud as they were tooting their own.

02:31:02.046 --> 02:31:15.110
And on the Bret Weinstein, the eighth Bret Weinstein podcast, Sam Harris knew that there was going to be a pandemic, a new pandemic that would need a vaccine that we couldn't tolerate any anti-vaccine messages for.

02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:17.591
They knew it already.

02:31:20.785 --> 02:31:27.791
And Bobby Kennedy went to Germany in 2020 to say that the lockdowns were bullshit and that these people were totalitarians.

02:31:28.291 --> 02:31:38.260
But he didn't question the existence of the virus, didn't question the existence of a laboratory leak, and didn't question the fidelity of the PCR test or the sequencing at all.

02:31:42.003 --> 02:31:47.408
Just questioned the lockdowns and the fact that we lost our freedom.

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:53.455
and that we shouldn't get our freedom taken away for anything.

02:31:55.461 --> 02:31:56.845
Well, especially not a lie, right?

02:31:59.585 --> 02:32:21.816
And if we advance the calendar further, we can still follow these people into the future through 2021, when Brett Weinstein supposedly pulled his head out of his ass and then decided to speak out with Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch about the fact that he was sure that ivermectin could get us out of this and back to zero COVID, which is still a goal that he thought we should be focused on in the middle of June, 2021.

02:32:25.333 --> 02:32:38.915
After a whole year of the college community being able to torture our young people at the whim of their administrations because none of the adults that were promoted on mainstream media and social media had the gall to say, just stay home a year.

02:32:41.736 --> 02:32:45.797
When I was asked for advice about what to do about people's kids, I said, stay home a year.

02:32:46.997 --> 02:32:48.437
Go do an outward bound year.

02:32:50.277 --> 02:32:52.758
Go work at a Department of Natural Resources camp.

02:32:52.858 --> 02:32:53.238
I don't know.

02:32:58.652 --> 02:33:00.674
And so we looked at Jessica Rose last night.

02:33:00.714 --> 02:33:18.608
It was really cool to see that she had done a lot of papers, not papers, with some people that I know are now meddlers, specifically the Martin Neal and Jonathan Engler, those two guys that Jessica Hockett tried to get me to work with for six or

02:33:19.228 --> 02:33:31.934
seven months before she got me supposedly an audience with Senator Ron Johnson's staff, but then gave me 15 minutes after an hour to say my thing as fast as possible while she took 40 minutes.

02:33:32.474 --> 02:33:47.201
And then after promoting that video, just kind of disappeared from Twitter and blocked me and stopped substacking and blocked me and went from sending me a few sweet voicemails a week

02:33:47.941 --> 02:34:00.663
to blocking me and I'm supposed to think that something I did was wrong or something Mark did was wrong and yet here's Jessica Rose was working with Jonathan Engler and Martin Neal already in 2022.

02:34:06.172 --> 02:34:09.854
So Jessica Hockett is just a more recent addition to the meddler lists.

02:34:10.675 --> 02:34:21.722
Somebody from the bench that they had to bring up in order to try and get me once more or separate me from Mark once more because otherwise there'd be no reason for Jessica Hockett to be out there.

02:34:22.462 --> 02:34:25.684
She's the reason why we figured out that they were giving supplementary oxygen.

02:34:26.345 --> 02:34:32.809
She was the reason why we figured out Pierre Corey was a witness for the George Floyd trial.

02:34:33.757 --> 02:34:37.119
And we figured it out because she didn't have it on her silly timeline!

02:34:41.743 --> 02:34:43.204
So just like Jessica Hockett...

02:34:44.366 --> 02:35:06.793
Jessica Rose came before her, another EpiGirl standard operating procedure in the Spars pandemic document, just some fake resistance person pointing all attention at the countermeasure instead of at the bioweapon, or instead of at the spike protein, or instead of at the fake pandemic, the murder and lies.

02:35:08.112 --> 02:35:11.933
And just so happens that she worked on the dynamical systems analysis.

02:35:11.953 --> 02:35:15.754
You know, like Brett Weinstein is really into dynamical systems.

02:35:16.614 --> 02:35:29.597
The HIV immunopathogenesis, not unlike all of the other mainstream experts in America that are promoted by Tony Fauci and his NIAID, have all cut their teeth in HIV.

02:35:30.018 --> 02:35:32.678
Many of them even going through the same Harvard Medical School.

02:35:33.098 --> 02:35:35.359
Are you giving me, is this a hard time?

02:35:36.834 --> 02:35:39.997
by teasing you that Jessica Rose is a bad guy?

02:35:40.057 --> 02:36:00.255
No, because when we listened in this interview for who she mentioned as fellow travelers in 2022, what questions she offered up as important, what biological ideas she broached, it was really striking that Matt Crawford got mentioned three times, that Meryl Nass got mentioned four times, that Steve Kirsch got mentioned, Pierre Kory got praised.

02:36:03.021 --> 02:36:09.089
And I would personally say to the face of all four of those people that they are traitors to America.

02:36:09.850 --> 02:36:18.481
And if they wanted to argue with me, I would have a very hard time not putting the palm of my hand into their forehead as hard as my arm would allow me.

02:36:25.100 --> 02:36:27.181
What questions were offered as important?

02:36:27.241 --> 02:36:29.641
What biological ideas are broached?

02:36:29.761 --> 02:36:31.122
VAERS has a new signal.

02:36:31.242 --> 02:36:33.523
Surge in millennial deaths is not opioids.

02:36:33.923 --> 02:36:36.904
The need for specificity, but then she never explained what she meant.

02:36:37.364 --> 02:36:39.224
Do not harm is a thing.

02:36:39.244 --> 02:36:41.045
Pfizer knew or hid the data.

02:36:41.085 --> 02:36:44.246
It's all one big lie, the shot is.

02:36:44.806 --> 02:36:46.227
Ivermectin is 100% safe and effective drug.

02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:50.006
Herd immunity is a thing.

02:36:50.707 --> 02:36:51.987
Untested products.

02:36:52.247 --> 02:36:53.367
They're not transfections.

02:36:53.407 --> 02:36:55.508
She doesn't know what that word is or transformations.

02:36:55.928 --> 02:36:57.369
They're just untested products.

02:36:58.129 --> 02:36:59.449
Depopulation is a thing.

02:37:00.029 --> 02:37:02.710
Bio war strike in 2019 is a thing.

02:37:03.290 --> 02:37:05.151
Under-reporting factors is a thing.

02:37:08.952 --> 02:37:14.394
The crossover event between Mark Bailey and the ultra clown car,

02:37:16.564 --> 02:37:25.606
Driver Kevin McCairn seemed very, very hokey back when Tim Truth hosted that back in 2022.

02:37:25.906 --> 02:37:29.047
But now in retrospect, it makes me sick.

02:37:30.747 --> 02:37:37.969
In retrospect, seeing Tim Truth's multiple shooters video hoax, video promoted by David Icke.

02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:43.890
It's all a mythology, duh.

02:37:47.662 --> 02:38:07.820
And of course, the crossover event that happened earlier this year was that finally the no virus all-star that Kevin McCarron told us to pay attention to in February of 2020 already, the guy who was shaking hands with Andrew Cuomo in 2019 because he was awarded a grant to develop suicide monitoring technology for the prisons of New York State.

02:38:09.053 --> 02:38:20.861
Andy Kaufman and Steve Kirsch are on a podcast together creating the illusion of consensus that they both have a valid state of understanding that needs to be debated.

02:38:22.402 --> 02:38:22.862
And they don't.

02:38:23.863 --> 02:38:30.247
Just like the idea that Sasha Latapova is somebody who is trying to save America is a lie.

02:38:30.868 --> 02:38:39.474
And the reason why you can see it as a lie is because you can look at her daughter and the internet record of her daughter before the pandemic is one of a military meddler.

02:38:40.194 --> 02:39:02.460
an experiment in how to make a little kid go viral about really nasty PC incorrect things, which would be a really useful tool for the FBI or any other intelligence agency that would be looking for Americans that would fit a certain profile of meddler, a certain profile of rabble rouser, or even violent demonstrator.

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:18.545
And then they promoted her mom in 2023, not just anyone, but the Epoch Times and Bobby Kennedy and CHD, which also sells the book for Meryl Dass and also sold the book that I wasted a year helping them with.

02:39:20.206 --> 02:39:21.946
I did get paid, so I'm not complaining.

02:39:22.967 --> 02:39:26.148
I'm just not getting acknowledged for the contribution that I made.

02:39:26.758 --> 02:39:33.882
And I'm not being acknowledged for the fact that I told that entire book staff, taught that entire book staff how to understand that RNA can pandemic.

02:39:34.443 --> 02:39:48.631
And Bobby knows it, but she was promoted as an American thought leader by the same place that promoted Robert Malone and Lee Min Yan and all these other fake, fake, fake meddlers and traitors to America.

02:39:52.663 --> 02:40:04.527
So they created this illusion of consensus on TV and on social media, and the social media people that created the consensus are the most malevolent of the liars.

02:40:04.767 --> 02:40:09.709
I still desperately need Denny Rancourt to do something more than promote

02:40:11.209 --> 02:40:12.510
Mike Yeadon occasionally.

02:40:12.610 --> 02:40:32.302
I need him to hold these people to account that have seen him present in November of 2023 in Romania and he showed them that there's no evidence for a pandemic in 2020 and they ignored that data and instead returned from Romania and shouted from the rooftops that Denny showed us that 17 million people have died from the COVID shot.

02:40:33.786 --> 02:40:38.630
And so they followed their rule of engagement, not to talk about 2020 and focus on the COVID shot.

02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:44.054
And I believe that people like Denny Rancourt, if they don't put their foot down, are just allowing this to go on.

02:40:45.556 --> 02:40:50.640
That Denny Rancourt is more or less working with them if he won't say that none of these people are telling the truth.

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:56.505
If he won't challenge them to acknowledge that there's no evidence of a pandemic, period.

02:40:57.806 --> 02:41:01.769
If he won't challenge them, then I see him as a foreign meddler like a lot of these other people.

02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:05.461
And so I'll leave him out here for now.

02:41:06.422 --> 02:41:16.627
But his track record of telling people that there was no pandemic and insisting that they repeat that that's his message is abysmal.

02:41:17.828 --> 02:41:18.669
Do better, Denny.

02:41:20.169 --> 02:41:25.993
Because otherwise you're covering up the murder that happened in 2020 by saying, well, I don't know if it was murder or not.

02:41:26.493 --> 02:41:27.654
I don't want to call it murder.

02:41:27.694 --> 02:41:29.655
I just know it wasn't a spreading pathogen.

02:41:30.075 --> 02:41:31.976
That's a cop out at this stage, Denny.

02:41:32.477 --> 02:41:32.897
Do better.

02:41:34.755 --> 02:41:37.679
because these people are still saying it was the worst case scenario.

02:41:37.719 --> 02:41:41.123
These people are still saying it's a lab leak and that we let it happen.

02:41:41.163 --> 02:41:42.865
And they want to blame America for it.

02:41:42.885 --> 02:41:46.289
They want to tear down the American constitution for it.

02:41:46.329 --> 02:41:50.054
They want to end the American culture and the American dream for it.

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:52.840
So you've got to do better than that, Denny.

02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:59.302
You've got to hold the breakfast buddies that you had in Romania to account.

02:41:59.322 --> 02:42:03.683
You've got to hold your breakfast buddy, Jessica Rose, to account.

02:42:03.703 --> 02:42:15.206
You've got to hold your dinner buddies, you know, Meryl Nass and Steven Hatfill and Robert Malone and Nick Hudson, you've got to hold them to a higher standard.

02:42:16.735 --> 02:42:20.438
Because in May of 2020, you were already telling us there was no pandemic.

02:42:20.858 --> 02:42:23.620
And you're letting them ignore you since then.

02:42:28.784 --> 02:42:32.907
And now we are at the stage where transfection in healthy humans was rushed, but it worked.

02:42:33.467 --> 02:42:36.009
And free-range RNA can cause a pandemic.

02:42:37.096 --> 02:42:47.384
And a lot of that, unfortunately, has to do with the fact that Denny Rancor's data has not been adequately described and disseminated by the people on the previous screen.

02:42:49.406 --> 02:42:50.827
And that's kind of your fault, Denny.

02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:57.172
So if you give power to these charlatans, you're never gonna give it back.

02:42:58.013 --> 02:43:04.939
And you cannot underestimate how many of these people are working with these charlatans, or how many of these people are working with these charlatans.

02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:08.860
There's a lot of them.

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:26.684
You know, Ahmed Malik is working with them, just like Sasha Latupova is working with them, just like all of these meddlers that didn't get the chance to show up here are working with them on social media and on podcasts.

02:43:26.744 --> 02:43:28.664
They are all working together.

02:43:30.524 --> 02:43:33.165
It's a controlled demolition of America, ladies and gentlemen.

02:43:34.025 --> 02:43:35.966
They created this illusion of consensus.

02:43:36.586 --> 02:43:37.846
They created it by lying.

02:43:39.184 --> 02:43:43.207
Lying and not telling people what I told them, not teaching people what I taught them.

02:43:43.988 --> 02:43:46.009
Lying about what I said when I said it.

02:43:49.031 --> 02:43:49.411
Lying.

02:43:50.112 --> 02:43:51.613
It's just lying at this stage.

02:43:51.653 --> 02:43:53.474
Heather and Brett are liars.

02:43:54.755 --> 02:43:56.276
Chris Martinson is a liar.

02:43:56.717 --> 02:43:57.857
Matt Crawford's a liar.

02:43:58.996 --> 02:44:00.578
Sasha Latapova is a liar.

02:44:01.239 --> 02:44:03.281
She's lying about what she's done in the past.

02:44:03.321 --> 02:44:04.562
She's lying about her daughter.

02:44:04.602 --> 02:44:10.509
She's lying about everything because she's on the same team of these weaponized piles of money that Brett Weinstein is on.

02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:12.091
Eric Weinstein is on.

02:44:13.593 --> 02:44:14.594
Joe Rogan is on.

02:44:14.614 --> 02:44:16.796
Harvey Reich is on.

02:44:18.077 --> 02:44:20.238
Hazan is on, they're all on the same side.

02:44:20.278 --> 02:44:21.479
They're all on the same team.

02:44:21.959 --> 02:44:36.725
It's a team that will never, ever, ever acknowledge that we need a new consensus and will never acknowledge the biology that edifies this new consensus that we should come to with our kids, that transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent.

02:44:37.186 --> 02:44:42.068
RNA cannot pandemic and the vaccine schedule in America is a criminal enterprise.

02:44:43.029 --> 02:44:57.330
Weaponized piles of money got us to fight about this crap, and that's why we're still fighting about it today Please stop all transfections in humans because they are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary There will be no show tomorrow Sunday at

02:44:58.823 --> 02:45:00.224
It's scheduled for three o'clock.

02:45:00.304 --> 02:45:06.607
We will do a intro to biology lecture that will get us started on the mini course series.

02:45:07.107 --> 02:45:16.152
There's going to be a mini course series first on molecular biology and then a mini course series on... What were we going to do the other one on?

02:45:17.248 --> 02:45:22.211
I don't know if I tell it all now then maybe people will try to spoil it.

02:45:22.311 --> 02:45:42.962
So we'll start with Infectious clones and the illusion of RNA virology next week And so in order to do that, we're gonna we're gonna start everybody at the same page with biology and I'm gonna try to do that on Sunday give you a 30,000 foot view of the irreducible complexity and how best to see it how best to

02:45:43.482 --> 02:45:50.386
to take your kids on a walk and show it to them and what questions you can ask that get the right wheels turning in those little heads.

02:45:51.286 --> 02:45:52.367
Because that's what we need to do.

02:45:52.427 --> 02:45:57.250
If we get them to ask the right questions, then they can ask their teachers the right questions.

02:45:57.330 --> 02:46:00.311
And you can't deny the right questions.

02:46:01.132 --> 02:46:12.698
If your kids can ask their teachers the right questions and their teachers don't have the right answers, then the teachers might actually get themselves a little closer to the cave entrance themselves.

02:46:14.276 --> 02:46:19.178
So we got a lot of work to do, but that also means I've got a lot of work to do, which is good.

02:46:20.058 --> 02:46:23.120
If you're gonna share this stuff, share it at stream.gigaohm.bio.

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:30.503
And if you have the means, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support my work.

02:46:30.583 --> 02:46:31.963
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:46:32.684 --> 02:46:35.305
And I'll see you again tomorrow, on Sunday, on Sunday.

02:46:36.325 --> 02:46:38.446
If I'm here tomorrow, I'll be surprised.
