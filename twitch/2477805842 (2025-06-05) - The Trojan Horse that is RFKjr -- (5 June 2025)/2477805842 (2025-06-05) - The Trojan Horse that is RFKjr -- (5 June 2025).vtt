WEBVTT

00:46.950 --> 00:49.451
Testing, testing, test one, two, testing.

00:49.471 --> 00:51.772
This is GigaOM Biological.

00:51.792 --> 00:52.472
It's June 5th, 2025.

00:53.432 --> 00:57.594
Those are the sounds of my backyard.

00:57.634 --> 00:59.294
I do have an extra microphone for that.

01:00.875 --> 01:03.896
But yeah, someday you will be first.

01:05.017 --> 01:07.478
But oftentimes you're first in my heart in the chat.

01:08.934 --> 01:15.019
I really do enjoy a lot of the comments and questions that you put out there, whatever your name is, six girl thing.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.942
Anyway, yeah, we are having a good time.

01:19.962 --> 01:21.283
Howdy everybody.

01:21.303 --> 01:23.805
I just wanted to point this out.

01:23.965 --> 01:25.367
I'm actually really happy that

01:26.149 --> 01:44.154
that the the bird makeup bot network kind of allows me to see some things depending on people posting on soapbox and i find this one very interesting because again um i will i will claim very clearly openly and loudly

01:45.495 --> 01:55.505
That this whole slow roll to some kind of more detailed understanding of the nuances of our immune system is a fraud.

01:55.665 --> 01:57.687
And the idea that now in 2025, and it's June,

02:01.411 --> 02:03.513
2025, which is essentially the middle of the year.

02:03.573 --> 02:18.246
It is six years after they closed schools permanently in 2020, and six years after this guy was already on probably 20 or more podcasts telling everybody about how the PCR should be done.

02:19.344 --> 02:28.412
is now trying to talk about how injecting a spike or maybe the mRNA to it never provides mucosal immunity.

02:28.973 --> 02:33.957
And this is really, really, really gross.

02:34.158 --> 02:36.420
It's gross on so many levels.

02:38.021 --> 02:54.771
For me, personally, it's gross because I was buying textbooks and reading them as fast as I could to try and learn this detailed immunology while I was still following Ryan Cole and Mike Eden and Kevin McKernan as people who I thought I needed to catch up to.

02:54.811 --> 03:04.536
And now that I've caught up to them, I've realized that they're all frauds, especially because each and every one of them, with the exception of this particular

03:07.006 --> 03:08.367
long time operative.

03:10.587 --> 03:15.749
I really reached out to Ryan Cole with genuine belief that he was a good guy.

03:15.849 --> 03:20.091
I reached out to Mike Eden with genuine belief that he was a good guy.

03:21.138 --> 03:31.062
And I was, you know, I just got to say, there's a lot of very malevolent, lying, fraudulent people on the internet.

03:31.302 --> 03:46.689
And even if they're not frauds, then the best case scenario for you to realize is, is that somebody's using their name and their substack and their X account to manipulate people on the internet.

03:47.916 --> 03:54.382
Only, even if only I'm the one who sees Kevin McKernan when he says these ridiculous things and nobody else does.

03:55.743 --> 03:57.705
All of that is only possible on the internet.

03:58.786 --> 04:00.287
It's not possible anywhere else.

04:00.547 --> 04:08.234
This scripted bullshitters on a script of bullshit is not possible anywhere else but on the internet.

04:09.996 --> 04:12.098
And Brett Weinstein is a personal

04:14.934 --> 04:15.975
Uh, what would you say it?

04:16.795 --> 04:19.957
I really feel like he's one of the clowns that would get out of the car.

04:20.037 --> 04:22.538
That's in my been in my rear view mirror for five years.

04:22.618 --> 04:34.305
He's one of those clowns that would come out of the car with McCairn and Kirsch and McKernan and Rose and Bowden, Bowden and Bowden, Bowden, whatever his name is.

04:34.405 --> 04:35.165
John Baldwin.

04:36.426 --> 04:39.888
Um, all of these people have come into contact with me.

04:41.124 --> 04:48.507
heard my biological explanations for what's going on and then purposefully obfuscated my role in their understanding it.

04:49.268 --> 04:55.470
Therefore, sort of removing their responsibility to pass that biology forward.

04:56.331 --> 05:05.135
If Jay Bhattacharya says he's not in a position to evaluate my biology, then he's also not in a position where he should feel obligated to pass that truth along.

05:06.129 --> 05:17.413
just in the same way as Brett Weinstein drove me out of his signal chat in early 2022 by telling me that he didn't think a Zoom meeting with me would help him understand my ideas any better.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.913
It was kind of a waste of his time.

05:20.894 --> 05:32.158
And so after extracting all the information she could by getting me to draft this review to show her exactly how well I'd absorbed the biology that I had been coached to learn,

05:33.663 --> 05:47.693
Piper Stover more or less just handed me off to Brett Weinstein, who then made me teach him the same things that I had learned in order to write the review for Piper Stover that she was going to get in the Wall Street Journal or something like that.

05:50.515 --> 05:55.739
And so then for a couple of years, I get handled by him and Matt Crawford and these other people.

05:55.839 --> 06:01.503
And then it was just Matt Crawford for a little while until finally I got picked up by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.344
via Robert Malone.

06:04.929 --> 06:18.315
And there is no way for me to make up how ridiculous, I mean, a story so ridiculous as having two phone calls on the same day in April of 2022, one from Senator Ron Johnson and one from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

06:18.355 --> 06:23.697
who both told me that Robert Malone told them to watch my stream with Charles Rixey.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.659
And that stream had impressed them so much that they wanted to work with me.

06:29.220 --> 06:29.860
Stop lying.

06:31.263 --> 06:33.765
It's all one malevolent show.

06:33.825 --> 06:45.156
And over and over again, I thought I was seeing through one layer of the narrative or catching one charlatan only to be thrown into the arms of three other charlatans or a whole Zoom meeting full of people.

06:49.340 --> 06:51.281
And so I'm not claiming victimhood.

06:51.321 --> 06:54.925
What I'm claiming is, is that I can see something that a lot of people can't.

06:56.309 --> 07:09.592
One of the things you must accept is that nobody who didn't need to see the Tommy podcast with Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose agreeing about the DNA contamination has seen the podcast.

07:09.852 --> 07:10.292
No one.

07:12.753 --> 07:17.514
Because the internet and social media is so good at providing thoughts.

07:18.427 --> 07:31.514
for the open places in your head that need thoughts to be put in, that it doesn't need to show this to anybody who isn't at least a little bit skeptical and a little bit seeking out that information.

07:33.034 --> 07:35.156
It doesn't have to show it to anyone else.

07:36.796 --> 07:44.760
And that's why nobody that you, you know, would care to change their minds has ever seen Robert Malone and knows what you're talking about.

07:44.801 --> 07:47.022
They've never heard of this guy, never heard of this girl.

07:47.847 --> 07:51.436
They definitely don't know she's a surfer with five post-secondary degrees.

07:53.782 --> 07:57.250
And so this is a very malevolent script over years.

07:58.871 --> 08:04.814
that was in brochure form shown to us a few years ago in the SPARS pandemic document.

08:04.854 --> 08:22.224
But you got to add a lot of detail to that document before you get to the stage where you have hundreds of performers on social media orchestrating a purposeful fractionation of a narrative to make sure that nobody ever puts any useful puzzle pieces together.

08:22.984 --> 08:36.012
And so that instead what we see is the development of icons that will eventually be put in places that they can do serious damage to the authority of the US government, to the protection of the American public.

08:36.652 --> 08:43.976
I think you need to be worried about the fact that the FDA in particular is being undermined by this, what appears to be a foreign network.

08:45.757 --> 08:48.559
Because the FDA takes care of our food.

08:49.773 --> 08:51.294
You want a mass poisoning?

08:52.095 --> 08:57.899
Remember Robert Malone and Andrew Huff talking about supply chains and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:57.999 --> 08:59.000
Roger, over.

09:01.242 --> 09:10.529
Now we have foreigners, a UK citizen, an Indian guy and an Indian girl and an Indian guy at NIH.

09:10.569 --> 09:17.854
We have foreigners that are running crucial pieces of our HHS bureaucracy.

09:18.789 --> 09:46.357
Billions of dollars and we have what must be admitted to be an old Drug addict and Controversial book author and Controversial lawyer as our HHS secretary now you can say that I'm being unfair or that that's not a but but that's the way it is I'm saying it as objectively as possible.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.917
He's a controversial lawyer and

09:49.715 --> 10:07.763
a not-so-controversial environmental activist, but a controversial lawyer because of the things that he's done accordingly during the pandemic, and a controversial lawyer because of the things he said as general counsel and CEO or chairman of Children's Health Defense.

10:09.525 --> 10:15.392
And so what you have is a guy who at some point had a pretty, pretty unblemished track record.

10:15.432 --> 10:20.538
Maybe you think he was, you know, falsely fighting the things that he was fighting already back then.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.158
That's fine.

10:21.198 --> 10:25.724
I haven't done enough research, but at some point he just started saying wacky stuff.

10:25.924 --> 10:30.249
And if you're not being shown it by social media, don't be surprised.

10:32.008 --> 10:45.435
but there's lots of stuff on Blue Sky and lots of stuff on other groups, on X that you're not in, where they are showing all the old videos of Robert F. Kennedy saying all of the things that he won't say now.

10:47.836 --> 10:50.157
And going, what is the disconnect here?

10:50.337 --> 10:53.699
Is this this guy or is this not this guy?

10:54.519 --> 10:57.301
And that's a very legitimate question for them to ask.

10:57.481 --> 10:59.202
And that was by design.

11:00.373 --> 11:13.096
That's the same reason why Paul Offit and all of these people on the same script, including Marty Makary, will come back over and over again to the Rolling Stone and to Samoa and Measles.

11:13.416 --> 11:21.238
And it's a never-ending, it's a hamster wheel that only moves forward by a little bit every roll.

11:22.018 --> 11:24.419
And it's moving forward in a very planned way.

11:25.816 --> 11:28.881
That's what makes the hamster wheel so ridiculous.

11:28.921 --> 11:34.470
You're running in a hamster wheel and the wheels that are moving the hamster wheel, you don't have any effect on at all.

11:37.728 --> 11:39.849
That's what this scripted bullshit is all about.

11:40.029 --> 12:00.454
It's supposed to look like a spontaneous rise to prominence of this child, and a spontaneous rise to prominence of this child, and a spontaneous rise to prominence of this, I would say, non-American aligned man.

12:01.499 --> 12:07.863
and in a country of 350 million people and probably a good 200 million adults.

12:08.324 --> 12:23.894
And I would say more than 250 qualified, thousand qualified adult men and women that could sit here and have a set of ideas and actually try to implement it with a bureaucracy that followed directions.

12:24.434 --> 12:27.416
And that's not what you see at the FDA right now.

12:27.476 --> 12:29.198
You see podcasters.

12:29.858 --> 12:34.608
that have been inserted to do podcast-like things.

12:35.750 --> 12:36.291
Messaging.

12:41.789 --> 12:44.270
And that's what you saw before he was put up.

12:44.350 --> 12:45.731
And who did he message with?

12:45.791 --> 12:47.012
And what did he message about?

12:47.072 --> 12:51.614
Well, he messaged scripted bullshit about, do we really need the FDA?

12:51.654 --> 13:05.821
But then he got appointed to one of the most important regulatory positions at the organization that he had this former presidential candidate and billionaire has said that I guess America on the whole would have been better without.

13:09.921 --> 13:33.810
Something that has been around since like 1908 or something like that and then got updated by an amendment in the 60s like what are they talking about other than treachery and bullshit That's how we got here where where RNA cannot pandemic intramuscular injection is not a proven methodology Transfection would be a crime

13:34.688 --> 13:36.790
in healthy people before the pandemic.

13:36.910 --> 13:44.096
And population pyramids before the pandemic told us that there was going to be a lot more people dying in the coming five or ten years.

13:44.617 --> 13:50.682
And they just, you know, scooted them together a little bit to create some peaks and called it a pandemic.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.565
And the result of that theater is this.

13:55.182 --> 14:11.349
We have podcasters like Brett Weinstein still rising, still being put evermore in front of more people with a very ridiculously slow, if not zero to negative progress in their understanding of the reality of things.

14:12.506 --> 14:26.414
And they seem completely oblivious to the role of these people and their previous roles and how that makes them absolutely ridiculous as patriotic outspoken dissidents in the health freedom movement.

14:26.494 --> 14:34.718
These two guys are not on the same team as all the MAGA moms or whatever the hell they're calling each other.

14:35.238 --> 14:37.239
It's ridiculous to think that.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.862
That's like thinking that Jeffrey Sachs is on our team.

14:45.182 --> 14:51.428
And so the only reason why most of us, or a lot of us, or quite a few of us fell for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

14:51.888 --> 14:54.470
is because he probably is real.

14:56.212 --> 15:00.216
He's playing a role that he's been playing for his whole life.

15:01.317 --> 15:08.023
He was actually probably raised by people who told him that he had an obligation to the country to be a role model.

15:09.614 --> 15:20.877
And ever after that, he has been trying to fill that role with the advice of thousands of people in his ear, trying to influence what he does next.

15:23.377 --> 15:30.579
And in the end, what we see now is just a spent shell of a man who has been used in his last play now.

15:30.779 --> 15:32.540
I don't think he can be used much more.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.560
And that's why Marty Makary is on all the shows.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.481
He's on all the shows.

15:39.164 --> 15:41.046
Robert F. Kennedy is doing nothing.

15:41.246 --> 15:47.532
We see nothing of him unless he's got those two by his side and he can step to the side and let them speak.

15:49.453 --> 15:53.517
I see it because we were supposed to think that that was the guy.

15:54.498 --> 16:02.025
That was the, you know, Aaron Rodgers that we were gonna get in as quarterback and everything else was, you know, but then what?

16:02.325 --> 16:05.508
All of a sudden we had this, all these people chosen for us.

16:06.894 --> 16:10.531
All these people, the CDC doesn't even, we don't even talk about that anymore.

16:10.571 --> 16:11.757
It's just an interim director.

16:15.185 --> 16:21.228
So what you have accepted up until now is that PCR is a diagnostic standard.

16:21.989 --> 16:24.030
Sequencing is a high fidelity measurement.

16:24.130 --> 16:27.572
Intramuscular injection is proven as a methodology in medicine.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.093
RNA has huge military potential.

16:30.753 --> 16:31.974
Trump was shot at.

16:32.694 --> 16:37.457
He is a patriot and that mystery and the mystery of the virus was solved.

16:38.177 --> 16:40.278
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

16:40.478 --> 16:43.400
as HHS secretary is already a huge win.

16:44.622 --> 16:49.766
That is what, hold on a second, I do have to click something, sorry.

16:50.086 --> 16:53.529
Allow, allow.

16:55.250 --> 17:09.261
I will not use those words, but yeah, it's, I might be being too nice to him, but I am trying to maintain some, you know, let people do some of the walking on their own, but please go ahead and do whatever you need to do in the chat.

17:09.301 --> 17:12.624
I'm sorry I had to click that off, but that's the way the program works.

17:14.457 --> 17:24.240
And so this is the illusion that we are left with now, and people are spending a lot of energy deciding how to get at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.021
and convince him to, I don't know, do something.

17:27.941 --> 17:30.342
And that is, again, by design.

17:31.362 --> 17:37.964
And I'm gonna go out on a very big limb here, and I'm gonna say this was a national security operation all along.

17:37.984 --> 17:41.825
And I'm talking about like before, all the way back to the first Trump.

17:43.407 --> 17:51.198
that it was essentially a Clinton, Obama, big money operation all along.

17:51.258 --> 17:55.184
Both parties have been bought out a long time ago, and this is the theater that they did.

17:57.046 --> 17:57.927
And this theater,

18:00.092 --> 18:20.585
is something that means that essentially we had Democrat, Democrat, Democrat, Democrat, Democrat, Democrat, and that's why even though some of the cultural messaging changes, and trans is okay and trans isn't okay, and that changes, the foreign policy doesn't change.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.724
the policies on the big geopolitical myths doesn't change.

18:27.505 --> 18:47.803
It still seems that we really have to be concerned about Russian infiltration on the internet and Chinese infiltration on the internet and Chinese stealing our intellectual property at our universities and Russians, I don't know, I guess putting out internet porn or something like that, but, and Ukrainians, I mean, what in the world is going on?

18:49.204 --> 19:18.302
if we're not talking about the fact that good friends of Barack Obama, Indian nationals, who used to be ambassadors, who used to be connected to the State Department, are putting people into place, orchestrating this sort of dismantling of any regulatory structure in America whatsoever and opening us up to all kinds of sabotage, all kinds of

19:19.161 --> 19:23.783
you know, just disasters, how they could make the government fall apart.

19:24.103 --> 19:33.348
That's one thing, but making America fall apart by having the very regulatory infrastructure that keeps our food safe.

19:34.168 --> 19:42.913
I mean, that guy is now, Marty and Vinay are now the heads of two, it is crazy.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.173
It is crazy.

19:44.273 --> 19:46.995
They did not shoot at Donald Trump.

19:48.035 --> 19:57.040
That kid supposedly went to the same high school where my boy goes now and where my other two kids will go in the future if we don't move.

19:57.521 --> 20:00.562
Think about the fact that we don't know any more about that kid.

20:00.923 --> 20:03.024
He lived four blocks from my house.

20:09.244 --> 20:20.377
Think about the fact that Donald Trump's sons never bragged about the surgeon's great work or the scar on their dad's ear even though they take pictures with dead animals for their whole life.

20:21.698 --> 20:22.579
They're hardcore.

20:23.340 --> 20:24.682
Really into Bitcoin.

20:24.762 --> 20:25.863
Bitcoin to the moon.

20:26.772 --> 20:30.175
but dad's got no scar from getting shot in the ear.

20:30.636 --> 20:41.126
It's interesting that there are like three YouTube videos out there where people take a gelatin model of a human head and they try to shoot it with a variety of caliber of bullets.

20:41.206 --> 20:49.435
And they're never, ever, even with a, you know, a very finely tuned gun that they can slowly move to the right and try to nick the ear.

20:50.055 --> 21:05.246
the moment that the bullet touches the ear it's able to take the skin and pull it away from the head and completely like there's shreds it there's no as far as they can tell there's no real way to hit somebody in the ear and just barely nick it

21:06.266 --> 21:07.668
and the odds of that happening.

21:08.029 --> 21:13.276
And then remember, don't forget the bullet was caught on camera by a lucky photographer.

21:13.337 --> 21:16.541
Don't forget that one little deal as well.

21:17.583 --> 21:21.669
On every slide, the first slide I have quotes and I know that you don't read them.

21:22.439 --> 21:25.782
at all, because you don't need to read them to pass or get a good grade.

21:26.043 --> 21:27.084
But this one is pretty cool.

21:27.444 --> 21:30.187
The quote from Alice in Wonderland.

21:30.907 --> 21:34.170
One can't believe impossible things, said Alice.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.233
I dare say you haven't had much practice, said the queen.

21:37.273 --> 21:42.278
Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.

21:42.578 --> 21:45.021
So that's totally suitable for this lecture.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.243
A lot of impossible things are going to happen today.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.341
condition and condition that we will not call autism.

21:52.501 --> 21:54.061
I don't like the word autism.

21:54.941 --> 21:55.982
He was vaccine damaged.

21:56.342 --> 21:57.782
He was neurologically damaged.

21:58.362 --> 22:01.223
The condition and condition that we will not call autism.

22:01.383 --> 22:02.943
I don't like the word autism.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.864
He was vaccine damaged.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.664
He was neurologically damaged.

22:07.224 --> 22:10.085
The condition and condition that we will not call autism.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.785
I don't like the word autism.

22:12.685 --> 22:13.726
He was vaccine damaged.

22:14.086 --> 22:14.886
He was neurologically

22:30.171 --> 22:33.132
What the, where, where am I?

22:36.973 --> 22:37.854
No way.

22:45.116 --> 22:46.937
What the fuck?

22:49.798 --> 22:56.420
So yes, we're supposed to believe that the Corbett Report is now back on YouTube and that's an accident and he was censored.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.701
You're listening to the Corbett Report.

22:59.653 --> 23:04.273
You know, the guy who told us that Bill Gates was a bad guy and that the virus was from a lab and...

23:05.754 --> 23:16.460
and has been promoted by CHD and... Oh my gosh.

23:17.200 --> 23:22.263
Remember what telling everybody that Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation are trying to kill everybody does.

23:22.743 --> 23:25.304
It makes the Bill and Gates Foundation bigger than life.

23:25.384 --> 23:34.689
It makes Bill Gates really important and it takes all the heat off the national security state that's trying to make us into experimental animals for the Human Genome Project's next stage.

23:34.929 --> 23:57.561
four plus years has given you an error message saying this channel has been removed for violating YouTube's community guidelines or whatever garbage nonsense it said, well that suddenly went away and now there's a channel there with all of my old videos and 545,000 of my 590 plus thousand subscribers are still there.

23:57.601 --> 23:59.482
Well, I don't know what happened to those other 50,000, but anyway,

24:01.246 --> 24:01.887
suddenly back.

24:02.327 --> 24:02.607
Wow.

24:02.787 --> 24:07.492
Maybe they'll reinstate Soph pretty soon and she can start making videos again.

24:07.672 --> 24:08.873
Perhaps that's coming.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.215
I know one thing for sure.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.156
There's a recent coverage of the fact that

24:14.459 --> 24:18.242
Steve Bannon's War Room was allowed back on nothing other than TikTok.

24:18.382 --> 24:19.183
No shit.

24:20.003 --> 24:22.365
So they're all pulling the same stunt this week.

24:22.425 --> 24:23.806
They're getting their money back.

24:23.846 --> 24:27.048
They're getting their monetization back.

24:27.108 --> 24:29.049
They even got a lot of their followers back.

24:29.630 --> 24:30.871
Isn't that handy?

24:30.991 --> 24:38.716
...why and all of that, in which I also explained what this building is and its significance and why I'm sitting in front of it at all.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.677
So you can find out more about that in episode 399.

24:41.858 --> 24:46.760
I also wrote an article at the time that it happened called mission accomplished the quarter report.

24:46.860 --> 24:57.945
I wonder if I wonder if Mark Kulak has produced more than 400 and some episodes Seems like a lot is scrubbed off YouTube.

24:58.106 --> 24:59.146
I know I have are

24:59.892 --> 25:00.733
but that's different.

25:01.413 --> 25:02.534
I just barely got there.

25:03.415 --> 25:04.796
This is really a bigger thing.

25:04.816 --> 25:14.524
You gotta understand that the cheese is free on the internet and all of these apps are basically free with ads.

25:14.744 --> 25:15.905
That's all nonsense.

25:16.625 --> 25:24.372
Your acquiescence to social media allows them to put thoughts in your head that include on Rumble, buying lots of ivermectin for stuff.

25:25.450 --> 25:33.697
And on YouTube includes a lot of other things that you don't need from gold to different juices.

25:33.877 --> 25:41.324
All of these people that have contracts are also reading ads and they're not reading ads for things that they buy for their family.

25:41.344 --> 25:43.806
They're reading ads for things they are paid to read.

25:44.506 --> 25:50.652
And that's Dr. Drew, that's Kim Iverson, that's Brett Weinstein, that's all of them.

25:51.973 --> 25:52.994
It's not innocent.

25:54.838 --> 26:02.163
because nobody should be paying somebody to read ads on the internet for thousands of dollars because they have millions of subscribers.

26:02.223 --> 26:03.023
Think about that.

26:03.604 --> 26:22.516
Millions of subscribers that you're supposed to believe occurred by accident as a result of their unblemished record of integrity instead of the pre-programming by their friends or by a military industrial complex that can't have the truth actually meaningfully represented anywhere there.

26:26.138 --> 26:39.990
And once you realize that's the most parsimonious reason for the people that we see, the people that we hear, and the arguments that we participate in on these mediums, then you start to see why it's so dangerous to go there.

26:41.591 --> 26:43.353
Why it's so dangerous to use them.

26:45.554 --> 26:50.639
It's like going into the casino with a bunch of cash and trying to keep it.

26:51.766 --> 26:53.207
But the cash is your sanity.

26:53.787 --> 26:57.648
The cash is your ability to process reality.

26:58.949 --> 27:08.233
And once you've been in the casino for too long, the only thing you have is comp drinks, comp meals, and comp rooms, because you're all out of money.

27:11.054 --> 27:16.636
It's bad, ladies and gentlemen, and our children are walking right into that trap because we're not aware of it.

27:16.696 --> 27:17.937
We need to take back

27:18.720 --> 27:24.426
the governance of all of our countries around the world, first and foremost, by getting off of social media.

27:25.407 --> 27:42.023
And then we can focus on reading books and starting to understand why this concept of evolution is real because we found DNA is a very bad concept if it's applied in the way that it's been applied in the context of the Human Genome Project.

27:42.825 --> 27:52.571
Our worst fears imagined in this model include pandemic viruses that could kill 70 or 80% of the people they infect.

27:55.793 --> 28:03.958
They also include altering the human genome to eliminate disease, increase lifespan, or make us immortal.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.820
And they're all, all,

28:09.895 --> 28:14.282
possible because the foundation of our thinking of ourselves is wrong.

28:14.743 --> 28:18.208
And that's coming from a biologist, a lifelong biologist.

28:18.289 --> 28:23.918
I'm telling you, I couldn't see it either because it's such a seductive idea, a seductive trap.

28:26.704 --> 28:35.413
Now, if you want to understand the pandemic, you have to understand the background and stop thinking of it as nothing, but thinking of it as inestimably complex.

28:35.593 --> 28:48.346
Even the background in your home, in your studio, in your kitchen, and in the sink drain is composed of an almost unquantifiably

28:49.648 --> 28:58.319
diverse and possibly unique composition of microbes and their genetic signals in your sink at any given time.

28:58.380 --> 29:03.747
And it would change very, very robustly over time if you could keep track of it all.

29:04.648 --> 29:05.349
But they can't.

29:07.168 --> 29:17.313
And so as a result, it's all one of these things where when they rolled out the tests and they only had two primers, a coming and going primer, that doesn't work.

29:17.473 --> 29:18.594
And that's not a real term.

29:18.654 --> 29:25.357
I said that for you and for people who aren't biologists, but there's, you know, primers that go in both directions and you have those two that are

29:28.104 --> 29:31.906
are specific for the beginning and the end of a sequence that runs like that, right?

29:31.946 --> 29:45.971
And so then the fragments that you amplify either start with this primer or they start with that primer and then they go what was frankly is a random distance from that point and then you get a signal from that.

29:46.552 --> 29:51.994
And so if those primers are the only thing they use, then they have not differentiated from anything.

29:52.054 --> 29:56.476
We don't even know for sure if those primers wouldn't have been just as hot

29:57.236 --> 30:04.758
in all of this time that we were using them as they would have been in all of this time before the pandemic started because it's actually true.

30:05.198 --> 30:10.079
There's no data of any kind about these signals before 2020.

30:11.119 --> 30:11.419
None.

30:12.659 --> 30:18.041
And now we're using PCR as a standard diagnostic for a lot of shit in hospitals.

30:18.641 --> 30:20.261
And before 2020, we used it for zero.

30:25.518 --> 30:29.823
Zero things were standard PCR tests.

30:29.903 --> 30:30.664
Because why?

30:31.085 --> 30:38.373
Because each one of those tests would have needed to go through a full FDA approval of a medical device to prove that they were safe.

30:38.974 --> 30:42.038
And more importantly, that they did what they said on the label.

30:43.137 --> 30:46.658
which is the mandate of the FDA.

30:47.078 --> 30:50.139
Make sure that what is on the label is actually in the bottle.

30:50.179 --> 30:54.500
And in the case of a medical device, make sure that it does what it claims to do.

30:55.040 --> 31:00.221
And that's not a bad misrepresentation of what the FDA's mandate is.

31:00.261 --> 31:05.943
And so you should be terrified that we have someone from the UK, probably not loyal to America,

31:06.463 --> 31:17.270
someone from India or whose family is from India, who's probably not loyal to America from Stanford, someone from Stanford and not from America at the NIH, who's probably not loyal to America.

31:17.711 --> 31:27.077
And then at the head of the HHS, we have essentially a person who obviously takes advice very easily and makes very bad decisions.

31:27.137 --> 31:34.942
Because at one point in time, when he was an adult, he put a dead bear and a bicycle in the park as a joke.

31:40.598 --> 31:48.467
I'm not some kind of Eagle Scout who's also been to the moon, but I have a little bit better track record than that.

31:50.349 --> 31:56.717
Obviously, I've been to a few fish shows, but we're talking about a guy who has a

31:58.936 --> 32:00.716
Wow, I mean, it's remarkable.

32:01.316 --> 32:13.159
It's remarkable where we are because we are still doing this and the people that tricked us into doing it are still prominent in this hidden movement that has bamboozled anybody with questions.

32:14.079 --> 32:20.000
This hidden movement that includes all these organizations around the world that only have a presence because of social media.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.641
And that's why this is for all the marbles.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.281
That's why there's a fake vaccine.

32:27.631 --> 32:30.254
Movement in America and it's been there for a while.

32:30.294 --> 32:49.354
It was actually stunted and prototyped and tested in The UK and then the same characters that ran the scam in the UK brought it to America and ran it with With Steve Bannon and Tony Lyons Children's Health Defense I can and Bobby Kennedy at the front That's what I'm saying

32:51.707 --> 33:06.761
And so endemicity is one of those biological things that you can see through once you realize that it's been presented to you as an accepted process and also an accepted endpoint phenomenon, meaning that things can be endemic.

33:07.918 --> 33:12.080
like racism in America, or things can go endemic.

33:12.120 --> 33:24.146
They can start in a mud puddle or in a Petri dish, and then five years later can be everywhere on earth, and unfortunately, in the background forever, because that's how these things work.

33:26.158 --> 33:28.179
And there's no biology to support that.

33:28.279 --> 33:32.041
Notice this diagram is time going this way, right?

33:32.101 --> 33:37.484
And so every year from here, this virus is going around the world and staying there.

33:39.666 --> 33:41.587
There's no paint that could do that.

33:41.687 --> 33:46.550
If you spilled it in the backyard, then over five years, there's blue paint on everybody's shoes.

33:47.030 --> 33:48.891
You understand that that can't happen.

33:48.951 --> 33:54.254
And there's no difference between the chemical of RNA and the chemicals in a paint.

33:56.169 --> 33:57.329
They're all just chemicals.

33:57.950 --> 34:16.696
Without some kind of emergent process beyond chemistry, you cannot explain how an RNA, even if it has HIV inserts and a clever fear and cleavage site, there's no way to explain how RNA could go from something, a little bit, to everywhere and still going.

34:16.836 --> 34:23.319
And in fact, as the FDA director just said on Sunday morning news programs,

34:24.019 --> 34:28.324
is part of the five now coronaviruses that are endemic.

34:28.364 --> 34:32.730
So there's four other ones that are going all the time that we don't bother to track.

34:33.190 --> 34:36.555
We don't have any tests for, and we don't care to test for.

34:36.615 --> 34:38.056
We only test for this one.

34:38.857 --> 34:39.959
That's also real.

34:46.007 --> 35:06.929
And so once you see that if there's a background, like I have drawn here of black DNA in the background, and then you make a test that says that the red DNA, the new stuff, is the black stuff, then you can convert the already existing DNA in the background to a now circulating new variant.

35:08.089 --> 35:09.570
just by this lie right here.

35:10.471 --> 35:20.778
And now the important thing to realize is that this lie can be orchestrated almost flawlessly, even with unwitting victims that find it.

35:21.158 --> 35:25.881
If you use an infectious clone, if you use a clone, I shouldn't say infectious clone.

35:26.341 --> 35:34.347
If you use a clone of this DNA, so you take the background, you know it's there, and you make a pure quantity of it.

35:35.347 --> 35:45.253
So that when you put it somewhere and you tell people to look for something, the hottest signal there will be a pure copy of that background signal.

35:46.814 --> 35:52.838
And you design your primers for your tests based on that signal.

35:53.478 --> 35:56.200
And then you tell everybody to look for it, they will find it.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.822
And they will label it as something that they found in Wuhan.

36:00.523 --> 36:04.065
But of course, if you weren't looking for it before the release,

36:05.356 --> 36:14.880
then releasing something that's already there has the same effect of looking like, holy shit, it's spreading everywhere so fast, we can barely keep up with it.

36:15.780 --> 36:24.983
And one of the people who helped seed that narrative was of course, Jay Bhattacharya, because he looked at seroprevalence studies and wow, this stuff is everywhere.

36:25.343 --> 36:30.945
That means that the case fatality rate is much lower than they said, but it also means it's spreading like wildfire.

36:30.965 --> 36:32.126
I mean, man, oh man.

36:36.226 --> 36:45.328
And so you had to also time this stunt with a known biological phenomenon that could be misconstrued as a crisis.

36:45.388 --> 36:50.989
And what is that known biological phenomenon that would otherwise could be misconstrued as a crisis?

36:51.049 --> 36:52.210
It's this bump right here.

36:54.650 --> 37:01.992
This bump in the population pyramid that was created after World War II when people came back from the war and were prosperous and had lots of babies.

37:02.967 --> 37:07.740
And then for the next 20 years, they tried to discourage people from having so many babies and they didn't.

37:17.506 --> 37:21.767
And so this is an expected rise, an anticipated rise in all cause mortality.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.128
And they knew exactly when it was coming.

37:24.148 --> 37:28.729
That's why Tony Fauci could get on stage and say, we know it's coming in Trump's term.

37:28.749 --> 37:37.132
We know it's going to come because there's an anticipated rise in all cause mortality that the national security state is going to take advantage of.

37:39.349 --> 37:44.131
The national security state was already planning to take advantage of during the Obama administration.

37:44.171 --> 37:50.695
That's why a lot of the people in charge of Obama's Ebola response were also in charge of Biden's COVID response.

37:50.915 --> 37:52.716
Ooh, that was too easy.

37:53.176 --> 37:55.417
It's weird how so many people don't notice that.

38:04.153 --> 38:05.654
So we have an explanation.

38:06.534 --> 38:11.996
Many of these things are on the list for Grace, Scott Shara's daughter.

38:12.896 --> 38:13.416
Watch that.

38:13.776 --> 38:20.219
I'm not watching that trial because I can't waste, use, sorry, I cannot devote that much time to it.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.521
I assume that other people are going to do it.

38:22.561 --> 38:34.334
I know that Children's Health Defense is doing it and part of the reason why I don't want to cover it directly is because that means that I have to use Children's Health Defense's feed and I'm not going to promote them at this stage because I know how

38:36.260 --> 38:39.363
how bad they are in this picture.

38:40.904 --> 38:46.609
I mean, Children's Health Defense doesn't give a shit about the babies that die of opioid contact deaths.

38:46.749 --> 38:50.372
They don't care about that at all.

38:51.213 --> 38:53.895
They're a despicable organization at this stage.

38:56.010 --> 39:21.316
Anybody that's working for them should be actively working to archive and expose their inner workings, make recordings of what they say so that you can, we really have a good documentation of how awful they are because a big top tent of health freedom is very much like a road to nowhere.

39:22.188 --> 39:31.131
It is a place where everybody can go and shout and yell and scream and no one else outside of the tent will care or hear.

39:31.891 --> 39:45.936
It's a circus that can move all around the United States and the world and everybody can get together and have a little meeting and feel like the word is getting out when in reality it's actually being held in by the big top tent of health freedom.

39:46.576 --> 39:50.798
And nobody that's, you know, everybody that's not interested in circuses is never coming.

39:52.014 --> 39:57.398
Everybody that has no questions about these things and has no interest in these answers is not coming.

39:57.458 --> 40:01.461
So the circus has no effect on the towns around.

40:01.701 --> 40:15.150
It doesn't have any, it just kind of moves through and the people that like circuses or are interested in the fat man or the elephant will come to the circus and those that aren't will be working on the same things they were working on before the circus showed up.

40:16.311 --> 40:28.287
And that is the actual role that the health freedom movement was set up to play during the pandemic, but I think the kink in the armor is is that they never planned for brandy Vaughn.

40:30.070 --> 40:30.911
And so the whole.

40:32.566 --> 40:57.162
sort of entry into the pandemic, the 2015, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, she's murdered, that is ugly, and that is messy, and that history is ugly, and that history is messy, because while Brandy Vaughn is teaching what I came to kind of conclusion on my own, which is not a Brett Weinstein statement, it's more like a,

40:59.042 --> 41:00.142
This has got to be right.

41:00.963 --> 41:03.284
Because Brandy was saying it differently.

41:03.344 --> 41:08.426
Brandy was trying to get people to compare ingestion versus injection.

41:09.086 --> 41:13.368
And she was emphasizing the liver, which I've never really emphasized, but it's true.

41:14.288 --> 41:16.329
Emphasizing a lot of things that

41:16.849 --> 41:29.457
from a standpoint of ingestion, what are all the ways that we protect ourselves from stuff that we might not have should have put in our mouth versus, you know, how do we protect ourselves against something that gets intramuscularly injected by a hypodermic needle?

41:31.378 --> 41:34.800
And yeah, I think this is where we are.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.642
They had to reset that skepticism.

41:38.496 --> 41:45.960
They had to catch that skepticism up so that at the beginning of the pandemic, people like Brian Hooker were prepared to say, yes, COVID is real.

41:46.501 --> 41:47.601
Yes, the tests work.

41:48.062 --> 41:49.322
Maybe they're exaggerating.

41:49.382 --> 41:50.683
Maybe there's false positives.

41:50.743 --> 41:53.065
Maybe they need to test the vaccines a little more.

41:53.565 --> 41:58.248
But Brett's, I mean, Brian says autism, Brian says vaccines.

41:59.508 --> 42:01.850
And so Brian's not trying to break the narrative at all.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.407
because he's using all the enchantments.

42:05.227 --> 42:21.543
I mean, at least you have to differentiate the current from the new and say that those are transfections because you have 16 years experience working at a government laboratory transfecting and transforming plants, but he's not saying that.

42:22.486 --> 42:28.154
And that makes Brian Hooker a intimate part of this illusion and a traitor to our grandkids.

42:28.194 --> 42:37.468
And it's not fun for me to say that because when I was working at CHD, he pretended to know nothing and that I was so smart and I had to explain all this stuff to him.

42:38.663 --> 42:40.584
And that is an absolute lie.

42:40.864 --> 42:47.727
And I will probably go to my grave believing that because I don't think Brian is going to confess.

42:48.447 --> 43:03.013
I don't think Brian is going to tell everybody the truth, that he's very disappointed at where we are because, you know, years and years ago, he stopped going so hard in the paint because he was told by Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:03.053 --> 43:04.174
that we can use this

43:04.714 --> 43:09.497
to change America in a much more forward-thinking way if we try to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:09.557 --> 43:10.318
near the White House.

43:11.919 --> 43:13.500
Because that seems to be what happened.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.541
And so those people were in place.

43:16.582 --> 43:26.129
Wittingly or unwittingly, they were unable to see that the illusion was based on an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

43:26.169 --> 43:29.851
They were unable to see that people were being murdered in American hospitals.

43:31.212 --> 43:32.533
Unable to put it all together.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.461
And that's because they're all on the same script.

43:37.541 --> 43:40.281
There's no way that Pierre Cory doesn't know that people were murdered.

43:40.301 --> 43:43.462
There's no way that Peter McCullough doesn't know that people were murdered.

43:43.502 --> 43:45.963
There's no way that any of these people don't know it anymore.

43:47.243 --> 43:49.544
Because somehow or another, they've heard me say it.

43:49.644 --> 43:50.884
They've heard someone else say it.

43:50.944 --> 43:58.046
Because people were also murdered in Scotland, and it's being said very well, and it's being documented very well, but nobody's saying it.

44:01.707 --> 44:05.709
Oh my goodness, ladies and gentlemen, I'm really, really happy.

44:05.749 --> 44:06.710
We are going to win.

44:06.770 --> 44:11.993
We are definitely, America is going to come out of this ahead and alive and kicking.

44:12.133 --> 44:15.074
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

44:25.729 --> 44:26.429
And I have lied.

44:26.449 --> 44:27.490
I'm sure I'll lie again.

44:27.510 --> 44:28.450
I don't want to lie.

44:28.930 --> 44:30.291
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

44:30.391 --> 44:31.412
I try not to be a liar.

44:31.452 --> 44:32.292
I don't want to be a liar.

44:32.872 --> 44:35.633
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

44:39.315 --> 44:43.417
Think, but you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

44:45.218 --> 44:45.918
And I have lied.

44:45.938 --> 44:46.978
I'm sure I'll lie again.

44:46.998 --> 44:47.939
I don't want to lie.

44:48.419 --> 44:49.780
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

44:49.880 --> 44:50.900
I try not to be a liar.

44:50.940 --> 44:51.781
I don't want to be a liar.

44:52.361 --> 44:55.062
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

44:57.272 --> 45:05.782
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

45:09.646 --> 45:15.252
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

45:15.913 --> 45:22.516
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, and it's measles plus.

45:22.636 --> 45:28.138
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles, because not that many people die from it.

45:28.438 --> 45:30.399
It's just a big hassle in the end.

45:33.547 --> 45:46.754
when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not, it's, there'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

45:46.794 --> 45:49.355
It'll be a moral emergency because it has to be.

45:50.155 --> 45:54.477
I see a question in the chat about whether or not the wellness company has tried to get me on their books.

45:54.517 --> 45:55.498
And the answer is yes.

45:56.258 --> 45:56.779
I have been,

45:57.879 --> 46:02.721
directly offered something by Paul Alexander once, but that was quite a while ago.

46:03.421 --> 46:05.282
And that was at a time when I didn't need help.

46:06.162 --> 46:09.063
If I was offered help now by them, of course, I would still say no.

46:09.123 --> 46:15.705
But at one point in time, I didn't have any particular impression or idea about who they were.

46:16.905 --> 46:25.308
I just knew that at the original Children's Health Defense inaugural conference in Knoxville, Tennessee,

46:27.532 --> 46:44.006
A number of people that I now consider actors were at that conference and tried to convince myself and Mark Kulak that it was interesting to look into the wellness company and Peter McCullough as being maybe a operative that is being paid by them.

46:45.837 --> 46:52.144
And that was an interesting little moment of intrigue there that we were supposed to take as real.

46:52.985 --> 47:01.856
Also, Robert Malone coming out after Whitney Webb's talk and telling us that, looking us right in the eye, all of us, and saying, wow, what a firecracker.

47:01.896 --> 47:02.917
I didn't expect that.

47:31.024 --> 47:32.226
I don't care how you get there.

47:32.246 --> 47:34.929
I don't care what you do to get there.

47:34.949 --> 47:37.572
The goal is to win.

47:49.423 --> 47:56.271
All right, so I'm really excited because I do think we have a never-ending set of work to do now because the picture is clear.

47:56.972 --> 48:00.215
It's just a question of what rats can we make jump out of the ship first.

48:01.477 --> 48:03.879
I am gonna be here every day that I can be.

48:04.040 --> 48:08.204
It's gonna, you know, it feels a little bit like a hamster wheel because I do think that's what it is.

48:09.105 --> 48:16.391
Um, but our, our, you know, we have also circadian rhythms that we don't want to, we don't want to insult, um, and we want to take good care of.

48:16.431 --> 48:18.612
That's why I'm trying to keep up with this schedule.

48:19.413 --> 48:22.635
Um, and, uh, I want to keep encouraging you to get off social media.

48:22.655 --> 48:31.462
More importantly, regularly teach and reteach your children what social media allows to happen, which is the coordinated lying.

48:32.102 --> 48:36.904
and it allows people to coordinate their lives to your people, your kids, and to you.

48:37.384 --> 48:40.505
And it's not just about politics, it's about everything.

48:40.705 --> 48:43.486
It's not just about selling stuff.

48:43.686 --> 48:46.767
We will not call autism, I don't like the word autism.

48:47.627 --> 48:48.628
He was vaccine damaged.

48:49.008 --> 49:00.712
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a mythology that they use to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, virology is never questioned as a science, and public health is never questioned as a reason.

49:02.020 --> 49:17.173
Make sure you understand that this pandemic and gain-of-functions ideas that are serving the same purpose, maybe even bumped it up a level in terms of coercing our children into believing these things.

49:18.314 --> 49:25.661
Almost at a military level, a kind of using military tactics to govern us.

49:25.881 --> 49:26.582
And I think that

49:27.402 --> 49:32.867
Once we start to understand why the cheese is free on social media, we're going to be able to get out.

49:33.807 --> 49:37.130
Because the way out is biology, but it's not quite that simple.

49:37.190 --> 49:39.252
The way out is really off of social media.

49:40.573 --> 49:50.041
And the way that they have been able to ignore the work that we do, that Mark does, is through social media and its programming.

49:51.846 --> 49:55.308
And so I do really think that there is a truth out there.

49:55.348 --> 49:58.691
And I do really think that we are very, very much over that target.

49:59.671 --> 50:01.092
And so we're going to keep on hammering.

50:01.993 --> 50:04.975
I think it's important that everybody keep hammering on the biology.

50:05.015 --> 50:06.616
Keep learning as much as you can.

50:07.717 --> 50:08.397
And don't stop.

50:09.738 --> 50:10.959
This is for all the marbles.

50:11.019 --> 50:11.920
It's for America.

50:12.080 --> 50:16.602
It's for America from what we remember to what we want to see in the future.

50:17.062 --> 50:25.667
If you're here for the first time, you might be a skilled TV watcher, but if not, I'm sure you're already staying focused on the biology, not taking the bait on social media and loving your neighbors.

50:28.783 --> 50:32.664
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Jay Cooley, I'm chief biologist at GigaOM Biological.

50:32.704 --> 50:33.465
I helped with a book.

50:33.805 --> 50:34.985
I got a barbecue friend.

50:36.246 --> 50:38.366
I got lots of papers on PubMed.

50:39.627 --> 50:40.807
And YouTube doesn't like me.

50:40.867 --> 50:41.827
Surprise, surprise.

50:41.847 --> 50:46.569
I don't have sufficient channel history, so I guess they're not gonna allow me to do stuff.

50:47.869 --> 50:50.890
I'll be back up on JC on a bike probably next week.

50:51.431 --> 50:52.751
Maybe I'll stream to both of them.

50:52.871 --> 50:53.211
I don't know.

50:53.951 --> 50:55.072
I don't even know if that's allowed.

50:55.952 --> 51:10.860
The way that this works is that there are a few very generous viewers and about a hundred other extremely generous viewers In the sense of you know, I've got subscribers that have been giving me a little bit every month and by a little bit I mean a significant $10 every month or

51:13.421 --> 51:17.604
And then I also have some people that give every month quite a bit more than that.

51:17.704 --> 51:22.606
And those few people plus the regulars are really how this works.

51:22.906 --> 51:24.487
And the rest is just you sharing.

51:25.048 --> 51:27.969
So if you want to wake people up, please share the stream.

51:28.750 --> 51:36.254
If you want me to keep waking people up and start buying billboards and stuff like that, then find a way to support the stream at GigaOMBiological.com.

51:36.734 --> 51:39.576
There you can also find a link up there on the top called Stuff.

51:40.356 --> 51:47.763
That's where you can download the McKinsey report and some of the journal clubs we've done and that will be a more and more important link as we move forward.

51:48.243 --> 51:49.184
There's a schedule there.

51:49.204 --> 51:53.788
I'm not really following it right now, but I promise that we are going to start doing that very shortly.

51:53.828 --> 51:56.110
There's those links for the support.

51:56.951 --> 52:04.617
If you sign up, you know, you're really just signing up for a website and for a, there's no like login afterward, even though it might show something like that.

52:05.598 --> 52:11.001
GigaOM Biological also watches Housatonic Live at housatonicits.com.

52:12.641 --> 52:16.403
Mark's work is really, really important for my work.

52:17.564 --> 52:24.307
He's helped me a lot to see what mentors are involved in passing down these ideas and making sure that they're gatekept

52:25.207 --> 52:30.490
And I consider Mark part of this little intellectual bright web that I'm trying to inspire to develop online.

52:31.330 --> 52:51.901
A group of people that fax checks each other, that builds up a network of trust that's not based on their rumbled connection with Elon Musk or their hopes to be part of the Trump administration, but actually their connections to the multicultural, multiracial melting pot of America.

52:53.382 --> 52:57.744
and my Indian Filipino mom and my Norwegian French dad.

52:57.764 --> 53:00.485
I guess that's about the best guess I got for you.

53:01.506 --> 53:14.793
You know, I'm a multiracial individual and I'm a pain in the ass for this narrative on the internet where there's about four ethnicities and they're all working together to do stuff, you know, to sell stuff.

53:15.693 --> 53:44.276
To stop the pandemic to make sure the truth of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine gets out there to make the truth About vaccines something whatever that truth is it's getting out there and all you got to do is join in All you got to do is chalk up your hands and and get a spot on the train and start helping all you got to do is pull on the rope and that illusion on the on on social media is is of a military

53:45.541 --> 53:49.564
scale, a military precision and a military effectiveness.

53:50.865 --> 53:56.810
This video is spectacular because you have to realize that it's not just one guy goofing around.

53:57.250 --> 54:12.362
If there were a hundred dudes and a few people sitting there encouraging them and a few more people giving them water, you might start to take it very very much more seriously even though you know trains don't need people to stop or start them.

54:17.222 --> 54:18.703
Oh, it crashed just in time.

54:18.803 --> 54:19.183
Perfect.

54:19.223 --> 54:25.187
So I'm gonna spin down here and restart this video.

54:25.227 --> 54:26.248
Apologize for that.

54:28.009 --> 54:28.549
Here we go.

54:29.269 --> 54:29.650
Excellent.

54:30.790 --> 54:35.073
Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google all need to be broken up.

54:40.157 --> 54:45.699
We are joined by Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist and founder and host of his show, The War Room.

54:45.899 --> 54:47.260
Steven, thank you so much for joining us.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.421
There is obviously a lot going on.

54:50.141 --> 54:58.384
So he's got two working shirts on, he's got three pens, and I'm sure that this is all bullshit.

55:01.621 --> 55:03.302
I mean, it's a costume that he wears.

55:03.422 --> 55:10.086
He gets that Carhartt jacket on over the top of this and messes his hair up a little bit.

55:10.546 --> 55:11.787
It is a schtick.

55:12.087 --> 55:12.748
It's fake.

55:13.168 --> 55:15.669
He's a former Goldman Sachs dude.

55:16.490 --> 55:17.811
He doesn't dress like this.

55:18.911 --> 55:20.332
It's a schtick.

55:21.493 --> 55:26.316
It is a traitorous, malevolent scam.

55:27.688 --> 55:32.052
And he's one of the worst Americans alive, quite frankly, because of what he's doing here.

55:32.092 --> 55:33.794
Look at the smirk on his face.

55:36.136 --> 55:45.885
Could talk about, but for the purpose of this interview, I really do want to drill down specifically on the news of Spotify's decision to reinstate your content after removing it in 2020.

55:46.205 --> 55:48.307
Your reaction to- Spotify.

55:48.707 --> 55:51.991
Oh, Spotify is going to reinstate Steve Bannon.

55:52.091 --> 55:53.072
Oh, that's great.

55:54.127 --> 55:56.849
Just like YouTube is reinstating James Corbett.

55:56.869 --> 55:57.369
That's great.

55:57.429 --> 56:03.854
Maybe soon, Bret Weinstein's channel will be monetized again and then all will be well in the universe.

56:07.637 --> 56:12.540
This, why you're returning, and whether you feel like your approach has evolved since you were initially removed.

56:12.560 --> 56:17.564
So I'm just curious, I mean, how did you start talking with them five years after the fact?

56:17.644 --> 56:19.225
Who initiated those conversations?

56:19.642 --> 56:20.663
I think they might have reached out.

56:20.723 --> 56:23.265
My team's been talking to them for a couple of months.

56:23.545 --> 56:29.689
I believe the reason is that, you know, on the Apple podcast, we're always up near the top, right in back of Pod Save America.

56:29.829 --> 56:37.995
It's the, I think it's the most significant platform for MAGA, and particularly, we don't cover a lot of the stuff a lot of the other shows do so much better than us.

56:38.095 --> 56:41.938
We've heard you're sort of aiming to reach a wider audience with your return to Spotify.

56:42.378 --> 56:46.721
How do you think the show's content or tone has changed, if at all, since 2020?

56:47.984 --> 56:51.526
I don't, you know, we were the first people ever to really talk about the pandemic.

56:51.566 --> 56:58.029
We, and that we changed the name of the show from Worm Impeachment to Worm Pandemic on the 20th of January, 2020, we were a couple of months ahead.

56:58.529 --> 57:01.511
And five days later, he said it was a lab leak.

57:02.552 --> 57:03.832
January 25th.

57:03.932 --> 57:09.155
And I think on my birthday on the 28th, he had Steve Hatfill on.

57:10.816 --> 57:14.640
He changed the name from War Room Election.

57:14.700 --> 57:15.160
What was it?

57:15.180 --> 57:19.004
War Room something to War Room Pandemic on January 20th.

57:19.545 --> 57:22.688
Five days later, he said it was a lab leak.

57:23.229 --> 57:24.230
Check it yourself.

57:26.138 --> 57:27.778
We pride ourselves of being cutting edge.

57:27.898 --> 57:32.140
I think the show is actually much more aggressive than we were in the past.

57:32.700 --> 57:44.103
I know that Spotify had had a problem when we called for and I was being metaphoric as you I'm sure heard in the editorial room of the of the New York Post many times putting heads on pikes.

57:44.683 --> 57:48.644
And I made a comment about the day before two days before we talked about Thomas Moore.

57:49.424 --> 58:06.220
And in the Man for All Seasons, of which they put his head on a pike and we use it metaphorically about Christopher Wray and Dr. Fauci, two people who I might know, or at least Fauci, who went and got a blanket preemptive pardon right from the Biden administration by auto pen, we think.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.161
And they had a problem with that, they took us down.

58:08.621 --> 58:12.582
Look, we have a saying in the war room, no whining in the war room, no crying in the war room.

58:13.303 --> 58:15.243
We never reached out to people when they took us down.

58:15.283 --> 58:19.185
We were deplatformed by everybody around Instagram, TikTok, YouTube.

58:20.205 --> 58:22.806
We were deplatformed by everybody.

58:22.866 --> 58:24.847
So it's the standard narrative, right?

58:24.887 --> 58:30.129
You can tell the real truth tellers because they were deplatformed at the beginning of the pandemic.

58:30.889 --> 58:32.530
None of these people lost a job.

58:33.965 --> 58:43.112
None of these people were at a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine faculty position and then were told not to come in because the faculty's scared of you for talking about transfection.

58:47.876 --> 58:48.296
None of them.

58:51.707 --> 59:08.442
He's talking about the rise in his popularity, the rise in his influence of his podcast, the rise in the influence of these different platforms like X. And he will say that specifically, X, because that's what they are doing.

59:08.482 --> 59:16.469
They are promoting the formation of an internet, which is a substitute for any kind of

59:17.526 --> 59:23.608
what would have been called mainstream media before, like TV and radio and stuff like that.

59:23.708 --> 59:30.651
Now they want something that can be just projected over the whole planet, one narrative control network.

59:30.831 --> 59:46.557
And if they form that, if they are able to form that, then the power that is represented by the New York Times and all of these other places, even the power that Hollywood has over people will be secondary to the access that people

59:48.712 --> 59:51.713
give away when they use social media every day.

59:53.954 --> 01:00:07.200
Never mind try to usefully interact with the world on social media because that's the real... if you're just there to look what people are lying about that's one thing but if you're going there to try and make money or to become you know

01:00:09.371 --> 01:00:10.611
get your word out.

01:00:11.852 --> 01:00:13.753
It is not that kind of place.

01:00:13.913 --> 01:00:14.354
It's not.

01:00:14.514 --> 01:00:15.134
It's really not.

01:00:15.254 --> 01:00:16.255
Everything is programmed.

01:00:16.595 --> 01:00:18.156
Oh, it wasn't Twitter.

01:00:18.676 --> 01:00:19.657
It wasn't out of the ordinary.

01:00:19.777 --> 01:00:23.139
I think our content is the same, probably more hard hitting than ever.

01:00:23.279 --> 01:00:25.720
But look, these guys have managed a good business.

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.062
We never reached out to them or complained when they took us off.

01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:30.804
We just took it as, hey, that's the natural order of things.

01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:33.705
And eventually, you know, maybe we'll get back together.

01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:34.946
We put a deal together.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:36.227
We're going to launch.

01:00:36.787 --> 01:01:00.099
on monday and they're paying him we put a deal together uh and we couldn't be more excited about it we think they manage a great platform and clearly you go from censorship to big contracts it's fantastic isn't it i mean it seems like that's exactly what has happened to all of these people

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:11.111
You know, they go from losing their hospital position, supposedly, to having their own business that's online and making 10 times as much as they made.

01:01:11.131 --> 01:01:13.614
And they're so happy they went private.

01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:28.463
Boy, I love being a fellow of both the Brownstone Institute and IMA and the World Health Organization, or the World Council for Health, because that really mounts to like, you know, $12,000 a month.

01:01:28.523 --> 01:01:29.964
It's perfect for rent and everything.

01:01:30.585 --> 01:01:32.046
Plus most of the travel's free.

01:01:32.066 --> 01:01:32.706
This is great.

01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:34.368
They're the industry leaders.

01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:40.852
I was told that if I keep doing it hard enough, I'm gonna get a Skyhorse book in 2026.

01:01:42.434 --> 01:01:43.995
More people have access to the world.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:48.071
Yeah, and I do want to get into that because you are reaching a very wide audience.

01:01:48.412 --> 01:01:52.078
A lot of people on the left, in the center, on the right, all tuning in to listen to you.

01:01:52.419 --> 01:01:53.300
So it's funny, right?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.484
Because that's what Peter Hotez and

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:05.124
And ZDogg agreed on is that one thing that a health freedom movement can do is unite people on both sides of the aisle.

01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:08.607
I wonder where they learned that from.

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:16.331
Did they learn that from the operation in the UK where Pauly Tommy was on billboards swaying 6 million votes for prime minister?

01:02:16.752 --> 01:02:23.656
Did the Goldman Sachs operatives see that as a test run or like, holy shit, I know how we could do that over here.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.458
And I know who we could use to do it.

01:02:29.921 --> 01:02:35.237
stop lying oh my goodness part of the deal though did spotify

01:02:36.539 --> 01:02:40.042
give you any guardrails or say you can't talk about this or that?

01:02:40.783 --> 01:02:42.645
No, we would never accept a deal like that.

01:02:42.745 --> 01:02:43.505
And they didn't.

01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:48.790
I think, look, at the time, I can understand, you know, this was during the pandemic.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:53.334
Also, it was, you know, we were pretty hot running on the election fraud.

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:55.296
We're still adamant that the election was stolen.

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:57.578
We want to adjudicate that publicly.

01:02:57.618 --> 01:02:59.219
We think that information has got to come out.

01:02:59.259 --> 01:02:59.880
If it turns out

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:02.854
We were wrong, we were wrong, we don't think so.

01:03:03.195 --> 01:03:06.360
But like I said- Wow, look at how wishy-washy that is.

01:03:07.952 --> 01:03:14.976
I'm driving everybody to believe that the election was rigged, the election is fraud, but if it turns out to be wrong, then I guess I'm wrong.

01:03:15.016 --> 01:03:17.078
I mean, think about that for a second.

01:03:18.979 --> 01:03:23.582
That is like the worst thing that you could say unless you're not a patriot.

01:03:24.202 --> 01:03:28.365
It's the worst level of certainty that you could have unless you're not a patriot.

01:03:28.945 --> 01:03:33.388
That's just an absolute jackass right there admitting that that's all he is.

01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:39.912
It's been screaming the war room and election stealing for the last six months.

01:03:39.972 --> 01:03:45.194
But, but, uh, you know, now I changed to the pandemic because I've got so much integrity.

01:03:45.274 --> 01:03:47.075
I need three pens and two shirts.

01:03:48.382 --> 01:03:52.744
I think we're harder hitting now than we've ever been, particularly on some hot button issues.

01:03:52.804 --> 01:03:59.007
But no, there was no discussion at all about any type of content that was off limits, and we would never agree to that anyway.

01:03:59.027 --> 01:04:13.853
But I believe they looked at the show over the last couple of years, and they see what we do day in and day out, the type of guests we have, and how a lot of our people are at the senior levels of the government, and there's a ton more at the more working levels of the government.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:19.739
Are you concerned, I mean, given the fact that this has happened before now where you were... So he kind of admits it there, right?

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:27.488
And one of the things that you probably haven't considered is that social media and its programmers don't need to focus on Joe Mainstreet.

01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:33.355
They actually really only need to focus their programming on government employees.

01:04:34.755 --> 01:04:40.101
Because that's of course what a militarized social media would be concerned with, right?

01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:45.747
People with power being controlled, people without power being neutralized or distracted.

01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:51.293
So he says he's got a lot of followers inside of the Beltway, you know, and whatever else.

01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:56.719
Yeah, that's because that's where social media focuses its programming and its analysis.

01:04:58.143 --> 01:05:05.968
and make sure that, I mean, if they're gonna test anything, if they're gonna use it anywhere, they're not gonna use it on some guy in the back of his garage.

01:05:06.008 --> 01:05:08.569
They're just gonna turn his off.

01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:20.876
They use it on people with power and they use it very well because everybody in office is using social media unless they're read in onto the military use of it.

01:05:21.697 --> 01:05:24.819
That may even be why they had this little signal chat

01:05:26.004 --> 01:05:35.909
you know, theater a couple weeks ago or a month ago or whenever it was, just to emphasize that Signal is a place where you can have various private conversations.

01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:38.331
It's just that they shouldn't have done it with the way that they did it.

01:05:39.111 --> 01:05:40.512
Signal, don't forget about Signal.

01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:41.212
Did you hear the name?

01:05:41.232 --> 01:05:51.298
Band, are you concerned that in another three, four years that these tech companies could have another reversal and you would maybe be silenced again?

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.180
This is for everybody, and even for people on the left.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.461
That's what we're adamant about.

01:05:56.241 --> 01:06:00.683
Right now, we're a big supporter of President Trump's administration is really going after the oligarchs.

01:06:01.183 --> 01:06:05.446
If you look at- He's really going after the oligarchs, but Palantir's cool.

01:06:06.186 --> 01:06:08.667
Palantir can make any databases they want to.

01:06:08.727 --> 01:06:15.290
We can put together all the databases of all the databases and all the medical records and all the remnant sequences.

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:19.352
I mean, imagine the scenario.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:20.653
Here's a good one for you.

01:06:22.205 --> 01:06:32.268
Imagine the scenario where they think that there's going to be some geophysical event coming, you know, like one, one every 11,800 years, the pole is going to reverse, and there's going to be giant tidal waves.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:41.811
And so they've been building underground bunkers and stuff to prepare for this, then what is the other consequence of that from the perspective of the human genome project?

01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:45.473
Holy shit, we better sequence these people before they're washed away.

01:06:45.873 --> 01:06:47.873
And we better find a way to store that data.

01:06:47.894 --> 01:06:49.094
And we better do it fast.

01:06:50.913 --> 01:07:03.183
I mean, it's very easy to see most of what's going on right now as easily justifiable if you told a story in the back rooms and took people into a couple underground passages and showed them a couple big metal doors and said, look,

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:07.263
We got cities underground because we're ready for this shit.

01:07:07.743 --> 01:07:09.764
There's a lot of data that's going to be gone.

01:07:09.824 --> 01:07:11.986
A lot of data we're never going to be able to collect again.

01:07:12.046 --> 01:07:20.231
So you can think that you're, you're protecting some society here, but this is all going to be washed away, man.

01:07:20.271 --> 01:07:22.812
When the pole shifts, everything is going to be gone.

01:07:22.852 --> 01:07:33.979
And the only people that survive are going to be everybody that gets on the plane with Peter Thiel and goes to New Zealand and the people that have the keys to the underground passages that start in the Colorado airport.

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:34.499
That's it.

01:07:34.599 --> 01:07:36.240
Everybody else is SOL.

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:41.002
I think that people have been told that story.

01:07:41.063 --> 01:07:43.564
Not a lot of people, but people are telling that story.

01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:57.551
I think the idea that there's going to be a huge collapse of the population pyramid and so that we need to be prepared for that is definitely a story that's been told because that story is backed by real math.

01:07:59.712 --> 01:08:01.293
And this guy is a performer.

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:11.598
former Goldman Sachs employee, self-declared intellectual property expert, and master manipulator.

01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:17.390
First off, they got Google in a federal court in Northern Virginia.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:22.453
I should just say, really, a master thespian, because he's not a master manipulator.

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:29.497
All actors, if they are really good at it and their craft, can play a role very convincingly.

01:08:29.617 --> 01:08:32.678
It's the role that he plays very convincingly here.

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:37.141
And right down to the ridiculous outfit.

01:08:38.519 --> 01:08:39.460
Federal Court in D.C.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:44.742
going after the monopoly on search engine and on advertising.

01:08:45.502 --> 01:08:47.683
We got Facebook and Federal Court FTC.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:57.908
Facebook, essentially Zuckerberg and Twitter, tried to destroy the New York Post and the paper Hamilton founded, Amiranda Devine, off of something that was absolutely truthful.

01:08:58.248 --> 01:09:03.150
And if it had been properly promoted on social media, would it change the direction?

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:07.513
Think about so many details and stories you don't understand.

01:09:08.194 --> 01:09:09.835
What a manipulative bastard.

01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.237
I mean really what a manipulative bastard.

01:09:12.257 --> 01:09:13.017
Let's go back to 2020.

01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:17.300
What the hell?

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.221
Why isn't it playing?

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:24.646
Why isn't it playing?

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:25.927
Oh, I didn't have it up there.

01:09:26.007 --> 01:09:26.247
Shoot.

01:09:29.249 --> 01:09:30.370
It's always the same thing.

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:32.812
I don't have it quite programmed like I wanted it to.

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:36.767
Thank you.

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:38.488
Thank you.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.168
Thank you everybody.

01:09:39.188 --> 01:09:45.330
Thank you.

01:09:49.671 --> 01:09:50.131
Thank you.

01:09:50.171 --> 01:09:51.552
Thank you everyone.

01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:56.954
I love you too.

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.336
Thank you, thank you.

01:10:02.356 --> 01:10:12.242
So I'm so happy tonight we can get gathering here and celebrate the first year of anniversary of our new Federal State of China.

01:10:17.498 --> 01:10:21.042
It is not just an event for anniversary.

01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:34.657
Actually, for our Chinese people, we know how tough, how difficult we have to overcome numerous difficulties we face to the life's race, and finally,

01:10:35.177 --> 01:10:56.540
we can push the whistleblower movement, and we can make China government, Chinese Communist Party, and even China military scared of us, because we reveal the truth to the world, which they want to block, which they want to suppress, and which they want to cover up, and even take over the world.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:13.462
So the Chinese Communist Party wants to take over the world, and Li Minyan is going to stop them with a free, federated Republic of China, I think.

01:11:13.943 --> 01:11:16.563
We Chinese people are smart.

01:11:17.423 --> 01:11:19.244
We Chinese people work hard.

01:11:19.924 --> 01:11:23.405
We Chinese people are very honest.

01:11:23.765 --> 01:11:25.886
We are the good people.

01:11:26.266 --> 01:11:29.927
But China government try to tell the world

01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:33.688
We are someone who are not honest.

01:11:34.068 --> 01:11:43.191
We are someone cunning, and we are someone rude, and we are someone cannot get along very well with the Western civilization.

01:11:43.391 --> 01:11:54.254
No, now we use our action to tell people they are wrong, and we are going to remove this Chinese Communist Party regime and their communism ideology.

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:58.795
We will tell the world we Chinese people can work very well

01:11:59.195 --> 01:12:07.441
with the Western people, with democratic culture, with the Western civilization, and also combined with our virtues from our Chinese culture.

01:12:07.881 --> 01:12:11.123
We won't tell the world that we are brave people.

01:12:11.403 --> 01:12:15.546
We use our actions to show the world we dare to stand out.

01:12:15.987 --> 01:12:21.050
And now, we dare to tell the world the truth, especially during historic pandemic.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:27.675
We tell the world that the virus, COVID-19 virus, come from the lab in Wuhan.

01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:42.684
now i don't know if you're noticing this right now but i'm noticing it she hasn't said um once she's never missed a word um it's pretty remarkable actually how fluent she is

01:12:43.717 --> 01:12:53.979
given, and how deep her vocabulary is, how much she can remember, given that by her accent, it sure sounds like she just started speaking English like a year ago.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:13:13.064
It was created by the Chinese Communist Party regime and also the China military scientists together with their colleagues overseas, and then get along with the scientific misinformation campaign internationally involved Dr. Fauci, CDC in US,

01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:26.940
and said Nature magazine, WHO, even yesterday the NIH director Francis Coddings is talking on Fox News said he still think bioweapon is a conspiracy.

01:13:28.089 --> 01:13:35.791
He still thinks that it's from some nature virus, maybe somehow the bat fly to the lab and then jump out.

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:41.672
So still that is nothing about Chinese unrestricted bioweapons.

01:13:41.693 --> 01:13:43.413
He still call that conspiracy.

01:13:43.713 --> 01:13:47.414
Now, even the emails reveal that what I talk

01:13:47.834 --> 01:13:59.761
what I told Mr. Mulder and what Mr. Mulder delivered to the world, what our waste of power movement people tried to tell the world from last January that these are the people who work with Chinese Communist Party.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:03.143
They are using misinformation, using lies and denial.

01:14:03.503 --> 01:14:06.225
They try to cover up that fact.

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:09.528
It's novel, non-traditional bioweapon.

01:14:09.568 --> 01:14:10.889
Wow, I didn't know that.

01:14:27.606 --> 01:14:35.149
of the lab in Wuhan to the innocent people, make them become the first victims in the world.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:39.171
And because I revealed it from 19 January, 2020.

01:14:39.931 --> 01:14:48.895
So 19th January, 2020 was one day before Bannon would change the name of his war room to War Room Pandemic.

01:14:49.415 --> 01:14:52.897
And five days after that, he would declare it was a lab leak.

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:58.633
Because Mr. Luther, he dared to talk about it through his YouTube channel.

01:14:58.673 --> 01:15:02.214
He faced a big risk, and then China government scared.

01:15:02.474 --> 01:15:06.276
So China government immediately changed their plans.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:09.037
So they have to admit human to human transmission.

01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:14.220
They have to tell people, yes, there are more and more cases happened already, and then they have to

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:28.627
finally lock down Wuhan in a very inhumanity way, but at the same time, they deliberately take the advantage of this outbreak and spread the virus to the world, and then tell people this is just a flu.

01:15:29.347 --> 01:15:30.648
And then they tell people what?

01:15:31.148 --> 01:15:49.143
they bring out the PPE from U.S., from other countries, and then they know hydroxychloroquine works because we, Dr. Moore, Mr. Luder, and me, we tell the world from 29th January that there are drugs for COVID-19 virus.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:53.566
Efficient and safe drug which we have used for many, many years.

01:15:53.586 --> 01:15:57.790
WHO said that is one of the safest drug in the world, hydroxychloroquine.

01:15:58.190 --> 01:16:00.372
China government then, four days later,

01:16:00.712 --> 01:16:25.691
China military just remember that right now in America Pierre Corey has a book about ivermectin There's a Canadian doctor who's saying ivermectin plus a number of different things can cure cancer Nobody's pushing ivermectin as a cure for anything right now except for maybe the doctors who still sell it but nobody in the in the big narrative Brett Weinstein never talked about hydroxychloroquine and

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:32.910
Remember that because that is it is something to keep straight in your mind.

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:52.687
This is this is the narrative moving on Apply the patent that hydroxychloroquine can be used for new purpose as trade COVID-19 But then they don't tell the West and even later when President Trump at that time tells the world that hydroxychloroquine can protect you what happened

01:16:53.428 --> 01:17:06.615
Dr. Fauci in his email, he's happy to say some doctor tried to discriminate President Trump's word and then they use the fake data together finally to suppress hydroxychloroquine.

01:17:07.235 --> 01:17:09.556
There are brave doctors in the world.

01:17:09.856 --> 01:17:11.797
There are brave scientists in the world.

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:13.838
There are brave nurses in the world.

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:20.662
Another email from Dr. Fauci's emails, we see one Harbin nurse, young nurse in China,

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:37.514
in mid-February, try to tell some truth to NIH, and they try to alarm the world that even last February, China government is covering up the death cases, and they don't ask people to get treated properly.

01:17:37.955 --> 01:17:38.555
But what?

01:17:39.115 --> 01:17:43.258
Fauci shared it with another people, and later we heard

01:17:44.119 --> 01:17:46.541
that something may happen to the nurse.

01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:52.004
Our intelligence shows, which we cannot confirm, but we know this.

01:17:52.424 --> 01:17:53.885
Listen to this nonsense.

01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:54.886
This is in 2020.

01:17:55.346 --> 01:17:58.708
This is extraordinary if you see it from our perspective now.

01:17:58.728 --> 01:18:02.530
The news was not revealed by Dr. Fauci, and he pretended he know nothing.

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:07.433
And then he work with China government, work with other people on his side.

01:18:07.913 --> 01:18:09.755
They criticize President Trump.

01:18:10.695 --> 01:18:12.275
with Chinese Communist Party.

01:18:12.675 --> 01:18:18.636
They said, you US people, your democracy actually is something failed.

01:18:18.916 --> 01:18:20.717
You should learn from the dictatorship.

01:18:21.017 --> 01:18:29.698
Like Chinese Communist Party, that's why our Winnie Bear, our chairman, she sits there, said, oh, we are celebrating the anti-COVID trophy.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:31.259
You should learn from us.

01:18:31.579 --> 01:18:34.199
You should praise us.

01:18:35.259 --> 01:18:39.540
That's what we read from the top medical journal.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.201
like mindset, like nature, like science.

01:18:43.642 --> 01:18:46.243
They, yeah, they work with them all together.

01:18:46.543 --> 01:18:54.526
So all these things, actually, I keep delivering through Mr. Mulder's YouTube from January until end of April in Chinese.

01:18:54.586 --> 01:19:03.170
But somehow, also at that time, we have our great friend, like Mr. Benno, like Mr. Bill Goss, and like many other people, like Dr. Navarro.

01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:04.471
We have our brave friends.

01:19:04.751 --> 01:19:06.392
They know this intelligence.

01:19:06.732 --> 01:19:09.393
And they try to deliver it to the US people, too.

01:19:09.693 --> 01:19:18.198
And also, they face a lot of criticism from mainstream media, from Dr. Fauci, from NIH, from all these people.

01:19:18.478 --> 01:19:27.644
So what I want to tell you now, these are just little bit things happen on the way when we try to expose the fact of COVID-19 to people.

01:19:28.124 --> 01:19:29.225
It's very hard.

01:19:29.826 --> 01:19:31.527
I face my stress.

01:19:32.707 --> 01:19:35.489
My family is under the strict surveillance.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:38.771
It's almost like staying in the prison in China.

01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:41.072
I have to cut off my connection with them.

01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:49.978
And I know many people like President Trump and like Mr. Bannon, like Mr. Bill Gertz.

01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:56.462
Mr. Bill Gertz is the guy who published my quote in the Washington Times in May or April of 2020.

01:19:56.502 --> 01:19:56.822
Bill Gertz.

01:19:59.372 --> 01:20:03.893
have been told by other people that Bill Gertz is definitely an insider, not a good guy.

01:20:05.174 --> 01:20:13.556
So to be put in that article by Bill Gertz is, in retrospect, kind of, it's obvious now.

01:20:14.616 --> 01:20:16.757
And I have a good friend, Mayor Rudy.

01:20:17.814 --> 01:20:21.455
Mayor Rudy, so she's good friends with the mayor of New York.

01:20:21.515 --> 01:20:26.397
Does that explain why her marriage license is in New York?

01:20:27.477 --> 01:20:31.879
It's starting to make her accent sound weirder and weirder every minute.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.101
and I'm of course I'm the nuts, some pants on fire, all these things.

01:20:40.521 --> 01:20:51.605
All the people like Tucker and other media in India, in Spanish, in Italian, when they try to interview me, they get the straights and some of them has to stop their interview.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:55.046
That's why, although we try a lot, still now our voice is kind of limited.

01:20:55.066 --> 01:20:57.787
I hope my stream is not crashing again.

01:20:57.927 --> 01:21:00.568
But now I'm so happy because after one year's effort,

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:12.972
Sorry about that I will I will leave it there.

01:21:12.992 --> 01:21:15.374
I'm gonna go back to that video though.

01:21:15.394 --> 01:21:22.542
I I guess I can't leave it there I just want to show the end of it My reports

01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:31.714
So if you don't realize that, you will let them go.

01:21:32.214 --> 01:21:33.735
And they will keep working on that.

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:35.056
I'm just a virologist.

01:21:35.617 --> 01:21:40.761
I work in the top virology lab in the world for over five years.

01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:44.463
And my husband is also the top coronavirus expert.

01:21:44.523 --> 01:21:46.325
Also now he's working with China government.

01:21:46.745 --> 01:21:49.647
And my supervisor also WHO core expert.

01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:53.294
Oh, so her husband is working for the Chinese government right now.

01:21:53.435 --> 01:21:53.775
Nice.

01:21:53.895 --> 01:21:55.438
So her husband's a shithead too.

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:55.618
Nice.

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:10.128
And China, from at least 2010, conducted by China CDC, had George Fugel.

01:22:10.588 --> 01:22:14.910
They tried to search the new animal virus all over China.

01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:25.953
Not only coronavirus, but also dengue, Zika, Ebola, West Nile virus, and the hentai virus, all the dangerous virus.

01:22:26.053 --> 01:22:29.915
Especially they want to search something can make your brain damaged.

01:22:30.902 --> 01:22:38.586
which now we say, yeah, in COVID-19, there are one third of people after infection, they gather brain problems.

01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:39.667
Wow.

01:22:39.807 --> 01:22:45.110
Just like the spars pandemic, just like Kevin McCairn said, wow.

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:47.571
One third of the people have brain damage.

01:22:47.611 --> 01:22:50.173
That's why that lady was licking the window in UK.

01:22:50.193 --> 01:22:52.074
And that's what, wow.

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.097
We need to solve it.

01:22:55.657 --> 01:23:09.005
So now I stay here, stand here, we are celebrating the things, and we are celebrating rule of law foundation, rule of society foundation, their help, their work, because they help me, save me from Hong Kong.

01:23:09.065 --> 01:23:12.748
I can stay here, tell people, I'm still survive.

01:23:13.628 --> 01:23:18.052
What I want to call for is we need to spread the truth all over the world.

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:23.797
We need to, as a government, as a scientist, as a doctor, let everyone understand what happened to us.

01:23:24.117 --> 01:23:26.739
Yes, we are in unrestricted biowarfare.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.003
Unrestricted, I defend, because it's out of restriction.

01:23:31.263 --> 01:23:35.647
That means China used many, many ways to conduct the

01:23:35.987 --> 01:23:43.934
My only purpose is to destroy your economic, destroy your social order, destroy your civilization.

01:23:44.074 --> 01:23:47.137
Finally, let you all controlled by Chinese Communist Party.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.338
At that time, remember, I'm a Chinese.

01:23:49.559 --> 01:23:51.220
I tell you, at that time, it's late.

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:52.541
It's late for all of us.

01:23:52.801 --> 01:23:55.644
No future, no next generation, no security.

01:23:56.304 --> 01:23:57.105
Nothing else.

01:24:01.049 --> 01:24:02.510
I'm not sure what they're clapping for.

01:24:04.815 --> 01:24:07.097
Okay, I think, thank you, thank you.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:10.960
I think we are run out of time.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.383
So I will pass the time to our next honored guest.

01:24:14.923 --> 01:24:17.946
And yeah, I will keep fighting until the last minute.

01:24:18.506 --> 01:24:21.408
Last minute, for me, all for Chinese Communist Party.

01:24:21.688 --> 01:24:21.989
Thank you.

01:24:29.226 --> 01:24:39.150
Dr. Li Min Yang is not only a hero to the Chinese people, not only a hero to the American people, she's a hero to all mankind.

01:24:56.076 --> 01:24:57.317
The last thing I want to say,

01:24:58.382 --> 01:25:11.848
When Dr. Li-Man Yang left Hong Kong in the middle of the night because of the great work of the Rule of Law Foundation, the Rule of Law Society, the great heroes there and supporters, she defected and came out with tremendous danger to herself.

01:25:12.729 --> 01:25:20.132
When she first got here, I think we spent three, four, five days in due diligence with lawyers and scientists and all of that.

01:25:20.972 --> 01:25:26.035
And I have to say about her personal journey, she was very meek.

01:25:27.236 --> 01:25:27.977
Very shy.

01:25:27.997 --> 01:25:34.722
The woman that was on the stage tonight was so shy and so demurred.

01:25:34.742 --> 01:25:51.415
I got to tell you, one year of breathing the fresh air of freedom has... We have to get her citizenship because we need her to run for the United States Senate.

01:25:53.797 --> 01:25:54.438
Thank you.

01:25:55.655 --> 01:25:56.295
Thank you.

01:25:56.355 --> 01:25:57.476
Thank you, everyone.

01:25:57.836 --> 01:26:00.956
I cannot name all the people who helped me.

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:06.418
Mayor Rudy, Mr. Bannon, Dr. Navarro, Mr. Bill Gertz.

01:26:07.738 --> 01:26:18.941
Those four names alone, Dr. Navarro, scientific advisor to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, like Bill Gertz.

01:26:19.562 --> 01:26:24.883
I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the time right now for America to wake up.

01:26:26.263 --> 01:26:46.319
It's the time for people on the left to realize how trapped their neighbors are in this illusion, in this illusion of what Trump is, and also realize that they're trapped because their Trump derangement syndrome, their inability to process anything reasonable when Trump is in the picture is also part of this script.

01:26:48.241 --> 01:26:49.302
Perfectly played.

01:26:51.129 --> 01:26:58.394
A good friend of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton has played us twice, and he's in his second term of playing us.

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:10.762
And the social media moguls that would like to use social media to become super national governors of our societies online?

01:27:11.713 --> 01:27:12.793
They are doing it too.

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:32.420
They are in cahoots because it is a national security operation designed to put a control grid and information technology gathering grid in place so that as much data can be collected as possible before the population pyramids collapse.

01:27:34.661 --> 01:27:38.962
The people, our honored guests, the Morgan family, all the people.

01:27:39.002 --> 01:27:40.263
The Morgan family.

01:27:53.069 --> 01:27:55.771
I'm declaring war on fat gay kids.

01:27:57.312 --> 01:28:03.236
Not the kids themselves, but on whatever's making them so fat, gay, and pathetic.

01:28:03.977 --> 01:28:12.183
I'm talking seed oils, SSRIs, MSNBC, and perverts masquerading as teachers and guidance counselors.

01:28:13.095 --> 01:28:18.319
So the danger of AI is that history can be effectively erased.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.121
This is not a perfect AI video, but it's pretty good.

01:28:23.222 --> 01:28:33.089
And from the perspective of people getting their information from a small phone and a quick scroll, it is not the fakes that you need to be concerned about.

01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:35.451
It's the idea that no one has faith anymore.

01:28:36.474 --> 01:28:38.375
No one has faith in the truth anymore.

01:28:39.075 --> 01:28:39.996
That's a problem.

01:28:40.736 --> 01:28:44.258
If it becomes a world of lies, whose world is it then?

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:46.599
It's definitely not ours.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.901
It's scripted bullshit, ladies and gentlemen.

01:28:51.021 --> 01:28:53.982
Even the AI fakes on the internet are scripted bullshit.

01:28:54.002 --> 01:28:58.124
They're designed to lead you to believe that there's even a

01:29:00.896 --> 01:29:02.377
I'm glad that's paused a little bit.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:07.743
There's even a plausible deniability, should there be AI in between?

01:29:08.263 --> 01:29:10.345
Should there be social media in between?

01:29:10.485 --> 01:29:21.336
In other words, if there's murder happening somewhere in the world, but the only information that you can get is from social media, then if that's a convenient way of denying something, you can.

01:29:24.179 --> 01:29:35.656
If you employ somewhere in the military chain, some AI generated data points, then at any point in time, you have plausible deniability for why the bomb went off on the wrong car.

01:29:37.244 --> 01:29:41.645
There's this one gear in the mesh here that we can't really control.

01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:43.165
It's kind of just a wild card.

01:29:43.825 --> 01:29:54.727
And that wild card could be as fake as the domain server, where you just, you know, write a program with five lines that prints out silicoxib, famotidine, ivermectin, and remdesivir.

01:29:58.408 --> 01:30:03.489
I think it's still really important to do our homework, so I'm going back in time right now.

01:30:05.748 --> 01:30:12.310
Maybe it might be important for us first though to take a break and have a musical break for a second.

01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:16.951
I'm gonna do that now, and then I'm gonna go back to Bobby's video.

01:30:16.971 --> 01:30:23.353
So I'll have to stop and start the video twice, or the slide deck twice, but that's alright, I think this will work out okay.

01:30:24.213 --> 01:30:29.195
I'll be back in a second, and again I'm just taking a little break here to get my water filled up and stuff.

01:30:31.158 --> 01:30:32.239
Thank you very much for being here.

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.780
It's been really great.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.943
I'm really excited about the progress that we are making.

01:30:38.344 --> 01:30:41.727
I'm really starting to like piano music, so this is kind of a selection for you.

01:30:42.808 --> 01:30:47.693
What I have come to understand is jamming on the piano, at least recently.

01:30:48.433 --> 01:30:49.314
And I'll see you in a few minutes.

01:31:17.895 --> 01:31:18.095
you

01:32:14.526 --> 01:32:14.666
you

01:33:02.538 --> 01:33:03.321
Mm.

01:34:38.721 --> 01:34:38.962
you

01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:15.570
do do

01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:48.152
Isolation and purification.

01:35:48.632 --> 01:35:50.414
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:35:52.436 --> 01:35:52.816
Isolation?

01:35:52.836 --> 01:35:53.177
What was it?

01:35:53.317 --> 01:35:56.260
Isolation and purification.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.001
Of the virus?

01:35:57.101 --> 01:35:57.301
Yes.

01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:01.946
So you isolate a virus by... That was Brad Mildow.

01:36:01.966 --> 01:36:02.006
Um...

01:36:07.108 --> 01:36:09.589
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:36:10.249 --> 01:36:15.131
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:36:15.671 --> 01:36:18.233
I don't understand what the issue.

01:36:18.433 --> 01:36:23.495
They interchanged the two and I wasn't sure if it was the same thing or if it was two totally different.

01:36:24.595 --> 01:36:25.776
No, it depends on how they used it.

01:36:27.816 --> 01:36:34.099
Sorry, typing M-E-H-L-D-A-U is the name you're looking for, Christy.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:36.660
Okay.

01:36:37.577 --> 01:36:40.341
Can you explain the process of HIV isolation?

01:36:42.865 --> 01:36:44.828
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

01:36:44.888 --> 01:36:50.917
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

01:36:50.997 --> 01:36:53.020
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

01:37:09.417 --> 01:37:10.398
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:10.418 --> 01:37:11.859
Welcome to the show, the second half.

01:37:11.879 --> 01:37:15.963
This is GigaOM Biological, high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:37:16.023 --> 01:37:16.964
It's Thursday, I think.

01:37:17.885 --> 01:37:18.926
Trail mix there.

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:22.489
Probably not the best thing to have up on my thing.

01:37:22.529 --> 01:37:24.871
I'm not really advertising good behavior there.

01:37:26.012 --> 01:37:27.694
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:28.174 --> 01:37:31.117
Again, please share stream.gigaom.bio.

01:37:31.157 --> 01:37:32.959
That's my own website that I pay for.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:39.704
and gigombiological.com if you're looking for a way to share everything from one point that might be the best way.

01:37:40.204 --> 01:37:43.907
And if you would like to support the work, join that scroll over there on the left.

01:37:44.967 --> 01:37:48.890
Please do so at the same site there at the top.

01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:56.276
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a certain place in America right now and that place is right here.

01:37:57.742 --> 01:38:05.085
And we need to understand why and how we got here, what these people are up to, and what the people that they are orchestrating are up to.

01:38:05.665 --> 01:38:11.988
And it is a very complicated web that's essentially best characterized, in my humble opinion, as a Trojan horse.

01:38:12.048 --> 01:38:14.749
They set up Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:23.352
to use him as kind of a big top tent of health, freedom, and the, what do they call that guy?

01:38:26.728 --> 01:38:29.110
The ringmaster is that what he's called the ringmaster.

01:38:29.331 --> 01:38:31.973
Is that what do you call the what do you call the guy?

01:38:32.033 --> 01:38:52.010
Yeah, I think the guy in the middle of the circus is called the ringmaster I believe that so, you know They wanted they they have him playing ringmaster in the same way that you know The guy at Chuck E. Cheese's plays the mouse like it's not a real position but it is a position that because the staff in the restaurant and the kids that come in for the birthday party and

01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:59.091
think that the mouse is the guy running the show, that they talk to the mouse and defer to the mouse and scream when the mouse says scream.

01:38:59.471 --> 01:39:00.872
And that's what his role is.

01:39:00.932 --> 01:39:04.432
And that's what even the role of probably Jay Bhattacharya is.

01:39:04.492 --> 01:39:07.033
And maybe even the role of Marty McCarty.

01:39:07.073 --> 01:39:17.275
They're just guys that have been over the last four years vetted on social media to make sure that they can read what they're told to read, or more importantly, stick to the talking points that they are given.

01:39:21.744 --> 01:39:25.349
And so I think one of the best examples of this is Kevin McCairn.

01:39:26.411 --> 01:39:31.378
Kevin McCairn is one of these guys who's been auditioning for five years and unfortunately isn't going to make the cut.

01:39:32.139 --> 01:39:36.265
And very early in the pandemic, his script was so well formed.

01:39:36.926 --> 01:39:44.410
especially with regard to who he had to oppose and who the bad guys were in the no virus movement or in the 5G movement.

01:39:44.931 --> 01:40:03.361
And his focus was on none other than Andrew Kaufman, a guy who had grants from New York state, you know, Governor Rudy and Governor Cuomo to, or Mayor Rudy and Governor Cuomo to make biometric devices to monitor prisons for suicide behavior.

01:40:05.908 --> 01:40:13.230
So the lack of progress in this charade is the way that you see the charade.

01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:35.178
If you realize that this guy was calling Mark Bailey's wife a whore for more than a year and making memes with hot dogs in her mouth, and then realize that in 2022, he just decided to stream with the guy who is racist and all kinds of other things, and also calling his wife a whore,

01:40:37.045 --> 01:40:38.188
And he just streamed with him.

01:40:38.529 --> 01:40:44.644
Because that's what you do, I guess, when you're part of a national security operation and don't know where the script is going to take you.

01:40:45.225 --> 01:40:46.569
Just know that you signed up.

01:40:49.059 --> 01:40:52.200
Just it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:59.742
So he said that with the presence of two people in the close orbit of George Webb, one of the worst actors on this.

01:40:59.802 --> 01:41:01.843
He was on social media for shit's sake.

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:03.623
He was on 60 Minutes.

01:41:04.363 --> 01:41:17.627
And not only that, but the deep state operative Robert Malone promoted the link of the CBS paid version of George Webb's, you know, military Wuhan games, 60 Minutes episode.

01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:23.892
And then later, of course, he's gonna do the same shtick four years later.

01:41:24.832 --> 01:41:30.755
The same exact shtick with somebody as fake as Charles Rixey.

01:41:33.077 --> 01:41:44.823
Somebody who is woefully not up to the task of whatever they imagined he could do with an Excel sheet and some help from a podcaster in Japan.

01:41:46.069 --> 01:41:49.810
This is one gigantic, magnificent joke on humanity.

01:41:49.850 --> 01:42:14.874
And if you don't start to see that Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler and the group Heart led by Claire Craig and Jonathan Engler is just a plant the same way that Children's Health Defense is, or that ICANN is, if you don't see that PANDA is nothing but a time-wasting organization and a bunch of obfuscators and liars that have done nothing, basically,

01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:24.493
except for Lou's three consecutive recordings that I made for them using my time for their organization under no pay.

01:42:25.273 --> 01:42:28.115
All those videos that got lost by all of these people.

01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:36.579
It's all part of the same malevolent show that is trying to turn social media into a world governance, uh,

01:42:37.372 --> 01:42:47.076
a world governance software suite, and trying to get everybody in the English speaking and, for that matter, technologically using world to acquiesce to it.

01:42:48.177 --> 01:42:51.839
Just because you don't use WhatsApp doesn't mean WhatsApp's not important.

01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:55.440
Just because you're not in a signal chat doesn't mean signal's not important.

01:42:55.460 --> 01:43:01.243
Just because you're not on X doesn't mean that X isn't having an influence on an awful lot of people in your government.

01:43:07.842 --> 01:43:08.302
Actually, J.J.

01:43:08.362 --> 01:43:14.824
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:43:15.004 --> 01:43:26.287
Just because you don't follow Brett Weinstein doesn't mean his following isn't significant, or more importantly, the cats that he herds and distracts and neutralizes aren't significant.

01:43:26.307 --> 01:43:33.129
Of course they are, just like the thousands of people that Naomi Wolf convinced to read Pfizer documents for two years.

01:43:33.829 --> 01:43:43.957
instead of just teaching American children that intramuscular injection has never been proven as a great methodological thing in medicine.

01:43:43.977 --> 01:43:44.678
It's just not.

01:43:45.539 --> 01:43:50.483
And calling intramuscular injections vaccines doesn't make them any more miraculous.

01:43:51.183 --> 01:43:56.908
But these people think so, or at least they walk that line.

01:43:57.488 --> 01:43:58.649
They do that schtick.

01:44:00.951 --> 01:44:01.191
Right.

01:44:04.491 --> 01:44:06.753
You have now a rough relation.

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:07.033
Oh, yeah.

01:44:07.133 --> 01:44:09.355
We're going to get out of here because I don't want to use that.

01:44:09.795 --> 01:44:11.136
That's still a leftover slide.

01:44:11.176 --> 01:44:12.817
I told you I wanted to do the music first.

01:44:12.837 --> 01:44:13.878
I'm going to go back up here.

01:44:15.079 --> 01:44:17.161
And these were all put in place together.

01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:19.262
So that means I can start with this slide, I believe.

01:44:19.522 --> 01:44:19.682
Yeah.

01:44:22.284 --> 01:44:25.907
So again, I told you we have got to do the homework required.

01:44:25.947 --> 01:44:29.230
And I think the homework required is to actually try and understand

01:44:30.808 --> 01:44:32.049
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:38.032
as an unwitting Trojan horse just in way over his head for his whole life.

01:44:38.112 --> 01:44:39.333
That's gotta be what this is.

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:43.515
He's being played by people that work for the national security state.

01:44:43.575 --> 01:44:44.796
That's the best case scenario.

01:44:44.836 --> 01:44:54.362
Worst case scenario, he's just going along with it, swinging on chains and doing pushups and testosterone replacement therapy until he's all used up and they don't need him anymore.

01:44:54.462 --> 01:44:58.284
He's no good to them until Marty Makary's stinking over. 2022.

01:45:02.268 --> 01:45:08.611
Jeffrey Sachs is the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University.

01:45:09.732 --> 01:45:14.314
He's the president of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

01:45:15.435 --> 01:45:24.719
He's the winner of the 2015 Blue Planet Prize, a bestselling author, and a chairman of the Lance's COVID-19 Commission.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.961
The commission was announced, as I recall, I think in June of 2020 by Richard.

01:45:31.437 --> 01:45:35.783
And then your joining the commission happened in November 2020.

01:45:36.965 --> 01:45:48.500
And you assembled a task force for the prestigious medical journal, 190 year old medical journal to determine the origins of COVID-19.

01:45:50.270 --> 01:46:01.472
I mean, you hand-selected, I think, a number of them, of the commissioners, but most notoriously, Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance.

01:46:02.513 --> 01:46:10.254
And to be chairman of the task force, Daszak was essentially forced to recuse himself in June of 2021.

01:46:10.414 --> 01:46:17.696
And then you shut down the commission altogether in September of 2021.

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:33.282
And then you did something incredibly courageous, which was to publish an article in PNAS, which has gotten a tremendous attention.

01:46:33.342 --> 01:46:37.083
I'm sure you're getting a lot of... See, it's May 2022 there.

01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:40.924
He's talking about an article in PNAS.

01:46:41.004 --> 01:46:42.364
Nobody calls it PNAS.

01:46:43.024 --> 01:46:46.925
Both negative and positive blowback from that.

01:46:48.325 --> 01:46:48.585
But

01:46:49.449 --> 01:47:07.063
essentially saying that your belief is that the best evidence is that the COVID-19 virus came from a Chinese lab, but that it was based upon US-funded technology.

01:47:08.183 --> 01:47:12.487
And I would have to agree with you on that, having done a lot of research on it myself.

01:47:13.604 --> 01:47:18.891
But let's talk about how you got involved in it in the first place.

01:47:19.853 --> 01:47:21.795
Were you approached by Richard Horton?

01:47:22.557 --> 01:47:24.839
Yeah, so Bobby, great to be with you.

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.702
Really fun and an important topic.

01:47:28.142 --> 01:47:36.009
Let me just fill out a few of the details and just correct a little bit of the detail on that.

01:47:36.069 --> 01:47:39.572
It's almost like Jeffrey's like, wow, you're not very good at this yet.

01:47:39.612 --> 01:47:40.853
Let me start over again.

01:47:40.893 --> 01:47:43.756
Thanks a lot for playing along, Bobby.

01:47:43.836 --> 01:47:45.097
I'll just take over from here.

01:47:47.179 --> 01:47:54.965
To put it clearly, I'm chairing a commission for the Lancet called the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.

01:47:55.465 --> 01:47:59.248
It's issuing its report in mid-September.

01:47:59.749 --> 01:48:01.150
So the commission continues.

01:48:01.970 --> 01:48:06.134
Within the commission, I established 11 task forces.

01:48:06.874 --> 01:48:10.037
So some were on how to respond to the pandemic.

01:48:11.478 --> 01:48:11.618
It's 2022.

01:48:11.658 --> 01:48:12.098
Here, I'll do this.

01:48:20.555 --> 01:48:20.995
Oh, no.

01:48:21.095 --> 01:48:28.421
Why did it start over?

01:48:29.101 --> 01:48:32.764
Now, as I recall, I think in June of 2020, I read you.

01:48:32.804 --> 01:48:33.345
That's right.

01:48:34.606 --> 01:48:38.949
And then you're joining the commission happened in November 2020.

01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:46.234
And you assembled a task force for the prestigious medical journal, 190 year old

01:48:48.424 --> 01:48:52.325
medical journal to determine the origins of COVID-19.

01:48:53.846 --> 01:49:04.649
You hand-selected, I think, a number of them, of the commissioners, but most notoriously, Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance.

01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:13.432
And to be chairman of the task force, Daszak was essentially forced to recuse himself in June of 2021.

01:49:14.192 --> 01:49:15.632
And then you shut down the

01:49:18.466 --> 01:49:20.868
a commission altogether in September of 2021.

01:49:21.928 --> 01:49:36.437
And then you did something incredibly courageous, which was to publish an article in PNAS, which has gotten a tremendous attention.

01:49:36.517 --> 01:49:42.300
I'm sure you're getting a lot of both negative and positive blowback from that.

01:49:43.753 --> 01:50:02.478
But essentially saying that your belief is that the best evidence is that the COVID-19 virus came from a Chinese lab, but that it was based upon US-funded technology.

01:50:03.598 --> 01:50:07.899
And I would have to agree with you on that, having done a lot of research on it myself.

01:50:09.031 --> 01:50:14.316
But let's talk about how you got involved in it in the first place.

01:50:15.277 --> 01:50:17.219
Were you approached by Richard Horton?

01:50:17.984 --> 01:50:20.286
Yeah, so Bobby, great to be with you.

01:50:21.006 --> 01:50:23.127
Really fun and an important topic.

01:50:23.568 --> 01:50:31.453
Let me just fill out a few of the details and just correct a little bit of the detail on that.

01:50:31.573 --> 01:50:41.099
Because to put it clearly, I'm chairing a commission for the Lancet called the Lancet COVID-19 Commission.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.382
It's issuing its report in mid-September.

01:50:45.883 --> 01:50:47.244
So the commission continues.

01:50:48.104 --> 01:50:52.266
Within the commission, I established 11 task forces.

01:50:52.986 --> 01:50:56.287
So some were on how to respond to the pandemic.

01:50:56.347 --> 01:51:00.068
Some were on the financial crisis that emerged around the pandemic.

01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:05.450
Some were on other issues about public health.

01:51:05.971 --> 01:51:11.133
But one of them, one of the task forces, was about the origins.

01:51:11.653 --> 01:51:14.394
And that's the task force where I asked

01:51:15.131 --> 01:51:16.972
Peter Daszak to chair.

01:51:17.072 --> 01:51:27.498
So there were many task forces and most of them fully reinforced the existence of pandemics as a phenomenon and as a future challenge.

01:51:29.699 --> 01:51:36.182
And one was investigating the source of the pandemic and Peter Daszak was involved, but probably shouldn't have been.

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:39.504
And essentially to organize the task force.

01:51:39.544 --> 01:51:42.025
So for each of these 11 task forces,

01:51:43.360 --> 01:52:03.928
I designated a public health expert or diplomatic or financial expert and then gave them or requested of them, since this was all on volunteer time on everybody's part, to organize a group of international experts to work on this.

01:52:05.041 --> 01:52:16.189
I was chair right from the beginning of the process, which was the middle of 2020, just as the pandemic was reaching the first half year.

01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:24.656
And it was around that time, Richard Horton and I talked and thought that a commission would be a good idea.

01:52:24.896 --> 01:52:33.102
But by the way, not only to review all that happened, we didn't know how long this would last, but also to make some recommendations along the way.

01:52:33.722 --> 01:52:44.088
of how to try to keep this under control, how to make sure that there was health equity for desperately poor people who needed access to medicines or hospitals.

01:52:44.148 --> 01:52:46.249
Just make sure you do the math in your head right.

01:52:46.269 --> 01:52:47.230
22 means 23, 24, 25.

01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:49.011
This is three full years ago.

01:52:49.051 --> 01:52:50.011
This is the summer of 2022.

01:52:50.212 --> 01:52:51.712
Three full years ago.

01:52:51.732 --> 01:52:53.934
Bobby hasn't even declared his candidacy yet.

01:53:06.206 --> 01:53:09.490
hospitals or protection or face masks or whatever it is.

01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:13.013
Richard Horton asked me to have this and to organize it.

01:53:13.354 --> 01:53:25.147
The commission itself is 40 public policy leaders from around the world, former president of the UN General Assembly, former president

01:53:26.608 --> 01:53:32.692
uh, in a European country, uh, several scientists, uh, many financial experts and so on.

01:53:32.992 --> 01:53:53.205
But if for me... What chance does Bobby Kennedy have if Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone, Jeffrey Sachs, you know, Gavin DeBecker, all these people that are close to him are essentially connected to this shit.

01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:54.826
What chance does he have?

01:53:56.584 --> 01:54:00.105
And if he figured it out, what chance would he have to do anything about it?

01:54:04.626 --> 01:54:06.587
It's a Trojan horse, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:06.627 --> 01:54:12.389
They used a guy who probably really wanted to do something right for America for a really long time, for maybe his whole life.

01:54:13.289 --> 01:54:15.070
They used him and spit him out already.

01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:17.610
And you can see it if you open your eyes.

01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:19.831
And for us in our discussion today,

01:54:20.622 --> 01:54:24.224
One part of this assignment was, so where did this come from?

01:54:25.025 --> 01:54:34.851
And I can tell you at the beginning of my engagement in this issue, well, even from the beginning of the pandemic itself,

01:54:35.851 --> 01:54:43.135
assumed this came out of nature the same way that SARS apparently came out of nature in 2003, 2004.

01:54:45.477 --> 01:54:52.541
In the case of SARS, best guess is that it really was an animal sold in a wet market in China.

01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:54.961
that was carrying that virus.

01:54:56.062 --> 01:55:02.363
MERS, which is another coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, was carried by camel.

01:55:02.963 --> 01:55:08.484
I assumed, okay, this is yet another one of these so-called zoonoses.

01:55:09.244 --> 01:55:15.726
And I thought, who knows a lot about that but the guy who's looking at these viruses in the wild, Peter Daszak.

01:55:15.806 --> 01:55:16.746
So, I,

01:55:17.726 --> 01:55:25.775
I asked him, well, you're around this, you know what's going on in China, why don't you establish the task force?

01:55:26.276 --> 01:55:34.985
It's interesting for me, I was not in any way on the lab leak side of things at the beginning.

01:55:35.546 --> 01:55:36.447
In fact, I thought

01:55:36.847 --> 01:55:40.749
This is the perfect Scooby-Doo act right here.

01:55:40.989 --> 01:55:41.789
The perfect.

01:55:42.209 --> 01:55:48.912
I didn't suspect this at all until I started running this commission and they all started lying to me.

01:55:49.372 --> 01:55:50.993
They were lying to me.

01:55:51.353 --> 01:55:55.955
And since they were lying to me, it must be a lab leak.

01:55:55.975 --> 01:55:57.596
Oh, that doesn't sound right.

01:55:58.196 --> 01:56:02.158
And I remember explaining in a very learned way to a good friend of mine.

01:56:02.198 --> 01:56:03.418
No, no, no, that's not right.

01:56:03.459 --> 01:56:04.459
This is a natural.

01:56:05.099 --> 01:56:06.601
sometime in the spring of 2020.

01:56:08.423 --> 01:56:21.095
So what we're talking about, Bobby, is my education also, because the most important thing to understand here is that nobody who knows their biology was ever doubting a lab leak possibility.

01:56:21.176 --> 01:56:21.516
Nobody.

01:56:22.177 --> 01:56:27.542
If you were an expert in the Bad Biology 101, then you already knew that a lab leak was likely.

01:56:27.582 --> 01:56:28.303
You already read

01:56:29.223 --> 01:56:32.806
the articles about all the lab leaks that are happening that nobody reports.

01:56:32.846 --> 01:56:37.690
You already read about the water contamination at US Amarid.

01:56:38.170 --> 01:56:41.652
This is again a message only for the people who needed to hear it.

01:56:41.733 --> 01:56:46.016
And more importantly, only those people can really hear what this message is.

01:56:47.696 --> 01:57:12.062
I got to watch this story very close up by some of the principles involved in making the case that it's from nature, from the swan, which is the one that is featured in, say, the New York Times stories in the last few months about the scientists finding the origins and so forth.

01:57:12.502 --> 01:57:15.103
And I can tell you that over

01:57:15.923 --> 01:57:21.425
the period of two years, I was lied to so many times.

01:57:22.406 --> 01:57:25.647
Daschig told me so many things that were not true.

01:57:26.468 --> 01:57:29.989
It was the opposite of transparent.

01:57:31.190 --> 01:57:36.372
I had to tell him, well, you can't head this task force and

01:57:37.586 --> 01:57:41.290
even later, soon after that, you can't even be on the commission.

01:57:41.651 --> 01:57:46.356
So I didn't disband the commission, but I did take him off of the task force.

01:57:47.077 --> 01:57:58.449
And then, and it keeps coming, by the way, the task force members were dishonest to me after I was completely clear with them.

01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:02.952
I want to know what your potential conflicts of interest are.

01:58:03.633 --> 01:58:06.615
Are you involved with EcoHealth Alliance with Dasik?

01:58:07.295 --> 01:58:09.997
Are you involved with Wuhan Institute of Virology?

01:58:10.077 --> 01:58:17.601
Are you involved with NIH in a way that we should understand that there may be a potential conflict for you?

01:58:18.121 --> 01:58:20.823
And Bobby, none of them told the truth.

01:58:21.183 --> 01:58:25.206
Maybe that's not shocking, but it was surprising to me because

01:58:26.257 --> 01:58:33.845
These are, some of them, people that I've known, I would say personal friends in some cases, for 20 years.

01:58:34.486 --> 01:58:40.792
They absolutely did not tell the truth when I asked them clearly, explicitly.

01:58:41.193 --> 01:58:45.537
So that was one part of the story, my growing, ugh.

01:58:46.533 --> 01:58:53.736
dismay, consternation, that something is really, really wrong about this.

01:58:54.297 --> 01:59:10.805
And then on the other side, as those who follow this story, and you are certainly among the lead in that, the Freedom of Information Act and leaks, one by one,

01:59:11.877 --> 01:59:22.838
were demolishing the premises of the natural spillover story, but also revealing the

01:59:23.621 --> 01:59:31.426
utter transparency and misdirection that the US government was leading basically from the start.

01:59:31.926 --> 01:59:34.148
So we were not hearing the truth.

01:59:34.948 --> 01:59:37.350
Again, why am I surprised?

01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:42.993
But it's dismaying to see it come out step by step in this way.

01:59:43.714 --> 01:59:52.740
And what is absolutely clear to me is that there are

01:59:53.939 --> 02:00:04.925
two viable hypotheses about the origin of this and one of them is out of a lab and there's nothing outlandish about it at all.

02:00:05.846 --> 02:00:11.089
And in fact, like you said, I think it's the odds on explanation.

02:00:11.897 --> 02:00:15.139
I don't speak for the whole commission in that regard.

02:00:15.219 --> 02:00:31.366
What the commission sees is that there are two viable explanations, but I can tell you two years into this, with all the deceit, deception, lying that I've seen, the scientists on the Guanan market side vastly overstayed.

02:00:31.486 --> 02:00:32.507
I was wrong about that.

02:00:32.587 --> 02:00:35.128
So Ancient Relic just brought up something that I got wrong.

02:00:35.208 --> 02:00:40.111
So Housatonic probably said it because I said it, but it was actually Roger Ailes

02:00:40.891 --> 02:00:47.294
who Bobby Kennedy spent a couple months or a month in a tent in Africa with, Roger Ailes.

02:00:47.394 --> 02:00:49.615
I think that's the Fox News dude.

02:00:49.935 --> 02:00:51.916
So not Jeffrey Sachs, Roger Ailes.

02:00:51.996 --> 02:00:54.857
It was my bad, not Mark's, my bad.

02:00:55.718 --> 02:01:04.502
Or misdirecting the gays and the absolute absurd,

02:01:05.928 --> 02:01:17.616
sad, worrisome, frightening unwillingness of the US government, starting with NIH, to look closely at the lab hypothesis.

02:01:19.057 --> 02:01:20.638
It's really very telling.

02:01:20.858 --> 02:01:23.900
So that's just to set the scene.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.983
I started on the other side, but I watched very closely.

02:01:28.283 --> 02:01:33.887
And like all of us, I've been an avid reader of the drip, drip, drip,

02:01:34.571 --> 02:01:38.574
of information that has been pried out of the hands of NIH.

02:01:38.754 --> 02:01:44.119
Pried out of the hands of NIH, like the emails were pried out of their hands.

02:01:44.659 --> 02:01:46.421
We got those FOIAs, man.

02:01:46.481 --> 02:01:47.502
We got the FOIAs.

02:01:47.522 --> 02:01:53.827
We got the goods on these people despite their best effort to stop us from finding the truth.

02:01:54.507 --> 02:02:00.992
Because this Scooby-Doo mystery is going to be solved, and Jeffrey Sachs is going to get to the bottom of it one way or another.

02:02:01.813 --> 02:02:03.675
Peter Daszak's not going to stop me.

02:02:04.721 --> 02:02:10.505
because they're not talking, they're not forthcoming, they're not being honest, Fauci's not telling it like it is.

02:02:11.746 --> 02:02:15.008
By drip, the story's coming out, and it's a very worrisome one.

02:02:16.394 --> 02:02:31.424
You know, my approach to this was different than yours, because I approach with this enormous skepticism that I've cultivated, that basically has grown unwillingly in me since 2005.

02:02:31.824 --> 02:02:39.849
So watching Fauci very carefully, and watching the journals, and how they've devolved.

02:02:39.889 --> 02:02:45.033
And in fact, in 2004, Richard Horton made the statement that

02:02:45.919 --> 02:02:55.846
the scientific journals, particularly the Lancet, had devolved into propaganda vessels for the pharmaceutical industry.

02:02:56.707 --> 02:03:08.175
And Marcia Engel, at the same time, published her book, who was a long-time publisher of the New England Journal of Medicine, basically saying there's nothing in the journals that you can believe anymore.

02:03:09.396 --> 02:03:12.178
So much of our revenue comes from

02:03:13.534 --> 02:03:14.235
from Pharma.

02:03:14.535 --> 02:03:20.840
And now the Lancet is owned by Elsevier, which is a very, very wealthy company.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.223
Basically, Pharma is its partner and China.

02:03:26.324 --> 02:03:35.070
And throughout the pandemic, we watched Horton do all of these kind of underhanded things where he had to retract articles

02:03:37.853 --> 02:03:48.397
They published the article on Remdesivir that allowed them, even the World Health Organization was saying, this stuff is poison, it doesn't work, it has no efficacy.

02:03:48.477 --> 02:03:56.361
And he published the article for Fauci that allowed Fauci to then go get approval for this very, very deadly drug.

02:03:57.409 --> 02:04:03.131
He had to do the retraction on the surgosphere studies.

02:04:04.292 --> 02:04:09.234
He tried to discredit hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and any kind of early treatment.

02:04:09.934 --> 02:04:16.597
I so admire your integrity on this issue and your willingness to publicly change your mind.

02:04:17.037 --> 02:04:19.739
which is, you know, so admirable.

02:04:19.999 --> 02:04:34.866
My father's, one of his favorite quotes was from Aeschylus, which was, you know, the only, it's not a crime to make a mistake, essentially, the only crime is not admitting that you did it.

02:04:35.487 --> 02:04:37.668
You know, the great sin is pride.

02:04:38.648 --> 02:04:42.430
And that gets us in so much trouble when people are unwilling to change their minds.

02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:44.832
So I know that most people

02:04:45.868 --> 02:04:52.573
who come from your and my background assume that the government was and the pharmaceutical industry were kind of doing their best.

02:04:53.634 --> 02:05:01.020
And it was hard to believe that, you know, and I, I've watched people, I had to come to my own set of revelations.

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.843
And, you know, over time, I know you had to come to yours.

02:05:06.044 --> 02:05:06.905
Dave, what

02:05:07.702 --> 02:05:08.463
What do you think?

02:05:08.743 --> 02:05:14.531
I mean, how many people were on the commission, the Wuhan commission?

02:05:14.571 --> 02:05:16.694
It's actually the origins commission.

02:05:17.914 --> 02:05:18.735
of the task force.

02:05:20.556 --> 02:05:25.259
Not the commission, task force, just to use the verbiage.

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:28.142
I think it was 10 to 15.

02:05:29.102 --> 02:05:43.773
All of them, by the way, basically handpicked by Daschig because- And a lot of those guys were the same virologists and immunologists and biologists who had signed on to- He can be real.

02:05:45.253 --> 02:05:47.474
He can just be trying to follow this stuff.

02:05:47.514 --> 02:05:48.734
He's not a biologist.

02:05:51.175 --> 02:06:00.919
I don't think he's obligated to understand that virology is an illusion created by transfection and transformation using synthetic constructs until after I told him.

02:06:00.959 --> 02:06:01.759
And it was after this.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.161
After this is when I told him.

02:06:06.481 --> 02:06:14.044
Now imagine after I told him that he actually comes to that realization that all these people have been lying to me because if Jonathan Cooey's right,

02:06:14.605 --> 02:06:15.766
then I'm being played.

02:06:19.949 --> 02:06:25.052
I mean, just think about this for a second, ladies and gentlemen, because we don't see him on the Sunday programs.

02:06:25.072 --> 02:06:26.453
We don't see him on the nightly news.

02:06:26.493 --> 02:06:27.614
We see Marty Makary.

02:06:28.915 --> 02:06:34.339
The Lancet letter, which it turns out ASAC had secretly orchestrated.

02:06:34.379 --> 02:06:38.562
Yeah, so let me just give you the background on that.

02:06:40.467 --> 02:06:58.582
I asked each of the task force chairs to organize their task forces under a broad rubric, which was international diversity, gender diversity, professional background diversity, and so on.

02:07:00.489 --> 02:07:05.070
by and large out of 11 task forces attended.

02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:10.911
So, and Dashik surrounded himself by his colleagues basically.

02:07:11.611 --> 02:07:19.773
So, and- It's a really long story to explain why there's a lab leak coverup and it's partly DASAC's fault.

02:07:19.793 --> 02:07:21.153
Maybe even DASAC did it.

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:22.613
Well, we're gonna find the defuse.

02:07:23.193 --> 02:07:26.134
Oh, goodness sakes, look what's coming, the defuse proposal.

02:07:31.129 --> 02:07:44.476
As I explained to you, you know, as time went on, and people immediately attacked me and I said, by the way, and I meant it from the first moment.

02:07:44.496 --> 02:07:46.598
I only want to know what happened.

02:07:46.678 --> 02:07:47.858
I only want to know the truth.

02:07:47.898 --> 02:07:48.779
There's no setup.

02:07:49.179 --> 02:07:51.160
No one forced me to pick Dashing, by the way.

02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:53.381
It wasn't Richard Horton or Lanson, nobody.

02:07:53.682 --> 02:07:55.082
This was my blunder.

02:07:55.863 --> 02:08:03.227
So I stepped into it right at the beginning, thinking, well, here's the guy that, you know, that knows most of what's going on.

02:08:03.387 --> 02:08:05.068
So I stepped into it.

02:08:05.428 --> 02:08:08.270
He organized around it.

02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:12.392
People criticized me in the fall of 2020.

02:08:13.353 --> 02:08:14.393
You know, this is a setup.

02:08:14.413 --> 02:08:17.075
He's very good at casually glancing down to his notes.

02:08:17.603 --> 02:08:18.784
up job and so forth.

02:08:18.844 --> 02:08:21.985
And I said, no, I, you know, I'm a serious person.

02:08:22.005 --> 02:08:32.870
I'm absolutely have no plan, desire, incentive in any way to steer this other than towards the truth.

02:08:33.451 --> 02:08:34.871
And I promised to do that.

02:08:34.971 --> 02:08:39.613
And the congressman, Republican congressman wrote to me saying Daszak has to go.

02:08:39.713 --> 02:08:40.574
And I said, no, no, no,

02:08:41.034 --> 02:08:43.676
But believe me, he's not going to write the final report.

02:08:43.716 --> 02:08:44.837
This is for the commission.

02:08:44.897 --> 02:08:45.857
He has a task.

02:08:45.918 --> 02:08:46.658
Yes, yes.

02:08:46.798 --> 02:08:48.459
Richard Horton is who he's talking about.

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:54.724
The commission will judge and I'm the chair of the commission and you can count on me to make sure that we look at everything.

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:59.563
And of course, from the first moment, that was my intention.

02:09:00.124 --> 02:09:10.913
And then people started to explain some basic facts to me about what was going on, what the research underway in the US and in Wuhan.

02:09:10.973 --> 02:09:12.535
What's going on with my videos?

02:09:12.675 --> 02:09:16.979
The research that was so dangerous, so potentially the source of all of this.

02:09:16.999 --> 02:09:18.440
I'm trying to interrupt my stream again.

02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:36.498
And so at one point early in 2021, I said to Dash, what the research underway in the US and in Wuhan were the research that was so dangerous, so potentially the source of all of this.

02:09:37.199 --> 02:09:50.262
And so at one point early in 2021, I said to Dashik, look, I need to see your research proposals to NIH because I'm hearing a lot of things.

02:09:50.823 --> 02:09:54.423
And Dashik said to me, no, no, I can't give those to you.

02:09:54.483 --> 02:09:56.404
My lawyers say I can't give those to you.

02:09:57.227 --> 02:10:11.320
So what do you mean, we're trying to parent commission, and I need to see them no no no I can't give them to I said well, Peter then you, you can't be chair of this task force you, you have to stop that.

02:10:13.041 --> 02:10:18.064
Then it became more clear in the days ahead.

02:10:18.084 --> 02:10:27.010
He was lying to me about a lot of things about what was and what wasn't going on in terms of dangerous research in Wuhan.

02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:29.511
And I said, okay, you can't be on the commission either.

02:10:29.591 --> 02:10:32.393
So I pushed him off.

02:10:32.453 --> 02:10:33.433
I said, you've got to leave.

02:10:33.453 --> 02:10:35.555
This absolutely is impossible.

02:10:35.635 --> 02:10:39.097
I'm running a transparent, open, honest commission.

02:10:40.262 --> 02:10:43.527
Then what was interesting, Bobby, is that, of course, the other

02:10:45.133 --> 02:10:47.794
10 to 15 members went after me.

02:10:48.535 --> 02:11:00.403
What's the matter with you, Sachs, you anti-science, reckless, buying into the right wing conspiracy theory and everything you could imagine.

02:11:01.263 --> 02:11:10.850
And one of them was a friend of mine for, as I said, for probably about 25 years, who ripped into me personally

02:11:11.676 --> 02:11:18.380
Like I don't usually experience, but saying how... He was who he was.

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.062
It's because of the personal thing.

02:11:22.122 --> 02:11:25.564
Let me just mention the bottom line, though, which was hilarious.

02:11:26.564 --> 02:11:27.165
I can't do it.

02:11:27.965 --> 02:11:29.786
I can't do it anymore, ladies and gentlemen.

02:11:29.986 --> 02:11:30.487
It's enough.

02:11:30.667 --> 02:11:31.907
You know what I'm talking about.

02:11:31.968 --> 02:11:33.568
You know what I'm trying to show you with this.

02:11:34.449 --> 02:11:35.590
You know what I want you to see.

02:11:36.210 --> 02:11:39.192
It is a scripted group of people

02:11:40.094 --> 02:11:43.837
The script that they are on precludes any real biology.

02:11:44.077 --> 02:11:51.762
They're never going to allow our children to escape if we don't throw off social media as a means of communication.

02:11:52.594 --> 02:11:54.354
Ladies and gentlemen, RNA cannot pandemic.

02:11:54.395 --> 02:11:57.235
Intramuscular injection is not a form of medicine.

02:11:57.875 --> 02:12:01.536
Transfecting healthy people is also not a form of medicine.

02:12:01.596 --> 02:12:03.377
And the population pyramids are real.

02:12:03.917 --> 02:12:13.920
And if there's any kind of geophysical socioeconomic disaster coming, it is the slow motion train wreck that is the Western civilization's population pyramid.

02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:16.940
There's not going to be as many bees in the hive anymore.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.122
And so they need to mitigate the collapse slowly, you know, like slowly.

02:12:23.222 --> 02:12:24.842
It's a long time scale.

02:12:25.442 --> 02:12:34.184
And so they're using it as an excuse to put us in a digital prison and use us as experimental animals, because that was always the plan, ladies and gentlemen.

02:12:34.204 --> 02:12:35.804
That's been the plan for a long time.

02:12:36.324 --> 02:12:40.365
Just trying to figure out the plausible story that would get everybody to accept it.

02:12:41.245 --> 02:12:49.788
The one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and we can eventually disease.

02:12:53.389 --> 02:12:54.690
He will not call autism.

02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:57.231
I don't like the word autism.

02:12:57.331 --> 02:12:58.471
He was vaccine damaged.

02:12:58.751 --> 02:13:00.112
He was neurologically damaged.

02:13:05.188 --> 02:13:05.929
Happy Thursday.

02:13:05.989 --> 02:13:07.570
Tomorrow's Friday, I think, right?

02:13:07.650 --> 02:13:08.771
Let me check that quick.

02:13:09.191 --> 02:13:11.033
Yeah, is it tomorrow, Friday?

02:13:11.073 --> 02:13:11.633
What's going on?

02:13:11.653 --> 02:13:13.515
Why won't you tell me what the date is?

02:13:14.296 --> 02:13:14.996
I'm hovering.

02:13:15.016 --> 02:13:16.257
There we go.

02:13:16.617 --> 02:13:17.658
Yes, tomorrow's Friday.

02:13:17.678 --> 02:13:19.760
Thank you very much for joining me, everybody.

02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:21.121
Good to see everybody in the chat.

02:13:21.141 --> 02:13:21.962
Thanks for being here.

02:13:22.782 --> 02:13:25.144
And I will see you again tomorrow.
