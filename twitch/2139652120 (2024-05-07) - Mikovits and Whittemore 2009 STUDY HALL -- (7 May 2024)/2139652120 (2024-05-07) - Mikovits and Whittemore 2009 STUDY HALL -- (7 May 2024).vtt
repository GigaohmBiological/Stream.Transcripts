00:30.000 --> 01:00.000
You are the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one

01:00.000 --> 01:30.000
and the one and the

01:30.000 --> 02:00.000
one and the one and the one and the one and the one and and and the one and and the one and the one and the one and the one and the one and the of the one and the one and the one and the one and the one the one and the one and the one and the one and the other one and and and and and the other one the other and and the other one and and the first and

02:00.000 --> 02:04.480
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case of

02:11.760 --> 02:17.840
Special chef special shout out to usatonic live. I'm gonna use his video today in this show

02:18.720 --> 02:24.400
Um, I don't know how that's gonna work out for youtube, but it should be okay because I'm gonna play it with a second computer

02:25.120 --> 02:26.000
um

02:26.000 --> 02:32.160
Mark was able to upload a 30-minute video from 2008, which I just think is gonna be a lot of fun

02:32.800 --> 02:34.560
um

02:34.560 --> 02:36.560
And uh, so yeah

02:36.960 --> 02:41.040
Just consumed yesterday's stuff and no live. What does that mean?

02:43.760 --> 02:47.040
Not sure what that means, but wash can you clarify that a little bit for me

02:48.960 --> 02:55.840
And no live. What does that mean yesterday's was live at 10 o'clock as usual. Um, I'm late again today, but I am here

02:56.800 --> 02:58.800
I

03:02.240 --> 03:06.880
Think truth is good for kids. We're so busy lying. We don't even recognize the truth

03:07.280 --> 03:11.200
Now live I get it. Well great. I hope it's not overdosing for you

03:12.400 --> 03:14.480
Take everything with a grain and salt including me

03:15.040 --> 03:19.040
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people

03:20.640 --> 03:23.520
And then I have lied. I'm sure I'll lie again. I don't want to lie

03:24.000 --> 03:27.440
You know, I'm I don't think I'm a liar. I try not to be a liar. I don't want to be a liar

03:27.920 --> 03:30.800
I think it's like really important not to be a liar

03:30.800 --> 03:32.800
I

03:46.640 --> 03:53.920
I'm not sure exactly who he is his name is jay jay cooey and I believe he's a consultant for chd

03:54.720 --> 03:57.040
and I believe he has a phd and

03:57.040 --> 04:01.680
Some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand

04:27.360 --> 04:30.480
See what happens when you do it live. It's such a monkey

04:32.800 --> 04:38.720
Forget about Fred Rogers. How can I forget about my buddy friend Rogers? He's like the spirit of this whole show

04:38.800 --> 04:42.320
What the heck is going on? How can I hit the button too early?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.920
I

05:01.440 --> 05:07.760
Good morning, everyone. This is giggle and biological. Thank you for joining me from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

05:07.920 --> 05:11.040
Another broadcast trying to dispel the enchantment

05:13.120 --> 05:15.600
And uh knowledge is the only way to do that

05:16.080 --> 05:22.480
And so that's why we're trying to learn immunology and biology and virology and molecular biology

05:23.440 --> 05:25.840
All these hologies that people have been

05:27.440 --> 05:32.240
Been trying to voice on us that I don't think have been hoisted on us in a very truthful way

05:32.960 --> 05:38.240
Because our consciousness is the prime real estate. They're actually interested in controlling

05:38.880 --> 05:41.440
I think my voice is a little low there. I'm gonna raise it up

05:44.400 --> 05:49.920
And so we're not here to attribute bad motives to people we're just disagreeing with them because they're bad ideas

05:50.240 --> 05:51.680
Um

05:51.680 --> 05:57.600
And uh that includes the bad idea of fractional reserve banking and how it has been used to

05:58.320 --> 06:00.320
manipulate and control us for

06:00.720 --> 06:02.160
generations

06:02.160 --> 06:08.320
And it is the collapse of this illusion of fractional reserve banking that I think is well coinciding with the

06:09.040 --> 06:15.520
the execution of this pandemic narrative on our children the release the forceful

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
story

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Storytelling

06:25.040 --> 06:28.400
It's this forceful storytelling that we are trying to disrupt

06:28.480 --> 06:34.800
It's also a forceful storytelling about what AI can do and what will be accomplished if we just give up our data to AI

06:34.880 --> 06:39.360
If we just let these smart people with machines have all that they want

06:40.160 --> 06:43.360
Humanities problems will be solved. This is also a story

06:46.320 --> 06:49.760
This is also a story that we need to clarify with our children

06:50.800 --> 06:56.640
That we need them to understand is a story a mythology that's designed to make them go limp

06:57.760 --> 07:03.040
And uh sovereignty doesn't work that way responsibility doesn't work that way adulthood

07:03.520 --> 07:05.760
Doesn't work that way you need to learn history

07:10.000 --> 07:15.280
You need to learn history before it's erased forever and you need to learn the biology that they have

07:15.840 --> 07:17.200
Distorted

07:17.200 --> 07:19.680
Throughout our history in order to enslave us

07:20.880 --> 07:24.720
You see that's what a charlatan does they take and distort truth

07:25.760 --> 07:30.800
To the point where it is no longer useful to you and then they use that mythology against you

07:32.400 --> 07:37.440
And we have handed over power to charlatans long ago. It's actually not us. It was our parents

07:38.720 --> 07:43.920
Maybe even their parents that handed over power to these charlatans, but it has been the

07:44.400 --> 07:51.200
Handing it down through the generations. That is what we need to break and that is what gig ome biological wants to break is this

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
generational

07:54.720 --> 07:59.680
Mythological inheritance because we have inherited a mythology from our parents

08:00.080 --> 08:03.680
Who an inherited it from theirs and this mythology needs to be broken

08:04.320 --> 08:08.800
As we break it, we need to be very careful to make gentle the light of life of this world

08:09.440 --> 08:11.120
rather than allow

08:11.120 --> 08:12.000
the

08:12.000 --> 08:14.640
Global chaos that I'm almost certain

08:15.200 --> 08:20.800
These controllers need to happen. They can't reorganize and make a new order

08:21.440 --> 08:24.240
without first starting from chaos and so

08:25.200 --> 08:27.520
We have to realize what's happening here

08:28.720 --> 08:33.680
And we have to be humble enough to accept that there are very few things that we ourselves can control

08:33.680 --> 08:38.320
We're on a very very very powerful wave a wave of humanity

08:39.120 --> 08:42.240
a wave across time and a wave of cross generations

08:43.040 --> 08:47.440
And so in order for us to teach our children to surf this wave

08:47.440 --> 08:52.000
We first have to be able to let them see it. We have to let them see it for what it is

08:52.960 --> 08:56.480
And then actually it's quite simple to teach people how

08:57.200 --> 08:59.200
to see the wave and avoid

08:59.200 --> 09:01.200
the wave throwing them into the

09:01.680 --> 09:03.680
into the coral reef

09:04.000 --> 09:05.280
and

09:05.280 --> 09:07.280
perhaps killing

09:08.240 --> 09:09.040
Um

09:09.040 --> 09:13.520
And that's what this is all about ladies and gentlemen. It is about staying focused on the biology

09:13.520 --> 09:15.680
It's not taking the bait on social media

09:16.320 --> 09:18.800
And loving our neighbors so that we can collectively

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Pull our heads out

09:23.760 --> 09:31.440
And the way that this stream works is that people share on twitter and on facebook and makes clips like suit spider does and like jeff

09:32.000 --> 09:36.880
From from earth does and then shares them on instagram and other places that i'm not

09:37.520 --> 09:42.640
Um, you can share rumble you can share twitch you can share youtube now and you can share

09:43.200 --> 09:44.480
uh, the

09:44.480 --> 09:49.280
Pier tube which is now working better because my friend Ted and I have added some memory

09:49.360 --> 09:51.360
And I think that's going to help out a lot

09:51.600 --> 09:54.000
Uh getting the transcoding to work. I think sometimes

09:54.640 --> 09:58.560
When I was going too long then the transcoding did not have enough memory

09:59.200 --> 10:01.040
And so that it would fail

10:01.040 --> 10:05.200
And then we may have solved that problem now and so that might be just another step of

10:05.920 --> 10:07.680
of a bit more

10:07.680 --> 10:09.520
resilience in this message

10:10.800 --> 10:13.840
And resilience is going to be needed because the message isn't going to be

10:15.360 --> 10:19.600
Is not going to be preserved without um us actively doing it

10:20.720 --> 10:25.680
The paradigm shift is about to occur ladies and gentlemen. It is a very serious paradigm shift

10:26.320 --> 10:28.560
And um, the people that don't shift

10:29.200 --> 10:35.760
Um are going to be angry about it and the people that do shift are going to be angry about it and and so we've got to

10:36.480 --> 10:40.800
Pull people's heads out. We've got to make them drop their hands from their eyes

10:40.880 --> 10:43.280
We've got to get them off social media as much as we can

10:43.840 --> 10:49.360
Before this happens so that the illusion is not sustained through their unwitting active participation

10:50.640 --> 10:55.360
And so I think one of the best ways to do that is to learn the biology and that's what what gig oem

10:55.360 --> 11:00.400
Is all about we've learned the biology so that we can engage in united non-compliance

11:01.200 --> 11:03.200
And yes, I am a human just like you

11:04.000 --> 11:07.040
um, and uh, I am team human

11:07.840 --> 11:09.840
not team humanity or whatever

11:10.240 --> 11:11.280
um

11:11.280 --> 11:18.960
Alex jones is now trying to hijack we've been calling it team human since 2020 and before so

11:19.600 --> 11:23.200
Um, Alex jones hijacking that now is just absolutely

11:23.200 --> 11:25.840
Hilarious welcome to gig oem ladies and gentlemen

11:53.440 --> 12:00.160
Hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show. This is gig oem biological a high-resistance low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

12:00.240 --> 12:02.240
It is may 7th

12:02.240 --> 12:03.680
2024

12:03.680 --> 12:11.040
um, and uh in in the spirit of the current subject of the study hall today, I thought I'd also wear a

12:12.000 --> 12:13.120
throwback shirt

12:13.120 --> 12:19.760
I don't know if anybody can remember the time when everybody was angry at erin rogers because he didn't take the shot

12:20.400 --> 12:26.320
Um and made a big deal about him saying that he might have previous immunity or some other nonsense like that

12:26.880 --> 12:27.840
um

12:27.840 --> 12:34.800
And uh, so in throwing this shirt back on I thought I would also remind you that that had happened and how many years ago that was and

12:35.280 --> 12:40.320
I I often think it's very important to remind people it's 2020 was a whole year

12:41.360 --> 12:43.440
2021 was a

12:43.440 --> 12:46.560
Was a whole year 2022 was a whole year

12:47.120 --> 12:53.600
And 2023 was a whole year and 2024 is almost half over

12:58.000 --> 13:04.240
And so anyone that's been paying attention as much as I have for the last five years

13:04.880 --> 13:06.880
feels pretty wrung out

13:07.360 --> 13:11.840
Feels pretty spread thin because we have been maintaining

13:12.560 --> 13:16.000
our handhold on this for so long that our

13:16.880 --> 13:18.880
our cognitive grip is straining

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
not because

13:21.760 --> 13:28.400
We don't believe or because we don't understand or because the facts that we've found in those five years haven't edified

13:28.480 --> 13:32.080
Everything that we've come to believe is true because it has

13:34.160 --> 13:40.240
But the question now becomes at what point will other people start to also understand

13:40.240 --> 13:42.240
We got a really good

13:42.960 --> 13:44.960
um hat tip from

13:46.000 --> 13:49.520
Substack today by a guy by the name of Joel Smalley

13:50.160 --> 13:51.200
um

13:51.200 --> 13:56.960
And so if you I don't know if I can just find that now that I send it to myself or something like that

13:57.840 --> 13:59.360
um

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
It's really it's really a great

14:01.920 --> 14:07.120
Sign that that some people are hearing us and I'm very excited about that Ruby. What's the problem?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.240
Um

14:12.240 --> 14:18.400
My dog's outside, but she's not normally outside, but it's it's somehow or another the that's the way things work today

14:18.400 --> 14:21.520
So I don't know where she's doing now. Ruby. What are you doing?

14:25.840 --> 14:32.160
Ladies and gentlemen intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb and the

14:32.720 --> 14:36.640
blatantly obvious fact that no one whenever they address j

14:37.280 --> 14:42.160
Um cooey or giggle and biological. They never addressed this primary message

14:42.240 --> 14:49.680
This is the primary message of the show right now and has been since we were able to codify it this succinctly

14:50.160 --> 14:54.480
I think it's really funny that yesterday on youtube there were lots of people in the chat who were saying that

14:54.960 --> 14:58.160
Jay and calling him names because he won't write up his theories

14:58.400 --> 15:02.160
I think I write up my theories pretty well so well that you know

15:02.160 --> 15:08.240
They only take like three or four sentences and it's it's incredible that people want more

15:08.720 --> 15:14.960
Instead of want to do the work themselves or to find out maybe why it is that I'm so confident to say these things

15:15.040 --> 15:20.000
But transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and I don't think it's a crazy thing to say

15:20.320 --> 15:23.360
I don't think it would have been a crazy thing to say in 2020

15:24.960 --> 15:31.680
In fact, that's why I point out that robert melon will tell you a story on countless podcasts about the fact that he lost his career

15:31.680 --> 15:38.480
Because he spoke out on behalf of jesse gelsinger's death and the fact that they went off the protocol and gave him a higher dose

15:40.560 --> 15:46.640
And that resulted in him losing his career and getting to head up our or set up a breast cancer institute

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And that pain and suffering

15:50.080 --> 15:57.040
um was so great that uh and and he was so standing up for himself with this un blemished

15:57.600 --> 16:02.480
track record that in 2020 when they said they were going to use a dentavirus to

16:03.520 --> 16:08.320
Save people from a novel spreading virus in the uk with a

16:09.440 --> 16:15.920
with a um countermeasure called astroZeneca and when they rolled out the j and j shot in america

16:16.480 --> 16:20.560
We now heard nothing but crickets from from the melon family

16:21.440 --> 16:22.240
And

16:22.240 --> 16:27.440
Jill and robert were saying nothing and when the mr. And a was finally announced the only thing they could say was hey

16:27.680 --> 16:31.120
We also hey, we also did that. Hey, hey

16:34.560 --> 16:40.960
And so truck transfection in healthy humans was criminally negligent in 2020 and many many more

16:41.360 --> 16:48.000
Professionals should have known this than actually apparently did and one of the most blatantly obvious ones

16:48.640 --> 16:50.640
Is robert wallis melon

16:53.360 --> 16:55.360
Somebody who i

16:55.360 --> 16:58.400
Posit is probably a participant in the

16:59.120 --> 17:05.840
Whatever you would like to call it sciaop the fifth generation warfare the governance by lying

17:07.600 --> 17:10.320
That that that we are currently under

17:12.000 --> 17:15.440
And that's the title actually of the sub stack hat tip that we got

17:16.320 --> 17:20.480
The the government murders people and lies about it in order to govern us

17:23.120 --> 17:29.440
And r&a cannot pandemic is a very simple thing for any advanced biologists to think about

17:31.040 --> 17:35.280
Everyone from my former boss like edward mozer in norway

17:36.320 --> 17:45.200
Or my former boss in in in in raltradam steven kushner or my former boss at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine

17:45.520 --> 17:47.520
brian mac hooks

17:47.680 --> 17:50.400
Or the department head at the university of pittsburgh

17:51.680 --> 17:53.680
peter strick

17:54.160 --> 17:57.360
Or any of the other people that i worked with in

17:58.240 --> 17:59.600
in

17:59.600 --> 18:06.400
The netherlands or in norway or in america or have ever seen at the society for neuroscience meetings that i've attended

18:06.800 --> 18:14.000
Or have ever met at any of the meetings and and and gatherings that i've been in in italy for some of this hippocampal work

18:14.960 --> 18:21.200
Any of those biologists are sophisticated enough that if off the cuff over a glass of wine

18:21.280 --> 18:23.280
You said can you explain to me what?

18:23.280 --> 18:30.320
Transfection means they would have a very succinct and very similar answer to what i have given you for its definition

18:30.720 --> 18:34.480
Which is the use of r&a to express a protein where it doesn't belong

18:35.440 --> 18:40.560
to upregulate or downregulate the expression of a protein using m r&a or d&a

18:41.440 --> 18:45.920
And any number of methodologies to get it where you want it to be

18:46.720 --> 18:52.240
And yet somehow or another all of these professional biologists who use

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
Transfection on their bench

18:55.120 --> 18:57.600
All the time and their postdocs use

18:57.920 --> 19:03.120
Transfection on the bench all the time and their postdocs teach their phd students to use

19:03.920 --> 19:06.640
Transfection on the surgery bench all the time

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
Were somehow unable

19:10.080 --> 19:15.200
To realize that this methodology would not be a good idea for their healthy parents

19:15.920 --> 19:21.360
Their elderly healthy parents that they wanted to be around for as long as possible to have as many

19:21.600 --> 19:26.240
Christmases with as possible yet and definitely not for their pregnant daughters

19:29.440 --> 19:32.320
And yet somehow or another all of these people

19:33.120 --> 19:36.240
All of them almost without exception

19:37.520 --> 19:39.520
Still aren't speaking up

19:40.160 --> 19:43.440
They're still quiet. They're still ignorant. They still don't get it

19:44.240 --> 19:52.240
And the most hilarious story that we have been given recently is the one that Robert Malone gave on Steve kersh's vsrf

19:52.800 --> 19:58.960
Podcast two or three days ago if you haven't seen it, please see it. It is must see viewing

19:59.760 --> 20:02.000
Because Robert Malone

20:02.000 --> 20:04.800
Exposes everything that we have ever

20:05.440 --> 20:11.760
Talked about with regard to his claims early on versus his claims middle versus his claims now

20:12.160 --> 20:15.680
And the evolution is absolutely incriminating

20:19.440 --> 20:25.120
Because he didn't tell us the whole truth when he came out and he's probably still not telling us the whole truth now

20:25.600 --> 20:29.440
And it is all because he plays for them whoever they are

20:32.720 --> 20:37.920
The people who would like to end the national sovereignty that used to define the world

20:38.400 --> 20:44.720
The individual sovereignty that defines our existence and our republic as we imagine it to be

20:45.280 --> 20:47.280
And

20:48.720 --> 20:55.680
The fact of the matter is is that RNA cannot pandemic and any of these people could figure it out or could explain it to you

20:55.680 --> 20:59.840
But choose not to and many of them have chosen to lie to you about

21:00.640 --> 21:06.720
What I have taught lie to you about what I have said or even distort or or or just not even say

21:07.440 --> 21:10.320
That I've explained it adequately but pretend that I haven't

21:10.640 --> 21:12.640
And

21:14.160 --> 21:19.280
So it's just a question of time ladies and gentlemen, when is the best time for us to really

21:20.000 --> 21:25.920
Roll over these people and give a five hour presentation where we show each one of them as liars

21:26.720 --> 21:29.520
Where we teach the biology that they lied about

21:30.480 --> 21:34.640
And that we demonstrate that we have been teaching this biology since the very beginning

21:34.640 --> 21:43.760
What would a five hour show like that do with names and with actual videos from all of these people saying the things that I claim they say

21:46.560 --> 21:51.840
Because I have hard drives and I have backups of those hard drives and other places that all show it

21:53.520 --> 21:59.840
All I would have to do is just put the slide deck into powerpoint and just sit back and narrate it for five hours

22:00.480 --> 22:03.680
And most of these people would be exposed

22:04.640 --> 22:08.880
And not just a little bit not just like oh wow that's weird. No, I mean like exposed

22:12.960 --> 22:19.120
And you yourself could do it with the same just all you would have to do is curate the videos that you find

22:19.120 --> 22:21.360
You can't just find it and go wow

22:21.440 --> 22:25.600
You have to take the link. You have to pull it down. You have to screen capture it

22:28.240 --> 22:34.000
And you have to listen to two hours to get the three minute quote where he just says dumb stuff for three minutes straight

22:34.000 --> 22:37.680
That you just can't say this and he never says it again

22:38.320 --> 22:42.000
Because the lot of this was improvised because a lot of this is off script

22:42.000 --> 22:45.600
They never thought there would be somebody like jonathan cooey

22:46.160 --> 22:53.200
Who would be in need of control and who would resist the possibility of jumping on board with a book

22:53.840 --> 22:59.280
Ladies and gentlemen, what I am proposing to you is very important to understand

23:04.640 --> 23:06.640
what

23:06.640 --> 23:08.640
What I am proposing to you

23:13.120 --> 23:15.120
What I am proposing to you

23:16.720 --> 23:21.840
Is that this book is part of the same illusion that this book is part of

23:26.400 --> 23:31.360
This book is the same book is the same illusion that this book is part of

23:32.240 --> 23:38.160
And what this book represents for me and my family is an offer an offer amp

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
Just go with this story

23:41.840 --> 23:43.840
Look how much money will pay you

23:46.080 --> 23:50.160
Look at what a nice staff scientist position you can get after you

23:50.720 --> 23:54.800
You you help with this book now, let's do an interview about the book

23:55.680 --> 24:00.880
And tell us what your contribution was to the book and then they made that interview and then guess what

24:02.000 --> 24:05.920
Children's health defense said that interview wasn't very good. It's not really going to sell the book

24:06.720 --> 24:11.200
It's it's kind of it's like a I don't know. It's a weird can we record that interview again

24:12.080 --> 24:16.480
Then we went on christmas break then jay's position was ended

24:20.960 --> 24:24.240
This book was my opportunity to be emily cop

24:26.240 --> 24:30.960
Or to testify in front of congress that there was a lab leak and that I know how they did it

24:31.040 --> 24:37.440
It was it was with restriction enzyme reconstruction of a giant plasmid that you know, blah, blah, blah clones

24:40.160 --> 24:46.080
It was right there all I had to do was say that clones could do it that clones can travel a little bit that there is

24:46.640 --> 24:48.640
Some transmission

24:50.880 --> 24:56.240
Wouldn't have to be very specific. I could have just you know kind of said I don't know but I I think

24:56.800 --> 25:00.640
And everybody would have gone along with it. That's the reason why

25:01.760 --> 25:04.160
Ladies and gentlemen, if you just open this book

25:04.800 --> 25:10.880
It's worth buying for this one reason because you just opened the book and right in the beginning

25:11.680 --> 25:13.680
Right there

25:16.640 --> 25:18.640
Is my name

25:19.040 --> 25:26.880
This book would not have been possible without the expertise and invaluable insights provided by jonathan j kui phd

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
And then gavin de becker, you know

25:30.320 --> 25:32.560
Robert f kennedy jr's best friend

25:34.960 --> 25:38.320
If they wanted me to not be known

25:39.920 --> 25:42.960
I could have been included with all the chd defense team

25:43.840 --> 25:48.160
Up here with some of my friends who are still some of these people are still my friends

25:50.880 --> 25:57.120
Chd's wonderful half of these people are amazing heroes the other half I probably never met

26:00.240 --> 26:03.200
This is not an illusion here

26:03.200 --> 26:10.400
I'm not in the index of this book six times every single quote that I have in this book

26:11.840 --> 26:15.600
Is real and important everything that I put in this book

26:16.400 --> 26:20.160
Essentially because I knew where I was before this

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
This service ended

26:23.040 --> 26:28.800
Before that I was done helping bobby with this book. I was already telling everybody that they faked it

26:29.600 --> 26:31.600
I was already trying to

26:31.840 --> 26:36.160
Make sure that everybody on the editorial team and robert f kennedy jr

26:36.160 --> 26:40.160
Knew that once he asked me about infectious clones and I

26:41.200 --> 26:45.120
Forced myself to read through it. I realized that they lied

26:45.600 --> 26:51.360
That was the reason this book and writing it and helping robert f kennedy jr to write it

26:51.600 --> 26:57.840
Is the reason why uh the impetus was given to me to really figure out what clones are and what they are not

26:58.160 --> 27:01.440
And it made me realize that infectious clones are the way they lied

27:02.160 --> 27:04.640
And they have been lying for a very long time

27:05.040 --> 27:09.040
Because infectious clones allows them to start in the same place

27:09.440 --> 27:14.560
And it allows them to start with whatever quantity they need in order for their experiment to work

27:15.920 --> 27:22.560
And up into including if they needed a sequence to be found in several places on earth to be misconstrued

27:22.960 --> 27:26.560
Has a novel spreading pathogen. It would be cake

27:28.800 --> 27:34.240
And that's also in this book hidden inside of this giant 500 plus page book

27:34.720 --> 27:38.640
Is a statement by jonathan j kui that says they don't even need a virus

27:39.040 --> 27:43.840
There is an a a paragraph in here that says how they use infectious clones

27:44.400 --> 27:49.120
To use to work on rna viruses that they could otherwise not work on

27:50.400 --> 27:57.680
Because rna is not a pattered integrity can't put it in a cell culture and and have more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and

27:57.840 --> 27:59.440
And more and more of it. It doesn't work like that

28:00.160 --> 28:01.600
And they know it

28:01.600 --> 28:04.560
And judy mikovitz knows it. That's the crazy part

28:04.960 --> 28:07.440
Robert melon knows it. That's the crazy part

28:07.920 --> 28:14.000
Vincent ranssen yel rachen yellow knows it. That's the crazy part. Tony fauci knows it ralph beric knows it

28:14.480 --> 28:16.080
even frickin

28:16.080 --> 28:18.480
probably peter desak knows it

28:20.240 --> 28:22.080
They all know

28:22.080 --> 28:27.680
That intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

28:27.680 --> 28:33.760
They all know that transfection and healthy humans was always criminally negligent and they know that rna can't pandemic

28:33.760 --> 28:38.960
That's why they're very confident telling stories about gain of function research and it's not going to be bad

28:39.040 --> 28:42.080
And it'll be fine and wah-wah-wah because it will be

28:43.520 --> 28:45.520
Because gain of function is a mythology

28:48.400 --> 28:52.960
And if we teach our children that what happened in the last five years was a pandemic

28:53.600 --> 28:56.240
Then that mythology will become reality for them

28:57.200 --> 29:01.280
And they can be governed by the mythology of pandemics and public health

29:02.160 --> 29:03.760
forever

29:03.760 --> 29:09.120
And that means your grandchildren will turn over their biological data to the transhumanists

29:10.000 --> 29:12.880
the globalists the the tyrants the

29:13.920 --> 29:15.200
Slavers

29:15.200 --> 29:18.000
That's what they are the slavers that are doing this

29:21.360 --> 29:23.520
The slavers that are doing this

29:27.120 --> 29:29.120
I

29:32.560 --> 29:33.760
Dump that um

29:33.760 --> 29:36.800
Just another Tuesday here on gig ome biological

29:37.360 --> 29:43.440
Where our hypothesis is the who declared a pandemic of a dangerous novel virus, but yeah, it was really

29:43.680 --> 29:50.640
Um, the goal was total surrender and they've done it with a massively spectacular commitment to lie

29:51.280 --> 29:52.240
Um

29:52.240 --> 29:55.600
Early what I want is how it looks a lot like this. I want people to complain

29:56.240 --> 29:57.440
So what do I do?

29:57.440 --> 29:58.720
I go to Des Moines

29:58.720 --> 30:01.920
Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen. I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years

30:02.240 --> 30:03.440
I go to Des Moines

30:03.440 --> 30:05.840
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines

30:06.480 --> 30:07.840
I go to seattle

30:07.840 --> 30:09.600
I infect a couple of cases there

30:10.160 --> 30:12.080
I go to north carolina

30:12.080 --> 30:13.840
I go to wisconsin

30:13.840 --> 30:17.840
What i'm doing is i'm using a dispersion method. I would say to the answer

30:19.680 --> 30:23.440
I would say to the the person who says how do we know the clones are infectious

30:23.520 --> 30:27.120
I think that's a good question. It's something that a lot of people have been putting on me

30:27.120 --> 30:29.920
I don't think they're infectious. That's not the right word

30:30.640 --> 30:36.560
What I think is is that if you sprayed RNA or you could apply RNA to someone's skin or

30:37.920 --> 30:40.800
Make them inhale it and it was in a lipid nanoparticle

30:40.800 --> 30:44.960
I think that there is biological potential for whatever the RNA encodes

30:47.040 --> 30:49.200
To be expressed who I didn't start my watch

30:49.280 --> 30:51.120
um

30:51.120 --> 30:54.320
And and so what I what we should say is transfect

30:54.400 --> 31:00.960
I do think that RNA and a lipid nanoparticle if it was aerosolized or applied in some other way that I don't know

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
Some methodology they could

31:03.200 --> 31:09.120
Transfect people with an infectious clone. So we should call it a transfectious clone indeed

31:09.200 --> 31:11.680
I think that would be the better word. So yes

31:11.760 --> 31:13.760
um

31:13.760 --> 31:19.120
And uh, I'll I'll play Giordano again because I think it's important to get it on screen early

31:19.200 --> 31:22.160
But I want is high morbidity. I want people to complain

31:22.800 --> 31:24.000
So what do I do?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.280
I go to Des Moines

31:25.280 --> 31:28.560
Ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen. I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years

31:28.800 --> 31:30.000
I go to Des Moines

31:30.000 --> 31:32.400
I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines

31:33.040 --> 31:34.400
I go to Seattle

31:34.400 --> 31:36.160
I infect a couple of cases there

31:36.720 --> 31:38.640
I go to north carolina

31:38.640 --> 31:40.480
I go to wisconsin

31:40.480 --> 31:47.280
What i'm doing is i'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition

31:47.680 --> 31:50.960
These individuals complain again. This is a central nervous system condition

31:51.040 --> 31:53.120
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do

31:53.680 --> 31:58.560
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms

31:59.120 --> 32:01.680
And then what I do the real bug that I use

32:02.400 --> 32:03.760
Is the internet

32:03.760 --> 32:06.320
I take attribution for that. Yes. I'm a terrorist group

32:06.880 --> 32:13.440
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x y and z

32:13.760 --> 32:15.680
These people are really sick with this

32:15.760 --> 32:16.880
But then I say

32:16.880 --> 32:19.760
Others who are also infected will show subdramal

32:19.920 --> 32:24.240
predrome signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety

32:24.960 --> 32:26.320
sleeplessness

32:26.320 --> 32:28.000
agitation

32:28.000 --> 32:32.320
What i've now done is i've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacle

32:32.480 --> 32:37.200
And i've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door

32:37.760 --> 32:41.200
The cdc comes back and says nonsense. That's not real

32:41.760 --> 32:43.360
I come back and say

32:43.360 --> 32:45.200
That's fake news

32:45.920 --> 32:52.960
Okay, so now I want to clarify this a little bit because I do think that that we have to work on this part of the show yet

32:53.520 --> 32:55.600
Um and this part of the message because

32:56.240 --> 33:00.240
When I put this group of people on the screen, this is not an exclusive group

33:00.240 --> 33:04.960
It's not an exhaustive group. I should have more pictures up here like kelly victory and dr

33:04.960 --> 33:05.920
Drew

33:05.920 --> 33:10.000
And and many many more people should be up here in all of these groups

33:10.800 --> 33:15.760
Um, you know eric cappolino for example should be up here in the in the no virus corner

33:16.880 --> 33:18.880
Uh, we should have other other

33:19.600 --> 33:24.960
People on here, but these are the people that i've come in contact with these are the people that have had a personal

33:25.200 --> 33:26.720
interaction with me

33:26.720 --> 33:31.840
And so some of the other people that I know are important are just people that I have less personal

33:32.320 --> 33:36.480
Experience with and so I I tend to stay a little more, you know, whatever on them

33:37.360 --> 33:43.840
Now what I'm suggesting is is that the the just like the spars pandemic document

33:43.840 --> 33:50.400
Which I have said repeatedly is just a public facing brochure of a much more detailed plan

33:51.120 --> 33:56.480
military exercise that would have been classified or only available to people with the right lanyard

33:57.360 --> 33:59.760
And I would suggest to you that dr

33:59.920 --> 34:06.320
Giordano should be the scene as the same guy a guy who is a public facing youtube friendly

34:07.280 --> 34:08.320
um

34:08.320 --> 34:10.320
brochure if you will

34:10.560 --> 34:15.840
For what is really going on and so when he tells you that they'll see it a few cases in a few places

34:16.240 --> 34:18.560
And then use the internet to claim

34:19.680 --> 34:25.360
Responsibility for it and use the internet to see the idea that there will be a symptomatic spread

34:25.840 --> 34:27.840
That's an incomplete

34:27.840 --> 34:32.400
public version of the the story and the operation

34:33.040 --> 34:38.320
And the more complicated classified real national security version of this

34:38.880 --> 34:41.680
Would include many of the people on this screen

34:43.040 --> 34:47.120
And they would be playing roles like that described as epigirl

34:48.160 --> 34:50.880
in the spars pandemic document, but not

34:52.240 --> 34:56.640
Epigirl in the spars pandemic document where it's a uncontrolled

34:57.280 --> 35:03.120
public person that's spreading information that's inconvenient for the state's narrative control

35:04.400 --> 35:05.840
But rather

35:05.840 --> 35:13.600
Epigirl would be people that the state put in place to make sure that the limited spectrum of debate which presupposes

35:14.320 --> 35:17.280
Rather reinforces the presuppositions of the state

35:18.800 --> 35:25.200
Not my words, but the words of nom Chomsky would be preserved the limited spectrum of debate

35:26.640 --> 35:30.800
That protects and reinforces the presupposition of the state narrative

35:31.520 --> 35:33.680
These people epigirls

35:34.720 --> 35:39.680
Were put out there were given parts of the narrative and then given their own stage

35:40.480 --> 35:46.800
Their own stage on sub stack their own stage on gab their own stage on telegram their own stage everywhere

35:47.200 --> 35:49.200
Maybe even a podcast or 10

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And

35:52.000 --> 35:58.640
As they moved around on these stages and collected fans then fans got a piece of the truth and the rest of it was

35:59.040 --> 36:04.800
The mythology that we've all been led to believe is what we need to figure out the

36:05.280 --> 36:12.320
mystery of the novel virus and whether it's a lab leak or a natural virus the dichotomy that gets you nowhere

36:13.280 --> 36:16.400
Of course, what's missing in that dichotomy is the third lie

36:16.880 --> 36:21.440
Which is there are no viruses at all nothing zero zip and it's close

36:21.920 --> 36:27.760
That's very close to the truth, but it's not the truth and the way that they have pursued

36:29.600 --> 36:32.480
This position and maintained their position here

36:32.960 --> 36:39.600
Belize the the likelihood that they are too in play at least some of them are playing with us

36:40.400 --> 36:46.000
Because the most succinct way I can say it is is that although they're very very good at describing

36:46.000 --> 36:48.560
Why there's no virus and the plays that were made

36:49.040 --> 36:52.320
Uh, they can't quite come to the realization that people died

36:52.640 --> 36:57.280
And so that means that people were murdered in order to preserve the lie of virology

36:57.920 --> 36:59.920
And it would be such an easy way

37:00.400 --> 37:08.880
For them to have scored a touchdown over and over again in 2020 or 2021 or 2022 or

37:08.880 --> 37:16.000
2023 when hundreds of thousands of americans were being murdered under the pretense of covid and they did nothing

37:20.800 --> 37:22.800
And that's what I believe

37:23.360 --> 37:32.640
I believe that people like Andy Kaufman effectively are as bad as Robert Malone and as bad as Brett Weinstein and as bad as all these other

37:32.640 --> 37:35.040
Proposers that purported to be

37:35.840 --> 37:44.000
Opposing something but actually making sure that their followers would never ask effective questions and essentially get stuck in a hamster wheel

37:46.240 --> 37:48.560
And unfortunately anybody that was watching me

37:49.280 --> 37:56.160
Was also caught in a hamster wheel in 2020 and 2021 in particular because I was forced

37:57.200 --> 38:01.040
Coarse tricked into a hamster wheel in 2021

38:02.000 --> 38:04.480
When in 2020, I was actually crushing it

38:05.440 --> 38:10.240
Um, and so also I have identified I can identify the people who got me in

38:11.040 --> 38:17.680
I can identify the people who got me running in the hamster wheel and a lot of them are actually on this page

38:20.000 --> 38:27.600
That's why I work particularly on these people and not other people. It's not that I I have a I have particular

38:28.560 --> 38:34.800
Personal experience with these all of these people and so um, it is with great humility

38:35.360 --> 38:39.200
That I suggest that we are still being misled by many of these people

38:51.200 --> 38:53.920
Gosh, that is a great theme. It just makes me smile

38:54.080 --> 39:01.680
Um, ladies and gentlemen today, we're going to watch mikovitz and witmore on xm rv from october

39:03.040 --> 39:04.240
eighth

39:04.240 --> 39:06.240
2000

39:07.120 --> 39:08.880
2009

39:08.880 --> 39:13.440
Uh, and it's a really interesting interview for what they talk about that's all i'm going to say

39:13.920 --> 39:15.680
And i'm going to try and take some notes

39:16.320 --> 39:21.840
I don't know if it's on abc or what this is in a vada newsmakers. I guess this is not abc

39:22.320 --> 39:28.320
And again, you can see here. Shout out to mark. He's a tonic. Uh, he's a tonic live

39:29.120 --> 39:34.000
Um, he's the guy who put this up. There's already 117 views. That's pretty encouraging

39:34.480 --> 39:38.800
Um, if you're not subscribed to his channel, which is very likely you could do that that wouldn't hurt

39:39.360 --> 39:41.360
Um, he's also got a two

39:42.240 --> 39:44.880
That hasn't been canceled yet. So you could also do that

39:45.440 --> 39:47.200
Um, some local news

39:47.200 --> 39:50.640
Uh here and we're also going to see some throwback commercials

39:50.720 --> 39:54.000
Which I may or may not watch just for for fun

39:56.080 --> 39:58.080
Second work

39:58.080 --> 40:02.960
I think it's playing. Oh, yeah, welcome to navada newsmakers on the program today a life-changing

40:03.040 --> 40:05.360
Discovery from the whittemore peterson institute

40:05.680 --> 40:13.280
You will be astounded on the program today a net whittemore and judy mikovitz plus on the parapundit panel today helen foley russel

40:14.560 --> 40:17.840
infectious retrovirus xm rv

40:18.480 --> 40:23.760
pro and paul eenos is all coming up next on all new navada newsmakers

40:26.320 --> 40:33.360
navada newsmakers brought to you in part by the tahoe rino industrial center the world's largest industrial part

40:33.920 --> 40:40.160
The world and the world and the industrial world journal and really have to work hard to get my voice to do that

40:40.400 --> 40:45.840
I really need to move things up and down in order to get my voice to really act in such a way

40:46.800 --> 40:49.600
It's very hard to talk like that all the time

40:54.880 --> 40:56.880
What in the hell

40:58.000 --> 41:04.320
I think this is a las vegas commercials. You're way inside local entertainment las vegas review journal get inside

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
Oh, that's no, that's wow

41:08.160 --> 41:10.160
You want to watch these?

41:10.480 --> 41:13.760
Xenomorphic meringue leukemia virus. Thank you very much

41:16.720 --> 41:18.720
You

41:20.240 --> 41:26.880
Oh, you don't want to watch them or hey, you've got to visit nothing bundt cakes. They literally sell nothing bundt cakes

41:28.480 --> 41:34.480
I'm sorry. That's funny. That's a really good pun. Nothing bundt cakes. Oh my shit

41:38.640 --> 41:44.480
Water resources come from fresh clean ground water. All right fresh clean ground water

41:46.320 --> 41:50.720
That's awesome retailers businesses were all of a shot. Did you hear that?

41:51.280 --> 42:00.160
You retailers retailers. Whoa, that's a deep voice. Well, then good for Nevada good for real association of the battle working to strengthen

42:00.160 --> 42:06.800
Oh my gosh, that's the deepest voice I've ever heard. I'll tell you retailers create nearly half a million jobs for Nevada

42:06.880 --> 42:11.840
I'm sorry sir. Your voice is so low that it can barely listen to it. It makes me feel like a child

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
a no-holds bar political horror

42:15.120 --> 42:19.120
Now from the Nevada news makers broadcast headquarters here is sam shad

42:19.360 --> 42:20.800
And back on Nevada news makers

42:20.800 --> 42:22.960
We are thrilled to welcome the program and at wittemore

42:22.960 --> 42:27.040
She's the president and founder of the wittemore piotis and institute and judy mikevitz

42:27.280 --> 42:30.640
Is the director of research for wpi also a doctor

42:31.200 --> 42:33.760
Um, I can't think of a more exciting program

42:33.760 --> 42:37.680
I've done because what we're about to talk about is world-trattering news

42:37.840 --> 42:41.680
I want to read if I could just the first paragraph of your press release

42:42.000 --> 42:49.440
Uh, the wittemore piotis and institute scientist discovers a significant link between xm rv and ma cfs

42:49.440 --> 42:52.640
Which we'll go into in a moment a recently identified retroviol

42:53.360 --> 43:01.040
Retrovirus called xm rv has been linked to a debilitating neuro immune disease that affects more than a million people in the united states

43:01.440 --> 43:05.520
Scientists from the wittemore piotis and institute located at the university of nevaterino

43:05.840 --> 43:11.440
And their collaborators from the national cancer institute and cleveland clinic have discovered a retroviral link

43:11.760 --> 43:15.200
to my myalgic encephalomyelitis

43:16.160 --> 43:20.960
And chronic fatigue syndrome. They recently published their groundbreaking findings in the journal science

43:21.200 --> 43:29.360
One of the world's leading journals of original scientific research global news and commentary the paper entitled detection of infectious retrovirus

43:29.520 --> 43:36.000
xm rv in the blood cells of cfs patients is a major breakthrough in understanding the origins of this disease

43:36.240 --> 43:39.760
Let's start out with the most basic, which is what is a retrovirus?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Okay, so there are only two other human

43:42.640 --> 43:44.080
Let's um

43:44.080 --> 43:48.800
Let's let's preface this first. I know i'm going to let it play don't get mad at me for stopping it for a second

43:48.800 --> 43:50.640
But let's just preface it first remember

43:51.200 --> 43:58.080
We don't have a vaccine for AIDS AIDS has already been around for 10 years or more 20 years or more now. It's 2008

43:59.200 --> 44:03.440
and chronic fatigue syndrome and this this uh

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
This myelitis that he mentioned

44:07.040 --> 44:08.480
um

44:08.480 --> 44:14.080
These have striking striking striking parallels to long covid

44:14.800 --> 44:19.440
And after this video if we have enough time depending on how much my mouth moves

44:20.000 --> 44:23.760
Um, I would like to watch a very recently released video

44:24.320 --> 44:32.560
By the american medical association about long covid with one of the time magazine hundred most influential people on earth

44:33.520 --> 44:38.640
Um this korean immunologist who's been talking about long covid for four years

44:40.640 --> 44:46.960
And how striking it is that what we were talking about what they were talking about in the 80s the 90s

44:47.440 --> 44:49.920
the 2000s up to 2008

44:50.640 --> 44:55.840
And explaining in a science paper that there's some retrovirus from mice

44:56.800 --> 44:58.800
That can cause leukemia

44:58.880 --> 45:04.400
Maybe responsible for crazy shit. You're not going to believe what she says in this video

45:05.280 --> 45:06.640
um

45:06.640 --> 45:08.640
And so let's think carefully

45:09.200 --> 45:16.720
In terms of the historical context of what she's saying and what implications it might have for the fact that she is currently

45:17.440 --> 45:19.440
part of the lalapalooza

45:20.400 --> 45:25.920
She often could be considered to have her own stage. She has her own sort of version of the

45:26.400 --> 45:29.760
The narrative her own version of the narrative that figures in her own

45:30.240 --> 45:33.600
You know biology that figures in this whole story

45:35.680 --> 45:39.600
And it's extraordinary ladies and gentlemen because we just are hearing

45:40.160 --> 45:43.840
The words of people from the past and you can see

45:44.400 --> 45:50.720
Hopefully if you've been studying with us me for a long time, you can see how obvious it is that this is one

45:51.280 --> 45:57.120
Continuous game that has been played upon us that was played on our parents before it was played on us

45:57.600 --> 46:04.400
And and and it is in a continuous game of obfuscation of understanding all this stuff is outside of us

46:04.480 --> 46:08.480
All of this biology is what we must live in spite of

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It's nothing to do with us

46:13.120 --> 46:16.560
These are things that fight against us that work against us

46:17.440 --> 46:19.200
Listen carefully

46:19.200 --> 46:22.000
The most basic which is what is a retrovirus?

46:22.560 --> 46:25.840
Well, there are only two other human retrovirus is known

46:26.320 --> 46:31.600
human t cell leukemia virus and hiv the retrovirus that causes aids

46:32.000 --> 46:41.840
Cell leukemia virus there are only two other human retrovirus is known human t cell leukemia virus and hiv the retrovirus that causes aids

46:42.160 --> 46:44.160
both of these viruses cause

46:44.720 --> 46:49.920
Cancer is neurological diseases immune deficiencies and inflammatory disorders in man

46:50.800 --> 46:55.920
That xm rv is only the third human infectious retrovirus shown and that's what our work just did

46:56.560 --> 47:00.880
What made you so wait did she just say human t cell leukemia virus

47:02.800 --> 47:06.080
Isn't that h t lv? Isn't that the virus that

47:07.200 --> 47:09.520
um mark hu satanic has been

47:10.160 --> 47:13.280
telling us a story about a pre judy mikovitz

47:14.160 --> 47:16.160
kind of character that

47:16.160 --> 47:18.000
tried to explain

47:18.000 --> 47:21.040
Didn't she try to explain maybe even aids with

47:21.920 --> 47:23.920
h t lv

47:24.240 --> 47:28.640
And then somehow or another kind of got discredited like a fall lady

47:28.720 --> 47:32.560
You know a fall guy and got blamed for something that didn't wasn't there

47:33.680 --> 47:35.840
And wasn't that with hilary kaprowski?

47:36.800 --> 47:45.120
Who risquetty who she actually did this work with actually also worked with so it's like one continuous mentor chain

47:46.080 --> 47:52.640
mentor chain being you know inheriting good ideas from people that you consider smart

47:54.560 --> 47:56.560
And so the person who

47:57.520 --> 48:01.360
Who taught risquetty was hilary kaprowski

48:01.840 --> 48:04.960
You know the Stanley plot can hilary per kaprowski

48:05.680 --> 48:11.680
um leaderberg, you know this generation of of of charlatans

48:13.680 --> 48:15.680
Stanley prussner

48:17.120 --> 48:25.520
And now it starts to become all very clear already because if she's saying human t cell leukemia virus, what would gig ombiological say

48:26.880 --> 48:32.800
Well gig ombiological would say what we've been suggesting for almost two years now. It is possible

48:33.440 --> 48:35.600
That a lot of this

48:35.600 --> 48:37.440
Baltimore

48:37.440 --> 48:39.440
classification system is a

48:40.480 --> 48:41.840
mythology

48:41.840 --> 48:51.280
That has been used to bamboozle all of academic biologists into believing that these signals and these enzymes are the exclusive purview

48:51.840 --> 48:53.840
of obligate

48:53.840 --> 48:58.400
molecular pathogens in the wild rather than an echo

49:00.080 --> 49:01.520
Of

49:01.520 --> 49:06.320
communication mechanisms and enzymes that we ourselves use for particular reasons

49:09.520 --> 49:15.840
And so when you say that a t cell leukemia virus exists what the suggestion here is with this

49:16.400 --> 49:19.680
Mythology is that it's a virus. I guess it comes from somewhere else

49:20.800 --> 49:22.800
because it's a virus

49:23.120 --> 49:25.760
And then it causes t cell leukemia

49:26.640 --> 49:28.240
hmm interesting

49:28.240 --> 49:36.560
Imagine a scenario where your immune system uses retroviruses to communicate between t cell clones or across t cell clones

49:37.040 --> 49:40.960
And that if that communication mechanism were to go awry

49:43.440 --> 49:47.520
Then t cell populations or t cell clonal populations could be dysregulated

49:49.440 --> 49:58.160
Imagine if you discovered this mechanism and wanted to maximize its usefulness to you in terms of governing a population or a world

49:58.240 --> 50:05.200
Imagine if you started to understand human biology, but you didn't want

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
Humans to know

50:09.040 --> 50:14.320
Well, the easiest way to do it would be to tell people that what you had discovered wasn't part of them

50:16.000 --> 50:21.360
And I think that's what a lot of these people have been lying about for a couple generations now a couple

50:22.240 --> 50:26.160
Generations of mentorship have been passing on a lie

50:27.120 --> 50:31.040
About the fidelity of our understanding at this size scale

50:31.120 --> 50:35.440
And exclusively telling a story that all of these signals are exogenous

50:35.840 --> 50:42.560
And that none of them can be endogenous and certainly none of them can be endogenous during a state of health

50:43.840 --> 50:48.400
And this is the biggest lie probably in human history

50:50.240 --> 50:54.160
Because all other lies fall off of it because this is how they have

50:54.800 --> 50:59.600
removed our reverence for ourselves removed the respect that

51:00.160 --> 51:07.760
Previous generations of academic biologists have had for the irreducible complexity the sacred that is still present

51:08.480 --> 51:11.920
But for some reason most academic biologists can no longer see

51:14.480 --> 51:19.920
And the giddiness with which she presents the ideas to come are actually absolutely extraordinary

51:20.160 --> 51:22.160
If

51:22.160 --> 51:24.080
mice have

51:24.080 --> 51:26.000
retroviruses

51:26.000 --> 51:30.960
And monkeys have retroviruses and people have retroviruses they are not

51:31.520 --> 51:36.720
And they cannot be the most parsimonious explanation is that they are not all

51:37.520 --> 51:39.520
Obligate molecular pathogens

51:40.480 --> 51:42.320
from nature

51:42.320 --> 51:48.080
But rather the more elegant more beautiful more more irreducibly complex

51:48.320 --> 51:50.800
Explanation would be that all

51:51.600 --> 51:57.920
Eukaryotic tissues use exosomal communication for signaling and that the higher

51:58.400 --> 52:03.520
The organism is and the more complicated the pattern integrity is the more intricate

52:04.240 --> 52:05.600
the

52:05.600 --> 52:09.600
Exosomal communication the retroviral communication would be

52:10.880 --> 52:12.880
expected to be

52:13.360 --> 52:16.880
That's where we are. That's where those people were 30 years ago

52:17.120 --> 52:19.120
And they've just been committed

52:19.680 --> 52:25.760
spectacularly to lying about it so that it can be used to govern us it can be used to profit from us

52:26.960 --> 52:28.960
Can be used to limit

52:29.840 --> 52:31.840
Our understanding of ourselves

52:32.560 --> 52:34.000
Undermine

52:34.000 --> 52:39.920
What should be what did I say on the phone to care this morning in a text is like the perfect words

52:40.720 --> 52:42.720
the perfect words

52:42.960 --> 52:44.960
However, you explain creation

52:45.840 --> 52:47.200
There is a reverence

52:47.200 --> 52:55.520
I believe all thinking humans should naturally develop and if they don't it's because they were prevented from developing it

52:58.160 --> 53:05.120
However, you explain creation there is a reverence. I believe all thinking humans should naturally develop and if they don't

53:05.760 --> 53:09.120
It's because they've been prevented from developing it

53:13.760 --> 53:15.760
I

53:15.760 --> 53:17.280
Keep going Judy

53:17.280 --> 53:21.360
Because this was originally discovered in prostate cancer tissue

53:22.160 --> 53:26.960
Of men with a specific genetic immune system defect by dr. Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic

53:26.960 --> 53:33.280
Why did you put that over to CF? I agree with Pamela in the chat. Pamela is such an angel

53:34.560 --> 53:38.160
And she's right the Cleveland Clinic comes up a number of times

53:38.240 --> 53:39.760
uh

53:39.760 --> 53:45.280
And um and also in the pandemic the Cleveland Clinic is a good red flag to have just like columbia

53:45.760 --> 53:47.760
Sammy that that to no one

53:47.760 --> 53:53.760
There's a couple other places. The prostate cancer gene number one is an antiviral enzyme

53:53.920 --> 53:57.920
Sorry, I gotta go back over to the cfs of an improstate cancer tissue

53:58.320 --> 54:01.760
Uh, this is important and inflammatory disorders in man

54:02.160 --> 54:07.760
That xmrv is only the third human infectious retrovirus shown and that's what our work just did

54:08.320 --> 54:13.280
What made you look for this because um, this said was originally discovered in prostate cancer tissue

54:14.000 --> 54:18.880
Of men with a specific genetic immune system defect by dr. Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic

54:18.880 --> 54:25.040
Why did you put that over to cfs and me that that genetic link was the the heretic

54:25.120 --> 54:28.080
I need to write that down because that's obviously stuff. I gotta read this

54:28.640 --> 54:30.960
Was originally discovered in prostate cancer tissue

54:31.760 --> 54:36.560
Of men with a specific genetic immune system defect by dr. Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic

54:36.560 --> 54:44.800
Why did you uh, put that over to the cfs and me that that genetic link was the the hereditary prostate cancer gene number one

54:45.200 --> 54:52.800
Is an antiviral enzyme that is also a hallmark of the abnormalities of me cfs patients

54:52.800 --> 55:00.400
So we thought that we were we reasoned that if this um if this virus is infecting men with this immune

55:00.480 --> 55:06.800
Defect in causing prostate cancer that it might indeed be the culprit in um cfs

55:07.280 --> 55:09.760
What were your thoughts when you first started going down this road?

55:10.240 --> 55:14.080
Well, I knew that uh, the one thing that we had to do was look for

55:14.720 --> 55:19.920
The answers and I believed that all along we were going to find an underlying pathogen

55:20.000 --> 55:26.080
It just it didn't make sense that so many different viruses had been claimed to have caused this disorder

55:26.480 --> 55:31.360
So, you know, I I was absolutely thrilled. This is exactly what we started

55:31.600 --> 55:37.280
So so many different viruses had been claimed to have caused this so many different viruses

55:37.280 --> 55:42.800
I wonder what viruses she's talking about. Judy just said there were only two before this one

55:44.480 --> 55:50.320
Um before xm re there was only h t l v and aids, right? That's weird

55:51.120 --> 55:53.120
Hey

55:53.120 --> 55:56.240
Thank you very much, Pamela. That's some good good work right there

55:56.480 --> 56:00.880
You know, I I was absolutely thrilled. This is exactly what we started out to do

56:01.360 --> 56:07.440
One of the things that that has been so frustrating for sufferers from chronic fatigue fibromyalgia and other related illnesses

56:07.840 --> 56:12.960
Is that for a long time people thought that doctors thought that they were crazy that the symptoms that were coming up

56:13.280 --> 56:18.320
Um that the system I really feel like place they showing up in another place

56:18.720 --> 56:26.720
I really feel like that all of us should be incredibly skeptical when we see these kinds of historic videos and realize that this is long covid

56:28.720 --> 56:30.720
This this phenomenon

56:32.160 --> 56:38.800
Which he just said a lot of people would just say that you were crazy and the doctors didn't take seriously has existed for a long time

56:39.200 --> 56:41.200
or phenomenon like it

56:42.080 --> 56:48.720
Have existed for a long time and have bet we have been offered several different explanations over the generations

56:52.080 --> 56:57.840
And that fact in and of itself should be extraordinary. It's probably not a fact that very many college kids

56:58.560 --> 57:02.000
know because their knowledge of history is so fragmented

57:03.760 --> 57:07.920
And the biological history is very important here because it's objective history

57:07.920 --> 57:11.200
It's of history not of what people said and that's well it is a

57:12.320 --> 57:15.040
It's a history of what people said but about specific ideas

57:15.760 --> 57:17.440
And I think right now

57:17.440 --> 57:25.280
One of the advantages of gigo and biological and following gigo and biological regularly and maybe even supporting or sharing gigo and biological with your family and friends

57:25.600 --> 57:30.640
Is that we try as much as possible to stay focused on this stuff that can be objective

57:31.520 --> 57:34.320
Um, which is really the biology or the

57:34.960 --> 57:39.040
Immuno mythology that has been substituted for it

57:40.160 --> 57:44.960
And I think we're seeing it in real time in 2008. I think this is a person

57:45.440 --> 57:51.520
Who was participating in that ongoing bamboozlement the vaccine schedule

57:52.400 --> 57:57.360
And explaining away what it is and what it is and has been an ongoing problem

57:57.680 --> 58:00.080
And that's what you're going to hear very shortly

58:00.720 --> 58:06.320
It's been an ongoing problem and I think that judy mikovitz has been out there for a long time

58:06.960 --> 58:08.960
obfuscating that problem with

58:09.120 --> 58:11.120
stupid complicated explanations

58:12.400 --> 58:14.400
that could be simplified to

58:15.040 --> 58:20.720
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb not

58:21.360 --> 58:25.120
You know xm rv and latent viruses and all this other

58:25.760 --> 58:27.760
Absolute nonsense. I'm sure

58:28.720 --> 58:30.720
And and there was no way to track it

58:30.720 --> 58:32.800
It's it's really been very very interesting

58:32.800 --> 58:37.120
And um, the exciting thing is that judy can tell you that how the virus works

58:37.520 --> 58:41.040
And every one of the symptoms makes sense because of that

58:41.040 --> 58:48.000
So it's wonderful to be able to have this puzzle just all the pieces come together suddenly and fit so well

58:48.400 --> 58:52.960
Um, but I'm certainly she can she can speak to what i was going to say specifically, you know

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
Let's relate it to women

58:55.280 --> 58:57.520
A lot of the problems that women have suffered with this

58:58.160 --> 59:01.280
You have now been able to track down in an incredible detective work

59:01.840 --> 59:07.440
Right, uh correct. So, um, it's it's a simple retrovirus, which means it's it's expression

59:07.520 --> 59:12.320
The honor off is controlled by just in we've we've just learned this

59:12.400 --> 59:18.720
It's unpublished data by just three things the response to hormones and the response to

59:19.200 --> 59:24.240
Um inflammatory cytokines. It's called a nf kephobe element. So

59:25.200 --> 59:32.880
Cortisol, which is the stress hormone is it turns on the virus very rapidly and continues to have it expressed

59:33.280 --> 59:37.760
So do um inflammatory events like as caused by other pathogens

59:37.920 --> 59:41.280
And so do hormones like androgens in progesterone

59:41.280 --> 59:46.560
Which also makes sense with regard to prostate cancer and inflammatory prostate cancer

59:46.640 --> 59:49.280
And the disease being more prevalent in women

59:49.680 --> 59:51.680
um one of the things that uh

59:52.240 --> 59:58.960
Is common here is that that this is uh, not an airborne disease, which is something that people had potentially thought about

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.400
I mean, this is something that's all over the world. I mean, it's just stunning

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.600
But it's it's it's actually fluids and blood that are being that's correct. I think

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.720
It's all over the world. That sounds like something that's a background signal

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.800
It's been there all the time and now they're going to try and convince you that some background signal is significant

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.800
It's kind of the same play

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.600
And we're supposed to take Judy's word for it

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.200
It's kind of the same play. It's all over the world already

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:36.080
It's actually interesting. Maybe they they realized at some point in this little maneuver that the all over the world signal wasn't going to scare anybody

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.840
That a latent virus that's always been there in the background all the time isn't going to impress anyone

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.080
As an explanation for a phenomenon that they can't do anything about

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.520
And so I wonder if this is just you know

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.680
We're really dealing with a bunch of hamfisted half-wits

01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.200
Who because of the fact that they have easy access to weaponized piles of money feel under some obligation to govern us

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.360
But they're liars they're posers. They're actually not that smart and they use people like Judy who aren't

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.840
Aren't capable of covering up for that sort of hamfisted

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.000
uh

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.040
You know, it's that's all it is. I feel like there's a lot of incompetence that's behind this

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.760
I feel like that's why we're so off-script and that incompetence has actually been there for longer than we imagine

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.800
Because that's what it is right if you have hundreds of people that are unwittingly

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.840
Reinforcing a group of lies, which is a mythology, right?

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:46.240
And it's just a mythology about biology and they have been tricked unwittingly or wittingly into just playing along

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.520
You know, you could even look at it like it just to self-deprecate a little bit

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.680
You could even make it you could just use myself as an example. Maybe me spending my time on

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.680
Nicotinic

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.840
Acetylcholine channels in mice

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.840
was

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.320
a pretty good bet in terms of well, it's better that he spends his time on that than he spends his time on something else because

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.800
He's not likely to figure anything big out if he works on that stuff

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.280
And so there are lots of academic biologists that are working on exactly what they want to work on because they're interested in it because it's neat

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:31.440
Because irreducible complexity is everywhere because the sacred biology is everywhere if you only know how to look for it

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.360
And so all of these biologists are just happy to be able to look for it every day

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.520
To be allowed to see the details of it every day

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:49.360
Unwittingly they have wasted their cognitive energy focused on something that won't prevent the enslavement of their grandkids

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.360
They're not even aware that the enslavement of their grandkids is a goal of these people

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.040
And

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.560
That's why i'm so optimistic that we can wake up. There's still video like this

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.520
There's still a possibility to be able to show or everyone the historical step by step

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.480
Of how they got us to believe that virology was this high fidelity thing

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.720
They got us to believe that virology was very high fidelity by putting judy mikovits on television in 2008 really

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.520
I

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.520
The apprentice of rusketi who was the apprentice of kaprowski

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.080
Really?

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.720
I mean man just please don't make mark's work go to waste

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.160
Please spend some time looking at the material that he's putting together on these people

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:45.280
The connections that he's identifying between these people and the historical significance of the fact that robert melon traces some of his intellectual

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.280
inheritance back to muri gardener

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:59.200
Ladies and gentlemen there are going to be rats jumping out of this ship quickly now

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.920
And they're going to be pretending that they're not but they're screaming and screeching and running for the holes

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.240
Because this ship is going to sink fast now

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.600
Because we are close to a very collective understanding of oh my gosh. It's really that bad

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.680
And it's going to be easy if we're if we do it right for all of and I mean all of western

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:38.640
Civilization all the republics that are potentially savable for all of their populations to realize that they've been bamboozled collectively

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.560
Not just by america, but by all of their leaders. That's how the EU came into existence

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.640
And so one of the things that we need to connect in our rhetoric

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.280
More often is the idea that the EU is a product of the same

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.160
governing liars

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.040
That whatever's happening in america is up up a product of and whatever's happening in australia

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.480
New zealand in canada is a product of whatever's happening in the uk

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:11.760
These are all the same weaponized piles of money that are doing what they can

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:16.720
Depending on the context. They can't do the same things in america that they can do elsewhere in vice versa

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.520
And so that's why all of these stages in this lala palooza look very different and why people in australia

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.800
Can't always agree with me because they're watching a different stage. They were saying different songs

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.560
Therefore, they have a different experience a different group of bad guys

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.400
And a different group of fake scooby-doo actors

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
They didn't even see the show that we saw

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:49.280
And so from their perspective, they see america is different and europe is different and and so if we take that into account

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.600
This is the way to bring all those pictures together because we all share a history

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.600
and

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.920
That history is much more streamlined because of

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.280
The nature of media and social media when we get pre-social media

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.880
Things starts to become extremely streamlined and it becomes say when mark

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.640
finds a newspaper article from 1980

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:25.040
That is the culmination of not only the author but the typesetter and the editor and the editorial people and whatever and they chose to put that there

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360
It's not just some some

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.680
Ranting lunatic on on sub stack

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.160
Who can you know cut and paste things together and now voila we have some kind of thing

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:45.760
No, this is a newspaper article back when newspaper articles were difficult to get took some time and effort of multiple people

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.320
And

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.080
Once we start to analyze it from that historical perspective

01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:01.680
And we start to see these stories as they are and put them into the context of the immunomythology that was foisted upon us

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.800
Over the last four years. It becomes blatantly obvious

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560
What are you peeping about

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.680
I think my wife just came looking into that and and describing that

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:20.480
Only so that we can but but in the history of these other viruses. That's what they've you know discovered

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:28.160
It's not your point. Okay. Yes. This this has way more ramifications than just CFS and me

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:34.400
I mean, you know, we have been a very strong supporter of the autism community on this program and tried to cover that as much as possible

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:38.240
What effect might it have on the autism community with this research?

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.280
Well, and findings. I mean, it's beyond just research. I think you know, yeah, we've actually we're excited to it's it's not in the paper

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360
And it's not reported, but we've actually

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.480
Done some of those studies and we found this virus present in a number

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.360
Um in a significant number of autistic samples that we've tested so far

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.640
So there is tremendous potential for this to oh my god

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.760
Something that will be solvable for the autism community be linked to it to know a number of neuro immune diseases including autism

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.280
It certainly won't be all because there are you know genetic defects that result in autism, but they're all so

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.560
Oh, there are genetic defects that also result in autism. Is that so really? Oh wow

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.520
Interesting theory that I as a neurobiologist think is bullshit

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.600
Wow, I mean, we're just I mean, this is just a home run. This is it. This is the end

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.960
This is the time when the dam starts to break. This is it

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.760
All the pieces are here

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.000
T cell retroviruses really no shit

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:54.240
Maybe there are even B cell retroviruses. No shit really is that how light chain systemic amyloidosis works

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.800
from a B cell myeloma

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:04.640
I wonder if if kevin mccaren has ever explained what a B cell myeloma and systemic light chain amyloidosis is

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.160
Or is he just focused on the spike protein?

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.280
Ladies and gentlemen capital l capital a capital i capital r capital s liars

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.480
have been used against us

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.240
And have foisted upon us a mythology

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.720
That we have been governed by for decades and they are trying to invert our children's sovereignty

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.160
By doubling and tripling down on this mythology once and for all

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That's why robert malone has made no comment at all in four years about the veracity of

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.640
judy mikovitz's biology

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.480
That's why judy mikovitz hasn't made one comment about whether or not robert malone is to be trusted

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.600
Because muri gardener

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.400
And resketty and gallo

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.680
connect them

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320
Thanks mark

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:18.560
The environmental effects there is always, you know, we the hypothesis that my child was fine and then they got sick and then they got autism

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.440
Interestingly on that note if I might speculate a little bit on the vaccine this might even explain why vaccines

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.240
lead to autism and some children because

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.960
This these viruses

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:37.200
Live and divide and grow in this lymphocytes the immune response cells to be in the t-cells

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:45.760
Imagine the implication that the immune system is being hijacked by retroviruses. Oh my goodness

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.760
I'm sorry. It might take it might take a while for this to sink in

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560
But mark and I have been

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:04.240
Been talking behind the scenes about the idea that retroviruses are the way that the immune system regulates itself for at least two years

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.480
Maybe three mark and tell you when I first said it

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:19.680
Because he he inspired it in me because he was talking about packet communication and in in computers and and it just suddenly snapped in my head

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.680
Holy shit, that's what it is

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:30.960
Because the immune system can't possibly regulate different clonal populations of B cells and T cells with cytokines

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:47.120
There's no way to explain the patterns of T cell activation and T cell gene expression and T cell clonal activation and deactivation crescendo and de crescendo of inflammatory responses

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:55.680
With chemokines and cytokines that's not it's not it's not exhaustive at all. It doesn't even come close to explaining it

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.600
And I said it before I fully understood it the other day

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.960
But David Baltimore has been telling us this lie that all of this scheme of virology is outside of us that we don't do anything

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.720
But do DNA to RNA RNA through a ribosome we get proteins and that's us

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.240
But outside of us are all these much more complicated

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.680
Obligate molecular pathogens that have figured out all these different ways to use

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.600
All these different versions of genetic material that we never use

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:35.440
We would never use even in a little while or in a little example or in a little place or in a different system or for a particular case

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.920
You should understand yourself as DNA to RNA to ribosome to protein and this virology stuff is where

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.440
single-stranded DNA matters or double-stranded RNA can be copied or RNA can be

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.480
Can be replicated or that the the regulation of RNA can be done with

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.760
With copying it or to alter it or to splice it or no. Oh, none of this is us

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.680
This is all how RNA viruses work and retroviruses work

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.480
They

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.680
Take a cell that doesn't use retroviruses and make them make retroviruses

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:20.560
They take cells that don't have anything that resembles this and make them do it

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:31.840
And here is judy mikovitz in 2008 assuring you that she's tested autistic kids and found xmrv in them

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.120
Now I want you to ask yourself has chd ever interviewed judy mikovitz

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.440
Has chd and any of their employees ever dug down into this problem

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.200
dug down into what's happening or did they just give her a mic and let her go

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.680
Because health freedom, you know health freedom. We just want to get everybody a chance to talk

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.440
Even if they're full of shit like robert malone was on the beach

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.840
It's okay. It's just you know, it's the way that chd works

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.520
They've got these these satellite organization these chapters and they can't control the chapters

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:23.120
So the chapters can do whatever the hell they want to which means any useful work that done by brian hooker or any of these other heroes

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.680
Can be infinitely diluted by the stupid shit that any one of these chapters does

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:33.840
Not a whole lot you can do about it. And they failed to start a chdeu chapter

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:40.720
But they spent a lot of money wasted a lot of money trying to start a chdeu chapter

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.240
And of course I wouldn't be able to talk about any of this had I taken the

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.400
$8,000 non-disclosure agreement offer that they gave me when they ended my position in december of

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.800
2024. Thanks a lot guys of january 24. Thanks a lot for all the help mary

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:11.520
And I say mary holland because I know for sure that lisa bono is a good person at lisa bono should probably be the ceo of chd

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.200
And everything would be fine. She's the one who actually has skin in the game

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.600
Who actually got robert f kenney to jr to pay attention by sitting on his porch

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.520
mary holland just happens to be a former faculty member of columbia university

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.280
Really

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440
Really

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.360
And she gave up a columbia faculty position to become ceo and

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.840
Part advisor to chd just in time

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.160
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen. I don't buy it

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:56.560
I don't buy it at all. That's why mary holland is on robert melone's list of bad guys

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.680
That's why george web is on robert melone's list of bad guys

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.280
That's why sasha la to pova is on his list of bad guys

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.800
And in fact that was a while ago that she got promoted to that list

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.680
And

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:17.840
That's why robert melone was making a huge fake deal about how angry is that sasha la to pova on

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.600
steve gersh's podcast two days ago. It's all in elaborate

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.160
theater

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:30.720
And they've got more and more actors working off script because people like jessica hocket and nick hudson

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.240
And mark kulak and jonathan kui have been throwing wrenches into the machine

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.440
For three years and they're starting to have an effect

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.400
And now unfortunately the internet is coming back to bite him

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.960
Because the truth is actually still available probably by design

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:56.720
Because as i've said before the idea is to slow roll us to control the demolition of all of these western republics

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.560
And so if they're going to slow roll us to the truth they have to slow low it roll us to a lie

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:10.080
About how it's all our fault and about how it wasn't a coordinated 30 year 40 year effort of liars

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.800
That are interested in enslaving our grandkids which is actually what it is

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:22.560
And judy mikovitz plays for that team and has been playing for that team since 2008 wittingly or unwittingly she might not know it there

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.400
She might not know it at this time, but she's going to find out and she found out before the pandemic

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.640
I'm absolutely certain of it and my main indication is that she has no opposition

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.320
Nobody tells you that judy mikovitz is full of bull. No one does. Robert Malone

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.320
hat phil

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320
meryl nass

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.480
anyone

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360
The answer is no

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Because she's old school

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:07.680
So when you give a vaccine you you you send your b&t cells in your immune system into overdrive

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.960
That's its job. Well, if you're harboring one virus and you replicated a whole bunch

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.440
You've now broken the the balance between the immune response and the virus

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:24.480
So you could have had the underlying virus and then amplified it with that vaccine and then set off the disease

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.440
So essentially she's forgiving the vaccine for having not known that a virus was there

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.000
If we would have known that the virus was there

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.560
She's almost arguing for a vaccine against xmorv so that they get rid of that first. Maybe we should give a

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.360
Mark, maybe we should give a vaccine to babies to get rid of the xmorv so that they don't have it

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.600
So then the vaccine schedule will be safer

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:54.160
We could give like a pre vaccine vaccine that would get everybody safer for the oh my gosh. I can see it now

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.200
It's awesome

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.480
Your immune system could no longer control other infections and created an immune deficiency

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.440
Wow

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.200
She's so excited and happy

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.480
She was able to succinctly explain the causes of autism and AIDS all in the same paragraph

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.520
I think we should roll it back and listen to it again. It was so good

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.480
If I might speculate a little bit um the vaccine this might even explain why vaccines um

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:29.360
lead to autism and some children because um this these viruses um live and divide and grow in

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.760
This lymphocytes the immune response cells the B and the T cells

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:40.960
So when you give a vaccine you you you send your B and T cells in your immune system into overdrive

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.160
That's its job

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.240
Well, if you're harboring one virus and you replicate it a whole bunch

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.720
You've now broken the the balance between the immune response and the virus

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.600
So you could have had the underlying virus and then

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.760
Amplified it with that vaccine and then set off the disease such that your immune system could no longer control other infections and

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:06.880
Created an immune deficiency. Let's take a break more on this very exciting discovery when we come back

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.800
Very exciting discovery and the two guys who kind of plotted into question just happened to be dead. Oh

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440
Mm-hmm

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.920

So it's Sam shan

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:09.440
And back on the vada newsmakers on a great day here with with a net with a more president and founder of the would a more peterson institute

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.360
And judy mikevitz who is the director of research for wpi you wanted to clear up something about vaccines

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.120
Well, I just wanted to say that you're certainly are advocating

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:24.240
Vaccinations and understand how important those are to the well-being of the children

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.640
but um

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.520
With a net with a more president and founder of the would a more peterson institute and judy mikevitz who is the director of research for wpi

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.760
You wanted to clear up something about vaccines

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:44.640
Well, I just wanted to say that we certainly are advocating vaccinations and understand how important those are to the well-being of of the children

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:51.120
But um, what we're hoping for is by finding out whether or not somebody is positive to xm rv

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:56.640
Whether it's one family member or another brian hooker is the reason chd exists

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.520
I've become convinced of the fact that brian hooker is under the control or under the

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.840
Under the auspices of chd because that's all they can do

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.800
If you're going to buy a book from chd and you're not going to buy the wuhan cover up

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.680
Just so you can send it to me and have me autograph it then I suggest you buy this book

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.280
This book

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.640
This is the book you should buy backs unbacks let the science speak

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.600
It's not an exhaustive book, but there's an awful lot in here

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.400
And if you ignore robert f Kennedy jr

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:52.320
And ignore del big tree than what you're essentially doing is buying a book by brian hooker who has

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.080
Um

01:22:54.080 --> 01:23:00.480
The ultimate skin in the game and I think is the reason probably why chd was formed in the first place besides

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:07.040
hulora bono's great courage and all of the moms and dads that are involved in the movie vaxx

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.680
Um, the reason why

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:16.480
Is because of brian hooker because he was the only one who had the courage and the guts and the drive to drive all the way

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.880
Across the united states and meet with that guy

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.280
From the cdc and actually get him to confess and give him the data

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:29.040
Which showed that the cdc was hiding especially in effect in the young black children

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:36.160
And this book is a descendant of that that crusade and it is a a best

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.240
culmination or

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.600
Compilation excuse me of of papers that show

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.840
That that vaccines are ineffective and that vaccines actually hurt

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.600
children

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.200
um regularly

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.480
So this is the book that chd should be selling only this book

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.640
Um, and yet somehow or another chd is also selling this book

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:07.360
Which I think is a great big shitty lie and also selling this book

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.080
Which I think is a really large collection of lies

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.200
Um interspersed with some real biology that I was able to get in

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.960
I'm not saying robert f kennedy jr. Is a liar

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.280
I'm saying that robert f kennedy jr wrote a book

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.040
Based on the fact that he thinks a lot of the people in this book are genuinely not liars

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480
Brett Weinstein

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.200
Jeffrey sachs

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.960
Richard e bright uh tony fauci

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.200
Peter desak and ralph barrack are all in this book and from bobby's perspective

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.360
He can't see yet what I am trying to teach on this

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
on this stream

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.040
But I've tried to show it to him and I think he understands that it's at least a possibility

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.560
But this is a historic document to show you what these people lied about and what exactly they said

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560
And so I think it's a very useful document

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.880
um

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.920
And I am very proud of the contributions that I made to it

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.160
Even the fact that in that book is codified the trick

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.280
The trick that I got played on me

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.000
Um, we can talk about that later. I don't want to use too much time on this in this stream to

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.600
To talk about that book

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.800
We should do a stream sometime about that book because we can cover every part of the thing that I put in that book

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.920
Um, and then we can also say what I think um

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.280
What the main

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:44.080
Not mistake, but the main thing that they wanted to use me to do was to reinforce the idea that diffuse was something real

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.440
Um, and I did not do that, but I kind of did it

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.880
And they still had a quote from me that I couldn't deny and I couldn't really ask him to take out

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.960
I guess I could have

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.320
Um, where I said that a lot of other scientific grants are done before they're submitted

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.160
And so it wouldn't be crazy

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:07.360
If a grant from a virology lab, um, would have data in it that was already completed

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.640
Or experiments in it that were already completed and so he and other people like charles rixie and andrew huff

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.120
Have used that idea

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.840
Um, whether they got it from me or not. I don't care

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.920
Use that idea and and really gone and run with it with the the idea that in academic biology

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.440
Um

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.760
Like where I was working at the university of pittsburgh many of those neurobiologists will have

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:33.680
Let's say

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.560
All of their experiments will have pilot data

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:43.520
And then they'll show that pilot data in their grant proposal so that the grant committee understands that the experiments already can

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.560
Work and the data is already gatherable

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.960
And the methodology is already work and so under that pretense it would be possible

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.600
For someone to make the all that's awesome

01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.440
It's perfect. Thank you very much the disingenuous argument that

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.440
Um

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.680
That these the diffuse proposal represents experiments already done. However, I would argue that

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.760
um, any

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.080
grant proposal in the context of biosecurity or in the context of

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.080
Of of DARPA or or other government

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:28.320
Defense programs that those experiments are much less likely to be held to the same kind of scrutiny

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.960
With regard to preliminary data and again

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:38.080
How can I make that argument because in a grant proposal when you have preliminary data it would be there

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.160
You see the one thing that they left out of the argument

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.720
And it's in the book you can read it in the book

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.720
But but people like handrew huff and charles rixie who try to use this argument as though it makes sense to them

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.920
And they understand it because you know, they've never been in academics

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.560
Well, handrew andrew huff has been in academia for a little while so he might understand that a lot of times grants are

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.160
Semi-completed the experiments proposed are semi-completed so that you can show preliminary data

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.680
But the funny part is and this is where you can see right through it

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:17.200
And why my contributions to this book are actually very good still is because when I explain that

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.440
When I explain that a lot of times when grants are

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.840
Submitted the data can already be done or some of it can already be done or the experiments can be ongoing

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.320
I explained that the reason why is because that preliminary data is necessary for the grant to be approved

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.880
But if there's no preliminary data in the diffuse proposal

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.960
Then why make the argument that the experiments have already been done

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:50.560
It would have created more likelihood that their experiments would be granted and funded had they shown

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.160
preliminary data

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.760
And since the diffuse proposal has no preliminary data then the argument that it's probably already been done

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.360
Is actually a pretty stupid argument because if they had any preliminary data that could show

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:09.360
That some of their experiments proposed were already being done

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.600
Then it would have been more likely for them to get that that proposal funded

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.880
But instead that proposal was not ever going to be funded that proposal was created

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.480
With the intention of getting this back on script

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.920
To make sure that there would be even more wood on the fire

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.480
Of the scooby-doo mystery

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.680
And that is why charles rixie came to my house

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:36.800
Because we had to do a show and he had to come and convince me in person

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.120
That the diffuse proposal was not to be discarded as as as a

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.800
Ruse

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:50.240
But to be taken very seriously because he's a marine and a marine gave it to him or something like that

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:56.320
Ladies and gentlemen, the illusion is breaking and it's breaking because of marks

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.800
historical work

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:06.000
Because of our biological work and because how the history of this biology is where the truth is to be found

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.960
It's a

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.680
unfortunate synergy for the people who don't like us

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.680
And then looking forward in children

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:22.240
You could all alter the immune response in such a way or protect the child and still be able to vaccinate and avoid

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:28.720
Autism in these kids. So and again, I don't think that either one of us are sitting here and saying vaccination causes

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.240
Autism rather a number of factors a genetic susceptibility to the illness

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:42.400
The infection itself and then on top of that you're adding something to that mix that that takes that child

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.760
mod R&A

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.240
I would suggest to you that I'm gonna keep this paranoid stuff up forever now

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:54.160
This is where I am because this is the truth if you don't like it start a podcast. I'd be happy to watch it

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.160
I better be hilarious

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:01.600
Just to make sure you know that I don't block people in the chat. I I watch all the

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.720
All the stuff go by including your silly stuff

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.720
Have fun

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.480
over the top, you know

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.640
one of the things that's interesting to me is that

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.240
You know, we're not very far away from actually being able to resolve a lot of the problems for these people

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.240
I mean we've seen with HIV AIDS

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.680
That it has not been put under control for many many people

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.040
And are we looking for the same thing for not just ME and CFS but for many other diseases as well?

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:33.680
Yeah, absolutely. So we as you said, we've got a lot of experience in drug development and these retrovirus is

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:39.680
Work the same so we have drugs that are already FDA approved on the market that we can now begin

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:48.000
Rational clinical trials and and actually treat and and come close to the proving causality when when we do indeed

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.800
Have people be coming close to proving causality coming close

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.640
But you know because it's a null hypothesis and you're going to always falsify it

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.880
Then you're never I actually get there right because papari and science doesn't ever get there. This is amazing

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.840
Better my heel so actually we are working on on treatments right now

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:15.040
And I think one of the biggest things that that we feel is very very important is that we continue this work on this pace

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.840
To solve this problem as quickly as possible

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.440
And that's going to require some funding and we're really hoping and we're working very hard right now with the NIH

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.760
To accommodate those needs and and get some fun. Yes, Jason

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.760
It does it does it does

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.480
Right with robber Malone's repurpose drugs nonsense clinical trials. Nice catch. I know that this was embargoed until today

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:41.120
By science magazine, but but what has been the result of the medical community?

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.760
I will let Judy answer that one because it's been phenomenal the scientific community has just been

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.880
They're just great data three times twice it

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.000
Close conferences at the end. Sorry what presented these data three times twice it

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.560
Close conferences. I think I think mark has nailed it. I think mark has nailed it

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:05.040
I think that this was a a plan

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:10.880
This was the first attempt. Maybe maybe the other one the the the the

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.600
The html v was the first attempt to try and and start to

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:24.320
Move forward with an explanation that involved viruses for more things and uh covering up whatever this

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.040
Um, me csf is

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:37.120
It's really extraordinary ladies and gentlemen. I don't think that uh, there's anything else to do just but keep working because this is a absolute slam dunk

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.640
Because again mikovitz rusketti

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.160
Hillary kaprowski muri gardener

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.120
Robert Malone

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.160
leaderberg

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.200
Prusner david baltimore

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.520
These these are all people that knew each other and existed at the same time and have

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.800
Have been in these back room meetings and presentations about these ideas

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.600
And if they didn't understand then they definitely understand now that we are being governed by this mythology

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.960
And I believe that all of these people are involved in a decades-long

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:19.440
sustaining

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.280
effort a a theater a theatrical effort

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:32.000
Designed to bamboozle non-government organizations and government organizations alike the entire populace of the world has been bamboozled by a

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.560
A few handfuls of of scientists

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:41.520
And a surprising number of them are americans. I mean i'm there's no doubt

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:50.240
Um, but these are these are scientists who are aligned to powers that are not american aligned to powers

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.240
That are super american or outside of america or who would like to bring down america

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.600
Maybe rockafeller

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.880
After they split up standard oil, I think rockafeller said he was going to bankrupt america of as the last thing he did

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.800
Rockafeller is also supposedly responsible for the modern medicine as we as it stands because he

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.920
He perpetuated the idea of pharmaceuticals and pushed them into into the medical schools

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.000
Isn't that the history that we're supposed to believe?

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:22.080
Well, then it seems very clear to me that maybe some of that is big truth

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:30.880
Weaponized piles of money have been orchestrating a controlled demolition of america since 100 years ago

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.560
Well, now it's making a lot of sense why fractional reserve banking is something that none of these people talk about

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:44.000
I'm the only biologist in the whole world who can say fractional reserve banking out loud and and and and be okay with it

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.680
And wanted an international meeting a few weeks ago and

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.680
You could hear a pin drop in the audience. It's amazement. The scientists are excited

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.640
Everyone's working on it. So we know we're going to get a lot a lot of help

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.320
But um, it's just amazement. It's it's an entire new field of men

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.360
I think she's bamboozled. I think she actually believes that it's possible she might get a Nobel prize for this

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.240
Um

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.560
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I I have the feeling that that is possible

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:21.600
Because I know what it feels like to think that you've discovered something new

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.240
I know what it feels like when other people tell you that holy cow this idea is wonderful

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:32.880
I felt it for just a little while while I was a neuro biologist in Norway because

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:39.840
The data that I was gathering in this one type of cell in this one location in the brain

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.800
was exclusively inhibitory

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:50.480
And in my imagination and exclusively inhibit inhibitory micro circuit could do something that a heterogeneous

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.880
Excitatory inhibitory micro circuit has a lot harder time doing

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Because you have to balance the activation with the inhibition and that

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.120
Balance is needs to be very precise or certain certain patterns are not

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.840
Are not just going to spontaneously show up

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:15.760
But if you just wire everyone to everyone via inhibition then certain patterns are very easy to evolve

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.240
And

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.240
I had thought that

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:28.080
Inhibition was more important than excitation in the brain since I started in neurobiology because the the

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:31.600
The brain to me as a child

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.400
And I know this is going to sound crazy, but it's an idea that I've had since a child

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.320
The brain seemed to me more like an electric engine than a

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.080
Then a engine that needed fuel

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.280
The brain felt very much like to me whether it was on or whether the brakes were on

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.920
And so when I woke up in the morning, I felt like I was on maximum

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.240
And so for me

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.240
As I grew older

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:05.520
What that translated it into was that it really makes sense to me if I and when I got older I started to understand electric engines and

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.160
and and

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.280
Internal combustion engines and steam engines and all this stuff

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.600
And it started to dawn on me that electric engines might be how the brain works in other words

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.400
The throttle is always on full blast and then you use the brake to control

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:29.200
And so now imagine that the throttle of your brain is the gate when you're awake

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.640
And now you get all this sensory input that you can't possibly keep track of you can't possibly

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.120
Process all the sound all the proprioception all the

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.720
the

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.480
visual information all the taste information and all the old factory information that's present at once it's not possible

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.160
And so you need to have brakes in the system that put the brakes on

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.720
Things that you're not paying attention to and let the brake off when you want that information

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.840
And that made a lot more sense to me as a high schooler

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:06.320
Than the idea of thinking that neurons were turning each other on and then it was just a question of whether one was connected to the other

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.720
That didn't make any sense because then that meant that every connection had to be built

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:15.840
And then I got more sophisticated in neurobiology and I found out wait

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.840
They've already known that more connections than are necessary are present in the brain

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.320
And then they get pruned over childhood

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.080
And so then my brain even what my understanding was like oh wait

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.720
That totally jives because you would prune the connections that you don't use

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.080
And so then you would be left with the connections and control them by brake

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:42.800
And so then I got all the way out of high school and into biology and and thought I was going to be a doctor

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.160
And then it took another 15 years before I met a mentor that could say to me hey

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.600
You know

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.800
What is your idea about inhibition again? Tell me why that's cool

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.320
And then I said it and I explained this whole story and then he said I can make a model of that

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.440
And he made a model and it went in my paper and people were telling me oh my gosh, dude

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.520
You've really done something really special here

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.160
And then they started saying more and more often that actually the modeler

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.480
Had done something very special here and jays data

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.480
Supported the model

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.960
And then I started to realize that my my idea

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.840
was going to be taken from me

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.440
because I was an experimentalist and

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:41.520
And the model is what people cared about apparently the mathematical model that recapitulated the experimental data that I predicted I would get in got

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.040
Was now

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:51.280
essentially just edifying a model and the model was being credited with the idea and in fact

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.240
the Iranian

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.960
Modeler

01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:59.280
Who made the model in my paper

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.360
Was on the front of science magazine a year later

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.440
As one of the top rising stars of neurobiology

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.840
But he was essentially on there because he was allowed to make a model based on my idea and my

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360
experimental data

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.040
And so bear for a very brief period of time. I thought I was about to be a baller

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.880
I was going to become somebody that everybody's whose name they knew and instead that's not what happened at all

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360
Instead a Chinese guy

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.160
Took shared first authorship because he made a virus that I don't think he made

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:40.000
I think he just bought and he went later back to the to China and started stealing ideas like the

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:43.360
Magneto protein that I've told you the story about before

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.240
The mozers went on to win the Nobel Prize a year and a half later

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:52.880
Edward and and maverick are awesome scientists

01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.520
The guy that I worked with in Norway mental witter is an awesome scientist

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.160
But the nature of the way these things work is that if you make a model

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:12.960
Um, then for some reason or another that's that's your idea and that's your thing and and you become very special for it

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.640
Um, I had that idea in my head since I was a high schooler

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.640
And it came to fruition when I was 32 years old in Norway

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.880
31

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.920
And uh, it became the the idea of Yasser Rudy

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.320
And Yasser Rudy was put on the front cover of science. Um for that idea

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:43.280
An idea again. I I humbly submit that was in my head since high school. Basically. I just didn't know

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.160
That it would eventually come to be experimentally tested by patch clamp physiology

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.720
um by my own hands

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.440
Listen and everyone who's ever worked in this family of irises now that we shown it's a human and pathogen

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.560
And it's not to be sorry. Do not be sorry, daniel

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.760
That's not why I tell that story. What I tell that story for is for you to understand how academic biology works

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.040
I still succeeded

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:12.000
I got to go back to the netherlands with my wife and try to set up a lab there and I failed

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.840
In the netherlands for other reasons

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.160
I was trying to move on from that really good idea in Norway and because

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.920
That really good idea was a very small part of that nobel prize

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.280
Um

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.720
Catalog of work a very tiny part almost like a cherry on top of the cherry, you know, like oh, yeah

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:32.720
And by the way, there's this little detail

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.200
And it was a little detail that actually got my name

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.680
On the screen behind

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:43.280
Uh, edward mozer when he was accepting the nobel prize in 2014, which is pretty badass

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:48.720
To get a text from a friend who's sitting in the audience in Oslo and he says dude

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.200
Your name is on screen right now. Holy shit

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.520
That was the highlight of my scientific career

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320
And I can't thank edward enough

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:05.520
For allowing me to be that tiny little handmaid Brit for being that tiny little part in their wonderful story

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.280
Um

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:12.720
But I want you to understand how academia works because that was their idea and that it started from their idea

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.720
I could have never

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.080
Put a frame

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.560
On my idea without their discovery that they got the nobel prize for the grid cell

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.200
And when that idea clicked into my head when I was still working in Oslo for for Johan storm

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.440
That idea was still

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.480
Take ownership of it like it's mine. It's like oh my gosh. I can build on that. That's I know

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.720
I look look look look look look look and everybody got excited about it

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.960
I was totally fine because it's not our ideas

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:43.520
When you play a great riff on the guitar

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.560
You can't take credit for that if you've been listening to joe satryani and and steve

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.920
Vi and and and miles davis and and and and all these musicians your whole life

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.600
And then some brilliant riff comes out. You can't blame that on yourself

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.160
And once some great riff like um

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.440
Like uh, however you explain creation

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.440
There is a reverence. I believe all thinking humans should naturally develop

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.240
And if they don't it's because they were prevented from it. I haven't come to these good ideas on my own

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.720
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.680
His words that are inspired by my friend erin and my friend jackie and my friend rita and my friend brian hooker

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:35.920
Who even though I don't have as much contact as I would like to I am absolutely certain to the bottom of my bones

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.120
That these are really courageous people fighting for the truth

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.960
fighting for our kids and yours and our grandchildren

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.440
But there are medlers ladies and gentlemen everywhere because we are governed by liars

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.280
And the lies they agree to tell us

01:45:54.480 --> 01:46:01.040
And it goes back decades and once we acknowledge that it's just it's it's like taking candy from a baby

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.560
We're going to be done very quick. The threshold is going to be reached and the dam will break

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.680
Extremely excited you know you started this

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.200
Investigation because of your daughter and her lengthy

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.160
illness with cfs

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.040
What's your response now and what's her response? Oh

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:27.760
We are just absolutely overwhelmed. We are so excited to be able to put a name

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.240
to the

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.280
I don't you know path of their chin that's really been causing your problems

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.560
But there's always that little bit of sadness now, you know where you've held on for a really really long time and said

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.640
You know we're going to do this. We're going to do it and every once in a while we stop and and

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:47.440
We're a little bit sad for the lost health and on all the lost years

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.800
And then we just go right back out there and you know, I'm just I'm looking forward to all the new

01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:00.000
Treatment options that are going to be available and we're actually we've already talked to a large group of scientists about possible vaccine

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.320
Judy has mentioned

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:08.080
To me several times that this is going to be it's really a vaccine to prevent autism then right because if xmorv

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:14.000
Is a dormant virus that gets kicked into full gear by a vaccination then if we could get rid of

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:21.200
We could get rid of xmorv first then actually we would make the whole vaccine schedule better

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:26.320
Judy mikovitz is on the verge of being a worldwide

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.400
Hero a Nobel Prize winning discovery

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:39.920
You see that right here to find a vaccination against this then hiv because it is a simple retrovirus

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.880
So yes, and that that is the amazing thing unbelievable

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:50.320
There obviously going to be a lot of people who have a lot of questions about this and this broadcast is going to be seen around the world literally online

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.440
Where do people come to find the information?

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:59.120
Well, we hope they'll come to our website and visit us at www.wpinstitute.org

01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:02.560
We've put up a lot of information about xmorv

01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:05.200
questions and answers and

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.400
We're hoping to do a what is it called when they post

01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.280
You know, so they can post their questions and they can post their comments a board of some sort so

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.760
Right online and certainly you'll probably get quite a bit of feedback

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.560
Yes, and we'll put a link to your website on our website

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.280
I even though we've discussed how earth shattering this is

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.040
I don't think people are going to understand

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.640
But over the next few months as this rolls out and I just can't say

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.920
You know how excited I am for you and I also have a family member that suffers from fibromyalgia

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.560
We should speak to that just very quickly that fibromyalgia we include that in this group

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.720
We did bring in some samples and they tested positive as well. So there's a lot of folks out there that are going to find

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.960
That there's a reason for their symptoms. There is an answer and there are going to be some treatments that are going to make a difference

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:59.120
Huge promises to me. It is just one of your buildings finished yet. I know you know, it was really funny about a year ago

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.200
I told you to look at you

01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.480
I said okay agenda items. What are we going to do?

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.840
We're going to find the underlying cause of this disorder

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.360
Developed treatments and we're going to have a vaccine

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.680
I said, well, do you think you can do that before the doors are open and then you know we can figure out

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.160
what we're going to do in that space, but um, yeah, I I am just absolutely thrilled and I do believe

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:28.000
Imagine if a national security operation chose you to be the forward facing

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:30.320
element

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:37.520
Of an operation to convince people that there was a solution for the imperfect vaccine schedule

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.920
And that you were told in a private meeting that if you just could get the public to buy this story

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:51.600
You will be a part of this governing structure for the rest of your career and take an illustrious position amongst us

01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.480
This is 2008 ladies and gentlemen, this is not that long ago

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.680
But if you think of this as a multi-generational war and certainly an operation

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:11.840
That was designed to preserve the integrity of the vaccine schedule and that the vaccine schedule has existed for a lot longer than the pandemic

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.840
Then you see why

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.400
CHD's history is worth looking at

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.520
You can see why I can's history is worth looking at you can see why the history of

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:31.840
Judy mikovitz is worth looking at and you can see why none of these people ever talk about each other in any way really

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:41.200
Because this operation started before the pandemic the pandemic is supposed to be again the public view

01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.000
The skilled tv watcher event

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:50.080
But the critical thinker

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:58.080
Armed with historical knowledge realizes that the covid pandemic was just an absolute

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.640
seamless continuation

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.280
maybe a crescendo

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:11.600
Of the narration and narrative that was already being foisted upon us in a continuous basis with a continuous stream of

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.840
characters

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.240
Since at least

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:20.320
The year 2000 maybe more probably much more if you look at

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:27.040
Mark's website and believe any of those things are real any of those historical documents are real which i'm sure they are

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:36.160
I'm just trying to bait you into realizing that mark has hours and hours and hours of reading for you to do even if you just skim it

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.760
Hours and hours of

01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.640
newspaper articles which show the direct

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.760
intellectual descendants

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:48.960
Of these core medlers

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:54.000
Baltimore gallo gardener etc

01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.440
Kaprowski

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:03.200
And and and stanley plotkin and leader berg

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.880
very big players

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:11.920
And so ladies and gentlemen, I think we're really close to a dam break here

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.440
And so we've got to keep the pressure steady

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:17.520
I'm going to keep playing this video, but I am going to try and get done with it in a little bit too

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.920
So it's not too long. It's already 151 g

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.480
That we are going to move very rapidly on this

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.320
And we look forward to you coming back and telling us more about the progress

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.440
Oh, okay. We've done right now about a news make is after this time out

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.640
Let me see what else comes up

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.440
So

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:39.200
Nevada newsmakers, okay, so we don't need to do that. That's great. So thanks very much

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.520
For joining me today. I didn't expect it to end right there. I apologize for that

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.640
Um, I do think that it's worthwhile for me to go through this really quick

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:53.760
I know some people get tired of it, but I do think that they have uh and dis

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.840
Discapacitated no de-capacitated our ability to exercise informed consent

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.840
You can't say no if you don't understand

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:07.040
And we've had a lack of understanding since before the pandemic and that wasn't really

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:11.120
As obvious to me as it is right now

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:17.920
Ever before um as some of you may know, I only really pulled started to pull my head out in 2022

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.480
And so I've got a lot of regrets

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:27.040
Um, I've lost people to this lie and probably helped them to

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.760
accept the coercive

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.840
Transfection because I was saying lab leak where I shouldn't have been

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.440
Um

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:41.360
They did this because there is an organized and intelligent manipulation of our conscious thoughts

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.240
And it is done by liars on the internet

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:47.840
Who agree to coordinatively lie about certain things

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:53.440
And at the beginning of the pandemic they coordinatedly lied about the existence of a novel virus

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:57.520
And then coordinatedly lied about how the illusion was created

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:02.080
The illusion was created by mass casualty events in

01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:08.960
Uh, new york city in italy and in elsewhere and these mass casualty events in combination with testing

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.400
Were misconstrued as the start of a multi-year biological disaster

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:23.360
And that multi-year biological disaster as a worst case scenario was fueled by many different stages

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:30.640
On the internet many different points of view all of which were coordinatedly lying about the

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.040
potential for this novel virus to cause billions of people to die

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And they are lying

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.960
Coordinatedly about the role that fear that the role that do not resuscitate orders

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:50.880
That pulse oximeters and high flow oxygen that ventilation that lack of antibiotic use or the poor use of steroids

01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.040
Remdesivir, medazalam, etc

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.320
Opioid deaths that were escalating from

01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:04.160
2019 onward with the intention of having more excess deaths to misconstrue as this problem

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:10.160
This pre-ordained death certificate fraud this pre-ordained financial incentives

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.280
Which made it impossible for the numbers to be correct

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:16.960
The track and trace that made it impossible for the numbers to be correct

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:23.200
And of course the PCR fraud the lateral flow test fraud and the likely sequencing fraud all of which

01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:25.200
contributes to

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.400
Illusion of a novel virus and all of which is ignored by these performers

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:34.020
Including the no-virus people who have ignored

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:40.400
assembling this list for four years and especially in the context of debating anyone

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.640
Whenever they want to discuss with someone not on their team

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:48.640
They will exclusively only talk about the terms isolation

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.200
purification

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:53.200
and culture

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.720
When it would be very easy to dunk on all of us and say hey

01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.440
Not only is isolation purification and culture all things that they lie about

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.600
But in order to preserve that lie they murdered people in america and in Italy

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:11.600
How succinct is that why do I need to write a sub stack what I can say it in two sentences

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.160
So I'm going to say it in two sentences again

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.640
I think that some of these people in the green circles

01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:22.480
Are involved in ob-boost gating the show

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.840
Ob-boost gating the fact that we could have been here in 2020

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:33.920
If we were to listen to people like Knut with koski mike eden or or wolf gang wodar

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:39.200
But instead we listen to people and continue to listen to people like jessica rose

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.760
He'll uh harvey rice

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:43.600
Bret Weinstein

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:53.760
Meryl nass and and and robert malone all of whom have been coordinating their actions and coordinating their messaging since at least 2020

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.480
if not before

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.800
And the worst part is is that they invite nick hudson and they invite

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.720
Denny rancor to some remote location like romania

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.600
Pretend that there are everybody's listening and pretend that they're going to get their message out

01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:17.600
And then they come back to the united states and they mislead the young people in the world about what these people said

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:25.360
And in the case of nick hudson, they just don't even tell young people that nick hudson exists and that he had something to say about no pandemic

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.760
And they ignore the part that denny rancor says about what the pandemic data in the united states looks like

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:38.720
Even though they purport to be fighting for america because they were invited to speak in front of the senate to try and bring truth

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:45.680
But the truth that they brought contained nothing to do with the message that nick hudson brought to that meeting in romania

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.720
And nothing to do with the message that that that denny rancor brought to that

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:59.360
Meeting in romania and instead they brought other people from that meeting in romania to the senate in the united states and it was robert malone who did it

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.640
robert malone is the one who made this list

01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:08.960
Because he's got senator ron johnson's ear for whatever reason

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.000
And no matter how many times i tell them and the staff that that's not a good idea

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.520
It's going to keep going like this because this is a show

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:27.440
There are few things more dishonorable than misleading the young ladies and gentlemen and they are trying to trick us into teaching our children this bullshit

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:34.320
This bullshit about how it was a combination of a botched response and a novel virus and

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:40.080
Vulnerabilities that are different across races and and different batches that can explain this

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.720
But basically transfection will work in the future and it's fine for us to keep going

01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:50.160
And r&a can cause a pandemic and it's doing it all the time

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:53.440
And it's a lie

01:58:53.440 --> 01:59:00.000
And they're all sophisticated enough to know it robert malone was sophisticated enough to know it jessica rose is sophisticated enough to know it

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.160
jessica rose is only first off their papers our virology papers give me a break

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:08.640
They all know the limitations of r&a virology

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:15.600
There's no way that robert malone cut his teeth with muri gardener and doesn't know that there's a lot of lies being told about retroviruses

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:18.720
as being exclusively exogenous

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:25.280
Obligate molecular pathogens outside of us instead of a echo of something that exists

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:28.960
inside of us as part of our own biology

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:37.200
And all of these people are coordinatively lying about the significance of this list as if it's well it could account for some stuff

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:39.680
Stuff was made worse

01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:43.600
But there was still a novel virus there's still long covid

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.840
steve kirsch

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.280
robert malone

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:48.640
jessica rose

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:50.800
brett wine steve

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:58.000
maryll nass novel virus long covid the whole nine yards even though we just watched judy mikovitz talk about

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:04.320
chronic fatigue syndrome and all these other things that have seemingly just disappeared now because there's long covid

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.320
Think about how biologically disingenuous it is for these people to behave like they behave

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.600
There's no other way to think about why these books were written and who published them

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:20.480
There's no other way to think about this deception

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.160
Just read it

02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.400
Just read these words they ceded to gain a function narrative with scientific programs and peer-reviewed publications for years

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.640
All the publications of eco-health alliance funded by usaid are gray

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:45.360
Smoke screens they don't actually show any gain of function. They don't show anything

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:49.600
Other than they have the molecular techniques to make these sequences. That's it

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.960
And they can grow cell cultures, I guess

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.520
And they ceded mash casualty events with complications expected for

02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:04.320
Transfection so that when they transfected us we would confound it with whatever happened with the virus with the spike protein

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.320
And that's what kevin mccairne

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:10.800
And flemming and and all of these people did wittingly or unwittingly

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.560
And the reason why they are so committed to these lies is because it's a national security operation

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.640
It is part of an ongoing controlled devolution of america that's supposed to cover up the

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.760
the the failing fractional reserve banking system and in the inevitable

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:36.160
um downcycling of a fiat currency like the dollar

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:45.600
And the chaos is being combined with confusion so that they can reorganize our national sovereignty system

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.320
Into a global prison

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:54.240
They are slavers ladies and gentlemen and they want to enslave our children and our grandchildren

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.480
And they're going to do it with lies lies that were implanted in our brains

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.280
Many many many many many years ago

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.840
And most of us are still very naive to it ladies and gentlemen. This is the thesis

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:12.800
The nia funded infectious clone may or may not have been used because an rna cannot pandemic

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.480
So if they really wanted

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:17.920
Biologists to believe it they would have had to put the signal there and lie about it

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:24.640
And people like robert malone are exactly the kind of people that I think are capable of lying about such an operation

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.640
I think

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:34.560
Pierre cori and and and and peter mccala and all of these these front line kind of doctors

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.480
All exhibit the behavior of people who are aware that they are part of a theater like this

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.320
And especially when they talk to me in person

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:51.760
Ladies and gentlemen, this has given giga home biological a high resistance low noise information brief brought to you a biobiologist

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:54.160
I hope you guys are okay with that show

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:00.800
If you want to share it, please do you can find it on rumble peer tube youtube and twitch

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:05.680
And you can also find all those links that get going biological.com where you can also

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:08.400
find lots of different ways to

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:12.000
Support the stream with a one-time donation or a monthly donation

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.360
Anything you can provide would be greatly appreciated because

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:17.760
Unlike steve courches

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:24.880
Vaccine safety research foundation that is getting money from the places like the skull foundation, which also supports pbs

02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:26.320
NewsHour

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.960
This show is only supported by people like you

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:36.480
It's it's really actually that steve courches organization is not like that the flcc pays

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:41.040
Pierre cori $230,000 a year as part of their work

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.640
The guy who's got a ivermectin book

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:50.400
Sure, he needs $230,000 a year as an extra salary from the flcc

02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:55.600
Because he's doing such great work ladies and gentlemen if we don't show these posers

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.680
For who they are our children are going to be accepting them as the coming technocracy is in

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.640
Hiscacled so to say in natalones

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.160
uh

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.040
junkie bell for uh for keike and uh toadmore hen all them all

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.640
you
