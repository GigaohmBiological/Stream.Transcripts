WEBVTT

01:30.000 --> 01:52.000
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
He's going on French, British, Italian,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Japanese television.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
It's embarrassing.

02:56.000 --> 03:13.000
New music, who's talking about new music?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
That's ridiculous.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
That's old music.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
There was no spread in New York City.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Infectious clones are the only real threat.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
The red placebo batches were likely distributed.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Transfection in healthy mammals is dumb.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Yes, protocols were murdered.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Gain of function is a mythology.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
The Scooby-Doo is real.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
A spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And the lies are all about this.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
They're all about a novel virus.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
The millions of people were killed by and millions more were saved from.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Gain of function is real.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And the virus will come again.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
That's not really what we're trying to break here.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
At Giga Home Biological.

04:18.000 --> 04:28.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Welcome to the show.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
This is Giga Home Biological at High Resistance.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
It is the 6th of December, 2023.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It is late on a Wednesday evening.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Happy Wednesday evening to all of you.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Welcome to the show.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Thank you very much for joining me.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
We are still trying to dispel this illusion of consensus.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
This Scooby-Doo, we have been fooled into believing that we should solve a mystery.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
And in so solving that mystery, we have fooled ourselves into accepting the monsters in that mystery.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
By solving the mystery of the lab leak or the natural virus,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
we've accepted the possibility of a pandemic.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
We've accepted the potential of a pandemic that exists in mother nature.

05:16.000 --> 05:25.000
That exists in laboratories and that can exist in the mind of a clever biology student.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And this faith in a novel virus has to be dispelled.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
It cannot be passed on to our children.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
It cannot be.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
And that's really the goal here.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
We cannot let our children believe that in Batcave, somewhere in China, there might be a pandemic.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
We can't let them believe that in a cell culture somewhere in China or in America or in North Carolina

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
or in Ukraine, there could be a pandemic.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
We can't let them believe that in some animal facility somewhere in Texas

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
or somewhere in the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, there is a pandemic

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
and we definitely cannot let them believe that there is on a USB drive a sequence

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
which only needs to be translated into RNA and then we would have a pandemic.

06:07.000 --> 06:16.000
But this is the worst case scenario that the three year theater that we have been subjected to

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
was designed to make us accept so that we would leave it for our children

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
and so that our children's sovereignty would be inverted into permissions.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That's what's going on here.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
And the illusion of consensus, which has bamboozled us into accepting these monsters,

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
has bamboozled us into accepting this mythology lays right before our eyes

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
on our own side.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Many of these people were involved in ceding the worst case scenario narrative

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
and in so doing have created the perpetual need for these kinds of technologies,

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
the perpetual need for this kind of control and the perpetual need for this kind of oversight.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And that's what we don't want.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
That's what we never asked for, we never voted for, we never gave permission for.

07:04.000 --> 07:13.000
And yet all of these people, whether you like it or not, have been basically making the soil fertile

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
for these things to flower.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
And with the way that they did it was they kind of lured us into this mind-numbing ride.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh man, I didn't set that up yet.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Okay, let me just do that quick.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
They lured us into this mind-numbing ride about solving this mystery, right?

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
And the idea is, and this is the real trick, is that these people, this might switch something here.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Maybe not.

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
That these people have tricked us into thinking that, and I'm almost there, hold on one second,

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
that should be about, I can't really see it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Might have to switch.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay, let me see if this works.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
I'm kind of in focus, right?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh no, I don't have that down.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
My speaker's up over here.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh boy.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
All the secrets of the studio are being exposed.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's just a green curtain.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.000
So we really have been sort of, we left this, the driving to other people.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And we've been tricked into kind of accepting that, that Robert Malone invented the mRNA,

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
so he's speaking out, if he's throwing away his life to save us,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
then we don't have to speak out.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
We'll just wait for this to be cured.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
If all those people with those really nice shoes are going all around the world,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
speaking on our behalf, what would I need to do?

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Maybe send some emails, maybe subscribe to a sub stack.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Basically, everything else has been done already, right?

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
And that illusion, that illusion needs to be broken because that, that's exactly why we're still here,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
why this faith in this virus has been preserved because the same people have been telling the story

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
and walking around it for three years.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
The same people have been telling the story of how we've defeated epidemics in the past using vaccinations.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
They're still telling us stories about how coronaviruses can jump from other species in pandemic.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
They're still telling us stories about how PCR positives are rare and that asymptomatic spread is real.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And they're still telling us stories about variants and where they might come from,

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
be it from vaccine induced evolution or from more lab leaks.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
But it's never about the possibility that they were always there or that a background signal is being conflated.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And we spend money studying, gain a function research because it's necessary.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
And so this whole faith has never been questioned by anybody that's risen to prominence on our side.

10:01.000 --> 10:11.000
No one there this successful sub stack. No one with a successful nonprofit is questioning this narrative.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
I think it's throwing a real wrench in the works that, you know, as humble, I want to remain humble about my role in this,

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
but I do think it is thrown a little bit of a wrench in the works for me to now be at CHD actively questioning this.

10:25.000 --> 10:41.000
Not saying that CHD is a bad organization, but saying that the people who would like CHD to stay as close to on narrative as possible or as close to non committal as possible are not helped by my presence.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
And so this new world order really needs everybody to be on board. Everybody needs to be scared. Everybody needs to be confused.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Everybody's got to accept the worst case scenario. And then this just slides into place.

10:51.000 --> 11:04.000
That's the reason why these people were around, why these books were sold, why these people promoted each other because they were all collectively promoting the worst case scenario and the possibility of it either now or in the future.

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
That's the whole idea behind this illusion. The whole reason why we had to argue is to make sure that the worst case scenario never slid off the table.

11:13.000 --> 11:26.000
Even if we show that their modeling was complete nonsense, it couldn't slide the worst case scenario off the table because obviously gain a function was going on because they were lying about it in emails.

11:26.000 --> 11:36.000
And that's the seductive nature of the mystery solving exercise. That's the seductive nature of the Scooby Doo. It makes you feel like you're solving the puzzle.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
You become even more certain you understand. And that's a wicked trap indeed.

11:42.000 --> 11:54.000
And that's why people like Nurse Aaron are very interesting people to reflect on now in the midst of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 when they were really spreading their information.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
It was really about the worst case scenario in occurrence in New York City.

11:59.000 --> 12:10.000
And yesterday I thought it was really important to point out that all of these people that have been preserving this narrative of a novel virus that killed millions and millions more were saved from the came of game of function and may come again.

12:10.000 --> 12:27.000
All of these people seem to be related from the very beginning of the pandemic. The example I gave you yesterday was this music video in which both Nurse Aaron and Robert Malone and his wife and a few people that are also prominent on YouTube and also prominent in this circle of people.

12:27.000 --> 12:45.000
It doesn't seem to quite get it right about spread doesn't even seem to quite get Denny Rancor's data right has never really quite gotten it right because they always keep confusing the pandemic and the lockdown and the biology of the pandemic with things like

12:45.000 --> 12:56.000
these like transgenderism and the fake election and January 6th and so all these things get tied up by these people in specific altogether all the time.

12:56.000 --> 13:11.000
And they lack the focus necessary to focus on the absurdity of this right here these two people being in a music video together with his wife and her role in the New York City narrative early on and then afterwards even with her book and now.

13:11.000 --> 13:28.000
And so if we go to the end of this video that I didn't show you last night just so that you can see what happens after he sells his t-shirts so that you can see who these people are and make sure that if you want to look them up and you want to see what they've been up to you can do that because I think what you'll find is a very consistent record

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
of people who are not really challenging the narrative but just putting this part of the narrative on the right side of the political spectrum.

13:36.000 --> 13:51.000
And that's the trick they are making the virus narrative and the lab leak versus his natural hypotheses float directly on top of the red blue nurse Aaron Malone what did that say.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Sorry what.

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
Did that say Jill and then Alex Stein and look at these people are laughing their buns off.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
And then Luke Roodkowski actually I said that he started at 9-11 but he didn't I think he started at the.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
And that protest for Wall Street that was like during the 2008 thing what was that called.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Does anybody remember.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
But look I don't think she's Aaron Malone I think that's kind of a joke but it's a joke in the sense of what does it mean.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
It means that they're pretty close right it means.

14:30.000 --> 14:42.000
It means something that there's Aaron nurse Aaron Malone there I don't know what that means but she was definitely not trying to be anonymous at this time.

14:42.000 --> 14:52.000
I hope you can see how striking it is and how important it is to not lose sight of this behavior early on in the pandemic not to lose sight of where they were.

14:52.000 --> 15:02.000
At the same time they were supposedly coming out against the greatest crime in the history of man the greatest you know deception ever.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
But at that time it was pretty funny right and at that time we were fine with confusing it with all kinds of things.

15:10.000 --> 15:25.000
You can make the argument that music is one way to get the message out or you can make the argument that that's a awful waste of time and resources that is more or less confusing the issue of what was going on at the time which was that the American public and the world was being subjected

15:25.000 --> 15:34.000
to the rollout of a genetic technology under the pretenses or auspicious of an in fact an investigational vaccine.

15:34.000 --> 15:52.000
And really under the auspicious of this curve this curve down here being relevant instead of this curve up here which is the all cause mortality and not this one which is starting from zero and counting some kind of suspected and tested cases of something

15:52.000 --> 16:07.000
overlapping with many different syndromes and so remember last night we watched this video and again one of the things that strikes us as we watch these videos as these these purported dissidents come out to save us is that they don't question this narrative

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
they don't question the spread of a novel virus they don't question the fact that millions of people were killed.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
They don't question gain of function and they don't question it because you can see they don't do this math.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
Excess deaths is the mystery virus for them they are not going to acknowledge that there was a do not resuscitate orders spreading in New York City and elsewhere.

16:28.000 --> 16:36.000
They're not going to acknowledge that ventilators were misused like really horribly all throughout New York and other places where these mass casualty events occurred.

16:37.000 --> 16:53.000
They're not going to talk about the lack of antibiotics or the lack of poor use of steroids even though Pierre Corey and Ryan Cole both know that this was crucial in the early deaths in New York City and in Italy and anywhere else where they said that antibiotics don't work for a viral pneumonia.

16:53.000 --> 17:08.000
They won't talk about remdesivir even though they know that that played a huge role in the in the compounding deaths that were caused by its use even if that wasn't the only thing at play opioid deaths that were contributing to this hump here.

17:09.000 --> 17:23.000
When people were told not to give them Narcan when people were not treating those people during covid or they were just there was just more opiates on the street and this this is not accurately reflected in this change here.

17:23.000 --> 17:33.000
They're just all roped in excess deaths and then they can shift them around however they want to not to mention when they actually were financially incentivized to shift them around.

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
Interest in time I'll see if I can cut it even shorter than my address in the European Union Parliament.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
About half of the time I was supposed to have.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
First of all thank you Andrew, thank you members of the Parliament and thank you all for being here today.

17:51.000 --> 18:02.000
My job is a very simple one is to set the stage for the context of how this came about and I thought that it was only appropriate to use the trees in action 1551 here in the UK.

18:03.000 --> 18:12.000
So thanks for that I do think that Luke was for the 911 movement but I just didn't know for sure so I wanted to make sure I didn't extend it too far back.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
If you're going to confirm that I think I'm going to go with it because that was what I said yesterday and it's what I thought but I wanted to get some feedback so thanks very much for that.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
So the grounds for starting this presentation because we have long lost the idea of what it means to have publicly calculated.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
So I would be appropriate to make sure that we recall that back then sleeping with the Queen Consulate was a problem.

18:35.000 --> 18:49.000
Doing these various things with respect to the crown were a problem but somehow or another since 1351 we've lost the idea that a full on assault on liberty at every level is somehow acceptable.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
So I thought we'd at least start with the spirit of 1351 in the room as we move to the next slide.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
My job here is not to convince you of the thing.

18:59.000 --> 19:16.000
My job here is to merely present the context it says that there is no question that the entirety of what we've been through over the last four years has been merely an orchestration to assault the liberties of people here in this country and around the world.

19:16.000 --> 19:33.000
Pretending that this is some sort of public health emergency, pretending this is a justification for the inconceivable threat to liberties and the violation of human rights is actually nothing more than to give lip service to violence.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
And the fact of the matter is the evidence starts here in the UK in 1966.

19:38.000 --> 19:48.000
Your own wealth and trust was the one who decided to fund the coronavirus as the preferred form of human manipulation in 1966.

19:48.000 --> 19:59.000
It was one year later that the United States and the UK got into an agreement that said that we were going to modify and manipulate coronavirus to see what could be done to infect a healthy population.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
And quote, that was 1967 the year of my birth.

20:03.000 --> 20:14.000
So this slow-moving train wreck that we call Operation Warp Speed only took 56 short, short years to come into beating.

20:14.000 --> 20:23.000
And in 2011, in the document that is imaged on the left, which unfortunately given the size of the screen is pretty much illegible, you can go find it,

20:23.000 --> 20:36.000
a antitrust collusion, and I'm using that term quite literally, between the Welcome Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation, NIAIP and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,

20:36.000 --> 20:49.000
got together and established a mandate that said that by 2020, the world would accept, and I quote, a universal vaccine, end quote, by the end of 2020.

20:50.000 --> 21:06.000
Now these folks apparently have a divining rod or some sort of mysterious bubble that they can look into to see the future with such absolute elegance that they actually identify back then that coronavirus might be the thing that would be just what nature needed to afford for that to happen.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
And by 2015, we had the public statement and I need to read this into the record.

21:12.000 --> 21:24.000
To sustain the funding based beyond the crisis, we need to increase the public understanding of the need for medical countermeasures, such as a pan influenza or pan coronavirus vaccine.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Let me pause for a moment.

21:26.000 --> 21:33.000
When the statement was made, the World Health Organization had officially declared coronavirus a eradicated disease.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
In what world do we need in a vaccine for a disease that the World Health Organization had its own infinite wisdom to declare eradicated?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Question?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Just sit on that for a moment.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
But let's go on.

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
Key driver is the media and the economics will fall in the hype.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Does that sound like a public health emergency to you?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
Or does that sound like a statement of treason?

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
That is an act of domestic and international terrorism and that's the admission of that act.

22:13.000 --> 22:30.000
And just in a few short days, we will have the author of that statement, one Peter Dashie, testifying in Congress that this thing probably still came out of a random event that took place in Wuhan, China, where a bat and a hangout and got together and voila.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
In the summer, we were there.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
That's a quote from 2015 in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
That's the conspiracy level language I'm using.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
And by the way, I'm using the term conspiracy in the legal definition of the term.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
This is the admission of conspiracy to commit acts of terror.

22:49.000 --> 22:59.000
And one year later, the last image you see on this screen, one year later, was the announcement and I'm quoting that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Virus One, was, and I quote,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
poised for human emergence.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
And quote, that was 2016.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
That's the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
That's the conspiracy that I'm apparently representing.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Next slide.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
Now, the evidence for all of you has endowed the merits of the argument that I made.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It's right in front of you.

23:22.000 --> 23:31.000
In 2002, the upper left, you see the first patent in 2002, filed on the synthetic chimera coronavirus,

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
which, as I've said in many instances, was actually patented to be infectious and replication defect.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
What that means is it was actually weaponized.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
That's not an allegation.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
That's a statement of fact, because in 2005, you see at the bottom of the curriculum detail of one route there.

23:50.000 --> 24:01.000
Like that, he said, I believe that is of his bio sets, synthetic coronaviruses, biohacking, biological warfare enabling technologies.

24:01.000 --> 24:11.000
Does anyone actually want to just minister about what he could have potentially meant when he said biological warfare enabling technology?

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Does that sound like a public health response?

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
Does that sound like a P3 program when we're trying to figure out how to treat this thing?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Is that what it sounds like?

24:21.000 --> 24:32.000
Or is there an outside chance that the reason why he unleashed $10 million that year and every other year in non-competitive grants from all of the above reference agencies?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Is there any chance of the reason why?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Because they were actually building, are you ready for this?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Biological weapons.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
Now, I haven't had a credential in the United States since 2002 of being a biological weapons inspector.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I know of what I speak.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
And the fact of the matter is I briefed this matter first in 2002.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
I consistently briefed this ever since.

24:56.000 --> 25:09.000
And when in 2019, September 18, 2019, we actually had the World Health Organization's Global Preparedness Monitoring Award announce that there was going to be,

25:09.000 --> 25:24.000
in the time between September 19, 2019 and September of 2020, there was going to be, are you ready for this, an accidental or intentional release of a respiratory health?

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
There's an operative word in that statement that's quite alarming, isn't there?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Release.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
That's not the leak.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
That's not an accidental escape.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
They used the word release.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
They didn't use.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
There might be an accident.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Let's go to the next slide.

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
And I'm going to have to jump past this, because I'm almost out of time, and I've said that we can stick to nine minutes, so I'm going to jump past this one.

25:50.000 --> 26:04.000
And unfortunately, I'll only reference this by saying that the criminal conspiracy, which must be criminally prosecuted in this country, not alleged, but prosecuted, is the racketeering that has been the World Health Organization's collusion

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
since the MRC in this country was founded by the welcome trust.

26:08.000 --> 26:16.000
And since in the United States, the Rockefeller Foundation functionally funded what we now call the CDC, which back then was the malaria prevention program.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
But we must actually deal with the fact that this antitrust collusion actually did not start in the last few years.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
It started in 1955, and why is this important?

26:26.000 --> 26:36.000
It's important, because in the U.S. and China, the status of the World Health Organization, we cannot commit, we cannot even indict or investigate crimes committed by the World Health Organization.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
But there is no statute of limitations on these crimes.

26:41.000 --> 26:55.000
These are crimes that have no statute of limitations, and we can actually predate the Gates Foundation, the welcome trust, and the Rockefeller Foundation's criminal collusion with prosecuting the crimes when they were actually committed.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
It was fraud now, resulting in the murder of civilization around the world.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Last slide.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Almost last slide.

27:04.000 --> 27:24.000
I can't help but sit in this chamber and point out that none other than Eliza Manningham, who was the head of the welcome trust board of trustees, who happened at the same time to be the head of MI5, was the one who sat at the helm of COVID when the September 19 launched of this campaign began.

27:24.000 --> 27:34.000
You cannot escape the fact that MI5 was directly involved in the premeditation and distribution of this particular campaign of terror.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
And I know that as an American, it's probably a bad idea for me to say that in this audience.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I could care less.

27:41.000 --> 27:48.000
The fact of the matter is criminals exist in every strata of this government, and we need to actually be able to point that out.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
And I figured why not go ahead and put the poster right up there so everybody can see it.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
I'm only nine seconds away from my last slide.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
This is the last slide.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Maybe the last week, why?

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
And let's stop pretending that we have to ask a question of why.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
That's a nonsense question.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.000
In the 1980s, we conveniently had the HIV pandemic.

28:13.000 --> 28:22.000
So that we could actually justify the national type of vaccine immunity shield that was granted to the injection manufacturers at the time.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
This fact matter is that the public was willing to deal with it because they all knew age was coming for them.

28:28.000 --> 28:39.000
We tried to get that immunity long before, but once we had the HIV scare, we could get the public to say, yep, immunity to the manufacturers because we know we're going to need it.

28:39.000 --> 28:50.000
September of 2001, we all pretend that we know what happened with the towers on the 11th, but we all forget what happened on the 28th, which was a defense department from their bioweapons program released anthrax.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
And four short years later, we had a prep act.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
Why? Because in 1991, we were killing people with anthrax vaccines in the Gulf.

28:58.000 --> 29:07.000
And we gave the government a way to get the adult provisions protection into adult injections because the Child and Act didn't give them the cover that they needed.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
And so four short years later, we have the prep act, which gives us medical care measures, and it gives us corporate immunity.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So guess what stars is?

29:15.000 --> 29:22.000
Nothing more than the four-year later, see a pattern preamble to the World Health Organization's IHR.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Don't pretend like enough not to.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
This was a setup from the beginning to the end.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I yield the balance to everybody else, but I think since you brought up the lovely church last year, go ahead and take that quote.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Never let a good crisis go to waste.

29:37.000 --> 29:46.000
This is all a marketing cover story to deprive you of liberty, and I'm here to make sure that as long as I draw breath, I'm fighting to get it back.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Thank you very much.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Now, why is that so deceptive?

29:50.000 --> 29:55.000
He says he started at 1351, then he went to 1966 at coronaviruses.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
We started pretending with coronaviruses already then.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Nothing more to give but to give lip service.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
The Welcome Trust decided in 1966 in cooperation with USA to use coronavirus to infect human populations.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
And I think what they were talking about is live spreading vaccines.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
I think they were talking about good ideas or, let's say, well-meaning ideas.

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
And that's also where Ralph Barrack's research center was for a very long time.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
The idea that coronaviruses are very innocuous, but they're abundant.

30:31.000 --> 30:40.000
And so since they're an abundant background signal, maybe we can alter them and use them so that the body, we can send signals to the body.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
We can transfect the body.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
We can use the body.

30:42.000 --> 30:53.000
Use coronaviruses to send signals to our tissues, and the tissues won't react to them as they would with other viruses because coronaviruses are so well tolerated.

30:53.000 --> 31:04.000
He said that Warp Speed actually was the ultimate end of this 60-year thing or 40-year thing, whatever it was.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
Anti-trust collusion with the Rockefeller's and the Welcome Trust to constitute a universal vaccine.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Coronavirus was actually a candidate.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
Again, I have written here for genetic tool, just like retroviruses were.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
He talked about pan-coronavirus, pan-influenza vaccine.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's not something new.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
The idea that investors will respond.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.000
We've listened to Ralph Barrack give that talk before that pandemics are a great time to make money.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
That's not necessarily selling anything.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
That's not necessarily revealing the truth, and he's still not revealing it either.

31:39.000 --> 32:00.000
Because even on Alex Zek's program where he seemed to admit that there really wasn't a virus, he was not able to succinctly describe how the pandemic was then orchestrated because no one, no one, no one will say that they've murdered people.

32:00.000 --> 32:22.000
If he would say that this was a Coronavirus Pretend Act to take away our rights and said that they murdered people with protocols in hospitals in order to do it and lied to you about this mass casualty event in New York City so that you would think that all this testing that they did had something to do with it.

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
And that would clear the sky right up, and everybody would be like, wait, what?

32:27.000 --> 32:35.000
You mean the thing that happened in New York didn't have anything to do with me standing in line to get a drive-through swab in my nose?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Not at all.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
What happened in that drive-through has nothing to do with what happened in New York.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh, crazy.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
So that's what you mean by it was all an elaborate.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.000
So he really makes it seem like the only thing that this is is that they plan to do it all along.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
They plan to release it.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
They plan to squirt you with it.

33:04.000 --> 33:12.000
But it wasn't really a danger is not really what he says and it wasn't really people dying and what they were dying of, he never says.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And that's magic.

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
And that's extremely consistent with what we have been saying for a long time because of course this guy who also spoke to the group,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
said it a little better.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
He didn't say they murdered him by protocol.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
Hello, my name is Dr. Mike Eden.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
Probably no by now that I'm a career research scientist, a biologist.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
I've worked in the bio pharmaceutical industry for over 30 years.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Famously, a former vice president at Pfizer.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I left in 2011 as well.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
I'm just going to pause Mike for a second because I'll finish up with with Martin to make sure you understand.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
He said that there were synthetic coronaviruses.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.000
He said that synthetic coronaviruses could be used for biohacking or bio warfare enabling technology.

34:17.000 --> 34:38.000
But he didn't explain to you how and how we're positing that it would have occurred was using a what did he call it a synthetic chimeric infectious replication defective clone of a coronavirus and taking that synthetic chimeric infectious

34:38.000 --> 34:56.000
replication defective clone and putting it in different places in the world would produce people with symptoms would produce people shedding exosomes that might cause symptoms in people around them and would have cultureable or at least what would appear to be

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
cultureable RNA virus because what is cultureable?

35:00.000 --> 35:11.000
It's taking a sample from that person and putting it on cell culture and having the cell culture die and also being able to sequence something in that culture.

35:11.000 --> 35:21.000
And so because we know that the RNA when it when a clone is put into a cell culture, we know that it makes lots of these smaller RNAs.

35:21.000 --> 35:29.000
And we know that that PCR test is looking for those smaller RNAs.

35:29.000 --> 35:44.000
Then you can see why it is that when we have a replication defective infectious clone sprayed on a population released out of city sprayed in a subway that these people will produce viral proteins.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
They will produce sub genomic RNAs. Those sub genomic RNAs will show up on an RTPCR.

35:52.000 --> 36:00.000
But then that peak will go up and down and it will never spread anywhere. And so when they started testing people in Pittsburgh, it didn't matter.

36:00.000 --> 36:08.000
Because what they were testing for was a background signal related to maybe the clone that they released for all we know.

36:09.000 --> 36:15.000
But why doesn't David Martin go to the extent to which and explain this?

36:15.000 --> 36:28.000
How could a synthetic chimeric infectious replication defective clone be used to see the narrative of a pandemic to put this high fidelity signal in many places around the world so you could claim that this was evidence of spread.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
Like I've been trying to say for a year and a half.

36:34.000 --> 36:46.000
Why didn't he say that to Alex Zach? Why don't we explain it to them so that they get it so that you say that we're really not saying that there's no virus but we're definitely not saying that there's no signal.

36:46.000 --> 37:01.000
And what that signal could be composed of one component that's manmade synthetic chimeric infectious replication defective clone and one that's a background signal with overlapping homology.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
It's just so easy.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
And it's so shocking how they don't say it. How they say it so poorly.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
How they don't say it at all.

37:12.000 --> 37:22.000
And how Mike Eden has been saying it for a couple years now and nobody ever listens to him. They always edit his video out. Nobody ever shares it. It doesn't circulate.

37:22.000 --> 37:33.000
When have you seen Robert Malone tweet about Michael Eden? Oh, the only time Robert Malone is tweeted about Michael Eden. He says, where are the receipts?

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
If they're doing this on purpose, where are the receipts? Come on, man.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Wow. Did you know that?

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
I hope you would know that. But of course you wouldn't know that because Twitter and all these are these these social media are not going to promote that interaction.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
Even if Robert Malone was just off of his game for a little while there and let his guard down.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
That didn't get promoted. People forgot about that.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
Just like they're going to forget very quickly that Denny Redcore also showed that there was no spread.

38:03.000 --> 38:15.000
Lucky that this guy won't forget it. Let's listen to Mr. Sparkle.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
Hello, my name is Dr. Mike Eden.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.000
Probably know by now that I'm a career research scientist and biologist.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
I've worked in the bio pharmaceutical industry for over 30 years.

38:31.000 --> 38:40.000
Famously, a former vice president advisor, I left in 2011 as vice president and worldwide head of respiratory research.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
I was responsible for everything from idea to clinical proof of concept.

38:45.000 --> 38:52.000
In the 10 years after leaving Pfizer, I've worked as an independent, I consulted to 30 biotech companies.

38:52.000 --> 39:03.000
I also founded, led and sold my own biotech, Zionco, and we were written up in a 2017 article in Forbes magazine.

39:03.000 --> 39:12.000
I think it was converting Pfizer discards into gold and it was written by a former Pfizer board member.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
So three years before this alleged event started, I was very well regarded in the industry.

39:21.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm going to tell you that the design of the so called vaccines was intentionally to harm people.

39:30.000 --> 39:39.000
And I'm going to give you several examples of that based on my extensive industry experience of rational drug design,

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
not a single asthma molecule in a synthetic drug is in there by luck.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.000
It's in there because people chose it to be in there and they intended certain things to flow from their choices.

39:52.000 --> 40:00.000
I think this is a really important place to stop because this is exactly what Robert Malone called him out on Twitter to bring the receipts.

40:01.000 --> 40:10.000
And this is also what we've been talking about for a long time in different contexts in different interpretations in different possibility spaces.

40:10.000 --> 40:19.000
But we've always been talking about the idea that these these various epitopes which people are claiming have been installed into the spike protein.

40:19.000 --> 40:30.000
Are there specifically for the purpose of adjuvant function or attraction of the immune system, the stimulation of antibody production,

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
the activation of antigen presenting cells or T cells or something of this effect.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
And so there's been a lot of speculation about what that might be.

40:40.000 --> 40:47.000
But I think the easiest way to do it is to think about it the way that Mike Eden is thinking about it and those things are not in there by chance.

40:47.000 --> 40:57.000
Either they're in there because they're homologous parts of very conserved regions of that protein, which are going to be homologous across viruses across RNA.

40:57.000 --> 41:11.000
Exosomes or alternatively, those things were installed there found in the synthetic clone so that they could be used as as a sort of shrug your shoulders and say, well, this is the protein we found.

41:12.000 --> 41:20.000
Lucky for us, it's got this magic epitope that even after we give it to you five times, you're still going to make new antibodies to it.

41:20.000 --> 41:37.000
So no doubt what is hidden in this spike protein and the sequence that was purported to be found in these different places at the start of the pandemic is likely proprietary technology based on technology like what epivacs would produce where they're looking for epitope small

41:37.000 --> 41:59.000
and eight to 10 amino acids long that have a certain electrostatic signature which meshes very well with a wide range of HLA receptor types so that it has a broad ability to activate the immune system of different human backgrounds.

42:00.000 --> 42:20.000
These two types of immunosystems are the most attractive to the immune system and that's where we got off into this tangent a few weeks ago talking about dams or damage associated molecular patterns as opposed to pathogen associated molecular patterns.

42:20.000 --> 42:41.000
Two different theories on how the immune system works. One, thinking about, I don't know why I'm holding this brush, one thinking about the idea that the immune system would generalize across biological motifs to look for the ones that are dangerous, looks for the ones that are hydrophobic, looks for the ones that are anti are

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
oxidizing or dangerous from a chemical perspective and then make antibodies to neutralize those epitopes only as toxins essentially.

42:51.000 --> 43:07.000
And that's very different than pathogen associated molecular patterns which tends to imply that each new pathogen should have a whole other set of memories irrespective of whether or not the motifs that are the most dangerous in that pathogen are conserved across those that have been previously seen.

43:08.000 --> 43:31.000
And so in this sense, when Mike Eden is saying that nothing is by chance in this vaccine, what he is suggesting is even if he's not directly saying it, I will say it for him, that it's likely that the sequence that was found or purported to be found was either planted there or intended to be there so that that spike protein

43:32.000 --> 43:55.000
and its proprietary useful sequences that activate the immune system across several exposures of it would be present in there so that any vaccine, any transfection, anything that was made with that protein would have an extra chance of success, be it J and J, be it the mRNA or be it Novavax.

43:56.000 --> 44:04.000
And then the only thing to do would be to play some game where you got rid of one like J and J and said, wow, that one's got a lot of problems but we're watching them.

44:05.000 --> 44:11.000
And so by saying that that one has problems, you're implying that this one doesn't and that's exactly what they did.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Take it away again, Mike.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
But just very briefly, you should know, I hope, there has not been a pandemic.

44:21.000 --> 44:34.000
Dennis Rancourt's data shows that the all-cause mortality ever data did not increase at all in the run up to the declaration, fraudly, by WHO pandemic.

44:34.000 --> 44:41.000
There is no public health emergency except that created by our governments a inappropriate fraudulent.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Now, there was local excess mortality.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
There was local excess mortality, but overall, it averages out, right? That's one of the things to understand here.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
You got to be very careful. There was very high excess mortality in New York for about four weeks.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
There was a few places around the world where that also occurred, but in general, not at all.

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
PCR tests were used to give people the impression that they had a particular disease where they didn't.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
There were all the normal diseases.

45:08.000 --> 45:25.000
And then what happened was in three different ways people were treated badly through changed medical procedures that were imposed above the level of nation briefly mass ventilation of people inappropriately in hospitals that led to lots of deaths.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
In care homes, many people were given sedatives and respiratory depressants, which led to their deaths.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
My PhD was specifically in that.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
Yes, I was going to say, yes, Mike is going to come on the stream. We're just trying to organize when he's got a lot of.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
He's got a lot of stuff to do.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Yes, he's coming on the community.

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
People would denied life saving antibiotics and died of bacterial pneumonia.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
There's a pandemic.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
There was no other pandemic.

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
And based on this line, we were told that vaccines were coming our way and would be our savior.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Two things.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
As I say, first, there's no pandemic.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
So you certainly don't need an experimental or rushed medical interventions.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
And that's the point that he's atomic live Mark Koolack and myself and others are trying to make first and foremost that if the deaths.

46:22.000 --> 46:33.000
From remdesivir from the opioid epidemic from the do not resuscitate orders from the lack of antibiotics from all of those things if those deaths hadn't occurred so that people could point.

46:34.000 --> 46:42.000
And so that the news programs could report something and so that the PBS NewsHour could project into the future a few weeks that this was going to be a worst case scenario.

46:42.000 --> 46:49.000
If that wouldn't have happened, then people wouldn't have gotten in line and tested for by the thousands in a drive through.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
And then we wouldn't have had all of these asymptomatic cases.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
And then this entire narrative would have fallen apart.

46:56.000 --> 47:12.000
And without that initial casualty event in New York and a few other places that was followed by this dramatic rollout of tests around the world that was called evidence of spread, then there would have been no justification for the transfection being rolled out.

47:12.000 --> 47:23.000
And the justification for the transfection being rolled out was 100% supported was 100% supported by all the people that didn't speak out in 2020.

47:24.000 --> 47:32.000
All the people that didn't speak out in the beginning of 2021 because if you weren't speaking out, you were supporting this worst case scenario narrative.

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
If you were looking for emergency use authorization for unique combinations of repurposed drugs, you were supporting the worst case scenario narrative.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
If you were on your own stream saying that it was going to be a worst case scenario, you were definitely supporting it.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
And that's where a lot of these people were in 2020.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
They were not questioning the narrative. They were not trying to temper the potential.

48:01.000 --> 48:13.000
They were not trying to speak out for natural immunity and the idea that it's possible being bamboozled by a background signal and a specific test or a test that's very specific on a very broad background.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Only Mike and a few other people like myself were doing that.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
And I was following Mike's lead for the most part. I was never ahead of Mike. Let's just say that right away.

48:24.000 --> 48:44.000
But secondly, even if you did, as someone who's worked in the industry for over 30 years, I am telling you, it's absolutely impossible to invent tests, clinically evaluates and manufacture and then launch on global scale a complex biomedical product.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
It's absolutely impossible.

48:46.000 --> 48:59.000
And he's not necessarily only talking about the RNA, ladies and gentlemen. He's also talking about the lateral flow test. He's also talking about the PCR test. He's also talking about anything to do with this that was mass produced.

49:01.000 --> 49:14.000
You want to go listen to a really silly podcast. Go listen to the last time that Elon Musk was on the Joe Rogan podcast and listen to him talk about the fact that making a prototype of an electric car is easy.

49:15.000 --> 49:33.000
Compared to trying to manufacture and produce an electric car, which is about 1000 times harder. You can invent one of these tests. You can you can say that these primers work, but making a commercial test test based on product based on that test is something entirely different.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Producing it well and in high fidelity is something very different.

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
And we took all of that for granted, and then we also took it for granted on these at Transfections, which is just extraordinary.

49:46.000 --> 49:53.000
It's not as close. It's years wrong. The fastest record price of this for six years.

49:53.000 --> 50:08.000
And friends of mine who work all their lives in manufacturing of complex biological products tell me the methods development alone for development of a reproducible manufacturing process itself takes a number of years.

50:09.000 --> 50:17.000
So whatever it is you think was done. I am telling you there was not the development of a proper medical product.

50:18.000 --> 50:26.000
What I think happens was the advancements of materials that are intentionally toxic.

50:26.000 --> 50:37.000
And then they were sketchy advanced and jammed into people's arms often coerced, sometimes even mandated with the unsurprising effect that millions of people.

50:38.000 --> 50:49.000
Have died. I don't have time today to explain what I think they're going to do in the future, but suffice to say more injections are coming if we don't stop this.

50:49.000 --> 51:00.000
So, like I said, I'm skilled in the arts of rational drug discovery. So why am I saying these materials are intentionally toxic.

51:00.000 --> 51:10.000
Let me give you the first example. How do you think your body plays nice with itself, but when it's infected or detects a cancer, it goes to war.

51:10.000 --> 51:20.000
And the answer is it distinguishes self things that are meant to be inside you from non self from foreign things that are not meant to be inside you.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
And it is trained exquisitely to detect and attack non self foreign things.

51:27.000 --> 51:40.000
If you inject a person with a gene that encodes a foreign piece of protein like a spike protein from a foreign organism, your body will detect that.

51:40.000 --> 51:51.000
And every single cell that takes up that material and expresses foreign protein will be attacked and killed by your immune system.

51:51.000 --> 51:57.000
Now, if you think that's advanced immunology, let me put you right, it's in the first chapter.

51:57.000 --> 52:10.000
And distinguishing self from non self is one of the foremost lessons of immunology, and every single person involved in the trainer delivery of these materials.

52:10.000 --> 52:18.000
So doctors hands knew what I just told you, they will inevitably cause injury.

52:18.000 --> 52:27.000
That's why I started saying definitively that transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent because there is no excuse.

52:27.000 --> 52:40.000
If the doctors that have pushed this and including your doctor have pushed this without adequately understanding what transfection was, how dangerous it might be, then they are criminally negligent.

52:40.000 --> 52:54.000
You count on them. You count on we count on our doctors to know better than us about what's going on here. And now that we know what's going on here, they should have done known better and we need to realize that we need to come to this conclusion.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
You want to forgive your doctor. That's great.

52:57.000 --> 53:16.000
You can watch Vax to and you can see a little boy carrying around a suitcase that he's got to carry around in order to breathe and you can listen to his mom talk about how she forgives that doctor for giving him that HPV vaccine.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.000
And that kid basically killed himself about a year and a half after that movie was done.

53:23.000 --> 53:30.000
So forgive your doctor you can forgive your doctor.

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
But the doctor needs to understand what happened here they all need to understand and that is coming.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.000
It's just a question of what happens to our system what happens to our society when this comes what's going to come with it.

53:43.000 --> 54:00.000
Are we also going to be at each other's throat because Bobby made Trump win or Biden won by cheating or Kamala Harris won by cheating or my gosh can you imagine if Dick Cheney's daughter wins.

54:00.000 --> 54:07.000
What kind of disaster it would be on top of the collapse of the health care system and the.

54:07.000 --> 54:23.000
Something big some big storm is coming ladies and gentlemen because there's no other way they can keep this train moving unless they keep bombarding us with more things to distract us from this gigantic mammoth of a lie.

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
And it is a lie because they definitely knew it would hurt us then on top of that.

54:29.000 --> 54:41.000
It's not just bad enough that you're making a foreign protein you're making a specific material called spike protein those materials are biologically active.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
That is if you add them to human blood for example.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
They start to calculate it close those materials are biological toxins.

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
So now you've got a genetic sequence that forms foreign proteins that means your body attacks and kills every cell that does it.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
I mean another scenario would be of course to have designed a toxin.

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
And then claim that you found a coronavirus with that toxin on the outside but not say that it's a toxin.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
It's just the spike protein and since the spike protein uses the ACE2 receptor to bind.

55:17.000 --> 55:26.000
And then get a whole bunch of monkeys to go on the internet and talk all kinds of fancy about how they know all kinds of stuff about ACE2 and how it reacts with Brady kind and to and.

55:26.000 --> 55:39.000
And it you know controls all the water balance and it's also in circulation and draw all these arrows and give this long huge lecture about how ACE2 is so important and all these different tissues.

55:39.000 --> 55:48.000
And that would distract from the fact that that's just a synthetic chimeric infectious replication defective clone.

55:48.000 --> 55:57.000
That's carrying a sequence that you want to use as a weapon that you want people to accept or even beg or fight for.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
To ship to other countries because we've got to help those countries because they can't afford it.

56:04.000 --> 56:14.000
And all the while it's just a toxin that you know that a few people that take it are going to die and more importantly that you're rolling out this concept that you know this is safe.

56:14.000 --> 56:23.000
All we got to do is swap the RNA with some other RNA and we can fix everything.

56:23.000 --> 56:34.000
It's a very frightening place we are ladies and gentlemen and very few people have seen it as well as Mike Eden and very few people have actually been censored like Mike Eden has been censored.

56:35.000 --> 56:42.000
You demon.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
No, I'm coming if we don't stop this.

56:45.000 --> 56:51.000
So, like I said, I'm skilled in the arts of rational drug discovery.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
So why am I saying these materials are intentionally toxic.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Let me give you the first example.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
How do you think your body.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Oh, yeah.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
It's self.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm going to go.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
When it's infected or detector cancer, it goes to.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
I'm going to go forward a little bit.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
And the answer is it's a factor.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
And there are many others, but let me give it the third one.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
These materials are formulated.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
It's normal to formulate drugs.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
These are formulated in fatty globules called lipid nanoparticles.

57:22.000 --> 57:27.000
What they do is disguise the foreign genetic information.

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
So your body doesn't see it initially until it gets inside your cells and it goes all around your body.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
It will glide through the cell wall as if it wasn't there.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
And that was the entire point of it.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
So that means these materials don't just go to your lymph nodes.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Oh, you're joking.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
My goodness sakes.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
My me.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Give me a break.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Do is disguise the foreign information.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
So your body doesn't see it initially until it gets inside your cells.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And it goes all around your body.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
It will glide through the cell wall as if it wasn't there.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
And that was the entire point of it.

58:08.000 --> 58:15.000
So that means these materials don't just go to your lymph nodes and they certainly don't stay in your arm where they're injected.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
They go all around the body, including into your brain and your blood and every organ in your body.

58:22.000 --> 58:41.000
Now the reason why this is important to understand is that I would suggest to you that it's possible that people like Flemming and McCairn and Catrell and all these people that were saying that amyloidosis and prions were possible at the start of the rollout.

58:41.000 --> 58:50.000
And remember, please remember that when Luke Montagnier supposedly published a paper about people getting.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
Crowds felt yock of disease from the back scene.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Not from the virus.

58:58.000 --> 59:10.000
And yet somehow or another that finding was turned around and claiming that the spike protein was doing it and therefore the virus was doing it and therefore we had to be afraid of the circulating virus because it was probably going to come out.

59:10.000 --> 59:16.000
And it was probably going to cause pre-on disease in lots and lots of people.

59:16.000 --> 59:29.000
And I want you to see how convenient that is for covering up for the fact that they probably expected transfection to have that exact outcome because of the fact that they were chemically altering the RNA.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
Because they were codon optimizing the RNA.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
They had to know that that was one of the possibilities.

59:36.000 --> 59:47.000
If protein misfolding is a pathology that can cascade out of control, then they had to know that transfecting with this kind of RNA would definitely have that as a possibility.

59:47.000 --> 59:58.000
So what better thing to seed in the early narrative with these worst case scenario bio weapon crazy people than that very thing.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And make sure you seeded it for the whole year. They talked about it for the spike protein for the whole year of 2020.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And I was originally anticipating and maybe they were originally going to do this that they were going to use the spike protein as an excuse for why the transfection failed.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And to a certain extent they did.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But at some moment, I don't know if it was because of us pushing back on that narrative, but it says expanded now to also include DNA in the shot also to include endotoxes in the shot.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
And now just as of tonight, they have gone back.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:51.000
There is a UCL paper that came out that shows that the codon optimization and the N1 methyl pseudo uridine, whatever it is that they did, is now causing frame shifts.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And so that's even worse than substituting a amino acid because a frame shift means that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase or in this case the ribosome will shift one amino acid one base rather over and that means that all the words shift.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Because remember every three bases is an amino acid. So if you shift over one base, now you've shifted over one base of three, and that means you're going to read the next three bases as an amino acid instead of these.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And that means all the next codons are all going to be off by one.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And so that can result in a whole nother bouquet of unknowns, depending on where that skip occurs. And that is something that has just been recently published that now Kevin McCurnan is also getting around with a publication with Jessica Rose and and David Wiseman and a few others.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
But we were already talking about that with Kevin McCurnan way back when in 2021 already.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Or 2022 maybe it was but still.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And that possibility still hadn't been rung out to its full potential before it was dropped and ignored now it's coming back but it's coming back because someone published it.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
So now they've got to acknowledge it.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And so if we keep pushing them this far we keep pushing them they've already not able to use the spike protein as an excuse anymore.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:30.000
They're already having to back pedal because of Mike and myself and others who have been pushing the idea that it doesn't matter what protein you use as long as it's non self it's going to screw you up.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Because of this mechanism that he's describing right here and so the spike protein as an excuse doesn't work.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It works but it doesn't work from the perspective of why the vaccine didn't work. The vaccine has extra nasty because of the spike but transfection would have never worked.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And Mike is very good about saying that but very very few others are.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Ten years ago, there were papers published and well established and well known in the industry that lipid nanoparticles lipid nano carriers deposit their cargo for eventually in the ovaries.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And that was confirmed with the Pfizer products in an animal experiment performed for the Japanese regulators.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So by design.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
These agents cause an autoimmune attack on every tissue.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:40.000
They make your body form a well understood biological toxin that can damage multiple organs in your body.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And they deposited their car goes preferentially in the reproductive tissues of women and girls.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
If you think that's by luck, then you're mistaken. There is no doubt in my mind.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Anyone of my caliber, and this is my peers that worked on this absolutely understood what they were designing and manufacturer.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
So, I think having, having heard what I've just said that there was no pandemic.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And the line was maintained in all its injects people en masse like five and a half billion people with an intentionally dangerous substance 17 million of whom have died so far.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:31.000
What do you think is happening and what do you think your role as an individual is in stopping this crime.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
That's what I'm talking about. Thank you very much, Michael.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Mike Eden is one of the one of the big guys in this fight.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Check it warnings about the Wuhan lab in a possible cover up three years before the COVID pandemic.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's raising new questions about China's role in the global health disaster and what Dr. Fauci knew about it.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
All this is China's struggles with an alarming surge of respiratory illnesses overloading medical centers.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So we start with that. Welcome to a brand new hour of America's newsroom. I'm Dana Perino.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
How you doing?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Great. And you?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Great.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Better say great.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Morning partner. I'm Bill Hemmer. Good morning at home. We're now learning a U.S. health official.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Working for Dr. Fauci raised serious safety concerns six years ago in 2017 after taking a tour of the lab in Wuhan.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
China's first ever level four biosafety lab for handling dangerous pathogens.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
The U.S. official was shocked and alarmed after learning the lab was considering plans to reverse engineer the deadly Ebola virus.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But when she told superiors before writing her report, she was ordered to delete any reference to Ebola.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
More on this, Richardson follows it up on what they knew and why they might want to hide that critical information.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Rich, hello to you. Good morning.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Good morning, Bill.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
This U.S. health worker toured the Wuhan Institute of Virology just as it was about to open its most secure lab.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Chinese officials were admitting they needed more expertise to operate it.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
This is the same facility that some believe U.S. officials started COVID-19 with an accidental lab leak.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
U.S. health official touring the lab worked for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
That's part of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:22.000
In emails obtained by Fox, she wrote to other NIH officials that during her tour, a technician at the Wuhan lab complained it was illegal to import Ebola to China to study it.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
The NIH worker then wrote to other department officials, quote,

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I remember he said that since they don't have the Ebola virus, they had, quote, considered using reverse genetics to create the virus.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I was shocked to hear what he said that.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I also worry the reaction of people in Washington when they read this.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The technician is only a worker, not a decision-maker, nor a PI, principal investigator.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So how much we should believe what he said.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
She wrote, if that got out, it would be difficult to get more information.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So that's interesting, right? We're just all doing the same thing. It's all the same show.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000
They're still pretending that a pandemic happened, that a lab leak is likely, that we're still trying to decide whether they covered it up.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
We're still trying to decide whether early treatment was really necessary, or whether those ventilators were a problem.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
That's all the same show, and it hasn't stopped.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It's just that different people have taken over.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Some new people have come into the station and pretend to take over stopping the train, but it hasn't changed their irrelevance.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And so even though some people came on the scene in June of 2021 and said that I invented the PCR, or I invented the mRNA, and it's bad for some people, or it might be bad, or I don't know, there might be rushing it.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I work for the Human Genome Project. I know what's going on here.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000
These people came on very late, and when they came on, they came on for very specific things.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'm trying to make sure that we are not in trouble here. I'm trying to make sure that people are being forthright. Kevin McCurnan did not object to PCR as a test.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He objected to the specific parameters of the who test, and the paper that described it.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
He's fine with PCR testing as long as it works, according to him.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Then he came out on a series of things about the vaccines, about the mRNAs, but when it came down to the clones, Kevin McCurnan was very, very adamant that I was wrong.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And on three different occasions, we were on a live stream where he tried to tell me that I was wrong with new papers, and new ideas, and new new posits about why clones are no more dangerous than the natural one.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Even pretending not to understand what they were by thinking that I was saying that I was going to use, they were going to use DNA to see the pandemic.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.000
That infectious clones weren't the RNA version that David Martin has been saying over and over again exists, but not explaining why they're significant.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And that's what made it so difficult to parse this all out for everybody because it's also right there in front of your face, but he actually doesn't say it and no one else does either.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And now we're really starting to be able to put it together in a very, very succinct way.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And every time these people open their mouths, you could just kind of show them, wait, wait a minute, that doesn't jive.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And so in this case, they are giving up another piece to the puzzle.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:49.000
They are giving up the piece that says that transfection will have a whole bunch of problems that include frame shift mutations, unpredictable frame shift mutations that could be ribosome specific.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
They could be background specific. They could be tissue specific.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Heck, they could even be circadian rhythm specific. We don't know.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.000
But these frame shift mutations are exacerbated by the chemical alteration of the mRNA and by the codon optimization of it.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And so they're giving away another little piece of the puzzle that we were already on two years ago that was part of a list of things that we should have objected to before the DNA was ever identified.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And what you're watching is basically backpedaling. They have to absorb every piece of the narrative that we expose.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
They have to absorb it and pretend like they meant that to happen.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:41.000
And the problem is, the part that I find the most scary is that I think they have the intention of eventually the truth coming out.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:56.000
So it's very hard to discern whether our progress is our own or whether our progress is just a slow, inevitable release of the truth that we feel like we're somehow pushing forward, but in reality, we're not.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
When I'm at my darkest feeling the worst about the situation and feeling the most helpless, that's how I feel.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
That I'm afraid that they're just using me to be the mouthpiece.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And letting me slow roll it out like everybody else is. And that's it.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But I've got to have faith that we're doing better. I've got to have faith that these numbers are alive.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I've got to have faith that if it says 117, there might be 1,170 people watching right now.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That if it says 2,000 people watch my videos every day, that maybe it's 20,000 people.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I've got to have faith that something else is being distorted here, that we're not really just locked in a little closet, that Mark has not just locked in a little closet while everybody else is.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Everybody else's followers go up by 10 or 100 times what we have.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And their sub-stack support goes up by 10 or 100 times of what Mark has or subscribers to our little support staff.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, they lied to us about the pandemic potential in laboratories and badcaves and they lied to us about the status of this background signal in 2019.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
They told us that it was evidence of spread and they may or may not have used an infectious clone to lie about it.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
But I think it's a very, very straightforward way to do it.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I think that David Martin has been dancing around that story for three years intentionally to try and confuse.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And that's why why Alex Zeck was so frustrated with him on the show the other day that we watched.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Because he was saying it without saying it. He was saying it without saying it over and over and over again.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000
He wouldn't admit the implications of the biology that he was purporting to agree with because he had to argue in a legal space.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
He was working on criminal prosecution. So talking about biology is irrelevant. Something like that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
And that preserved the faith in a novel virus. It made it confusing enough so that people didn't question it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.000
That they didn't question spread even though there's no mathematical evidence for it. They didn't question asymptomatic.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:19.000
But that's all part of the issue. If he says that they were going to use coronavirus to control people, that they were going to use coronavirus as the excuse.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.000
But he doesn't adequately explain how the excuse was going to manifest, how they were going to use it to bamboozle us.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Then he's effectively not helping us and instead preserving the faith. That's exactly what he did.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:39.000
We've got to get him to stop lying. That's what we need to do.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
We've got to get our kids off of this train, ladies and gentlemen. We've got to get our kids off this train.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And I think the strategy to dispel this mythology is to revisit the role of sanitation, nutrition and better medicine into the client of disease for polio, for measles and everything.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:09.000
We've got to recalculate the all-cause mortality during 2020 and 2021 using death certificates, using VAERS data, just like Jessica Hockett wants to do, just like John Bodewin has shown can be done.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:16.000
We need to reevaluate the role of criminal negligence in the use of transfection as a vaccine because the people should have known.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
They did know. The people that our professional biologists should have known.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000
If they didn't know and they need to be slapped in the head, and if they were being paid to know, then they need to be put in jail.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Restore strict liability to all vaccine products. That's just like any other drug that you see on television that's got to tell you all the shitty things are going to happen.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
If you take it, the vaccine should have to do that too. And if they come and it happens, then it's something entirely different.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:48.000
But if they got strict liability and they could be sued for things that weren't on the label, they could be sued for side effects that they weren't told could happen,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:57.000
then they would all stop this shit. So if we removed all untested EU products from use, that's another way to go, those, all those things and more need to happen.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
We need to teach our children immunology so that they understand the faith is a lie.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We need to teach them molecular biology so that they understand that the faith is a lie. We need to teach them this stuff.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And I think that's what we're going to do in 2024 because we are at a time point where human diversity is at its peak,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
and they want to take advantage of it. They want to invert our children's rights to their sovereignty to permissions.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And I think they want to do it as fast as they can. So they're going to make more and more chaos.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And so we've got to be more and more connected to one another. And that means making sure that we stop all transfections in healthy humans.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
That we build our communities to prevent the elimination of the control group.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.000
A intra-muscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrities.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to start making an appeal for new support for the channel.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:07.000
You can support me at GigaHomeBiological.com. That website also will link you to GigaHome.Bio where the soapbox is.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Thank you very much for that, Ted. I'm trying to use it more often.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
You can find the Giga Home link there. And then if you scroll down, you can download the Stream Deck starting this week.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And then you can see our schedule. And then at the very bottom, there's a place where you can subscribe.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And really, when you're subscribing right now, you're just subscribing as a supporter.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But soon, you're going to be able to get emails. You're going to be able to book a collaborator, can book a Zoom meeting.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I just want to be sure you understand that going forward, we gave up some stuff here.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And it would be great to have some more support because I'm putting a lot more time into it.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And I want to put more time into it. And I want to become more independent. And that means, you know, support.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So I need more subscribers. I need people to step up that haven't stepped up before. And that's why I'm going to ask for.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for sharing my work because that's the best way to support me.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And the more people that shared my work, of course, the less support I would need. So it's just kind of all one big, you know, happy family thing.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
So thank you very much. I'll see you again soon.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
What did I give up? Hmm, that's interesting.
