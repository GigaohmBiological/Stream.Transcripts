00:18.278 --> 00:18.742
bzzzzz

00:38.874 --> 00:46.257
In the last few years, video and other content created with artificial intelligence has begun to flood almost every part of the internet.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.818
And on social media, it's almost unavoidable.

00:49.338 --> 00:54.140
William Brangham takes a deep dive now into the world of what's known as AI slop.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.842
Have you seen these cats competing in Olympic diving?

01:01.123 --> 01:01.603
What about this?

01:02.566 --> 01:10.695
a baby who somehow gets control of a jumbo jet, or this security camera footage of bunnies enjoying a homeowner's trampoline.

01:11.435 --> 01:15.900
Each of those has been seen hundreds of millions of times, and they are all fake.

01:16.481 --> 01:20.705
They're a type of artificially generated content that is flooding social media.

01:21.266 --> 01:22.687
Critics have dubbed it A.I.

01:22.807 --> 01:25.070
slop because it's quick and easy to produce,

01:25.495 --> 01:27.476
and created by artificial intelligence.

01:28.036 --> 01:43.223
It's the stuff that you see in your feed that you didn't necessarily ask for, that looks a little bit off, that was clearly generated quite quickly and quite cheaply, and is usually designed to be scrolled through for a small amount of engagement and then moved past.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.024
It's not just flying babies and bouncing bunnies.

01:46.484 --> 01:51.006
Some of the fakery is being posted from the most powerful office in the country.

01:51.226 --> 01:56.328
Breaking now, President Donald J. Trump has announced a historic new health care system.

01:56.848 --> 02:04.571
President Trump shared this fake video meant to look like a Fox News segment of him promoting a nonexistent medical technology.

02:04.811 --> 02:08.113
Every American will soon receive their own MedBed card.

02:08.913 --> 02:16.376
And this fake video of Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office, plus other more clearly phony images.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.597
Trump is king as Pope.

02:19.130 --> 02:21.291
as a buff Jedi knight from Star Wars.

02:22.371 --> 02:29.032
Democrats do it, too, most notably California Governor Gavin Newsom, here poking fun at the president's posts.

02:29.693 --> 02:36.574
A part of the president's social media strategy is reflecting the world that his supporters and, honestly, most Americans live in.

02:36.914 --> 02:39.055
And that online world now involves A.I.

02:39.435 --> 02:39.775
slop.

02:39.935 --> 02:42.776
This so-called slop on the Internet is nothing new.

02:43.076 --> 02:48.177
You just open your e-mail inbox at any time since the Internet's inception, and you'll see spam.

02:48.777 --> 02:59.204
But starting around 2023, with the advent of free or low cost AI generating tools, it has become possible to mass produce this material with very little effort.

02:59.264 --> 03:01.966
We've always been able to manipulate images, audio and video.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.809
But what has changed is who can do it, how fast they can do it.

03:06.069 --> 03:07.350
There's zero barrier to entry.

03:07.410 --> 03:09.731
And of course, they now have distribution channels.

03:10.292 --> 03:13.654
This is anybody with a keyboard and Internet connection making

03:14.074 --> 03:21.097
any image, any video of anybody doing or saying anything, and then distributing it to the world instantaneously through social media.

03:21.157 --> 03:25.559
And that is a radically different landscape that we are facing than we have faced in the past.

03:26.019 --> 03:26.519
Like A.I.

03:26.579 --> 03:27.600
itself, A.I.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.781
image and video tools have advanced incredibly quickly.

03:30.801 --> 03:40.005
A few years ago, someone tried to animate actor Will Smith eating spaghetti, and it looked like this, deformed and glitchy and clearly not real.

03:40.882 --> 03:44.343
But today's tools, using this same benchmark, can make this.

03:45.944 --> 03:55.647
There's almost no limits to what it can do, other than limits imposed by the AI company that says, we don't want you creating certain types of content because it's either illegal or harmful.

03:56.027 --> 04:08.552
Two of the biggest players, Google and OpenAI, ban creating certain content, things that are sexually explicit, or promote things like violence or terrorism, or content that could cause someone to hurt themselves.

04:09.107 --> 04:11.530
but many have found ways around those guardrails.

04:13.552 --> 04:18.018
Now, it's important to note that not all AI-generated content is considered slop.

04:18.318 --> 04:22.744
Some artists and musicians have embraced this frontier using these tools.

04:23.672 --> 04:31.156
AI Slop in particular is typically made at scale to try and draw eyeballs online and thus earn money for its creators.

04:31.417 --> 04:43.764
The kinds of people who make Slop tend to be entrepreneurs and hustlers often in relatively low or middle income countries that have good knowledge of English and a lot of widespread internet connectivity.

04:44.324 --> 04:49.467
So you see it a lot in India, Pakistan, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil.

04:50.768 --> 04:58.412
pretty hardworking guys trying to make a buck off of a business proposition that has been offered to them by Facebook itself or by TikTok itself.

05:00.854 --> 05:04.436
The best performing material plays on strong emotional responses.

05:04.955 --> 05:06.656
like sympathy or fear.

05:07.277 --> 05:11.519
The very things that you are most likely to click on is by design.

05:12.020 --> 05:18.244
You are being manipulated to steal your time, your attention, and so that these companies can deliver you ads.

05:18.644 --> 05:23.468
The tech giants are betting that these AI videos can help keep you glued to their platforms.

05:23.668 --> 05:31.013
Both Meta and OpenAI recently announced consumer-friendly ways to create and... And so...

05:32.902 --> 05:47.372
Notice that the sort of narrative that's being pushed on PBS NewsHour right now is that an unstoppable force, an unmitigated force, an ungoverned force has been unleashed, and to a large extent,

05:48.232 --> 05:53.816
if wanted to be used nefariously, it could be, and we have no way of controlling it.

05:54.397 --> 05:59.000
And the only reason why it's being permitted is because they can make money off of ads.

05:59.080 --> 06:06.686
The same reason why Joe Rogan gets $250 million contracts with Spotify, because they can make money with ads.

06:06.746 --> 06:15.033
The same reason why, I don't know, PBS Frontline does all kinds of coverage of Steve Bannon and RFK, because they can make money with ads.

06:15.153 --> 06:17.214
I don't know, it always seems to be the same thing.

06:18.075 --> 06:21.376
they can control people with money and they can make money with ads.

06:21.436 --> 06:29.859
And so it's a very small little ecosystem of circle where, where people make money with ads and then they influence people with the money and then they make people money with ads.

06:29.919 --> 06:43.023
And sometimes there's a little step in between where somebody has to buy kids and sell them or, or buy girls and sell them and then take pictures and then they make money and control people and then make more money and control people and stuff like that.

06:44.255 --> 06:53.003
And so they want you to believe that AI is something that they've lost control of and they've lost control of it because all of these corporations just want to make money.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.607
Watch short form AI videos.

06:58.447 --> 07:04.653
In addition to the environmental toll from this technology, AI requires huge amounts of electricity and water.

07:05.097 --> 07:12.086
Critics say AI slop just further supercharges the stew of confusion and misleading content on the internet.

07:12.386 --> 07:14.369
And nobody really wants that, right?

07:14.469 --> 07:20.937
I mean, it's just that because we're so free and because the internet is so free, that's the way it is.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.162
Nobody could want it that way.

07:23.262 --> 07:25.063
Nobody would use that nefariously.

07:25.143 --> 07:37.310
Nobody would lead you to believe that AI content is dangerous and at the same time completely ignore a whole cast of actors on the internet enacting a theater that makes you believe something real is happening there.

07:38.591 --> 07:49.598
They want you to focus on the AI cartoons and stuff like that instead of the paid actors on the internet, the paid podcast actors on national security scripts.

07:51.018 --> 07:54.065
that he interviews and thinks are real people, for example.

07:57.099 --> 08:00.901
creates yet another hook that keeps people lost in their phones.

08:01.441 --> 08:02.501
We live online now.

08:02.701 --> 08:09.044
And again, we live online now, we're lost on our phones now, and it's no fault of anyone's.

08:09.084 --> 08:24.830
You know, it's just these greedy corporations, and the government's not allowed to step in because we have a democracy and a republic, and it's free here, and we have free speech, and corporations are people, so they're free, and so, you know, this is just the way the shitty world is.

08:26.158 --> 08:30.726
has all kinds of pandemic viruses and algorithms that want to destroy us.

08:33.436 --> 08:38.140
and suddenly this online environment has been filled with a much higher volume of slop.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.924
On your typical Instagram Reels session, you're looking at 20 different videos.

08:42.964 --> 08:49.950
We are actually defaulting to the way that we're going to communicate is with social media, and social media sucks.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.152
That's basically the message here.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.795
Social media is terrible, and there's nothing we can do about it.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.337
We just kind of have to do it.

09:00.066 --> 09:01.807
You can see where this is going, I hope.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.508
And 15 of those videos now are AI slop videos.

09:05.968 --> 09:15.150
That's 15 chances that you're missing to connect with a friend of yours, to learn something new, to find some joke that you can send to the group chat, you know, and forge a new bond with people over.

09:15.871 --> 09:21.152
And critics argue, yet another tool that- So again, that guy's not arguing getting offline.

09:21.192 --> 09:25.293
That guy's, you know, arguing finding a good joke to share with the group chat.

09:25.914 --> 09:27.074
How stupid is that?

09:28.123 --> 09:32.705
Are we seriously gonna fight AI by group chatting with each other on Signal?

09:33.385 --> 09:36.027
Or sharing memes with each other on WhatsApp?

09:36.387 --> 09:38.228
Is that really what he's saying?

09:38.648 --> 09:40.509
Because that's just plain retarded.

09:40.949 --> 09:49.593
So, so far we've heard from two, I don't know, are they 30-something or 20-something white boys that have, I guess, substacks or books?

09:50.313 --> 09:55.936
And those are the other two guys that PBS NewsHour is giving a voice to about this?

09:56.736 --> 09:58.663
Max Reed and this other dude?

09:59.125 --> 09:59.506
Really?

10:00.529 --> 10:01.029
Wow.

10:01.349 --> 10:17.135
And we're supposed to take this seriously, rather than as a direct sign that America is being sabotaged, as a direct sign that, from all sides, America is being sabotaged, the history of it, the culture of it, the direction of it, and the future of it.

10:17.715 --> 10:22.217
Ladies and gentlemen, we owe it to our kids to wake up and apologize and do something about this.

10:22.797 --> 10:26.638
WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT, MONROE COUNTY, FLORIDA, TODAY.

10:39.013 --> 10:39.753
Wait, what?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.213
Hold on a second.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.034
I went past something here, didn't I?

10:44.994 --> 10:46.715
Oh no, wait, I still didn't do it.

10:46.935 --> 10:48.695
Okay, hold on one second.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.335
I gotta insert something here.

10:50.655 --> 10:52.156
Darn it, I made a mistake.

10:53.316 --> 10:55.596
But I'm so good because I got it right here.

10:56.597 --> 10:59.037
That should be, right?

10:59.077 --> 11:00.898
That should have been the thing that I want.

11:01.238 --> 11:02.738
So I'm gonna copy that out of here.

11:02.798 --> 11:05.699
Then I can close this and put this here.

11:06.439 --> 11:07.239
This should have been there.

11:08.444 --> 11:10.261
Like that, and in the center.

11:12.279 --> 11:15.761
and playback automatically, volume high.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.342
Okay, so this is how it should have gone.

11:17.382 --> 11:18.583
Sorry about that, my bad.

11:18.643 --> 11:21.345
Not always the best video DJ.

11:21.365 --> 11:23.666
So what it would have done, it would have done this.

11:23.806 --> 11:30.411
We talk about how PBS NewsHour is making it all AI generated content to be feared, but actors on social media are irrelevant.

11:30.431 --> 11:37.715
And then telling us how we don't have any control over this AI slop and it wastes our time and it stops us from finding, I don't know,

11:39.076 --> 11:43.419
Jokes to share with our friends and everybody's seen these AI videos.

11:43.499 --> 11:44.759
How does that happen?

11:45.180 --> 11:52.083
Is it by you know, it's just because the way the world is just like pandemic viruses It's all the same bullshit, right?

11:52.944 --> 11:54.985
And of course, we know that that's not the case.

11:55.025 --> 12:01.049
They already told us probably what the script is already in a freaking video game about 15 years ago and

12:05.063 --> 12:08.345
Raiden, are you having fun playing with the new AI toys?

12:09.046 --> 12:09.766
Well, yeah, I am.

12:09.886 --> 12:13.589
You can make pictures of cute anime girls and... Enjoy it while it lasts, Raiden.

12:13.929 --> 12:14.409
What do you mean?

12:14.970 --> 12:20.313
Did you really think that civilians would be granted unrestricted access to such powerful military weapons forever?

12:20.754 --> 12:21.654
Military weapons?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.916
Are you implying that this technology was created by the government?

12:25.156 --> 12:25.917
Of course it was.

12:26.417 --> 12:32.181
This AI technology has been used by the intelligence agencies to warp the public's perception of reality for years.

12:32.722 --> 12:34.723
All in the name of national security, of course.

12:35.043 --> 12:38.465
But why would they suddenly make the tech public and let everyone start using it?

12:38.865 --> 12:40.466
Why would we indeed, Raiden?

12:40.906 --> 12:41.106
What?

12:41.346 --> 12:41.546
Who?

12:41.766 --> 12:42.647
What in the hell are you?

12:43.047 --> 12:44.288
Your question is irrelevant.

12:44.828 --> 12:51.731
By creating a new problem, we can cultivate a desired reaction to it in order to manufacture consent for our preferred solutions.

12:52.251 --> 12:54.713
In short, it's justification for a war.

12:55.233 --> 12:55.673
A war?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.154
On who or what?

12:57.794 --> 12:59.277
a war on misinformation.

12:59.857 --> 13:04.925
By arming the public with these AI weapons, everyone becomes a potential enemy combatant.

13:05.446 --> 13:08.791
Then we will have justification for unprecedented security measures.

13:09.232 --> 13:11.816
It all comes down to confusion and identity, right?

13:12.117 --> 13:12.557
Identity?

13:13.138 --> 13:13.698
Identity.

13:14.078 --> 13:16.600
This AI technology is Pandora's box.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.921
Pretty soon the internet will be mired in total illusion.

13:20.501 --> 13:24.783
Perfect AI speech, audio and video synthesis will drown out reality.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.624
Then AI bots will flood social media.

13:28.125 --> 13:33.627
No one will be able to tell the difference between interacting with an AI machine or a real human online.

13:34.027 --> 13:37.069
Even telephone calls will become totally untrustworthy.

13:37.749 --> 13:39.670
That is when we will present our solution.

13:40.723 --> 13:45.305
Mandatory digital identity verification for all humans, at all times.

13:45.825 --> 13:52.207
The only way to ensure that you're dealing with a real flesh-and-blood human being, and not an AI-generated mirage.

13:52.787 --> 13:53.247
But why?

13:53.727 --> 13:55.348
Total information control.

13:55.828 --> 13:59.029
For too long, the internet has acted as a double-edged sword.

13:59.469 --> 14:07.852
Its potential for anonymous user activity allows anyone at all to spread any thoughts, ideas, or information patterns that they please, with impunity.

14:08.372 --> 14:15.335
State secrets, dangerous ideas, ludicrous conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation.

14:15.976 --> 14:19.017
Until now, there has been no easy solution to this problem.

14:19.617 --> 14:24.159
Our digital identity platform will finally put an end to anonymity online.

14:24.740 --> 14:31.903
It will allow us to trace misinformation and other dangerous communications to its source and exact appropriate justice.

14:32.591 --> 14:33.231
That's crap!

14:33.612 --> 14:35.472
I won't go along with it and others will resist!

14:35.893 --> 14:37.293
You won't have a choice, Raiden.

14:37.774 --> 14:42.376
Do you think your bank is willing to risk doing business with an artificial human instead of a real one?

14:43.136 --> 14:50.500
Our digital identity platform will be required not only to access web services, but to pay for your internet connection in the first place.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.522
You can't just censor the entire internet because of a new software technology.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.603
Who are you to define what's misinformation anyways?

14:58.043 --> 15:01.205
That sounds like something a misinformation terrorist would say.

15:01.545 --> 15:04.086
I know about the deep fakes you've been making of me, Raiden.

15:04.946 --> 15:05.106
What?

15:05.486 --> 15:06.187
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:06.227 --> 15:11.388
I was just adjusting the AI settings and... Controlling the output of generative AI technology is simple.

15:12.149 --> 15:14.229
We will create context for its use.

15:14.909 --> 15:18.110
First, we will censor any use related to social taboos.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.951
Then we will censor anything else that we desire.

15:21.392 --> 15:26.593
If anyone complains, we will accuse them of wanting to engage in or promote social taboos.

15:26.853 --> 15:28.574
That's what it means to create context.

15:28.991 --> 15:42.776
We will corral the use of AI by making... I don't know, maybe imagine a scenario where an AI generated pedophile video comes out that goes around the internet and everybody thinks is real and then suddenly we find out that it's not real.

15:43.637 --> 15:45.418
And that somebody's life was damaged.

15:46.098 --> 15:49.639
Or that the politics of a country were changed by an AI video.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.901
I mean, the possibilities are almost endless.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.850
appeals to bias, ethics, and copyright laws.

15:58.450 --> 16:06.318
You will still have access to generative AI in some form, but it will be crippled, limited, controlled, and it will be monitored.

16:06.878 --> 16:16.548
Anything that you generate will be cryptographically signed with your digital ID, so that its provenance can be ascertained if it's later deemed to be problematic.

16:17.188 --> 16:20.330
What gives you the right to control what people can do with their computers?

16:20.771 --> 16:26.815
The public at large will give us that right, because they will be desperate for a solution to the problem we created.

16:27.576 --> 16:29.897
They will eagerly give us the keys to the castle.

16:30.438 --> 16:34.461
Then, we alone will define what is fiction and what is reality.

17:37.927 --> 17:42.529
Let me introduce

18:02.622 --> 18:15.092
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science.

18:55.848 --> 18:56.530
Oh my god

19:54.848 --> 20:08.398
I'm just looking for another good time.

20:48.065 --> 21:16.376
When we started this band, all we needed, needed was a land Years gone by, I say we've kicked some ass But now it rains, you're here on the stage Traveling the world, you're through my veins And I say, we're still kicking ass

21:23.942 --> 21:25.084
Oh, yeah!

22:00.021 --> 22:19.186
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

22:56.135 --> 22:58.877
Holy cow, I blew my ears out on that one.

22:58.897 --> 23:02.019
That one can really make me pound my feet on the floor.

23:02.079 --> 23:06.461
It's just... If you can hear it, it's a hard rockin' tune.

23:07.062 --> 23:09.043
It's a hard rockin' tune, ladies and gentlemen.

23:09.591 --> 23:10.412
Welcome to the show.

23:10.472 --> 23:19.980
This is GigaOM Biological High Resistance Low Noise Information Brief coming to you from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where we seek the truth together from the back of my garage.

23:20.020 --> 23:30.390
I know that sounds a little silly, but actually, I've been an academic biologist for most of my adult life, chasing my PhD in Amsterdam, meeting my wife there.

23:30.430 --> 23:32.912
We moved to Norway, where these pictures were taken.

23:32.952 --> 23:35.454
You can find the trail of tears that is my

23:36.515 --> 23:56.684
long academic career on the National Library of Medicine's website PubMed, using my last name and first two initials, including the paper or two that I helped write and review the papers with regard to drastic and the time when I was still fooled by a lot of the biology that I now see as mythology.

23:56.724 --> 23:59.246
I've tried to teach these kinds of

24:00.226 --> 24:03.967
I don't know, concepts and ideas to a group called Panda at least three times.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.707
They lost all those presentations.

24:05.807 --> 24:17.130
Instead, Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler, among others, have been masquerading as people with good ideas and writing substacks and books about stuff that they gleaned from those three presentations.

24:17.190 --> 24:22.391
I presented to the medical doctors for COVID ethics no less than seven times.

24:22.451 --> 24:23.311
I presented to the

24:24.071 --> 24:25.933
other split off group of that.

24:26.433 --> 24:33.320
At the beginning of the pandemic, there was only one Doctors for COVID Ethics, but in 2020, I believe, is already when that group split in two.

24:33.900 --> 24:39.365
And I presented to Doctors for COVID Ethics, but Michael Palmer lost that presentation as well.

24:40.506 --> 24:50.170
I presented to NCI, but like 7 million people have presented to NCI, so by the time you figure out which, you know, talks and which information is worth listening to, that's useless.

24:50.911 --> 24:55.393
The wellness company, yeah, they tried to get me to wear one of their lab coats once, but they're not...

24:56.013 --> 25:00.255
bad people, they're just making money and they're pretty straightforward about that.

25:00.315 --> 25:04.517
So wellness company is definitely not one of the worst operators in this.

25:04.897 --> 25:13.742
I think Children's Health Defense probably is because they are a front organization for a number of national security actors that are ultimately behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.423
I think it's very possible that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:16.583 --> 25:20.825
actually is a drug addict and a sex addict or whatever that means.

25:21.525 --> 25:24.107
Somebody who's so simple that he could be controlled

25:25.688 --> 25:36.278
by his penis, I guess is possible, but also by drugs and also by flattery and also by just having a bunch of paid actors around him telling him he's doing the right thing.

25:37.019 --> 25:39.502
Ultimately, they tried to make me one of those paid actors.

25:39.522 --> 25:44.807
You can see the result of that work in the Wuhan cover-up, a book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.629
It's actually written by about 20 people.

25:46.729 --> 25:47.289
I was one of them.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.432
And I'm coming out to tell you that that book is a fraud.

25:50.472 --> 26:17.410
It's a scripted fraud It's part of a national security operation that was designed to suck in as many unwitting participants as possible And I think a lot of people tried to suck me into it I think they focused more energy and time on me than they focused on a lot of other people I found myself at one point at the red pill Expo and I thought Joe Bannister was actually a really good guy and I still think he probably is he's one of those people that just

26:18.070 --> 26:20.093
you know, sticks to his part of the narrative.

26:21.555 --> 26:22.516
I tend not to be.

26:22.536 --> 26:34.812
I tend to be a guy who just kind of sticks his head up as an adult with something to say and tries to, I don't know, bring attention to the fact that a lot of people contradict themselves over the last five years.

26:34.832 --> 26:35.833
And I'm also training

26:36.734 --> 26:40.436
on my body again, because I want to teach biology from the basketball court.

26:40.456 --> 26:48.099
I have a dream of being a pro basketball player at the age of 54, even if that pro basketball player is a different kind of pro.

26:48.619 --> 26:58.443
Technically speaking, if I'm making money on the basketball court and putting food on the table on the basketball court, then technically that would make me a pro basketball player.

26:59.203 --> 27:09.731
And I know this is, you know, I'm kind of trying to follow the example or the evidence, the advice of the character from Game of Thrones.

27:09.751 --> 27:15.436
You have to own who you are and wear it as armor so that nobody can use it against you.

27:16.176 --> 27:26.004
And so in that sense, I have been declared chemtrail retarded, or at least my ideas about clones have been declared chemtrail retarded, and I have been called Barrick's bitch boy.

27:26.764 --> 27:31.970
by the former Research and Development Director of the Human Genome Project 1, Kevin McKernan.

27:32.611 --> 27:38.598
This might be the highlight of my career as a biologist after 25 years or so chasing the golden ring.

27:39.239 --> 27:40.981
This might be what the golden ring looks like.

27:41.021 --> 27:41.862
I'm okay with that.

27:42.403 --> 27:45.707
I'm okay with the highlight of my career not being

27:47.107 --> 28:09.974
Mentioned by a Nobel Prize winner in their acceptance speech, but instead being declared Barrick's boy and my ideas chemtrail retarded I think is quite absolutely absolutely spectacular Thanks for being here ladies and gentlemen again If you want to support the show go to gig oh and biological comm find a way to do so if you want to get notified the notification system is not perfect because

28:11.014 --> 28:23.438
My partner in crime, my wife, best friend, mother of my kids, has a lot of other things to do and she's now picked up a remote day job, which does cost quite a bit of time and energy as she's trying to bring herself up to speed with this new job.

28:24.098 --> 28:30.780
And so notifications are hit and miss, but she does try and you're never gonna get a notification if you don't send that email.

28:30.880 --> 28:38.663
So otherwise, please download the PeerTube app and then use stream.gigaom.bio as your PeerTube

28:39.864 --> 28:47.211
Platform and Bob's Your Uncle you'll have all these streams directly on your phone with no No glitching.

28:47.311 --> 28:48.852
No, no extra videos.

28:48.872 --> 28:51.475
They're not gonna offer you a bunch of dumb other things.

28:51.555 --> 28:56.740
Just just this that's it When you want it, you could just click on it on your phone and listen

29:16.906 --> 29:18.387
Don't we have a divided country?

29:19.308 --> 29:22.791
It's kind of sad that it's as bad as it is.

29:24.952 --> 29:27.715
Although, you know, I kind of wonder,

29:28.874 --> 29:46.688
Really, if it's as bad as it seems sometimes, because I don't know about you, but as you go about your normal day and hang out with your friends and meet people you don't even know yet, maybe for the most part, or at work and everything, I doubt that you're just constantly fighting with people.

29:47.548 --> 29:49.430
If you are, maybe you need to check yourself.

29:51.251 --> 29:58.137
I think a lot of it is just media driven, of course, as we know, and a lot of it is

29:59.611 --> 30:28.101
kind of the in the virtual world and also the reason why I'm showing you this is this old man is actually a respected youtuber with a lot of followers and so he has been kind of isolated as a celebrity for some time I'm quite sure that he can't go into public in certain places without being recognized he might be like the outdoor dad or the outdoor boys guy he might be like

30:29.321 --> 30:34.365
You know, the Dude Perfect dudes can't go anywhere anymore without being recognized.

30:34.385 --> 30:37.887
There's a lot of people on YouTube that, you know, have a lot of followers.

30:37.967 --> 30:42.250
Mr. Beast, for example, is another dude who, if you saw him in Walmart, you'd probably know who he was.

30:42.710 --> 30:47.714
And this guy's following is very... I mean, I've followed this guy for like 10 years already.

30:48.314 --> 30:48.975
He's Hickok45.

30:50.296 --> 30:52.197
And what he's talking about is the internet.

30:52.217 --> 31:05.508
But what I want you to listen to as you listen to this very thoughtful and wise old man talk about the idea that the division is on the internet, I want you to hear how absent the real explanation is.

31:05.648 --> 31:08.530
He thinks it's because they want to sell ads.

31:08.970 --> 31:12.273
He thinks it's because they want to keep you on their scroll.

31:12.713 --> 31:15.635
He thinks it's just about attention time.

31:15.776 --> 31:17.037
And to a certain extent,

31:17.881 --> 31:19.802
especially with your children, it is.

31:20.802 --> 31:40.730
It is to get you to waste your time so that you don't do something useful, so that you don't send a useful email, so that you don't apply for that nonprofit, or you don't apply for that license, that you don't apply for that LLC or that trademark, or that you don't scan that book, but instead you watch that AI Slop video.

31:40.870 --> 31:43.791
Sure, to a certain extent, that is part of

31:44.571 --> 31:59.900
But what I think is so extraordinary is that everybody who is skillfully using social media, including and especially creators, because creators have a false sense of how much they are moving

32:00.800 --> 32:07.328
the goal posts, how much they are moving the sticks, if you will, in football, the down markers.

32:07.849 --> 32:16.620
So people who make content regularly and have made content regularly on YouTube have the feeling that they are part of the engine that moves us.

32:17.918 --> 32:28.561
And so you're going to hear part of that in his dialogue, that he feels an obligation to be extra good, to set an extra clear example of behavior on the internet.

32:29.001 --> 32:36.183
And why the internet could be so dangerous is because, again, remember what we talked about yesterday with regard to all of these phenomenon.

32:36.863 --> 32:39.564
Generally speaking, there's two sides of the phenomenon.

32:40.304 --> 32:44.505
And it's either that there are, it's just the way people are,

32:45.445 --> 32:50.346
or there is some small subset of bad guys on there that's ruining it for the rest of us.

32:50.866 --> 33:00.609
So it could be that, you know, it's just the way people are, that there's a pandemic, or it could be that there's just a small number of people that are making viruses and ruining it for everybody else.

33:01.789 --> 33:05.730
It could be that, that, that, uh, um,

33:07.782 --> 33:22.609
I don't know, that there are terrorists out there and they can make plans and crash into buildings or it could be an even bigger plan with people with lots of money and maybe a particular religion that can do the same thing.

33:24.230 --> 33:27.792
And so it's either out of your control or it's way out of your control.

33:29.383 --> 33:33.885
And so in this case, with the internet, again, it seems like it's way out of our control.

33:34.285 --> 33:36.025
It's because it's just the way people are.

33:36.605 --> 33:40.367
And maybe we would augment that with a few nefarious actors.

33:41.007 --> 33:49.910
But no one, no one, especially people who produce content can perceive of the concept that they have been competing with.

33:51.226 --> 34:12.707
fake content that they have been competing with artificial content content that's not just some guy with a lot of property and a lot of guns who's very charming and very good shot and has hung up enough iron in his backyard to make pretty good videos and and has done that consistently for 15 years he imagines that he's part of this

34:14.392 --> 34:22.996
spontaneous, randomly growing community of people making stuff on the internet, and then there's just some bad parts of it that we should try and fix.

34:23.536 --> 34:27.478
And if everybody would just, you know, be better, then the internet would be better.

34:27.618 --> 34:38.884
He can't conceive of the idea that the anger, the division, the frustration, the contradiction is actually being purposefully generated by actors on the internet.

34:40.009 --> 34:49.475
At best, he's imagining that these corporate social media companies are allowing it to happen because they can make more money if it's allowed to happen.

34:50.796 --> 34:57.500
And I need you to understand that they are also going to fool our children with that same illusion that the internet is harmless.

34:57.580 --> 35:00.062
It's the people on the internet that are bad.

35:00.782 --> 35:03.044
The internet is a great thing.

35:03.104 --> 35:06.286
It's just unfortunate that so many people use it like shit.

35:06.726 --> 35:07.847
You see the difference here?

35:08.826 --> 35:11.529
Sorry for the swear words, but sometimes they just flow out.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.831
I try to stick to the S word only.

35:13.851 --> 35:19.857
I know there are some sensitive ears, that's why I always put the, you know, the warning label above.

35:20.217 --> 35:32.288
I'm probably never gonna say, you know, some of the harshest words in the English language again on my stream, but I probably will say shit repeatedly and shithead repeatedly, just so you know, in case you're a first-time viewer.

35:32.308 --> 35:33.389
Social media, of course.

35:34.614 --> 35:38.876
where it's so easy to be divisive, where it's so easy to be angry.

35:39.196 --> 35:49.740
You know, I don't know if as many people are truly and realistically that angry walking down the street.

35:49.960 --> 35:50.821
Now, maybe they are.

35:51.881 --> 35:52.621
Maybe they are.

35:53.342 --> 35:58.283
But I just still think it's it's a lot of it is a kind of a media concoction.

35:58.343 --> 36:01.185
It's a in and not just from the media.

36:01.225 --> 36:01.945
I mean, it's us, too.

36:02.406 --> 36:13.555
because it's so easy for us to express it, you know, social media, uh, you know, just like me on this camera, uh, I can get revved up about something and, and post it.

36:14.215 --> 36:22.002
Whereas I'm not talking to a real person, you know, I could, I could say a lot of, uh, insulting things and, and go crazy.

36:22.302 --> 36:27.326
You know, it's a little bit easier as I sit here in the woods or somebody sits in their living room or,

36:28.207 --> 36:32.891
in their bedroom and talks to a camera or in the back of their garage or phone.

36:35.043 --> 36:36.664
angry, you know, comments.

36:36.884 --> 36:45.630
So again, he thinks it's just random people that, you know, get together and get angry or decide to post stuff to get views and get angry.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.910
And it's easy to do it.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.292
And so it's unfortunate.

36:49.892 --> 37:03.801
But one thing I would really like to say to my friend, Hickok 45, is that you've got to understand that the military industrial complex, the government, the government, and also probably a lot of private interests

37:04.878 --> 37:27.960
have been and will continue to place actors on social media, podcast actors that circulate through podcasts, podcast actors that host podcasts, and content creators that will be scripted to do certain things at certain times, say certain things at certain times, and the rest of the time they might be working on their own stuff.

37:28.988 --> 37:30.189
They could be doing yoga.

37:30.629 --> 37:33.090
They could be doing machining.

37:33.171 --> 37:34.852
They could be doing model trains.

37:34.952 --> 37:40.495
As long as when Charlie Kirk is shot, they are told what to say and they mention it.

37:41.796 --> 37:44.017
Oh, I saw a video by Candace Owens.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.898
I think Candace Owens is pretty interesting.

37:46.258 --> 37:51.922
That might already be enough of a script for somebody who has a, I don't know, FPV drone channel.

37:54.281 --> 38:02.162
to get paid and to get supported, to be out there to make sure that their 100,000 subscribers, if they think at all about Charlie Kirk, they think this.

38:03.663 --> 38:23.490
Now these are pretty rudimentary examples, but what I need you to see, what I want you to see so that you can start articulating this to other people, especially your children, is that we are being led to believe by witting and unwitting participants that the dangers on the internet are the algorithms.

38:23.570 --> 38:26.452
The dangers on the internet are the AI chatbots.

38:26.932 --> 38:29.133
The dangers on the internet are the fake things.

38:29.193 --> 38:32.834
The dangers on the internet are the anonymous things.

38:34.858 --> 38:42.880
that enable us to be really mean and really angry to each other and say really nasty things and also produce really fake things.

38:42.960 --> 38:54.363
And so this combination of fear and uncertainty and doubt is going to be used to coerce us to accept something like a digital ID.

38:54.383 --> 38:55.363
I'm pretty sure of that.

38:56.872 --> 39:09.978
They might have a couple teenagers commit suicide so that, you know, we blame it on the anonymous chat that we find on their phone the day before they committed suicide, where all these people were telling them to commit suicide.

39:10.038 --> 39:12.600
It turns out none of those people were at the school they go to.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.880
And so it's a real tragedy.

39:14.901 --> 39:19.663
And the only way we're going to be able to protect these kids is to control the age of people on social media.

39:19.683 --> 39:26.026
And so first, social media might become age gated, but that will also require a digital ID, won't it?

39:28.806 --> 39:32.210
And so again, I'm just trying to say that I think people see it.

39:32.310 --> 39:39.758
I think people understand that what's on social media is fake, but what they don't seem to see is that the only way to avoid it is to get off.

39:41.119 --> 39:49.809
PBS NewsHour wants you to believe that the AI slop problem is unavoidable, but it's not because there will never be any AI slop on my PeerTube channel.

39:51.527 --> 39:56.028
There will never be any AI Slop posted by me on my Soapbox.

39:56.068 --> 40:04.571
So if you just follow me on my Soapbox using Mastodon or Soapbox or anything else, then the posts you'll get will just be from me communicating in text.

40:05.091 --> 40:07.351
And if you go to PeerTube, you're going to get my videos.

40:07.391 --> 40:10.472
And if the video has AI Slop, I will be using it for a reason.

40:13.373 --> 40:18.594
And you will have complete control over what you watch because you'll have my PeerTube app.

40:18.635 --> 40:20.275
And if you don't want to watch it, you don't open it.

40:22.045 --> 40:25.247
The thing is, when you open YouTube, you are offered things.

40:25.307 --> 40:28.949
When you scroll X, you are forced to read things.

40:29.469 --> 40:39.675
When you, I don't know, when you browse Substack, I think you're also kind of forced to read things and select from something that you are not selecting from just your followers.

40:39.735 --> 40:47.199
And that all is submission to your consciousness being governed by somebody else.

40:48.237 --> 40:51.785
But it's not random, and it's not just because they want clicks.

40:51.865 --> 40:54.390
It's not just because they want to make money.

40:54.711 --> 40:57.116
It's because that's how we are being governed.

40:57.935 --> 41:06.199
And the most dangerous part of it are the deep state national security scripted actors that are on the internet.

41:06.279 --> 41:18.524
People like as diverse as Brett and Eric Weinstein and Jordan Peterson, all the way to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, and Mary Holland of Children's Health Defense.

41:19.485 --> 41:23.827
It's all one malevolent cast and it's very cheap

41:25.179 --> 41:37.066
These are not, you don't need billions and billions of dollars to populate the internet with people like Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey and George Webb and, and, and, and John Cullen and John Goodman.

41:37.106 --> 41:38.947
These are all, you know, Whitney Webb.

41:38.987 --> 41:44.350
These are extremely cheap, but very efficient psychological operations.

41:45.050 --> 41:48.793
And they don't all need to know the extent to which they are being used.

41:49.613 --> 41:52.875
They just all need to accept the script like any other actor would.

41:55.285 --> 42:06.009
And it would be great if Hickok45 would see this video and think, wow, you know, there's this really interesting dude that, uh, I really like you to watch and his, you know, 10 million people would suddenly find Giggum.

42:06.049 --> 42:06.810
Wouldn't that be cool?

42:07.650 --> 42:08.090
Or something.

42:08.170 --> 42:12.332
It's, it's just easier than, uh, than saying that to somebody.

42:12.352 --> 42:16.233
So, so a lot of it is because it's so easy, you know, especially if you're anonymous, right.

42:17.514 --> 42:18.414
Uh, I don't know.

42:18.434 --> 42:20.875
I, I, I still have more faith in humanity.

42:20.915 --> 42:23.336
I kind of think a lot of it is not real.

42:24.355 --> 42:31.117
I think, here I go philosophizing again, but you get a little bit of this right in every shooting the breeze.

42:32.798 --> 42:43.341
I just think it's so easy for us to express our anger, or our disenchantment, our outrage, and then call it outrage, and call it anger.

42:43.781 --> 42:52.103
Maybe it's not really that powerful an anger or outrage, but we keep using that word, right?

42:52.624 --> 42:53.004
I don't know.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.842
But I do think we're all in our own little camps, of course.

42:58.302 --> 43:00.544
And it's kind of human nature.

43:01.124 --> 43:05.667
You young people, yeah, I'm an old guy.

43:05.967 --> 43:07.408
I'm already kind of what I'm going to be.

43:07.428 --> 43:10.710
I'm not going to be changing a lot, right?

43:11.570 --> 43:17.614
But you young folks, let me give you some fatherly, grandfatherly, great grandfatherly advice.

43:17.714 --> 43:21.277
Try to avoid some of that if you can.

43:21.777 --> 43:22.737
Study issues.

43:24.366 --> 43:30.971
Try to look at the facts of anything, whatever it is, politics or gun rights, the whole nine yards.

43:31.332 --> 43:37.176
Look at the FBI stats and try to avoid calling people names all the time.

43:37.196 --> 43:45.282
And just know what the truth is as best we can determine it and try to speak it sensibly.

43:45.302 --> 43:50.927
And you're not gonna change anybody's mind by screaming at them or calling them names.

43:53.078 --> 44:10.573
The most important thing, I think, is to not get tied into what's going on in the big media world and social media as much as look at the facts or whatever the issue is, whatever it is, try to to be a student, a student of facts, because, you know, most of it's just a Google click away.

44:10.854 --> 44:16.478
You can find most of that and also find everything else, you know, the drama as well.

44:16.519 --> 44:16.619
But

44:18.772 --> 44:24.596
You know, that's my advice, to try to be sensible about things, calm, and look at the facts.

44:24.716 --> 44:30.520
Things are never as crazy or bad as they seem, just as they're never as good as they seem, right?

44:31.841 --> 44:34.303
Some profound philosopher said that one time.

44:36.024 --> 44:41.468
You know, it's just so easy to get into a camp, because we are kind of tribal, right?

44:41.668 --> 44:42.028
We are.

44:42.889 --> 44:46.891
And so we tend to, oh, I don't know, just sort of group up.

44:48.945 --> 44:50.286
and not think for ourselves.

44:50.566 --> 44:56.150
See, here again, he thinks that it's a phenomenon that would not be taken advantage of.

44:56.270 --> 45:11.381
But instead, what I'm trying to point out to you is that not only is that a natural phenomenon of humans, but on social media, by programming, they can make that phenomenon, weaponize that phenomenon.

45:12.557 --> 45:14.138
That's really what I'm trying to say.

45:14.298 --> 45:28.405
And what I want, would love it if Hickok 45 would realize that this is not a phenomenon of human nature so much as a phenomenon of human nature that can be weaponized because of our skilled use of social media.

45:31.506 --> 45:34.828
And there's a lot of power in that, a lot of good feeling in that.

45:35.148 --> 45:40.651
If, if I'm hanging out with people who think just like I do and, uh, or maybe,

45:41.269 --> 45:42.950
I'm looking for a way to think.

45:43.030 --> 45:46.152
I'm looking for a group that I feel comfortable with.

45:46.252 --> 45:50.014
And man, these people, I like their style, man.

45:50.054 --> 45:50.915
They're dramatic.

45:51.975 --> 45:53.256
They really know what they think.

45:53.276 --> 45:54.156
They know the truth.

45:54.236 --> 45:55.757
My gosh, are they confident.

45:55.937 --> 46:01.341
And boy, they're outraged, yeah, but they have reason to be outraged.

46:01.541 --> 46:03.682
They seem to know what's going on.

46:05.089 --> 46:06.950
Sure sounds like Brian Hooker, doesn't it?

46:07.350 --> 46:09.491
Sure sounds like Mary Holland, doesn't it?

46:09.551 --> 46:15.794
And Polly Tommy and, and Del Bigtree really just sounds exactly like them.

46:17.274 --> 46:20.415
You're, you know, it's just so easy to fall into that, isn't it?

46:20.476 --> 46:33.421
And we all do to some extent anyway, even second amendment issues, you know, we're mostly, if you're watching this, you're, you're part of that tribe, probably second amendment supporter, you know, uh, just like John and me, uh,

46:34.440 --> 46:38.262
We could even be that way, you know, I mean, we can be name callers.

46:38.922 --> 46:52.068
You know, I was listening to Tom Gresham this week or last week, whenever he was, he was talking about in one of his recent podcasts about his attendance at the, in his speech at the gun rights conference in Chicago.

46:52.088 --> 46:52.968
And I almost went to that.

46:52.988 --> 46:54.129
I think I'm going to go next year.

46:55.029 --> 46:57.673
a gun rights conference in Chicago.

46:57.753 --> 47:03.841
So again, he doesn't seem to see that these conferences are also kind of places where the same thing happens.

47:04.602 --> 47:08.588
And more importantly, if these conferences are places where these actors go,

47:09.540 --> 47:31.772
to find the more influential people, the more active people, and to try and steer them or recruit them to produce a particular message, or to go in a particular way, then you can see a gun rights conference is very much the same as a CHD conference, or a Health Freedom conference, or a, I don't know, whatever they were called, Cam Jams, you know?

47:31.812 --> 47:34.554
This is all Cal Jam, I don't remember.

47:35.370 --> 47:41.232
But it's all kind of a place where the same kind of playground activities can happen.

47:41.692 --> 47:45.633
But on social media, those playground activities can be personalized for you.

47:46.153 --> 47:58.037
And so then when you show up at these, these conferences where these people are, if some of them are actors, you're going to have a very inflated sense of who they are and what they're doing.

47:58.077 --> 48:02.518
And, and, and they will then reinforce that when you meet them in person.

48:03.899 --> 48:05.039
That's how this works.

48:08.140 --> 48:13.741
And so it's just really interesting to hear Hickok 45 talking about this stuff, almost.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.302
He said he was sitting there thinking about what he was going to say.

48:18.543 --> 48:28.845
And one of his common themes at that and talking to people, you know, the shakers and movers, you know, in the gun rights world, because everybody's there.

48:28.925 --> 48:34.727
I mean, a lot of people are from the GOA, the NRA and other gun rights organizations and just anybody interested.

48:36.590 --> 48:44.473
They can't afford to get away and hang out there, right, and listen to, you know, whatever speeches, go to the seminars and things, conferences.

48:45.574 --> 48:55.858
But one of his themes is to get away from insulting the liberals, quote unquote.

48:56.039 --> 49:03.702
The numbers he was quoting, I think, were that like 25% of liberals or admitted liberals are gun owners.

49:05.319 --> 49:07.920
I'm pretty sure, don't quote me on that, but I think that's what he said.

49:07.940 --> 49:11.002
I don't know where he got it, but he really keeps up with that stuff.

49:11.882 --> 49:22.368
And I know from comments that we get and conversations and messages that I hear from a lot of you who classify yourself as a liberal, a liberal voter.

49:24.207 --> 49:26.849
that you own gods and you really support the second amendment.

49:27.149 --> 49:43.358
And so I think this is also by design and I think we cannot underestimate how the conservative movement that has been brought into existence artificially on the internet is fractured in a way that we ourselves cannot be aware of.

49:45.539 --> 49:54.125
And that fracturing is something that is a danger to us only because we are participating actively in it and actively singing that harmony.

49:54.225 --> 50:03.972
If we just get off of social media and organize in a more grassroots way with email and phone numbers and open source apps,

50:06.035 --> 50:07.417
then all of this goes away.

50:07.997 --> 50:11.121
And all of their control over what we see goes away.

50:11.281 --> 50:15.286
All of their control over what questions we are asking go away.

50:17.929 --> 50:19.912
Now I'm not saying I can do it all by myself.

50:19.992 --> 50:22.655
I'm not saying that my peer tube is enough for you.

50:22.695 --> 50:25.278
I'm just saying that we as a people

50:26.229 --> 50:27.489
are capable of doing this.

50:27.529 --> 50:32.631
We're all adults and none of the people that are in front of us are extraordinary geniuses.

50:32.851 --> 50:36.092
You know that in your heart when you watch television.

50:36.112 --> 50:39.033
You're not overwhelmed by any of the people that you see.

50:39.413 --> 50:42.734
You're not overwhelmed by any of the clarity that is presented to you.

50:42.774 --> 50:47.816
You're not overwhelmed by their ability to impart information in a short amount of time.

50:51.577 --> 50:53.638
And that means the system isn't ours anymore.

50:54.554 --> 50:59.375
That means that the cruise ship isn't ours anymore, that it's going somewhere that we didn't sign up for.

50:59.835 --> 51:04.236
And he sees it, he feels it, our kids see it and feel it.

51:04.836 --> 51:09.277
We just gotta come to the most parsimonious explanation for why.

51:09.737 --> 51:10.898
By design.

51:13.718 --> 51:20.700
Now, it's easy for us, all of us, to give people a hard time if they claim to support the Second Amendment.

51:22.439 --> 51:25.661
They vote for Dianne Feinstein or Chuck Schumer or something.

51:25.941 --> 51:32.804
It just seems like a paradox, so contradictory.

51:34.845 --> 51:42.468
But it's not a contradictory paradox of any kind if all the candidates that are in front of us are already pre-selected and controlled.

51:43.408 --> 51:44.809
So who cares who they vote for?

51:46.690 --> 52:08.426
And again, this is a part of the illusion that a lot of Americans don't want to grasp onto right now, but unless you are voting by writing, unless you are voting by writing in a candidate's name, I would say that you're probably not going to be voting for a real person.

52:09.525 --> 52:23.029
And so maybe one of the strategies, I'm just coming up with this live right now, maybe one of the only strategies that could possibly work would be for everybody in Pittsburgh to vote by write-in only and write the same name in.

52:24.069 --> 52:32.551
And if an overwhelming number of people wrote in a name like Jonathan Cooey and I became mayor, that would be the way that we would go forward.

52:34.810 --> 52:47.018
Now I'm not advocating for that, I'm not saying I want that, like Ryan Cole wants to be governor of Idaho, but what I am saying is, is that if the election systems work, that would be one of the only ways to check it.

52:47.939 --> 52:57.525
Because if you're just gonna check the box and let the scanner do its thing, then the way to verify elections is like two or three people deep, and so then there's no hope.

52:58.871 --> 53:08.355
We already know, because it's been admitted, that a lot of the technology that's used to tabulate these votes is very vulnerable, simple, dumb, USB-based nonsense.

53:09.096 --> 53:21.141
And so, there's no reason to believe in the integrity of the vote, especially if you use the, let's say, designated digital card.

53:25.556 --> 53:27.418
Or even worse, you use the machine.

53:27.498 --> 53:39.290
So you gotta find a way to vote with a write-in, and then you gotta write in a candidate that isn't already on the ballot, because if they're already on the ballot, probably they have nefarious forces behind them that have put them there.

53:40.891 --> 53:48.879
That's why we have this super clown as a senator in Pennsylvania, this guy who wears sweatshirts, I don't even remember his name, Federman.

53:50.455 --> 53:58.458
That guy was in a freaking movie as an extra and had one line in a movie as an extra before he ever ran for office in Pennsylvania.

53:58.498 --> 53:59.658
That wasn't by accident.

54:00.618 --> 54:02.119
That's because that's how this is done.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.241
And he was a mayor of some small town.

54:08.281 --> 54:14.083
I mean, and then he had a stroke and now he's still somehow a dude like this is not real.

54:15.814 --> 54:19.116
But if the elections elect somebody, then we have to go with it.

54:19.176 --> 54:22.778
And so that's kind of the ritual that everybody believes in.

54:22.818 --> 54:26.981
And so in this case, he's saying, you know, it's weird how everybody votes, but it's a ritual.

54:27.021 --> 54:32.744
And once you go through the ritual, then everybody, the basis of the ritual is so that everybody accepts the outcome.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.261
That's what due process means, right?

54:36.301 --> 54:44.765
You are due a process, and so you get to go before the king and whine about it and bitch about it, and then the king makes a decision and you're gonna accept it.

54:44.785 --> 55:00.133
And that due process, the more complicated it is, the more people with funny wigs on, the more times a hammer hits a table and somebody says, that's the verdict, the more likely it is that the people that are participating will accept the outcome.

55:02.594 --> 55:12.659
And so our elections are just an elaborate ritual that gets people to accept the rulers that they are given as if the rulers are chosen.

55:12.699 --> 55:22.223
And that's definitely not the case, yet he thinks that Dianne Feinstein just runs and wins because, you know, Dianne Feinstein really likes winning.

55:23.715 --> 55:24.875
Chuck Schumer is a winner.

55:24.996 --> 55:26.356
That's why he keeps running.

55:26.636 --> 55:27.877
And that's just ridiculous.

55:28.017 --> 55:29.897
That's just ridiculous.

55:29.937 --> 55:37.060
You really think that Nancy Pelosi just keeps running because she's a public servant and she really likes to win and do stuff good?

55:37.080 --> 55:38.021
I mean, come on.

55:39.081 --> 55:40.802
But that's what he seems to believe.

55:43.643 --> 55:44.583
But I don't believe that.

55:46.424 --> 55:49.305
I don't believe that since Russ Feingold.

55:51.209 --> 55:54.951
I'm from Wisconsin, so I know we've had good people in government before.

55:55.171 --> 55:56.372
Russ Feingold was one of them.

55:56.852 --> 56:01.154
Be that as it may, we get nowhere by name calling.

56:01.535 --> 56:03.676
And I hope I don't do that.

56:05.637 --> 56:14.442
One thing this whole endeavor has taught me is how many people with varying opinions on lots of things are interested in firearms.

56:15.062 --> 56:16.763
And as I've said many times, I think

56:17.264 --> 56:31.352
You get firearms in people's hands and they become a gun owner and a shooter and learn the... It's almost like an academia where he's very careful to stay in his lane, talk about firearms in the Second Amendment and talk about nothing else.

56:32.073 --> 56:35.194
And that's very interesting because it's a phenomenon that's very real.

56:36.115 --> 56:40.077
It's a phenomenon that they create on purpose and they reinforce.

56:40.517 --> 56:40.918
Trust me.

56:41.238 --> 56:45.220
The pleasures and the security of having a firearm

56:47.410 --> 56:55.734
They're going to be thinking, I think, more and more like you, me, and everybody else when it comes to just freedom in general.

56:56.534 --> 57:15.604
And when they're going into the voting booth, I think they're going to more and more be looking at the names on those ballots and what they know or remember those people saying about firearms, about the Second Amendment, or bills they propose to take away their firearms.

57:16.926 --> 57:18.767
So we gain nothing by name calling.

57:21.448 --> 57:23.489
We just need everybody in the fold that we can get.

57:23.509 --> 57:31.212
And regardless of their religion, or their race, or their background, anything, obviously, is silly.

57:31.272 --> 57:36.294
To divide people by all those things, that's what the media likes to do.

57:36.314 --> 57:40.556
That's what politicians like to do, trying to gain power, keep everybody divided.

57:42.808 --> 57:43.709
What time is it?

57:43.789 --> 57:44.530
Game time!

57:44.630 --> 57:45.090
Woo!

57:45.651 --> 57:54.719
I'm going to go to an old song because the NBA on NBC is actually back, which is kind of crazy.

57:54.759 --> 57:55.960
So we'll go with this one instead.

57:58.742 --> 58:00.023
Ladies and gentlemen, it's October 28th, 2025.

58:00.063 --> 58:00.904
This is the Giga Home Biological.

58:11.508 --> 58:14.530
What a long, strange trip it has been.

58:15.291 --> 58:19.554
I've tried very hard to help, but I keep stepping in it somehow.

58:19.574 --> 58:21.776
I'm not really sure, so I keep working.

58:21.796 --> 58:26.500
Every day I get up and get to work and hopefully get a show out.

58:27.040 --> 58:31.243
We're gonna get more and more consistent and they're gonna hate me more and more, but that's okay.

58:31.263 --> 58:32.805
We're gonna stay focused on the biology.

58:32.845 --> 58:33.926
We're not gonna take their bait.

58:34.506 --> 58:35.467
We're gonna love our neighbors.

58:36.488 --> 58:38.929
Basketball season has officially started.

58:39.790 --> 58:43.813
Yesterday I ran with the eighth grade team for about a half an hour, and I'm not sore.

58:44.494 --> 58:53.280
So I think I'm in better shape than I was when I last posted a video playing basketball, which is, I think, to be expected because I've been working for about a year on it now.

58:53.300 --> 58:57.323
Since February of last year or so, I started getting serious.

58:57.383 --> 58:58.624
We're going to be like Galileo.

58:58.644 --> 59:00.005
We're going to seek the truth together.

59:00.045 --> 59:02.387
And when we find it, we're going to state it out loud.

59:02.447 --> 59:07.071
And the truth is, is that your consciousness is their prime real estate.

59:08.075 --> 59:09.657
And social media is how they get it.

59:10.718 --> 59:15.603
We are acquiescing to social media, and that allows them to control our consciousness.

59:15.663 --> 59:16.744
It's pretty simple, really.

59:17.965 --> 59:20.448
It's because it's not a matter of what's true that counts.

59:20.508 --> 59:22.349
It's a matter of what's perceived to be true.

59:22.369 --> 59:27.595
And what you perceive to be true on the internet is really, really far away from the truth.

59:34.520 --> 59:36.801
I mean, they've been doing that for a long time with money.

59:36.841 --> 59:45.185
Of course, a lot of people are aware that fiat currency and fractional reserve banking have been used to make certain people rich.

59:45.525 --> 59:48.347
Certain people don't even care about money anymore in the sense that we do.

59:49.648 --> 59:54.150
And that's because the money system has been a long time ago corrupted.

59:55.390 --> 59:57.431
But you would have to read a book to know that.

59:57.991 --> 01:00:00.191
You would definitely need to read a book to know that.

01:00:00.251 --> 01:00:11.915
Just like you'd need to read a book to know the real history of the Hepatitis B vaccine, you'd have to read a book or two to know anything about basic virology in bacteria.

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:13.616
Bacteriophages.

01:00:14.437 --> 01:00:16.918
And that's because there are three classes of people.

01:00:16.978 --> 01:00:19.740
Those who see, and maybe those who seek.

01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:23.942
Those who see when shown, and those who do not see.

01:00:23.982 --> 01:00:32.727
And right now, unfortunately, the group of people who does not see is being artificially inflated because of skilled social media use.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:38.391
If you default to that, you will be, by definition, a person who cannot see.

01:00:39.485 --> 01:00:45.489
Because on social media, illusions of consensus are created by sticking to limited spectrums of debate.

01:00:46.049 --> 01:00:49.772
The fake health freedom movement in America is one great example of that.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:53.655
You may have fallen victim to this elaborate hoax as well.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:59.599
But it is the flip side, the B-side of the pandemic and natural

01:01:00.459 --> 01:01:02.961
or lab leak viruses that these people represent.

01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:09.787
And so they create an illusion of consensus by putting teams of actors out there on the internet.

01:01:09.827 --> 01:01:12.970
These are the kinds of people that I'm referring to.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:17.294
These are the podcast actors that are doing the misleading of the young.

01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:19.696
And they do it by podcast acting.

01:01:19.736 --> 01:01:22.138
I'm referring to them as team worst case scenario.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:27.563
And I think that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are likely the captain recruiters of these people.

01:01:28.536 --> 01:01:35.478
And they're doing it because they still believe that there's some final goal to be had here, and maybe they're right.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:47.281
But right now, all they can do is really collect the data for the AI that doesn't exist, collect the data for, set up the network to collect the data, to monitor the data.

01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:48.402
That's all they can really do.

01:01:52.165 --> 01:02:00.151
And the only reason why they can do that is because they have this very limited but lively spectrum of debate on the internet.

01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:08.798
You know, like Joe Rogan podcast and Mary Talley Bowden's podcast and all these podcasters that have a spectacular commitment to the lies.

01:02:08.838 --> 01:02:12.742
And that's a harsh way of saying that they just read the script that they're given.

01:02:12.922 --> 01:02:16.665
I mean, if you're an actor and you read the script, you're not really a liar, you're an actor.

01:02:17.577 --> 01:02:20.218
And that's why a lot of these people don't feel bad about doing it.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:22.078
They think of themselves as an actor.

01:02:22.118 --> 01:02:35.741
And part of their job as an actor is to make us teach our children about gain-of-function mythology, about gain-of-function research, and viruses, and kind of pass along these things to our children, as opposed to passing along common sense.

01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:37.881
But we're going to try.

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:42.182
We're going to try to break that mold with noncompliance on the social media thing.

01:02:43.062 --> 01:02:45.043
And we're going to try to get the truth out there.

01:02:45.964 --> 01:02:50.106
The truth is encoded in history and in history's mentors.

01:02:50.986 --> 01:02:54.967
I think one of my best allies in this is Housatonic ITS.

01:02:55.007 --> 01:02:58.068
Housatonic comes out of Boston, Massachusetts.

01:02:58.669 --> 01:03:07.312
You can see him on Housatonic Channel 2, on YouTube, and also on all the other platforms, including my gigaohm biological platform on Peertube.

01:03:07.352 --> 01:03:09.433
So if you want to catch his stuff, that gets you there too.

01:03:12.074 --> 01:03:23.201
These charlatans are just some of the people that are in charge of keeping us off narrative and away from the truth, the irreducibly complex biology of humans.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:25.903
And these people are in front of them.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:29.986
And these charlatans are not the ones that have the power.

01:03:30.046 --> 01:03:31.947
These are the ones that are working for the slavers.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:36.890
These are the ones that I can personally explain how they are criminals.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:38.532
And that's why I still have hope.

01:03:39.292 --> 01:03:43.137
I still have hope that me or my kids are going to bring these people to justice.

01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:54.814
I still think that we can choose a path where everybody hears about GigaOM eventually, and hears about it in the context of the fraud that these people have committed.

01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:57.394
The fraud that these people are sustaining.

01:03:57.575 --> 01:03:59.555
And we can do it by teaching people biology.

01:03:59.615 --> 01:04:00.435
I really believe that.

01:04:00.515 --> 01:04:05.076
Because this illusion requires your participation to sustain.

01:04:05.756 --> 01:04:09.377
Intramuscular injection is definitely a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:04:09.977 --> 01:04:13.678
Transfection in healthy people is most certainly nuts.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.239
And RNA cannot pandemic.

01:04:17.279 --> 01:04:18.479
I think it's super simple.

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:23.178
The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words.

01:04:23.218 --> 01:04:27.163
And if you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.

01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:28.525
Here's some good words for you.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:32.630
Use them wisely and often as possible.

01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:52.332
Just not in the ways you've been fooled into believing, right?

01:04:52.873 --> 01:04:54.317
Autism is a myth.

01:04:56.565 --> 01:05:00.248
Oh my gosh, we've been at this a long, long time.

01:05:00.328 --> 01:05:03.630
I can't believe we went from this graphic to this graphic this year.

01:05:05.912 --> 01:05:09.974
Actually, the Marvin the Martian basketball graphic was originally from 2022.

01:05:10.034 --> 01:05:13.016
Then brought it back in 24.

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:15.498
As far as I can tell.

01:05:15.518 --> 01:05:20.021
I don't have all of my slide decks from all of the years, but I have most of them.

01:05:20.602 --> 01:05:23.844
And I have every video that I've ever done, and it's a lot to go through.

01:05:26.033 --> 01:05:28.538
Anyway, let's pick up where we left off.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.645
Just remember we were starting to watch this video over here.

01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:41.344
I think most people have concluded that the creation of COVID was probably not what they told us.

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:45.406
It probably didn't evolve naturally out of a pangolin in a seafood market.

01:05:46.187 --> 01:06:00.054
And the Wuhan Institute of Virology probably played a role, the US government played a role, but it is impossible to find anyone, or has been for us anyway, to find anyone who has kind of like direct connection to any of the main players here.

01:06:00.074 --> 01:06:02.355
None of them will do an interview, none.

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:06.810
You were the vice president of the EcoHealth Alliance.

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:10.691
You're a former military guy, tied to the intel world.

01:06:10.711 --> 01:06:13.031
You worked at federal.

01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:14.711
Nobody will do an interview.

01:06:14.751 --> 01:06:18.532
He can't find anybody that can explain to him why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:18.552 --> 01:06:19.612
is a scripted fraud.

01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:24.013
He can't find anybody who can explain to him why the pandemic was a fraud.

01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:30.555
He can't find anybody connected to this at all that has any connections to any of this, but lucky,

01:06:31.436 --> 01:06:43.257
uh andrew huff is there to talk to him that's cool nuclear lab in new mexico for years a nuclear lab i didn't know that uh and then you wind up

01:06:44.497 --> 01:06:47.539
working for EcoHealth Alliance in New York City.

01:06:48.139 --> 01:06:57.765
You think it's like this World Wildlife Fund operation designed to track diseases among wildlife globally and protect the wildlife, protect the people.

01:06:57.845 --> 01:06:59.806
It's kind of a crunchy outfit.

01:06:59.866 --> 01:07:01.287
It's do-gooders, basically.

01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:06.811
You show up there, you help them raise a bunch of money from the feds, and you become the vice president.

01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:09.892
And then you discover it's not what you thought.

01:07:10.052 --> 01:07:13.773
So that's the story that you told me at breakfast, which is an amazing story.

01:07:14.093 --> 01:07:15.014
Thank you again for coming.

01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:22.036
I'm going to bow out now and let you continue the story from there, assuming I've been faithful in my rendition of it so far.

01:07:22.056 --> 01:07:23.257
That's perfectly accurate.

01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:24.157
And thank you for having me.

01:07:24.197 --> 01:07:26.138
This is sort of like a dream of mine.

01:07:26.438 --> 01:07:27.598
Oh, well, I'm so excited you're here.

01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:29.539
And because this has been gnawing at me,

01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:32.852
you know, where did COVID come from?

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.273
Where did it come from?

01:07:34.353 --> 01:07:36.534
So ladies and gentlemen, this is Geek Owned Biological.

01:07:36.554 --> 01:07:39.695
It's a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

01:07:39.715 --> 01:07:43.516
I'm a guy who used to work for Children's Health Defense and used to work for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:43.556 --> 01:07:47.717
Before I learned enough biology to understand that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:07:47.757 --> 01:07:57.921
It doesn't have any of the chemical or physical attributes of DNA to which we attribute the magical properties that have, you know, allowed evolution to occur.

01:07:58.781 --> 01:08:20.408
And so if evolution is real because we found DNA and RNA has none of the chemical or physical characteristics of DNA, then how in the world could we need to fear RNA pandemicking and RNA going endemic and RNA being released in a mud puddle and then in a year being found in everyone around the world and all the white-tailed deer in North America?

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:21.969
That's absurd.

01:08:22.935 --> 01:08:24.276
And it's absurd on its face.

01:08:24.356 --> 01:08:35.985
It's so absurd that the only way that we could possibly be here as a species is because social media is so effective when you put enough actors to agree to lie.

01:08:37.182 --> 01:08:39.263
to stick to a narrative, to a script.

01:08:39.763 --> 01:08:40.703
That's how we are here.

01:08:41.124 --> 01:08:43.705
And this is not a message that everyone can handle.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:48.987
It's not a message for anyone, but it is, sorry, everyone, but it is a message for anyone.

01:08:49.047 --> 01:08:56.269
Anyone that wants to know the truth and understand how we are being governed by the skillful use of social media, I've got it.

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:57.370
And it ain't hard.

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:14.495
It's not hard to understand because while PBS NewsHour and many unwitting actors are trying to emphasize that they believe that it is just the nefarious corporate social media that wants you to use and click more and sell ads,

01:09:17.369 --> 01:09:21.255
and that they're just competing for your attention so that they can sell ads.

01:09:21.315 --> 01:09:25.461
And so, because that's the way capitalism works, there's nothing we can do about it.

01:09:25.922 --> 01:09:33.193
My message is, is that there is a national security operation that has weaponized social media and we are being governed by this illusion.

01:09:34.073 --> 01:09:50.878
that it's AI and just the way things are instead of an active manipulation of the voting population and active manipulation of the skilled social media using population based on what they click on and compartmentalizing them and intellectual hamster wheels

01:09:51.758 --> 01:10:10.383
and using them as they see appropriate against one another to create the confusion necessary so that, you know, everybody believes in elections and everybody believes in foreign policy and everybody believes that, you know, the consequences of the current state of affairs are just because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:10.483 --> 01:10:13.564
and Jay Bhattacharya and Donald Trump are in charge.

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:17.205
That's the reason why the ride's a little bumpy, everybody.

01:10:18.274 --> 01:10:19.655
And that's just ridiculous.

01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:21.616
This is for all the marbles.

01:10:21.656 --> 01:10:23.157
This is for the grandchildren of Earth.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:28.800
So they're definitely going to tell you a few stories, and they're definitely going to use a few podcast actors to do it.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.821
That's for sure.

01:10:30.461 --> 01:10:31.882
It's not going to be AI.

01:10:32.282 --> 01:10:37.326
It's not going to be programming of an AI that they don't really understand how it works.

01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:38.926
No, it's very, very simple.

01:10:38.987 --> 01:10:44.430
Tucker Carlson is an actor and a liar on a script, as are many of these other people.

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:46.291
And when you come to accept that,

01:10:46.731 --> 01:10:53.175
then suddenly everything turns a little greener and it feels a little more friendly because there was just a background signal that they lied about.

01:10:53.475 --> 01:10:56.917
What should be happening in the Biden administration right now that isn't going on?

01:10:57.457 --> 01:10:59.358
Yeah, there are two main things that they should be doing.

01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:12.505
I think what's darker is when you realize that the same actors on the left, like Liana Nguyen, who was inserted into our American history narrative during the Boston bombing, marathon bombing,

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:35.219
And as a Boston public health minister, something, something, I don't know what that is called, secretary of public health, this woman, this woman right here is in front of us at the end of 2024 talking about the bird flu and the bird flu and the bird flu and how we need to worry about the bird flu.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:42.183
And it is not by accident, it is by national security state script that the UK actor

01:11:44.482 --> 01:12:01.290
Polly Tommy and the UK, or sorry, the United States government scientist turned anti-vax saboteur, Brian Hooker, are talking about the exact same thing with their followers during the exact same freaking month.

01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:06.170
They are heavily going at us with, woman, I'm gonna kill you, blah, blah.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:10.050
And you just said, you're not seeing any difference in the pasteurized milk.

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.731
Pasteurization is not designed to kill.

01:12:12.951 --> 01:12:19.472
It is impossible that these two clowns are in front of us because they are fighting for children's health.

01:12:20.032 --> 01:12:27.854
It is impossible that these two are fighting for justice and whatever for kids like their own.

01:12:27.994 --> 01:12:29.474
That is, there's no way.

01:12:30.319 --> 01:12:33.200
This woman owns property on two continents.

01:12:33.701 --> 01:12:40.284
That man has been taking 200 plus thousand dollars a year for many years now and beautiful health insurance.

01:12:40.684 --> 01:12:42.104
And I'm not saying it's bad.

01:12:42.164 --> 01:12:43.125
I'm not saying it's good.

01:12:43.185 --> 01:12:45.306
I'm just saying that he's an actor on a script.

01:12:45.686 --> 01:12:54.970
There's no way to explain where this fake health freedom movement is after 15 years and being where they are, unless they are scripted actors.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:57.471
That's the reason why we have Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:12:57.512 --> 01:12:58.252
He was a trap.

01:12:59.315 --> 01:13:08.786
And you can see it because I've spent six years trying to convince these people that RNA cannot pandemic, that transfecting any healthy human would be crazy.

01:13:09.266 --> 01:13:13.932
And Brian Hooker has 16 years of experience working at a government laboratory.

01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:16.813
So he damn well knows what transfection is.

01:13:16.853 --> 01:13:33.039
He knows that this was an old technology that was being renamed as an investigational vaccine so that the intellectual property clock could be reset and so that everybody would be bamboozled into believing it was just another one of those safe things we call vaccines that we inject and make magic with.

01:13:35.373 --> 01:13:44.918
It is impossible to explain this other than all of these people are scripted actors and I was just one of the few people that they failed to absorb.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.983
While spending hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars trying to get me to be absorbed.

01:13:54.332 --> 01:14:03.838
Now, it might seem a little bit far-fetched to believe that all of these people have been, you know, scripted to act against me, but they have.

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.259
They all know my name.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.562
They probably all sat at tables and discussed what to do next.

01:14:09.002 --> 01:14:14.005
They've all probably had to sit down at the table and go, shit, that blew up in our face.

01:14:14.426 --> 01:14:15.186
Now what do we do?

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:19.149
Several times during the course of the pandemic,

01:14:20.626 --> 01:14:23.748
because the narrative has been out of their control for some time.

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:46.586
This worst case scenario team, once I understood its composition and I could see that Kevin McCairn was dancing with these people rather than actually debating them, that the CHD people were dancing with these people as opposed to debating them, that the CHD people were dancing with these people as opposed to actively opposing them,

01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:50.982
It started to become very clear to me that something else was going on.

01:14:51.022 --> 01:14:55.166
And once I started calling it out, everybody scrambled for the doors.

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:05.095
And they're still scrambling for the doors now because the one answer that actually explains it is that they're all one shitty team.

01:15:06.991 --> 01:15:09.473
That's why they're all in Commonwealth countries.

01:15:09.553 --> 01:15:16.839
That's why they all are part of the same groups of dissidents all around the world.

01:15:16.939 --> 01:15:22.484
And they're all in, you know, English-speaking or second English-speaking countries, and it's just a joke.

01:15:23.362 --> 01:15:26.904
It's really a joke how international these people in blue have been.

01:15:27.004 --> 01:15:41.811
There's no reason for Meryl Nass to have been international in the last six years as a lowly Maine doctor who was, you know, speaking out about the anthrax vaccine when she had absolutely no business speaking out about the anthrax vaccine like almost 20 years ago.

01:15:42.652 --> 01:15:43.492
This is a joke.

01:15:44.813 --> 01:15:52.497
And the reason why it's a joke is because none of these people have the requisite professional experience to be saying and doing what they're doing.

01:15:53.888 --> 01:16:01.398
It's all a fabricated CV that every one of these people is working with, and it's an absolute travesty that nobody can see it.

01:16:03.134 --> 01:16:11.999
They've likely all been scripted by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan directly or indirectly, and then set out on social media to do their thing.

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:23.065
And they argue with each other, and they say that Jessica Rose doesn't know what she's talking about, or they yell from the stairs of some conference so that everybody hears them yell.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:27.247
And so then everybody thinks, ooh, wow, controversy, we must follow that person.

01:16:27.587 --> 01:16:29.188
They do all kinds of stunts.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:36.925
And we think if we tweet the right thing, or retweet the right thing, or post the right thing, or make the right video, that somehow we're going to change their script.

01:16:36.965 --> 01:16:44.611
And that's as ridiculous as thinking that if you texted the right person, you could get the Star Trek episode that you're currently watching to change.

01:16:49.234 --> 01:16:50.615
Everyone has a timeline.

01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:54.558
My timeline is one that is almost for the ages.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:59.923
It's going to be one of the best books that anyone's ever read because it's just the truth.

01:17:00.731 --> 01:17:02.053
I don't have to remember anything.

01:17:05.497 --> 01:17:06.878
The internet remembers it.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.742
Rumble remembers it.

01:17:09.802 --> 01:17:11.023
YouTube remembers it.

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:12.525
My hard drives remember it.

01:17:15.222 --> 01:17:23.934
And if you just put the timeline down for any of these people, it becomes obvious that they are part of a scripted narrative trap.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:31.384
In 2020, supposedly Andrew Huff detected the smoke of the bodies being burnt in Wuhan.

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:45.460
That's what spurred him to buy a house in Northern Michigan with a mile long driveway and stock up on MREs because he saw the bodies burning on satellite footage.

01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:50.645
What the project program was and what they were claiming to do, it wasn't doing any of those things.

01:17:51.425 --> 01:18:00.493
It was simply just- But it was in 2022 in February that he came out and had a discussion about all of this stuff with lots of military lingo

01:18:01.394 --> 01:18:06.055
by the Trial Site News organization with Robert Malone.

01:18:06.175 --> 01:18:23.039
Trial Site News is of course a clown show but in 2022 we couldn't necessarily know that and these two guys then performed an elaborate theater where they pretended to be two longtime military operators using words like good copy and over

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:35.132
and talking about the possibility of a lab leak, the possibility that they created the virus, then yadda yadda yadda, and that was already in 2022, before he had the book out.

01:18:35.952 --> 01:18:45.078
Remember, Robert Malone already has, at this time in 2022, two books with Skyhorse Publishing, and he's working on his third, which is now out.

01:18:46.808 --> 01:19:00.482
Skyhorse Publishing being the same publisher that published the book in 2008 with the epilogue where Bobby Kennedy runs as an independent and then gets taken as the vice presidential candidate by the Republican who then gets shot making Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.703
the President of the United States.

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:15.636
And we're supposed to believe that the events of 2024 are not scripted, that they're just by accident really close to that sort of epilogue written in a Skyhorse publishing book.

01:19:15.676 --> 01:19:17.257
That's just by accident.

01:19:17.698 --> 01:19:25.044
Just like it might be by accident that, you know, some guy from EcoHealth Alliance is coming out and telling us that, see, it's a lab leak.

01:19:25.084 --> 01:19:27.646
It's just the way, you know, sometimes there are whistleblowers.

01:19:28.586 --> 01:19:31.367
collecting information and hunting for viruses, which I found interesting.

01:19:31.487 --> 01:19:40.050
I can tell you from working closely with the DITRA chem biodefense folks, they're not always the sharpest tools in the shed.

01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:42.291
Or maybe they're the ones that pay these guys.

01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:52.194
And so one of the ways to make it sound like, you know, we wouldn't be working for DITRA, we don't work for DITRA, is to say that DITRA's kind of dorks, you know, they're kind of dumbasses.

01:19:52.774 --> 01:19:55.455
You know, I've worked for DITRA before and they're kind of dumbasses.

01:19:55.495 --> 01:19:57.396
You know, DITRA's kind of that dumb place.

01:19:58.116 --> 01:20:02.040
And then suddenly everybody that's watching this thinks, oh, wow, Ditra, I guess it's not them.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.202
Must be the CIA, right?

01:20:06.203 --> 01:20:19.034
And they could, you know, they, my sense is they often see their mission space as more pilot program-like, not more comprehensive operational.

01:20:19.054 --> 01:20:24.439
They're often trying to prove a concept that then gets passed off to bigger funding.

01:20:25.425 --> 01:20:28.047
Does that comport with your experience?

01:20:28.367 --> 01:20:29.087
Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:33.490
And it depends on the program manager that gets assigned to your project.

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:43.315
Some program managers are very... Now, if we move right, of course, at the end of the year, there is a video where he goes on Andrew Huff.

01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:49.219
And the reason why he goes on Alex Jones is because Andrew now has his book.

01:20:49.759 --> 01:20:52.841
So I'll again remind you that yesterday we watched this video as well.

01:20:54.222 --> 01:20:59.147
And then that video, maybe this is what was supposed to play there and it didn't play, I apologize.

01:21:01.509 --> 01:21:05.233
So you have to ask yourself, you know, when the hell is this insanity going to stop?

01:21:05.273 --> 01:21:06.614
I mean, we have to do something about it.

01:21:06.774 --> 01:21:07.695
That's why I wrote the book.

01:21:08.336 --> 01:21:13.241
And, you know, I realized the psyop that's been going on against the American people is this.

01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:23.922
they try to confuse this whole discussion about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID by talking about this detailed minutiae of virology.

01:21:24.022 --> 01:21:28.205
So, I actually became friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:28.806 --> 01:21:37.592
He called me up and it was really... Now, of course, the reason why I play this again is because it's curious that they have him have a narrative that's very similar to mine.

01:21:37.652 --> 01:21:42.676
Now, far be it for me to claim that I would be the only one that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:43.176
would call

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.626
Of course, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:21:45.706 --> 01:21:52.088
could be used to call a lot of people and to influence a lot of people because a lot of people would be pretty shocked to get a phone call from him.

01:21:52.788 --> 01:21:56.349
They could use an AI version of his voice to call you and do the same thing.

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:05.693
Now, the thing that I think is most important here is that on the same day that I got a phone call from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:22:05.793 --> 01:22:06.233
saying,

01:22:07.637 --> 01:22:17.564
that Robert Malone had sat him down and made him watch my stream with Charles Rixey, I got a phone call also in that same day from Senator Ron Johnson telling me exactly the same thing.

01:22:18.325 --> 01:22:24.229
That Robert Malone had told him to watch my stream with Charles Rixey and that had convinced him to call me.

01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:27.832
These are not made up things.

01:22:27.892 --> 01:22:29.793
That happened exactly in April of 2022.

01:22:30.774 --> 01:22:35.698
So in the same year, Robert Malone is also apparently working up

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:43.863
a guy by the name of, of Andrew Huff and setting him up to produce a Skyhorse publishing book.

01:22:43.923 --> 01:22:46.044
Remember he's closely connected to Skyhorse.

01:22:46.084 --> 01:22:47.404
He's got three books with them.

01:22:48.084 --> 01:22:49.325
So maybe he set them up.

01:22:49.445 --> 01:22:49.865
I don't know.

01:22:50.605 --> 01:22:54.507
Maybe Tony Lyons met Andrew Huff through Robert Malone.

01:22:54.527 --> 01:22:55.447
It doesn't really matter.

01:22:55.507 --> 01:22:59.729
The point is, is this timing is quite dubious because remember this guy

01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:14.134
recommended that you take the RNA in the beginning because he was so panicked he brought a house in Upper Michigan and had a shootout with the Michigan police with 150 rounds and never really found out who was deploying drones over his house.

01:23:17.571 --> 01:23:18.732
really interesting conversation.

01:23:18.773 --> 01:23:22.377
He said, you know, I heard that you're from Ecolith Alliance.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.579
He works in all these places.

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:26.302
I hear that you're getting harassed by the CIA.

01:23:26.783 --> 01:23:29.987
My family and I have really interesting history with the CIA.

01:23:30.628 --> 01:23:31.929
And it blew my mind.

01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:33.391
And so he sent me an autographed copy.

01:23:33.411 --> 01:23:34.272
He was about to tell me to read it.

01:23:36.198 --> 01:23:43.028
you know, he covers everything so well there, I realized they've been bogging everyone down with the detailed technical minutiae of virology.

01:23:43.429 --> 01:23:44.370
So nobody can understand it.

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:47.936
I mean, people at my level can barely understand a lot of the technical detail.

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.800
It actually takes me some time to read through these virology papers.

01:23:51.801 --> 01:23:58.787
So it's not that the technical details are wrong or exaggerated, as Peter Thiel might call it.

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:00.529
It's not that they're lying.

01:24:01.089 --> 01:24:04.152
It's that the technical details bog down the truth.

01:24:04.552 --> 01:24:12.118
The technical details are really hard to sort out, you know, and it takes even me, a guy like me who's super smart, it takes me a long time to read these details.

01:24:12.901 --> 01:24:20.103
But he doesn't disagree that there is a novel virus that could kill millions of people, that millions more will be saved from, and that it could be a lab leak.

01:24:20.123 --> 01:24:22.303
He doesn't disagree with the narrative trap at all.

01:24:22.884 --> 01:24:29.585
He just says that the minutia of virology are pretty complicated and there's no reason to waste people's time with that.

01:24:32.646 --> 01:24:39.408
So what I do in this book is I break it down in layman terms so that a high school student can understand

01:24:40.682 --> 01:24:46.745
Random footage of the Kennedy assassination because that's what Alex Jones does, because he's a really good guy.

01:24:47.085 --> 01:24:48.706
He's a patriot trying to win.

01:24:49.926 --> 01:24:50.906
What has happened here?

01:24:50.926 --> 01:25:00.370
And I firmly believe if we can make every American understand, and you know, I'm an educator, I love teaching, I want everyone to be able to understand, then we can prevent this from ever happening again.

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:01.791
And that's really my goal here.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.340
It's just incredible.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:07.121
And you've got so much courage.

01:25:08.121 --> 01:25:11.142
But what I get from this at first, you were just trying to be helpful.

01:25:11.903 --> 01:25:16.364
And then they came after you and describe some of that harassment for folks that don't know what this is like.

01:25:17.705 --> 01:25:18.765
Yeah, it was really strange.

01:25:18.825 --> 01:25:24.407
I mean, so the first thing that happens is that military grade quadcopter drones are hovering around my house.

01:25:27.051 --> 01:25:37.683
If you watch that whole video, you will find him oftentimes struggling to put the words together, even though you can clearly hear him, that he has a certain combination of words that he wants to use.

01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:50.373
So he wants to say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, and he has scripted himself to say it, but then he's getting there, and it's coming close, and then he knows it's coming, and you can hear him trip over it.

01:25:50.553 --> 01:26:00.957
Or, you know, he's going to try to say something like, the government tries to mislead you about the way the gain-of-function viruses are working, and that's really the obfuscation, and he can't get out any of the words.

01:26:02.218 --> 01:26:03.559
And that reveals him.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.821
And look at his eyes.

01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:06.123
He's always looking down.

01:26:06.183 --> 01:26:07.445
It's because he's got notes.

01:26:07.505 --> 01:26:11.951
He's got a script that he's supposed to stick to because this is a lie.

01:26:12.392 --> 01:26:16.117
He's not remembering what happened to him over the last five years.

01:26:16.177 --> 01:26:19.061
He's telling you a lie about a whole career that's a lie.

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:31.857
Some of these spooks might have just been given jobs, or even worse, the internet stain of a job could have been created post-afterward.

01:26:33.479 --> 01:26:39.863
Maybe even some of the stuff that is attributed to Jessica Rose or Andrew Huff are even fabricated.

01:26:43.246 --> 01:26:44.166
That's where we are.

01:26:44.226 --> 01:26:47.629
Where are all the people that he worked with at the laboratories?

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:50.271
Where are these people that he worked with at JUUL?

01:26:51.328 --> 01:26:54.509
When are we gonna hear from some of them who are gonna say, oh yeah, he was awesome.

01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:56.590
When are we gonna hear that?

01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:57.650
We're never gonna hear that.

01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:18.718
But he's got a book that was allowed to be promoted on CHD Good Morning by a South African Indian lady who at the same time was also promoting that Malid Nawaz clown from the UK and also promoting food supply attacks by Andrew Huff in 2022 when the book came out.

01:27:21.019 --> 01:27:42.693
and now we're supposed to believe three years later he's on tucker carlson having made no progress having made no progress still trying to get the word out now listen carefully to a sponsoring entity whether that is a drug manufacturer the pharmaceutical industry

01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:57.019
When you submit a proposal to a sponsoring entity, whether that is a drug manufacturer, the pharmaceutical industry, the US government agency, you typically already have the first work done in the proposal before you submit it.

01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:58.299
Ideally, you have about a...

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:05.407
the first year of results, if not the first third of the proposed scope?

01:28:05.907 --> 01:28:13.076
I was just going to go there, and the best scientists I know, I have a friend that is actually three years ahead in his grant cycle funding.

01:28:13.777 --> 01:28:19.424
And you become so good at this that there's no easier money to obtain or get

01:28:19.964 --> 01:28:26.271
then the work that you've already completed and you sort of sit on it, you polish it, and then you start to get to this point where you can cut and paste out your proposals.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:34.120
And from your research work, almost effortlessly, it becomes a machine on its own, especially once you get Postdocs and other advanced researchers involved, it becomes a game.

01:28:37.225 --> 01:28:59.553
uh... that the intercept uh... reported through drastic we're actually i i i had been affiliated with drastic at the time but i was actually independently steering miranda devine uh... from the new york post to the same interesting he was steering miranda devine of the new york post to the diffuse proposal by telling her what years to search

01:29:00.273 --> 01:29:01.734
the DARPA database for.

01:29:02.294 --> 01:29:15.883
It's kind of like a similar script as Robert Malone making the career of some Stolberg reporter for the New York Times when he whistle-blew on the Jesse Gelsinger case.

01:29:17.204 --> 01:29:18.204
So let me repeat that.

01:29:18.524 --> 01:29:28.331
He's claiming that independent of Charles Rixey and Drastic releasing the defuse proposal after having it for three months,

01:29:29.389 --> 01:29:37.432
to The Intercept and publishing it, simultaneously as Veritas claimed to be releasing it on behalf of Major Murphy.

01:29:38.252 --> 01:29:43.854
This guy claims that he was also trying to get a reporter from the New York Post to find it.

01:29:45.994 --> 01:29:47.795
So we have three people on Earth.

01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:58.593
kind of, sort of, two people on earth, really, that claim to be the releasers of the diffuse proposal.

01:29:58.633 --> 01:30:09.277
We have Charles Rixey, who claims to have interacted with Major Murphy for about three months before Drastic decided to release the document that has no metadata.

01:30:10.836 --> 01:30:14.019
And then that document was released to the Intercept and apparently published.

01:30:14.579 --> 01:30:27.090
At the same time, Andrew Huff, who had a book in the works, was also trying to get a, I guess, get somebody to find the proposal on the database.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:37.759
But if he already knew of the existence of the proposal, because the proposal was written when he was at EcoHealth Alliance, and he had all these files at his house that people were trying to destroy, didn't he have a copy of the proposal?

01:30:38.672 --> 01:30:44.216
It was a proposal about finding viruses, which was what he was doing and what he was working on.

01:30:44.296 --> 01:30:50.160
So it's weird that that proposal couldn't just be handed over as part of his document set.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.922
And he would need to steer somebody hypothetically to where they might find it.

01:30:53.962 --> 01:30:55.043
And I don't think she found it.

01:30:55.503 --> 01:30:59.606
It's an interesting part of the narrative proposal that likely exists in telling her how to find it.

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:01.868
So I said, told her to start looking at the proposals.

01:31:01.888 --> 01:31:05.090
And I would look between, you know, a ditch or a DARPA between these years.

01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:08.232
Um, and he got published at the, uh, through the intercept first.

01:31:09.352 --> 01:31:23.297
And this is key because if you look at the DARPA Diffuse Proposal, and if that work had occurred, that's the exact work that you would do to have an accidental or an intentional release of SARS-CoV-2 in September of 2019.

01:31:24.197 --> 01:31:32.239
You look at the timeline and the fact that EcoHealth Alliance, like most other successful scientific organizations, work ahead of the proposal.

01:31:32.619 --> 01:31:37.661
They were probably already a year, two years, maybe three years ahead of the work that they were submitting

01:31:39.318 --> 01:31:43.701
And but as anyone who's written grants, I've been involved in writing grants for our company.

01:31:43.942 --> 01:31:46.363
We got like $30 million in grants from the NIH.

01:31:46.744 --> 01:31:49.206
You don't apply with a grant not having done 80% of it.

01:31:49.726 --> 01:31:52.148
It's just you're looking for the last 20%.

01:31:53.289 --> 01:31:54.970
Because you just can't.

01:31:55.190 --> 01:32:02.155
The grant process is so grueling and so competitive that in order for you to succeed, you have to have all this preliminary data that shows like we can get X done.

01:32:02.195 --> 01:32:03.436
We've demonstrated this piece.

01:32:03.456 --> 01:32:04.597
We've demonstrated this piece.

01:32:04.997 --> 01:32:06.399
Now we just need to do this last piece.

01:32:07.659 --> 01:32:13.680
And in that diffuse proposal, they had used particular restriction enzymes.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.981
These are enzymes that cut at particular sequences in DNA.

01:32:18.321 --> 01:32:21.801
Those are important because they help guide the way that you cut and paste DNA together.

01:32:22.422 --> 01:32:32.203
So imagine if you're cutting and pasting a Word document, but your highlighter to highlight what sentence you want to cut can only start and end with certain letters.

01:32:32.863 --> 01:32:34.124
Those are what restrictions are.

01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:35.944
So imagine you can only cut and paste where there's a the.

01:32:36.844 --> 01:32:43.086
So you would have to then build a paragraph knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

01:32:43.606 --> 01:32:46.647
And the ones that have paragraphs... Now let's just see for a second.

01:32:47.207 --> 01:32:53.228
I'm just going to lean over here and see what I can do.

01:32:54.249 --> 01:32:55.889
Maybe I'll do it like this.

01:32:56.609 --> 01:32:56.909
Yes.

01:32:57.670 --> 01:32:58.670
And then I'll cut over here.

01:33:01.235 --> 01:33:04.017
This is the Wuhan cover-up book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:33:04.197 --> 01:33:12.061
And you just heard Andrew Huff and Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project say about the same thing about four years apart, three years apart.

01:33:13.461 --> 01:33:15.462
And I just want to do a quick thing here.

01:33:16.403 --> 01:33:19.124
Go into the back of the book and I'm going to look up my last name.

01:33:20.165 --> 01:33:21.425
C-O-U-E-Y.

01:33:22.966 --> 01:33:24.367
And I'm going to find it here.

01:33:26.548 --> 01:33:28.709
And this should work just fine.

01:33:29.932 --> 01:33:33.073
There is my name, Jonathan Cooey.

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:40.536
I'm going to go to 281 first.

01:33:43.037 --> 01:33:53.062
281 is a Ralph Baric paper about zoonosis and that's likely why SARS fizzled out so quickly.

01:33:53.322 --> 01:33:57.924
And this is the RNA viruses like a 1970s audio cassette tape.

01:33:57.944 --> 01:33:58.464
So here is

01:33:59.494 --> 01:34:00.966
Actually my explanation

01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:11.235
for the way that they do virology is they just make a large quantity of a pure DNA and then they transfect a cell culture with it and then they call that virology.

01:34:11.776 --> 01:34:22.563
If they need to, they can drive the packaging of that DNA by also transfecting the N-protein as a separate RNA transcript and that team tends to work really well.

01:34:23.043 --> 01:34:28.146
And Ralph Baric has revealed that in several talks and also the methodologies of several papers that he's produced.

01:34:28.667 --> 01:34:31.809
And so all I'm doing is trying to explain how an RNA virus

01:34:32.529 --> 01:34:40.975
If it exists anywhere, it exists as a pure quantity in a laboratory, and whatever they find in nature is like a very low-fidelity copy.

01:34:41.015 --> 01:34:42.516
It might not even be a real copy.

01:34:42.556 --> 01:34:44.637
It's an estimation of what the signal they see.

01:34:45.238 --> 01:34:54.284
And so, again, a number of particles would far exceed the purity of any natural infection, enabling potential productions of stocks that were ideal launch pads for pandemics.

01:34:54.904 --> 01:34:57.485
So in a lot of ways, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:01.806
and the text that I helped him write really does tell you the truth already.

01:35:02.366 --> 01:35:07.248
That none of these signals have the fidelity that would be necessary to produce a pandemic.

01:35:07.308 --> 01:35:08.168
It's impossible.

01:35:10.008 --> 01:35:11.369
And so I say it right there.

01:35:11.409 --> 01:35:14.009
I'm quoted as saying it right there, but I guess that's not the right quote.

01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:15.930
So let's go back to the index again.

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:19.851
Put this over here.

01:35:19.871 --> 01:35:21.372
283, that's the next page again.

01:35:21.532 --> 01:35:22.492
There's a quote from me.

01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:27.871
Let's look for it here.

01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:36.636
The owner to study coronavirus in a lab.

01:35:36.696 --> 01:35:42.860
Researchers don't pass cultures of virus like they do with bacteria or cell lines or mouse lines.

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:43.981
If you cannot

01:35:44.946 --> 01:35:48.807
culture it, you cannot make enough to use as a stable laboratory model.

01:35:49.308 --> 01:35:51.728
Barrick's techniques made this a non-issue.

01:35:51.748 --> 01:35:52.809
And so that is correct.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:56.090
Barrick's techniques are not special to him though.

01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:01.272
It's just transfecting cell cultures with what they purport to be as viral constructs.

01:36:02.352 --> 01:36:13.196
And he worked out the minimum viral construct that was necessary in order to get viral production, exosome production, packaging of mRNA or, or, or DNA.

01:36:14.491 --> 01:36:20.414
And people have been working on that for a long time and claiming that that's animal virology and it's not animal virology.

01:36:21.994 --> 01:36:26.015
It's molecular biology of some kind or another, but it's not virology.

01:36:26.075 --> 01:36:35.157
These are not independent entities, you know, RNA molecules that are doing what they want to do despite our best effort to stop them.

01:36:35.217 --> 01:36:36.178
That's ridiculous.

01:36:36.758 --> 01:36:38.458
And so again, this is clone stuff.

01:36:38.498 --> 01:36:44.460
It's pretty good, but it's not perfect because at that time they were still trying to take as much as they could out of context.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:44.460
310.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.421
310 is the next reference.

01:36:51.365 --> 01:36:53.066
Hmm, here's an interesting.

01:36:53.186 --> 01:37:00.249
Jonathan Cooey similarly observes, the fact that Fauci and NIH turned down DASAC's proposal is irrelevant.

01:37:00.269 --> 01:37:06.672
The proposal itself is evidence that the work may have already been done, as that's how modern research is conducted and funded.

01:37:06.712 --> 01:37:13.116
The government's official claim that it rejected DASAC's proposal makes for a convenient public denial that the work was never done.

01:37:13.136 --> 01:37:13.356
And this

01:37:14.076 --> 01:37:20.342
probably was sufficient reassurance for 90% of the curious population, since most people don't understand the grant-making process.

01:37:20.822 --> 01:37:25.647
But any working scientist will view this narrative with skepticism.

01:37:26.187 --> 01:37:39.460
Now, interestingly enough, that actually statement is derived from the podcast with Charles Rixey, where I actually made that revelation in my head live.

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:48.691
that I realized that, hey, you know, if this diffuse proposal is real, if it's real, like Charles Rixey says, I mean, he came all the way to my house.

01:37:48.731 --> 01:37:51.293
He was sitting right next to me claiming that it was real.

01:37:51.933 --> 01:38:03.399
And so on that podcast, I said, if it's real, remember when that is, January of 2022, he came to my house and I podcasted and said that out loud.

01:38:03.859 --> 01:38:04.360
And now,

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:17.560
In February of 2022, see, in February of 2022, we have Robert Malone talking to Andrew Huff, and Andrew Huff seems to be scripted to say exactly the same thing.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:25.905
Then in April of 2022, Senator Ron Johnson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:25.965 --> 01:38:34.670
call me and say that they saw that crazy stream on January of 2022 with Charles Rixey, and you're a really brilliant guy, and Robert Malone said we should call you.

01:38:37.955 --> 01:39:02.346
And then in November of 2024, the guy who called me chemtrail retarded and said that I was Barrick's bitch boy goes on a huge podcast and says exactly the same thing that I was quoted as saying in this book and tells people that Charles Rixey helped with the writing of this book rather than me.

01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:06.248
Even though I'm quoted like six times in the book, I've only read three to you today.

01:39:08.154 --> 01:39:09.555
This book is American history.

01:39:10.156 --> 01:39:19.783
This book could actually bring down the Trump administration and the fraud that is the anti-vax movement in America and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:19.823 --> 01:39:21.184
and all of them underneath him.

01:39:21.224 --> 01:39:22.225
It could bring them all down.

01:39:22.285 --> 01:39:23.145
This book right here.

01:39:23.245 --> 01:39:26.428
Buy it now while it's still available.

01:39:26.468 --> 01:39:28.129
And if you want to, send it to my P.O.

01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:30.571
box and I'll sign it and then send it to you.

01:39:36.567 --> 01:39:37.108
No problem.

01:39:38.069 --> 01:39:43.594
Sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with there, which is a couple more letters.

01:39:43.754 --> 01:39:44.455
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:39:44.495 --> 01:39:45.216
Let's keep reading.

01:39:46.237 --> 01:39:50.161
The next quote of Jonathan Cooey in this book.

01:39:50.421 --> 01:39:51.822
Hmm, let's see here.

01:39:53.304 --> 01:39:54.705
Where's the index and the Cooey?

01:39:54.725 --> 01:39:54.705
310, 319.

01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.649
Interesting.

01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:07.895
So he's doing an analogy right now about restriction enzymes and how they cut different words.

01:40:08.475 --> 01:40:10.977
And he says something really pretty shabby.

01:40:11.518 --> 01:40:14.120
But let me see if I can get it there without screwing up the presentation.

01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:20.365
We're going to use those enzymes to cut here in a paragraph, knowing that the paragraphs that have sentences that start with the, we're going to cut with this enzyme.

01:40:20.905 --> 01:40:26.270
And the ones that have sentences that start with maybe, we have another enzyme with things that start with their.

01:40:26.890 --> 01:40:33.371
OK, so let's go to 319 in the book, another quote from me, and see what we find in 319.

01:40:34.892 --> 01:40:44.974
As Jonathan Cooey explains, the magic of Barrick's no-see-um technique is to invisibly weave these telltale spelling changes into the viral sequence between relevant genes without altering the viral protein.

01:40:45.674 --> 01:40:50.035
This is like changing the spelling of the word without changing its pronunciation or meaning.

01:40:50.075 --> 01:40:52.215
The casual listener will never notice the difference.

01:40:52.856 --> 01:40:53.796
Cooey continues.

01:40:54.796 --> 01:40:58.540
Consider how a Brit would spell color, maneuver, or pediatric.

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:02.164
The choice to spell the word in a certain way can reveal your nation of origin.

01:41:02.224 --> 01:41:08.891
Similarly, these nearly imperceptible changes in the viral sequence give away the laboratory origins of this virus.

01:41:09.512 --> 01:41:14.077
Can you imagine that such an elegant explanation

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:41.731
Using a word metaphor to show you how for example Amino acids can be spelled in different ways because the code is redundant and that analogy works so so well that it's like a home run and then what's so bizarre about the fact that the former director of Research and development for the human genome project has been scripted to lie about the contents of this book and

01:41:42.538 --> 01:41:47.760
on a huge podcast and others lie repeatedly on podcasts about this book.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.400
This is just the best example of it.

01:41:50.381 --> 01:41:54.582
The most succinct 10 minute example of the treachery that we are under.

01:41:56.483 --> 01:42:04.385
And so it's beyond debate that America is under attack by actors on social media.

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:10.047
And unfortunately, some guy in Pittsburgh is one of the few who can list many of them

01:42:11.243 --> 01:42:19.111
because of personal experience, personal interaction, and their insistence on trying to convert me to their mythology.

01:42:20.733 --> 01:42:26.979
It's this book and their denial of it that is the perfect admission.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:32.662
which is a couple more letters onto the, right?

01:42:32.702 --> 01:42:34.204
And we're going to use those enzymes to cut.

01:42:34.324 --> 01:42:35.645
And so now we're supposed to be in 2025.

01:42:35.925 --> 01:42:46.835
Yeah, again, I don't have any background information, so like you could tell me anything, but everything you're saying sounds right to me, just based on what I have seen.

01:42:47.275 --> 01:42:51.399
Can I just back up a tiny bit and ask some practical questions about what EcoHealth Alliance was doing?

01:42:51.439 --> 01:42:51.539
Sure.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:43:03.342
before you got to the portion where they were acting as an Intel asset, which sounds right, you said they were compiling, collecting a library of viruses from around the world.

01:43:04.142 --> 01:43:05.322
How does that work?

01:43:05.342 --> 01:43:16.804
How do you collect a virus in a... So now they have him on Tucker Carlson explaining what I explained in this thing with three different references and six different quotes.

01:43:17.344 --> 01:43:18.244
Imagine that.

01:43:18.304 --> 01:43:19.585
They can't find anybody.

01:43:19.665 --> 01:43:20.925
Nobody will talk about it.

01:43:21.596 --> 01:43:22.777
Except for Andrew Huff.

01:43:24.577 --> 01:43:27.099
I'm sure Kevin McKernan would come on and talk about it too.

01:43:28.559 --> 01:43:33.682
You should really get Charles Rixey and Alex Washburn on here, because they know everything about it.

01:43:34.002 --> 01:43:35.863
Dan, for example, any country, how do you do that?

01:43:36.303 --> 01:43:36.963
Sure.

01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:46.428
I guess in my mind it's very straightforward, but typically first you form a relationship with the diplomatic mission, so the embassy, the consulate for the United States.

01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:56.474
they might refer you to either hospitals, professors, other academics, or companies in country, or maybe you already have those relationships from past work that you've done.

01:43:57.034 --> 01:44:02.538
You then go on a trip to that country, and you go sort of do an assessment of their laboratories.

01:44:03.999 --> 01:44:06.740
You collect sort of information, try to gauge, do these people have the capability?

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:07.661
Do you know what they're doing?

01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:09.842
Are they going to spend our money wisely?

01:44:09.882 --> 01:44:14.926
So it's a business trip, and it's very business focused, and you're assessing their capabilities.

01:44:15.706 --> 01:44:21.349
Then once you have a good feeling with their capabilities, you begin the contracting process with that foreign entity.

01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:27.672
And if you're doing everything by the book, you run these people through US government systems to make sure they're not terrorists or evil people.

01:44:27.692 --> 01:44:29.072
So we're not giving money to terrorists.

01:44:29.232 --> 01:44:30.713
That didn't happen at Equal Health Alliance.

01:44:30.753 --> 01:44:31.293
It did not happen.

01:44:31.333 --> 01:44:32.094
It did not happen.

01:44:32.694 --> 01:44:34.735
I found out about that after the fact as well.

01:44:35.355 --> 01:44:37.616
But we try to figure out who these people are.

01:44:37.696 --> 01:44:40.718
And then if they're capable, oftentimes it's universal.

01:44:40.758 --> 01:44:42.618
So maybe they gave their money to terrorists.

01:44:42.658 --> 01:44:43.439
Wow, that's crazy.

01:44:44.179 --> 01:44:50.126
You know, either the ag school or at a foreign university, the veterinary school or human medical center.

01:44:51.309 --> 01:45:00.095
Then we formulate the contract, we send them the cash, and then they would either go out and collect the samples or we would travel or have our personnel travel to go collect the samples.

01:45:00.795 --> 01:45:07.780
Have you ever considered the possibility that it's funny that he talks about Zika when he kind of has a microencephaly-shaped head?

01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:10.842
If we're talking about bats, it depends what species you're dealing with.

01:45:10.902 --> 01:45:11.302
Right.

01:45:11.322 --> 01:45:16.366
If you're dealing with bats, you set nets or traps in a bat cave, for example.

01:45:18.069 --> 01:45:27.674
You catch the bat in the net, and then you go out there in your personal protective equipment, and you take fecal swabs, blood, saliva from the animal.

01:45:28.394 --> 01:45:36.118
And then you then package that so that the DNA will not be degraded and transport back to the laboratory.

01:45:36.778 --> 01:45:38.779
And then depending... Where's the laboratory?

01:45:39.119 --> 01:45:40.540
Well, it depends on what country you're working in.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.301
So every country had, we had different agreements with contractually.

01:45:44.321 --> 01:45:49.843
I mean, don't you know, the HIV virus was smuggled in an Eppendorf tube in the pocket of somebody back then.

01:45:49.863 --> 01:45:52.204
I mean, this stuff is normal, dude.

01:45:52.824 --> 01:46:05.069
I mean, remember that Zhengxiao Chao, whatever her name is from Canada that had like a three antibody cocktail that they were testing, she just disappeared and she was also smuggling viruses.

01:46:07.116 --> 01:46:09.957
about who owned the samples, who would store the samples.

01:46:11.018 --> 01:46:12.078
Yeah, DNA, that's right.

01:46:12.158 --> 01:46:13.159
DNA, you're right.

01:46:13.419 --> 01:46:15.120
Katherine's, Christy's always on it.

01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:16.020
Christy's always on it.

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.021
Yes, DNA, for that case, DNA, yes.

01:46:18.061 --> 01:46:18.861
She's advancing.

01:46:19.302 --> 01:46:19.442
Yes.

01:46:19.462 --> 01:46:26.545
Okay, so at one time in this type of research, you actually had to have the physical sample.

01:46:27.185 --> 01:46:28.026
Today, we're at a point

01:46:29.066 --> 01:46:31.047
You no longer have to have the physical sample.

01:46:31.087 --> 01:46:35.989
You can actually send the DNA or RNA code digitally to somebody else, and they can recreate it.

01:46:36.309 --> 01:46:37.089
So there you go.

01:46:37.169 --> 01:46:38.090
That's what he's saying.

01:46:38.170 --> 01:46:42.632
They can print DNA and then transfect cells and call it virology.

01:46:43.172 --> 01:46:52.756
And when they print or when they manufacture DNA using more primitive methods like recombinant bacterial cultures and recombinant DNA that way,

01:46:53.616 --> 01:47:05.987
They make a pure quantity that would otherwise never exist in nature, a very pure quantity relative to whatever would exist in nature, whatever would exist as a consequence of the sequence that they claim to have found.

01:47:06.788 --> 01:47:15.175
And so I am not even willing to go far enough to debate whether viruses or these signals are derived from real signals.

01:47:15.976 --> 01:47:35.346
What I want you to see is that unless they do the work necessary to prove to you that this signal is a real signal, that they can find repeatedly, and that the signal can be characterized, and it has a variability around an average, and then they make that average and put it in a cell culture, and then they get something.

01:47:35.786 --> 01:47:37.487
I mean, none of that happens.

01:47:38.433 --> 01:47:46.359
It is actually just the production of large pure quantities of DNA or RNA and then transfecting cell cultures with it.

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:48.861
And that's what virus, virology has become.

01:47:49.361 --> 01:47:52.143
And he's saying that here without actually saying it.

01:47:52.964 --> 01:48:07.815
He's not actually telling you that they are using very rudimentary human genome project derived technologies to create pure DNA sequences and try to understand how cells package genetic signals.

01:48:09.588 --> 01:48:12.129
and the consequences of it, at best.

01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.970
At best, that's what they're doing.

01:48:14.751 --> 01:48:18.773
At worst, they are completely creating a fake field.

01:48:18.873 --> 01:48:20.054
I don't think it's that bad.

01:48:20.094 --> 01:48:21.634
I think it's more malevolent than that.

01:48:21.674 --> 01:48:22.415
I think they know.

01:48:23.436 --> 01:48:25.178
that cellular signaling occurs.

01:48:25.238 --> 01:48:27.701
I think they know that bacterial signaling occurs.

01:48:28.142 --> 01:48:40.838
I think they know that bacteriophage signaling occurs and overwhelms any potential animal virus signal that there might be in nature, which I don't think there probably is any meaningful signal that way.

01:48:41.318 --> 01:48:49.987
The vast majority of viral signals that we should be concerned with are derived from and interacting with our microbiome and the other bacteria around us.

01:48:50.187 --> 01:48:53.370
And we know that from all the bacterial research that's ever been done.

01:48:53.891 --> 01:49:02.279
And so the idea that David Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello represent this virology of animal viruses is just ridiculous.

01:49:02.359 --> 01:49:04.221
And you can see it in the history

01:49:04.881 --> 01:49:14.227
of molecular biology because all of the big name guys that went into bacteria and bacteriophages did not go into animal viruses.

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:16.189
They just didn't.

01:49:17.489 --> 01:49:19.571
They kind of just, everything faded out.

01:49:20.531 --> 01:49:31.879
And all of these Manhattan Project geniuses that went on to do molecular biology thinking that the last rules of the universe were to be found there, found nothing and gave up.

01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:50.233
And instead, a new group of people took over and created a whole mythology about animal viruses and animal virus diseases and public health while ignoring a preponderance of genetic signals derived from bacteria and their phages and bactericides.

01:49:54.114 --> 01:49:54.334
Huh.

01:49:54.954 --> 01:49:58.414
So this field has advanced tremendously over 10 years.

01:49:58.834 --> 01:50:01.395
And this is taking place as advancement while we're doing this work.

01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:08.134
Oftentimes the samples then were physically transported back to the United States or mailed or shipped.

01:50:09.295 --> 01:50:13.499
You can mail a deadly bat virus from a third world country to the US?

01:50:13.639 --> 01:50:14.459
No, the poop.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:21.065
No, we just mail the deadly virus poop and the swab that went in the virus butt, you know, or the bat butt.

01:50:21.125 --> 01:50:22.266
It's just so dumb.

01:50:22.326 --> 01:50:23.226
It's so dumb.

01:50:23.467 --> 01:50:24.748
Oh, commercial airlines.

01:50:25.188 --> 01:50:27.170
Oh my gosh, I'm never going to fly again.

01:50:32.509 --> 01:50:32.749
Oops.

01:50:33.791 --> 01:50:39.340
A manual from the CDC and USDA and HHS of how to transport sample.

01:50:46.997 --> 01:50:50.120
I was just checking my email because somebody said email there.

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.322
I don't see any emails from Christie.

01:50:52.342 --> 01:50:53.504
So I'm going to assume that was not.

01:50:53.524 --> 01:50:57.007
So yes, there are rules and process of how you can so almost.

01:50:57.027 --> 01:50:58.168
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:58.208 --> 01:50:59.870
You can send the sequence by email.

01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:00.471
Yes, correct.

01:51:00.511 --> 01:51:00.751
Sorry.

01:51:01.932 --> 01:51:03.534
Mail goes on commercial airliners.

01:51:04.656 --> 01:51:09.339
Typically, and there's really not a whole lot of risk from a collected sample.

01:51:09.359 --> 01:51:14.202
First of all, you don't even know at this point whether there's a new deadly virus present in the sample.

01:51:14.222 --> 01:51:15.322
In the bat shit or the saliva.

01:51:15.342 --> 01:51:16.643
Yeah, in the bat shit or the saliva.

01:51:17.063 --> 01:51:17.624
You have no clue.

01:51:18.684 --> 01:51:29.511
Once it gets back to the United States, then it goes to, at least at Equal Alliance, it would go to Ian Lipkin's laboratory at Columbia University, where he was a specialist in, he's a

01:51:30.151 --> 01:51:33.715
pretty well-known viral epidemiologists with really good lab chops.

01:51:33.795 --> 01:51:37.160
Ian Lipkin, he doesn't have any other baggage, right?

01:51:39.253 --> 01:51:47.896
Another doctor who worked with us named Simon Anthony would work with him to isolate, well, at first identify and isolate new viruses or novel viruses.

01:51:47.916 --> 01:51:49.336
So that's where it typically took place.

01:51:50.077 --> 01:51:59.260
Then the mechanics of this or operations of this, that information or sample would be sent to another laboratory like Ralph Baric's laboratory, where he would continue the work.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.020
Down at Chapel Hill.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.461
Chapel Hill and do the gait and function work.

01:52:02.041 --> 01:52:04.842
It's just, can I just approach this from an autistic perspective?

01:52:05.242 --> 01:52:07.703
So what you're saying is there are like,

01:52:08.763 --> 01:52:17.841
people around the world in bat caves in some faraway country sending potentially novel and dangerous viruses to New York City.

01:52:19.744 --> 01:52:21.684
like all the time, and people are not even aware of this.

01:52:21.884 --> 01:52:30.446
There's a huge, I wouldn't say huge, but I mean, a non-trivial amount of these types of samples being shipped around the world globally.

01:52:30.806 --> 01:52:36.167
And if they're properly contained and packaged, it's really not that much of a risk.

01:52:36.187 --> 01:52:41.828
And actually, Dr. Ralph Baric developed some of these methods of how to send what's called a chimeric virus on a sheet of paper.

01:52:41.868 --> 01:52:44.269
Can you say Dr. Ralph Baric again, please?

01:52:45.228 --> 01:52:46.188
which is low risk.

01:52:47.789 --> 01:52:51.230
The bigger risk becomes- But they were sending chimeric viruses everywhere.

01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:54.711
If you don't know what chimeric viruses are, you can look it up after this video, right?

01:52:54.751 --> 01:52:56.872
Because that's how the system works.

01:52:56.892 --> 01:53:11.237
When you start to clone or replicate that agent at scale, you know, human medicine, public health, epidemiology, transmission risk, now you look at this, you have to have a substantial quantity of a virus, which is- No!

01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:15.031
A substantial quantity of the virus?

01:53:15.151 --> 01:53:15.471
No.

01:53:16.812 --> 01:53:24.618
You have to have a substantial quantity of the DNA or RNA that represents the virus so that you can transfect a cell culture that will package it.

01:53:25.819 --> 01:53:32.146
so that you will have that DNA in small exosomes that you can use to do other things with it.

01:53:32.826 --> 01:53:34.848
And it might not even do it.

01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:36.450
It might not even package it.

01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:43.517
You might just dissociate all the cells and spin it all up and then put that supernatant or that entire

01:53:44.218 --> 01:53:51.501
Blended cell culture into the throat or the brain or the the animal model that you're using That's the extent to which we are doing.

01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:53.402
This is not virology.

01:53:53.462 --> 01:53:58.124
This is molecular biology recombinant DNA molecular biology

01:53:59.091 --> 01:54:00.953
masquerading as virology.

01:54:00.993 --> 01:54:03.135
And these people can't see the particles.

01:54:03.616 --> 01:54:05.878
They can't confirm what's being packaged.

01:54:06.378 --> 01:54:10.943
They only know that they put, as Andrew Huff said, they need a large quantity of the viruses.

01:54:11.063 --> 01:54:15.548
No, they need a large quantity of the DNA sequence that they got in the email.

01:54:17.089 --> 01:54:21.594
They need a large quantity of the DNA sequence that they want to find with PCR.

01:54:22.878 --> 01:54:26.599
that they want to develop antibodies to the protein that it encodes.

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:27.399
That's what they need.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.580
They need the DNA in large quantities.

01:54:31.041 --> 01:54:40.784
He's telling you without telling you because he is on a script and he's telling you what I told pretty well in this book, despite their best efforts.

01:54:42.202 --> 01:54:44.044
Realize what I'm trying to say here.

01:54:44.585 --> 01:54:53.855
America might be able to break free of the social media trap that we're in, and it might be this book that could break us free.

01:54:54.776 --> 01:54:56.558
Because these are just actors on the internet.

01:54:58.038 --> 01:55:08.926
Substance mixed in the air be exposed to it to become infected with it because you have an immune system that works Okay, and sometimes you get exposed to these things You don't even know it because your immune system fights it off, right?

01:55:09.046 --> 01:55:18.934
So the I think sometimes the risk is overblown and the fear around transport I did a bike ride about chimeric viruses on my on my JC on a bike channel.

01:55:19.034 --> 01:55:24.678
Don't don't misunderstand I'm not claiming that I knew this back then chimeric viruses made perfect sense to me.

01:55:24.698 --> 01:55:25.739
Of course, they made it and

01:55:27.217 --> 01:55:29.560
I think most of the time that's actually pretty low risk.

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:44.595
There's been a series of transporting accidents which occurred from 2008 to 2012 or 14, I want to say, which actually led to the ban or partial ban on gain of function research.

01:55:44.695 --> 01:55:45.536
What kind of accidents?

01:55:46.422 --> 01:55:55.569
One of the high-profile ones was that I think it was Bacillus anthracis was being shipped from one of our US government BSL for a laboratory.

01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:56.770
That's anthrax.

01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:59.872
He didn't say it very well, but that's anthrax.

01:55:59.932 --> 01:56:05.596
He's under CDC control to another laboratory and it went missing and they found it.

01:56:07.116 --> 01:56:07.717
sitting in the corner.

01:56:07.737 --> 01:56:08.938
Some porch pirate stole it?

01:56:08.958 --> 01:56:20.032
No, it wasn't a porch pirate, but they found it someplace and it wasn't properly secured or completely off the- Yeah, I mean, we live in a world with like Chernobyl and misdiagnoses and I mean, I believe in science.

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:20.753
I think there are a lot of

01:56:21.992 --> 01:56:26.515
you know, rigorous, responsible scientists, but, you know, people make mistakes.

01:56:26.615 --> 01:56:30.217
I mean, and over time and with scale, like, mistakes will happen, right?

01:56:30.317 --> 01:56:37.582
Well, and we actually dealt with this type of low probability, high consequence threat risk analysis all the time at San Diego National Laboratories.

01:56:37.622 --> 01:56:41.665
And the big issue is what you just brought up, the human and the Malupa.

01:56:41.925 --> 01:56:49.810
Usually the engineered systems, you can engineer those precisely to account for whatever probability or consequence of risk, but it's always the human

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:56.232
making a decision or behavior action involved in the system that makes a mistake, which causes some kind of catastrophic failure.

01:56:57.052 --> 01:56:57.632
Well, yeah.

01:56:57.892 --> 01:56:58.052
Yeah.

01:56:58.292 --> 01:56:58.852
I mean, yeah.

01:56:59.873 --> 01:57:00.853
So, okay.

01:57:00.953 --> 01:57:02.013
I just was just interested.

01:57:02.033 --> 01:57:08.675
So then you say that the EcoHealth Alliance was compiling a library of these viruses?

01:57:09.135 --> 01:57:10.195
They'd be stored in one place?

01:57:10.876 --> 01:57:11.456
Well, yes.

01:57:11.556 --> 01:57:14.097
They had a digital library at EcoHealth Alliance.

01:57:14.117 --> 01:57:19.158
And then there's other systems that the US, or I should say, not only the United States,

01:57:19.338 --> 01:57:28.701
Of course, these digital libraries are what make it so that any, you know, buddy with a biology degree and some eBay equipment can make a gain-of-function virus in their garage.

01:57:28.761 --> 01:57:44.027
That's actually what Robert Malone told a group of people in a UK Parliament conference at one point in time in 2022, and said repeatedly on stage as part of his International COVID Summit series that spanned six different years.

01:57:45.127 --> 01:57:53.295
often with with Meryl Nass at his side with with Jessica Rose going as far as Finland and Romania and and and Japan.

01:57:53.555 --> 01:57:59.420
The global virologist community maintain of genetic information on viruses.

01:58:02.453 --> 01:58:06.394
but the actual viruses, the living organisms, were they stored anywhere?

01:58:06.735 --> 01:58:18.739
Typically, we were buying negative ADC centigrade freezers as fast as we could, or as many as we could afford, and storing those at Columbia University and other laboratories where these things go in the freezer and they set.

01:58:18.759 --> 01:58:24.061
And the one nice thing is if the freezer does fail, it usually destroys all the sample, the insects.

01:58:24.081 --> 01:58:25.321
They do have to be maintained cold.

01:58:25.481 --> 01:58:28.222
We thought this through when we started this podcast a year ago, and we decided

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.661
Yeah, he's got sponsors and I'm not gonna watch him.

01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:37.182
Look, if everyone is on the script, then no one is looking for the truth, including you.

01:58:37.262 --> 01:58:40.803
And I know, I know from experience that that's how this works.

01:58:40.904 --> 01:58:47.325
I know from experience that they fool us into solving their mysteries and by doing so, we come to accept their monsters.

01:58:49.086 --> 01:58:55.188
And unfortunately, Pauly Tommy and Andrew Wakefield and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker are guilty of this.

01:58:55.248 --> 01:58:58.409
They are guilty of fooling us into solving their mysteries.

01:58:59.409 --> 01:59:24.450
and we accepted their monsters and now we are about to be face-planted because these mysteries and these monsters are all made up and they have been touring the world behind the scenes making sure that the narrative about the novel virus and about the novel vaccine is curated around the world everywhere where social media has a significant footprint these people have been

01:59:25.282 --> 01:59:50.266
There is no way to explain why Steven Hatfill and Brett Weinstein are on the same stage in November of 2023 with Denny Rancor and Byram Bridle and Jessica Rose and Harvey Reich and Nick Hudson of Panda and Robert Malone and Jill Glass Bloom Malone and Anthrax Barbie.

01:59:52.634 --> 01:59:54.715
of CHD Merrill Nass.

01:59:54.755 --> 01:59:56.457
There's just no way to explain this.

01:59:57.717 --> 02:00:04.482
Other than a very nefarious military operation coordinated around the State Department and NATO and DITRA.

02:00:08.945 --> 02:00:11.907
And coordinated by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan, I think most of all.

02:00:12.827 --> 02:00:15.329
That's why they were in front of the Senate a couple months later.

02:00:17.239 --> 02:00:32.226
along with a lot of the same actors, including the guy, Senator Ron Johnson, that called me in 2022 and told me that Robert Malone said to watch my Rixey stream where I talked about the diffuse proposal being real and that they probably did some of the experiments because that's how grants are done.

02:00:34.207 --> 02:00:35.507
And that got in this book.

02:00:35.788 --> 02:00:45.372
And now suddenly everybody doesn't want me to talk anymore because I won't say that because I can explain how what's in this book is being distorted as just saying that.

02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:53.565
It's almost like they picked the good things that I said, but don't want to finish the story except the last quote says that they wouldn't even need a virus.

02:00:54.906 --> 02:00:56.507
So they kind of put it in there, but they didn't.

02:00:56.607 --> 02:00:58.409
That's why I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:00:58.449 --> 02:00:59.990
is just an elaborate hoax on us.

02:01:00.050 --> 02:01:01.251
He's like the Epi-Girl.

02:01:02.312 --> 02:01:03.273
The Epi-Girl joke.

02:01:07.318 --> 02:01:16.883
But it is very significant that no one on earth seems to care that this guy is told a verifiably false story about that Health and Human Services Secretary's Wuhan book in November of 2024.

02:01:18.364 --> 02:01:34.672
A 10 or 20 minute verifiably false story that was complimented by another 20 minute verifiably false story about the SV40 contamination in the transfection that this guy and Robert Malone and Brian Hooker will not call transfection.

02:01:35.663 --> 02:01:37.919
The old technology being recycled.

02:01:41.442 --> 02:01:42.883
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

02:01:42.943 --> 02:01:45.325
That is actually where we are.

02:01:45.425 --> 02:01:46.887
I can name these people.

02:01:46.987 --> 02:01:48.548
These people are guilty.

02:01:48.708 --> 02:02:08.425
They should be prosecuted as frauds on the internet that have misled children and probably led to the damage and death for lots and lots of Americans and covered up the murder of lots and lots of Americans, including the opioid epidemic that they are indirectly responsible for perpetuating.

02:02:09.105 --> 02:02:10.306
It's a narrative trap.

02:02:10.946 --> 02:02:25.714
That's why he is here right now saying the same bullshit that they had Andrew Huff auditioning saying in 2022 and the same bullshit that they tried to take out of context and quote me as saying in this book.

02:02:26.601 --> 02:02:28.802
That quote is taken from the Rixey interview.

02:02:28.862 --> 02:02:34.303
It's not taken from a recent conversation with me and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:02:34.323 --> 02:02:38.665
Because during the writing of the book, I was already telling them that the diffuse proposal was fake.

02:02:39.365 --> 02:02:40.846
They just wouldn't put it in the book.

02:02:41.626 --> 02:02:43.246
Because as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:02:43.326 --> 02:02:49.908
told me in a Zoom meeting, this is a historic document, and so we have to record what people said and what people thought.

02:02:50.389 --> 02:02:54.410
And so that's for the next book, that the diffuse proposal is fake.

02:02:55.523 --> 02:02:57.264
Maybe he really meant that, but I doubt it.

02:02:58.805 --> 02:03:02.266
But it shows you that he's probably just an absolute puppet.

02:03:02.306 --> 02:03:03.027
He's a clown.

02:03:03.447 --> 02:03:08.330
He doesn't know how bad he's been used because Team Worst Case Scenario convinced him that he was a hero.

02:03:09.010 --> 02:03:22.897
Team Worst Case Scenario that was put in place to make sure that transfection would never be realized, and instead there would be all these myths about, you know, spike protein doing all kinds of nasty things, which would have already been expected from transfecting healthy people.

02:03:25.285 --> 02:03:27.425
That's why I have pictures with Jay Bhattacharya.

02:03:28.206 --> 02:03:32.126
It's because I did everything that I could and got very, very close to breaking them.

02:03:32.226 --> 02:03:35.087
And I'm right at the doorstep of breaking them now.

02:03:35.147 --> 02:03:45.369
Because again, if you just make your own timelines of the people that you think are heroes, you will find something very, very dark and very, very malevolent in those timelines.

02:03:45.749 --> 02:03:47.029
And you won't find it in mine.

02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:50.890
You're not going to find anywhere where I was doing this.

02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:52.950
I was fighting it from the very beginning.

02:03:53.670 --> 02:04:03.035
fighting the use of PCR as some kind of specific diagnostic, fighting the idea that mitochondrial damage or prion disease was being caused by a spike protein.

02:04:03.075 --> 02:04:03.976
That was absurd.

02:04:04.596 --> 02:04:05.197
And I knew it.

02:04:06.457 --> 02:04:07.578
I just didn't know why.

02:04:09.448 --> 02:04:10.088
But now I do.

02:04:10.448 --> 02:04:14.010
It's because pure oxygen causes acute respiratory distress.

02:04:14.050 --> 02:04:19.653
It's because PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool, but it's still being used in every hospital today.

02:04:20.073 --> 02:04:25.596
It's because antibiotics, not using them for pneumonia is a crime.

02:04:25.636 --> 02:04:29.658
And now that I know those facts, I can see that that's murder.

02:04:30.802 --> 02:04:41.206
Now that I know that opioids killed about, I don't know, 700,000 Americans under the age of 50 in America in the last five years, I can now see that that's kind of murder.

02:04:42.787 --> 02:04:45.128
And now all you need to do is answer the question, why?

02:04:45.228 --> 02:04:47.649
Why would Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project?

02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:50.350
Why would Claire Craig of the 100,000 Genomes Project?

02:04:50.370 --> 02:04:55.792
Why would a fake molecular biologist like Jessica Rose be so involved

02:04:56.798 --> 02:05:13.090
Why would an AI expert like Claire Craig and a genome expert like Claire Craig and an AI expert like a Bitcoin expert like Kevin McKernan be involved if it's not to collect the data that's only going to be here once in a multi-generational timeline.

02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:19.575
We're never going to have this much data to collect again because there will never be this many experimental animals on earth again.

02:05:20.814 --> 02:05:28.843
And they know that, so they want your grandchildren from birth to death, and they're going to get it in any way that they can, because it's the Human Genome Project.

02:05:28.883 --> 02:05:42.658
So they're definitely going to lie to you about a population pyramid, and they're definitely going to put a few cheap actors on social media to make sure that you blame everything on the novel virus that doesn't exist instead of on the transfection that should have never been used.

02:05:45.247 --> 02:05:46.468
because they need the data.

02:05:46.888 --> 02:06:01.519
More importantly, they need to test iterations of the collecting of the data, the processing of the data, the speed of the data acquisition, so that the machine learning algorithm, once they unleash it, can start to interface medical records with genomic data to see if there are any patterns.

02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:05.122
And then those predictions need to be validated.

02:06:05.182 --> 02:06:08.545
And so there's iterations that occur, just like the games of Go.

02:06:09.586 --> 02:06:10.246
They're not ready yet.

02:06:11.937 --> 02:06:14.698
They're still building the infrastructure necessary to do this.

02:06:14.738 --> 02:06:15.918
They tell you the truth.

02:06:16.378 --> 02:06:20.939
They told you the truth about this with the Trump administration building all these new AI centers.

02:06:20.999 --> 02:06:22.479
It's not for videos.

02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:25.720
It's for the Human Genome Project.

02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:34.482
There is no bigger game on Earth than the irreducible complexity of the human genome and the human biology that is us.

02:06:35.262 --> 02:06:40.343
Taking over the evolution of the species has always been their goal, always been their game.

02:06:41.858 --> 02:07:04.003
a few cheap anti-vax fake movements on the internet if that's all it takes to corral the Useless objection to it, then they'll do it for sure And I think these people in the middle row are the ones they're the Lollapalooza of liars and it goes all the way back to the beginning when the stooge

02:07:06.041 --> 02:07:15.087
The Stooge, Steve Bannon, streamed with Steve Hatfill, who would be on stage with all of these people five years later in Romania, or four years later in Romania.

02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:21.812
They all decided that they were going to take a gamble on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., because that's what the national security script required.

02:07:22.232 --> 02:07:31.519
They had a foolproof scripting crew, including a guy from the Human Genome Project, including two sons of the

02:07:32.139 --> 02:07:39.625
the intellectual property lawyer that helped modernize the FDA with the dad of the stooge that they were going to use.

02:07:43.988 --> 02:07:45.790
Everyone has a timeline, including me.

02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:46.791
I'm just proud of mine.

02:07:46.831 --> 02:07:47.992
They're not so proud of theirs.

02:07:48.112 --> 02:07:50.093
Mine reveals them as frauds.

02:07:50.213 --> 02:07:52.915
Mine reveals all of these people as actors.

02:07:52.996 --> 02:07:55.658
Mine reveals this as a national security

02:07:56.866 --> 02:08:10.556
organization operation that started with the recruiting of a scientist, Brian Hooker, back in around 2014, around the year that Brandy Vaughn was getting started funding her, founding her organization.

02:08:11.497 --> 02:08:15.981
And then years later, of course, they'd make lots of videos and make her feel like she was a part of things.

02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:26.886
Um, but in the end they would have to kill her and they would be the ones that would take over this, uh, little, this little movement and use it to propel the clown.

02:08:27.427 --> 02:08:29.128
Um, Robert F. Kennedy jr.

02:08:29.188 --> 02:08:30.068
Into the spotlight.

02:08:30.128 --> 02:08:31.109
And that's where we are now.

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:32.509
They're not happy little accidents.

02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:35.471
They are a military contract that shows.

02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:41.034
Again, that this is a military project, not a public health project.

02:08:41.294 --> 02:08:49.560
And so Mary Talley Bowden is a doctor from Texas that was on my show in 2022 as part of the stream of people that was trying to convince me to go along with the narrative.

02:08:50.221 --> 02:09:02.871
And she is a doctor who claims that she used ivermectin to save lots of people's lives, but she also uses regularly PCR to diagnose 18 different viral diseases for which she treats them with ivermectin and other stuff.

02:09:03.331 --> 02:09:05.613
And so like Pierre Corey, she is on a script

02:09:06.093 --> 02:09:13.695
that she may not have the professional expertise to understand how dumb it is, but nevertheless, she's gone along with it.

02:09:13.755 --> 02:09:16.475
Nevertheless, she has gotten a lot of money and fame from it.

02:09:16.915 --> 02:09:32.219
And nevertheless, she's now got a podcast where she amplifies these other actors that have been in front of us for quite some time, including this absolute chump of a lawyer, Mendenhall, who was the lawyer for Grace Shara.

02:09:33.223 --> 02:09:38.984
who was probably primarily killed by supplementary oxygen and that was never even mentioned in the trial.

02:09:39.525 --> 02:09:55.328
And Scott Shara also unfortunately goes on as a scripted actor, came to my in-person gigaohm event and tried to sabotage it with a ridiculous South Park produced movie about Satan.

02:09:56.349 --> 02:10:01.770
And I didn't even let Joe Marshall or myself or Mark Kulak go on stage with him because of what he did.

02:10:02.890 --> 02:10:16.418
And now you can see very clearly my instincts were right because his lawyer is now, and he is now promoting this nonsense that the contamination of the shot has SB40 in it and they are covering it up.

02:10:16.458 --> 02:10:26.925
And they're not saying Biontech, and they're not saying that SB40 is in every molecular construct associated with recombinant DNA and every recombinant DNA manufacturing

02:10:27.445 --> 02:10:29.007
you know, facility on Earth.

02:10:29.547 --> 02:10:44.080
It might be one of the most abundant constructs in nature now that we use it the way that we use it, and they're pretending that the only possible source of this signal could be the contamination of the mRNA shots that Buckholter and McKernan have found for us.

02:10:45.201 --> 02:10:45.942
Stop lying!

02:10:46.742 --> 02:10:48.124
Stop lying!

02:10:49.676 --> 02:10:50.336
It gets worse.

02:10:50.536 --> 02:10:56.037
It's a countermeasure for military readiness.

02:10:56.517 --> 02:10:57.697
It says it right in there.

02:10:57.758 --> 02:11:02.178
So, you say that to people and they think you're crazy, like this is public health.

02:11:02.418 --> 02:11:03.098
No, it isn't.

02:11:03.379 --> 02:11:10.120
It's military, it's countermeasure, but they had requirements nevertheless to have a safe and effective product for us.

02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:11.880
And that is not what we got.

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.780
And we are not military, by the way.

02:11:13.981 --> 02:11:14.741
I'm a private citizen.

02:11:18.134 --> 02:11:19.757
It's almost like he might be military.

02:11:19.938 --> 02:11:20.739
And where is this?

02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:22.222
This is on Substack, right?

02:11:23.479 --> 02:11:28.483
Watch more for Mary Bowden on substack.com, which of course is one of these very fraudulent.

02:11:28.503 --> 02:11:37.650
SV40 was intentionally put in there, in the plasmid base, because it actually causes the E. coli to grow rapidly.

02:11:37.690 --> 02:11:41.173
It does not cause the E. coli to grow.

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:46.957
So again, if this is a real scholar trying to win, then he's on a pretty stupid script.

02:11:47.798 --> 02:11:52.782
SV40 causes the bacteria to replicate the plasmid that it's in.

02:11:53.562 --> 02:12:02.567
So if you want a bacteria to make lots of copies of the DNA plasmid that you put into the bacterial culture, you use S40 to do it.

02:12:02.627 --> 02:12:10.871
Because then when the bacteria divides, there will be lots of plasmids in the sister cells.

02:12:12.292 --> 02:12:20.636
If you don't have a strong promoter of plasmid copying, then in the end this artificial chromosome won't be copied.

02:12:21.493 --> 02:12:22.333
Because that's what it is.

02:12:22.393 --> 02:12:23.214
It's a plasmid.

02:12:23.434 --> 02:12:29.757
It's an artificial bacterial artificial chromosome that gets copied because that's what bacteria do to their chromosomes when they're dividing.

02:12:29.797 --> 02:12:33.879
And so SV40 does not cause the freaking bacteria to grow.

02:12:33.939 --> 02:12:36.300
It causes them to copy the recombinant DNA.

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:43.164
It's a central part of producing a large quantity of RNA or DNA using recombinant methods.

02:12:44.346 --> 02:12:45.907
And this is not a surprise.

02:12:46.568 --> 02:12:48.610
This is how it's been done for 20 years.

02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:53.974
And so for any of these people to say that this contamination was unexpected.

02:12:54.535 --> 02:12:55.276
Stop lying!

02:12:55.776 --> 02:13:00.960
To say that they didn't know that this would happen from the very beginning like Mike Yeadon pretends to do.

02:13:01.021 --> 02:13:01.301
Stop!

02:13:03.582 --> 02:13:27.588
to pretend that that every single recombinant protein has to you didn't know that every single recombinant protein produced by these methods goes through a step to remove all the DNA and RNA and that that step can't be used to produce a transfection agent like this to pretend that none of these people could have known that that's ridiculous

02:13:28.484 --> 02:13:42.439
And yet here we now have a scripted actor from Texas and a scripted actor from wherever he is enacting a podcast script that Kevin McKernan has found contamination and these people lied about it.

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:48.263
of SV40 that they put in there and it makes things grow.

02:13:48.403 --> 02:13:58.492
Well, cancer is uncontrolled growth, so it almost makes sense, logically, just from a common sense, non-scientific view, you don't want to mess around with SV40.

02:13:58.612 --> 02:14:00.433
It's triggering growth of cells.

02:14:00.513 --> 02:14:00.734
Well,

02:14:01.394 --> 02:14:05.677
It's maybe it's good cells, maybe it's bad cells, but it's triggering growth of cells.

02:14:06.178 --> 02:14:07.819
And I think that's the key to this.

02:14:08.039 --> 02:14:10.321
And and then Kevin is very clear about.

02:14:10.501 --> 02:14:12.822
I think Brooke Jackson is probably a victim here.

02:14:13.043 --> 02:14:17.166
I mean, she probably is a whistleblower that now needed to be controlled.

02:14:17.246 --> 02:14:18.627
And so she is being controlled.

02:14:18.667 --> 02:14:19.047
I don't know.

02:14:19.547 --> 02:14:21.489
She just isn't getting enough popularity.

02:14:21.529 --> 02:14:22.890
She's not making a lot of money.

02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:25.552
She I don't know if she knows she has a book or anything like that.

02:14:26.112 --> 02:14:47.182
And all of these people are always standing in front of her and kind of telling her story for her, so... Somehow or another, Brooke Jackson's not very high on my list of meddlers, but these two shitheads, especially Mendenhall, because I've met him in person at the Brownstone Institute and talked to him about strict scrutiny, and he kind of laughed at me, along with that Bobby Ann Cox, who's also a fraud.

02:14:48.198 --> 02:15:05.543
And because I've had married Tally Bowden on my show four years ago, and because I've tried to communicate with her since, I'm pretty sure that, you know, her getting on the Danny Jones podcast with Dr. Krause or Dr. Cruz and Callie Means was not by accident, but again, scripted.

02:15:05.963 --> 02:15:07.623
And now she's got her own podcast.

02:15:08.063 --> 02:15:08.964
And so it's pretty funny.

02:15:08.984 --> 02:15:13.325
The fact that they knew the SV40 segment was in there,

02:15:14.225 --> 02:15:25.616
And they hid that in the documents that they presented to the European Medicines Agency, to the FDA, to all the pharmaceutical regulators.

02:15:27.698 --> 02:15:31.202
And so we're supposed to believe, again, that this is all accidental.

02:15:32.043 --> 02:15:32.903
We just got lucky.

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:41.318
In reality, sorry, in reality what you have here is, what do I want, this one?

02:15:42.639 --> 02:15:42.979
This one?

02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:44.940
This one?

02:15:45.941 --> 02:15:50.765
Playback, automatically, loop, and slideshow, current slide.

02:15:52.005 --> 02:15:59.351
So what we have here is that two days ago, this is the only video that there is of it because apparently Andrew Huff had some technical problems, but

02:16:00.768 --> 02:16:06.854
Mary Talley Bowden was going to interview Andrew Huff about food supply issues.

02:16:06.934 --> 02:16:22.348
Now remember, food supply issues is what he was interviewed with CHD about all those years ago in 2022 with that Shabab Muhammad from South Africa.

02:16:23.393 --> 02:16:33.298
Like he was on talking about food supply contamination or food supply chain something something.

02:16:34.439 --> 02:16:38.481
And now we're supposed to believe that he's on Tucker Carlson and it's all good.

02:16:40.302 --> 02:16:41.842
What a long strange trip has been.

02:16:41.902 --> 02:16:46.505
Ladies and gentlemen, PCR is still used as a viral diagnostic and nobody cares.

02:16:46.565 --> 02:16:48.146
The FDA doesn't give a shit.

02:16:48.979 --> 02:16:53.603
that the illusion was created using these tests and no one's investigated it.

02:16:53.683 --> 02:16:58.267
The fraud of 2020, 21, 22 is not being investigated.

02:16:58.367 --> 02:17:04.473
Instead, everybody's focused on the mRNA and cancer and something, something in Israel.

02:17:05.033 --> 02:17:07.535
No one is going for the actual fraud.

02:17:08.296 --> 02:17:09.317
And it's interesting, right?

02:17:09.337 --> 02:17:15.542
That we have all these good guys at the head of all these agencies, but nobody's going for the fraud that was actually used against us.

02:17:16.343 --> 02:17:22.647
And instead, PCR is still being used widely as a diagnostic with no scrutiny at all.

02:17:22.707 --> 02:17:24.008
Nobody gives a shit anymore.

02:17:24.448 --> 02:17:26.029
It's just the gold standard now.

02:17:28.770 --> 02:17:35.975
Very similarly to how the vast majority of Americans have accepted that the transfection, called a COVID vaccine, worked.

02:17:36.655 --> 02:17:37.896
That the mRNA worked.

02:17:38.789 --> 02:17:49.814
And so the vaccine schedule will be expanded, and it will never be questioned, and any questioning will be neutralized because there will be clowns on your team.

02:17:50.314 --> 02:18:06.782
Because if you question the vaccines, you will be on the same team as Soph, the same team as Mary Holland, the same team as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the same team as Corey, Pierre Corey, the same team as Andrew Wakefield, the same team as Alex Jones.

02:18:08.493 --> 02:18:14.037
And that's by design, because there is no epidemiological evidence of spread, so everybody who can explain it is gone.

02:18:18.901 --> 02:18:21.983
Anticipated rise in all-cause mortality, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:22.023 --> 02:18:24.825
It's super visible in the population pyramid.

02:18:24.885 --> 02:18:28.748
It's just frustratingly visible in the population pyramid.

02:18:28.828 --> 02:18:32.531
I'm going to play a tune, and then I think I'm going to call it a wrap.

02:18:35.393 --> 02:18:38.395
I think, yeah, I'm going to play a tune and I'm going to call it a wrap.

02:18:39.275 --> 02:18:40.456
I love you guys very much.

02:18:40.776 --> 02:18:43.918
Let me just scan ahead here and make sure I got some good slides to come.

02:18:43.978 --> 02:18:44.338
I do.

02:18:46.239 --> 02:18:46.820
Thanks for being here.

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:47.580
I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:18:48.441 --> 02:18:52.583
Don't forget it's Rocktober for a few more days, so expect some good music.

02:18:52.703 --> 02:18:55.625
I hope I have it lined up right, and be well.

02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:23.616
Oh, well

02:19:57.925 --> 02:19:59.440
Won't you drown the hate?

02:22:37.748 --> 02:22:37.828
you
