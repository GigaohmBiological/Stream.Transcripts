WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.320
So sorry, I am very late.

00:14.320 --> 00:20.960
And left hand monkey wrench is first.

00:20.960 --> 00:27.760
I'm going to assume that my sound is okay, but just in case I think it should be fine.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.760
I think I figured out what that glitch was a while ago already and have fixed it.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.360
But if you can give me confirmation, synced is good.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.200
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

00:57.760 --> 01:20.720
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case

01:20.720 --> 01:33.360
scenario, the scary part of the ship thing seems to be the rumors about it maybe being

01:33.360 --> 01:39.840
done via the internet, by a cyber connectivity or some kind of cyber attack.

01:39.840 --> 01:45.880
I think that's probably a rumor at this stage yet, but just realize that given the shipping

01:45.880 --> 01:53.400
industry that we have, there's lots of different ways to attack the infrastructure of a nation.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.000
Is this a shot across our bow?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.600
Is it a threat or is it just an accident?

01:56.600 --> 02:00.240
I don't know, I'm a biologist.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.400
I think truth is good for kids.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.680
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.880
We want everybody to feel good.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.200
That's not the way life is.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.840
You can tell if someone's lying, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.840
And I have lied.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.840
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
I don't want to lie.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.880
I don't think I'm a liar, I try not to be a liar, I don't want to be a liar.

02:25.880 --> 02:26.880
I think it's like-

02:26.880 --> 02:29.880
Can someone check and see if you can find me on YouTube anywhere?

02:29.880 --> 02:33.280
It would be really handy if somebody could see whether the live stream on YouTube is

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
going.

02:34.280 --> 02:43.160
I hate to pull away and to take any bandwidth and try to see if I can see it myself.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.960
If it's hard to find that it's also not really working, right?

02:45.960 --> 02:52.840
If you can find my JC on a bike channel that can't find the live, then that's also a problem.

02:52.840 --> 02:59.600
In case you haven't forgotten, I've got a friend named Nate and he took both shots.

08:43.160 --> 09:04.840
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance low noise

09:04.840 --> 09:09.280
information brief brought to you by a biologist again to remind you this stream and every stream

09:09.280 --> 09:16.240
on every Tuesday from now on is dedicated to a friend Nate who we lost in an untimely

09:16.240 --> 09:21.520
way because of the transfections and I think we need to start to be very frank about how

09:21.520 --> 09:25.800
many people we've lost for something other than a virus.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.040
That's what I think is most important right now as we move forward to start to get people

09:31.040 --> 09:37.520
to focus on the people who were actually lost and not the people who were censored or lost

09:37.520 --> 09:39.480
their YouTube channels.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.120
Again, welcome to the show.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.480
I'm a human just like you coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back

09:44.480 --> 09:47.400
of my kind of weird smelly garage.

09:47.400 --> 09:53.640
I think my wife left the chicken feeder that's outside in the office and it was a little wet

09:53.640 --> 09:54.640
last night's.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.040
I don't know, it smells weird in here.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.360
Anyway, you can't smell that, so that's really good.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.400
We're not at smell-a-vision yet.

10:00.400 --> 10:07.400
Again, this is Giga Home Biological, it's the 26th of March, 2024, it is the fifth year

10:07.400 --> 10:12.240
since we've had, this is, we're going on our fifth year since we had 15 days to flatten

10:12.240 --> 10:19.040
the curve, 60 days to smash the curve if you were a Paul Catrell fan.

10:19.040 --> 10:25.440
This is a time and a place for you if you've never found me before, if you're here for the

10:25.440 --> 10:29.680
umpteenth time, then you already know that what we are fighting against is something

10:29.680 --> 10:35.160
that has gone on for a very long time and it's only a question of whether or not it's

10:35.160 --> 10:39.640
been turned up to 11 for the last three years or whether it's turned up to 11 for

10:39.640 --> 10:41.720
the last 10 years.

10:41.720 --> 10:48.360
The real deal is that the internet and social media and our cell phones and all of our devices

10:48.360 --> 10:57.880
and all of these different applications have allowed them to and mesh us in a web of what

10:57.880 --> 11:04.240
they call knowledge, what is it actually noise, that is carefully curated so that if you try

11:04.240 --> 11:09.280
to escape or you try to understand the shape of it, you will inevitably run into these

11:09.280 --> 11:16.120
fake barriers which are essentially defined by people on the internet who agree to disagree

11:16.120 --> 11:20.120
about things and agree not to talk about other things.

11:20.120 --> 11:28.720
And as sort of ridiculously simple as it sounds, it is exactly the same as your most famous

11:28.720 --> 11:34.200
favorite magician if you actually found out how any or all of those tricks were done

11:34.200 --> 11:39.280
would be horribly disappointed because you would find out it's just a couple of people

11:39.280 --> 11:40.760
lying to you.

11:40.760 --> 11:47.100
And no matter how clever it is, the way that they lie to you, it is nevertheless a lie.

11:47.100 --> 11:52.200
And if we start to think about this as a show that we ever attended, we were given tickets

11:52.200 --> 11:56.760
to the pandemic, we sat down in our seats and we had no idea that half of the people

11:56.760 --> 12:00.160
that were in the audience were in on the gag.

12:00.160 --> 12:04.760
And so when the people on stage told us that you better wear your masks and half of the

12:04.760 --> 12:11.320
people in the audience did it with vigor, it was a lot more difficult for us to resist.

12:11.320 --> 12:17.440
And being in an experiment or in a performance where people are working against you because

12:17.440 --> 12:21.960
it's part of the experiment is a very devious position to be in indeed.

12:21.960 --> 12:26.600
In fact, on bench academic science, that means that somebody's walking in an honor

12:26.600 --> 12:32.760
out front door, which I guess at one, I think that's okay.

12:32.760 --> 12:39.920
The idea is that if you think of a national security operation that was run on us and

12:39.920 --> 12:52.320
the world and that that national security operation can be best described as analogous

12:52.320 --> 12:58.920
to a magician's performance in Las Vegas, where the stage was social media, the stage

12:58.920 --> 13:04.760
was television, the stage was the pulpit in the White House, the stage was the FDA and

13:04.760 --> 13:12.920
the CDC pulpits, the stage was the internet and the intellectual dark web.

13:12.920 --> 13:18.560
And all of these pretend voices that have purported to be fighting for our freedom,

13:18.560 --> 13:25.040
but in reality, we're coordinatedly working this theater.

13:25.040 --> 13:32.440
And if you see it as a stage thing with audience members engaged in fooling the other audience

13:32.440 --> 13:40.080
members to enhance the likelihood that they would suspend their disbelief, then you see

13:40.080 --> 13:45.080
why if if you sat down a bunch of bureaucrats, if you sat down a bunch of military leaders,

13:45.080 --> 13:49.840
if you sat down a bunch of politicians and people with clearances and told them that

13:49.840 --> 13:53.480
this is the way.

13:53.480 --> 13:58.040
And then you pulled the you rang the bell and everybody went to work.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.240
This is where we are.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.480
And since everybody understands it for what it is, then none of them see the cognitive

14:06.480 --> 14:13.400
dissonance in telling us that it is the way it is when it isn't because that was the

14:13.400 --> 14:17.600
design of the plan in the first place, the people that were planted in the audience already

14:17.600 --> 14:20.880
knew they were planted in the audience.

14:20.880 --> 14:26.240
They already understood their role in the show.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.560
And now there may be other people in the audience who have decided to participate in a way that

14:30.560 --> 14:35.200
that's not scripted and that those people that were planted in the audience have been

14:35.200 --> 14:38.560
very skilled at allowing them to participate.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.400
But that's probably part of the show too.

14:41.400 --> 14:47.800
And no doubt that they've gained that out before this was finally executed.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.320
This is a quote from the 19, sorry, I don't know how to do the weatherman thing.

14:52.320 --> 14:59.800
This is a quote from the 1920s, I think it's 1924.

14:59.800 --> 15:04.200
This is back when they could do it with radio and television.

15:04.200 --> 15:09.920
Please tell me you have no problem imagining that when we give them our brains on Twitter,

15:09.920 --> 15:12.960
we give them our brains and attention on Facebook.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.800
We give them our brains and attention on these devices and these applications that they can

15:17.800 --> 15:25.280
surely consciously and intelligently manipulate our habits and opinions.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.360
Of course, you believe them.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.720
But for some reason, we're supposed to be afraid of the AI that's to come, the AI in

15:31.720 --> 15:36.320
the future instead of the machines that are being used by other men to control us right

15:36.320 --> 15:41.920
now to steal from dude.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.880
And that's the magic of where we are that if you just boil it down to that, you can see

15:45.880 --> 15:52.920
the people who are are medlers because they are purporting even the ones that do say that

15:52.920 --> 15:58.680
they're thinking across modalities and talking about the whole big picture like Robert

15:58.680 --> 16:02.880
Malone often does, he doesn't get to the heart of this at all.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.880
In fact, he pushes the AI scary thing.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.680
He pushes the gain of function virus thing.

16:08.680 --> 16:13.800
He pushes the collapse of the dollar, but something, something, something, but never actually

16:13.800 --> 16:18.040
gets to the heart of it, which is fractional reserve banking.

16:18.040 --> 16:23.200
The idea that if you can create money and you decide who uses that power and how it

16:23.200 --> 16:27.760
gets used and who has to follow the rules very strictly, then you can set up a system

16:27.760 --> 16:35.080
where corporations can go bankrupt, but college students can't.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.280
And that's the system that we live in right now, not saying it's good or bad.

16:38.280 --> 16:43.880
This is just the way it is, a corporation declares bankruptcy of billions of dollars

16:43.880 --> 16:47.280
is what happens.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.920
But there is no way that a college student who went to a very bad university and got

16:52.920 --> 16:57.400
a very dumb degree because that university was very happy to give it to them and had

16:57.400 --> 17:01.720
a financial aid office that was very happy to get them to sign the right papers so that

17:01.720 --> 17:08.640
all $15,000 of every year's tuition would be covered.

17:08.640 --> 17:15.080
You can blame it all on the student if you want to rather than the lawmakers that made

17:15.080 --> 17:19.040
the bills or the people at those lending agencies or the universities that said, oh,

17:19.040 --> 17:23.440
my gosh, great, thanks, we'll raise our tuition, we'll pay everybody more, we'll hire more

17:23.440 --> 17:27.560
things, we'll build more buildings.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.920
But the student loan thing is an issue that comes right back to the universities.

17:30.920 --> 17:36.800
The same universities that we're totally happy to accept are corrupt, are teaching our kids

17:36.800 --> 17:43.440
terribly, are responsible for all kinds of bad things and bad ideas, wasting money, but

17:43.440 --> 17:47.040
when it comes to student loans, it's all the student's fault.

17:47.040 --> 17:53.480
So think about the kind of conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits has occurred in

17:53.480 --> 17:59.240
order for people to be very convinced that helping people with student loans is absolutely

17:59.240 --> 18:04.240
absurd and I didn't go to college, I don't have loans, so why should I help them?

18:04.240 --> 18:11.520
And those same people have never considered the oddity of corporate bankruptcy or personal

18:11.520 --> 18:16.760
bankruptcy for that matter, which is totally okay.

18:16.760 --> 18:22.480
And so it's bizarre because that is obviously, if you think objectively about it, that's

18:22.480 --> 18:26.480
only because people want you to scream about that, otherwise it wouldn't rise all over

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
the internet.

18:27.480 --> 18:35.320
And once you see it that way, then all of these things need a real inspection.

18:35.320 --> 18:39.720
Because in reality, we are being governed by asking the wrong questions and being convinced

18:39.720 --> 18:47.240
that these questions are much smarter than they are, in fact, they're dumb questions.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.840
And once you see it that way, then you see why informed consent comes back to the fore

18:52.840 --> 18:57.120
all the time, because informed consent is what one would have if you were in a free

18:57.120 --> 19:01.320
country, if you were in a free republic, you would have informed consent.

19:01.320 --> 19:07.280
If you were a real citizen with real voting rights, you would have informed consent.

19:07.280 --> 19:13.120
And these people in our government would be acting with our informed consent, more

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
or less.

19:14.120 --> 19:19.400
I don't know if that's the right legal language or not, but it sure sounds pretty good to me.

19:19.400 --> 19:24.520
And so one of the ways to understand how our informed consent was taken away from us was

19:24.520 --> 19:31.560
to understand that there was a magic show, which was performed with people in the audience

19:31.560 --> 19:37.560
in on the show that has convinced us that there was a pandemic, a combination of people

19:37.560 --> 19:44.160
in the audience that were making new diagnostic tools and other people that were starting

19:44.160 --> 19:47.640
new PCR companies or track and trace companies.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.760
And all these people that seem to be just, wow, this is this is crazy.

19:51.760 --> 19:58.080
This look at all this, the Ant Hill is moving.

19:58.080 --> 20:03.960
And when you look around and you think that it's all real life instead of a show, it was

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
overwhelming.

20:04.960 --> 20:11.760
And that's what all of us did, all of us very naive, including myself, people that thought

20:11.760 --> 20:15.800
the vast majority of what we thought was the real world was the real world, that most

20:15.800 --> 20:20.160
of what we saw in television was the truth, that most of what people published was the

20:20.160 --> 20:25.880
truth, even though we knew in our hearts that, you know, like the things that happened on

20:25.920 --> 20:32.660
9 11 have been sort of obviously mistold, although we might not claim to know what happened.

20:32.660 --> 20:38.840
It's weird how even people like us were not able to apply that skepticism fully to the

20:38.840 --> 20:42.960
whole picture in front of us, but rather just those two buildings over there, just those

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
airplanes.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.960
That's it.

20:44.960 --> 20:48.840
That, that seems weird, but everything else seems kosher.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.600
So as long as you tell a good story, then it's totally okay.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.240
It's when the details don't match up that things start to get hairy.

20:57.240 --> 21:02.400
And it seems to me that with the pandemic, because they closed the trap too early, because

21:02.400 --> 21:09.760
they, they went all in before we were afraid enough or confused enough.

21:09.760 --> 21:16.000
There are sufficient people outside of the illusion to rescue.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.440
I do really think it's possible.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.600
I just think that they're using all of their might, all of their social media power, all

21:21.600 --> 21:27.480
of their dirty tricks, all of their, their illusions, all of their disguises to make

21:27.480 --> 21:31.600
sure that we don't figure out that we're actually really close to a threshold moment

21:31.600 --> 21:36.280
where irrespective of who got us there, we're all going to be able to wake up and leave

21:36.280 --> 21:41.760
these, these medlers behind, because once we understand the whole picture, it doesn't

21:41.760 --> 21:44.800
matter who's selling an Ivermectin book.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.920
Once we understand the whole picture, it doesn't matter who's running that study or who's doing

21:48.920 --> 21:51.840
that group or who's on that telegram chat.

21:51.840 --> 21:57.160
Once we understand the big picture, then any of these one trick ponies will be completely

21:57.160 --> 22:01.520
irrelevant rather than part of a relevant barbershop quartet that everybody thinks is

22:01.520 --> 22:04.480
such harmony.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.040
I think that's the reason why the illusion of consensus was something that needed to be

22:09.040 --> 22:16.400
almost stolen and diluted, because you had to, you had to take this and make something

22:16.400 --> 22:21.960
other than an illusion of consensus about a novel virus in order to dilute the power

22:21.960 --> 22:23.520
of this idea.

22:23.520 --> 22:29.760
It's just unfortunate that maybe a friend was involved in, in that operation, wittingly

22:29.760 --> 22:33.240
or unwittingly, and that's what I find most disappointing about it.

22:33.240 --> 22:38.520
I think this faith in a novel virus is something that is really essentially an attack on us

22:38.520 --> 22:46.360
in our way of life, whatever you want to call it, baseball and apple pie, true freedom

22:47.360 --> 22:50.600
not whatever we're talking about now.

22:50.600 --> 22:56.920
And that story, this story here that's on the on the screen is how they're doing it,

22:56.920 --> 23:00.000
how they intend to do it to our children.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.520
Create enough chaos in their mind and enough insecurity with the adults in the world that.

23:07.520 --> 23:16.200
You know, you'll see very soon we'll have a kind of middle aged adult 30 year old

23:16.200 --> 23:22.120
kids, thinking that they belong in Congress, thinking that they belong on states and and

23:22.120 --> 23:29.120
rejecting the 50 year olds like me and you and the 40 year olds and maybe even the 60

23:29.120 --> 23:32.440
year olds, they're all going to get rejected because of this, you know, all these old

23:32.440 --> 23:35.800
people, including the old person in office right now.

23:35.800 --> 23:41.840
That's part of the intergenerational fracturing that that was probably intended with regard

23:41.840 --> 23:47.600
to the pandemic to try and make sure that most of the skeptics were old and most of

23:47.600 --> 23:49.960
the people on the good side were young.

23:49.960 --> 23:54.680
And so then in the end, when the next one comes along, we can glump all these old people

23:54.680 --> 23:58.800
into one group, transfect them all.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
I don't know.

23:59.800 --> 24:05.560
I'm a bit, I'm a bit off target here and I'm wasting a little time, but I feel as though

24:05.560 --> 24:09.840
we are at a crucial moment where I don't need to address anything else other than to repeat

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
what I'm saying.

24:10.920 --> 24:19.480
And that is that that the people that are on one side, the other, the top, the bottom,

24:19.480 --> 24:22.440
they all agree that there was a virus.

24:22.440 --> 24:26.880
They all agree that it went around the world that infected millions of people and maybe

24:26.880 --> 24:28.680
even killed millions of people.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.240
They all agree.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.680
It doesn't matter what side you're on.

24:31.680 --> 24:39.800
Tony Fauci, Kevin McCarran, Kevin McCurnan, Robert Malone, Meryl Nash.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
Yes.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.800
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:43.800 --> 24:59.600
Peter Desak, Jeffrey Sacks, Kim.com, Dr. Drew, Dr. Victory, Debunk the Funk, Brian Wilson

24:59.600 --> 25:02.040
or whatever is Daniel Wilson, what is his name?

25:02.040 --> 25:04.200
I don't care.

25:04.200 --> 25:09.200
All of them agree that there was a novel virus that probably killed millions of people that

25:09.200 --> 25:14.400
millions of more may have been saved from by transfection, but some of those people

25:14.400 --> 25:16.960
think that the transfection was adulterated.

25:16.960 --> 25:23.560
And so there was damage done that nobody's acknowledging.

25:23.560 --> 25:29.600
But if you carefully dissect that narrative, then neither side right now of all the people

25:29.600 --> 25:35.520
that have any space on social media at all, there is not one person, not one person on

25:35.520 --> 25:42.960
the either team, any team that questions the whole principle of the pandemic in the

25:42.960 --> 25:49.880
first place, not because the virus wasn't deadly or it was very mild because that's

25:49.880 --> 25:56.000
not questioning it and be very clear in your own head that if you say there was no pandemic

25:56.000 --> 26:02.400
because it was never a dangerous virus, because kids or the CFR or the IFR wasn't high enough,

26:02.400 --> 26:11.760
and you are not actively rejecting the idea of the pandemic, you are giving them the pandemic.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.200
And that's exactly what they want.

26:14.200 --> 26:24.000
What you need to realize is that the principle, the idea that an RNA molecule can pandemic

26:24.000 --> 26:31.840
using it as a verb, can pandemic can go from a point to being everywhere on earth.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.200
That's the verb pandemic.

26:35.200 --> 26:40.440
If the guitar behind me pandemics, then at some point in time at the end of the pandemic,

26:40.440 --> 26:49.040
there should be a Paul Reed Smith custom guitar in every place on earth and every human on

26:49.040 --> 26:53.240
earth, every human on earth should own one, then it's a pandemic.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.680
So you might say something like cell phones, there's a pandemic of cell phones because

26:57.760 --> 27:00.160
once we started making them, they're everywhere now.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.600
So there was a pandemic of cell phones.

27:03.600 --> 27:12.800
But you can imagine all of the energy and work and human whatever that goes into that going

27:12.800 --> 27:19.200
from one iPhone on the stage to an iPhone in everyone's pocket.

27:19.200 --> 27:25.040
And here, biologically speaking, the model that we've been handed is that an RNA molecule

27:25.040 --> 27:27.600
that gets leaked.

27:27.600 --> 27:31.680
I think Robert Malone once told the story about the idea that they were recycling things

27:31.680 --> 27:38.280
from the laboratory in Wuhan and that after they used the animals for laboratory experiments,

27:38.280 --> 27:42.000
they would also take them down the street to the market and sell them, which is just

27:42.000 --> 27:45.880
hilarity beyond hilarity.

27:45.880 --> 27:50.640
And again, wherever whatever story you want to tell, they took the laboratory animals

27:50.640 --> 27:59.920
out of the market and they opened up a WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology stall at the Wuhan

27:59.920 --> 28:06.920
market and they sold control group and experimental group Golden Hamsters and the experimental

28:06.920 --> 28:08.640
group was half price.

28:08.640 --> 28:14.560
Whatever story you want to tell, there was RNA in a small place and then it pandemiced

28:14.560 --> 28:17.280
and now we can find it everywhere.

28:17.280 --> 28:22.720
And there are lots of very useful products and methodologies to find it everywhere.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.400
That's the story that we're told.

28:24.400 --> 28:33.520
And not only that, but we're told it in a consensus sort of way everyone agrees.

28:33.520 --> 28:39.360
And so we have to be very careful because everyone also has a great faith in a great

28:39.360 --> 28:44.560
deal of this mythology around the biology of it.

28:44.560 --> 28:50.040
And so the very slippery slope is that gain of function RNA went endemic is going to

28:50.040 --> 28:56.640
permanently instill in our children that something like a fear and cleavage site, for example,

28:56.640 --> 29:00.520
can endow a virus with the ability to pandemic.

29:00.520 --> 29:05.000
And without that fear and cleavage site, it can't.

29:05.000 --> 29:13.400
We could also get to a stage where our kids actually believe that prions and chronic wasting

29:13.400 --> 29:18.200
and this kind of thing is something that can be caused by protein misfolding and that

29:18.200 --> 29:24.360
it's a natural thing that occurs as opposed to something caused by a parasite or something

29:24.360 --> 29:29.720
caused by a bacteria or something caused by a toxin, whatever it might be in each of these

29:29.720 --> 29:36.840
cases, which very few of them have been substantiated as well as you might like to think.

29:36.840 --> 29:43.840
And so I do apologize for not starting today, but in the next couple days, for sure, we're

29:43.840 --> 29:50.160
going to start doing real hard work, you and I together on the stream, about prions and

29:50.160 --> 29:55.080
about the literature that supports them and how we understand what they do and what the

29:55.080 --> 30:02.040
pre-on protein does when it's not doing this stuff that apparently it does in these papers.

30:02.040 --> 30:08.560
But right now, the important thing to understand is that the faith in a novel virus is starting,

30:08.560 --> 30:11.160
it essentially is a faith in a novel biology.

30:11.160 --> 30:16.640
And that model is something that that's where we attack.

30:16.640 --> 30:22.920
That's where logically we need to probe each of these people who is certain about what

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
has happened.

30:23.920 --> 30:28.960
We need to have them give us details about their model, give us details about how they

30:29.040 --> 30:33.440
mechanistically understand what happened and what's happening.

30:33.440 --> 30:38.800
For example, why don't we already have thousands of people in the hospital with crowdspelled

30:38.800 --> 30:42.480
yachob's disease because of the virus?

30:42.480 --> 30:47.000
Because that was something that a lot of these people said very early on in 2020 was that

30:47.000 --> 30:50.320
there would be neurological symptoms, that people's behavior was going to change, that

30:50.320 --> 30:56.880
maybe we would have amyloidogenic or prion-like diseases in these people.

30:56.880 --> 31:02.040
And so, you know, showing videos of people licking the walls or licking the windows of

31:02.040 --> 31:09.080
closed pubs was a way of suggesting that the COVID virus was going around changing people's

31:09.080 --> 31:12.480
brains because the spike protein was a pre-on weapon.

31:12.480 --> 31:20.360
These people said that in March and in April of 2020 when they had no business having any

31:20.360 --> 31:26.920
opinions about what the spike protein would do or not do, but they all had ideas.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.720
And they weren't all mainstream people.

31:28.720 --> 31:34.480
None of them were mainstream biologists, academic biologists.

31:34.480 --> 31:40.300
They were fringe people, people that had no business calling themselves experts, no business

31:40.300 --> 31:45.120
putting themselves out there.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.200
Was I one of those people?

31:46.200 --> 31:54.160
Well, I don't really know because I never claimed that this was a worst-case scenario.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.000
I fought against the worst-case scenario.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
I fought for the idea that it might be better not to trust the government and not to trust

32:01.000 --> 32:06.080
the pharmaceutical companies and to not take their word for it.

32:06.080 --> 32:11.960
Even though I didn't have the total biological understanding that I think I have now and can't

32:11.960 --> 32:16.640
make as cogent argument as I can now, I was already making a pretty cogent argument

32:16.640 --> 32:24.440
in March 2020 and the people that were rejecting that argument are quite striking because many

32:24.440 --> 32:34.960
of those people are now front and center of the opposition, presenting, being promoted

32:34.960 --> 32:43.000
together, it's incredible, really, because this is the biology they want, I think, your

32:43.000 --> 32:48.560
children to believe us to talk about, us to argue about, and that's not what we're going

32:48.560 --> 32:51.360
to discuss because it's not real biology.

32:51.360 --> 32:58.320
We will discuss it and we will use it to understand how a biological concept can come to exist

32:58.320 --> 33:04.480
in the literature when it might not exist in nature and it will come to understand how

33:04.480 --> 33:10.440
it is that gain of function, virology, has been exaggerated in the literature in exactly

33:10.440 --> 33:15.160
the same way with the, sorry about that, what was I doing with that for?

33:15.160 --> 33:17.000
That was weird.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.320
That is not a symbol of 666 for me, I can tell you that much right now, but I do know that

33:21.320 --> 33:22.320
everybody says that.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.840
I think it's got to be upside down to in order for that to be real.

33:24.840 --> 33:28.480
I was just holding my hand that way, I apologize, but I am sensitive to it because everybody's

33:28.480 --> 33:34.360
talking about it all the time, so anyway, I really think this is important though.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.960
It's important to understand that we have a biological story here that is plausible,

33:39.960 --> 33:51.440
that doesn't require any crazy variables, it doesn't require any as yet unverified biology,

33:51.440 --> 33:58.720
no new principles of biology, no crazy things, just a signal in the background that we weren't

33:58.720 --> 34:04.840
measuring before, because we weren't measuring before, that we have been misled as being

34:04.840 --> 34:08.760
something that is actively spreading.

34:08.760 --> 34:13.080
And now how that was accomplished could be different in different places.

34:13.080 --> 34:19.440
And that's totally okay to what extent it was deliberately done or accidentally done

34:19.440 --> 34:21.200
in different places can be different.

34:21.200 --> 34:22.200
That's totally okay.

34:22.200 --> 34:26.400
We could be very much under the yoke of a bunch of people who did it on purpose with

34:26.400 --> 34:31.520
lots of planted audience members in the United States in the magician show that we attended

34:31.520 --> 34:37.640
here, but in the Netherlands, there could be very few people in on it in Sweden.

34:37.640 --> 34:42.280
There might have been very few people in on it.

34:42.280 --> 34:47.880
And so you have to calibrate your interpretation of what happened around the world because each

34:47.880 --> 34:52.240
one of those places also saw a very different window on social media.

34:52.240 --> 34:54.280
What was the social media like in Germany?

34:54.280 --> 34:56.200
What was the social media like in the Netherlands?

34:56.200 --> 34:58.980
Quite frankly, I don't know.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.040
What was the social media like in Australia?

35:01.040 --> 35:03.840
You don't know and I don't know either.

35:03.840 --> 35:10.200
But we can guess from what we've been shown that the Australians in the New Zealand are

35:10.200 --> 35:15.360
probably pretty convinced that there was COVID because they saw it ravage our country.

35:15.360 --> 35:21.280
They saw us go bananas and they locked down and they didn't have it.

35:21.280 --> 35:25.320
So there's lots of congruent observations when they look out their window and they look

35:25.320 --> 35:28.560
at their phone to make them the believe that it did happen.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.080
Maybe it's not so bad anymore.

35:30.080 --> 35:34.400
Maybe it could happen again.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.960
But they experienced a very different window into reality than what we saw.

35:37.960 --> 35:43.160
And I would be willing to bet that the window that they saw is sufficiently incongruent

35:43.160 --> 35:47.960
from our own so that when we meet together, we're going to disagree about stuff and that's

35:48.000 --> 35:52.400
by design.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.760
The Australians in New Zealanders are going to be especially skeptical of anybody that

35:56.760 --> 36:01.720
says there was no COVID because they saw it.

36:01.720 --> 36:07.800
And the few cases that made it over there were bad.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.040
And the theater was designed that way.

36:10.040 --> 36:16.920
You got to get sophisticated enough to see that this theater is big and it's multifaceted.

36:16.920 --> 36:21.680
It's like a stage with multiple angles and those angles are not visible to the other

36:21.680 --> 36:25.360
people but have bearing on what the other people experience.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.680
Isn't that weird?

36:27.680 --> 36:31.600
Because one audience is hearing the reaction of the other audience, but you don't know

36:31.600 --> 36:35.400
if that other audience is in on it or not.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.640
And what did they see over there?

36:37.640 --> 36:40.920
And so it's a very complicated show.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.400
It's not just a magician on stage with a couple people in the audience.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.600
It's several audiences and some of them you can't see but you're being told what they

36:48.600 --> 36:49.600
see.

36:49.600 --> 36:53.440
Or you're being shown a mirror image of what they see but you're not sure if any of those

36:53.440 --> 36:57.880
people are in on the or the same number of people, maybe the whole audience is corrupt

36:57.880 --> 37:01.880
on the left but the whole audience on the right isn't.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.040
And all of these variables are under their control.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.600
They already figured out what the best way to do it is.

37:07.600 --> 37:15.360
They already tried a couple different combinations and now they're doing it well.

37:15.360 --> 37:20.040
And that's why it was so difficult for all of us to see through it in 2020 and 2021.

37:20.040 --> 37:24.640
They never thought they would have to keep this theater going and keep adding acts and

37:24.640 --> 37:28.720
keep adding actors and keep pulling more people out of the audience.

37:28.720 --> 37:33.520
They're getting very, very close to having no more people in the audience.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.000
Do you understand?

37:36.000 --> 37:39.920
There's no more, almost said a particular name.

37:39.920 --> 37:49.800
There's no more, there are no more Brian Artises to come out of the audience.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.400
There are no more Pierre Corries to come out of the audience.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.600
I don't know if, but you see what I mean.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.120
There's no more new ones anymore.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.560
Now they have to argue with each other.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.600
Now they have to create new rivalries.

38:01.600 --> 38:09.280
Now CHD is promoting Dr. Drew and promoting Dave Rubin because they don't have anybody

38:09.280 --> 38:12.920
else on the bench to pull out.

38:12.920 --> 38:20.720
Now Brett Weinstein is interviewing random, random people about the biology, trying to

38:20.720 --> 38:23.920
confirm his biological ideas.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.320
It's incredible.

38:26.320 --> 38:33.200
People like J. Bottacharia who are faculty at Stanford University just get randomly hooked

38:33.200 --> 38:43.640
up with some guy from Canada to do a sub stack called Illusion of Consensus.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.320
Who's that kid?

38:45.320 --> 38:51.160
Why would Jay choose to do a podcast with him when he could do a podcast with any of

38:51.160 --> 38:55.160
his students or the fellow faculty member?

38:55.160 --> 39:02.040
Why some guy from Canada and why did Brett Weinstein like introduce him to the world

39:02.040 --> 39:03.040
as well?

39:03.040 --> 39:08.280
If you don't see the show for what it is, it's hard to help anybody, but again, seeing

39:08.280 --> 39:11.440
the show isn't for everyone.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.600
Anybody can see the show, but not everybody wants to see it.

39:14.600 --> 39:21.280
Not everybody has the machinery to see it.

39:21.280 --> 39:25.160
I don't know who did this experiment, but I think at one point somebody measured that

39:25.160 --> 39:31.800
like 80% of humans don't have the ability really to say no to an authority figure.

39:31.800 --> 39:37.360
So I mean, this is where we are.

39:37.360 --> 39:42.560
It is our obligation, my obligation at this point, I feel to try and bring as many people

39:42.560 --> 39:47.560
as possible that want to understand this, want to try and understand this to understand

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
it.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.200
And it's a set of bad ideas.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.560
It's a set of assumptions.

39:52.560 --> 39:58.320
It's a set of very poor and simplistic models that we have been forced to accept by the questions

39:58.320 --> 40:05.120
that we have been tricked into answering for the last couple of decades.

40:05.120 --> 40:06.120
And that's why.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.560
Scientific questions I think are very hard to get a handle on.

40:09.560 --> 40:15.960
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in, there's simply too

40:15.960 --> 40:20.280
much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it.

40:20.280 --> 40:29.440
And so in this world of extreme hyperspecialization where it's narrower and narrower subsets of

40:29.440 --> 40:34.000
experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are, the string theorists talking

40:34.000 --> 40:37.400
about how great string theory is, the cancer researchers talking about how they're just

40:37.400 --> 40:41.800
about to cure cancer, the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum

40:41.800 --> 40:43.440
computer that will be a massive breakthrough.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.760
And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening, people just

40:47.760 --> 40:49.160
don't have the authority for this.

40:49.160 --> 40:54.600
And this is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge than you would have

40:54.600 --> 40:59.920
had in 1800 or even in 1900.

40:59.920 --> 41:08.720
It's funny, I don't really, I don't really get it a lot of times what I see in the chat.

41:08.720 --> 41:14.560
I guess you guys are talking to each other, funny, funny, funny little kids.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.640
See they tell the truth all the time, right?

41:16.640 --> 41:22.400
They've told us the truth for a while now.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.880
These fields haven't made much progress.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.240
Cancer hasn't made much progress.

41:27.240 --> 41:30.040
Quantum physics hasn't made much progress.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.920
I would argue that big genetics hasn't made that much progress.

41:33.920 --> 41:38.360
We can collect the data, but we don't understand it because it's too much data.

41:38.360 --> 41:39.920
It's too much analysis.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.400
It's too much variation.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.840
And we aren't sophisticated enough to understand it.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.240
Have we gotten to the stage where we made a few restriction maps of the whole human

41:48.240 --> 41:49.240
genome?

41:49.240 --> 41:52.440
Sure, we did.

41:52.440 --> 41:57.480
Have we gotten to some very low hanging fruit with regard to genetic diseases with one or

41:57.480 --> 41:59.040
two main genetic causes?

41:59.040 --> 42:01.480
Yes, we have, absolutely.

42:01.480 --> 42:06.160
But how much has that helped us understand the symphony of genes that is our natural

42:06.160 --> 42:09.000
homeostatic function of a healthy four-year-old child?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.200
Well, not very far.

42:11.200 --> 42:16.240
Not very far at all.

42:16.240 --> 42:24.760
Just like when you find out why a violin, oh, look, there was a crack in the neck of the

42:24.760 --> 42:25.760
violin.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.760
That's why it broke.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.000
And I understand it very well.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.640
Look, that crack is right there.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.040
If you have a crack, then this violin is going to break.

42:32.040 --> 42:36.840
Well, do you understand how it is that a Stradivarius makes its music then?

42:36.840 --> 42:38.600
You don't have any idea at all.

42:38.600 --> 42:43.840
But you can indefinitely explain how it is that a violin breaks when it has a crack

42:43.840 --> 42:46.440
in its neck.

42:46.440 --> 42:52.760
And that's the kind of understanding that we have of our biology up from a genetic perspective.

42:52.760 --> 43:00.600
We understand how a broken violin can occur when there is a catastrophic error in its

43:00.600 --> 43:03.600
structure related to its function.

43:04.600 --> 43:10.800
But we can't understand how the music is made in a perfect violin.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.760
And that should be the ultimate goal, right?

43:12.760 --> 43:23.200
It shouldn't be to fix these one-note genetic disorders, even though that, I guess, is a

43:23.200 --> 43:28.640
worthy goal, that's a disguised goal.

43:28.640 --> 43:36.320
Those are morally justifiable experiments in genetic manipulation that don't have any

43:36.320 --> 43:41.520
real justification in ethics other than for the particular lives of those people, you see.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.200
So you have to use it.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.680
That's what they're doing here.

43:44.680 --> 43:49.600
It is an elaborate game that they've been playing with us for a very long time to try

43:49.600 --> 43:58.720
and permanently remove our reverence for the sacred, for the sacred of the perfect

43:58.720 --> 44:00.080
child when it's born.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.080
It's perfect.

44:01.080 --> 44:06.240
It doesn't need a vitamin K shot and a HEP B shot.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.920
And we're not there anymore.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.000
That's not this country.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.400
This country still circumcises little boys.

44:14.400 --> 44:23.760
This country still removes the uterus of women whenever they're, they might need it.

44:23.760 --> 44:28.880
We're in a very, very dire straits right now because there are lots of young people who

44:28.880 --> 44:33.600
don't understand this and don't can't hear the truth when it's said to them.

44:33.600 --> 44:39.880
They don't even hear the truth when it's said to them like this, well, wait, it's, they don't

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
even hear the truth.

44:40.880 --> 44:45.720
They can still understand just about everything, 1900, Hilbert could still understand just

44:45.720 --> 44:47.800
about all of mathematics.

44:47.800 --> 44:53.760
And so the sort of, the sort of specialization, I think has made it a much harder question

44:53.760 --> 44:57.800
to get a handle on.

44:57.800 --> 44:58.920
We don't have a handle on it.

44:58.920 --> 44:59.920
They are lying to us.

44:59.920 --> 45:03.520
Of course, Tucker Carlson will tell you that he's lying, can sort of feel it.

45:03.520 --> 45:04.760
You know that he's lying.

45:04.760 --> 45:05.760
You don't want to believe it.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.560
But he most definitely is.

45:07.560 --> 45:08.560
I don't want to.

45:08.600 --> 45:12.840
Unfortunately, no, the reason why I know I don't want to be a liar.

45:12.840 --> 45:16.120
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

45:16.120 --> 45:21.440
The reason why I know is because there, there was a very gigantic lie that he told on national

45:21.440 --> 45:27.240
television after covering a Vanity Fair article that was also a lie, it was a Vanity Fair

45:27.240 --> 45:32.680
article about the group drastic, which at the time I was a member of.

45:32.680 --> 45:38.680
And he said that drastic was started by a guy by the name of Jamie Metzel.

45:38.680 --> 45:44.360
Now the only way that that could have happened is if Jamie Metzel was Billy Bo Stixon.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.720
And it wouldn't surprise me if he was.

45:46.720 --> 45:51.200
But the point was is that if he told the truth about that, then someone else was lying to

45:51.200 --> 45:53.920
me from the very beginning.

45:53.920 --> 46:00.120
That means that the diffuse proposal was actually turned over not to a foreign national with

46:00.120 --> 46:10.880
the pseudonym Billy Bo Stixon, but to an American futurist named Jamie Metzel.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.640
Now I'm not saying that Jamie Metzel started drastic.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.120
I don't think he did, but I don't know who Billy Bo Stixon is.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.840
Billy Bo Stixon is still an anonymous person on Twitter.

46:20.840 --> 46:27.280
And that is the account that started the group that later was called drastic.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.480
The group that kicked me out.

46:29.480 --> 46:33.560
The moment that I said, we have to talk about transfection, not the virus.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.200
The virus doesn't matter.

46:35.200 --> 46:39.120
Where the virus came from doesn't matter because they want to transfect everybody and we shouldn't

46:39.120 --> 46:40.120
be doing that.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.520
Then they asked me to leave.

46:42.520 --> 46:49.440
And I'm not sure if it's split in half right then or before then, but there's drastic

46:49.440 --> 46:52.080
science and drastic.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.080
And I think some people say they're members of both.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.280
Some people aren't.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.960
It's all an elaborate hoax.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.800
And these are the sort of moments.

47:04.800 --> 47:10.640
Political cut I have on the specialization is always that if you analyze the politics

47:10.640 --> 47:15.520
of science, the specialization should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder

47:15.520 --> 47:20.960
to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

47:20.960 --> 47:26.600
And then one should be a little bit suspicious and that's sort of my starting bias.

47:26.600 --> 47:30.360
And I'm going to keep playing this video like every week because I think it is the most

47:30.360 --> 47:33.120
spot on video of any of these people.

47:33.120 --> 47:40.440
And it's just striking that it's this guy's chubby belly saying it because I do think

47:40.440 --> 47:46.400
that this guy is near the top of a group of people at the helm of a weaponized pile of

47:46.400 --> 47:54.320
money or two that is vying for control of America and vying for control of the West,

47:54.320 --> 47:58.040
if you will, because he's invested in Canadian companies.

47:58.040 --> 48:03.440
He's invested in lots of places, you know, and they're all part of this.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.680
Eric Weinstein is definitely part of this.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.000
Brett Weinstein's part of it.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.760
Brett's dad is part of it.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.040
It can be zero doubt anymore.

48:11.040 --> 48:19.320
Otherwise, Brett's dad would not be one of the foremost arbitrators of intellectual property

48:19.320 --> 48:23.600
law specifically in biotechnology in the United States.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.560
Otherwise Brett would be very proud of his dad.

48:25.560 --> 48:30.200
Otherwise Brett would have talked with Bobby Kennedy about his dad and how their dads work

48:30.200 --> 48:34.960
together when he had him on his podcast in November of 2021 and he would have played

48:34.960 --> 48:48.280
the podcast in November of 2021 instead of playing the podcast in February of 2024.

48:48.280 --> 48:52.720
And when again, when you look in the in the rear view mirror and all these things line

48:52.720 --> 48:58.080
up like that, what conclusion can you come to other than, I guess I better not look backwards

48:58.080 --> 48:59.080
anymore.

48:59.080 --> 49:04.200
Otherwise, I might come to the conclusion that this wasn't the pandemic they said it was.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.800
Are we actually all engaging in the lookaway doctrine?

49:06.800 --> 49:11.160
I'm just not going to look because if I look, I know I'm going to figure it out.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.760
Could be.

49:12.760 --> 49:18.080
It could be that there are a lot of people who know, really know in their heart, but just

49:18.080 --> 49:23.840
don't have the courage or the stones to accept it.

49:23.840 --> 49:31.240
Even when they're shown that these people actually admitting it, they can't quite accept it.

49:31.240 --> 49:34.800
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting

49:34.800 --> 49:37.880
the immune system is dumb.

49:37.880 --> 49:43.600
Is something that none of these people make the list will ever talk about or say or acknowledge.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.640
Yeah, that's probably the best way to say it.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.640
Nope.

49:46.640 --> 49:48.560
None of them will.

49:48.560 --> 49:52.520
And curiously, none of the people at the top of CHD will there's plenty of people in

49:52.520 --> 49:57.960
the middle of CHD that have kids that have suffered that have real skin in the game that

49:57.960 --> 49:59.880
agree wholeheartedly with this statement.

49:59.880 --> 50:07.520
But the people at the top, they don't say it.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.800
They've never said it.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.400
That's the weird part.

50:11.400 --> 50:17.880
Try to find a statement where the longtime scientific advisor of CHD, Meryl Nast says

50:17.880 --> 50:25.440
anything about the childhood vaccine schedule in America by itself.

50:25.440 --> 50:34.560
And a place where we see one of these people saying it, it's very rare.

50:34.560 --> 50:41.960
It's very, very, very rare for an organization that at least at the heart is completely opposed

50:41.960 --> 50:45.720
to this.

50:45.720 --> 50:50.560
And there's a reason for it, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a controlled operation.

50:50.560 --> 50:53.040
We are being governed.

50:53.040 --> 51:01.040
And until we stop allowing them us to be governed by this mythology, it's going to continue.

51:01.040 --> 51:03.080
I don't really know all the ways out.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.320
I don't other than one at a time.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.400
We all need to awaken.

51:07.400 --> 51:12.400
We need to just come to realize that there are simple ways to say these things.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.360
There are easy ways to talk about this stuff.

51:15.360 --> 51:24.520
There are very, we could make substantial gains in our general understanding of biology.

51:24.520 --> 51:29.200
We could make substantial gains in the average person's understanding of what really happened

51:29.200 --> 51:30.600
in the pandemic.

51:30.600 --> 51:36.560
But unfortunately, many, many, many people with large platforms, with growing followings,

51:36.560 --> 51:41.960
are still focused on the same thing that they were focused on in 2020.

51:41.960 --> 51:44.520
The same thing.

51:44.520 --> 51:50.360
After four years, they still can't talk about the vaccine schedule in America as a particular

51:50.360 --> 51:51.920
example.

51:51.920 --> 51:59.000
They can't talk about the Prep Act, the Vaccine Act, and the lack of strict liability on vaccines

51:59.000 --> 52:01.400
as just a thing that everybody should understand.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.800
It's very few people.

52:03.800 --> 52:08.880
Lots of people will spend an hour on stage talking about Ivermectin studies.

52:08.880 --> 52:13.800
Lots of people would be happy to break down the details of a remdesivir study for you.

52:13.800 --> 52:18.800
Lots of people would be happy to break down the details of a hydroxychloroquine study for

52:18.800 --> 52:19.800
you.

52:19.800 --> 52:25.120
But not very many people are going to break down the literature of coronaviruses for you.

52:25.120 --> 52:28.960
Not very many people are going to break down the literature of prions for you.

52:28.960 --> 52:37.360
But lots of them are happy to talk about a preprint about prions from last year.

52:37.360 --> 52:46.760
The only person that's taught you immunology 101 to this date in four years is me.

52:46.760 --> 52:55.440
Maybe Dr. Bean, maybe besides that who?

52:55.440 --> 52:56.520
Think about that.

52:56.520 --> 53:01.640
Which of these MDs has taught you about linked recognition?

53:01.640 --> 53:07.280
This is the last time Meryl Nast, Robert Malone, Pierre Corey, Jessica Rose.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.000
When's the last time they mentioned linked recognition?

53:10.000 --> 53:18.600
Do you think that they could explain that at a whiteboard?

53:18.600 --> 53:22.720
Do you see the problem, ladies and gentlemen?

53:22.720 --> 53:26.200
Do you see the problem?

53:26.200 --> 53:27.520
They're spreading ideas.

53:27.520 --> 53:30.080
It's just not the good ones.

53:30.080 --> 53:33.840
They're spreading lots of ideas, just not the good ones.

53:33.840 --> 53:41.440
They're questioning a lot of ideas, just not the ones that need to be questioned.

53:41.440 --> 53:49.120
I want to take a break from hammering that home to watch a video from the past, which

53:49.120 --> 53:50.920
is a video from 11 years ago.

53:50.920 --> 53:55.400
I have no idea what I'm about to find, and I'm going to watch this video for exactly

53:55.400 --> 53:59.280
an hour and then I'm going to stop because I've got basketball this afternoon again

53:59.280 --> 54:03.600
because my boys are so, they're dedicated like Shaolin monks.

54:03.600 --> 54:05.560
Now, they're actually upset.

54:05.560 --> 54:09.560
They were talking to me yesterday in the car that they realized that the place where

54:09.560 --> 54:14.000
we're going is closed on Easter Sunday, and so they were panicking because the rec center

54:14.000 --> 54:19.160
is also closed on Easter Sunday, and what are we going to do for basketball on that

54:19.160 --> 54:20.160
day?

54:20.160 --> 54:26.840
Well, all I can say is I hope with all of my heart that this kind of dedication continues

54:26.840 --> 54:29.400
because I'm sure it's going to pay off for them.

54:29.400 --> 54:32.880
And I'm sure that they're going to have a good time next year in basketball.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.760
It's really nice to see.

54:34.760 --> 54:40.880
And I've got you guys to thank for that because part of the reason why I'm able to do it is

54:40.880 --> 54:50.360
because, well, I mean, people are supporting this stream and we're not, like I said, we

54:50.360 --> 54:51.600
still need more supporters.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.120
We need more support for next month, but so far so good.

54:55.120 --> 54:59.480
And I'm just, I'm just having faith that somehow or another people are going to hear

54:59.480 --> 55:00.480
this stream.

55:00.480 --> 55:05.040
People are going to get the message and enough people that have the means are going to be

55:05.040 --> 55:11.960
moved enough to support me so that this can continue because I think it's the vital work.

55:11.960 --> 55:20.400
It's the only stream on the internet that's trying desperately to reawaken a reverence

55:20.400 --> 55:26.080
for the sacred in and using an appreciation for biology to try and do it.

55:26.080 --> 55:30.320
And so if you think this is a unique message and something that needs to get out, please

55:30.320 --> 55:34.320
take the time to go to GIGO and biological and support my work.

55:34.320 --> 55:39.440
Here is a video from 11 years ago with Craig Bentner and he's going to talk about what

55:39.440 --> 55:45.120
life is that he's going to talk about the challenges of understanding how life works.

55:45.120 --> 55:49.520
And that's all I really know because I read the description and the video description.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.240
So I have no idea what I'm going to hear here.

55:51.240 --> 55:55.920
It could be that we're about to waste an hour of our time, but my guess is that that's

55:55.920 --> 55:56.920
not the case.

55:56.920 --> 55:57.920
Here we go.

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
Thank you, Luke.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.440
T-Shock, Harvest, distinguished guests.

56:02.440 --> 56:06.840
It is a great pleasure and honor for me both on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy and the

56:06.840 --> 56:11.200
Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies to speak on this historic occasion.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.160
My task is to give some of the background to how the remarkable lecture that we celebrate

56:15.160 --> 56:18.000
tonight came to be given.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.040
Let me begin with someone that few of you have probably heard of.

56:23.040 --> 56:28.440
Edmund Taylor Whittaker was a distinguished mathematician, later historian of science,

56:28.440 --> 56:31.680
who spent most of his long career at the University of Edinburgh.

56:31.680 --> 56:37.480
But he did spend some time here as one of the last Royal Astronomers of Ireland.

56:37.480 --> 56:41.880
And he is significant for the story of tonight's lecture for two reasons.

56:41.880 --> 56:47.800
Firstly, while in Dublin, he had a young student, a man called Eamon de Valera, and he inspired

56:47.800 --> 56:54.320
in him a lifelong devotion to mathematics and a great admiration for the legacy of William

56:54.320 --> 56:55.320
Rowan Hamilton.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.680
And we'll come on to that later.

56:58.680 --> 57:04.680
So when de Valera then in the late 1930s began to think of establishing what was then

57:04.680 --> 57:09.400
only the second Institute for Advanced Studies in the world, he naturally turned to his former

57:09.400 --> 57:11.520
teacher for advice.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.400
And Whittaker made one key recommendation.

57:14.400 --> 57:19.120
He told de Valera that the hardest thing to do was to give a comprehensible public

57:19.120 --> 57:23.800
lecture, something I can vouch for actually from personal experience.

57:23.800 --> 57:28.800
And de Valera took this to heart and wrote in to the 1940 act that each school of the

57:28.800 --> 57:33.200
Institute must offer a public lecture every year.

57:33.200 --> 57:38.720
And if it hadn't been for that and the recommendation of Whittaker, we would not be here tonight.

57:38.720 --> 57:43.600
This brings me, of course, naturally on to the next major player in the story, Eamon

57:43.600 --> 57:48.120
de Valera, a remarkable man in many ways.

57:48.120 --> 57:53.120
His political career and influence on Irish society remains a subject of vigorous debate,

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
I think it's fair to say.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.840
I'm not really sure if this is relevant.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.360
I might just fast-forward through it.

57:57.360 --> 58:03.800
In his publication, Judging Dev.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.240
Yeah.

58:07.240 --> 58:12.360
What is perhaps not so widely known is that his interest in science and mathematics was,

58:12.360 --> 58:13.800
in fact, genuine and deep.

58:13.800 --> 58:18.520
And in fact, I recall the previous provost of this college telling me that his life used

58:18.520 --> 58:23.600
to be made miserable because at nine o'clock in the evening, his secretary would tell him

58:23.600 --> 58:29.160
that the also Ucteron was on the phone and the president was having a problem with mathematics

58:29.160 --> 58:31.960
could the provost help him.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.920
Those days are gone, I fear.

58:35.920 --> 58:41.640
So it was this deep admiration for mathematics and science, as well as his instinctive horror,

58:41.640 --> 58:45.920
I think, at the barbarism of the Third Reich, which persuaded him to establish the Dublin

58:45.920 --> 58:51.200
Institute for Advanced Studies in 2014, and to recruit Erwin Schrodinger as the first

58:51.200 --> 58:52.920
director of its school.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.080
So we're talking about the school that he's in.

58:55.080 --> 58:56.960
So I might actually skip this.

58:56.960 --> 59:01.880
I'm sorry if that offends you at all, but maybe this next guy will give a better interest

59:01.880 --> 59:02.880
in the introduction.

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
I don't know.

59:03.880 --> 59:07.280
Thank you, Luke, for putting it in context.

59:07.280 --> 59:10.840
Now I'm going to give a bit of background about what Schrodinger did on this night in

59:10.840 --> 59:16.000
February in 1943, and it's no exaggeration to say that what he did that night sparked

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
a revolution.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.560
He did a ruckus that went off, and we haven't had a few moths in here tonight, for example,

59:21.560 --> 59:24.680
who depended on Schrodinger's water's life lecture to inspire him, for example.

59:24.680 --> 59:25.680
Oh!

59:25.680 --> 59:28.000
Let's all say that we know DNA revolution and agriculture.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Wow!

59:29.000 --> 59:33.240
Well, biotech industry, so as Luke has said a long way away from that time, it gave rise

59:33.240 --> 59:34.240
to the whole industry.

59:34.240 --> 59:36.280
So the importance of the lecture is very important.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.840
Secondly, it was the middle of the second world war.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.840
Holy crap!

59:38.840 --> 59:39.840
There was devastation in Europe.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.280
I swear this is not a difficult thing called Ireland.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
This is an actual accident.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
A bit of countable by a kid.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
I'm not kidding.

59:45.280 --> 59:48.360
Just like the monks had done in the 8th century with the book of Cales, it's very similar

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
that it happened in Ireland.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
This lecture sparked-

59:50.360 --> 59:55.080
This is so weird, because I just bought this book on somebody's recommendation.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.600
And I got a first copy of it.

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.720
It's called What Is Life Mind and Matter by Erwin Schrodinger.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:06.000
So he's talking about the lecture that this book is based on.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.760
I swear on the Bible that I did not know that this was going to-

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760
Oh, wow!

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.720
It is really that book.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.080
This was published in 67, though.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.200
This edition.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.880
So what?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880
Which edition is this?

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.400
It's not the first edition, then.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:31.200
Yeah, the first edition was 44, then reprinted in 45, 48, 51 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.040
And then Mind and Matter was this one.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.040
Okay.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040
Huh.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040
So it's two books in this thing.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.840
I didn't get around to even starting it yet.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
So that's kind of cool.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Okay.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
That makes-

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840
That makes making me more happy.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.400
It sparked a whole revolution and really helped civilization along.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.880
And we had a lecture here.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
If I can-

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.920
Now where's my remote?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.680
So Luca O'Neill's not a good guy.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680
That's pretty funny.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680
Ha ha!

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680
I guess I'm not surprised.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680
Hang on.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680
I've gone too far.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680
Hold on.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:02.520
So we had a conference here, actually, in 1993, to commemorate the 40th anniversary

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.360
of this, called What is Life as Well.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360
And I got a book out of this.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.360
I added this book with-

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.360
See, the thing is-

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.760
Look, the thing is it's not a hoax, okay?

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.760
First of all, let's go-

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.360
I think that's a really good question, is the author of the book in on the hoax.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.520
This is the book we're talking about.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.120
It's actually What is Life and Mind and Matter.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.960
It's two different books.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.160
Like I said, I just got this in the mail, so don't-

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.320
I'm not pulling this off my bookshelf and claiming I had this and read it all along.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:36.240
What I am finding, though, and that's what I do have this bookshelf for, is what I am

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:43.120
finding- I won't roll it into the screen now, though, but what I am finding are many,

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120
many books-

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.000
Sorry, I don't know what you could- Oh yeah, I was standing on that camera.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.360
Many, many books where- Here's Yona Salk, survival of the wisest.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.800
That's a book you ought to read, because that one's shocking.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.000
Molecular Vision of Life by Lily Kay.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.360
And this was one that I was adding to that same shelf.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:11.000
There have been lots of people who have been thinking about what humankind should do with

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.160
the knowledge that we now have.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.960
This book here, this book by Yona Salk- I don't know if you ever heard of Yona Salk.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:25.480
This book argues that now that we know that we are subject to evolutionary pressures,

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:33.200
now that we know how traits are passed from generation to generation, isn't it our obligation

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.640
to use that knowledge?

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.440
Isn't it our obligation as a species to use that knowledge?

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:47.280
Shouldn't we think as a species when we can, even if all other species can't?

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.960
That's what this freaking book's about.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:54.040
And so where do those ideas lead us?

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.080
You can do that.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.600
Use that model in your head very easy.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.360
And I suspect that there's a lot to do with this too, because again, once we understand

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.800
how our genome works, don't we have an obligation to augment it?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.840
Don't we have an obligation to improve it?

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.160
In fact, wouldn't that be part of the natural process of evolution if we did that to ourselves

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.840
because this is the argument that they make, which just completes the circle and outside

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.920
of that circle is everything sacred.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.760
To me, it's extraordinary because it doesn't, you don't have to read a lot of books to find

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:39.480
out that it's a very, very common theme among the highest echelons of these thinkers.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:44.280
That the conclusion is that if we are an exceptional species with exceptional knowledge of ourselves,

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.400
an exceptional knowledge of the universe, it doesn't that come with some moral obligation

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.400
to use it?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.520
And then how should we use it?

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.600
And does the rights of an individual really factor into how we use that knowledge on a

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600
species-wide scale?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600
I don't know.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.160
These people don't think so.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
And so this is cool.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.120
I'm really excited to hear what Craig's got to say now, because now I know.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.680
Take Murphy, a colleague of mine in biochemistry, who said that water's life lecture happened

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:12.680
in Trinity.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.680
Many of us went away over that.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.560
But the book, we were to where it was done in Trinity.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.760
And we published a book.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.280
We edited a book with all these great speakers, came to the conference that were the conference

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280
proceedings.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280
And just the impact.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.400
It was translated into 17 languages amazingly, this proceedings of this event in 1993.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.000
And very importantly, we got all the people who spoke at it to sign the book.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.160
This is the names that came here in 1993.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160
And you see them here.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
They're all very famous people.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.280
John Maynard Smith, Stuart Kauffman, Roger Penrose, Christian Doode, Stephen Jay Gould,

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.280
Gerald Edelman, Jared Diamond.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.640
The next speaker will get better with audio.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.640
This is a part of his ebay.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.680
I would have auctioned it by now.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.400
And that was the water's life version in 1993.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.360
So that just shows you all these people turned up.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.920
Me and Mike Murphy in our mid-20s invited them when they all came along.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.000
And it was a great celebration.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.560
Now, I show this because one of the speakers, Jared Diamond, is a very famous writer.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.400
I wrote a great book called The Third Shimp on Z, and I read it.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.360
Myself and Patty Cunningham for Esauff invited Jared to come.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.720
And he wrote this nice letter back.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.160
He said, apologies, but I'm unable to accept your invitation.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.960
Are you the Luca O'Neill who organized the What is Life Symposium in Trinity some years

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960
back?

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.560
Or to remember at the dinner, your co-organizer reaching over and taking some of your food,

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.320
a common sign of intimacy among primates.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.040
Did that person become your wife?

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040
And she did?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.520
And she's here somewhere, Margaret.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520
There she is.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.520
Round of applause for Margaret.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:43.400
At the time, my girlfriend, Margaret was the official photographer of the event.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.400
And this is the Japanese translation.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400
There's all the speakers.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400
There's Margaret Whirl.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.400
They couldn't translate her name into Japanese, but there's all the speakers.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.440
So Jared Diamond is obviously a very peculiar man.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.880
We're already happy to get that letter from him.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.960
Now let's get back to the matter in hand, though.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.760
In the book What is Life, showing her opens with this great sentence, really.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.640
He said he gave the lecture in dubs, and he points that out.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.640
And he said the subject matter was a difficult one, and the lectures could not be turned popular,

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.880
even though the physicist's most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be used.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.160
And he was a fantastic communicator.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.760
The book was written with crystal clear prose, and inspired people like Jim Watson, Seymour

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.120
Benzer, Leslie Orgel, Francis Crick.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.920
All of these great giants of Mannequilobaji said they read the book, and they were inspired.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.400
And of course, the question is what inspired him in the first place.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.360
There's the book, of course, when it came out, and it says in the page, given in Trinity

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:36.360
County's Dublin, this is the 1943 edition, but what's interesting is Louis Lebrocki became

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.560
a big friend of Schrodinger, and turned up with the lectures, and sketched a picture

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.640
of Schrodinger during the lecture, which we couldn't get our hands on for this, but later

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.200
on, then did a beautiful, typical Lebrocki party.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.440
So Schrodinger was very popular in Dublin, many friends, many artists, including Lebrocki.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.640
And of course, here's a great picture, I think, from the Royal Arts Academy in 1942.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.840
Here's Devallera, here's Schrodinger, here's Paul Dirac, who won the Nobel Prize with Schrodinger

01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840
outside the Royal Academy.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.440
There's a worrying number of pre-sterial notice in the background, but that was a conference

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.320
that was held in Dublin when he can invite his friends.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.040
So this was the inspiration for what is life.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.720
A paper had come out in 1938 by a guy called Max Delbrocki, a very famous biochemist, my

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720
lack of no biologist.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.920
And in this paper, what they were doing is that they were radiating fruit flies with

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.280
radiation, fruit flies, and we heard about fruit flies yesterday from a dual half man.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.840
And they were trying to quantify the smallest amount of radiation to cause a change in the

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.440
phenotype, the trait of the fly.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440
Wow.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.040
So it's a small amount of radiation, and they got maybe the wings change.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040
Wow.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.240
And from that, they said, a gene must be a thousand atoms big.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.240
Wow.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.280
Do you hear how dumb that is?

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.760
Can you hear that?

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.760
This is the same thing that Mark has been on for a long time, the radiation, nuclear

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:54.320
energy, mutating genes, and mutation being the primary source of evolutionary change.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.480
The idea was using radiation to mutate humans, to make super humans rotary.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.760
This was a way of trying to understand how evolution worked.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:09.080
And they thought that they could irradiate genomes and increase the rate of evolution.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.480
They actually thought this.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:18.600
These are this is from the pool of bad ideas from which our current understanding of biology

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.880
grows.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:26.920
So we need to understand this pool very well, who are never going to understand why this

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.160
tree that we call biology is so misshapen.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160
It's wonderful.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.400
I can't believe it.

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.680
A mutation in a molecule, that size.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.360
Shoring a red that paper, I was inspired to give his lectures, and he says in what it's

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.360
like, the target for which the ionization radiation is about a thousand atoms big.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.000
We believe a gene to be an aperiodic crystal.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Very important.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
The gene must be stable, so it must be a crystal, it must have information, so it's

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.880
aperiodic, and that was the phrase he coined.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.320
And then he says it's the chromosome that contains some kind of code script, and that

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.960
was the first time ever the term genetic code was used on this stage in 1943.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960
So that's kind of cool.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.600
So those all come from this book.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.840
That's what's really neat about it.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.840
So let me read what he cited there, because it's actually funny that he didn't read the

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.320
whole quote.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.240
Maybe the next guy will read the whole quote.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:19.400
So he said that the book starts with a quote.

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.680
This is the preface, and this is chapter one.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.120
And large and important and very much discussed question is how can the events in space time,

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.960
which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.960
and chemistry?

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.240
The next page says the preliminary answer, which is the little, which this little book

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.120
will endeavor to expound and establish can be summarized as follows.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.320
The obvious inability of present day physics and chemistry to account for such events is

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.280
no reason at all for doubting that they can be accounted for by those sciences.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.040
In other words, just because chemistry and physics can't explain life now, there's no

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.760
reason to believe that in the future chemistry and physics can't explain it.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.320
Therefore, there is no sacred.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.760
There is no irreducible complexity.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:25.240
There are no emergent properties that come above and past chemistry and physics that

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.640
only occur in living systems in living patterns.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.720
There's nothing like that.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.200
We are a chemical soup obeying physical laws.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.360
And therefore, we are not sacred.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.240
And so that's where this book starts.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.240
That's where this guy is starting from, from the perspective of understanding DNA and the

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.800
human genome and the human pattern integrity.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.200
Of course, we now know the genetic color was the go away to describe this.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.520
Now, mind you, the only thing is two thirds of the book was not about genes at all.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.520
It was about thermodynamics.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.360
And he had this awful diagram.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360
And that's been neglected.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360
It's amazing.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.080
The length of what his life was DNA.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.880
The thermodynamics was kind of forgotten about, I guess, and people often forget that we've

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.880
still worked to do on the thermodynamics of living systems.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.520
And there is the structure of DNA that came out, of course.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.960
And then we had the famous Watson and Crick paper, and I'd say Jim will speak a bit later

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.600
to describe the structure of DNA.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:26.320
But very importantly, Francis Crick writes to Schrodinger in Tlantarff with a reprint

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320
of the paper.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320
Isn't that amazing?

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.120
And he says here, me and Watson, we know we were very influenced by what is life.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.480
He said, we thought you'd be interested in the enclosed reprints.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.440
This is the key reprint of all biology and history.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.080
And he said, we think your term aperiodic crystal will be a very apt one.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.360
And that shows you the influence of this very important lecture in Schrodinger.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.640
Aperiodic crystal does describe DNA.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.640
Now, the last thing I want to say before we hand over to our honored guest is, Flano

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.040
Bryan got involved inevitably.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.200
And he became friends with Schrodinger, and they kind of hit it off.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.920
And the third policeman, as you may know, involves the molecular exchange theory and

01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920
so on.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.760
And in 1942, before that, what is life lecture, Schrodinger gave a public lecture on the Heisenberg

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.080
uncertainty principle, right, and Flano Bryan was in the audience.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.040
There was a second professor in the D.I.A.S. at the time in Celtic studies, because Devilair

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.520
had two hobbies, Irish history and mathematics.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.600
And they appointed a chair in Celtic studies, a guy called O'Rally and Schrodinger.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.080
And O'Rally spoke, he was an expert on St. Patrick.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.640
And he said there was a historical record that there were two, St. Patrick's.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640
And this is true.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.840
Same from Rome, called Palladius, and one from Wales, called Patricius.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.080
And then Schrodinger gets up and he talks about the quantum world, the uncertainty of

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080
existence, you know.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.600
And the next thing in the Irish times, Flano Bryan writes the funniest science joke on

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600
record.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.720
The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, with its strange combination of Celtic history

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.000
and cosmic physics, has proven that there were two St. Patrick's and no God.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.120
And I was just fine, that's very funny.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.240
And that's a round of applause to Flano Bryan, even though he isn't here.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.320
What a wonderful phrase.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.720
So this just shows you the influence Schrodinger had.

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.480
And now it gives me a great pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker for tonight.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.320
And no finer person could we have for this task to reflect on Schrodinger.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.160
And of course, he's here for Esoph as well.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.760
And I'd like you to welcome Craig Venter, who's going to speak about what is life, a 21st

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.760
century perspective.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760
Craig.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:40.800
Well, thank you for that wonderful layup for this exciting event, and Teischach and

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.880
Provost, distinguished guests, family and friends.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.880
It's indeed an honor to be here for this event.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.600
And I was asked earlier whether the goal is to dissect what Schrodinger had spoken about

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.600
and written, or to present the new summary.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:08.360
And I always like to be forward looking, so I won't give you a history lesson, except

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
for very briefly.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.240
I will present our findings first on reading the genetic code and then learning to synthesize

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240
and write the genetic code.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.200
And as many of you know, we synthesized an entire genome, booted it up to create an entirely

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:26.760
new synthetic cell, where every protein in the cell was based on the synthetic DNA code.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.400
So as you all know, what Schrodinger's book was published in 1944, it was based on a series

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.200
of three lectures here starting in.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:41.160
What he really means there, right, is that they took the genome of a yeast and they made

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:50.520
a synthetic copy of it, and then that DNA could be used to grow another yeast.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.800
So it's not exactly what he's suggesting, which is like, you know, it almost seems like

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:02.400
they just went to the drawing board, made up a whole new DNA sequence, put it in a membrane

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.240
and it went, but that's not what they did.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.320
They just showed that they could copy a whole genome, make a synthetic version of it, and

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:18.640
that synthetic molecule could be reinserted, and it would faithfully allow that organism

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.640
to replicate.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.280
So, as far as I understand it, it's not the exact same thing as synthetic life, although

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:30.640
they would like you to believe, I mean, because it is synthetic life, but it says, you know,

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.480
it's still based on life.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.240
I thought that would work, sorry.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:40.360
February of 1943, and he had to be people, lectures I read on the following Monday, because

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.720
the room on the other side of campus was too small, and I understand people were turned

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.520
away tonight, but were grateful for Internet streaming, so I don't have to do this twice.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.880
So also do, clearly, to his historical role, and it's interesting to be sharing this event

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.880
with Jim Watson, who have known and had multiple interactions with over the last 25 years,

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.840
and including most recently sharing the double helix prize for human genome sequencing with

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.720
him from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory a few years ago.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.480
Now, Schrodinger started his lecture with a key question, and an interesting insight

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.480
on it.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.880
The question was, I'll read it, how can the events in space and time, which take place

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.600
within the boundaries of a living organism, be accounted for by physics and chemistry?

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.240
It's a pretty straightforward, decimal question, and then he sort of answered what he could

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:24.120
at the time, the obvious inability of present-day physics and chemistry to account for such

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.920
events is no reason at all for doubting that they will be accounted for by the sciences.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.920
That's good.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.320
So, while I only have around 40 minutes, not three lectures, I hope to convince you that

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.600
there has been substantial progress in the last nearly 70 years, since Schrodinger initially

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.680
asked that question, to the point where the answer is at least nearly at hand, if not

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.680
in hand.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:49.120
So, I view that we're now in what I'm calling the digital age of biology.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.440
My teams work on synthesizing genomes based on digital code in the computer, and four

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.760
bottles of chemicals illustrates the ultimate link between the computer code and the digital

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.320
code.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:04.000
Life as code, as you heard in the introduction, was very clearly articulated by Schrodinger

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.880
as code script.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.120
I think perhaps even more importantly, and something I missed on the first few readings

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.840
I was book early in my career, was, as far as I can tell, the first mention that this

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.520
code could be as simple as a binary code.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.920
And he used the example of Morris code with just dots and dashes.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.840
It could be sufficient to give 34 different specifications.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:32.360
I've searched and I have not find any earlier references to the Morris code, although historian

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.240
I know wrote a quick letter asking about that then, and quick response was, it was

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.560
a metaphor that was obvious to everybody.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:44.200
So, I don't know if it was obvious to everybody after Schrodinger's book or sometime before.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.440
One of the things though, Schrodinger was right about a lot of things, which is why,

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.200
in fact, I think we celebrate what he talked about and what he wrote about, but some things

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.480
he was clearly wrong about, like most scientists in his time, and he relied on the biologist

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.480
of the day.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.320
They thought that protein, not DNA, was the genetic information.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.680
And I think it's really quite extraordinary because just in 1944, in the same year that

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.280
he published his book, is when the famous experiment by Oswald Avery, who was actually

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:18.200
65 and about ready to retire, along with his colleagues Colin McLeod and acclaimed McCartney,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.920
published their key paper demonstrating that DNA was actually the substance that causes

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.480
bacterial transformation, and therefore was the genetic material.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.840
This experiment was remarkably simple, and I sort of wonder why it wasn't done 50 years

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.000
earlier, because with all the wonderful genetics work going on in drosophila, certainly people

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
were looking at chromosomes.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.560
He simply used proteolytic enzymes to destroy all the proteins associated with the DNA and

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.760
showed that the DNA, the naked DNA, was, in fact, of the transforming factor.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.080
The impact of this paper was far from instantaneous, as has happened in this field, I think, in

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.120
part because there was so much bias against DNA and towards proteins that it took a long

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.520
time for that to sink in.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:04.960
In 1949, obviously, was the first sequencing of a protein by Fred Sanger, and the protein

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.240
was insulin.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:11.280
And this work showed, in fact, that proteins consisted of linear amino acid codes.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.320
So he won the Nobel Prize in 1958 for that achievement, and was very key in terms of

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.240
leader understanding of the link between DNA and proteins.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:25.880
But as you heard in the introduction, obviously, the discovery that changed the whole field

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:32.320
and started us down to DNA root was the 1953 work by Watson and Crick, with help from Maurice

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.320
Wilkins and Roslyn Franklin, showing that DNA was, in fact, a double helix, and had a clear

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320
explanation of how it could be self-replicated.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:45.760
Again, this was not, as I understand, instantly perceived as a breakthrough because the biochemist

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.600
was still hanging on to genetic code.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:54.840
But soon, with a few more experiments from others, the world changed pretty dramatically.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.720
I think the next big thing came from the work, obviously, of Corona and Marshall Nuremberg

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.840
in 1961, where they worked out the triplet genetic codes, three letters of genetic code

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.280
coding for a single amino acid.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.440
And then this became clear how the linear DNA code, that coded for the linear protein

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440
code.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.760
Which was followed a few years later by Robert Hawley's discovery of the structure of tRNA.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.960
And tRNA is the key, the key, a link between the mesrometeor RNA and bringing the amino

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.800
acids in for protein synthesis.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.520
So Hawley and Nuremberg and Corona shared the Nobel Prize in 1968 for that work.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.040
The next decade brought us restriction enzymes.

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.840
So my friend and colleague, Ham Smith, who is at the Venture Institute now in 1970, the

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.360
first restriction enzymes, these are the molecular scissors that cut DNA very precisely and

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.400
enabled the entire field of a molecular engineering and molecular biology.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.040
And Ham Smith and Warner Arbor and Dan Nathan shared the prize in 1978 for that work.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:53.520
The 70s brought not only some interesting dress codes and characters, but the beginning

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.200
of the molecular splicing revolution, using restriction enzymes, Conan Boyer and Paul

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:04.680
Berg published the first papers on recombinant DNA, Conan Boyer at Stanford, Stanford father

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.000
patent on their work and this was used by Genentech and Eli Lilly to produce a human

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.640
insulin as the first recombinant drug.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:18.080
DNA sequencing and reading the genetic code progressed much more slowly.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:23.720
So in 1973, a maximum in Gilbert published a paper on 24 base pairs, 24 letters of genetic

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.720
code.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.920
RNA sequencing progressed a little bit faster.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.120
So the first actual genome, viral genome, RNA viral genome was sequenced in 1976 by Walter

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.560
Fiers from Belgium and this was followed the following year by Fred Sanger again sequencing

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:44.360
the first DNA virus and this was 5x174 that I'll bring back to mind with you.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.440
So this became the first DNA virus and the first viral DNA genome and it was also accompanied

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.400
by this new sequencing technique called now referred to as Sanger sequencing that Sanger

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.880
introduced.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:00.160
This is a picture of Sanger's team that sequenced 5x, the second guy from the left on the bottom

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:05.280
is Clyde Hutchinson who was also a member of the Adventure Institute and joined us after

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.120
retiring from the University of North Carolina and took a key role in some of the synthetic

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.600
genome work.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:16.200
So in 1975, I was just getting my Ph.D. as the first genes were being sequenced.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:20.420
20 years later, I led the team to sequence the first genome of a living species and

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:22.920
Cam Smith was a key part of that team.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.120
This was homophilus influenza, instead of 5,000 letters of genetic code, this was 1.8 million

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.160
letters of genetic code, or about 300 times the size of the 5x genome.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.920
Five years later, we upped the ante 1,600 times with the first draft of the human genome

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.320
using these new whole genome shotgun.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:43.360
So I don't know if you're clear about what he just said there, but I think he just said

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:49.280
HIV, Hib bacteria.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:55.120
So he sequenced Hib, which is one of the most deadly vaccines on the childhood vaccine

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.880
schedule, at least we used to be, yeah, it's not a good thing.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:07.440
And its name is an H word in the beginning and then influenza in the second word and

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.040
then B stands for something else.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.200
Instead of 5,000 letters of genetic code, this was 1.8 million letters of genetic code,

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.800
or about 300,000 letters of genetic code, Cam Smith was a key part of that team.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.000
This was homophilus influenza, instead of 5,000 letters of genetic code, this was 1.8 million

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.240
letters of genetic code.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.200
I'm pretty sure that's HIV.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.960
The size of the 5x genome.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.880
Five years later, we upped the ante 1,600 times with the first draft of the human genome

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:37.920
using these new whole genome shotgun techniques, and the smaller papers, the public genome

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.680
effort size doesn't reflect its significance, only its relative significance to me.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.560
So the human genome is about a half a million times larger than the 5x genome, so it shows

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.000
how fast things were developing.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.600
Reading genomes has now progressed extremely rapidly, so instead of years or decades, it

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.520
now takes about two hours to sequence a human genome.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:01.080
Instead of genomes per day or genomes per hour or hours per genome, we can now, in a

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.400
recently done a demonstration, sequencing 2,000 complete microbial genomes in one run,

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.440
in one hour.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.080
So the pace is changing quite substantially.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:14.040
Now, I view DNA as an analog coding molecule.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:18.240
And when we sequence the DNA, we're converting that analog code into digital code.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.280
Remember that if he's right, and 11 years ago we could sequence a human genome in two

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:31.360
hours, then the testing operation in the United States could have easily been a test deployment

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.200
of a mass genotyping operation.

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.080
And so depending on where these remnants went and who they were sold to, if you can sequence

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.320
a genome in two hours in 11 years ago, then I guess chances are pretty good that in about

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.000
the same time they can do those PCR reactions, they can also be amplifying a whole genome,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.440
or using other means where you don't have to amplify the genome before you sequence it,

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.120
like, for example, nanopore.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:04.920
So there's a lot of sketchy stuff going on here, and my chickens are crawling, so I'm

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.400
just going to check outside to make sure everything's okay.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.800
It could just be an egg has been laid, I'll be right back, I'm going to push play.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.400
The ones and zeros in the computer are very similar to the dots and dashes that Schrodinger

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.320
indicated might be the original code, and I call this process digitizing biology.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.480
A number of scientists have drawn the analogy between computers and biology.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.360
I take these even further, I describe DNA as the software of life, and when we activate

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.240
a synthetic genome in a cell, we call, we describe it as booting up a genome in a cell

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.400
the same way we talk about booting up a software.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.800
June 23rd of this year was Alan Turing's, would have been his 100th birthday, and Turing

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.000
described what has become to be known as Turing machines, and the machine described a set

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.600
of instructions written on a tape.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.440
He also described the universal Turing machine, which was a machine that could take that set

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.200
of instructions and rewrite them, and this was the original origin of the digital computer.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.640
Now, his ideas were carried further in the 1940s by John Vandumen, as many people know,

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.360
and he conceived of the self-replicating machine.

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.920
So von Neumann's machine consisted of a series of cells, which encoded a sequence of actions

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.680
that be performed by the machine, and using a writing head, the machine can print out

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:21.400
a new pattern of cells, allowing it to make a complete copy of itself on the tape.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.120
So many of people have certainly made the analogy, most recently in nature, Sydney Brenner, who

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.480
played a role in almost all these stages of early biology, wrote an article about Turing

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:34.440
and biology, and in this, he argued that the best examples of a Turing and von Neumann

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.320
machine is found in biology, with the self-replicating code, the internal description

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:46.000
of itself, and that this is the key kernel of biological theory.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.080
So while software was pouring out of sequence of machines around the world, substantial

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.000
progress was going on describing the hardware of life, or proteins.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.920
So in biochemistry, the first two decades of the 20th century were dominated by what was

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.280
called the colloid theory.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.000
So life itself is explained in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.160
substances in an organism.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.680
We now know that these substances are a collection of three-dimensional protein machines, each

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.400
evolved to carry out a very specific task.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.200
Now, these proteins have been described as nature of robots, and if you think about it

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.960
for every single task in a cell, every imaginable task is described by a panford and Reynolds.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.960
There is a unique protein to carry out that task.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:32.480
It's programmed when to go on, when to go off, and it does this based on its structure.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:34.400
It doesn't have consciousness.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.720
It doesn't have a control from a mind or a higher center.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.240
Everything a protein does is built into its linear code derived from the DNA code.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.080
Just briefly, there's multiple protein types.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.680
Okay, I'm going to take a big left turn here.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.480
We're going to come back to this video.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.880
I've got something hit me, and I don't want to miss it, and I'm going to end the video

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.280
early because this makes perfect sense to me now.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.640
He's talking about DNA, he's talking about proteins, he's talking about how all these

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:09.520
spontaneous, physical and chemical processes come together and form something that we call

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:18.720
life, and I want to show you a video completely unrelated to this that's so close to my heart

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.800
that will give you just an insight into the kind of, I don't know what the right word

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800
is.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.160
Is it passion that I have, the belief that I have, reverence that I have for everything

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.440
that's alive?

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.560
Because here's where we are with this guy's lecture.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.080
He said, protein used to be the genetic material, then DNA with the genetic code, then the

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:45.440
triplet code was cracked, then the tRNA structure was found, then restriction enzymes were found,

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:49.600
then we'd made recombinant DNA, and then we started sequencing stuff first with a 24

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.880
base pair sequence, then a viral genome, then a DNA viral genome, then this first bacteria

01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.160
was sequenced by yours truly, then a whole genome using shotgun techniques to the point

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.680
where we can now, at this time in this lecture, read a genome in two hours, it's much lower

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.680
than that now.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.040
Presumably, I guess Kevin McCurnan would tell us exactly how many minutes would take with

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.720
the cutting edge technology.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:23.240
Now we're talking about molecules whose emergent properties we don't understand, whose relationship

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:29.240
to other molecules produces other emergent properties that we don't understand, who then

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:35.480
fold and are post-translationally modified in ways that we don't understand, and we

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:45.280
purport to understand how this multi-layered, complex pattern integrity produces life, because

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:55.080
we can translate some of the bases into some of the components of the next layer.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:59.280
Now I'm going to show you a video that may not have anything to do with this, but I think

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.480
if you listen to how I describe the video, you will understand exactly why these people

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.480
have no idea what they're talking about and how much we stand to gain by pointing that

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:17.480
out, how the foundation of biology is just based on a few gross misconceptions about

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.200
fidelity and depth of understanding.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.720
So let me see if I can find this video without too much looking, I'll just use my history,

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:33.360
I think that'll work the best.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:50.040
Oh, I'm revealing everything I looked at in the last couple hours here, that's going

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.760
to dump.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:31:01.000
Let me see, let's go back out of this, yeah, I can't see it, I don't know why it's not

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.640
on, this should be on this list right here already, and it's not.

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.040
So let me think, how else do I do it?

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:18.800
Nope, then I got to go back and go to YouTube and search for, oh, maybe I should use the

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:24.280
YouTube history, that's what I thought I was using, not that, there we go, dumb, dumb,

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:32.040
hee dee dee dee, YouTube, where is my history stuff, what's going on, why am I zoning out

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:47.160
like this, let's just go icky, icky TV, please look it up, see if you can find icky TV.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:53.920
So what is, what are we looking at here, well we're looking at a stunt kite and the

01:31:53.920 --> 01:32:01.800
stunt kite is actually exactly what is sitting behind me on my desk over here.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:07.080
You will see behind the screen here a stunt kite.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.360
And that is a diablist, it's a German made kite, it was one of the first of that design

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.480
to be made and that design was later sold to a French company by the name of Arsky and

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:21.640
they didn't use the same panel out, look, that kite won several competitions in Germany

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.320
and in the Netherlands before I got my hands on it and there's lots of people who would

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.400
love to have that kite also for the plans of the panels.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:37.280
This video that we're about to watch is actually kite in the Netherlands being flown on a Dutch

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:43.000
beach, very recently filmed by a friend of mine named Carlo, flown by a friend of mine

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.160
named Lars and Lars is one of the best kite pilots on the planet and now what you have

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.480
to understand, this is going to be fun.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:55.480
I'm excited, it makes me happy to teach this, hold on I'll be right back.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:03.000
What you have to understand is that there are a few variables involved in how the kite

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.680
behaves and kite flyers who are talented are taking advantage of those variables.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:13.640
Now if you look at a stunt kite and I've got one right here and I'm going to put it underneath

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:21.400
the thing here and so if you look at a stunt kite it's actually got a three-point bridle

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:27.400
that has points that grab the kite on three sides here, see the triangle there and then

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:31.640
there's another one over here that actually grabs on the other side and so then the kite

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:36.960
flyer is actually holding two strings and the strings are pulling each on a triangle

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:42.280
of string like this and now the interesting thing is is that the wind is blowing in this

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.760
direction right toward the kite and the kite is designed to make it fly up and so in this

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.400
case if I change this around like this the kite's going to fly up right and so it flies

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.600
in the direction of the nose because the wind is blowing this way and then the kite is designed

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.240
to have a nose and then the wind only moves in one direction so it moves through the air.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.520
The cool thing is that these kites also have attractor states where they are very stable

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:14.920
facing if the wind is coming from you this is the way you would be flying the kite but the kite is

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:20.840
also stable in this position the kite is also stable in this position and the kite can also

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:26.680
rotate in these positions but if you get it the lines tangled around the end of the kite or whatever

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:33.120
then it's not going to fly anymore and so the trick of flying a kite is to jerk the kite in and out of

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:39.200
the wind and get it to settle into different attractor states and then spin around in the wind

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.320
while the wind is still moving and give it slack in the right way so that when you pull it back

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.680
into the flight position the lines are still free of the kite itself. Now what I want you to do is

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:57.520
watch this video and think very carefully about how your brain interprets what's going on here

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:05.040
because there are very few variables there is the static shape of this kite one shape in three

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:11.840
dimensions there is the static direction of the wind it's one direction and he's on the beach which

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:18.000
means it's laboratory grade wind it's going to be the same speed from the ground all the way up to

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.200
the top of the flight window and so all of the flight is going to be very smooth and the variables

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:29.360
will be limited because the wind is not from everywhere like it's in Pittsburgh Dutch kite flying

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:36.160
is the best kite flying in the universe and you can lose literally weekends with your feet in the

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:43.920
sand and get like emergency room level sunburn because it's so zen so watch this kite fly try to

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:49.920
figure out how it is that somebody with only two lines and two handles can make the kite do what

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:57.200
Lars makes it do and then think about the idea that we're talking about one three-dimensional

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:06.160
shape with two lines and a protein is a three-dimensional shape with electrostatic charge

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:16.240
in a electrostatic polar solvent water and it is attached to other three-dimensional magnetic

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:22.160
electrostatic three-dimensional shapes that are in a polar solvent called water

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.960
and we are being told that we understand how proteins fold and we understand how DNA gets

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:42.000
translated into proteins and to describe the physics of what Lars is doing would be pretty

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:47.600
complicated so how in the world can we already be so i got to slow it down sorry

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.440
that's why this music sounds a little bad

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:57.360
let's start it over again so you can see exactly what i'm talking about

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.160
so think very carefully now how would you describe what's happening here how do we understand this

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:23.120
I want you to think about a protein as a kite connected to another kite connected to another

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:28.240
kite and each one of the 20 amino acids has a different shape that interacts with the wind in

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:34.480
a different way and depending on how they are connected depending on the bridal connection

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.080
between them depending on the the sugars that are deposited on them depending on the speed that

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.480
they come through the ribosome depending on the particular kind of ribosome

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.840
the chain of kites will come out in a very different way and fly in a very different way

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.560
and have a very different effect on other proteins and we claim to be able to reasonably understand

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.280
that or we're very soon going to be able to understand it can you understand what Lars is

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:14.160
doing right now does it make sense to you because i assure you whatever's going on in the

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:20.880
simplest protein is much more complex than this the physics and the chemistry are much more complex

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:28.000
than the physics of this even a whole chain of these and we can understand this i have no doubt

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.960
we can understand this but trying to understand the irreducible complexity of protein folding

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:43.440
of protein modification and of the the the pattern integrity that is a cell never mind tissue never

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:52.080
mind an organism a developing baby a developing teenager my goodness ladies and gentlemen let's

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.880
let's stay focused on the physics and chemistry we can understand let's stay focused on the

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:04.400
phenomenon that we can harness instead of trying to convince all of our children that

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:11.680
they're nothing more than chemistry and physics because that's ridiculous i really believe that i

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.800
really think that's at the heart of this we have to convince our our young people that they're much

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.240
more valuable than that that they're much more precious than that that you know we need to go

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:28.000
back to the stage where people aren't getting tattoos where people are very interested in

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.120
whether or not should i pierce my ear or not that's where we need to go back to and i think that

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:42.640
that if you start to see i'll give you another example um i don't know if i can yeah i can i can

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:47.520
get that out of my list let me give let's see if that's a good one is that listed here

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:55.200
yeah okay let's do this one shall we do this one just to keep doing this to a raw egg until

01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:01.520
it spins and then catch it to stop it and and instantly this is one of my favorite um math

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:08.880
teachers that i like to share with people and i'll just let's let's again just let's listen to

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.040
this and then i'll i'll end the show

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.560
once in a while you run into somebody who happens to be carrying around an inclined plane

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:54.800
and he produces from the recess of his toy box two jars one of them is filled with top quality

01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:01.120
basmati rights from india and the other one is filled with top quality air from Birmingham

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:12.240
and they can be made to roll down this slope you can see that they roll down quite fast not

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.120
quite exactly the same way because the moment of inertia is doing something but they roll down

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:30.240
quite fast now what i propose to do is to investigate how the speed of descent

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:37.760
how fast it goes down depends on the amount of grains inside here we have a big question mark

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:43.840
only two data points available we know that when the jar is practically empty that's represented by

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.760
zero it's quite fast and on the other hand when the jar is practically full that's represented by

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:56.720
one it's also going down quite fast so how does that work well let us experiment immediately

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:03.440
and in order to make the contrast striking i shall leave one of the jars about two thirds full

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.640
or one third empty depending on the degree of optimism and the other one one third full

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:16.240
or two thirds empty so i shall do that is that is that a good amount maybe a little more

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:30.800
good let's begin with the two thirds full one now as far as i can imagine there are three

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:37.440
possibilities on there perhaps it will go down at the same speed as before between those two

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.560
points because if you remember the story and believe the story of galley dropping those two

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:48.960
heavy balls from the tower pizza the speed of descent didn't depend on the weight and perhaps

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:55.600
it's the same with grains in that case it will be the same speed no matter what and amount of sand

01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.880
amount of grains i amount to rice inside so perhaps it will go down at the same speed on that hand

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.400
maybe it will go down faster or perhaps it will go down slower so let's take a vote who thinks he

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:13.520
to go down at the same speed as before who thinks he to go down faster than before faster faster

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.000
who thinks he could it will go down slowly than before

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:30.480
who's to shy to vote well let's do this okay so this is two thirds are you ready

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:38.880
it starts going down and it goes down very very slowly very slowly

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.280
not only does it go down slowly but there is a very interesting phenomenon going on

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.240
along what we make called the free surface the surface that's exposed between the grains and

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.920
the air there is a sort of avalanche land slide going on the sand and the rice grains are going

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:04.720
down just sliding down all the time and the rest of the rice on the other hand the rest of the

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:11.920
rice grains are sticking to the receptacle to the jar in some sense therefore if you have studied

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:16.640
something like fluid dynamics you can say that it's acting like viscous fluid sticky fluid

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.880
by the way you can do the same experiment with honey and if you do it with honey something

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:28.480
interesting happens we shall come back that in a moment okay so that was the first experiment

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:36.080
now let's go through the next one one third okay so he's might not get to the honey because I do

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.320
have to go to basketball in a few minutes the honey experiment if you put the honey on there the jar

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.720
won't move at all and if you come back in about a half an hour the jar will have moved and then

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.760
you come back another half an hour to have moved again and so honey is just a very extreme example

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.800
of the fluid dynamics that are shown here what I'm trying to get at

01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:00.000
is that proteins and their production if it occurs in the way that we're told which is an RNA goes

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.760
through it goes through a ribosome and then a protein comes out some other hole that is all

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:13.600
occurring inside of water at the molecular scale and water behaves more like polarized magnets

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:20.720
the size of rice grains than it would any other you can't come up with any other analogy for it

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.680
it's water and it's water at the molecular scale which is one of the reasons why a lot of the talk

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.320
about what water does at the molecular scale is so important and why what water does at the molecular

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:38.480
scale around proteins and DNA and in cells is important because it is a repetitive shaped

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.800
polar molecule that can assume a crystal lattice can dissolve many things in it and so the structure

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:52.240
that those molecules take can be ordered or unordered and the ordered water has different

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:59.120
properties ordered water could be ordered around proteins and around biomolecules so trying to

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:05.040
understand what these biomolecules do in the context of the polar solvent of water is a very

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:12.720
complex system to model that we are not even coming close to modeling and I'm trying to give

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:19.520
you if I'm not failing an example of a system where there are many little parts that collectively

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.920
produce results that aren't intuitive to how we apply our understanding to the physical world and

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:31.520
nothing about how we understand the physical world of life applies at the molecular scale with

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:38.000
regard to protein folding protein interaction protein regulation degradation etc and so

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.080
they are grossly over exaggerating how much we understand about the link between DNA and protein

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:50.720
and how proteins work to produce the pattern integrity that is us are there proteins yes are

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.080
their DNA probably is their mRNA probably are there ribosomes that do that of course

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:05.360
but that's again like saying that there are strings on the violin there are this wood has been used

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:11.360
to produce it if there's a crack in the neck a violin could break but understanding how a stratovarius

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:17.280
is produced and made because you understand that that's the kind of wood or that that cracks a bad

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.960
sign or that the strings make the noise doesn't really tell you that you understand what a stratovarius

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.320
violin is and that's all the farther we've gotten with understanding life we are at the stage where

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.760
we can describe why a crack in the neck of the violin is a bad thing and we can understand that

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:39.520
the sound comes from the the strings vibrating and resonating with the body that's it that's all we

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.600
got we haven't even gotten to the stage yet where we can appreciate the idea that whatever varnish

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:51.840
was used on the violin could have a significant effect on its total qualities never mind thinking

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.000
about how the varnish would be made or who would have made it or why they chose the ingredients

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.520
that they did and yet they're already telling you that they know how to make the stratovarius

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.280
violin and they're going to make each one of us into one okay listen to this guy because i really

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:14.320
think he's fun now they have four possibilities and perhaps it'll go down faster than when he was

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.400
full or empty or perhaps it will go down faster than this but slower than when he was full or

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:25.920
empty so halfway between or perhaps it will be very sluggish and go down even more slowly than

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.400
this or those of you who have symmetric minds like mathematicians might say there must be some

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:38.240
symmetry between f and one minus f if you see what i mean so perhaps it will go down at the same speed

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:45.120
as this one so a little bit slow down so who thinks it would be the champion and go down very fast

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:53.280
faster than zero one those are the risk takers who thinks it will go down faster than this one

01:48:53.280 --> 01:49:00.960
but slower than zero one by the way reasonable people vote for this option yeah okay and who thinks

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:08.400
it will go down even more slowly than what we have seen right now and who thinks it will go down

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.160
more or less at the same speed as the previous experiment so symmetry school those are the

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:19.760
mathematical reminded people congratulations okay so let's try to do this yeah nothing up this

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.040
are you ready

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.120
not not only does it stop completely dead but it's quite stable i mean i can push it and then

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:45.520
no no no i don't want to go yeah it stops completely dead which

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:55.440
i want you to imagine the idea how this shape imagine the idea that in protein dynamics in

01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:02.480
genetic dynamics in the dynamics between dna and cell division in the dynamics between dna and rna

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:11.120
translation in the dynamics between rna translation and piece and protein folding there are non-intuitive

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.440
processes like this one that have relatively simple mathematical explanations but are nevertheless

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:25.120
extremely in a non-intuitive and layered on top of one another so that even if you understood

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:31.200
one of those layers there would be several other unknown layers on top of which all summarize and

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:40.240
summate to to become the pattern integrity of a protein of a cell of a tissue of an organism

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.680
now i'm not saying that we can't make a lot of progress in understanding these systems i'm

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:50.880
not saying that these are uncrackable questions i'm saying that right now we haven't cracked

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:55.760
them i'm saying that we've been talking about how we're gonna for a very long time and they've known

01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:01.760
for a long time that we aren't gonna not without a drastic reorganization of how we think about

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:06.880
ourselves how we think about our kids and how we think about the sovereignty over those very

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:17.120
sacred bodies those very sacred beings they have to get rid of the sacred in order for them to have

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.760
any hope of cracking the irreducible complexity of life that's what this is all about i don't know

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.440
if this was a very wandering stream or not we'll go back to that vendor maybe i'll watch the video

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:34.160
beforehand i'm sorry that this was such a weird um break in the in the matrix there it wasn't really

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.120
my plan but i wanted to do i suddenly wanted to do the kite video for some reason i hope this and

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.480
then this one seemed like it would follow perfectly i don't know sometimes this one man show um

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.320
doesn't go quite as i plan but i've been putting a lot of work into the coming um pre-owned discussion

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.200
and so sometimes these streams will be will feel a little bit like they're on the seat of the

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.360
pants but when i get an intuition like that i feel like i got to do it so hopefully it wasn't

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.560
too bad thank you very much for joining me i'm off to basketball i might see it tonight but

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.800
i'll definitely see it tomorrow and then thursday don't forget thomas binder is joining big show big

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:15.680
show um and it's 3 30 if you have the link uh don't forget that i think thomas binder is actually

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.160
speaking at the medical doctors for covid ethics right now so you could catch that um

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.800
anyway thanks for joining me i'll see you guys again tomorrow

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.040
this is the micro kite there's actually a whole video about the micro kite you can find video of

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:43.920
me flying it and if you want to look icky tv does have a video of me flying in norway quite a long

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:50.480
time ago um i'm not a very good pilot anymore but at one time um i was i was really skilled

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.360
i wonder what i could do now probably most of the tricks but some of the more complicated ones

01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:00.880
that require really perfect timing um it would require me a while to get back into it um but

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.280
actually kite flying like lars did a lot of that flying is actually pretty straightforward once you

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.720
get the hang of it i mean it doesn't take absolutely months and months of practice to learn some

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:18.240
of those basic tricks and keeping a kite in the air with good wind is very easy and unbelievably

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:24.640
relaxing you can fly circles and squares for hours and never get bored um never mind if you can land

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:30.800
or stand on one one tip and that kind of stuff so um one of the best ways to spend your time if

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:34.960
you've never done it before and have a friend uh kite flying might be the best maybe we can meet

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:42.000
