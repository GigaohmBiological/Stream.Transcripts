00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
So sorry, I am very late.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.960
And left hand monkey wrench is first.

00:22.960 --> 00:29.760
I'm going to assume that my sound is okay, but just in case I think it should be fine.

00:29.760 --> 00:33.880
I think I figured out what that glitch was a while ago already and have fixed it.

00:33.880 --> 00:39.200
But if you can give me confirmation, synced is good, excellent, excellent, excellent.

00:59.760 --> 01:22.720
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case

01:22.720 --> 01:30.880
scenario.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.480
The scary part of the ship thing seems to be the rumors about it maybe being done via

01:36.480 --> 01:41.840
the internet, by a cyber connectivity or some kind of cyber attack.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.840
I think that's probably a rumor at this stage yet, but just realize that given the shipping

01:47.840 --> 01:55.320
industry that we have, there's lots of different ways to attack the infrastructure of a nation.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.920
Is this a shot across our bow?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.560
Is it a threat or is it just an accident?

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
I don't know.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.160
I'm a biologist.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.360
I think truth is good for kids.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.360
We're so busy lying.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.600
We don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.840
We want everybody to feel good.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.120
That's not the way life is.

02:15.120 --> 02:20.840
But you can tell if someone's lying, you can sort of feel it in people.

02:20.840 --> 02:21.840
And I have lied.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.840
I'm sure I'll lie again.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
I don't want to lie.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.440
I don't think I'm a liar.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
I try not to be a liar.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.880
I don't want to be a liar.

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
I think it's like...

02:28.880 --> 02:31.880
Can someone check and see if you can find me on YouTube anywhere?

02:31.880 --> 02:35.240
It would be really handy if somebody could see whether the live stream on YouTube is

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
going.

02:36.240 --> 02:43.240
I hate to pull away and to take any bandwidth and try to see if I can see it myself.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.960
If it's hard to find that it's also not really working, right?

02:47.960 --> 02:54.880
If you can find my JC on a bike channel that can't find the live, then that's also a problem.

02:54.880 --> 03:03.600
In case you haven't forgotten, I've got a friend named Nate and he took both shots.

03:03.600 --> 03:12.640
I got to see him in October and then one month later he had a sudden aneurysm and passed

03:12.640 --> 03:15.640
away.

03:15.640 --> 03:23.560
In my crazy imagination, I have the feeling that this has to do with transfection.

03:23.560 --> 03:30.720
I want to dedicate every Tuesday stream to the memory of my friend because he was a

03:30.720 --> 03:42.600
great guy and because lots of great dads and moms, daughters and sons are being lost.

03:42.600 --> 03:51.760
It's a lie about biology and that's why I'm so dedicated to it.

03:51.760 --> 03:56.960
This song is a song that meant a lot to me and Nathan because we used to really be a

03:56.960 --> 04:02.960
fan of this band back when it was cool to be a fan of this band.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.560
Happy Tuesday.

04:12.600 --> 04:25.240
Okay, well we'll worry about YouTube, we'll worry about YouTube on the next stream because

04:25.240 --> 04:29.960
we really don't care about that anyway.

04:29.960 --> 04:42.160
We've got peer tube working perfectly.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.680
Peer tube will never block this song.

04:44.680 --> 04:49.440
So Twitch can block it all they want because we've got it on peer tube.

04:49.440 --> 05:02.720
Thanks for checking on YouTube guys, I'll figure that out.

05:02.720 --> 05:09.720
This is the Freddy Jones band, Freddy Jones band.

05:32.720 --> 06:01.720
Oh, I'm hanging around, just me in the sky, I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream.

06:01.720 --> 06:23.720
I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream.

06:23.720 --> 06:52.720
I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream.

06:52.720 --> 07:18.720
I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream.

07:18.720 --> 07:47.720
I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream.

07:47.720 --> 08:12.720
I'm already in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream, in a daydream.

08:12.720 --> 08:41.720
I'm already in a daydream.

08:41.720 --> 09:06.880
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Giga Home Biological, a high-resistance low-noise

09:06.880 --> 09:11.000
information brief brought to you by a biologist, again, to remind you this stream and every

09:11.000 --> 09:18.240
stream on every Tuesday from now on is dedicated to a friend Nate who we lost in an untimely

09:18.240 --> 09:23.520
way because of the transfections and I think we need to start to be very frank about how

09:23.520 --> 09:27.800
many people we've lost for something other than a virus.

09:27.800 --> 09:33.040
That's what I think is most important right now as we move forward to start to get people

09:33.040 --> 09:39.520
to focus on the people who were actually lost and not the people who were censored or lost

09:39.520 --> 09:41.520
their YouTube channels.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.120
Again, welcome to the show.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.480
I'm a human just like you coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back

09:46.480 --> 09:49.360
of my kind of weird smelly garage.

09:49.360 --> 09:55.640
I think my wife left the chicken feeder that's outside in the office and it was a little wet

09:55.640 --> 09:56.640
last night's.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.640
I don't know.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.640
It smells weird in here.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
Anyway, you can't smell that.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.640
So that's really good.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.400
We're not at smell-a-vision yet.

10:02.400 --> 10:06.960
Again, this is Giga Home Biological, it's the 26th of March, 2024.

10:06.960 --> 10:12.320
That is the fifth year since we've had, this is, we're going on our fifth year since

10:12.320 --> 10:19.320
we had 15 days to flatten the curve, 60 days to smash the curve if you were a Paul Catrell

10:19.320 --> 10:21.000
fan.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.400
This is a time and a place for you if you've never found me before, if you're here for the

10:27.400 --> 10:32.440
umpteenth time, then you already know that what we are fighting against is something that

10:32.440 --> 10:34.640
has gone on for a very long time.

10:34.640 --> 10:39.880
It's only a question of whether or not it's been turned up to 11 for the last three years

10:39.880 --> 10:43.680
or whether it's turned up to 11 for the last 10 years.

10:43.680 --> 10:49.560
The real deal is, is that the internet and social media and our cell phones and all of

10:49.560 --> 10:58.800
our devices and all of these different applications have allowed them to enmesh us in a a web

10:58.800 --> 11:05.120
of what they call knowledge, what is it, actually noise, that is carefully curated,

11:05.120 --> 11:10.480
so that if you try to escape or you try to understand the shape of it, you will inevitably

11:10.480 --> 11:17.240
run into these fake barriers which are essentially defined by people on the internet who agree

11:17.240 --> 11:22.120
to disagree about things and agree not to talk about other things.

11:22.120 --> 11:29.560
And as sort of ridiculously simple as it sounds, it is exactly the same as your most

11:29.560 --> 11:35.320
famous favorite magician, if you actually found out how any or all of those tricks were

11:35.320 --> 11:41.280
done, it would be horribly disappointed because you would find out it's just a couple of people

11:41.280 --> 11:42.760
lined.

11:42.760 --> 11:49.080
And no matter how clever it is, the way that they lie to you, it is nevertheless a lie.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.720
And if we start to think about this as a show that we ever attended, we were given

11:53.720 --> 11:58.400
tickets to the pandemic, we sat down in our seats and we had no idea that half of the

11:58.400 --> 12:02.160
people that were in the audience were in on the gag.

12:02.160 --> 12:06.760
And so when the people on stage told us that you better wear your masks, and half of the

12:06.760 --> 12:13.280
people in the audience did it with vigor was a lot more difficult for us to resist.

12:13.280 --> 12:19.400
And being in an experiment or in a performance where people are working against you because

12:19.400 --> 12:26.040
it's part of the experiment is a very devious position to be in indeed, in fact, on bench

12:26.040 --> 12:29.640
academic science, that means that somebody's walking in and on or our front door, which

12:29.640 --> 12:34.760
I guess at one, I think that's okay.

12:34.760 --> 12:41.920
The idea is that if you think of a national security operation that was run on us and

12:41.920 --> 12:54.280
the world, and that that national security operation can be best described as analogous

12:54.280 --> 13:00.880
to a magician's performance in Las Vegas, where the stage was social media, the stage

13:00.880 --> 13:06.720
was television, the stage was the pulpit in the White House, the stage was the FDA and

13:06.720 --> 13:14.880
the CDC pulpits, the stage was the internet and the intellectual dark web.

13:14.880 --> 13:20.520
And all of these pretend voices that have purported to be fighting for our freedom,

13:20.520 --> 13:27.000
but in reality, we're coordinatedly working this theater.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.400
And if you see it as a stage thing with audience members engaged in fooling the other audience

13:34.440 --> 13:41.680
members to enhance the likelihood that they would suspend their disbelief.

13:41.680 --> 13:46.040
Then you see why if if you sat down a bunch of bureaucrats, if you sat down a bunch of

13:46.040 --> 13:51.080
military leaders, if you sat down a bunch of politicians and people with clearances

13:51.080 --> 13:55.440
and told them that this is the way.

13:55.440 --> 14:00.000
And then you pulled the you rang the bell and everybody went to work.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.200
This is where we are.

14:03.200 --> 14:08.440
And since everybody understands it for what it is, then none of them see the cognitive

14:08.440 --> 14:14.800
dissonance in telling us that it is the way it is when it isn't.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.480
Because that was the design of the plan in the first place, the people that were planted

14:18.480 --> 14:22.840
in the audience already knew they were planted in the audience.

14:22.840 --> 14:28.200
They already understood their role in the show.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.480
And now there may be other people in the audience who have decided to participate in a way that

14:32.520 --> 14:37.160
that's not scripted and that those people that were planted in the audience have been

14:37.160 --> 14:40.520
very skilled at allowing them to participate.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.360
But that's probably part of the show too.

14:43.360 --> 14:49.760
And no doubt that they've gained that out before this was finally executed.

14:49.760 --> 14:54.280
This is a quote from the 19, sorry, I don't know how to do the weatherman thing.

14:54.280 --> 15:01.720
This is a quote from the 1920s, I think it's 1924.

15:01.720 --> 15:06.120
This is back when they could do it with radio and television.

15:06.120 --> 15:11.840
Please tell me you have no problem imagining that when we give them our brains on Twitter,

15:11.840 --> 15:14.880
we give them our brains and attention on Facebook.

15:14.880 --> 15:19.720
We give them our brains and attention on these devices and these applications that they can

15:19.720 --> 15:27.240
surely consciously and intelligently manipulate our habits and opinions.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.320
Of course you believe that.

15:29.320 --> 15:33.680
But for some reason we're supposed to be afraid of the AI that's to come, the AI in

15:33.680 --> 15:38.280
the future instead of the machines that are being used by other men to control us right

15:38.280 --> 15:43.880
now to steal from dude.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.840
And that's the magic of where we are that if you just boil it down to that, you can see

15:47.840 --> 15:54.840
the people who are our medlers because they are purporting even the ones that do say that

15:54.840 --> 16:00.320
they're they're thinking across modalities and talking about the whole big picture like

16:00.320 --> 16:02.240
Robert Malone often does.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.880
He doesn't get to the heart of this at all.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.880
In fact, he pushes the AI scary thing.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.680
He pushes the gain of function virus thing.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.800
He pushes the collapse of the dollar, but something, something, something, but never actually

16:15.800 --> 16:20.040
gets to the heart of it, which is fractional reserve banking.

16:20.040 --> 16:25.200
The idea that if you can create money and you decide who uses that power and how it

16:25.200 --> 16:29.720
gets used and who has to follow the rules very strictly, then you can set up a system

16:29.720 --> 16:37.080
where corporations can go bankrupt, but college students can't.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.280
And that's the system that we live in right now, not saying it's good or bad.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.520
This is just the way it is.

16:41.520 --> 16:49.240
A corporation declares bankruptcy of of billions of dollars is what happens.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.880
But there is no way that a college student who went to a very bad university and got

16:54.880 --> 16:59.360
a very dumb degree because that university was very happy to give it to them and had

16:59.360 --> 17:03.680
a financial aid office that was very happy to get them to sign the right papers so that

17:03.680 --> 17:10.600
all $15,000 of every year's tuition would be covered.

17:10.600 --> 17:16.760
You can blame it all on the student if you want to rather than the the lawmakers that

17:16.760 --> 17:21.080
made the bills or the people at those lending agencies or the universities that said, Oh,

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
my gosh, great.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
Thanks.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
We'll raise our tuition.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.080
We'll pay everybody more.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.080
We'll hire more things.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.520
We'll build more buildings.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.880
But the student loan thing is an issue that comes right back to the universities.

17:32.880 --> 17:38.320
The same universities that we're we're totally happy to accept are corrupt, are teaching

17:38.320 --> 17:43.200
our kids terribly are responsible for all kinds of bad things and bad ideas, wasting

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
money.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.960
But when it comes to student loans, it's all the students.

17:48.960 --> 17:54.280
And so think about the kind of conscious and intelligent manipulation of our habits has

17:54.280 --> 17:59.880
as occurred in order for people to be very convinced that helping people with student

17:59.880 --> 18:01.800
loans is absolutely absurd.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.800
And I didn't go to college.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.880
I don't have loans.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.240
So why should I help them?

18:06.240 --> 18:13.480
And those same people have never considered the oddity of corporate bankruptcy or personal

18:13.480 --> 18:18.760
bankruptcy for that matter, which is totally okay.

18:18.760 --> 18:24.480
And so it's it's bizarre because that is obviously, if you think objectively about it, that's

18:24.480 --> 18:28.480
only because people want you to scream about that, otherwise it wouldn't rise all over

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
the internet.

18:29.480 --> 18:37.320
And once you see it that way, then all of these things need a real inspection.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.680
Because in reality, we are being governed by asking the wrong questions and being convinced

18:41.680 --> 18:49.240
that these questions are much smarter than they are, in fact, they're dumb questions.

18:49.240 --> 18:54.800
And once you see it that way, then you see why informed consent comes back to the fore

18:54.800 --> 18:59.100
all the time, because informed consent is what one would have if you were in a free

18:59.100 --> 19:03.320
country, if you were in a free republic, you would have informed consent.

19:03.320 --> 19:09.280
If you were a real citizen with real voting rights, you would have informed consent.

19:09.280 --> 19:15.160
And these people in our government would be acting with our informed consent more or

19:15.160 --> 19:16.160
less.

19:16.160 --> 19:21.360
I don't know if that's the right legal language or not, but it sure sounds pretty good to me.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.480
And so one of the ways to understand how our informed consent was taken away from us was

19:26.480 --> 19:33.560
to understand that there was a magic show, which was performed with people in the audience

19:33.560 --> 19:38.240
in on the show that has convinced us that there was a pandemic.

19:38.240 --> 19:44.320
A combination of people in the audience that were making new diagnostic tools and other

19:44.320 --> 19:49.600
people that were starting new PCR companies or track and trace companies.

19:49.600 --> 19:54.720
And all these people that seem to be just, wow, this is, this is crazy, this look at

19:54.720 --> 20:00.040
all this, the Ant Hill is moving.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.800
And when you look around and you think that it's all real life instead of a show, it's

20:05.640 --> 20:06.720
it was overwhelming.

20:06.720 --> 20:13.720
And that's what all of us did, all of us very naive, including myself, people that thought

20:13.720 --> 20:17.760
the vast majority of what we thought was the real world was the real world, that most

20:17.760 --> 20:22.160
of what we saw in television was the truth, that most of what people published was the

20:22.160 --> 20:23.800
truth.

20:23.800 --> 20:28.560
Even though we knew in our hearts that, you know, like the things that happened on 9-11

20:28.560 --> 20:34.640
have been sort of obviously mistold, although we might not claim to know what happened.

20:34.640 --> 20:40.840
It's weird how even people like us were not able to apply that skepticism fully to the

20:40.840 --> 20:44.960
whole picture in front of us, but rather just those two buildings over there, just those

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
airplanes.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
That's it.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.840
That, that seems weird, but everything else seems kosher.

20:50.840 --> 20:55.600
So as long as you tell a good story, then it's totally okay.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.240
It's when the details don't match up that things start to get hairy.

20:59.240 --> 21:04.400
And it seems to me that with the pandemic, because they closed the trap too early, because

21:04.400 --> 21:12.440
they, they went all in before we were afraid enough or confused enough, there are sufficient

21:12.440 --> 21:18.000
people outside of the illusion to rescue.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.440
I do really think it's possible.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.600
I just think that they're using all of their might, all of their social media power, all

21:23.600 --> 21:29.680
of their dirty tricks, all of their, their illusions, all of their disguises to make sure

21:29.680 --> 21:34.120
that we don't figure out that we're actually really close to a, a threshold moment where

21:34.120 --> 21:39.440
irrespective of who got us there, we're all going to be able to wake up and leave these,

21:39.440 --> 21:44.200
these meddlers behind, because once we understand the whole picture, it doesn't matter who's

21:44.200 --> 21:46.760
selling an Ivermectin book.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.560
Once we understand the whole picture, it doesn't matter who's running that study, or who's

21:50.560 --> 21:53.840
doing that group, or who's on that telegram chat.

21:53.840 --> 21:59.120
Once we understand the big picture, then any of these one trick ponies will be completely

21:59.120 --> 22:03.520
irrelevant rather than part of a relevant barbershop quartet that everybody thinks is

22:03.520 --> 22:06.440
such harmony.

22:06.440 --> 22:11.000
I think that's the reason why the illusion of consensus was something that needed to be

22:11.000 --> 22:18.360
almost stolen and diluted, because you had to, you had to take this and make something

22:18.360 --> 22:23.920
other than an illusion of consensus about a novel virus in order to dilute the power

22:23.920 --> 22:25.440
of this idea.

22:25.440 --> 22:31.760
It's just unfortunate that maybe a friend was involved in, in that operation, wittingly

22:31.760 --> 22:35.240
or unwittingly, and that's what I find most disappointing about it.

22:35.240 --> 22:40.520
I think this faith in a novel virus is something that is really essentially an attack on us

22:40.520 --> 22:49.680
in our way of life, whatever you want to call it, baseball and apple pie, true freedom,

22:49.680 --> 22:53.120
not whatever we're talking about now.

22:53.120 --> 22:59.000
And that story, this story here that's on the, on the screen is how they're doing it,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.360
how they intend to do it to our children.

23:02.360 --> 23:09.680
Create enough chaos in their mind and enough insecurity with the adults in the world that,

23:09.680 --> 23:18.920
you know, you'll see very soon we'll have a, a kind of middle aged adult, 30 year olds

23:18.920 --> 23:24.880
thinking that they belong in Congress, thinking that they belong on States and, and rejecting

23:24.880 --> 23:31.560
the 50 year olds like me and you and the 40 year olds and maybe even the 60 year olds,

23:31.560 --> 23:35.160
they're all going to get rejected because of this, you know, all these old people, including

23:35.160 --> 23:37.760
the old person in office right now.

23:37.760 --> 23:43.840
That's part of the intergenerational fracturing that, that was probably intended with regard

23:43.840 --> 23:50.040
to the pandemic to try and make sure that most of the skeptics were old and most of the people

23:50.040 --> 23:51.960
on the good side were young.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.640
And so then in the end, when the next one comes along, we can glump all these old people

23:56.640 --> 24:00.760
into one group, transfect them all.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.920
I don't know, I'm, I'm a bit, I'm a bit off target here and I'm wasting a little time,

24:04.920 --> 24:10.960
but I feel as though we are at a crucial moment where I don't need to address anything else

24:10.960 --> 24:12.680
other than to repeat what I'm saying.

24:12.680 --> 24:21.480
And that is that that the people that are on one side, the other, the top, the bottom,

24:21.480 --> 24:24.400
they all agree that there was a virus.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.880
They all agree that it went around the world and infected millions of people and maybe

24:28.880 --> 24:30.680
even killed millions of people.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.240
They all agree.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.680
It doesn't matter what side you're on.

24:33.680 --> 24:43.480
Tony Fauci, Kevin McCarran, Kevin McCurnan, Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Robert F. Kennedy

24:43.480 --> 25:01.100
Jr, Peter Desak, Jeffrey Sacks, Kim.com, Dr. Drew, Dr. Victory, debunk the funk, Brian

25:01.100 --> 25:04.040
Wilson or whatever is named, Daniel Wilson, what is his name?

25:04.040 --> 25:06.200
I don't care.

25:06.200 --> 25:11.200
All of them agree that there was a novel virus that probably killed millions of people that

25:11.200 --> 25:16.400
millions of more may have been saved from by transfection, but some of those people

25:16.400 --> 25:18.960
think that the transfection was adulterated.

25:18.960 --> 25:25.560
And so there was damage done that nobody's acknowledging.

25:25.560 --> 25:31.560
But if you carefully dissect that narrative, then neither side right now of all the people

25:31.560 --> 25:37.480
that have any space on social media at all, there is not one person, not one person on

25:37.480 --> 25:44.960
the either team, any team that questions the whole principle of the pandemic in the

25:44.960 --> 25:51.880
first place, not because the virus wasn't deadly or it was very mild because that's

25:51.880 --> 25:58.000
not questioning it and be very clear in your own head that if you say there was no pandemic

25:58.000 --> 26:04.360
because it was never a dangerous virus, because kids or the CFR or the IFR wasn't high enough,

26:04.360 --> 26:08.720
then you are not actively rejecting the idea of the pandemic.

26:08.720 --> 26:16.240
You are, you are giving them the pandemic and that's exactly what they want.

26:16.240 --> 26:26.040
What you need to realize is that the principle, the idea that an RNA molecule can pandemic

26:26.040 --> 26:33.840
using it as a verb can pandemic can go from a point to being everywhere on earth.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.200
That's what, that's the verb pandemic.

26:37.200 --> 26:41.680
If the, if the guitar behind me pandemics, then at some point in time at the end of the

26:41.680 --> 26:50.120
pandemic, there should be a Paul Reed Smith custom guitar in every, every place on earth

26:50.120 --> 26:53.760
and every human on earth, every human on earth should own one.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.200
Then it's a, then it's a pandemic.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.640
So you might say something like cell phones, there's a pandemic of cell phones because

26:59.960 --> 27:02.240
once we started making them there everywhere now.

27:02.240 --> 27:09.040
So there was a pandemic of cell phones, but you can imagine all of the energy and work

27:09.040 --> 27:18.360
and human, whatever that goes into that going from one iPhone on the stage to an iPhone

27:18.360 --> 27:21.320
in everyone's pocket.

27:21.320 --> 27:26.840
And here biologically speaking, the model that we've been handed is that an RNA molecule

27:26.960 --> 27:29.560
that gets leaked.

27:29.560 --> 27:33.680
I think Robert Malone once told the story about the idea that they were recycling things

27:33.680 --> 27:39.560
from the, the laboratory in Wuhan and that after they used the animals for laboratory

27:39.560 --> 27:42.840
experiments, they would also take them down the street to the market and sell them, which

27:42.840 --> 27:47.840
is just hilarity beyond hilarity.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.200
And again, wherever, whatever story you want to tell, they took the, the, the laboratory

27:52.200 --> 28:01.160
animals out of the market and they opened up a, a WIV Wuhan Institute of Virology stall

28:01.160 --> 28:07.720
at the Wuhan market and they sold control group and experimental group, gold and hamsters

28:07.720 --> 28:10.640
and the experimental group was half price.

28:10.640 --> 28:16.560
Whatever story you want to tell, there was RNA in a small place and then it pandemiced

28:16.560 --> 28:19.280
and now we can find it everywhere.

28:19.280 --> 28:24.720
And there are lots of very useful products and methodologies to find it everywhere.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.360
That's the story that we're told.

28:26.360 --> 28:35.520
And not only that, but we're told it in a consensus sort of way everyone agrees.

28:35.520 --> 28:41.320
And so we have to be very careful because everyone also has a great faith in a great

28:41.320 --> 28:46.560
deal of this mythology around the biology of it.

28:46.560 --> 28:52.000
And so the very slippery slope is that gain of function RNA went endemic is going to

28:52.000 --> 28:58.640
permanently instill in our children that something like a fear and cleavage site, for example,

28:58.640 --> 29:02.520
can endow a virus with the ability to pandemic.

29:02.520 --> 29:07.000
And without that fear and cleavage site, it can't.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.320
We could also get to a stage where our kids actually believe that prions and, and, and

29:14.320 --> 29:18.880
chronic wasting and this kind of thing is something that can be caused by protein

29:18.880 --> 29:24.960
misfolding and that it's a natural thing that occurs as opposed to something caused

29:24.960 --> 29:30.120
by a parasite or something caused by a bacteria or something caused by a toxin, whatever

29:30.120 --> 29:35.440
it might be in each of these cases, which very few of them have been substantiated as

29:35.440 --> 29:38.840
well as you might like to think.

29:38.840 --> 29:45.800
And so I do apologize for not starting today, but in the next couple of days, for sure,

29:45.800 --> 29:50.880
we're going to start, you know, doing real hard work, you and I together on the stream

29:50.880 --> 29:56.280
about prions and about the literature that supports them and how we understand what they

29:56.280 --> 30:01.360
do and what the pre on protein does when it's not doing this, this stuff that apparently

30:01.360 --> 30:04.040
it does in these papers.

30:04.040 --> 30:10.080
But right now, the important thing to understand is that the faith in a novel virus is starting

30:10.080 --> 30:13.160
it essentially is a faith in a novel biology.

30:13.160 --> 30:18.640
And that model is something that that's where we attack.

30:18.640 --> 30:24.920
That's where logically we need to probe each of these people who is certain about what

30:24.920 --> 30:25.920
has happened.

30:25.920 --> 30:30.960
We need to have them give us details about their model, give us details about how they

30:30.960 --> 30:35.400
mechanistically understand what happened and what's happening.

30:35.400 --> 30:40.760
For example, why don't we already have thousands of people in the hospital with crowdspelled

30:40.760 --> 30:46.160
yachobs disease because of the virus, because that was something that a lot of these people

30:46.160 --> 30:50.960
said very early on in 2020 was that there would be neurological symptoms that people's

30:50.960 --> 30:56.760
behavior was going to change that maybe we would have amyloidogenic or prion like diseases

30:56.760 --> 30:58.840
in these people.

30:58.840 --> 31:04.440
And so you know, showing videos of people licking the walls or licking the windows of closed

31:04.440 --> 31:11.440
pubs was a way of suggesting that the COVID virus was going around changing people's brains

31:11.440 --> 31:14.440
because the spike protein was a prion weapon.

31:14.440 --> 31:22.320
These people said that in March and in April of 2020 when they had no business having any

31:22.320 --> 31:28.960
opinions about what the spike protein would do or not do, but they all had ideas and they

31:28.960 --> 31:30.680
weren't all mainstream people.

31:30.680 --> 31:36.440
None of them were mainstream biologists, academic biologists.

31:36.440 --> 31:42.260
They were fringe people, people that had no business calling themselves experts, no business

31:42.260 --> 31:47.080
putting themselves out there.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.160
Was I one of those people?

31:48.160 --> 31:56.120
I don't really know because I never claimed that this was a worst case scenario.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.960
I fought against the worst case scenario.

31:57.960 --> 32:02.960
I fought for the idea that it might be better not to trust the government and not to trust

32:02.960 --> 32:08.080
the pharmaceutical companies and to not take their word for it.

32:08.080 --> 32:13.920
Even though I didn't have the total biological understanding that I think I have now and can't

32:13.920 --> 32:18.640
make as cogent argument as I can now, I was already making a pretty cogent argument

32:18.640 --> 32:26.440
in March 2020 and the people that were rejecting that argument are quite striking because many

32:26.440 --> 32:39.120
of those people are now front and center of the opposition presenting being promoted together.

32:39.120 --> 32:45.480
It's incredible, really, because this is the biology they want, I think, your children

32:45.480 --> 32:51.040
to believe us to talk about us to argue about and that's not what we're going to discuss

32:51.040 --> 32:53.360
because it's not real biology.

32:53.360 --> 33:00.320
We will discuss it and we will use it to understand how a biological concept can come to exist

33:00.320 --> 33:06.480
in the literature when it might not exist in nature and it will come to understand how

33:06.480 --> 33:12.400
it is that gain of functioned virology has been exaggerated in the literature in exactly

33:12.400 --> 33:17.120
the same way with the, sorry about that, what was I doing with that for?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.960
That was weird.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.480
That is not a symbol of 666 for me.

33:21.480 --> 33:24.200
I can tell you that much right now, but I do know that everybody says that.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.800
I think it's got to be upside down to in order for that to be real.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.080
I was just holding my hand that way.

33:28.080 --> 33:33.320
I apologize, but I am sensitive to it because everybody's talking about it all the time.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.360
Anyway, I really think this is important though.

33:36.360 --> 33:41.960
It's important to understand that we have a biological story here that is plausible,

33:41.960 --> 33:45.480
that doesn't require any crazy variables.

33:45.480 --> 33:53.400
It doesn't require any as yet unverified biology.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.640
No new principles of biology.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.800
No crazy things.

33:58.800 --> 34:02.320
Just a signal in the background that we weren't measuring before because we weren't

34:02.320 --> 34:10.760
measuring before that we have been misled as being something that is actively spreading.

34:10.760 --> 34:15.080
And now how that was accomplished could be different in different places.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.560
And that's totally okay.

34:17.560 --> 34:22.560
To what extent it was deliberately done or accidentally done in different places can

34:22.560 --> 34:23.560
be different.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.560
That's totally okay.

34:24.560 --> 34:28.360
We could be very much under the yoke of a bunch of people who did it on purpose with

34:28.360 --> 34:33.040
lots of planted audience members in the United States in the magician show that we

34:33.040 --> 34:34.360
attended here.

34:34.360 --> 34:39.600
But in the Netherlands, there could be very few people in on it in Sweden.

34:39.600 --> 34:44.260
There might have been very few people in on it.

34:44.260 --> 34:49.720
And so you have to calibrate your interpretation of what happened around the world because

34:49.720 --> 34:54.200
each one of those places also saw a very different window on social media.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.280
What was the social media like in Germany?

34:56.280 --> 34:58.200
What was the social media like in the Netherlands?

34:58.200 --> 35:00.980
Quite frankly, I don't know.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.040
What was the social media like in Australia?

35:03.040 --> 35:05.840
You don't know and I don't know either.

35:05.840 --> 35:12.200
But we can guess from what we've been shown that the Australians and the New Zealand are

35:12.200 --> 35:17.360
probably pretty convinced that there was COVID because they saw it ravage our country.

35:17.360 --> 35:23.280
They saw us go bananas and they locked down and they didn't have it.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.320
So there's lots of congruent observations when they look out their window and they look

35:27.320 --> 35:30.560
at their phone to make them the believe that it did happen.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.080
Maybe it's not so bad anymore.

35:32.080 --> 35:36.400
Maybe it could happen again.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.960
But they experienced a very different window into reality than what we saw.

35:39.960 --> 35:45.200
And I would be willing to bet that the window that they saw is sufficiently incongruent

35:45.200 --> 35:49.960
from our own so that when we meet together, we're going to disagree about stuff and that's

35:49.960 --> 35:54.400
by design.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.560
The Australians and the New Zealanders are going to be especially skeptical of anybody

35:58.560 --> 36:03.680
that says there was no COVID because they saw it.

36:03.680 --> 36:09.760
And the few cases that made it over there were bad.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.000
And the theater was designed that way.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.880
You got to get sophisticated enough to see that this theater is big and it's multifaceted.

36:18.880 --> 36:23.640
It's like a stage with multiple angles and those angles are not visible to the other

36:23.640 --> 36:27.320
people but have bearing on what the other people experience.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.640
Isn't that weird?

36:29.640 --> 36:33.600
Because one audience is hearing the reaction of the other audience, but you don't know

36:33.600 --> 36:37.360
if that other audience is in on it or not.

36:37.360 --> 36:39.600
And what did they see over there?

36:39.600 --> 36:42.880
And so it's a very complicated show.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.360
It's not just a magician on stage with a couple people in the audience.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.560
It's several audiences and some of them you can't see but you're being told what they

36:50.560 --> 36:55.120
see or you're being shown a mirror image of what they see but you're not sure if any

36:55.120 --> 36:57.880
of those people are in on the or the same number of people.

36:57.880 --> 37:03.880
Maybe the whole audience is corrupt on the left but the whole audience on the right isn't.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.040
And all of these variables are under their control.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.560
They already figured out what the best way to do it is.

37:09.560 --> 37:17.320
They already tried a couple different combinations and now they're doing it well.

37:17.320 --> 37:22.000
And that's why it was so difficult for all of us to see through it in 2020 and 2021.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.600
They never thought they would have to keep this theater going and keep adding acts and

37:26.600 --> 37:30.720
keep adding actors and keep pulling more people out of the audience.

37:30.720 --> 37:35.520
They're getting very, very close to having no more people in the audience.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.000
Do you understand?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.880
There's no more almost set a particular name.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.040
There's no more.

37:45.040 --> 37:51.760
There are no more Brian artises to come out of the audience.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.400
There are no more Pierre Corey's to come out of the audience.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.600
I don't know if but you see what I mean.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.120
There's no more new ones anymore.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.560
Now they have to argue with each other.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.600
Now they have to create new rivalries.

38:03.600 --> 38:11.280
Now CHD is promoting Dr. Drew and promoting Dave Rubin because they don't have anybody

38:11.280 --> 38:14.920
else on the bench to pull out.

38:14.920 --> 38:22.720
Now Brett Weinstein is interviewing random, random people about the biology trying to

38:22.720 --> 38:25.920
confirm his biological ideas.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.320
It's incredible.

38:28.320 --> 38:35.200
People like J. Bottacharia who are faculty at Stanford University just get randomly hooked

38:35.200 --> 38:45.640
up with some guy from Canada to do a sub stack called Illusion of Consensus.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.280
Who's that kid?

38:47.280 --> 38:53.120
Why would Jay choose to do a podcast with him when he could do a podcast with any of

38:53.120 --> 38:57.120
his students or the fellow faculty member?

38:57.120 --> 39:04.000
Why some guy from Canada and why did Brett Weinstein like introduce him to the world

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
as well?

39:05.000 --> 39:10.240
If you don't see the show for what it is, it's hard to help anybody but again, seeing

39:10.240 --> 39:13.400
the show isn't for everyone.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.560
Anybody can see the show but not everybody wants to see it.

39:16.560 --> 39:23.240
Not everybody has the machinery to see it.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.160
I don't know who did this experiment but I think at one point somebody measured that

39:27.160 --> 39:33.760
like 80% of humans don't have the ability really to say no to an authority figure.

39:33.760 --> 39:39.320
So I mean, this is where we are.

39:39.320 --> 39:44.520
It is our obligation, my obligation at this point I feel to try and bring as many people

39:44.520 --> 39:49.520
as possible that want to understand this, want to try and understand this to understand

39:49.520 --> 39:50.520
it.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.160
And it's a set of bad ideas.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.520
It's a set of assumptions.

39:54.520 --> 40:00.280
It's a set of very poor and simplistic models that we have been forced to accept by the questions

40:00.280 --> 40:07.080
that we have been tricked into answering for the last couple of decades.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.080
And that's why-

40:08.080 --> 40:11.560
Scientific questions I think are very hard to get a handle on.

40:11.560 --> 40:17.960
And the reason for this is that in late modernity, which we're living in, there's simply too

40:17.960 --> 40:22.240
much knowledge for any individual human to understand all of it.

40:22.240 --> 40:31.280
And so in this world of extreme hyper specialization where it's narrower and narrower subsets

40:31.280 --> 40:35.680
of experts policing themselves and talking about how great they are, the string theorists

40:35.680 --> 40:39.200
talking about how great string theorists, the cancer researchers talking about how they're

40:39.200 --> 40:43.800
just about to cure cancer, the quantum computer researchers are just about to build a quantum

40:43.800 --> 40:45.400
computer that will be a massive breakthrough.

40:45.400 --> 40:49.720
And then if you were to say that all these fields, not much is happening, people just

40:49.720 --> 40:51.120
don't have the authority for this.

40:51.120 --> 40:56.560
And this is somehow a very different feel for science or knowledge than you would have

40:56.560 --> 41:01.880
had in 1800 or even in 1900.

41:01.880 --> 41:10.680
It's funny, I don't really get it a lot of times what I see in the chat.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.760
I guess you guys are talking to each other.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.520
Funny, funny, funny little kids.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.600
See they tell the truth all the time, right?

41:18.600 --> 41:24.360
They've told us the truth for a while now.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.840
These fields haven't made much progress.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.200
Cancer hasn't made much progress.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.000
Quantum physics hasn't made much progress.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.880
I would argue that big genetics hasn't made that much progress.

41:35.880 --> 41:40.320
We can collect the data, but we don't understand it because it's too much data.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.880
It's too much analysis.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.360
It's too much variation.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.800
And we aren't sophisticated enough to understand it.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.200
Have we gotten to the stage where we made a few restriction maps of the whole human

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
genome?

41:51.200 --> 41:54.400
Sure, we did.

41:54.400 --> 41:59.440
Have we gotten to some very low hanging fruit with regard to genetic diseases with one or

41:59.440 --> 42:01.000
two main genetic causes?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.440
Yes, we have, absolutely.

42:03.440 --> 42:08.120
But how much has that helped us understand the symphony of genes that is our natural

42:08.120 --> 42:11.040
homeostatic function of a healthy four-year-old child?

42:11.040 --> 42:13.160
Well, not very far.

42:13.160 --> 42:18.200
Not very far at all.

42:18.200 --> 42:26.720
Just like when you find out why a violin, oh, look, there was a crack in the neck of the

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
violin.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
That's why it broke.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.960
And I understand it very well.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.600
Look, that crack is right there.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.000
If you have a crack, then this violin is going to break.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.800
Well, do you understand how it is that a Stradivarius makes its music then?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.560
You don't have any idea at all.

42:40.560 --> 42:45.800
But you can indefinitely explain how it is that a violin breaks when it has a crack

42:45.800 --> 42:48.360
in its neck.

42:48.360 --> 42:54.680
And that's the kind of understanding that we have of our biology up from a genetic perspective.

42:54.680 --> 43:02.560
We understand how a broken violin can occur when there is a catastrophic error in its

43:02.560 --> 43:06.560
structure related to its function.

43:06.560 --> 43:12.800
But we can't understand how the music is made in a perfect violin.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.760
And that should be the ultimate goal, right?

43:14.760 --> 43:25.200
It shouldn't be to fix these one note genetic disorders, even though that, I guess, is a

43:25.200 --> 43:30.640
worthy goal, that's a disguised goal.

43:30.640 --> 43:38.300
Those are morally justifiable experiments in genetic manipulation that don't have any

43:38.300 --> 43:43.520
real justification in ethics other than for the particular lives of those people, you see.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.200
So you have to use it.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.680
That's what they're doing here.

43:46.680 --> 43:51.560
It is an elaborate game that they've been playing with us for a very long time to try

43:51.560 --> 44:00.680
and permanently remove our reverence for the sacred, for the sacred of the perfect

44:00.680 --> 44:02.080
child when it's born.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.080
It's perfect.

44:03.080 --> 44:08.200
It doesn't need a vitamin K shot and a Hep B shot.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.880
And we're not there anymore.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.960
That's not this country.

44:11.960 --> 44:16.360
This country still circumcises little boys.

44:16.360 --> 44:22.040
This country still removes the uterus of women whenever they are.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.480
They might need it.

44:25.480 --> 44:30.840
We're in a very, very dire straits right now because there are lots of young people who

44:30.840 --> 44:35.560
don't understand this and don't can't hear the truth when it's said to them.

44:35.560 --> 44:42.120
They don't even hear the truth when it's said to them like this, well, wait, we don't even

44:42.120 --> 44:43.120
hear the truth.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.920
People understand just about everything.

44:44.920 --> 44:50.080
1900, Hilbert could still understand just about all of mathematics.

44:50.080 --> 44:55.920
And so the sort of specialization, I think, has made it a much harder question to get

44:55.920 --> 44:59.800
a handle on.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.920
We don't have a handle on it.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
They are lying to us.

45:01.920 --> 45:05.520
Of course, Tucker Carlson can tell you that he's lying and sort of feel it.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.720
You know that he's lying.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.720
You don't want to believe it.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.720
But he most definitely is.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.720
I don't want to.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.520
I unfortunately know.

45:12.520 --> 45:16.920
The reason why I know I don't want to be a liar, I think it's like really important

45:16.920 --> 45:18.120
not to be a liar.

45:18.120 --> 45:23.440
The reason why I know is because there was a very gigantic lie that he told on national

45:23.440 --> 45:28.520
television after covering a Vanity Fair article that was also a lie.

45:28.520 --> 45:32.520
It was a Vanity Fair article about the group drastic, which at the time I was a member

45:32.520 --> 45:34.680
of.

45:34.680 --> 45:40.680
And he said that drastic was started by a guy by the name of Jamie Metzel.

45:40.680 --> 45:46.360
The only way that that could have happened is if Jamie Metzel was Billy Bo Stickson.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.680
And it wouldn't surprise me if he was.

45:48.680 --> 45:53.200
But the point was is that if he told the truth about that, then someone else was lying to

45:53.200 --> 45:55.880
me from the very beginning.

45:55.880 --> 46:02.040
That means that the diffuse proposal was actually turned over not to a foreign national with

46:02.040 --> 46:12.880
the pseudonym Billy Bo Stickson, but to an American futurist named Jamie Metzel.

46:12.880 --> 46:15.640
Now I'm not saying that Jamie Metzel started drastic.

46:15.640 --> 46:19.120
I don't think he did, but I don't know who Billy Bo Stickson is.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.840
Billy Bo Stickson is still an anonymous person on Twitter.

46:22.840 --> 46:29.280
And that is the account that started the group that later was called drastic.

46:29.280 --> 46:34.800
The group that kicked me out, the moment that I said, we have to talk about transfection,

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
not the virus.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.200
The virus doesn't matter.

46:37.200 --> 46:41.120
Where the virus came from doesn't matter because they want to transfect everybody and we shouldn't

46:41.120 --> 46:42.120
be doing that.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.520
Then they asked me to leave.

46:44.520 --> 46:51.940
And I'm not sure if it's split in half right then or before then, but there's drastic science

46:51.940 --> 46:54.100
and drastic.

46:54.100 --> 46:57.060
And I think some people say they're members of both.

46:57.060 --> 47:00.260
Some people aren't.

47:00.260 --> 47:03.940
It's all an elaborate hoax.

47:03.940 --> 47:06.740
And these are the sort of moments.

47:06.740 --> 47:12.620
Political cut I have on the specialization is always that if you analyze the politics

47:12.620 --> 47:17.500
of science, the specialization should make you suspicious because if it's gotten harder

47:17.500 --> 47:22.940
to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate.

47:22.940 --> 47:28.620
And then one should be a little bit suspicious and that's sort of my starting bias.

47:28.620 --> 47:32.300
And I'm going to keep playing this video like every week because I think it is the most

47:32.300 --> 47:35.100
spot on video of any of these people.

47:35.100 --> 47:41.660
And it's just striking that it's this guy's chubby belly saying it.

47:41.660 --> 47:47.300
Because I do think that this guy is near the top of a group of people at the helm of a

47:47.300 --> 47:55.540
weaponized pile of money or two that is vying for control of America and vying for control

47:55.540 --> 48:01.060
of the West, if you will, because he's invested in Canadian companies, he's invested in lots

48:01.060 --> 48:05.500
of places, you know, and they're all part of this.

48:05.500 --> 48:07.660
Eric Weinstein is definitely part of this.

48:07.660 --> 48:08.900
Brett Weinstein's part of it.

48:08.900 --> 48:10.700
Brett's dad is part of it.

48:10.700 --> 48:18.700
It can be zero doubt anymore, otherwise Brett's dad would not be one of the foremost arbitrators

48:18.700 --> 48:25.620
of intellectual property law, specifically in biotechnology in the United States.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.540
Otherwise Brett would be very proud of his dad.

48:27.540 --> 48:32.180
Otherwise Brett would have talked with Bobby Kennedy about his dad and how their dads work

48:32.180 --> 48:36.940
together when he had him on his podcast in November of 2021 and he would have played

48:36.940 --> 48:50.260
the podcast in November of 2021 instead of playing the podcast in February of 2024.

48:50.260 --> 48:54.700
And when again, when you look in the in the rear view mirror and all these things line

48:54.700 --> 49:00.060
up like that, what conclusion can you come to other than, I guess I better not look backwards

49:00.060 --> 49:01.060
anymore.

49:01.060 --> 49:06.180
Otherwise I might come to the conclusion that this wasn't the pandemic they said it was.

49:06.180 --> 49:08.780
Are we actually all engaging in the lookaway doctrine?

49:08.780 --> 49:13.140
I'm just not going to look because if I look, I know I'm going to figure it out.

49:13.140 --> 49:14.740
Could be.

49:14.740 --> 49:20.060
It could be that there are a lot of people who know, really know in their heart, but just

49:20.060 --> 49:25.820
don't have the courage or the stones to accept it.

49:25.820 --> 49:33.220
Even when they're shown that these people actually admitting it, they can't quite accept it.

49:33.220 --> 49:36.780
So intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting

49:36.780 --> 49:39.860
the immune system is dumb.

49:39.860 --> 49:45.580
Is something that none of these people make the list will ever talk about or say or acknowledge.

49:45.580 --> 49:47.620
Yeah, that's probably the best way to say it.

49:47.620 --> 49:48.620
Nope.

49:48.620 --> 49:50.540
None of them will.

49:50.540 --> 49:54.500
And curiously, none of the people at the top of CHD will there's plenty of people in

49:54.500 --> 49:59.940
the middle of CHD that have kids that have suffered that have real skin in the game that

49:59.940 --> 50:01.860
agree wholeheartedly with this statement.

50:01.860 --> 50:09.540
But the people at the top, they don't say it.

50:09.540 --> 50:10.780
They've never said it.

50:10.780 --> 50:13.380
That's the weird part.

50:13.380 --> 50:19.900
Try to find a statement where the longtime scientific advisor of CHD, Meryl Nast says

50:19.900 --> 50:27.420
anything about the childhood vaccine schedule in America by itself.

50:27.420 --> 50:34.340
Find a place where we see one of these people saying it.

50:34.340 --> 50:36.580
It's very rare.

50:36.580 --> 50:43.980
It's very, very, very rare for an organization that at least at the heart is completely opposed

50:43.980 --> 50:47.740
to this.

50:47.740 --> 50:52.540
And there's a reason for it, ladies and gentlemen, because this is a controlled operation.

50:52.540 --> 50:55.020
We are being governed.

50:55.020 --> 51:03.020
And until we stop allowing them us to be governed by this mythology, it's going to continue.

51:03.020 --> 51:05.060
I don't really know all the ways out.

51:05.060 --> 51:07.300
I don't other than one at a time.

51:07.300 --> 51:09.380
We all need to awaken.

51:09.380 --> 51:14.380
We need to just come to realize that there are simple ways to say these things.

51:14.380 --> 51:17.340
There are easy ways to talk about this stuff.

51:17.340 --> 51:22.700
There are very...

51:22.700 --> 51:26.500
We could make substantial gains in our general understanding of biology.

51:26.500 --> 51:31.180
We could make substantial gains in the average person's understanding of what really happened

51:31.180 --> 51:32.580
in the pandemic.

51:32.580 --> 51:38.540
But unfortunately, many, many, many people with large platforms, with growing followings,

51:38.540 --> 51:43.940
are still focused on the same thing that they were focused on in 2020.

51:43.940 --> 51:46.500
The same thing.

51:46.500 --> 51:52.340
After four years, they still can't talk about the vaccine schedule in America as a particular

51:52.340 --> 51:53.900
example.

51:53.900 --> 52:00.980
They can't talk about the Prep Act, the Vaccine Act, and the lack of strict liability on vaccines

52:00.980 --> 52:03.380
as just a thing that everybody should understand.

52:03.380 --> 52:05.780
It's very few people.

52:05.780 --> 52:10.860
Lots of people will spend an hour on stage talking about Ivermectin studies.

52:10.860 --> 52:15.700
Lots of people will be happy to break down the details of Ivermdesivir study for you.

52:15.700 --> 52:20.780
Lots of people will be happy to break down the details of a hydroxychloroquine study for

52:20.780 --> 52:26.500
you, but not very many people are going to break down the literature of coronaviruses

52:26.500 --> 52:27.500
for you.

52:27.500 --> 52:31.340
Not very many people are going to break down the literature of prions for you, but lots

52:31.340 --> 52:39.340
of them are happy to talk about a preprint about prions from last year.

52:39.340 --> 52:48.740
The only person that's taught you immunology 101 to this date in four years is me.

52:48.740 --> 52:57.420
Maybe Dr. Bean, maybe besides that who?

52:57.420 --> 52:58.500
Think about that.

52:58.500 --> 53:03.620
Which of these MDs has taught you about linked recognition?

53:03.620 --> 53:09.260
This is the last time Meryl Nast, Robert Malone, Pierre Corey, Jessica Rose.

53:09.260 --> 53:11.980
When's the last time they mentioned linked recognition?

53:11.980 --> 53:20.580
Do you think that they could explain that at a whiteboard?

53:20.580 --> 53:24.700
Do you see the problem, ladies and gentlemen?

53:24.700 --> 53:28.180
Do you see the problem?

53:28.180 --> 53:29.500
They're spreading ideas.

53:29.500 --> 53:32.060
It's just not the good ones.

53:32.060 --> 53:35.820
They're spreading lots of ideas, just not the good ones.

53:35.820 --> 53:43.420
They're questioning a lot of ideas, just not the ones that need to be questioned.

53:43.420 --> 53:51.100
I want to take a break from hammering that home to watch a video from the past, which

53:51.100 --> 53:52.860
is a video from 11 years ago.

53:52.860 --> 53:57.380
I have no idea what I'm about to find, and I'm going to watch this video for exactly

53:57.380 --> 54:01.260
an hour and then I'm going to stop because I've got basketball this afternoon again

54:01.260 --> 54:05.580
because my boys are so dedicated like Shaolin monks.

54:05.580 --> 54:07.540
Now, they're actually upset.

54:07.540 --> 54:11.540
They were talking to me yesterday in the car that they realized that the place where

54:11.540 --> 54:15.980
we're going is closed on Easter Sunday, and so they were panicking because the rec center

54:15.980 --> 54:21.140
is also closed on Easter Sunday, and what are we going to do for basketball on that

54:21.140 --> 54:22.140
day?

54:22.140 --> 54:28.820
Well, all I can say is I hope with all of my heart that this kind of dedication continues

54:28.820 --> 54:31.380
because I'm sure it's going to pay off for them.

54:31.380 --> 54:34.860
And I'm sure that they're going to have a good time next year in basketball.

54:34.860 --> 54:36.740
It's really nice to see.

54:36.740 --> 54:42.860
And I've got you guys to thank for that because part of the reason why I'm able to do it is

54:42.860 --> 54:52.340
because, well, I mean, people are supporting this stream and we're not, like I said, we

54:52.340 --> 54:53.580
still need more supporters.

54:53.580 --> 54:57.100
We need more support for next month, but so far so good.

54:57.100 --> 55:01.460
And I'm just, I'm just having faith that somehow or another people are going to hear

55:01.460 --> 55:02.460
this stream.

55:02.460 --> 55:07.020
People are going to get the message and enough people that have the means are going to be

55:07.020 --> 55:13.980
moved enough to support me so that this can continue because I think it's the vital work.

55:13.980 --> 55:22.380
It's the only stream on the internet that's trying desperately to reawaken a reverence

55:22.380 --> 55:28.060
for the sacred and using an appreciation for biology to try and do it.

55:28.060 --> 55:32.300
And so if you think this is a unique message and something that needs to get out, please

55:32.300 --> 55:36.300
take the time to go to get your own biological and support my work.

55:36.300 --> 55:41.420
Here is a video from 11 years ago with Craig Bettner and he's going to talk about what

55:41.420 --> 55:47.100
life is and he's going to talk about the challenges of understanding how life works.

55:47.100 --> 55:51.500
And that's all I really know because I read the description and the video description.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.180
So I have no idea what I'm going to hear here.

55:53.180 --> 55:57.900
It could be that we're about to waste an hour of our time, but my guess is that that's

55:57.900 --> 55:58.900
not the case.

55:58.900 --> 55:59.900
Here we go.

55:59.900 --> 56:00.900
Thank you Luke.

56:00.900 --> 56:04.420
T-Shock, Harvest, distinguished guests.

56:04.420 --> 56:08.820
It is a great pleasure and honor for me both on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy and the

56:08.820 --> 56:13.180
Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies to speak on this historic occasion.

56:13.180 --> 56:17.140
My task is to give some of the background to how the remarkable lecture that we celebrate

56:17.140 --> 56:19.980
tonight came to be given.

56:19.980 --> 56:25.020
Let me begin with someone that few of you have probably heard of.

56:25.020 --> 56:30.300
Edmund Taylor Whittaker was a distinguished mathematician, later historian of science

56:30.300 --> 56:33.620
who spent most of his long career at the University of Edinburgh.

56:33.620 --> 56:39.420
But he did spend some time here as one of the last Royal Astronomers of Ireland.

56:39.420 --> 56:43.900
And he is significant for the story of tonight's lecture for two reasons.

56:43.900 --> 56:49.740
Firstly, while in Dublin he had a young student, a man called Aemon de Valera, and he inspired

56:49.740 --> 56:56.260
in him a lifelong devotion to mathematics and a great admiration for the legacy of William

56:56.260 --> 56:57.260
Rowan Hamilton.

56:57.260 --> 57:00.660
And we'll come on to that later.

57:00.660 --> 57:06.660
So when de Valera then in the late 1930s began to think of establishing what was then

57:06.660 --> 57:11.380
only the second Institute for Advanced Studies in the world, he naturally turned to his former

57:11.380 --> 57:13.460
teacher for advice.

57:13.460 --> 57:16.340
And Whittaker made one key recommendation.

57:16.340 --> 57:21.060
He told de Valera that the hardest thing to do was to give a comprehensible public

57:21.060 --> 57:25.740
lecture, something I can vouch for actually from personal experience.

57:25.740 --> 57:30.780
And de Valera took this to heart and wrote in to the 1940 act that each school of the

57:30.780 --> 57:35.180
Institute must offer a public lecture every year.

57:35.180 --> 57:40.660
And if it hadn't been for that and the recommendation of Whittaker, we would not be here tonight.

57:40.660 --> 57:45.540
This brings me, of course, naturally on to the next major player in this story, Aemon

57:45.540 --> 57:50.060
de Valera, a remarkable man in many ways.

57:50.060 --> 57:55.020
His political career and influence on Irish society remains a subject of vigorous debate,

57:55.020 --> 57:56.020
I think it's fair to say.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.780
I'm not really sure if this is relevant.

57:57.780 --> 57:59.300
I might just fast forward through it.

57:59.300 --> 58:07.220
In these publication, Judging Dev.

58:08.220 --> 58:09.220
Yeah.

58:09.220 --> 58:14.300
What is perhaps not so widely known is that his interest in science and mathematics was

58:14.300 --> 58:16.740
in fact genuine and deep.

58:16.740 --> 58:20.500
And in fact, I recall a previous provost of this college telling me that his life used

58:20.500 --> 58:25.540
to be made miserable because at nine o'clock in the evening, his secretary would tell him

58:25.540 --> 58:30.380
that the, oh, so Euchtron was on the phone and the president was having a problem with

58:30.380 --> 58:33.900
mathematics, could the provost help him?

58:33.900 --> 58:37.900
Those days are gone, I fear.

58:37.900 --> 58:43.620
So it was this deep admiration for mathematics and science, as well as his instinctive horror,

58:43.620 --> 58:47.900
I think, at the barbarism of the Third Reich, which persuaded him to establish the Dublin

58:47.900 --> 58:53.180
Institute for Advanced Studies in 2014 and to recruit Erwin Schrodinger as the first

58:53.180 --> 58:54.900
director of its school.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.060
So we're talking about the school that he's in.

58:57.060 --> 58:58.900
So I might actually skip this.

58:58.900 --> 59:03.700
I'm sorry if that offends you at all, but I, maybe this next guy will give a better

59:03.700 --> 59:04.700
introduction.

59:04.700 --> 59:05.700
I don't know.

59:05.700 --> 59:09.260
Thank you, Luke, for putting it in context.

59:09.260 --> 59:12.780
Now I'm going to give a bit of background about what Schrodinger did on this night in

59:12.780 --> 59:17.980
February in 1943 and it's no exaggeration to say that when he did that night, sparked

59:17.980 --> 59:18.980
a revolution.

59:18.980 --> 59:23.540
He did a ruckus that went off, and we don't have a few moths in here tonight, for example,

59:23.540 --> 59:26.660
who depended on Schrodinger's water life lecture to inspire him, for example.

59:26.660 --> 59:27.660
Oh.

59:27.660 --> 59:30.780
It's all the same to say that we know DNA revolution that was natural.

59:30.780 --> 59:32.060
Did we know biotech industry?

59:32.060 --> 59:36.100
So as Luke has said, a long way away from that time, it gave rise to the whole industry.

59:36.100 --> 59:38.220
So the importance of the lecture is very important.

59:38.220 --> 59:39.860
Secondly, it was the image of the second world.

59:39.860 --> 59:40.860
Holy crap.

59:40.860 --> 59:41.860
There was devastation in Europe.

59:41.860 --> 59:44.220
I swear this is not a little constant called Ireland.

59:44.220 --> 59:45.220
This is an actual accident.

59:45.220 --> 59:46.220
I'm not kidding.

59:46.220 --> 59:47.220
I'm not kidding.

59:47.220 --> 59:50.300
Just like the monks had done in the 8th century with the book of Cales, it's very similar

59:50.300 --> 59:51.300
that it happened in Ireland.

59:51.300 --> 59:52.300
This lecture.

59:52.300 --> 59:57.060
This is so weird because I just bought this book on somebody's recommendation.

59:57.060 --> 59:59.580
I got a first copy of it.

59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.700
It's called What Is Life Mind and Matter by Erwin Schrodinger.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.980
So he's talking about the lecture that this book is based on.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:14.860
I swear on the Bible that I did not know that this was going to, oh, wow, it is really

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.860
that book.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:20.180
This was published in 67, though, this edition.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.860
So what?

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.860
Which edition is this?

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.340
It's not the first edition, then.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.340
Hmm.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:33.140
Yeah, the first edition was 44, then reprinted in 45, 48, 51 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.140
blah, blah.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.140
And then mind and matter was this one.

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140
Okay.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140
Huh.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140
So it's two books in this thing.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.820
I didn't get around to even starting it yet.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.820
So that's kind of cool.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.820
Okay.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.020
That makes Max making me more happy.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.380
Mark, the whole revolution and really helps civilization along.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.900
And we had a lecture here, if I can, where's my remote?

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.660
So Luca O'Neill's not a good guy.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.660
That's pretty funny.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:56.220
I guess I'm not surprised.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.220
Hang on.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.220
I've gone too far.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.220
Hold on.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:04.500
So we had a conference here, actually, in 1993, to commemorate the 40th anniversary

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.340
of this, called What is Life as Well.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
And I got a book out of this.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
I added this book with it.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:12.740
See, the thing is, look, the thing is it's not a hoax, okay?

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.740
First of all, let's go.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.340
I think that's a really good question, is the author of the book in on the hoax.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.500
This is the book we're talking about.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.100
It's actually what is life and mind and matter.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.940
It's two different books.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.660
Like I said, I just got this in the mail.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:30.300
So I'm not pulling this off my bookshelf and claiming I had this and read it all along.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:38.140
What I am finding, though, and that's what I do have this bookshelf for, is what I am

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:45.420
finding, I won't roll it into the screen now, though, but what I am finding are many, many

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.420
books.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.420
Sorry.

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.420
I don't know what you could.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420
Oh, yeah.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.420
I was standing on that camera.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:56.340
Books where here's Jonas Salk, survival of the wisest.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.780
That's a book you ought to read because that one's shocking.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.980
Molecular vision of life by Lily Kay.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:06.340
And this was one that I was adding to that same shelf.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:12.980
There have been lots of people who have been thinking about what humankind should do with

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:16.140
the knowledge that we now have.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.100
This book here, this book by Jonas Salk, I don't know if you've ever heard of Jonas

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:26.740
Salk, this book argues that now that we know that we are subject to evolutionary

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:33.900
pressures, now that we know how traits are passed from, from, from generation and generation,

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:39.700
isn't it our obligation to use that knowledge?

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:43.420
Isn't it our obligation as a species to use that knowledge?

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:49.300
Shouldn't we think as a species when we can, even if all other species can't?

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.940
That's what this freaking books about.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:56.060
And so where do those, where do those ideas lead us?

01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:00.620
You can, you can do that, use that model in your head very easy.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:06.340
And I suspect that there's a lot to do with this too, because again, once we understand

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.820
how our genome works, don't we have an obligation to augment it?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.860
Don't we have an obligation to improve it?

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.940
In fact, wouldn't that be part of the natural process of evolution?

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.860
If we did that to ourselves, this is the argument that they make, which just completes

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:28.860
the circle and outside of that circle is everything sacred.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:34.740
To me, it's extraordinary because it doesn't, you don't have to read a lot of books to find

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:41.420
out that it's a very, very common theme among the highest echelons of these thinkers.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:46.260
That the conclusion is that if we are an exceptional species with exceptional knowledge of ourselves,

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.380
an exceptional knowledge of the universe, it doesn't that come with some moral obligation

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.380
to use it?

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.500
And then how should we use it?

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.580
And does the rights of an individual really factor into how we use that knowledge on a

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.580
species-wide scale?

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.580
I don't know.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.140
These people don't think so.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.140
And so this is cool.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.100
I'm really excited to hear what Craig's got to say now, because now I know.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.660
I think Murphy, a colleague of mine in biochemistry, who said that water's life lecture happened

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.660
in Trinity.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.660
Many of us weren't aware of that.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.460
But the book, we were to where it was done in Trinity.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.780
And we published a book.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.300
We edited a book with all these great speakers, came to the conference that were the conference

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.300
proceedings.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.540
And just the impact, it was translated into 17 languages amazingly, this proceedings of

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.380
this event in 1993.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.980
And very importantly, we got all the people who spoke at it to sign the book.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.140
This is the names that came here in 1993.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.140
And you see them here.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.140
They're all very famous people.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:43.260
John Maynard Smith, Stuart Kauffman, Roger Penrose, Christian Doudve, Stephen Jay Gould,

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.820
Gerald Adelman, Jared Diamond.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.820
The next speaker will get better with audio.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820
This is before there's eBay.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.660
I would have auctioned it by now.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.420
And that was the water's life version in 1993.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.340
So that just shows you all these people turned up.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.900
Me and Mike Murphy in our mid-20s invited them when they all came along.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.980
And it was a great celebration.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:02.460
Now, I show this because one of the speakers, Jared Diamond, is a very famous writer.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.940
He wrote a great book called The Third Shimp on Zia Maynard Rediff.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.340
And myself and Patty Cunningham for Esauff invited Jared to come.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.700
And he wrote this nice letter back.

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:14.140
He said, apologies, but I'm unable to accept your invitation.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.060
Are you the Luca O'Neill who organized the What is Life Symposium in Trinity some years

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060
back?

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.540
Or to remember at the dinner, your co-organizer reaching over and taking some of your food,

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.300
a common sign of intimacy among primates.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.020
Did that person become your wife?

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.020
And she did?

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.020
And she's here somewhere, Margaret.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.020
There she is.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:38.500
Random applause for Margaret.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:45.380
At the time, my girlfriend, now Margaret was the official photographer of the event.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.380
And this is the Japanese translation.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380
There's all the speakers.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.380
There's Margaret Whirl.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.380
They couldn't translate her name into Japanese.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.380
But there's all the speakers.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.420
So Jared Diamond is obviously a very peculiar man.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.860
We're already happy to get that letter from him.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.900
Now let's get back to the matter in hand, though.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.740
In the book What is Life, showing her opens with this great sentence, really.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.580
He said he gave the lecture in dubs and he points that out.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.740
And he said the subject matter was a difficult one, and the lectures could not be turned popular,

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:14.300
even though the physicist's most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be used.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.140
And he was a fantastic communicator.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.740
The book was written with crystal clear prose and inspired people like Jim Watson, Seymour

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.060
Benzer, Leslie Orgel, Francis Crick.

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:26.860
All of these great giants of Maniculobaji said they read the book and they were inspired.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.380
And of course, the question is what inspired him in the first place.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:33.340
There's the book, of course, when it came out, and it says in the page, given in Trinity

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:38.340
County's Dublin, this is the 1943 edition, but what's interesting is Louis Lebrocki became

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.700
a big friend of Schrodinger, and turned up with the lectures.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.580
And sketched a picture of Schrodinger during the lecture, which we couldn't get our hands

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.220
on for this, but later on, then did a beautiful, typical Lebrocki party.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.420
So Schrodinger was very popular in Dublin, many friends, many artists, including Lebrocki.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.620
And of course, here's a great picture, I think, from the Royal Arts Academy in 1942.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.820
Here's Devallera, here's Schrodinger, here's Paul Dirac, who won the Nobel Prize with Schrodinger

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.820
outside the Royal Academy.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.700
There's a worrying number of pre-sterial notice in the background.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.300
But that was a conference that was held in Dublin when he can invite his friends.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.980
So this was the inspiration for what is life.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:15.700
A paper had come out in 1938 by a guy called Max Delbrocki, a very famous biochemist, my

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700
lack of a biologist.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:20.940
And in this paper, what they were doing is that they were radiating fruit flies at radiation,

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:24.380
fruit flies, and we heard about fruit flies yesterday from a dual half man, and they were

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:29.460
trying to quantify the smallest amount of radiation to cause a change in the phenotype,

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.460
the trait of the fly.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.460
Wow.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:34.060
So it's a small amount of radiation, and they've got maybe the wings change.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.060
Wow.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.260
From that, they said a gene must be a thousand atoms big.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260
Wow.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.260
Do you hear how dumb that is?

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.740
Can you hear that?

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.540
This is the same thing that Mark has been on for a long time, the radiation, nuclear

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:56.300
energy, mutating genes, and mutation being the primary source of evolutionary change.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:01.460
The idea was using radiation to mutate humans to make superhumans rotary.

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:06.540
This was a way of trying to understand how evolution worked, and they thought that they

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.060
could irradiate genomes and increase the rate of evolution.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.460
They actually thought this.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:20.580
These are, this is from the pool of bad ideas from which our current understanding of biology

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.860
grows.

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:28.900
So we need to understand this pool very well, who are never going to understand why this

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:33.140
tree that we call biology is so misshapen.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.140
It's wonderful.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.380
I can't believe it.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.660
A mutation in a molecule that size.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.220
Shoring around that paper, I was inspired to give his lectures, and he says in what

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.340
it's like, the target for which the ionization radiation is about a thousand atoms big.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.980
We believe a gene to be an aperiodic crystal.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.980
Very important.

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:55.020
The gene must be stable, it must be a crystal, it must have information, so it's aperiodic,

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.900
and that was the phrase he coined.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.340
And then he says it's the chromosome that contains some kind of code script, and that

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:04.940
was the first time ever the term genetic code was used on this stage in 1943.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:05.940
So that's kind of cool.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.820
So those all come from this book, that's what's really neat about it.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.820
So let me read what he cited there, because it's actually funny that he didn't read the

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.340
whole quote.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.220
Maybe the next guy will read the whole quote.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:21.340
So he said that the book starts with a quote.

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:28.780
This is the preface, and this is chapter one, and large and important and very much discussed

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:34.500
question is, how can the events in space time, which take place within the spatial boundary

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:43.900
of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.260
And the next page says the preliminary answer, which is the little, which this little book

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:53.140
will endeavor to expound and establish can be summarized as follows.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:59.340
The obvious inability of present day physics and chemistry to account for such events is

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:05.300
no reason at all for doubting that they can be accounted for by those sciences.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:11.060
In other words, just because chemistry and physics can't explain life now, there's no

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:15.780
reason to believe that in the future chemistry and physics can't explain it.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.780
Therefore, there is no sacred, there is no irreducible complexity.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:27.260
There are no emergent properties that come above and past chemistry and physics that

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.620
only occur in living systems in living patterns.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.700
There's nothing like that.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:38.220
We are a chemical soup obeying physical laws.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.340
And therefore, we are not sacred.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.220
And so that's where this book starts.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:49.220
That's where this guy is starting from, from the perspective of understanding DNA and the

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.820
human genome and the human pattern integrity.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:56.180
Of course, we now know the genetic color was the go away to describe this.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.500
Now, mind you, the only thing is two thirds of the book was not about genes at all.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500
It was about thermodynamics.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.340
And he had this awful diagram.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.340
And that's been neglected.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340
It's amazing.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.060
And for what his life was DNA.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.860
The thermodynamics was kind of forgotten about, I guess, and people often forget that we've

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.860
still worked to do on the thermodynamics of living systems.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.500
And there is the structure of DNA that came out, of course.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.300
And then we had the famous Watson and Crick paper.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.580
And I'd say Jim will speak a bit later to describe the structure of DNA.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:28.300
But very importantly, Francis Crick writes to Schrodinger in Tlantarff with a reprint

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.300
of the paper.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300
Isn't that amazing?

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:34.100
And he says here, me and Watson, we know we were very influenced by what is life.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.460
He said, we thought you'd be interested in the enclosed reprints.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.380
This is the key reprint of all biology and history.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.060
And he said, we think your term aperiodic crystal will be a very apt one.

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.060
And that shows you the influence of this very important lecture and showed you a good aperiodic

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.620
crystal does describe DNA.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.660
Now, the last thing I want to say before we hand over to our honored guest is, Flano

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.020
Bryan got involved inevitably.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.180
And he became friends with Schrodinger, and they kind of hit it off.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.900
And the third policeman, as you may know, involves the molecular exchange theory and

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900
so on.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.780
And in 1942, before the, what is life lecture, Schrodinger gave a public lecture on the Heisenberg

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.100
uncertainty principle, right, and Flano Bryan was in the audience.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.060
There was a second professor in the D.I.A.S. at the time in Celtic studies, because Devilair

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.500
had two hobbies, Irish history and mathematics.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.580
And they appointed a chair in Celtic studies, a guy called O'Reilly and Schrodinger.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.060
And O'Reilly spoke, he was an expert on St. Patrick.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.620
And he said there was a historical record that there were two, St. Patrick's.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.620
And this is true.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:32.820
Same from Rome, called Palladius, and one from Wales, called Patricius.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.060
And then Schrodinger gets up and he talks about the quantum world, the uncertainty of

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.580
existence, you know.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:43.380
And the next thing in the Irish times, Flano Bryan writes the funniest science joke on record.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:47.740
The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, with its strange combination of Celtic history

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.580
and cosmic physics, has proven that there were two St. Patrick's and no God.

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:56.140
And I was just fine, that's very funny.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.220
And that's a round of applause for Flano Bryan, even though he isn't here.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.300
What a wonderful phrase.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.700
So this just shows you the influence Schrodinger had.

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.460
And now it gives me a great pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker for tonight.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.300
And no finer person could we have for this task to reflect on Schrodinger.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.140
And of course he's here for Esauf as well.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:15.740
And I'd like you to welcome Craig Venter, who's going to speak about what is life,

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.580
a 21st century perspective.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.580
Craig.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:41.220
Well, thank you for that wonderful layup for this exciting event.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:47.860
And Teischach and Provost, distinguished guests, family and friends.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:52.860
It's indeed an honor to be here for this event.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:58.580
And I was asked earlier whether the goal is to dissect what Schrodinger had spoken about

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:03.580
and written, or to present the new summary.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:10.340
And I always like to be forward looking, so I won't give you a history lesson, except

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.340
for very briefly.

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:16.220
I will present our findings first on reading the genetic code and then learning to synthesize

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.220
and write the genetic code.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:22.180
And as many of you know, we synthesized an entire genome, booted it up to create an entirely

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:28.740
new synthetic cell, where every protein in the cell was based on the synthetic DNA code.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.380
So as you all know, what Schrodinger's book was published in 1944, it was based on a series

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:36.180
of three lectures here starting in.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:43.140
What he really means there, right, is that they took the genome of a yeast and they made

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.020
a synthetic copy of it.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:52.500
And then that DNA could be used to grow another yeast.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.780
So it's not exactly what he's suggesting, which is like, you know, it almost seems like

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:04.380
they just went to the drawing board, made up a whole new DNA sequence, put it in a membrane

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:08.220
and it went, but that's not what they did.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:13.300
They just showed that they could copy a whole genome, make a synthetic version of it and

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:20.620
that that synthetic molecule could be reinserted and it would faithfully allow that organism

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:21.620
to replicate.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:26.260
So, as far as I understand it, it's not the exact same thing as synthetic life, although

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.260
they would like you to believe.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:34.460
I mean, I guess it is synthetic life, but it's as, you know, it's still based on life.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.860
I thought that would work.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860
Sorry.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:42.860
I mean, it's really interesting to be sharing this event with Jim Watson, who have known

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.860
and had multiple interactions with over the last 25 years and, including most recently,

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.860
sharing the double helix prize for human genome sequencing with him from Cold Spring Harbor

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.860
laboratory a few years ago.

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.860
Now, Schrodger started his work with Jim Watson, and he was a scientist.

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.860
He was a scientist.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.860
He was a scientist.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.860
He was a scientist.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.860
He was a scientist.

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.860
He was a scientist.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.860
And, you know, sequencing with him from Cold Spring Harbor laboratory a few years ago.

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.860
Now, Schrodger started his lecture with a key question and an interesting insight on it.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.860
The question was, I'll read it.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.860
How can the events in space and time, which take place within the boundaries of a living

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.860
organism, be accounted for by physics and chemistry?

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.860
It's a pretty straightforward, simple question.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.860
And then he sort of answered what he could at the time.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.860
The obvious inability of present day physics and chemistry to account for such events is

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:30.860
no reason at all for doubting that they will be accounted for by the sciences.

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.860
That's good.

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.860
I only have around 40 minutes, not three lectures.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.860
I hope to convince you that there has been substantial progress in the last nearly 70

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.860
years, since Schrodger initially asked that question, to the point where the answer is

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.860
at least nearly at hand, if not in hand.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:50.860
So, I view that we're now in what I'm calling the digital age of biology.

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:55.860
My teams work on synthesizing genomes based on digital code in the computer, and four

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:59.860
bottles of chemicals illustrates the ultimate link between the computer code and the digital

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.860
code.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:05.860
Life as code, as you heard in the introduction, was very clearly articulated by Schrodinger

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.860
as code script.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:10.860
I think perhaps even more importantly, and something I missed on the first few readings

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:16.860
of his book early in my career, was, as far as I can tell, the first mention that this

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:18.860
code could be as simple as a binary code.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.860
And he used the example of Morris code with just dots and dashes.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.860
It could be sufficient to give 34 different specifications.

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:31.860
I've searched and I have not find any earlier references to the Morris code, although

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:38.860
a historian that I know wrote a quick letter asking about that then in quick response was,

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.860
it was a metaphor that was obvious to everybody, so I don't know if it was obvious to everybody

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.860
after Schrodinger's book or sometime before.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:48.860
One of the things, though, Schrodinger was right about a lot of things, which is why,

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:51.860
in fact, I think we celebrate what he talked about and what he wrote about.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:57.860
But some things he was clearly wrong about, like most scientists in his time, and he relied

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.860
on the biologist of the day.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.860
They thought that protein, not DNA, was the genetic information.

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:09.860
And I think it's really quite extraordinary because just in 1944, in the same year that

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:15.860
he published his book, is when the famous experiment by Oswald Avery, who was actually 65 and about

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.860
ready to retire, along with his colleagues Colin McCloud and acclaimed McCartney, published

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.860
their key paper demonstrating that DNA was actually the substance that causes bacterial

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.860
transformation and, therefore, was the genetic material.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.860
His experiment was remarkably simple.

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:33.860
And I sort of wonder why it wasn't done 50 years earlier, because with all the wonderful

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.860
genetics work going on in Drosophila, certainly people were looking at chromosomes.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.860
He simply used proteolytic enzymes to destroy all the proteins associated with the DNA and

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.860
showed that the DNA, the naked DNA, was, in fact, of the transforming factor.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.860
The impact of this paper was far from instantaneous, as has happened in this field.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:57.860
I think, in part, because there was so much bias against DNA and towards proteins that

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.860
it took a long time for that to sink in.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:06.860
In 1949, obviously, was the first sequencing of a protein by Fred Sanger, and the protein

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:07.860
was insulin.

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.860
And this work showed, in fact, that proteins consisted of linear amino acid codes.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:18.860
And he won the Nobel Prize in 1958 for that achievement, and was very key in terms of

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.860
a leader understanding of the link between DNA and proteins.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:27.860
But as you heard in the introduction, obviously, the discovery that changed the whole field

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:33.860
and started us down to DNA root was the 1953 work by Watson and Crick, with help from

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.860
Maurice Wilkins and Roslyn Franklin, showing that DNA was, in fact, a double helix, and

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.860
had a clear explanation of how it could be self-replicated.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:46.860
Again, this was not, as I understand, instantly perceived as a breakthrough, because the

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.860
biochemist was still hanging on to genetic code.

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.860
But soon, with a few more experiments from others, the world changed pretty dramatically.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.860
I think the next big thing came from the work, obviously, of Corona and Marshall Nuremberg,

01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.860
in 1961, where they worked out the triplet genetic code, three letters of genetic code,

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.860
coding for a single amino acid.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:12.860
And then this became clear how the linear DNA code that coded for the linear protein code.

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:17.860
This was followed a few years later by Robert Hawley's discovery of the structure of tRNA.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.860
And tRNA is the key, the key, a link between the messenger RNA and bringing the amino acids

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.860
in for protein synthesis.

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:29.860
So Hawley and Nuremberg and Corona shared the Nobel Prize in 1968 for that work.

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.860
The next decade brought us restriction enzymes.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.860
So my friend and colleague, Ham Smith, who is at the Venture Institute now in 1970,

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.860
did the first restriction enzymes.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.860
These are the molecular scissors that cut DNA very precisely,

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.860
and enabled the entire field of molecular engineering and molecular biology.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:49.860
And Ham Smith and Warner Arbor and Dan Nathan shared the prize in 1978 for that work.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.860
The 70s brought not only some interesting dress codes and characters,

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.860
but the beginning of the molecular splicing revolution using restriction enzymes.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:03.860
Conan Boyer and Paul Berg published the first papers on recombinant DNA.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.860
And Conan Boyer at Stanford found a patent on their work,

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:13.860
and this was used by Genentech and Eli Lilly to produce a human insulin as the first recombinant drug.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.860
DNA sequencing and reading the genetic code progressed much more slowly.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:25.860
So in 1973, a maximum in Gilbert published a paper on 24 base pairs, 24 letters of genetic code.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.860
RNA sequencing progressed a little bit faster.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:36.860
So the first actual genome, a viral genome, an RNA viral genome, was sequenced in 1976 by Walter Fiers from Belgium.

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:41.860
And this was followed the following year by Fred Sanger again, a sequence in the first DNA of virus.

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.860
And this was 5x174 that I'll bring back to mind with you.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:50.860
So this became the first DNA virus in the first viral DNA genome.

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.860
And it was also accompanied by this new sequencing technique,

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.860
now referred to as Sanger sequencing, that Sanger introduced.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.860
This is a picture of Sanger's team that sequenced 5x.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.860
The second guy from the left on the bottom is Clyde Hutchinson,

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:08.860
who was also a member of the Adventure Institute, and joined us after retiring from the University of North Carolina,

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.860
and played a key role in some of the synthetic genome work.

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:17.860
So in 1975, I was just getting my PhD as the first genes were being sequenced.

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.860
20 years later, I led the team to sequenced the first genome of a living species,

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.860
and Ham Smith was a key part of that team.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.860
This was homeless influenza.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.860
Instead of 5,000 letters of genetic code, this was 1.8 million letters of genetic code.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.860
We're about 300 times the size of the 5x genome.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:40.860
Five years later, we upped the ante 1,600 times with the first draft of the human genome using these new whole genome shot.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:50.860
So I don't know if you're clear about what he just said there, but I think he just said HIB bacteria.

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:57.860
So he sequenced HIB, which is one of the most deadly vaccines on the childhood vaccine schedule.

01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.860
At least we used to be.

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.860
Yeah, it's not a good thing.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:08.860
And its name is an H word in the beginning and then influenza in the second word,

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.860
and then B stands for something else.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.860
Instead of 5,000 letters of genetic code, this was 1.8 million letters of genetic code.

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.860
We're about 300,000 letters of genetic code.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.860
We're about 300 times the size of the 5x genome.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:25.860
Five years later, we upped the ante 1,600 times with the first draft of the human genome using these new whole genome shotgun techniques.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:33.860
The smaller paper is the public genome effort size doesn't reflect its significance only its relative significance to me.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:40.860
So the human genome is about a half a million times larger than the 5x genome.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:43.860
So it shows how fast things were developing.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.860
And reading genomes is now progressed extremely rapidly.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.860
So instead of years or decades, it now takes about two hours to sequence a human genome.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:56.860
Instead of genomes per day or genomes per hour or hours per genome, we can now, in a recently done,

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.860
a demonstration sequencing 2,000 complete microbial genomes in one run in one hour.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.860
So the pace is changing quite substantially.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:07.860
Now, I view DNA as an analog coding molecule.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.860
And when we sequence the DNA, we're converting that analog code into digital code.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:18.860
Remember that if he's right, and 11 years ago, we could sequence a human genome in two hours,

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:27.860
then the testing operation in the United States could have easily been a test deployment of a mass genotyping operation.

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:36.860
And so depending on where these remnants went and who they were sold to, if you can sequence a genome in two hours in 11 years ago,

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:42.860
then I guess chances are pretty good, then in about the same time they can do those PCR reactions,

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:50.860
they can also be amplifying a whole genome, or using other means where you don't have to amplify the genome before you sequence it,

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.860
like, for example, nanopore.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.860
And so there's a lot of sketchy stuff going on here.

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.860
And my chickens are crawling.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.860
So I'm going to show you a little bit of what's going on here.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.860
So I'm just going to check outside to make sure everything's okay.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.860
It could just be an egg that's been laid.

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.860
I'll be right back.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.860
I'm going to push play.

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:13.860
The ones and zeros in the computer are very similar to the dots and dashes that Schrodinger indicated might be the original code.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.860
And I call this process digitizing biology.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.860
A number of scientists have drawn the analogy between computers and biology.

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.860
I take these even further.

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:22.860
I take these.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.860
I describe DNA as the software of life.

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:33.860
And when we activate a synthetic genome in a cell, we call it, we describe it as booting up a genome in a cell the same way we talk about booting up a software.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.860
June 23rd of this year was Alan Turing's would have been his 100th birthday.

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:41.860
And Turing described what has become to be known as Turing machines.

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:44.860
And the machine described a set of instructions written on a tape.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.860
He also described the universal Turing machine.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:51.860
Which was a machine that could take that set of instructions and rewrite them.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.860
And this was the original origin of the digital computer.

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:59.860
Now his ideas were carried further in the 1940s by John Van Neumann, as many people know.

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.860
And he conceived of the self-replicating machine.

01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:08.860
So Von Neumann's machine consisted of a series of cells which encoded a sequence of actions that be performed by the machine.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:12.860
And using a writing head, the machine can be used by the machine.

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.860
Which encoded a sequence of actions that be performed by the machine.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.860
And using a writing head, the machine can print out a new pattern of cells.

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.860
Allowing it to make a complete copy of itself on the tape.

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:26.860
So many of people have certainly made the analogy, most recently in nature.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:29.860
Sydney Brenner played a role in almost all these stages of early biology.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.860
I wrote an article about Turing and biology.

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:38.860
And in this he argued that the best examples of a Turing and Von Neumann machine is found in biology.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.860
With the self-replicating code, the internal description of itself.

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.860
And that this is the key kernel of biological theory.

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.860
So while software was pouring out of sequence of machines around the world,

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:54.860
substantial progress was going on describing the hardware of life.

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.860
Or proteins.

01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:01.860
So in biochemistry, the first two decades of the 20th century were dominated by what was called the colloid theory.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:07.860
So life itself is explained in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances in an organism.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.860
We now know that these substances are a collection of three-dimensional protein machines,

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.860
each evolved to carry out a very specific task.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:19.860
Now, these proteins have been described as nature robots.

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.860
And if you think about it for every single task in a cell, every imaginable task is described by a panford and Reynolds.

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.860
There is a unique protein to carry out that task.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.860
It's programmed when to go on, when to go off.

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.860
And it does this based on its structure.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.860
It doesn't have consciousness.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.860
It doesn't have a control from a mind or a higher center.

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:44.860
Everything a protein does is built into its linear code derived from the DNA code.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.860
Just briefly, there's multiple protein types.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.860
Okay, I'm going to take a big left turn here.

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.860
We're going to come back to this video.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.860
I've got something hit me and I don't want to miss it.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:58.860
And I'm going to end the video early because this makes perfect sense to me now.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.860
He's talking about DNA.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.860
He's talking about proteins.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:11.860
He's talking about how all these spontaneous physical and chemical processes come together and form something that we call life.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:17.860
And I want to show you a video completely unrelated to this.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:24.860
That's so close to my heart that will give you just an insight into the kind of.

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.860
I don't know what the right word is.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:34.860
Is it passion that I have the belief that I have reverence that I have for everything that's alive?

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.860
Because here's where we are with this guy's lecture.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.860
He said protein used to be the genetic material.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.860
Then DNA was the genetic code.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.860
Then the triplet code was cracked and the tRNA structure was found.

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.860
Then restriction enzymes were found.

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.860
Then we'd made recombinant DNA.

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.860
And then we started sequencing stuff first with a 24 base pair sequence.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.860
Then a viral genome.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.860
Then a DNA viral genome.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:57.860
Then this first bacteria was sequenced by yours truly.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:05.860
Then a whole genome using shotgun techniques to the point where we can now in this time in this lecture read a genome in two hours.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.860
It's much lower than that now.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:15.860
Presumably I guess Kevin McCurnan would tell us exactly how many minutes would take with the cutting edge technology.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:23.860
Now we're talking about molecules whose emergent properties we don't understand,

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:29.860
whose relationship to other molecules produces other emergent properties that we don't understand,

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:36.860
who then fold and are post-translationally modified in ways that we don't understand.

01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:45.860
And we purport to understand how this multi-layered complex pattern integrity produces life.

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:52.860
Because we can translate some of the bases into some of the components of the next layer.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.860
Now I'm going to show you a video that may not have anything to do with this,

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:03.860
but I think if you listen to how I describe the video,

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:12.860
you will understand exactly why these people have no idea what they're talking about and how much we stand to gain by pointing that out.

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:21.860
How the foundation of biology is just based on a few gross misconceptions about fidelity and depth of understanding.

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:25.860
So let me see if I can find this video without too much looking.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:28.860
I'll just use my history. I think that'll work the best.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:52.860
I'm revealing everything I looked at in the last couple of hours here that's going to dump.

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:58.860
Let me see. Let's go back out of this.

01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:05.860
Yeah, I can't see it. I don't know why it's not on this should be on this list right here already.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.860
And it's not. So let me think. How else do I do it?

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:18.860
Nope, then I got to go back and go to YouTube and search for.

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:23.860
Oh, maybe I should use the YouTube history. That's what I thought I was using. Not that. There we go.

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.860
Dumb, dumb.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:35.860
YouTube. Where is my history stuff? What's going on? Why am I zoning out like this? Let's just go.

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:40.860
Ike TV.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:47.860
Please look it up. See if you can find Ike TV.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:52.860
So what is what are we looking at here?

01:31:52.860 --> 01:32:02.860
Well, we're looking at a stunt kite and the stunt kite is actually exactly what is sitting behind me on my desk over here.

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:07.860
You will see behind the screen here a stunt kite.

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:13.860
And that is a Diablo. It's a German made kite. It was one of the first of that design to be made.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:18.860
And that design was later sold to a French company by the name of our sky and they didn't use the same panel.

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:25.860
Oh, look that that kite won several competitions in Germany and in the Netherlands before I got my hands on it.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:30.860
And there's lots of people who would love to have that kite also for the plans of the panels.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:48.860
This video that we're about to watch is actually kite in the Netherlands being flown on a Dutch beach very recently filmed by a friend of my name Carlo flown by a friend of my name Lars and Lars is one of the best kite pilots on the planet.

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:59.860
And now what you have to understand this is going to be fun. I'm excited. It makes me happy to teach this. Hold on. I'll be right back.

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:10.860
What you have to understand is that there are a few variables involved in how the kite behaves and kite flyers who are talented are taking advantage of those variables.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:19.860
Now if you look at a stunt kite and I've got one right here and I'm going to put it underneath the thing here.

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:27.860
And so if you look at a stunt kite it's actually got a three point bridle that has points that grab the kite on three sides here.

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:39.860
And then there's another one over here that actually grabs on the other side. And so then the kite flyer is actually holding two strings and the strings are pulling each on a triangle of string like this.

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:47.860
And now the interesting thing is is that the wind is blowing in this direction right toward the kite and the kite is designed to make it fly up.

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:57.860
And so in this case if I change this around like this the kite is going to fly up right. And so it flies in the direction of the nose because the wind is blowing this way.

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:03.860
And then the kite is designed to have a nose and then the wind only moves in one direction. So it moves through the air.

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:12.860
The cool thing is that these kites also have attractor states where they are very stable facing if the wind is coming from you.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:21.860
This is the way you would be flying the kite. But the kite is also stable in this position. The kite is also stable in this position.

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:29.860
And the kite can also rotate in these positions. But if you get it the lines tangled around the end of the kite or whatever then it's not going to fly anymore.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:41.860
And so the trick of flying a kite is to jerk the kite in and out of the wind and get it to settle into different attractor states and then spin around in the wind.

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:50.860
While the wind is still moving and give it slack in the right way so that when you pull it back into the flight position the lines are still free of the kite itself.

01:34:50.860 --> 01:35:01.860
Now what I want you to do is watch this video and think very carefully about how your brain interprets what's going on here because there are very few variables.

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:07.860
There is the static shape of this kite, one shape in three dimensions.

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:15.860
There is the static direction of the wind. It's one direction and he's on the beach which means it's laboratory grade wind.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.860
It's going to be the same speed from the ground all the way up to the top of the flight window.

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:28.860
And so all of the flight is going to be very smooth and the variables will be limited because the wind is not from everywhere like it's in Pittsburgh.

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:42.860
Dutch kite flying is the best kite flying in the universe and you can lose literally weekends with your feet in the sand and get like emergency room level sunburn because it's so zen.

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:52.860
So watch this kite fly try to figure out how it is that somebody with only two lines and two handles can make the kite do what Lars makes it do.

01:35:53.860 --> 01:36:13.860
And then think about the idea that we're talking about one three dimensional shape with two lines and a protein is a three dimensional shape with electrostatic charge in a electrostatic polar solvent water.

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:25.860
And it is attached to other three dimensional magnetic electrostatic three dimensional shapes that are in a polar solvent called water.

01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:38.860
And we are being told that we understand how proteins fold and we understand how DNA gets translated into proteins.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:45.860
And to describe the physics of what Lars is doing would be pretty pretty complicated.

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:50.860
So how in the world can we already be so I got to slow it down sorry.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.860
That's why this music sounds a little bad.

01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:04.860
Let's start it over again so you can see exactly what I'm talking about.

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:17.860
So think very carefully now how would you describe what's happening here how do we understand this.

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:31.860
I want you to think about a protein as a kite connected to another kite connected to another kite and each one of the 20 amino acids has a different shape that interacts with the wind in a different way.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:46.860
And depending on how they are connected depending on the bridal connection between them depending on the sugars that are deposited on them depending on the speed that they come through the ribosome depending on the particular kind of ribosome.

01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:55.860
The chain of kites will come out in a very different way and fly in a very different way and have a very different effect on other proteins.

01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:03.860
And we claim to be able to reasonably understand that or we're very soon going to be able to understand it.

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:10.860
Can you understand what Lars is doing right now?

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.860
Does it make sense to you?

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:19.860
Because I assure you whatever is going on in the simplest protein is much more complex than this.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.860
The physics and the chemistry are much more complex than the physics of this.

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:26.860
Even a whole chain of these.

01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:28.860
And we can understand this.

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.860
I have no doubt we can understand this.

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:43.860
But trying to understand the irreducible complexity of protein folding, of protein modification and of the pattern integrity that is a cell.

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.860
Never mind tissue. Never mind an organism.

01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.860
A developing baby.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.860
A developing teenager.

01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.860
My goodness ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.860
Let's stay focused on the physics and chemistry we can understand.

01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.860
Let's stay focused on the phenomenon that we can harness.

01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:08.860
Instead of trying to convince all of our children that they're nothing more than chemistry and physics.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.860
Because that's ridiculous.

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.860
I really believe that.

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.860
I really think that's at the heart of this.

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:19.860
We have to convince our young people that they're much more valuable than that.

01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.860
That they're much more precious than that.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:26.860
We need to go back to the stage where people aren't getting tattoos.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:33.860
Where people are very interested in whether or not should I pierce my ear or not.

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.860
That's where we need to go back to.

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.860
And I think that if you start to see.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:42.860
I'll give you another example.

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:46.860
I don't know if I can get that out of my list.

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.860
Let's see if that's a good one.

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:50.860
Is that listed here?

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.860
Yeah, let's do this one.

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.860
Shall we do this one?

01:39:54.860 --> 01:40:00.860
To keep doing this to a raw egg until it spins and then catch it and stop it.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:06.860
This is one of my favorite math teachers that I like to share with people.

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:12.860
Let's listen to this and then I'll end the show.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:41.860
Thank you.

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:47.860
Once in a while you run into somebody who happens to be carrying around an inclined plane.

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:53.860
And he produces from the recess of his toy box two jars.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:58.860
One of them is filled with top quality basmati rights from India.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:04.860
And the other one is filled with top quality air from Birmingham.

01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:10.860
And they can be made to roll down this slope.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.860
You can see that they roll down quite fast.

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:17.860
Not exactly the same way because the moment of inertia is doing something,

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:22.860
but they roll down quite fast.

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:32.860
Now, what I propose to do is to investigate how the speed of descent,

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:36.860
how fast it goes down, depends on the amount of grains inside.

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.860
Here we have a big question mark.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:44.860
The only two data points available, we know that when the jar is practically empty,

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:48.860
that's represented by zero, it's quite fast.

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.860
And on the other hand, when the jar is practically full, that's represented by one,

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.860
it's also going down quite fast.

01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:55.860
So how does that work?

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:59.860
Well, let us experiment immediately.

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:05.860
And in order to make the contrast striking, I shall leave one of the jars about two thirds full,

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:09.860
one third empty depending on the degree of optimism, and the other one,

01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:12.860
one third full or two thirds empty.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:15.860
So I shall do that.

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:22.860
Is that a good amount? Maybe a little more.

01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.860
Good.

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:28.860
Let's begin with the two thirds full one.

01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:34.860
Now, as far as I can imagine, there are three possibilities on there.

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:39.860
Perhaps it will go down at the same speed as before between those two points,

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:46.860
because if you remember the story and believe the story of Galileo dropping those two heavy balls from the tower of Pisa,

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:52.860
the speed of descent didn't depend on the weight, and perhaps it's the same with grains.

01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:58.860
In that case, it will be the same speed no matter what amount of sand, amount of grains,

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.860
amount of rice inside.

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:02.860
Perhaps it will go down at the same speed.

01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:04.860
On that hand, maybe it will go down faster.

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.860
Or perhaps it will go down slower.

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:07.860
So let's take a vote.

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:12.860
Who thinks it will go down at the same speed as before?

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:16.860
Who thinks it will go down faster than before? Faster, faster.

01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:21.860
Who thinks it will go down more slowly than before?

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:24.860
Who's two-shite vote?

01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:27.860
Well, let's do this.

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:31.860
So this is two-thirds.

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:32.860
Are you ready?

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:41.860
It starts going down, and it goes down very, very slowly, very slowly.

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:47.860
Not only does it go down slowly, but there is a very interesting phenomenon going on.

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:54.860
Along what we make called free surface, the surface that's exposed between the grains and the air,

01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.860
there is a sort of avalanche land slide going on.

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:03.860
The sand and the rice grains are going down, just sliding down all the time.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:09.860
And the rest of the rice, on the other hand, the rest of the rice grains are sticking to the receptacle,

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:10.860
to the jar.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:14.860
In some sense, therefore, if you have studied something like fluid dynamics,

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:19.860
you can say that it's acting like viscous fluid, sticky fluid.

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.860
By the way, you can do the same experiment with honey,

01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:25.860
and if you do it with honey, something interesting happens.

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.860
We shall come back in a moment.

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:31.860
Okay, so that was the first experiment.

01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:34.860
Now, let's go through the next one.

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.860
Okay, so he's might not get to the honey, because I do have to go to basketball in a few minutes.

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.860
The honey experiment, if you put the honey on there, the jar won't move at all,

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.860
and if you come back in about a half an hour, the jar will have moved.

01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.860
When you come back in another half an hour, it will have moved again.

01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:53.860
And so honey is just a very extreme example of the fluid dynamics that are shown here.

01:44:53.860 --> 01:45:00.860
What I'm trying to get at is that proteins and their production, if it occurs in the way that we're told,

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:06.860
which is an RNA goes through a ribosome and then a protein comes out some other hole.

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.860
That is all occurring inside of water at the molecular scale,

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:18.860
and water behaves more like polarized magnets the size of rice grains than it would any other,

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.860
you can't come up with any other analogy for it.

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:27.860
It's water, and it's water at the molecular scale, which is one of the reasons why a lot of the talk

01:45:27.860 --> 01:45:31.860
about what water does at the molecular scale is so important

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:37.860
and why what water does at the molecular scale around proteins and DNA and in cells is important,

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:46.860
because it is a repetitive shaped polar molecule that can assume a crystal lattice can dissolve many things in it.

01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:51.860
And so the structure that those molecules take can be ordered or unordered,

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:54.860
and the ordered water has different properties.

01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:59.860
Ordered water could be ordered around proteins and around biomolecules,

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:05.860
so trying to understand what these biomolecules do in the context of the polar solvent of water

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:12.860
is a very complex system to model, that we are not even coming close to modeling.

01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:19.860
And I'm trying to give you, if I'm not failing, an example of a system where there are many little parts

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:27.860
that collectively produce results that aren't intuitive to how we apply our understanding to the physical world,

01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:32.860
and nothing about how we understand the physical world of life applies at the molecular scale

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:38.860
with regard to protein folding, protein interaction, protein regulation, degradation, et cetera.

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:45.860
And so they are grossly over-exaggerating how much we understand about the link between DNA and protein

01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.860
and how proteins work to produce the pattern integrity that is us.

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:54.860
Are there proteins? Yes, are there DNA probably? Is there mRNA probably?

01:46:54.860 --> 01:47:01.860
Are there ribosomes that do that? Of course.

01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:05.860
But that's, again, like saying that there are strings on the violin.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:10.860
This wood has been used to produce it. If there's a crack in the neck, a violin could break,

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:17.860
but understanding how a stratovarius is produced and made, because you understand that that's the kind of wood

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:23.860
or that that cracks a bad sign or that the strings make the noise, doesn't really tell you that you understand

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:28.860
what a stratovarius violin is, and that's all the farther we've gotten with understanding life.

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:33.860
We are at the stage where we can describe why a crack in the neck of the violin is a bad thing

01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:39.860
and we can understand that the sound comes from the strings vibrating and resonating with the body.

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:42.860
That's it. That's all we got.

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:47.860
We haven't even gotten to the stage yet where we can appreciate the idea that whatever varnish was used on the violin

01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:51.860
could have a significant effect on its total qualities.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.860
Never mind thinking about how the varnish would be made or who would have made it

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.860
or why they chose the ingredients that they did.

01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:03.860
And yet they're already telling you that they know how to make the stratovarius violin

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.860
and they're going to make each one of us into one.

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:09.860
Okay, listen to this guy, because I really think he's fun.

01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.860
Now they have four possibilities on there.

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:17.860
Perhaps it will go down faster than when it was full or empty.

01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:22.860
Oh, perhaps it will go down faster than this, but slower than when it was full or empty.

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.860
So halfway between.

01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:28.860
Or perhaps it will be very sluggish and even more slowly than this.

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:33.860
Or those of you who have symmetric minds, like mathematicians, might say

01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:37.860
there must be some symmetry between F and one minus F, if you see what I mean.

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:42.860
So perhaps it will go down at the same speed as this one, so a little bit slower down.

01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:49.860
So who thinks it will be the champion and go down very fast, faster than zero one?

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.860
Those are the risk takers.

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:58.860
Who thinks it will go down faster than this one, but slower than zero one?

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.860
By the way, reasonable people vote for this option, yeah?

01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:08.860
Okay, and who thinks it will go down even more slowly than what we have seen right now?

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:13.860
And who thinks it will go down more or less at the same speed as the previous experiment?

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:17.860
So symmetry school, those are the mathematical reminded people, congratulations.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.860
Okay, so let's try to do this.

01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:23.860
Nothing up this sleeve, nothing up this sleeve.

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:25.860
Are you ready?

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:39.860
Not only does it stop completely dead, but it's quite stable.

01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:43.860
I mean, I can push it and then no, no, no, I don't want to go.

01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:52.860
It stops completely dead, which I want you to imagine the idea how this shape.

01:49:52.860 --> 01:50:01.860
Imagine the idea that in protein dynamics, in genetic dynamics, in the dynamics between DNA and cell division,

01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:10.860
in the dynamics between DNA and RNA translation, in the dynamics between RNA translation and piece and protein folding,

01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:17.860
there are non-intuitive processes like this one that have relatively simple mathematical explanations,

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:24.860
but are nevertheless extremely in a non-intuitive and layered on top of one another,

01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:32.860
so that even if you understood one of those layers, there would be several other unknown layers on top of which all summarize

01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:43.860
and summate to become the pattern integrity of a protein, of a cell, of a tissue, of an organism.

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:47.860
Now, I'm not saying that we can't make a lot of progress in understanding these systems.

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.860
I'm not saying that these are uncrackable questions.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.860
I'm saying that right now we haven't cracked them.

01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:56.860
I'm saying that we've been talking about how we're going to, for a very long time,

01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:03.860
and they've known for a long time that we aren't going to not without a drastic reorganization of how we think about ourselves,

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:10.860
how we think about our kids, and how we think about the sovereignty over those very sacred bodies,

01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:15.860
those very sacred beings.

01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:23.860
They have to get rid of the sacred in order for them to have any hope of cracking the irreducible complexity of life.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:26.860
That's what this is all about. I don't know if this was a very wandering stream or not.

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:29.860
We'll go back to that vendor. Maybe I'll watch the video beforehand.

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:34.860
I'm sorry that this was such a weird break in the matrix there.

01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:39.860
It wasn't really my plan, but I suddenly wanted to do the kite video for some reason.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.860
I hope this, and then this one seemed like it would follow perfectly.

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:47.860
I don't know. Sometimes this one man show doesn't go quite as I plan,

01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:51.860
but I've been putting a lot of work into the coming pre-on discussion,

01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:56.860
and so sometimes these streams will feel a little bit like they're on the seat of the pants,

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.860
but when I get an intuition like that, I feel like I got to do it.

01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:03.860
So hopefully it wasn't too bad. Thank you very much for joining me.

01:52:03.860 --> 01:52:06.860
I'm off to basketball. I might see it tonight, but I'll definitely see you tomorrow.

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:11.860
And then Thursday, don't forget Thomas Binder is joining Big Show, Big Show.

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:19.860
And it's 3.30. If you have the link, don't forget that I think Thomas Binder is actually speaking at the medical doctors for COVID ethics right now,

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:24.860
so you could catch that. Anyway, thanks for joining me. I'll see you guys again tomorrow.

01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:37.860
This is the micro kite. There's actually a whole video about the micro kite.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.860
You can find a video of me flying it.

01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:46.860
And if you want to look, icky TV does have a video of me flying in Norway quite a long time ago.

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:51.860
I'm not a very good pilot anymore, but at one time, I was really skilled.

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:56.860
I wonder what I could do now. Probably most of the tricks, but some of the more complicated ones

01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:01.860
that require really perfect timing would require me a while to get back into it.

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:09.860
But actually kite flying, like Lars did, a lot of that flying is actually pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:15.860
I mean, it doesn't take absolutely months and months of practice to learn some of those basic tricks.

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:20.860
And keeping a kite in the air with good wind is very easy and unbelievably relaxing.

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:24.860
You can fly circles and squares for hours and never get bored.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:29.860
Never mind if you can land or stand on one tip and that kind of stuff.

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:35.860
So one of the best ways to spend your time if you've never done it before and have a friend kite flying might be the best.

01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:42.860
Maybe we can meet at Lake Erie and fly some kite on April 8th for the eclipse.

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:45.860
I don't know, maybe you could join us. That's where we're going to be. See you soon.
