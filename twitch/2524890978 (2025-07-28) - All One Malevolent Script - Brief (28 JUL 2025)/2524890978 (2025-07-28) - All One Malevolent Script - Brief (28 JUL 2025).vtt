00:03.135 --> 00:10.561
from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

00:10.601 --> 00:19.609
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

00:19.629 --> 00:28.116
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

00:36.963 --> 00:37.283
Check.

00:40.647 --> 00:41.568
Good morning, everyone.

00:42.409 --> 00:48.215
Thank you for joining us today for Doctors for Accountability in Medicine and Media.

00:48.856 --> 00:50.517
My name is Del Bigtree.

00:52.439 --> 00:58.586
My background, I was a producer on the Emmy Award winning television show, The Doctors.

00:59.663 --> 01:10.047
For six years, I spent my career celebrating the best that medicine has to offer, the best science, the best doctors, cutting edge techniques, new surgeries.

01:10.807 --> 01:13.888
I'm a fan of great doctors and great medicine.

01:15.228 --> 01:19.350
While working on that show, I stumbled upon the story of Dr. William Thompson.

01:20.312 --> 01:29.695
the whistleblower from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that came forward in the fall of 2014 to let us know that the CDC had been corrupted.

01:30.694 --> 01:43.124
and that they were committing scientific fraud on their vaccine studies, specifically the MMR vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and its causal relationship to autism.

01:43.825 --> 01:48.028
I made a movie about that, produced it, called Vaxxed.

01:48.909 --> 01:54.053
Actually, tomorrow will be the one-year anniversary of the first premiere of Vaxxed.

02:00.262 --> 02:14.296
That began a journey for me, as I think many of the people you're about to hear from today, that takes you out of what you believe was the foundation and truth in science and specifically to vaccine research and testing.

02:15.954 --> 02:30.745
Once you start asking the appropriate questions about the vaccine program in this nation and the one that really is promoted all around the world, you begin a journey that takes you to some very scary realities.

02:32.767 --> 02:38.972
These people here today represent some of the people that I've studied and investigated and interviewed.

02:39.973 --> 02:42.234
for some of my research and the work that I'm doing.

02:42.815 --> 03:00.865
They only represent a handful of the many, many doctors across this nation in the world that are standing up now and asking for real accountability in vaccine safety, research, testing on the promotion of future vaccines and those we're using on our Children.

03:01.546 --> 03:03.927
I'm gonna let them do the talking today.

03:04.622 --> 03:10.428
Because we live in a nation right now that wants to say the science is settled around vaccines.

03:11.349 --> 03:13.070
What that means is we're done.

03:13.971 --> 03:19.737
We're saying that we accept a vaccine program that this year will murder children.

03:20.421 --> 03:21.261
That's a fact.

03:21.421 --> 03:25.103
There will be children who will lose their lives this year to the vaccine program.

03:25.583 --> 03:35.207
They would have had an otherwise totally normal life, could have gone on to become president of the United States or a future scientist with some great new breakthrough.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.709
They will not be here because of this vaccine program.

03:39.309 --> 03:43.030
Other children will suffer paralysis.

03:43.731 --> 03:46.612
Some will have their brains damaged permanently for life.

03:47.885 --> 03:52.347
And recently, I've been asking this question of some fairly high up officials.

03:53.127 --> 03:56.708
And what I say is, how is that where we're settled?

03:57.028 --> 04:01.370
And they say, well, science has determined that that's an acceptable casualty.

04:01.910 --> 04:07.532
We have an accepted casualty in order to reach herd immunity in the United States of America.

04:08.112 --> 04:11.653
And so I follow that statement with my own question, which is,

04:14.659 --> 04:20.741
Please tell me how many children exactly are going to die this year from our vaccine program.

04:21.521 --> 04:28.843
Could you please tell me exactly how many children's minds will be ruined for their lives or be paralyzed?

04:30.043 --> 04:35.905
And the answer you get from the mainstream medical community is we don't have the data on that.

04:37.705 --> 04:40.386
So how do we have an acceptable casualty?

04:41.300 --> 04:42.980
if we don't know what number we're accepting.

04:44.181 --> 04:48.361
I think that's the beginning of the first question anybody should be asking right now.

04:49.121 --> 05:07.605
So when we live in a nation that says that vaccines are safe and effective, which actually flies in the face of the highest court in the land right here in this town, the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2011, made the official statement vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

05:08.595 --> 05:19.660
I would like to know how the medical community stands in direct opposition to that statement made by the highest court in the land and repeats constantly, vaccines are safe and effective.

05:20.180 --> 05:38.068
That duality inside this nation between our medical establishment and the highest court in the land should be the beginning of a question that allows us to have true conversation, open conversation about the science of vaccines.

05:38.587 --> 05:39.307
Stop lying!

05:39.367 --> 05:44.709
If we cannot question science, then it is no longer science.

05:45.710 --> 05:46.770
It has become a religion.

05:48.031 --> 05:55.874
And much of the way this situation is addressed, this medicine is addressed, this vaccine program is addressed, is like a religion.

05:56.654 --> 05:59.295
If you question it, you are a heretic.

06:00.775 --> 06:01.436
Stop lying!

06:01.456 --> 06:07.778
If you question why there's a duality between the Supreme Court and the medical establishment, you're a heretic.

06:09.983 --> 06:12.385
We are the greatest nation in the world.

06:12.985 --> 06:15.006
We have the greatest scientists in the world.

06:15.506 --> 06:23.271
We can do better.

06:24.032 --> 06:25.693
We must do better.

06:26.873 --> 06:37.260
And for any scientist that wants to say they have settled at a place where innocent children's lives will be destroyed, I say, please, step out of the way.

06:37.884 --> 06:52.028
and let the future scientists come in and figure out a way to create immunity in our children, health in our children, that is safe and effective for every single child in this nation and around the world.

06:52.949 --> 06:54.289
Follow the rules.

06:54.309 --> 06:56.010
Protect yourself at all times.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.210
Follow my instructions.

06:57.270 --> 06:58.150
Keep it clean.

06:58.190 --> 06:58.971
Touch gloves if you wish.

06:59.251 --> 06:59.671
Let's do it.

07:01.027 --> 07:01.828
Sweaty palms.

07:02.068 --> 07:03.569
This is so crazy.

07:04.389 --> 07:05.230
Like goosebumps.

07:06.111 --> 07:07.211
This is so crazy.

07:07.432 --> 07:09.293
I feel so nervous.

07:09.353 --> 07:10.534
Like, what in the world, man?

07:15.186 --> 07:17.669
I'm not sure exactly what he is saying.

07:17.849 --> 07:19.671
I'm not sure exactly what he is saying.

07:19.691 --> 07:21.654
I'm not sure exactly what he is saying.

07:32.406 --> 07:33.807
Thank you very much.

07:33.847 --> 07:34.127
Thank you.

07:57.677 --> 08:00.818
just it's literally turning into worst case scenario.

08:01.619 --> 08:11.743
And I'll tell you, there's a very, very clear reason why that will be is because the, the medical infrastructure will become overwhelmed.

08:12.243 --> 08:12.523
Okay.

08:12.683 --> 08:24.467
And there's only so many ICU beds that are going to be able to intubate, uh, someone and give, uh, um, yeah, yeah.

08:25.568 --> 08:25.668
And,

08:26.522 --> 08:42.173
Right now, and I'll tell you this, the whole concept that there'll be a neural element to it, it's not going to get on their radar because they're just going to be swamped by the numbers that are just showing the pneumonia.

08:42.673 --> 08:47.837
I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked.

08:48.137 --> 08:55.122
And I should point out that actually we are, in an interesting sense, a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar.

08:55.874 --> 08:59.216
So if I'm correct, you, Robert, have had COVID.

08:59.517 --> 09:02.299
I've had COVID and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna.

09:02.519 --> 09:02.859
All right.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.921
Steve, you have been vaccinated.

09:06.882 --> 09:08.203
Fully vaccinated with Moderna.

09:08.483 --> 09:08.803
All right.

09:09.004 --> 09:12.166
I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin.

09:12.506 --> 09:24.315
And the data actually, shocking as this will be to some people, the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting COVID when taken properly.

09:24.875 --> 09:46.912
So aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't real, and I have every reason to think it was, it certainly appears to be the genuine article, I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity, where through three different routes, COVID, vaccine, and ivermectin, we are protected.

09:46.932 --> 09:47.673
And you are- That's fair.

09:47.853 --> 09:48.553
Doubly protected.

09:48.573 --> 09:52.957
So I would- There's no way to rule out that

09:53.868 --> 09:56.870
somebody didn't let this puppy loose intentionally.

09:57.790 --> 10:06.135
And who would have let, who would want to let loose an agent in the literally beating industrial heart of China?

10:08.276 --> 10:10.277
I doubt it was the People's Republic of China.

10:11.158 --> 10:19.262
So I can't resolve, you know, these different potential ways that this agent could have gotten loose.

10:19.722 --> 10:22.684
But the Furing-Cleavage site and some of the other sites,

10:23.368 --> 10:34.178
whether or not there's an HIV sequence in there, it looks an awful lot like something that came out of laboratory research.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.763
But in a sense, it kind of doesn't matter, because here we are.

10:39.783 --> 10:41.205
It's gone worldwide.

10:41.245 --> 10:41.605
It's actually J.J.

10:41.625 --> 10:47.971
Cohen's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

10:48.827 --> 11:03.914
And I also now know that our friend Jonathan Cooey, who some of you will know from his lab leak series early in the pandemic called JC on a Bike, Journal Club on a Bike, that he also has advanced a version of this hypothesis.

11:03.934 --> 11:05.295
So I don't claim it to be unique.

11:05.435 --> 11:07.316
I do think I arrived at it independently.

11:07.336 --> 11:09.457
It's now just come right back up.

11:09.497 --> 11:12.298
So I want to catch people up and then I want you to pick up your explanation.

11:12.758 --> 11:13.278
So what I argued,

11:14.819 --> 11:21.285
I believe I came up with this independently, but I believe Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar, as has Jonathan Cooey.

11:22.346 --> 11:24.108
Well, maybe it wasn't a lab leak.

11:24.128 --> 11:25.009
Maybe it was deliberate.

11:25.029 --> 11:26.490
That's one thing you have to consider.

11:26.510 --> 11:29.032
But the other thing is, you just look at the genome.

11:29.693 --> 11:33.356
There are so many different things that have been changed.

11:33.396 --> 11:37.160
There's at least a dozen things in that genome that are very odd.

11:38.106 --> 11:43.568
and that cause specific medical problems.

11:44.369 --> 11:55.094
So there are things in that genome that are there to impact your immune system, you know, and make it harder for you to fight off the infection.

11:55.834 --> 12:03.858
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario, which is we're dealing with actual assaults on the prion protein.

12:04.198 --> 12:06.799
And then you get into the domain of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.

12:08.036 --> 12:09.918
I'm not sure exactly who he is.

12:10.018 --> 12:11.399
His name is J.J.

12:11.560 --> 12:18.086
Cooey, and I believe he's a consultant for C.H.D., and I believe he has a Ph.D.

12:18.206 --> 12:22.930
in some sort of scientific discipline, from what I understand.

12:25.680 --> 12:44.197
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

12:45.345 --> 12:49.346
Your latest video with Paul was amazing, JJ.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.126
Wow, that's a very nice compliment.

12:51.166 --> 12:51.827
Thank you very much.

12:51.867 --> 12:53.087
Can you hear me better now or not?

12:53.407 --> 12:54.307
Yes, much better.

12:55.047 --> 13:03.489
It was really like, it nailed down two things for me, but I finally really understand the infectious clone idea.

13:03.789 --> 13:07.350
And I think it's very, very likely what happened.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.071
It aligns so well.

13:09.811 --> 13:10.551
The gigaspiral.

13:10.936 --> 13:25.210
has gone, the weed has taken, the hyper-association induced by excess THC intoxication has led to a state of, how should we say, hyper-connection

13:26.024 --> 13:29.767
Vigilance right that this is this this is this this is this and this connects to this right?

13:29.867 --> 13:39.414
and so he's taking you know, it's a complex series of variables that you're having to deal with and like say he's Because he's such a slimy little shit.

13:39.774 --> 13:54.225
He's skinny Barzoom skinny Barzoom skinny Barzoom that the He was courting the no virus people and He thought they turned around and shit on him too, right?

13:54.245 --> 13:54.886
No one likes him

13:55.748 --> 13:59.438
definitely right as as how should we say hi and

14:02.887 --> 14:15.273
Intemperate as I come across on the internet and I have people clutching their pearls, I'm actually far, far easier to get along with than Gigaspiral.

14:15.333 --> 14:18.775
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

14:18.995 --> 14:19.455
It can't.

14:20.095 --> 14:23.857
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

14:23.877 --> 14:28.859
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

14:31.067 --> 14:34.349
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

14:34.589 --> 14:35.049
It can't.

14:35.690 --> 14:39.412
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore because it's clear.

14:39.432 --> 14:44.455
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

14:52.074 --> 15:05.525
And then there are people who have inspired a lot of thought for me, people like JJ Cooey, you know, who's regarded by a few people as, by some people as sort of this kind of

15:07.185 --> 15:14.168
savant or idiot or something whose ideas are just too terrible and too incompatible with the biology that they learnt.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.869
And in many ways they are.

15:16.549 --> 15:20.151
But that's throwing baby out of the bath water.

15:20.591 --> 15:28.215
I mean the best thinkers in the world all fall through and suffer through the consequences of ten bad ideas for every good one.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.176
The best creative thinkers.

15:31.176 --> 15:45.209
And so if you're going to jump on every one of the ideas that a person comes up with that you don't disagree with, that you don't agree with, and use that as a bar to smear the person, I think that's just, you're never going to get ahead in the world yourself.

15:45.730 --> 15:49.053
You won't find the muses, the creative inspiration.

15:49.853 --> 15:53.517
So I certainly think that JJ Cooley's overall take is very good.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.805
But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

16:36.607 --> 16:37.308
And I have lied.

16:37.328 --> 16:38.369
I'm sure I'll lie again.

16:38.389 --> 16:39.330
I don't want to lie.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.152
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

16:41.272 --> 16:42.293
I try not to be a liar.

16:42.313 --> 16:43.174
I don't want to be a liar.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.458
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

16:55.535 --> 16:57.076
I think truth is good for kids.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.357
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

17:01.817 --> 17:04.178
We want everybody to feel good.

17:04.378 --> 17:05.559
That's not the way life is.

17:05.699 --> 17:15.823
I don't care how you get there.

17:15.843 --> 17:18.504
I don't care what you do to get there.

17:18.524 --> 17:21.145
The goal is to win.

17:25.846 --> 17:26.750
What time is it?

17:26.830 --> 17:27.533
Game time!

17:32.011 --> 17:34.672
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

17:34.692 --> 17:36.533
I hope you enjoyed that introduction.

17:37.574 --> 17:39.915
We lost wrestling legend Hulk Hogan.

17:40.995 --> 17:42.736
I hope I didn't have anything to do with that.

17:42.796 --> 17:50.120
Boy, I hope mentioning him and his connection to Peter Thiel and his connection to, why isn't that playing?

17:51.280 --> 17:55.523
I may need to briefly escape here and restart.

17:57.123 --> 17:57.924
That should be better.

17:58.864 --> 18:06.768
Yes, so we lost this wrestling legend who actually also showed up at the Republican National Convention.

18:07.328 --> 18:10.910
Trump was announced, or J.D.

18:10.950 --> 18:12.270
Vance was announced by him.

18:13.591 --> 18:21.495
Isn't it wonderful to now realize that he owed Peter Thiel's lawyers about $25 million?

18:21.535 --> 18:26.257
Probably some of the same lawyers that have been helping Donald Trump out of some of his worst messes in the last few years.

18:27.017 --> 18:28.659
Ladies and gentlemen, it's all one big show.

18:28.699 --> 18:30.480
I think we can start to really connect things.

18:31.541 --> 18:36.985
Like I said, I hope Hulk Hogan didn't meet his demise because we exposed him as a witness to this.

18:37.005 --> 18:43.310
It is definitely true that we need to get ourselves and our kids off of social media.

18:44.691 --> 18:52.536
And so it is with great urgency that I suggest that we start teaching our kids that this is ruled by podcast.

18:53.296 --> 18:59.059
And if we allow this to keep going, we may not be able to turn the ship around anymore.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.263
That's indeed what this slide is all about.

19:06.744 --> 19:12.347
I'm trying to get the word out there that we need to teach our children what they're doing on these waves.

19:13.513 --> 19:15.294
before we send them out into the real ocean.

19:17.715 --> 19:21.116
Maybe even the social media that they're on while they're in high school needs help.

19:22.617 --> 19:29.580
Certainly they are all on Robert Malone's dumb script with regard to the virus and with regard to vaccines.

19:29.620 --> 19:42.606
I'm not saying Robert Malone is the script writer for Israel or for any other types of international relations, but the biology script that these people have been on, specifically on this screen,

19:43.789 --> 19:48.631
are people who've been following a script of Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

19:49.412 --> 19:50.812
I have very little doubt in that.

19:50.872 --> 19:56.275
That's because one of the guys on this screen actually told me to stop talking about Robert Malone a couple, two, three times.

19:57.415 --> 20:07.560
Another one of these guys on the screen paid me for about a year and a half to be a scientific advisor, where I had the opportunity to teach him a lot of the biology that I've been teaching here and teaching you.

20:08.260 --> 20:10.682
And unfortunately, he didn't take well to my coaching.

20:12.403 --> 20:13.104
And that's a pity.

20:13.624 --> 20:17.527
But that is because he was put in place a long time ago to curinate this narrative.

20:18.008 --> 20:21.250
He was put in place a long time ago, not even knowing how he would be used.

20:21.270 --> 20:28.996
He thought he would be, you know, eventually a vice presidential candidate that might or might not get absorbed into one of the leading tickets.

20:29.516 --> 20:30.697
He did a lot wrong.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.799
Boy, oh boy, did we do a lot wrong.

20:32.859 --> 20:34.160
You can tell someone's lying.

20:35.586 --> 20:44.862
I had a problem because, you know, they tried to provide me with the script too, and they really wanted me to follow along with the script too, and have had I followed along with the script,

20:46.690 --> 20:57.133
Well, I kind of believe that I might be a Brownstone fellow, or maybe still working for CHD, but I did not follow the script like these people did.

20:58.314 --> 20:59.734
And I didn't sign at the line.

21:01.195 --> 21:05.756
I'm not part of this Scooby-Doo, the ghost of health freedom.

21:07.077 --> 21:09.077
I've been staying focused on the biology lately.

21:09.097 --> 21:12.559
I haven't been taking the bait on social media, and I have been loving my neighbors.

21:15.069 --> 21:18.051
The ghost of health freedom is continuing, though.

21:19.231 --> 21:23.774
The ghost of health freedom, of course, is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

21:24.054 --> 21:28.796
and the Barrington Declaration with Jayant Bhattacharya.

21:28.856 --> 21:31.898
It's with that little child, Vinay Prasad.

21:31.918 --> 21:43.204
And it is also with the UK citizen and foreign agents from Turkey, like Dr. Oz, like Marty McCary.

21:46.789 --> 21:50.711
The reason why I'm excited, ladies and gentlemen, let me just pop myself down here on the bottom.

21:51.871 --> 21:54.512
The reason why that I'm very excited, welcome to the show.

21:54.532 --> 21:55.733
Hi, my name is Jonathan Couey.

21:56.293 --> 22:02.656
I'm coming to you live from GigaOM Biological Headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

22:03.336 --> 22:08.059
And it's a pretty severe message that I have for you today.

22:08.079 --> 22:15.382
It is a pretty intense message because I do think that this whole big show,

22:16.397 --> 22:31.568
The Human Genome Project and all of its wonder, the rollout of AI, the talking about climate change, the nuclear weapons, nuclear war and the threat of total global destruction.

22:31.628 --> 22:40.055
This stuff is all out there as a complex web of mythologies to make sure that you don't understand the very basics.

22:41.405 --> 22:53.893
of your own biology and don't understand that intramuscular injection, never come to realize that intramuscular injection is actually just a dumb idea from the late 1800s, back when people used morphine a lot.

22:56.374 --> 23:00.877
And I have evidence on my desk beyond refute at this stage.

23:01.937 --> 23:03.859
It is beyond refute.

23:04.795 --> 23:26.522
This book and two other books that I have PDFs of will definitively demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that intramuscular injection is a dumb idea that remains a really bad remnant in our healthcare system, in our healthcare principles, in our healthcare methodology toolbox.

23:27.682 --> 23:46.543
And it originates from the late 1800s, where wide adoption of this methodology as a new found, let's say, universal methodology for a wide variety of medical applications.

23:46.704 --> 23:48.606
And it is the hypodermic needle.

23:50.461 --> 23:53.722
Now, the hypodermic needle needs to be understood for what it is.

23:54.362 --> 23:57.983
The hypodermic needle only does what the user does with it.

23:58.843 --> 24:06.146
Just like a pistol, a pistol's only dangerous if you have somebody in your house that likes to point it at you a lot.

24:07.746 --> 24:14.368
A pistol's only dangerous if it's loaded and the trigger is pulled when its muzzle is pointed at something you didn't mean to destroy.

24:16.847 --> 24:30.078
And a hypodermic needle could have many potential uses with regard to putting fluid where you want it to be in a precise location, in a precise concentration, in a precise volume.

24:30.118 --> 24:34.662
And there's no doubt that in theory, that methodology could be very useful.

24:37.244 --> 24:42.848
Just like a rifle could be very useful for small game hunting, for large game hunting.

24:44.113 --> 24:57.145
A large caliber .45 caliber mountain gun could also be useful for home defense, but it would be terrible for the disciplining of your children.

24:59.947 --> 25:07.574
It would be terrible if you put those bullets into your car or into your television set when you were completely angry about the football game.

25:10.191 --> 25:37.120
And so the reality is, ladies and gentlemen, that there's the elaborate hoax, this Maha movement that metamorphed from a shitty anti-vax movement headed by Brian Hooker and Suzanne Humphries and, oh my gosh, I can't even come up with all these awful names, and James Lyons Weiler and Paul Thomas and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass.

25:38.649 --> 25:59.885
These people were all put in place to make sure you'd never realize that intramuscular injection, the use of a hypodermic needle to put a combination of substances into the muscle of a healthy human is one of the dumbest ideas we've ever had in medicine.

25:59.905 --> 26:03.687
And it originates back to the late 1800s.

26:04.808 --> 26:06.970
And we have been spellbound by it ever since.

26:08.860 --> 26:29.888
And it is very possible that many of the people in the Maha movement with MDs and PhDs and MSPs after their name, masters in public health, MPHs after their name, they all don't understand because it's a little bit like lemmings.

26:29.968 --> 26:32.189
It's actually possible that it's not evil.

26:34.093 --> 26:39.355
It's actually possible that there are people behind the scenes that are pushing the cart forward that are evil.

26:39.795 --> 26:43.477
But the vast majority of people don't even understand why the cart is moving.

26:45.497 --> 26:47.778
They just know that they don't want to fall off of it.

26:48.839 --> 26:54.201
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to be overly dramatic, but we can end this.

26:55.161 --> 26:57.142
Because our children can understand that.

26:58.882 --> 27:00.703
The history is understandable.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.764
The context is perfect.

27:06.144 --> 27:14.327
And so I think what's most spectacular is that we've also pushed the envelope of what we can call a myth, and we have remained unchecked.

27:15.307 --> 27:17.308
We have remained unchallenged.

27:17.788 --> 27:30.093
The autism spectrum disorder is a mythology which disguises intramuscular injection as some kind of flawed medical methodology instead of just something that is plain stupid.

27:31.647 --> 27:50.677
Keep in mind, I'm using as precise of language as possible for you to understand that a hypodermic needle to deliver a certain combination of substances to your skin or to a certain cavity in your body might actually be a very, very useful application for a hypodermic needle.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.460
I am saying that intramuscular injection is not one of them.

27:58.496 --> 28:02.441
And I'm saying that that's why we have a fake health freedom movement in America.

28:02.942 --> 28:12.934
If you wanna be notified when my family gets back in a week and a half, please send an email to gigaohmhq at proton.me and we'll get on that right away.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.055
You're not probably getting...

28:14.996 --> 28:21.101
notifications right now because I'm allowing my wife to enjoy vacation, which is why you go on vacation in the first place.

28:21.601 --> 28:25.384
And I'm not sending those because it takes me long enough just to get the thing going.

28:25.544 --> 28:28.786
And so you might think, oh yeah, but then you could just send an email.

28:28.826 --> 28:29.927
No, it's just one more thing.

28:31.219 --> 28:34.363
I gotta do, and so we're just not doing that, and that's the way it is.

28:34.904 --> 28:41.713
It's a one-man show, and I mean a one-man, two-dog, six-chicken show right now, so it's pretty hectic around here.

28:42.634 --> 28:43.415
Listen carefully.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.281
They still talk about making us the 51st state.

28:48.401 --> 28:54.027
So maybe I just went north to find my- In case you don't remember, this is Angela Rasmussen.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.708
I believe she's formerly of Georgetown.

28:55.748 --> 29:02.615
Now she works at Saskatchewan or the University of Saskatchewan at a virology center or it's a vaccine research center.

29:02.635 --> 29:03.176
I don't know which.

29:04.383 --> 29:15.332
Remember that this woman was scripted at the beginning of the pandemic to push natural leak or natural virus coming from a bat cave.

29:15.932 --> 29:17.414
Lab leak would be ridiculous.

29:18.555 --> 29:27.142
More importantly, Kevin McCairn actually had lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of love for this lady.

29:28.162 --> 29:32.224
He made meme after meme after meme and talked about her all the time.

29:32.924 --> 29:45.570
I think he kind of fantasized about her to be honest anyway she's on twiv which is hilarious because Actually, it's not that hilarious because they all work for the same people if you watch this this

29:46.826 --> 29:52.132
this whole interview you will be shocked at how many people they actually worked with at the same time.

29:52.692 --> 30:00.841
This is a very small team of scripted shitheads and that's why this scripted shithead needed to be shipped up to Canada.

30:02.002 --> 30:03.224
Myself still in the US.

30:05.754 --> 30:13.220
All right, so Tryon wants to know how you can prevent accidental intravenous injection of mRNA vaccines, right?

30:13.240 --> 30:21.906
Because there's this, do you believe that some people who get myocarditis, it's because the vaccine was accidentally put in a vessel?

30:22.227 --> 30:28.972
Okay, so now you have the crossing of narratives, which I think is very important for you to understand the exact

30:30.305 --> 30:47.639
coordinates of it because a member of the Steve Kirsch steering committee and a member of Panda, a French guy by the name of Marc Giraudeau, who is a former like process engineer somewhere for a car company or some other thing.

30:47.699 --> 30:48.020
I don't know.

30:48.060 --> 30:49.261
He worked in a bunch of places.

30:49.761 --> 30:54.065
He's, he's a real egomaniac because he believes that all

30:55.518 --> 31:02.847
injection injuries can be explained because they miss the muscle and they hit a vein.

31:03.889 --> 31:12.119
And when they hit a vein, then all kinds of crazy stuff happens, including the fact that the mRNA could go to the heart or something.

31:14.642 --> 31:18.607
uses examples from people who are injecting testosterone.

31:18.647 --> 31:22.691
He uses examples of like little balls falling down the stairs.

31:23.312 --> 31:26.435
He is a scripted fool.

31:26.916 --> 31:31.301
And because he is on the Steve Kerr steering committee and also plays

31:31.901 --> 31:38.789
a daily role in Panda for like four years, and is also promoted by both of those groups over the last four years.

31:39.129 --> 31:46.217
He was almost on Bret Weinstein, but I told Bret Weinstein if he had him on his show, then he would be admitting that he's entirely scripted.

31:46.677 --> 31:50.001
But of course, we know now that Bret Weinstein is entirely scripted.

31:50.021 --> 31:53.825
I was naive back then, thinking that Bret was just not listening to me.

31:55.347 --> 32:04.971
No, Marc Genedeau is a scripted fool that has been on a lot of podcasts, probably has a book, although I'm not aware of it and I'm not gonna suggest you look for it.

32:06.452 --> 32:16.276
But he's been on John Campbell's program before, he's been on Doc Malek before, he's been on all the podcasts, and now they're actually talking about his theory.

32:16.996 --> 32:20.318
These two super clown virologists.

32:21.297 --> 32:36.363
This guy is the guy who supposedly invented the infectious clone with David Baltimore, you know, transfecting cell cultures with the purported sequence of a virus and getting more virus.

32:36.743 --> 32:40.005
It's like it's infectious man, infectious clones.

32:40.785 --> 32:41.625
They invented that.

32:41.965 --> 32:42.746
He invented it.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.787
They shared postdoc advisors.

32:46.877 --> 32:53.359
And now they are doing the other half of the theater that Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

32:53.379 --> 32:54.619
do the other half of.

32:56.779 --> 33:00.540
Because these three, these two would get along great with Paul Offit, for example.

33:01.921 --> 33:05.161
I've never seen any evidence that suggests that.

33:05.342 --> 33:10.823
So, I mean, no, I'd have to see some evidence that did suggest that.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.484
As far as avoiding, like, accidental IV injection, though,

33:15.936 --> 33:18.537
I'm not a clinician, I could tell you how to do it on a mouse's tail.

33:18.557 --> 33:23.278
But, you know, I don't know how you could avoid that.

33:23.378 --> 33:27.720
I think the biggest, I actually don't think that would be that big of a risk though.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.001
Now here's what I think is most revealing about this.

33:32.401 --> 33:38.043
I think that these scripted traders are scripted in a very compartmentalized way.

33:38.843 --> 33:44.265
I think they are very limited in their understanding of what Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:44.285 --> 33:44.885
have been doing.

33:45.525 --> 33:50.647
over the last years, I think they're very limited because their script is the other side.

33:50.687 --> 33:52.388
And so they have a lot of details there.

33:53.008 --> 33:55.629
And that's what also gives them confidence that they're right.

33:56.269 --> 34:07.354
And so the less they know about the other side, the less sophistication they have about the details that are walked by the other side, the easier it is for them to just kind of feign like they really don't get it.

34:07.374 --> 34:10.675
It doesn't really make much sense to me because I already understand everything.

34:11.275 --> 34:20.900
And so what you see here, after six years of this show, is how, indeed, compartmentalized even the actual actors are.

34:21.300 --> 34:24.221
And that's what makes the theater so damn convincing.

34:24.862 --> 34:29.004
Robert Malone is never going to sit down at a table with these guys and drink.

34:31.505 --> 34:37.308
But he's traveled the world with the people on his side, like Meryl Ness and Jessica Rose and Pierre Cory.

34:38.252 --> 34:48.222
They've all been, you know, in foreign hotels together and had breakfast together while she has eaten and worked with these other people.

34:50.124 --> 34:59.454
You know, like maybe Topol at Scripps or Anderson or those kinds of people would all be glad to meet her up in Canada and have dinner.

35:00.987 --> 35:11.610
And so both sides need to have script writing and script curating members, which understand the direction that they're supposed to hold.

35:12.050 --> 35:23.694
And they don't necessarily have to understand how that direction relates to the directions that other people are supposed to hold in order to maintain this really malevolent script.

35:25.319 --> 35:30.881
I mean, I've never accidentally IV injected like an animal when giving an intramuscular injection.

35:30.901 --> 35:45.525
So, you know, for a while, so she's never entered, injected an animal intravenously when she was trying to give intramuscular because she doesn't know, but she says that because she believes it.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.975
You know, like you could know with a mouse.

35:48.216 --> 35:54.321
I mean, it's remarkable, but this is the level of sophistication that these people actually have.

35:54.361 --> 36:02.748
And that I now understand is probably crucial to the stability of this pattern in the lemmings.

36:02.829 --> 36:03.589
And that's what it is.

36:03.629 --> 36:04.970
It's a pattern in the lemmings.

36:05.751 --> 36:10.956
And the stability has to do with the same stability that that swarm of birds does.

36:10.976 --> 36:13.378
You know, it's not really due to just one bird.

36:14.807 --> 36:19.612
It's like every fifth or sixth bird has to be on a certain page.

36:19.672 --> 36:21.714
Otherwise it's not gonna go in that direction.

36:21.774 --> 36:22.895
It's gonna go somewhere else.

36:23.936 --> 36:35.488
And so right now we're in a flock of birds where we don't even realize that we could choose to fly another direction and we would leave like five birds behind.

36:36.476 --> 36:45.278
There would be like 20 birds over here still flying around the lab leak and still talking about Maha and whether Maha needs to be held together or not.

36:45.338 --> 36:53.499
And we would have all flown away already and just accepted the fact that intramuscular injections, a dumb idea.

36:53.519 --> 36:55.260
So I don't even know why we're arguing about it.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.780
I don't know why there's a vaccine schedule in the first place.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.241
I don't know why there's an ACIP.

37:00.341 --> 37:02.061
I don't know why we have a prep act.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.101
But we're not there yet.

37:06.181 --> 37:08.263
We're not ready to fly away, but we could.

37:09.584 --> 37:19.634
Because right now the illusion of the flock is being sustained by planted individuals whose contact with everyone else is artificially created.

37:22.056 --> 37:28.122
I mean, this would end in a matter of weeks if I could reach the number of people that are reached by these people.

37:29.731 --> 37:35.914
There were some people were pulling back on the on the needle before putting The vaccine and just to make sure you're not in it.

37:35.934 --> 37:37.135
So don't forget right?

37:37.835 --> 37:46.820
Campbell did like three shows about aspirating the needle Before he talked to Mark Girodeau about it.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.121
This is crucial to understand.

37:49.601 --> 37:58.126
This is not by accident This is by script by national security script that they are asking the same stupid questions

37:59.130 --> 38:03.111
vessel, but Daniel said that that is not really necessary, so.

38:04.172 --> 38:19.197
Yeah, I mean, I guess I just don't know that much about it because I've only really given ever injections to mice, but it doesn't, you know, we have like an 80-year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection, and this is never going to happen.

38:25.302 --> 38:29.743
We have an 80.

38:29.783 --> 38:30.283
We have an 80.

38:32.783 --> 38:46.546
Yeah, I mean, I guess I just don't know that much about it because I've only really given ever injections to mice, but it doesn't, you know, we have like an 80 year history of giving vaccines by intramuscular injection.

38:46.606 --> 38:48.986
And this has never been a problem for any other vaccine.

38:49.026 --> 38:49.666
And I just don't.

38:49.886 --> 38:54.367
So is it possible for you to consider the idea that she just doesn't know?

38:55.967 --> 39:06.416
that she just has read it, she's been told it, Paul Offit told her, when she met Tony Fauci, he said it, they all say it, you know, every time she looks it up, that's what the book says.

39:07.517 --> 39:12.121
We have an 80 year history, goes back to polio or something.

39:12.181 --> 39:13.522
Isn't there a guy named Salk?

39:13.602 --> 39:14.683
I think that's how it went.

39:17.816 --> 39:31.221
Is it possible that she, you know, in her admission that she doesn't really know very much because she's not a clinician, that she's just never really thought that in depth about how the human body and the human immune system works?

39:32.859 --> 39:46.984
what role it might play with interacting with our microbiome in our gut and the microbiome on our skin, and how that irreducibly complex symphony might be, you know, screwed up if we were to just squirt stuff into our muscle.

39:47.424 --> 39:51.466
It's really remarkable that you can hear it.

39:51.526 --> 39:52.426
They don't know.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.967
It's not evil, ladies and gentlemen.

39:56.007 --> 39:57.868
It's not a depopulation plan.

39:59.670 --> 40:05.735
The vast majority of the people that are involved in this are too unsophisticated to understand.

40:06.336 --> 40:10.819
They're just trying to stay on their surfboard and not get pounded into the coral.

40:14.022 --> 40:16.124
See why it would be for these vaccines.

40:18.986 --> 40:21.588
I don't know why it would be for these vaccines.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.611
So you see, they are still trapped.

40:24.691 --> 40:25.592
It's possible.

40:26.373 --> 40:27.654
No, maybe not her.

40:28.459 --> 40:42.975
But a lot of other people are as a result of these two performing so flawlessly, using the term vaccine as if it is a proven thing, as if a demonstrated thing that has a very specific definition.

40:44.037 --> 40:47.681
You know, like back in the nineties when they started calling uterine cancer AIDS.

40:49.073 --> 40:53.156
You know, because anything that you get when you're positive becomes AIDS.

40:53.296 --> 40:54.276
So it could be anything.

40:54.757 --> 40:59.179
Anything when you're positive for the antibodies could potentially be caused by the AIDS.

41:02.602 --> 41:04.002
Ladies and gentlemen, we are there.

41:05.243 --> 41:06.144
We can break this.

41:07.525 --> 41:12.168
Because they are admitting that their depth of understanding is so limited

41:13.228 --> 41:16.550
Their ability to explain this in detail is so limited.

41:17.391 --> 41:19.392
That's why Robert Malone exists.

41:19.452 --> 41:21.333
That's why Kevin McKernan exists.

41:21.393 --> 41:23.595
That's why David Baltimore is still running.

41:24.075 --> 41:26.076
That's why this guy's still running around.

41:27.797 --> 41:33.321
Because they must maintain an illusion of certainty, just like Paul Offit does.

41:33.641 --> 41:41.626
They must maintain this illusion of certainty, even though they don't, I don't know, I guess we've been given intramuscular injections for like 80 years and it's been fine.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.046
That's all she's got to say.

41:47.008 --> 42:01.427
Now, understand that over the last six years, I went from giving all my kids, all the shots to thinking that CHD and Brian Hooker were fighting for justice for those few unfortunate people that were injured by the shots because my kids weren't hurt by them.

42:04.230 --> 42:21.724
and that some or all of the autism is... I already understood that a lot of autism isn't caused by vaccines because we study a lot of shit in neuroscience that we call autism and autism spectrum that's definitely not related to vaccines as I understood it then.

42:21.764 --> 42:25.487
Then I moved farther and farther and farther until I finally got to the point

42:26.047 --> 42:30.188
where I could say that intramuscular injection actually is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

42:30.248 --> 42:39.090
It's probably a really bad idea to inject something intramuscularly, a combination of substances, with the idea that you could augment an immune system.

42:39.130 --> 42:39.790
That's ridiculous.

42:39.830 --> 42:41.191
It's not organized that way.

42:43.591 --> 42:53.814
And then I found out that there were people like Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark who were saying it exactly like that at the same time when somebody like Suzanne Humphreys decided to publish a book.

42:54.730 --> 42:58.453
and say it kinda like that on the same stages as them.

42:58.973 --> 43:01.496
And then at the start of the pandemic, those two were dead.

43:01.896 --> 43:22.853
And all of these people have risen through social media ranks to become financially stable, independent, whatever, to make money, to be rewarded for staying on the same script that Del Bigtree has been on since probably 2015 or so.

43:24.824 --> 43:35.510
I guess 14, when supposedly the first time the CDC exposed itself as being a shitty organization or something, you got to listen to that again, and we will.

43:38.432 --> 43:43.855
Christina says, I was going to ask who is funding Ebola research, but if you have security clearance, I guess that answers my question.

43:45.188 --> 43:45.748
Not really.

43:46.389 --> 43:49.910
I've had Ebola funding from NIH, from NIAID.

43:50.371 --> 43:54.973
I've had it from DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

43:55.413 --> 43:58.115
I've had it from DITRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

43:58.395 --> 44:04.418
And I got a good score and hopefully I'll get it from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

44:04.538 --> 44:14.823
So she's been funded by DITRA because, you know, DITRA is funny because Robert Malone's best friend who used to sleep on his couch, David Holm, that guy's actually the head of DITRA, Australian dude.

44:16.409 --> 44:24.755
And, uh, Robert Malone told, uh, told Steven Hadfield on the Tommy podcast a couple of years ago that he was vetted to be head of U S Ameritrade, where.

44:25.276 --> 44:28.557
an Iranian guy by the name of Sina Bavari is the head.

44:28.617 --> 44:38.479
And he wrote a paper in 2019 with the last postdoc of, of, of Ralph Baric, um, Alison Totura, she was on Jeopardy.

44:39.219 --> 44:48.001
Um, anyway, Alison Totura and Sina Bavari wrote a paper about how there might be a bat cave coronavirus and, and remdesivir might really be really good for it.

44:49.002 --> 44:50.202
And so then working with,

44:50.751 --> 45:00.512
Dave Hone and David Hone and DITRA at the start of the pandemic on some program called Domain, Robert Malone was able to use AI and

45:00.990 --> 45:22.066
computer-aided crystallography of viral proteins and AI-aided scanning of all the pharmaceuticals in the FDA catalog to identify remdesivir, famotidine, silicoxib, and one other drug as potentially useful, ivermectin.

45:23.246 --> 45:25.908
I mean, you can't make this up.

45:25.988 --> 45:29.111
This is all one malevolent script.

45:30.646 --> 45:38.409
And that's why The Twiv did an interview with Peter Daszak about six months before the pandemic started.

45:41.710 --> 45:43.230
It's all one malevolent show.

45:43.290 --> 45:46.331
It's all one malevolent script with a bunch of state actors.

45:46.571 --> 45:47.431
She's one of them.

45:47.511 --> 45:48.272
He's one of them.

45:48.652 --> 45:49.852
Malone is one of them.

45:50.392 --> 45:51.733
McKernan is one of them.

45:52.393 --> 45:53.573
Rose is one of them.

45:53.973 --> 45:55.174
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:55.234 --> 45:55.874
is one of them.

45:56.894 --> 45:58.255
Meryl Nass is one of them.

45:59.113 --> 46:01.775
Mary Holland is one of them and Brian Hooker is one of them.

46:02.256 --> 46:04.477
Polly Tommy is an agent from the UK.

46:04.958 --> 46:07.180
Andrew Wakefield is an agent from the UK.

46:08.961 --> 46:16.947
These are all scripted frauds, which are out there to make sure that you don't understand that all intramuscular injection is always dumb.

46:22.252 --> 46:23.933
On a future grant application.

46:25.345 --> 46:27.846
But there's a lot of reasons to fund Ebola research.

46:27.926 --> 46:43.111
So I want to make it really clear that the reason I have a... Don't forget that Robert Malone has a security clearance, worked on Ebola, worked on Zika, has spoken in front of the WHO and handed the mic back to Rick Bright in 2011.

46:43.191 --> 46:47.752
These are big players on the world stage of public health.

46:48.512 --> 46:51.013
And the idea is to invert your sovereignty.

46:51.413 --> 46:54.014
The idea was to take a already known

46:54.867 --> 46:59.229
Very shitty vaccine schedule because intramuscular injection is dumb.

47:00.009 --> 47:02.110
And it's a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

47:02.530 --> 47:05.111
The idea was eventually to tell us that.

47:05.851 --> 47:09.272
That this vaccine schedule didn't work as we thought it was.

47:09.352 --> 47:10.853
It was very flawed.

47:11.913 --> 47:18.756
But the new vaccine schedule, which is essentially a personalized one based on transfection, will be better.

47:22.501 --> 47:38.314
That is the plan that this group of traitors is scripted to bring us through, just like the group of scripted traitors that is headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mary Holland, Meryl Nass, you know, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., all these people.

47:39.454 --> 47:40.835
It's the same shitty script.

47:41.923 --> 47:44.626
where eventually we're gonna scratch our heads and say, you know what?

47:44.646 --> 47:49.171
I think the whole vaccine schedule was kind of bad, but lucky we're not doing that anymore.

47:49.191 --> 47:51.874
We're transfecting people and that can be personalized.

47:52.234 --> 47:55.818
There's always room for improvement when you're using mRNA.

48:00.763 --> 48:03.366
Security clearance, and it's not like a top secret.

48:06.892 --> 48:10.593
And so they just need to stick to the provided script.

48:10.633 --> 48:14.394
They do not need to know how their lines fit in with other people.

48:16.255 --> 48:19.216
This video that I showed you in the beginning of this show is from 2017.

48:19.276 --> 48:32.960
You have to understand why it's so malevolent, why it's so gross that Tony Bark was killed in 2020 in the same year and just before Brandy Vaughn was killed.

48:34.130 --> 48:39.772
Why it's gross that that guy served as campaign manager for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:39.812 --> 48:41.173
when he was running for president.

48:41.633 --> 48:43.834
Why it's gross that he's now the head of MAHA.

48:44.354 --> 48:50.017
Why it's gross that he made the Vaxxed movie with two foreign agents, Wakefield and Tommy.

48:52.057 --> 48:55.479
Why it's gross that he talks about his career.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.440
as being six years long.

48:58.500 --> 49:02.461
Why it's gross that he talks about a whistleblower, you know, like the diffuse proposal.

49:03.101 --> 49:07.962
It was something that was leaked to Charles Rixey, and now he's a whistleblower.

49:08.903 --> 49:13.824
If William Thompson is a whistleblower, then he should have been retaliated against against the CDC.

49:14.264 --> 49:18.224
And he should have tried to bring his concerns up the chain of command at the CDC.

49:18.665 --> 49:23.466
If he just comes out of the CDC and leaks some data, then he's not a whistleblower.

49:24.406 --> 49:25.246
He's just a leaker.

49:26.417 --> 49:38.882
And so if he just leaks something out and then Del and Brian start telling stories about it, it's much more likely that they're actually part of the same theater than they are leaking the information for the leaker.

49:40.717 --> 49:48.702
And once you see that Big Tree and Hooker and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:48.762 --> 49:55.186
are not damage control for the CDC leak, they are on the same team as the CDC leak.

49:55.226 --> 50:01.309
The CDC leak is the diffuse proposal of the anti-vax movement.

50:04.811 --> 50:08.974
And so vaxed is Wakefield and Tommy, produced by them.

50:09.861 --> 50:12.922
They own property in America and in the UK.

50:13.462 --> 50:16.223
This is not settled science versus unsettled science.

50:16.283 --> 50:18.884
It's not vaccine science and testing.

50:19.284 --> 50:21.525
He hasn't studied or investigated.

50:21.565 --> 50:22.826
He's just interviewed people.

50:23.706 --> 50:29.368
And now he's telling you a story about individual risk versus societal benefits and unacceptable numbers.

50:29.808 --> 50:33.209
He's talking about herd immunity as an accepted biological concept.

50:33.629 --> 50:38.051
He's talking about unavoidably unsafe being in contrast with safe and effective.

50:40.253 --> 50:45.237
These words aren't the same words that Tony Fauci used in 2020 for nothing.

50:45.918 --> 50:56.247
It's because it's the same shitty script that Kevin McKernan was on at the beginning of the pandemic saying how the FDA was in the way and the 10 page application for an EUA was absurd.

50:57.869 --> 51:02.633
The medical establishment is an enchantment that Dell is casting at this moment.

51:04.226 --> 51:08.629
The medical establishment has some kind of illusion of consensus about vaccines, right?

51:08.649 --> 51:11.370
And we want to break that illusion of consensus, he says.

51:12.231 --> 51:22.236
No, it's all effectively sustaining the illusion of consensus that there are safe vaccines, that we should never give up on the pursuit of safe vaccines.

51:22.617 --> 51:25.658
We can't stop now with an acceptable number of deaths.

51:26.079 --> 51:29.961
We have to move forward and make the vaccine schedule finally safe.

51:30.021 --> 51:31.222
This is 10 years ago.

51:31.742 --> 51:33.443
This is the same script they're on now.

51:34.755 --> 51:42.699
And they'll finally be safe when the vaccine schedule is personalized for every individual genotype and every individual medical history.

51:45.360 --> 51:49.583
That's why there would be a fake medical health freedom movement in America.

51:50.663 --> 51:58.147
Because intramuscular injection is indeed a dumb idea from the late 1800s that actually autism spectrum disorder is a myth designed to hide that.

51:59.762 --> 52:07.788
And gain of function in pandemics is a way for them now to shift and slowly admit that the vaccine schedule is flawed, but the new one isn't.

52:09.389 --> 52:13.372
Please understand I could not be more over the target with this prediction.

52:14.502 --> 52:23.344
And it lines up perfectly with Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn needing to be killed before these people could do their show at the beginning of the pandemic.

52:23.404 --> 52:25.124
They were replaced by these people.

52:26.125 --> 52:29.125
That's the reason why nobody will ever talk about these things.

52:29.785 --> 52:33.986
No one is ever gonna talk about how background could be misconstrued as spread.

52:34.506 --> 52:38.907
No one has ever talked about how supplementary oxygen can cause ARDS.

52:40.508 --> 52:41.208
It's a toxin.

52:42.432 --> 52:57.981
No one can tell you how PCR is used to high fidelity with great results on the academic bench and how none of those techniques were used in the diagnostics that are still being used today by people like Mary Talley Bowden.

52:58.541 --> 53:10.968
No one's ever gonna tell you that these countermeasures were always old, old technologies with previous names and that they lied about that, just renamed them to get new IP started again.

53:11.886 --> 53:18.868
They're never going to tell you that even in its purest form, transfection with mRNA would not be good for a healthy person.

53:18.888 --> 53:19.848
They're never going to get there.

53:20.268 --> 53:38.452
They're never going to get there to tell you that what Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore are credited with inventing is simply the transfection and transformation of cell culture using a pure synthetic DNA construct of the purported viral sequence in question.

53:41.038 --> 53:42.118
They transfect things.

53:43.599 --> 53:50.940
And that's why Vincent Rackengello is Earth's virology professor, because he must sustain that illusion himself.

53:51.441 --> 53:52.401
He understands it.

53:53.381 --> 53:54.881
Most virologists do not.

53:55.962 --> 53:59.102
Because it's so right in front of them, they can't see it.

53:59.763 --> 54:06.424
That's why they don't attempt to refute RNA cannot pandemic, because the whole idea is too simple.

54:07.665 --> 54:08.705
It doesn't compute.

54:09.622 --> 54:14.543
Just like intramuscular injection is dumb, never computes for these people.

54:14.603 --> 54:15.663
They can't get there.

54:19.904 --> 54:34.508
It's like trying to explain to a gun enthusiast without a really nuanced understanding of the dangers of firearms that having guns in your house is not as simple as keeping tools.

54:40.834 --> 54:52.926
But you just can't have conversations like that with people when they don't get it, when they just don't understand, when they've been broken by social media, which is what the majority of adults that surround you now in your life are.

54:53.446 --> 54:55.468
They are broken from social media.

54:58.912 --> 55:03.176
All I can say is, goodness sakes, goodness sakes, goodness sakes, God help us.

55:23.234 --> 55:23.299
you

57:10.003 --> 57:17.671
Harry, Harry, where do you go when the lights go out?

57:18.012 --> 57:24.118
Harry, Harry, where do you go when the lights go out?

59:07.757 --> 59:07.898
you

01:00:34.568 --> 01:00:35.990
Thank you, Mr. Minor.

01:00:37.112 --> 01:00:38.774
Thank you, Mr. Minor.

01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:41.438
Thank you, Mr. Minor.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:42.700
Thank you, Mr. Moon.

01:06:53.562 --> 01:06:54.103
I don't know.

01:06:54.183 --> 01:06:56.146
That's such a great recording.

01:06:57.708 --> 01:06:59.210
They hit some pretty good highs there.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:04.978
It's not quite Frank Zappa from Roxy and elsewhere, but it's damn good jamming.

01:07:05.539 --> 01:07:06.420
It's damn good jamming.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.522
There are a couple other good

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.230
captures of that band.

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.031
They're all right.

01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:12.611
That's okay.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.091
Here's a video.

01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:16.171
I was on a conference call yesterday.

01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:18.032
Was it yesterday?

01:07:18.052 --> 01:07:20.032
I think it was yesterday.

01:07:20.052 --> 01:07:21.552
Maybe it was Sunday.

01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:34.715
Anyways, conference call with a whole bunch of people in the Global Wellness Forum and in this other Sigma group that I'm in about Maha's

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.761
table talk or something like that.

01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:44.628
Okay, so first of all, I want to point out that it's possible that Dr. Sherry Tenpenny doesn't understand how this whole show is being run.

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:47.851
She's a doctor, she's got patience, she's got a life.

01:07:48.371 --> 01:08:01.283
Maybe the same can be said for Leigh Merritt, although I doubt that more because she was promoted by NPR in 2020 and 2021, so the odds of her being not a scripted player are pretty low.

01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:03.763
She's interviewed me a couple times.

01:08:03.803 --> 01:08:23.568
She's a really nice lady She's very sweet, but she believes everything that she hears The last thing she heard is the most interesting things that she's knows and this guy has been On these podcasts with them a lot these two Sherry and and this guy's name is behind me I can't remember it off the top of my head.

01:08:23.628 --> 01:08:24.288
Oh, yeah, Larry.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:24.348
Oh

01:08:25.806 --> 01:08:45.452
They're doctors who are skeptical, they're doctors who are on the Maha movement, but they just still haven't managed to make the functional and directional progress to the point where they start to really think about the root causes, the root understanding of what they know and don't know.

01:08:46.616 --> 01:08:55.312
They just have this amorphous skepticism of vaccines, the contents of them, and maybe this amorphous skepticism of contagion.

01:08:55.994 --> 01:08:58.999
And to what extent is it reliable or reproducible?

01:08:59.974 --> 01:09:04.197
but they have not really gotten to the root of understanding what they know and don't know.

01:09:04.838 --> 01:09:06.739
And they don't really probably know how to do it.

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:28.216
And that's one of the reasons why, unlike myself, which made more progress than the rest of the anti-vax movement has ever made in the course of any time period, nevermind five years, I went from joining the movement, not understanding it, to attempting to redefine it

01:09:30.256 --> 01:09:34.738
and attempting to declare the majority of its leaders frauds.

01:09:35.499 --> 01:09:37.099
That's a lot of progress to make.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:52.507
And now what I see are people who are just caught up in this huge tidal wave of bullshit that has its roots deep in time in the early, early 20th century.

01:09:52.567 --> 01:09:54.208
That's how remarkable this is.

01:09:55.529 --> 01:09:56.269
It's not evil.

01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:57.550
It's not depopulation.

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:58.230
It's lemmings.

01:10:00.575 --> 01:10:00.735
that.

01:10:01.256 --> 01:10:03.379
And Tony Lyons kind of put it together.

01:10:03.459 --> 01:10:18.517
Tony and Zen Honeycutt and Sayer G. And then this guy Gary Burge for something that... Sayer G, Tony Lyons, the head of the campaign for Kennedy along with

01:10:20.114 --> 01:10:24.917
Del Bigtree and originally also Mary Holland before I joined CHD.

01:10:24.957 --> 01:10:34.704
Because again, remember brief period of time, CHD was without Mary Holland and Laura Bono was the acting head.

01:10:35.985 --> 01:10:44.871
And that was when the book work ended and Jackie Hines, Jackie Hines Haynes,

01:10:46.704 --> 01:10:47.825
Jackie Hines.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:50.826
Okay, anyway, you can see it in the book.

01:10:52.007 --> 01:10:55.329
She advocated to Laura Bono to hire me, and she did.

01:10:55.649 --> 01:11:02.553
And when I was hired, it was two weeks later that Mary went off of the campaign and back to CHD.

01:11:04.034 --> 01:11:10.858
She had left CHD to Laura Bono to help with the Kennedy presidential campaign.

01:11:10.878 --> 01:11:13.160
It wasn't until Laura Bono hired me back,

01:11:14.147 --> 01:11:22.201
not hired me back, but hired me to CHD from the writing team when I was no longer needed there, that Mary Holland came back.

01:11:22.803 --> 01:11:27.471
Now that's, in my mind, very crucial to understand because that's not by accident.

01:11:29.175 --> 01:11:35.601
That's by necessity because, again, CHD was not being controlled by Laura Bono.

01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:49.032
Laura Bono is one of these probably very real autism moms, like Brian Hooker was an autism dad at some point, but stopped fighting

01:11:49.935 --> 01:12:03.404
and started using the word autism somewhere around 2015 or 16, maybe just to be a part of the Vaxxed movie, but more importantly, to help the progress with stepping in front of people like Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark.

01:12:05.525 --> 01:12:18.914
He's like got the, he's got a hundred million followers online and him between him and Sayre and Tony Lyons and Zen Honeycutt, they feel like that they have the ears

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:22.671
of more than 50% of the country.

01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:40.540
More than 50% of the country, more than 50% of all the cats that needed to be herded have been effectively herded by four or five people in this Steve Bannon conservative populist fake movement in America.

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:41.660
We are under attack.

01:12:42.221 --> 01:12:44.462
These people are unwitting participants.

01:12:44.562 --> 01:12:46.983
Maybe she's not, but these three maybe are.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.560
They don't know what's going on.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:13:07.966
They don't have the biological sophistication, the lifetime of experience that I have, the lifetime experience that I have with the making of the sausage in academia, with the way that people use terms in academia in their grant proposals that have no relation to reality.

01:13:09.534 --> 01:13:17.940
the way that people write in their grand proposals with a great deal of certainty about what the future holds in their experiments, even though they don't know that.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:22.122
Or sometimes because they do know that.

01:13:24.004 --> 01:13:32.129
I have a very unique set of skills that I have brought to the table here that they never expected anyone to bring to this table.

01:13:33.803 --> 01:13:51.193
And if they had just let me work at the University of Pittsburgh and not bothered me, I probably would still be just having my head down, trying to realign the differential interference contrast of an Olympus microscope that my students screwed up, instead of doing what I'm doing right now.

01:13:51.253 --> 01:13:51.873
They blew it.

01:13:54.195 --> 01:13:56.496
Robert Malone's team blew it.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:01.099
And now what I'm trying to tell all of America that will listen,

01:14:01.986 --> 01:14:09.712
is that the conservative right in America has been fooled by a fake help freedom movement that is run by scripted traitors.

01:14:10.853 --> 01:14:12.375
I think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:12.475 --> 01:14:16.298
is just a victim of a Truman show, but that Truman show is nasty.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:22.203
And it's people like Meryl Nass and Mary Holland and maybe Lee Merritt.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.422
Definitely Robert Malone.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:25.863
Definitely Kevin McKernan.

01:14:25.923 --> 01:14:27.343
Definitely Jessica Rose.

01:14:28.004 --> 01:14:29.605
Definitely Denny Rancor.

01:14:29.705 --> 01:14:30.905
Definitely Nick Hudson.

01:14:30.945 --> 01:14:33.507
Definitely Jonathan Engler.

01:14:33.547 --> 01:14:34.688
Definitely Claire Craig.

01:14:34.728 --> 01:14:36.388
Definitely Mike Eden.

01:14:36.448 --> 01:14:38.850
Definitely Brian Hooker.

01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:40.251
Definitely Pauly Tommy.

01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:41.731
Definitely Andrew Wakefield.

01:14:44.113 --> 01:14:45.994
Who else is in this signal chat?

01:14:47.159 --> 01:15:06.044
Organized by Tony Lyons with with Sherry Tenpenny even bigger than that and the argument was made that we really do need to push forward as we the people and Robert Malone was on that call and he said something that was kind of interesting that and and

01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:09.089
Merle Nass was on the call too.

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:11.250
And they were both speakers.

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.910
Each speaker had like, I don't know, 10 minutes maybe.

01:15:14.571 --> 01:15:20.692
And Robert Malone said, you know, they do hear our voice.

01:15:20.732 --> 01:15:35.975
This is probably the first administration and the cabinet members and stuff that are really feeling the heat of we the people, because we the people are for the first time, maybe ever, or at least in a very long time,

01:15:36.482 --> 01:15:38.403
paying attention to what they're doing.

01:15:39.043 --> 01:15:52.050
And that we're really, you know, using the masses number of people, because people were calling the people on that committee, because they voted on that, that pesticide bill on Monday, I think, and to vote it out of committee.

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:55.512
And some of the people were reporting that they called

01:15:56.018 --> 01:16:07.268
that they called their senators, and some of the people were just, the aides were just like, they're so sick of hearing this, because they had gotten so many calls, they were just overwhelmed.

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:12.854
And so they were talking about a consolidated message that, listen, we the people,

01:16:13.454 --> 01:16:24.538
And Robert Malone said, he goes, think about this, when Merle Nass took it on the World Health Organization and the international health regulations and this treaty, nobody knew anything about it.

01:16:24.938 --> 01:16:27.079
And if Merle wouldn't have dug through it.

01:16:27.879 --> 01:16:36.942
If Merle Nass wouldn't have dug through the regulations of the WHO and brought it to the attention of the world, we might have missed the opportunity to get out of the WHO.

01:16:37.862 --> 01:16:49.666
We might have missed the opportunity to pull away all of our funding, but it was Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and the Door to Freedom which brought this to the attention of the administration and got them to act.

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:52.667
Stop lying!

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.708
Stop lying!

01:16:56.589 --> 01:16:59.590
Wow, I mean that's some serious bullshittery.

01:17:00.091 --> 01:17:04.074
and threw it up and made a huge big stink about it.

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:09.038
Went to Europe and talked to their parliaments and did all these different, nobody would have known anything about it.

01:17:09.118 --> 01:17:09.959
It would have just passed.

01:17:10.419 --> 01:17:11.340
And that now.

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:18.525
Meryl Nass is the one who got the world to realize that the who was trying to pass all kinds of crazy shit.

01:17:20.587 --> 01:17:25.411
Just like Charles Rixey is the guy who released the diffuse proposal like Kevin McKernan says.

01:17:27.762 --> 01:17:33.767
Just like Peter McCullough spoke out about how hearts weren't being hurt by the hydroxychloroquine.

01:17:33.807 --> 01:17:39.211
And just like Pierre Corey spoke out against the, you know, the censoring of ivermectin.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:49.580
I don't think Sherry is near sophisticated enough to understand how many liars she's surrounded by.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.022
Even if in this zoom meeting, there's only one.

01:17:53.645 --> 01:17:57.108
We are not doing, we are out of the World Health Organization.

01:17:57.148 --> 01:18:00.050
We are not approving the international health regulations.

01:18:00.611 --> 01:18:01.111
And so.

01:18:01.392 --> 01:18:11.660
And so again, I think it's a very valid point to make that if the health organization, the World Health Organization, and we're not in it, then we don't have to worry about it.

01:18:12.486 --> 01:18:23.535
But if we are such a big deal country and so many other countries are dependent on the who, then maybe we should dangle some money in front of the who in order to influence its operation.

01:18:23.556 --> 01:18:24.937
But we never bothered to do that.

01:18:25.477 --> 01:18:27.359
America never thinks to do that.

01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:36.314
We just let Bill Gates and China give all the money to the WHO, and we don't bother to do anything, even though we funded the WHO for the longest time.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.635
You see what the problem here is?

01:18:39.196 --> 01:18:41.998
The normal levers of power are not being used.

01:18:42.058 --> 01:18:47.461
The normal means by which we would influence world affairs is not being used anymore.

01:18:47.481 --> 01:18:48.262
And why is that?

01:18:48.702 --> 01:18:54.506
Because the shift has been made to blaming America for things, to being skeptical of America for things.

01:18:55.322 --> 01:19:00.405
to blaming a lot of situations in the world on America.

01:19:00.465 --> 01:19:01.566
That's where we're going.

01:19:02.867 --> 01:19:07.970
The nation states of the West are responsible for Israel and the atrocities there.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.413
Therefore, the nation states of the West will lose legitimacy.

01:19:12.453 --> 01:19:14.755
The EU will lose legitimacy.

01:19:15.355 --> 01:19:24.461
America is losing legitimacy by the hour because of the theater that is the Donald Trump administration with the Maha movement and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:25.868 --> 01:19:27.148
And this is by design.

01:19:27.188 --> 01:19:29.969
It's a controlled demolition of America, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:35.911
And I am terrified for my country and we need help from other countries.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:39.773
We need help from the left to understand what was done to the right.

01:19:39.813 --> 01:19:49.856
We need the left to wake up, to understand that you have been as bamboozled as the right into believing in spectrums of disorders that do not exist.

01:19:50.756 --> 01:19:52.917
Spectrums of gender that do not exist.

01:19:54.511 --> 01:20:00.033
spectrum of foreign policy that don't exist, spectrums of racism that don't exist.

01:20:01.593 --> 01:20:14.617
Robert Malone, you know, you know, in his crusty way, I don't still, you know, just listening to what he said, he goes, this just shows you that they are paying attention to us, maybe for the first time ever.

01:20:15.237 --> 01:20:23.480
And that if we really keep on their butts and really start to hold them accountable, because we are we the people and they are paying attention.

01:20:24.258 --> 01:20:37.006
And, you know, I'm not bought into that lock, stock and barrel, but I do feel it because I'm on a lot of these calls and I'm in a lot of these committees and I'm going to DC tomorrow or Saturday, and I'm going to be down there for a couple of days.

01:20:37.106 --> 01:20:40.108
And it is a little different.

01:20:40.248 --> 01:20:41.929
I mean, I've used to do a lot of lobbying.

01:20:41.989 --> 01:20:46.692
And think about all the energy they are spending when it's a sentence.

01:20:46.952 --> 01:20:48.273
It's a bumper sticker.

01:20:51.115 --> 01:20:54.739
Intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:20:54.819 --> 01:21:10.076
It basically stems from a time when the town doctor would only have one hypodermic needle and it would be used for a wide variety of things, including curing neuralgia, curing shingles, injecting morphine.

01:21:14.028 --> 01:21:27.531
And so it made perfect sense going forward to solve the problem of smallpox inoculation, for example, with intramuscular injection because variolation on the skin is painful and leaves scars.

01:21:29.672 --> 01:21:35.633
Intramuscular injection is pain-free, leaves no scar and can be done very precisely.

01:21:36.754 --> 01:21:37.554
What is that noise?

01:21:37.634 --> 01:21:38.594
What is going on in here?

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.321
Is there a naughty dog somewhere?

01:21:41.801 --> 01:21:42.001
No.

01:21:42.641 --> 01:21:46.223
Oh, it's a sleeping dog making noise over there, running in his sleep.

01:21:46.243 --> 01:21:46.903
Sorry about that.

01:21:47.844 --> 01:21:48.724
Okay, here we go.

01:21:48.784 --> 01:21:55.487
Back years ago, when I had lots of money, I was part of the presidential round table, Republican round table for a while.

01:21:56.088 --> 01:22:04.312
And you know, I just, it's like all theater, but there is a little piece of shift that is happening.

01:22:04.332 --> 01:22:05.172
It's all theater.

01:22:05.832 --> 01:22:07.293
She seems to kind of know it.

01:22:07.373 --> 01:22:09.234
And this little shift means nothing.

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:24.258
This little shift is like moving from the MMR to also talking about the DTP, or also talking about aluminum, or also talking about mercury, or also talking about the HPV vaccine, or the absurdity of giving a vaccine on day of birth.

01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:31.943
These are all details that don't matter if intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:22:34.785 --> 01:22:36.346
They're all secondary ideas.

01:22:37.415 --> 01:22:39.937
They're not even related, some of them.

01:22:40.457 --> 01:22:44.140
They're outside of the scope of reality.

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:48.022
If intramuscular injection is just not medicine.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:54.006
And that I don't think has ever happened before.

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:58.069
I mean, how many of you think about this in the last five presidents?

01:22:58.629 --> 01:23:00.331
How many cabinet members could you name?

01:23:01.551 --> 01:23:02.172
Like none.

01:23:05.098 --> 01:23:14.171
She's selling the idea that we are making progress, that we are farther than we've ever been before, but despite the fact that she has made no intellectual progress.

01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:19.751
She's not any better at explaining this than when she first started.

01:23:20.191 --> 01:23:26.154
Just like Suzanne Humphreys is strikingly not any better at explaining this than when she first started.

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:37.580
Both of these likely scripted traitors were actually probably on film better at explaining it when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were still alive before the pandemic.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.921
I'd bet dollars to donuts.

01:23:40.595 --> 01:23:48.799
That's how malevolent this shit show is on the case of Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard and Pam Bondi.

01:23:49.019 --> 01:23:52.380
And, you know, you go around the table and say a whole bunch more names.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.482
I'm not really great with names, but we know what they're doing.

01:23:55.502 --> 01:23:56.962
We're watching what they're doing.

01:23:57.523 --> 01:23:57.763
I mean.

01:23:58.503 --> 01:24:01.926
huge people with big audiences are watching what we're doing.

01:24:01.966 --> 01:24:05.609
And I would call that one of the gifts of COVID.

01:24:05.809 --> 01:24:14.637
One of the gifts of COVID is that social media has become ever more relevant for the control of political and socioeconomic narratives.

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:17.479
Absolutely.

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:20.442
One of the gifts to our rulers

01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:28.119
is our acquiescence to the ubiquitous use of social media for every aspect of our lives.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:39.405
Our free use of apps to manage our calendars so that all of this shit, all of our preferences can be weaponized against us.

01:24:39.525 --> 01:24:43.868
And none of these people seem to be aware that that was all that would be necessary

01:24:44.824 --> 01:24:57.453
for the illusion of a lab leak mystery virus to be created, sustained and used as a weapon against us to the point where we would be coerced into teaching it as truth to our kids.

01:24:59.275 --> 01:25:01.516
They don't seem to be able to get there.

01:25:02.557 --> 01:25:11.384
Even though I've explained it to that woman a couple of times, even though I used to work for CHD, even though I'm listed in the Wuhan coverup book as the expert,

01:25:12.597 --> 01:25:17.120
None of these people have bothered to follow my work long enough to figure it out, to hear it.

01:25:19.641 --> 01:25:35.991
I think that's because they have to be insulated by the same military industrial programming that keeps them on top of everyone's feed, keeps Robert Malone relevant, keeps Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:39.733
and all the podcasts with Jayantabadacharya relevant.

01:25:40.649 --> 01:25:47.073
That same programming keeps me away from them, keeps Housatonic ITS away from them.

01:25:47.113 --> 01:25:49.475
They're never gonna see critiques of themselves.

01:25:52.057 --> 01:25:57.240
Except for maybe when they see an occasional healthy American critique, because she's on their team.

01:25:58.061 --> 01:26:03.585
Maybe when they hear a little bad words from somebody like Sasha Latupova, but she's on the team.

01:26:04.165 --> 01:26:05.026
So it doesn't matter.

01:26:05.908 --> 01:26:15.540
In fact, as long as they critique Robert Malone, I don't know if I'm completely on board with him or not, it looks like they're kind of in opposition.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.943
They're skeptical, so at least I can trust her.

01:26:18.604 --> 01:26:19.285
Stop lying!

01:26:22.503 --> 01:26:26.487
People went, whoa, what in the hell is going on?

01:26:26.987 --> 01:26:29.790
What have we, we've taken our hands off the steering wheel.

01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:34.154
We thought if we just checked the box, they were down there doing things in our best interest.

01:26:34.675 --> 01:26:38.418
And because of COVID, we found out what a absolute lie that is.

01:26:38.759 --> 01:26:42.883
We always kind of thought it was probably a lie, but now it's been exposed like the,

01:26:44.684 --> 01:26:50.748
The king has no clothes, you know, the emperor has... If you see it like a hamster wheel, you understand.

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:54.330
Before the pandemic, there was nobody who wasn't skeptical of pharma.

01:26:54.990 --> 01:27:02.155
There was nobody who wasn't skeptical of big pharma and their profits, their abilities to lie, their amount of money that they put into it.

01:27:02.435 --> 01:27:04.096
Nobody was skeptical of that at all.

01:27:07.158 --> 01:27:09.159
Everybody believed that that's the way it was.

01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:10.760
America's capitalism, right?

01:27:11.718 --> 01:27:13.019
by any means necessary.

01:27:13.099 --> 01:27:14.040
Profit, profit, profit.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:14.680
They know that.

01:27:15.641 --> 01:27:16.802
So it's like a hamster wheel.

01:27:16.862 --> 01:27:20.364
Now, all of a sudden we kind of didn't know, but now we know for sure.

01:27:20.464 --> 01:27:23.286
And pretty soon we're not going to know again, but now we know for sure.

01:27:23.387 --> 01:27:26.589
And well, we weren't sure about the lab leak, but now we know for sure.

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:29.211
And you know, before, but now we know for sure.

01:27:31.226 --> 01:27:36.451
Well, we didn't know for sure that some of the adjuvants were bad for you, but now we know for sure.

01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:39.054
So that's why the mRNA is so much better.

01:27:39.494 --> 01:27:47.262
If we just get the DNA contamination out, we'll have finally fixed the vaccine schedule just like Dell Big Tree wanted us to back in 2017.

01:27:49.005 --> 01:27:49.526
up close.

01:27:50.166 --> 01:27:53.689
And, you know, we know how bad the health care system really is.

01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:58.152
I mean, those people like us have known it for a while, but that's a really small set of people.

01:27:59.153 --> 01:28:03.616
A really small set of people that since you guys have been in charge has not really grown at all.

01:28:04.797 --> 01:28:06.098
The word hasn't gotten out.

01:28:06.539 --> 01:28:07.960
The messaging hasn't grown.

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.764
Your ability to explain your position and its merits has not grown.

01:28:12.824 --> 01:28:13.604
It's gotten worse.

01:28:14.965 --> 01:28:17.087
Suzanne Humphreys has written exactly one book.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.532
really got to know about

01:28:22.452 --> 01:28:25.413
the COVID jab and how many people it's hurt and killed.

01:28:25.914 --> 01:28:30.135
And there's people that are going, wait a minute, what about the rest of these shots?

01:28:30.596 --> 01:28:32.316
At larger numbers than ever.

01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:37.198
Somebody just sent me, a Midwestern doctor just sent me an article to read this morning and he said.

01:28:37.419 --> 01:28:46.082
There she is plugging an anonymous sub stack that they all plug including Pierre Corey plugs the Midwestern doctor all the time.

01:28:46.142 --> 01:28:51.925
He might have a lot of good information, but it is a sub stack and her plugging it is scripted.

01:28:55.589 --> 01:28:57.150
It's absolutely scripted.

01:28:57.831 --> 01:28:58.471
Look at this.

01:28:58.632 --> 01:29:04.216
Almost all this high number of parents are saying, we don't trust vaccines at all anymore.

01:29:04.757 --> 01:29:07.319
And so there are shifts.

01:29:07.739 --> 01:29:23.032
Think about how helpful it would be if one of these scripted assholes could explain to those parents that don't trust vaccines, that are a little skeptical of vaccines, that they have a good reason to be because intramuscular injection is a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:29:31.343 --> 01:29:39.488
There are things, now, does that mean that everything is all hunky-dory and we can just sing kumbaya and hold hands and go away?

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:40.328
Absolutely not.

01:29:40.889 --> 01:29:47.793
But I do think that there's some shifts going on down there, like the earth shaking in ways that's never before.

01:29:48.433 --> 01:29:54.677
And that gives room for what you're talking about, Lee, to really get some momentum.

01:29:55.205 --> 01:30:00.470
Because if they find out about that, that this whole take your county back and all the things that you're doing.

01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.212
No, I like take your county back.

01:30:02.292 --> 01:30:04.575
I like the idea of becoming county sheriff.

01:30:04.695 --> 01:30:05.556
I like the idea.

01:30:05.936 --> 01:30:06.757
That's all great.

01:30:06.817 --> 01:30:10.521
And if that's what Lee Merritt is arguing for, then I'm all for it.

01:30:10.581 --> 01:30:16.086
But Lee Merritt also talks a lot about shit she doesn't understand, like optogenetics.

01:30:16.347 --> 01:30:17.468
And that pisses me off.

01:30:18.567 --> 01:30:27.273
So it makes sense to me in a way that her local organization and this advocation for taking over your county is a great idea.

01:30:28.554 --> 01:30:42.164
But that great idea is, is weighed down by the anchor of the, the dead weight of all this speculative bullshit biology that she engages with almost all the time.

01:30:45.436 --> 01:30:58.766
on the common law side, and they was doing this, like you said, 43 states, that is really going to impact DC in a way that five years ago, they were going, yeah, oh, yawn, yawn, yawn, and not paid any bit of attention to it.

01:30:59.146 --> 01:31:03.489
But I think it really is really shaking some shoes down.

01:31:03.569 --> 01:31:04.029
It's bad.

01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:06.051
It's worse than you think, though.

01:31:06.551 --> 01:31:07.212
You swallowed it.

01:31:08.372 --> 01:31:13.316
And it is what you swallowed into your stomach and into your intestines.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:19.398
So the food you eat goes into your esophagus, down into your stomach, into your intestines, and you poop it out.

01:31:20.278 --> 01:31:24.379
So guess how this virus was getting into everybody that they're sitting there testing the poop water from?

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:25.819
You swallowed it.

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.600
For sure, you swallowed it.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.660
And it's the only thing that makes sense about this whole thing.

01:31:30.941 --> 01:31:37.422
And it's not like that's a revelation because you swallow the mucus that you cough up during any respiratory infection.

01:31:38.641 --> 01:31:42.304
So this is not a new revelation that he just figured out now.

01:31:43.024 --> 01:31:49.349
It might really actually be a new revelation that he figured out right now because that's what showed up on his stupid script.

01:31:50.489 --> 01:31:53.251
But this is one of the most malevolent shitheads on earth.

01:31:53.391 --> 01:31:56.313
And he's been scripted by Robert Malone for quite some time.

01:31:56.814 --> 01:32:00.456
And you might think for a second here he's going to say something sensible, but he's not.

01:32:00.797 --> 01:32:01.177
He's not.

01:32:02.304 --> 01:32:06.965
So when we get to these DNA plasmids, I didn't know about DNA plasmids until about four months ago, actually.

01:32:07.345 --> 01:32:15.587
He didn't know about DNA plasmids until about four months ago, but he did a red pill expo thing in front of me a year ago.

01:32:16.587 --> 01:32:18.487
Like he, I followed him.

01:32:19.328 --> 01:32:30.710
My talk was about DNA plasmids and about how virology is just transfection and transformation of cell culture using pure DNA plasmids or pure RNA derived from them.

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:38.692
And now he's actually pretending on these shithead podcasts that he figured this out himself.

01:32:40.234 --> 01:32:42.816
It isn't the script that he was given by Robert Malone.

01:32:42.856 --> 01:32:45.798
It's him figuring it out because he's working so hard for you.

01:32:46.279 --> 01:32:47.240
Never knew these things existed.

01:32:47.952 --> 01:32:49.353
So I found this on the NIH website.

01:32:49.673 --> 01:32:51.434
I was like, oh my God, you're putting DNA plasmids?

01:32:51.474 --> 01:32:52.174
What are these things?

01:32:52.194 --> 01:32:53.155
Where'd they come from?

01:32:53.695 --> 01:32:54.895
And I will give credit where it's due.

01:32:55.156 --> 01:32:56.356
There's a guy named Kevin McKernan.

01:32:56.776 --> 01:32:58.637
Oh, he's got to cite his teammate, right?

01:32:58.677 --> 01:33:02.839
The guy that's been scripting all these assholes since the beginning of the pandemic with Robert Malone.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.161
That's exactly how you know he's fake.

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:16.726
The guy who has been in front of the Senate a couple of times with Senator Ron Johnson and Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone and Jessica Rose.

01:33:19.406 --> 01:33:22.409
Kevin McKernan is one of the worst Americans alive.

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:29.936
And Brian Artis is admitting that he is a collaborator of one of the worst Americans alive by saying his name out loud right now.

01:33:31.938 --> 01:33:34.440
Who brought up the fact that these DNA plasmids exist.

01:33:35.061 --> 01:33:40.266
Dr. Henry Ely starts sharing all this research with me and I was like, oh my God, this is how they did it.

01:33:42.944 --> 01:33:43.725
There was no virus.

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:45.466
They used DNA plasmids to do this.

01:33:45.666 --> 01:33:50.811
I just didn't know that geneticists around the world have been making plasmids since the 60s.

01:33:50.971 --> 01:33:52.052
Not geneticists.

01:33:53.473 --> 01:33:55.695
Geneticists aren't making the plasmids.

01:33:55.895 --> 01:33:57.396
It's molecular biologists.

01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:05.864
Molecular biologists that want to transform and transfect animals and cell culture for a wide variety of reasons.

01:34:07.188 --> 01:34:18.093
including mimicking, mimicking synthetic biology and virology by transfecting cell cultures with viral constructs.

01:34:19.734 --> 01:34:27.297
The thing that, that Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore, the discoverer of reverse transcriptase,

01:34:28.683 --> 01:34:30.204
That's the thing that they invented.

01:34:30.864 --> 01:34:38.890
And you're supposed to believe that this is his best attempt at explaining it after just discovering it for fricking months ago.

01:34:40.891 --> 01:34:42.372
This is a scripted fraud.

01:34:42.432 --> 01:34:52.698
And one of the worst Americans alive, Brian artists and putting snake venom and other venoms inside of DNA plasmids that they call spike protein genes.

01:34:52.718 --> 01:34:53.939
I didn't know they were doing that.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:54.800
I had no idea.

01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:58.112
You just need plasmids.

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:02.116
Spike protein genes are actually venom genes.

01:35:03.737 --> 01:35:06.840
And a venom protein gene inserted inside of that.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.383
And then you put inside that plasmid something called a promoter.

01:35:10.624 --> 01:35:12.585
It's an instruction in genetics.

01:35:13.424 --> 01:35:14.105
genetic term.

01:35:14.545 --> 01:35:24.112
It's a promoter that tells the DNA in a mammal cell, or the DNA in a bacteria, or the DNA inside of a yeast cell or fungal cell.

01:35:24.132 --> 01:35:26.414
Can you not see how much of a schtick this is?

01:35:26.494 --> 01:35:27.294
It's an act.

01:35:28.335 --> 01:35:37.602
He's a snake oil salesman, and if I was able to sit down and talk to him, I could ask him questions which would expose him as the charlatan as he is.

01:35:38.023 --> 01:35:41.025
He wouldn't be able to explain his way out of a wet paper bag.

01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:48.365
That's how shitty his script is and how far out on a plank he is.

01:35:49.806 --> 01:35:51.487
And the plank has one nail in it.

01:35:52.547 --> 01:35:57.190
It's coming out really fast as he bounces up and down on it like it's a diving board.

01:35:57.611 --> 01:35:58.872
He's a dumb shit.

01:36:00.152 --> 01:36:06.477
And this is evidence of him not being an intelligent genius, but being a scripted dumbass.

01:36:08.373 --> 01:36:10.375
Because none of this makes any sense.

01:36:10.835 --> 01:36:18.982
And especially it doesn't make any sense to admit that you didn't even know that they made DNA plasmids until four months ago.

01:36:19.602 --> 01:36:31.512
The whole basis for sequencing PCR and the whole charade of the Human Genome Project is based on that fundamental methodology, you gigantic scripted traitor.

01:36:33.814 --> 01:36:37.477
To make the spike protein gene and spit it out of you.

01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:49.483
So bacteria and yeast suck in the plasmids, your own cells suck in the plasmids, and then they release the actual venom into the body or the environment, wherever it is.

01:36:50.684 --> 01:36:53.464
And that's how they got COVID inside of you.

01:36:54.504 --> 01:37:03.526
Just so you know, anybody out there living with long haul or COVID symptoms after having a mild case of COVID, you had DNA plasmids with the spike protein genes of king cobras and bungalow toxin in your body, they called COVID.

01:37:04.207 --> 01:37:05.767
Even PCR tested and found that's what you had.

01:37:06.735 --> 01:37:13.457
And then you have had lingering symptoms for a year and a half to two years ever since because- See, because PCR testing worked.

01:37:14.497 --> 01:37:16.838
He just told you they tested for it and they found it.

01:37:16.918 --> 01:37:24.201
He tells you that PCR testing works and that they put it in places, but he's not actually telling you.

01:37:27.622 --> 01:37:28.502
It's remarkable.

01:37:29.522 --> 01:37:30.423
It's traitorous.

01:37:30.643 --> 01:37:31.643
It's fraudulent.

01:37:33.001 --> 01:37:37.768
He deserves to have rotten vegetables thrown at him for the rest of his life.

01:37:38.909 --> 01:37:47.801
Brian Artis is one of the worst Americans alive because he accepted the shitty script of Kevin McKernan, Robert Malone, Ditra, and DOE.

01:37:50.077 --> 01:37:53.299
Because in your body, these plasmids were what got inside of you.

01:37:53.659 --> 01:38:01.064
Now they're in your cells, they're in bacteria in your cells and in your bowels, like E. coli, and what's called enterobacter cells.

01:38:01.665 --> 01:38:06.948
And they're also inside of yeast inside of your bowels, which can be called candida.

01:38:07.308 --> 01:38:08.489
Ooh, he's teaching.

01:38:08.509 --> 01:38:10.210
Oh, he's saying big words.

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.752
He knows three different things that are in your gut.

01:38:12.792 --> 01:38:13.653
He's so smart.

01:38:14.113 --> 01:38:16.074
Boy, he must have been hanging out with Sabine.

01:38:16.555 --> 01:38:17.015
Or yeast.

01:38:18.895 --> 01:38:28.003
All of that microbiome in your bowel is what they are weaponizing to be biological weapon manufacturing facilities in your own body.

01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:30.405
So you're now creating more of that within.

01:38:30.865 --> 01:38:39.653
You are nonstop making the venom proteins over and over and over and over and over as long as those bacteria, yeast, and your cells are in your body manufacturing it.

01:38:43.703 --> 01:38:48.285
I don't know what to say anymore, ladies and gentlemen, but there was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

01:38:51.907 --> 01:38:54.948
We see that the birth rates are declining worldwide.

01:38:56.129 --> 01:39:02.192
We know that certain vaccines not only were intentional to limit birth cohort.

01:39:02.212 --> 01:39:04.993
Do you see that the birth rate is going to decrease?

01:39:05.073 --> 01:39:07.334
It's actually right there in the population pyramid.

01:39:09.014 --> 01:39:33.409
the birth rate would have been predicted to decrease like right around here when these people started to have babies and we started to tell them that having more than two babies was selfish you know like my my my bamboozled brother who didn't have any kids like the kids that are growing up now the birth rate is not going down because of vaccines ladies and gentlemen i'm sorry but it's not

01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:42.388
but it is an illusion of consensus among the health freedom movement that it is.

01:39:43.329 --> 01:39:52.797
They even made a movie about it, CHD, because they don't want you to know about the population pyramid and about how easily they could lie about it.

01:39:54.181 --> 01:40:01.506
Just like Mary Holland will never tell you that most autism on the autism spectrum disorder is not from vaccines.

01:40:01.907 --> 01:40:13.595
And that part of the reason why they keep this ever expanding definition is because they're trying to cloud and muddy the water about how vaccine damage occurs and how it shows up and how rare it is or it isn't.

01:40:16.898 --> 01:40:19.720
Because Mary Holland is part of that malevolent script.

01:40:21.584 --> 01:40:25.388
And that's why she's telling you now that the birth rate is going down because of vaccines.

01:40:25.448 --> 01:40:32.656
We did a really important film called Infertility, a Diabolical Agenda that you can watch on CHD TV.

01:40:34.018 --> 01:40:39.223
But we know that the births have declined, right, that the birth and the levels of

01:40:40.137 --> 01:40:43.638
miscarriages and congenital defects have been increasing.

01:40:43.698 --> 01:40:51.662
So something very that we see that the birth rates are declining worldwide.

01:40:53.542 --> 01:40:55.023
There's no way that she doesn't know.

01:40:55.063 --> 01:40:57.104
There's no way that Robert F. Kennedy doesn't know.

01:40:57.144 --> 01:41:04.327
There's no way that Jay Bhattacharya doesn't know because I've told them all to their face on Zoom and in person at barbecues over tacos.

01:41:06.471 --> 01:41:09.155
I've explained to them the population pyramid.

01:41:09.235 --> 01:41:22.274
I've explained to them how PCR, how ventilators, how supplementary oxygen, how antibiotics, how remdesivir, midazolam, how financial incentives and PCR fraud.

01:41:23.385 --> 01:41:27.666
and the opioid crisis have all contributed to this illusion of a mystery virus.

01:41:28.446 --> 01:41:39.729
And they all don't care because they're all on Robert Malone's malevolent script that includes viruses going endemic and the biggest danger of zoonosis being endemic.

01:41:41.110 --> 01:41:47.592
The idea that a zoonotic virus could go endemic and contribute to death in the future forevermore.

01:41:48.672 --> 01:41:52.293
Endemicity is neither a proven process nor a proven endpoint.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.922
It's just a background, ladies and gentlemen, that was misconstrued by PCR.

01:41:59.523 --> 01:42:05.445
And it's just placebo that allowed them to roll these shots out without injuring millions and millions more.

01:42:07.006 --> 01:42:19.151
None of these people will usefully question PCR because it's still being used now because that is one of the primary new remnant streams that they are using to assemble the genetic data that they need.

01:42:20.826 --> 01:42:49.238
Tomorrow we're gonna do a paper which admits that that the human genome is a lot more complicated than the Human Genome Project said it was And we just sequenced some more shit recently and boy now we really got it this time so essentially They're kind of announcing it was completed again, or they did it again, or they're doing some more of it or something I don't know It's all bullshit ladies and gentlemen and the reason why it's all bullshit is because this is for the all the marbles It's for the grandchildren of Earth

01:42:50.051 --> 01:42:55.953
They want us to teach these lies to our grandkids so that the grandkids never, ever learn.

01:42:56.693 --> 01:43:01.755
The only way we can do it and the only way we can avoid it is to fly our own direction.

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.156
You want to know who the traitors are?

01:43:04.216 --> 01:43:08.118
Most of them or a lot of them are on this screen or related to the people on this screen.

01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:10.911
Thanks very much for being here.

01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:12.552
Sorry I needed so many days off.

01:43:12.612 --> 01:43:21.539
It's a lot of work being here by myself, and it's a lot of work trying to get these other things done in the background on this shoestring budget.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:29.846
May 30th, 2025, a lot of these guys were on a paper together with Steve Hatfield with basically a giant admission.

01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:32.448
that they are all part of this show.

01:43:33.429 --> 01:43:39.955
I believe that my track record shows me as somebody who has made more progress than almost anybody alive.

01:43:40.555 --> 01:43:46.361
I don't think I've made as much progress as Brandy Vaughn made in her short period of time between 15 and 18.

01:43:46.461 --> 01:43:54.888
I don't know if I made as much progress as Tony Bark made in her brief anti-vaxx career.

01:43:55.789 --> 01:44:04.271
But I know where I am now, and where I am right now is intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting a healthy human is dumb.

01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:08.492
Transfection was always a crime, and viruses are not pattern integrities.

01:44:08.532 --> 01:44:10.093
I've actually made some progress, though.

01:44:10.113 --> 01:44:15.334
I think you can say it more simply that intramuscular injection is just a dumb idea from the late 1800s.

01:44:15.874 --> 01:44:18.855
Transfection of healthy humans was a crime, and RNA

01:44:19.435 --> 01:44:20.376
Cannot pandemic.

01:44:20.516 --> 01:44:21.636
Thank you very much for being here.

01:44:21.656 --> 01:44:24.918
I'll try and see you again tomorrow Hopefully a little bit earlier.

01:44:25.498 --> 01:44:28.399
I'm gonna go to the gym now Love you very much.

01:44:28.839 --> 01:44:29.080
Thank you.

01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:29.300
Thank you.

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:29.600
Thank you

01:44:39.912 --> 01:44:44.555
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan Cooey coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

01:44:44.575 --> 01:44:46.576
You can PubMed me and find out who I am.

01:44:47.216 --> 01:44:48.837
You can see me in that book with Bobby.

01:44:49.177 --> 01:44:52.559
And I used to do barbecues with Jay Bhattacharya.

01:44:52.639 --> 01:44:56.522
Got a couple websites, got a couple YouTube channels.

01:44:57.142 --> 01:44:59.303
I need you to share this work, please, ladies and gentlemen.

01:44:59.343 --> 01:45:00.424
Share it with everybody you know.

01:45:00.444 --> 01:45:04.946
And the best way to do that is go to gigolambiological.com and share it that way.

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:05.887
Thanks for being here.

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:07.268
See you again tomorrow.
