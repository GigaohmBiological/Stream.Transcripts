00:17.733 --> 00:20.355
Test 1-2 testing 1-2.

00:20.375 --> 00:25.359
Good morning.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.600
Test 1-2 testing 1-2.

00:27.740 --> 00:28.741
Test 1-2.

00:29.181 --> 00:36.507
The gigaohm biological high resistance low noise information brief is brought to you by a biologist named Jonathan J. Cooey.

00:37.568 --> 00:50.853
You can find me by looking me up on PubMed by my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, and my first initials, J and J. Good morning, Solar Fire, Zardoz, Brother Spoon, and Jazzy Jazz.

00:52.173 --> 00:53.594
Pamela, good to see you.

00:53.874 --> 00:54.914
Happy New Year, everybody.

00:56.615 --> 00:57.815
First full week of school.

00:58.035 --> 00:59.956
Good to see you guys again.

01:08.239 --> 01:08.961
you

06:45.967 --> 06:47.267
Good morning, everybody.

06:47.848 --> 06:52.049
Welcome to the show where we stay focused on the biology.

06:52.089 --> 06:56.711
We don't take the bait on social media, and we love our neighbor as best we can.

06:58.371 --> 07:00.812
Thanks very much for being here on this Monday.

07:00.972 --> 07:04.993
In America, there was supposed to be some kind of great big snowstorm.

07:05.093 --> 07:10.575
It was going to be such a big snowstorm, they actually preemptively canceled my kid's school today.

07:10.635 --> 07:12.736
And it turns out we got about seven millimeters

07:13.928 --> 07:15.649
That's basically how it works.

07:16.830 --> 07:20.792
They spread the word, and people hear it, and then act accordingly.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.653
And that's how this stream works, actually.

07:22.713 --> 07:32.978
Members, just a few of them, about 120 plus four all-star producer-level supporters are here.

07:33.879 --> 07:35.219
And that's how we get here.

07:35.359 --> 07:40.502
And the rest of you are consistently sharing this work, and that's why we're growing a little bit every week.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.587
I don't know why I'm not playing any music anymore.

07:45.607 --> 07:49.349
I just kind of felt like that Van Halen song was enough for me this morning.

07:51.390 --> 07:53.692
I guess maybe I could fix that a little bit.

07:53.812 --> 08:07.599
It has been a long, strange, weird, goofy trip that we've been on where we've had several paradigm shifts, several changes, and the only thing that stayed true

08:10.160 --> 08:12.722
I apologize here for my throat in the morning.

08:14.042 --> 08:20.486
The only thing that has stayed true is that the illusion is sustained by our active participation.

08:20.546 --> 08:23.028
It is our active scrolling.

08:23.648 --> 08:25.609
It's our active retweeting.

08:26.249 --> 08:34.454
It's our active participation in their programs that make these theaters effective.

08:34.974 --> 08:38.617
The only reason why we believe is because we keep turning on the TV.

08:39.648 --> 08:43.349
and begging it for the truth and assuming that we're getting some.

08:45.070 --> 08:57.275
And GigaOM Biological is one of the few places on the internet that would go against that contention, that any truth at all is available on mainstream or what is now called social media.

08:58.895 --> 09:02.957
And if anybody has gotten this right over the last five years, I would say it's Bob.

09:04.457 --> 09:11.238
The guy over in Europe who's been drawing these nice cartoons that I've been using behind my graphics.

09:12.338 --> 09:19.340
I think this guy is one of the guys that's aware of the grand illusion that has been perpetuated on us.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.480
Thank you very much for joining me.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.080
It's January 6th, 2025.

09:22.480 --> 09:28.721
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

09:29.841 --> 09:32.662
I've rearranged my desk a little bit, so just give me a second to

09:34.201 --> 09:35.622
get myself reoriented.

09:35.663 --> 09:37.084
Hello, my name is Jonathan Cooey.

09:37.765 --> 09:51.998
I had an equipment failure over the holiday break where my soundboard that I had gotten off of Craigslist just kind of died, and specifically it was the 48 volt microphone that was the support for the microphone's condenser.

09:52.939 --> 10:09.837
um was dying and that was really making my microphone sound like it was clipping all the time and actually the last time that I presented to the medical doctors for COVID ethics my mic was clipping the whole time it's not clipping in the in the vu meter or whatever but it does clip in the terms of the sound and that was because my

10:10.776 --> 10:16.959
You know, whatever that thing is that turns the AC into the DC inside of that soundboard apparently was dying.

10:16.999 --> 10:18.120
It was also adding noise.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.941
And so I went bananas on eBay.

10:21.001 --> 10:22.262
I now have three.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.644
I know that sounds silly, but on eBay you can get them for like 50 or 60 bucks.

10:26.664 --> 10:29.045
So I have three versions of the same thing now.

10:29.925 --> 10:31.806
Two in the cabinet, one on the desk.

10:32.607 --> 10:33.807
I'm very happy with it.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.809
It does, let me see, it does,

10:38.174 --> 10:39.094
I thought I knew how to do it.

10:39.114 --> 10:45.277
Oh yeah, it does already allow me with one click to add in the reverb, which I really like a lot.

10:45.798 --> 10:48.899
And I can do some of the things that I could do before, but a little bit better.

10:48.919 --> 10:58.183
And it's still got this old school English equalizer with the three or four knobs that I like a lot for adjusting some of the zoom and things that people have.

10:58.203 --> 11:01.725
Like Mike Eden's sound is always bad, and so it's nice if you can cut the treble way back.

11:02.935 --> 11:04.636
Anyway, thanks very much.

11:04.656 --> 11:05.597
Yes, Bob Moran.

11:06.277 --> 11:09.819
And yes, I am very, very happy with this signature.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.020
It's actually somewhere down there.

11:13.061 --> 11:13.881
It's a very nice thing.

11:13.922 --> 11:15.743
I actually paid for that though.

11:15.803 --> 11:22.826
Don't think that Bob knows all about GigaOM Biological and he watches and he sent me that on his own accord.

11:24.027 --> 11:26.649
There was a brief period of time where you could pay an extra 40 bucks.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.371
And then he would sign whatever he wanted to write.

11:29.431 --> 11:32.714
And I had all kinds of ideas of what I was going to have him write.

11:32.754 --> 11:35.336
But in the end, I thought that was the best idea.

11:35.376 --> 11:37.718
And I was also hoping that maybe Bob would try to check it out.

11:37.778 --> 11:38.258
So who knows?

11:38.318 --> 11:41.781
If you're watching, Bob, thanks for everything that you've done.

11:42.202 --> 11:42.942
I love your art.

11:43.002 --> 11:43.943
I hope you're rich from it.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.686
Keep speaking out.

11:48.247 --> 11:49.348
Yeah, January 6th.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.590
I'm going to switch down here.

11:52.571 --> 11:55.253
And I hope I couldn't do it quick enough.

11:56.210 --> 12:01.715
We are still here now where the COVID shots are bad, but we're not talking about 2020 and 2021.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.218
And so I feel like it's kind of my job.

12:04.278 --> 12:09.382
It's kind of other people's job to make sure that we don't lose sight of our recent history.

12:09.402 --> 12:14.467
One of the best reasons to argue that is that deep history is really hard.

12:16.311 --> 12:30.621
To know what people were reading in the 1700s and how popular a particular text was or how widely distributed it was or what political factions people were arguing about in cafes in the 1700s is pretty hard to know.

12:30.641 --> 12:36.905
You can write books about it, you can read books about it, but it's pretty hard to know.

12:38.499 --> 12:50.962
And because we all know the truth that the history is written by the victors, we can rest assured that if you get past 50 years or so, there is a narrative curation process that's going on.

12:52.322 --> 12:53.282
And there is no truth.

12:53.502 --> 12:59.424
If guns are dangerous, why would they give you the truth in the form of ideas in your own history, in your own identity?

12:59.464 --> 13:00.944
Why would they ever allow you to have that?

13:03.447 --> 13:12.150
And so I just, I feel like I need to keep beating this drum because I think more and more people need to hear it.

13:12.430 --> 13:14.411
And I think that it's starting to spread.

13:15.031 --> 13:19.933
And we are about to move on to YouTube with the JC on the hardwood series.

13:20.073 --> 13:24.955
And I think that's really starting to develop now over the Christmas break.

13:24.995 --> 13:27.456
I was able to make some arrangements with my gym owner.

13:28.217 --> 13:29.940
And he's pretty enthusiastic about it.

13:30.001 --> 13:31.484
I'm pretty enthusiastic about it.

13:31.704 --> 13:34.390
And I'm going to help him with some photography and a little bit of

13:35.566 --> 13:46.355
of social media work and as a result I'll get some access that I didn't have before and maybe a little bit less expensive because we have been paying for my boys to go there and it isn't cheap.

13:47.336 --> 13:58.665
But it's been the best idea of my recent adult life because it's brought my sons and I together on the basketball court where I had no idea as an adult I should have been years ago already.

13:58.705 --> 13:59.205
I gave it up.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.267
Why am I saying all this?

14:01.387 --> 14:10.094
I gave up basketball because I used to be really good at it and it was my excuse of, well, I can never be that good as I was when I was 23, so I don't want to play anymore.

14:12.609 --> 14:16.350
And after a while, that excuse has dissipated in my head.

14:16.610 --> 14:23.292
And playing with my boys, I've just rediscovered the love for that particular brand of movement.

14:24.152 --> 14:25.752
And now I can't get enough of it.

14:25.812 --> 14:30.733
I dress with basketball shorts every day and planning to go to the gym every day.

14:30.793 --> 14:33.634
And so I'm really happy about where things are.

14:33.654 --> 14:40.916
I'm very happy about where I am with my family and with my kids and with my wife and with life.

14:42.540 --> 14:48.645
I'm just very scared for the future because GigaOM Biological has 120 followers.

14:48.765 --> 14:55.751
125 paid subscribers plus four, you know, really committed donors every month.

14:57.152 --> 14:59.614
And it's a pretty precarious place to be.

14:59.754 --> 15:03.938
I love all of these people, but I also don't like the fact that they feel that too.

15:03.998 --> 15:04.839
I'm sure they must.

15:07.964 --> 15:21.449
And I think anybody was here for the live event and in my house for the live event, all the illusions about, um, you know, what three letter agency is paying for my family or how we're, we're grifting on this.

15:21.509 --> 15:31.773
It became very, very obvious, very, very quick when everybody saw the mess in this room and the mess upstairs and my kids and their bedrooms.

15:32.073 --> 15:35.074
And, and the illusion was broken.

15:35.134 --> 15:35.674
I assure you.

15:37.048 --> 15:44.010
And anybody that came here now and has been here with me for a while knows that this is all they got now.

15:45.030 --> 15:55.373
Now they're gonna try and tell you that Mark and I are part of the same infrastructure that supposedly Robert Malone and Meryl Nass are fighting against.

15:56.694 --> 16:04.716
That we're part of that elaborate meddler group that tries to break up dissident movements and prevent unity.

16:05.492 --> 16:14.119
That's what Brett Weinstein is saying about Cali and whatever means those two doctors, brother and sister that suddenly appeared on Tucker.

16:14.619 --> 16:16.461
But that's just as big of an illusion.

16:18.282 --> 16:22.906
Because the only truth is, is that we are controlled by these people on social media.

16:22.926 --> 16:24.848
And those are the people on social media.

16:24.868 --> 16:25.528
It's not me.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.093
I don't have six digit followers on any platform.

16:31.153 --> 16:35.016
So by definition, I can't be part of the military exercise.

16:37.423 --> 16:38.944
I don't control enough cats.

16:39.024 --> 16:42.107
I don't have the attention of enough cats is what I should say.

16:42.607 --> 16:43.708
You don't have to control them.

16:44.429 --> 16:46.050
You just have to occupy their mind.

16:46.070 --> 16:49.113
30,000 thoughts a day.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.176
Lex Friedman occupies a lot of thoughts per day.

16:53.616 --> 16:55.938
Joe Rogan occupies a lot of thoughts per day.

16:55.998 --> 16:59.301
Brett Weinstein is occupying ever more thoughts per day.

17:00.122 --> 17:03.825
Jordan Peterson occupies thoughts, all kinds of thoughts per day.

17:05.406 --> 17:06.367
And comparatively,

17:07.421 --> 17:18.495
People like Mark Kulak or myself, we occupy almost no one's thoughts per day, but except for the people who have followed us and found their way to our work, then those people are all in.

17:19.761 --> 17:26.225
And so this is an appeal to the 150, 250 people that are all in on this exercise.

17:26.245 --> 17:29.927
2025 in January, right now is the time.

17:30.547 --> 17:32.688
I don't need, well, yes, I do.

17:32.708 --> 17:37.951
I need your support, but the kind of support I need is spreading the word.

17:39.688 --> 17:52.517
sharing my work, sharing your favorite video, downloading it from PeerTube and sending it directly via email to your friends with a link to my website or to where they can subscribe or how they can find out.

17:53.438 --> 17:58.962
Maybe even try to get me on a Zoom meeting with some of these people that you know if you could convert them would support me.

17:59.682 --> 18:04.706
One at a time, we need to find people willing to pitch in 10 bucks a month.

18:06.187 --> 18:26.785
One at a time, we need to find people that are willing to pitch in 10 bucks a month because otherwise I'm never going to get to the self-sustainable level that I think this work needs to be at in order to move to the next level, which would be to have a place where we could meet and a regular sort of, you know, output.

18:27.679 --> 18:31.861
in the form of a PDF or a publication, or I don't know how many things we could do.

18:32.501 --> 18:41.745
But right now, my main concern is always paying the rent, figuring out how to keep the lease, the next lease low, and figuring out how to pay the light bills.

18:41.825 --> 18:45.027
This is not a, I don't have time for much else.

18:47.548 --> 18:56.612
And so, you know, just like Vincent Rackin' Yellow, and PBS NewsHour, and all these people with a sub stack,

18:58.339 --> 19:13.970
Gigon Biological needs your support more than any of them do because I'm not a retired ex-pharma executive turned lawyer like the head of HART, Jonathan Engler, who meddled with me for a year and a half.

19:14.050 --> 19:26.418
I'm not like Sasha Latapova, who's a retired pharma executive turned dissident on the team Robert Malone with a daughter who was promoted by Alex Jones in 2019

19:30.373 --> 19:43.123
I'm not Pierre Corey who promoted supplemental oxygen in 2020 and also supported the idea that George Floyd was suffocated by the cops with a legal affidavit.

19:46.726 --> 19:53.931
I mean, heck, I'm not even Denny Rancourt who spoke out about there being no rise in all-cause mortality in 2020 until after the shots were rolled out in 2021.

19:56.946 --> 20:20.551
I'm just some guy who lost his job at a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine faculty position for speaking out about a lab leak and about transfection and eventually figured out how much of an idiot I was and how much of a trap the lab leak idea was, the gain of function was, that the mystery solving exercise of what happened in 2019.

20:20.751 --> 20:23.671
That was how they got us.

20:24.211 --> 20:26.512
That's what this graphic is about behind me.

20:28.826 --> 20:35.371
about a virus from a laboratory that escaped sometime in late 2019 and then went around the earth and changed color every year.

20:36.591 --> 20:43.876
And we are now in 2025, the sixth year of this theater, and a significant portion of the earth still hasn't woken up to it.

20:46.518 --> 20:50.961
That is a very effective global military exercise.

20:52.683 --> 20:54.584
Nothing less than the most effective

20:56.920 --> 21:02.321
psychological campaign ever waged on humankind in multi-language ever.

21:05.462 --> 21:06.682
And nobody seems to notice.

21:06.722 --> 21:08.402
They're all just focused on the shots.

21:09.303 --> 21:10.123
Because they're bad.

21:13.444 --> 21:19.965
And I think there is a way to get our kids out of this if we can explain to them what's going on.

21:22.162 --> 21:26.183
We can explain to them the significance of the background or no background.

21:26.223 --> 21:33.385
There was no clean slate blank chalkboard in 2019 upon which a bunch of things were scribbled.

21:35.686 --> 21:49.450
It is not a gloriously blank background on which a novel coronavirus started to spread from a mud puddle to everyone, including white-tailed deer in North America and all the cats in all of the zoos.

21:53.140 --> 22:06.734
And one of the illusions that all of our children have and all of our mouth-breathing neighbors have that have been watching the PBS NewsHour is that the background is pretty much clear of anything until they lost something in Wuhan.

22:08.816 --> 22:09.857
And this is wrong.

22:11.699 --> 22:14.882
Even if you believe the state,

22:15.816 --> 22:25.949
global consensus about there being viruses, there was RNA in the form of viruses and phages in the background from the beginning until now.

22:27.475 --> 22:38.502
And one of the largest, biggest magic tricks that was done at the beginning of the pandemic and curated, this trick was curated by people on stage.

22:38.923 --> 22:47.388
You know, the pretty girls that go like this and show you the side of the box before they cut the box in half or the lady that gets in the box.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.369
That's what Kevin McKernan is.

22:51.291 --> 22:56.174
Kevin McKernan is the guy who has the lady get in the box and pretend to cut her in half.

22:57.691 --> 23:00.332
And the magic trick is that there was nothing to find.

23:00.392 --> 23:01.733
Now there's something to find.

23:01.773 --> 23:03.473
And it's just a matter of how you find it.

23:08.995 --> 23:25.962
And if you just draw it a little bit differently, instead of drawing it with their scary virus pictures, but instead you just drop a bunch of RNA in the background, this is what they did not justifiably do, which is pull a signal out of the background

23:27.051 --> 23:30.954
and show you that it was different than the background.

23:32.155 --> 23:33.457
Now you might say, yeah, wait a minute.

23:33.857 --> 23:36.379
Kevin McKernan was on the Danny Jones podcast.

23:36.419 --> 23:42.204
And he said that PCR tests were using three different target gene sequences.

23:42.264 --> 23:47.008
And then at some point for Omicron, they didn't find the spike protein anymore.

23:47.048 --> 23:48.389
And they called that Omicron.

23:48.429 --> 23:50.231
Or he kind of said that, but not really.

23:50.731 --> 23:52.012
But there are three targets.

23:52.773 --> 23:53.634
And that's a lie.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.803
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

23:57.883 --> 23:58.723
Oh, I gotta reset this.

23:58.763 --> 23:59.243
Oh, darn it.

24:01.524 --> 24:02.204
That's a lie.

24:04.304 --> 24:08.666
And that's a huge lie that needs to be understood in a very detailed way.

24:08.686 --> 24:14.567
It would require somebody to explain it in a very detailed way, which I've attempted to do a few times.

24:14.607 --> 24:16.968
I'm just resetting this music over here, I apologize.

24:19.329 --> 24:22.130
And I gotta test my... There we go.

24:24.997 --> 24:42.115
because they needed to tell you, explain to you, these proprietary emergency use authorized Chinese produced products that were used to diagnose and track the spread of this novel pathogen in 2020 and 2021 was not usefully opposed

24:46.079 --> 24:58.472
by Claire Craig of Heart or Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project or Brett Weinstein of the Intellectual Dark Web or Robert Malone of DITRA.

25:01.457 --> 25:17.483
None of these people ever have attempted to explain how these over 200 emergency use authorized PCR tests in America were able to differentiate the novel RNA from all the background RNA.

25:18.264 --> 25:23.806
And instead, very, very, very studiously worked

25:24.778 --> 25:31.762
to make sure that no one had a suitable model to understand that challenge.

25:32.922 --> 25:37.685
Because that challenge would require multiple, multiple targets.

25:38.165 --> 25:41.127
That challenge would require nested primers.

25:42.093 --> 25:58.941
That challenge might even require sequencing the amplicons after PCR to be sure that the amplified sequence was the one that you thought it was and that it wasn't just the primers pulling out something from the background related to it or sequentially related to the primers.

26:00.796 --> 26:12.587
And if you're thinking, wow, I don't even understand what he's talking about, that's because Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and every other person with any level of expertise has never attempted to explain it to you.

26:13.507 --> 26:16.810
And you probably missed the three or four streams where I tried to explain it to you.

26:18.332 --> 26:25.118
But the bottom line is, is in 2020, if you think about this background as I've just drawn it here,

26:27.190 --> 26:35.697
And they released something in 2019 or found something in 2019 by simply making a lot of it and then putting it somewhere.

26:36.537 --> 26:42.482
You know, a small Eppendorf tube with a few grams of any DNA that they wanted could be put anywhere they wanted.

26:42.522 --> 26:43.643
It would be pretty stable.

26:44.124 --> 26:48.267
And if they used PCR directed to it to find it, they would certainly find it.

26:49.915 --> 27:14.949
And so let's just come up with the most sinister and evil scenario, where Moderna and NIH designed some kind of designer protein with the help of EpiVax's special epitopes, so that when they put this little epitope into any protein that they wanted to, the body would have a hard time ignoring it, and every time it saw that protein, it would produce antibodies to it.

27:15.859 --> 27:29.592
so that essentially they would have a secret trick that they could put into any biologic that they made and meet the very standard of the NIH for an immunogen, something that generates a seroprevalence response to it.

27:31.034 --> 27:39.082
So you have this NIH and they have this, you know, this surrogates for immunity or correlates of immunity and most of the time it's antibodies.

27:40.083 --> 27:53.520
And so then you have separately this idea and this study of why and how does the body choose the particular epitope to which it makes an antibody response and how do you get that to reliably happen.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.947
And you'll find that Robert Malone's paths cross with EpiVax.

27:57.987 --> 28:03.110
And you'll find that Robert Malone's paths cross with Inovio.

28:03.170 --> 28:22.482
And you'll find that all of these things lead back to all of these people from Kevin McKernan to Robert Malone to Merrill Nass, knowing that one of the things they can do because of the Human Genome Project is make some pure DNA, as much as they want, actually, with very standard recombinant methods that include

28:23.021 --> 28:25.582
growing bacterial plasmids in bacteria.

28:27.122 --> 28:43.207
One of the things that Kevin McKernan is talking about right now is evidence of the plasmids in the RNA shot as contaminants, as adulteration, is that they can see the origins of replication for these plasmids as they are used in the bacterial cultures.

28:44.247 --> 29:02.740
Again, inadvertently, indirectly admitting that I have been right for several years that actually the only danger and the big difference between anything that might or might not be done in a virology lab with anything taken out of an animal like a bat anus and recombinant virology

29:03.720 --> 29:14.450
is that when Shengxi Li takes her swab and puts it in an Eppendorf tube and then tries to extract a sequence, she can never really get that sequence to grow into a pure quantity of itself.

29:18.775 --> 29:28.284
She can never get that sequence to grow into a pure quantity of itself that she could share with her family and friends or her fellow virology researchers around the world.

29:31.272 --> 29:37.357
Kevin McKernan and Merrill Nass and Robert Malone all are sophisticated.

29:39.098 --> 29:52.248
Jessica Rose is sophisticated enough to know that it doesn't matter what virus sequence they find in the wild, they can never get that sequence, no matter how good of a sample they do or how many bats they poke.

29:53.186 --> 30:01.129
They can never get that sequence to grow a large, pure quantity of itself, no matter what cells they grow it in, even if it's 06 cells.

30:03.990 --> 30:09.932
The only way that they can get a large, pure quantity of that genome is to make it.

30:11.493 --> 30:21.657
And they make it in the way that Bryan Artis would say that they make all the venom proteins that they're putting in all this stuff, or making pounds of, I guess, to kill us with.

30:23.234 --> 30:32.296
But for some reason, Brian Artis can't explain that RNA cannot pandemic, but mankind can make a lot of DNA and mankind can make a lot of RNA.

30:35.156 --> 30:36.496
And PCR works.

30:37.997 --> 30:39.037
It's not perfect.

30:40.177 --> 30:44.198
It's not a great diagnostic, but PCR, how it is used works.

30:44.298 --> 30:49.959
It makes a fluorescent signal and that fluorescent signal goes through a period of exponential growth.

30:51.733 --> 31:05.027
And so if you give them these correlates as outcomes, and you trust their proprietary primers to be pulling out something that isn't already there, then I guess you believe that RNA can pandemic.

31:06.008 --> 31:10.352
But if you understand that there's a background signal, and that in 2020, and 2021, and all the way up until now,

31:12.526 --> 31:21.148
Nobody, because of proprietary reasons, is able to evaluate whether or not they are doing something that they say they're doing, which is pulling this signal from a background.

31:21.848 --> 31:22.729
Back to the story.

31:22.769 --> 31:40.533
If they wanted to use a background signal like this, and they wanted to put, say, 18 additional amino acids or 19 additional amino acids into that protein because that would make it an exceptional immunogen, and then find it somewhere and say,

31:42.128 --> 31:50.695
that it was novel, knowing all along that the whole world doesn't know that there's a background there of the exact same shape, missing 19 amino acids.

31:50.735 --> 31:55.078
But when you pull it up with PCR, those 19 amino acids are trivial.

31:56.640 --> 32:03.645
Because of course, you're gonna use the most conserved regions of that protein, which don't change across this background signal.

32:04.746 --> 32:08.429
You're gonna use the end protein because that doesn't change with the background signal.

32:10.131 --> 32:18.900
Did they ever tell you what was specific about the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the N-protein of OC43?

32:18.960 --> 32:25.487
No, they didn't because there's probably nothing significantly different between them.

32:26.323 --> 32:33.746
Did they tell you the difference between how different the spike protein of this one was from other spike proteins?

32:34.566 --> 32:37.587
Well, with bat viruses, yes, but not with the human coronavirus.

32:39.088 --> 32:48.812
So there's a lot of things that they didn't talk about on purpose, because again, if the goal is to confound a background signal with novel spread,

32:50.103 --> 32:58.889
and you have a spectacular commitment to lies on your hands, then all you gotta do in 2020 is claim that you found what you found.

32:58.909 --> 33:00.470
You only have to find it in one place.

33:00.510 --> 33:15.581
And as long as it has significant sequence overlap with that background, then you can complain all you want about the furin cleavage site and complain all you want about the HIV inserts when in reality, the amplicon

33:16.448 --> 33:21.029
which is the small portion of the target sequence that you amplify.

33:21.669 --> 33:24.350
The amplicon was not the furin cleavage site.

33:25.510 --> 33:28.291
The amplicon was not the HIV inserts.

33:28.371 --> 33:39.554
The amplicon was the most shared sequence in the background with whatever they already understood as the background, and it was announced as evidence.

33:40.935 --> 33:45.336
Remember that the Chinese just used metagenomic sequencing to pull up the rest of this.

33:46.141 --> 33:48.022
this background, they found the spike.

33:48.082 --> 33:49.723
The spike was a very big signal.

33:50.944 --> 33:53.025
The rest was done with metagenomic sequencing.

33:54.366 --> 34:02.371
And if you planted a particularly pure signal of that spike protein, metagenomic sequencing would sort it out pretty nicely.

34:03.652 --> 34:08.496
It's just what metagenomic sequencing does with noise that's very shady.

34:09.077 --> 34:12.559
It's not that metagenomic sequencing can't find a hot signal.

34:12.599 --> 34:13.520
It definitely can.

34:13.981 --> 34:16.763
That's how there's this bamboozlement happening.

34:17.793 --> 34:44.774
People don't understand the way that these algorithms work and how a planted signal could be used on the background of this algorithm to make it seem like, wow, there's a whole new thing back there, when all they really did was add their epitope to the background so that when they said, look, we're just gonna take 45 minutes and design a quick protein, add a proline here and a disulfide bond there, and then we'll have our vaccine ready to go.

34:46.940 --> 34:59.914
And what's curious about it is we'll also have our tests ready to go and there's already, the tests will find what's in the background because they're not specific for the new signal and nobody ever monitored it.

35:01.428 --> 35:04.910
Did you hear on the nightly news when the furin cleavage site went away?

35:05.510 --> 35:18.498
Even though Charles Rixey was convinced for the first three years and longer, I guess, till now, that the furin cleavage site is what made it able to go around the world and change colors repeatedly for years and years and infect all of the white-tailed deer.

35:19.479 --> 35:21.240
The most contagious virus ever.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.602
So why didn't we monitor the furin cleavage site?

35:24.622 --> 35:27.444
Because once it went away, we could have said, you know, all clear.

35:28.965 --> 35:30.706
Because it's a lie.

35:32.216 --> 35:37.279
And so what they did was they released a pure signal so that they knew what they were going to find.

35:37.379 --> 35:46.065
Maybe that pure signal was something that was advantageous to the appearance of effectiveness in these transfections.

35:46.145 --> 35:53.750
So a reliable epitope may be provided by EpiVax and Robert Malone or may be provided by some other research at NIH.

35:53.770 --> 35:54.271
Who cares?

35:55.885 --> 35:57.266
We know that they're doing that stuff.

35:57.306 --> 36:07.251
The point is, is if that background was there and on that background, they released this signal that they wanted to try out in transfection, then the Chinese would have found it.

36:08.791 --> 36:12.673
And we could have said, oh, well, I guess it's there and it's spreading everywhere.

36:14.134 --> 36:18.116
But all the while your tests are just pulling that background and you weren't testing in these years.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.397
You just started testing in 2020.

36:22.728 --> 36:32.253
And of course, now that we are supposedly transfecting people to the thing that this PCR test is supposed to be specific for, I mean, how much background is there now?

36:32.313 --> 36:33.453
What is the known background?

36:33.493 --> 36:35.654
What was the E protein background before 2020?

36:36.875 --> 36:39.036
What was the N protein background before 2020?

36:39.376 --> 36:41.477
What was the S protein background before 2020?

36:42.278 --> 36:45.279
What about the RNA dependent RNA polymerase background in 2020?

36:45.359 --> 36:46.040
What about that?

36:49.315 --> 37:05.366
How were these 220 EUA-granted PCR tests and lateral flow diagnostics, most of which produced in China, how were they accurately differentiating this background and the new signal?

37:05.406 --> 37:05.946
They weren't.

37:07.227 --> 37:18.215
It becomes very obvious now that they weren't, they never were, and that's why it becomes very important to understand why it is criminal evidence

37:19.301 --> 37:34.254
that Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Mike Yeadon and Thomas Binder and Peter Borger and all these, and there's another German guy on there.

37:34.535 --> 37:35.916
There's a bunch of authors.

37:35.956 --> 37:45.905
We need to ask all of those people, how the hell, how the heck was this group of authors assembled across borders

37:48.058 --> 37:49.299
Why did you assemble?

37:49.359 --> 37:50.780
Who's the one who wrote the paper?

37:50.840 --> 37:52.422
Who contributed to the discussion?

37:52.462 --> 37:53.903
How many Zoom meetings were there?

37:54.463 --> 37:55.905
Did you record any of them?

37:57.466 --> 38:07.935
Because those people did not, did not differentiate from the background, did not make an argument about a background.

38:08.555 --> 38:09.396
Not even Mike Eden.

38:11.558 --> 38:13.759
That paper was exclusively about

38:14.693 --> 38:23.757
the extremely fast review process for the PCR test proposed by Drosten in Germany and accepted by the WHO.

38:25.118 --> 38:34.202
And it was about the primer dimers and the other methodological problems with the protocol proposed by Drosten and accepted by the WHO.

38:35.202 --> 38:39.244
It in no way, shape, or form did it question the foundational myth

38:40.083 --> 39:02.468
that these PCR tests would be able to differentiate a signal from the background, that there was a signal to differentiate from the background, that a signal in RNA was even remotely biologically possible, but instead accepted all of those premises, instead arguing about the details of the diagnostic tests.

39:05.188 --> 39:19.576
And remember that this occurred on the background of 200 emergency use authorized proprietary products, diagnostic testing in America alone.

39:20.656 --> 39:26.399
200 diagnostic test products were in America perpetuating this myth.

39:27.019 --> 39:33.483
And none of these people, not Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone, Steve Kirsch, Kevin McKernan, Kevin McCairn, Charles Rixey, none of them

39:34.531 --> 39:51.569
Only me was usefully questioning the basic idea that the diagnostic was differentiating something significant from a background, as opposed to just turning a background into a mythological something significant.

39:53.356 --> 39:54.937
That's where I was in July of 2020.

39:55.678 --> 40:04.385
And if it wasn't for these people coming to my house and paying me salaries and asking me to write book chapters, I would have been there the whole five years.

40:04.425 --> 40:08.748
And I apologize to everyone I didn't save, including my friend, Nathan.

40:12.351 --> 40:21.458
But this is the most likely, most parsimonious explanation, a background signal misconstrued as a novel spreading thing.

40:22.875 --> 40:35.201
And the easiest and best way to see through it is that none of these people usefully objected to the use of PCR as a diagnostic, nor did they ever present this as a possibility.

40:35.321 --> 40:35.841
None of them.

40:36.682 --> 40:40.444
Not the brilliant and multi-talented Jessica Rose.

40:43.425 --> 40:45.706
Not Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project.

40:48.688 --> 40:49.508
Not Robert Malone.

40:50.560 --> 40:56.767
not Meryl Nass, not Robert F. Kennedy Jr., not Mary Holland, none of them.

41:06.819 --> 41:11.344
The important thing to remember, ladies and gentlemen, is that background signal could also be ours.

41:13.663 --> 41:25.486
They could have just been looking at the RNA, the whole RNA signal after pneumonia or during pneumonia and selecting a signal which would show up repeatedly.

41:25.946 --> 41:28.247
The signal could have been a bacteriophage signal.

41:29.027 --> 41:33.869
The signal could have been an RNA dependent RNA polymerase signal or an end protein signal.

41:34.409 --> 41:38.190
And the source of the signal would not necessarily even matter.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.567
It could be a signal from our own mucus.

41:41.647 --> 41:47.610
It could be a signal from a particular kind of bacteria that lives in a majority of people's lungs.

41:47.710 --> 41:48.591
It doesn't matter.

41:50.271 --> 42:00.337
The point is that this background, be it bacteriophages in your gut and in your saliva and in your mucus, or

42:01.736 --> 42:16.006
exosome signaling from your immune system or any other source of RNA, including the bacteria in your, in your body and on your skin, the bacteria in your environment, in the air, it doesn't matter.

42:16.086 --> 42:19.688
The point is this, they never made a name, never made an attempt to.

42:20.268 --> 42:25.512
And once this thing started, they put people in place that would never ever question it.

42:27.608 --> 42:38.596
That's why Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project was on podcast after podcast in 2020 telling everybody about how PCR works to diagnose this, well, not so novel virus.

42:38.616 --> 42:40.297
It might've been around in 2019.

42:43.239 --> 42:44.020
That's what he said.

42:47.282 --> 42:49.323
And so it doesn't matter where the background comes from.

42:49.363 --> 42:55.148
It just matters that they know what it is so that when they tell you what they found, it already fits into the puzzle.

42:55.851 --> 43:00.776
When they tell you how the phylogenetic tree has progressed, it fits into the puzzle.

43:03.619 --> 43:12.008
They had 10 years to do it since the first time they released a clone in 2002 and tried to track it around the world for 700 patients or so.

43:15.896 --> 43:17.838
if that's what happened in 2002.

43:18.559 --> 43:20.922
You could think of that as a single clone unit.

43:21.683 --> 43:31.533
Maybe it was a little propane tank full of the sequence they wanted to find, and they released it on an apartment building in China, and then they tracked it around the world.

43:31.593 --> 43:32.695
Ooh, wow, that worked pretty well.

43:34.212 --> 43:36.494
And that was also just a signal on the background.

43:36.554 --> 43:41.378
How long would they be able to track the novel signal from the background?

43:41.418 --> 43:42.819
How long would it be loud enough?

43:42.899 --> 43:45.101
How long would the PCR signal be loud enough?

43:45.121 --> 43:46.261
Maybe they fooled around with that.

43:46.382 --> 43:47.062
I don't know.

43:50.325 --> 44:02.754
But what I know is that if anything moved in 2002, it was moving from a ultra pure, high quantity of a single,

44:03.943 --> 44:09.085
RNA sequence that could not exist in nature and could not be produced by natural means.

44:09.125 --> 44:20.448
It would only be by commercial means that such a large quantity would be produced and therefore only such a large quantity could enter this background and be seen for a while, detected for a while.

44:21.328 --> 44:27.510
This is not me saying that there are viruses, but this is definitely me saying that we don't understand how that would work.

44:28.823 --> 44:53.425
And definitely somebody like Robert Malone or Claire Craig or Jonathan Engler or Nick Hudson, none of these people are thinking about these ideas based on the fact that one of the only things we can do, one of the only things that every pharmaceutical company that makes any biologic can do, is that they can make a lot of DNA and they can make a lot of RNA.

44:54.086 --> 44:55.167
And that's all you need.

45:00.646 --> 45:02.827
And so transfecting kids, it's a crime.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.668
And they knew that from the very beginning.

45:05.548 --> 45:06.909
So the lie's gotta be big.

45:07.950 --> 45:10.051
The lie's gotta be really big.

45:10.291 --> 45:17.314
It's not gain of function and scary viruses and all kinds of crazy biology.

45:17.474 --> 45:19.155
It is a giant lie about that.

45:21.769 --> 45:27.294
And that's how we got here where no one, no one is yet saying RNA cannot pandemic.

45:27.414 --> 45:29.956
No one, not even the no virus people will take that on.

45:30.016 --> 45:33.980
Not the mythology one, not the transfection part, none of it.

45:34.520 --> 45:47.012
And they won't take on the part about infectious clones being just a semantic disguise for recombinant DNA and transfection of cell culture because that's what virology is.

45:48.596 --> 45:57.980
even if the sequences that they find in the background are real, in order for them to pretend to study them, they need to use recombinant methods to make enough.

45:59.681 --> 46:03.762
And once they do that, they're not doing natural stuff anymore.

46:03.782 --> 46:12.206
They're not working on the natural signal anymore, and they're not ever going to figure out anything useful about whatever that signal is in the background, if it is anything at all.

46:14.249 --> 46:18.792
My guess is, is because of metabiota, it's very hard for me to believe that it's anything at all.

46:18.832 --> 46:20.873
I think they're misconstruing it completely.

46:21.794 --> 46:25.956
And it is much more likely that that signal is produced by pattern integrities.

46:26.016 --> 46:28.698
It is not a pattern integrity by itself, of course.

46:30.179 --> 46:38.764
Which is what it would be if it was evolving by itself, and that the new variants were working together now, as Nature Communications is telling us.

46:39.044 --> 46:40.025
This is all nonsense.

46:45.916 --> 46:47.356
And so what is the known background?

46:47.376 --> 46:49.377
We will never be told this.

46:49.617 --> 46:56.279
Kevin McKernan will never, you know, devolve into this level of understanding and this level of explanation.

46:56.319 --> 47:04.001
He's not going to go there because from 2020, his job was to make sure that people never usefully questioned PCR as a diagnostic.

47:04.061 --> 47:07.722
Maybe that's why Kerry Mullis was killed in 2019.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.203
Maybe because he was a loose end.

47:10.243 --> 47:12.644
As goofy as he was, he still knew it was bullshit.

47:15.165 --> 47:18.306
So they took a background signal and they misconstrued it as spread.

47:18.346 --> 47:20.427
They murdered people and lied about it.

47:21.848 --> 47:23.129
And RNA cannot pandemic.

47:23.149 --> 47:23.989
That's what I'm sure of.

47:25.630 --> 47:28.291
And so they use these weaponized piles of money to do that.

47:28.451 --> 47:32.173
And that weaponized piles of money, they paid people to be on social media.

47:32.233 --> 47:33.514
They participated in that.

47:33.554 --> 47:35.795
We participated in arguing with those people.

47:35.835 --> 47:38.516
And by doing that, we accepted their narrative by default.

47:39.534 --> 47:43.216
That's how we've come to understand the wrong history about World War II.

47:43.256 --> 47:52.362
That's how we've come to understand, you know, Israel the way we understand it and Ukraine the way we understand it is not a useful understanding because that history is false.

47:53.443 --> 47:54.744
And do I know that history?

47:54.824 --> 47:55.525
No, I don't.

47:56.665 --> 48:00.868
But I don't think you can start Googling it and in a few days understand that history.

48:00.888 --> 48:02.269
It's not available like that.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.071
You got to work harder than that.

48:06.452 --> 48:08.193
It's more than just scrolling.

48:15.370 --> 48:26.378
I've rediscovered a word that somebody sent me an essay a while back that I read and was really moved by and then kind of forgot about because of all the things that are going on in the background.

48:27.439 --> 48:33.023
You can Google it and find that essay really easy by just Googling slave speak, the anatomy of slave speak.

48:34.344 --> 48:35.504
That's where we are right now.

48:35.545 --> 48:43.030
And I think it's an absolutely brilliant metaphor for the same thing that I've been trying to argue about, these weaponized piles of money.

48:45.376 --> 48:48.538
They give us words, and the words have meaning.

48:48.598 --> 48:53.260
And as long as we use those words and try to argue with them, we are always going to lose.

48:53.320 --> 49:05.807
And that's what's so scary, I think, for them about my work, is that I'm trying to find and redefine words, retake back words that have been monopolized by them for a couple decades.

49:07.273 --> 49:19.524
and form the basis for this slave speak, especially the slave speak with regard to our children, the slave speak with regard to our biology, the slave speak with regard to evolution.

49:20.555 --> 49:23.958
And that's what I think this list is behind there.

49:24.078 --> 49:27.161
And I, you know, you can think of these things as kind of slave speak, you know.

49:28.061 --> 49:31.825
Both sides have come to agree that a feeble, sick, unfit president must step down.

49:32.905 --> 49:34.367
All the slaves believe that now.

49:34.467 --> 49:39.051
Both sides of the coin believe that, you know, that was really despicable what they did with Briden.

49:39.091 --> 49:40.392
They should be ashamed of themselves.

49:41.493 --> 49:55.596
But interestingly, both sides have also come to agree that Israel, Ukraine, climate virus, pandemic, endemic, America, the dollar, cryptocurrency are all ideas with real meanings.

49:55.716 --> 50:03.978
And unfortunately, most Americans have a very slave speak definition for a lot of these words.

50:04.318 --> 50:10.920
Just saying the words already provokes the cage bars and they become instantly

50:12.901 --> 50:16.862
materialize right before your eyes just by using these words.

50:16.922 --> 50:24.545
As soon as you start arguing within the context of their Ukraine, the cage bars around your consciousness are solid.

50:25.225 --> 50:30.427
As soon as you start arguing about the dollar, your cage, it becomes more solid.

50:30.467 --> 50:37.129
As soon as you start arguing about endemic or pandemic or virus, the cage bars become solid.

50:39.366 --> 51:02.561
And so one of the things that I think we have managed to accomplish, maybe Mark and I, or Mark and I and a few other people, whoever's sharing our work and working with us, like Scott and Joe and all of our followers, we've been able to shake some of those bars, break some of those bars, the bars of the novel virus, the bars of a pandemic, the bars of endemicity.

51:05.323 --> 51:08.425
Mark might even be doing a lot of work to break the,

51:09.170 --> 51:12.318
the illusion of what America is that I don't mean in the sense of

51:13.860 --> 51:15.201
Of of wrecking america.

51:15.281 --> 51:22.224
I mean in the sense of what's what's motivating the left and the right right now in america How do we understand what's going on?

51:22.924 --> 51:33.709
And it's very hard for the right in america right now to see that they too are being played It's easy to look over to the other side to the people with the blue flags And say wow, those people have really been fooled.

51:34.189 --> 51:42.173
They really they really bought into something They should have never bought into they can't It's harder to see that in yourself, but I can see it in both sides

51:43.406 --> 51:46.292
Um, and it's Slavespeak.

51:49.018 --> 51:50.340
Slavespeak 225 is uh...

51:53.052 --> 51:58.056
Vaccine and vaccination, it's climate change, it's artificial intelligence, it's neural link, it's algorithms.

51:58.956 --> 52:06.082
People on social media think they understand these big concepts and think that they can explain these big concepts to their kids.

52:06.602 --> 52:14.448
And the most scary part is when their kids ask a question about these ideas, they will give them the answer that is slave speak.

52:21.437 --> 52:28.163
And I think slave speak right now is largely curated by academia and by medicine, by doctors and by lawyers.

52:31.066 --> 52:34.429
So we have a priesthood of sorts that sits above politicians.

52:34.469 --> 52:36.851
The politicians are becoming more and more idiots.

52:38.012 --> 52:46.040
And the priest class above them, which sits between them and the elites, are people that control us using words, not violence anymore, but words.

52:47.944 --> 52:58.469
And they curate the meaning of those words through an illusion of consensus by agreeing to lie to us together, coordinatedly.

53:00.410 --> 53:03.072
And most of the people in academia don't know they're doing it.

53:04.492 --> 53:07.254
I didn't know I was doing it before the pandemic started.

53:07.294 --> 53:08.474
I didn't know I was doing it in 2022.

53:10.239 --> 53:15.062
or in 2021 when I thought I was fighting a possible lab leak.

53:15.102 --> 53:22.486
I thought I was fighting a possible aberrant evolution of a lab leak because of a stupid transfection.

53:28.470 --> 53:30.751
And so ladies and gentlemen, it's gonna take a lot of work.

53:30.811 --> 53:39.557
Everybody's gonna have to do the work in order to stop speaking slave speak and then to hear when you are speaking it and then how to designate it as such.

53:40.390 --> 53:45.474
It's tough work and it's only something that I'm just scratching the surface of now.

53:46.754 --> 53:57.682
But there is no doubt in my mind now that these myths perpetuated by traitors are simply hiding murder with lies.

53:58.282 --> 54:07.629
The murder being this problem of the baby boomer generation after World War II having big families as they aged out.

54:08.683 --> 54:11.685
they could have potentially bankrupt many Western nations.

54:13.446 --> 54:23.872
And the lopsided shape of our population pyramid has a brief level of pain in it that our bankrupt nations could not sustain.

54:23.932 --> 54:25.412
This had to be managed.

54:27.374 --> 54:31.516
And more importantly, managed, but it was also just an opportunity to be used.

54:31.576 --> 54:32.897
These numbers were gonna go up.

54:33.397 --> 54:36.859
The question is, what were they gonna tell us the numbers were going up for?

54:38.223 --> 55:04.117
And I believe that's why all the actuaries that are actually anywhere on social media, and I'm talking to Dodd and people who pretend to do actuarial numbers like Denny Rancor or actuaries like Nick Hudson, they all, the ones that are prominent on social media around the world, especially on X and in these crazy little groups like Panda and Heart, all of them

55:04.878 --> 55:08.419
None of them will ever mention this problem.

55:10.420 --> 55:15.542
None of them will ever mention this problem that in 1974 was obvious.

55:18.523 --> 55:21.545
And even after it's pointed out to them, they won't mention it.

55:22.625 --> 55:29.748
And the same with those people that have talked to me for all those years and all those pictures, they won't take this

55:31.414 --> 55:41.357
very succinct explanation and critique it, sharpen it, correct it, criticize it, show me how I'm wrong on all of these things.

55:41.437 --> 55:41.817
No, no.

55:42.957 --> 55:56.021
They do everything they can to try and find some trivial mistake that I made or some clip that can be misconstrued as a trivial mistake and then just post that as what I do all day.

55:57.045 --> 56:01.938
instead of just saying that, you know what, Jay's kind of a creep, but he gets it right on that one slide with all the smoke.

56:08.476 --> 56:12.498
The reason why they won't do it, ladies and gentlemen, is because this illusion is going to go on.

56:12.619 --> 56:17.441
So I got a couple videos I want to watch with you to show you how this illusion is going to go on.

56:18.622 --> 56:20.423
I'm going to pause this one when I need to.

56:21.924 --> 56:27.447
This is just a video from Quantum Magazine about the 2024 in biology.

56:27.608 --> 56:29.849
And it's hilarious to me.

56:38.208 --> 56:42.790
you have an ancestor that lived billions of years ago, who goes by the name of Luca.

56:43.710 --> 56:48.071
Luca is the last universal common ancestor to all modern life on Earth.

56:48.091 --> 56:55.914
Including us, including bacteria, frogs, fish, trees, fungi, everything is alive and it has a cell.

56:56.054 --> 57:04.777
In a 2024 paper, researchers peered back in time to paint the most complete picture of Luca yet, using evidence from a wide range of scientific disciplines.

57:05.444 --> 57:11.173
I came up with a holistic understanding of when LUCA existed and how it interacted with the environment.

57:11.874 --> 57:13.156
So what was LUCA like?

57:14.378 --> 57:21.300
Ever since scientists realized that all life on Earth shares certain characteristics, that suggested to us that there was some common ancestor.

57:22.160 --> 57:30.102
Darwin, in fact, in one of his letters said that if you trace his idea of evolution back to the very beginning, that would imply that there was some common ancestor.

57:30.962 --> 57:35.103
So it was really Darwin who first started thinking about what that universal ancestor could have looked like.

57:36.184 --> 57:41.165
Yeah, the trouble with that is, is that Darwin didn't really like that idea.

57:42.782 --> 57:54.770
He liked the idea of microevolution, you know, explaining how finch beaks change and stuff like that, but he didn't really like that idea that you could get from something, from nothing to something with that same mechanism.

57:55.250 --> 58:00.574
I mean, so again, regularly people will do this and I think I would have done it before 2020.

58:01.294 --> 58:10.220
Had you put me in front of a camera and asked me these questions, I would have spouted out the same kind of neo-Darwinism or, or sorry, is that neo-Darwinism or old Darwinism or,

58:10.800 --> 58:16.155
traditional Darwinism that it explains everything, especially now that in the 50s we found DNA.

58:17.580 --> 58:25.545
So again, this is just the accepted presumption upon which Biology 101 is based.

58:25.685 --> 58:32.048
And so we're just hearing a recapitulation of Biology 101, specifically evolution because DNA.

58:32.548 --> 58:40.173
And now if you assume evolution because DNA, then whatever you find here is what you find here, and you explain it in that context.

58:40.213 --> 58:45.636
But it is not edifying evidence for it at all.

58:46.903 --> 58:51.265
All the evidence we have now cannot be dated, it's all current.

58:54.247 --> 58:57.548
All the DNA sequences on Earth right now are current.

59:01.030 --> 59:03.451
All the animals on Earth right now are current.

59:03.931 --> 59:06.333
All the fossils on Earth right now are current.

59:07.993 --> 59:14.817
And the way that we date them and how we talk about dating them is all speculative, pseudoscience.

59:16.400 --> 59:23.005
and probably a large body of factually incorrect information thought of as knowledge.

59:23.445 --> 59:27.348
And we have been building our castle on this for generations now.

59:29.829 --> 59:31.270
And it's not by accident.

59:31.290 --> 59:40.377
It is because people are governed by mythologies, because the organized habits and opinions of the masses are something that needs to be regularly manipulated.

59:40.437 --> 59:44.840
And the people who do it are the real governing power of our republic.

59:48.052 --> 59:50.274
And so they need you bamboozled by the biology.

59:50.314 --> 59:52.195
They need you to not understand.

59:53.516 --> 59:58.460
They need you to think that all the questions have been answered and that we understand everything.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.424
And so you might as well just surrender to them because you're not going to be able to read enough books to catch up.

01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:18.845
not the origin of life on Earth, but the emergence of life as we know it today.

01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:21.287
And Luca was not alone.

01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:26.051
We can think of Luca as more like a population rather than like a single individual.

01:00:26.191 --> 01:00:34.398
And there probably were many different types of organisms living at that time, whose descendants later died out fairly shortly thereafter, or maybe died out only recently.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:38.580
But Luca survived and went on to evolve into all modern life.

01:00:38.881 --> 01:00:50.408
See, that's already the whole idea that this is bridging a gap between the lightning bolt that hit a mud puddle and the first eukaryote prokaryote that then split into those two groups.

01:00:50.928 --> 01:01:02.876
And so we're talking about one of these things again, where if you're given an infinite time and an infinite what if and an infinite failure rate, then eventually a room full of monkeys will write Shakespeare.

01:01:03.863 --> 01:01:07.427
It is absolutely no different than that.

01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:13.014
And it's all because we found DNA.

01:01:13.094 --> 01:01:14.235
Evolution because DNA.

01:01:14.515 --> 01:01:15.356
Yo, yo, yo.

01:01:16.618 --> 01:01:19.661
All this stuff is real because evolution, because that's it.

01:01:19.982 --> 01:01:22.465
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

01:01:24.727 --> 01:01:34.682
And the trick is, is that since we've been in high school, they've been telling us this over and over and over again in the biology 101 textbook, where they start from the bottom and they build up.

01:01:35.784 --> 01:01:39.169
And they say, you know, cells and then tissues and then organs, and then.

01:01:44.045 --> 01:01:44.725
It's remarkable.

01:01:44.745 --> 01:01:45.386
We're gonna get out.

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:46.606
We're gonna get our kids out.

01:01:46.626 --> 01:01:52.188
Today, there are two domains of cellular life descended from LUCA, prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

01:01:52.729 --> 01:01:57.491
Prokaryotes include bacteria and archaea, which are comparatively simple cells.

01:01:58.442 --> 01:02:03.548
Eukaryotes are more complex and include all forms of complex multicellular life.

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:05.891
You know, we're paleontologists, most of us.

01:02:06.092 --> 01:02:09.416
We're interested in understanding early evolutionary history.

01:02:09.756 --> 01:02:14.302
However, we can only really get back at this ancestral point, looking at modern organisms.

01:02:14.482 --> 01:02:22.308
To reveal our evolutionary history, Edmund Moody, Phil Donahue and their team sought to reconstruct Luca's genome, or collection of genes.

01:02:22.508 --> 01:02:30.455
And then from these, try and build kind of like a working metabolic network and then use this as a basis to try and understand what Luca would have been like.

01:02:30.975 --> 01:02:39.222
Their approach involved filling out an evolutionary family tree based on the genomic relationships among 700 living bacterial and archaean species.

01:02:39.642 --> 01:02:44.424
What we need to do is infer a tree of those 700 species, those 700 genomes.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:52.968
In order to do that, you need to pull out genes, which we think have evolved very slowly, been very conserved, haven't changed much over the billions of years.

01:02:53.608 --> 01:03:00.371
Using a suite of software and loads of computing power, the team constructed a probabilistic gene tree leading back to LUCA.

01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:04.872
So this says, OK, well, we've got X number of genes, a probability of 50%.

01:03:05.632 --> 01:03:13.314
Now, the trick here is to understand, and I think Matt Briggs would also appreciate this very much, that this is all computers now.

01:03:14.034 --> 01:03:15.115
It's all math now.

01:03:16.235 --> 01:03:17.615
It's all sequences now.

01:03:17.675 --> 01:03:19.496
It's all in a computer.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.616
None of this stuff is ever going to be checked.

01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:25.277
None of it is ever going to be verified with real world data.

01:03:25.817 --> 01:03:29.018
None of it is ever going to be rigorously verified.

01:03:30.985 --> 01:03:40.589
All these people are going to go on in their scientific career to produce more pseudo-knowledge until their whole career is just based on this nonsense.

01:03:40.929 --> 01:03:55.996
Neuroscience is also doing it with computer models that in no way, shape, or form contribute to our understanding of an irreducible complexity, but instead start with such an absurdly simple idea and assume it's right.

01:03:57.296 --> 01:03:59.217
What's the null hypothesis here?

01:04:08.456 --> 01:04:09.436
It's not science, man.

01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:11.637
Or a probability of 75%.

01:04:12.737 --> 01:04:15.798
Therefore, we think that these genes were probably in Luca.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:23.860
By integrating the probabilities of thousands of gene families, the team estimated Luca's genome likely encoded 2,600 proteins.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:30.902
Our main take-home result is that Luca is a complex organism, very similar, perhaps.

01:04:30.922 --> 01:04:31.522
2,600 proteins.

01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:35.724
Now, I need you to hear this one, because this is actually a really big deal.

01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:52.175
There are 31 proteins in the coronavirus that supposedly leaked in a mud puddle in Wuhan and then went around the world going on six years this year.

01:04:54.496 --> 01:04:52.175
31.

01:04:56.957 --> 01:05:02.878
Yet when they go back millions of years to our first ancestor, they estimate that it was 2,600 proteins.

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.453
And this guy can't think for a second like, wait, what are they telling us viruses are doing?

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:13.913
What's that?

01:05:14.033 --> 01:05:14.253
Huh?

01:05:14.313 --> 01:05:15.013
How does that work?

01:05:15.053 --> 01:05:15.534
Wait, what?

01:05:17.015 --> 01:05:19.636
It never occurs to him that that's a problem?

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:31.143
That the simplest watch from which all other watches on earth are descended has 2,600 parts according to his computer model.

01:05:33.328 --> 01:05:41.332
But a pandemic of a coronavirus just went around the earth and continues to go around the earth now and tracked with high fidelity, has 31 proteins and just 30,000 bases.

01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:52.644
I mean, that's what you get, right?

01:05:52.684 --> 01:06:03.533
When you so specialize in your biology, the little field that you don't think about how preposterous it is, the assumptions that you make, given what we know from other fields.

01:06:07.816 --> 01:06:08.997
But that's academia.

01:06:09.037 --> 01:06:10.398
That's academic biology.

01:06:10.458 --> 01:06:12.760
That's the biomedical sciences right now.

01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:20.366
People are trained to ask questions that don't encroach on other people's questions.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:38.258
And they are trained to try and find a little piece of that pie that they can slice ever thinner while not encroaching on anyone else's piece of the pie.

01:06:39.658 --> 01:06:45.562
And that's why it was a lot easier to get tenure and do something useful 20 or 30 years ago than it is now.

01:06:46.882 --> 01:06:50.164
Because there's a lot more people trying to cut up the same pie.

01:06:53.419 --> 01:06:57.981
using the same crappy methods.

01:07:01.483 --> 01:07:05.124
It's a bit smaller than a modern day bacterium, for example.

01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:13.448
Luca would have had a simple phospholipid membrane and the molecular machinery from- Funny, it's a lot simpler than a modern day bacteria.

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:20.411
So again, he seems to understand that a simple organism, simpler than a modern day bacteria is 2,600 proteins?

01:07:22.974 --> 01:07:24.055
2,600 genes?

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:27.156
The coronavirus has 31.

01:07:31.358 --> 01:07:33.799
Maintaining a genome and building proteins.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.921
It could metabolize hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide.

01:07:38.461 --> 01:07:43.104
But one of the really interesting things that we found, which was a complete surprise to us, was the CRISPR-Cas system.

01:07:43.484 --> 01:07:47.826
CRISPR-Cas is a basic immune system cells use to fight off viral attacks.

01:07:48.206 --> 01:07:51.808
Then some people are surprised that viruses would have been around that long ago.

01:07:52.209 --> 01:07:58.153
Luca may have lived off of non-living sources like hydrothermal vents or atmospheric gases.

01:07:58.553 --> 01:08:05.378
And so their argument now is, is that because the computer program said that CRISPR-Cas is an old gene, then it must have been old gene.

01:08:05.938 --> 01:08:11.882
And so then that means that the computer program says that there must have been viruses that were infecting bacteria back then.

01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:24.788
It couldn't be that the RNA in the background was part of a background that the whatever this is had to interact with.

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.250
Now, I'm not arguing that.

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:41.876
What I'm saying to you is that these people don't even seem to think very deeply about the model that they propose, because the model that they propose is like a 12-year-old's model with a 12-year-old depth of thought.

01:08:43.971 --> 01:08:45.211
You could do it better than this.

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:51.693
Even if you still believed I would have come up with better than this in 2020, I would have a better explanation for this.

01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:52.973
Who are these people?

01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:00.896
May have dined on the chemical waste of other microbes.

01:09:01.356 --> 01:09:09.198
To me, it seems more likely that Luca would have been part of a complex ecosystem, even at that point in time, exchanging metabolic products, et cetera, with all sorts of different things.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:13.659
For a complete picture, the team also needed to determine when Luca lived.

01:09:14.019 --> 01:09:25.085
And so we used some molecular and paleontological methods to try to estimate its age by calibrating the branches within genome trees.

01:09:25.485 --> 01:09:31.388
By comparing the rates of mutation over time across gene families, they were able to arrive at a date.

01:09:31.949 --> 01:09:35.911
So we estimated Luca's age to be around 4.2 billion years old.

01:09:36.211 --> 01:09:40.473
This is fairly soon after the Earth would have cooled off and been habitable for life.

01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:41.574
4.2 billion years.

01:09:45.450 --> 01:10:00.838
understand that this is one of the foundational assumptions of biology 101 I don't want to reveal too much but I mean this is really the at the heart of it we need to get to the foundational myths

01:10:03.277 --> 01:10:07.740
Where did we go wrong when we heard biology 101 from our high school teacher?

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.583
Where did our high school teacher go wrong when they learned biology 101?

01:10:12.084 --> 01:10:19.009
Where did all these academic biologists go wrong when they did their oral exam and just regurgitated the DNA to RNA to protein?

01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.589
Crap.

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:23.492
We can do it.

01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:25.874
We are going to do it.

01:10:26.214 --> 01:10:28.136
2025 is the year that we start doing it.

01:10:30.558 --> 01:10:31.939
We're going to get our kids out of this.

01:10:33.936 --> 01:10:34.476
to emerge.

01:10:34.736 --> 01:10:50.046
To me, that really ancient age is very surprising because we reconstruct Nucleus being quite a complex organism and yet it existed within about two, three, four hundred million years of Earth forming as a planet.

01:10:50.466 --> 01:10:55.909
Hopefully, you know, we've gone closer to the truth of this but clearly more work will need to be done.

01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:58.291
Here we go.

01:11:00.936 --> 01:11:02.197
This is the vagus nerve.

01:11:02.837 --> 01:11:10.042
This long bundle of neurons is a two-way information superhighway that connects the brain to many of the body's internal organs.

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:22.851
So there's a dizzying... Interesting fact, I just want to see if I can find it quick without too much work, um, YouTubage, uh, my channel.

01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:28.935
And then searching my channel for, um,

01:11:31.377 --> 01:11:51.218
um what would i have called it i would have called it um brain mind right or something like that turn a club on a bike neurotransitive the brain mind connection so here um i've got a video uh on my own youtube channel

01:11:55.319 --> 01:12:01.826
And this YouTube video is from 2020, and it's before the pandemic.

01:12:02.247 --> 01:12:07.092
Or during the pandemic, I think it's before the pandemic because nobody's wearing masks there.

01:12:08.313 --> 01:12:15.642
And this is a video where I talk about the connection between the gut and the brain.

01:12:17.313 --> 01:12:18.794
Hey, thanks for joining me on my ride.

01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:23.235
This is a Journal Club on a Bike covering the latest paper from Peter Strick's lab.

01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:29.038
Peter Strick is the head of my department of neurobiology at the School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.

01:12:29.418 --> 01:12:34.260
He's been working on the connections between the motor cortex and the muscles for

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.401
or at least 20 years.

01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:40.345
Um, this guy was a scientist while I was still eating breakfast cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons.

01:12:40.866 --> 01:12:42.527
And so he's got an age factor of about 80.

01:12:43.228 --> 01:12:46.111
He is one of the elder statesmen of neuroscience in America.

01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:50.855
Um, this guy's lab is now moving in a new direction to look at the mind body problem.

01:12:50.895 --> 01:12:55.379
Can you hear how much brown nosing is going on in this video?

01:12:55.419 --> 01:12:58.722
Can you hear how badly I want tenure?

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:05.946
Can you hear how badly I want to work for Peter Strick right here in this video?

01:13:10.269 --> 01:13:10.670
I can.

01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:15.693
I can also hear that my nodule on my vocal cords is already starting to develop.

01:13:15.753 --> 01:13:19.816
Now I'm starting to wonder if it was because of the talking on the bike.

01:13:19.876 --> 01:13:21.337
I never even thought about that.

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:22.598
That's maybe when it started.

01:13:26.297 --> 01:13:34.024
I just want to make this point, right, that in 2019, I did it, maybe this is early 2020, but I think it's 2019 still.

01:13:35.246 --> 01:13:37.027
I should just escape and look.

01:13:37.468 --> 01:13:39.329
It can't be, because that would be really early.

01:13:40.911 --> 01:13:42.572
More, and move your head.

01:13:44.014 --> 01:13:44.915
It is June 22, 2020.

01:13:45.956 --> 01:13:51.101
Oh, okay, so it's during the pandemic, but then people weren't wearing masks on the street anymore.

01:13:52.998 --> 01:13:55.960
So that's still when I hadn't been asked to not come in anymore.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.481
I didn't get asked not to come in anymore until October of 2020.

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:10.448
So I was still talking about a lab leak on my bike and, you know, arguing with people in the hallways about natural immunity and all this other stuff up until October of 2020.

01:14:11.129 --> 01:14:13.090
And then I was asked not to come in anymore.

01:14:14.931 --> 01:14:19.394
And fortunately for me and my family, they still had to pay my contract out until July the next year.

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.895
And so I had time to start my work.

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:25.292
It became giga ohm biological as you see it now.

01:14:26.673 --> 01:14:33.837
So, this video is available on YouTube and it's about the vagus nerve and about the tracing of that anatomy in

01:14:36.233 --> 01:15:03.133
monkeys and I might even look at some of the pictures here you know tracing this this nerve down to the gut and so it's a very basic study but it's done in rats and in monkeys and it's comparative and it shows that it's across animals and so you know we've been interested in this for quite a few years and so it's interesting now that you know this guy talks about like we just discovered the vagus nerve of course we've known about it now the question becomes

01:15:04.662 --> 01:15:14.766
Does this humble them in terms of, you know, well, we thought we knew what we were dealing with, but now it's obviously a lot more complicated than we thought.

01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:22.030
And then the implications of this being that there might be a lot more complications that we're not yet aware of, but instead, no, not at all.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:24.751
It's just like, we just got to keep going.

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:28.472
And while we have another piece of the puzzle, well, I found out that the watch has an alarm.

01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:29.373
That's pretty cool.

01:15:34.338 --> 01:15:39.581
an array of stimuli that comes up from the body and can evoke various behavioral and physiological responses.

01:15:39.681 --> 01:15:42.983
The brain can also, in turn, regulate the body.

01:15:43.564 --> 01:15:51.208
This May, a team of scientists published research revealing a surprising new vagal connection between the brain and the body's immune system.

01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:58.513
And there is no question that the whole set of diseases and disorders that were previously thought to be diseases of

01:15:59.534 --> 01:16:05.820
The body are undoubtedly going to emerge as diseases of body-brain communication.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.621
Body-brain communication.

01:16:07.661 --> 01:16:11.365
Now, the really crazy thing is that the vagus nerve innervates your gut.

01:16:13.187 --> 01:16:20.053
And so it would be really crazy if there was an interaction between your gut and your gut microbiome and your brain, wouldn't it?

01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:23.452
And of course, you guys know that that's already the case.

01:16:23.492 --> 01:16:24.373
We already know that.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:31.637
We know that in certain rare diseases that bacterias release a certain protein that can cause a psychological change.

01:16:31.657 --> 01:16:37.161
We know that this in very anecdotal cases, therefore, why wouldn't it be in health and disease?

01:16:38.837 --> 01:16:58.574
Why wouldn't this symphony be one of the essential attributes of our pattern integrity, one of the central angles of our pattern integrity, and that we're just discovering it now, that there is a central nerve called the vagus nerve, which may carry this information back and forth between our periphery and our brain?

01:17:00.313 --> 01:17:03.217
Now they're going to say that it also might influence the immune system?

01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:17.394
Then how in the hell can we augment the immune system with intramuscular injection of a combination of substances and know for sure that we're not going to augment the brain of the person in response to that?

01:17:25.428 --> 01:17:31.893
In 1921, physiologist Otto Loewi discovered that stimulating a frog's vagus nerve slowed its heartbeat.

01:17:32.354 --> 01:17:37.618
He named the associated signaling chemical vagustoff and later won the Nobel Prize.

01:17:38.739 --> 01:17:46.225
The vagus nerve contains some of the longest neurons in the body and connects the brainstem to vital organs, including the stomach, lungs and heart.

01:17:46.565 --> 01:17:54.351
They're both sensory neurons that take information from the body up to the brain, as well as motor neurons that go in the opposite direction.

01:17:54.704 --> 01:18:00.588
Through the vagus nerve, the brainstem regulates basic survival systems, such as breathing, heartbeats, and hunger.

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:04.090
One term that's often used with the vagus is homeostasis.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:10.914
And so any deviation from that homeostatic set point, the body-brain signals will help bring the body back to that equilibrium.

01:18:11.475 --> 01:18:16.038
In 2020, Charles Zucker's lab stumbled upon a surprising brain-body connection.

01:18:16.618 --> 01:18:24.123
Their studies of taste receptors revealed that in mice, the sensation of sweetness comes not only from the tongue, but also from the stomach.

01:18:25.273 --> 01:18:29.157
Now, this opened up this world, body-brain signaling.

01:18:29.637 --> 01:18:35.422
What other salient examples are over brain control of body biology in a way that's completely unexpected?

01:18:36.403 --> 01:18:39.966
And we thought the immune system poses an amazing example.

01:18:41.188 --> 01:18:45.451
At the time, there was no evidence that the brain communicated directly with the immune system.

01:18:46.294 --> 01:18:52.615
However, experiments performed in the 1990s by neurosurgeon Kevin Tracy pointed to the possibility of a connection.

01:18:52.635 --> 01:19:02.437
So the crazy experiment at the time, where he did a sort of a coarse electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, and he found that stimulating the vagus nerve dampened the immune system.

01:19:02.457 --> 01:19:04.857
He called this the anti-inflammatory reflex.

01:19:05.697 --> 01:19:08.658
Inflammation is the immune system's first line of defense.

01:19:09.358 --> 01:19:15.199
After sustaining an injury or infection, pro-inflammatory molecules are released to help fight pathogens.

01:19:15.879 --> 01:19:22.142
Then, the release of anti-inflammatory molecules keeps the inflammation response in... Release from where?

01:19:23.503 --> 01:19:25.464
Do you hear the lack of specificity?

01:19:25.484 --> 01:19:27.144
Do you hear the lack of details?

01:19:27.205 --> 01:19:37.890
They're waving over this, waving over that, while at the same time trying to add multiple layers of irreducible complexity to an already irreducibly complex model of how we work.

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.231
Pretending like it's no big deal.

01:19:42.232 --> 01:19:44.553
We found three more layers, no big deal.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.583
and check, so it doesn't damage the body's own tissues.

01:19:50.283 --> 01:19:54.847
A heightened inflammatory response has been linked to a host of diseases and disorders.

01:19:55.327 --> 01:20:04.174
Multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, lupus, and I can go on and on.

01:20:04.522 --> 01:20:09.028
and also some metabolic disease like obesity and diabetes.

01:20:09.408 --> 01:20:12.912
Overactive inflammation is definitely a bad thing.

01:20:13.533 --> 01:20:14.774
Is this a discovery?

01:20:15.555 --> 01:20:16.617
Of course it's not!

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:23.986
The discovery is that it could be regulated by lots of interconnected systems.

01:20:25.848 --> 01:20:33.035
The sad part is, is that they don't realize that intramuscular ejection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:20:33.475 --> 01:20:39.140
And that was just on the physical basis of the layout of our body.

01:20:42.023 --> 01:20:44.826
The layout of our immune system relative to barriers.

01:20:46.807 --> 01:20:48.429
The way our defenses are set up.

01:20:50.325 --> 01:20:56.510
And now you're telling me that our immune system and our gut are all interacting through our brain?

01:20:57.731 --> 01:21:01.134
Chemicals released by those and chemicals released by our brain?

01:21:02.895 --> 01:21:09.961
And now you think that intramuscular injection of a combination of substances to augment the immune system is more safe or less safe?

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:21.947
They're just really excited that they can make their little tiny sliver of science even longer and longer and longer at the end.

01:21:22.547 --> 01:21:24.029
That's what they're most excited about.

01:21:24.069 --> 01:21:29.634
This means that we've got lots and lots and lots of more slices of the pie we can make.

01:21:31.656 --> 01:21:38.263
In a series of experiments, the Zucker team set out to find whether there's a mechanism in the brain that controls the inflammatory process.

01:21:39.048 --> 01:21:44.030
We reasoned that it has to be some sort of homeostatic controls.

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:50.152
First, the researchers identified the groups of neurons in mice that are activated during immunological challenges.

01:21:50.693 --> 01:21:55.234
They wondered what would happen if they used genetic techniques to activate these neurons.

01:21:55.255 --> 01:21:58.596
You can choose to excite or inhibit.

01:21:59.116 --> 01:22:03.719
they discovered that these neurons in the brainstem acted like a volume dial for inflammation.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.463
The researchers could manipulate them to turn the inflammatory response up or turn it back down.

01:22:09.704 --> 01:22:14.027
Two lines, one carries pro-inflammatory, one carries anti.

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:18.270
Jason, I think you should find that, find that paper.

01:22:20.391 --> 01:22:26.736
That was a huge surprise that it's really telling the brain what's happening on both sides of this homeostatic.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:31.722
This was the first time that control of the immune system was located in the brain.

01:22:32.782 --> 01:22:40.106
Further research of this inflammatory homeostat in humans could lead to new treatments for the many diseases linked to inflammation.

01:22:40.566 --> 01:22:51.151
And if you could find ways to tap and control the activity, either positively or negatively, for each of these... So they're not talking about finding the source of these dysregulated states, these diseases.

01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:53.832
They're not trying to find the source of that, like, you know,

01:22:54.352 --> 01:23:00.097
the intramuscular injection of a combination of substances with the stupid idea of augmenting the immune system.

01:23:00.557 --> 01:23:02.859
We're not gonna look for the causes of this.

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:08.483
We're just looking for fun ways to take advantage of it so that we can understand the brain better.

01:23:08.824 --> 01:23:09.404
Cool, huh?

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:13.227
The neuron types, you have profound effects.

01:23:13.647 --> 01:23:18.051
I think opens up a new window in the way we think about how perhaps we can help make a difference.

01:23:23.092 --> 01:23:27.135
These are microscopic molecular machines essential to life on Earth.

01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:32.058
They've evolved over millions of years to perform a vast array of vital functions.

01:23:32.518 --> 01:23:47.547
You know, one of the things about the protein thing that is hilarious to think about is that most of the most interesting machines that we have in our cells are actually composed of proteins and RNA.

01:23:49.228 --> 01:23:50.289
They're riboproteins.

01:23:52.955 --> 01:23:58.258
And so, for example, like ribosomes are not just, they're not just proteins.

01:23:59.998 --> 01:24:05.461
They're big pieces of RNA folded up in a particular way with proteins folded up in a particular way.

01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:08.843
And then they make subunits and stuff that I don't understand all the details of.

01:24:10.123 --> 01:24:14.686
But I know that solving the protein folding problem is not all it's cracked up to be.

01:24:17.187 --> 01:24:21.469
Because they still have this problem of understanding how RNA is used in these machines.

01:24:23.823 --> 01:24:28.422
Sometimes I guess it's just a messenger and other times it can be a cog in the wheel.

01:24:31.044 --> 01:24:54.887
And it is this hand-waving over these inconvenient facts that really makes it obvious to me now how bamboozled they want you to be about molecular biology, about cell biology, in order to get people to participate in academic biology in a useless way to pursue the ever-smaller cutting of tiny specializations

01:24:56.198 --> 01:24:59.844
and never usefully pushing our understanding at the far edge.

01:25:00.385 --> 01:25:00.785
At all.

01:25:02.047 --> 01:25:04.631
Because we work under the same assumptions.

01:25:04.711 --> 01:25:08.177
Evolution because DNA and all the consequences of that dumb idea.

01:25:11.837 --> 01:25:14.038
The other molecules, they take molecules down.

01:25:14.458 --> 01:25:17.060
All these are at the end chemical reactions.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.483
And to understand this chemistry of life, you need to understand the structure of these molecules.

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:30.027
For more than half a century, biologists have sought to unravel the enigma of how proteins fold to function.

01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:31.969
The effort to doing this is enormous.

01:25:32.309 --> 01:25:42.259
You can think of it as something like $100,000 in expense, a couple of years of a PhD student's time, really an enormous investment to get even a single structure.

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:49.166
During a recent grand challenge, a team at DeepMind used artificial intelligence to solve a key part of the protein puzzle.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:56.183
They trained a neural network to read the one-dimensional molecular sequence of a protein and predict its 3D structure.

01:25:56.883 --> 01:25:59.384
For many proteins, AlphaFold2's accuracy is 99%.

01:26:01.636 --> 01:26:05.318
DeepMind's breakthrough opened the door to a new era of biology.

01:26:05.778 --> 01:26:10.281
People have said that biology is becoming a computational science, and this is certainly true.

01:26:10.841 --> 01:26:14.083
The AI revolution, you start applying.

01:26:14.163 --> 01:26:16.104
It's not becoming a computational science.

01:26:16.164 --> 01:26:17.164
It always has been.

01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:26.149
And that's been revealed by some of the books that we are reading in Biology 101, including, which is not there right now, the one

01:26:29.122 --> 01:26:31.483
Shoot, I wanted to put that up, but I think I put it over there.

01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:41.046
Where is it?

01:26:41.986 --> 01:26:43.207
Yes, come on now.

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:45.288
There it is.

01:26:46.888 --> 01:26:57.712
What is Life, Mind, and Matter is one of these books that really admits that a lot of the ideas that we are using to explain life using only

01:26:59.268 --> 01:27:09.932
Physics and chemistry requires these kind of stochastic processes, requires these kinds of measurements across vast numbers in order to see the signal that they want to study.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:22.917
And if you believe that these chemicals can be just mixed together in the right ways and that they will self-assemble into you, or into a baby, or even into a mosquito, you are absolutely mistaken.

01:27:25.219 --> 01:27:35.462
We almost understand nothing about how life is perpetuated, how pattern integrities are perpetuated and sustained and maybe evolve over time.

01:27:39.044 --> 01:27:43.245
And we definitely don't understand how DNA could be responsible for this.

01:27:43.785 --> 01:27:48.347
There is no biology to explain how DNA is responsible for this.

01:27:48.387 --> 01:27:52.268
There is biology to explain how DNA may encode proteins, yes.

01:27:55.370 --> 01:28:03.893
But that in no way, shape, or form explains how a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time is encoded in DNA.

01:28:04.854 --> 01:28:10.616
The change from a small infant to a seven-year-old girl that can play soccer.

01:28:13.237 --> 01:28:13.878
Where is that?

01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:19.240
Where did the Human Genome Project make any progress on that front?

01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:21.841
Stop lying!

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:29.319
including the engineering of human-designed proteins to fix some of the world's biggest problems.

01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:41.932
A protein-specific molecular function is a product of its three-dimensional folded shape.

01:28:42.072 --> 01:28:49.036
They'll fold up into a really precise shape, and they do that every time, and that shape carries out a biological function.

01:28:49.296 --> 01:28:54.939
If we have a 3D structure, then we can really begin to understand how these molecules behave and function.

01:28:55.385 --> 01:29:01.447
So now what she just said there, if we have the 3D structure, we can really begin to understand how these molecules function.

01:29:01.487 --> 01:29:09.569
It's not something that's coming out of her head like RNA cannot pandemic, or transfection is a crime, or intramuscular injection is dumb.

01:29:10.889 --> 01:29:21.752
This is coming out of her brain because somebody repeated it to her over and over again, and she sat in enough seminars to hear other people say versions of it that she can regurgitate one of her own.

01:29:27.119 --> 01:29:32.303
And we are confused by this in a video format because it seems like all these people agree on it.

01:29:32.383 --> 01:29:35.325
No, it's these people have all learned the same mythologies.

01:29:36.185 --> 01:29:39.928
They've all learned the same myths and how to tell their own version of them.

01:29:41.449 --> 01:29:47.473
It's no different if you took five of these people in independent rooms and asked them to explain the myth of Santa Claus.

01:29:47.853 --> 01:29:49.674
They would all have all the details right.

01:29:51.155 --> 01:29:55.298
They might even be able to tell you that one of the reindeers in some stories has a red light on his nose.

01:29:57.793 --> 01:30:01.275
That wouldn't make it true, even if they all agreed on that detail.

01:30:04.496 --> 01:30:24.925
And the crazy part is, is that they were to tell us a story with very much conviction about a red-nosed reindeer that takes a small, white, fat gnome around the world and distributes presents every year, and they told it in the same way, and we were just as naive about that story as we are about molecular biology we would buy at Hook, Line, and Sinker.

01:30:27.458 --> 01:30:34.645
Especially if they told us about transcontinental currents that need to be navigated by a strict wavelength of red light.

01:30:38.328 --> 01:30:46.716
And that previous physics experiments have predicted the fact that a particular wavelength of light could cut through certain fogs in the Arctic and would be very useful in aviation.

01:30:49.038 --> 01:30:51.160
Holy shit, there is a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

01:30:57.076 --> 01:31:03.478
This origami-like shape is rendered by the sequence of its primary structural components, amino acids.

01:31:04.079 --> 01:31:09.821
All proteins are built from 20 different flavors of amino acids connected in chains, called polypeptides.

01:31:10.961 --> 01:31:17.484
When first assembled inside a cell, proteins are unfolded, their amino acids strung together like beads on a necklace.

01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:23.186
These amino acids can be arranged in countless configurations to form different proteins.

01:31:24.056 --> 01:31:31.980
The recipe for a given protein's specific polypeptide sequence is encoded within a cell's DNA.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.702
In 1969, biologist Cyrus Leventhal observed a paradox.

01:31:36.342 --> 01:31:41.925
For any protein, even small ones, there's an astronomical number of possible folding configurations.

01:31:43.206 --> 01:31:47.408
Yet proteins reliably fold into their functional shapes in less than a second.

01:31:47.968 --> 01:31:51.830
The mystery behind this process became known as the protein folding problem.

01:31:53.254 --> 01:31:59.260
Now the real question becomes, if they are manufactured by ribosomes in different tissues, why do they fold differently?

01:32:03.263 --> 01:32:11.311
The real question becomes, is that spontaneously folded protein in any relation to the ribosomally manufactured protein?

01:32:12.776 --> 01:32:16.179
Post-translational modification, does that change the protein folding?

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:23.524
Does the local conditions of the water around the manufacturer, do they change the conditions of the folding?

01:32:27.807 --> 01:32:30.389
Can folding be changed by electrostatic forces?

01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:42.058
In other words, what they are looking at are the chemical and physical processes that they can detect when they make enough of a single protein that the change is visible.

01:32:45.108 --> 01:32:52.777
An unnatural pure quantity of a protein folds in a stereotypic way.

01:32:52.877 --> 01:33:02.289
It doesn't necessarily mean that the one that they find in nature does, because the one that's found in nature can't be made in that huge pure quantity and studied in that way.

01:33:05.011 --> 01:33:13.978
And so we may also be being misled by the fidelity of this program's ability to predict a 3D model.

01:33:14.398 --> 01:33:19.843
The 3D model it's predicting is a model when the protein is made in a very pure form and allowed to crystallize.

01:33:22.685 --> 01:33:28.890
They can't take these proteins out of your cells and put them under a microscope and look at how they're folded and compare that to alpha fold.

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:46.446
They take a synthetically generated version of that protein made by making recombinant DNA that encodes for it and then using a bacterial culture or some other system to create a large quantity of that protein.

01:33:46.486 --> 01:33:52.729
How it's folded depends on those particular ribosomes and the particular system they use to generate it.

01:33:54.769 --> 01:33:57.891
And so AlphaFold can predict that result to a 99% accuracy rate.

01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:08.201
But we know nothing about how those proteins are folded by your particular ribosomes in a particular tissue or subtype of cell.

01:34:09.261 --> 01:34:10.462
It could be different in every one.

01:34:10.502 --> 01:34:12.022
And in fact, it's often assumed to be.

01:34:13.823 --> 01:34:20.926
And yet we're giving away Nobel Prizes to imply that this fidelity is ubiquitous.

01:34:21.526 --> 01:34:22.086
And it's not.

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:47.790
This fidelity of understanding is limited to proteins that can be made in pure enough quantities to culture and to pure enough quantities to crystallize and to use X-ray crystallography to measure across those millions of similar molecules a shape that would otherwise be undetectable.

01:34:50.646 --> 01:35:04.918
And so the implication that that shape produced with unnatural means, with unnatural purity and unnatural quantities is related to the natural shape produced by a ribosome one at a time is another very big assumption.

01:35:04.938 --> 01:35:05.519
It could be true.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.963
But it's a big assumption that none of these people have the balls or the funding to test.

01:35:11.044 --> 01:35:12.285
I can tell you that for sure.

01:35:13.105 --> 01:35:16.208
They work on that assumption because their grant proposals require them to.

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:24.862
Google DeepMind was founded in 2007 to advance a nascent form of AI called deep learning.

01:35:25.542 --> 01:35:32.986
After their AI systems successfully mastered Go and several other games, DeepMind's founder, Demis Hassabis, sought new challenges.

01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:37.787
You know, we're very early days in development of AI, but there are still many unsolved problems.

01:35:38.228 --> 01:35:45.871
The DeepMind team entered what has been called the Olympics of protein folding, the critical assessment of structure prediction challenge, or CASP.

01:35:46.977 --> 01:35:53.718
CASP participants take amino acid sequences and then attempt to predict the protein's 3D structures using a computer algorithm.

01:35:54.499 --> 01:36:01.140
Experimental chemist John Jumper led the team in the development of their protein structure prediction algorithm, AlphaFold2.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:10.762
They trained a deep learning neural network with data that described more than 100,000 known proteins, both their amino acid sequences and their folded 3D structures.

01:36:11.502 --> 01:36:14.003
plus evolutionary data about the proteins.

01:36:14.323 --> 01:36:19.145
Build some of our understanding of proteins into it, what's called inductive bias in the language of machine learning.

01:36:19.505 --> 01:36:22.126
It learned extraordinarily rapidly from data.

01:36:22.687 --> 01:36:27.189
The data is processed by a series of powerful neural networks called transformers.

01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:37.193
After cycling through the whole algorithm, AlphaFold reveals a structure prediction, along with a score of how competent it is in its predictions of different parts of the protein structure.

01:36:38.228 --> 01:36:41.311
In 2020, the DeepMind team entered AlphaFold in CASP-14.

01:36:41.591 --> 01:36:44.994
The algorithm's structure predictions came out on top.

01:36:45.354 --> 01:36:47.015
It was really a shock.

01:36:47.055 --> 01:36:49.477
You're looking at these things like, can it really be that good?

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:50.438
What's going on here?

01:36:51.079 --> 01:36:59.165
By July 2022, DeepMind had released the structure predictions for 218 million proteins, nearly all of those known in the world.

01:36:59.966 --> 01:37:02.528
Some called the protein problem essentially solved.

01:37:04.056 --> 01:37:07.699
For many biologists, it took months or years to accept the results.

01:37:08.179 --> 01:37:14.964
But at the University of Washington, David Baker had been developing software to solve the protein folding problem for three decades.

01:37:15.264 --> 01:37:22.510
At that point, we really sort of said, OK, well, how can we take these new concepts and ideas and AI generally and apply it to protein design?

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:26.191
which is the process of synthesizing new and novel proteins.

01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:28.893
Baker's goal is to design new proteins that don't exist

01:37:36.638 --> 01:37:50.236
And so that's already kind of an enchantment, in my humble opinion, to say that they're designing genes that encode these proteins is trying to imply a level of mastery over this medium that they don't have.

01:37:50.376 --> 01:37:53.760
Now, can they make DNA sequences that encode

01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.350
proteins.

01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:56.171
Yes, they can.

01:37:56.471 --> 01:37:57.812
I do think that they can do that.

01:37:58.552 --> 01:38:06.117
But that does not imply that they understand the code that might be layered upon that, the multi layers of code that might be above it.

01:38:06.597 --> 01:38:11.660
They might not understand a three dimensional code that might be present in the structure of the DNA.

01:38:12.121 --> 01:38:23.688
They don't understand how and why are the the data about the four dimensional aspect of life is encoded at all the four dimensional aspect being that trajectory across time.

01:38:27.745 --> 01:38:40.437
And so these protein people are in a safe space in my mind because I do think there is a lot of chemical and material science to be done at the protein level.

01:38:40.477 --> 01:38:47.544
And I have no doubt in my mind that there are going to be a lot of useful proteins that man will design and be useful for things.

01:38:47.604 --> 01:38:48.105
That's true.

01:38:50.270 --> 01:39:00.277
But it would be very different than, say, making a protein and adding it to our pattern integrity and having it be a part of our species going forward.

01:39:00.337 --> 01:39:08.102
That would be the kind of genetic modification that, of course, would be really terrible, awful to propose.

01:39:11.181 --> 01:39:25.148
And what you have to see here is, in my mind, is a graying of this area and implying already, testing the language already, the slave speak about making genes that code for proteins.

01:39:25.188 --> 01:39:26.108
That's slave speak.

01:39:27.749 --> 01:39:35.753
They're making you submit to this, that they are the masters, that they have the craft, and they can do this already.

01:39:35.813 --> 01:39:37.193
That's what's happening here.

01:39:37.233 --> 01:39:40.215
It's a subtle violence with words.

01:39:41.311 --> 01:39:42.833
They are teaching us slave speak.

01:40:00.182 --> 01:40:04.606
To design a new protein, researchers run the protein folding problem backwards.

01:40:05.306 --> 01:40:17.557
Instead of predicting the 3D shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence, they design the 3D shape for a novel protein and then use AI tools to output the amino acid sequence before synthesizing the protein in the lab.

01:40:18.017 --> 01:40:25.824
See, what's interesting about this is that this in no way, shape or form suggests to me that they understand why proteins have the shapes that they do.

01:40:28.735 --> 01:40:33.559
They in no way, shape or form understand why proteins have the shapes that they do.

01:40:33.599 --> 01:40:43.686
But now they are going to completely let the algorithm and the computer take little parts and pieces and suggest to them how they should put them together.

01:40:43.726 --> 01:40:45.387
And then they're going to call that science.

01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:49.470
Will it work?

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:50.111
I don't know.

01:40:51.131 --> 01:40:52.592
Will it create dangerous things?

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:53.113
I don't know.

01:40:55.779 --> 01:41:07.330
But it's not doing what they say it's doing, which is creating knowledge about who we are as a species and creating knowledge about what life is.

01:41:09.111 --> 01:41:20.822
But instead, they are, again, engaging in this curation of this myth that evolution, because DNA, and the dogma, DNA, RNA, protein.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.482
And these people are paid to do it.

01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:29.768
They are 100% not gonna figure it out, even if they meet me.

01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:33.153
Because their salary depends on them not figuring it out.

01:41:33.774 --> 01:41:40.363
And because they are very comfortable at the top of this very narrow point of knowledge that they think they've assembled.

01:41:42.236 --> 01:41:49.780
where proteins fold and protein folding is interesting and we can make medicines from here and genes encode proteins.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.761
And they don't want to question any of that.

01:41:52.021 --> 01:41:55.343
They just want to do some stuff here and keep getting grants.

01:41:55.883 --> 01:42:01.566
And if they want us to talk into a camera sometimes and say our grant proposal out loud, I will do that.

01:42:06.874 --> 01:42:11.797
We can now design proteins which are much more sophisticated and should be much more precise and safe.

01:42:12.297 --> 01:42:14.939
Beyond medicine, we're working on improved methods.

01:42:15.499 --> 01:42:17.880
Much more sophisticated and safe.

01:42:18.761 --> 01:42:20.462
I don't know why safe had to go in there.

01:42:20.622 --> 01:42:21.743
That's hysterical.

01:42:22.123 --> 01:42:24.905
We wouldn't want to stumble upon a super protein, right?

01:42:26.566 --> 01:42:27.906
Or a super antigen.

01:42:28.747 --> 01:42:31.408
Of capturing sunlight and doing things with that energy.

01:42:31.428 --> 01:42:35.451
We're working on improved methods for degrading toxic compounds.

01:42:36.718 --> 01:42:40.780
the next frontier in the application of AI to problems in protein science.

01:42:41.192 --> 01:42:48.598
I mean, I think what they ought to do is make it so that the melanin in my skin can also be photosynthetic so that I don't have to eat so much.

01:42:48.658 --> 01:42:49.459
That would be handy.

01:42:49.959 --> 01:42:51.320
I mean, you could just engineer that.

01:42:51.481 --> 01:42:54.964
Lies in the prediction of protein interactions within the whole cell.

01:42:55.624 --> 01:42:57.045
Right, these are the machines of the cell.

01:42:57.105 --> 01:43:00.208
They do lots of really, really important stuff in the cell.

01:43:01.029 --> 01:43:07.274
Inside a cell, proteins interact with a host of different molecules, including DNA, RNA, and metals.

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:15.467
So Baker's team, DeepMind, and others started developing AI algorithms capable of predicting these complex interactions.

01:43:16.287 --> 01:43:20.931
The spring of 2024 saw the release of the next generation of AI prediction tools.

01:43:21.791 --> 01:43:29.196
The Baker lab released Rosetta Fold All-Atom, which predicts the 3D structures of assemblies of proteins and other small molecules.

01:43:30.317 --> 01:43:32.599
Soon after, DeepMind released AlphaFold3.

01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:36.962
Really incredible improvements that we think are going to unlock a lot of new science.

01:43:37.932 --> 01:43:43.355
The efforts of these three researchers and their teams have revolutionized the study of proteins.

01:43:44.056 --> 01:43:51.140
In October 2024, the three were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to recognize their scientific leap forward.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.581
You always want to be pushing the frontier.

01:43:54.122 --> 01:43:57.424
At a time of technology transition, it's a very intense time.

01:43:57.844 --> 01:44:00.005
For me, it's been tremendously exhilarating.

01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:03.167
I mean, there's so much more to be understood.

01:44:03.207 --> 01:44:04.208
It's the beginning.

01:44:04.895 --> 01:44:07.182
I'm gonna try and make an analogy here.

01:44:07.222 --> 01:44:08.505
I gotta go back to my toolbox.

01:44:08.566 --> 01:44:09.187
Hold on one second.

01:44:41.698 --> 01:44:46.763
This is just a random example, but I want to make a point here about what they're talking about and what they're not talking about.

01:44:47.403 --> 01:44:55.030
I want you to imagine a scenario that I was a guy who was trying to figure out how his motorcycle worked in his garage.

01:44:56.011 --> 01:45:01.716
And I was trying to do a little show about how I had figured out how my motorcycle works.

01:45:01.916 --> 01:45:06.841
And what I told you after several years of working actually is that I figured out

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.402
that there are two sizes of wrenches.

01:45:10.462 --> 01:45:13.763
There's actually an English size and a metric size.

01:45:13.903 --> 01:45:18.765
And the ones that are on the English side don't work very well on the metric ones.

01:45:18.805 --> 01:45:21.006
And the metric ones don't work very well on the English ones.

01:45:21.046 --> 01:45:27.448
And the really cool thing is, is today, I figured out that there's actually a new tool

01:45:28.288 --> 01:45:54.408
that allows me to take apart the frame of my bicycle and it's so my motorcycle and it's so cool and it's this thing um and it's the shape of a it's the shape of a star and so i've added a new shape of a bit to my understanding of how motorcycles are assembled and i figured out that there's actually a torx bit

01:45:55.503 --> 01:46:01.967
And so this is really cool because this means that now I can take the shell off of my bicycle and get under there and figure out what's there.

01:46:02.587 --> 01:46:05.129
And I had no idea that I could remove that shell.

01:46:05.449 --> 01:46:12.874
But now that I know that these Torx wrenches exist, I can remove that shell and find out exactly how complex my motorcycle is.

01:46:19.038 --> 01:46:23.140
And now if these people tell you that they've figured out how proteins fold,

01:46:25.435 --> 01:46:29.737
They're not, they're not, that doesn't mean that we're really close to understanding evolution because DNA.

01:46:30.638 --> 01:46:36.621
That there's no God, that there's no creation, that there's no nothing, that we understand everything now, just take the shot and shut up.

01:46:38.562 --> 01:46:40.423
But that's what slave speak tells you.

01:46:42.384 --> 01:46:50.208
Slave speak tells you that they're almost ready to end disease, that war will be over, that everybody's comfortable.

01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:54.610
That everybody's going to live forever.

01:47:00.865 --> 01:47:01.866
I got another one for you.

01:47:04.587 --> 01:47:05.467
Not sure what to do.

01:47:05.788 --> 01:47:06.268
Ah, darn it.

01:47:06.308 --> 01:47:07.028
What did I do there?

01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:10.230
What do I want?

01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:11.310
I want this one.

01:47:12.831 --> 01:47:14.552
And then this one.

01:47:14.692 --> 01:47:15.552
Oh no, not that one.

01:47:15.693 --> 01:47:16.133
That one.

01:47:16.173 --> 01:47:16.693
There we go.

01:47:16.853 --> 01:47:17.393
And that one.

01:47:17.654 --> 01:47:18.354
And not that one.

01:47:18.394 --> 01:47:19.314
That one.

01:47:19.575 --> 01:47:21.716
Wow, I rearranged my desk too much.

01:47:22.616 --> 01:47:23.857
I got another video for you.

01:47:23.897 --> 01:47:24.317
Let's do it.

01:47:30.253 --> 01:47:31.454
other guests joining us.

01:47:31.874 --> 01:47:32.895
They're amazing people.

01:47:33.356 --> 01:47:35.557
First of all, I'd like to introduce Maxime Bernier.

01:47:35.637 --> 01:47:37.039
This is from five days ago.

01:47:37.059 --> 01:47:39.240
I just want to listen to Robert Malone at the beginning.

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:39.721
It's great to see you.

01:47:39.741 --> 01:47:40.361
Welcome to the show.

01:47:40.982 --> 01:47:41.803
Thank you very much.

01:47:41.883 --> 01:47:43.204
I'm very pleased to be with you.

01:47:44.305 --> 01:47:46.727
Well, I'm absolutely delighted to have you with here.

01:47:46.807 --> 01:47:55.574
We have Ben Habib, who is a former member of the European Parliament, and of course, Dr. Robert Malone, who's one of the top doctors in the United States with international renown.

01:47:56.483 --> 01:48:12.774
one of the top doctors in the united states but he's never practiced medicine introduced as one of the top doctors in the united states with international renown stop lying

01:48:17.233 --> 01:48:20.095
And we're also joined with John O'Looney, who's another businessman from the UK.

01:48:20.135 --> 01:48:21.956
He's been on my show many times.

01:48:21.996 --> 01:48:23.377
John, it's great to see you too, mate.

01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:23.877
How are you doing?

01:48:24.478 --> 01:48:25.118
I'm good, mate.

01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:25.538
I'm good.

01:48:25.579 --> 01:48:26.539
Thanks for having me on, Jim.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:38.467
Well, it's good timing, actually, gentlemen, because Dr. Malone and Ben Abib and I have just been talking about the maid in Canada and assisted dying and how it's looking to go into the Australian Parliament.

01:48:38.947 --> 01:48:42.810
In the UK Parliament, they've been talking about... But why would they need assisted dying?

01:48:43.811 --> 01:48:45.852
What problem would they be wanting to manage?

01:48:49.420 --> 01:49:08.008
Please wake up and realize that these people are unwittingly or wittingly participating, and that Robert Malone is part of an intricate network of liars that has coordinatedly bamboozled us for five plus years, and that almost all the people, if not all the people that I've ever singled out are involved with him.

01:49:09.411 --> 01:49:16.194
There is no other explanation for their five international COVID summits or six and the people that were involved in them.

01:49:16.214 --> 01:49:23.076
There's no explanation for Senator Ron Johnson's many Senate meetings and the composition of them.

01:49:24.797 --> 01:49:33.360
There's no explanation for what Steve Bannon did in 2020 with Stephen Hatfield and Robert Malone and Li Min Yan.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.141
There is no explanation for it.

01:49:36.181 --> 01:49:39.604
That's why they don't want you to talk about 2020 and 2021 anymore.

01:49:40.104 --> 01:49:46.049
And that's why Robert Malone has got to be introduced as one of the most famous and respected doctors in America.

01:49:46.689 --> 01:49:47.410
Stop lying.

01:49:50.094 --> 01:49:52.415
pushing out something similar to that as well.

01:49:52.915 --> 01:49:57.318
First of all, if I could go to the UK is under attack.

01:49:57.358 --> 01:50:04.481
Do you not see that under attack by American traders who are assisting in the controlled demolition of your country?

01:50:06.262 --> 01:50:11.885
Robert Malone's not saving you any more than he saved my kids or any of the college kids in America.

01:50:14.215 --> 01:50:21.501
And these people are either dumb or they are absolutely participating in his undermining of your ability to resist.

01:50:22.702 --> 01:50:23.282
Wake up.

01:50:25.404 --> 01:50:30.207
Maxime, what's your take on the maid service in Canada?

01:50:30.708 --> 01:50:36.212
And for those that maybe that around the world that maybe are not so familiar with you, you'll be very well known in Canada.

01:50:36.592 --> 01:50:41.376
Just give us a little bit of background about the PPC maybe to begin with and what got you involved in that.

01:50:42.679 --> 01:50:45.040
Yes, I'll be very short about the PPC.

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:48.983
The People's Party is a new populist political party in Canada.

01:50:49.043 --> 01:50:51.744
We created that party in 2018.

01:50:52.525 --> 01:50:56.807
And at the last election at the federal level, we had 5% of the vote.

01:50:57.207 --> 01:51:00.849
The next federal election in Canada will be in 2025, maybe spring 2025, or

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:10.616
or maybe October 2025, and we hope that we can double our score from 5 to 10%.

01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:20.564
We are the only, you know, populist, non-globalist, we are fighting the globalists here in Canada, and we are fighting for our sovereignty.

01:51:21.184 --> 01:51:25.428
And about the subject of assisted suicide or dying,

01:51:26.068 --> 01:51:33.290
It's here in Canada, we are promoting that at different state level also and at the federal level.

01:51:34.251 --> 01:51:36.451
Actually, it's the cult of death.

01:51:37.172 --> 01:51:43.414
You know, we are saying to people, if you want to die, usually it was only at the hospital.

01:51:43.634 --> 01:51:45.374
Now they can do that in their home.

01:51:45.454 --> 01:51:46.915
They can do that in a park.

01:51:47.275 --> 01:51:49.015
They can do that where they want.

01:51:49.715 --> 01:51:54.357
And actually also, you know, the doctor and the nurses

01:51:54.918 --> 01:52:07.813
are able to promote that and our position at the People's Party, it must be criminal and illegal for a doctor or a nurse to promote assisted suicide or dying.

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:09.996
It must come from the individual.

01:52:10.476 --> 01:52:11.656
And that's not the case.

01:52:11.916 --> 01:52:16.878
It's happening when somebody may have cancer or anything.

01:52:17.378 --> 01:52:22.780
They will promote that and say, you know, you can end your life tomorrow if you want.

01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:24.860
Actually, I have a case.

01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:27.761
One of my friends, 60 years old, he had cancer.

01:52:28.361 --> 01:52:31.582
And the doctor said, you know, we can give you assisted suicide.

01:52:31.962 --> 01:52:33.062
And now he's in shape.

01:52:33.162 --> 01:52:36.463
After one year, he had different treatments, and he's in shape.

01:52:36.523 --> 01:52:37.523
He's playing hockey.

01:52:38.023 --> 01:52:42.144
But they were telling him a year ago, we can kill you if you want.

01:52:42.604 --> 01:52:44.004
And so they're right there, right?

01:52:44.044 --> 01:52:55.767
They could totally understand it if somebody would say it to them, that just like Maid, just like the euthanasia in the Netherlands, anybody that wants to jump off the boat right now, it's handy for them.

01:52:57.671 --> 01:52:59.252
Would you mind if we sequenced you first?

01:53:02.894 --> 01:53:05.255
So that's very crazy.

01:53:05.415 --> 01:53:07.616
It's horrible what is happening in our country.

01:53:09.096 --> 01:53:15.781
Well, Maxime, I'm very glad to hear that you're taking the stand, that we all are against the globalist agenda that's taking place.

01:53:15.841 --> 01:53:22.927
And that's really, I have to, by the way, I will pay tribute to you in Canada and to all the great and amazing Canadian people.

01:53:22.947 --> 01:53:28.671
You may not know this, Maxime, but actually I took my inspiration from the trucker movement.

01:53:29.332 --> 01:53:31.053
This is very hard for Robert Malone.

01:53:31.113 --> 01:53:34.236
Robert Malone is not enjoying waiting for his performance.

01:53:35.009 --> 01:53:38.190
the Canadian freedom movement during the pandemic lockdowns.

01:53:38.250 --> 01:53:41.611
I saw the brutality under the Trudeau regime that took place there.

01:53:41.631 --> 01:53:51.835
And I was inspired by you guys to create an international freedom movement, which is now thundering down the tracks and which you wonderful gentlemen are here helping me to get the word out.

01:53:52.075 --> 01:53:54.736
So he's got the international freedom movement.

01:53:54.776 --> 01:53:57.397
Jim Ferguson is the international freedom movement.

01:53:57.457 --> 01:53:59.638
And there's Robert Malone from Malone News.

01:54:00.925 --> 01:54:02.867
And I'm going to come back to Dr. Robert Malone in a moment.

01:54:02.887 --> 01:54:04.929
But I'd just like to say, John, it's great to see you.

01:54:04.969 --> 01:54:10.775
John, you're actually a businessman in England, but you're also a funeral director.

01:54:10.855 --> 01:54:13.137
And we've been talking about COVID a lot.

01:54:13.197 --> 01:54:16.800
You've been on the show a long time with me on different occasions.

01:54:18.122 --> 01:54:30.290
And we were just talking with Dr. Robert Malone a little while ago about this narrative that appears or is appearing more and more in the mainstream media about the potential for an H5N1 pandemic.

01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:32.091
But you were at the cutting edge of it.

01:54:32.151 --> 01:54:35.413
You saw some really bizarre things, didn't you, in your work?

01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:44.292
Yeah, well what we're seeing predominantly now is that people are coming in who are deceased and I have 100% embalm rate.

01:54:44.372 --> 01:54:46.333
So there are two types of death.

01:54:46.393 --> 01:54:49.854
We have an expected death and an unexpected death.

01:54:49.894 --> 01:54:55.056
Where death is unexpected, as the good doctor will be aware, quite often there's a post-mortem.

01:54:55.616 --> 01:55:22.860
During the process of embalming these people we're finding that so now I will just pause it right here that any of the embalmers Like the guy Arna from Germany and this dude anybody with that knowledge needs to be controlled They need to be encouraged to stay focused on that They need to be encouraged to stay focused on the idea that the shot is doing it without coming up with a good explanation for it and

01:55:23.536 --> 01:55:33.364
their testimony then, you know, can be useful to people like Robert Malone to spin it around and say that it's not the methodology in general.

01:55:33.844 --> 01:55:39.509
It's not intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system that's dumb.

01:55:39.929 --> 01:55:43.592
In fact, it's not even the transfection of people that's dumb.

01:55:44.073 --> 01:55:45.153
It's just how we did it.

01:55:46.174 --> 01:55:51.839
We should have done it more carefully, or we should have used a different lipid nanoparticle, or we shouldn't have used the spike.

01:55:56.895 --> 01:55:59.419
full of white fibrous clots.

01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:11.556
It's been predominantly in people that have been COVID vaccinated but we found literally an hour ago the first person who hasn't been COVID vaccinated that is full of white clots.

01:56:12.378 --> 01:56:28.400
and we spoke to the son because he's very awake and asked us to let him know and it transpires this gentleman was being treated for Parkinson's for a number of years and a quick search on the internet reveals that they've been incorporating RNA into Parkinson's treatment

01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.261
certainly for the last couple of years experimentally.

01:56:31.701 --> 01:56:41.526
So this was a guy who wasn't COVID vaccinated but was treated for Parkinson's and would have no doubt had mRNA products and he was full of the white fibrous clots.

01:56:41.586 --> 01:56:53.972
And I can tell you this guy, he called me, his son called me on Christmas Eve, asked me to go to the house and he said his dad wanted to say goodbye to him, to me, because I looked after his wife at the end of September.

01:56:55.024 --> 01:57:12.862
and I went there and held this man's hand and he died a miserable death and he was full of these white clots and here they are, you know, they're a jar full of white fibrous clots freshly taken from a poor soul who died as a result of being poisoned with mRNA.

01:57:13.562 --> 01:57:14.783
So I've been very vocal about it.

01:57:15.936 --> 01:57:20.318
Let me ask you, John, I mean, just just for clarity, I mean, you've been in this business a long time.

01:57:20.338 --> 01:57:23.500
Did you ever see anything like this prior to the vaccine rollout?

01:57:27.486 --> 01:57:28.427
No, not at all.

01:57:28.447 --> 01:57:33.791
And I've got a BIE registered embalmer who's done 25 years who has also never seen it.

01:57:33.951 --> 01:57:44.118
I'm in regular contact with a growing group of internationally based embalmers and coroners who also confirm they've never seen it before, that it's a regular occurrence.

01:57:44.178 --> 01:57:49.882
Now, it's almost being normalized, much like the deaths, the sudden deaths of young football players

01:57:50.322 --> 01:58:00.252
You know, there was a time a number of years ago, I know here in England, we lost a Premiership player or a League One player, an African lad, and he died.

01:58:00.312 --> 01:58:05.717
It transpired that he had a heart condition and there was almost a national day of mourning.

01:58:06.518 --> 01:58:12.464
Universally, everyone came together to mourn the loss of this young lad because it just didn't happen.

01:58:13.166 --> 01:58:15.369
And I can tell you as a funeral director, it didn't happen.

01:58:15.509 --> 01:58:16.951
It's a regular occurrence now.

01:58:17.952 --> 01:58:20.415
And all of these people have been subjected to the mRNA.

01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:27.581
Well, I mean, Dr. Robert Malone, I mean, you have a deep expertise in RNA.

01:58:28.081 --> 01:58:34.743
And maybe you would just give us some thoughts on to that and where you see that may be heading, which direction it's heading.

01:58:34.763 --> 01:58:48.466
Because as John O'Looney has said, there seems to be a desire on the part of certain people, certain organizations to combine maybe more traditional type vaccines like the flu shot, for example, but maybe with RNA or mRNA.

01:58:49.027 --> 01:58:50.887
Can you explain a little bit more about that, please?

01:58:53.556 --> 01:59:03.859
So to understand this, you need to kind of understand the dynamics of the patent positions in the pharmaceutical industry and vaccines in general.

01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:10.201
It's all about the IP.

01:59:13.042 --> 01:59:16.783
Oh my gosh, it's all about the IP.

01:59:16.863 --> 01:59:17.844
Maybe he's not lying.

01:59:20.164 --> 01:59:22.405
I mean, what more do you want?

01:59:24.212 --> 01:59:31.754
How much more obfuscation can somebody do over the course of five years of being a health freedom movement leader?

01:59:34.375 --> 01:59:35.436
Holy crap.

01:59:36.656 --> 01:59:52.641
Nature of this tech, and it's not just the messenger RNA, I'm not being defensive, but it's the combination of the messenger RNA and the cationic lipid formulations that were pioneered at University of British Columbia, as I recall.

01:59:55.017 --> 02:00:00.641
As I recall, I thought Peter Cullis, I thought you called Peter Cullis up and he told you that it was new.

02:00:00.661 --> 02:00:03.883
You awful liar.

02:00:03.943 --> 02:00:05.444
You're so bad at lying.

02:00:05.484 --> 02:00:13.290
You really should have took Mark Twain's advice and just told the truth because then you don't have to remember anything because you're not remembering everything there, Bobby.

02:00:14.261 --> 02:00:18.525
that seem to be associated more with this phenotype.

02:00:18.705 --> 02:00:36.543
And in particular with the COVID jabs, it's been associated with the expression of these recombinant spike proteins that we're now hearing data suggesting that those proteins remain in circulation for up to two years, not tested beyond two years.

02:00:37.364 --> 02:00:38.687
so it may be much longer.

02:00:38.727 --> 02:00:44.540
They have very long half-lifes that were pioneered at University of British Columbia, as I recall.

02:00:46.860 --> 02:01:09.137
that seem to be associated more with this phenotype, and in particular with the COVID jabs, it's been associated with the expression of these recombinant spike proteins that we're now hearing data suggesting that those proteins remain in circulation for up to two years, not tested beyond two years.

02:01:09.957 --> 02:01:11.278
So it may be much longer.

02:01:11.298 --> 02:01:12.859
They have very long half-lives.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:29.411
And the spike protein or these recombinant spikes that have two specific mutations to lock it into a certain conformation, that does seem to be associated with this coagulopathy or blood clotting phenomena.

02:01:29.751 --> 02:01:35.595
And unfortunately, this guy down here just said that they moved Parkinson's therapy to RNA.

02:01:35.616 --> 02:01:38.938
And of course, the Parkinson's therapy doesn't have a spike protein in it.

02:01:41.874 --> 02:01:49.018
And so here he is again, just following the script that he has to follow because they can't go off anymore.

02:01:49.778 --> 02:01:51.779
There's no script to go off of anymore.

02:01:51.819 --> 02:01:53.180
They're stuck where they are.

02:01:54.741 --> 02:02:05.246
And none of these people, not Robert Malone, not Brett Weinstein, not Peter McCullough, not Pierre Corey, not Jessica Rose, none of them knew that it was gonna go this long.

02:02:07.087 --> 02:02:10.249
None of them knew that they would be defending this goal this long.

02:02:11.661 --> 02:02:15.344
None of them knew that they would be defending gain of function this long.

02:02:17.206 --> 02:02:18.707
We should have accepted it by now.

02:02:19.668 --> 02:02:24.832
But they're gonna have to do something drastic in order to get this to actually be taught to our children.

02:02:25.252 --> 02:02:26.813
It ain't happening on my watch.

02:02:28.214 --> 02:02:29.956
Not if this is the best they've got.

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:42.009
catalyzes a particularly fibrous resistant clot, which is what John's talking about, is these white fibrous clots.

02:02:42.349 --> 02:02:44.050
They're kind of almost squid-like.

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:55.338
So it's alarming to hear that that might be occurring in the absence of spike protein being produced from this technology.

02:02:55.498 --> 02:03:01.243
So number one, it seems to be the combination of the formulation.

02:03:01.923 --> 02:03:05.204
in particular, which, by the way, does cross the blood-brain barrier.

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:13.247
So is this something which, by the way, does cross the blood-brain barrier, is that a useful place to augment the immune system?

02:03:17.609 --> 02:03:19.530
What about the ovaries or the bone marrow?

02:03:22.665 --> 02:03:25.066
It's 2025, ladies and gentlemen.

02:03:25.166 --> 02:03:26.907
This is not ineptitude.

02:03:27.527 --> 02:03:35.071
This is not careful, you know, management of his professional career so that he doesn't risk everything.

02:03:35.591 --> 02:03:44.915
This is narrative curation by someone who's working for the slavers, teaching us slave speak and reinforcing the slave speak that this guy's trying not to speak.

02:03:48.597 --> 02:03:50.418
This guy is just like Byron Bridle.

02:03:51.274 --> 02:03:57.399
The only time they can put him on screen is when they've got three other people to make sure that they have someone else to talk to to clarify his ideas.

02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:07.126
Not that dissimilar to what happened to me on the Defender podcast when Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Tess Laurie and Jessica Rose and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:04:07.186 --> 02:04:11.990
all had to say something about my seven minute thesis and none of them said anything useful.

02:04:16.596 --> 02:04:21.660
something that is going to be deployed widely for other indications?

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:43.357
The answer is yes, because it basically represents a whole new domain for pharmaceutical development, which means that it is like a gold rush environment where the pharmaceutical industry is rushing to... Is there a gold rush environment in the diagnostics that define these diseases?

02:04:46.977 --> 02:04:54.271
Is there a gold rush in the diagnostics that define and track these diseases that these people don't seem to care about at all?

02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:17.164
And that may be why they really trash the RNA, you know, and trash it like these vaccines are not very good or it's new or we got to change some things because in the meantime, what's running in the background are all the diagnostics for COVID and RSV and pneumonia and shingles and all this other crap that everybody's testing for and all those products that everybody's selling.

02:05:19.585 --> 02:05:24.086
But you got to start asking yourself is where is his wellness company?

02:05:29.727 --> 02:05:31.728
Where is his FLCCC?

02:05:35.028 --> 02:05:36.289
Where is his sponsor?

02:05:43.731 --> 02:05:52.713
I'm going to escape out of here for a minute and make a quick extra slide if you don't mind.

02:05:52.733 --> 02:05:53.773
It won't take me a second.

02:05:53.973 --> 02:05:56.154
Just let me quickly do this here.

02:06:16.349 --> 02:06:17.269
What did I call it?

02:06:22.391 --> 02:06:23.071
Where is it?

02:06:23.392 --> 02:06:24.572
Why don't I have it there?

02:06:26.773 --> 02:06:27.613
Is it in 4k?

02:06:27.793 --> 02:06:28.834
Oh, it's in the 4k one.

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:29.434
I got it.

02:06:29.554 --> 02:06:30.034
Here it comes.

02:06:30.094 --> 02:06:30.775
Sorry, my bad.

02:06:31.455 --> 02:06:32.095
Just putting it in.

02:06:34.516 --> 02:06:39.578
This is just an anecdotal data point, but it's a real data point.

02:06:41.707 --> 02:06:46.008
I'm not really sure what you want to do with it, but it's a real data point.

02:06:46.668 --> 02:06:49.929
And I think we should be very careful about these data points.

02:06:50.049 --> 02:06:54.170
So, we were just talking about Robert Malone.

02:06:54.190 --> 02:06:56.751
And our guests joining us.

02:06:56.811 --> 02:07:05.053
Listening to him talk to this cover-up, this John O'Looney guy's observation about transfection in general being stupid and healthy people.

02:07:05.733 --> 02:07:18.357
and trying to obfuscate the technology and its weaknesses as much as possible, defend the transition of the old vaccines to these new ones, and not usefully resisting them at all.

02:07:19.218 --> 02:07:22.159
It's disturbing, it's disgusting, I might watch more of it later.

02:07:23.539 --> 02:07:25.320
Here's a video I find very curious.

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:32.062
Hey guys, I'm gonna try to keep this as short and sweet as possible.

02:07:34.076 --> 02:07:35.497
Podcast started December 2019.

02:07:36.657 --> 02:07:44.241
A year later, a guy invested in the show, basically funded the show for three years from April 2021 to April 2024.

02:07:45.021 --> 02:07:46.202
This past April, I guess.

02:07:46.562 --> 02:08:01.709
April 2021 to April of 2024 was funded for three years to sit under a blanket and play video games and also do podcasts with Robert Malone and Stephen Hatfield and Jessica Rose and Matt Crawford.

02:08:05.455 --> 02:08:06.475
Did you hear that?

02:08:10.896 --> 02:08:12.857
Nobody funded me for three years.

02:08:13.357 --> 02:08:15.917
They tried to give me a job doing something else.

02:08:20.578 --> 02:08:30.180
Nobody funded me for three years except for Greg and Jeff and Simon and Steven and Rodney.

02:08:32.901 --> 02:08:33.361
That's it.

02:08:36.854 --> 02:08:39.136
And they're not funding me for three years.

02:08:39.556 --> 02:08:41.878
He got funded for three years!

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:45.481
What does that even mean?

02:08:45.501 --> 02:08:50.425
I hope I get funded for next month.

02:08:52.267 --> 02:08:54.348
And I've been living like that for five years.

02:08:55.670 --> 02:09:03.256
Chasing around these people whose all their bills are paid, who all their travel expenses are covered, and all their hotel breakfasts are free.

02:09:04.957 --> 02:09:05.918
Even in Romania.

02:09:09.387 --> 02:09:17.434
I started to get funding from Frank Speech, Mike Lindell's company, The MyPillow Man, as well as from- The MyPillow Man?

02:09:17.455 --> 02:09:25.422
From a couple different sponsors, like supplement companies or Heaven's Harvest or all that stuff.

02:09:26.463 --> 02:09:31.327
Matt Crawford was on his show with Jessica Rose multiple times.

02:09:32.788 --> 02:09:35.571
Wake up and apologize to me for not knowing that.

02:09:38.251 --> 02:09:46.694
Mark and I are breaking this illusion that these people have created with their shitty little weaponized piles of money here and there.

02:09:47.634 --> 02:09:53.496
Casino money from Macau or laundered money from South Korea.

02:09:53.556 --> 02:09:55.076
I don't know where they're getting their crap.

02:09:58.618 --> 02:10:06.040
I know that somebody like Kevin McCairn, who's all interested in the Jews, has nothing to say about South Korea, except that he got COVID there.

02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:13.633
Not that they would have a population problem to manage or that they're a corrupt country or anything like that.

02:10:14.413 --> 02:10:16.655
Just that he got COVID there and he lives in Japan now.

02:10:20.016 --> 02:10:22.318
Robert Malone, how many times was he on this show?

02:10:22.358 --> 02:10:25.920
How many times was Jessica Rose with Matt Crawford on this show?

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.581
How many times were they on this show?

02:10:27.621 --> 02:10:31.643
If you don't know, you better find out because he just made a giant admission.

02:10:34.844 --> 02:10:49.113
Otherwise, what would Robert Malone and Stephen Hadfield even go on this guy's show for, unless they're all part of the same network of fake conservatives trying to take over, make a populist movement in America to be part of a controlled demolition.

02:10:52.735 --> 02:10:56.538
And this kid is probably just stupid enough to have been used by them.

02:10:58.259 --> 02:11:00.320
Just addicted enough to be used by them.

02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.042
Just as naive enough to be used by them.

02:11:04.346 --> 02:11:15.291
Was he so stupid to think that they would pay a video game player like him for three years to run a podcast that gets 50,000 views on Rumble?

02:11:18.092 --> 02:11:20.013
He thinks he just got lucky or something?

02:11:22.394 --> 02:11:29.057
There was no objectives to be achieved or no requirements to that three years of funding?

02:11:29.777 --> 02:11:30.478
Stop lying!

02:11:34.228 --> 02:11:41.031
And all of those are coming to a close this spring and summer, and I hope I can get them to re-up.

02:11:41.091 --> 02:11:45.672
That's not guaranteed, and I'm not entirely sure what the chances are of that.

02:11:47.033 --> 02:11:50.634
So, I mean, all the sponsors always... I mean, let's just be really honest here, right?

02:11:50.674 --> 02:12:00.298
There's a broken science initiative that's being run by some guy who started the CrossFit movement a long time ago and then lost CrossFit, was bought out,

02:12:02.901 --> 02:12:05.383
He's a very, very, very, very wealthy man.

02:12:08.566 --> 02:12:18.915
And he has flown me to a couple of his Broken Science meetings and sometimes even flown my family there so that we get a long weekend together in Arizona or in California.

02:12:20.636 --> 02:12:23.398
But let me make one thing crystal clear.

02:12:23.478 --> 02:12:26.361
He never gave me a dime to pay for rent.

02:12:27.133 --> 02:12:32.517
Never gave me a dime to pay for coffee or for bologna sandwiches for my kids.

02:12:32.797 --> 02:12:33.437
Not a dime.

02:12:39.101 --> 02:12:42.003
And so do I believe in the Broken Science Initiative?

02:12:42.043 --> 02:12:44.065
Do I think that they're going to accomplish anything?

02:12:44.145 --> 02:12:45.066
Quite frankly, no.

02:12:50.589 --> 02:12:51.370
I don't think they will.

02:12:53.848 --> 02:12:59.173
Because if they wanted to accomplish something significant, then there would be many different ways to do it.

02:12:59.313 --> 02:13:01.455
And one of them would be gigaohm biological.

02:13:04.097 --> 02:13:11.483
You wouldn't need to get me on board with the principles of broken science when I'm doing the work that I'm doing.

02:13:13.205 --> 02:13:14.286
You would just support it.

02:13:15.707 --> 02:13:16.848
But that's not what happened.

02:13:18.553 --> 02:13:33.224
Instead, at three different broken science meetings, I got confronted by Jay Bhattacharya, who started the first time we met by telling me that he wasn't sophisticated enough to evaluate my biology.

02:13:33.685 --> 02:13:38.769
And the last time we saw each other at a broken science meeting, he told me three different times.

02:13:41.831 --> 02:13:45.514
Like lunch, and then dinner, and then breakfast the next day.

02:13:47.383 --> 02:13:49.744
that I really needed to lay off of Robert Malone.

02:13:52.225 --> 02:13:57.647
The same guy that CHD and Mary Holland fired me for talking about on December 22nd, 2023.

02:13:59.888 --> 02:14:11.373
Same guy who's been on Tommy podcast multiple times with Steven Hatfill, most certainly a Deep State operative from 20 years ago already.

02:14:17.469 --> 02:14:18.630
You either see it or you don't.

02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:20.272
You either want to get free or you don't.

02:14:20.332 --> 02:14:22.033
You either want to spread the truth or you don't.

02:14:22.094 --> 02:14:26.358
You're either interested in actually learning something and therefore you're going to do the work yourself or you won't.

02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.142
But right now the window's wide open.

02:14:31.202 --> 02:14:33.304
Right now the back door is wide open.

02:14:33.385 --> 02:14:36.127
Right now all you got to do is run.

02:14:36.147 --> 02:14:40.772
And you can clear the shelves of every store

02:14:41.533 --> 02:14:52.461
You can clear the shelves of every social media platform you've ever been on, and you can put this stuff permanently in an archive to make sure that we never lose this history.

02:14:53.802 --> 02:15:03.289
This history, when seen by anyone, reveals the illusion, the mythologies, the curators, and the lies.

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:09.373
As I mentioned, using promo codes and all that good stuff and blah, blah, blah.

02:15:11.516 --> 02:15:15.979
This is a direct, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, this is a direct appeal to y'all.

02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:20.843
There's about 50,000 of you guys that regularly watch this show.

02:15:21.804 --> 02:15:25.247
The show requires about 60 grand a year to run.

02:15:25.267 --> 02:15:26.648
It's about five grand a month.

02:15:27.388 --> 02:15:31.292
I live by myself, I have no kids, I have no ex or wife.

02:15:31.552 --> 02:15:41.643
He has no kids, he lives by himself, and he wants you to give him $5,000 a month for what he does after five years hasn't figured out shit and still doesn't have a message.

02:15:43.524 --> 02:15:47.508
This is the American version of Ahmed Malik minus an MD.

02:15:50.712 --> 02:15:58.876
Ahmed Malik also wants you to give him money, although he hasn't figured anything out, doesn't have a stance on anything, and just thinks we should all be health freedom people.

02:15:59.576 --> 02:16:12.983
Just like Mary Holland, who's had a platform for more than a decade and hasn't gotten any farther with expressing the problem that we have with our government and the future enslavement that is intended.

02:16:16.584 --> 02:16:17.865
They all want your money.

02:16:17.925 --> 02:16:19.506
They all want their donations.

02:16:19.746 --> 02:16:24.830
Every one of the people in that CHD picture is getting more than $100,000 a year.

02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:25.951
How do you explain that?

02:16:27.992 --> 02:16:32.795
They have like 60 people in that picture and they haven't accomplished jack shit.

02:16:36.778 --> 02:16:39.040
Mary Holland was on Democracy Now!

02:16:40.916 --> 02:16:58.276
opposite Paul Offit in 2015 and since then they haven't accomplished jack shit except for rise and resist people over profits truth over lies and courage over fear that's as far as Mary Holland and CHD have gotten in a decade

02:17:02.932 --> 02:17:04.172
And he's got no message.

02:17:04.973 --> 02:17:09.014
He's just a podcast that just plays video games under a blanket.

02:17:09.494 --> 02:17:11.814
And he needs $5,000 a month.

02:17:11.914 --> 02:17:19.136
I've got a 15-year-old son in basketball and in high school, at the same high school where Matthew Crooks came from.

02:17:20.017 --> 02:17:25.278
At the same high school where the guy who supposedly shot Donald Trump a couple months ago came from.

02:17:26.772 --> 02:17:30.514
And I've got a kid in a middle school in the same district.

02:17:30.574 --> 02:17:34.716
And I've got a little girl in elementary school in the same district.

02:17:34.776 --> 02:17:42.219
And I was a faculty member at a US medical school at the start of the pandemic and lost my job for speaking out against shit like this.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.181
And we only need about $4,000 a month to survive.

02:17:49.042 --> 02:17:50.303
And we'd gladly take three.

02:17:53.072 --> 02:18:02.540
So, you know, decide who you want to support, decide whose work is worth supporting, and decide what this means for all the people that were on his show.

02:18:07.064 --> 02:18:20.556
And then realize that there's Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein and the $100 million contract of Joe Rogan and countless other examples of the same thing, only just slightly different and dumber.

02:18:22.677 --> 02:18:48.091
with a different way of explaining how they got there, but the same level of ineptitude, the same level of lack of understanding or lack of message, just giving people platforms and letting them talk and then reiterating the questions and the arguments that they just heard without usefully condensing them or usefully thinking about them or offering their own opinion.

02:18:51.645 --> 02:18:54.786
or pets or college deaths or anything.

02:18:55.566 --> 02:19:01.808
The show is running bare bones and the reason it's important... How does he spend $5,000 if it's bare bones?

02:19:01.868 --> 02:19:02.628
What's his rent?

02:19:04.449 --> 02:19:07.090
What's his... It cost me $40 a month for my internet.

02:19:07.130 --> 02:19:08.810
Cost me about $150 for electricity.

02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:10.050
We pay $2,400 a month and rent at this shitty house.

02:19:16.107 --> 02:19:18.489
Because in Pittsburgh, there's no homes to rent.

02:19:18.969 --> 02:19:21.111
Go look, Zillow will show you.

02:19:21.811 --> 02:19:27.795
And the ones that are for rent are all owned by LLCs that own like 50 houses.

02:19:27.956 --> 02:19:29.297
It's all happening right now.

02:19:29.337 --> 02:19:31.278
We are being enslaved right now.

02:19:32.499 --> 02:19:38.343
I'm a 53 year old guy who pursued tenure for 20 years and I didn't even have a chance to buy a house once.

02:19:38.823 --> 02:19:42.126
The one chance that I had to buy a house I lost during the pandemic.

02:19:43.834 --> 02:19:49.880
And as soon as they found out I lost the house, Charles Rixey started telling the whole world that he lost a house.

02:19:54.264 --> 02:19:59.610
Now this guy has lost all of his funding and they might not re-up.

02:20:01.567 --> 02:20:08.631
And he really needs your support, just like Doc Mollick really needs your support because, you know, he built that studio all by himself in the backyard.

02:20:09.311 --> 02:20:13.773
And he gave up running five, five miles a week to do that podcast for you.

02:20:14.013 --> 02:20:14.974
That's why he's fat.

02:20:17.162 --> 02:20:25.306
And that it's bare bones and it's just me is that means there's no oversight, there's no committee, there's no, you know, focus grouping stuff.

02:20:26.487 --> 02:20:30.869
And I'm not beholden to anyone, which makes it so that I can talk to anyone about anything.

02:20:31.049 --> 02:20:39.533
I'm not beholden to anyone except I'm asking for some money because the people that were, I was beholden to for three years, stop paying me.

02:20:43.315 --> 02:20:44.456
This guy has no clue.

02:20:49.625 --> 02:20:51.826
regardless of how spicy the topic is.

02:20:53.786 --> 02:20:59.508
That's why we are here where Robert Malone is pretending to call out Peter McCullough as BS.

02:21:00.128 --> 02:21:10.791
The same way that Matt Crawford and Robert Malone were trying to convince me that we should call out Peter McCullough at the inaugural CHD conference in Knoxville in 2022.

02:21:11.531 --> 02:21:14.092
Mark Kulak can verify that because he was also there.

02:21:15.012 --> 02:21:17.493
Charles Rixey can also verify that because he was there.

02:21:19.875 --> 02:21:26.197
And at the time they had a little meeting about the wellness company and whether people were being controlled by the wellness company.

02:21:26.217 --> 02:21:29.398
Maybe Peter McCullough was being controlled by the wellness company.

02:21:33.259 --> 02:21:46.523
That's why it's weird that Peter McCullough's substack promotes a substack of Harvey Reich and Harvey Reich is saying that Robert Malone is a great guy.

02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:55.987
So within a week on X, Robert Malone calls Peter McCullough full of shit and then engaging in clickbait.

02:21:57.148 --> 02:22:08.537
But then a week or less later on Peter McCullough's substack, Peter McCullough promotes the substack of Harvey Reich, also present in Romania.

02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:14.442
And Harvey Reich says that Robert Malone got it right on all this stuff.

02:22:16.052 --> 02:22:19.013
It's almost like the fake opposition corrects itself.

02:22:19.133 --> 02:22:24.595
It's almost like the fake opposition only really does it a little bit and then goes right back to promoting each other.

02:22:25.135 --> 02:22:27.236
Almost like they're all one great big team.

02:22:34.998 --> 02:22:43.001
I mean, this, this, this substack that Paul Alexander puts out with my name in it, JJ, did he do the, did JJ provide the blueprint?

02:22:43.401 --> 02:22:45.642
And then the entire God dang thing

02:22:48.058 --> 02:23:01.250
is about the defuse proposal that since Bobby's book I've been trying to tell people is bullshit, that they just leaked some perfect document to prove that gain-of-function is real and that they can spray it in bat caves.

02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:07.195
Since Drastic tried to get me to believe in that document, I thought it was bullshit.

02:23:07.635 --> 02:23:12.860
So much so that in January of 2022, Charles Rixey came to my house and made me stream about it.

02:23:13.939 --> 02:23:23.884
the same stream that supposedly caught the attention of Robert Malone and made him put, sit Robert F. Kennedy down and Ron Johnson down and make him watch my stream.

02:23:26.305 --> 02:23:41.973
And here we have, have Paul Alexander, the guy who brought his wife and daughter to my house a couple of weeks ago, writing a sub stack without one gosh darn link to my work, but mentioning my name twice in the context of this bullshit.

02:23:45.523 --> 02:23:47.184
And so is Paul a good guy?

02:23:48.204 --> 02:23:49.565
How can I see him as a good guy?

02:23:49.585 --> 02:23:50.465
Is he helping me?

02:23:51.846 --> 02:23:52.866
Is this helping me?

02:23:53.567 --> 02:23:57.188
Is this a sign that Paul understands my message?

02:23:59.189 --> 02:24:03.951
It doesn't matter if he writes his own sub stack or just lets people put whatever they have to put on there.

02:24:05.312 --> 02:24:10.854
The bottom line is that he's not helping my family any more than Robert Malone is, any more than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:24:10.914 --> 02:24:14.436
is, or Merrill Nass, or Kevin McKernan.

02:24:15.458 --> 02:24:23.222
They're all united in the same bullshit narrative about the diffuse proposal gain of function contaminated shots.

02:24:27.305 --> 02:24:28.685
This guy's the wellness company.

02:24:28.725 --> 02:24:29.546
So what am I doing?

02:24:29.586 --> 02:24:30.627
What's happening here?

02:24:31.127 --> 02:24:33.188
Why are these people coming to my house?

02:24:36.010 --> 02:24:38.491
They're coming to my house because this is broken.

02:24:38.891 --> 02:24:41.873
This is breaking and it's breaking because of me.

02:24:44.758 --> 02:24:50.707
That's why the pseudonym of Jikki Leakes, Dr. A.K.

02:24:50.767 --> 02:24:59.320
Saeed, or whatever the hell his name is, has got to try to convince you that Mark Kulak and I and George Webb are all one connected, interconnected network.

02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:05.573
That's why Kevin McCairn doesn't scrutinize Robert Malone at all.

02:25:05.693 --> 02:25:07.814
Rixey doesn't scrutinize Robert Malone at all.

02:25:08.275 --> 02:25:10.236
Jickey thinks Robert Malone's a good guy.

02:25:10.296 --> 02:25:19.223
That's why Robert Malone and Pierre Corey and Peter McCullough had to go down and testify in front of the Senate in Australia.

02:25:19.283 --> 02:25:22.325
Not just random doctors, but those three guys.

02:25:23.086 --> 02:25:30.431
Same guys that are on all the international COVID summits and in front of the European Parliament and in front of the UK Parliament and in front of the Senate.

02:25:32.383 --> 02:25:34.685
Because this is a truth that needs curating.

02:25:34.725 --> 02:25:36.647
It's not something that anybody can say.

02:25:36.667 --> 02:25:48.536
And this account and its Jikki Leaks counterpart is the same exact group of meddlers.

02:25:48.576 --> 02:25:56.683
It wouldn't even be surprising to me if somebody like Jessica Hockett was behind this or Nick Hudson because of how much they pretended to hate this account.

02:25:57.964 --> 02:26:01.467
Actually, I have a DM in Twitter where

02:26:02.649 --> 02:26:11.271
Jonathan Engler is actually gloating to me that he was the first person on Twitter to actually out Jikki Leaks as this doctor.

02:26:13.032 --> 02:26:17.653
And Jessica Hockett is actually the one who sent me the link to his tweet saying, isn't this hilarious?

02:26:20.113 --> 02:26:26.035
They have revealed themselves to me by lying to me over five years.

02:26:26.155 --> 02:26:27.155
That's why I'm angry.

02:26:27.215 --> 02:26:28.435
That's why I'm not gonna quit.

02:26:29.695 --> 02:26:31.856
Because you haven't seen the alien that I have.

02:26:33.131 --> 02:26:34.693
They haven't come to your house.

02:26:41.899 --> 02:26:54.732
It's pretty creepy right now that the guy who's going to be the new head of the HHS, the guy who's going to be the new head of the NIH, those seem to be photographs with me and them.

02:26:57.861 --> 02:27:04.583
It's gonna be really weird when the Senate committee asks Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:27:04.643 --> 02:27:15.206
about his Wuhan cover-up book that he wrote, and asks him about the list of experts without whom's expertise the book would not have been possible, and the first name is mine.

02:27:18.247 --> 02:27:23.549
Every one of these photographs with Jay Bhattacharya is taken at a Broken Science Initiative meeting.

02:27:29.094 --> 02:27:30.095
I wonder what that means.

02:27:31.957 --> 02:27:35.481
All these other pictures with Robert Malone and stuff are taken at CHD meetings.

02:27:35.961 --> 02:27:38.203
There's Whitney Webb at a CHD meeting.

02:27:42.848 --> 02:27:46.952
At some point, you guys are gonna have to wake up and realize that this is not by accident.

02:27:49.134 --> 02:27:50.596
These people tried hard.

02:27:51.829 --> 02:28:02.553
to get me to do what they needed me to do, for me to be their performing monkey, like Alex Washburn is, or like the US Right to Know Girl is.

02:28:07.255 --> 02:28:08.656
They wanted that badly.

02:28:09.936 --> 02:28:13.318
Now the bottom line is you're gonna see the truth from the other side, because how?

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:19.280
Because if the Democrats wanted to sink these nominations, I'm your man.

02:28:21.693 --> 02:28:25.797
If the Democrats wanted to sink these nominations, I'm your man.

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:30.921
If Big Pharma wanted to sink these nominations, I'm your man.

02:28:33.563 --> 02:28:35.885
And guess who ain't gonna get a phone call from any of those?

02:28:37.506 --> 02:28:38.107
That would be me.

02:28:39.228 --> 02:28:40.309
Because that's not the goal.

02:28:41.450 --> 02:28:42.771
It is a coordinated effort.

02:28:43.972 --> 02:28:45.353
It is a coordinated script.

02:28:46.314 --> 02:28:47.675
And these people are all on it.

02:28:48.786 --> 02:28:56.571
And the script may have had changes being made or it may be delayed or off course, off the calendar because of what we've done.

02:28:58.612 --> 02:29:02.194
But I'm not under any false pretenses of what I've actually done.

02:29:03.535 --> 02:29:09.338
Because I know that the vast majority of people on earth don't know who I am and don't know who Robert Malone is either.

02:29:13.401 --> 02:29:15.522
But ladies and gentlemen, these people know who I am.

02:29:17.853 --> 02:29:28.622
and the fact that they all universally ignore me is the best evidence that I can provide to you that these people are coordinating their lives.

02:29:29.722 --> 02:29:35.267
They are participating in a theater that they are auditioning to maintain their role in.

02:29:35.827 --> 02:29:40.491
Not that dissimilar to Tommy, except Tommy doesn't understand that he failed the audition.

02:29:43.188 --> 02:29:46.491
Tommy doesn't understand that he failed their audition.

02:29:46.892 --> 02:29:54.540
He did not rise to a level of usefulness that is economically valuable to them anymore.

02:29:55.461 --> 02:29:57.663
He didn't wrangle enough cats.

02:29:58.864 --> 02:30:02.568
The Danny Jones podcast is much better than the Tommy podcast.

02:30:03.008 --> 02:30:04.450
So why would they re-up?

02:30:07.671 --> 02:30:13.776
The Julian Michaels podcast is better than the Tommy podcast, and she's prettier, so why wouldn't they just support her?

02:30:14.197 --> 02:30:14.957
Don't you see?

02:30:15.318 --> 02:30:17.119
The Callie Means podcast.

02:30:19.601 --> 02:30:21.423
The Casey Means podcast.

02:30:22.704 --> 02:30:24.025
The Defender podcast.

02:30:24.485 --> 02:30:25.426
Why would they support?

02:30:25.546 --> 02:30:26.647
You missed your audition.

02:30:27.488 --> 02:30:30.911
You had three years to get your shit together, and you blew it.

02:30:31.431 --> 02:30:32.432
That's what happened, Tommy.

02:30:33.533 --> 02:30:35.695
I had three years to get my shit together.

02:30:36.701 --> 02:30:37.701
And I guess I blew it too.

02:30:42.203 --> 02:30:43.523
And that's why they all ignore me.

02:30:44.543 --> 02:30:45.644
That's why we're here right now.

02:30:45.704 --> 02:30:46.664
That's the scary part.

02:30:47.244 --> 02:30:49.125
This, this.

02:30:53.846 --> 02:30:54.386
Look at it.

02:30:56.287 --> 02:30:59.388
And then you're gonna say, oh, but there's you and Mark Kulak down here in the bottom.

02:30:59.408 --> 02:31:06.250
Yeah, Mark Kulak is sitting next to John Baldwin.

02:31:07.244 --> 02:31:22.128
who of course is absolutely positively now a part of that Team Robert Malone, Team Steve Kirsch, Team Kevin McKernan for over a year now, claims to be afraid of me because I yelled at him on the phone.

02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:26.329
This guy right down here, that's John Bodwin.

02:31:26.369 --> 02:31:32.031
Guess who he had breakfast with the morning of Bobby's announcement where we are in this picture.

02:31:32.851 --> 02:31:34.171
Can you see me down here in the corner?

02:31:34.492 --> 02:31:35.592
It's right here behind my head.

02:31:36.724 --> 02:31:38.225
It's this picture that I'm talking about.

02:31:38.305 --> 02:31:39.465
This is John Bodwin.

02:31:40.025 --> 02:31:44.167
This is Mark Kulak and myself right here.

02:31:44.667 --> 02:31:45.727
And that's John Bodwin.

02:31:46.447 --> 02:31:51.709
And we are all at Bobby's announcement in Boston, where he announces he's gonna be president.

02:31:52.169 --> 02:31:55.690
And sitting a couple rows in front of us is Robert Malone.

02:31:55.730 --> 02:32:03.113
And sitting behind us, who John Bodwin had bagels and coffee with in the morning, is Meryl Nass.

02:32:06.007 --> 02:32:07.167
and Abby Rockefeller.

02:32:12.770 --> 02:32:22.674
At this inaugural, at this announcement when Meryl Nass and Robert Malone met at the front of the stage before the announcement happened, they hugged without words.

02:32:25.255 --> 02:32:34.078
As closely as Steve Bannon hugged Lee Min Yan after her presentation that we've watched, Robert Malone and Meryl Nass hugged in a way that

02:32:36.276 --> 02:32:37.658
I wouldn't hug any of these people.

02:32:42.903 --> 02:32:52.372
But somehow, this guy named Jickie Leakes and this guy named Robert Malone want you to believe that I'm the bad guy.

02:32:53.994 --> 02:32:56.336
Mary Holland wants you to believe that I'm the bad guy.

02:33:02.833 --> 02:33:06.117
It's a very, very, very big time situation that we're in, ladies and gentlemen.

02:33:06.157 --> 02:33:11.202
Robert Malone has done a nice admission of the three.

02:33:11.442 --> 02:33:20.332
So the September 21st International COVID Summit was in Rome, where he also spoke to the Vatican, and we can watch that video tomorrow.

02:33:21.373 --> 02:33:23.676
International COVID Summit Two was in France.

02:33:26.410 --> 02:33:32.713
International COVID Summit 3 was in Brussels at the Parliament in the EU.

02:33:34.573 --> 02:33:38.315
International COVID Summit 4 was in Bucharest, Romania.

02:33:38.355 --> 02:33:44.397
That's the one that I say is probably the most revealing because that, I mean, Stephen Hatfield was there.

02:33:45.277 --> 02:33:46.278
Nick Hudson was there.

02:33:46.298 --> 02:33:47.558
Ryan Cole was there.

02:33:47.818 --> 02:33:51.320
Both Glasspool Malone and Bobby Malone were there.

02:33:54.237 --> 02:33:56.139
Jesse Rose was there.

02:33:58.901 --> 02:34:00.382
Jay Kristoff was there.

02:34:00.783 --> 02:34:02.284
Denny Rancor was there.

02:34:03.505 --> 02:34:04.887
Byron Bridle was there.

02:34:05.948 --> 02:34:07.169
Mary Nass was there.

02:34:10.871 --> 02:34:13.073
And then in November, I'm sorry.

02:34:13.093 --> 02:34:21.562
And then in 2024, they had a CPAC at International COVID Summit Five was in Washington, DC, finally in America.

02:34:22.343 --> 02:34:29.490
And then in September, 2024, they went to the Japanese parliament to talk about the self-replicating RNA problem.

02:34:30.991 --> 02:34:32.673
And so you can go download all of those.

02:34:32.693 --> 02:34:34.555
You can look at who was there.

02:34:36.112 --> 02:34:38.113
And what you will see is just meddlers.

02:34:38.693 --> 02:34:41.574
People that never saved anyone.

02:34:42.294 --> 02:34:43.694
They didn't save anyone.

02:34:45.035 --> 02:34:47.615
The first international COVID summit was September, 2021.

02:34:48.536 --> 02:34:57.558
I thought there was something in, like off the coast of Florida or something that they all told me about, but maybe that was before this.

02:34:59.319 --> 02:35:00.899
This is the one in Romania.

02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:03.700
This is the one that I think reveals the most.

02:35:03.780 --> 02:35:05.361
Oh yeah, Brett Weinstein was there also.

02:35:06.323 --> 02:35:08.005
Of course, why wouldn't he go to Romania?

02:35:08.345 --> 02:35:11.768
Maybe they were all meeting with the Tate brothers, because those guys are really cool.

02:35:15.092 --> 02:35:17.954
A lot of those same people have spoken in front of the Senate several times.

02:35:18.014 --> 02:35:29.726
I actually met this guy in person, this Matthias Desmet, at the Brownstone meeting, and I actually told him about how RNA cannot pandemic in Dutch.

02:35:31.795 --> 02:35:40.500
I explained it to him very well and I challenged him to have Robert Malone or Meryl Nass or any of these other people that have manipulated him into being part of the problem.

02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:49.164
You should have them sometime over coffee or maybe tomorrow morning over breakfast, have them explain to you how RNA can pandemic.

02:35:50.445 --> 02:35:59.670
Have them explain to you how gain of function viruses are able to go around the earth indefinitely despite not having any machinery of their own.

02:36:00.708 --> 02:36:01.929
They won't be able to do it.

02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:05.832
Ask them about transfection, is what I told him.

02:36:06.512 --> 02:36:13.697
He was very frightened of me, but he listened, and he listened because I spoke in Dutch, and he was a little bit shocked.

02:36:15.558 --> 02:36:27.607
I also spoke to three Dutch doctors who were there at the Brownstone meeting, and they were also equally shocked at my ability to succinctly say that the pandemic is bullshit, but no virus is also bullshit.

02:36:30.851 --> 02:36:32.712
And I was able to do that already three years ago.

02:36:32.752 --> 02:36:49.658
That's why Kevin McCarron had such a conniption on that stream with Mark Bailey, because they had to do that performance in order to try desperately to get me back onto their stupid dichotomous narrative of no virus virus, you know, terrain theory or germs or some crap like that.

02:36:53.159 --> 02:36:56.500
They don't want to talk about the fact that the human population is at a peak.

02:36:57.739 --> 02:37:01.903
It's gonna be at this peak for another generation or so, and then it's gonna go down very fast.

02:37:02.424 --> 02:37:16.919
The birth rate's already collapsing because of dipshits like my brother who think that he's actually contributing something useful to humanity by not having children, although maybe he is, because he's probably not qualified to raise a critically thinking human being.

02:37:21.215 --> 02:37:22.876
I'm mad, ladies and gentlemen.

02:37:22.916 --> 02:37:24.836
I'm mad because my friend Nathan is dead.

02:37:24.896 --> 02:37:26.777
I'm mad because my friend Annie is dead.

02:37:26.817 --> 02:37:29.458
I'm mad because my father-in-law is dead.

02:37:29.478 --> 02:37:31.519
And I'm mad because my sister-in-law is dead.

02:37:31.899 --> 02:37:41.263
And I'm mad because I gave my daughter the entire American vaccine schedule until she was two years old, and CHD didn't save her from that either.

02:37:47.265 --> 02:37:49.766
Only my wife did by delaying it and breastfeeding her.

02:37:53.123 --> 02:37:53.903
I didn't do shit.

02:37:58.485 --> 02:38:01.426
They only have one chance that there's this many people on the planet.

02:38:01.466 --> 02:38:10.248
They only have one chance to invert this many kids into experimental animals without them even knowing it because their parents just allow it to happen.

02:38:11.088 --> 02:38:15.110
The same parents that are allowing them to grow up on social media.

02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:20.231
We only have one chance to save our children from this, ladies and gentlemen.

02:38:20.911 --> 02:38:22.752
One chance, and it starts right now.

02:38:25.831 --> 02:38:26.971
The protocols were murdered.

02:38:26.991 --> 02:38:32.612
Gain of function is a mythology and the mystery that they tricked you into solving is ongoing right now.

02:38:32.692 --> 02:38:36.373
And the spectacular commitment to lies is all that's required to sustain it.

02:38:37.553 --> 02:38:40.274
Healthy people don't get sick, ladies and gentlemen, that's the truth.

02:38:40.494 --> 02:38:41.614
RNA cannot pandemic.

02:38:41.634 --> 02:38:42.834
And we can think our way out.

02:38:43.275 --> 02:38:45.235
We can help our children think their way out.

02:38:46.455 --> 02:38:48.756
And we can do that by teaching them a new biology.

02:38:48.856 --> 02:38:50.216
I want a nonprofit

02:38:51.624 --> 02:39:04.389
a gigaohm biological nonprofit in January of 2025, funded to make this book, funded to make this coursework, funded to start changing the world.

02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:09.471
Because CHD ain't gonna do it, ICANN's not gonna do it, and voting is not gonna do it.

02:39:10.291 --> 02:39:12.812
Bobby Kennedy's not gonna do it, we're gonna do it.

02:39:15.093 --> 02:39:18.534
One teacher at a time, one kid at a time, one adult at a time.

02:39:20.308 --> 02:39:23.012
One irreducibly complex human at a time.

02:39:23.894 --> 02:39:24.935
One person at a time.

02:39:27.639 --> 02:39:31.445
No one is talking about how the PCR diagnostics are still fraudulent.

02:39:32.426 --> 02:39:34.690
How the lateral flow tests are still fraudulent.

02:39:35.825 --> 02:40:02.129
Nobody's talking about this giant pile of weaponized money being produced by these shitty products, by the remnant sales in hospitals that started already a long time ago, is the source of all of these cell culture materials, and is the way that the Human Genome Project is going to make progress going forward, the generation of remnants and their sale and reuse.

02:40:03.835 --> 02:40:05.717
None of these people will ever talk about that.

02:40:05.797 --> 02:40:13.244
Not Jessica Rose, not Kevin McCairn, not Kevin McKernan, not Charles Rixey, not Peter McCullough, not Pierre Cory.

02:40:13.324 --> 02:40:15.486
None of them will talk about these truths.

02:40:19.369 --> 02:40:21.792
None of them will talk about gain-of-function mythologies.

02:40:21.832 --> 02:40:26.516
None of them will talk about anything in 2020 or 2021, because if they did, they would reveal the truth.

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:39.009
Our health freedom movement in 2015 was that some vaccines are good but remain untested, processed foods are bad, exercise is good, and fluoride in the water is bad, and air pollution is bad.

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:41.431
And in 2025, we haven't moved.

02:40:43.213 --> 02:40:47.456
Except now we're talking about self-amplifying RNA and the fact that that's real too.

02:40:49.658 --> 02:40:51.540
There's been no progress in 10 years.

02:40:53.814 --> 02:40:58.218
The health freedom movement is a failure, by design, by sabotage.

02:40:58.959 --> 02:41:05.465
And it is sabotaged by slave speak, like rise and resist, people over profits, truth over lies, courage over fear.

02:41:05.805 --> 02:41:09.609
The health freedom movement is slave speak.

02:41:14.755 --> 02:41:17.296
That's why they had the movie Vax and it never got anywhere.

02:41:17.356 --> 02:41:19.537
That's why they had books and they never got anywhere.

02:41:19.897 --> 02:41:21.917
That's why they had books and never got anywhere.

02:41:21.937 --> 02:41:31.381
And that's why the people who had books and movies at the start of the pandemic had a fear and cleavage site and no virus and nothing else, but a health freedom movement.

02:41:31.441 --> 02:41:41.584
That's why at the start of the pandemic, the people that had books, the people that had podcasts, the people that had a voice had no message.

02:41:42.644 --> 02:41:44.305
And that's why they have no message now.

02:41:45.788 --> 02:42:08.440
because they are having the self-freedom movement manned by people like Robert Malone, manned by people like Steve Bannon, manned by people like Jimmy Dore, who despite meeting in person and getting a personalized copy of the book that says they're liars, hasn't had the guts to have me on his show or even have a conversation on the phone.

02:42:11.616 --> 02:42:15.179
And that's why Children's Health Defense is selling a shit book like this.

02:42:15.519 --> 02:42:33.514
And that's why General Michael Flynn, probably one of the co-authors of the whole QAnon movement, and a very staunch supporter of people like the Catholic movie producer, Steve Bannon, and the populist movement behind Donald Trump.

02:42:36.777 --> 02:42:38.479
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

02:42:39.517 --> 02:42:49.385
That's why Jimmy Dore can't see it, and a guy who was on the radio with Bobby Kennedy for 10 years can't see it, and why in Germany they're saying that Elon Musk is a bad guy.

02:42:50.846 --> 02:42:52.227
Because it's all the same show.

02:42:52.548 --> 02:42:55.990
Just like COVID was a show, it's a continuation of the same show.

02:42:56.351 --> 02:43:06.079
That's why we're here in January of 2025, and I'm still stuck in the back of my garage, renting my house, struggling for rent, because slave speak

02:43:07.478 --> 02:43:08.559
is how we argue now.

02:43:09.119 --> 02:43:12.440
Slave speak is how we fight on social media.

02:43:13.301 --> 02:43:18.563
Instead of using the language that I've been trying to develop, these people are perpetuating the slave speak.

02:43:19.764 --> 02:43:27.768
These people agree to share one another's social media accounts and promote one another's articles in order to promote the slave speak.

02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:34.271
If they were really fighting against the slavers, then they would take this language and run with it.

02:43:35.410 --> 02:43:43.009
And any one of these people with guts would say, you know, Jonathan Couey is really abrasive, but gosh darn, that summary slide is kick-ass.

02:43:46.052 --> 02:43:48.853
They're not gonna say it ladies and gentlemen, but I will keep saying it.

02:43:48.913 --> 02:43:54.614
And if you like what I'm saying and want me to keep saying it, please go to gigaohmbiological.com and find a way to support this stream.

02:43:55.055 --> 02:44:05.477
And if you can't do that, at least try to find a way to share it by either downloading it or sharing the links to stream.gigaohm.bio because Ted and I and Mark maintain that and we're making it better.

02:44:05.537 --> 02:44:06.878
We're upping the bandwidth.

02:44:07.878 --> 02:44:13.622
The messaging system and the email system of PeerTube and Soapbox is soon going to be linked.

02:44:14.023 --> 02:44:20.247
And we're also going to be able to download audio only very soon, which means you can download this podcast or post it elsewhere.

02:44:20.608 --> 02:44:21.868
And I encourage you to do that.

02:44:21.928 --> 02:44:25.431
For example, if Jeff from Earth wants to take the audio from my

02:44:27.072 --> 02:44:36.736
my shows and just make a podcast for me on any number of podcast things and maintain that by doing that every time I do a show, more power to you.

02:44:36.776 --> 02:44:40.237
You want to do it in Norway, you want to do it in Germany, do it, do it, do it.

02:44:40.757 --> 02:44:42.418
Take my work and run.

02:44:43.078 --> 02:44:44.739
Take my words and run.

02:44:46.119 --> 02:44:47.800
Save your grandchildren with them.

02:44:48.772 --> 02:44:50.493
I love you all very much, ladies and gentlemen.

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:51.233
Thanks for being here.

02:44:51.253 --> 02:44:52.694
I'll be here again tomorrow.

02:44:53.295 --> 02:44:54.215
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:44:54.255 --> 02:44:59.898
This is Gigo and Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:07.583
Very happy, very excited.

02:45:07.843 --> 02:45:09.544
2025 is when we take it to a new level.

02:45:11.983 --> 02:45:13.426
Sorry I haven't gotten a hardwood.

02:45:13.446 --> 02:45:15.671
The hardwood is still being edited.

02:45:15.711 --> 02:45:21.983
It's like a 40 minute one and I needed all kinds of graphics and so it's really... Editing is a lot of work.
