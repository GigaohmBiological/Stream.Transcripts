WEBVTT

00:18.268 --> 00:25.434
Actually, JJ Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:08.083 --> 01:11.066
have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:37.423 --> 01:38.584
I don't care how you get there.

01:38.604 --> 01:41.326
I don't care what you do to get there.

01:41.346 --> 01:43.948
The goal is to win.

02:01.192 --> 02:14.420
Good morning to Howard the Duck, Julianita, Solar Fire, Sooth Spider, Fletch Garden Variety, Human Brother Spoon, Solar Bees, Atari Mama.

02:15.549 --> 02:16.930
My Fauna and Tazik's Cube.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.612
Wow, lots of people in the chat right away and this morning.

02:20.893 --> 02:23.014
It's 1136 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

02:23.054 --> 02:23.755
Happy to be here.

02:24.955 --> 02:27.477
Keep working to get your kids off of social media.

02:27.517 --> 02:29.558
Keep working to get the word out.

02:30.199 --> 02:31.560
We will not call autism.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.261
I don't like the word autism.

02:34.141 --> 02:35.042
He was vaccine damaged.

02:36.003 --> 02:40.346
As Brian Hooker says, autism spectrum disorder is not really a good thing.

02:40.406 --> 02:41.446
It's not a good idea.

02:41.466 --> 02:45.129
It's a mythology used to make sure that intramuscular injections never questioned.

02:45.729 --> 02:52.535
has a methodology that virology is never questioned as a science and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

02:52.636 --> 02:56.299
The same thing can be said about pandemics and gain of function.

02:56.319 --> 02:58.621
These are all myths that we were tricked into believing.

02:58.641 --> 03:08.290
We solved mysteries about them and solving mysteries about these subjects has made it seem as though intramuscular injections shouldn't be questioned or any of those other things.

03:09.201 --> 03:11.382
The cheese is for free on social media.

03:11.442 --> 03:12.923
You need to understand why.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.805
I can't repeat that often enough.

03:16.585 --> 03:18.726
And you can't repeat that often enough to your kids.

03:19.887 --> 03:24.890
They've told us that AI has solved the puzzle of folding proteins.

03:24.950 --> 03:27.411
They've told us a lot of things, ladies and gentlemen, and they've

03:29.102 --> 03:39.936
effectively tricked us into ignoring a lot of things about ourselves, about the truth in the world, about our history, and about the history of the people who came up with these ideas and promoted them.

03:41.819 --> 03:46.585
Shout out to housatonicits.com, one of the best research archive websites and

03:49.673 --> 03:51.734
analysts on the internet, let's say it like that.

03:52.735 --> 03:58.358
That's about all I can really say for my friend Mark, doing a wonderful job from Boston.

03:58.398 --> 04:07.544
And this is a great sub stack I want to promote because one of the most egregious examples of the population pyramid managing with murder is in Scotland.

04:09.124 --> 04:13.047
The truth will set your kids free, ladies and gentlemen, the truth will set your kids free.

04:15.902 --> 04:17.444
My vocal cords are tired today.

04:17.544 --> 04:21.710
They do sound good in my ears, but I think my vocal cords are very tired.

04:21.791 --> 04:22.832
They're raw or something.

04:23.553 --> 04:25.135
So I'm going to take it a little easy today.

04:25.216 --> 04:30.563
Let the fire hose of monkey people do the talking for me.

04:31.684 --> 04:39.827
This is a broadcast coming to you live from the United States of America, so long as it still exists in its current form.

04:41.127 --> 04:45.769
More and more people are embracing the idea that it may need a new form.

04:47.149 --> 04:49.210
Maybe we're going to have a sort of Phoenix event.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.571
and Brett Weinstein will be right after all.

04:52.591 --> 05:05.676
Ladies and gentlemen, if you've been here for a while, you're here at the top of the wave, and if not, you might be a skilled TV watcher, a skilled social media watcher, user who thinks that the truth is being given away for free, and I assure you it is not.

05:05.716 --> 05:10.818
You need to stay focused on the biology, not take their bait on social media, and love your neighbor.

05:13.226 --> 05:15.827
The voice that you hear is that one of Jonathan Cooley.

05:15.847 --> 05:18.307
I'm chief biologist at gigaohmbiological.com.

05:18.347 --> 05:21.728
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

05:21.748 --> 05:27.029
You can find my academic record on PubMed under my last name with my first two initials.

05:27.049 --> 05:37.511
You can also find a lot of my work misrepresented on a substack called Woodhouse 76, which is written by a traitor and a fraud from Chicago by the name of Jessica Hockett.

05:39.123 --> 05:46.399
As far as I understand, her husband also owns a restaurant in Chicago, although I do not know the name of it and I would not suggest that you should...

05:47.389 --> 05:49.952
you should visit the establishment.

05:50.713 --> 05:52.234
I don't know if they make good food or not.

05:52.294 --> 05:59.842
But anyway, that's all I know about her other than whatever she lied to me with text messages and phone calls until she disappeared.

06:01.344 --> 06:08.451
She's just one of the many people that has, in one way or another, come into my life and tried to dominate it and then vanished.

06:09.292 --> 06:14.454
I've had people come to my house over the course of five years that altogether cannot be explained.

06:14.494 --> 06:18.756
I've been invited to barbecues over the last five years that altogether cannot be explained.

06:18.796 --> 06:24.118
I've been employed by people over the last five years that together cannot be explained.

06:25.089 --> 06:29.492
It doesn't really make any sense for all of these things to have happened to one guy.

06:29.512 --> 06:38.218
And yet nobody seems to think it's significant enough to do anything about it.

06:38.739 --> 06:42.441
It's weird because... I don't know.

06:44.002 --> 06:45.143
I got a YouTube channel.

06:45.163 --> 06:46.264
That's where this all started.

06:47.751 --> 06:51.217
And now I have another YouTube channel, because that's where this has gone.

06:51.237 --> 06:59.790
And it's remarkable, because everybody just seems to want to make admissions now on who's team they're on.

06:59.830 --> 07:02.534
And it is just one team, like I've always said.

07:03.482 --> 07:16.377
And so the only reason why I've been able to say it is because I've got a lot of generous people out there that support the stream with small and large donations, and the end result is that we can pay our rent here in Pittsburgh, and we can put food on the table, and that's about it.

07:17.158 --> 07:23.665
And so I'm eternally grateful for all those people who have already gone to GigaOMBiological.com and signed up for a way to support.

07:24.506 --> 07:33.836
And I still feel obliged to try and encourage anybody who's been thinking about it for a while to do so because this is a train that cannot stop, will not stop.

07:35.097 --> 07:41.743
But it's a lot more pleasant for me to run the train if I don't also have to work side jobs, which I'm doing right now.

07:42.784 --> 07:50.530
It's also a lot more pleasant if I can focus on expanding on the ideas that I have.

07:51.291 --> 08:06.782
I have a couple books in draft, I have a couple other things, but I'm not dumb enough to put this stuff on substacks so that their AI chatbots can dissect it and obfuscate it and then recycle it in a million other substacks that no one ever sees but them.

08:08.715 --> 08:11.537
Our own thoughts are being weaponized against us, ladies and gentlemen.

08:11.557 --> 08:23.683
That's what they can do because we've acquiesced to using social media as some kind of useful tool, and I can't tell you how important it is to understand that social media makes you into their useful tool.

08:27.044 --> 08:27.745
That's what happens.

08:31.347 --> 08:32.147
Let's see here.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.488
Let's pull this off.

08:33.628 --> 08:35.749
Let's switch this over.

08:35.769 --> 08:37.130
I need to cut there.

08:38.274 --> 08:39.455
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

08:39.495 --> 08:40.256
Welcome to the show.

08:40.316 --> 08:41.697
This is GigaOM Biological.

08:42.298 --> 08:45.400
A high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.622
The captain comes on the screen every day.

08:48.964 --> 08:51.886
It's the way I have my... I'm not even really in focus, I don't think.

08:53.107 --> 08:57.231
It's the way that I have my setup here that you can't really see my hands.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.554
And I don't really know which way to point because for that camera it's one way.

09:00.834 --> 09:01.775
You know, I'm not a weatherman.

09:03.379 --> 09:06.001
Although I do this for a living, I don't call myself a weatherman.

09:06.041 --> 09:09.763
I'm actually just a biology coach in the middle of something.

09:10.264 --> 09:20.891
And I'm looking to transition into biology teacher for high school kids and for college freshman age kind of people, but younger also.

09:22.112 --> 09:28.937
And I think that's not a, I don't think that's a dishonorable way of working because

09:30.086 --> 09:34.329
Perhaps the most dishonorable thing to do in life is to mislead the young.

09:35.410 --> 09:46.399
And I believe that there are people out there for the last six years now that have been paid specifically to mislead adults so that they would mislead their young.

09:48.141 --> 09:51.904
And indeed, mislead adults so that they would mislead the young.

09:53.146 --> 10:01.993
And these people that I've come into contact with, that I've put on my screen, I believe are some of the worst citizens of our respective countries.

10:03.194 --> 10:07.057
I think these are people that genuinely deserve to be in jail.

10:07.137 --> 10:20.707
If you believe that America is a free society, where we live by a rule of laws, and that it should not be legal for you to go on the internet and pretend to be somebody you are not,

10:21.806 --> 10:26.609
to engage in a sort of long con, which a lot of these people did.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.271
And that's the only way to describe it.

10:29.311 --> 10:32.473
They are paid to lie about why people died.

10:34.574 --> 10:45.421
And one of the ways that people can be lying indirectly about why people died is to be teaching the bad biology upon which these myths are based.

10:46.241 --> 10:50.243
And many of the people who are going to be teaching these myths are going to be doing it

10:52.281 --> 11:11.950
unwittingly, like I was at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, convinced that they were covering a lab leak up and convinced that there was some heroic group of anonymous people on Twitter called drastic, that was fighting desperately to get the word out that this was indeed a lab leak.

11:12.010 --> 11:14.291
And it could be much more dangerous than we thought.

11:14.371 --> 11:18.113
And oh my goodness, fear and cleavage site ACE2 receptor.

11:19.494 --> 11:19.674
Now,

11:20.726 --> 11:46.453
The point of this is to understand that very few people have managed to get to Camp 4, where they know that not only was one person lying to them, but a group of people were lying to them, and another group of people was waiting to lie to them, and another group of people was waiting to lie to them, and then another group hired them, but they were all lying to them, and

11:47.205 --> 11:52.609
It's very easy when you experience this over a long term to imagine that you might be crazy.

11:53.910 --> 12:07.121
Unless of course, even in the casual discussion of the last five years, you're even your, your sons and your soon to be eight year old daughter remembers things just like you do.

12:08.462 --> 12:14.026
And even remembers things that you don't remember anymore and reminds you that remember Papa when

12:16.107 --> 12:18.048
And then you realize that you're not crazy.

12:18.909 --> 12:39.200
Then you realize that getting this far as a biologist, where I feel like I can comfortably say endemicity is a myth, both as a process and an endpoint, that's a pretty spectacular progression as far as I'm concerned as a biologist, because in my

12:40.501 --> 12:49.746
lifetime as a biologist from being a naturalist as a kid and a bird watcher and a snake collector and a rabbit keeper and this kind of thing.

12:49.766 --> 12:53.989
I think the best word for that is a naturalist.

12:54.089 --> 13:05.895
I mean anybody that uses their binoculars just for birds is a birder, but anybody that uses their binoculars to look at everything and has binoculars specifically because you can look close things,

13:08.294 --> 13:14.356
I don't know, they're just people who are naturalists that aren't out there for one specific thing.

13:14.436 --> 13:16.377
If they find tracks, they can act on it.

13:16.397 --> 13:18.077
If they find a snake, they can act on it.

13:18.117 --> 13:25.180
If they find flowers or mushrooms, they can, it's all part of this thing.

13:25.720 --> 13:36.204
And that's the real, in my humble opinion, that would be the real biologist that you would want to ultimately become a doctor or become a veterinarian or become a scientist.

13:37.128 --> 14:00.995
You don't want any other kind of person to pursue the fine edge of knowledge, because without that humility, the humility of a child in nature, the humility of a child in the face of a collection of snakes under a plywood board that you didn't expect to be there,

14:03.683 --> 14:07.246
That kid is the only kid you want to be a biologist.

14:07.286 --> 14:10.630
You don't want somebody like Peter Hotez to be a biologist.

14:11.570 --> 14:14.874
You don't want somebody like Tony Fauci to be a biologist.

14:15.634 --> 14:19.298
These are not people who are fascinated with the natural world.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.581
These are people who are something else.

14:25.194 --> 14:38.281
And the reason why none of these people in the fake health freedom movement have ever gotten here, even if they've been at it for many, many, many years longer than myself.

14:39.422 --> 14:46.585
I mean, I would only humbly submit that I knew at all what I was talking about somewhere in year 2022.

14:48.466 --> 14:51.128
And I humbly submit that that's pretty pathetic.

14:52.568 --> 15:05.716
But the most important thing to understand is that I can now explain to you how it is that and why it is that what I thought in 2020 is what I thought.

15:07.817 --> 15:12.319
I have video evidence for it and slide decks and there are videos of other people.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.820
It's all there.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.463
The theater was hard here because this is where the murder was taking place.

15:20.851 --> 15:22.773
And these people were coming to my house.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.616
These people were offering me salaries.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.498
These people were calling me a hero.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.820
These people were calling me a genius.

15:32.081 --> 15:35.123
The work that they did on me was extraordinary.

15:36.785 --> 15:42.310
And I suspect that some aspects of my life are still being worked on now.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.612
I think I would be naive to think otherwise.

15:47.523 --> 15:53.308
And so we are at a very crucial time point, in my humble opinion, because it is a war of attrition at this point.

15:53.348 --> 16:07.940
As long as they can keep everything silent and crickets, and it's still 3,000 followers, and there's still only 100 people watching, and the PeerTube still only gets like 400 hits when it's a big day, will I really keep going?

16:10.253 --> 16:15.438
Will I really keep saying that these people are frauds because they make no progress?

16:15.478 --> 16:22.065
Will I really be able to sustain that or will I eventually capitulate and say anything else?

16:24.367 --> 16:26.490
And that's what I really have the feeling here.

16:26.550 --> 16:32.576
I think that they're counting on the fact that I'm gonna finally forget that Nathan died.

16:34.994 --> 16:39.458
I think they think I'm going to finally forget that my father-in-law was killed in the Netherlands.

16:39.498 --> 16:43.581
I think they're going to think I'm going to finally forget that my friend Annie died.

16:49.686 --> 16:53.509
I think they think that Mark is going to forget that his son died.

16:58.413 --> 17:04.716
And it's unfortunate, but I hate to tell it to these people, but if you're watching the video, I will never be able to stop.

17:04.996 --> 17:10.099
I mean, the best case scenario for you is that I start making this a Friday only show again.

17:13.260 --> 17:18.843
So you know what I'm about to say, you know what I have to say, and you know who I'm coming after about this.

17:18.903 --> 17:27.007
You know why it's so important to understand that there was a massive biological signal, you know, an opportunity that they took advantage of.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.190
You can see it as a necessity, like we've got to manage this problem.

17:32.250 --> 17:37.614
You can see it as a economic disaster waiting to happen, so we've got to manage this problem.

17:38.695 --> 17:44.400
Or you could see it as malevolently as possible and say that we have this problem.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.642
We've fixed the problem.

17:47.002 --> 17:51.045
You see, now the population pyramid returned back again, reset again.

17:51.085 --> 17:52.306
They need to reset it again.

17:53.263 --> 17:55.424
if they wanna go where they're going, and they will.

17:56.004 --> 17:59.926
It will reset itself because of this decreased birth rate here.

18:00.806 --> 18:01.586
You see that, right?

18:02.227 --> 18:08.029
This is gonna be a decreased birth rate right here because what's happening here, these people are gonna get older, right?

18:08.349 --> 18:11.610
They're growing up in a world where there's many, many genders.

18:11.651 --> 18:13.091
You don't have to have kids.

18:13.131 --> 18:17.513
That would be crazy, especially because of overpopulation and lack of resources.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.781
So the birth rate is definitely going to collapse here.

18:22.842 --> 18:24.882
The birth rate is gonna collapse.

18:24.922 --> 18:27.003
They're putting economic pressure on people.

18:27.043 --> 18:28.444
Nobody can buy a house anymore.

18:29.124 --> 18:31.785
I rent my house in Pittsburgh for 2540.

18:33.406 --> 18:35.107
2540 a month without utilities.

18:36.808 --> 18:44.471
And this is not, I mean, if you saw the house, anybody that came to the gigaohm gathering, you know that

18:46.510 --> 18:50.712
I mean, by Pittsburgh standards even, this is not, I mean, we're okay.

18:50.732 --> 18:56.774
You're not complaining, but that's a lot of money.

18:58.095 --> 19:03.517
When I was a kid, shoot, when we first moved to Pittsburgh, that would have been a massive mortgage payment.

19:06.138 --> 19:10.900
When we moved to Pittsburgh, we were paying 1500 a month, I believe, maybe even less.

19:13.857 --> 19:17.438
And so the United States is going south very quick.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.760
And the reality is, is that nobody is really doing anything about it.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.001
We're still arguing about whether Epstein, the second release is coming.

19:27.141 --> 19:34.504
We're still arguing about, you know, free speech and, and whether or not these dyes are really going to be out of Heinz ketchup in a year or not.

19:37.813 --> 19:42.254
This is a remarkable place that we are in because the performance is now running very thin.

19:42.294 --> 19:46.995
This fake anti-vax movement in America needs to come out and become mainstream.

19:47.675 --> 19:57.336
Understand the Democrats and the left, this would be a wonderfully powerful thing to point out to the right that this anti-vax movement is a fake thing.

19:58.377 --> 19:59.637
These people aren't serious.

20:05.018 --> 20:05.958
But they're not going to do that.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.172
because they're all part of this same show.

20:10.765 --> 20:14.686
I was going to say much more there, but I don't think it's really important at this point.

20:14.866 --> 20:25.348
It is much more entertaining to try and understand how ridiculous it is that being here with a timeline for everybody, right?

20:25.408 --> 20:29.088
That's the whole argument that I've been making that the homework is the timeline.

20:29.108 --> 20:34.729
You got to make these people check themselves at the door and explain their own timeline.

20:35.069 --> 20:36.930
You don't get to just say, yeah, in 2022, I put out a book.

20:41.138 --> 20:50.396
The CDC has a timeline which seems to suggest they set up the opioid crisis that is responsible for 500,000 Americans dying during COVID.

20:50.957 --> 20:51.358
I don't know.

20:51.639 --> 20:52.601
Sure seems like it.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.791
These clowns, you know, same thing.

20:56.811 --> 21:02.195
They gotta have a Scotsman because Scotland is one of the places where they really murdered a lot of people.

21:02.675 --> 21:11.141
So they gotta have a very prominent Scotsman out there to make sure that Scotsman is heard, but that Scotsman never says anything about it.

21:11.961 --> 21:13.382
It's just ultra traitors.

21:13.703 --> 21:14.863
I mean, ultra traitors.

21:16.264 --> 21:18.446
And I think they're all on these two guys' script.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.481
I think you can see it, but they're not talking about the CDC and that's why, because it was sculpted with murder and lies.

21:24.541 --> 21:27.562
The murder and lies were set up by the CDC.

21:28.062 --> 21:31.463
The actual opioid deaths were also set up by the lockdowns.

21:31.503 --> 21:36.985
You see, think about who suffers from the lockdowns besides old people who already live alone.

21:41.843 --> 21:45.807
And so we have this... Now, what we do have evidence for are these plasmids.

21:45.887 --> 21:50.591
We have this monster running around pretending to be an expert, and he's been doing that since 2020.

21:52.193 --> 21:54.254
That's how you can see that he must be a liar.

21:55.556 --> 22:06.666
He's an intellectual property expert, and he's probably still an agent for the DOD and for the DOE, the Department of Energy, where of course the Human Genome Project is, where nukes are.

22:09.161 --> 22:14.142
He knows already that all the things that he's saying are things that he could have said in 2020, should have said in 2020.

22:14.502 --> 22:25.645
And most importantly, he's not saying that they're just transfections, just like Brett Weinstein and his wife are not saying, just like Bobby Kennedy is not saying, just like Brian Hooker's not saying.

22:28.006 --> 22:31.087
And Brian Hooker for damn well sure knows that they're transfections.

22:31.127 --> 22:34.868
We did a podcast together while I was still working at CHD where I explained it to him.

22:36.718 --> 22:40.059
And it went in one traitorous ear and out the other, apparently.

22:40.119 --> 22:45.200
The guy who doesn't say the word autism in 2013 now says it whenever he's told.

22:47.101 --> 22:51.282
And fires people like me whenever he's told, even by Mary Holland.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.003
No principles.

22:54.083 --> 22:56.044
These people have no principles.

22:56.284 --> 23:01.765
After all these years and all this lack of progress and all this hope, they have no principles.

23:01.805 --> 23:04.066
And you can see it because they've made no progress.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.781
They've stuck to their scripts, they've sold their sky horse books.

23:12.382 --> 23:20.003
Academics use a methodology called transfection all day long and another methodology called transformation all day long.

23:22.124 --> 23:30.826
And that means there's no excuse for any of them to have let this happen except for the fact that these people successfully obfuscated the obvious.

23:33.342 --> 23:36.804
which I was fired for in 2020 for saying it.

23:41.067 --> 23:48.472
And now they want to make it about the DNA and the shots or the DNA sequencing or the AI kill zone or whatever it is.

23:48.532 --> 24:01.160
And it's all, it's all irrelevant relative to the base mythology that the PCR works to find something that we can find anything on a background like that.

24:02.500 --> 24:06.582
that the sequencing works, high fidelity on a background like that.

24:09.283 --> 24:17.786
We can have tests that can find 17 different viral markers for shit's sake, according to Mary Talley Bowden in 2021.

24:18.026 --> 24:24.629
Where do you think she is now using a whole battery of PCR tests that can screen for a hundred viruses in total?

24:29.733 --> 24:37.215
None of these stories about the contamination, SV40, DNA, whatever, none of these stories are valid.

24:38.495 --> 24:40.956
They're all scientifically ridiculous.

24:42.216 --> 24:54.999
And they ignore the fact that this, this one of the worst Americans alive was telling these stories already in 2020, working for them already in 2020.

24:57.591 --> 25:01.012
And so these truths remain unchallenged.

25:01.132 --> 25:02.853
They remain unchallenged.

25:02.893 --> 25:09.495
They remain un... I mean, and also unused by all of these people.

25:10.596 --> 25:16.078
Nobody has made any useful progress other than saying everything's fake, which is not useful progress.

25:17.679 --> 25:18.679
I can't stress enough.

25:19.923 --> 25:28.129
throwing everything away, burning everything down to the studs with no plan what to do when it rains, no plan what to do in the meantime is not a way.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.971
And it's not gonna be a way for our kids to go forward.

25:31.991 --> 25:39.196
It's not gonna be a way for our kids to successfully extricate themselves from the grip of social media.

25:39.236 --> 25:48.463
We need to offer them an alternative explanation, an alternative explanation that will adequately explain

25:49.969 --> 26:13.022
why Joe Rogan is where he is with who he is doing what he's doing that will explain who these people are and what they got away with and will explain what we're seeing now where the vice president talks about Ohio with the NIH director on one arm and the HHS director on the other arm

26:15.814 --> 26:22.743
where these people with other passports are at the head of our most prestigious, used to be institutions.

26:22.783 --> 26:25.887
We have a problem in America that nobody is acknowledging.

26:27.229 --> 26:30.673
That we don't have Americans in these places anymore.

26:32.315 --> 26:33.396
And this is ridiculous.

26:34.830 --> 26:40.374
It's ridiculous because they're also promoting and being promoted by other foreigners.

26:40.454 --> 26:45.437
It's just an absurdity beyond absurdity and it's happening all on social media.

26:45.477 --> 26:49.239
It's being allowed to occur and facilitated on social media.

26:50.060 --> 26:53.682
The only way to see it is that America can only be saved if we get off of it.

26:57.005 --> 27:01.527
Because this performance, this team can get away with what they're doing.

27:01.567 --> 27:02.768
They're all on the same script.

27:02.788 --> 27:03.989
It doesn't matter where you go.

27:04.069 --> 27:05.769
You will always be on their script.

27:06.410 --> 27:09.731
That's why we have a guy like this at the head of the FDA.

27:09.791 --> 27:11.092
This is not by accident.

27:11.132 --> 27:12.853
This is exactly on plan.

27:14.174 --> 27:22.598
Most likely, the reason why they added Robert Malone to the ACIP is so that he would have a valid excuse for being around this man all the time.

27:24.625 --> 27:32.507
So that he, whenever they come into the office and they find him sitting there telling this shithead what to do, they can say, oh yeah, well, I was having a meeting with Robert Malone.

27:32.527 --> 27:33.048
Do you know him?

27:33.108 --> 27:34.288
He's on the ACIP.

27:37.309 --> 27:38.089
Stop lying.

27:39.530 --> 27:40.330
That's where we're at.

27:41.310 --> 27:43.691
That's how infiltrated it has become.

27:43.731 --> 27:46.192
Now the question is, is who does Robert Malone work for?

27:46.232 --> 27:46.992
Because it ain't us.

27:51.638 --> 28:07.125
And so I showed you yesterday that it's very likely, 100% sure that Peggy Hall is just some kind of performer that's always been on some RFK team-provided script, which means Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan.

28:07.225 --> 28:20.852
And so, as I suspected long ago, her whimsical lines and funny anecdotes and goofy words, you know, jabbity-jabs or whatever, that was all done to be this safe,

28:22.990 --> 28:26.133
sort of opposition to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

28:26.193 --> 28:39.826
She was one of those people with lots of views on YouTube who was free, according to the algorithm, to say anything she wanted about the jibbity-jabs and to say that, see, Robert F. Kennedy is pro-vaccine.

28:40.266 --> 28:41.668
He is pro-vaccine.

28:42.873 --> 28:44.555
And so she was just on script.

28:44.595 --> 28:45.836
She's always been on script.

28:45.876 --> 28:52.361
And if you look at where she was before the pandemic, you don't see somebody who was, had another idea in mind.

28:52.501 --> 29:00.528
She had exactly this idea in mind to become an influencer, to become a very pretty and attractive influencer and known that way.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.190
That's, that's what you see, right?

29:03.311 --> 29:03.551
I mean,

29:05.191 --> 29:15.399
It's quite easy, at least for me, to look at her timeline and see the people that were in her church were Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:15.499 --> 29:17.841
and Judy Mikovits in 2020.

29:17.921 --> 29:32.092
I mean, that's already... Then the way that her rhetoric went throughout the pandemic is just all the time, just this goofy shit, not really saying stuff that mattered and certainly not making any progress.

29:33.683 --> 29:35.325
It's all a performance with these people.

29:35.445 --> 29:36.706
It's all very malevolent.

29:37.367 --> 29:41.471
And of course, this culminated the other day with her promoting Sam Bailey.

29:42.031 --> 29:51.200
And Sam Bailey is of course connected to all these super clowns, including this one, which again, just underscores that it's not by accident.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.581
It's all one show.

29:54.363 --> 29:58.167
And the only question is, is whether anybody's willing to accept it, to see it.

29:59.318 --> 30:08.181
It's just as simple as Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan coordinating some international, social media-based bullshit show.

30:10.622 --> 30:15.024
And the bullshit show does some very, very cardinal things all the time.

30:15.084 --> 30:20.386
It never questions the virus, it never questions the PCR test, and it never questions the sequencing.

30:22.932 --> 30:23.792
And that's the trick.

30:24.253 --> 30:27.934
That's why in 2020, he said worst case scenario.

30:28.054 --> 30:30.335
In 2024, he says it's still worst case scenario.

30:30.835 --> 30:40.059
He's been saying amyloid for a long time, but I think you might be maybe not surprised to understand that fibrinogen is a thing.

30:41.462 --> 30:45.624
Fibrinogen is a thing that actually happens, it's natural.

30:45.664 --> 30:53.127
To call it amyloidogenic fibrinogen or whatever these people are spooking you out about, it's all bullshit.

30:53.907 --> 31:04.272
Just because an antibody for amyloid binds to their clots doesn't make it necessarily a hot signal for amyloid activity or any of this other shit.

31:05.172 --> 31:08.814
And the same shit they pull with the prion thing.

31:09.699 --> 31:16.844
stain it with something, or use some kind of methodology that's supposed to be a proxy indicator for that, and there it is.

31:17.744 --> 31:20.466
And these are all just, this is not serious.

31:21.847 --> 31:29.712
This fat, short Englishman that's vaping all the time is not a serious person.

31:30.752 --> 31:37.537
And the idea that Steve Kirsch himself offered to send me to Tokyo to work with that jackass

31:38.385 --> 31:57.311
means that they're all one team my phone will show you that the fact that after my red pill conference that that steve kirsch talked to andy kaufman now look at these guys oh my gosh we're delighted to welcome back dr raseem al-hotra raseem thanks for coming back mate

31:58.021 --> 32:00.024
Always great to see you, John.

32:00.224 --> 32:01.085
So much to talk about.

32:01.105 --> 32:02.868
We've been looking forward to this for some time.

32:02.908 --> 32:05.812
We had communication difficulties now, but we think we're OK at the moment.

32:06.914 --> 32:13.563
Now, let's start off with Make America Healthy Again and your role and potential role in that.

32:14.591 --> 32:17.052
Yeah, John, so it's a very interesting story.

32:17.072 --> 32:33.560
I think just to give people a full background, how I ended up getting involved in that is... You will recall one of the most classic moments in Brett Weinstein's illustrious podcast history is when he had Asim Malhotra on in 2022.

32:33.840 --> 32:36.281
And if you haven't seen it, please just check it out.

32:37.242 --> 32:37.642
You know what?

32:37.782 --> 32:40.183
I'm just going to show it to you right now because it's that good.

32:42.043 --> 32:51.912
The way that he opens the show is just hilarious because he says that Asim Malhotra is a dissident, but he came to it a little late.

32:53.393 --> 32:55.094
Hold on, let me see if I can find it quick.

32:56.135 --> 33:00.759
Let's see, Brett Weinstein, Asim Malhotra.

33:11.058 --> 33:13.194
Two years ago, I think it's this one.

33:14.107 --> 33:15.068
first podcast.

33:15.708 --> 33:26.095
I have the distinct honor of sitting this morning with Dr. Asim Malhorta, who is a consulting cardiologist, president of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Public Health Collaboration.

33:26.195 --> 33:32.079
So many in my audience will be familiar with your story, but some will not.

33:32.760 --> 33:43.107
I know you as someone who has been a very forceful voice in the COVID dissident community, but a late emerging one.

33:44.213 --> 33:48.414
Do you want to explain how you ended up as a COVID dissident?

33:48.454 --> 33:50.675
A late emerging one.

33:50.835 --> 33:52.095
Bum, bum, bum.

33:52.215 --> 33:53.975
Okay, so anyway, that was what I wanted you to see.

33:53.995 --> 33:54.455
That's funny.

33:55.496 --> 34:02.297
The first part, so my relationship, it really starts, essentially, it's all based upon my friendship and relationship with Robert Kennedy Jr.

34:03.177 --> 34:09.399
As you remember, at the end of 2022, I published this paper in the Journal of Metabolic Health, then Journal of Insulin Resistance.

34:09.980 --> 34:15.062
calling from essentially a moratorium on the COVID mRNA vaccine and explaining my journey in that process.

34:15.442 --> 34:17.383
And we'll come back to that as well because I think that's important.

34:18.763 --> 34:28.246
Basically, he killed his dad and then he's sad about it now, you know, like me, except he won't admit that that's really a sad thing because he wasn't able to figure it out.

34:28.766 --> 34:35.989
He didn't have the requisite understanding in biology to know that it was a transfection in 2020 and call it out like I did.

34:39.212 --> 34:47.214
There were other people who were saying that the PCR test was a DNA sampling, obvious DNA sampling opportunity.

34:48.154 --> 34:53.115
One of the people that said that is my friend Thomas Binder in Switzerland.

34:53.155 --> 34:54.095
He said that in 2020.

34:56.356 --> 35:03.697
It didn't really become obvious to me until early 2021 that this was a testing opportunity, that they had created a remnant stream.

35:06.378 --> 35:07.538
And I'm not even really sure

35:08.263 --> 35:12.564
that very many people actually understand that that remnant stream still exists.

35:12.964 --> 35:14.965
And it doesn't have to be COVID tests anymore.

35:15.165 --> 35:26.387
It is the fact that PCR has become a default diagnostic standard, which it should never have been, and certainly hasn't passed that hurdle as a technology.

35:27.107 --> 35:33.349
And even if it had, it would still require constant regulation to assure that any future

35:34.485 --> 35:46.766
future manifestation of that methodology was adhering to the positive and negative controls necessary to be a diagnostic standard.

35:48.280 --> 36:15.438
And so again, here we have this poser jackass and poser jackass who are exquisitely unable to see the illusion of the PCR, the illusion of the sequencing, the illusion that was contained in the population pyramid, and how a convenient narrative about a novel virus where we don't really know how to treat the disease would be very convenient hide behind which this murder could take place.

36:15.979 --> 36:18.020
And this guy is awful.

36:19.581 --> 36:22.803
Because he is paid to lie about why people died.

36:23.303 --> 36:28.326
This guy is awful because he is lying about why people died.

36:29.046 --> 36:31.067
Not only that, but he's profiting from it.

36:31.467 --> 36:36.830
He is profiting from having pushed people to take AstraZeneca.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.812
I mean, that guy is an extreme case of...

36:44.417 --> 36:46.778
This guy is just kind of a small potatoes, dude.

36:47.018 --> 36:59.800
And it's sad, really, that the Maha movement, which is now, I guess, being run by Del Bigtree, has a scientific advisor with such a stooged, staged dipshit setup here.

36:59.860 --> 37:05.602
Like, this is so fraudulent, the whole thing is just staged fraudulent.

37:05.702 --> 37:06.802
Like, wow.

37:09.251 --> 37:13.613
When I published that paper... This guy is as fake as Doc Malek.

37:13.734 --> 37:16.015
Like, they are as fake as one another.

37:16.135 --> 37:17.176
It's quite remarkable.

37:17.536 --> 37:26.222
...paper and there was, you know, I was quite disappointed in the sense that I'd worked it up for an exclusive with a journalist in a very prominent British newspaper.

37:26.822 --> 37:31.866
I know from my previous campaigning experience, you know, taking on Big Pharma, exposing statins,

37:32.906 --> 37:40.191
changing the narrative on cholesterol and heart disease, changing guidelines on low carb diets, on sugar, everything that I've been involved in over a long time.

37:40.792 --> 37:48.517
If you get an issue major media attention, it is a massive dent in changing the narrative in a positive way.

37:49.257 --> 37:56.062
And for me, I knew that if this was, you know, a story, it should have been a front page of that particular newspaper saying COVID-19 vaccine needs to stop.

37:56.602 --> 37:58.183
It would have been game over then, right?

37:58.243 --> 38:00.124
And of course, for me, isn't just about that.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.946
Now, don't forget that I published a

38:02.686 --> 38:24.597
COVID vaccines need to be paused in May of 2021 under the control and infiltration of one Piper Stover, who was likely sharing all the drafts of that review during the whole five-month process before I finally said, you know what, I'm just gonna fucking publish it because I'm tired of this shit.

38:24.757 --> 38:25.898
We're drafting it too much.

38:25.938 --> 38:27.039
We're changing it too much.

38:27.819 --> 38:31.281
It really took that long for me to finally put my foot down.

38:32.597 --> 38:39.829
And I think that after Mark's careful work on Piper Stover, I think it's pretty obvious that she's not who she said she was.

38:40.931 --> 38:42.994
It's pretty obvious that I was being played.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.178
It's pretty obvious that I was a dumbass back then.

38:46.042 --> 39:00.633
And she handed me off to Brett Weinstein, who then continued to play me until I was handed off to Matt Crawford, who continued to play me, until I was handed off to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who continued to play me, or his staff continued to play me, I should say.

39:01.173 --> 39:05.016
And then I was handed off to Mary Holland and Brian Hooker, who continued to play me.

39:05.616 --> 39:10.960
And I was also handed off to Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson during that time.

39:11.020 --> 39:11.280
So it's...

39:13.762 --> 39:27.673
I'm just bewildered at how many people have been paid to lie about why people died and have specifically been paid to somehow or another interfere with my ability to provide for my family.

39:29.414 --> 39:32.497
There's a lot of people that I would be very justified knocking out.

39:34.198 --> 39:42.925
And it's not a joke, like in any real human society it would be totally justified and the audience would stand up and cheer

39:44.807 --> 39:48.849
for these people to be knocked out, especially by somebody like me.

39:48.909 --> 40:02.517
If they came to your house, you know, if they texted your wife, tried to get you to tutor their daughter or, or coach them, their husband out of divorcing them, holy shit, you might be pretty pissed if you found out that was a lie.

40:08.956 --> 40:13.039
This guy ran away from me at the CHD conference in Georgia, it was hilarious.

40:13.099 --> 40:19.923
Twice he saw me, twice I tried to raise my eyebrows and say hello to him and he just, I mean, sped past.

40:20.784 --> 40:25.827
And the final time I saw him and I just stopped him, I'm like, hey Asim, don't you think we should take a selfie together?

40:25.847 --> 40:29.049
And he said, sure, what the heck?

40:31.971 --> 40:33.372
He knew exactly who I was.

40:36.394 --> 40:37.695
You know he knew who I was.

40:37.775 --> 40:51.783
He was on stage with Robert Malone, Meryl Ness, Sasha Latupova, and Michael Palmer in January of 2022 in Stockholm, Sweden, telling everybody that this was fifth generation warfare and we would never figure it out.

40:51.963 --> 40:58.967
This guy was on stage with Robert Malone, one of the biggest American traders alive.

41:02.308 --> 41:04.790
And now an ACIP member under,

41:06.268 --> 41:10.192
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Malone, probably one of his chief handlers.

41:12.695 --> 41:26.167
We are in a very dangerous position in America, and there are puppets all around the world that are all participating in this controlled demolition of what essentially is England and America.

41:26.267 --> 41:29.791
Like it or not, England is being destroyed from within as well.

41:31.124 --> 41:40.129
by immigration, and your NHS is being destroyed, and your old folks are being euthanized, and that's normal in your situation.

41:40.609 --> 41:46.852
So what's happening in the UK is a controlled demolition of the UK as well.

41:48.413 --> 41:53.996
And I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that whoever's doing it in America is the same people who are doing it there.

41:54.076 --> 42:00.619
I don't know where else they have a good handle, but the UK and the United States are being destroyed.

42:01.889 --> 42:20.276
The primary English-speaking people that, you know, that are willing to fight over soccer games are allowing their, and football games and hockey, you know, hockey, we fight over hockey, but, but, you know, when it comes to the destruction of our, our nations, you know, we just watch it on news.

42:20.336 --> 42:21.336
We just watch it happen.

42:23.479 --> 42:25.701
Canada may be also being destroyed indeed.

42:26.021 --> 42:30.725
A personal motivation, you know, to doing something successfully.

42:30.765 --> 42:33.047
It's about the bigger picture and saving lives.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.589
And it didn't happen, right?

42:35.669 --> 42:38.592
I mean, at the end of the day, you're a doctor, you're a cardiologist.

42:39.052 --> 42:44.517
And, you know, the reason that we're so keen to have you on is I completely believe that that is your motivation.

42:45.177 --> 42:46.498
We have the same motivation.

42:46.538 --> 42:48.660
We want to relieve human pain, suffering and death.

42:49.260 --> 42:49.621
100% John.

42:49.641 --> 42:59.629
That's why most of us, 99.99% of doctors, nurses, people going to health, you know, sector, do it from that position of relieving human suffering.

42:59.649 --> 43:01.250
That's what, that's what we are called to do.

43:01.290 --> 43:02.712
That's part, it's innate within us.

43:02.752 --> 43:04.693
We're not motivated by finances.

43:04.753 --> 43:06.515
If we were, we'd be doing other jobs.

43:06.595 --> 43:13.580
You know, doctors are usually the people that, you know, let's be honest, you know, do the best at school and medical school, that kind of stuff while at school.

43:14.541 --> 43:40.825
Therefore they could choose going to banking if they want and make millions Because because one there's an interest in the topic, but ultimately it's about you know, it's a very noble profession So that was what I see so I was I don't even didn't even mean to do that I guess somebody put that in my head, but you know These people don't go into to being doctors for the right reasons They don't go into it with the humility that they should go into it

43:41.991 --> 43:47.597
They go into it with the idea that it's a noble profession, that it's respected.

43:49.198 --> 43:51.380
They want to be respected in the community.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.804
So they are going to choose between being a doctor or a lawyer.

43:54.844 --> 43:56.365
You see why it sucks?

43:58.267 --> 44:00.710
Why doctors suck in general?

44:00.770 --> 44:04.714
Because it's not the right people who are encouraged to or choose to do it.

44:07.145 --> 44:20.075
That's the first failure there is that we don't nurture this humility and this love for nature in our children enough to get doctors in general that are the right kind of doctor.

44:22.536 --> 44:27.300
The doctor on Little House on the Prairie is a better doctor than any of the doctors in Pittsburgh, probably.

44:29.264 --> 44:34.608
was clearly motivated by and very disappointed when it didn't make the news and the mainstream.

44:34.628 --> 44:36.890
I had to think outside the box as an activist.

44:36.950 --> 44:41.233
So I managed to get it, I think, in a Spanish newspaper, in the Times of India.

44:41.253 --> 44:42.834
So, okay, well, let's just try this.

44:42.894 --> 44:43.935
We're in a global world.

44:44.135 --> 44:45.156
Anything we can do to get it.

44:45.376 --> 44:48.498
Interesting that he got his article in the Times of India, huh?

44:49.138 --> 44:50.960
That's pretty good for him, right on.

44:51.180 --> 44:55.003
Out there in some platform, it has a knock-on effect, it has a ripple effect.

44:55.683 --> 44:58.125
And at the time, because I had a good relationship with them,

44:59.740 --> 45:02.782
I went on GB news and it was Dan Wootten show at that point, right?

45:03.042 --> 45:04.303
Who wants to do it as a main story?

45:04.323 --> 45:14.932
Yeah, and obviously there's a lot of tension Yeah, and I come out in the studio of GB news and the first person to call me and he got my number I understand from Robert Malone Was RFK jr.

45:14.972 --> 45:15.713
Robert Kennedy jr.

45:15.753 --> 45:18.235
I had no interaction with holy shit

45:20.182 --> 45:25.009
He's telling the same story that apparently I must, I must be full of it then.

45:25.089 --> 45:25.310
Right?

45:25.350 --> 45:28.294
Because my story is, is that in April of 2022,

45:30.834 --> 45:31.954
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:32.014 --> 45:41.277
called me in my front lawn in Pittsburgh and told me that Robert Malone sat him down and made me watch my stream with Charles Rixey, and he wanted to help me.

45:41.657 --> 45:47.339
And the same phone call I got from Ron Johnson on the same day said the same thing.

45:47.379 --> 45:51.220
And now he's telling that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:51.260 --> 45:53.880
got his number from Robert frickin' Malone.

45:54.340 --> 45:59.862
That means that Robert Malone knew him before Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

45:59.902 --> 46:00.062
did.

46:06.161 --> 46:12.844
Oh, I'm so frickin' sorry, but that's a giant admission that you were recruited by Robert Malone in the first place.

46:15.245 --> 46:29.251
And it's a giant admission that I'm right, that Robert Malone is actually driving probably Meryl Nass and therefore was for a long time indirectly driving Children's Health Defense and Mary Holland and their science whatever.

46:30.262 --> 46:36.386
as an advisor until Robert Malone just decided, oh, I think we better just bring Robert Malone on the field.

46:36.966 --> 46:46.692
And so we'll have him publish a book with Skyhorse and, you know, we'll have him be a reader for the Wuhan coverup book until, well, Jonathan Cui says he's a traitor.

46:46.732 --> 46:49.213
Well, then we can take him off the reader list, but that doesn't matter.

46:49.234 --> 46:51.295
We're going to fire Jonathan in a little while anyway.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.397
So yeah, this is bad.

46:54.937 --> 47:01.362
With him before that, I think he'd been following me maybe on social media, but I had no direct interaction with him.

47:01.503 --> 47:07.547
He started by saying, this all goes back to my friendship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:07.567 --> 47:11.030
It sounds like so far his friendship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:11.090 --> 47:12.651
is about as deep as mine.

47:13.712 --> 47:16.434
Because Robert Malone is the one who set us up too.

47:17.115 --> 47:17.655
It's crazy.

47:17.695 --> 47:19.016
We have a friend in common.

47:19.056 --> 47:19.717
Isn't that nice?

47:20.959 --> 47:23.061
And he gave me the most encouraging words.

47:23.081 --> 47:24.442
I remember the very first words he said to me.

47:24.462 --> 47:26.963
He says, Dr. Malhotra, Robert Kennedy, Jr.

47:26.983 --> 47:27.204
here.

47:28.084 --> 47:29.285
I want to thank you for your courage.

47:30.046 --> 47:30.226
Right?

47:30.246 --> 47:33.788
It must have knocked your socks off, getting that call straight from him.

47:33.808 --> 47:34.109
It was.

47:34.349 --> 47:35.049
Funny, huh?

47:35.089 --> 47:38.912
That's the same story that I tell at the Red Pill Conference.

47:38.972 --> 47:39.813
I mean, it's the same.

47:40.113 --> 47:40.954
It's my story.

47:43.075 --> 47:45.437
It's pretty remarkable, I think, actually.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.159
I mean, it could just be a coinkydink.

47:49.346 --> 47:50.967
You know, it gave me a lift actually, John.

47:51.227 --> 47:59.013
It gave me a lift because I was in a position where I was like, oh, you know, I'm doing something where I was told by my friends, by colleagues about what I was about to do.

47:59.053 --> 48:00.274
They said, Asim, you're going to get struck off.

48:00.574 --> 48:00.914
Don't do it.

48:00.934 --> 48:02.035
You're going to get struck off.

48:02.536 --> 48:05.398
The personal risk here is... What does struck off mean?

48:05.438 --> 48:06.899
Does that mean you're going to get killed?

48:06.959 --> 48:09.040
Or does that mean you're just going to lose your license?

48:09.060 --> 48:10.021
This is so dumb.

48:10.702 --> 48:11.902
This is so pathetic.

48:12.723 --> 48:13.824
It's such an act.

48:15.424 --> 48:18.225
These people are just acting for the national security state.

48:18.305 --> 48:21.506
They are part of the same illusion that is destroying America.

48:21.606 --> 48:24.126
It's the same illusion that will destroy the UK.

48:25.687 --> 48:28.248
It's the same illusion that's going to destroy Scotland.

48:28.368 --> 48:30.428
It's all of the Anglosphere.

48:30.568 --> 48:35.210
Everywhere where English is spoken, people are going to be destroyed by these people.

48:36.830 --> 48:40.631
And these are some of the worst actors in the UK group.

48:44.403 --> 48:51.267
coincidental overlap with the Indian story, with the Indian times and his Indian family.

48:51.327 --> 48:52.948
I'm sure it's all a coincidence.

48:53.208 --> 48:53.588
I'm sure.

48:55.006 --> 49:21.883
real element yeah i knew it was the biggest risk i was taking although having said that to be honest in retrospect in a different way uh doing what i did with the code vaccines in some respects some respects is a walk in the park in comparison to the decade of of uh relentless persecution i've had over statins right oh so now he's gonna claim that for a decade he's been telling everybody not to use statins stop lying wow that is uh

49:23.260 --> 49:32.723
That is some shit, because what he's kind of glossing over there is that in between there was this time when you told everybody to take the fricking vaccines.

49:37.225 --> 49:39.406
Like on TV, on BBC.

49:44.488 --> 49:50.910
This is a guy who should feel so bad that he shouldn't be comfortable

49:51.812 --> 49:53.193
doing what he's doing now.

49:53.333 --> 49:55.254
That's what I think.

49:55.975 --> 50:08.002
And you shouldn't see a good man who can do what he's doing now, given the fact that his father behind him is dead because he advocated for this technology.

50:09.042 --> 50:14.666
To say that, oh, I guess I was wrong now, he's still got to work that out with his family.

50:16.536 --> 50:24.929
Never mind with the perhaps thousands of people who might have taken it because of the same advice that he gave his dad on TV.

50:26.652 --> 50:29.857
This is like scum of the earth level shit here.

50:31.124 --> 50:40.727
We always knew that this guy was scum of the earth level dumb, but this dude is really, he's setting new records and like, you know, he's helping him.

50:41.287 --> 50:42.728
He's standing on his shoulders.

50:42.788 --> 50:46.169
So, you know, it's, it's real high jump record for these jackasses.

50:46.589 --> 50:54.592
It's still, you know, being a big issue, but anyway, so, but I was in a position to know what might come my way, but I thought medical, you know, medical, et cetera.

50:54.612 --> 50:55.232
So he'd read it.

50:55.672 --> 50:57.413
He then basically got me on his podcast.

50:57.433 --> 50:58.313
So we did a big interview.

50:59.753 --> 51:01.074
I then end up meeting him.

51:01.314 --> 51:02.354
He did a big interview.

51:02.394 --> 51:21.759
You remember my interview with the Defender where I was supposed to have an hour but then a day or two before the podcast I was called by his nephew and his nephew said you're gonna have seven minutes and we're gonna bring on Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose and Tess Laurie and they're all gonna talk about your claims.

51:28.413 --> 51:36.339
in America, I go to, you know, a bit of a speaking tour, which was, you know, instigated by Steve Kush, right?

51:36.359 --> 51:41.883
So I go, I go to America, I do Tucker Carlson, I meet Bobby Kennedy, Jr.

51:42.043 --> 51:50.489
in Malibu in an event, which is organized by a guy called Tony O'Donnell, who is who's a who, you know, Mel Gibson was that it was really extraordinary to people.

51:52.010 --> 51:52.810
Mel Gibson.

51:55.252 --> 51:56.493
So you see how it works, right?

51:56.513 --> 51:57.994
They tried to do the same thing with me.

52:00.259 --> 52:02.440
several times if I look back on it now.

52:03.901 --> 52:06.843
Sometimes when I look back on it, I actually get a little scared.

52:08.224 --> 52:13.647
Because I don't know anyone else who has experienced what I've experienced.

52:15.288 --> 52:29.857
Who's been in all the Zoom meetings that I've been in, all the streams that I've been in, all of the discussions that I've been in, all the steering committees that I've been on, all the staff meetings I've been in, and all the times that I've been fired.

52:31.093 --> 52:34.675
or been completely ignored after being courted.

52:34.795 --> 52:39.917
I mean, Piper Stover used to text me in the morning every day.

52:40.938 --> 52:45.480
Then after my stream, then tell me what I did on my stream.

52:46.480 --> 52:49.762
Then look at a draft of the review.

52:50.783 --> 52:52.924
Then say, wow, you were awesome.

52:53.124 --> 52:53.884
You know, whatever.

52:54.905 --> 52:55.685
Then they vanished.

52:57.383 --> 53:01.408
Then somebody else came into my, it happened over and over and over again.

53:01.448 --> 53:12.380
And all of these people at one point in time told me that I was great, told me that they were a big fan, told me that they watched what I do, have read what I've written.

53:15.224 --> 53:16.105
I can't make it up.

53:18.208 --> 53:24.792
I'm one of the only people on earth who knows how the UK and America are being subverted.

53:25.593 --> 53:31.717
How Canada and Australia and New Zealand are all being subverted by the same assholes.

53:33.498 --> 53:37.440
And there are traitors in every one of our country that participated in it.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.543
New Zealand, Australia, America, Canada, the UK.

53:41.583 --> 53:47.367
There are traitors in every country that participated in the Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan show.

53:48.032 --> 53:55.956
There are also traders in South Africa that participated in this Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan scripted traitorous show.

53:57.897 --> 54:08.802
And collectively they work together to reinforce each other's narratives in their own home country and in other countries in order to make sure that no useful dissident ever rises on social media.

54:09.462 --> 54:15.125
And with the help of the programming of these platforms, it is a flawless accomplishment.

54:18.137 --> 54:24.460
He's so confident he will flaunt his gold plaque from YouTube, his platinum plaque from YouTube.

54:26.360 --> 54:28.041
And this guy's just hoping he gets one.

54:28.061 --> 54:32.763
Well, they came to hear me speak and Bobby, et cetera.

54:32.783 --> 54:34.644
Joe Rogan, of course.

54:34.664 --> 54:36.544
Joe Rogan was much later on, yeah.

54:36.584 --> 54:37.945
He got on Rogan, too.

54:37.985 --> 54:39.806
You see, this is not by accident.

54:39.866 --> 54:41.666
We are in a trap.

54:44.926 --> 54:46.967
Yeah, it was much later on.

54:47.307 --> 54:49.527
And that's where we started connecting.

54:50.007 --> 54:54.689
Much later on, we're talking about 2022 onward.

54:55.169 --> 55:01.310
We're not talking at all about what happened in 2020 with AstraZeneca and the healthcare community of the UK.

55:01.730 --> 55:07.492
We're not talking anywhere about the use of lateral flow tests in the UK to define a bullshit pandemic.

55:07.952 --> 55:10.573
We are not talking about anything in 2020 at all.

55:12.796 --> 55:16.999
when the murder started in Scotland and in the UK and didn't end until 2020.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.002
They're not talking about anything relevant.

55:20.862 --> 55:25.466
We're talking about time after all the people that were going to take the shot took it.

55:27.707 --> 55:29.329
After everybody was already effed.

55:32.211 --> 55:32.831
Oh, that was a lot.

55:32.851 --> 55:33.952
It was a long time afterward.

55:33.972 --> 55:35.073
There's, there's not a lot.

55:35.133 --> 55:39.977
You're, you're skipping the most important part, the two and a half years where people were murdered.

55:41.445 --> 55:43.486
And they're doing it because that's the script.

55:45.307 --> 55:54.293
In fact, when I spoke, I referenced both JFK, his uncle, and Robert Kennedy, his father, in terms of fighting injustice, quotes to those effects.

55:54.313 --> 55:57.615
And I remember walking off the stage, and he basically gave me this big hug.

55:58.275 --> 56:00.897
And I went away the next day.

56:00.957 --> 56:02.498
His team were dropping me to the airport.

56:03.238 --> 56:05.459
And I said to him, I said, this guy needs to run for president.

56:05.499 --> 56:06.760
And he looked at me as if I was mad.

56:06.940 --> 56:10.982
I said, no, he needs to run for president because I said, this is the right time.

56:11.082 --> 56:11.902
We've got the right person.

56:11.922 --> 56:12.963
He's got the right skills and knowledge.

56:12.983 --> 56:16.585
I met him and he literally, you know, he, he's someone that does turn heads when you walk in.

56:16.605 --> 56:18.346
He has got a presence when he walks into a room.

56:18.386 --> 56:19.326
He's got the X factor.

56:19.546 --> 56:19.886
He really is.

56:20.187 --> 56:22.408
And he's extremely intelligent, knowledgeable.

56:22.848 --> 56:25.309
And he's got the, you know, he's got the, he's got the genes.

56:25.329 --> 56:26.770
He's got the integrity.

56:27.370 --> 56:31.737
of certainly what most people know about his, you know, his uncle and his father.

56:31.917 --> 56:32.478
And the pure energy.

56:34.577 --> 56:35.177
Oh, absolutely.

56:35.837 --> 56:37.638
This is the right person at the right time.

56:38.458 --> 56:40.219
And then we had some email exchanges.

56:40.279 --> 56:41.199
I sent him an email.

56:41.219 --> 56:46.961
There's a great documentary, if people haven't seen it, I urge you to watch it on Netflix, called Robert Kennedy for President, about his father.

56:47.201 --> 56:48.481
It's very powerful, very moving.

56:48.501 --> 56:51.062
I've seen it three or four times, several episodes.

56:51.562 --> 56:53.863
I actually emailed him and said, have you seen this, by the way?

56:53.883 --> 56:54.923
I hope you don't mind me.

56:55.163 --> 56:56.344
And he just acknowledged it.

56:56.384 --> 56:58.244
He didn't say whether he'd seen it or not, but he acknowledged it.

56:58.264 --> 56:59.745
So we were constantly in interaction.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.766
And then, of course, he announces he's going to run for president.

57:02.826 --> 57:03.747
He acknowledged it.

57:03.807 --> 57:06.491
So, of course, we were in constant interaction.

57:06.531 --> 57:12.478
I wonder if he can count the number of times he communicated with Robert F. Kennedy on one hand, because I bet he can.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.446
I was on a Zoom meeting with him in the middle of the night once to write an article about

57:20.729 --> 57:38.058
about Charles Rixey and Andrew Washburn, no, Alex Washburn, and their discovery of the no-seum technique indicators, the restriction enzyme sites.

57:38.598 --> 57:41.420
And that article on The Defender was written in the middle of the night.

57:42.327 --> 57:46.432
And it's really funny because the only thing that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

57:46.472 --> 57:56.082
did in that whole writing experience was come on the Zoom meeting in front of a couple other staff members to tell me that I was a terrible writer.

57:59.205 --> 57:59.906
It was pretty funny.

58:01.288 --> 58:03.630
And so, yeah, it's in retrospect,

58:06.929 --> 58:08.390
I don't think Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

58:08.430 --> 58:08.990
is a genius.

58:09.110 --> 58:11.031
I don't think he's really knowledgeable.

58:12.272 --> 58:20.757
He may be really knowledgeable, but it's a different thing than like being clever and smart, which I don't think he can be.

58:22.658 --> 58:25.159
I just simply like Elon Musk.

58:25.940 --> 58:28.561
I've just never heard anything profound come out of his mouth.

58:29.582 --> 58:32.524
I know that he has read profound words.

58:33.564 --> 58:34.685
I know that he,

58:35.928 --> 58:47.884
is purported to write profound words sometimes, but I don't think that necessarily means that he can put together words and combinations which create new ideas.

58:49.093 --> 58:51.876
And that's really what intelligence is all about to me.

58:52.036 --> 58:58.403
It is about using language to make people think in ways that they have not thought before.

58:58.603 --> 59:03.107
And quite frankly, I don't see anything about what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

59:03.127 --> 59:10.875
has done in the recent past or more distant that suggests to me that he himself

59:11.736 --> 59:15.918
was articulating the words that were changing the world around him.

59:15.938 --> 59:17.378
That's just not who he is.

59:18.439 --> 59:19.939
These people are all scripted.

59:21.220 --> 59:31.144
And because they are improvising through the script, and this is a key thing to understand, because they're improvising through the script, they attribute some of the

59:35.560 --> 59:41.444
They attribute a too significant portion to their own role in the script.

59:42.705 --> 59:50.270
They overestimate their value as actors on stage, in other words, because they think that they're reading this script in a way that nobody else can read it.

59:51.851 --> 59:54.092
And that's why they're so valuable to these people.

59:54.152 --> 59:56.133
And that's all played in here, right?

59:56.173 --> 59:58.415
That's why Mel Gibson needs to be at the party.

59:59.761 --> 01:00:06.643
Maybe that's why they had Rodney Mullen come to my house in 2020, or maybe not, I don't know.

01:00:08.263 --> 01:00:24.428
The point is, is that it's to put you in a disarmed state, so that, you know, you meet Mel Gibson, you're starstruck, and then Robert Malone shows up and says, see, this is the real deal, man, this is the shit, and I'm gonna show you how to make this your life.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:27.189
That's how it works.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:33.699
He can be an unwitting participant and just an idiot.

01:00:33.779 --> 01:00:34.579
That's possible.

01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:36.700
This guy can be an unwitting participant.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.800
He's not that clever.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:44.622
If you've watched any significant portion of his work, he's not that clever.

01:00:46.023 --> 01:00:55.686
And it's pretty easy to see that he would be very willing and able to be a scripter, scripted, rather than to be some kind of free-thinking guy.

01:00:55.706 --> 01:00:57.107
He's not a free-thinking guy.

01:00:59.096 --> 01:01:02.902
I don't know, I can't explain what he is, but he's not real.

01:01:03.382 --> 01:01:15.259
And this dude is so busy in his own mind with trying to make sure that the person that he's talking to right now in this moment, whoever it is, believes him.

01:01:16.664 --> 01:01:29.393
and attributes good things to him, principles to him, that he spends most of the first minutes or hours of any talk doing that, justifying that he's really the guy he says he is.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:31.867
That's what I see here.

01:01:31.887 --> 01:01:33.188
I don't see someone with a message.

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:37.609
I go to America, and we're making First Nuno Farm, which you obviously have seen.

01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:53.193
And at this point, part of that story was we wanted to... I literally was backing him to the hilt, and I helped organize an event with a brilliant man in Australia you might know called Adrian McRae, who's now become a politician over there, but a very wealthy guy, who essentially funded an event in San Jose.

01:01:53.434 --> 01:01:57.995
So he's hanging around with a bunch of rich people who are trying to influence elections all over the world.

01:01:58.874 --> 01:02:07.639
And they're using a fake health freedom movement to associate themselves with these ideals of health freedom and win elections.

01:02:07.799 --> 01:02:18.625
Just like, oh yeah, just like Polly Tommy did with 90 billboards in her bra, swaying 6 million votes for prime minister in the early 2000s.

01:02:19.905 --> 01:02:24.868
So it's become a global grift now where social media provides the medium

01:02:26.846 --> 01:02:34.831
and gives people like him power in many different political arenas, even in different languaged political arenas.

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:41.236
And that allows social media to become powerful across borders.

01:02:42.957 --> 01:02:55.025
Essentially by building a network of international actors, social media has been elevated to international significance.

01:02:56.482 --> 01:02:58.043
And that is really by design.

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:21.458
That may be one of the things that they have primarily accomplished here is demonstrated the power that social media can have on a global scale and, and maybe reorganize the way that our ruling elite think about governing us because they realize that they now have a kind of control mechanism that they didn't have before.

01:03:22.827 --> 01:03:34.742
You know, scandals in America are scandals in America, but now if it can become a global scandal all the time, a global crisis, a global narrative, then global governments can be more easily manipulated.

01:03:36.504 --> 01:03:37.866
With just a few insiders.

01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:41.838
And I don't think that's by accident.

01:03:41.878 --> 01:03:45.322
I think that's why these people are so internationally promoted.

01:03:45.382 --> 01:03:58.136
Because the idea is not to promote their ideas or these people internationally, but it is to force the relevance of social media to become international.

01:04:00.623 --> 01:04:02.224
for his presidential campaign.

01:04:02.425 --> 01:04:04.706
And it was Dr. Drew Pinsky was the moderator.

01:04:05.127 --> 01:04:07.409
We had John Shipton, who was Julian Assange's father.

01:04:07.929 --> 01:04:12.973
We had Vandana Shiva, who was a great food agriculture activist, amazing woman.

01:04:13.273 --> 01:04:16.156
And myself and Bobby, all of us were the speakers.

01:04:16.176 --> 01:04:16.716
It was a big event.

01:04:16.736 --> 01:04:18.157
We were up on billboards.

01:04:18.198 --> 01:04:21.921
So he's not gonna tell you about the big event in 2022, in January, before he met.

01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:38.162
Before he met Bobby, he was on stage with Sasha Latupova, Meryl Nass, Robert Malone, and Mike Palmer of the Doctors for COVID Ethics in Stockholm.

01:04:40.463 --> 01:04:43.585
So of course, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:04:43.665 --> 01:04:45.966
got your number from Robert Malone.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.087
Robert Malone screened him already.

01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:50.749
Robert Malone met with him in a foreign country.

01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:53.161
Not in the UK.

01:04:53.642 --> 01:04:57.589
They met in Stockholm, Sweden with Meryl Nass at the hotel.

01:05:00.915 --> 01:05:01.716
Isn't that awesome?

01:05:02.237 --> 01:05:03.740
Sasha Latipova was there too.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.263
I wonder if Soph went along.

01:05:07.355 --> 01:05:09.877
you know, near San Francisco about this whole event happening.

01:05:10.357 --> 01:05:13.138
So that was also something else I, you know, I supported him with.

01:05:13.158 --> 01:05:15.060
And so we were constantly in communication with each other.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.602
And then, of course, he decides that he's going to align with Trump.

01:05:18.702 --> 01:05:19.822
And then the election happens.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:31.149
And I have no doubt, John, that the key factor from everything I was observing and speaking to people in the grassroots and being for months in America, the key factor, I think, that helped Trump win the election was Robert Kennedy, Jr.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:33.891
Being months in America

01:05:34.611 --> 01:05:35.514
Did you hear what he said?

01:05:35.594 --> 01:05:37.641
Being months in America.

01:05:37.661 --> 01:05:38.845
Did you hear what he said?

01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:41.152
Being months in America.

01:05:43.455 --> 01:05:44.216
I agree completely.

01:05:44.556 --> 01:05:50.421
I think everyone, I think Trump recognises that with the way he's respecting him at the moment.

01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:51.422
Absolutely.

01:05:51.462 --> 01:06:04.432
And I think that gap that was created in particular between him and Kamala, which people thought would be very narrow, was primarily driven, John, by people's concerns around what happened with the handling of Covid and specifically the mRNA vaccine.

01:06:05.113 --> 01:06:08.736
So when all that started, you know, I'd also interacted, I'd met

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.141
Don't be, just hold on loosely.

01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:56.563
But don't let go.

01:06:56.703 --> 01:07:02.766
If you cling to a tight end, you're gonna lose control.

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:07.428
You're better than someone to believe in.

01:07:07.628 --> 01:07:11.049
And a whole lot of space to breathe in.

01:07:11.509 --> 01:07:17.852
It's so damn easy when your feelings are such.

01:07:51.837 --> 01:07:54.788
To believe in, in a whole lot of things.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.373
feel like what you have.

01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:30.556
So hold on loosely, but don't let go.

01:08:30.676 --> 01:08:37.201
If you cling to tightness, you're going to lose control.

01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:49.290
Your pivot is someone to believe in and a whole lot of space to breathe.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.365
You're gonna lose it

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:47.390
To turn them to heart.

01:10:12.946 --> 01:10:15.242
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

01:10:39.454 --> 01:10:40.875
Hello, hello, hello.

01:10:40.915 --> 01:10:42.076
Welcome to the show.

01:10:42.156 --> 01:10:43.517
We're on the back half here.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:46.339
We're going to make this go quick because I got to go to the gym around 1.

01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:50.081
71 people in the chat though are in the viewing.

01:10:50.141 --> 01:10:51.402
I don't even know what's going on here.

01:10:51.422 --> 01:10:52.543
It's got to be a fake number.

01:10:53.103 --> 01:10:54.444
Wait, no more Allman Brothers.

01:10:54.824 --> 01:10:55.384
Sorry about that.

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:58.110
Didn't click over there.

01:10:59.471 --> 01:11:00.331
Great to see you guys.

01:11:00.371 --> 01:11:01.071
Great to be here.

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:01.852
I'm really happy.

01:11:02.812 --> 01:11:12.336
I started the show with a little Nurse Campbell and Aseem Malhotra because I think those guys are pretty easy to accept as meddlers.

01:11:14.156 --> 01:11:30.461
Nurse Campbell's record on the internet is just it's appalling and his limited spectrum of debate on the RNA as Coordinated by that other old white guy who's been on a lot of shows It's just atrocious that guy actually was also on Brett Weinstein's show not too long ago.

01:11:30.942 --> 01:11:31.662
So this whole

01:11:32.302 --> 01:11:50.570
Obfuscation of the real simple truths about what they know and don't know about transfection and why they could have never expected it to work is going to be obfuscated by detailed stories about immunology and autoimmunity and all this other stuff with details that don't matter because the details aren't the issue.

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:53.651
The detail is that they didn't know, but they did know.

01:11:54.628 --> 01:11:58.690
They didn't know what it would do, but they did know that it would hurt people.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:00.571
And that's really the trick here.

01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:07.955
This team of performers is there because they were recruited and took money to lie about why people die.

01:12:08.635 --> 01:12:19.621
And not only is, I think, somebody like Peggy Hall, somebody who does that, but I definitely am sure that this

01:12:20.823 --> 01:12:35.980
absolute fraud dr drew was he at the brownstone thing in pittsburgh i can't remember anymore but that that guy is remarkably fake um and another guy who's remarkably fake is this dude here this uh

01:12:37.841 --> 01:13:00.970
Let me just say this gentleman, he actually came up to me at the Pittsburgh Brownstone meeting during a break and without introducing himself really or asking me who I was, he immediately insinuated that I wasn't having a good time and that I should be careful not to encroach on anyone else's good time, something like that.

01:13:01.091 --> 01:13:02.451
It was very bizarre.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:06.393
He really did come over to, I guess, attempt to warn me.

01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:09.094
I'm not really sure.

01:13:09.114 --> 01:13:18.141
It was kind of the same thing with me being in a conversation with somebody there and having Brett Weinstein come up to me and hold my name tag for a minute and then walk away.

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:29.869
I couldn't really see him because he's so short, so I know it was him, but because I was looking at somebody else I couldn't look down to see what he was doing, but I could feel him touch my name tag on my waist.

01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:38.751
These are tiny short cowards who only look normal sized on the internet or in a movie screen.

01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:40.951
That's like Tom Cruise short.

01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:48.473
They have to cast people around these people to make sure that they don't reveal how ridiculously short they actually are.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:52.213
That's one of the things that happens around Tom Cruise all the time.

01:13:52.253 --> 01:14:00.115
They also lower this person or whatever to make sure that you don't see that everyone else is normal but Tom Cruise is a tiny person.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:10.578
And I think that, you know, to a large extent that happens on the Internet and that's why people are very comfortable on the Internet and very uncomfortable when they meet me in person.

01:14:10.758 --> 01:14:18.600
It's without exception that everyone that meets me is like, oh wow, I didn't expect you to be this big.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.241
Steve Kersh said that to me at a Broken Science meeting.

01:14:23.321 --> 01:14:27.022
Pierre Kory said that to me at a CHD conference.

01:14:27.582 --> 01:14:29.503
Even Ryan Cole.

01:14:30.764 --> 01:14:39.750
All of these people are... Even Andrew Huff said that to me in the door of the hotel where Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:49.017
was announcing his presidential candidacy when he was going out, I was going in, and he just said, oh my gosh, I didn't expect you to be this big.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.078
He didn't even say my name.

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:55.341
He just looked me in the eye and said, oh my gosh, I didn't expect you to be this big.

01:14:55.821 --> 01:14:58.323
These people are pathetic.

01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:06.273
And they have table meetings about some guy in the back of his garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, because I'm wiping the floor with them.

01:15:07.193 --> 01:15:12.735
And you can see how it is that it's happening because they're not actually talking about biology.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:16.496
They're not actually making progress intellectually with their messaging.

01:15:16.936 --> 01:15:19.677
They're not able to teach more people efficiently.

01:15:20.077 --> 01:15:25.579
They have no elevator pitch that has evolved over the last four years because they are frauds.

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:41.876
And so the World Health Organization has got its hand in a lot of the things that are being, that pediatrics do these days.

01:15:42.296 --> 01:15:43.876
Can we disentangle that?

01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:48.118
So he starts, he starts, sorry, I'll leave that go.

01:15:48.178 --> 01:15:50.498
He starts with using a clip from March of 2025.

01:15:50.538 --> 01:16:01.102
And of course he's gonna sell stuff and he's selling stuff on the back of having interviewed the Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America, that brilliant man.

01:16:02.486 --> 01:16:08.089
That articulate, brilliant man who, you know, just blows people away every time they give him the mic.

01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:16.994
So if we look here, we're going to talk about the birth rate implosion.

01:16:17.034 --> 01:16:19.996
So we're not going to talk about the population pyramid at all.

01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:26.139
We're only going to talk about how maybe the COVID shots are causing some birth rate implosion.

01:16:26.199 --> 01:16:27.260
Yeah.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.661
It couldn't be due with anything else.

01:16:29.568 --> 01:16:31.689
because that's all they talk about, COVID shot bad 2020.

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:41.394
Now what's interesting about this before we go is that in this talk, we're gonna mention Brett Weinstein.

01:16:41.854 --> 01:16:43.755
We're gonna mention Sasha Latupova.

01:16:44.588 --> 01:16:51.372
We're going to agree that these people have a lot to contribute to the current narrative about DARPA and DOD or something like that.

01:16:51.812 --> 01:17:00.477
And so the pathetic nature of the script and the pathetic lack of depth on their own bench of performers is actually now it's the end.

01:17:01.337 --> 01:17:01.857
It's the end.

01:17:02.298 --> 01:17:05.739
They don't have anyone else, but that shithead, Sasha Latupova.

01:17:05.779 --> 01:17:09.061
They don't have anybody else, but that shithead, Kevin McCarran.

01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:10.962
They don't have anybody else.

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:13.924
And so that's all they can promote.

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:19.710
They can't say somebody else's name because there's no one else on the bench.

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:35.399
And if the conservative movement that was manipulated by these people does not wake up soon to realize the extent to which they have been manipulated, America will be dissolved by their ignorance.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.662
The same ignorance that is present on the left in a different form.

01:17:40.441 --> 01:17:45.528
This idea that there's a good team and a bad team and good guys and bad guys on social media.

01:17:45.588 --> 01:17:46.470
It's not that way.

01:17:48.012 --> 01:17:55.983
The only good guys that you can possibly find in the world are alive and will rent a car with you or share a hotel room with you.

01:17:57.412 --> 01:18:01.355
or can have a conversation with your kids and their kids in the room together.

01:18:01.396 --> 01:18:02.476
Those are your neighbors.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:05.099
Those are your teammates.

01:18:05.299 --> 01:18:10.463
Everybody else is an imaginary figment of your imagination present only on your phone.

01:18:10.503 --> 01:18:20.032
And until you actually start to comprehend that, you will still be trapped by this illusion that makes this jackass somebody real.

01:18:20.712 --> 01:18:21.313
Come on.

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:49.634
because of social media and pornography btsd love addiction fentanyl and heroin ridiculous i'm a doctor for you can tell by how they talk you know i'm not a real hardcore about this stuff but i would rather hear hear any other

01:18:50.706 --> 01:19:01.759
word than uh you know somebody using the the phrase jesus christ man that just sounds so dumb it just sounds so naive

01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:10.076
It's like, you know, if you were to curse with the word Mohammed, you know, curse Mohammed or something like that.

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.238
Why would you choose to say that?

01:19:12.258 --> 01:19:13.779
That just sounds so dumb.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:25.189
When the English language has so many very tasty, nasty words like cunt and fuck and all this other stuff that you can say, and everybody feels the grind in their head.

01:19:25.649 --> 01:19:28.011
But that, when somebody is on TV,

01:19:28.892 --> 01:19:33.715
And repeatedly, over and over, the only swear word they feel comfortable with is Jesus Christ.

01:19:33.776 --> 01:19:34.716
That's just stupid.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:37.718
I don't understand that other than malevolence.

01:19:37.818 --> 01:19:38.359
It's yucky.

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:39.339
It's wrong.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.020
It's dumb.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.061
And it shows scripting.

01:19:42.642 --> 01:19:48.446
Because if you were really, really trying to be a gentleman and a professional, no one ever goes there.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.283
I guess if you get surprised and that's what comes out of your mouth, I'm totally fine with that.

01:19:55.323 --> 01:20:02.688
But if that's just something of how you talk when you're in a suit on stage with the lights and cameras on, that's scripted.

01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:05.210
That's scripted bullshit.

01:20:08.968 --> 01:20:10.749
treatment before you kill people.

01:20:10.929 --> 01:20:11.649
I am a clinician.

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.511
I observe things about these chemicals, but just deal with what's real.

01:20:14.531 --> 01:20:16.732
We used to get these calls on Loveline all the time.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:19.414
Educate adolescents and to prevent and to treat.

01:20:19.494 --> 01:20:22.195
If you have trouble, you can't stop, and you want help stopping, I can help.

01:20:22.536 --> 01:20:23.436
I got a lot to say.

01:20:23.456 --> 01:20:24.637
I got a lot more to say.

01:20:34.218 --> 01:20:38.200
I'm excited to bring you a new product, a new supplement, Fatty.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:39.001
I take it.

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:40.082
I make Susan take it.

01:20:40.162 --> 01:20:52.049
And so again, if you think in the context of the FDA being the problem that these people are trying to solve, and then you think about how many of these people are selling things all the time,

01:20:53.271 --> 01:21:05.159
These are all things that are not evaluated by the FDA, that are not approved by the FDA, that for one reason or another, the FDA would technically be in the way of them being able to make more money.

01:21:08.841 --> 01:21:11.163
This is the health freedom that they are fighting for.

01:21:12.188 --> 01:21:14.529
an unregulated supplement market.

01:21:14.609 --> 01:21:21.993
That's what they are, the health freedom that these people are fighting for by reading their discount codes for all of these products.

01:21:22.093 --> 01:21:23.474
And Kim Iverson does it.

01:21:24.835 --> 01:21:26.076
Brett Weinstein does it.

01:21:26.136 --> 01:21:27.296
Dr. Drew does it.

01:21:28.797 --> 01:21:30.198
I mean, everyone does it.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:36.365
Every one of these people does it, except for Mark and I and Joe Marshall.

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.487
We are all supported by our viewers, that's it.

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:40.629
Joe Marshall's not even supported by his viewers.

01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:41.791
Joe Marshall's got a job.

01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.514
Mark's not really supported by his viewers.

01:21:44.574 --> 01:21:45.334
His show is.

01:21:45.795 --> 01:21:49.359
The rest of his life is supported by a hard-working wife.

01:21:55.441 --> 01:22:01.188
These people are frauds with sub stacks with 45,000 subscribers.

01:22:01.348 --> 01:22:06.515
Even if a tenth of those people pay, this guy is a fraud and a grifter and a shithead.

01:22:08.956 --> 01:22:20.746
helpful, it's danish on X, also vbica manica on Instagram, and the same thing, the website is vbica manica.dk.

01:22:21.347 --> 01:22:27.332
Jeffrey Tucker, on the other hand, is quite a bit easier, more easily remembered and executed.

01:22:27.912 --> 01:22:32.656
Jeffrey Tucker on X, that's that, and jeffreytucker.me.

01:22:33.277 --> 01:22:33.977
Jeffrey, welcome.

01:22:35.359 --> 01:22:36.279
Thank you for making that easy.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:37.701
Sure.

01:22:38.321 --> 01:22:40.362
Oddly though, I think you made a mistake.

01:22:40.502 --> 01:22:42.484
I think it's Jeffrey A. Tucker.

01:22:42.664 --> 01:22:44.465
Yeah.

01:22:44.565 --> 01:22:45.426
You're correct.

01:22:45.486 --> 01:22:48.888
It is Jeffrey A. Tucker on X and it's Jeffrey Tucker on the website.

01:22:49.288 --> 01:22:49.768
So yes.

01:22:49.849 --> 01:22:50.209
Okay.

01:22:50.249 --> 01:22:51.169
Well, I would assume.

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:58.974
Again, one of the stunts that you should see here is that this conservative movement was brewed up and controlled largely by X.

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:09.564
And one of the things that these people are being paid to do is create the illusion of relevance for X in as many of these countries as possible.

01:23:10.304 --> 01:23:11.965
That's why the debate happens there.

01:23:12.025 --> 01:23:13.545
That's why they post there.

01:23:13.585 --> 01:23:15.306
That's why they promote themselves there.

01:23:15.326 --> 01:23:23.007
And that's why when they hand out their social media, this guy only hands out X because Brownstone is probably was set up.

01:23:23.047 --> 01:23:26.948
He was probably set up by the people that are using X against us.

01:23:26.988 --> 01:23:29.089
And it's not, it's not Elon Musk.

01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:35.816
X is a military program, just like Facebook is, just like all of these programs are.

01:23:36.737 --> 01:23:43.224
And they put that shithead in front of you and say that Elon Musk is running it or running it or controlling it or bought it.

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:44.325
It's all nonsense.

01:23:45.226 --> 01:23:46.247
It's all nonsense.

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:55.932
Just like Jeff Bezos is using a military distribution program and optimizing it and then pretending like he's the businessman with the bright idea.

01:23:56.112 --> 01:23:57.213
It's just bullshit.

01:23:58.013 --> 01:24:00.653
Steve Kirsch did not invent the optical mouse.

01:24:00.974 --> 01:24:01.814
I mean, come on.

01:24:01.834 --> 01:24:06.155
I'm going to send everybody over to Jeffrey Tucker, so good for you that I didn't do that.

01:24:06.835 --> 01:24:08.135
So you seemed a little...

01:24:10.276 --> 01:24:12.938
Hmm, downtrodden today.

01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:16.179
Is something come through that's got to you?

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:23.544
I know Brownstone is in the crosshairs, but as one publicist said to me the other day, she goes, look, if you're not in the middle of a shitstorm, you don't exist.

01:24:24.004 --> 01:24:25.445
So congratulations, you exist.

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.531
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

01:24:29.191 --> 01:24:29.812
I'm just tired of it.

01:24:30.072 --> 01:24:32.693
It's all so predictable and so preposterous.

01:24:32.733 --> 01:24:37.615
I just got through reading some article on ABC, NBC, MSNBC, I don't know, one of these things.

01:24:38.435 --> 01:24:52.722
And they're wailing and whining about the new ACIP committee, which is the advisors for immunization practices that works with the CDC on vaccines.

01:24:55.243 --> 01:24:59.285
RFK got rid of the 17 members that were heavily conflicted.

01:24:59.326 --> 01:25:02.527
We documented that today on our article for Brownstone.

01:25:02.547 --> 01:25:04.609
They're basically working for vaccine companies.

01:25:05.089 --> 01:25:17.036
Failed to recuse themselves and votes on these pharmaceutical products that, even though they're working for the same companies that are producing the— I mean, this can't be possible, right?

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:21.244
This conversation was happening already 10 years ago.

01:25:21.264 --> 01:25:24.185
Now they just have a different dipshit saying it to you.

01:25:24.225 --> 01:25:25.365
There's no progress here.

01:25:26.226 --> 01:25:27.926
The ACIP is conflicted.

01:25:28.366 --> 01:25:33.428
Now he's replacing the people on the ACIP with a bunch of people that were, again, they're conflicted.

01:25:33.468 --> 01:25:39.610
They're conflicted because they are part of this controlled op, this fake health freedom movement.

01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:47.997
And all of them, all of them, Kevin McKernan in the video that I didn't play the audio, I was promoting one of them, Retsit Levy.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:51.971
A guy who's from MIT and plenty smart.

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:55.813
I'm sure he's smart enough to know that there's a population pyramid out there.

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:58.854
I'm sure he's smart enough to know that that needed managing.

01:25:59.315 --> 01:26:14.822
I'm sure he's smart enough to know that if he went to that Scottish blog, Benamina Phenon or Biology Phenomenon, whatever it is that I promote in the beginning, that he would be able to see that something really gross and disturbing happened in Scotland, but he's not gonna do that.

01:26:18.686 --> 01:26:23.948
Instead, he's gonna stick to the COVID shots are bad, don't talk about 2020, just like these two morons.

01:26:25.469 --> 01:26:29.151
These are despicable traitors to American grandkids.

01:26:29.191 --> 01:26:32.492
These are some of the worst Americans alive because they are frauds.

01:26:33.433 --> 01:26:37.615
They are faking it until they make it and they think they've made it already.

01:26:39.059 --> 01:26:40.420
drugs on which they're voting.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.344
And so RFK said, all right, it's enough of this nonsense.

01:26:44.604 --> 01:26:49.749
And, and, and hired eight new independent experts who are unpaid by the way.

01:26:49.769 --> 01:26:54.634
And that means that it's, there's no, they, they can't tell him that he can't be around.

01:26:54.694 --> 01:26:56.055
He can be wherever he wants to be.

01:26:56.075 --> 01:26:57.276
He's an unpaid volunteer.

01:26:57.296 --> 01:27:01.120
He's just here because he loves the government so much.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:04.103
I wonder who's taking care of his emus.

01:27:04.597 --> 01:27:26.558
some of them are associated with brownstone and of course we're in the crosshairs so i'm reading this nonsense in the mainstream media about me so we're supposed to believe that this guy is responsible for assembling an all-star team of academics who were dissidents during the covid and has now given them stipends so that they can help save america stop lying

01:27:30.114 --> 01:27:30.934
He's a fraud.

01:27:31.155 --> 01:27:32.375
This guy's a fraud.

01:27:32.495 --> 01:27:47.564
This guy has lawyers on brownstone payroll, like Bobby Ann Cox, who can't even say the words strict scrutiny and explain what it means in the context of American law without freaking out and asking Mendel Hall to come over, who also couldn't do it.

01:27:48.834 --> 01:27:50.895
These people are frauds right to my face.

01:27:50.915 --> 01:27:54.777
You know, the lawyers that just lost the case for Grace Shara?

01:27:54.818 --> 01:27:59.700
Yes, those lawyers were at the Brownstone meeting in Pittsburgh in November of 2024.

01:28:00.661 --> 01:28:06.044
And I spoke to them before Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein got up on stage.

01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:10.787
And I asked them, why aren't we attacking the PrEP Act on the basis of it being unconstitutional?

01:28:11.247 --> 01:28:39.752
because it doesn't hold the government to strict scrutiny when it's allowed to suspend fundamental rights using the declaration of the rational basis test alone on a non-elected official and they stared at me with like the weirdest looks and then bobby ann cox one of the fellows of brownstone said hey mendel hall can you come over here and talk to this guy you know the lawyer of

01:28:40.908 --> 01:29:01.061
of of grace's dad that guy and he couldn't explain it either he couldn't say anything he didn't really know what i was talking like he's smiling i guess the talk is gonna start we got to find our seats stop lying i think grace shara's case was sabotaged from the beginning um

01:29:02.168 --> 01:29:03.849
I don't think they ever intended to win.

01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:08.033
Otherwise they would have been talking about the protocols in a much more precise way.

01:29:08.053 --> 01:29:12.257
I don't, I honestly, I, I think they were sabotaged.

01:29:13.578 --> 01:29:28.270
And I think there are going to be other cases in America that are being sabotaged, set up to fail so that the court precedence is set and the clock has essentially run out on all of the people who were murdered in America.

01:29:29.761 --> 01:29:33.722
me about Brownstone or our work, and none of it is correct.

01:29:33.782 --> 01:29:35.363
It's all just silly.

01:29:35.383 --> 01:29:49.347
I don't know who's writing those articles, but I know on whose behalf they're writing the articles, which is their advertisers, who, you know, are inevitably the pharmaceutical companies that previously paid the old ASEP members.

01:29:49.547 --> 01:29:54.449
In other words, the corruption and, you know, the quid pro quos, the system, it's so

01:29:55.289 --> 01:30:05.037
obvious to me now, it just gets tiresome, as does the rhetoric, as do the brutal attacks and that sort of thing.

01:30:05.497 --> 01:30:06.518
It's maddening, truly.

01:30:07.099 --> 01:30:07.699
It's tiresome.

01:30:07.879 --> 01:30:08.500
It is tiresome.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.882
But we are curing your gale man amnesia.

01:30:11.522 --> 01:30:13.683
I think I explained to you once before what this is, right?

01:30:14.064 --> 01:30:24.811
And the cure to Gail Mann amnesia, the surest cure, is to have a print media outlet, particularly a newspaper, particularly a major, write an article about you.

01:30:25.471 --> 01:30:29.874
Then you will realize how far from the truth they stray.

01:30:30.295 --> 01:30:35.258
And trust me, just because they're writing it about you, you're not the only subject.

01:30:35.358 --> 01:30:36.539
They're having a blast.

01:30:37.259 --> 01:30:38.039
They love this.

01:30:38.119 --> 01:30:42.220
This has been a very lucrative little thing for them to have done.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.480
I'm gonna stand up.

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:48.041
This has been a very lucrative thing for them to have done.

01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:50.822
So make no mistake about it.

01:30:51.622 --> 01:30:54.122
I'm just trying to watch cords so they don't get stuck on something.

01:30:54.302 --> 01:30:54.603
Sorry.

01:30:56.003 --> 01:30:57.183
Make no mistake about it.

01:30:58.043 --> 01:31:01.724
These people are... Did it stop?

01:31:01.744 --> 01:31:05.745
Is it stuck on something?

01:31:05.765 --> 01:31:06.645
Could go a little higher.

01:31:08.604 --> 01:31:13.210
I could go a little higher.

01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:14.531
There we go.

01:31:20.529 --> 01:31:23.531
Yeah, so these guys are on a script provided by Robert Malone.

01:31:23.571 --> 01:31:24.811
That's why they're so happy.

01:31:24.871 --> 01:31:29.994
That's why they're performing the way they are, because to them, it appears like it's exactly on plan.

01:31:30.474 --> 01:31:31.575
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:31:31.635 --> 01:31:33.676
is at the Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:31:34.857 --> 01:31:45.963
Robert Malone has predicted and successfully gotten Jay Bhattacharya in at NHS, and they have this UK citizen guy at the head of the FDA, just like they were told would happen.

01:31:47.165 --> 01:31:52.450
And so they're very happy to see that things are going well and that this is on plan.

01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:53.911
That's why they're so excited.

01:31:55.112 --> 01:31:58.735
I'm gonna see if I can get to the gym with my boys before it gets too hot.

01:32:00.297 --> 01:32:02.198
And I thank you very much for being here.

01:32:02.258 --> 01:32:03.419
I hope you have a great weekend.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.284
I probably will not be online over the weekend, even though I always feel as though I should be.

01:32:09.456 --> 01:32:34.535
I'm trying to get in the habit of recovering on the weekend and focusing on Contributing something to the parenting of my children, which I often don't do in the mornings during the week But I will be back for five days a week again next week The habit is there now it's built in so I think we're gonna be able to create a better and better schedule And pivot slowly again, like we tried to do a couple months ago from reporting exclusively on

01:32:35.276 --> 01:32:50.145
the show, and instead try to move on to teaching some of this basic biology, trying to debunk virology in a systematic way, and teach you the biology that edifies that position.

01:32:50.225 --> 01:32:53.807
So anyway, without any more stuttering, thank you very much.

01:32:54.207 --> 01:32:55.128
Have a happy Friday.

01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:58.350
I can't thank all of my supporters enough.

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:01.452
The small ones that are giving me $10 a month

01:33:03.714 --> 01:33:04.377
That matters.

01:33:05.362 --> 01:33:07.754
And the people that are giving me more than that, you know.

01:33:08.989 --> 01:33:09.970
It definitely matters.

01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:13.351
A couple of you know that you're the only people that really keep this thing afloat.

01:33:13.431 --> 01:33:17.293
So all together, it's really like 150 of us.

01:33:17.353 --> 01:33:24.056
So if you are here regularly and a part of this and share it in any way, then you are a part of that group as well.

01:33:24.276 --> 01:33:26.757
And I can't thank you enough for your efforts.

01:33:27.737 --> 01:33:29.498
But please make sure there are efforts.

01:33:29.578 --> 01:33:33.020
Please make sure that you're not just casually on the sideline.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.681
cheering me on.

01:33:34.741 --> 01:33:36.742
I need you guys to take action.

01:33:36.802 --> 01:33:38.723
I need you to send links to people.

01:33:39.764 --> 01:33:41.265
I need you to share my PeerTube.

01:33:41.665 --> 01:33:46.088
I need you to share my website.

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:52.752
And I need you to try and learn this stuff yourself so that you can better teach it yourself.

01:33:53.473 --> 01:33:54.653
Thanks very much for being here.

01:33:55.834 --> 01:33:56.815
And I'll see you again next week.
