WEBVTT

00:24.475 --> 00:24.895
you you

01:01.647 --> 01:04.249
So the fourth one might actually be the easiest to get going.

01:04.849 --> 01:12.373
So this is the New World Screw Worm, which has the amazing scientific name of Cochleomyia hominivorex, the man devourer.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.500
But it doesn't primarily eat humans.

01:15.781 --> 01:20.744
It feeds indiscriminately on worm-blooded things, so mammals and birds.

01:22.225 --> 01:28.389
And it is a bot fly that lays its eggs in open wounds, anything as small as a tick bite.

01:29.029 --> 01:33.893
And it's called the screw worm because the larvae are screw-shaped and they drill their way into living flesh, devouring it.

01:34.673 --> 01:38.476
And we know that it's horrendously painful because people get affected by this.

01:39.551 --> 01:44.214
And the standard of treatment is you give them morphine immediately so that surgeons can cut the things out.

01:45.075 --> 01:46.255
Because it's just that painful.

01:46.276 --> 01:47.837
It's unbelievably agonizing.

01:48.337 --> 01:51.739
So a billion animals are devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots every single year.

01:52.440 --> 01:58.744
We even know that we can eradicate this species from at least many ecosystems and not see any effects because it used to be present in North America, too.

01:59.741 --> 02:00.421
And we wiped it out.

02:01.182 --> 02:16.971
American taxpayer dollars today contribute to the creation and maintenance of a living wall of sterile screwworm flies released in Southern Panama that prevents the South American screwworm from re-invading North America.

02:17.772 --> 02:20.233
But there's too many of them in South America to wipe out by that means.

02:20.814 --> 02:23.615
And so the way forward is obviously gene drive.

02:24.216 --> 02:28.819
Uruguay suffers, they lose about 0.1% of their total country's GDP.

02:29.690 --> 02:30.290
to the screwworm.

02:30.891 --> 02:37.856
But from an animal wellbeing perspective, in addition to the human development, typical lifetime of an insect species is several million years.

02:38.876 --> 02:48.903
So 10 to the sixth years times 10 to the ninth hosts per year means an expected 10 to the 15th mammals and birds devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots.

02:49.604 --> 02:57.269
For comparison, if we continue factory farming for another 100 years, that would be 10 to the 13th broiler hens and pigs.

02:58.243 --> 03:14.364
So unless it's 100 times worse to be a factory-farmed broiler hen than it is to be devoured alive by flesh-eating maggots, then when you integrate over the future, it is more important for animal well-being that we eradicate the new world screw room from the wild than it is that we end factory farming tomorrow.

03:33.840 --> 03:43.947
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the, of America, of the American people is being used to create the crisis.

03:44.007 --> 03:47.910
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin maybe America.

03:48.050 --> 03:48.491
I don't know.

03:49.151 --> 03:49.992
Crash the dollar.

03:50.212 --> 03:50.652
I don't know.

03:51.193 --> 03:55.115
Steal the rest of our, our, what limited treasury value we have left.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.378
I don't know, but I know for sure.

03:58.786 --> 04:16.225
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

04:19.321 --> 04:25.125
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

04:25.565 --> 04:28.608
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

04:28.688 --> 04:38.135
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

04:38.155 --> 04:44.760
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

05:36.038 --> 05:41.960
picture, your name and lights above it.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.442
This is your big debut.

05:46.542 --> 05:49.963
It's like a dream come true.

05:50.143 --> 05:57.305
And when your smile goes down, oh, they're gonna love it.

05:57.426 --> 05:59.146
I like your pin shot.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.167
I keep it when you're mad.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.130
you see it

07:32.359 --> 07:33.165
in your ladder

08:17.051 --> 08:18.894
You see it all

09:21.152 --> 09:21.712
you you

09:55.973 --> 09:57.914
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

09:59.014 --> 10:03.736
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.897
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.218
It's embarrassing.

10:27.523 --> 10:29.185
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

10:29.245 --> 10:30.187
Actually, good afternoon.

10:30.247 --> 10:32.029
It's 12.30 p.m.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.411
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:34.813 --> 10:38.418
We have been running circles around these people over the last couple weeks.

10:39.039 --> 10:44.646
And although our consciousness does remain the prime real estate that everybody's trying to compete for your attention, really,

10:45.787 --> 10:46.488
We are winning.

10:47.309 --> 10:49.411
I can feel the momentum changing.

10:49.491 --> 10:51.533
I can see their messaging changing.

10:52.534 --> 10:55.296
They keep speeding up their script and it's just not working.

10:56.117 --> 11:01.321
And more and more people are starting to see that we have been under the influence of charlatans for

11:02.242 --> 11:25.465
More than a few years now, more like decades, and it's only because of our acquiescence to social media that we start to see this concerted effort to create an illusion of consensus that can trap us, instead of trying to inform us about what would have gotten us out, like intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb,

11:26.005 --> 11:32.812
Transfection in healthy humans will always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

11:33.293 --> 11:44.384
These ideas are going to be continued to be ignored because they still want our kids to grow up believing that there was a mystery virus that explains these excess deaths when in reality it was just murder.

11:44.884 --> 11:47.947
There is no evidence of spread because it was murder.

11:48.347 --> 11:59.517
And if you want to see spread, you got to see the spread of bad ideas or the lack thereof, the lack of good ideas spreading around like fighting for strict liability or our Seventh Amendment rights.

12:01.018 --> 12:04.561
I think we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

12:04.621 --> 12:21.053
I think we need a new consensus about transfection and I think we need a new consensus about the basics of molecular biology and RNA because then we will be indeed out of this illusion of consensus because again only if we

12:21.994 --> 12:25.655
allow these people to be the thought leaders.

12:25.795 --> 12:32.917
And if we allow them to put thoughts in our head, is it possible for them to maintain this limited spectrum of debate?

12:32.997 --> 12:36.058
And this basically defines the totalitarianism.

12:36.558 --> 12:39.239
It defines this trap that we're in.

12:39.279 --> 12:48.662
These acolytes and their concerted efforts at lying are really where we are.

12:51.343 --> 12:56.466
And so weaponized piles of money have convinced us who to argue with and what to argue about.

12:57.267 --> 13:04.911
And participating in their argument has accepted, just by the way it works, we have accepted the premise of their narrative.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.414
And that's how we got sucked into the Scooby-Doo mystery of the lab leak or the novel virus.

13:10.054 --> 13:36.507
And by getting sucked into that original Scooby-Doo with the early treatment and with the spike protein, we are essentially, we're lost and trapped in this mythology thinking that if we just, you know, fought with the right people or got on board or retweeted the right people that we would be fighting against Fauci and Ralph Baric and USAID and EcoHealth Alliance and the Communist Party of China.

13:36.968 --> 13:39.489
And this is all part of their theater.

13:40.757 --> 13:45.060
And engaging with their argument has always been the way they trapped us.

13:45.100 --> 13:55.769
And unfortunately, I got trapped while I was trying to work for tenure at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine as a patch clamp physiologist.

13:55.849 --> 14:02.154
This is me in all my get up trying to make it in academia.

14:02.174 --> 14:07.137
There's a long history of my work in academia where you can just see how

14:08.098 --> 14:14.964
dedicated and productive I was with regard to trying to become a tenured biology professor.

14:15.024 --> 14:26.714
I really loved teaching and I really wanted to do that and so one of the only things that I could think of at the beginning of the pandemic when this all went south was to start teaching online and that's what I did.

14:27.435 --> 14:34.080
And that has evolved into a PeerTube channel, which is just basically a YouTube clone that anyone can log on to.

14:34.580 --> 14:35.961
You don't need an account.

14:36.681 --> 14:47.409
There are clips there that are produced by Jeff from Earth, one of the biggest supporters of the stream, who also dedicates a lot of time, as does Ted, who has maintained this

14:48.149 --> 14:54.712
this set of federated social media instances for me and us.

14:54.872 --> 15:03.877
The courses that I'm working on, trying to get going, but not with as much momentum as I wanted to, but that's going to change, I promise.

15:03.897 --> 15:05.517
There's so much going on right now.

15:05.557 --> 15:12.741
There's the books that we're trying to read and push, and there's also material available on my website, GigaOMBiological.com.

15:13.441 --> 15:15.062
at the stuff link at the bottom.

15:15.102 --> 15:23.848
The Batcave is an archive of videos and Housatonic, Mark Kulak out of Boston is uploading a lot of his most recent stuff there as well.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.370
So it's kind of a one-stop shop for a lot of this stuff.

15:27.430 --> 15:39.858
I haven't gotten around to putting Joe Marshall's stuff there or any of the really good stuff that Scott Shara of deprogramming with Grace's dad has been putting up on Rumble.

15:40.998 --> 15:46.040
And I should apologize for that, but there's a limited space on that server.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.301
Jeff's working really hard.

15:47.361 --> 15:48.341
I'm working really hard.

15:48.761 --> 15:50.542
Maybe we want to grow a little slowly.

15:51.142 --> 16:01.466
And so I'm going to keep promoting those guys and keep telling you to go to Rumble and subscribe and watch them and share their work, especially the work that you

16:02.266 --> 16:04.448
You find there that you think is really great.

16:04.488 --> 16:08.511
Hi, my name is Jonathan Cooley I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

16:08.852 --> 16:09.352
It's 1234.

16:09.892 --> 16:10.133
Sorry.

16:10.173 --> 16:23.403
I'm late, but at least I'm here I've got a pretty good quick agenda today that I want to get through and so I'll just fade the music out We are always on this starship when we start because in reality We are in fact

16:24.584 --> 16:34.875
By acquiescing to social media, we are also on a sort of simulation, a little set, if you will, with a lot of really fancy props.

16:34.935 --> 16:40.541
And so for a long while, we were fooled because, of course, at the beginning of the pandemic, we were told to go home.

16:41.042 --> 16:45.647
And we were told that the battle was on social media, the battle for truth, the battle for information.

16:46.187 --> 16:49.509
Because, you know, the mainstream media wasn't going to tell us.

16:49.829 --> 16:51.790
Ouchie wasn't going to go on TV and tell us.

16:52.330 --> 16:56.512
And so we went on X and we went on these other platforms to try and find the truth.

16:56.932 --> 17:04.496
And by engaging in this battle, we thought we were going to get through the pandemic together despite what these governments were going to cover up.

17:04.896 --> 17:10.259
And that was all an elaborate illusion that has been extended for five years now by those people

17:10.999 --> 17:19.170
on X who pretended to be listening to us but have never been able to come to these biologically almost certainties.

17:19.190 --> 17:22.434
They haven't been able to come to these things in 10 or 12 years of trying.

17:23.331 --> 17:31.721
And so the only way to explain that is that a lot of these people are cooperating with a lot of those people to govern us by a mythology.

17:31.781 --> 17:41.794
And that governance is almost completely enabled now and overwhelmingly done through the use of social media.

17:43.959 --> 17:55.227
And so I think it's just so vital for everyone to self-assess what's really going on here with regard to social media and how you use it.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.249
Because there is a certain reality here.

17:58.289 --> 18:05.134
You only got about 30,000 thoughts that can go through the space between your ears and reach consciousness every day.

18:05.814 --> 18:21.677
And of those 30,000 thoughts, if you surrender any significant portion of them to social media or the liars that are coordinatingly acting on social media, then it is almost inevitable that you will not arrive at a truth which can save your grandchildren from enslavement.

18:23.317 --> 18:25.999
I know that sounds nuts, but that's where we are.

18:26.479 --> 18:39.647
And that's why there's a very specific cadre of people that is capable of debating within this limited spectrum of debate about the fact that the COVID shots are bad, so long as we don't talk about what they were doing before 2020 and in 2020.

18:42.967 --> 18:53.150
And the reason why is because there needed to be a coordinated group of people in order to make sure that none of us would ever come to the realization that, wait, I saw that on the news a decade ago.

18:53.870 --> 19:07.494
I saw people talking about that on TNT, some kind of special with some guy named Ted Turner was talking about how the population pyramid was going to have a bunch of old people in a few years, and this might bankrupt America if we're not careful.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.815
and that end-of-life care is really expensive, yada, yada, yada.

19:11.195 --> 19:20.657
They knew there was going to be an increase in all-cause mortality, and they knew that if it wasn't carefully managed, it could potentially really hurt a lot of Western nations.

19:20.717 --> 19:34.380
There's also good reason to believe in your common sense of the brain, a corner of your brain that's almost ignored completely when you're on social media, that China probably has the same problem, and that's why they have a one-child policy.

19:36.343 --> 19:43.288
I mean, it's also a consequence of a one-child policy, of course, that you get this inverted pyramid.

19:43.769 --> 19:50.834
And these data that we are looking at here, we have no reason to believe that these are the honest-to-goodness numbers.

19:51.255 --> 20:00.302
And the worst that this little bump of old people coming up to the top at retirement age a few years ago that everybody was worried about would bankrupt Social Security and Medicare,

20:01.002 --> 20:17.765
If that bump is bigger than what they say, if they've concealed it on purpose in order to use it for all kinds of things, don't let a crisis go to waste, then you can also see why all these nations were so coordinated on it, because they all had the same problem.

20:19.285 --> 20:23.966
They didn't all have to murder people in 2020 in order to get this illusion to stick.

20:24.366 --> 20:28.407
They just all had to agree to ignore the murder that occurred in America.

20:29.895 --> 20:55.189
the murder by opioids, the murder by sickness, the murder by poisoning, the murder by environmental toxins and the murder by the vaccine schedule, which any of these Western nations and any of these Western nations doctors like Dutch doctors or English doctors or French doctors could have just looked at the publicly published vaccine schedule in America and could have said, holy shit, that's weird.

20:55.229 --> 20:56.470
We don't do that in France.

20:57.355 --> 21:12.780
that's weird we don't do that in Norway but was there ever a doctor in Norway or in Sweden or in Scotland or in the UK or anywhere that was you know rising in popularity and leading a movement to say what in the hell are they doing in America

21:13.380 --> 21:25.688
given so many shots so much earlier than we give even if we just look at the total number of shots it's pretty frightening but then we look at the calendar and when they give them and it's actually pretty different.

21:26.088 --> 21:27.229
Why do they do that?

21:27.629 --> 21:30.991
Why isn't there an international doctor after five years in this?

21:31.051 --> 21:33.353
Why isn't there an international doctor saying that?

21:34.053 --> 21:34.874
Why not one?

21:37.830 --> 21:42.231
And the reason why is because they all have the same problem.

21:42.271 --> 21:55.714
Because they all, to a certain extent, have been using the vaccine schedule as a way to get in front of this, as a way to slowly erode the sovereignty of their own citizens.

21:57.995 --> 21:59.235
They all have the same problem.

22:01.772 --> 22:13.244
And so once the United States decided how it was going to solve its problem and had the cooperation of some of its allies, what could China do but go along with it?

22:13.584 --> 22:16.367
Because, you know, they don't have to murder anybody, but, you know.

22:18.775 --> 22:19.675
What are they going to do?

22:19.775 --> 22:24.777
Spoil it and say, oh no, they're just murdering people because they have this inverted population pyramid.

22:24.817 --> 22:29.499
Then they would call the attention to this problem in their own country and all the other countries.

22:29.519 --> 22:31.219
This is the heart of it.

22:31.319 --> 22:42.083
And the list of ways that through protocols and what seems like common sense, you know, if it says you're low in your pulse ox, then you might as well give them oxygen.

22:42.663 --> 22:43.784
I mean, it comes in bottles.

22:52.887 --> 22:54.709
It is long day to see.

22:54.950 --> 22:55.991
Hacking court.

22:56.191 --> 22:57.132
Accident.

22:57.273 --> 22:57.954
Etcetera.

22:57.994 --> 22:58.775
Who's the lot?

22:59.856 --> 23:00.657
C'est pas ou.

23:00.997 --> 23:01.778
La dible.

23:01.979 --> 23:03.000
Acquiesce.

23:23.805 --> 23:39.980
never let a crisis go to waste for free reign never let a crisis go to waste and so in 2020 there were people that were put in place in order to control the narrative about all these stories which are in reality elaborate illusions elaborate

23:40.700 --> 23:44.543
little compartmentalized debates that nobody could cover all of these.

23:44.703 --> 23:50.488
And so each little actor had a little subset that they would juggle between two or three of them.

23:50.528 --> 23:57.093
And all this did was really get all these rumors and things circulating in the consciousness of people around the world.

23:57.133 --> 24:07.822
The noosphere, if you will, was polluted with tidbits of a narrative that would have essentially covered for all the potential problems of a transfection to any new protein.

24:08.382 --> 24:17.507
And since their plan was to use this obviously terrible vaccine schedule to admit that, you know, some of these things weren't as good as they could have been.

24:17.547 --> 24:31.796
But now that we know so much more about our genome, and now that we got really lucky by saving millions of lives with a transfection, albeit one that was contaminated with some DNA or some endotoxin or some glass, at some point we're going to be able to figure this out.

24:32.296 --> 24:43.119
you know, serendipitously improve our vaccine schedule by several orders of magnitude because we're going to go to this unbelievable platform called transfection or nobody can call it that.

24:43.159 --> 24:45.800
This is just new genetic vaccines.

24:46.961 --> 24:49.061
Genetic vaccines.

24:49.981 --> 24:55.803
Not transformations using adenovirus or transfections using naked DNA or RNA.

24:55.863 --> 24:56.203
No, no.

24:56.624 --> 25:01.225
We're just going to be talking about these as a new platform for vaccination.

25:03.877 --> 25:15.323
And we've already seeded a narrative where there's this background endemic virus that has so many of the similar sort of outcomes in the worst case scenario as transfection would.

25:16.803 --> 25:27.448
And of course, we have five years of discussion already seeded about the spike protein and its properties, and there's all kinds of spike protein everywhere, and it's being shed, and it's in the environment.

25:27.508 --> 25:35.191
And so all of these narratives are present that can be very easily misconstrued as something other than what they are.

25:36.151 --> 25:43.334
And that's why all of these people agreed that the worst case scenario was endemicity, so that for the first two years, we could

25:45.445 --> 25:48.867
feign a struggle against endemicity.

25:49.787 --> 26:14.660
The goal was called zero COVID and people as diverse as Tony Fauci and Brett Weinstein discussed the feasibility of zero COVID as we progressed, as we realized that people weren't going to accept mandates, as we realized that not everybody was going to take the shot, as we realized that not everybody was going to wear masks all the time, it became very obvious that we're running out of time before endemicity

26:15.120 --> 26:15.661
occurs.

26:17.302 --> 26:24.067
And of course, endemicity is indistinguishable from a background if you don't have any data from before the pandemic.

26:27.470 --> 26:40.220
If you had absolutely no idea that there were any cars on earth, and then you started counting cars wherever you saw them, starting in January of 2020, it would sure seem like cars were spreading everywhere.

26:41.573 --> 26:49.998
And if that's the story that you wanted to tell with your observations as they poured in, you could tell that story.

26:50.858 --> 26:55.080
It would be very disingenuous, of course, but you could tell that story.

26:56.961 --> 26:59.663
Could call your neighbor up and say, oh my gosh, you can't believe it, but there's...

27:04.045 --> 27:21.851
And so let's just go back to 2022 and remember what I've suggested already at the end of the UK doctors thing that the immune system uses retroviruses, which would fall into this fraction where you spin down in a sucrose gradient at the very, very bottom.

27:21.871 --> 27:24.372
You have these little tiny particles with RNA and DNA in them.

27:24.952 --> 27:26.653
That's where all these baddies are found.

27:26.693 --> 27:30.395
That's where Metobiota made all of their discoveries.

27:30.455 --> 27:34.637
That's where Peter Daszak are looking for all of their viruses.

27:34.697 --> 27:40.401
And that's also where everyone that discusses and looks for exosomes also looks for their signal.

27:41.212 --> 27:56.174
And it is from this layer of a sucrose gradient that people are then PCR-ing up signals that they say are representative of the whole signal that is somewhere in that fraction, isolated by a sucrose gradient.

27:57.022 --> 27:59.425
And one of the things that's in there is exosomes.

27:59.926 --> 28:11.982
And early in the pandemic, just to narrate this a little bit, you could find videos of Andy Kaufman talking about how virology is a lie because of exosomes, because there are exosomes, because cells

28:12.663 --> 28:30.428
send packet signals of DNA and RNA and we don't really know much about it, it's very hard for anyone to make statements about electron micrographs where they say that they see viral-like particles because we know that there is a preponderance of exosomal signaling thought to be present

28:30.848 --> 28:46.211
both in diseased tissue and healthy tissue and so to look under a microscope and see those structures and then automatically decide that they are coronavirus instead of any number of other things that would expect it to be in that preparation is disingenuous.

28:46.251 --> 28:52.612
And Andy Kaufman was saying that in 2020 and then he stopped somewhere in, I don't know, October or something and never said it again.

28:53.232 --> 28:57.073
Then it just became cellular garbage and they went into this

28:57.893 --> 29:02.235
I don't know, all these theories and all these different models for what happens instead.

29:02.815 --> 29:15.922
And so they offered up all kinds of other false models, insufficient models of what's going on here that sort of don't get you to the finish line.

29:15.962 --> 29:24.006
And at first I didn't understand, but now in retrospect, I really see it, that that's the reason why that whole discussion went away.

29:24.066 --> 29:26.027
But would it just shock you?

29:27.342 --> 29:48.042
if Robert Malone in 2022 would have been on the Glenn Beck program and just said like he said in 2021 that when coronaviruses replicate that the vast majority of the particles like almost all of them are replication incompetent because they have errors or they're incomplete or there was a recombination event that just ended in stunt this

29:49.557 --> 30:05.763
This is all part and parcel for them titrating us to the truth that these illusions exist and the implications of them, including all of the public health measures that we thought were right, all of the illusions about the Human Genome Project.

30:05.783 --> 30:13.846
They're all going to be revealed, but titrated in such a way to control, demolish the American culture or whatever is left of it, where

30:14.386 --> 30:17.548
people don't see each other's color of their skin.

30:17.628 --> 30:31.916
And they are more united because they're wearing the same baseball cap and cheer for the same football team than they are united like they are now by their skin color or some party that they think they're a member of.

30:34.622 --> 30:35.482
So would it surprise you?

30:36.183 --> 30:38.203
We're going to try to do something a little different today.

30:38.223 --> 30:43.045
I want to open up the floor for the people who have been shut out of this incredibly important discussion.

30:43.065 --> 30:43.685
Oh, no, wait.

30:43.985 --> 30:45.346
You, the audience.

30:46.326 --> 30:48.287
We're going to try to squeeze some calls in.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.607
I've got tons of questions from social media.

30:50.627 --> 30:51.768
OK, so I got to go forward here.

30:51.788 --> 30:54.949
I want you to be in the interview seat.

30:54.969 --> 30:57.930
This is the, unfortunately, I guess I put the whole video in here.

30:57.990 --> 30:58.990
So I know where it is.

30:59.050 --> 30:59.670
It's right around 116.

31:00.071 --> 31:02.691
So I'm just going to forward to one hour and 16 in.

31:04.494 --> 31:07.799
And if you want to, I think this video is actually just on YouTube.

31:07.859 --> 31:10.383
So, you know, it's apparently not that dangerous.

31:11.825 --> 31:16.913
And so that should tell you everything you need to know, but I'm going to go to about 115 and put it right here.

31:20.900 --> 31:21.081
use?

31:22.142 --> 31:23.945
Military communications, for sure.

31:24.746 --> 31:33.057
It's, you know, this means unjammable encoded information that can be simultaneous.

31:33.077 --> 31:37.403
The battlefield landscape means to restrict the communications landscape in the modern

31:37.964 --> 32:00.607
battlefield environment right and so that's the the quantum communication has got has got all of us a little bit spooked and they're all over it okay so let's because i got a bunch of questions let's see if we can go rapid fire as much as we can um this is probably one of the bigger questions that we saw over and over and over again um uh vaccine shredding

32:01.448 --> 32:01.928
What is it?

32:02.088 --> 32:03.149
Conspiracy shredding?

32:03.509 --> 32:04.070
Shedding.

32:04.330 --> 32:04.630
Shedding.

32:04.650 --> 32:04.810
Yeah.

32:05.130 --> 32:09.693
Conspiracy theory or real second-hand science?

32:10.554 --> 32:11.354
You love to tell stories.

32:11.394 --> 32:12.595
I'm sorry, I can't ever be brief.

32:12.615 --> 32:13.255
That's all right.

32:14.116 --> 32:18.919
I got called from the UK by a group of men, young men once, about

32:19.739 --> 32:24.047
having sexual intercourse with women that have been vaccinated and they were worried about the shedding story.

32:24.427 --> 32:28.254
And back then I was like, guys, you got a bigger problem than to worry about this.

32:28.574 --> 32:29.015
OK.

32:29.816 --> 32:31.579
And in the spectrum of things to worry about.

32:34.071 --> 32:34.532
What is it?

32:35.113 --> 32:47.506
So the logic is, the concern is that the spike antigen can be transmitted through body fluids or through aerosols to third parties.

32:47.626 --> 32:51.831
So you had this observation of women with their menstrual periods.

32:52.489 --> 32:58.571
where they seem to be being altered when some of them have received vaccination in a group.

32:58.971 --> 33:02.612
The synchronization of menstruation in women is a fascinating thing and it absolutely happens.

33:03.353 --> 33:09.375
The synchronization of women's menstrual cycle is fascinating and it actually happens.

33:09.515 --> 33:11.555
No explanation for how.

33:13.536 --> 33:14.757
It's fascinating though.

33:14.897 --> 33:15.517
Oh my gosh.

33:15.557 --> 33:16.937
I'm so fascinated by it.

33:16.997 --> 33:20.979
That's why I have lots of women living in my house because I love the synchronous synchrony.

33:21.019 --> 33:21.879
It's just so cool.

33:24.855 --> 33:27.497
No explanation, but listen to how he goes on.

33:30.919 --> 33:38.163
So I was of the opinion that this was not likely to be clinically significant.

33:39.184 --> 33:46.028
And the logic was that some of this could be aerosolized by exosomes, which are absolutely secreted in your lung.

33:47.129 --> 34:09.497
exosomes are absolutely secreted in your lung now go figure now doesn't that mean then that if you could get RNA into your lung tissue into your epithelium of your lungs that if they're excreting exosomes anyway if they're releasing exosomes anyway which are lipid coated particles with

34:10.017 --> 34:17.305
genetic information in them, then it wouldn't be crazy if they packaged some of this viral RNA up and released it.

34:17.426 --> 34:22.171
Or maybe just RNA that they were exposed to, you know, like a transfection.

34:24.874 --> 34:27.237
I think it's absolutely remarkable.

34:28.544 --> 34:38.193
that in an hour and 15 minutes into an interview like this, he just randomly throws out there that it definitely, your lungs excrete exosomes.

34:38.233 --> 34:39.974
Well, why in the hell would they do that?

34:41.316 --> 34:53.667
And if my kids were excreting exosomes that encoded something that got me and my immune system a little fired up, would that be like a kind of contagious thing where

34:55.748 --> 35:02.833
Like for a brief period of time, maybe my son can signal to other people's immune system and they might get a runny nose or a cough.

35:03.573 --> 35:10.558
Is it possible that some of those signals could be more contagious than others so that maybe you get two people transmitting?

35:12.299 --> 35:14.541
Would it be ridiculous to think that?

35:14.661 --> 35:15.722
Of course not.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.984
But that's still not RNA pandemicking.

35:21.923 --> 35:38.835
That doesn't erase the fact that the only place where you can make any meaningful quantity of a pure RNA that represents anything that's readable, detectable, quantifiable, and sequenceable, the only way to make that is with artificial means.

35:39.035 --> 35:42.658
You can't dig for it or purify it from the wild with a filter.

35:46.294 --> 35:54.941
And so the illusion needs to be sustained by people who understand its borders intimately, not just kinda.

35:57.443 --> 36:04.870
That's why the no virus position is so dangerous because it is maintained by people who understand its limits.

36:05.945 --> 36:19.431
and make sure to always turn you around in such a way so that you're never actually walking in the direction that will reveal that, oh my gosh, this is just a very tiny little platform of an idea with no connection to anything else.

36:21.171 --> 36:32.376
And in the meantime, these groups of people on television and on social media for the NIH and for DITRA are gonna slowly titrate Americans to the idea that they've been lying about a lot of stuff

36:33.720 --> 36:38.862
without actually usefully questioning what the implications of those lies are.

36:40.202 --> 36:59.989
You know, that they've been stealing or siphoning billions of dollars away from us for decades and funneling it into programs which are essentially all bent on the same thing, which is sort of cracking the genetic code of life on earth and humans in particular.

37:01.053 --> 37:06.718
in a way to change into a new age where they could control our evolution.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.339
And all these people are in on it.

37:08.439 --> 37:16.986
All these people love this idea, or at least want to be a part of the eventual manifestation of this idea, even if it isn't in their generation.

37:17.447 --> 37:22.971
They think they are the smart elite that are elite enough to understand books like this

37:23.692 --> 37:37.626
elite enough to understand how mankind is governed and imagine themselves worthy of sitting at the table that does that governance as we get rid of nation-states, move out of the time of nations.

37:37.706 --> 37:43.511
Ladies and gentlemen, just to kind of give you the kind of hole I've dug for myself here, this is

37:44.392 --> 37:48.636
Teilhard Desjardins with Christianity and Evolution.

37:49.116 --> 37:53.220
This is Teilhard Desjardins with Hymn of the Universe.

37:53.800 --> 37:57.263
This is Desjardins with Man's Place in Nature.

37:57.343 --> 38:01.267
Man's Place in Nature, I think, is the book that starts with the funny beginning.

38:02.808 --> 38:03.629
No, that's not the right one.

38:04.369 --> 38:07.071
Heart of the Matter, another book by Pierre.

38:07.992 --> 38:18.180
Human Energy, interesting title, also by Desjardins, the Jesuit dude that everybody thinks is a genius, except for the church during his day.

38:18.700 --> 38:25.526
The Future of Man, which is also an interesting book, and I think maybe more interesting than The Phenomenon of Man.

38:26.426 --> 38:32.111
And Building the Earth, and Building the Earth is the one that starts out with a very interesting, whoops, sorry,

38:32.651 --> 38:33.971
Very interesting poem.

38:36.972 --> 38:45.634
And that poem is, the age of nations is past, the task before us now, if we would not perish, is to build the earth.

38:46.174 --> 38:56.256
And when we're talking about the earth with these people, what we're talking about is this collective consciousness, this world culture, which will eventually morph into a kind of world religion,

38:56.876 --> 39:07.520
where we worship the sun or creation or something like that and their creator becomes this amorphous thing that manifests in individual people or something like that.

39:08.921 --> 39:10.701
And I don't like this idea.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.342
I don't like this idea at all.

39:13.382 --> 39:16.083
It feels very, very wrong and inverted.

39:17.004 --> 39:22.886
And it's starting to freak me out a little bit that so many of these people seem to be cooperating on this particular tip.

39:24.249 --> 39:25.952
And that's what frightens me a lot.

39:25.972 --> 39:30.922
So here, if we resume his- So that was what people were talking about.

39:32.284 --> 39:35.671
There are these really odd observations of breast

39:36.084 --> 39:38.405
feeding babies in adverse events.

39:40.046 --> 39:42.848
And so I thought all of this was just noise.

39:43.388 --> 39:48.251
And then this cell paper came out showing this high level of spike protein expression.

39:49.051 --> 39:52.033
And now I've had to revise my position.

39:52.113 --> 39:56.275
So where I'm at right now is that it is technically possible.

39:57.036 --> 40:03.820
So where he's at right now, a year after he came out and claimed to be the authority on these technologies,

40:04.935 --> 40:15.581
A year after he came out on the Brett Weinstein podcast and started the Unity Project and advised the FLCCC in 2020, all this stuff has happened.

40:16.262 --> 40:29.010
And in 2022, he's now had to revise his stance on the potential for exosomes to carry a transfected protein out into the environment and potentially expose other people to it.

40:29.790 --> 40:45.180
And since we know that exosomes are produced by other tissues, that's the reason why Pfizer in their documents had within these transfections a warning of not to have sex with anybody because of course it could be in your sweat, in your vaginal secretions, in your semen, this kind of thing.

40:45.520 --> 40:51.323
And so this discussion here should be evidence for you that this is just a titration.

40:51.704 --> 40:55.226
Are you really willing to believe that in 2020 he didn't know that?

40:56.604 --> 41:03.807
when he claims simultaneously that he lost or gave up or just, you know, gave up on these patents already years ago.

41:06.207 --> 41:10.049
But he knows all about them and he still holds the patent for genetic vaccines.

41:10.089 --> 41:12.990
Are you really willing to believe that in 2020 he didn't know this?

41:13.848 --> 41:15.529
That in 2021, he didn't know it.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.392
And that in 2022, he's just figuring it out.

41:18.492 --> 41:28.540
The same way that you're willing to believe that he innocently started the domain server with Ditra and innocently identified four repurposed drugs, including ivermectin.

41:29.421 --> 41:45.022
innocently tried to push for clinical trials on these drugs and published papers and took money because he really just wanted to help people until he finally realized they were going to roll out transfections and then in 2021 he still didn't understand so he took one no wait two

41:46.024 --> 41:55.210
that he then forgot to bring his vaccine card to Rome with him when he went there with Stephen Hadfield, who's about to be mentioned right now.

41:55.631 --> 42:04.377
And in 2022, he's just figuring out that sometimes transfection results in protein expression and those proteins can be shed by exosomes.

42:05.258 --> 42:05.958
Stop lying.

42:06.979 --> 42:08.280
Stop lying.

42:11.889 --> 42:18.918
and in a variety of body fluids, and we don't need to go down that list on a G-rated show.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.480
I think we got it.

42:21.141 --> 42:25.466
But the studies must be done now.

42:25.847 --> 42:26.487
That's my opinion.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.369
and they are technically possible.

42:29.429 --> 42:30.349
But isn't that cool?

42:30.409 --> 42:32.050
The studies must be done now.

42:32.150 --> 42:47.177
So, you know, it's too bad really that we needed these studies because the human genome product realized that we weren't going to learn jack until we had access to and the ability to genetically manipulate

42:47.777 --> 42:49.558
some humans and then see what happens.

42:49.618 --> 42:52.981
Because when we do it in mice, we're not learning anything for ourselves.

42:53.001 --> 42:55.283
When we do it in inbred mice, we learn even less.

42:55.323 --> 42:56.804
I mean, Bret Weinstein knows that.

42:57.224 --> 43:07.492
So this is the magnificent illusion that needs breaking, that these people, rather than titrating us slowly to the truth and getting us to inadvertently accept that the U.S.

43:07.532 --> 43:11.175
just needs to be controlled, demolished, because we're just 40 years of bad country,

43:12.406 --> 43:27.098
Instead of us trying to fight to take back our country, to reorganize our schools, to reorganize our communities, they want us to acquiesce to this idea that, well, America might as well just be burnt down to the studs, and we might as well just, you know, maybe we can organize under the UN.

43:30.141 --> 43:36.546
...able to be done, and it's on this long list of stuff that ought to be being done and isn't.

43:37.352 --> 43:41.714
What is your thought on pediatric vaccines?

43:42.414 --> 43:48.256
Oh, well, that's been a bedrock position of mine all the way along, which is no.

43:48.536 --> 43:48.716
Yeah.

43:48.916 --> 43:50.197
The risk benefit ratio.

43:50.417 --> 43:56.879
And so keep in mind that they're choosing the language very carefully.

43:58.649 --> 44:01.632
Glenn said, what is your position on childhood vaccines?

44:01.672 --> 44:03.073
And that was pretty gray, right?

44:03.113 --> 44:07.877
Because there were people that were against the childhood vaccine schedule before the pandemic.

44:08.137 --> 44:10.760
Vaxxed, the movie, came out before the pandemic.

44:11.260 --> 44:13.662
Vaxxed 2 came out before the pandemic.

44:13.702 --> 44:16.485
CHD formed a few years before the pandemic.

44:17.165 --> 44:21.069
Mary Holland took control of CHD a couple years before the pandemic.

44:21.089 --> 44:22.570
Do you see what I'm trying to get at here?

44:29.727 --> 44:32.892
This completely upside down, particularly for mandated.

44:34.962 --> 44:40.687
There is the possible exception of those children that are at very high risk for death.

44:41.027 --> 44:41.728
Who does he mention?

44:41.748 --> 44:47.652
Basically, as my friend Hatfield put it rather bluntly the other day, these are kids that are going to die anyhow.

44:49.314 --> 44:52.396
So, you know, advanced cancers, advanced cystitis.

44:52.436 --> 45:00.123
Now remember, Stephen Hatfield in 2020 was on TV and on podcasts telling people that they should wear a rubber apron.

45:00.763 --> 45:06.591
if they go into the room with their kid and their kid is positive for COVID, a rubber apron.

45:07.792 --> 45:12.098
And that when you come into the house, it might be a good idea to take all of your clothes off in the garage.

45:17.609 --> 45:21.030
Steven Hatfield, the guy who's been on the Tommy podcast a few times.

45:21.070 --> 45:41.698
Steven Hatfield, the guy who was on stage in November of 2023 with Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jill Glasspool Malone and Nick Hudson and Steven Hatfield and Denny Rancor, Jessica Rose, Brett Weinstein in Romania for whatever COVID summit that was.

45:41.778 --> 45:42.058
Four?

45:42.959 --> 45:43.319
Five?

45:43.919 --> 45:44.259
I don't know.

45:44.859 --> 45:46.580
The sixth one just happened in Japan.

45:48.035 --> 45:49.548
all the same people decided to go.

45:53.755 --> 45:56.277
I don't know, maybe I'll try this again to see if there's anything more.

45:56.297 --> 45:57.799
Cystic fibrosis, things like that.

45:57.959 --> 46:13.333
So for healthy children, there is no justification for these genetic vaccines in that the logs on that fire are getting more and more and it's going higher.

46:13.793 --> 46:17.116
More and more and going higher and higher is titrating.

46:17.296 --> 46:18.798
He could have told us this in 2020.

46:20.399 --> 46:25.984
He could have told us in 2021 when he was on the Brett Weinstein podcast with Steve Kirsch and he didn't.

46:26.124 --> 46:28.926
And he's still not really saying it here in this video in 2022.

46:29.927 --> 46:44.820
So what you need to see is this emu breeder, horse dealer, horse dress up guy, consultant and private contractor for Ditra.

46:47.509 --> 46:50.611
Long time consultant for the WHO and the DOD.

46:54.214 --> 46:55.895
This guy is not saving us.

46:55.975 --> 46:58.217
This guy is not saving Bobby Kennedy.

46:58.277 --> 47:00.939
This guy's not informing Bobby Kennedy usefully.

47:01.099 --> 47:10.767
If Merrill Nass is cooperating with him to fool Bobby Kennedy about me, then we are in big trouble, but also very close.

47:15.811 --> 47:18.412
And that's why I'm always banging on this door.

47:18.492 --> 47:26.075
It's not because I don't like this guy, because this is the only thing standing between me and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:26.095 --> 47:27.336
If Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:27.356 --> 47:42.962
were to just sit down with me and Robert Malone over breakfast at Denny's, by the end of the pancakes on my plate, Robert Malone would have shot at me like Greedo and Han Solo on the table.

47:44.143 --> 47:44.863
It would have been over.

47:46.257 --> 47:48.858
because that's the only solution in that scenario.

47:48.918 --> 47:50.658
We can't have a conversation.

47:53.379 --> 48:01.101
And when we were offered a conversation on the Defender podcast, it was necessary for me not to present for more than seven minutes.

48:01.602 --> 48:12.465
And then Robert Malone, Meryl Nass, Jessica Rose, and Tess Laurie were the audience, and also Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the audience that discussed my seven-minute presentation.

48:13.717 --> 48:15.440
which at the time was pretty baller.

48:16.021 --> 48:17.603
Like it was pretty spot on.

48:19.466 --> 48:21.549
And he 100% ignored it.

48:21.609 --> 48:23.172
Merrill 100% ignored it.

48:24.053 --> 48:27.078
Tess Laurie was confused and Jessica Rose had nothing to say.

48:30.816 --> 48:44.939
We are very close, ladies and gentlemen, to a serious, serious upsetting of their apple cart if we can get this information to somebody of consequence.

48:45.019 --> 48:48.720
Now, it doesn't mean that in the end, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

48:48.800 --> 48:55.801
is going to succeed in saving us or that he's going to turn into the good guy that we always hoped he would be.

48:56.181 --> 48:58.702
And the same thing is not necessarily true for Trump.

49:00.080 --> 49:14.488
But the point would be that at a certain moment, at a certain threshold of understanding, at a certain point when everybody starts to, the common knowledge of Robert Malone's role in this starts to become so overwhelming that they can no longer refer to him.

49:15.049 --> 49:22.453
And that anybody that did refer to him is in sort of immediate state of, you know, location of dubiousness.

49:23.720 --> 49:24.761
That would be wonderful.

49:24.901 --> 49:36.709
Can you imagine if anybody that associated with Sasha Latapova was immediately associated with Soph and Alex Jones and all of that history that everybody wants to ignore?

49:40.011 --> 49:50.339
Because then anybody that was promoting Sasha Latapova would become incredibly dubious because wait a minute, none of these people have lost anything.

49:50.419 --> 49:52.280
None of these people have risked anything.

49:53.899 --> 50:05.441
Can you imagine that Sasha Latupova's daughter lost her million subscriber YouTube channel just before the pandemic because she threatened to kill the YouTube CEO?

50:07.250 --> 50:09.952
And that's what's got her on Alex Jones.

50:10.732 --> 50:24.021
And you want to believe that just at the same time it's a coinkydink that now she was on stage with Robert Malone in Sweden, and on stage with Meryl Nass in Sweden, and on stage with Asim Malhotra in Sweden?

50:25.702 --> 50:27.123
That's not possible.

50:30.091 --> 50:47.539
Any more than it is possible that Jay Bhattacharya has been talking to me yearly and monthly sometimes for the past couple years and insists that he's just not sophisticated enough to evaluate my biology and has told me several times in person to my face to leave Robert Malone alone.

50:48.719 --> 50:57.163
And now just very recently on the Dr. Drew show, the mother of Soph,

50:58.675 --> 51:05.438
and Jay Bhattacharya discussed this stuff and self-replicating RNA or something like that.

51:07.139 --> 51:18.343
We are at a crucial moment where everybody who has the guts to just look for a second and open your eyes and whatever you see there, you just process it.

51:19.484 --> 51:22.405
If you just open your eyes, you can see them right now.

51:24.315 --> 51:32.142
And so we can put them in a situation where either they're gonna have to admit that they're working together or ignore us and then admit that they're working together.

51:33.323 --> 51:39.449
Or someone's gonna have to publicly come out and say, oh my gosh, these people fooled me and be like me.

51:40.717 --> 51:57.447
not necessarily promoting me, I don't care, but they would be realized that the right thing to do was to turn on these people, to turn on these orchestrators of the narrative, these people who were put in place on social media that are in place right now that are being used to push Donald Trump into the White House.

51:57.868 --> 52:08.894
Maybe they're just demonstrating to Donald Trump how powerful they are, how much control they can have and how much influence they can have so that when he gets the presidency, they can have more influence than the other people behind the scenes.

52:09.115 --> 52:09.535
I don't know.

52:11.135 --> 52:20.702
But I know right now for sure that something besides a spontaneous group of people coming to our rescue in hopes to free our grandchildren is happening right now.

52:20.762 --> 52:22.583
That is so far from the truth.

52:26.826 --> 52:27.667
Go higher and higher.

52:30.717 --> 52:31.917
And so we have this list.

52:31.997 --> 52:35.559
I strongly recommend that you go to Paul Alexander's sub stack.

52:35.619 --> 52:37.339
I guess you have to subscribe to read it.

52:37.399 --> 52:40.601
If that's true, then you have to send him an email and tell him how stupid that is.

52:41.661 --> 52:49.244
But he's he's promoting the UK doctor's presentation, which you can find on PeerTube and watch and on my Twitch and watch.

52:50.404 --> 53:04.909
And it will be a sub stack very soon where we we talk about these questions and why they're important And so I encourage you to go check that out So let's just watch a couple videos here to make sure that we understand what's going on this one You've seen a couple times now.

53:04.949 --> 53:05.469
This is Steve

53:05.629 --> 53:07.931
are safe and effective, you should go get yours.

53:07.951 --> 53:11.113
Because that's not what the news media should be doing.

53:11.453 --> 53:22.462
They should be reporting on what's actually happening and pointing out to people that side effects do occur and that they should always, before getting any medical intervention, understand the risks and the benefits.

53:22.862 --> 53:35.407
Now, for all vaccines, it turns out that the, except in extremely rare cases, like, you know, maybe this one might have been a case, but I really don't think so.

53:36.467 --> 53:44.991
In pretty much every case I know about, the benefits of vaccination never outweigh the risk, and people should always be refusing vaccination.

53:45.011 --> 53:47.632
We've been telling people that for a long time.

53:47.652 --> 53:49.292
Okay, so you do that and people don't listen.

53:49.352 --> 53:50.773
Nobody should ever take another vaccine.

53:52.397 --> 53:55.660
No, people should not take any of the vaccine.

53:55.740 --> 54:17.697
And so you see the language chosen is on purpose vague so that the previous criminal vaccine schedule, the lack of strict liability, and the difference between the vaccine schedule in America, both in quantity and in calendar, between America and the rest of the Western world,

54:18.846 --> 54:34.624
is never brought up by any of these people, yet these are the most succinct and biologically relevant pieces of evidence to show that the vaccine schedule in America is particularly criminal and may be evidence that all vaccine schedules in the Western world are essentially criminal.

54:36.704 --> 54:44.571
But nobody, nobody from another country is able to say it and rise in the media and for me to see.

54:45.112 --> 54:48.936
Nobody in America that is promoted by any of these people is actually saying it.

54:49.636 --> 54:55.542
And here, Stu Peters is trying to say it, but of course, Stu Peters discredits himself for a million other reasons.

54:58.479 --> 55:02.504
and by promoting a million other people without enough scrutiny to know.

55:02.584 --> 55:08.571
So even if he gets it right in the presence of Steve Kirsch, the net result is not good.

55:12.950 --> 55:14.551
vaccines that are currently approved.

55:14.951 --> 55:20.533
There may be a time, Stu, in five years from now, that they actually have a safe vaccine.

55:20.653 --> 55:21.053
No, there won't.

55:21.153 --> 55:22.334
We can't rule that out.

55:22.634 --> 55:24.555
And that's why Bobby Kennedy says he's not anti-vaccine.

55:24.575 --> 55:27.696
They make billions and billions of dollars off of every one of these shots.

55:27.756 --> 55:31.317
So that's why he says that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:31.357 --> 55:32.418
is not anti-vaccine.

55:34.159 --> 55:35.139
There may be a time.

55:37.079 --> 55:39.960
Now, do you think that that's a rare opinion?

55:41.320 --> 55:44.821
Is that not Steve Kirsch speaking for this entire crew?

55:44.881 --> 55:45.801
Because I think it is.

55:46.242 --> 55:47.922
He's speaking for Brett Weinstein.

55:47.962 --> 55:49.562
He's speaking for Robert Malone.

55:49.582 --> 55:52.543
He's speaking on behalf of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:52.583 --> 55:58.125
He's speaking on behalf of all of these doctors who wouldn't question vaccines for real.

55:58.225 --> 55:59.805
Like, not the technology.

56:01.586 --> 56:04.787
Not the technology or the idea of vaccines, of course.

56:04.847 --> 56:05.567
It's brilliant.

56:06.502 --> 56:12.487
It's just that the actual manifestation of the idea has been imperfect.

56:21.355 --> 56:23.197
And so that's what I see in this video.

56:23.297 --> 56:26.960
I see extremely rare cases like this one.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.485
It might've been okay for the old people means that he's fine with what they did.

56:32.503 --> 56:34.824
It's just unfortunate that they made some mistakes.

56:35.385 --> 56:45.590
And we're not talking about the old vaccine schedule, even though, of course, Steve has done lots of stuff on X, where he's talked about unvaccinated kids.

56:45.931 --> 56:47.531
He's talked about the Amish.

56:48.172 --> 56:50.053
And so it's not like he doesn't know.

56:50.813 --> 57:00.659
So you can even see more of how he's a liar, because if you go onto his Twitter and look over the last couple months, you can see him talking about the Amish and they don't have any,

57:01.219 --> 57:02.280
They don't have any problems.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.742
And talking about unvaccinated kids, because they don't have any problems.

57:06.062 --> 57:13.327
And yet here, when Stu Peters gives him a chance, tees it up, go ahead, hit it out of the park, he qualified it instantly.

57:14.327 --> 57:20.551
And qualified it in exactly the same way that the owner of X qualified it on Tucker Carlson.

57:21.312 --> 57:25.854
I think it's fair to say, even if I hated it, I would say this because it's true, it's been pivotal in American politics.

57:25.955 --> 57:27.155
Yeah.

57:27.235 --> 57:28.296
And in American society.

57:30.291 --> 57:35.436
Do you think they could shut you down if the Democrats continue to hold power?

57:36.077 --> 57:37.198
They will unequivocally try.

57:37.698 --> 57:37.918
Yeah.

57:38.379 --> 57:42.142
Yeah.

57:43.083 --> 57:55.115
And if they get a majority in the Senate and House and the presidency, then they can simply pass a law and delete Section 230.

57:57.583 --> 58:07.308
Simply make us liable for what anyone says on a platform with, at this point, almost 600 million monthly active users.

58:07.929 --> 58:16.974
I mean, okay, I don't want to be too much of a shit, but I have never met an extremely intelligent person who can't talk.

58:18.154 --> 58:22.837
And one of the things that really bugs me about Elon Musk is that he can't talk.

58:24.212 --> 58:32.738
He can't put a coherent sentence together ever, nevermind a couple, three in a row that you're like, wow, that guy's a wizard.

58:33.358 --> 58:34.359
It just doesn't happen.

58:35.500 --> 58:44.145
It's actually quite miraculous how little good footage you can find of this guy sounding smart.

58:44.265 --> 58:46.127
It's always just an average guy.

58:46.467 --> 58:50.770
This is no different than a dude you might meet at the bar, no pun intended and no insult meant.

58:52.751 --> 59:05.337
But we're supposed to believe that because of his massive genius, you know, like the size of a hot air balloon, his massive genius is why he has this massive pile of wealth and all these massively successful companies.

59:07.859 --> 59:08.919
And that's an illusion.

59:10.580 --> 59:19.965
That is a governance lie that is being perpetuated by him and his rich buddies that are using social media like X and Locals and Telegram

59:21.638 --> 59:33.508
to better control groups of people, to keep people separate, swimming in separate little schools of thought, little limited spectrum of debate here and there and everywhere.

59:33.548 --> 59:39.053
And no matter which one you bounce around in, you're never gonna come to the conclusion that you're still not out.

59:39.113 --> 59:43.856
You're gonna at some point feel comfortable that you've found people that are fighting for what you fighting for.

59:43.917 --> 59:47.720
And that's, that's the end.

59:48.717 --> 59:50.398
And that's what these people are doing.

59:50.438 --> 59:55.380
That's what Tucker's helping him do, because they all want to be on the team that's governing us.

59:55.460 --> 59:57.481
They all want to be on the ruler's team.

59:57.541 --> 59:58.301
Of course you do.

59:58.962 --> 01:00:03.143
Once you know there are only two teams, you definitely want to be on their team.

01:00:04.044 --> 01:00:05.985
That's why there are no choices here.

01:00:06.105 --> 01:00:12.668
That's why it's as diverse as Peter McCullough all the way to Elon Musk, because they all want to be on this team.

01:00:13.536 --> 01:00:19.139
And nobody that's in front of us right now and active on stage is actually paying for the show.

01:00:19.539 --> 01:00:19.959
Nobody.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.362
Those people that are running it for real are not visible to us.

01:00:27.342 --> 01:00:29.883
You can just call them the overclass or something like that.

01:00:29.903 --> 01:00:39.848
And Elon Musk is one of the few public facing representatives of the overclass, but the overclass is very difficult to identify on purpose.

01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:42.955
Yeah.

01:00:42.975 --> 01:00:43.675
Which is impossible.

01:00:44.756 --> 01:00:49.397
That's like trying to regulate speech in a country.

01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:51.737
Yeah, a big country.

01:00:51.757 --> 01:00:53.537
Yeah, you'd just be instantly bankrupt.

01:00:54.398 --> 01:01:05.000
And so if he had to regulate free speech on his platform or he had to control it on his platform, it would bankrupt him because it's so many users and it's just so difficult.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.121
And so the illusion, the enchantment that they're casting here right now is that this thing is so big

01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:15.555
that the, you know, they can barely understand how the AI works.

01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:21.418
And it's just this big, you know, giant fireball of smoke and lightning that's going like this.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.039
And they can just barely hold on.

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:29.143
And every once in a while, they send a programmer in there to tweak something, but then they got to pull them out quick before he gets ground up by it.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:40.180
And so they want you to believe that Twitter or X is this conglomeration of thinking and actively interacting people.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:48.986
And that for the most part, Elon is just making it easier for these people to interact and trying as best he can for the best ideas to rise up.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:59.711
take control of those best ideas to profit from them, or take control of those ideas to make sure that they never became something that would make people break out of this control mechanism.

01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:02.992
He would never do anything like that with any of this data.

01:02:03.012 --> 01:02:06.674
He's just trying to facilitate free speech.

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:14.257
And Tucker wants you to believe that.

01:02:15.457 --> 01:02:17.178
Brett Weinstein wants you to believe that.

01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:19.359
Alexandros Mernos wants you to believe that.

01:02:22.745 --> 01:02:25.909
All of these Elon Musk fans want you to believe that.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:37.181
That this very average intelligence guy is capable of running all these very incredible companies with all these very incredible lofty goals.

01:02:43.203 --> 01:02:49.890
And it has nothing to do with military contracts, nothing to do with military technologies, nothing to do with any of that.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.953
It's just all stuff that him and his engineers pull out of their head.

01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:59.720
But I bet they wouldn't withdraw legal immunity from the vaccine makers at the same time, would they?

01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:00.561
No.

01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:02.303
That's unlikely.

01:03:04.431 --> 01:03:07.312
Just, I mean, as long as we're withdrawing legal liability protection.

01:03:07.652 --> 01:03:20.618
So the legal liability protection for social media is now being equated to the legal liability that pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines are also protected by.

01:03:21.318 --> 01:03:22.179
It's an equivalence.

01:03:22.759 --> 01:03:31.643
But they're willing to take away the strict liability of, or they're willing to impose strict liability on

01:03:33.385 --> 01:03:37.529
social media, but not impose strict liability on vaccines.

01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:39.131
Did they say strict liability?

01:03:39.171 --> 01:03:40.812
Did you hear strict liability?

01:03:40.912 --> 01:03:47.259
I don't think they said that, even though that would technically be the legal term for it in America.

01:03:47.379 --> 01:03:49.621
That's unlikely.

01:03:51.755 --> 01:03:54.677
Just, I mean, as long as we're withdrawing legal liability protection.

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.579
Oh, legal liability protection.

01:03:57.639 --> 01:03:58.399
Is that what it is?

01:03:58.419 --> 01:03:59.400
Oops, sorry.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.061
Is that what that is?

01:04:01.161 --> 01:04:02.722
Legal liability protection?

01:04:02.762 --> 01:04:07.685
Because I'm not really sure that's the way it would be phrased if you were a lawyer.

01:04:08.366 --> 01:04:12.348
I'm not sure that's what you would write in a court document.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.411
And do you see why that's important?

01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:19.513
Because if you don't use the right words,

01:04:20.376 --> 01:04:25.918
to evoke the right idea or the right concept, then people will never connect the dots.

01:04:26.698 --> 01:04:36.262
And it'll feel like you're connecting the dots because he said liability, but the term in legal ease is strict liability.

01:04:38.047 --> 01:04:39.688
or indemnification, right?

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:46.472
They're indemnified from the requirement.

01:04:46.512 --> 01:04:50.354
So there are words that they could use and they're not using them, that's my point.

01:04:51.474 --> 01:04:52.895
Yeah, a big country.

01:04:52.935 --> 01:04:54.716
Yeah, it'd just be instantly bankrupt.

01:04:57.497 --> 01:05:01.480
But I bet they wouldn't withdraw legal immunity from the vaccine makers at the same time, would they?

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.041
No, that's unlikely.

01:05:06.158 --> 01:05:09.041
Just, I mean, as long as we're withdrawing legal liability protection.

01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:10.222
Yeah.

01:05:10.422 --> 01:05:12.684
Yeah, I mean, the whole vaccine debate is a long one.

01:05:14.326 --> 01:05:16.668
You know, I'm not actually, I'm not anti-vaccine in general.

01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:29.460
I think we want to exercise caution with use of vaccines, but in the absence of vaccines, there'll be a lot more, I think, people that have died.

01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:31.782
Does he sound convinced to you?

01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:43.741
He laughs like that guy, that dude with the glasses in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

01:05:45.964 --> 01:05:48.387
This is absolutely absurd.

01:05:49.485 --> 01:05:52.987
He doesn't even know really how to say it because he knows it's a lie.

01:05:53.047 --> 01:06:11.179
So it comes out awkward and it comes out without real, real good by, I mean, this is a guy who supposedly has enough biological background to build a surgical robot that can implant a, a chip in your head, which will allow you to access basically all the input and output of your brain.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.060
That's what he says.

01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:18.224
He's also a guy who can head up a company that can, can make reusable rockets.

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:23.136
He's also a guy who can head up a company that can dig really deep tunnels.

01:06:24.137 --> 01:06:30.780
And also he's a guy who heads up a company that can make really great electric cars that are just so badass he made an electric truck too.

01:06:32.581 --> 01:06:41.785
And it's all being done despite nobody's helping him, despite that the government doesn't give any contracts away, that there's no government funding.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.745
I can do it anyway.

01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:46.367
Despite the regulation, I can do it because I'm so good.

01:06:48.223 --> 01:06:50.364
That's what we're supposed to believe with this guy.

01:06:55.607 --> 01:06:57.528
You know, like we want the smallpox vaccine.

01:06:57.548 --> 01:06:58.229
That was a good one.

01:06:58.449 --> 01:06:59.029
Oh, we want?

01:06:59.169 --> 01:06:59.630
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:00.450
Smallpox will kill you.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.111
Smallpox will kill you.

01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:04.032
It's funny because I've got a book.

01:07:04.452 --> 01:07:08.615
I've got a couple books from the early 1900s that don't talk about smallpox killing you.

01:07:11.016 --> 01:07:17.760
Smallpox will kill you, says the rocket ship, electric car, tunneling.

01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:22.486
battery RNA guy.

01:07:22.886 --> 01:07:25.568
Don't forget that he's got an RNA factory too, kids.

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:29.972
Don't forget that he's got an RNA factory too, children.

01:07:31.993 --> 01:07:33.234
What is going on here?

01:07:33.254 --> 01:07:35.836
Killed a lot of people.

01:07:35.856 --> 01:07:36.837
It killed a lot of people.

01:07:36.857 --> 01:07:40.279
It used to be people would like... It was a good one, yeah.

01:07:40.299 --> 01:07:41.560
Yeah, yeah, smallpox will kill you.

01:07:42.761 --> 01:07:43.422
Killed a lot of people.

01:07:43.442 --> 01:07:44.422
It killed a lot of people.

01:07:44.442 --> 01:07:46.324
It used to be people would like...

01:07:47.362 --> 01:07:50.746
A lot of people would die of smallpox and a lot of people would get polio.

01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:51.928
For sure.

01:07:52.128 --> 01:07:52.328
Yeah.

01:07:52.348 --> 01:07:54.171
We had a president who had polio.

01:07:54.551 --> 01:08:01.359
Can you imagine the possibility that Elon Musk is actually unaware that we don't give the smallpox vaccine anymore?

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:08.331
He just said that if we didn't have the smallpox vaccine, people would be dying of smallpox, not would have died.

01:08:08.972 --> 01:08:10.653
Not that smallpox is gone.

01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:11.674
He didn't say that.

01:08:11.714 --> 01:08:14.016
We didn't, because we got rid of smallpox.

01:08:14.036 --> 01:08:15.418
We haven't gotten rid of polio.

01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:18.981
If he understood that biology, don't you think that's what he should have said?

01:08:19.842 --> 01:08:22.124
And yet, if you listen carefully, that's not what he said.

01:08:22.144 --> 01:08:24.626
He's talking about vaccines as if he doesn't even know.

01:08:26.127 --> 01:08:28.968
A lot of people would die of smallpox and a lot of people would get polio.

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:30.109
For sure.

01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.529
Yeah.

01:08:30.549 --> 01:08:32.850
We had a president who had polio.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:36.312
A lot of people would die of smallpox and a lot of people would get polio.

01:08:37.092 --> 01:08:37.472
For sure.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:37.892
Yeah.

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:39.733
We had a president who had polio.

01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:41.034
Oh, yeah.

01:08:41.214 --> 01:08:46.096
You meet people today in their 80s who were limping from childhood polio.

01:08:46.176 --> 01:08:47.217
Boy, they sound convinced.

01:08:47.237 --> 01:08:48.997
People would get polio vaccine.

01:08:49.017 --> 01:08:49.638
That was a good one.

01:08:49.818 --> 01:08:50.558
It seems a good one, yeah.

01:08:50.598 --> 01:08:51.018
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:51.058 --> 01:08:51.839
Smallpox will kill you.

01:08:53.079 --> 01:08:53.719
Killed a lot of people.

01:08:53.739 --> 01:08:54.700
It killed a lot of people.

01:08:56.661 --> 01:09:01.046
A lot of people would die of smallpox, and a lot of people would get polio.

01:09:01.847 --> 01:09:02.228
For sure.

01:09:02.448 --> 01:09:02.668
Yeah.

01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:04.470
The president had polio.

01:09:05.411 --> 01:09:06.353
Oh, yeah.

01:09:06.573 --> 01:09:10.898
You meet people today in their 80s who were limping from childhood polio.

01:09:11.278 --> 01:09:12.620
I just want to be very clear.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.881
Solar fire, nine.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:24.741
If you are very smart and having a genius for assembling business schemes and spending other people's money, that's not a good enough explanation, and I'll tell you why.

01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:44.308
Because even someone who's good at assembling business schemes and spending other people's money should not be able to get away with dressing up as Satan's first lieutenant with leather armor and an upside down black cross and baphomet on his chest.

01:09:46.485 --> 01:09:50.448
That should be kind of like, okay, you're not really the businessman you said you were.

01:09:50.488 --> 01:09:51.769
It just should be a full pop.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:10:00.837
No, no different than Greg Glassman when he tweeted Floyd 19 and everybody got all mad because, Oh, that's not cool, man.

01:10:01.337 --> 01:10:02.418
Floyd 19.

01:10:03.819 --> 01:10:10.265
That's how Greg Glassman lost his franchise CrossFit was because he tweeted Floyd 19 when everybody was losing their mind.

01:10:10.325 --> 01:10:13.988
And this mind loss was spreading around the United States.

01:10:14.028 --> 01:10:15.389
I think it's a pretty clever tweet.

01:10:19.355 --> 01:10:24.459
That was one example of censorship on Twitter in the beginning.

01:10:26.381 --> 01:10:32.486
And so what we're dealing with here, ladies and gentlemen, is a big show with witting and unwitting participants.

01:10:32.546 --> 01:10:36.409
People are aware that they're being played and people that are not aware they're being played.

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.972
When I first got called by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:45.156
and offered a job consulting on that book, I thought it was the greatest day of my adult life.

01:10:47.301 --> 01:10:58.926
And as I explained in my first red pill presentation, I dropped on the ground to my knees in the mud and was like in tears, because I thought, oh my gosh, I actually broke through.

01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:09.391
And for a long time, I unwittingly fought on that team and played with that team, thinking that, OK, I'm not going to criticize everything they do.

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:10.551
I'm not going to speak out about it.

01:11:10.571 --> 01:11:13.012
I'm not going to get angry about everything, because at least I've got a job.

01:11:13.052 --> 01:11:14.333
At least I'm working for people.

01:11:16.383 --> 01:11:17.644
and somebody's listening to me.

01:11:19.265 --> 01:11:32.935
And now we're five years in and these same people are still there saying they're listening, saying they hear it, saying that they're fighting for the same things that they've been fighting for the last 10 years, but unable to explain why they haven't been able to make any progress.

01:11:33.935 --> 01:11:43.502
That actually Elon Musk now says the same thing that a lot of these people were saying 10 years ago, including Mary Holland when she was on Democracy Now in 2015.

01:11:45.578 --> 01:11:56.376
the same year that Peter Daszak and Shengxi Li published their paper about some kind of chimeric virus that they tested that's even better than SARS-1.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:03.153
It's all one big show, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:03.173 --> 01:12:19.162
And once you can see it and put this in context, I think it's possible for anyone to lower a ladder to their friends and their family and help them get out without insults and without anger, but just questions like, what in the hell explains this?

01:12:25.601 --> 01:12:28.962
It's good that we don't have that, and vaccines played a major role in that.

01:12:30.362 --> 01:12:32.623
So that doesn't mean that vaccines should not have any scrutiny.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:41.005
Of course we should be making sure that the quality control of vaccines is incredibly good, if we're giving them to children and whatnot.

01:12:41.965 --> 01:12:44.126
And we shouldn't force people to take vaccines.

01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:51.742
That itself is a controversial statement that we shouldn't force people.

01:12:52.283 --> 01:12:53.543
We shouldn't force people to take vaccines.

01:12:53.623 --> 01:13:02.726
We shouldn't force people to take vaccines is precisely, precisely what was accomplished and the message was in 2015.

01:13:03.426 --> 01:13:05.767
It is exactly the message.

01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:14.031
Even the movie Vaxxed really isn't the message that they are killing people, we need to stop all vaccines in America.

01:13:14.051 --> 01:13:17.251
The message was, they're not tested, they're lying.

01:13:23.213 --> 01:13:23.753
What did he say?

01:13:28.814 --> 01:13:32.355
That itself is a controversial statement, that we shouldn't force people.

01:13:32.895 --> 01:13:34.075
We shouldn't force people to take vaccines.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:41.191
So talking about whether they should be mandated was also what we fought about in 2020.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:44.033
Remember, we spent a whole year, there were lawsuits about it.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:48.255
And in fact, CHD even filed a lawsuit about the mandate.

01:13:49.436 --> 01:13:55.499
But there were lawyers all over the world that could have told you that that mandate won't hold, it won't hold in the military, it won't hold anywhere else.

01:13:55.579 --> 01:14:04.524
But these people feigned as though it was necessary to take people to court, pretended that the order was real.

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:07.858
And to a certain extent it was, right?

01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:09.939
Because there's a chain of command that has to follow.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:18.785
And so again, is it the fault of the, should the military, the heads of the military been like, no, we're not going to do this because this is a bad idea.

01:14:21.407 --> 01:14:22.368
When they were given orders.

01:14:25.657 --> 01:14:26.918
I believe in freedom.

01:14:27.178 --> 01:14:29.439
Yeah, I've noticed.

01:14:29.539 --> 01:14:35.781
America's supposed to be the land of liberty.

01:14:35.841 --> 01:14:41.243
Make no mistake about it, this is a foreigner cooperating with an American like so many times is happening here.

01:14:42.324 --> 01:14:46.946
We really don't have an American leader, you know, like somebody who's American.

01:14:47.146 --> 01:14:48.426
We have to have this guy.

01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:49.907
Really?

01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:54.966
The guy who dresses up as the devil's general for Halloween.

01:14:55.567 --> 01:14:58.630
The guy who names his kids funny names.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.992
The guy who, I mean, come on.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.621
Freedom and opportunity.

01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:11.585
So that we try to, as much as possible, maximize people's individual liberty.

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:19.030
And that we try to be a country where you succeed based on your talent and hard work.

01:15:20.591 --> 01:15:21.632
Those are two fundamental values.

01:15:24.994 --> 01:15:27.196
That's what's made America great.

01:15:27.436 --> 01:15:31.739
And if we lose those, we will... Those are already gone.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:36.728
The current manifestation of American culture is fake it until you make it.

01:15:38.369 --> 01:15:39.590
That's what you need to realize.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:40.831
That's what this guy is.

01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:42.332
That's what Jeff Bezos was.

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:44.253
That's who Bill Gates is.

01:15:44.293 --> 01:15:46.775
These people are just faking it until we accepted them.

01:15:47.436 --> 01:15:50.298
Because they inherited a pile of money that they couldn't screw up.

01:15:52.642 --> 01:16:06.189
There's a video of a German businessman who's on his private plane and he talks about how, you know, when you're like a multi-millionaire, if you're not a complete idiot, you can throw money out one window and more money comes in another window.

01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:07.710
That's just how these things work.

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:13.993
That's why there's a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and that's why there's a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundational Trust.

01:16:15.254 --> 01:16:15.634
That's why.

01:16:17.385 --> 01:16:24.691
One creates the public illusion that there's a good idea and there's a company with a good idea and there's a rich guy who wants to invest in it.

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:35.641
And then the other one invests in the company tenfold and reaps all of the benefits of the public investment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

01:16:36.822 --> 01:16:43.087
And that's just one example of how this scam is run by these ultra rich people who have enough money to pay people to do this for them.

01:16:44.608 --> 01:16:45.509
And he's no different.

01:16:47.358 --> 01:16:53.703
If you could pay a group of people in a building to make money for you, then you would make more money.

01:16:55.204 --> 01:16:57.226
But none of us have a staff to make money for us.

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:07.694
None of us have a staff that's willing to hire other people to go on social media to lie about us or to promote stories about us so that we, you know, our stock price rises or whatever.

01:17:07.774 --> 01:17:08.595
None of us have that.

01:17:08.635 --> 01:17:09.936
That's how this is all done.

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:12.491
they have competing networks.

01:17:13.012 --> 01:17:13.912
Who can do it better?

01:17:14.473 --> 01:17:16.214
Who's got the better surrogate set?

01:17:16.915 --> 01:17:23.781
Right now, I think Elon Musk is smoking everybody on social media with the number of people who think he is the next king.

01:17:23.801 --> 01:17:29.385
And it's also, of course, Donald Trump.

01:17:29.405 --> 01:17:30.326
But Donald Trump is

01:17:32.762 --> 01:17:43.910
It's hard for me to see him in the same light as I see these people who are obviously trying to game the system and actively doing it while pretending that they're coming to our rescue.

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:48.133
Whereas Donald Trump is fighting lawsuits and being threatened with jail.

01:17:50.615 --> 01:17:54.038
And half the people in the United States think he's an idiot.

01:17:54.078 --> 01:17:55.759
That's not really what we have here.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.142
I'm one of the only people in the world who thinks this guy's an idiot.

01:18:01.003 --> 01:18:01.784
Our decline will be swift.

01:18:02.839 --> 01:18:04.421
Our decline will be swift.

01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:15.611
What do you, if you had to bet, I mean, does freedom reassert itself in America or not?

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.423
Well, that's why I think part of why this election is so pivotal.

01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:34.330
I think if we, with a Trump administration, I think we can improve the liberty of Americans.

01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:39.634
I think we need to have sensible deregulation.

01:18:40.273 --> 01:18:42.134
Was that not a yes or no question?

01:18:42.234 --> 01:18:57.158
And yet we can improve the liberty of Americans and we need deregulation, which is exactly what Kevin McKernan was complaining about on the Vance Crowe podcast in 2020, that the FDA with their 10 page forms are really holding us back from saving the world.

01:18:57.218 --> 01:18:59.239
Like all these things are just such a pain.

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:11.867
Says the guy who got to take free technology from his work for the Department of Energy and Human Genome Project in to make his own companies and get filthy rich from to have a house on the Atlantic Ocean.

01:19:12.969 --> 01:19:14.291
I should really call it a mansion.

01:19:16.087 --> 01:19:20.150
Like, come on, there's no way all these people, they haven't lost anything.

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.311
They're not risking anything.

01:19:21.351 --> 01:19:33.059
And they're still in essence, preserving the narrative of the national security state that was basically established in the special virus cancer program with the AIDS program, with the human genome project.

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:41.785
This slow roll to getting everybody to buy into this idea that we need to take control of our evolution.

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:48.134
And we need to take control of the collective consciousness of humanity.

01:19:49.154 --> 01:19:51.456
And technology is going to enable both.

01:19:51.636 --> 01:19:53.938
Science is going to enable both of those things.

01:19:54.018 --> 01:20:02.344
And that's what Desjardins and all of the people that promote him, think about him, like him, they all use this guy as one of their pillars.

01:20:04.045 --> 01:20:07.507
Because he frames it in the context of God and Christianity.

01:20:07.547 --> 01:20:12.391
And it's a very, very malevolent inversion, in my humble opinion.

01:20:13.749 --> 01:20:34.800
Because it, in a lot of respects, makes people think not about themselves and their own choices and their own responsibility and their own role, but instead surrender to the collective consciousness, the collective ideal, the collective whatever, which really kind of absolves you from any responsibility in the end.

01:20:35.894 --> 01:20:44.681
and encourages you to be judgmental of those around you, which is exactly the opposite of the teachings that I thought we were supposed to be promoting.

01:20:46.702 --> 01:20:48.003
It's just very hard right now.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:21:01.233
I haven't read all the books that I've got from eBay, and I've got a lot of reading to do, but I assure you that this is definitely the right direction, and these ideas, if not seminal and foundational to this group of

01:21:03.777 --> 01:21:08.038
of meddlers and people trying to rule us beyond nation states.

01:21:08.098 --> 01:21:18.401
These people are really, they stem from these people that have written books in the 50s and the 30s and the 60s about nation states being a pain in the butt.

01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:25.123
They descend from these people and these are their latest iteration and their latest public manifestation, but that's it.

01:21:25.843 --> 01:21:28.384
This is a long standing operation here.

01:21:30.949 --> 01:21:40.131
where we keep the regulations that matter, like we don't want to destroy important habitats or encourage oil spills or anything like that.

01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:48.553
But there are so many regulatory agencies that have overlapping responsibility that we are smothering progress.

01:21:49.413 --> 01:21:51.493
And we can't build a high-speed rail in America.

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:54.594
You look at the ridiculous high-speed rail project in California.

01:21:55.254 --> 01:22:01.644
where they've spent $7 billion and all they've got to show for it is a 1,600-foot section of concrete with no rails on it.

01:22:01.664 --> 01:22:03.627
There's a picture of it online.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.661
So it's not that fast yet.

01:22:06.761 --> 01:22:08.342
We wouldn't say it's high speed at this point.

01:22:08.602 --> 01:22:09.202
Or even rail.

01:22:09.362 --> 01:22:10.603
It doesn't even have rail in it.

01:22:10.643 --> 01:22:11.924
Maybe by now they've put some rail in it.

01:22:12.244 --> 01:22:14.685
But it's this comically small section of rail.

01:22:15.886 --> 01:22:17.147
Seven billion dollars has been spent.

01:22:18.587 --> 01:22:20.748
Most of it in environmental consulting.

01:22:21.889 --> 01:22:32.295
So what he's suggesting is that it is not the cooperation of private corporations and local officials and the EPA

01:22:33.345 --> 01:22:46.033
to create what is essentially a traitorous robbing, just a traitorous level of public spending into the coffers of private corporation and private contractors.

01:22:46.113 --> 01:22:57.360
It has nothing to do with the collective, you know, desire for these people to extract wealth from the American system or the California system.

01:22:58.362 --> 01:22:59.442
It has nothing to do with that.

01:22:59.482 --> 01:23:04.504
It's just the consequence of really bad regulation.

01:23:06.924 --> 01:23:14.587
It couldn't be that they would put those regulations in there to make sure that it was really easy to siphon money and accomplish nothing.

01:23:14.647 --> 01:23:16.587
That would be traitorous, right?

01:23:16.627 --> 01:23:24.469
That would mean that traitors were in the government and traitors were pretending that the regulations, but he doesn't say that and he knows it.

01:23:24.589 --> 01:23:26.370
He knows that's what's going on.

01:23:29.144 --> 01:23:37.248
He knows that it's not private industry doing their best to cope with suffocating regulations.

01:23:37.328 --> 01:23:46.032
It is a cooperative effort between the regulating agencies and these contractors to be able to expend exorbitant amounts of money doing nothing.

01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:50.654
And then blame it on each other.

01:23:52.475 --> 01:23:57.398
And he does the same thing with all of his subsidies and all of his businesses.

01:23:57.478 --> 01:24:06.184
He's also taking massive amounts of money from the government, but then pretends that, you know, the reason why we don't do more with it is because the regulations are so hard.

01:24:06.885 --> 01:24:16.171
You know, Kevin McKernan would already be done with all the pot genomes in the world and have already made personal strains for all of us if it wasn't for all the regulation he's under.

01:24:19.437 --> 01:24:24.626
I don't know where, but clearly not in building high-speed rail.

01:24:24.646 --> 01:24:31.298
There are so many different regulatory agencies and so many laws and regulations.

01:24:31.994 --> 01:24:37.179
He's literally saying that there are no bad actors in California except for the regulatory agency.

01:24:37.219 --> 01:24:38.040
There's nobody else.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.822
It couldn't be elected officials that are grifting.

01:24:40.882 --> 01:24:43.244
It couldn't be private contractors that are grifting.

01:24:43.765 --> 01:24:44.586
Nothing like that.

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:46.067
It's just regulation.

01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:47.308
Think about this.

01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:49.790
And Tucker's not pushing back.

01:24:51.812 --> 01:24:55.676
That prevent progress that, if this continues, we simply won't be able to get anything done.

01:24:57.975 --> 01:25:00.357
It does seem like the engineers are not getting rich.

01:25:00.438 --> 01:25:05.002
It's the environmental consultants, the climate consultants, the DEI consultants.

01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:12.850
A whole consultant class seems to be getting richer by the year, where people with actual skills, the ones that bring actual progress.

01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:15.012
Useful things, products and services that you can use.

01:25:15.072 --> 01:25:16.654
Useful things, that's right.

01:25:16.674 --> 01:25:19.657
Things that if you were traveling on a desert island, you'd want those people.

01:25:19.857 --> 01:25:19.997
Right.

01:25:21.138 --> 01:25:22.419
But you wouldn't want environmental consultants.

01:25:22.499 --> 01:25:26.222
They seem undercompensated, though.

01:25:27.383 --> 01:25:31.247
It's like, who are actual builders that get things done?

01:25:31.427 --> 01:25:32.167
The builders.

01:25:32.708 --> 01:25:33.288
The builders.

01:25:33.308 --> 01:25:34.469
Who are the builders?

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:39.894
And every year, we're making it harder in America for actual builders to get things done.

01:25:40.214 --> 01:25:41.115
Actual builders.

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:41.936
He said it again.

01:25:41.956 --> 01:25:42.856
Who are the builders?

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.222
where it's just yet another regulation, yet another rule.

01:25:49.962 --> 01:25:55.365
And there's sort of that phrase in Atlas for Art, oh, you'll manage, oh, you'll manage, oh, you'll manage.

01:25:55.385 --> 01:25:57.826
It's like eventually you can't get anything done.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:02.189
Why the hostility, though, toward people with meaningful skills?

01:26:02.569 --> 01:26:04.890
It's not a neutral posture they have.

01:26:05.231 --> 01:26:08.312
And they're enriching themselves, obviously, by creating fake jobs because they have no skills.

01:26:09.213 --> 01:26:11.134
And they don't have creative power.

01:26:11.775 --> 01:26:12.476
So I understand that.

01:26:12.916 --> 01:26:16.059
But why do they hate people who do have creative power and actual skills?

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.760
I don't understand that.

01:26:24.026 --> 01:26:24.947
I don't even know the question.

01:26:25.007 --> 01:26:26.027
It's such a dumb question.

01:26:26.088 --> 01:26:28.890
It's difficult for me to put myself in a mindset.

01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:34.289
Because I'm someone who believes in construction.

01:26:34.309 --> 01:26:34.989
I build things.

01:26:35.009 --> 01:26:35.469
That's what I do.

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:36.970
I build things.

01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.730
I build things.

01:26:37.751 --> 01:26:38.311
He's a builder.

01:26:44.758 --> 01:26:48.840
Thousands of hours, tens of thousands of hours in factories, building a factory.

01:26:49.021 --> 01:26:52.563
Tens of thousands of hours in factories, building factories.

01:26:52.603 --> 01:26:54.084
He builds things.

01:26:54.204 --> 01:26:56.485
Cars and rockets and internet in space.

01:26:56.805 --> 01:26:59.287
Someone who would want to do crime, because I don't want to do crime.

01:26:59.307 --> 01:27:04.850
I don't want to hurt, you know, there's some people who enjoy hurting other people.

01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:06.231
I don't enjoy hurting other people.

01:27:06.991 --> 01:27:10.753
So I have a hard time imagining why would somebody do that?

01:27:10.913 --> 01:27:11.053
Yes.

01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:14.316
That's just extraordinary.

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:16.137
I'm sorry, I'm not going to go any further.

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.859
Just remember what we're dealing with here.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:30.728
This is you on X. And it doesn't matter how comfortable the chair is, or how nice the controller is, or how clear the goggle image is, or how smooth the chair pivots.

01:27:31.909 --> 01:27:33.110
This is you on X.

01:27:34.961 --> 01:27:38.543
And this is how I was on X for many, many years.

01:27:38.784 --> 01:27:42.646
Now I just go on X to make sure that these people still have to work.

01:27:43.707 --> 01:27:48.410
And you shouldn't follow me on X, because I'm not going to say anything useful there very often.

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:53.913
Because I think one of the only things to say is that these people are part of the system.

01:27:53.933 --> 01:27:58.957
They're part of the military operation that is X. And without these people,

01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:13.434
Without these people coordinating their lies, then when you took the goggles off, you wouldn't be left with what they want you to be left with, which is Anthony Fauci and PBS NewsHour and a few memories of some other people.

01:28:14.733 --> 01:28:17.175
Every time you get off social media, what are you left with?

01:28:17.195 --> 01:28:33.367
You're left with the stain of gain of function, and the stain of bad public health, and bad America, and the Middle East is bad, and this is bad, and we're all bad, and all kinds of bad things are gonna happen, and none of those are ladders out of the cave.

01:28:34.328 --> 01:28:40.632
They're limited spectrums of debate created by our acquiescence to a military program called X.

01:28:51.332 --> 01:29:00.700
Now I'm going to make contact with the family right now just very briefly to figure out what their plan is because I wanted to watch this video but I'm going to tell you right now, I'm going to copy it out first.

01:29:03.351 --> 01:29:04.673
I'm going to put it in the chat.

01:29:05.614 --> 01:29:08.898
I'm also going to upload a copy of this to PeerTube at some point.

01:29:08.918 --> 01:29:09.799
There's the video.

01:29:09.899 --> 01:29:12.762
It's three hours long and it's got less than 260 views.

01:29:16.137 --> 01:29:21.359
I think this video is extremely worth watching just for the first 20 minutes that I watched last night.

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.921
But it's 10 to 2.

01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:29.503
And because we have some other plans this evening, I was moving up basketball until 2 o'clock.

01:29:29.563 --> 01:29:34.665
So it may be that my son is waiting to go to basketball and mom is not going to take him.

01:29:34.725 --> 01:29:37.326
If mom takes him, then I could start the video for a little while.

01:29:37.366 --> 01:29:40.488
So let me just check really quick to see what we're doing.

01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:44.793
I swear it's only gonna be like 30 seconds.

01:29:44.853 --> 01:29:45.814
All I gotta do is check.

01:30:19.531 --> 01:30:27.942
Okay, I think it's probably smarter if I stop here and just tease you with the idea that we're going to watch this video and then you take it as homework.

01:30:28.642 --> 01:30:35.872
Take this link and watch the video in the beginning and see if you can understand any of it or follow any of it and then we'll try to dissect it together.

01:30:40.421 --> 01:30:45.703
I won't be able to do it today though because we have some things going on tonight that I can't really reschedule and are very important.

01:30:45.783 --> 01:30:49.304
So, um, I'm sorry that I'm cutting the stream short right now.

01:30:49.424 --> 01:30:55.206
I don't think it's the worst thing in the world, but, um, cause it was pretty solid.

01:30:56.227 --> 01:30:57.147
I know I don't have to.

01:30:57.867 --> 01:31:01.469
Yeah, but I've already done an hour and 31.

01:31:01.929 --> 01:31:04.510
And if I start this three hour video now, it'll be too long.

01:31:06.018 --> 01:31:06.518
Thank you though.

01:31:06.979 --> 01:31:16.184
So yes, we need a new consensus about things in America and just remember that these people haven't helped us out.

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:18.266
I'm not going to play that again.

01:31:18.366 --> 01:31:19.606
That's too often now.

01:31:19.626 --> 01:31:22.168
You've heard Heather Haines say that many, many times.

01:31:22.248 --> 01:31:23.069
She doesn't actually

01:31:23.929 --> 01:31:29.395
say what you needed to say and they still haven't said it because they are actively misleading the young.

01:31:29.455 --> 01:31:38.065
They needed to run the clock out on this so that people wouldn't figure out the truth that they always knew that there was going to be excess deaths and they wanted to explain it in their way.

01:31:39.086 --> 01:31:44.169
That's why these people won't talk about any of these things and why they try to ignore me as much as possible.

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:47.651
And if they have the chance to make fun of me or something like that, of course they will.

01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:50.872
But none of them will simply discuss that RNA cannot pandemic.

01:31:51.313 --> 01:31:58.416
They won't talk about there's no difference between endemicity and a background if we don't have any data from before 2020.

01:32:00.236 --> 01:32:06.681
They just won't talk about it because that will reveal their game, which is that, you know, we don't want to talk about those years.

01:32:07.282 --> 01:32:09.864
Let's just say the COVID shots are bad and stick to that.

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:13.727
So we need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America.

01:32:13.747 --> 01:32:16.509
If you liked what you saw, please try and find a way to share the stream.

01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:21.893
Um, and, uh, if you want to support it, please go to giggle and biological.com and find a way to do so.

01:32:21.933 --> 01:32:23.975
We need every little bit of support we can get.

01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:26.316
We have lots of plans.

01:32:26.356 --> 01:32:35.060
There is a meeting, a live live stream on the November 3rd, which is a Sunday on the same weekend that the Brownstone Institute is having a two-day gathering in Pittsburgh.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:50.527
And so I would encourage you if you have any desire to be present and a live stream in an audience where maybe there will be potluck food or pizza ordered or maybe a barbecue afterward, please schedule and arrange for yourself to be in person here in Pittsburgh.

01:32:51.087 --> 01:32:57.930
and send me an email or my wife Veerla an email and we'll get started with trying to help you figure out how to get here.

01:32:58.431 --> 01:33:00.852
Thank you very much for joining me and I will see you again tomorrow.

01:33:03.133 --> 01:33:03.553
Is that up?

01:33:04.614 --> 01:33:05.414
Why isn't that on?

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.956
I'm gonna escape because I don't think that's working right.

01:33:10.777 --> 01:33:12.017
Slideshow, current slide.

01:33:14.819 --> 01:33:16.800
There we go.

01:33:18.581 --> 01:33:18.841
Thank you.

01:35:12.293 --> 01:35:13.095
Stop lying!

01:35:13.436 --> 01:35:16.662
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:19.047
Stop lying!
