00:07.739 --> 00:08.019
you

00:43.582 --> 00:53.130
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the of America of the American people Is being used to create the crisis.

00:53.190 --> 00:57.093
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe America.

00:57.253 --> 00:59.195
I don't know crash the dollar.

00:59.395 --> 01:04.299
I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited Treasury value we have left.

01:04.519 --> 01:07.582
I don't know But I know for sure

01:07.967 --> 01:25.406
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

01:27.529 --> 01:34.274
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.757
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:37.817 --> 01:47.264
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:47.304 --> 01:53.889
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:00.606 --> 02:00.894
Bye.

02:35.589 --> 02:59.648
But I couldn't take the punishment And had to settle down Now I'm playing it real straight And guess I cut my hair You might think I'm crazy But I don't even care Cause I can tell what's going on It's hip to be square It's hip to be square I fight my fans in business suits

03:06.364 --> 03:07.547
I watch them on TV.

03:07.628 --> 03:11.721
I'm working almost every day and watching

04:26.010 --> 04:36.268
You figure out, you see it every day And those that weren't upon this route Have gone the other way
