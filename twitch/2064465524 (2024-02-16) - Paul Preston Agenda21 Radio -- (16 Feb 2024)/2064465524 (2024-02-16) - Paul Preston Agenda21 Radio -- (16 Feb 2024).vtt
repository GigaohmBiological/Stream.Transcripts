00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
I am a mom, and there's only one thing that I'm afraid of.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.720
And that's the people in elected office

00:07.720 --> 00:09.720
taking away my rights.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.960
I'm not afraid of the crook that's gonna come to my door

00:12.960 --> 00:15.520
because if my dogs don't get them, I will.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.520
And it's my job to defend myself.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.480
It's not your job to protect me.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.600
It's not your job to defend me.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.360
It's your job to protect the Constitution

00:29.360 --> 00:34.360
and protect my rights to defend myself.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.360
8-1-1-0

00:37.360 --> 00:39.360
Broadcast 5

00:39.360 --> 00:41.360
You're a bunker, high and top mount.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.360
It's all heading towards a fascist totalitarian state.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.360
It's radio. That's delivering the truth.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.360
AK-47's belong in the hands of soldiers, not the hands of brothers.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.360
The problem is they don't get to determine what is right and wrong in the process.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.360
It's all done by the central government.

00:59.360 --> 01:05.360
And here's Hall Press Press and agenda 21 radio.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.360
We should be okay, I think, here.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.360
Yes?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.360
Thank you for joining me.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.360
To agenda 21 radio, this is the radio show that is stopping totalitarianism.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.360
One exceptional American at a time.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.360
And yes, ladies and gentlemen, are you that exceptional American?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
Well, I suspect you are.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.360
That's why you're listening to this radio show right here, right now, on agenda 21 radio.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.360
Remember to visit our website at 821r.com

01:51.360 --> 01:53.360
and new California State.com.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.360
Many thanks to Chris Street in the last hour explaining what's going on

01:57.360 --> 02:02.360
with inflation and, of course, it's here and what's going to be happening in the future.

02:02.360 --> 02:07.360
The future is grim and dark, but it's necessary.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
And I think that's the most important thing.

02:09.360 --> 02:14.360
The hopeful word is that this period of time that we're going to go through economically in this country,

02:14.360 --> 02:20.360
and especially out here in California because, you know, making a new state is paramount to this whole process.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.360
I know it sounds a little odd, doesn't it?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.360
But the economy has to crash before we can rise up.

02:26.360 --> 02:31.360
And, of course, that's exactly what we're positioning ourselves to do right now in the new state.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.360
And we're going to be sending delegates to Washington again.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.360
It looks like the one that Lisa's going to go back here in the next month and maybe more after that.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.360
We're kind of having to play a little tight game on this right now.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.360
We wanted to be in there in January, February.

02:45.360 --> 02:51.360
But because of circumstances with an impeachment and all the other crazy stuff that's going on,

02:51.360 --> 02:56.360
we felt the best interest that we're going to be a little bit more judicious about when we send people.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.360
It's very expensive, as you know, to send people to Washington to lobby on our behalf.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.360
But things are lining up.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.360
They are absolutely lining up exactly as we thought they would at this point in time.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.360
So we think that statehood is eminent for new California state.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.360
Well, with this right now is somebody that's going to be a very interesting discussion.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
Another science person.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.360
I can't imagine that because I'm a science guy myself.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.360
But J. J. Cooey, I think I'm pronouncing that name correct.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.360
So am I doing that?

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
Oh, my goodness.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.360
I didn't know I was going to be on view here that I'm going to switch this off my fault.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.360
We're going to put that off then.

03:32.360 --> 03:38.360
So tell us a little bit about yourself because you have a science background.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.360
Right.

03:39.360 --> 03:44.360
Pretty intense science background on my dad, which is really wonderful to see.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.360
And we seem to be, well, science minded.

03:47.360 --> 03:54.360
I'm a biologist myself and taught biological sciences for years and anatomy, physiology,

03:54.360 --> 03:57.360
genetics, virology, and all that stuff.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
Botany is one of my big favorites.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.360
New world cultivars, actually.

04:01.360 --> 04:06.360
So when people started talking about the dairy and gap and all this invasion, I cringe at

04:06.360 --> 04:09.360
what's going on with the flora and fauna down there.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.360
But anyway, tell us about yourself because I'm very happy to have you on the show.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.360
Well, I'm very happy to be here.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.360
I hope you can hear me.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.360
Okay.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.360
My feedback.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
Great.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.360
Okay, great.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.360
I am a lifelong biologist.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.360
I'm a guy who wanted to go to med school when I was a teenager.

04:27.360 --> 04:33.360
If you ever, I don't know if you ever did that where you suggested to friends and family,

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
you might want to be a doctor.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.360
That's the best answer you can give once you start.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
There you go.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.360
So once you start giving that answer, you know, you can't change your mind and say you

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
want to be a bartender.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.360
So I kind of went all full bore.

04:44.360 --> 04:51.360
I went med pre med and I was on a waiting list in Chicago medical schools for a few years.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.360
And while I was on the waiting list, I was a high school teacher.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.360
And I really loved teaching high school.

04:58.360 --> 05:04.360
And it kind of broke me away from this pursuit of med school because I was also a bartender.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.360
I'm going to tell you the long story really short.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.360
And as a bartender, I started to make more money than I was as a teacher.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.360
So I started just bartend for a little while and that didn't work out.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.360
I lost that job for a silly reason.

05:17.360 --> 05:23.360
And I went back into the Chicago Tribune to find a job and I got a job as a technician in a

05:23.360 --> 05:29.360
laboratory at the University of Chicago where a really kind man taught me a bunch of stuff

05:29.360 --> 05:35.360
on how to use a microscope and surgery and other things and enabled me to pick myself

05:35.360 --> 05:39.360
back up so to speak and reorganize what I wanted to do with my life.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.360
And I went and did my PhD in the Netherlands with somebody that I met while I was working

05:44.360 --> 05:46.360
at the University of Chicago.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.360
So after being in the Netherlands for about eight years, I met my wife.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.360
We moved following my career to Norway where I worked for a few years.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.360
Then I moved back to the Netherlands where I was still a neurobiologist there trying to

05:58.360 --> 06:00.360
get tenure and I didn't get enough grant money.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.360
So then in 2016, this was about 15 years into my career.

06:05.360 --> 06:12.360
My family and I moved from Holland to Pittsburgh and just in time to see Trump get elected.

06:12.360 --> 06:17.360
And so we watched and tried to figure out, you know, where my home country went.

06:17.360 --> 06:23.360
I mean, I'd been gone for about 14 years and I lived in Wisconsin and Chicago.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.360
And when I came back, it was a pretty different place.

06:27.360 --> 06:33.360
And when the pandemic started, I just, I found myself confused by it, I guess.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.360
I found it myself confused by a number of things that everybody took for granted that everybody

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
believed.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.360
And so my decision was, I just going to learn this, I guess.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
I'm just going to download the papers.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
I mean, I'm working at a med school.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.360
I might as well just, you know, use the library and see if I can figure out what we're talking

06:50.360 --> 06:52.360
about here and within three or four weeks.

06:53.360 --> 06:59.360
I had figured out that the story of everybody on TV worrying about whether we could develop

06:59.360 --> 07:04.360
immunity to a novel virus or even the idea that there was a novel virus already seemed to go

07:04.360 --> 07:08.360
against most of the stuff that was in the textbooks before 2020.

07:08.360 --> 07:14.360
And so as I started to ask faculty members at the University of Pittsburgh and talk to faculty

07:14.360 --> 07:20.360
members about this stuff, I got a lot of pushback, mostly from people who didn't think that what

07:20.360 --> 07:25.360
I was reading could possibly be right because it wasn't my area of expertise.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.660
And so I started to do journal clubs on my bike and I put them on YouTube and I tried

07:29.660 --> 07:33.360
to encourage faculty members to watch them and they wouldn't watch them.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.640
And at some moment, I got asked not to come in anymore because the faculty had decided

07:37.640 --> 07:41.760
that I was a danger because I wasn't taking my temperature every day and I wasn't wearing

07:41.760 --> 07:43.960
a mask in my office.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.360
And so I had eight months left in my contract.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.560
They didn't actually fire me.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.560
They just made it very impossible for me to continue my career.

07:51.560 --> 07:56.560
All my papers stopped, all my work stopped, my research stopped, my supervision of students

07:56.560 --> 07:57.560
stopped, everything stopped.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.160
And so there's no way to move on in the university system and get another job if there's no one

08:02.160 --> 08:04.560
giving you a recommendation or anything like that.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.060
So I did the only thing I thought I could do, which was I just started teaching immunology

08:09.060 --> 08:13.560
online and started shaking a can on the internet hoping that I could raise enough money to keep

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
my family alive.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.560
And it sounds pretty dramatic, but that was my only plan.

08:18.560 --> 08:23.560
I didn't know what else to do because I really felt like I had seen an alien and no one else

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
saw it.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.560
So I had to explain it to everybody that there was something incongruent here.

08:28.560 --> 08:35.560
And so I spent about a year being supported by just people on the internet until Robert

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
F. Kennedy Jr.

08:36.560 --> 08:40.560
called me and asked me to help him write his book, the Wuhan cover up.

08:41.560 --> 08:45.560
And so I did a lot of fact checking in that book and making sure that the citations that

08:45.560 --> 08:50.560
he was using were the correct citations and said what he was trying to say with them and

08:50.560 --> 08:55.560
had a lot of back and forth about the biology and a lot of the biology that I'm teaching

08:55.560 --> 08:58.560
now is actually in the book in the form of quotes of my own.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.560
And so that's really very happy.

09:01.560 --> 09:08.560
It was a very happy point in my life, but continuing to push forward with my understanding of this,

09:08.560 --> 09:15.560
it's become very clear to me in a long story short that we were tricked over an elaborate

09:15.560 --> 09:23.560
theater over the last four years, but especially in 2020 and 2021, we were tricked into thinking

09:23.560 --> 09:25.560
that there was a cover up happening.

09:25.560 --> 09:31.560
And we were supposed to buy into this elaborate theater of redacted emails and slack messages

09:31.560 --> 09:35.560
and arguments in front of Congress about who's telling the truth.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.560
This was all an elaborate theater to get the left and the right to think that they were

09:40.560 --> 09:43.560
involved in solving a mystery about a novel virus.

09:43.560 --> 09:49.560
And this, by solving this mystery, has gotten the entire world to accept that there was a

09:49.560 --> 09:54.560
novel virus, that there was a pandemic, had had nothing to do with stupidity and lies,

09:54.560 --> 09:57.560
and that we should teach this mythology to our children.

09:57.560 --> 10:02.560
And I'm really trying hard to help people push back against this because if we teach this

10:02.560 --> 10:06.560
to our children, it's a mythology that they'll never be able to escape from.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
Oh, I totally agree.

10:07.560 --> 10:12.560
You know, I was, you know, quite fascinated by the 201 project.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.560
I'm sure you're aware of that, John Hobbs University.

10:16.560 --> 10:23.560
And when that was going down, I said to myself, this was, I think, October, November, in 2019.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.560
Correct.

10:24.560 --> 10:31.560
And I was watching it and kind of tuning in every once in a while.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.560
During my spare time.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.560
And I'm sending myself, what are they setting up here?

10:36.560 --> 10:39.560
What the pieces weren't fitting, you know, that it was too soon.

10:39.560 --> 10:44.560
And then December, I got, December, 2019, I got sick with it.

10:44.560 --> 10:51.560
And now I had, just to give you my background, at age 26, I had the mumps.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
I got the mumps.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.560
At age 36, I got chicken pox.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.560
Adult chicken pox.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
Oh, wow.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.560
That's supposed to be heavy when you're an adult.

11:01.560 --> 11:09.560
That year, I was one of two people who got it in Orange County, California, back this is in the 80s.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.560
And I was one of two people who got it as an adult.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.560
And the other person died.

11:14.560 --> 11:19.560
There was a person in Prescott, Arizona, who had it, a female.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.560
She was pregnant.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.560
She died.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.560
Everybody I knew that had it died.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.560
Except me, but I struggled really violently.

11:27.560 --> 11:33.560
I struggled for, you know, for a good 30 days before recovery started.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.560
But in that whole process, so I have a real taste of what viruses feel like in my body.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
Right.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
I get that.

11:40.560 --> 11:50.560
And when I contracted this at the time, it was like the flu coming on with a cold, but it was completely different in terms of how it was progressing through my body.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.560
I just could sense it.

11:52.560 --> 11:56.560
And then, of course, the whole, all the symptoms started to settle in.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.560
I said, this is something that's not natural.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.560
It just, it just came to me.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.560
It was something that was not natural.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.560
And, of course, I started, you know, taking care of myself.

12:08.560 --> 12:14.560
I just got Ivermectin and I started taking zinc and everything like that and a quinine.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.560
And I started to recover, but it was very, very difficult.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.560
But then they came out with this whole thing.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.560
I think it was in February or March.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
Maybe it was March.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.560
The whole John Hopkins scenario came out and I said, wait a minute here.

12:27.560 --> 12:32.560
You know, they started out with that big map with all the blood drops on it.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.560
I said, this completely contrived thing.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
Completely.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.560
Can you say again, when were you sick like this?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
It was in 2019?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.560
Well, I started December, 2019.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.560
I was one of the early cases that nobody knew about.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.560
And then by January, I had gone through the whole cycle.

12:51.560 --> 12:57.560
And it really did not know what to do with myself because I was so sick at times, but,

12:57.560 --> 12:58.560
you know, it survived it.

12:58.560 --> 13:03.560
But then, you know, then when we saw that John Hopkins information coming out and they started

13:03.560 --> 13:09.560
exercising the exercise of the 201 project, I said to myself, completely contrived by

13:09.560 --> 13:12.560
the World Health Organization and the United Nations.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.560
And I called it a hoax from day one, I called it a hoax.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.560
And what you're talking about now is we can't perpetuate the hoax.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.560
I think that's what I'm talking about indeed.

13:23.560 --> 13:31.560
And I think we can't underestimate how much of a role policy change and sort of an illusion

13:31.560 --> 13:36.560
of consensus in the mainstream media and on social media that there was something that could

13:36.560 --> 13:42.560
be an extended global danger that caused everybody to behave in such a way.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.560
I mean, we just don't, we don't have a very good accounting of what actually happened

13:46.560 --> 13:49.560
because we haven't treated it like a crime scene yet.

13:49.560 --> 13:54.560
We're treating it like an emergency that doesn't need to be retrospectively inspected,

13:54.560 --> 13:55.560
but it really does.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.560
We need to go back and treat it like a crime scene.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
Nothing is normal.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.560
Nothing is normal in this process.

14:01.560 --> 14:02.560
Nothing is normal.

14:03.560 --> 14:08.560
So, you know, normal minute and I'm not a medical person or doctor or anything like that.

14:08.560 --> 14:15.560
I did teach anatomy physiology though, but in a normal process of investigation to solve

14:15.560 --> 14:20.560
the problems following the scientific method, what a concept, you know, that you get results

14:20.560 --> 14:23.560
and you do, you can study those results objectively.

14:23.560 --> 14:29.560
No one's looking for any kind of process to investigate or to follow through because

14:29.560 --> 14:30.560
it's a crime.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.560
This is criminal behavior in that criminal behavior from the World Health Organization

14:36.560 --> 14:39.560
all the way down to your many of your doctors.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.560
And we were talking to one of our guests a couple of days ago and she was talking about

14:43.560 --> 14:46.560
how the curriculums have been changed in medical schools.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.560
So much of physiology isn't even taught.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.560
Yeah.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
I mean, not.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.560
I can't want physiology in a medical school.

14:54.560 --> 14:59.560
I can't, I can't verify that from personal experience, but it's, it's, it would be my.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.560
It would be far.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
It would not surprise me.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.560
Let me say it like that.

15:04.560 --> 15:10.560
We, we, we have medical schools that teach very, very, very poor immunology.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.560
We have medical schools that basically don't teach anything about,

15:14.560 --> 15:19.560
about the function of immunology in the context of nutrition.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
We don't.

15:20.560 --> 15:25.560
There's a whole host of, of basic failures that, that allopathic medicine and.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.560
I mean, everyone kind of acknowledges it now, but, but it only has a result of the pandemic.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.560
It's kind of frustrating.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.560
I'm, I'm still trying to sort out.

15:35.560 --> 15:41.560
The people like you who have this story of an intense sickness where.

15:41.560 --> 15:51.560
When it occurred and how it occurred and there, and they're sort of figuring it into the, the whole pandemic because I think it's very tempting.

15:52.560 --> 15:58.560
When the media, social media, mainstream media cues up a consensus about something.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.560
It's very tempting to then.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.560
Attribute an experience to that, to that idea.

16:05.560 --> 16:11.560
And so I, my challenge to anybody who claims to have been very sick and I don't mean to.

16:11.560 --> 16:16.560
Say this in an antagonizing way, but I want you to very carefully think as hard as you can.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.560
About how much you can remember about any other time that you've been sick in your life.

16:21.560 --> 16:29.560
And, and think about how because all the other times you've been sick in your life, you've been trying to tough it out.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.560
And you didn't want, maybe you didn't even want people to know you were sick.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
Maybe you couldn't tell them because you had to go to work.

16:34.560 --> 16:40.560
Maybe these, these sicknesses that we have on our record are all forgotten.

16:41.560 --> 16:51.560
And people put this one last year of 19 and 20 into a special context because it is in a special context according to all the people around us.

16:51.560 --> 16:59.560
But only because we take it into that special context. I think there are so many people that say, wow, I also had it.

16:59.560 --> 17:09.560
And we have to be very careful because there are, we come from America where you use your sick days for vacation and you go to work when you're sick.

17:09.560 --> 17:20.560
For me, it's hard to take that seriously when I know as an American before 2020, I didn't remember anytime I was sick because I worked through it and I, I tried not to be sick.

17:20.560 --> 17:26.560
And suddenly in 2020 we all pivoted to, oh, we got to be very careful. And if we're sick, we better do something about it.

17:26.560 --> 17:37.560
And that's a very tricky psychological trap that can, can make you think maybe that something is more significant than it was now that all being said.

17:37.560 --> 17:42.560
It sounds like you had a pretty bad sickness that may have stood out from that.

17:42.560 --> 17:50.560
You know, I have seen what I'm trying to say to a lot of people is I have some credentials in terms of bad viral conditions.

17:50.560 --> 17:57.560
I see, you know, the, I come from that perspective and I, I recognize what was happening to my body.

17:57.560 --> 18:06.560
You know, when you go through something like adult chickenpox and you survive it, then your body remembers it.

18:06.560 --> 18:10.560
Yes. You remember it. You remember just about every element of it.

18:10.560 --> 18:18.560
So you can kind of sense when there's a virus, when there's a certain viral condition that you've got or some even bacterial conditions.

18:18.560 --> 18:28.560
In fact, recently, well, not recently, but about six years ago, I had stage five colorectal cancer and I beat it.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.560
Congratulations. Very, very, very lucky.

18:32.560 --> 18:38.560
But I did take chemotherapy and which is what was it what I was planning to do?

18:38.560 --> 18:42.560
But I didn't plan to have the surgery as abruptly as I did, by the way.

18:42.560 --> 18:46.560
But it not changed my physiology quite a bit. You know, I could sense it from that.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.560
But I go back to the training ground of having the chicken pot.

18:50.560 --> 18:55.560
I had it twice. I had it when I was a kid and I got it again. A lot of people don't recognize.

18:56.560 --> 19:01.560
You can get it again. But my point is it was something quite different.

19:01.560 --> 19:07.560
There's no question. And I did not recognize it as any kind of disease I've had before.

19:07.560 --> 19:13.560
It felt different. It felt. I just said contrived is what I thought.

19:13.560 --> 19:18.560
So to me, I thought back, well, you know, I knew a little bit about bio weapons labs.

19:18.560 --> 19:26.560
I do know doing modification. And then I started thinking, Oh, this is the they're now coming after us with, you know, bio weapons.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.560
So how does it how does this stand up with the Wuhan then?

19:30.560 --> 19:45.560
I have to tell you, I think the main thing to to the main message I'd like to give you in this short time that I have is that the bio and you're a biologist, so I want to tempt you with it very quickly.

19:45.560 --> 19:58.560
The biology that they purport to that supports the pandemic is one that can very simply be summarized as a small quantity of RNA existed in Wuhan.

19:58.560 --> 20:06.560
And now there's a much, much, much, much, much larger quantity of descendants of that same RNA molecule, like many, many more.

20:06.560 --> 20:24.560
Obviously, if we believe that all the COVID that they find in the world now with testing is COVID that all descended from Wuhan or all descended from a laboratory leak or a or a spill or a Wuhan market interaction between a pangolin and a raccoon bear,

20:24.560 --> 20:33.560
then any way that you cut that what you're suggesting is something that there is no biological evidence for this ever having occurred before.

20:34.560 --> 20:44.560
RNA molecules don't replicate like that. They don't they don't have the fidelity to do it. They don't have the the machinery to do it.

20:44.560 --> 20:53.560
Nothing about how we've previously tracked coronaviruses could ever support the idea that one is still going around.

20:53.560 --> 21:08.560
The last time this happened, 10,000 people were infected and 800 people died and that was the best we've ever tracked a coronavirus and the most times we've ever claimed to have followed a chain of infection every other time we've done it.

21:09.560 --> 21:19.560
Every other time we've tried to do it, we've gotten to about 10 people, maybe 20 people, the one in the Netherlands in 2009 called NL67.

21:19.560 --> 21:30.560
I think they got 27 kids to show all the same related sequence, but this 15 million sequences that are all related and start at a point.

21:30.560 --> 21:42.560
This is unprecedented on several orders of magnitude. And it's this biology, this biological claim that needs to be attacked because there is there is no there's no basis for this.

21:42.560 --> 21:50.560
And so they're clearly telling us a story. And one of the easiest ways this could be a story is that this background signal was already there.

21:51.560 --> 21:56.560
SARS viruses have always been in circulation and they've characterized this background very well.

21:56.560 --> 22:04.560
And then they very carefully said, okay, now we're going to start testing for it and tell all the skilled TV watchers that it's evidence of spread.

22:04.560 --> 22:10.560
And so are there dangerous viruses? I guess there could be. Could you gotten really sick from dangerous viruses? Sure.

22:11.560 --> 22:26.560
But that's not a situation that necessarily has changed from 2018 to 19 to 20 as much as our monitoring and testing for it and claiming that before we started testing, there was nothing.

22:26.560 --> 22:32.560
And this extraordinary claim also needs extraordinary evidence for which there's none.

22:32.560 --> 22:45.560
So in that scenario, then I think you have to consider the possibility that every biosecurity state, every pharmaceutical company, every major government would be better off.

22:45.560 --> 22:55.560
If the populace accepted this as a standard danger and a standard emergency that will go on forever, even if it wasn't.

22:55.560 --> 23:06.560
And it seems to me very likely that what they've done is established this mythology as a potential and confirmed it with all of this theater and now our children are going to grow up with this.

23:06.560 --> 23:14.560
And we can't allow this because it's not real. There is no RNA molecule that can do what they claim it has done.

23:14.560 --> 23:27.560
Well, that's very, you know, that's very, very interesting. And in other words, and again, what I'm interested in doing is shape shifting the narrative away from the fact that this, this is really a pandemic, as they said.

23:27.560 --> 23:34.560
And, you know, my teaching part of it, I start with, you know, endemics and pandemics.

23:34.560 --> 23:38.560
And, you know, I can say that this clearly wasn't that.

23:38.560 --> 23:45.560
But, you know, the question, though, is what about all these people who took the vaccines?

23:45.560 --> 24:00.560
Oh, and this is, of course, this is part of the reason why I'm sure we're probably on to something here because the, the principle of wanting to shift to transfection as a standard therapeutic.

24:00.560 --> 24:04.560
And it's actually the precursor to personalized medicine.

24:04.560 --> 24:19.560
This was already in the works for at least a decade before the pandemic. This was already a technology that they've been trying to roll out in various places, starting with a dental virus and curing genetic diseases and a guy like Jesse Gelsinger who died of it.

24:19.560 --> 24:36.560
All the way up until the start of the pandemic where, quite frankly, I think it's patently obvious now that the idea was to invoke a sort of worst, worst case scenario so that they could justify the emergency use of this therapeutic.

24:37.560 --> 24:48.560
And then continue to perpetuate the worst case scenario so that as many people as possible would get on board and there would essentially be an insignificant control group.

24:48.560 --> 24:56.560
And since that didn't happen, the damage of the shot is starting to become more and more apparent every day.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.560
So there's a couple of things that that strike me.

25:01.560 --> 25:09.560
And from looking at this whole process as we've gone forward and I'm glad we discussed this whole the treatment.

25:09.560 --> 25:17.560
Because we haven't totally hit it. We've got the vaccine, but we've now the treatment for those people who quote, get have the COVID.

25:17.560 --> 25:24.560
You know, because early on, and this is what we were saying this, this is not a pandemic like we're saying a pandemic is.

25:24.560 --> 25:30.560
Or has it should be because people were being, you know, when they when they pass away.

25:30.560 --> 25:36.560
There was a lot of association with people saying, well, he died of COVID.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.560
Well, we had one of my friends, very good friends.

25:40.560 --> 25:46.560
He had his grandmother pass away and she had had, you know, triple bypass surgery.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.560
She had had heart problems. She was quite elderly.

25:49.560 --> 25:55.560
And when he got the death certificate back and said, she died of COVID virus. Well, it was a heart attack.

25:55.560 --> 26:00.560
You know, and then we found out down from Contra Costa County of all places.

26:00.560 --> 26:08.560
Out here that there was somebody who died of a gunshot wound and they were listed as dying from COVID virus.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
And then we started getting.

26:10.560 --> 26:16.560
You get what I'm saying, I definitely do, but I think it's actually a bit more malevolent than the random ones.

26:16.560 --> 26:21.560
The stories of like the guy who died of a gunshot wound or a person in a car accident.

26:21.560 --> 26:36.560
Those stories, I think, are artificially amplified because actually it was intentional that they confounded heart attacks and strokes with COVID.

26:36.560 --> 26:44.560
And they did it especially in places like New York City where they gave EMTs orders not to resuscitate because they might spread the virus.

26:44.560 --> 26:58.560
But what that did was it effectively created more heart attack deaths because they weren't being resuscitated and then those heart attack deaths both because of finances and because they were using a COVID protocol by not resuscitating them.

26:58.560 --> 27:05.560
Therefore, they had to designate them as COVID deaths. Otherwise, they would be liable for not resuscitating them.

27:05.560 --> 27:14.560
So they actually put people into a position where they could avoid any possibility of medical malpractice if they just said this is a COVID death.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.560
And I'm using a COVID protocol, which includes do not resuscitate.

27:18.560 --> 27:29.560
Understand that they knew that when they transfected people, that's what the real name of MRNA in a lipid nanoparticles should have been from the very beginning, a transfection.

27:29.560 --> 27:37.560
And every academic biologist in every medical school in America and around the world that has used transfection in their research should have done known better.

27:37.560 --> 27:49.560
That's why I say it's criminally negligent. There's hundreds of thousands of biologists in America and around the world who could have known that this transfection was not appropriate for healthy humans, and they said nothing.

27:49.560 --> 27:54.560
And so this is something that needs they need to be a held to account for.

27:54.560 --> 28:14.560
But it is really serious because all of the people involved that were calling it an investigational vaccine were just renaming something that had a normal name that was even there are whole websites on every biopharmaceutical product supplier of transfection products.

28:15.560 --> 28:24.560
Up until 2020 included lipofectamine, which is essentially lipid nanoparticles you can make on the bench with a shaker.

28:24.560 --> 28:40.560
So we're this is absurd that they rolled it out as this this was some new suite of technologies has old stuff that we've been using in laboratories in universities for decades on animals from monkeys all the way down to mice.

28:40.560 --> 28:48.560
And every time we use it on them we sacrifice them because we know that after transfecting their brain their immune system will attack it.

28:48.560 --> 29:01.560
So it's a it's to me, that's where I lost my job that's that speaking out about this with people at a university and trying to explain that Bill Gates can't go on TV and claim that transfection is going to work.

29:02.560 --> 29:09.560
You would never use it on your kids. And their answer was always the same. Well, they must have fixed it. I mean, they're not going to use the same stuff.

29:12.560 --> 29:20.560
Listen, Jay. Oh, gosh, this has been a very, very stimulating conversation. I knew 25 minutes wasn't going to be enough.

29:21.560 --> 29:26.560
I got my biology fix for a while. Okay.

29:26.560 --> 29:32.560
You know, and I really appreciate talking to you. And so how did this the book turn out?

29:32.560 --> 29:36.560
The book's pretty good. I gotta say the book.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.560
Yeah, it's good.

29:40.560 --> 29:50.560
This is the book. It's really good because it's got a couple things in it. One of the best things that it's got in it is a crazy paper that was released in 2019.

29:50.560 --> 30:03.560
It was written by Cina Bavari and Alison Totura, who was the last postdoc before the pandemic who worked for Ralph Barrick, and they were both working at US Amrit at the time in 2019.

30:03.560 --> 30:09.560
And they just happened to write a paper that said that there is probably going to be a coronavirus pandemic in the near future.

30:09.560 --> 30:16.560
It's probably going to come out of a bat cave in China. And it's probably going to be very handy to have remdesivir on hand when this happens.

30:17.560 --> 30:29.560
How much insight someone would have to have to write a paper like that in 2019. Just weird. And that's in this book too. It's the only paper that this is the only book about the pandemic that features that paper.

30:29.560 --> 30:39.560
And so that's one of the things I'm very proud of in this book, but there's some biology in here too that's really good that that I've shared with you here too that's in that book as part of the.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.560
Talk about what people said more than a book about what people happened so you.

30:43.560 --> 30:48.560
It's a historic document. I think it's a good book to buy if you're going to buy a book about the pandemic.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.560
Well, awesome. Thank you very much. You're welcome.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.560
Thanks for being with us here. How do we get in contact with you?

30:53.560 --> 31:04.560
I have a website giga ohm biologicals G I G A O H M. It's the very high resistance value. It comes from my old biology work.

31:04.560 --> 31:13.560
And then the last word is biological, but it's all one word giga ohm biological.com and I also am on Twitch and I'm going to be on YouTube on the weekends now again.

31:13.560 --> 31:20.560
I'm teaching biology. So there's a few places to find me. I'm also on Twitter. Thank you very much though for having me on. I really appreciate it.

31:20.560 --> 31:26.560
JJ from where are you at now? I'm in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, actually.

31:27.560 --> 31:33.560
I was born in Erie, Pennsylvania. Oh, wow. That's a snowy place, man. I every time they.

31:33.560 --> 31:39.560
The last time I was there, there was a lake effect snow all over the place.

31:39.560 --> 31:47.560
Well, if you ever need to go home for a homecoming, you know, in April, there's a fully clips that's actually going to go over your Erie.

31:47.560 --> 31:52.560
Oh, right. Very, very good place to see it, actually. Yeah. Thank you very much.

31:53.560 --> 32:12.560
See you. Okay, great, great stuff here on agenda 21 radio. And again, you got the biological fix and I'm happy being able to talk about these kind of things, you know, from the day to day stuff that we always talk about more biology coming at you, you know, from brought to you by the totalitarian

32:13.560 --> 32:24.560
fact that of course, Wuhan and all the things that have gone on with it. This is an excellent interview and I really do want to thank JJ for being with us here on agenda 21 radio.

32:24.560 --> 32:31.560
We got a lot of other things coming up here in the last portion of the show. So stay with us. You're listening to a J agenda 21 radio.

32:31.560 --> 32:39.560
And remember, we are exceptional Americans. We kind of keep telling you that we are exceptional Americans. We'll be right back.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.560
Okay. Well, there it was. I guess I'm going to step out.

32:47.560 --> 32:53.560
Could you hear me? Okay. Was that all right?

32:53.560 --> 33:01.560
Mr. New York or say I couldn't hear my I don't get a good feedback when I'm using my earphones right now, but it was all good.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.560
I'm going to plug you.

33:04.560 --> 33:09.560
Or maybe I just turned it down. Oh, I had it to down to. Okay, good, good, good.

33:10.560 --> 33:19.560
All right, so I'm going to let I'm going to let this go for now. I think I'm going to be on later this afternoon, but I'm not absolutely sure.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.560
And what about the sound is.

33:22.560 --> 33:29.560
What about the noise in the background? Remember, we were talking about that yesterday. Is this okay a little better?

33:29.560 --> 33:35.560
I have the feeling I identified two sources of buzz that I got rid of.

33:35.560 --> 33:38.560
And I'm very excited about that.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.560
Anyway, thank you very much for joining me. I.

33:41.560 --> 33:48.560
It sounds a lot better. That's what I'm talking about. Yes, I'm very excited about it. You're not going to believe what it was.

33:48.560 --> 33:54.560
But I had a couple of effects pedals for my guitar were plugged into the soundboard and.

33:54.560 --> 34:01.560
I didn't have them turned off when they're they were plugged into the USB for power and that was just.

34:01.560 --> 34:09.560
That power was loud and it was feeding back in. You heard the noise yesterday and nothing now. I love it. Thank you very much for the feedback.

34:09.560 --> 34:18.560
Okay, guys, I will see you guys later and thank you very much for joining me. I'm going to play this out just because so many people seem to like it.

34:18.560 --> 34:22.560
But I might not be on again today. Just so you know.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.560
Wow, that was weird though. That dude was talking about.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.560
That dude was I'm going to get off of here before he hears me saying this.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.560
Exit.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.560
Exit Leave studio.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.560
So did you hear him?

34:38.560 --> 34:44.560
He's talking about California's secession. So just in case Homeland Security is still watching.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.560
I don't have any opinions about California's seceding from the union.

34:48.560 --> 34:52.560
And actually I think that's not the solution I would I would advocate for.

34:52.560 --> 35:02.560
So holy cow. I didn't know I was going on that show. So just be sure that you know nobody misconstrues me as thinking that California should break away.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.560
I know there are other people who think it would be great if California broke away.

35:06.560 --> 35:14.560
But I don't understand. I don't even understand that that idea. Aren't they in debt? Like it's Wow.

35:14.560 --> 35:19.560
Anyway.

35:19.560 --> 35:30.560
See you guys.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.560
California is currently insane. Now that could be bad. We could.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.560
I think we can still come together.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.560
I just don't want to be on a list. That's all. I don't want to be on a list.

35:42.560 --> 35:51.560
I think Texas should stay apart of the union. I think Pennsylvania should stay apart of the union. I think California should stay apart of the union.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.560
Yeah. You're going to call me a white nationalist because I believe in Jesus. Then that's fine.

35:56.560 --> 36:05.560
But if you're going to call me a white nationalist because I was on a radio program that wants to secede from the union. That's completely different. Don't do it.

36:05.560 --> 36:15.560
Can I be a white nationalist? I don't think I can be. Wow. Weird. Weird times, man. Weird times. Weird times. I don't get it. But we're going to keep going.
