WEBVTT

00:06.806 --> 00:09.028
Man, I gotta see if I remember how to do this.

00:09.288 --> 00:10.029
Holy crap.

00:15.935 --> 00:16.836
Am I already on?

00:16.936 --> 00:17.937
Shoot, I'm already on.

00:55.117 --> 00:59.339
After the season, the season ended, he needed a break, so he went to the beach.

00:59.439 --> 01:04.841
As he was going down the beach, going down these dunes, he saw a military group working out on the beach.

01:24.056 --> 01:26.638
maybe 10, 15 lines, something like that.

01:27.118 --> 01:30.381
Each line maybe had about 10 or 20 army guys in it.

01:30.401 --> 01:32.122
So he started to walk a little closer.

01:33.143 --> 01:36.866
As he walked closer, he could see that the guys were drenched.

01:36.886 --> 01:38.627
They had on full army fatigue.

01:38.647 --> 01:41.449
They had all their weapon gear on, helmets on.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.011
But they were wet, and they had sand all over them.

01:44.051 --> 01:44.572
And he's watching.

01:44.612 --> 01:45.232
He saw something.

01:45.252 --> 01:47.134
They had these logs in their hands.

01:47.634 --> 01:49.856
And they were holding them up over their shoulders.

01:50.942 --> 01:54.625
three, maybe six, seven minutes, something like that.

01:54.645 --> 01:59.408
Think about how long it burns to hold your hands up like that and hold them straight.

01:59.428 --> 02:00.809
And they would hold them straight.

02:01.390 --> 02:02.891
Then they would curl them like this.

02:03.251 --> 02:15.841
They would get on the ground and do sit-ups together with them, put the log down, run into the ocean, swim around a buoy, come out, roll in the sand, run down the beach, run back, and do it all over again.

02:17.021 --> 02:20.164
And this thing happened as he's walking down to the beach.

02:21.243 --> 02:23.284
maybe 10 more minutes, 15 more minutes going.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.724
Each group was doing this.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.705
Some of the sergeants, the officers, saw him sitting there.

02:28.005 --> 02:30.386
And they could recognize who the coach was, so they didn't mind him watching.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.187
Soon as he got closer, he realized something.

02:33.667 --> 02:34.728
All these guys look alike.

02:35.728 --> 02:41.090
Same height, got the same cell phone, but he thought, in football, how do I pick my starters?

02:41.430 --> 02:42.250
Who catches the ball?

02:42.971 --> 02:43.831
Who makes the tackle?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.432
Who doesn't have too many missed assignments?

02:47.159 --> 02:48.579
You know, these are things that we judge you by.

02:48.619 --> 02:49.139
Who's taller?

02:49.159 --> 02:49.800
Who's shorter?

02:50.080 --> 02:50.960
Who has the heart?

02:51.420 --> 02:53.861
But all these guys look the same.

02:53.881 --> 02:58.542
And he was thinking, how do they pick who stays and who leaves?

02:58.902 --> 03:01.922
Because it was more than what a normal military group would have.

03:02.502 --> 03:03.283
But how do they pick?

03:04.143 --> 03:05.283
So he got closer and closer.

03:06.363 --> 03:08.044
Again, some of them had boats.

03:08.224 --> 03:09.804
Some of them had things that were holding them up again.

03:10.184 --> 03:13.725
Another three, six minutes, four minutes, doing the crunches.

03:14.221 --> 03:18.523
still holding their hands out straight, doing wall sit squats in the sand.

03:19.243 --> 03:23.425
And he came to the sergeant and he said, how do you pick who stays and who goes?

03:25.466 --> 03:28.848
And the sergeant looked at him and he smiled and he said, the ones who keep their arms straight.

03:30.388 --> 03:31.189
He said, excuse me?

03:31.209 --> 03:33.710
He said, the ones who keep their arms straight.

03:34.110 --> 03:36.691
He said, you don't think we go into battle with logs and boats, do you?

03:37.452 --> 03:38.812
Bullets are flying over your head.

03:39.092 --> 03:40.053
When adversity hits,

03:40.558 --> 03:47.882
When the firecrackers start going off, grenades, the ones who can stay in line, keep their horns straight through pressure, are the ones we want.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.024
Those are the ones that are going to have your back.

03:51.044 --> 03:55.526
So when the brush of the light strikes you and they say you can't do it, when people you love doubt you,

03:56.363 --> 03:58.784
When it's fourth and one and we need a first down and we need to stop.

03:59.585 --> 04:01.345
When somebody's phone turns the ball over.

04:01.686 --> 04:06.328
When a penalty hits, you get backed up 15 more yards and you gotta keep going.

04:06.528 --> 04:12.151
When we say run one more pass, when we say run off the field, who is keeping their arms straight?

04:13.911 --> 04:19.474
When adversity outside of football hits and you have to come in here and do your job, are you keeping your arms straight?

04:20.275 --> 04:23.056
Your families will depend on you to be that type of leader, man.

04:24.878 --> 04:26.619
That's what life has to teach you.

04:27.019 --> 04:28.959
That's what Colorado football would teach you.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.660
That's what these coaches would teach you.

04:30.980 --> 04:34.801
Listen, you've heard my story a million million times before.

04:34.901 --> 04:36.422
I've been with this man 17, 18 years.

04:38.423 --> 04:39.323
Pee-wee football.

04:41.724 --> 04:44.085
How many people wanted to be next to him, wanted my job?

04:44.605 --> 04:45.825
But guess what I did they couldn't do?

04:47.186 --> 04:48.026
I kept my arms straight.

04:49.306 --> 04:50.607
I didn't worry about what people were saying.

04:50.627 --> 04:52.207
I didn't worry about what people were doing.

04:52.627 --> 04:54.208
We just told you about believing in yourself.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.017
When stuff start happening, people say you can't do it.

04:58.237 --> 05:01.538
When we face adversity this year, keep your arms straight.

05:01.838 --> 05:02.738
Do the right technique.

05:03.759 --> 05:06.019
Make the right play, make the right execution.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.580
You do that in life, nothing will ever stop you.

05:08.860 --> 05:16.902
But once you start listening to everybody else, and the whistle's coming over your head, the bullets flying by you, and you cower in the corner, people then will label you.

05:18.842 --> 05:20.742
Understand me, all it takes is one thing, and it's you.

05:21.483 --> 05:22.983
And you keeping your arms straight.

05:24.375 --> 05:27.376
Say I can, I will, I am.

05:27.496 --> 05:31.278
I can, I will, I am.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.058
I can, I will, I am.

05:33.278 --> 05:35.739
I want you to ponder that thought, think about it.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.221
We got a longer day today than we had yesterday.

05:40.081 --> 05:43.562
I need you to know you can, you will, and you are.

05:49.837 --> 06:01.306
If you're not aware that Deion Sanders took over the Colorado Buffaloes because his kids are all going to school there and his son is going to be the quarterback, you might want to check it out.

06:02.507 --> 06:12.394
It is a very unique and can often be very inspiring insight, a slice of what America is now.

06:13.535 --> 06:17.338
There's all kinds of things to feel good about what goes on.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.645
at that place right now.

06:19.685 --> 06:26.308
I think Deion Sanders is a really interesting character because he was one of the greatest athletes of all time.

06:27.088 --> 06:32.271
And he's got a lot of wisdom that comes from old people and adults in his life.

06:33.051 --> 06:42.836
He's got a lot of wisdom from being one of these dudes who really understands that working hard every day and showing up is what is important.

06:43.396 --> 06:46.298
And all of his coaches are so inspiring like that, excuse me.

06:49.725 --> 07:00.111
And what I find really cool about the whole thing is that they, they are trying to motivate a team that, that lost so many games in the past.

07:00.151 --> 07:04.633
They won the national championship, I think when I was a high school senior.

07:04.693 --> 07:05.273
So that would have been 1990.

07:07.458 --> 07:20.446
And last year, I think they only won one game and now it's like going to be this thing, you know, that they're going to try and turn it around with a new coach and a new staff and a new, and the vibe is really cool because it's very motivationally.

07:21.657 --> 07:24.921
philosophically driven that these guys have to bring it every day.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.903
And I think you would really enjoy it a lot.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.405
It's hard to find positivity.

07:30.566 --> 07:42.038
And what this guy, what this talk is about in my mind, and what's relevant to us is that there are certain people at the beginning of the pandemic that kept their arms straight.

07:43.919 --> 07:51.246
There are certain people at the beginning of the pandemic that knew that something was wrong, that something was incongruent.

07:52.567 --> 08:10.243
And then those people hit the books, they hit the papers, they asked the questions, they taught themselves or read what was necessary to read in order to make sure that they could defend their sovereignty against any challenge.

08:12.557 --> 08:22.739
and that they could stand up for what's right, rather than assuming that the truth was on television, rather than assuming that everything was being done in our best interest.

08:24.559 --> 08:30.741
There's something in that about keeping your arms straight that I think everybody needs to start to reflect on.

08:31.281 --> 08:34.741
And we have been purposefully misdirected so that we won't.

08:35.822 --> 08:40.563
That we won't go back and look at the internet archive, the actual,

08:44.161 --> 08:46.963
proof of what people were saying in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022.

08:47.063 --> 08:48.844
The actual proof of what these people were doing in 2017, 18, 19 on Facebook.

08:48.944 --> 08:56.308
And once we start to dissect these people that we thought were good people, that we thought were speaking out, that we thought were part of this

09:10.799 --> 09:18.423
crazy, interesting time that we're all involved in, we need to look back and see who kept their arms straight.

09:20.764 --> 09:39.533
Because I think if we look back and we find out and we identify the people who didn't keep their arms straight and we find them right now pretending as if they did, we can make a lot of progress in terms of finding out, finding our way out together.

09:41.701 --> 09:44.064
because I am really done playing.

09:45.426 --> 09:58.424
I'm done pretending that I'm among a bunch of people who kept their arms straight and we're gonna put our arms around each other and we're all gonna win because that's not the way it was.

10:00.145 --> 10:05.228
There were a lots of people that were afraid and said crazy things.

10:05.308 --> 10:08.630
A lot of people that were proud and said crazy things.

10:08.750 --> 10:18.796
A lot of people that were certain and said crazy things and have now come around and pretended as though they're not saying that and didn't say them.

10:18.816 --> 10:22.758
And that that's just, no, we cannot allow this to happen.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.080
We are at a crucial moment right now.

10:27.278 --> 10:40.683
where if we let this moment slip or we let these people have a free pass on this, where we're going to be in permanent danger.

10:42.923 --> 10:49.986
I cannot stress enough how important it is to reflect on whether or not the people that you trust kept their arms straight.

10:54.908 --> 10:56.108
I cannot stress it enough.

11:00.009 --> 11:01.029
I don't know if this is gonna work.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.152
Oh, it's on.

11:07.172 --> 11:08.813
They get really fired up about that.

11:09.393 --> 11:10.494
And I really like that.

11:10.554 --> 11:14.895
So again, you can see all kinds of cool things on that.

11:15.036 --> 11:16.576
It's just really motivating.

11:16.836 --> 11:20.898
And if you don't know who Deion Sanders is, what was that?

11:23.779 --> 11:25.220
Somebody trying to mess with me here.

11:26.775 --> 11:32.501
Well, we are here this morning because I think there's a lot of work to do and I think that people like

11:34.673 --> 11:59.454
Mark Kulak have been doing a lot of work while I have been doing other things and so I think it's about time first of all that I give a big plug to Mark because if you check out his last few videos I know that they don't always stay up because of their content but they're usually posted elsewhere I know you guys that follow him know how to do that you've really got to check it out because I think

12:01.332 --> 12:09.216
Again, we need to work harder at establishing who got us here.

12:10.296 --> 12:20.281
And that's why I think it's useful to go back all the way to the very beginning, the beginning of Robert Malone.

12:20.421 --> 12:28.945
And I don't think anybody is really going to object to the characterization

12:30.226 --> 12:43.978
of the Brett Weinstein podcast, the Dark Horse podcast, where Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch came out, if you will, about the RNA transfections.

12:45.118 --> 12:50.002
I think this is really a crucial moment in the Scooby-Doo narrative.

12:51.014 --> 13:00.437
And as I reflect on the Scooby-Doo narrative, when I originally came to this description, I really feel as though it was really very egoistic.

13:00.477 --> 13:02.538
You know, I'm thinking about how did they fool me?

13:04.579 --> 13:14.322
And over the last few weeks and months, I've really come to understand it, of course, in a broader perspective in how they've fooled all of us.

13:16.570 --> 13:24.980
That, I think, was most masterfully done with some very key actors and actresses.

13:26.121 --> 13:27.903
I guess you call them all actors nowadays.

13:29.932 --> 13:50.981
The actors that I'm interested in are those that have taken the spotlight at one time or another and then claimed it and held it as either inventors or crusaders or people who have spoken out very early or purveyors of misinformation.

13:51.001 --> 13:51.602
There's lots of

13:52.262 --> 13:55.404
titles that people have given themselves.

13:56.565 --> 13:58.546
The Mother of Dragons, you know, this kind of thing.

13:58.907 --> 14:08.153
But let's say the inventor of airplanes or the first person to speak out about bears, you know, this kind of thing.

14:09.174 --> 14:13.557
And so he'll just go away.

14:14.438 --> 14:15.278
Which way do I have to look?

14:15.298 --> 14:16.239
Do I have to look that way?

14:16.359 --> 14:17.260
Oh, I have to look that way.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.140
He'll go away.

14:20.686 --> 14:22.487
I really think this is going to be a lot of fun.

14:22.827 --> 14:26.089
I just... It's been a long time since I've been on.

14:26.149 --> 14:31.572
I've had a lot of... A lot of life happening, let's say it like that.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.415
And so I apologize for not being around.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.416
Oh, I wanted it to do different there.

14:38.476 --> 14:41.077
Why didn't that do... Oh, because I was on green.

14:42.618 --> 14:44.719
Still trying to work out how this works here.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.641
I'm going to fade this out.

14:48.281 --> 14:49.862
And then see if I can end that.

14:51.505 --> 14:53.307
Should be able to end the show, right?

15:00.853 --> 15:06.018
Why am I having such a goofy... It's because I'm trying to use this third screen.

15:06.078 --> 15:06.819
I apologize.

15:08.413 --> 15:18.098
I've had this ability to use the C like that, use the third screen, and I've been trying to figure out how to do it, but then I have to push an extra button to get myself back down.

15:18.158 --> 15:18.958
I don't know what I'm doing.

15:19.058 --> 15:19.759
Anyway, here we go.

15:20.279 --> 15:21.099
I'm so excited.

15:21.539 --> 15:22.420
Thank you very much.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.902
56 people joining me in the middle of the morning.

15:25.962 --> 15:26.722
It's very nice.

15:26.882 --> 15:31.264
This has to be the other mouse, but this will allow me to take notes.

15:32.705 --> 15:36.667
So hopefully I can have a little more fun with this than normal.

15:38.186 --> 15:38.267
Um...

15:44.775 --> 15:45.335
Here they are.

15:45.355 --> 15:46.095
Hey, folks.

15:46.415 --> 15:48.636
Welcome to the Dark Horse Podcast.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.516
I am Brett Weinstein.

15:50.776 --> 15:55.877
I should say, in this case, I am Dr. Brett Weinstein, and that will become relevant based on what our topic is.

15:56.137 --> 15:56.798
He's smiling.

15:56.818 --> 15:57.618
He showed his teeth.

15:57.638 --> 16:01.078
A little bit about who I am, and then I will introduce our two guests.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.839
I'm not really sure he's very comfortable, actually.

16:03.879 --> 16:04.199
Look at that.

16:04.259 --> 16:05.679
My specialty is evolution.

16:05.979 --> 16:08.400
I have some background in immunobiology.

16:09.432 --> 16:10.833
And I'm going to be acting.

16:11.334 --> 16:14.076
He has some background in immunobiology.

16:14.116 --> 16:15.517
That's an interesting claim.

16:15.577 --> 16:17.418
I've never heard him make that claim before.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.519
Wow, good for you, Brett.

16:18.599 --> 16:19.980
I wonder what that background is.

16:20.140 --> 16:27.466
Today in the role of professor sometimes, student other times, traffic cop, and translator.

16:27.566 --> 16:36.372
That's my plan in order to get this very complex story simple enough that people can understand it because it is of the utmost importance.

16:37.338 --> 16:37.718
All right.

16:37.918 --> 16:48.646
Oh, so you hear Brett is already positioning himself as somebody who's uniquely qualified to make these very complex issues accessible to you, useless eaters.

16:49.507 --> 16:54.810
Just not saying he's trying to insult us, you know, but I mean, he's positioning himself really.

16:54.831 --> 17:00.795
I use very big words and make very long sentences, but I can dumb it down for you.

17:01.684 --> 17:04.245
which I've never really, anyway.

17:04.325 --> 17:21.992
One other thing I should say is that there is also a final role for me, which is that when I was a graduate student, I did some work on telomeres, senescence, and cancer, and accidentally unearthed a flaw in our drug safety system that as far as I know still exists, despite my effort to raise the alarm about it.

17:22.132 --> 17:29.955
So anyway, this is not the first time I have encountered the drug safety issue, and it is a thorny and wicked problem, as some might say.

17:30.695 --> 17:32.476
To my right, we have Robert Malone.

17:32.616 --> 17:36.419
Robert Malone is an MD, PhD?

17:36.719 --> 17:37.560
No, Master's.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.401
Master's and MD.

17:39.421 --> 17:47.027
He is also, and most significantly here, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology from back as a graduate student, am I correct?

17:47.327 --> 17:49.589
Yeah, and I'm also a licensed physician in Maryland.

17:49.889 --> 17:51.170
A licensed physician in Maryland.

17:51.530 --> 17:56.114
And to my left is Steve Kirsch, who is a serial entrepreneur.

17:56.815 --> 18:03.520
And actually, you want to tell us about your role in COVID treatment research?

18:03.800 --> 18:04.000
Sure.

18:04.080 --> 18:14.149
I started the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, and we fund scientists throughout the world on looking at repurposed drugs for outpatient clinical trials.

18:14.870 --> 18:23.017
And because using repurposed drugs is the fastest, safest, and lowest cost way to end the pandemic.

18:24.557 --> 18:25.378
All right, excellent.

18:25.478 --> 18:29.602
So I must say that this is a difficult topic for us to address.

18:30.063 --> 18:38.471
We all, I believe, are agreed that something very serious is afoot and the public is largely unaware that they have been placed into a kind of danger.

18:38.752 --> 18:45.459
And we also know that there's a great... We all, I believe, are agreed that something very serious is afoot and the public is largely unaware

18:46.159 --> 18:55.346
that they have been placed into a kind of danger, and we also know that there's a great deal of stigma directed at those who would explore these dangers.

18:56.067 --> 19:07.916
I know that I personally feel a certain amount of jeopardy over talking about these things publicly, but I also feel a moral obligation to do so in light of the fact that I believe in my heart of hearts that a great many lives are at stake.

19:08.837 --> 19:13.060
There's just simply no question that come hell or high water, this must be discussed.

19:13.340 --> 19:15.442
I would imagine you gentlemen feel similarly?

19:16.809 --> 19:24.175
Yeah, I'm particularly concerned by all the censorship because it's making so that we cannot have a rational discussion.

19:25.496 --> 19:26.717
Cannot have a rational discussion.

19:26.737 --> 19:29.339
I think it's a very fair way to put it.

19:30.200 --> 19:35.364
I should also point out that our viewers will have noticed that we are sitting here unmasked.

19:35.665 --> 19:42.651
And I should point out that actually we are, in an interesting sense, a model of something that I believe is not on the public radar.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.732
So if I'm correct, you, Robert, have had COVID.

19:47.032 --> 19:49.812
I've had COVID, and I've been fully vaccinated with Moderna.

19:50.032 --> 19:50.372
All right.

19:51.132 --> 19:53.413
Steve, you have been vaccinated.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.713
Fully vaccinated with Moderna.

19:55.993 --> 19:56.313
All right.

19:56.513 --> 19:59.674
I am unvaccinated, but I am on prophylactic ivermectin.

20:00.014 --> 20:11.776
And the data actually, shocking as this will be to some people, the data suggests that prophylactic ivermectin is something like 100% effective at preventing people from contracting COVID when taken properly.

20:12.316 --> 20:17.277
So aside from the risk that possibly the ivermectin I got wasn't real.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.738
I am sorry.

20:21.779 --> 20:26.120
You know, sometimes these kinds of things really, they're hard to process when they're happening.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.401
I hope you just heard that and I hope you understand how significant it is.

20:30.861 --> 20:32.322
They started with censorship.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.322
We are unmasked.

20:35.082 --> 20:38.703
Two people are fully vaccinated and I'm using a 100% effective prophylactic

20:42.298 --> 20:52.884
which means that we are all participating in something that's really not on the public's radar, but you can survive and live together.

20:52.964 --> 21:04.950
And, and strangers can, can interact if they're fully vaccinated with Moderna, or if you're like me and you know, the secret weapon is just prophylactic use of ivermectin.

21:05.490 --> 21:06.971
Holy crap.

21:07.431 --> 21:08.392
Are you kidding me?

21:10.768 --> 21:12.689
I didn't even have to work for five minutes.

21:17.671 --> 21:19.071
I can almost start crying.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.893
I can't believe I haven't taken the time to come back and watch this movie.

21:26.174 --> 21:33.517
You might think that I'm faking this, but actually it's been a very, very, very long on a list of things to do.

21:33.637 --> 21:35.217
Mark has been telling me to watch it.

21:35.237 --> 21:37.138
He's been sending me these clips and notes.

21:38.595 --> 21:46.818
but from the middle of this three hours, not from the very beginning where they started off with everything, where they started off with everything.

21:47.238 --> 21:50.459
So everybody, what month is this?

21:50.879 --> 21:51.579
Holy shit.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.741
What month is this?

21:55.421 --> 21:56.981
Hold on, I gotta get it.

21:57.802 --> 22:00.262
I don't know, maybe I made a mistake here by using two.

22:03.143 --> 22:04.244
What month is this?

22:05.544 --> 22:07.145
This would have been what, in June?

22:08.342 --> 22:09.342
When did they do this?

22:11.823 --> 22:12.903
Does somebody know when?

22:12.923 --> 22:15.184
Oh my gosh.

22:16.484 --> 22:17.564
You gotta be kidding me.

22:17.584 --> 22:19.044
I don't even need to watch the rest.

22:19.144 --> 22:20.125
I don't know when this was.

22:20.185 --> 22:21.885
I think it was June of 2021.

22:23.805 --> 22:25.946
I mean, someone can tell, right?

22:27.166 --> 22:27.446
June, 2021.

22:28.666 --> 22:28.907
Right.

22:28.987 --> 22:30.667
So June 11th, even.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.167
So think about this.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.348
How many people have already had the shot then?

22:37.025 --> 22:37.666
Think about this.

22:37.726 --> 22:39.547
How many people have already had this shot?

22:39.587 --> 22:41.689
How many people have already been injured by the shot?

22:41.709 --> 22:45.152
How many old people have just had a stroke two weeks later?

22:45.172 --> 22:46.714
Wow, darn, sorry.

22:49.936 --> 22:53.319
These guys aren't coming out before the shot was rolled out.

22:53.379 --> 22:56.482
You see, the shot is already in the process of being rolled out.

22:56.802 --> 22:58.544
They're already lowering the age.

22:59.024 --> 23:03.008
And these guys got on there and said, I'm really upset about the censorship.

23:05.373 --> 23:08.895
Remdesivir has been used for like almost a year already.

23:12.437 --> 23:13.737
I'm fully vaccinated.

23:13.797 --> 23:15.158
He's fully vaccinated.

23:15.338 --> 23:17.259
And, and, or no, he's fully back.

23:17.279 --> 23:18.039
He's fully bad.

23:18.139 --> 23:19.820
I I'm using ivermectin.

23:19.880 --> 23:28.725
And if you use it appropriately, if you know the Freemason secret weapon way of using ivermectin by putting it between your toast

23:31.701 --> 23:34.884
then you, you can also prevent COVID.

23:35.244 --> 23:39.728
So there are ways that you can hang out with your friends without masks indoors.

23:40.109 --> 23:42.050
And we're going to tell you how to do it.

23:42.511 --> 23:44.092
And what is the title of this?

23:44.593 --> 23:46.094
Three Simple Steps.

23:46.735 --> 23:48.136
Holy crap.

23:49.758 --> 23:51.320
Why would we need to do anything else?

23:51.360 --> 23:58.571
Shouldn't I just stop the stream and start it again so that this is separate from the rest of the ranting that I'm not even going to get?

23:58.591 --> 24:03.278
How am I going to get through three hours of this if I haven't even gotten through four minutes?

24:05.322 --> 24:08.163
Do you see how clearly clear this is?

24:08.223 --> 24:10.404
Do you see how clear this is?

24:10.884 --> 24:11.564
Censorship?

24:12.104 --> 24:13.184
Look at this, this is all the notes.

24:14.105 --> 24:15.065
This is all the notes.

24:15.865 --> 24:17.186
All the notes I've been able to take.

24:17.306 --> 24:19.426
Censorship first is what they started with.

24:19.466 --> 24:20.647
We are unmasked.

24:20.847 --> 24:24.928
Notice, ladies and gentlemen, we are unmasked.

24:25.959 --> 24:30.260
Let us tell you the secrets to how you too can be unmasked.

24:30.900 --> 24:36.021
You and your family and friends can enjoy a real unmasked existence.

24:36.101 --> 24:48.763
If you follow these simple rules, be fully vaccinated with Moderna or learn the secrets to the prophylactic application of ivermectin and the prevention of infection.

24:49.603 --> 24:51.664
Holy crap.

24:52.484 --> 24:53.384
Holy crap.

24:57.441 --> 24:58.863
I have every reason to think it was.

24:58.943 --> 25:02.508
It certainly appears to be the genuine article.

25:03.349 --> 25:12.021
I believe that what we have here is a demonstration of a kind of composite herd immunity through three different routes, COVID, vaccine,

25:12.661 --> 25:33.748
and ivermectin we are protected and you are that's fair doubly protected so i would just say that for anybody who's enthusiastic about the vaccines if you're malone is doubly protected because he had covid and then he was smart enough as an immunologist to think well since i've had it already i might as well get the shot as if that was exactly what we did with measles for example

25:35.620 --> 25:39.223
Interview some old lady and you say, hey, have you been vaccinated to measles?

25:39.283 --> 25:41.966
I said, well, I had it when I was a kid Oh, we should vaccinate you.

25:42.006 --> 25:45.789
Anyway, they don't do that They don't do that.

25:45.849 --> 25:54.637
It's the primary counter indication of not needing the vaccine as if you've had it already And yet as a master

25:55.569 --> 26:14.769
as one of the guru level guys with regard to vaccination, because he's been peddling vaccinations between governments and non-governmental organizations like the WHO and CEPI and others for decades, running around behind the scenes at those conferences, all that stuff.

26:14.809 --> 26:15.810
That's Robert Malone.

26:17.321 --> 26:28.378
is here telling us that despite having the disease, he decided to get fully vaccinated with Moderna anyway, fully knowing, I guess, that he would never do that for any other.

26:28.398 --> 26:31.442
Holy, what is going on here?

26:33.188 --> 26:37.589
Four minutes and 24 seconds, and I've already wasted 25 minutes.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.810
I mean, I'm sorry, guys, this is gonna be, you might as well get your popcorn.

26:41.010 --> 26:43.691
We're unconvinced by what we have to say about the hazard of them.

26:44.151 --> 27:01.176
One thing to consider is that the way to get society to herd immunity and therefore drive COVID-19 to extinction, which ought to be our goal, the way to do it is to get people into this category one way or the other, whether that's through prophylaxis, whether it's through a vaccine, or whether it's because they've had COVID already.

27:01.835 --> 27:04.056
Okay, I'm sorry, how much farther do we need to go?

27:04.116 --> 27:05.156
These guys are all wrong.

27:07.097 --> 27:16.061
They were all wrong and they all went on and they shouted fire in the theater and then they did this.

27:18.662 --> 27:23.084
They essentially poured concrete around the narrative.

27:23.996 --> 27:25.117
in most people's heads.

27:25.718 --> 27:27.379
People saw this three hours.

27:27.399 --> 27:34.326
It was the first time they sat down and watched anything for more than three hours except for a series like Game of Thrones.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.247
Are you kidding me?

27:38.590 --> 27:43.334
Do you not see how a perfect enchantment this is?

27:45.997 --> 27:47.799
How many people have watched it since?

27:48.700 --> 27:50.381
How many people saw it a month later?

27:50.421 --> 27:51.602
How many people heard about it?

27:51.762 --> 27:52.603
Six months later?

27:52.663 --> 27:53.683
Do you understand?

27:54.904 --> 28:00.348
This is a psychological nuclear bomb right here, except it exists.

28:00.568 --> 28:01.169
It's real.

28:01.269 --> 28:02.650
It's right here to see it.

28:03.130 --> 28:04.551
You can, you can review it.

28:05.111 --> 28:11.916
You can rewind the explosion and you can listen to what it did to your brain.

28:13.410 --> 28:32.636
Because even though you now know that would be ridiculous to say, it would be ridiculous to say we are demonstrating a kind of, a kind of hybrid herd immunity because between him being fully vaccinated and previously infected, right?

28:39.793 --> 28:40.693
I'm a little shaky.

28:40.733 --> 28:41.374
Sorry about that.

28:41.454 --> 28:42.614
And previously infected.

28:42.654 --> 28:49.477
And then Steve Kirsch is fully vaccinated and Brett is on a prophylactic regimen of ivermectin.

28:49.857 --> 29:01.322
They are demonstrating how you and your family can achieve an unmasked existence, a closed quarters, unmasked existence that, that almost resembles the old normal.

29:04.841 --> 29:06.102
Holy crap.

29:08.164 --> 29:16.532
One could argue that if everybody just took ivermectin for a month worldwide we would end the pandemic.

29:16.733 --> 29:20.616
Some will find the title that I have given this episode perplexing.

29:21.317 --> 29:27.383
I would ask them to stick with the episode through the end and I will explain why I titled it as I did.

29:27.403 --> 29:29.045
I really believe that actually

29:29.645 --> 29:39.948
we have the capacity at any moment we decide to utilize it to end the pandemic and that it is well within reach should we choose to see what is in front of us.

29:40.088 --> 29:41.868
But we will get there later on.

29:42.908 --> 29:47.330
It's kind of like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz that she always had the ability to go back to Kansas.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.210
We've always had the ability to end this pandemic.

29:50.250 --> 29:53.131
It's just a question of whether we want to use it or not.

29:53.351 --> 29:56.214
Well, actually, I'm going to push back slightly on you, Steve.

29:56.655 --> 30:02.901
I was actually going to inquire from my friends who are closest to this, but I didn't get to it before the podcast.

30:02.921 --> 30:08.407
But I believe we probably have had the ability to end the pandemic at any point in the last six months that we chose to.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.691
I'm not sure it goes all the way back because I'm not sure we would have known what to do.

30:13.204 --> 30:19.926
Yes, we've had the drugs available and then the know-how we developed late last year.

30:21.046 --> 30:28.088
Okay, so if you'll let me, my pushback as a molecular virologist and physician and outbreak specialist.

30:29.669 --> 30:35.010
I think that herd immunity is a noble cause and objective.

30:36.175 --> 30:43.657
But if you look worldwide, um, I, I think that we kind of have to plan that we're unlikely to achieve it.

30:44.057 --> 30:48.838
So I, I, I. So keep in mind when this is, this is June 21.

30:49.078 --> 30:51.578
So we're already through the winter.

30:52.999 --> 30:58.260
We've already gone through winter time and Christmas break with the college kids.

30:59.417 --> 31:10.063
where Richard Ebright said on Twitter that if we open the colleges in the fall of 2020, we're gonna kill a quarter million college kids.

31:11.123 --> 31:17.407
Then he kind of flipped it around and said, well, by the end of the year, there's gonna be 200,000 people dead because the college kids will spread it around.

31:18.536 --> 31:23.761
then we get to June and now we've rolled out these vaccines.

31:24.302 --> 31:35.212
We've done dances on late night shows and all of the, even the Saturday Night Live skit about the boomers got the vax.

31:36.013 --> 31:46.959
is all about how the old people got the best vaccines and the things that are left over are for the people that aren't as old as them because they rolled it out like that.

31:47.439 --> 31:54.303
And so they were kind of like making fun of how the really good stuff like Moderna, like they're talking about here.

31:54.403 --> 31:57.024
We go with, got double bags with Moderna, the best one.

31:57.044 --> 32:01.166
I mean, he's the smartest guy, so he chose Moderna.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.747
So it must be the best one, right?

32:05.066 --> 32:11.870
And so now we're in June and they're trying to get from the elderly to the 50 year olds like these guys are to the 40 year olds.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.972
And they're convincing them that this is a good strategy to get out.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.313
Now, Brett hasn't taken it.

32:18.933 --> 32:22.896
Some people in the chat are making the point, do we really know that he's taken it?

32:23.776 --> 32:30.460
I think it's very likely that that guy over there took it, but we don't really know if any of these guys took it.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.501
As far as we know,

32:33.479 --> 32:35.360
The main game here is lying.

32:36.301 --> 32:43.247
So if it is really just saying you're fully vaccinated to be fully vaccinated, I would be happy to lie.

32:43.867 --> 32:55.396
If they're in their shoes and there's a gun, you know, just maybe there's somebody with a pistol right over here behind Steve's head.

32:55.937 --> 33:00.640
Or maybe there's a pistol under the table at the hip of Robert Malone.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.321
I don't know.

33:02.363 --> 33:05.624
but it's lying, lying is not a big deal.

33:07.264 --> 33:20.368
And I think that we have to come to the realization that something is going on here and it is incongruent for this guy to be, what did he call himself?

33:20.988 --> 33:30.591
Sorry, I'm gonna go back because he does state his many, many, let's say, expertises or whatever.

33:32.572 --> 33:42.897
I didn't get to it before the podcast, but I believe we probably have had the ability to end the pandemic at any point in the last six months that we chose to.

33:42.997 --> 33:46.179
I'm not sure it goes all the way back because I'm not sure we would have known what to do.

33:47.709 --> 33:49.170
Yes, we've had the drugs.

33:49.551 --> 34:02.800
OK, so Brett puts down the idea that at some point we knew and we could have figured it out, but we somehow hampered it with censorship and with not allowing these repurposed drugs.

34:02.820 --> 34:06.583
I'm not sure really where he's going, because then Steve says, yeah, we've had the drugs.

34:07.084 --> 34:10.906
So the idea is, again, we've identified drugs that work.

34:11.327 --> 34:12.548
Presumably, Steve

34:13.228 --> 34:14.592
keep pointing the wrong way.

34:14.653 --> 34:18.244
Presumably Steve is thinking, is it, is it?

34:20.703 --> 34:25.566
fluvoxamine or whatever one he was working on, or is it famotidine or is, what is it?

34:25.927 --> 34:33.432
One of these drugs that we're doing clinical trials on, because again, he's got a foundation that's looking at repurposed drugs.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.834
And then here comes, let's see what his qualifications are again.

34:37.034 --> 34:37.534
Available.

34:37.955 --> 34:42.077
And then the know-how we developed late last year.

34:42.097 --> 34:42.598
Right.

34:42.898 --> 34:43.258
Yeah.

34:43.278 --> 34:43.418
Okay.

34:43.438 --> 34:50.223
So if you'll let me, my pushback as a virologist, a molecular virologist and physician and outbreak specialist.

34:51.827 --> 34:57.182
I think that herd immunity is a noble cause and objective.

34:58.326 --> 35:02.707
But if you look worldwide, I think that... Sorry, I missed it.

35:02.747 --> 35:03.627
I was reading the chat.

35:03.647 --> 35:05.587
I was reading the chat.

35:05.607 --> 35:12.368
Yes, we've had the drugs available and then the know-how we developed late last year.

35:12.388 --> 35:12.908
Right.

35:13.509 --> 35:27.471
Okay, so if you'll let me, my pushback as a molecular virologist and physician and outbreak specialist, I think that... So, herd immunity is a noble cause and objective.

35:28.547 --> 35:34.909
He's a virologist, molecular virologist, physician, and outbreak specialist.

35:34.989 --> 35:35.810
It's pretty impressive.

35:36.930 --> 35:44.432
But if you look worldwide, I think that we kind of have to plan that we're unlikely to achieve it.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.474
So I applaud the logic.

35:49.221 --> 35:51.181
I think the probability is really high.

35:51.221 --> 35:58.083
There's no way pragmatically we're going to get there and we're going to be stuck with this virus in various forms for the rest of our lives.

35:58.143 --> 35:58.423
All right.

35:58.483 --> 35:59.343
Well, here's the thing.

36:00.563 --> 36:04.544
We're not going to get bogged down here because it's not the central reason for our conversation.

36:04.804 --> 36:16.367
I do want to have that conversation with you at some point because I believe what I'm doing is I'm probably butchering the term herd immunity by arguing that somebody who's on prophylactic ivermectin is within the herd.

36:17.087 --> 36:25.792
But in any case, I believe that it is possible based on at least the Argentina study, which suggests essentially 100% effectiveness of ivermectin.

36:26.013 --> 36:27.513
So he plugged it twice now.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.775
Brett has plugged ivermectin twice.

36:29.835 --> 36:36.739
We're not talking about him having taught himself anything relevant to the treatment of respiratory disease.

36:37.807 --> 36:51.657
We're not talking about him understanding the basics of how respiratory disease has been categorized before 2020 and how it was changed in 2021 or going forward from 2020.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.941
So notice how strict they are here.

36:57.161 --> 36:58.782
They're not teaching you anything.

36:59.966 --> 37:22.522
In fact, they're outlining a very specific and almost irrelevant narrative, given what we know now, which is the huge percentage of iatrogenic deaths that were probably caused by not treating secondary pneumonia correctly, by using remdesivir and assuming that that didn't cause any side effects.

37:24.520 --> 37:32.503
And so the deaths that have happened up until this point where we're watching this video are not all COVID already.

37:32.923 --> 37:34.744
And we already knew that.

37:36.845 --> 37:41.227
And people were fighting and losing their career because they already knew that.

37:41.327 --> 37:44.308
And yet that has not been mentioned at all yet.

37:46.581 --> 37:53.427
but instead we're talking about ending the pandemic was possible, maybe not right at the beginning, but very soon afterward.

37:54.208 --> 38:00.414
And we could end it at least earlier than we have because we have the drugs and we have the know-how.

38:00.895 --> 38:03.877
There is, we needed to know other things.

38:04.298 --> 38:10.784
And the Argentina study proves that ivermectin is one of those things that once we discovered it, we could have used it.

38:12.435 --> 38:23.122
And so again, ivermectin completely overwrites the role that remdesivir plays in terms of all cause mortality.

38:23.142 --> 38:31.387
It overwrites the role that these protocols that we've been enacted here for already a year and four months.

38:35.194 --> 38:39.996
See this for what it is, please, because these are the people that we need.

38:41.056 --> 38:42.817
This is the way that we get out of this.

38:46.098 --> 38:48.459
Because you notice that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

38:48.519 --> 38:49.599
is not at this table.

38:50.279 --> 38:53.080
You notice that Peter McCullough is not at this table.

38:53.481 --> 38:55.962
You notice that Ryan Cole is not at this table.

38:57.222 --> 38:59.643
You notice that Pierre Kory is not at this table.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.444
You notice a lot of people are not at this table.

39:03.277 --> 39:07.098
And before this, there was no one but me.

39:09.439 --> 39:13.880
And a lot of other people that were standing up about certain things.

39:15.861 --> 39:18.602
Very few people standing up about natural immunity.

39:18.782 --> 39:23.583
Very few people standing up about the transfection.

39:23.723 --> 39:32.766
Very few people had written a review asking us to pause with the transfections because of their potential dangers.

39:34.016 --> 39:34.336
I did.

39:36.238 --> 39:37.659
And is Brett sharing it here?

39:39.201 --> 39:41.242
Is Brett talking about it here?

39:41.322 --> 39:44.185
Is he, is he, is he promoting it on any podcast?

39:44.805 --> 39:45.026
No.

39:46.487 --> 39:55.675
He's on here right now in June of 2021, a month after I wrote my review that he's well aware of and was well aware of why I was writing it.

39:57.817 --> 39:58.958
He's here doing this.

40:00.719 --> 40:01.500
Think about this.

40:05.367 --> 40:06.568
I have to think about it for a minute.

40:06.608 --> 40:08.910
Hold on a second, I might be telling a bullshit there.

40:10.651 --> 40:12.392
The years are all smeared together.

40:13.793 --> 40:16.475
I have to look at the review to make sure that it was then.

40:16.496 --> 40:19.258
Yeah, it was really May 2021.

40:20.298 --> 40:22.240
No shit, excuse my language.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.824
It's just sometimes really hard for me to believe that this is all part of the same thing.

40:29.145 --> 40:31.147
And I remember it now as I sit here and

40:32.307 --> 40:38.769
I was actually really excited that these guys came out and started talking about the fact that the shot might not work as expected.

40:40.069 --> 40:44.091
But now I'm looking at it and I'm realizing that, wait, they're not even saying that.

40:45.151 --> 40:54.694
They're saying that it can work, that it often does work, but then now they're going to say something, I guess, like it sometimes doesn't work.

40:54.794 --> 40:58.395
I'm, aren't you having a revelation here too?

41:00.265 --> 41:06.549
I mean, look, I can show you it's, it's, it's, it's right here.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.591
I mean, here's the review.

41:10.893 --> 41:20.119
Transfections not are not vaccine stop transfections now written by Jonathan Cooley and Piper Stover on May 18th, 2021.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.361
I mean, I don't, and this is June, 2021.

41:31.465 --> 41:41.053
Do you not see what's happening here when you realize that these guys started this with the big message that we've got a way for you to spend time without masks?

41:41.093 --> 41:42.774
No, Brett is the one who said it.

41:42.854 --> 41:45.216
The bandana man is the one who said it.

41:45.876 --> 41:50.120
You'll notice that we are all here without masks and we don't live together.

41:51.401 --> 41:56.005
Of course, Heather and him can be without masks because they live together, but these guys are strangers.

41:56.025 --> 41:58.867
They're coming into my home without masks on.

42:00.882 --> 42:04.964
And the reason why is because they've been anointed by Moderna.

42:06.204 --> 42:06.624
Wow.

42:06.644 --> 42:10.766
I totally agree with you.

42:11.066 --> 42:11.526
We're good.

42:11.626 --> 42:14.027
We're quibbling and it's off-score.

42:14.067 --> 42:29.213
What you're saying is that from a practical point of view, but my point is that if we were able to, just like we're trying to kind of get everybody to take the vaccine, if we had put that into getting everybody to take ivermectin and fluvoxamine for a month,

42:30.498 --> 42:40.507
If so, essentially we got, if we only have one choice now, holy crap, Steve just said, you know, we're going to try and get everybody to take the vaccine.

42:40.627 --> 42:45.331
But if we could have got everybody to take ivermectin for a month, it would have been the same thing.

42:45.371 --> 42:46.272
Did you hear it?

42:47.754 --> 42:48.614
Did you hear it?

42:51.177 --> 42:54.520
What I'm talking about, ladies and gentlemen, is keeping your arms straight.

42:54.660 --> 42:56.842
Are these guys keeping their arms straight?

43:01.069 --> 43:15.007
Does it sound like three men that are interested in the well-being of our children and grandchildren, the freedom and sovereignty of our grandchildren, does it sound like they've got the right concerns in their mind with their smiles on their face?

43:18.929 --> 43:22.150
And if we could accomplish that, then COVID would be wiped out.

43:22.451 --> 43:22.971
We could do it.

43:23.091 --> 43:29.493
And actually, any municipality that could regulate its borders could clear the disease if it could accomplish that goal, I believe.

43:29.934 --> 43:34.676
And it's just a question of, you know, practically speaking, we agree with you, Robert.

43:34.856 --> 43:37.477
It's practically speaking, it's hard to pull off.

43:37.577 --> 43:40.198
I'm saying that theoretically, if we could get agreement

43:41.311 --> 43:42.954
Because we have... Well, how about this?

43:43.154 --> 43:43.875
Let's table this.

43:44.036 --> 43:46.500
I will give you my plan at the end of this.

43:46.580 --> 43:48.723
And my claim is that actually there is a way to do this.

43:48.763 --> 43:50.506
We just have to think a bit outside the box.

43:50.526 --> 43:50.727
Okay.

43:51.169 --> 43:53.630
never seen so much of Robert's eyes before.

43:54.150 --> 44:04.835
But let me just say that, Steve, I became aware of you after reading your article on Trial Site News in which this is actually kind of a living article.

44:05.235 --> 44:06.235
Good point.

44:07.516 --> 44:09.517
They still have not talked about the tests.

44:09.637 --> 44:11.758
Of course, they're talking about ending the pandemic.

44:12.458 --> 44:37.150
but they haven't once addressed the role that the application of a nonspecific PCR test to asymptomatic people, thousands of them in drive-throughs, drove the illusion of the pandemic, drove the illusion that allowed them to change the protocols of how they treated people with respiratory disease, allowed them to apply remdesivir in hospitals.

44:39.651 --> 44:41.552
They're not acknowledging any of this yet.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.500
Knowing that most people won't get to the third hour.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.682
What does that really mean to you?

44:53.055 --> 44:56.398
which you've been updating it as information has come to light.

44:56.778 --> 45:09.108
And I must say this article, I'm always troubled by the loss of the useful term red pill by people who have borrowed it for various purposes that I don't think are legitimate.

45:09.128 --> 45:12.590
But this article functions as a red pill.

45:12.610 --> 45:17.694
You read this and either something's wrong with you, Steve, and you've completely misportrayed the data.

45:18.775 --> 45:29.681
there's no problem and something's up with you, or if the data is anything like what you present, then the interpretation is quite clear and absolutely startling.

45:30.161 --> 45:37.986
So I will just say, I believe that what you've pointed to is accurate and alarming.

45:38.366 --> 45:43.989
Does anyone else find it interesting that when talking to Steve,

45:45.703 --> 45:51.331
and Steve is listening, that Steve is nodding his head and his eyes are moving and he's listening to Brett.

45:52.415 --> 45:55.518
And when Robert Malone is listening, he's not moving at all.

45:55.558 --> 45:56.519
Does anyone else notice this?

45:56.539 --> 45:57.200
Understatement.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.102
I would invite people to look at it for themselves.

46:00.343 --> 46:02.925
I would invite people to show it to others.

46:03.125 --> 46:09.131
And most importantly, I would invite them to pay very close attention to what is said in response.

46:09.611 --> 46:12.054
You will get a lot of pushback when you show this article to people.

46:12.094 --> 46:15.056
But that pushback is not substantive, in my experience.

46:15.357 --> 46:16.538
It's emotional.

46:16.858 --> 46:17.178
Crickets.

46:17.819 --> 46:26.522
Well, you either get crickets or you get some kind of squid ink phenomenon where a bunch of ink shows up and suddenly the person you're talking to is nowhere to be seen.

46:26.802 --> 46:29.163
I think the term for a lot of the blowback is gaslighting.

46:29.943 --> 46:33.025
Well, that hasn't happened yet, I think.

46:33.565 --> 46:37.546
So we haven't been gaslighted yet, says Steve Kirsch in June of 2021.

46:37.646 --> 46:40.807
We haven't been gaslighted yet.

46:41.468 --> 46:45.209
What are they doing if they started this podcast

46:46.573 --> 46:58.216
What are they doing if they started the podcast with, we're teaching you a secret about how to become unmasked, and that secret involves being fully vaccinated, previously infected, or using prophylactics like ivermectin?

47:00.276 --> 47:06.377
And now he just stated, he just stated that we haven't been gaslighted yet.

47:07.318 --> 47:13.139
I mean, the feedback that I've gotten is... I think the term for a lot of the blowback is gaslighting.

47:13.925 --> 47:16.227
Well, that hasn't happened yet, I think.

47:16.787 --> 47:26.596
I mean, the feedback that I've gotten is they'll look at it for about 30 seconds and say, I don't believe this, and it's the cognitive dissonance.

47:27.537 --> 47:34.002
It's the people who took the blue pill and are living in the matrix, and everything is good, and this is

47:35.043 --> 47:37.185
this can't possibly be true.

47:37.725 --> 47:39.206
And they immediately write it off.

47:39.627 --> 47:43.650
But they can't cite anything that is wrong with it.

47:43.670 --> 47:45.191
They can't argue any of the points.

47:45.511 --> 47:51.035
And they'll delve into ad hominem attacks and say, oh, well, this was written by an engineer.

47:51.095 --> 47:52.796
He doesn't know anything.

47:53.397 --> 47:54.538
And to me, that's a victory.

47:54.958 --> 47:57.839
Because it says that everything I've written they can't argue with.

47:58.260 --> 48:03.862
So the only thing left to attack is to try to attack the person when you can't attack the arguments.

48:03.902 --> 48:04.843
And that's what people do.

48:05.563 --> 48:11.946
And I would just say that, you know, looking at a complex puzzle like this, one needs some kind of tools.

48:11.966 --> 48:12.226
I mean,

48:12.666 --> 48:16.669
Undoubtedly, in what you've written, there are things that aren't going to turn out to be right.

48:16.789 --> 48:17.309
Undoubtedly.

48:17.329 --> 48:22.453
You've just written so broadly that, you know, with being such a large live issue.

48:22.493 --> 48:28.997
Does it sound like that Brett is working to kind of tone down Steve's enthusiasm?

48:29.518 --> 48:32.820
Nobody's responded to Steve at this point about the VAERS reports.

48:33.401 --> 48:38.144
Nobody's responded to Steve about other things that he's going to rant about later.

48:39.950 --> 48:44.494
And Brett is saying, well, you're inevitably going to be wrong about some of these things, though, Steve.

48:44.514 --> 48:46.015
You're going to have to admit that, right?

48:47.256 --> 48:49.698
I hear something very interesting here, actually.

48:50.779 --> 48:51.960
Undoubtedly, there are errors.

48:52.040 --> 48:58.625
But the point is, even if you read this thing and you say, what if what he's saying is 50% right, right?

48:59.606 --> 49:03.329
It's still so alarming that, effectively, the response would have to be the same.

49:03.409 --> 49:04.510
Something has gone wrong.

49:04.550 --> 49:06.372
We are in danger, and we are not

49:06.852 --> 49:08.314
We're not behaving rationally.

49:08.354 --> 49:12.859
And you can detect where we are not behaving rationally in numerous places that I hope we will get to.

49:13.359 --> 49:23.129
But do you want to outline the basics, like the bullet point, you know, the top 10 bullet points that people ought to be aware of that you're calling attention to in your article?

49:26.092 --> 49:34.240
It's it's so hard because it's it's it's just this unbelievable story and and let me just tell you how it works Okay, sure.

49:34.280 --> 49:50.674
So it got started when my carpet cleaner came and and he was wearing a mask I said, hey, we're all vaccinated you can take it off and He said, you know, I just got I I got the Pfizer vaccine and I had a heart attack two minutes later and

49:51.559 --> 49:55.481
And so he spent the night in the hospital and he says, you know, he's kind of recovering from it.

49:55.621 --> 49:57.122
And I said, how are you, how are you doing now?

49:57.142 --> 50:00.763
And he said, you know, still, you know, feeling bad about it.

50:01.003 --> 50:12.669
And he mentioned also that his wife also her hand, she'd, you know, hold a glass like this and her hand would be shaking like this and the water would be coming out and she was perfect before.

50:13.209 --> 50:19.652
So I have two people, we'd have very few people in my house because of COVID.

50:20.753 --> 50:25.015
So the fish guy the carpet cleaner and the house cleaner, right?

50:25.456 --> 50:48.871
And so to have not just one person but him and his wife I mean that's like that is like lightning striking twice in the same place So and so if it was really a safe vaccine, then what I just saw was impossible So that's kind of what triggered me off on this and then I had been on this Canadian a physician's call with dr Byron brittle

50:49.631 --> 51:08.906
and he showed this chart and he said normally when you vaccinate someone, the vaccine goes in the shoulder and it stays in the shoulder area and what happens is the antibodies are generated and they attack this antigen in the shoulder and it wipes it out and we're good.

51:09.406 --> 51:17.136
But what Byron Brittle did is he did a FOIA request to the Japanese government to look at the biodistribution data.

51:17.497 --> 51:22.503
And what he discovered is that it doesn't stay in the shoulder where we all thought it should stay.

51:22.944 --> 51:24.566
It goes throughout your entire body.

51:24.806 --> 51:26.188
It goes to your brain, to your heart.

51:26.388 --> 51:27.369
So that's two problems.

51:28.150 --> 51:32.112
One problem is it isn't where it's supposed to be ideally.

51:32.152 --> 51:37.234
Where we thought it was for all the previous vaccines.

51:37.274 --> 51:52.341
And the other problem, and this is your area of expertise, is that what these vaccines do is they encode spike protein alone so that the immune system will learn to recognize spike protein and will catch it quickly when one is confronted with COVID.

51:52.810 --> 51:56.644
But the spike protein itself, we now know, is very dangerous.

51:56.704 --> 51:57.547
It's cytotoxic.

51:57.788 --> 51:58.692
Is that a fair description?

52:00.061 --> 52:05.823
More than fair, and I alerted the FDA about this risk months and months and months ago.

52:06.383 --> 52:07.484
And we had a discussion about it.

52:07.584 --> 52:16.167
And to be fair, the FDA did not think that the S1 subunit and the spike protein was toxic.

52:16.507 --> 52:20.669
And so they knew, the FDA knew about the biodistribution.

52:21.249 --> 52:25.531
And one of the scary things is that the biodistribution like peaks in your ovaries.

52:26.491 --> 52:35.854
And so, so just to, so he says that the FDA, so Brett understands how the vaccine is supposed to work.

52:36.074 --> 52:45.056
The transfection works, but he doesn't really understand that it's a transfection.

52:45.096 --> 52:46.577
You can hear him talking that way.

52:47.597 --> 52:51.398
And Steve says that the, the FDA knew

52:54.955 --> 53:01.780
that the spike was distributed throughout the body, but didn't know that the spike was toxic.

53:07.324 --> 53:14.970
I got to just write this down because we're moving very fast here and I don't want to summarize it yet, but I want to, I can't catch up with these guys this quick.

53:14.990 --> 53:15.290
Sorry.

53:15.310 --> 53:16.351
Hold on one second.

53:18.012 --> 53:20.334
The virus distribution was varied, but

53:25.888 --> 53:34.653
Not that the spike was toxic.

53:34.713 --> 53:50.062
So I guess this is really right on the narrative that I was saying at this time as well, which was that if there was an engineered something, it would have been the spike protein engineered to produce seroprevalence.

53:50.122 --> 53:53.764
And engineering that to work would also make it dangerous.

53:54.551 --> 54:01.133
Because it's an immunogen that the, that the, the immune system can't help, but pay attention to.

54:01.233 --> 54:09.795
And this will be inevitably something that will have consequences we don't understand when you do it in the context of transfection.

54:09.875 --> 54:14.476
So it's not just a foreign protein, but it's a foreign protein juiced up.

54:16.117 --> 54:16.577
And so.

54:18.700 --> 54:27.582
I find that very interesting because he mentions Byron Brittle, which again, remember that Brett never has Byron Brittle on his podcast after this.

54:27.662 --> 54:37.405
So Byron Brittle is still a guy who's, sorry, Byron Brittle is a guy whose career is still being burnt.

54:38.245 --> 54:40.266
I got to keep all of my things in my head straight.

54:40.306 --> 54:43.667
I don't know how Mark Housatonic does what he does with all these names and stuff.

54:43.707 --> 54:44.847
It must be very,

54:46.059 --> 54:49.722
Um, it must make everything a little more solid in your mind.

54:49.802 --> 55:00.771
If you organize that website of his and, and organize all those links and, and, and organize that archive, then maybe all these names and stuff stay together, but Byron brittle.

55:01.491 --> 55:13.176
The guy who exposed the distribution of the lipid nanoparticle after having FOIAed information from the Japanese government is still having his career destroyed.

55:13.716 --> 55:26.241
He still has to be very careful in Canada with what he does and how he does it because of the fact that he's still considered an out of the out group.

55:26.481 --> 55:29.882
And Brett Weinstein has never talked to him.

55:31.710 --> 55:39.355
And there, and Steve is very excited to mention it to him, but then Brett is always, you know, calming everybody down.

55:39.395 --> 55:40.976
Okay, so that's two different things.

55:41.016 --> 55:44.237
The first thing is that it's not where we said it was.

55:44.338 --> 55:45.678
Don't mention Byram again.

55:47.159 --> 55:56.765
Don't accentuate this hero in Canada who spoke out, but go back to sort of, you know, being the referee here, Brett.

55:58.396 --> 55:59.456
Don't mention that again.

55:59.476 --> 56:05.499
And then he explains how it's supposed to work and that the spike protein is toxic.

56:05.539 --> 56:06.940
Is that an accurate thing?

56:07.000 --> 56:09.240
And then Malone says, yes, it is.

56:09.681 --> 56:15.203
And then Steve clarifies and says that the FDA knew that the biodistribution was varied.

56:16.257 --> 56:18.678
but they didn't know that the spike protein was toxic.

56:18.718 --> 56:20.899
That's a very, I mean, where are we?

56:20.939 --> 56:25.801
We're 14 minutes into this and we have fully vaccinated.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.382
People don't need masks anymore.

56:27.422 --> 56:28.402
We have that.

56:28.442 --> 56:30.563
There were other ways that you didn't need masks.

56:30.603 --> 56:34.625
We could have used a prophylactic treatment like ivermectin and ended the pandemic too.

56:36.546 --> 56:38.287
And something's gone terribly wrong.

56:39.318 --> 56:44.279
but my carpet cleaner and his wife both reacted bad to the shot, but our whole family didn't.

56:44.880 --> 56:57.903
And so they're laying down this narrative, which is wide open that you could drive a truck through that says, oh, the lots are different because his family's fine, but his carpet cleaner and his wife got sick.

56:58.344 --> 57:00.764
So it's not people, but it's lots.

57:01.524 --> 57:02.925
And the lots are all different.

57:03.902 --> 57:09.308
And of course, we know that that narrative came up very soon after this, that the lots were different.

57:09.368 --> 57:18.840
And so that's why there were some reactions and some people, which might be true, but it's secondary to the fact that these guys are still selling it.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.081
If it works, it's great.

57:20.642 --> 57:24.046
If you get one of those bad lots though, or if you don't get Moderna.

57:25.333 --> 57:34.299
Do you hear all the, this is 15 minutes in and they've already laid down all of these subconscious clues about what the way out is.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.542
The subconscious clues about what they have chosen as experts.

57:39.923 --> 57:42.324
As smart people, they realize something's wrong.

57:42.364 --> 57:43.285
Now, what are they doing?

57:43.325 --> 57:47.628
Well, you know, Brett, the smart of the smart is using ivermectin as a prophylactic.

57:49.009 --> 57:49.329
Wow.

57:49.629 --> 57:50.850
It's, it's extraordinary.

57:52.526 --> 57:54.327
to nail the point home.

57:54.667 --> 57:55.208
They did know.

57:56.008 --> 57:56.529
They did know.

57:56.829 --> 57:58.270
I did send them the manuscripts.

57:59.030 --> 58:02.052
So, and, and their determination was.

58:02.713 --> 58:03.794
It's a harmless spike protein.

58:03.834 --> 58:10.258
That they didn't think that that was sufficient documentation of the risk that spike was biologically active.

58:10.458 --> 58:10.558
Right.

58:10.578 --> 58:11.719
They did not believe.

58:11.739 --> 58:22.286
So that's curious because he might be talking about the two papers, which I think Mark has already covered, but he's definitely brought them to my attention as well as the Bregan's bringing them to people's attention.

58:23.147 --> 58:28.635
That Robert Malone wrote a couple manuscripts with a guy by the name of David Rick or Rica Ricky.

58:30.538 --> 58:32.180
And these manuscripts describe.

58:33.243 --> 58:49.013
why immunization to the spike protein might not be ideal, might lead to antibody-dependent enhancement, and also some paper about how the cytokine storm tumbling out of control might also be caused by the spike protein.

58:49.553 --> 58:52.955
These two papers were both written very early in 2020.

58:53.876 --> 58:56.017
And so he said, I sent them manuscripts

58:57.128 --> 59:06.657
But he's not explicitly saying, hey, if you want to understand, if you're a scientist out there, I know, Brett, your audience is very, very sophisticated.

59:07.037 --> 59:15.505
Anybody who wants to know more, I've got two papers up on ResearchGate or two papers on BioRxiv, which describe why this shot might be.

59:15.685 --> 59:16.846
He's not saying that.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.630
Maybe he'll say it in a few minutes.

59:21.414 --> 59:22.814
The spike was biologically active.

59:22.834 --> 59:23.695
That was the big mistake.

59:23.715 --> 59:26.375
We now know the spike protein is very dangerous.

59:26.415 --> 59:27.416
Very dangerous.

59:27.436 --> 59:28.376
We also know.

59:28.456 --> 59:40.700
So if it was very dangerous, but it did what the brochure on these vaccines says it should do, which is lodge in the membrane of the cells that are doing the transcribing, it would be a lot less destructive, right?

59:43.456 --> 59:45.438
I think that's fair, and you're right.

59:45.538 --> 59:49.641
It's not just the documentation about the vaccine.

59:49.941 --> 59:50.742
Are you hearing this?

59:51.142 --> 59:57.247
That if the spike protein wasn't as toxic, that the RNA transfections would be working better.

01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:06.634
I can't even believe that I'm discovering this all.

01:00:06.674 --> 01:00:12.339
I have to almost apologize to Mark for this, because Mark has been trying to get me to watch this again for so long.

01:00:13.595 --> 01:00:14.676
I just can't believe it.

01:00:14.756 --> 01:00:16.557
We're 15 minutes into it.

01:00:16.597 --> 01:00:20.860
As far as I'm concerned, this was like a fool's mate in chess.

01:00:21.821 --> 01:00:23.702
They've already revealed it all.

01:00:24.102 --> 01:00:34.029
There's no other reason why this podcast in the first 15 minutes would have gone in these directions with these words, unless that wasn't the plan.

01:00:34.049 --> 01:00:37.231
You don't think that they just sat down and said, let's go.

01:00:38.012 --> 01:00:39.273
Let's see where this takes us.

01:00:40.393 --> 01:00:41.054
Are you kidding me?

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:52.942
It's the prior literature that was put out by the people that developed it, that developed these clones.

01:00:53.302 --> 01:00:59.903
So they were aware that there was a risk of Spike being biologically active.

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:00.404
Did you hear that?

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:01.944
And having adverse events.

01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:03.084
Did you hear that?

01:01:03.104 --> 01:01:04.525
He did not stay stuck.

01:01:04.805 --> 01:01:05.605
They were aware.

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:17.748
that there was a risk of a spike being biologically active and having adverse events if it did not stay stuck to the cells that were transfected that got the RNA and made it.

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:28.391
And they used a genetic engineering method of putting a transmembrane domain on it to ensure... Wait, we've got to go a little bit farther back.

01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:30.752
...a spike being biologically developed.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.369
that developed these clones.

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:34.089
See?

01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:35.190
Did you hear it?

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:43.535
They were aware that there was a risk of a spike by the people that developed it, that developed these clones.

01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:48.258
So they were aware that... I don't even know what to say.

01:01:48.298 --> 01:01:48.939
He just said it.

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:50.700
Developed these clones.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.322
He's using... Holy cow.

01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:05.508
You understand why I'm talking about holding your arm straight in the beginning, why I played that clip.

01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:12.172
If you didn't see the beginning of the stream after we're done, please go back and watch the beginning of the stream.

01:02:14.353 --> 01:02:21.096
If you can't see it clearly now, if we can't use this to help people see clearly now, I don't know what else to say.

01:02:25.919 --> 01:02:28.580
But these are not straight armed men right here.

01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:45.738
And unfortunately, I don't think that their arms are bent because they're tired or they're exhausted or the censorship beat them down to the point where they just couldn't keep their arms straight anymore and they buckled under the pressure.

01:02:46.299 --> 01:02:47.119
They're smiling.

01:02:47.159 --> 01:02:47.999
They're excited.

01:02:48.019 --> 01:02:51.781
They think they're right.

01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:55.242
They're certain they're going to be okay.

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:58.584
Don't you see it?

01:02:58.784 --> 01:02:59.384
I see it.

01:03:01.087 --> 01:03:03.344
Thank you Mark for making me watch this video.

01:03:03.919 --> 01:03:15.084
There was a risk of a spike being biologically active and having adverse events if it did not stay stuck to the cells that were transfected that got the RNA and made it.

01:03:16.424 --> 01:03:25.788
And they used a genetic engineering method of putting a transmembrane domain on it to ensure that it stayed anchored and stayed put.

01:03:26.648 --> 01:03:32.271
And they did limited non-clinical studies to say,

01:03:33.231 --> 01:03:34.452
Looks like it stays stuck.

01:03:34.693 --> 01:03:36.435
We engineered it to stay stuck.

01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:36.975
They did.

01:03:37.215 --> 01:03:38.937
And they published that.

01:03:39.197 --> 01:03:39.838
Here's the thing.

01:03:39.918 --> 01:03:40.539
Special engineered.

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.440
Okay.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:47.967
Is that that's generally not good enough in a non-clinical data package.

01:03:48.808 --> 01:03:55.295
So before we get a product released to use in humans, in the normal situation where we're not in a rush,

01:03:56.502 --> 01:03:59.805
we have some really rigorous tests that have to be done in animals.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:14.836
And, um, revealing that spike gets cleaved off of express cells and becomes free is something that absolutely should have been known and understood well before this ever gotten put into humans.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:15.856
So I'll just leave it at that.

01:04:16.357 --> 01:04:16.597
All right.

01:04:16.617 --> 01:04:18.759
Well, that's, so what, that's the smoking gun.

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:19.799
Let me, uh,

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.101
Just make one thing clear.

01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.284
You said it very clearly, but lots of people who aren't familiar with this aren't going to get it.

01:04:25.944 --> 01:04:33.771
Do you see the eyes of Steve Kirsch looking at Robert Malone when he says that's the smoking gun?

01:04:35.813 --> 01:04:38.315
It's like they just threaded the needle.

01:04:39.431 --> 01:04:41.572
This is exactly what we wanted to say.

01:04:41.632 --> 01:04:43.373
Wow, that was really spontaneous, man.

01:04:43.853 --> 01:04:44.333
Wink, wink.

01:04:44.373 --> 01:04:45.634
We did that really well.

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:48.055
We got this conversation right there.

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:48.615
Wink, wink.

01:04:48.695 --> 01:04:49.435
Watch, please.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:50.656
I'm sorry.

01:04:50.676 --> 01:05:00.660
So the RNA gets so free is something that absolutely should have been known and understood well before this ever gotten put into humans.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:01.660
So I'll just leave it at that.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:02.420
All right.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.621
Well, that's so what that's the smoking gun.

01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:04.921
Let me, uh,

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:07.924
Just make one thing clear.

01:05:07.984 --> 01:05:10.827
You said it very clearly, but lots of people who aren't familiar with you.

01:05:10.987 --> 01:05:13.430
Did you see it?

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.132
Did you see it?

01:05:15.172 --> 01:05:16.493
Watch.

01:05:16.693 --> 01:05:21.439
It's almost like Steve was waiting for the cue to say, that's the smoking gun.

01:05:23.301 --> 01:05:25.563
And Robert said, I'm going to leave it at that.

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:28.927
And then Steve gets a little nervous.

01:05:28.987 --> 01:05:30.749
And then he says, that's the smoking gun.

01:05:30.769 --> 01:05:31.990
And then he's like, see, I said it.

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.971
I remembered to say it.

01:05:33.452 --> 01:05:36.114
Listen, sorry if I'm hallucinating.

01:05:36.134 --> 01:05:41.239
It would have been known and understood well before this ever gotten put into humans.

01:05:41.259 --> 01:05:42.220
So I'll just leave it at that.

01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:42.961
All right.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.182
Well, that's so what.

01:05:44.242 --> 01:05:45.163
That's the smoking gun.

01:05:45.223 --> 01:05:45.524
Let me.

01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:48.486
Just make one thing clear.

01:05:48.526 --> 01:05:50.967
You said it very clearly, but lots of people who aren't familiar with this.

01:05:51.067 --> 01:05:52.628
Why is he smiling like that?

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:53.988
RNA gets into the cell.

01:05:54.308 --> 01:05:57.050
It is translated by the ribosome into a protein.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:00.811
In this case, it's the spike protein, which is the best target on the coronavirus.

01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:01.672
We could debate that.

01:06:01.912 --> 01:06:02.212
Go ahead.

01:06:02.352 --> 01:06:03.373
But it's at least a very good one.

01:06:03.453 --> 01:06:03.934
It's a prominent one.

01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:05.035
Yeah, it's a good target.

01:06:05.115 --> 01:06:05.775
Nobody argues with that.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:13.583
And if the antibodies grab onto it, the most likely thing to happen is that they will block it from doing what it does that facilitates the entry into the cell.

01:06:13.823 --> 01:06:17.027
So if everything works the way the brochure says, it's a good target.

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:20.190
After about five days, though, the antibodies have to be- Okay, hold on.

01:06:21.051 --> 01:06:25.235
So the whole reason to use an adenoviral vector, an mRNA,

01:06:26.454 --> 01:06:28.155
is not just to generate antibodies.

01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:30.557
I don't understand why he's having so much fun.

01:06:31.537 --> 01:06:33.819
Why is he having so much fun?

01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:37.261
If everything works the way the brochure says, it's a good target.

01:06:37.381 --> 01:06:42.444
After about five days, though, the antibodies have to be... Hold on, hold on, he says.

01:06:42.464 --> 01:06:48.428
The whole reason to use an adenoviral vector, an mRNA, is not just to generate antibodies.

01:06:49.169 --> 01:06:52.111
And a lot of the data, and a lot of us that are deep in this data,

01:06:52.915 --> 01:06:57.958
think that the way that they're really providing the protection is by cellular cytotoxicity.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.339
So you're getting CTLs against it.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:09.525
And that's the reason to use this gene therapy based technology is not just to generate neutralizing antibodies, but to generate cytotoxic de-lymphocytes.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:23.473
Okay, you and I are about to go down the rabbit hole because this is biologically fascinating, which I want to avoid doing, but you just said the reason to use the adenovirus vector, which is with the DNA vaccines, not the RNA vaccines, which is what we were talking about.

01:07:23.593 --> 01:07:25.815
I would, I would call it, it's not a DNA vaccine.

01:07:25.855 --> 01:07:27.375
It's an ad vector vaccine.

01:07:28.076 --> 01:07:28.276
Right.

01:07:28.316 --> 01:07:30.277
It's a, it's a not, it is the use of the.

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:33.079
So it's not a DNA, but it's got DNA in it.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.122
I think he's just trying to make sure that we get on the narrative.

01:07:39.182 --> 01:07:43.545
Make sure you're using the right terms here, Dark Horse Podcast host.

01:07:44.225 --> 01:07:47.868
Let me get everybody on the same rail here.

01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:49.809
Steve's not on the rail yet.

01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:51.450
He needs correcting too.

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:54.632
A recombinant virus, which happens to be a DNA virus.

01:07:54.792 --> 01:07:54.972
Yeah.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:56.813
But it's the same basic idea.

01:07:56.933 --> 01:08:00.015
It's a recombinant virus that happens to be a DNA virus.

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:02.337
So what you said before was totally correct.

01:08:02.837 --> 01:08:04.538
But let's call it an adeno vector.

01:08:05.674 --> 01:08:06.434
Do you hear this?

01:08:07.935 --> 01:08:09.116
Are you hearing this?

01:08:10.496 --> 01:08:12.017
Please tell me you can hear this.

01:08:12.337 --> 01:08:13.998
Gene therapy technology advector.

01:08:14.018 --> 01:08:21.242
The reason to use the adenovirus vector, which is with the DNA vaccines, not the RNA vaccines, which is what we were talking about.

01:08:21.422 --> 01:08:23.163
I would call it, it's not a DNA vaccine.

01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.724
It's an advector vaccine.

01:08:25.424 --> 01:08:25.804
Right.

01:08:25.944 --> 01:08:30.427
It is the use of the- A recombinant virus, which happens to be a DNA virus.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:30.787
Yeah.

01:08:30.987 --> 01:08:32.328
But it's the same basic idea.

01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:34.669
It's gene therapy technology applied to vaccines.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:39.853
It's the same technology and everything downstream of the translation of the spike protein is the same.

01:08:39.873 --> 01:08:40.313
Spike protein?

01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:41.594
Yeah.

01:08:41.614 --> 01:08:42.415
It is the same.

01:08:42.635 --> 01:08:51.943
And by the way, so it's the same whether you use DNA to make RNA to make the spike or whether you use RNA to make the spike.

01:08:52.924 --> 01:08:53.805
It's all the same.

01:08:54.125 --> 01:09:00.190
If you use an adenovirus shell to carry it in, Brett was about to argue.

01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:16.688
I don't know if you were feeling it, but Brett was about to argue that the adenovirus vaccines, because of their nature of using DNA to change the way or change the proteins that are expressed in a cell, because it's an adenovirus vector,

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:29.390
In some ways, it might call in a T cell response and teach a cytotoxic T cell response that the transfection would not do with the lipid nanoparticle and mRNA.

01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:31.932
And Robert cut him off.

01:09:34.473 --> 01:09:38.675
This was one of the main reasons why a lot of people were cheering for the

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:43.184
the AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson shots.

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:49.227
And it was one of the reasons why people like immunologists were debating about which one would be the better one.

01:09:50.508 --> 01:09:58.352
There were people who were saying that, well, you might end up building immunity to the adenovirus shell instead of to the protein that is supposed to make.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:19.543
And then there were other people who were making the argument, no, by taking it in with a viral shell, you're more likely to activate the innate antiviral immune response, which will call in a more appropriate T cell response, which could generate a more reliable cytotoxic T cell response.

01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:22.605
That's what Brett was about to say.

01:10:23.046 --> 01:10:26.948
And Robert interrupted him and said, no, no, no, don't say that it's DNA.

01:10:27.368 --> 01:10:28.869
Don't make such a big deal about it.

01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:29.710
It's an advector.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.531
It's all the same thing.

01:10:31.631 --> 01:10:33.572
Once you get to the spike, it's all the same.

01:10:34.853 --> 01:10:37.674
Did you hear it?

01:10:41.656 --> 01:10:44.998
We have no problems at all with mRNA vaccines.

01:10:45.478 --> 01:10:45.638
Right.

01:10:45.698 --> 01:10:57.985
It's just this particular vaccine because of the spike protein and because it breaks, it cleaves off the cell and it goes throughout your body and your brain, your heart, anywhere.

01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:07.151
that you can have these symptoms that are so varied, whether it's a 16-year-old who can't... What matters is when this was said.

01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:08.912
It doesn't matter what he's saying now.

01:11:08.952 --> 01:11:10.193
It matters when this was said.

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.835
This was June 2021.

01:11:13.756 --> 01:11:15.737
More than enough people had said, don't do it.

01:11:16.598 --> 01:11:17.759
More than enough people.

01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:21.121
Peter McCullough had already said, don't do this.

01:11:22.382 --> 01:11:24.283
Peter McCullough had already called it out.

01:11:26.004 --> 01:11:26.765
Are you kidding me?

01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:31.712
If it's not obvious now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what to say.

01:11:31.772 --> 01:11:34.193
We are one hour and eight minutes into this.

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:37.014
In my mind, I could stop it right here.

01:11:37.974 --> 01:11:50.659
There's nothing else to see except for these guys digging a deeper hole and making a more beautiful sandcastle, which when you view it from above, says that these guys were part of it.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.041
Because that's all that I see here.

01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:58.122
Somebody's playing somebody, maybe.

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:12.255
My guess is, unfortunately, that Steve Kirsch is being played by the other two guys, but he thinks that him and Malone are playing Brett Weinstein, and that's how this works.

01:12:13.555 --> 01:12:15.376
That's how you get people sucked in.

01:12:17.217 --> 01:12:22.459
You tell Brett Weinstein that I need your help with reining in

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:33.023
this entrepreneur named Steve Kirsch, who's all fired up about Remdesivir, and all fired up about the shot, and he's seen a ghost, and we've gotta rein him in.

01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:45.806
And then Robert Malone says to Steve Kirsch, hey, let's go on, you go on Bret Weinstein's show with me, and make sure that Bret stays on task.

01:12:45.866 --> 01:12:51.708
And these are the things that we wanna say, that the spike protein is really bad, but mRNA shots are okay,

01:12:52.850 --> 01:13:01.175
And so we're gonna get some, I'm gonna orchestrate somewhere in there and we're gonna make sure that we say that the spike protein is the smoking gun.

01:13:03.517 --> 01:13:16.705
And then now you're watching that play out where two guys are interacting with a third dude who has convinced each of those two guys that they're cooperating with him against the third guy.

01:13:18.046 --> 01:13:20.128
That's what I see here, plain as day.

01:13:22.034 --> 01:13:23.435
It's extraordinary to me.

01:13:25.456 --> 01:13:32.379
It is absolutely extraordinary to me that it took me this long to watch this video again.

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:34.480
And it's in a way very good.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:47.085
Because the longer we waited, the more likely it was that we would see the stark contrast and the stark incongruencies that were almost certainly much more difficult to see at the time.

01:13:48.166 --> 01:13:50.747
It almost seemed like my review

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:55.447
asking to pause the transfections was making a difference.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:14:00.375
That this guy had come out and started to say that it's bad and I was still...

01:14:01.633 --> 01:14:08.795
wholly unaware of the way that the narrative could be twisted so that, okay, you're saying transfection is bad.

01:14:09.095 --> 01:14:18.818
Well, we're gonna get these two guys on Brett Weinstein to say that I'm RNA and transfection is fine, but it's what we, the spike protein that we put into it.

01:14:19.238 --> 01:14:28.641
The weird thing is, is that Mark Housatonic, Mark Kulak, sent me an article where Robert Malone is commenting in a couple different

01:14:29.281 --> 01:14:40.889
newspapers about the death of some guy who they were trying to fix with a genetic defect by using transfection with adenovirus vectors, whatever he said to call them.

01:14:41.889 --> 01:14:42.830
And the guy died.

01:14:45.952 --> 01:14:50.315
So it's not like he doesn't know that this stuff can go south really fast.

01:14:53.032 --> 01:14:55.753
But he's still saying it in a dishonest way.

01:14:55.793 --> 01:14:58.714
He's still saying that it's the spike protein, probably.

01:14:58.774 --> 01:14:59.994
I think that's accurate.

01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:01.975
And who fed that to him?

01:15:02.675 --> 01:15:03.175
Brett did.

01:15:04.655 --> 01:15:05.216
Do you see?

01:15:05.236 --> 01:15:09.137
He has worked these two, it feels like.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:13.778
I'll give you a set of cues, and I want you to work with me to get these on.

01:15:13.818 --> 01:15:17.419
And then in the other room, he said to Steve, I have these cues.

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.200
I want you to work me on and get these in.

01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:22.033
and help me to convince Brett.

01:15:22.053 --> 01:15:23.753
You help me to convince Steve.

01:15:25.094 --> 01:15:26.914
And they both think that they're in on it.

01:15:26.954 --> 01:15:31.576
They both think they're the secret guy helping Robert.

01:15:32.617 --> 01:15:33.517
That's what I see here.

01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:44.347
I mean, we already know that Brett Weinstein was somehow controlled or briefed or brought into this as part of the intellectual dark web.

01:15:44.788 --> 01:15:57.675
That's why he had Sam Harris on his stream in December of 2019 saying that there will be a time when there's a pandemic, when we won't be able to tolerate anti-vaxxers anymore.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:02.249
Bret Weinstein has been in on this from the very beginning.

01:16:02.289 --> 01:16:06.791
That's also why he is the pseudo champion of the lab leak thing.

01:16:06.851 --> 01:16:08.991
And we said it first and yada, yada, yada.

01:16:09.432 --> 01:16:10.532
This is all part of that.

01:16:10.552 --> 01:16:13.093
This is mid show right here.

01:16:13.993 --> 01:16:15.874
This is June, 2021.

01:16:16.334 --> 01:16:23.777
He's already sitting in this skeptic King camp, you know, where, well, at least we're skeptical enough.

01:16:23.797 --> 01:16:24.757
We didn't take it yet.

01:16:24.817 --> 01:16:26.458
That's what he represents at the table.

01:16:28.055 --> 01:16:30.696
and pushing ivermectin at least three times already.

01:16:33.796 --> 01:16:45.579
Talk or see 48 hours after injection or someone who's, you know, handshakes or someone who's, you know, my carpet cleaner, Tim, he's like disabled now.

01:16:45.799 --> 01:16:49.299
He's lost $30,000 in terms of his costs.

01:16:49.719 --> 01:16:52.500
And he's going in for an epidural because he's in such pain.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:17:02.027
And so these side effects, the victims of this vaccine, they're not being able to tell their story at the press.

01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:06.291
Because Tim says, I try to tell my story and the press ignores him.

01:17:06.651 --> 01:17:10.274
And we have these groups that

01:17:11.455 --> 01:17:19.780
Aren't able to get attention aren't able to get attention a large group of people who believe that they have suffered Negative consequences was removed from Facebook.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:32.306
So there's very a large group of people that believe they have suffered negative consequences very specific language clearly an effort to 200,000 users just wiped off the right planet, right?

01:17:32.426 --> 01:17:39.030
If there's so Steve is kind of fighting for things and saying things like he's seen it Whoa, like he's seen a UFO

01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:41.131
I kind of like Steve here.

01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:43.473
Oh, if this is a perfectly safe vaccine.

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:46.535
So the censoring has been going on for well over a year.

01:17:46.735 --> 01:17:47.836
It's well documented.

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.017
It's unequivocal.

01:17:49.477 --> 01:18:02.007
And my argument is that, um, by implementing censoring, what we're doing is making it so that signals can't be detected.

01:18:02.607 --> 01:18:04.469
People's voices can't be heard.

01:18:05.569 --> 01:18:07.531
And I, I'm, I'm of the opinion.

01:18:08.131 --> 01:18:13.475
that we have to have free and open discussion, and we have to have full disclosure of risks.

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:16.538
And when you censor that, you cannot have that.

01:18:16.598 --> 01:18:21.122
Yeah, it changes everybody's mindset into believing it's safe and effective.

01:18:21.142 --> 01:18:26.446
And when you have that, you don't report these adverse events as being associated with it because you eliminate it.

01:18:26.466 --> 01:18:28.828
You don't want to be the fly in the ointment of a great vaccine.

01:18:28.868 --> 01:18:30.369
No, you don't think it's possible, right?

01:18:30.409 --> 01:18:33.212
So when a doctor sees a miscarriage,

01:18:33.832 --> 01:18:40.876
and says, I've never seen a baby like this in my entire career where it's so bloody and the brain is split in half and so forth.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.677
She's never seen anything like it.

01:18:43.158 --> 01:18:48.401
And the woman was vaccinated a month ago, and she's 25 weeks pregnant.

01:18:48.761 --> 01:18:55.505
When you have that sort of thing, the doctors... I want you to watch him listen versus watching him listen.

01:18:57.051 --> 01:19:07.142
It's through the whole video, but just keep in mind as you circle back, watch these three guys as they interact and as they listen to one another.

01:19:13.028 --> 01:19:15.851
And so they say, well, it must be a genetic defect.

01:19:16.211 --> 01:19:18.013
And they report it as a genetic defect.

01:19:18.433 --> 01:19:20.615
And they don't even report it into the virus system.

01:19:20.935 --> 01:19:26.921
So we never see any of these safety signals because everybody is trained to think that it's safe.

01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:28.042
It couldn't have been a vaccine.

01:19:28.062 --> 01:19:28.222
Yeah.

01:19:28.262 --> 01:19:29.763
So that's this group think problem.

01:19:30.023 --> 01:19:31.945
And I think it is a real problem.

01:19:32.326 --> 01:19:33.246
Here's what they're going to say.

01:19:33.907 --> 01:19:34.507
And I want to

01:19:35.496 --> 01:19:38.138
work out how this functions, right?

01:19:38.539 --> 01:19:44.663
So that's a groupthink problem, and that's a real big problem, but he doesn't talk about what the problem was again.

01:19:44.763 --> 01:19:46.985
What is the problem that Steve was talking about?

01:19:47.926 --> 01:19:51.729
That people don't expect the transfection to hurt people.

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:56.833
So without that expectation, when people get hurt, they don't make the correlation.

01:19:58.004 --> 01:19:59.364
And Brett says, yeah, that's group.

01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:01.945
I mean, Robert says, yeah, that's groupthink.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:02.726
That's a problem.

01:20:03.206 --> 01:20:07.667
No, the problem is, is that people don't expect the transfection to hurt them.

01:20:08.447 --> 01:20:09.608
Not groupthink.

01:20:10.788 --> 01:20:11.468
Did you see it?

01:20:12.529 --> 01:20:13.229
Did you see it?

01:20:14.589 --> 01:20:17.870
This is Jedi master level interjection here.

01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:21.472
That's why he's not nodding his head and whatever.

01:20:21.532 --> 01:20:22.592
He's not listening.

01:20:24.059 --> 01:20:29.961
He's actively counteracting in his head what needs to be said next.

01:20:30.001 --> 01:20:30.882
That's what I see here.

01:20:30.902 --> 01:20:31.222
I don't know.

01:20:31.302 --> 01:20:43.987
I could be wrong, but it leaves me with a very dubious feeling with regard to what's going on here, because it's not a very spontaneous conversation for Robert.

01:20:44.007 --> 01:20:44.947
It doesn't appear to be.

01:20:46.488 --> 01:20:48.248
It's extraordinary what I see here.

01:20:48.588 --> 01:20:50.229
This is a sliver of time.

01:20:53.979 --> 01:21:05.764
June 11th, 2021, where three men are purported to have several different ways that we could end the pandemic in three simple steps.

01:21:07.265 --> 01:21:22.072
We are not even 20 minutes into a podcast where they told us that they were demonstrating what people can do if they follow the rules or if they find biologically plausible alternatives to those rules and stick to them.

01:21:24.022 --> 01:21:29.181
double vaccinated with Moderna or prophylactic use of Ivermectin.

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:32.579
story.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:42.866
Hey, I, Steve, talked to a couple people who came through my house in various capacities and heard an alarmingly large number of stories that were very frightening.

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:47.129
Now, everybody at this table will agree that could be anecdotal.

01:21:47.349 --> 01:21:48.070
It's totally anecdotal.

01:21:48.090 --> 01:21:49.050
It's not even anecdotal.

01:21:49.331 --> 01:21:51.612
It could be the result of sampling error.

01:21:51.712 --> 01:21:52.613
Oh, absolutely.

01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:57.696
And so the point is, how do you detect if something like that isn't sampling error?

01:21:58.056 --> 01:22:01.899
So it could be sampling error, but he's making a big deal about it.

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.140
It might not have been a UFO, but I'm pretty sure it was a UFO.

01:22:08.801 --> 01:22:11.841
Could have been something else, but I think it was a UFO.

01:22:14.002 --> 01:22:16.462
Does that sound like somebody who's holding his arms straight?

01:22:19.183 --> 01:22:20.904
Guys, I'm asking you a question.

01:22:20.944 --> 01:22:24.064
Does that sound like a guy who's holding his arms straight?

01:22:26.385 --> 01:22:26.905
I don't hear it.

01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:30.454
find out what other people are saying.

01:22:30.474 --> 01:22:31.694
Yes, you can look for confirmation.

01:22:31.754 --> 01:22:35.675
And at the same time that you were having your experience, I was having a slightly different experience.

01:22:35.876 --> 01:22:40.837
I was talking to every single person that I interact with, which is definitely not a random sample of people.

01:22:40.917 --> 01:22:45.539
On the other hand, we're talking about the woman who cuts my hair, my doctor,

01:22:46.221 --> 01:22:52.708
I was talking to everybody I encountered and I was asking them, my dentist, I asked them, what was your experience?

01:22:52.749 --> 01:22:53.549
Did you get vaccinated?

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:53.750
Yes.

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:55.091
What was your experience?

01:22:55.452 --> 01:23:00.037
And the number of people who had a frightening story was alarmingly large.

01:23:00.137 --> 01:23:05.223
In fact, I believe it is the case that the only people who didn't have some anomalous reaction

01:23:05.663 --> 01:23:09.847
were my parents and Heather's mom, which may be because older people have these things less.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.189
That may be sampling error.

01:23:11.349 --> 01:23:11.810
I don't know.

01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:16.474
But the point is, there were stories that didn't sound like any vaccine I've ever heard of.

01:23:16.554 --> 01:23:23.762
People who had weeks of fire-like pain in their arm, headaches that would not go away, fevers,

01:23:24.062 --> 01:23:30.792
So I'm a regulatory professional and I do talk to the FDA.

01:23:30.812 --> 01:23:32.695
Eye contact with the camera.

01:23:32.715 --> 01:23:34.898
And I have friends there in senior positions.

01:23:34.938 --> 01:23:35.298
Wow.

01:23:37.543 --> 01:23:45.349
they were aware back when we were doing, is that like a, and I have good, is that like the rarest thing you've ever seen?

01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:55.296
So I, I'm a regulatory professional and, and I do talk to the FDA and I have good friends there in, in senior positions.

01:23:57.818 --> 01:23:58.659
They were aware

01:23:59.488 --> 01:24:05.530
back when we were doing randomized clinical trials that- Do you believe him?

01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:06.871
Is that what that is?

01:24:07.331 --> 01:24:08.431
Do you believe him because of that?

01:24:08.451 --> 01:24:15.574
They were a military professional and I do talk to the FDA and I have good friends there in senior positions.

01:24:18.115 --> 01:24:18.955
They were aware

01:24:19.795 --> 01:24:27.160
back when we were doing randomized clinical trials, that these adverse events were occurring.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:36.246
Many of them were oddly delayed and atypical for a vaccine trial.

01:24:37.447 --> 01:24:39.228
This is totally- Oddly delayed.

01:24:39.448 --> 01:24:41.529
I don't know why you would call it oddly delayed.

01:24:41.569 --> 01:24:45.212
He's supposed to be the guru level expert

01:24:46.584 --> 01:24:49.225
Yet he doesn't understand why they would be oddly delayed.

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:52.185
Because maybe autoimmunity takes a little while to develop.

01:24:53.365 --> 01:24:58.347
Maybe because the toxic effects of a transfection takes a little while to develop.

01:24:58.407 --> 01:25:06.768
It's a little more variable depending on where it goes and what tissues are expressing the toxic protein or the fragments thereof.

01:25:10.289 --> 01:25:13.890
There's no teaching happening here.

01:25:15.384 --> 01:25:20.339
This is not somebody throwing themselves in front of a train to save the world.

01:25:26.479 --> 01:25:27.620
Totally new technology.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.620
And that kind of gets at the core.

01:25:30.541 --> 01:25:37.964
I think one of our problems here is the assumption that this is like every other vaccine we've ever seen.

01:25:38.465 --> 01:25:39.445
And it's not.

01:25:39.725 --> 01:25:40.846
It's very different technology.

01:25:40.866 --> 01:25:41.166
Right.

01:25:41.306 --> 01:25:42.867
And so these weird symptoms.

01:25:43.467 --> 01:25:45.908
It's almost like the syringe.

01:25:45.968 --> 01:25:51.991
We've mistaken the syringe as delivery vehicle for some sort of a proxy for how to feel about these vaccines.

01:25:52.671 --> 01:26:11.265
Now, Heather and I on this program, when we heard how the vaccines worked and that they had been accelerated through this process, our sense was, you're going to deliver a brand new technology with respect to deploying it in humans, and it's going to interact with the immune system, and you're going to speed it through this process.

01:26:11.305 --> 01:26:16.089
We did not know that it had skipped the animal trials that might have alerted us to something really dangerous.

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:20.212
They didn't even test the vaccine itself in the animal trials.

01:26:20.232 --> 01:26:20.772
I didn't know.

01:26:24.235 --> 01:26:33.122
So I received this data package that Steve's referred to that the Canadians acquired by FOIA within about 24 hours when it went live.

01:26:34.162 --> 01:26:39.707
And I reviewed it on behalf of Trial Site News on request.

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:45.131
And I was really alarmed, frankly, by what I saw.

01:26:45.731 --> 01:26:46.892
It was very unusual.

01:26:47.892 --> 01:26:52.635
And so I had an even more senior and experienced regulatory affairs professional review it.

01:26:53.396 --> 01:26:58.219
And he picked out more things, like the absence of the reprotox.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.500
Spell that out.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:05.183
Reproductive toxicology package that normally would be in the genotoxicity.

01:27:05.223 --> 01:27:06.404
So genotoxicity is

01:27:06.904 --> 01:27:11.727
toxicity to the genes of the test system.

01:27:15.429 --> 01:27:17.150
In this case it's the Ames test largely.

01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:25.254
So that's kind of level one for genotoxicity analysis.

01:27:25.595 --> 01:27:27.175
And these are imperfect assays.

01:27:27.936 --> 01:27:33.019
If there's one truism in research... Looking in the camera again.

01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:42.139
You know, we all say mice lie, monkeys mislead, and humans are the only things that really prove whether or not something is safe and effective is for humans.

01:27:43.599 --> 01:27:51.862
But we have to do something before we authorize, approve for a material to be initially tested in humans.

01:27:51.922 --> 01:27:55.244
So what the alarming thing was for me,

01:27:56.464 --> 01:28:05.353
was that what had been done, at least in that package, and I'm told, I spoke to Peter Marks, the director of CBER, about this and about my concerns.

01:28:06.194 --> 01:28:13.300
And he told me that the Pfizer has submitted a new data package in the just last couple of weeks, and they're currently evaluating it.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:20.347
So I think we have to take those data with a little bit of a grain of salt, because they may have been updated and we don't know what's in there.

01:28:21.448 --> 01:28:23.649
So maybe it is safer than I'm saying right now.

01:28:23.729 --> 01:28:25.830
Maybe it is more reliable.

01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:27.651
Maybe in the end it's going to be okay.

01:28:27.691 --> 01:28:28.251
Do you hear it?

01:28:29.572 --> 01:28:30.292
Can you see it?

01:28:32.493 --> 01:28:37.935
It sounded like for a minute there that he was really going to come out and say something dramatic, but in the end that he didn't, right?

01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:41.617
He, he, he didn't because he said, hold on.

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:49.240
Remember Jordan Peterson at this time was saying, I think we should give him six months and everybody should just take the shot so we can get out of this.

01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:56.042
Jordan Peterson said the same thing at the same time as these guys came out.

01:28:58.685 --> 01:28:59.966
And there's more data to come.

01:28:59.986 --> 01:29:08.096
Jeremy Marks assured me, my friend at the FDA assured me that Pfizer has submitted a new data package and so we should wait and see.

01:29:09.147 --> 01:29:15.914
Wait and see while thousands of people get transfected every day around the world because they feel coerced by their TV.

01:29:16.574 --> 01:29:19.177
Because they feel coerced by their city's mayor.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:22.360
Because they feel coerced by their kid's school.

01:29:23.181 --> 01:29:25.943
Because they feel coerced by their morning show host.

01:29:26.504 --> 01:29:31.108
Because they feel coerced by their people at work who watch the morning show host.

01:29:31.609 --> 01:29:32.510
Don't you see it?

01:29:37.045 --> 01:29:38.487
Is this in non-human primates?

01:29:38.587 --> 01:29:42.051
Because there's a big difference between... No, it was done in rodents.

01:29:42.251 --> 01:29:46.236
Yeah, but rodents don't have the same affinities for ACE2.

01:29:46.437 --> 01:29:51.783
So we're down in the weeds, but I just wanted to say... But the point is that we should do it right.

01:29:53.165 --> 01:29:53.565
Agreed.

01:29:54.637 --> 01:30:06.129
And through all of this... So that's interesting because he's pointing out that you can't use an animal model of a rat to do the vaccine studies.

01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:12.916
But of course, after this, there are monkey studies that purportedly used it as well.

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.841
And they used monkeys to do it.

01:30:16.281 --> 01:30:18.002
But Steve is upset right now.

01:30:18.382 --> 01:30:19.783
I believe Steve here.

01:30:19.823 --> 01:30:26.505
He still seems like a guy who's seen the UFO and isn't really sure if you believe him yet or not.

01:30:26.545 --> 01:30:34.589
And so every time he gets the feeling that people aren't listening to him or don't really understand what he means, he gets kind of upset.

01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:37.030
He gets a little antsy.

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:38.991
I'm believing him.

01:30:40.365 --> 01:30:47.712
I see Brett as being a guy who was brought in to rein in Steve almost.

01:30:51.395 --> 01:30:54.598
I think we can all agree, Tony Fauci can agree.

01:30:55.578 --> 01:31:00.222
that corners were cut in the interest of the emergency.

01:31:01.563 --> 01:31:07.708
And when you do that, these are processes to ensure safety.

01:31:08.528 --> 01:31:12.011
So again here, I think Mark and I are in total agreement.

01:31:13.052 --> 01:31:20.238
I'm just guessing, but I think him and I would both hear another thing being laid down here, right?

01:31:20.278 --> 01:31:22.820
Because again, if we wouldn't have rushed it,

01:31:24.366 --> 01:31:37.851
If we would have considered a little better what protein we were using and adjusted it a little bit, if we had made it a little purer, if we had not rushed it, this technology would be fine.

01:31:38.552 --> 01:31:42.633
Steve Kirsch, not even five minutes ago, said that we're not afraid of RNA vaccines at all.

01:31:42.673 --> 01:31:43.174
They're fine.

01:31:43.214 --> 01:31:45.294
It's just that this spike protein might be bad.

01:31:45.414 --> 01:31:46.455
Man, oh man.

01:31:47.094 --> 01:32:14.285
evolved over decades they took a risk they took a risk and they lost so we're gonna come back to this I know you have a background in bioethics I would point out that alright corners were cut let us all agree that we were how does somebody who is a vaccine technology broker have knowledge of bioethics what does that even mean

01:32:16.155 --> 01:32:21.581
You can't have knowledge of bioethics unless you've been an objective arbitrator.

01:32:23.544 --> 01:32:28.530
It just doesn't even make, how many different expertises does this guy have?

01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:31.573
Because he can also put a saddle on a racehorse and raise a $30,000 foal and emus.

01:32:37.239 --> 01:32:38.299
an emergency situation.

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.881
I would have done the same if I were in charge of the FDA.

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:46.983
I ran across an animation, I believe it was the FDA, and the specific purpose of this animation.

01:32:47.043 --> 01:32:47.603
Exactly.

01:32:47.743 --> 01:32:51.645
Christine Brady also has a rich background in bioethics.

01:32:51.725 --> 01:32:54.106
It's just a question of what kind of bioethics do you mean?

01:32:56.249 --> 01:33:09.098
If you mean undermining all of the standards of sovereignty over your body and what it means to exercise informed consent and always have the ability to say no,

01:33:11.522 --> 01:33:14.745
then yeah, I guess you could say that she's involved in bioethics.

01:33:14.805 --> 01:33:28.396
If you're interested in ways of testing vaccines on the back of each other or using immunobridging to justify new vaccine trials, sure, then I guess you could call that expertise in bioethics.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.476
Do you hear this?

01:33:31.198 --> 01:33:32.239
Do you hear this?

01:33:38.069 --> 01:33:41.652
These are not men who are keeping their arms straight.

01:33:42.893 --> 01:33:47.918
These are men who are performing, at least that's, I feel like Steve is trying to keep his arms straight.

01:33:49.799 --> 01:33:53.423
And these guys keep reaching across the table and putting his arms back down.

01:33:55.865 --> 01:33:59.188
But Steve keeps going, yeah, but come on guys, really?

01:34:00.509 --> 01:34:01.390
Stick with me here.

01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.612
No, no, no, calm down, Steve.

01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:07.842
is to say the process was accelerated, but no corners were cut.

01:34:07.882 --> 01:34:16.128
In fact, the metaphor they use is basically a road, right, in which they have straightened out the curves and basically, you know, it was a reduction in paperwork.

01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:17.329
So it's a cartoon.

01:34:17.509 --> 01:34:19.070
It is very literally a cartoon.

01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:23.833
Yeah, so we learned from the disclosures that that was a misrepresentation.

01:34:23.853 --> 01:34:29.677
So, but it's not just a misrepresentation, because the point is what is being allotted here is informed consent.

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.919
Basically, everybody who's getting these vaccines is

01:34:33.419 --> 01:34:44.406
part of an experiment that we are running, that is actually wildly over generous of me to say, because for it to be an experiment, we would have to systematically collect data on what happened to them.

01:34:44.506 --> 01:34:45.286
To every patient.

01:34:45.386 --> 01:34:48.108
And in fact, our systematic system isn't so systematic.

01:34:48.148 --> 01:34:50.009
No, it's all voluntary reports.

01:34:50.049 --> 01:34:53.351
Voluntary reporting with stigma attached to the end.

01:34:53.411 --> 01:34:55.913
If you report something, they're going to say, no, no, no.

01:34:55.933 --> 01:34:57.013
They'll convince you that it's not.

01:34:57.073 --> 01:35:01.516
So I just wanted to say that I didn't just rely on my carpet cleaner story.

01:35:01.556 --> 01:35:01.796
Right.

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:02.356
Oh, no, no.

01:35:02.376 --> 01:35:02.857
You pursued it.

01:35:03.537 --> 01:35:12.722
Yeah, that was just the uh-oh right then my antenna went up and then when every place I went Every single place I talked to doctors.

01:35:12.982 --> 01:35:14.523
I said, oh, you've got 900 patients.

01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:15.824
How many of them have you know?

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:20.206
What's the adverse event rate the serious adverse event rate, you know?

01:35:20.366 --> 01:35:29.611
And so doctors have a view and I talked to paramedics they've got a view and every I did a survey on next door and found, you know, I

01:35:31.335 --> 01:35:35.518
3% had persistent troubling systems that haven't gone away.

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:42.101
So every single thing that I looked to verify, it was flashing red.

01:35:42.121 --> 01:35:46.503
So you're coming at it from the street level, and that has validity.

01:35:46.683 --> 01:35:48.284
And the FDA doesn't look at it that way.

01:35:49.085 --> 01:35:50.445
They look at it as, hang on, hang on, one second.

01:35:50.465 --> 01:35:51.186
Ooh, it's getting salty in here.

01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:02.673
the very voluntary vaccine adverse event reporting system.

01:36:03.093 --> 01:36:05.094
Okay, nobody knows about that.

01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:10.978
They're all told to report into v-safe, they get these text messages that only last for a few weeks or so.

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:13.640
But nobody knows about this VAERS system.

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:16.222
And people aren't reporting in.

01:36:16.282 --> 01:36:22.086
In fact, when doctors report in, they are told, you know, don't report this, this wasn't, I mean, we

01:36:22.526 --> 01:36:28.593
We've had reports reversed from doctors without their consent, without the doctor's consent.

01:36:28.733 --> 01:36:30.956
First of all, I don't want us to work too hard, okay?

01:36:31.096 --> 01:36:43.350
There is something that goes on when we get into this space where the standards that are set for what constitutes evidence are absurd in the context of science and the way science actually functions.

01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:46.332
What you did is perfectly defensible.

01:36:46.432 --> 01:36:51.075
Had you concluded simply from three people in your sphere that there was a problem, that wouldn't have been.

01:36:51.135 --> 01:36:51.455
Oh, no.

01:36:51.495 --> 01:36:52.455
Yeah, absolutely not.

01:36:52.536 --> 01:36:53.476
That was an observation.

01:36:53.696 --> 01:36:54.177
It was an observation.

01:36:54.197 --> 01:36:54.857
It created a hypothesis.

01:36:54.937 --> 01:36:55.157
Exactly.

01:36:55.177 --> 01:36:59.820
The hypothesis is there's a problem with these vaccines, and if I look farther, that signal's not going to disappear.

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.561
It's going to continue out as far as I look.

01:37:02.121 --> 01:37:11.206
And when I looked at the VARIS database and I see like it's flatline for all the, you know, 30 years that VARIS has been around and then it just spikes up.

01:37:11.226 --> 01:37:12.607
I mean, it's like a hockey stick.

01:37:12.787 --> 01:37:14.928
And then it's like, how do you explain that?

01:37:15.208 --> 01:37:22.733
So I see another dynamic that's going on here that I think I should put in to kind of underscore the context.

01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:28.736
Remember that they're trying to be really careful because there's certain things you can't talk about.

01:37:29.881 --> 01:37:34.603
So they're trying to portray Steve as just making observations.

01:37:34.623 --> 01:37:37.145
We're not claiming anything, we're just making observations.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.225
He's backing him up.

01:37:39.666 --> 01:37:43.087
He's backing him up to this hypothetical line of censorship.

01:37:43.128 --> 01:37:47.590
We don't want to get my channel demonetized, do we now?

01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:51.652
And of course you know that this video is going to demonetize

01:37:52.677 --> 01:38:03.496
the Dark Horse podcast on YouTube, and they're gonna claim grievance for that forever after as evidence that they were on the cutting edge of getting this truth out.

01:38:04.670 --> 01:38:04.890
Right?

01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:08.913
So that's the thing they're doing here, the little dance.

01:38:08.973 --> 01:38:16.598
In case you can't feel it, Brett is walking Steve's statements back so that we make sure that we portray them just as observations.

01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:17.919
You should bring up that graphic.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:18.660
Sure.

01:38:19.641 --> 01:38:20.681
So while you're doing that.

01:38:20.701 --> 01:38:21.702
Yeah.

01:38:22.082 --> 01:38:30.028
And the assumption, by the way, has to be for something like this is you have to assume that it's the vaccine because that's the conservative thing.

01:38:30.848 --> 01:38:32.430
No, you're going the wrong way.

01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.170
Yep.

01:38:34.691 --> 01:38:36.492
That was the biodistribution.

01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:39.292
And then here's this graph.

01:38:39.472 --> 01:38:43.474
And when I saw this graph, I said, look, that needs to be explained.

01:38:44.194 --> 01:38:46.895
And the default is when you do... What's this?

01:38:49.935 --> 01:38:51.536
Are those subjects?

01:38:53.396 --> 01:38:54.077
And times?

01:38:54.477 --> 01:38:55.757
Or what are we doing here?

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:58.678
Do you see that?

01:39:00.658 --> 01:39:01.739
That's what he was looking at.

01:39:01.779 --> 01:39:02.299
What is this?

01:39:04.124 --> 01:39:05.985
You didn't think that this was organized, did you?

01:39:11.068 --> 01:39:14.370
I'm telling you, they're smiling at each other across the table for a reason.

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:23.114
And I don't know who's bamboozling who here, but it's more, it's more deep than them bamboozling us.

01:39:25.976 --> 01:39:29.438
There's a game being played even among these people at the table.

01:39:29.478 --> 01:39:33.240
That's why they behave so normally, so on edge, so,

01:39:34.474 --> 01:39:36.296
why the improv is so believable.

01:39:38.798 --> 01:39:42.041
Because they both think that they are understanding the game.

01:39:42.081 --> 01:39:44.664
They both all think that they have some privilege.

01:39:45.325 --> 01:39:49.529
Sorry, Brett and Steve both think that they have some privileged information.

01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:56.936
Brett and Steve both think that Robert Malone is higher on this hierarchy of understanding.

01:39:58.134 --> 01:40:03.758
And that Robert Malone is part of, you know, taking a big risk coming on Brett's show.

01:40:03.818 --> 01:40:13.544
And so Brett wants to do it in the classiest, you know, avoid the censorship, say what needs to be said, be a standup guy.

01:40:14.384 --> 01:40:16.045
That's what the performance is here.

01:40:17.586 --> 01:40:20.908
There's only one person at the table that I know for sure.

01:40:20.928 --> 01:40:24.691
I know for sure

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:35.488
is holding back reactions is carefully calculating his words is is it's amazing to me what I see here.

01:40:35.528 --> 01:40:47.018
It's just a clinical trial is you have to ascribe it to the suspect should be the the vaccine because this is what's being tested and then you need to

01:40:47.819 --> 01:40:51.320
to show that, oh, no, no, no, this was due to some other thing.

01:40:51.621 --> 01:40:52.701
And nobody's explained that.

01:40:52.761 --> 01:40:53.281
That's the thing.

01:40:53.301 --> 01:40:56.022
And nobody's even asking that question, how many people have died.

01:40:56.082 --> 01:40:58.383
You're playing by the scientific rules, right?

01:40:58.423 --> 01:41:00.044
Your point is, I observed something.

01:41:00.064 --> 01:41:00.464
I have a hypothesis.

01:41:00.484 --> 01:41:01.425
What's the hypothesis?

01:41:01.725 --> 01:41:03.466
And then the prediction is manifest.

01:41:03.526 --> 01:41:03.766
Right.

01:41:03.866 --> 01:41:04.046
Right.

01:41:04.086 --> 01:41:07.487
And then the question is, all right, maybe there's some other hypothesis that predicts the same thing.

01:41:07.527 --> 01:41:07.927
But if so, what is it?

01:41:07.947 --> 01:41:08.868
But nobody's come up with it.

01:41:09.128 --> 01:41:09.788
Exactly.

01:41:09.948 --> 01:41:10.168
Right.

01:41:10.188 --> 01:41:13.290
So they're using the rules of the game against science.

01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:15.851
Now, here is the graph that you were referring to.

01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:16.751
right?

01:41:17.211 --> 01:41:22.513
These are the death reports in the VAERS system as of May 28, 2021.

01:41:23.413 --> 01:41:26.814
And what you see is there's a certain amount of death following vaccine.

01:41:26.834 --> 01:41:29.655
Some of those deaths will be just random chance.

01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:30.315
Correct.

01:41:30.355 --> 01:41:32.116
That's the random chance you see at the

01:41:32.316 --> 01:41:38.641
It's a random chance you have a certain number of people who have an anaphylactic reaction to something the vaccine was grown in, right?

01:41:38.701 --> 01:41:39.281
Or they just die.

01:41:39.321 --> 01:41:47.448
But the point is, we get vaccines, they have values, there's a certain cost, a certain number of people die, we're adults, we get it, but then the question is, what the hell happens?

01:41:47.508 --> 01:41:49.149
It's interesting what they're looking at.

01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:55.434
I never thought about this before, but that implies a certain studio setup.

01:41:57.025 --> 01:42:02.446
that they have a monitor on the wall or a TV on the wall that Steve can point up to.

01:42:02.466 --> 01:42:06.747
I mean, my monitor is right in front of me right here and another one over there.

01:42:06.807 --> 01:42:13.909
So when I point at things, I have the cameras oriented so that it kind of looks like I'm looking, but I am really looking at what I'm looking at.

01:42:15.369 --> 01:42:18.310
But they're now looking at something that's above the camera.

01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:22.991
And presumably that means that people can see what's on the stream.

01:42:24.952 --> 01:42:27.024
I only say this because again, remember.

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.220
Yeah, I don't know.

01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:32.281
I'm just making observations.

01:42:32.301 --> 01:42:34.362
With the COVID vaccines there, why is that signal so high?

01:42:34.382 --> 01:42:35.782
How do you explain that?

01:42:35.842 --> 01:42:38.763
And so what you see there, that number I know is not up to date.

01:42:39.304 --> 01:42:40.004
The number is not.

01:42:40.104 --> 01:42:40.664
Oh, no, no, no.

01:42:40.684 --> 01:42:41.845
They're way backlogged.

01:42:41.945 --> 01:42:45.266
And also, the current number is like 6,000, right?

01:42:46.167 --> 01:42:47.227
Probably somewhere around there.

01:42:47.247 --> 01:42:53.530
But they've actually taken, nobody can explain why they've removed reports from the VAERS system.

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:58.392
Because what we found is that the reports that were put in by people and,

01:42:59.292 --> 01:43:00.132
they disappear.

01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:02.073
They disappear and then again.

01:43:02.153 --> 01:43:07.535
So this is a conservative estimate because what about those reports that they took out that we can't see?

01:43:07.836 --> 01:43:12.417
So he does sound like somebody who is very much concerned that he's seen a ghost.

01:43:13.438 --> 01:43:14.838
Brett's trying to calm him down.

01:43:15.619 --> 01:43:16.979
Robert has said nothing.

01:43:16.999 --> 01:43:21.181
Conservative and we can't calibrate how conservative it is.

01:43:21.561 --> 01:43:22.301
Correct.

01:43:22.582 --> 01:43:23.522
That's a key point.

01:43:23.542 --> 01:43:24.802
It's a key issue.

01:43:24.883 --> 01:43:26.943
So can I kind of peck at that a little bit?

01:43:28.684 --> 01:43:33.827
And I wanted to make sure that I was prepared before we had this discussion today.

01:43:33.968 --> 01:43:42.373
So this morning I called some friends at FDA again and talked to them about the databases and the database analysis.

01:43:43.213 --> 01:43:48.397
And I wanted to just check in and make sure that I wasn't misunderstanding or misrepresenting.

01:43:49.366 --> 01:44:02.188
And they used words like, it's chaotic, it's disorganized, they are not analyzing the data efficiently, they're understaffed, they're overwhelmed.

01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:17.371
Furthermore, all of these, whether it's v-safe or this VAERS database, which by the way, physicians are alerted and have been told for many years to use VAERS, and many of them do.

01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.081
VAERS is self-reported.

01:44:21.181 --> 01:44:24.242
We don't have a good numerator or a good denominator.

01:44:24.363 --> 01:44:29.245
In clinical research, we don't do this.

01:44:30.005 --> 01:44:31.306
We get all the reports.

01:44:31.486 --> 01:44:44.733
And if we're doing a structured clinical trial, we ensure that every single serious adverse event is carefully reported, carefully evaluated.

01:44:44.753 --> 01:44:47.554
A physician has to make a judgment call as to whether it

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:55.500
is not or is possibly or is definitely associated with drug administration.

01:44:55.601 --> 01:45:03.727
And the bias has to be anybody that, if you think about this for just a nanosecond, okay, if our goal is to ensure safety,

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:11.524
The bias has to be to assume that there is some association and then take the time to track it down.

01:45:12.725 --> 01:45:14.526
And therein lies the rub.

01:45:14.587 --> 01:45:27.315
So we have, and the last point I wanted to make is that under- So he says that he called some insiders at the FDA to talk about the databases and stuff.

01:45:27.815 --> 01:45:31.198
And they use words like chaotic and disorganized.

01:45:31.758 --> 01:45:33.840
Then he mentions the v-safe database

01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:41.282
And he says that physicians have been instructed to use the VAERS in the v-safe database for years, and some of them do use it.

01:45:42.283 --> 01:45:43.463
What do these statements mean?

01:45:44.603 --> 01:45:45.944
What is he really saying here?

01:45:46.944 --> 01:45:48.265
Is he saying anything at all?

01:45:50.445 --> 01:45:55.067
Robert says that in clinical trials, we are very strict.

01:45:56.067 --> 01:46:00.989
And we have a bias for, you know, it must have been the drug that we're testing.

01:46:02.605 --> 01:46:03.626
Do you hear this too?

01:46:04.487 --> 01:46:11.973
The idea that clinical trials are done with the utmost honesty, the utmost forthrightness.

01:46:13.114 --> 01:46:16.937
When I do clinical trials, boy, I hold them to the highest standard.

01:46:17.477 --> 01:46:19.459
I have the highest sense of morality.

01:46:20.299 --> 01:46:21.941
Money never influences me.

01:46:23.082 --> 01:46:24.503
I only do it the right way.

01:46:25.644 --> 01:46:30.568
In clinical trials, I don't know how they did it here, but when I do these things, boy, I'm honest.

01:46:33.368 --> 01:46:46.556
So I took the time to go back and reread the Emergency Use Authorization and the most recently updated EUA, that's the acronym, for COVID and the guidance from the FDA.

01:46:48.257 --> 01:47:00.025
The FDA had the latitude to require that the vaccine sponsors, the developers, implement more rigorous data capture for safety.

01:47:01.226 --> 01:47:02.507
And they elected not to.

01:47:03.828 --> 01:47:10.254
So they had the statutory authorization to do that, and they made a conscious decision not to.

01:47:10.354 --> 01:47:11.435
Let me understand what you're saying.

01:47:11.655 --> 01:47:16.299
Are you talking about in order to get the EUA, or are you talking about following the release of the EUA?

01:47:16.319 --> 01:47:19.122
I'm talking about post-authorization for EUA.

01:47:19.682 --> 01:47:24.987
FDA had the option to elect to require

01:47:26.505 --> 01:47:31.990
more or less rigor in how the data were captured normally under an EUA.

01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:37.776
So again, you're talking about after the vaccines have been authorized to give.

01:47:37.836 --> 01:47:38.837
Brett's pointing it out.

01:47:38.977 --> 01:47:40.358
He's not saying anything here.

01:47:41.099 --> 01:47:47.305
He's saying that the FDA could have followed up with the people they injected, but they chose not to as if that's part of this.

01:47:49.628 --> 01:47:57.173
As if that has anything to do with already having the common sense to know that you don't transfect people that you want to live a long, healthy life afterward.

01:47:59.094 --> 01:48:05.139
That transfection is not a suitable methodology for immunization against a respiratory disease.

01:48:05.799 --> 01:48:12.223
These are the basic biological principles that he should be putting forth if he's the expert that he purports to be.

01:48:13.644 --> 01:48:18.728
But instead, it seems like he's trying to blame the FDA for not having followed up with these people.

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:27.152
And so the VAERS database is overwhelmed and the FDA had the legislative authority to do it.

01:48:27.712 --> 01:48:30.034
They coulda, but they chose not to.

01:48:31.435 --> 01:48:35.357
You know who could have spoke out in 2020, but chose not to?

01:48:35.377 --> 01:48:41.422
Do you know who could have held their arms straight in 2020, but was nowhere to be found?

01:48:42.302 --> 01:48:43.443
All three of these men.

01:48:47.617 --> 01:48:57.701
So throwing it on the FDA, as opposed to you who wrote a paper, two papers in 2020 about the dangers of these shots and then chose not to speak up about it.

01:48:59.021 --> 01:49:01.002
Why did you write those papers then, Robert?

01:49:02.943 --> 01:49:14.628
Could it have been because you wrote those papers because you had a, an Inovio vaccine that would not have had these kinds of problems because electroporation at a,

01:49:16.238 --> 01:49:21.740
at the skin barrier is safer from an activation perspective than transfection.

01:49:23.081 --> 01:49:40.067
So did you write those papers in 2020 to set the stage for a conclusion that the transfection was too dangerous and we should stick with something more rudimentary like an electroporation of a DNA into the skin?

01:49:42.468 --> 01:49:45.269
Because if you're not going to mention them at this table,

01:49:46.451 --> 01:50:09.208
If you're going to say you submitted manuscripts to the FDA, but you're not going to tell us where they are, if they're not in the notes of this, if, if Brett and, and Steve have not read those, those papers that you wrote more than a year earlier as part of the prep for this discussion, then what's going on here, I would ask.

01:50:12.133 --> 01:50:17.918
I think the Breggans have also asked the question of why did you write those papers if you've never told anybody about them?

01:50:19.319 --> 01:50:20.801
You wrote them so early.

01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:24.144
And then when you came out on Brett's podcast, you didn't mention them at all.

01:50:24.644 --> 01:50:26.566
The contents of them are not discussed.

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:38.196
So maybe he wrote those papers because he didn't want the mRNA or the adenovirus vectors to be chosen as the countermeasure.

01:50:39.873 --> 01:50:43.694
rather than just because he was trying to save everybody from making a very big mistake.

01:50:44.034 --> 01:50:54.296
He was trying to save everybody from making a very big mistake on that product because maybe he had another product or other products.

01:50:55.597 --> 01:50:58.617
Steve, do you see where we are here, guys?

01:50:59.878 --> 01:51:01.018
This is plain as day.

01:51:01.858 --> 01:51:04.559
There's nothing to see here but malfeasance.

01:51:05.532 --> 01:51:16.515
And I don't know who's responsible for it because they're doing such a wonderful job of making it seem like a spontaneous discussion with certain talking points that they want to hit.

01:51:19.375 --> 01:51:22.716
To the public, data on what happens when it is administered to the public.

01:51:22.756 --> 01:51:23.416
That's what you're saying.

01:51:23.516 --> 01:51:26.717
Under an EUA, normally the way the statute was written,

01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:42.236
It's predominantly set up so that you no longer require written informed consent, but the sponsors are, this was the original intent, but the sponsors are still required to carefully capture.

01:51:42.256 --> 01:51:44.817
Malone doesn't show his hands because he's short.

01:51:46.573 --> 01:51:49.616
So this table's probably too high for him to put his hands on.

01:51:49.656 --> 01:51:50.898
Short people have that problem.

01:51:50.938 --> 01:51:53.540
His legs are probably also swinging under the table.

01:51:54.001 --> 01:51:56.503
Safety and efficacy information under EUA.

01:51:56.524 --> 01:51:58.706
You're still in an experimental product.

01:51:59.126 --> 01:52:00.348
You've just waived- With all subjects.

01:52:00.848 --> 01:52:02.370
You've just waived- Not a voluntary report system.

01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:04.432
You've just waived some of the requirements.

01:52:05.012 --> 01:52:09.077
In the current version of the EUA authorization,

01:52:11.429 --> 01:52:17.311
provides the FDA with the latitude to choose how rigorously that has to be done.

01:52:17.491 --> 01:52:25.994
And in this case, I'm not aware that they implemented any requirements for the sponsors to capture those data.

01:52:26.014 --> 01:52:29.595
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

01:52:29.715 --> 01:52:33.056
It's almost like they didn't want to see it.

01:52:33.216 --> 01:52:35.297
I don't want to imply intent.

01:52:35.657 --> 01:52:37.198
I just want to stay with the facts.

01:52:37.938 --> 01:52:38.839
Those are the facts.

01:52:38.859 --> 01:52:44.464
I would say this is one of a number of anomalies.

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:44.924
Fair enough.

01:52:45.064 --> 01:52:54.332
If you accept the narrative about why the EUA was granted, if you accept how we ended up here, then certain things would follow.

01:52:54.472 --> 01:52:59.216
And when they don't, there's a reason to ask the question about why.

01:52:59.756 --> 01:53:02.179
And so in this case, it seems like

01:53:02.899 --> 01:53:13.461
If you're going to release this under an EUA because it's an emergency and because we've got a real problem that basically requires us to take more risk than we otherwise take, then what you would want to know is, well, actually how big is the risk?

01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:17.181
And the way you would find that out is as you gave the thing to people, you would look for a signal.

01:53:17.221 --> 01:53:28.903
That's the whole logic of EUA is you're basically substituting real-time capture of key information for prospective capture of key information, OK?

01:53:28.983 --> 01:53:31.984
But in order to do that, you've got to get the information.

01:53:32.164 --> 01:53:33.424
And it's got to be rigorous.

01:53:33.704 --> 01:53:33.925
Right.

01:53:34.225 --> 01:53:35.005
Now, another thing.

01:53:35.065 --> 01:53:37.105
So there's a list of anomalies.

01:53:37.125 --> 01:53:38.205
And it would be great to collect them.

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:39.626
In fact, you may have collected them.

01:53:40.946 --> 01:53:47.970
I would say, when you've got an EUA, and that's the reason that you've licensed this vaccine, and you have no reason... It's not licensed.

01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:49.410
You have authorized.

01:53:49.571 --> 01:53:52.352
Authorized wide distribution of an experimental product.

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:52.932
Fair enough.

01:53:53.933 --> 01:53:55.053
For experimentation on humans.

01:53:55.173 --> 01:54:02.017
At the point that you have decided to do that, what you have done is you have said, it is worth taking more risk in this case because of X.

01:54:02.777 --> 01:54:06.440
You certainly would not give it to people who get no benefit.

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.964
If there's more risk, then the people who get no benefit really shouldn't be involved.

01:54:11.304 --> 01:54:15.107
In other words, people who have COVID should have no reason to take it.

01:54:15.347 --> 01:54:16.268
Kids should not take it.

01:54:16.348 --> 01:54:20.711
Kids shouldn't take it because they're actually fairly well protected against COVID.

01:54:20.731 --> 01:54:24.895
So this gets to my point that I've made in a couple other podcasts.

01:54:27.317 --> 01:54:30.559
Risk-benefit ratio sounds very sciency.

01:54:31.079 --> 01:54:32.881
But it needs to be calculated for the short age range.

01:54:32.921 --> 01:54:34.602
And it can be made sciency.

01:54:35.303 --> 01:54:45.530
And the standard process which the ACIP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, has in place and uses with every other vaccine,

01:54:46.511 --> 01:55:04.194
is that there is a formal calculation about quality-adjusted life years, which is the basis for the risk-benefit equation, and they make a determination based on standard cohort brackets, okay, of which adolescence is one.

01:55:04.214 --> 01:55:07.595
Okay, first of all, I see something happening in the chat there.

01:55:08.415 --> 01:55:12.616
Mark Hustatonic is taller than me, so he's got to be at least 6'5",

01:55:14.176 --> 01:55:14.997
or 6'6".

01:55:16.458 --> 01:55:22.121
And I'm, on my basketball program in high school, I was 6'6", so I assume that I'm not that tall anymore.

01:55:22.542 --> 01:55:24.703
I'm not as tall as George Webb, who I've heard is 6'8".

01:55:26.815 --> 01:55:33.079
But Mark Housatonic and I see right eye to eye and his he's got like this giant skull.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:36.241
I have a really tiny head He's got a giant skull.

01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:48.849
So it's like sticks up above and then he's got that hair and then he's got Sunglasses and so he's he's like really tall so and Molarian curly was very funny.

01:55:48.989 --> 01:55:51.711
I saw that and I had to stop with that so

01:55:55.063 --> 01:55:56.164
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:55:56.484 --> 01:55:57.525
Pregnancy is another.

01:55:58.406 --> 01:56:22.345
I'm shocked really, because here we are talking about how exactly secret meetings and worst case scenario models, which again, if you go back to Mark's recent videos, you're going to find out that somebody who was very intimately related to Robert Malone was responsible for producing

01:56:23.126 --> 01:56:36.677
this data or modeling the data in such a way to make projections about how so many people would die and about whether or certain mitigation strategies would reduce those people from dying.

01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:43.035
So again, I can't stress enough how important it is to keep up with Mark.

01:56:43.656 --> 01:56:52.906
Sometimes I give myself the excuse when Mark makes such a good video that I don't need to stream because everybody needs to be looking for content and hopefully they'll go look there.

01:56:55.288 --> 01:56:57.190
I just can't stress enough how important it is.

01:56:58.328 --> 01:57:04.133
to keep following the people that are, that have been putting these puzzle pieces together much longer than I have.

01:57:04.173 --> 01:57:06.776
And Mark is one of the few that I can't.

01:57:07.596 --> 01:57:11.020
We have to make sure that that guy gets lifted up.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.882
So you've gotta be sharing his tweets.

01:57:13.922 --> 01:57:15.784
You've gotta be posting his videos.

01:57:16.444 --> 01:57:24.472
A lot of the people that are using the time and effort to post my videos should really also be sharing his because at this stage,

01:57:25.839 --> 01:57:45.545
The reason why I feel so committed to this path forward and looking backwards and examining who kept their arms straight is because I've come to realize that Mark has kept his arms straight for a very, very long time and was actually holding his arms straight on the internet before it was cool.

01:57:46.466 --> 01:57:53.728
And so I just, I don't know, I'm just very grateful to him for his friendship and I'm very grateful that, you know,

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.484
After all this time, I'm finally following your advice and watching this video.

01:57:58.504 --> 01:58:05.511
I just can't believe how... I find a lot of hope here and a lot of reassurance that I'm not walking out on a limb.

01:58:06.252 --> 01:58:15.582
I'm not standing on shaky ground when I suggest that Robert Malone's past track record and career

01:58:17.427 --> 01:58:33.120
make it a dubious claim what he's making now, which is that he's a fifth generation warfare expert and that he's one of the few people telling the truth and that he has risked his life and limb and career to come out and do what he's done.

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:44.009
When we look back at exactly how he came out and the words that he used as he was coming out with the people that he came out with, you can clearly see that there's some incongruence there.

01:58:46.261 --> 01:58:51.957
And it isn't necessarily to be assumed that this was an evolution in his position.

01:58:53.410 --> 01:59:06.100
but rather a sort of ongoing absorption of whatever is necessary to keep the general population on narrative, which is there's a gain of function virus that was released.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.462
It's still going around the world now.

01:59:08.882 --> 01:59:10.463
We can track it with PCR.

01:59:11.044 --> 01:59:14.466
Transfection is a pretty good technology that he's the inventor of.

01:59:14.887 --> 01:59:18.850
And if we wouldn't have chosen this toxic spike protein, everything would be fine.

01:59:21.345 --> 01:59:29.048
And now think back to that people map that I have and think about how many people have been convinced that the spike protein is especially toxic.

01:59:30.109 --> 01:59:32.510
Because it's all part of the same narrative.

01:59:34.130 --> 01:59:40.093
To try and hoodwink everybody to say that, oh no, the transfection is a wonderful idea.

01:59:40.981 --> 01:59:43.142
But this spike protein, boy, was it nasty.

01:59:43.182 --> 02:00:00.391
And when we find out who's responsible for choosing this antigen set, when we find out who's responsible for not regulating the production of this mRNA to a high enough standard, when we find out who's responsible for rushing us through, well, we'll fix it.

02:00:01.451 --> 02:00:03.472
And then the vaccines will be better.

02:00:04.253 --> 02:00:05.493
We're not gonna put anybody in jail.

02:00:05.513 --> 02:00:08.955
We're not gonna blame anyone because the PrEP Act protects everybody.

02:00:12.722 --> 02:00:14.363
Infants is another, et cetera.

02:00:16.105 --> 02:00:20.028
The elderly, the immunocompromised are also special populations.

02:00:20.048 --> 02:00:30.237
So usually the standard government practice is there's a formal evaluation of true risk benefit for each one of those cohorts and it shifts.

02:00:30.897 --> 02:00:36.242
And by the way, risk benefit shifts as the incidence of the attack rate

02:00:36.992 --> 02:00:39.233
of the pathogen changes, right?

02:00:39.393 --> 02:00:40.273
Less COVID cases.

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:43.775
If there's no COVID, then there's no benefit to the vaccine, no reason to take the risk.

02:00:43.835 --> 02:00:44.035
Right.

02:00:44.175 --> 02:00:51.478
So I would also point out, though, that in this case, again, I respect not wanting to assume or infer intent.

02:00:51.658 --> 02:00:54.339
And I think that's wise, because there are multiple ways you can get here.

02:00:54.379 --> 02:01:01.522
But somehow, both the new- How many times did Robert Malone say on the podcast, the Defender podcast that I was on,

02:01:02.182 --> 02:01:07.064
That unlike Jonathan, I would be very careful to infer intent.

02:01:09.325 --> 02:01:14.087
And actually, the other person on that podcast who echoed that sentiment was Jessica Rose.

02:01:16.848 --> 02:01:18.709
Just observations, data points.

02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:22.451
The numerator and the denominator appear to have been gamed, right?

02:01:22.511 --> 02:01:26.032
Because I would say they have been insufficiently documented.

02:01:26.052 --> 02:01:27.033
I don't know what that flash was.

02:01:27.053 --> 02:01:29.054
So what we have is almost worthless.

02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:31.277
Well, let's put it this way.

02:01:31.639 --> 02:01:33.205
The benefit calculation

02:01:34.252 --> 02:01:40.513
requires you to look at the full set of alternatives in order to understand whether the risk is worth taking.

02:01:40.813 --> 02:01:41.573
I concur on that.

02:01:41.673 --> 02:01:46.634
Yeah, so let's talk about, you know, what the alternative is, right?

02:01:46.674 --> 02:01:59.957
Because that's been unfairly, you know, they basically have this evidence and the NIH, and Cliff Lane, by the way, runs the NIH COVID treatment guidelines.

02:02:00.517 --> 02:02:01.637
And I have told Cliff,

02:02:02.637 --> 02:02:14.660
in many times that fluvoxamine, when it was confirmed in a large phase three trial, which is the standard of evidence, as I said, everybody's waiting for this large, really well done phase three trial.

02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:25.022
And I told him about an interim result that was P value of 0.05, meets the bar, proves that it really works, there is no doubt.

02:02:25.662 --> 02:02:32.044
Can you imagine advocating for something that has psychological effects on people that is supposed to be antidepressive?

02:02:33.459 --> 02:02:39.562
as a way of combating a respiratory virus?

02:02:39.602 --> 02:02:40.783
Can you imagine that?

02:02:42.023 --> 02:02:43.104
What does that mean to you?

02:02:44.825 --> 02:02:57.051
Were they interested in convincing people to take psychoactive medicine that would mellow them out, dumb them down, steady them?

02:02:58.952 --> 02:03:02.454
What happens to people when they take fluvoxamine for COVID?

02:03:05.316 --> 02:03:06.376
Do they get suicidal?

02:03:07.836 --> 02:03:16.878
Do you understand how weird it is to be advocating for that drug as opposed to vitamin D or zinc or zinc ionophore?

02:03:16.998 --> 02:03:22.019
Like at the time, somebody like Zev Zelenko was, was, was pushing.

02:03:22.539 --> 02:03:25.860
Can you imagine this, how strange that is?

02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:27.440
Wow.

02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:30.321
How much of a context that is to just think about that.

02:03:30.381 --> 02:03:32.781
Think about that for a minute.

02:03:33.933 --> 02:03:40.895
The first thing that Mr. Steve Kirsch brings up is something that might make your teenager go crazy.

02:03:41.496 --> 02:03:43.576
It might make you have suicidal thoughts.

02:03:49.098 --> 02:03:54.700
Not vitamin D. So how much biology are we really learning here, ladies and gentlemen?

02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.881
Or are we just learning what's going to be done to us?

02:03:57.745 --> 02:04:01.388
what has been done, and what's going to be done to us.

02:04:01.448 --> 02:04:03.050
What are we really being told here?

02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:04.751
We're not being freed.

02:04:05.612 --> 02:04:10.316
These people are not teaching us to fish so that we can go to the river and figure it out ourselves.

02:04:11.637 --> 02:04:18.403
They're telling us what is, what's meant to be, what's gonna happen, so that we can accept it.

02:04:18.743 --> 02:04:19.584
That's what I hear.

02:04:21.085 --> 02:04:25.189
Even if Steve is an excellent, excellent, excellent dupe here,

02:04:26.954 --> 02:04:27.756
This is what I hear.

02:04:27.816 --> 02:04:30.161
This is an elaborate performance.

02:04:32.486 --> 02:04:32.987
No change.

02:04:33.428 --> 02:04:35.132
No, it doesn't even respond.

02:04:35.593 --> 02:04:36.515
When Ivermectin

02:04:37.592 --> 02:04:40.275
There was a report by Tess Lowry, an excellent report.

02:04:40.835 --> 02:04:42.057
It was done three months ago.

02:04:42.617 --> 02:04:44.759
She widely distributed to the WHO.

02:04:44.779 --> 02:04:50.565
By the way, the WHO knows that fluvoxamine works too, and so does the Gates Foundation, but they're saying nothing to people.

02:04:51.125 --> 02:04:58.372
And so this information, and if anyone wants to challenge me on this, you know, if Gates Foundation wants to debate me on this,

02:04:59.133 --> 02:04:59.593
Bring it on.

02:04:59.914 --> 02:05:02.716
If the WHO wants to debate me on this, bring it on.

02:05:02.816 --> 02:05:06.879
And I will show that they knew, and they're not telling people.

02:05:07.219 --> 02:05:11.463
Cliff Lane knew, and he's not changing the guidelines.

02:05:11.723 --> 02:05:15.066
This information is being suppressed, and it's unfair.

02:05:15.566 --> 02:05:17.347
But let's talk about the ivermectin report.

02:05:17.728 --> 02:05:19.349
So what is being suppressed?

02:05:19.409 --> 02:05:22.371
The information that fluvoxamine can help.

02:05:23.392 --> 02:05:25.434
The information that ivermectin can help.

02:05:26.479 --> 02:05:33.842
The information that's not being suppressed apparently is that vitamin D is an essential cofactor of your immune system.

02:05:33.902 --> 02:05:36.903
It's not being said that vitamin C in general can help.

02:05:37.403 --> 02:05:40.104
It's not being said that what you eat matters.

02:05:40.164 --> 02:05:46.267
It's not being said that if you're 40 years old and haven't taken care of yourself for 30 of those years, you might have a problem.

02:05:46.687 --> 02:05:51.269
It's not being said yet that remdesivir isn't useful here.

02:05:51.649 --> 02:05:54.410
We're 40 minutes in, we still haven't mentioned that.

02:05:55.728 --> 02:05:58.529
We haven't mentioned the improper ventilation of people.

02:06:00.209 --> 02:06:07.931
We haven't mentioned anything of relevance on our table, on our bulletin boards, on our notes anymore.

02:06:09.112 --> 02:06:09.772
Nothing yet.

02:06:12.052 --> 02:06:16.674
Because Tess Lowry created this report, and these guys did nothing.

02:06:16.894 --> 02:06:23.455
They sat back and said, well, Tess, it's not peer reviewed, so nobody's going to peer review it, so we don't have to do anything.

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:24.656
So Tess said,

02:06:25.546 --> 02:06:30.750
You know, these guys aren't doing anything with it, so I'm going to submit it to a journal.

02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.993
And she got it peer-reviewed, and it probably will be published tomorrow.

02:06:35.973 --> 02:06:39.835
In which case, all these people that said, well, ivermectin doesn't work.

02:06:40.375 --> 02:06:42.876
And I believe in evidence-based medicine.

02:06:42.916 --> 02:06:46.098
And I would talk to the top officials in India.

02:06:46.318 --> 02:06:48.599
And then they would say, I believe in evidence-based medicine.

02:06:48.619 --> 02:06:50.440
I said, here's all the evidence.

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:56.622
Here's the systematic review and meta-analysis that you need.

02:06:56.642 --> 02:06:58.143
That's the highest level of evidence.

02:06:58.803 --> 02:06:59.484
Look at the evidence.

02:06:59.504 --> 02:07:04.326
And he says, and the response is, well, the WHO and the NIH don't say so.

02:07:05.066 --> 02:07:06.388
I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

02:07:06.528 --> 02:07:08.190
And the evidence is overwhelming.

02:07:09.052 --> 02:07:09.693
There's no question.

02:07:09.713 --> 02:07:10.333
There's no question.

02:07:10.474 --> 02:07:14.439
And this is among the safest drugs that we have in our arsenal.

02:07:14.779 --> 02:07:17.483
So that's on the ivermectin story.

02:07:17.623 --> 02:07:17.804
Yep.

02:07:18.064 --> 02:07:18.364
Okay.

02:07:19.125 --> 02:07:20.227
That's the sticker for me.

02:07:21.829 --> 02:07:33.356
And I just got another report of a physician in Africa who had championed ivermectin, and then there was a regime change, and now she's being threatened with being put in jail.

02:07:34.476 --> 02:07:35.897
There's all this pushback about ivermectin.

02:07:35.917 --> 02:07:36.797
You're talking about Zimbabwe?

02:07:37.378 --> 02:07:37.538
Yeah.

02:07:37.798 --> 02:07:41.140
No, no, they changed it.

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:44.522
But my point is, to underscore what you just said,

02:07:45.905 --> 02:07:56.435
is that at the doses that are being advocated that appear to be effective based on the data, and I've been tracking the same data, those are known to be safe.

02:07:57.215 --> 02:08:03.601
And so you have a drug which is available in the pharmacopeia, it's licensed.

02:08:04.182 --> 02:08:06.864
It's funny because this is actually the lens they chose.

02:08:08.005 --> 02:08:10.748
If you choose a cheap lens that's like,

02:08:12.224 --> 02:08:23.089
16 mils or 18 mil lens and it's kind of cheap, you know, like you don't get a Zeiss one or something like that, then the people on the outside of the circle are going to look bigger than the people on the inside.

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:26.370
And so that changes quite dramatically.

02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:35.133
And so the reason why it looks like Robert Malone has a T-Rex arm is because that's in the normal focal plane of the lens.

02:08:35.173 --> 02:08:40.376
And then whatever lens they chose here is really distorting it all the way out at the edges.

02:08:41.336 --> 02:08:41.436
Um,

02:08:42.304 --> 02:08:45.605
I think that's also because Steve Kersh is actually also quite a small guy.

02:08:45.625 --> 02:08:47.986
I think they're all pretty short guys.

02:08:48.706 --> 02:08:51.787
Um, but you can't really see it here because of the way the lens does this.

02:08:52.487 --> 02:09:00.789
Physicians in the United States, at least in most countries have the right to prescribe from the existing pharmacopeia, even off label for other purposes.

02:09:00.809 --> 02:09:01.609
Okay.

02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:03.970
At safe levels.

02:09:05.191 --> 02:09:10.312
And they're, they're, um, being, um, uh,

02:09:12.024 --> 02:09:18.630
There is active consequences of physicians prescribing this drug openly and speaking about it.

02:09:18.650 --> 02:09:21.132
And pharmacies won't even fill the prescriptions.

02:09:21.412 --> 02:09:23.493
And yet they're administering it a safe dose.

02:09:23.533 --> 02:09:25.955
So if it's being administered... Boy, he hates being interrupted.

02:09:25.975 --> 02:09:29.198
Can you hear him sigh into the microphone every time Steve interrupts him?

02:09:29.378 --> 02:09:31.919
sort of safe dose, and it's even marginally effective.

02:09:31.939 --> 02:09:32.779
There's no harm.

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:35.721
That just doesn't make sense.

02:09:35.741 --> 02:09:37.441
There's something called the precautionary principle.

02:09:37.461 --> 02:09:38.642
This is really important, okay?

02:09:38.662 --> 02:09:40.323
There's a precautionary principle of medicine.

02:09:40.843 --> 02:09:44.664
And this is what- So again, they're pushing this idea that, wow, it doesn't make sense.

02:09:44.745 --> 02:09:47.406
They're opposing the use of ivermectin.

02:09:47.486 --> 02:09:49.567
So ivermectin must work.

02:09:53.008 --> 02:09:57.570
I really believe in my heart of hearts that this is also part of the Scooby-Doo.

02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:07.248
Not only have they argued to believe that, you know, it's a lab leak because Fauci and Rand Paul argued about it in front of the Senate.

02:10:07.268 --> 02:10:11.271
It made it obvious because of the diffuse proposal.

02:10:11.351 --> 02:10:15.175
It's obvious that this is a lab leak caused by spraying in bat caves, whatever.

02:10:16.485 --> 02:10:29.968
I believe that what we are witnessing here is the seeding of an ivermectin narrative, the continuation of an ivermectin narrative that early treatment works on this novel pathogen that's going around the world.

02:10:32.749 --> 02:10:39.050
And there are a lot of doctors, I think, that are coming to the realization that the effectiveness of this drug was not obvious.

02:10:41.351 --> 02:10:44.352
And I'm not sure what's going on with it.

02:10:44.432 --> 02:10:45.912
I'm not sure that we're right.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:11:04.036
What I would argue is that by blaming everything on ivermectin without adequately looking at what it is that those patients also got, we are making a very dangerous leap here.

02:11:04.076 --> 02:11:11.123
And one of the things that I would say Tess Lowry's meta-analysis does is it may make that leap.

02:11:12.759 --> 02:11:24.926
I don't know to what extent we've looked at those papers, and no, we have to make sure that those papers don't have people that were on ivermectin, and also antibiotics, and also anti-inflammatories, and then some that weren't.

02:11:26.327 --> 02:11:31.170
Because then that meta-analysis isn't as valid as we would have assumed it is.

02:11:32.771 --> 02:11:36.173
And one of the things we need to be very honest about with ourselves is,

02:11:38.413 --> 02:11:53.638
That if Ivermectin is used in the context of remdesivir, if it is used in the context of, well, let's say mixtures and interactions of any kind, we don't know if Ivermectin worked.

02:11:53.718 --> 02:12:02.661
One of the best examples I have is, I was losing it there for a minute, but one of the best examples I have is Joe Rogan.

02:12:03.587 --> 02:12:17.315
Joe Rogan made a very big to-do about the fact that CNN censored his use of ivermectin by saying that he took horse medicine, or horse paste, or horse medicine.

02:12:18.696 --> 02:12:20.917
And it's not horse medicine, it's human medicine.

02:12:21.718 --> 02:12:34.204
But what that did, I believe, very strongly I believe, what that did was distract from the fact that Joe Rogan also got anti-inflammatories and he also got monoclonal antibodies.

02:12:37.326 --> 02:12:48.512
And so there's no way to judge whether it was the ivermectin or the monoclonal antibodies or whatever else he was given or his extreme, extremely

02:12:49.465 --> 02:12:54.269
fit lifestyle that ultimately ended up getting him through whatever he had.

02:12:56.411 --> 02:13:12.684
But saying that he had it, saying that he had ivermectin, saying that CNN made some big deal about it, saying that the FDA had this silly tweet about it being horse medicine, and listening to these guys hyper-focus on it,

02:13:14.304 --> 02:13:32.113
as opposed to vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, zinc ionophores, all the things that Zev Zelenko and other more holistic people that were promoting natural infection and were promoting natural immunity and overlapping previous immunity like I was, were promoting.

02:13:34.214 --> 02:13:38.096
And at the time we were all panicked and we were all freaking out.

02:13:38.136 --> 02:13:40.918
And so it didn't seem as obvious as this should seem now.

02:13:42.128 --> 02:13:44.789
This is 100% on narrative performance here.

02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:54.653
They used for mask wearing because masks, which are mandated, they actually didn't even have a double blind randomized control trial ever for mask wearing.

02:13:54.973 --> 02:14:01.075
You did the mandate and then they did the, it couldn't be double blind because you can't do that.

02:14:01.175 --> 02:14:02.655
It has to be a randomized control trial.

02:14:02.856 --> 02:14:05.156
So they ran, there's one trial in Denmark.

02:14:05.517 --> 02:14:06.257
Guess what happened?

02:14:07.905 --> 02:14:12.586
No, it was not statistically significant difference whether you were wearing a mask or not.

02:14:12.906 --> 02:14:16.167
There was a slight benefit, but it wasn't statistically significant.

02:14:16.427 --> 02:14:23.088
So, everybody would say, they'd always say, well, so we can't use it, you know, until.

02:14:23.108 --> 02:14:24.368
So, that's the question, right?

02:14:24.408 --> 02:14:33.790
A lot of people have been saying that ivermectin interferes with the replication transcription complex, but I do believe that ivermectin is a zinc ionophore.

02:14:35.177 --> 02:14:38.400
or upregulates zinc or has some interplay with zinc.

02:14:39.221 --> 02:14:40.742
Andquiseratin is that way.

02:14:42.104 --> 02:14:44.506
We just know these things from Zev Zelenko.

02:14:44.806 --> 02:14:55.936
And I trust Zev Zelenko more than I trust any of these other people, because he has consistently been interested in educating people on the lack of

02:15:00.899 --> 02:15:08.705
the lack of usefulness of the transfection, the danger of transfection, and the reason why our immune system is already ready to do that.

02:15:09.026 --> 02:15:26.600
There's no question in my mind that it's notable that these guys in June of 2021 have not mentioned anything to do with zinc, anything to do with zinc ionophores, anything to do with vitamin D, and anything to do with Zev Zelenko.

02:15:27.571 --> 02:15:30.594
They haven't even really mentioned hydroxychloroquine yet.

02:15:30.654 --> 02:15:31.935
Are you noticing that?

02:15:32.635 --> 02:15:35.558
They haven't even mentioned hydroxychloroquine yet.

02:15:36.038 --> 02:15:37.139
Are you noticing that?

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:41.383
They haven't even mentioned hydroxychloroquine yet.

02:15:41.543 --> 02:15:42.484
Are you noticing that?

02:15:43.297 --> 02:15:45.098
It's proving because I don't want to do an unproven thing.

02:15:45.378 --> 02:15:48.119
And yet for mass, they say, oh, it's mandated.

02:15:48.459 --> 02:15:50.079
And they do that on the precautionary principle.

02:15:50.099 --> 02:16:05.185
The precautionary principle says that, you know, as long as there are no downsides, and there might be an upside, we do it because until we have better data, and they're ignoring that for fluvoxamine and ivermectin, because they want to push the vaccine.

02:16:05.225 --> 02:16:06.465
So there's no alternative.

02:16:06.645 --> 02:16:08.006
Yeah, they've reversed it on us.

02:16:08.526 --> 02:16:09.246
Yeah.

02:16:09.326 --> 02:16:11.667
So this is the third anomaly, right?

02:16:11.847 --> 02:16:19.909
So the third anomaly here is that given a drug about which people claim the data is ambiguous, I don't believe it is.

02:16:19.969 --> 02:16:20.789
No, it's not at all.

02:16:20.969 --> 02:16:23.130
But 23 studies all positive.

02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:25.770
It wouldn't tell you not to administer it given how safe it is.

02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:31.892
So you've got a bunch of anomalies that say they don't want to collect data on the hazard of the vaccines.

02:16:32.532 --> 02:16:32.732
right?

02:16:32.992 --> 02:16:39.615
They're administering the vaccines to people who get no benefit, in spite of the fact that there's clearly an elevated risk based on the accelerated profile.

02:16:40.175 --> 02:16:48.699
And they don't want you to administer a drug that appears at worst to do no harm, and at best, potentially highly valuable.

02:16:48.779 --> 02:16:50.900
And let me tell you the story of fluvoxamine.

02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:53.101
Okay, because this really is.

02:16:53.761 --> 02:16:56.202
So fluvoxamine came out, it was published in JAMA.

02:16:56.443 --> 02:16:57.483
So fluvoxamine

02:16:57.783 --> 02:16:58.603
is an SSRI.

02:16:58.663 --> 02:17:08.866
It's an SSRI and it penetrates the blood-brain barrier which is great because people have this brain fog.

02:17:09.106 --> 02:17:10.586
Holy crap!

02:17:12.767 --> 02:17:14.987
Do you hear how ridiculous this is?

02:17:15.467 --> 02:17:17.308
It penetrates the blood-brain barrier.

02:17:17.488 --> 02:17:22.049
It's an SSRI and that makes perfect sense for a respiratory disease.

02:17:23.996 --> 02:17:26.438
What in the nine hells is going on here?

02:17:27.118 --> 02:17:33.383
He thinks it relieves the fog of COVID, the long COVID, the mental aspects of COVID.

02:17:33.884 --> 02:17:34.684
Are you kidding me?

02:17:35.465 --> 02:17:36.566
Are you kidding me?

02:17:39.528 --> 02:17:41.730
And so I've experienced it.

02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.570
It's real.

02:17:42.630 --> 02:17:43.551
I'm like ivermectin.

02:17:44.051 --> 02:17:44.572
Flumoxib.

02:17:44.652 --> 02:17:45.773
I've experienced it.

02:17:46.233 --> 02:17:46.874
It's real.

02:17:51.037 --> 02:17:52.158
I've experienced it.

02:17:53.218 --> 02:17:53.699
It's real.

02:17:55.445 --> 02:17:56.526
goes all the way to the brain.

02:17:58.568 --> 02:17:59.649
Brain fog, okay?

02:17:59.969 --> 02:18:01.090
And so, unlike ivermectin.

02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:02.992
I've experienced it, it's real.

02:18:03.092 --> 02:18:15.724
Unlike ivermectin, flumoxamine goes all the way to the brain, and it calms the inflammation in the brain, and because it activates the sigma-run receptor, which Francis Collins has written extensively about as saying this is really important.

02:18:16.044 --> 02:18:19.986
So we have this drug that Francis Collins says, yeah, I love the mechanism of inaction.

02:18:20.306 --> 02:18:21.126
We actually tried it.

02:18:21.206 --> 02:18:29.829
So in the trial, it had 100% effect in terms of no hospitalization for the 80 patients in that trial.

02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:35.151
And then what happened is that JAMA said, do not use, doctors, do not use this.

02:18:35.171 --> 02:18:36.372
This is just a hypothesis.

02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:40.533
despite the fact that everything leading up to that was all positive.

02:18:40.753 --> 02:18:51.061
All of the observational studies, everybody was saying there's a huge signal here, so you run it in a randomized trial and confirm it, and JAMA says, that's not, just his hypothesis, don't use it.

02:18:51.482 --> 02:19:01.630
So there's this guy, Dr. David Seftel, and I'm on his podcast talking about, hey, the fluvoxamine, the trial got published in JAMA, 100% effect size.

02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:06.414
And so he says, oh, he had an outbreak at the racetrack

02:19:07.054 --> 02:19:09.838
the next day after my podcast.

02:19:09.878 --> 02:19:14.765
So he decided to ignore the advice from JAMA editors.

02:19:15.406 --> 02:19:16.928
Howard Bachner wrote that.

02:19:17.168 --> 02:19:23.296
He said, don't use this until it's proven in a clinical trial, which violates the precautionary principle.

02:19:23.777 --> 02:19:24.037
Okay.

02:19:24.357 --> 02:19:27.900
So Seftal said, no, I'm going to use this because it could save lives.

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:34.224
And he gave it to 77, uh, 77 people opted to do that, including eight crossovers.

02:19:34.264 --> 02:19:39.387
So eight people failed the, the no treatment group and said, Hey, I want the drug.

02:19:39.828 --> 02:19:44.551
And in fact, everybody after the first two weeks wanted the drug because they could see the difference, right?

02:19:44.571 --> 02:19:45.852
They didn't have to look at P values.

02:19:46.192 --> 02:19:53.157
They looked at one side where people who are like, you know, stuck in bed and mental fog, the other side.

02:19:53.757 --> 02:20:01.162
They took the fluvoxamine, and in three days, people were like back to normal, and they told Seftal, I want to get back to work, like there's nothing wrong.

02:20:01.182 --> 02:20:03.764
So let's unpack that a little bit, okay?

02:20:04.004 --> 02:20:08.167
Hang on, let me just finish the story, because this is not the end of this.

02:20:08.448 --> 02:20:16.974
Okay, so all 77 patients who got the fluvoxamine, and it was 50 milligrams twice a day, most of the people got that dose, which is one third of the FDA dose.

02:20:17.805 --> 02:20:26.912
They recovered, they didn't have any long-haul COVID symptoms after two weeks, and they'd never even developed any long-haul COVID symptoms.

02:20:27.573 --> 02:20:35.780
So this is what I call the miracle of the racetrack because the other matching group, they had a 12.5% hospitalization rate and one guy died.

02:20:36.579 --> 02:20:51.724
So when you look at the p-value of that symptom data, oh, so the long-haul COVID symptoms, zero in the treatment group, 60% in the no treatment group, and you do a Fisher exact test and calculate the p-value, 10 to the minus 14.

02:20:52.485 --> 02:20:57.827
Okay, that's 10 orders of magnitude more significant than the vaccines.

02:20:57.867 --> 02:21:00.908
The chances that this worked by accident are effectively zero.

02:21:00.928 --> 02:21:01.688
Zero, zero.

02:21:02.128 --> 02:21:07.830
OK, but what should have happened is that NIH should have said, I want to send an investigator down.

02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:09.090
I want to see if there was any bias.

02:21:09.430 --> 02:21:11.371
See, Steve makes a lot of these arguments.

02:21:11.411 --> 02:21:17.853
He used to waste a lot of time in his steering committee throwing all these random, what if I did this?

02:21:17.893 --> 02:21:20.374
What if I asked people a bunch of questions about this stuff?

02:21:20.394 --> 02:21:21.534
Do you think we could learn anything?

02:21:22.543 --> 02:21:27.426
He's got a lot of really weird arguments that don't really get at the nuts and bolts of what's going on here.

02:21:28.347 --> 02:21:34.331
And he, he, he sells them with an enthusiasm that can often on the surface, make it seem like that.

02:21:34.351 --> 02:21:37.113
He's got a great idea, but they're, they're rarely great ideas.

02:21:37.333 --> 02:21:38.554
I want to see if there were any confounders.

02:21:38.874 --> 02:21:41.716
You know, this is like the miracle drug that we've been looking for.

02:21:42.016 --> 02:21:45.278
They should have been, they should have sent the entire staff down there.

02:21:45.658 --> 02:21:47.579
You want to respond to this?

02:21:47.859 --> 02:21:49.100
I'd like to respond too.

02:21:49.120 --> 02:22:05.530
This is one of many examples of where repurposed drug information is not being able to be processed and made available to the general public and to the scientific community because of journal editors.

02:22:07.409 --> 02:22:08.069
No, no, no.

02:22:08.109 --> 02:22:14.393
Look, both of these were published in peer-reviewed journals, top editor's choice in peer-reviewed journals.

02:22:14.433 --> 02:22:15.393
So that's just a threat.

02:22:15.413 --> 02:22:16.154
But here's the thing.

02:22:16.194 --> 02:22:18.135
We know what they're going to say.

02:22:18.175 --> 02:22:22.117
Yeah, the FDA said, well, it was quasi-randomized and people got to choose.

02:22:22.157 --> 02:22:25.038
But the sicker people chose to take the drug.

02:22:25.058 --> 02:22:26.159
This is exactly what I was going to say.

02:22:26.599 --> 02:22:30.820
The fact is people do not understand how science works in a technical field like this.

02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:35.742
There is bias in the test that you're talking about, but it happens to be conservative bias.

02:22:35.842 --> 02:22:36.722
Exactly.

02:22:36.802 --> 02:22:40.003
What it means is that what you saw is actually more aggressive.

02:22:40.023 --> 02:22:40.963
Better than random.

02:22:41.244 --> 02:22:44.164
And the FDA said, no, we're rejecting it because it was quasi-randomized.

02:22:44.264 --> 02:22:47.165
So this, again, is anomalous behavior.

02:22:47.385 --> 02:22:54.968
That's the point I was trying to make, is that there's, we got to, so if we're going to get sciency, we got a lot of data points.

02:22:56.048 --> 02:23:02.355
And, um, they're, they're way past forming a line and, um, they're hard to explain.

02:23:02.956 --> 02:23:03.056
Yeah.

02:23:03.136 --> 02:23:06.420
Oh, look, Hey, I got to tell you about my $2 million offer, Brett.

02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:09.403
So you can, after the podcast, you can check it out.

02:23:09.423 --> 02:23:10.324
It's on trial site news.

02:23:10.344 --> 02:23:11.005
There's an article.

02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:17.662
I offered a million dollars if you could prove that the NIH got it right on ivermectin.

02:23:18.042 --> 02:23:22.203
I offer a million dollars if you can prove that the NIH got it right on fluvoxamine.

02:23:22.763 --> 02:23:24.544
And you have two ways to win.

02:23:24.964 --> 02:23:36.067
You can either show that the evidence is, that your hypothesis matches the evidence more closely than the alternative hypothesis of it working.

02:23:36.747 --> 02:23:37.007
Okay.

02:23:37.448 --> 02:23:39.849
Or you can see, so here we are again.

02:23:39.869 --> 02:24:03.406
I think that one of the things that we're going to have to learn over the next few weeks is that the way that hypothesis testing is represented as a foolproof Vorpal sword that can be used to cut through the weeds of, of, of information to produce knowledge is wrong.

02:24:06.144 --> 02:24:17.334
And we have been led to believe that hypothesis testing and p-values result in a certainty that makes it able for us to move forward with big ideas.

02:24:17.534 --> 02:24:26.182
And that big ideas can never be fully proven, but have to be tested over and over and over again.

02:24:27.864 --> 02:24:42.969
That's why when this coronavirus came out and it's an RNA virus, we had to throw out everything that we knew before because this is a new virus that we would be silly to compare to other coronaviruses, other RNA viruses that we have come to understand.

02:24:44.249 --> 02:24:49.211
It would be crazy to treat this respiratory disease like we treat any other respiratory disease.

02:24:49.731 --> 02:24:51.952
We should try an antidepressant.

02:24:54.206 --> 02:25:00.191
that passes the blood-brain barrier because some of the people that get this respiratory disease apparently also have long COVID.

02:25:03.333 --> 02:25:05.174
Nothing is being taught here.

02:25:06.776 --> 02:25:11.339
We are all dumber for having watched this podcast in 2021.

02:25:11.439 --> 02:25:21.066
We were all less able to exercise our informed consent after having watched this podcast.

02:25:21.166 --> 02:25:23.068
That's the real conclusion to come to.

02:25:24.850 --> 02:25:47.179
is that Robert Malone, Brett Weinstein, and Steve Kirsch worked against our ability to exercise our informed consent when they said the words that they did in the first hour of this podcast, because they led us to believe that masking was required until you were fully vaccinated.

02:25:47.579 --> 02:25:50.060
Masking was required until you had been infected

02:25:51.058 --> 02:25:55.301
masking would be required until you came up with a suitable prophylactic.

02:25:56.502 --> 02:26:02.465
And that evidence that this prophylactic works is an exhibited censorship of it.

02:26:05.788 --> 02:26:09.930
And the existence of censorship of other repurposed drugs.

02:26:11.271 --> 02:26:18.656
After 51 minutes, they have not mentioned zinc, not mentioned vitamin D. They have not told us the truth.

02:26:20.043 --> 02:26:29.653
They have told us a narrative, a narrative that is essentially a trap because people will continue to take the transfections.

02:26:30.213 --> 02:26:32.956
The age groups will continue to move down the scale.

02:26:34.097 --> 02:26:41.885
And these guys did not put their foot down like we seem to have imagined that they did, that we have been led to believe that they had.

02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:51.687
Because my YouTube got canceled and I couldn't make any more money on YouTube because I let Robert Malone and Steve Kirsch tell the truth on my podcast.

02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:54.312
That's why I'm a hero.

02:27:00.014 --> 02:27:05.497
show that you're going to save more lives by choosing what the NIH did.

02:27:05.797 --> 02:27:08.239
Because the NIH doesn't care about lives at all.

02:27:08.659 --> 02:27:13.121
They never make the lives calculation in their recommendations.

02:27:13.141 --> 02:27:15.203
Let's not say they don't care about lives.

02:27:16.183 --> 02:27:20.065
If you look at the recommendations, they never include anything about the cost of life.

02:27:20.425 --> 02:27:22.527
No talk about hospitals getting paid.

02:27:22.647 --> 02:27:26.049
No talk about hospitals getting paid to ventilate people.

02:27:26.489 --> 02:27:28.010
No talk about hospitals getting

02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:33.872
paid to use remdesivir, no talk about the financial incentives to blow up cases.

02:27:35.112 --> 02:27:35.612
None at all.

02:27:36.232 --> 02:27:37.253
None at all.

02:27:38.173 --> 02:27:44.795
And we are now 51 minutes in and we still haven't talked about the fact that the PCR test is probably not testing for what they said it's testing for.

02:27:45.728 --> 02:27:48.830
We've never once questioned the prevalence of the virus.

02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:51.271
It's crazy.

02:27:51.911 --> 02:27:52.912
At the cost of being wrong.

02:27:52.972 --> 02:27:54.933
Are we too far in the weeds right now?

02:27:54.953 --> 02:27:56.033
No, this is important, right?

02:27:56.053 --> 02:28:07.039
Because this is the, everybody looks to the NIH for these guidance and the NIH uses these academic principles of what is right instead of saving lives in a pandemic.

02:28:07.159 --> 02:28:08.580
And that is absolutely wrong.

02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:10.521
Actually, I would disagree with you.

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:10.961
Well, good.

02:28:11.261 --> 02:28:23.052
Okay, I think that what's coming out in the recommendations right now is not really aligned with academic norms.

02:28:23.812 --> 02:28:31.159
I think there is appearance that there's decisions being made that are somewhat arbitrary.

02:28:32.532 --> 02:28:41.201
Oh, like, like, like, uh, uh, uh, like, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, the ivermectin response.

02:28:41.341 --> 02:28:42.222
No, no, no, no.

02:28:42.262 --> 02:28:42.822
Remdesivir.

02:28:42.902 --> 02:28:42.963
Yes.

02:28:42.983 --> 02:28:43.283
Right.

02:28:43.323 --> 02:28:43.843
Remdesivir.

02:28:43.863 --> 02:28:44.864
Remdesivir is one.

02:28:44.904 --> 02:28:46.146
Dexamethasone is another.

02:28:56.816 --> 02:29:00.961
Right after anomaly after anomaly and they all go in the same direction.

02:29:01.001 --> 02:29:12.693
They all go in the same direction everything Being exerted it looks like Steve doesn't understand that remdesivir was pushed for Zika and was pushed for Ebola and was pushed for a number of

02:29:13.474 --> 02:29:14.195
different things.

02:29:14.575 --> 02:29:20.298
He doesn't understand that it was predicted by Sina Bavaria as being useful for the next pandemic in 2019.

02:29:20.779 --> 02:29:31.325
He doesn't realize that Rick Bright made an orchestrated effort to get all the stuff ready to go so that we could manufacture lots and lots of doses of it even before we knew it would be useful.

02:29:31.365 --> 02:29:32.526
They knew it would be useful.

02:29:33.723 --> 02:29:35.485
Steve doesn't seem to be aware of that.

02:29:36.186 --> 02:29:38.948
And Robert Malone threw dexamethasone out there right away.

02:29:39.529 --> 02:29:42.772
Dexamethasone, unlike remdesivir, has its uses.

02:29:43.793 --> 02:29:44.154
Wow.

02:29:45.051 --> 02:29:46.332
by an object you cannot see.

02:29:46.372 --> 02:30:03.471
Now my claim is going to be, and this is something I've spent decades thinking about and working on, is that there is an emergent kind of phenomenon that fits regulatory capture but doesn't have the components that you would expect to find necessarily when you go looking for it, right?

02:30:03.751 --> 02:30:04.752
So regulatory capture

02:30:05.052 --> 02:30:06.673
as a concept has to be broadened.

02:30:06.793 --> 02:30:18.141
In other words, an industry comes to generate levers that it uses to influence processes, it increases the power with which those levers work, and somehow we are seeing the symptoms of that disease.

02:30:18.462 --> 02:30:24.386
And it comes out, as you point out, in biases in journals and what the editors do want and don't want.

02:30:24.706 --> 02:30:29.690
It comes out in, frankly, in the social media environment where what we're allowed to talk about

02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:32.191
is being curtailed and the effect of that.

02:30:32.371 --> 02:30:34.592
It's somehow very organic, it's odd.

02:30:34.752 --> 02:30:39.314
How is it that JAMA only publishes a negative ivermectin study?

02:30:39.394 --> 02:30:40.715
It is an emergent phenomenon, I agree.

02:30:40.735 --> 02:30:41.715
It's an emergent phenomenon.

02:30:41.735 --> 02:30:50.099
And so that means that this is a wicked problem in the sense that when we are trying to grapple with what it is that's doing this, it is very tempting to imagine

02:30:50.399 --> 02:31:01.223
That there must have been a meeting in which people decide it was okay for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, possibly millions to die needlessly, given a pandemic we might be able to end if we just simply decided to do it.

02:31:01.403 --> 02:31:02.923
But it doesn't have to have been a meeting.

02:31:03.003 --> 02:31:03.524
That's it.

02:31:03.664 --> 02:31:07.065
It can be a function of the underlying drivers.

02:31:07.365 --> 02:31:09.086
It can be a function of the underlying drivers.

02:31:09.106 --> 02:31:12.247
And if I can step into a murky realm here.

02:31:13.047 --> 02:31:15.168
But it could also be a meeting.

02:31:15.228 --> 02:31:16.388
It could also be a meeting.

02:31:16.428 --> 02:31:22.630
It could be like, if you looked at Tony Fauci's emails, like Chris Martinson has dissected those emails.

02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:23.431
Chris Martinson, oh my gosh.

02:31:23.451 --> 02:31:25.571
And there are redactions to that.

02:31:26.072 --> 02:31:28.553
They got Fauci's emails.

02:31:28.933 --> 02:31:30.993
And Chris analyzed the redactions.

02:31:31.193 --> 02:31:32.614
Here's the reasons for the redactions.

02:31:32.634 --> 02:31:33.774
So to your point, to the point.

02:31:33.794 --> 02:31:35.815
There is something going on here that people should be looking at.

02:31:35.835 --> 02:31:36.255
Beyond Chris.

02:31:36.295 --> 02:31:37.236
Okay, beyond Chris.

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:46.462
I mean, there's three major publications of record in the United States, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times.

02:31:47.578 --> 02:32:00.949
Both the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal came out with the conclusion that a lot of those redactions may hide things that were intended to be hidden.

02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:02.791
We can't prove that.

02:32:04.612 --> 02:32:09.777
Chris Martinson is a guy on the internet who has a website called Peak Prosperity.

02:32:10.782 --> 02:32:31.688
Chris Martinson was on PBS NewsHour about seven years ago as a guy who was a very successful pharma executive who decided to sell all that lifetime of luxury and wealth away and give up the fat rides on private jets to become a sustainable living farmer.

02:32:33.243 --> 02:32:51.637
So he got a farm and he's got water and, you know, solar and he grows stuff and he advocates for sustainability because he saw in already seven years ago and was featured on PBS NewsHour as a guy who saw that we were going in the wrong direction.

02:32:52.935 --> 02:32:59.982
And now he's basically on YouTube giving a play by play of what's happening to try and make sure that you see the direction we're going.

02:33:00.022 --> 02:33:01.343
He's not resisting it.

02:33:02.083 --> 02:33:04.185
He's just pointing out the directions we're going.

02:33:05.066 --> 02:33:13.414
And at this time, he was a very outspoken critic of this email chain and what had been redacted and what wasn't redacted.

02:33:13.454 --> 02:33:14.575
Essentially the Scooby Doo.

02:33:16.636 --> 02:33:27.405
And a little interesting tidbit, when I was invited to be in a secret signal chat with Brett Weinstein, one of the members of that signal chat was Chris Martenson.

02:33:27.765 --> 02:33:29.086
They were rejected.

02:33:29.267 --> 02:33:31.288
Robert, they were rejected illegally.

02:33:31.549 --> 02:33:33.310
OK, but what is clear?

02:33:33.330 --> 02:33:38.034
We're going to table this for the moment, because I think the important thing is we've got anomalies.

02:33:38.394 --> 02:33:39.075
Was there a meeting?

02:33:39.575 --> 02:33:42.798
I'm betting if there was a meeting, journal editors weren't invited.

02:33:45.861 --> 02:33:51.586
There were meetings, no doubt, and I bet you, if you tuned in on those meetings, you wouldn't necessarily know what was up.

02:33:51.866 --> 02:34:03.397
As a matter of fact, I would imagine that every time a new pharmaceutical is being brought to market by a company, they have some sort of meeting in which they say, we have this very exciting new drug, it has this potential market.

02:34:06.624 --> 02:34:10.867
The Ice Age Farmer is still at TheIceAgeFarmer.com.

02:34:10.887 --> 02:34:11.748
You can still find him.

02:34:12.428 --> 02:34:13.129
He's still working.

02:34:24.637 --> 02:34:27.200
It would have to be used off-label and that can't possibly be safe.

02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:28.261
So this is what we're going to highlight.

02:34:28.281 --> 02:34:29.743
It's not safe to use a drug off-label.

02:34:29.883 --> 02:34:31.184
Something like that is going to happen.

02:34:31.405 --> 02:34:36.090
It's not going to sound like people being deaf to the idea that people are going to die by the thousands, right?

02:34:36.130 --> 02:34:37.351
It's going to sound like something else.

02:34:37.912 --> 02:34:40.295
And so, anyway, what we do know now

02:34:41.456 --> 02:34:43.557
And people have been on this apparently for months.

02:34:43.817 --> 02:34:56.927
I became aware of this yesterday, which is that Merck, which very conspicuously, another anomaly on the list, attacked the safety of its own drug, Ivermectin, even though they knew from four decades of work.

02:34:56.947 --> 02:34:58.128
One of the safest drugs on the planet.

02:34:59.609 --> 02:35:05.234
Vincent Ransom Yellow's wife worked for Merck for almost 20 years on the drug Ivermectin.

02:35:05.774 --> 02:35:08.056
Curious data point, just throw it out there.

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:09.962
Right, so that was an anomaly.

02:35:10.022 --> 02:35:12.104
Why would Merck say that its own drug was unsafe?

02:35:12.845 --> 02:35:14.407
And citing no evidence.

02:35:15.148 --> 02:35:16.950
Well, there is no evidence.

02:35:17.291 --> 02:35:17.892
So why?

02:35:18.012 --> 02:35:22.137
Well, it turns out they have another drug headed rapidly for what?

02:35:22.257 --> 02:35:22.858
An EUA.

02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:26.021
What does the EUA require?

02:35:26.081 --> 02:35:33.606
It requires that there's no safe and effective therapy existing, because if there was, you wouldn't take the risk of fast-forwarding this process.

02:35:33.986 --> 02:35:37.248
And not only that, but they're also involved with Johnson & Johnson.

02:35:37.469 --> 02:35:40.150
They are a partner with Johnson & Johnson in producing their vaccines.

02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:42.272
So the point is, all right, we've got an anomaly.

02:35:42.332 --> 02:35:50.958
Why would Merck say things about its own drug that aren't true and that indicate that people should be afraid to apply it when the precautionary principle would actually suggest that they have to apply it?

02:35:50.978 --> 02:35:51.438
Oh, absolutely.

02:35:51.738 --> 02:36:00.444
Well, I don't know, it might have to do with the fact that their business, their portfolio of COVID therapies involves EUAs.

02:36:00.724 --> 02:36:12.232
So these days, there are really rigorous terms and conditions that have been propagated all throughout academic medicine regarding disclosure of conflict of interest.

02:36:13.613 --> 02:36:18.957
And this specific situation clearly meets those criteria.

02:36:19.659 --> 02:36:26.689
You mean they didn't say they were developing an alternative drug in the press release that they issued about ivermectin not working?

02:36:27.395 --> 02:36:27.715
Robert?

02:36:28.195 --> 02:36:47.605
So, all right, now let's just say... But look, I am sure that now that Tess Lowry's systematic review and meta-analysis, which is the highest level of evidence in evidence-based medicine, so once this is published, and this can be published either today or tomorrow... Now you're talking about her ivermectin.

02:36:47.645 --> 02:36:48.945
Her ivermectin, yes.

02:36:49.085 --> 02:36:51.607
Okay, so once this is published, I am sure

02:36:52.347 --> 02:37:07.568
that Gavi will stop running those anti-Ivermectin ads, that Google will refuse to run that, and that Google will change the YouTube policy and they will restore all those banned videos.

02:37:07.748 --> 02:37:08.928
This is the vaccine paper.

02:37:09.008 --> 02:37:10.909
So I don't have, unfortunately, I don't have test.

02:37:10.929 --> 02:37:12.289
Yes, no, no.

02:37:12.569 --> 02:37:13.490
But it will be published.

02:37:14.370 --> 02:37:16.470
It's supposed to be out either today or tomorrow.

02:37:16.711 --> 02:37:17.691
So this is the vaccine.

02:37:17.991 --> 02:37:24.773
And I've been watching the meta-analysis that is being done semi-independently of her.

02:37:26.393 --> 02:37:37.756
And I don't debate that the meta-analysis data for ivermectin, to my eye, is extremely encouraging.

02:37:37.956 --> 02:37:41.897
Okay, so let us collect our gains and move forward from here.

02:37:41.997 --> 02:37:47.898
What we have is data for ivermectin, to my eye, is extremely encouraging.

02:37:48.118 --> 02:37:55.241
Okay, so let us collect our data that the meta-analysis done semi-independently of her.

02:37:56.762 --> 02:38:08.128
And I don't debate that the meta-analysis data for ivermectin to my eye is extremely encouraging.

02:38:08.348 --> 02:38:14.431
Okay, so let us... So what a weird way to say that he thinks ivermectin works is that I don't debate

02:38:15.447 --> 02:38:19.114
that the data that I've seen with my own eyes is encouraging.

02:38:20.339 --> 02:38:23.081
Just listen, actively listen.

02:38:23.401 --> 02:38:25.642
Collect our gains and move forward from here.

02:38:25.762 --> 02:38:28.204
What we have is anomaly after anomaly.

02:38:28.364 --> 02:38:29.565
They all go in the same direction.

02:38:29.805 --> 02:38:32.507
We've got a plausible motive for distorting things.

02:38:32.947 --> 02:38:41.592
We've got the strong probability that they didn't decide to allow people to die by the thousands, and they didn't decide to inflict a dangerous pharmaceutical on people.

02:38:41.872 --> 02:38:47.336
That as the danger emerged, they took the standard action to be very, very skeptical of the danger.

02:38:47.436 --> 02:38:49.157
Wow, so they didn't do it on purpose.

02:38:51.133 --> 02:38:52.873
Obviously they didn't do it on purpose.

02:38:53.093 --> 02:38:55.774
Obviously they didn't give people a drug that would put them in danger.

02:38:55.974 --> 02:38:57.194
Obviously they didn't do that.

02:38:57.274 --> 02:38:58.315
What is happening here?

02:38:59.995 --> 02:39:05.596
Are we being actively told what happened by the moderator of this discussion?

02:39:07.076 --> 02:39:11.777
Are we being actively fed assumptions by the moderator of this discussion?

02:39:11.838 --> 02:39:13.658
Are we being led to the water here?

02:39:14.659 --> 02:39:16.220
I think we need to listen to this one again.

02:39:40.725 --> 02:39:49.934
You see, it has nothing to do with convincing people that there's a dangerous gain-of-function virus that's going to go around the world and can go around the world forever.

02:39:51.876 --> 02:39:53.578
It's to get products to market.

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:59.024
We're being fooled because they wanted to get products to market.

02:39:59.845 --> 02:40:01.746
We're not being fooled about the virus.

02:40:01.867 --> 02:40:02.848
That would be crazy.

02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:18.212
probability that they didn't decide to allow people to die by the thousands and they didn't inside decide to inflict a dangerous pharmaceutical on people that as the danger emerged they took the standard action to be very very skeptical of the data of danger.

02:40:18.232 --> 02:40:24.857
I love I love your thinking that this is an emergent phenomena of the system that it exists and its intrinsic flaws.

02:40:26.319 --> 02:40:32.667
I love the fact that you are describing it as though we couldn't have avoided this because the system is screwed up.

02:40:32.808 --> 02:40:34.650
You know, it's racist and stuff.

02:40:36.012 --> 02:40:38.756
It doesn't support transgender as much as it should.

02:40:39.941 --> 02:40:43.165
And it doesn't regulate gain-of-function research like it should.

02:40:43.546 --> 02:40:46.609
It doesn't regulate the pharmaceutical industries like it should.

02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:50.574
Our very shitty system is the reason why this happened.

02:40:51.435 --> 02:40:55.320
The reason why a gain-of-function virus is cruising around the Earth.

02:40:56.041 --> 02:41:01.606
The reason why we had to make choices about what to bring out, nobody did anything bad.

02:41:02.166 --> 02:41:04.328
There was no bad intentions at all.

02:41:04.929 --> 02:41:10.534
It's just a flawed system that Robert Malone has been getting rich from for 20 years.

02:41:11.374 --> 02:41:14.837
As a broker of vaccine technologies between governments,

02:41:15.678 --> 02:41:27.020
and non-governmental organizations as a contractor and grant writer to the tune of over five billion dollars in his career according to his own words.

02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:39.602
He knows the ins and outs of what is being done to us and I believe with my heart of hearts that this is just damage control theater here.

02:41:40.922 --> 02:41:45.183
We were led to believe, we were fooled into believing that we were figuring it out

02:41:46.869 --> 02:41:53.672
that these guys were coming out, that these guys were leading the way, that these guys were speaking out and saying things that need to be said.

02:41:54.052 --> 02:41:55.573
So why do I need to say anything?

02:41:57.614 --> 02:42:02.016
Obviously, Robert Malone is like the best guy to speak out.

02:42:02.076 --> 02:42:03.977
So I don't need to say anything as a doctor.

02:42:04.297 --> 02:42:07.459
I'll just wait and see what happens from Robert Malone speaking out.

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:14.302
And since everybody's seen the video, then everybody's seen Robert Malone speak out.

02:42:14.562 --> 02:42:16.123
So why would I need to do it?

02:42:17.714 --> 02:42:22.240
Why would I need to post on Facebook that this is ridiculous when Robert Malone's doing it?

02:42:23.342 --> 02:42:24.624
So everybody can see it.

02:42:24.944 --> 02:42:26.666
There's no reason for me to speak up.

02:42:27.628 --> 02:42:29.931
I'm just gonna wait and make sure everything will be fine.

02:42:30.632 --> 02:42:32.394
Obviously these guys are brilliant.

02:42:33.424 --> 02:42:36.867
These things extend, in my experience, they extend into all kinds of places.

02:42:36.907 --> 02:42:45.734
So you described that your contacts in the regulatory apparatus, in the FDA, I think you said, report that they're extremely busy and they're just under strain.

02:42:45.754 --> 02:42:47.896
But my guess is chronic condition, no?

02:42:48.096 --> 02:42:48.296
It is.

02:42:48.596 --> 02:42:56.462
So how do you end up with an FDA that chronically doesn't have enough people to deal with the data that comes in that might tell you that these things aren't safe?

02:42:56.482 --> 02:42:57.964
And what's worse is they want to accelerate

02:42:58.484 --> 02:43:21.592
the going from an EUA to approval they want to accelerate they're putting their their foot on the gas and they want to well then they want to vaccinate our kids they want to accelerate it at the same time so that's the am i wrong that's that's that's wrong phase four i'm happy that steve said that i'm happy that steve said that because that is the reason why i was sure this is wrong

02:43:23.803 --> 02:43:33.366
Because Fauci was talking about it, everybody was talking about it, that they're going to go down the age groups, they're going to get it to the college kids, then they're going to go for the children and get it on the childhood schedule.

02:43:33.966 --> 02:43:37.507
We said that before anybody else here at Gigome Biological.

02:43:39.107 --> 02:43:40.927
And Steve is saying it here right now.

02:43:41.488 --> 02:43:46.469
And Robert is biting his lips, got his hands all over his face.

02:43:50.199 --> 02:43:54.320
Body language experts, go ahead and chime in, because this is one revealing video.

02:43:54.781 --> 02:43:55.361
I'm going back.

02:43:55.381 --> 02:43:55.901
Phase four.

02:43:56.061 --> 02:43:59.682
Accelerate the going from an EUA to approval.

02:43:59.722 --> 02:44:00.703
They want to accelerate.

02:44:00.743 --> 02:44:06.465
They're putting their foot on the gas, and they want to vaccinate our kids.

02:44:06.605 --> 02:44:09.366
They want to accelerate it at the same time.

02:44:09.506 --> 02:44:10.586
Am I wrong?

02:44:10.826 --> 02:44:11.286
That's wrong.

02:44:11.326 --> 02:44:12.767
We are in phase four.

02:44:13.547 --> 02:44:15.328
of these drug trials.

02:44:15.568 --> 02:44:19.309
Phase four being you release it to the public and then you monitor what happened.

02:44:19.329 --> 02:44:24.311
You need to explain all those deaths before you go and get it approved.

02:44:24.551 --> 02:44:25.232
Yes, you're wrong.

02:44:25.592 --> 02:44:25.912
Oh, okay.

02:44:25.932 --> 02:44:27.733
He started ignoring Steve there.

02:44:27.753 --> 02:44:28.413
Did you see that?

02:44:29.033 --> 02:44:30.114
He let Steve go on.

02:44:30.134 --> 02:44:37.837
He touched, touched Brett on the arm and said, I'm going to, you know, signal that he was going to ignore Steve and talk through him.

02:44:37.877 --> 02:44:38.597
Watch carefully.

02:44:39.662 --> 02:44:43.046
for being, you release it to the public and then you monitor what happened.

02:44:43.106 --> 02:44:48.011
You need to explain all those deaths before you go and get it approved.

02:44:48.252 --> 02:44:48.492
Yes.

02:44:48.572 --> 02:44:52.076
You need to explain all those deaths before you go get it approved.

02:44:52.717 --> 02:44:54.859
And he's just going to talk right over that.

02:44:54.919 --> 02:45:00.065
That's the only, that's the only point that Steve's ever made that I think I still agree with.

02:45:03.137 --> 02:45:11.140
That it should never have been given to a single person under the age of 65 once we realized that those people above 65 were dying.

02:45:14.262 --> 02:45:18.683
It should have never been given to anyone under 50 once we realized that people above 50 were dying.

02:45:21.705 --> 02:45:26.867
It should have never been given to anybody that was in shape that had taken care of themselves or chose to say no.

02:45:31.044 --> 02:45:32.385
It should have never been coerced.

02:45:32.465 --> 02:45:35.568
It should have never been driven into workplaces.

02:45:37.250 --> 02:45:40.132
But of course, all around the world, they did it with healthcare workers.

02:45:41.834 --> 02:45:47.319
They put our nurses and our doctors and their reputations on the line with intense coercion.

02:45:49.605 --> 02:45:52.226
And you don't think for one second that this is coercion?

02:45:52.426 --> 02:45:59.947
Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein and Steve Kirsch talking about them being doubly vaccinated as a way of getting out of this?

02:46:00.307 --> 02:46:09.269
You don't think coercion is Jordan Peterson going on YouTube and saying, let's give them since months, take the shot and get this over with?

02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:15.130
Take the shot and get it over with.

02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:18.131
We're double vaccinated with Moderna, let them inject

02:46:19.091 --> 02:46:42.007
something into you because we say so because we had good intentions because nobody meant to hurt anybody they keep wavering they keep wavering because they're not holding their arms straight they're not holding their arms straight don't you see it

02:46:46.001 --> 02:46:46.401
You're wrong.

02:46:46.762 --> 02:46:47.182
Okay.

02:46:47.202 --> 02:46:47.443
Okay.

02:46:47.583 --> 02:46:48.023
Here's why.

02:46:48.043 --> 02:46:48.764
Okay.

02:46:49.545 --> 02:46:52.769
Phase four is what happens after market authorization.

02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:55.600
Oh, and we haven't got, so technically we're not in phase four.

02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:56.161
Absolutely not.

02:46:56.181 --> 02:46:56.321
Right?

02:46:56.781 --> 02:46:57.061
Okay.

02:46:57.121 --> 02:46:58.161
So here's the thing.

02:46:58.361 --> 02:46:59.701
We're still in phase three.

02:46:59.901 --> 02:47:03.002
These are still, this is bedrock to understanding the bioethics.

02:47:03.022 --> 02:47:03.582
This is phase three.

02:47:03.602 --> 02:47:05.462
These are still experimental products.

02:47:05.502 --> 02:47:06.602
This is phase three.

02:47:06.782 --> 02:47:07.603
That's why it's called.

02:47:07.623 --> 02:47:11.143
The emergency authorization did not require the collective.

02:47:11.163 --> 02:47:21.105
So if you want to understand the bioethics of it from Robert Malone's perspective, what he means by bioethics is what do they tell themselves to justify this is okay?

02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:26.802
What do they say in the secret meetings to justify that this is okay?

02:47:27.122 --> 02:47:32.704
If you want to understand the bedrock of the bioethics here, you have to understand the PrEP Act.

02:47:32.984 --> 02:47:35.226
You have to understand emergency countermeasures.

02:47:35.626 --> 02:47:40.348
You have to understand secret meetings where people tell people that pandemics are possible.

02:47:40.748 --> 02:47:51.333
You have to understand that these people were coerced, convinced over many years that this is a real danger and that we have real solutions in the pipeline for this real danger.

02:47:53.038 --> 02:48:12.171
And the guy who was in the solution pipeline for years involved in brokering these ideas and in governing these ideas, funding these ideas as a, as a member of these study sections, chairman of these study sections is Robert Malone.

02:48:12.191 --> 02:48:21.637
And he's got a lot of people believing that he's given up some career

02:48:23.217 --> 02:48:31.264
that he sacrificed everything in order to come out of retirement and speak on behalf of humanity.

02:48:31.484 --> 02:48:41.592
And I am finding that more and more dubious every day because the pins don't line up in a line like he wants them to.

02:48:42.453 --> 02:48:46.056
His behaviors don't line up in a line like he wants them to.

02:48:46.396 --> 02:48:49.939
His career doesn't line up in that line like he wants it to.

02:48:52.372 --> 02:48:55.195
He hasn't kept his arms straight, ladies and gentlemen.

02:48:55.235 --> 02:48:56.437
None of these men have.

02:49:00.902 --> 02:49:04.766
Of the requisite data to figure out whether or not it should go to phase four.

02:49:06.329 --> 02:49:11.453
um, the data that are being collected, you know, that's the, am I wrong?

02:49:11.473 --> 02:49:12.793
That's, that's, that's wrong.

02:49:12.954 --> 02:49:20.399
Phase four of these drug trials phase four being, you release it to the public and then you monitor what happened.

02:49:20.419 --> 02:49:25.402
You need to explain all those deaths before, before you go and get it approved.

02:49:25.642 --> 02:49:26.323
Yes, you're wrong.

02:49:26.663 --> 02:49:27.103
Okay.

02:49:27.123 --> 02:49:27.383
Okay.

02:49:27.503 --> 02:49:27.944
Here's why.

02:49:27.964 --> 02:49:28.704
Okay.

02:49:29.465 --> 02:49:32.687
Phase four is what happens after market authorization.

02:49:33.155 --> 02:49:35.516
Oh, and we haven't got, so technically we're not in phase four.

02:49:35.656 --> 02:49:36.076
Absolutely not.

02:49:36.096 --> 02:49:36.236
Right.

02:49:36.696 --> 02:49:36.976
Okay.

02:49:37.036 --> 02:49:38.076
So here's the thing.

02:49:38.276 --> 02:49:39.377
We're still in phase three.

02:49:39.417 --> 02:49:42.698
We're, these are still, this is bedrock to understanding the bioethics.

02:49:42.718 --> 02:49:43.418
This is phase three.

02:49:43.438 --> 02:49:45.358
These are still experimental products.

02:49:45.659 --> 02:49:48.999
Did Steve just laugh at him for saying that this is still phase three?

02:49:49.019 --> 02:49:51.300
I think he did.

02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:52.921
This is phase three.

02:49:53.101 --> 02:49:53.941
That's why it's called.

02:49:53.961 --> 02:50:01.763
The emergency authorization did not require the collection of the requisite data to figure out whether or not it should go to phase four.

02:50:04.644 --> 02:50:16.609
The data that are being collected are not being done in a rigorous fashion and basically my colleagues are telling me they're extremely frustrated because they can't make heads or tails out of the data.

02:50:16.949 --> 02:50:19.170
Not only that, they can't, they have not...

02:50:19.990 --> 02:50:25.773
The public doesn't know how many people have died from the vaccine.

02:50:25.893 --> 02:50:27.773
I want you to sketch the picture.

02:50:28.114 --> 02:50:32.135
Of course, we are obligated to err in the right direction.

02:50:32.175 --> 02:50:33.496
But what does this picture look like?

02:50:33.536 --> 02:50:37.398
How many people could you say we know have died and how many people might have died?

02:50:37.438 --> 02:50:40.419
And what does the distinction between those two numbers depend on?

02:50:41.079 --> 02:50:54.758
So in the VAERS database, which is voluntary, the US government commissioned a study to find out how much underreporting this is, and they estimate that it could be only 1% of the reports

02:50:57.461 --> 02:50:58.441
that are actually reported.

02:50:58.641 --> 02:51:04.904
That 99 out of 100 don't get reported, which means 5,000 reports translates into 500,000 deaths.

02:51:04.944 --> 02:51:06.404
And I don't think it's that high.

02:51:06.524 --> 02:51:06.724
Right.

02:51:07.024 --> 02:51:08.025
It's very unlikely to be that high.

02:51:08.045 --> 02:51:15.167
It's unlikely that, you know, because, right, you know, there are mortuaries would be, you know, overrun with, you know, With vaccine deaths.

02:51:15.287 --> 02:51:15.487
Okay.

02:51:15.567 --> 02:51:18.888
So what, it's not that high, but, but it's higher.

02:51:19.329 --> 02:51:21.689
It's, I guarantee you, it's higher.

02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:25.651
The mortuaries would be overrun with vaccine deaths.

02:51:26.411 --> 02:51:27.352
says Robert Malone.

02:51:28.132 --> 02:51:45.844
But of course, since no effort is being made to differentiate between vaccine deaths and COVID deaths, and oftentimes they're called COVID deaths because John Baldwin has shown us that they were doing that all the time, calling vaccinated deaths COVID deaths in Massachusetts and elsewhere.

02:51:47.606 --> 02:51:49.287
Again, we're not getting the picture here.

02:51:49.607 --> 02:51:51.588
They're not teaching us the picture here.

02:51:52.189 --> 02:51:53.470
This is obfuscation.

02:51:54.346 --> 02:51:55.467
This is confusion.

02:51:55.847 --> 02:51:57.008
This is frustration.

02:51:57.068 --> 02:51:58.349
This is incongruency.

02:51:58.870 --> 02:52:00.711
This is sowing fear and doubt.

02:52:07.337 --> 02:52:13.021
The all cause mortality was up above normal in June of 2021 and not because of COVID.

02:52:16.564 --> 02:52:17.425
And these guys know it.

02:52:18.522 --> 02:52:24.965
The 5,000 that we know about, there are going to be a few of those that are actually just sampling error.

02:52:25.365 --> 02:52:28.767
And then there's going to be the great majority of them which are connected to the vaccine.

02:52:28.787 --> 02:52:30.568
But none of them have been explained.

02:52:30.788 --> 02:52:30.928
Right.

02:52:30.968 --> 02:52:32.869
But none of them has been investigated.

02:52:32.909 --> 02:52:40.233
We are all old enough to have lived through the period in which every single person on earth knew that cigarettes caused cancer.

02:52:40.313 --> 02:52:45.735
But we were fighting in court about whether or not you could prove it, because no individual death could be established on that basis.

02:52:45.795 --> 02:52:46.876
It took a long time.

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:55.180
to get to the point where what we all knew about the population level meant anything about what happened to the individual who died of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking, right?

02:52:55.481 --> 02:53:06.747
I think the point that I'm trying to make here, if anybody has any questions about it, is that right now, the definitive leader of the dissident movement is Robert Malone.

02:53:07.627 --> 02:53:14.331
The definitive authority on what we should be thinking of as the biology of this pandemic is Robert Malone.

02:53:15.367 --> 02:53:18.250
The person that people are rallying around is Robert Malone.

02:53:18.791 --> 02:53:20.973
The person that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:53:21.033 --> 02:53:23.475
talks to about this is Robert Malone.

02:53:25.197 --> 02:53:28.260
People have been bamboozled by Robert Malone.

02:53:29.482 --> 02:53:31.023
That's what I kind of think now.

02:53:31.837 --> 02:53:38.720
because his track record and his career suggests that he's not doing what he says he's doing.

02:53:39.261 --> 02:53:56.789
His performance here on the Dark Horse Podcast is worth watching because if you watch it, he says the vaccine works, it's great, this technology is wonderful, it saved a lot of people, but the spike protein is toxic and so it might have hurt people too.

02:53:57.389 --> 02:54:03.433
But we made a judgment call, people made a judgment call, this is where we are, now we have to deal with it.

02:54:07.075 --> 02:54:09.316
And he's six months too late to save anybody.

02:54:11.157 --> 02:54:13.339
And he's still not advocating for it to stop.

02:54:14.259 --> 02:54:18.542
He still hasn't said in the first hour that we shouldn't give it to healthy adults.

02:54:19.502 --> 02:54:20.944
He hasn't been explicit.

02:54:21.124 --> 02:54:34.523
In fact, they started this whole podcast by telling people that the reason why we're able to unmask is because Brett uses ivermectin as a prophylactic and the other two of us are fully vaccinated with Moderna.

02:54:34.903 --> 02:54:36.526
That's why we're watching this again.

02:54:37.674 --> 02:54:50.998
because these people are responsible for laying down the narrative, for laying down the Scooby-Doo, for fooling us into using this transfection technology, and they are continuing to claim that they didn't.

02:54:52.579 --> 02:54:55.359
Robert Malone is pretending like he tried to save us.

02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:56.240
He didn't.

02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:01.341
Here's where he came out in June of 2021, and he's not telling us to stop.

02:55:07.332 --> 02:55:08.973
He's not talking about zinc.

02:55:08.993 --> 02:55:10.575
He's not talking about coseratin.

02:55:10.595 --> 02:55:12.476
He's not talking about hydroxychloroquine.

02:55:12.817 --> 02:55:15.079
He's not talking about a basic immunology.

02:55:15.639 --> 02:55:17.781
He's not telling you about T cell immunity.

02:55:18.181 --> 02:55:25.688
He's not telling you about the homology between the RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the end protein of previous coronaviruses.

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:32.894
And this one, he's not talking at all about the fact that the PCR test can't possibly be as specific as they say it is.

02:55:34.246 --> 02:55:43.023
He's not talking about the fact that they're, they're, they're disingenuously representing a casedemic with the, they haven't said that once, not once.

02:55:52.645 --> 02:55:53.526
So we are there.

02:55:53.606 --> 02:56:02.296
We are playing games with what's obvious from the data and what can be denied on the basis of fancy arguments and statistics that most people don't understand.

02:56:02.336 --> 02:56:03.597
It's hard to deny this.

02:56:03.617 --> 02:56:04.218
Yeah, it is.

02:56:04.378 --> 02:56:09.684
And I think this is a great opportunity to segue to this compilation from the UK.

02:56:10.485 --> 02:56:10.645
Yep.

02:56:11.045 --> 02:56:18.749
Of adverse events that's been done in a responsible, rigorous fashion by a meticulous researcher that's well-respected.

02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:19.829
You're talking about the Teslauri.

02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:22.010
Teslauri in the UK.

02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:25.052
You want to see... Who, by the way, is not being funded by anyone.

02:56:25.532 --> 02:56:27.694
You know, she is like doing this on her own nickel.

02:56:28.234 --> 02:56:32.538
Nobody has been willing to... That's another can of worms.

02:56:33.478 --> 02:56:36.641
But the point is that she's got no conflict of interest here.

02:56:36.741 --> 02:56:39.243
She's been the champion of ivermectin.

02:56:39.623 --> 02:56:45.147
And then she looked at what was happening in the UK database, and you're seeing the same thing as in VAERS.

02:56:45.248 --> 02:56:46.569
So let's look at the data.

02:56:46.589 --> 02:56:48.550
Yeah, let's look at it.

02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:50.332
Let's look at the data.

02:56:50.392 --> 02:56:51.552
Steve, can you tee this up?

02:56:52.293 --> 02:56:53.216
Give us some context.

02:56:53.939 --> 02:56:55.423
What is the source of this data?

02:56:55.905 --> 02:56:56.788
Tee this up.

02:56:56.908 --> 02:56:58.573
Steve, can you tee this up?

02:56:59.718 --> 02:57:00.858
Now they're very rehearsed.

02:57:01.699 --> 02:57:02.299
What are these data?

02:57:02.399 --> 02:57:07.260
So this is, if you go to the first page, they have a yellow tag system in Britain.

02:57:07.660 --> 02:57:08.200
Which means?

02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:13.062
It is Britain's version of the VAERS system in the US.

02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:25.025
So it's a voluntary reporting system where, and in Britain, they have three vaccines, primarily the AstraZeneca vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, and the Moderna vaccine.

02:57:25.605 --> 02:57:28.486
So the first time he's nodding, you see that?

02:57:29.947 --> 02:57:33.308
It is Britain's version of the Vera system in the US.

02:57:33.569 --> 02:57:35.509
So it's a voluntary reporting system.

02:57:35.789 --> 02:57:37.390
So look, he cued him up.

02:57:37.430 --> 02:57:38.311
He cued him up.

02:57:38.371 --> 02:57:42.232
And then he nods for the first time.

02:57:42.492 --> 02:57:43.313
Let's look at the data.

02:57:43.333 --> 02:57:44.253
Yeah, let's look at it.

02:57:44.273 --> 02:57:45.454
Let's look at the data.

02:57:45.734 --> 02:57:48.195
So this, can you, Steve, can you tee this up?

02:57:48.835 --> 02:57:50.356
Give us some context.

02:57:50.596 --> 02:57:52.077
What is the source of this data?

02:57:52.197 --> 02:57:52.857
What are these data?

02:57:52.957 --> 02:57:53.538
Watch him nod.

02:57:53.558 --> 02:57:57.820
So this is, if you go to the first page, they have a yellow tag system in Britain.

02:57:58.240 --> 02:57:58.781
Which means?

02:57:59.581 --> 02:58:00.162
Which means?

02:58:00.242 --> 02:58:01.682
It is Britain's version.

02:58:02.083 --> 02:58:04.624
How come he didn't act like that any other part?

02:58:06.185 --> 02:58:09.827
Which means he's never done that through this whole thing.

02:58:09.867 --> 02:58:12.809
He's never interrupted anybody, but now he's leading Steve.

02:58:13.985 --> 02:58:15.605
of the VAERS system in the U.S.

02:58:15.865 --> 02:58:27.588
So it's a voluntary reporting system where, and in Britain we have three vaccines primarily, the AstraZeneca vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine, and the Moderna vaccine.

02:58:27.948 --> 02:58:31.088
So the AstraZeneca is an adenovirus DNA vaccine?

02:58:31.248 --> 02:58:31.888
Right, correct.

02:58:31.949 --> 02:58:34.109
So all three vaccines in the U.K.

02:58:34.289 --> 02:58:38.770
are based on gene therapy technology and are producing

02:58:40.050 --> 02:58:45.155
So right now he seems to say that all gene therapy is bad, but I wasn't gonna do gene therapy I was gonna do

02:58:46.135 --> 02:58:49.136
you know, DNA in a, in a, in a electro parading gun.

02:58:49.496 --> 02:58:51.417
Spike protein in cells.

02:58:51.677 --> 02:58:51.897
Right.

02:58:52.017 --> 02:59:04.343
The genes have been introduced to, they've either been introduced in the form of the DNA of an adenovirus of cold virus that we all get, or in the form of an RNA that's artificially inserted and artificially synthesized.

02:59:04.383 --> 02:59:05.463
So forgive my ignorance here.

02:59:05.943 --> 02:59:10.005
In the case of the DNA vaccines, the DNA is integrated into the nuclear genome or not?

02:59:10.325 --> 02:59:10.605
Not.

02:59:10.645 --> 02:59:10.765
Not.

02:59:10.785 --> 02:59:11.745
That's what I thought.

02:59:11.825 --> 02:59:15.146
It sort of stays on top.

02:59:15.426 --> 02:59:17.926
It's attached.

02:59:18.146 --> 02:59:19.827
Yeah, it's epigenetic.

02:59:20.367 --> 02:59:24.327
You can think of it as a small circular extra chromosome.

02:59:24.347 --> 02:59:26.528
It's like a plasmid that has gotten in there.

02:59:26.548 --> 02:59:27.508
For mammalian cells.

02:59:27.748 --> 02:59:37.270
So I always worry when people say gene therapy technology that they are painting a picture that actually isn't quite right here, even though that's technically accurate, I assume, because you're using the term.

02:59:39.090 --> 02:59:40.152
I don't know how else to say it.

02:59:40.452 --> 02:59:43.156
You could call it transfection and transformation.

02:59:43.196 --> 02:59:47.442
If you use DNA to express proteins, it's called transformation.

02:59:48.504 --> 02:59:53.832
And so the adenovirus vectors were transformation vectors, transformation methodologies.

02:59:54.927 --> 02:59:59.693
And if you use mRNA to express a protein, that's called transfection.

02:59:59.753 --> 03:00:01.956
That's how, that's how you call it.

03:00:02.377 --> 03:00:03.879
That's the term that you use.

03:00:04.539 --> 03:00:06.342
That's the term we've used for 20 years.

03:00:07.023 --> 03:00:11.128
And at least the dude in the white shirt knows that beyond a shadow of a doubt.

03:00:13.983 --> 03:00:21.165
The guy that founded Crucell was the senior postdoc in the gene therapy lab that I worked at at the Salk, Dinko Valerio.

03:00:21.865 --> 03:00:29.707
And he came to me once, a few years after Crucell had been founded, which was a gene therapy company based on adenoviral vectors.

03:00:30.388 --> 03:00:31.868
And he said to me, Robert, you're right.

03:00:32.813 --> 03:00:34.434
We should use this for vaccines.

03:00:36.415 --> 03:00:41.337
And he pivoted Crucell to being a vaccine company, and the rest is history.

03:00:41.377 --> 03:00:45.659
It was bought by J&J, and that is the basis for the J&J technology.

03:00:45.759 --> 03:00:51.762
It is explicitly a retooled gene therapy method applied to vaccines.

03:00:52.223 --> 03:00:52.623
Full stop.

03:00:53.223 --> 03:00:57.527
Okay, so you were telling us about what we've got here.

03:00:57.747 --> 03:00:59.348
I do want to correct one thing.

03:00:59.368 --> 03:01:00.689
It just came out this morning.

03:01:00.929 --> 03:01:03.451
I just got it this morning at like 5 a.m.

03:01:03.531 --> 03:01:04.272
So let me pause you.

03:01:05.093 --> 03:01:13.539
In your piece, I believe it is not, you have to do some work to realize that the number of deaths that we're talking about, that 5,000 number, that's U.S.

03:01:14.700 --> 03:01:15.441
That's US only.

03:01:15.501 --> 03:01:16.201
Oh yeah, yeah, no.

03:01:16.282 --> 03:01:19.104
In Europe, it's like over 12,000.

03:01:19.725 --> 03:01:22.107
It's the self-reported deaths.

03:01:22.287 --> 03:01:23.328
Yeah, self-reported deaths.

03:01:23.388 --> 03:01:24.309
Self-reported deaths.

03:01:24.329 --> 03:01:26.551
So it's probably a lower bound on that number.

03:01:26.571 --> 03:01:26.951
Yeah.

03:01:26.971 --> 03:01:31.134
If you think through, Mary has died after getting a vaccine.

03:01:31.895 --> 03:01:36.399
and you're the relatives of Mary, and you're dealing with a whole bunch of stuff.

03:01:36.919 --> 03:01:45.005
Okay, the probability that you're going to say to yourself, self, I need to log on to a website.

03:01:45.205 --> 03:01:50.349
So my point is only, it's understandable, but this is the problem with self-reported databases.

03:01:50.409 --> 03:01:50.890
Right.

03:01:51.450 --> 03:01:52.030
It's a bias.

03:01:52.170 --> 03:01:55.073
It's a bias in a direction we can infer.

03:01:55.133 --> 03:01:55.573
Well known.

03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:02.330
So is that a problem?

03:02:03.611 --> 03:02:05.613
Is Malone saying, well, that sucks.

03:02:05.653 --> 03:02:06.834
That's just the way it is.

03:02:08.535 --> 03:02:13.320
Is he, is he admitting that all that means that other vaccines could also have a problem?

03:02:15.161 --> 03:02:26.151
See, that's what Steve never really seems to get is that he uses this metric from this Harvard paper to say that there are 40 times as many

03:02:28.487 --> 03:02:32.750
injuries from the vax because the Harvard study showed that they're mostly underreported.

03:02:35.212 --> 03:02:43.138
But then now we show this number and we pretend that the previous numbers are okay and that this number is really high now and it's even higher.

03:02:45.599 --> 03:02:54.706
So why doesn't Steve apply that correction across the whole graph so that we can see that the vaccine schedule has always been underplayed

03:02:55.936 --> 03:03:08.545
And that we can see that in addition to that underplaying the injuries caused by the normal vaccine schedule by 40 times, which is what that paper showed, that we're also having an underreporting now.

03:03:09.066 --> 03:03:18.072
So while they talk about it as if, yeah, but nobody ever reports the injury to Mary if she gets injured, because nobody thinks that the vaccines do anything wrong.

03:03:18.112 --> 03:03:19.514
And that's always the way it's been.

03:03:20.414 --> 03:03:24.197
That's just the downside of self-reporting systems.

03:03:24.317 --> 03:03:25.278
Wah, wah.

03:03:28.806 --> 03:03:37.198
And so they're actually talking around the fact that what they're saying obviously means that the childhood vaccination schedule needs revisiting.

03:03:37.238 --> 03:03:39.521
But of course, they're not going to say that.

03:03:40.202 --> 03:03:44.689
They want you to think that it's isolated to this particular vaccine.

03:03:46.854 --> 03:03:50.236
But the underreporting applies to the previous vaccines, guys.

03:03:50.256 --> 03:03:54.299
I want to say that number, 5,000, is a very frightening number.

03:03:54.639 --> 03:04:00.744
It's an especially frightening number in comparison to the US population, when we basically have to extrapolate out.

03:04:01.024 --> 03:04:05.687
And the data from Israel, from Europe, seems to reflect the same pattern.

03:04:05.747 --> 03:04:09.150
It's the subset of the US population that's accepted vaccine.

03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.731
So it's not the whole U.S.

03:04:10.751 --> 03:04:10.992
population.

03:04:11.092 --> 03:04:11.833
Right, right, right, right.

03:04:11.913 --> 03:04:12.214
True.

03:04:12.434 --> 03:04:13.676
It's a much smaller number.

03:04:13.736 --> 03:04:14.898
Right, 130 some odd.

03:04:15.539 --> 03:04:20.887
But the other thing is, look, I mean, I contacted the FDA when I saw this and I said, so what do you think?

03:04:20.907 --> 03:04:24.933
They said, oh, you should contact a specialist who understands the VAERS data.

03:04:25.273 --> 03:04:27.514
And I said, you know, I thought I understood it pretty well.

03:04:27.554 --> 03:04:43.199
I did an analysis on trial site news where I show, there's a video on trial site news where I do some analysis and it shows, oh, this is like at least a hundred times worse than the flu virus in terms of the death.

03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:47.421
the flu vaccine in terms of deaths.

03:04:47.801 --> 03:04:55.566
And I argue actually that it's like a thousand times more than the flu vaccine in the paper.

03:04:55.646 --> 03:05:00.249
And so that's kind of a straightforward, unadjusted analysis.

03:05:00.269 --> 03:05:01.589
Can I transition to what we're looking at here?

03:05:01.649 --> 03:05:02.490
No, no, let me finish.

03:05:06.272 --> 03:05:08.393
because the FDA told me to go to an expert.

03:05:08.834 --> 03:05:22.782
So I contacted the open VAERS people who are looking at this data, and I said, so it says 5,000, what do you guys think based on, you've been doing this for years, what do you think the true number is?

03:05:23.663 --> 03:05:30.327
And they told me that, of course, nobody really knows, but based on their analysis, they put it around 20,000 deaths.

03:05:32.569 --> 03:05:35.072
that are, you know, for the real numbers.

03:05:35.092 --> 03:05:37.074
So that's just their opinion.

03:05:37.935 --> 03:05:40.438
But can we segue to this?

03:05:40.498 --> 03:05:40.999
Am I right?

03:05:41.159 --> 03:05:41.420
Hang on.

03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:45.505
Am I right that even at the lower bound number,

03:05:46.101 --> 03:05:47.882
5,000.

03:05:46.281 --> 03:05:47.882
It's a stopping condition.

03:05:48.162 --> 03:06:03.529
Well, not only is it a stopping condition, but I mean, you tell me if I've got the statistic that you reported incorrect, but I believe what you say is that that number is more deaths than for all 70 other vaccines combined over the last 30 years.

03:06:03.549 --> 03:06:03.649
Right.

03:06:04.089 --> 03:06:05.210
So that tells you something.

03:06:05.310 --> 03:06:15.879
Yeah, and also the adverse effects, if you look at those, it's not just the deaths that are... So now let's look at the adverse effects.

03:06:16.279 --> 03:06:16.520
No, wait!

03:06:17.741 --> 03:06:19.402
Please, let me finish, okay?

03:06:19.422 --> 03:06:20.043
Stop interrupting.

03:06:21.303 --> 03:06:22.223
All right, we're good.

03:06:22.263 --> 03:06:22.764
OK, good.

03:06:23.084 --> 03:06:25.004
So there are two aspects.

03:06:25.604 --> 03:06:31.726
That if you look at this vaccine in terms of deaths, it's more than all the other ones.

03:06:32.066 --> 03:06:42.068
If you look at it in terms of adverse events reported, it's also more than all the other vaccines over 30 years combined.

03:06:42.468 --> 03:06:45.709
So if it's not, I'm OK.

03:06:45.749 --> 03:06:47.389
Look, if it's not, if it's, you know.

03:06:47.989 --> 03:06:49.450
Steve is actually.

03:06:50.450 --> 03:07:01.559
off the hook right here and I see him as yet unread in he just hasn't been completely clued in to what the objective is here

03:07:02.461 --> 03:07:05.883
And he still thinks that he is spreading information to save people.

03:07:06.323 --> 03:07:07.824
It's really cute, actually.

03:07:08.265 --> 03:07:22.193
We have a hypothesis that because this toxic spike protein breaks off and goes into your brain and heart and all over and causes these weird stuff, that's totally consistent with what we're observing.

03:07:22.673 --> 03:07:24.975
And if somebody has a better hypothesis

03:07:25.675 --> 03:07:27.416
in terms of what is causing this.

03:07:28.077 --> 03:07:33.000
It's in the water, it's in the drinking supply, you know, whatever, whatever it is, let's hear it.

03:07:33.060 --> 03:07:35.842
What would the dimension of the thing that explains it have to be?

03:07:35.862 --> 03:07:40.085
It would have to be something like someone put this in the data, right?

03:07:40.245 --> 03:07:43.167
Which would then not explain all of the people that we run into.

03:07:43.267 --> 03:07:49.351
Yeah, somebody over-reported, somebody's gaming the Vera system, for example, but that's a federal crime.

03:07:49.431 --> 03:07:55.555
Not only is it a federal crime, but the fact is the anecdotal stuff that we can all detect by asking people

03:07:55.615 --> 03:07:56.376
confirms it.

03:07:56.556 --> 03:07:58.597
It says actually there's a real pattern.

03:07:58.657 --> 03:07:59.278
And guess what?

03:07:59.818 --> 03:08:02.881
The exact same pattern exists in the UK.

03:08:02.921 --> 03:08:08.265
So when I got this report, and you look through it, look at all the symptoms here.

03:08:08.345 --> 03:08:10.927
Look at all the deaths in each of these categories.

03:08:11.167 --> 03:08:12.908
And look at the breadth of this.

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:14.109
And it's two pages.

03:08:14.189 --> 03:08:16.030
So this is the first page.

03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:22.535
This is just the- This is bleeding, clotting, and ischemic adverse drug reactions up to the 26th of May.

03:08:23.516 --> 03:08:23.736
Right.

03:08:23.836 --> 03:08:30.281
And then the next page, and look at all these disorders that happen, and then it's now an immune system.

03:08:30.301 --> 03:08:31.542
Immune system, adverse drug reaction.

03:08:31.562 --> 03:08:33.524
We haven't even gotten to ADE and all the other things.

03:08:33.544 --> 03:08:34.545
Steve, can I ask a question?

03:08:34.765 --> 03:08:40.309
Because many of these adverse events were already known with the recombinant adenovirus vectors.

03:08:41.950 --> 03:08:42.811
It's already been

03:08:44.552 --> 03:08:46.513
These were expected before?

03:08:46.573 --> 03:08:49.794
No, it's particularly the clotting disorders.

03:08:50.595 --> 03:08:53.316
We've known for quite a while that they were associated.

03:08:53.336 --> 03:08:55.116
That's why the J&J vaccine was stopped.

03:08:55.137 --> 03:09:00.359
When you say quite a while, you mean since the release of these vaccines into the human population.

03:09:00.419 --> 03:09:01.799
Yeah, like a couple months ago.

03:09:02.279 --> 03:09:03.200
Remember, we had a pause.

03:09:04.761 --> 03:09:07.382
And why was it detected in the phase 3 studies?

03:09:08.563 --> 03:09:10.544
Phase 3 studies are supposed to be perfect.

03:09:10.584 --> 03:09:12.925
You talk to an academic, they always tell you phase 3.

03:09:13.045 --> 03:09:14.266
I'm going somewhere with this.

03:09:15.967 --> 03:09:26.914
Steve, can you tell me this aggregated adverse event log that Tess has provided, is this in the UK based on the yellow cards?

03:09:27.754 --> 03:09:27.974
Okay.

03:09:28.835 --> 03:09:30.576
Is this for all three vaccines?

03:09:31.016 --> 03:09:31.396
Yes.

03:09:32.116 --> 03:09:33.037
It's a yellow card system.

03:09:33.377 --> 03:09:34.878
It's all aggregated.

03:09:34.918 --> 03:09:43.142
So what that means is we need to be a little cautious because we don't know which of those three vaccines of which represents two different technologies.

03:09:43.222 --> 03:09:43.422
Right.

03:09:43.482 --> 03:09:45.383
She doesn't have a breakdown.

03:09:45.803 --> 03:09:48.425
And my point is that we already knew

03:09:49.511 --> 03:09:55.236
that the advectors were associated with the coagulopathies, the clotting disorders that were in table one.

03:09:56.217 --> 03:09:58.099
Holy cow, so here he's saying it.

03:09:58.539 --> 03:10:00.601
This was a narrative that's been busted, of course.

03:10:02.323 --> 03:10:07.007
But as you're well aware, they pulled the J&J shot because some people had some clotting.

03:10:08.449 --> 03:10:14.854
And so that was their attempt at showing you that if something went wrong, they would definitely pull the shot.

03:10:15.765 --> 03:10:29.736
And so if they, of course, pulled the adenovirus vector, which curiously is the one that Robert is pointing out is associated with the coagulopathies, not the mRNA, where now we know the mRNA and the transfections will do that too, of course.

03:10:31.758 --> 03:10:33.960
Extremely telling.

03:10:35.080 --> 03:10:35.661
this video.

03:10:36.061 --> 03:10:47.751
So, so look, but, but we should scroll down to the, her conclusion of this, which says, okay, and she should go and, you know, she put this together and got it out quickly.

03:10:47.771 --> 03:10:59.722
It says the MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the yellow card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans, period, full stop.

03:11:00.649 --> 03:11:21.136
Preparation should now be made to scale up humanitarian efforts to assist those harmed by the COVID-19 vaccines and to anticipate and ameliorate... Remember, at the same time, Jill Malone is writing a Facebook post that says that these vaccines, the technology of her husband, have saved the world.

03:11:23.776 --> 03:11:25.397
They're working as expected.

03:11:27.009 --> 03:11:34.114
And his unappreciated contribution to saving the world is going unnoticed, and I'm mad about it, says Jill.

03:11:42.855 --> 03:11:45.957
He specializes in long-haul COVID, so when you've had the original thing.

03:11:46.277 --> 03:11:53.361
Well, now he's getting patients who are coming to him with, I never had COVID, but I had the vaccine.

03:11:54.102 --> 03:12:02.166
And those patients come to him, and in every single case, he looks at the blood work and he says, your blood work is abnormal.

03:12:02.246 --> 03:12:05.168
Your blood work looks like a long-haul COVID.

03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:07.952
it kind of, it's different, right?

03:12:07.992 --> 03:12:10.938
Because the vaccine, you get it, it goes all over you.

03:12:10.998 --> 03:12:12.280
Your blood work is abnormal.

03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:15.305
Your blood work looks like a long haul COVID.

03:12:16.431 --> 03:12:18.112
it kind of, it's different, right?

03:12:18.152 --> 03:12:25.337
Because the vaccine, you get it, it goes all over your, through your body, like, you know, in 15 minutes, it's like everywhere.

03:12:25.757 --> 03:12:29.159
Whereas you get it naturally, it has a different pathway.

03:12:29.520 --> 03:12:31.901
And so the blood work looks different.

03:12:32.081 --> 03:12:38.686
But the point is that it shows up on his biomarkers as, you've got long haul vaccine.

03:12:39.966 --> 03:12:52.715
Well, I think it is becoming clear to clinicians that long-haul COVID and post-vaccine syndrome are closely related because the spike protein is shared between all of these.

03:12:53.075 --> 03:12:57.698
I would call that a valid working hypothesis.

03:12:57.718 --> 03:13:05.343
There's the valid working hypothesis that long COVID is the spike, vaccine injury is the spike, and COVID is the spike.

03:13:05.744 --> 03:13:06.264
You see it?

03:13:06.784 --> 03:13:07.505
Do you see it?

03:13:07.945 --> 03:13:09.046
This is the illusion.

03:13:09.966 --> 03:13:16.250
This is the illusion that lots and lots and lots and lots of people that you follow have been pushing.

03:13:17.811 --> 03:13:18.792
That it's the spike.

03:13:18.852 --> 03:13:20.673
The spike is a gain-of-function protein.

03:13:20.713 --> 03:13:22.374
The spike is cytotoxic.

03:13:22.774 --> 03:13:26.117
The spike is an amyloid-generating protein.

03:13:26.157 --> 03:13:28.558
A spike is a pre-antigenic protein.

03:13:29.759 --> 03:13:32.100
And the bioweapon is the spike.

03:13:32.441 --> 03:13:33.621
The spike is in COVID.

03:13:33.881 --> 03:13:35.042
The spike is in the shot.

03:13:35.442 --> 03:13:36.883
The spike, the spike, the spike.

03:13:36.903 --> 03:13:37.604
Do you see it now?

03:13:39.232 --> 03:13:43.019
And these guys are right on point, right on narrative, right?

03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:44.542
It's not the RNA.

03:13:45.263 --> 03:13:46.586
It's not the adenovirus.

03:13:46.646 --> 03:13:48.028
It's not the gene therapy.

03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:49.191
It's the spike.

03:13:53.251 --> 03:13:53.971
association.

03:13:54.171 --> 03:13:54.331
Right.

03:13:54.431 --> 03:13:56.372
And nobody, nobody is even looking at this.

03:13:56.552 --> 03:13:57.913
I mean, that's the sad thing.

03:13:57.933 --> 03:13:59.753
So that's, that's as a professional.

03:14:00.013 --> 03:14:00.333
Okay.

03:14:00.393 --> 03:14:05.055
So we're looking at all this as a professional professional, nobody has looked at this for me.

03:14:05.615 --> 03:14:09.617
The thing that's alarming is that there's no alarm, right?

03:14:09.637 --> 03:14:11.497
Oh yes.

03:14:11.997 --> 03:14:12.478
Exactly.

03:14:12.698 --> 03:14:14.278
Like why aren't alarm bells going off?

03:14:14.298 --> 03:14:14.278
5,000.

03:14:14.318 --> 03:14:14.938
That's the sad thing.

03:14:14.978 --> 03:14:17.279
Have you ever heard Robert Malone laugh?

03:14:23.582 --> 03:14:32.865
Okay, so we're looking at all this Professional nobody has looked at this for for me the thing that's alarming is That there's no alarm

03:14:33.430 --> 03:14:33.650
Right.

03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:34.371
Oh, yes.

03:14:36.012 --> 03:14:36.492
Exactly.

03:14:36.912 --> 03:14:38.654
Why aren't alarm bells going off?

03:14:38.674 --> 03:14:41.075
5,000 excess deaths.

03:14:41.575 --> 03:14:42.296
That's my point.

03:14:42.316 --> 03:14:49.761
Why is nobody saying, why is nobody in academia, why is no dean of a med school saying something?

03:14:50.161 --> 03:14:51.362
They're all silent.

03:14:51.422 --> 03:14:52.603
Look, they don't even know.

03:14:52.963 --> 03:14:57.106
The reason is they don't even look at the VAERS system.

03:14:57.446 --> 03:15:03.250
They don't even know is a really nice excuse and out to give everyone who didn't hold their arms

03:15:03.370 --> 03:15:11.415
They didn't know is a great excuse to give everybody who just did what they were told and didn't hold their arms straight.

03:15:12.816 --> 03:15:16.018
I Know a guy he's he's vaccinated like a million people.

03:15:16.478 --> 03:15:21.501
Okay, and I went to Robert I Please let me let me finish.

03:15:21.742 --> 03:15:25.164
Okay And because I know him and you don't all right.

03:15:25.184 --> 03:15:25.904
All right, we're good.

03:15:25.944 --> 03:15:29.487
His organization has vaccinated a million people there we go.

03:15:29.547 --> 03:15:29.907
He is

03:15:32.532 --> 03:15:33.153
Well, all right.

03:15:33.653 --> 03:15:35.614
I'm up for the pursuit.

03:15:35.814 --> 03:15:37.075
It's like, I can't even.

03:15:37.195 --> 03:15:37.696
No, it's OK.

03:15:37.716 --> 03:15:39.077
He's like the traffic cop here.

03:15:40.037 --> 03:15:50.485
But I asked him, I said, so, and he says, hey, I'm on the CDC calls every week because I'm one of their big vaccinators.

03:15:50.585 --> 03:15:54.227
Please make sure that you understand that the spike protein can be toxic.

03:15:55.048 --> 03:15:56.769
It can be engineered to be a prion.

03:15:58.871 --> 03:16:01.873
And it doesn't change the fact that people

03:16:02.802 --> 03:16:08.845
that we know people that we were interacting with at that time said that billions of people were going to die.

03:16:08.865 --> 03:16:14.147
Those people also didn't talk at all about transfection before it came out.

03:16:15.007 --> 03:16:19.229
Didn't talk about the transfection as a bioweapon in 2021 at all.

03:16:20.690 --> 03:16:22.691
They talked about the virus as a bioweapon.

03:16:22.731 --> 03:16:23.551
Go back and check.

03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:36.109
Go back and check and see if any of those people that you idolize or think are heroes were saying that the transfection was dangerous when these guys were saying that it was the spike.

03:16:37.130 --> 03:16:38.891
Or were they saying that it was the spike?

03:16:39.692 --> 03:16:41.693
Were they saying it was a gain-of-function virus?

03:16:42.174 --> 03:16:52.442
The bioweapon did not become the shot until really 2023 for most of the clowns that get re-referenced in our chat.

03:16:54.005 --> 03:16:54.766
I'll repeat that.

03:16:55.927 --> 03:17:03.373
The transfection did not become a bioweapon for most of the clowns that get referenced in my chat until 2023.

03:17:03.433 --> 03:17:07.717
The record is out there.

03:17:07.997 --> 03:17:09.158
The videos are out there.

03:17:09.598 --> 03:17:10.960
Go look up your heroes.

03:17:13.242 --> 03:17:20.368
Go look up the people that you think were doing it right and see when they spoke out against the transfection as a bioweapon.

03:17:21.368 --> 03:17:22.488
as a dumb idea.

03:17:23.308 --> 03:17:32.611
Go see which one of those wrote a review in 2021 versus sat on their hands and complained about a gain-of-function virus leaking from a laboratory.

03:17:34.751 --> 03:17:35.952
Sat on your hands.

03:17:43.033 --> 03:17:45.154
I think I see this as plain as day.

03:17:45.234 --> 03:17:46.414
I see the bad guys.

03:17:46.594 --> 03:17:47.694
I see what they did.

03:17:47.794 --> 03:17:49.935
I see what they said and how they said it.

03:17:50.839 --> 03:17:52.921
and they all had to have been coached.

03:17:53.921 --> 03:18:04.069
They all had to know that they had to stay on a narrative in order to be successful, in order to maintain their comfort, in order to maintain their subscriber base.

03:18:04.669 --> 03:18:06.290
Otherwise, we will erase you.

03:18:09.012 --> 03:18:15.537
That's why I still have less than 3,000 subscribers on Twitch, less than 4,000 subscribers on YouTube,

03:18:16.971 --> 03:18:18.893
because I'm not artificially elevated.

03:18:18.953 --> 03:18:24.838
I'm not part of this theater that we have all been subjected to, including myself.

03:18:24.918 --> 03:18:26.899
I believed this when this video came out.

03:18:27.460 --> 03:18:29.301
I thought Robert Malone was a hero.

03:18:30.602 --> 03:18:35.707
So I said to him, so do you know how many people have died, have been killed by this virus?

03:18:36.367 --> 03:18:38.589
And he said, it's really, really small.

03:18:38.609 --> 03:18:38.829
It's like 100.

03:18:40.256 --> 03:18:40.937
You mean the vaccine.

03:18:41.838 --> 03:18:42.078
Sorry.

03:18:43.699 --> 03:18:44.960
I don't think you can find that.

03:18:45.301 --> 03:18:46.762
I'm sorry, but you can't find it.

03:18:47.223 --> 03:18:49.385
Go ahead and find that video and send me the link.

03:18:49.445 --> 03:18:55.270
I'll gladly watch it from end to end and give credit where credit's deserved, but you can't find that video.

03:18:55.510 --> 03:18:57.632
By the way, this is really, really small.

03:18:57.652 --> 03:18:58.233
It's about a hundred.

03:18:59.201 --> 03:19:01.923
I said, really, they're telling you it's about 100?

03:19:02.484 --> 03:19:07.607
Because the v-safe system, it is not transparent at all to the public.

03:19:07.647 --> 03:19:09.449
You cannot search it at all.

03:19:09.769 --> 03:19:13.532
It is like this secret black box that nobody can see inside.

03:19:13.792 --> 03:19:20.057
Nor can my colleagues at the FDA that I just spoke with today, who are data analysis specialists.

03:19:20.317 --> 03:19:22.158
What are they hiding, Brett?

03:19:22.558 --> 03:19:23.559
What are they hiding?

03:19:24.300 --> 03:19:25.981
That we shouldn't be allowed to see that.

03:19:26.121 --> 03:19:28.303
We shouldn't be allowed to see, and in fact, I would argue

03:19:29.665 --> 03:19:31.886
And why isn't even anyone asking?

03:19:32.246 --> 03:19:33.546
Why can't we see it?

03:19:33.746 --> 03:19:35.547
So this is the problem.

03:19:36.007 --> 03:19:38.588
Heather and I did a segment on our last live stream.

03:19:38.648 --> 03:19:40.408
And our point was, actually, you know what?

03:19:40.448 --> 03:19:47.271
People do incredible science under conditions that are way harder than where you have a database or you have a laboratory, right?

03:19:47.311 --> 03:19:49.491
We do science in the Amazon, right?

03:19:49.891 --> 03:19:50.832
You can infer pattern

03:19:52.012 --> 03:19:54.515
In such a circumstance, you can test hypotheses.

03:19:54.555 --> 03:19:55.777
We do it all the time.

03:19:55.837 --> 03:20:04.307
And yet, we are being held to this standard at the same time that the very data you would want to access is stored in a system that is impenetrable, right?

03:20:04.367 --> 03:20:05.808
So yes, that's anomalous.

03:20:05.829 --> 03:20:07.871
So can I kind of peck at that just a little bit?

03:20:08.111 --> 03:20:10.514
Because I'm going to trot out the bioethics argument.

03:20:10.654 --> 03:20:10.814
Sure.

03:20:12.396 --> 03:20:15.578
So they're currently experimental vaccines.

03:20:15.618 --> 03:20:20.201
There's three fundamental bedrock principles in Western bioethics.

03:20:21.642 --> 03:20:24.104
One is full and complete disclosure of risks.

03:20:25.625 --> 03:20:31.688
One is ensuring full comprehension of risks by people that are going to be taking the experimental product.

03:20:32.529 --> 03:20:35.351
And one is willing consent.

03:20:35.811 --> 03:20:37.112
You've got to have those three.

03:20:37.252 --> 03:20:38.273
And the thing about

03:20:40.399 --> 03:20:51.043
this database not being available for outside query by responsible parties, which is what, by the way, any academic publication would require.

03:20:51.063 --> 03:21:05.789
If you were going to say in JAMA, you were going to say, we conclude based on our analysis of this v-safe database that the vaccine is safe and that there are no deaths.

03:21:06.289 --> 03:21:08.010
If you were going to say that,

03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:17.099
You would have to say that we will provide these data for outside analysis by third parties upon request.

03:21:18.420 --> 03:21:21.223
If you publish, that's what you have to put in there.

03:21:21.243 --> 03:21:23.145
It's no ifs, ands, or buts.

03:21:23.585 --> 03:21:29.351
So what we functionally have is folks within the government saying, this is the truth.

03:21:31.012 --> 03:21:31.373
Trust us.

03:21:32.981 --> 03:21:33.401
Well put.

03:21:34.682 --> 03:21:36.402
But I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

03:21:36.923 --> 03:21:44.146
We are not going to allow this information to be independently analyzed by responsible, qualified third parties.

03:21:44.786 --> 03:21:46.227
That's not right.

03:21:46.387 --> 03:21:46.547
Right.

03:21:46.827 --> 03:21:56.331
Well, at the same time, and somebody's going to have to do the work to figure out how this actually functions, but then there's the social media side.

03:21:56.491 --> 03:22:17.582
where the natural processes that would allow a massive error like this to emerge naturally is being so shaped by an environment in which one is presumed morally bad if you express skepticism over things that one should obviously be skeptical about, if one tries to gather with other people who are suffering the same symptoms.

03:22:18.203 --> 03:22:21.284
There's a whole bunch of thou shalt not discuss this, that, or the other.

03:22:21.304 --> 03:22:22.345
It doesn't matter who you are.

03:22:22.365 --> 03:22:23.346
Which is unprecedented.

03:22:23.506 --> 03:22:24.546
It's unprecedented.

03:22:24.926 --> 03:22:26.007
But there's an explanation for it.

03:22:26.167 --> 03:22:26.768
Okay.

03:22:27.168 --> 03:22:27.709
No, no, no.

03:22:27.789 --> 03:22:38.759
Because look, Mark Zuckerberg sent an email and this is in the public domain now where he said, he sent it to Tony Fauci and he said, we will censor anything that goes against the narrative.

03:22:38.819 --> 03:22:40.760
I mean, essentially that's what he said.

03:22:41.081 --> 03:22:41.321
Okay.

03:22:41.561 --> 03:22:47.346
So when you have a Facebook group of 70,000 people who are vaccine sufferers, that

03:22:48.047 --> 03:22:49.110
group disappears overnight.

03:22:49.591 --> 03:22:56.288
We have another Facebook group of COVID vaccine side effects, 120,000 people.

03:22:58.308 --> 03:22:59.549
disappears overnight.

03:22:59.889 --> 03:23:10.157
So how could you have, you know, like 200,000 people who are in these COVID vaccine side effect groups, like they would have nothing to talk about.

03:23:10.758 --> 03:23:14.000
Because it's a perfectly safe vaccine.

03:23:14.361 --> 03:23:18.704
Like what we're, we don't even know what they were talking about because it's taken from.

03:23:18.764 --> 03:23:19.505
No, no, we're not.

03:23:19.605 --> 03:23:20.105
This is us.

03:23:20.386 --> 03:23:20.926
Good.

03:23:21.426 --> 03:23:21.647
We,

03:23:22.948 --> 03:23:26.291
So he's got multiple screens up there to see what they're doing.

03:23:26.331 --> 03:23:27.833
It's a pretty fancy setup he's got.

03:23:28.153 --> 03:23:29.415
This is unprecedented.

03:23:29.655 --> 03:23:36.943
We have no cognitive immune system to prepare us for this kind of shaping of what we can see.

03:23:37.143 --> 03:23:39.085
Cognitive immune system?

03:23:39.165 --> 03:23:41.768
Don't try to confuse anybody anymore there, Brett.

03:23:42.569 --> 03:23:45.371
Might as well say that we have a cognitive immune system as well.

03:23:45.491 --> 03:23:47.132
What a bunch of horse.

03:23:47.513 --> 03:23:48.373
Oh my gosh.

03:23:48.834 --> 03:23:52.096
Or what we can even are allowed to discuss.

03:23:52.336 --> 03:23:54.157
This is not normal.

03:23:54.197 --> 03:24:04.965
And so the point is we use our normal heuristics to figure out how dangerous something is and how, how dangerous it is would ordinarily be something you could detect by how frequently you encounter discussions of things that have gone wrong.

03:24:05.305 --> 03:24:10.289
But if those discussions aren't allowed to be had, then the point is you artificially have the sense that this is very safe.

03:24:10.569 --> 03:24:12.270
And so, you know, again, it's an anomaly.

03:24:12.410 --> 03:24:24.379
Now, I don't think – maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm being naive – but I don't think that, you know, Twitter and Facebook were in the meeting in which something was decided that it was going to be fine for thousands of people to die immediately.

03:24:24.399 --> 03:24:30.944
No, they're just buying into – because it's suppressed, they're buying into the whole thing that – Robert, please, let me – can I finish?

03:24:33.246 --> 03:24:36.855
I have never broken this out before, but we are going to be very careful, all right?

03:24:37.317 --> 03:24:39.382
We are going to be nice to each other, and that thing is going to...

03:24:41.613 --> 03:24:43.514
You have just gotten a foul.

03:24:43.754 --> 03:24:44.735
Oh, sorry.

03:24:44.835 --> 03:24:45.695
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:24:46.556 --> 03:24:47.937
They're not allowed to be had.

03:24:47.997 --> 03:24:50.878
The point is, you artificially have the sense that this is very safe.

03:24:51.159 --> 03:24:52.860
And so, you know, again, it's an anomaly.

03:24:53.000 --> 03:25:04.606
Now, I don't think, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm being naive, but I don't think that, you know, Twitter and Facebook were in the meeting in which something was decided that it was going to be fine for thousands of people.

03:25:04.626 --> 03:25:08.629
No, they're just buying into, because it's suppressed, they're buying into the whole thing.

03:25:09.149 --> 03:25:10.730
Robert, please, let me, let me.

03:25:11.010 --> 03:25:15.938
All right, I may have to use... I have never broken this card before.

03:25:15.958 --> 03:25:17.761
Dang, that's awesome, the yellow card.

03:25:17.922 --> 03:25:19.945
We're gonna be nice to each other and that thing is gonna...

03:25:22.199 --> 03:25:24.101
You have just gotten a foul.

03:25:24.401 --> 03:25:25.061
Oh, sorry.

03:25:25.162 --> 03:25:26.182
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:25:26.222 --> 03:25:27.323
You have to give it to me.

03:25:28.024 --> 03:25:28.945
I thought I was supposed to take it.

03:25:29.085 --> 03:25:30.066
I was warning you.

03:25:30.986 --> 03:25:31.707
Oh, that's a warning.

03:25:31.767 --> 03:25:33.509
I thought it was who's got the ball, who can speak.

03:25:33.589 --> 03:25:34.329
No, no.

03:25:34.349 --> 03:25:35.710
I thought it was like the judge.

03:25:35.891 --> 03:25:37.112
No, but you got the floor.

03:25:37.252 --> 03:25:37.392
Yeah.

03:25:37.552 --> 03:25:37.792
OK.

03:25:38.173 --> 03:25:38.613
So thank you.

03:25:39.954 --> 03:25:42.256
So I did a test.

03:25:42.897 --> 03:25:46.400
I went to a vaccine line in my local pharmacy.

03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:53.806
And I said, hi, I'm thinking about getting the vaccine, but I've heard some things that some people have died.

03:25:53.846 --> 03:25:57.830
Does anybody know how many people have died from the vaccine?

03:25:57.850 --> 03:26:00.493
Because I'm not sure what to believe.

03:26:01.293 --> 03:26:03.075
So one woman says, oh, I believe in God.

03:26:03.695 --> 03:26:06.478
And God says that I should go and take the vaccine.

03:26:07.079 --> 03:26:09.221
And then another guy says, are you an anti-vaxxer?

03:26:10.921 --> 03:26:15.323
And it's like you cannot even raise even a question.

03:26:15.743 --> 03:26:26.826
In fact, I asked people on Nextdoor, I put up a poll to say, right, to say how many people, you know, oh, there's this posting on trial site news, how many people believed it?

03:26:27.306 --> 03:26:30.527
And, you know, 10 people responded, five said, yep, totally believe it.

03:26:30.687 --> 03:26:32.788
And the other five said, totally bullshit.

03:26:33.348 --> 03:26:58.210
Right, and it was it wasn't anywhere in between I gave them like five levels and it was either you thought it was total bullshit or you totally believed it's is a sensor is The the pole was censored by by next door like hours Later and and so you can't even ask people the question and when I asked the pharmacist I asked the pharmacist so do you know how many people have been killed by this virus and she says

03:26:59.051 --> 03:26:59.431
Vaccine.

03:26:59.872 --> 03:27:00.212
No, sorry.

03:27:00.432 --> 03:27:01.273
Yep, buy the vaccine.

03:27:01.293 --> 03:27:01.593
Thank you.

03:27:02.394 --> 03:27:05.756
She says, actually, I don't.

03:27:06.296 --> 03:27:24.730
And it's almost like she never even thought that it's an issue because they're so programmed to think that the vaccine is safe and effective that your mind shuts off to the possibility that, you know, and if you have an abortion,

03:27:25.330 --> 03:27:29.213
you can't even think that it could have been caused by the safe and effective vaccine.

03:27:29.233 --> 03:27:29.853
Spontaneous.

03:27:30.334 --> 03:27:32.355
It's like, it's, it's, you know, so, yeah.

03:27:32.495 --> 03:27:44.284
So this is again, in my area of expertise, there is something about the, you know, your poll, small as it was, reveals that there's something very unnatural about people's conclusions about how likely this is to be safe.

03:27:44.304 --> 03:27:45.805
You would expect a range, right?

03:27:45.825 --> 03:27:47.286
You would expect some outliers who think it's

03:27:47.666 --> 03:27:52.471
incredibly dangerous, and you would expect some people to think it's perfectly safe, and you would expect a whole lot in between.

03:27:52.772 --> 03:27:55.154
But our environment basically has... Yeah, kind of like a bell curve.

03:27:55.214 --> 03:27:56.175
It's the total opposite.

03:27:56.435 --> 03:27:56.596
Right.

03:27:56.636 --> 03:28:02.181
We're divided into teams, and the teams are basically repelled by each other out of disgust.

03:28:03.002 --> 03:28:03.982
Oh yeah, no, absolutely.

03:28:04.022 --> 03:28:12.525
So the sense, and this is something that we have faced on this channel from the beginning, is to even begin to try to unpack the nuance around this.

03:28:12.565 --> 03:28:18.766
What is going on, right, is to step into the line of fire of this disgust mechanism.

03:28:18.786 --> 03:28:21.327
You're morally bad for even raising this question.

03:28:21.727 --> 03:28:33.294
Now, how can it be, how is it possible that scientists, raising the question of how safe is this novel technology actually, how could that possibly be, you know, a morally deficient position, right?

03:28:33.334 --> 03:28:34.054
It's the right thing to do.

03:28:34.074 --> 03:28:40.618
It's, yeah, I mean, you should be able to question, you know, science is about, you know, questioning and science should be free.

03:28:41.178 --> 03:28:49.483
to question what the narrative is and, oh, there's a phase three, because even phase three studies are never perfect, right?

03:28:49.603 --> 03:29:00.449
And so, but the thing is that when I posted this article to Trial Site News, I had a scientific advisory board of 14 academics, very high power academics, all of them resigned.

03:29:00.629 --> 03:29:01.530
Good to bring that up.

03:29:01.590 --> 03:29:03.711
I'm sorry, I had to step out to go to the bathroom really quick.

03:29:05.212 --> 03:29:06.853
There was a story posted

03:29:08.354 --> 03:29:12.235
on Twitter about the fact that the Swiss government had changed their mind about vaccination.

03:29:12.295 --> 03:29:15.956
It was promoted by Kirsch and promoted by Robert Malone.

03:29:16.757 --> 03:29:27.060
If you follow a guy on Twitter by the name of Thomas Binder, B-I-N-D-E-R, that is a cardiologist from Switzerland that I've known since the beginning.

03:29:27.900 --> 03:29:30.661
He's part of the Doctors for COVID Ethics group in Europe.

03:29:31.701 --> 03:29:33.242
And you read him on Twitter,

03:29:34.127 --> 03:29:41.710
you will find a very different story about what has changed with regard to the recommendations of vaccination and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and what hasn't changed.

03:29:42.730 --> 03:29:49.332
And Robert and Steve were both very incorrect about what has changed and what hasn't changed.

03:29:50.333 --> 03:29:53.854
And they even told a story about liability, which hasn't changed at all.

03:29:54.935 --> 03:29:56.176
according to Thomas Binder.

03:29:56.236 --> 03:30:03.881
So a real Swiss doctor says that these two guys were passing misinformation about what has recently changed in Switzerland.

03:30:03.921 --> 03:30:04.942
That's just recent.

03:30:05.402 --> 03:30:06.803
So it's still happening.

03:30:08.104 --> 03:30:09.825
This is still ongoing.

03:30:09.905 --> 03:30:16.990
These two guys, these three guys are still part of an ongoing narrative control paradigm.

03:30:18.336 --> 03:30:26.718
that's trapping us and thereby our children and our grandchildren in a public health mythology forever.

03:30:29.578 --> 03:30:36.119
Like three days later saying that what I was doing, it was irresponsible, that it will cause vaccine hesitancy.

03:30:36.419 --> 03:30:37.460
I should take it down.

03:30:37.700 --> 03:30:42.541
They don't want to associate it with me anymore and don't email me ever again.

03:30:42.681 --> 03:30:44.541
Was there any substantive critique?

03:30:44.821 --> 03:30:45.962
No, and I asked for it.

03:30:46.022 --> 03:30:51.886
I said, hey, I'm sorry you're resigning, but could you please point out an error, and I will correct it.

03:30:52.487 --> 03:30:57.850
And in my article, I say, hey, if you've got an error, post it, and I will go and correct it.

03:30:58.411 --> 03:31:00.172
And they gave me nothing.

03:31:00.212 --> 03:31:01.913
They just said, I don't want to talk to you again.

03:31:02.153 --> 03:31:06.336
They gave me nothing of factual that was wrong with my article.

03:31:06.497 --> 03:31:10.539
So this is another symptom that is another data point on that line.

03:31:12.480 --> 03:31:19.143
And this is the thing that I find most troubling, frankly.

03:31:19.223 --> 03:31:20.543
Is he going to give him a yellow card?

03:31:20.623 --> 03:31:23.884
And much of it is coming from the academic community.

03:31:24.505 --> 03:31:26.665
I call it, you know, self-appointed academic policeman.

03:31:28.026 --> 03:31:28.926
Oh, yeah.

03:31:28.966 --> 03:31:30.447
And, you know, I go on Clubhouse.

03:31:31.246 --> 03:31:35.289
And I show up in a room, and I say, well, I'd like to talk.

03:31:35.309 --> 03:31:37.090
Well, the moderator's like shut me down.

03:31:37.450 --> 03:31:39.832
And then I challenge them.

03:31:39.852 --> 03:31:42.634
I say, hey, let's go to a private room, or let's go off on Twitter.

03:31:43.255 --> 03:31:45.096
I claim that you're wrong about ivermectin.

03:31:45.456 --> 03:31:45.936
Let's go off.

03:31:46.177 --> 03:31:49.239
And so the moderator says, well, I can't go, but I'll appoint someone.

03:31:49.299 --> 03:31:53.041
So I go off with this guy on Twitter.

03:31:53.522 --> 03:31:56.364
And he DMs me, and he says, show me your evidence.

03:31:56.926 --> 03:32:03.392
And I said, I gave him the web link to Tess's meta-analysis.

03:32:03.752 --> 03:32:05.614
So he says, oh, that's a web link.

03:32:05.814 --> 03:32:06.535
I want to study.

03:32:07.255 --> 03:32:10.438
And so, OK, well, so here's the link that's in the study.

03:32:10.619 --> 03:32:11.459
So I give it to him.

03:32:12.080 --> 03:32:15.883
And he says, OK, well, I have to study this.

03:32:16.764 --> 03:32:18.226
And I say, OK.

03:32:18.246 --> 03:32:26.777
And it's clear he's never looked at a systematic review before, because he didn't ask for the protocol that they use.

03:32:26.837 --> 03:32:28.259
And normally, you would go and do that.

03:32:28.739 --> 03:32:29.760
And so I said, OK.

03:32:32.243 --> 03:32:45.332
Uh, he comes back and he says, well, how would those studies, uh, uh, you know, how did they, I said, well, I guess you've never done this before because you would be asking for the entire protocol, which you didn't ask for, which was on the webpage that I gave you in the beginning.

03:32:45.552 --> 03:32:50.656
So the point is that these people who are these self-appointed police don't even know what they're policing.

03:32:50.976 --> 03:32:58.539
And then when I wrote him and I told him, hey, you know, Tess's thing is coming out as peer-reviewed.

03:32:58.959 --> 03:33:02.721
And you can't get any better than a peer-reviewed meta-analysis that's the highest.

03:33:03.101 --> 03:33:05.262
And so I said, you have to go and accept that.

03:33:05.402 --> 03:33:08.403
And the precautionary principle says you should use it on your patients now.

03:33:09.023 --> 03:33:26.250
silence right so so again the thing that the thing you should detect at the end of this is not all of the text in the middle it's that at the end of the day what's being said doesn't add up right if you believed the data was all that ambiguous you'd still give a safe drug because you don't have an alternative absolutely we're literally sending people

03:33:26.730 --> 03:33:32.593
home without treatment, where they go and sicken the people that they live with, when there's a perfectly safe drug.

03:33:32.673 --> 03:33:33.313
It's worse than that.

03:33:33.853 --> 03:33:34.254
Go for it.

03:33:34.334 --> 03:33:37.935
We're sending them home and we're saying, don't come back until your lips are blue.

03:33:38.076 --> 03:33:40.317
Until you're sick.

03:33:40.437 --> 03:33:40.797
Right.

03:33:40.837 --> 03:33:42.037
No, it's not sick.

03:33:42.818 --> 03:33:43.098
Okay?

03:33:43.578 --> 03:33:44.479
It's hypoxic.

03:33:45.439 --> 03:33:58.086
it's that your blood oxygen is so, no, sick is, you know, I've got a headache and I've got a fever and I'm sorry to nip it, but this is turning the dial up on sick.

03:33:58.906 --> 03:34:02.128
This is pretty severe sick.

03:34:02.248 --> 03:34:07.670
You need an intervention because you have to get oxygen now.

03:34:09.091 --> 03:34:12.433
Lips are blue equals oxygen saturation of high 80s.

03:34:14.855 --> 03:34:15.295
Way sick.

03:34:15.576 --> 03:34:15.736
Yep.

03:34:16.197 --> 03:34:19.544
So and and and our policy is

03:34:21.374 --> 03:34:29.659
you know, despite all the data that you've and others have championed, you have personally funded, which I acknowledge that commitment.

03:34:29.679 --> 03:34:35.263
I think that's super important for the audience to understand, is for you, this isn't just talk, you walked the walk.

03:34:35.763 --> 03:34:43.828
You took your wallet and you said fluvoxamine study at Wash U, one of the top universities in the United States, you funded it.

03:34:43.949 --> 03:34:48.972
So when you talk about the fluvoxamine study, it's not just that you pulled something out of the air, you enabled it.

03:34:49.571 --> 03:34:50.911
you provided leadership.

03:34:50.931 --> 03:35:14.758
Okay, so all those data are out there, and yet, the current public policy is, if you come into my hospital, and you've got all the signs and symptoms, and you got a PCR diagnosis, and you feel sick enough with COVID, that you feel like you gotta go to the ER, and the ER tells you, I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith, we're not gonna take you in,

03:35:15.905 --> 03:35:26.073
because your blood oxygen saturation levels are not at critical levels and you need to go home and just incubate.

03:35:26.153 --> 03:35:32.318
Without giving you a drug that would almost certainly make you better and without giving it to your family so you don't sicken them.

03:35:32.358 --> 03:35:37.462
We are actually behaving in a way that propagates the pandemic.

03:35:40.104 --> 03:35:45.308
What I understand here is that they're implying that, okay, your blood oxygen level is very low

03:35:46.394 --> 03:35:48.836
We're not gonna test you for a secondary pneumonia.

03:35:48.856 --> 03:35:51.037
We're not even gonna worry about whether you have pneumonia.

03:35:51.077 --> 03:35:58.603
We're just gonna send you home until you have a lower blood oxygen level and then bring you in and ventilate you.

03:35:59.743 --> 03:36:03.806
So they're not saying that that's the mistake.

03:36:03.826 --> 03:36:06.929
They're not saying that and not using antibiotics is the mistake.

03:36:06.949 --> 03:36:12.012
They're saying that we know that ivermectin would be something we could send home to these people.

03:36:12.572 --> 03:36:15.815
Brett says we could give ivermectin to their families.

03:36:19.918 --> 03:36:25.761
Why do we suddenly have to turn to another drug instead of just treating the people who come to the hospital sick?

03:36:27.762 --> 03:36:30.984
Why do we have to put a new drug into the story?

03:36:32.065 --> 03:36:33.446
Because there's a new virus.

03:36:34.066 --> 03:36:35.627
There's a new way to die.

03:36:36.447 --> 03:36:42.651
And none of these people on this screen are aware of the fact that there isn't a new way to die from a respiratory disease.

03:36:43.151 --> 03:36:48.014
There's not a new way to die from a secondary pneumonia.

03:36:50.233 --> 03:36:51.534
That's an old way to die.

03:36:52.674 --> 03:37:01.659
Getting sent home with a low oxygen level in your blood because of secondary pneumonia is a great way, an old way to die.

03:37:01.679 --> 03:37:06.342
Do you hear me?

03:37:06.362 --> 03:37:09.003
This is not a new way of dying.

03:37:09.043 --> 03:37:15.167
This is an old way of dying that they are describing as a new way of dying, insisting that it's a new way of dying.

03:37:16.530 --> 03:37:17.571
This is theater.

03:37:17.911 --> 03:37:25.519
This is pandemic story being laid down in front of you by people who are claiming to be whistleblowers.

03:37:28.554 --> 03:37:33.159
I think we can all agree that the behavior is bizarre.

03:37:33.439 --> 03:37:33.619
Yes.

03:37:33.719 --> 03:37:41.807
Especially when we know, like George Farid and Brian Tyson, they have a little practice.

03:37:41.847 --> 03:37:44.489
They've treated 6,500 patients, average age is 60 years old.

03:37:47.659 --> 03:37:49.500
They have like zero hospitalizations.

03:37:49.540 --> 03:37:53.322
They say, we only get a hospitalization when someone comes up to us really late.

03:37:53.742 --> 03:37:57.764
But anyone who gets to us early, they don't go to the hospital at all.

03:37:58.324 --> 03:38:00.466
We turn them around with our treatment protocol.

03:38:00.506 --> 03:38:06.289
So the most important thing is to treat people early with these drugs.

03:38:06.629 --> 03:38:08.250
And it almost doesn't matter.

03:38:08.270 --> 03:38:09.050
Their treatment protocol

03:38:09.991 --> 03:38:14.374
Oh, it has hydroxychloroquine, it has ivermectin, it has fluvoxamine in it.

03:38:14.915 --> 03:38:19.718
And the point is that they use the drugs that are shown to have an effect.

03:38:20.018 --> 03:38:23.841
And they use them in combination so that they don't really know which ones are working.

03:38:23.881 --> 03:38:34.269
And so when they use the old-fashioned treatment for pneumonia and they use the old-fashioned treatment for cytokine storm, which is steroids, well, then they get results.

03:38:35.570 --> 03:38:38.733
But if you send people home and do nothing, they can die.

03:38:39.730 --> 03:38:41.951
If you don't give them antibiotics, they can die.

03:38:43.831 --> 03:38:48.893
But again, here we are trying to obfuscate what it is that's really saving these people.

03:38:48.913 --> 03:38:51.373
What's really saving these people is being treated at all.

03:38:55.474 --> 03:39:01.096
And not being treated in the way that they are being suggested to be treated by the protocols with remdesivir, etc.

03:39:02.415 --> 03:39:09.621
but we don't know because remdesivir is given oftentimes in parallel with these other drugs that they say work great.

03:39:09.641 --> 03:39:15.686
100% effective at prophylactics says Brett Weinstein in the first 10 minutes of this podcast.

03:39:22.552 --> 03:39:27.334
of drugs, you know, David Seftel just used fluvoxamine, he got a 100% track record.

03:39:28.014 --> 03:39:30.215
Other people use ivermectin and fluvoxamine.

03:39:30.735 --> 03:39:33.516
I know a lot of docs who started with ivermectin, they added fluvoxamine.

03:39:33.816 --> 03:39:37.137
They say, oh my gosh, you know, this is even better than what I had before.

03:39:37.497 --> 03:39:40.318
So it's all about this combination of drugs.

03:39:40.898 --> 03:39:48.061
And of course, we don't tell people about George Farid and Brian Tyson.

03:39:48.201 --> 03:39:51.782
They don't even exist because those are anecdotes.

03:39:52.803 --> 03:39:56.626
We ignore the frontline physicians who are having success.

03:39:57.127 --> 03:40:03.352
You're ignoring natural immunity playing a huge role in these perceived successes, Steve.

03:40:04.713 --> 03:40:14.222
Robert Malone and Brett Weinstein are also completely ignoring previous existing T-cell immunity as playing a huge role in these perceived successes.

03:40:16.380 --> 03:40:26.926
I mean, we're gonna go on for hours, it looks like, because this is just a, it's a minefield of ridiculous statements, a minefield of assumptions, a minefield of misdirection.

03:40:26.966 --> 03:40:37.431
It's a minefield of misinformation that these guys have laid down so thoroughly with a censored video that everybody just had to see.

03:40:38.331 --> 03:40:39.552
And then what follows here?

03:40:40.192 --> 03:40:42.594
Joe Rogan appearances by all these clowns.

03:40:43.524 --> 03:40:45.505
Come on, guys, can't you see it now?

03:40:46.046 --> 03:40:55.391
Go and find out, oh, why isn't the NIH saying, hey, this guy has 100% track record.

03:40:55.431 --> 03:40:57.132
He just said something that's super important.

03:40:57.312 --> 03:40:58.233
OK.

03:40:58.413 --> 03:40:58.953
Oh, finally.

03:40:59.714 --> 03:41:02.616
No, you said a lot of things that are super important, but I want to highlight that one.

03:41:03.116 --> 03:41:04.697
You emphasize frontline physicians.

03:41:05.856 --> 03:41:08.318
And this has been my observation.

03:41:08.718 --> 03:41:12.601
I'm dealing with this community intensively since January of 2020.

03:41:12.682 --> 03:41:16.144
They only trust these double-blind randomized control trials that take a year to do.

03:41:16.204 --> 03:41:16.845
It's crazy.

03:41:17.465 --> 03:41:20.688
And typically require 20 million or more to do.

03:41:20.948 --> 03:41:21.989
Well, yeah.

03:41:22.009 --> 03:41:22.289
Okay.

03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:31.858
Um, so for a billion dollars in the case of what can I can I get the little yellow card you want?

03:41:32.198 --> 03:41:33.039
Wow.

03:41:33.259 --> 03:41:37.503
And he just said that Merck was asking for a billion dollars from Barta.

03:41:38.804 --> 03:41:39.545
Did you hear that?

03:41:40.545 --> 03:41:41.046
Did you hear it?

03:41:44.899 --> 03:41:50.866
Or a billion dollars in the case of what Merck is asking for.

03:41:51.207 --> 03:41:52.288
Can I get the little yellow card?

03:41:53.489 --> 03:41:57.294
I ask for the floor.

03:41:57.494 --> 03:42:02.099
I just want to make a point to amplify on the good message that you just gave.

03:42:03.988 --> 03:42:05.451
Um, and it's a good news story.

03:42:05.491 --> 03:42:06.712
We need a little bit of good news here.

03:42:06.733 --> 03:42:09.016
There's a lot of, a lot of kind of creepy stuff.

03:42:09.136 --> 03:42:12.401
We're going to end with great news, but anyway, we could use some good news along the way.

03:42:12.662 --> 03:42:15.667
Um, here in the States and across the world.

03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:23.071
We've had primary care physicians, frontline docs, ICU docs, desperately seeking solutions.

03:42:24.131 --> 03:42:32.253
And they have resorted because they have the right to do so as physicians to prescribe things off label.

03:42:32.613 --> 03:42:39.994
And I can tell you these docs that I deal with all the time are spending enormous amounts of time in the litter.

03:42:40.114 --> 03:42:41.415
I thought he raised horses.

03:42:43.195 --> 03:42:43.995
I thought he had a farm.

03:42:46.052 --> 03:42:47.013
I thought he was retired.

03:42:48.453 --> 03:42:50.834
But he deals with these doctors all the time.

03:42:50.874 --> 03:42:52.615
He talks to these people at the FDA.

03:42:52.835 --> 03:42:54.576
He just picks up the phone and calls them.

03:42:56.858 --> 03:42:59.539
Stops at the water cooler and talks to a few other guys.

03:42:59.859 --> 03:43:01.940
He's either an insider or he's not.

03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:03.741
He's either retired or he's not.

03:43:06.222 --> 03:43:15.007
And if you don't see that he's not retired, if you don't see that he's not active, if you don't see that this man has been bamboozling us from the very beginning,

03:43:19.121 --> 03:43:21.323
You're going to have to wake up and apologize eventually.

03:43:22.984 --> 03:43:27.387
If it's not to me and your friends and family, it's going to be to your kids or to your grandkids.

03:43:27.408 --> 03:43:28.969
You're going to wake up and apologize.

03:43:32.151 --> 03:43:38.516
You might as well wake up and apologize right now because Robert Malone's not going to wake up and apologize.

03:43:40.178 --> 03:43:43.460
He's not going to wake up and apologize for enabling Remdesivir.

03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:48.144
He's not going to wake up and apologize for not having spoken out about Remdesivir on this podcast.

03:43:49.531 --> 03:43:54.072
He's not going to wake up and apologize for suing the Breggans for nothing.

03:43:55.792 --> 03:44:05.274
He's not going to wake up and apologize for misleading us, for misdirecting us, for distracting us.

03:44:06.954 --> 03:44:16.856
He's not going to apologize for not having come on Brett Weinstein's podcast in October of 2020, before anybody had meaningfully been vaccinated.

03:44:19.073 --> 03:44:26.257
He's not going to apologize for this video today and say that I should have come out stronger on Brett's podcast.

03:44:26.277 --> 03:44:35.063
He's not going to say that because at the same time, his wife was writing articles in Facebook and on her blog about her.

03:44:35.143 --> 03:44:41.867
Her husband had not given credit, had not gotten the credit he deserves for saving the world with his ideas.

03:44:47.236 --> 03:44:51.178
Please see the truth so that we can start to move forward.

03:44:51.578 --> 03:44:56.821
We need individual people, one by one, to start to turn away from these people.

03:44:58.401 --> 03:44:59.802
To stop following them.

03:45:00.602 --> 03:45:01.603
To call them out.

03:45:02.883 --> 03:45:04.364
To tweet against them.

03:45:05.144 --> 03:45:06.925
To comment on their videos.

03:45:07.386 --> 03:45:09.527
To cancel your Patreon subscription.

03:45:09.547 --> 03:45:12.488
To cancel your subscription to their sub stack.

03:45:14.980 --> 03:45:20.025
We need to tune these people out because they did not hold their arms straight.

03:45:20.366 --> 03:45:22.027
They didn't keep their arms straight, guys.

03:45:23.849 --> 03:45:26.572
These are people that are encouraging you to put your arms down.

03:45:27.934 --> 03:45:35.582
These are people that are encouraging you to put your arms down, to not take responsibility, to trust them, and they don't deserve your trust.

03:45:37.261 --> 03:45:41.527
That's why we're watching this video because I don't believe these people deserve your trust.

03:45:42.048 --> 03:45:47.797
And it is vital that we start trusting people that deserve our trust or we will not get out of this.

03:45:51.431 --> 03:45:54.812
Bret Weinstein has never had Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:45:54.872 --> 03:45:55.752
on his podcast.

03:45:56.393 --> 03:45:56.973
Data point.

03:45:57.453 --> 03:45:57.733
Sure.

03:45:58.213 --> 03:46:13.138
Reading the preprints, trying to figure out some solution to save their patients' lives in the face of this amazing gap of clarity from our centralized public health service.

03:46:13.878 --> 03:46:18.360
And I just kind of wanted to take a moment and pick at what you just said.

03:46:19.020 --> 03:46:22.282
The innovation, this is amazingly paradoxical.

03:46:23.203 --> 03:46:33.910
What I've seen is all of the innovation in treating this disease is coming from these frontline docs that are tinkering and innovating.

03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:39.414
And what this gets to is the fundamentals of, and I'm going to say it, what makes this country great?

03:46:41.215 --> 03:46:48.622
And it's historically not been large, centrally controlled enterprises.

03:46:49.183 --> 03:46:50.985
It's been individual initiative.

03:46:51.325 --> 03:46:54.948
And one of the good news stories in COVID,

03:46:55.649 --> 03:47:10.505
is that a lot of the success have come from the docs like you're dealing with innovating, tinkering, experimenting, trying things, and they're driven by the need to give their patients some option.

03:47:10.725 --> 03:47:12.587
I just wanted to amplify that.

03:47:12.987 --> 03:47:14.348
Thanks for letting me have a look.

03:47:14.368 --> 03:47:17.129
Let me give the counterpoint to that when you give it to me.

03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.810
OK.

03:47:18.010 --> 03:47:21.912
So the docs on the ground are in a position to see this.

03:47:22.252 --> 03:47:27.095
They are in a good position, at least with respect to ivermectin, because it's so safe, right?

03:47:27.115 --> 03:47:30.937
If you don't believe it's any good, but it might be, you can give it to a few patients.

03:47:30.977 --> 03:47:33.178
And if you see a signal, then you can give it to more patients.

03:47:33.218 --> 03:47:34.219
If you can get it.

03:47:34.399 --> 03:47:35.160
If you can get it.

03:47:35.460 --> 03:47:36.620
But you can't get it in Canada.

03:47:36.640 --> 03:47:37.801
The pushback is incredible.

03:47:39.742 --> 03:47:43.025
The stigmatization of doctors, the punishment of doctors.

03:47:43.065 --> 03:47:46.788
But you also, you make a really good point in your document, right?

03:47:47.088 --> 03:47:52.152
Which is that doctors who have a number of patients below a certain threshold.

03:47:52.172 --> 03:47:53.272
Never see anything bad.

03:47:53.392 --> 03:47:55.414
What they see are anecdotes, right?

03:47:55.554 --> 03:47:59.957
And so you need a practice of a certain size before you see anything you're going to regard as a stigma.

03:47:59.977 --> 03:48:00.498
600 or more, 900.

03:48:00.758 --> 03:48:04.241
That wouldn't matter so much if the doctors were in a position to

03:48:04.961 --> 03:48:11.404
Encounter each other online and say, you know, I had the weirdest and they won't talk about it And the point is the stigma for talking about it in public.

03:48:11.504 --> 03:48:20.668
I can't tell you this is driving the paramedics won't talk about it They see all the professionals in all of the related disciplines the number of people who will say to you well, I

03:48:21.048 --> 03:48:27.229
Actually, here's what I'm seeing, but I'd really rather not because you know what happens if I do.

03:48:27.329 --> 03:48:27.829
I get fired.

03:48:27.969 --> 03:48:28.169
Right.

03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:31.170
And the point is that's a signal in and of itself, right?

03:48:31.230 --> 03:48:36.651
That is a signal that some phenomenon does not want this discussed.

03:48:36.731 --> 03:48:45.973
And frankly, again, if you imagine that what we've got now at the very least, right, we've got an excellent prophylactic that is extremely safe.

03:48:46.493 --> 03:48:49.414
We've got an excellent treatment that is extremely safe.

03:48:49.434 --> 03:48:50.554
Those are both ivermectin.

03:48:50.934 --> 03:48:56.097
Then we've got fluvoxamine, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, so it gets to some place.

03:48:59.819 --> 03:49:03.401
Ivermectin is a proven prophylactic and a proven treatment.

03:49:06.883 --> 03:49:10.285
Not vitamin D, not previous immunity.

03:49:10.305 --> 03:49:12.386
Do you hear this?

03:49:13.287 --> 03:49:15.588
Not that the PCR tests are inaccurate.

03:49:18.052 --> 03:49:27.212
We've got ivermectin as a prophylactic and ivermectin as a treatment and fluvoxamine and fluvoxamine.

03:49:29.517 --> 03:49:32.560
the brain fog and all that, and long haul COVID.

03:49:33.180 --> 03:49:37.284
These things, that's a pretty good kit to deal with this pandemic.

03:49:37.464 --> 03:49:40.166
It's a good kit for ending this pandemic.

03:49:40.186 --> 03:49:49.955
A good kit that Zev Zelenko did not have, his good kit was hydroxychloroquine, quercetin, zinc, anything to get zinc into cells.

03:49:51.036 --> 03:49:54.960
They haven't mentioned zinc once, they haven't mentioned vitamin D once, they haven't mentioned

03:49:56.101 --> 03:49:56.981
Zelenko once.

03:49:57.041 --> 03:50:00.142
They barely, barely mentioned hydroxychloroquine.

03:50:00.602 --> 03:50:04.343
And they mentioned ivermectin and flumoxamine every chance they get.

03:50:10.004 --> 03:50:16.665
And the only reason why they're not wearing masks is because Brett is using ivermectin prophylactically, which is 100% effective.

03:50:17.945 --> 03:50:22.086
And the other two are injected twice with Moderna shot.

03:50:23.456 --> 03:50:28.858
And what we have is, I can't swear that it's related, but it's certainly conspicuous.

03:50:28.878 --> 03:50:42.863
It's the only hypothesis I can think of that we have financial interests of private corporations that involve these excellent treatments not being available in order to try experimental stuff that's not out of patent.

03:50:43.704 --> 03:50:46.765
But I wanted to point out something cryptic that's hanging out here.

03:50:46.785 --> 03:50:48.285
You said it's going to cost $20,000 to do a randomized

03:50:50.486 --> 03:50:51.787
20 million bucks, sorry, what did I say?

03:50:52.648 --> 03:50:54.889
20 million, that's not a small amount of money.

03:50:55.609 --> 03:51:09.198
So when somebody online, whoever they are, however well-intentioned they are, whatever degree they may have, when they say really the only thing that's going to convince me that I should risk my patient's life with ivermectin, which is of course an insane

03:51:10.189 --> 03:51:12.249
assertion that there's any risk at all, really.

03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:15.310
Depending, so long as you keep the dose within the safe range.

03:51:15.330 --> 03:51:17.170
Within the range that we know to be safe, right?

03:51:17.270 --> 03:51:20.791
Of course, there's some risk, but... Like all drugs.

03:51:20.831 --> 03:51:20.991
Right.

03:51:21.051 --> 03:51:25.992
The problem is... But with ivermectin, the risk profile is extremely well known.

03:51:26.532 --> 03:51:28.332
It's been out there for decades.

03:51:28.352 --> 03:51:30.893
40 years, 4 billion doses already delivered.

03:51:30.933 --> 03:51:31.273
Just so.

03:51:31.613 --> 03:51:31.793
Right.

03:51:32.013 --> 03:51:33.433
So, here's the point.

03:51:33.533 --> 03:51:36.454
When you, as a warrior on Twitter,

03:51:37.214 --> 03:51:40.036
start battling for, hey, I'm a science person.

03:51:40.116 --> 03:51:44.820
I want to see the randomized controlled trial before I give patients any risk at all for ivermectin.

03:51:44.840 --> 03:51:56.828
What you're effectively doing is you are a warrior on behalf of new and less well-known drugs that are still under patent and against drugs that are old and out of patent, because who's going to pony up the $20 million?

03:51:56.868 --> 03:51:58.870
For something they can't make a profit on.

03:51:58.910 --> 03:52:01.832
For something they can't make a profit on and that would block their EUA.

03:52:01.952 --> 03:52:03.113
I live this, OK?

03:52:03.433 --> 03:52:04.314
I set up a company.

03:52:05.474 --> 03:52:16.041
Therac Pharmaceuticals for Zika, and I worked closely with the DoD and developed a portfolio of drugs, repurposed drugs, many of which are now being applied to COVID because they're antivirals.

03:52:17.141 --> 03:52:17.982
I went bankrupt.

03:52:19.123 --> 03:52:26.067
The investment community had zero interest because there's no way- We should be able to verify that he went bankrupt, right?

03:52:26.087 --> 03:52:27.528
Otherwise, you wouldn't use that term.

03:52:28.308 --> 03:52:32.152
Bankrupt means you file for having no money and want forgiveness for it.

03:52:32.172 --> 03:52:49.048
So it's a weird you term to use I Doubt that he went bankrupt to make a buck Okay, and pharma would not partner because there's no way to make a buck and you can't so so that I have direct personal experience validating the thesis

03:52:50.029 --> 03:52:57.535
that the financial incentives around drug repurposing are such that it doesn't get done.

03:52:57.975 --> 03:53:00.016
Well, even worse is you can't get an EUA.

03:53:00.036 --> 03:53:01.577
Can you give me a pen?

03:53:02.038 --> 03:53:02.298
Yes, sir.

03:53:02.318 --> 03:53:03.239
I got one.

03:53:03.299 --> 03:53:04.760
You can't get an EUA.

03:53:05.180 --> 03:53:11.445
We applied for an EUA at the FDA, and they basically said, eh, we're not convinced by your evidence.

03:53:14.247 --> 03:53:20.072
And you need to come to us with a drug company to show us how it's going to be made.

03:53:20.752 --> 03:53:22.814
It's a drug that's already on the market, right?

03:53:22.854 --> 03:53:28.478
They're not even set up for issuing an EUA on a repurposed drug.

03:53:28.899 --> 03:53:29.739
No, they're not.

03:53:30.039 --> 03:53:30.400
You're right.

03:53:30.480 --> 03:53:31.741
You're fundamentally right.

03:53:31.801 --> 03:53:33.242
OK, can I finish, please?

03:53:34.163 --> 03:53:36.124
Wow, what is going on there?

03:53:36.665 --> 03:53:40.288
With a drug company to show us how it's going to be made.

03:53:40.988 --> 03:53:43.030
It's a drug that's already on the market, right?

03:53:43.090 --> 03:53:48.694
They're not even set up for issuing an EUA on a repurposed drug.

03:53:49.134 --> 03:53:49.955
No, they're not.

03:53:50.275 --> 03:53:50.616
You're right.

03:53:50.696 --> 03:53:52.077
You're fundamentally right.

03:53:57.120 --> 03:54:01.222
So we reached out to all these drug manufacturers.

03:54:01.602 --> 03:54:03.783
Usually, we would get no response at all.

03:54:04.544 --> 03:54:16.129
And the ones that we did, and I won't say who they were, but thank you for responding, was, yeah, look, we can't really come up with a financial justification to get involved.

03:54:16.169 --> 03:54:17.850
And I said, I'll pay for all your expenses.

03:54:18.570 --> 03:54:21.131
you know, I'll cover all your costs.

03:54:21.732 --> 03:54:23.053
Eh, we just don't want to do it.

03:54:23.413 --> 03:54:37.881
So I can't even, even if I had their phase three trial that they need, which I do have now, they still would, I still would not be able to get an EUA on a repurposed drug.

03:54:38.781 --> 03:54:45.946
The weird thing is, is that Steve doesn't seem to understand that what's missing from his, from his

03:54:47.779 --> 03:54:58.464
EUA authorization would be a plausible mechanism by which an SSRI would help with a viral infection that's largely focused on the lungs.

03:55:00.105 --> 03:55:16.073
You see, he can argue all he wants, but there's not really a plausible mechanism by which this working, crossing the blood-brain barrier, this kind of thing, is not a mechanistic explanation for why it would have antiviral properties and therefore giving it an EUA

03:55:18.988 --> 03:55:28.743
on numbers where it's 50 or 60% effective would not make sense because if you don't have a mechanistic explanation for why you should consider that a significant effect,

03:55:29.889 --> 03:55:32.009
then chances are it's just a random effect.

03:55:32.690 --> 03:55:35.110
At least that's the way I would see the argument.

03:55:35.150 --> 03:55:39.491
And I think Steve is portraying it as though these people aren't listening to reason.

03:55:39.511 --> 03:55:41.031
They're not following their own rules.

03:55:41.751 --> 03:55:53.514
But he's discarding this idea that there should be some mechanistic understanding of what you expect the drug to do and why that expectation is in line with the results that you see.

03:55:55.342 --> 03:56:02.908
And so if you think ivermectin is a drug that interferes with the replication of the virus, then you should see and you should describe it as that.

03:56:03.488 --> 03:56:05.350
You should see a reduction in viral load.

03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:16.858
If you think it's something that's a zinc ionophore, then you should see and show evidence of that and why that would be expected to reduce all cause mortality with regard to COVID.

03:56:16.898 --> 03:56:17.339
But don't.

03:56:18.613 --> 03:56:23.176
Don't think that you don't need to have an explanation for how you think the drug works.

03:56:24.096 --> 03:56:27.838
And I doubt that Steve had an explanation for why an SSRI would work.

03:56:28.459 --> 03:56:34.002
I think it was set up to be a little bit of a fake, you know, thing to object about.

03:56:35.063 --> 03:56:44.628
When he's never once sat us down with a picture and said, here's how a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor can help you against COVID.

03:56:45.088 --> 03:56:47.590
And that's a pretty interesting statement.

03:56:48.035 --> 03:56:49.696
I don't know why that all of a sudden went blank.

03:56:51.217 --> 03:56:53.958
Hopefully, this computer will wake up in just a second here.

03:56:55.359 --> 03:56:57.761
Otherwise, I'll have to find this thing again.

03:56:58.121 --> 03:56:59.381
I think it was just going to sleep.

03:57:01.483 --> 03:57:04.344
Yeah, so I have a thought here.

03:57:04.804 --> 03:57:05.505
You tell me, actually.

03:57:05.525 --> 03:57:06.806
You're the expert on whether or not.

03:57:06.826 --> 03:57:08.427
I don't know why that all of a sudden went blank.

03:57:08.447 --> 03:57:09.267
Hold on one second.

03:57:09.287 --> 03:57:11.948
Let me see if I can cut over and cut over and cut over.

03:57:11.969 --> 03:57:14.730
It's not working.

03:57:17.998 --> 03:57:23.560
Why is this not working?

03:57:24.060 --> 03:57:25.880
It's playing it, but I can't see it.

03:57:26.140 --> 03:57:27.221
I don't know what happened here.

03:57:27.281 --> 03:57:31.182
It's supposed to be right here, but I don't see my screen anymore.

03:57:31.202 --> 03:57:32.602
I'm going to pull this out once.

03:57:34.483 --> 03:57:35.483
Put this back in.

03:57:39.564 --> 03:57:39.905
Shoot.

03:57:40.265 --> 03:57:40.885
Something crashed.

03:57:40.965 --> 03:57:41.525
Oh, there we go.

03:57:41.705 --> 03:57:42.765
I think I got it back now.

03:57:44.066 --> 03:57:45.306
I just got to move this over here.

03:57:46.727 --> 03:57:46.947
Yep.

03:57:47.267 --> 03:57:47.647
There we go.

03:57:49.147 --> 03:57:50.090
Thanks for your patience.

03:57:50.110 --> 03:57:50.731
Sorry about that.

03:57:51.653 --> 03:57:53.598
Thing is plausible, but here's my sense.

03:57:57.136 --> 03:57:59.478
SARS-CoV-2 is a funny virus, right?

03:58:01.159 --> 03:58:08.644
It seems to infect a number of different creatures, but especially high on the list are minks and ferrets, right?

03:58:08.744 --> 03:58:15.129
Now, I think that this is highly likely to be the result of experiments that may have produced this virus, but it doesn't really matter.

03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:21.814
The thing is, ferrets and minks appear to be the only creatures who not only contract COVID, but can also pass it on like human beings do.

03:58:22.788 --> 03:58:26.931
I'm not entirely sure that there aren't some other domestic animals.

03:58:27.311 --> 03:58:28.893
There are domestic animals that catch it.

03:58:29.013 --> 03:58:31.214
I don't know of any domestic animals that transmit it.

03:58:31.274 --> 03:58:32.996
Now, if I'm wrong about that, I'm wrong about that.

03:58:34.096 --> 03:58:35.497
No, I don't know that you're right or wrong.

03:58:35.637 --> 03:58:40.461
What I know is that to detect that signal would be really tough.

03:58:40.901 --> 03:58:42.042
Yeah, but here's the thing.

03:58:42.302 --> 03:58:44.544
The mink ferret signal, not tough.

03:58:44.624 --> 03:58:45.665
We've seen that one.

03:58:45.705 --> 03:58:46.565
So here's the question.

03:58:47.626 --> 03:59:02.953
is there room for some kind of guerrilla research effort where ferrets i mean imagine you got 2 000 ferrets but why do you need to do a guerrilla research because what you want is the quick and dirty

03:59:04.835 --> 03:59:12.805
randomized controlled trial that demonstrates the effectiveness, the safety, and doesn't cost the 20 million bucks.

03:59:13.285 --> 03:59:15.228
So there are ways to do that.

03:59:15.528 --> 03:59:16.129
Right.

03:59:16.269 --> 03:59:17.811
It's like the Seftel trial, right?

03:59:17.891 --> 03:59:19.754
Instead of having the rigor

03:59:20.494 --> 03:59:23.675
of a IRB-approved randomized controlled trial.

03:59:24.116 --> 03:59:28.457
When David Seftal did his study, it was like, hey, I got two options for you.

03:59:28.537 --> 03:59:28.938
You choose.

03:59:28.958 --> 03:59:31.319
Let me document that, and I'll publish the results.

03:59:31.619 --> 03:59:41.823
Well, if you do that 1,000 times, if there are 100 physicians that do the same thing, and they publish the same result, do you really need a randomized controlled trial?

03:59:41.883 --> 03:59:44.464
Believe me, I think the signal here is such a slam dunk.

03:59:44.604 --> 03:59:46.725
It's 100% effect size.

03:59:46.865 --> 03:59:49.606
So what you're talking about is building a new animal model.

03:59:50.194 --> 04:00:00.400
Well, no, I'm talking about the fact that, A, because ferrets and minks, which are very close relatives, that's why this is true, have a human-like ACE2 receptor, right?

04:00:00.620 --> 04:00:06.443
Which is, if this was the product of research in Wuhan, this is probably why they would have used ferrets.

04:00:06.503 --> 04:00:07.144
What did he do?

04:00:07.184 --> 04:00:08.584
Did he just shake his head no?

04:00:08.604 --> 04:00:09.905
What did he do there?

04:00:09.925 --> 04:00:10.746
Oh, man, did you see that?

04:00:19.717 --> 04:00:20.337
Did you see it?

04:00:20.357 --> 04:00:21.898
He shook his head no.

04:00:21.918 --> 04:00:22.878
He shook his head no.

04:00:22.898 --> 04:00:27.200
Mark has been trying to impress upon me that he didn't think that the lab leak was necessarily part of the plan.

04:00:40.865 --> 04:00:49.271
that adding that part of the narrative wasn't necessarily part of the narrative that they were gonna do, and that they may have conceded that later.

04:00:50.773 --> 04:00:58.779
And holy smokes, if I don't see it right now, that he's saying, no, that didn't happen yet.

04:01:00.100 --> 04:01:04.883
They haven't conceded to the lab leak narrative yet here.

04:01:05.384 --> 04:01:06.785
That's incredible to me.

04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:08.690
That's incredible.

04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:09.531
Did you see it?

04:01:09.551 --> 04:01:10.171
Oh yeah!

04:01:28.447 --> 04:01:31.468
animal that has the appropriate receptor in order to create a human effect.

04:01:31.488 --> 04:01:34.990
And it's universally used for influenza vaccine research, for example.

04:01:35.270 --> 04:01:36.891
So readily available, you can order them.

04:01:37.651 --> 04:01:40.632
Universally available for flu vaccine research.

04:01:40.673 --> 04:01:49.056
Of course, we've already been told in 2012 and 11 and 12 that they enriched an avian flu virus to become aerosolized in ferrets.

04:01:49.096 --> 04:01:49.677
That's also why

04:01:50.819 --> 04:01:52.281
Brett is so excited to bring it up.

04:01:52.321 --> 04:01:53.322
He feels so smart.

04:01:54.384 --> 04:01:58.870
So all I'm saying is that that is a ready-made model for COVID.

04:01:59.511 --> 04:02:03.416
And that therefore, anything that we need to demonstrate, I mean, look, you get 2,000 Farads, okay?

04:02:05.889 --> 04:02:08.910
Half of them are treatment, half of them are control, right?

04:02:09.190 --> 04:02:12.852
You give the half that are treatment, ivermectin, you then expose them to COVID.

04:02:12.992 --> 04:02:22.916
My guess is you're gonna find out that they don't get sick, the ones that aren't protected with COVID do get sick, and then you take those that got COVID and you divide them in half, right?

04:02:23.116 --> 04:02:31.499
And you treat those that got COVID with ivermectin or a placebo and voila, we're gonna know everything we need to know from that experiment, I would imagine.

04:02:32.259 --> 04:02:35.940
So, um, I used to be a primate center researcher at Davis.

04:02:36.220 --> 04:02:42.481
I do understand animal models and I have good friends who have been at the tip of the spear in developing the animal models for here.

04:02:42.821 --> 04:02:46.342
We've got pretty good animal model in the golden hamster, golden hamster.

04:02:46.462 --> 04:02:47.442
So we don't have to go there.

04:02:48.123 --> 04:02:53.464
And, um, yes, those, those hamster gets COVID and transmits it.

04:02:53.964 --> 04:02:55.044
I don't know about transmission.

04:02:55.064 --> 04:02:58.745
If you want to ask transmission question, that's a different, but you can still check.

04:02:58.985 --> 04:03:00.405
How can it not transmit?

04:03:00.425 --> 04:03:02.586
I don't understand how they can even say that.

04:03:03.707 --> 04:03:09.228
If it doesn't recapitulate transmission, then how is it an adequate model for infection?

04:03:09.248 --> 04:03:10.909
I don't get that at all.

04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:11.589
That's weird.

04:03:16.931 --> 04:03:26.694
Tip of the spear is something that I know other people use a lot, and certainly I've never used the word tip of the spear, at least not in the context of how other people use it.

04:03:27.696 --> 04:03:37.125
My point is, if you're going to go down there, there's a whole lot that goes into building a good animal model, including titrating the virus dose and a whole ton of stuff.

04:03:37.505 --> 04:03:38.126
It's not cheap.

04:03:39.207 --> 04:03:41.388
And at the end, remember what I said?

04:03:42.109 --> 04:03:42.650
Mice lie.

04:03:43.110 --> 04:03:43.951
Monkeys mislead.

04:03:44.391 --> 04:03:46.153
The only thing it tells us about humans is humans.

04:03:46.733 --> 04:03:48.295
Ah, but wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:03:48.355 --> 04:03:51.017
I used to have that on a slide with his face on it.

04:03:51.057 --> 04:03:51.577
Remember that?

04:03:51.858 --> 04:03:53.899
The way that we can really tell about humans

04:03:54.580 --> 04:03:59.361
in this kind of a context is a meta-analysis, which we've got.

04:03:59.381 --> 04:04:00.362
So Mark is right.

04:04:01.382 --> 04:04:06.523
They knew that they couldn't test this on anybody but humans because if they tested it on animals, of course it wouldn't work.

04:04:07.864 --> 04:04:20.827
They didn't have any higher expectations for humans, but the excuse is now, the excuse is for Robert that mice and monkeys don't tell you anything about humans, but they do if it's a poison.

04:04:22.386 --> 04:04:29.232
They do if it's wholly inappropriate for all mammals that you want to live a long and healthy life.

04:04:30.513 --> 04:04:44.284
And I think all experiments in mice and all experiments in animals that have been done with transfections have told us that it's not an appropriate therapeutic strategy for human beings.

04:04:46.346 --> 04:04:47.607
And they're not saying that here.

04:04:48.584 --> 04:04:50.907
None of these gentlemen are saying that here.

04:04:51.548 --> 04:04:54.212
None of these gentlemen are keeping their arms straight.

04:04:54.693 --> 04:04:56.816
None of these gentlemen are keeping their arms straight.

04:04:57.847 --> 04:04:59.308
We've got two of them.

04:05:00.148 --> 04:05:01.029
But hold on a second.

04:05:01.289 --> 04:05:18.100
I have to go just a little bit down this rabbit hole here, because I believe that the golden hamsters have anomalously long telomeres, which will be the result of their captive breeding, which have an implication for how susceptible they are to toxic phenomena like spike protein.

04:05:18.800 --> 04:05:20.481
So, okay.

04:05:20.741 --> 04:05:21.182
It could be.

04:05:21.202 --> 04:05:21.662
All right.

04:05:22.062 --> 04:05:45.278
So my, so Brett Weinstein has done exactly one molecular biological study that had to do with telomeres and gotten one result scientifically that he now believes is a, is a ground truth of biology that longer telomeres can make animals susceptible to toxicities and to sickness and to all kinds of misfunction.

04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:50.052
And so he thinks he has a very unique insight on something.

04:05:50.092 --> 04:05:52.474
And that's why he's saying this to Robert.

04:05:52.494 --> 04:05:57.558
And that's why Robert's kind of like, okay, well, whatever you say, sure, go ahead.

04:05:58.078 --> 04:06:06.384
This is the only card that is meaningful molecular biology that Brett ever can hope to play.

04:06:07.617 --> 04:06:11.300
And often he misplays it and he's misplaying it here, but that's okay.

04:06:11.701 --> 04:06:13.342
He's trying to play with the big boys.

04:06:13.402 --> 04:06:14.343
Let's see how he does.

04:06:14.623 --> 04:06:26.914
Fences that ferrets actually are a better model also because we can model not only the effect of the drug on the animal, but we can also model the epidemiological impact.

04:06:27.264 --> 04:06:27.844
Could be.

04:06:28.144 --> 04:06:39.687
And you're dead on that one of the lovely things about ferrets and respiratory viruses is that we have a huge body of literature on transmissibility and how to assess it.

04:06:41.248 --> 04:06:42.448
So that's all fair too.

04:06:42.908 --> 04:06:51.651
So what you're criticizing is the folks in the animal model community that have made some strategic decisions that you disagree with and that

04:06:54.316 --> 04:06:58.921
That may be that they should have gone down that rabbit hole instead of the one that they did.

04:06:59.341 --> 04:07:04.066
And as far as Golden Hamster, I'm no fan of that model.

04:07:04.326 --> 04:07:05.167
But I'm just saying that

04:07:08.118 --> 04:07:16.722
Even if we were to do what you did, which is a non-trivial investment, we still don't get to what Tess has done.

04:07:17.683 --> 04:07:18.623
Or Andy Hill.

04:07:18.803 --> 04:07:26.007
I think the signal is so strong, and if the signal was that strong and the drug is that safe, the whole thing just stops.

04:07:26.047 --> 04:07:27.348
So what is about to happen?

04:07:28.888 --> 04:07:40.535
And what happened was there was some large trials started with ivermectin and the data was supposed to come in right before the WHO determination and it didn't come in because this is how it is with clinical trials.

04:07:40.915 --> 04:07:42.536
Sometimes you get the enrollment that you want.

04:07:42.936 --> 04:07:46.718
It's turning out to be wicked hard to enroll trials with COVID.

04:07:46.798 --> 04:07:47.419
It just is.

04:07:47.619 --> 04:07:49.260
Well, WHO doesn't have any outpatient trials.

04:07:50.660 --> 04:07:51.561
Which is another problem.

04:07:52.081 --> 04:07:53.421
They're not WHO trials.

04:07:53.541 --> 04:07:58.803
So there are trials, large trials pending, Andy Hill tells me.

04:08:00.424 --> 04:08:06.106
And we discussed at length about what he was going to disclose and when publicly.

04:08:07.266 --> 04:08:22.838
And together we made a decision, it's his decision, I was just counseling him, to just stop releasing interim results and wait for these large trial results, and they're scheduled to come in about September.

04:08:23.538 --> 04:08:23.718
No.

04:08:24.979 --> 04:08:28.720
The WHO already knows that ivermectin works.

04:08:28.760 --> 04:08:29.400
We already have.

04:08:29.580 --> 04:08:35.282
There's never been a case where a peer-reviewed... He's really opposing Robert here.

04:08:35.322 --> 04:08:36.422
This is pretty impressive.

04:08:37.343 --> 04:08:40.664
Even though it's about ivermectin, it's impressive what's happening here.

04:08:40.724 --> 04:08:45.785
But I think it might... it's just to fool us into thinking that there's a discussion going on here.

04:08:45.805 --> 04:08:47.046
They're not talking about

04:08:48.018 --> 04:09:07.366
the most important fundamental issues, which is the PCR test being misused, pneumonia being mistreated, remdesivir being used, midazolam being used in the two countries that he's singing about, the VAERS reports and the yellow card reports.

04:09:07.406 --> 04:09:17.470
He's not talking about remdesivir or midazolam and about vitamin D. This is all just disturbing to see

04:09:18.683 --> 04:09:32.173
that a year after or more, maybe even a year and a half after I started advocating for those things, don't transfect people, use vitamin D and zinc, like Zelenko says, and we have previous existing immunity.

04:09:32.713 --> 04:09:38.698
These guys have been talking for one hour and 47 minutes and haven't said any of those things.

04:09:39.418 --> 04:09:43.339
natural immunity, vitamin D, don't transfect people.

04:09:43.659 --> 04:09:45.940
They haven't said any of those things.

04:09:46.500 --> 04:09:54.763
And at this stage in our history, I had already been saying those things for more than a year and a half, gotten fired at American medical school for it.

04:09:55.283 --> 04:09:56.243
Do you see this?

04:09:58.464 --> 04:10:00.805
These people are fake leaders.

04:10:00.865 --> 04:10:02.505
They are fake objectors.

04:10:02.565 --> 04:10:08.387
They are not people who held their arms straight when it was necessary to hold your arms straight.

04:10:10.526 --> 04:10:16.831
And in fact, they are actively engaged in getting people to drop their arms right now on this stream.

04:10:18.733 --> 04:10:20.074
Give up and submit.

04:10:20.654 --> 04:10:21.795
This is the way it is.

04:10:22.376 --> 04:10:24.077
These are the things that are going on.

04:10:24.457 --> 04:10:27.220
These guys are speaking up so you don't have to do anything.

04:10:28.761 --> 04:10:34.426
Censorship was more important to mention over and over than the overt coercion that it resulted in.

04:10:37.159 --> 04:10:53.071
They talk about the censorship, but they don't talk about how the censorship resulted in coercion, which is the real reason and the worst reason why we weren't able to exercise informed consent in so many cases around the world because of the coercion.

04:10:53.091 --> 04:10:59.916
The censorship was just a passive version and it enabled people to say, hey,

04:11:03.547 --> 04:11:05.591
You have to see this for what it is.

04:11:05.671 --> 04:11:07.976
These people are bad news.

04:11:09.660 --> 04:11:12.866
They are part of something that we are not a part of.

04:11:12.906 --> 04:11:14.891
They are part of a club that we are not in.

04:11:16.209 --> 04:11:26.940
And it doesn't even matter if at this stage in time, Steve is in the club or Brett is in the club, or both of them think that the other one's not in the club, but I'm in the club because Robert said I'm in the club.

04:11:27.460 --> 04:11:32.205
Something is going on here besides three guys trying to speak out carefully.

04:11:32.726 --> 04:11:33.787
I assure you.

04:11:35.643 --> 04:11:55.259
systematic review and meta-analysis has been overturned, because I asked an expert in this area, and I said, hey, what happens if you have the top level of evidence, and you have one systematic review that says it works, and you have another one that says it causes harm, then how do you resolve that?

04:11:56.100 --> 04:12:00.584
And she says, well, that's never happened in history, so we don't have to worry about that.

04:12:00.904 --> 04:12:04.327
So you're advising the WHO to wait,

04:12:04.927 --> 04:12:10.892
is counter to... I'm not advising the WHO, I'm advising Andy Hill, who's now at the same position.

04:12:10.972 --> 04:12:13.875
Yeah, but now it's a moot point, okay?

04:12:13.935 --> 04:12:16.337
Because we now have this peer-reviewed... We agree.

04:12:16.557 --> 04:12:17.358
It is a moot point.

04:12:17.758 --> 04:12:19.620
Ivermectin clearly works, right?

04:12:19.680 --> 04:12:22.122
The signal is overwhelmingly clear.

04:12:22.302 --> 04:12:22.742
It's done.

04:12:23.043 --> 04:12:38.515
And the people who are saying it isn't clear enough don't make sense because their next sentence is we shouldn't prescribe it until we have better evidence, when in fact, because it's a safe drug and because the evidence in their mind is not clear, you should prescribe it and see if it works, because the alternative is sent people home.

04:12:38.535 --> 04:12:50.585
You're being a hypocrite if you're saying, hey, oh, I... And so this doesn't apply to hydroxychloroquine in their mind, even though that is what Peter McCullough spoke out in 2020 about.

04:12:52.844 --> 04:12:57.849
Peter McCullough got burnt for using hydroxychloroquine even though hydroxychloroquine worked.

04:12:59.030 --> 04:13:04.595
Peter McCullough was in front of the Texas Senate and the United States Senate saying that they're lying about the swollen hearts.

04:13:05.116 --> 04:13:15.085
I know they're lying about the swollen hearts because I have a technician who's held more hearts in her hand than anyone else and she can tell you that hydroxychloroquine doesn't cause that problem.

04:13:17.657 --> 04:13:20.241
Where is this part of the story in June of 2021?

04:13:20.341 --> 04:13:23.906
Where is this part of the story in June of 2021?

04:13:24.006 --> 04:13:27.010
Why isn't anybody mentioning that?

04:13:28.292 --> 04:13:30.556
Because that's not part of the narrative they're pushing.

04:13:31.497 --> 04:13:33.420
That's not the objective of this video.

04:13:34.226 --> 04:13:39.610
subscribe to evidence-based medicine, and I believe in the triangle, and this is the way it's done.

04:13:39.931 --> 04:13:41.432
And then they don't do it.

04:13:41.972 --> 04:13:43.153
They don't walk the talk.

04:13:43.253 --> 04:13:43.694
It's hypocritical.

04:13:43.714 --> 04:13:44.054
It's preposterous.

04:13:44.154 --> 04:13:55.944
It's an anomaly, and it seems to match the incentives of a corporation that's got two EUAs in play and potentially a lot of money to be made if we can't

04:13:56.565 --> 04:13:59.307
deal with the pandemic and we have to get lost.

04:13:59.367 --> 04:14:02.469
I'd just like to add one more log to your fire.

04:14:02.850 --> 04:14:03.130
Okay.

04:14:04.071 --> 04:14:18.902
Um, in the, in the roster of, uh, the blizzard of criticisms about the ivermectin data, one that comes up often is that these small studies that have been done across the world in various sites independently,

04:14:20.255 --> 04:14:22.117
are not peer-reviewed and published.

04:14:22.557 --> 04:14:32.245
And the log I want to add on the fire is that it's become wicked hard to get anything through peer review involving repurposed drugs.

04:14:33.137 --> 04:14:38.418
which is why I set up that whole special edition of Frontiers in Pharmacology for repurposed drugs.

04:14:38.978 --> 04:14:40.059
And then all of them quit.

04:14:40.099 --> 04:14:40.979
And then it got killed.

04:14:41.759 --> 04:14:44.760
Well, no, all of the editors quit.

04:14:44.840 --> 04:14:45.720
Yeah, I was one of them.

04:14:45.880 --> 04:14:48.161
I was one of the leaders on that.

04:14:48.201 --> 04:14:54.202
Because the journal, because once these papers had gotten through, the journal decided to

04:14:54.662 --> 04:14:56.323
Well, we don't like this.

04:14:56.483 --> 04:14:58.705
The ivermectin was very arbitrary.

04:14:58.745 --> 04:15:02.328
So I would say that's another signal of some kind of emergent capture.

04:15:02.508 --> 04:15:15.118
That's all I wanted to share, is this argument that's put out by your hypothetical objector that's out there, who has not ever tried to publish anything, but by God, they're an expert.

04:15:16.479 --> 04:15:18.580
And I deal with them all the time on LinkedIn and Twitter.

04:15:19.721 --> 04:15:29.509
But the objection that those data in that, those meta-analyses are not peer-reviewed and published.

04:15:30.850 --> 04:15:47.083
overlooks the fact that it has become insanely, bizarrely, and I know because I interact with my academic colleagues, we've never encountered a situation like this, where it has become this difficult

04:15:47.623 --> 04:15:49.944
to get anything through peer review.

04:15:50.224 --> 04:15:55.485
And anything that has to do with repurposed drugs is just almost impossible.

04:15:55.505 --> 04:16:00.266
No, but it's easy if you have a study where you claim that the repurposed drug doesn't work.

04:16:00.446 --> 04:16:04.707
So we call that a negative reporting bias.

04:16:05.007 --> 04:16:09.548
And I think there is a number of instances that support

04:16:10.888 --> 04:16:16.613
You know, classically, there's a positive reporting bias, that the negative studies never get published.

04:16:17.313 --> 04:16:19.235
Here at Storybrooke, this is the opposite of that.

04:16:19.315 --> 04:16:34.628
So you're confusing everybody by just not stating it as clearly as Steve did, that it's really easy to publish a negative study about a repurposed drug, and it's very hard to publish a positive study about a repurposed drug with regard to COVID.

04:16:35.028 --> 04:16:37.811
It's really not that difficult to say those words,

04:16:38.925 --> 04:16:40.787
It's really not that difficult to describe it.

04:16:40.807 --> 04:16:57.840
You don't have to call it a negative publication bias where there's normally a positive publication bias, unless the idea is to confuse college kids that are casually listening or to confuse 50 plus year old adults who don't have all the biology and technical jargon in their head.

04:16:58.361 --> 04:17:02.444
Do you hear what Robert Malone is doing here?

04:17:03.705 --> 04:17:04.706
Do you hear it?

04:17:06.587 --> 04:17:07.448
Oh, that's what happened.

04:17:12.754 --> 04:17:15.095
Something froze over here somehow.

04:17:15.375 --> 04:17:17.015
What the hell is this all about?

04:17:17.135 --> 04:17:17.735
Is that better?

04:17:18.635 --> 04:17:19.576
Is this working now?

04:17:20.396 --> 04:17:20.616
No.

04:17:22.516 --> 04:17:23.496
That's what happened.

04:17:27.237 --> 04:17:27.797
I see.

04:17:28.077 --> 04:17:29.218
So I'm going to keep this playing.

04:17:29.258 --> 04:17:29.438
Sorry.

04:17:29.478 --> 04:17:30.498
Classic p-hacking stuff.

04:17:30.518 --> 04:17:30.718
Right.

04:17:30.838 --> 04:17:36.919
We have currently some pretty strong evidence that the script has been flipped.

04:17:37.320 --> 04:17:37.460
Yep.

04:17:38.760 --> 04:17:39.240
Which is

04:17:40.501 --> 04:17:45.623
It is a priori evidence of some kind of corruption of the system, right?

04:17:45.963 --> 04:17:47.344
Or, or it's just an anecdote.

04:17:48.004 --> 04:17:58.949
Well, the point is, what it does is it says the deck is stacked against, uh, for some reason that we don't need to know in order to understand that we have to be alert.

04:17:59.549 --> 04:18:02.130
It was Janet Woodcock and it was also Rick Bright.

04:18:02.170 --> 04:18:04.511
They were in the meetings, um, where that happened.

04:18:04.531 --> 04:18:04.971
You're correct.

04:18:05.273 --> 04:18:06.334
I can't imagine what that would be.

04:18:06.614 --> 04:18:07.914
I want to say a few things.

04:18:08.314 --> 04:18:08.575
OK.

04:18:08.655 --> 04:18:14.717
I want to make sure that before we finish up that we cover the issue of reproductive harm because I feel like we should.

04:18:14.777 --> 04:18:14.857
Sure.

04:18:14.877 --> 04:18:15.137
Yeah.

04:18:15.157 --> 04:18:15.338
Yeah.

04:18:15.378 --> 04:18:15.678
Yeah.

04:18:15.698 --> 04:18:15.978
So OK.

04:18:16.018 --> 04:18:18.579
So let me just say I've been saving this.

04:18:19.720 --> 04:18:20.960
So for in pain.

04:18:21.160 --> 04:18:22.421
So if you get hospitalized

04:18:23.481 --> 04:18:29.027
You know, like Robert just said, oh, you know, the doctors are the front lines, they're coming up with innovative treatments.

04:18:29.447 --> 04:18:41.158
I found it's almost the reverse because someone called me because her husband was in one of our hospitals, El Camino Hospital.

04:18:42.019 --> 04:18:48.452
And she called me for help because he was in bad shape, he was in ICU.

04:18:48.993 --> 04:18:52.961
And so I've known about these drugs, ciproheptadine, and inhaled adenosine.

04:18:53.826 --> 04:19:01.774
And both of these are like for ciprohepatidine, 50% of the time, you give this, it's an antihistamine, right?

04:19:01.954 --> 04:19:05.678
I mean, it's really cheap, eight milligrams, three times a day.

04:19:06.539 --> 04:19:15.368
And you go from, and I posted on this on my Twitter account, you go from lungs, which are like dark, to fully clear in 48 hours.

04:19:16.591 --> 04:19:18.912
And the physicians say, we've never seen anything like this.

04:19:19.292 --> 04:19:20.793
Happens about 50% of the time.

04:19:21.633 --> 04:19:28.776
And so I try to get El Camino Hospital to do this on this patient.

04:19:28.796 --> 04:19:31.877
I said, I'm a friend of the wife.

04:19:31.957 --> 04:19:33.798
She's authorized me to talk to you.

04:19:33.918 --> 04:19:37.360
And he said, well, I have to get that IRB approved.

04:19:38.440 --> 04:19:39.460
And it was like a Saturday.

04:19:39.500 --> 04:19:42.362
So I had to reach out and contact the IRB.

04:19:42.682 --> 04:19:43.302
He doesn't need it.

04:19:44.082 --> 04:19:44.843
I would suggest.

04:19:45.973 --> 04:19:51.216
Honestly, if you want to talk about that, I would suggest that Bret Weinstein wants to be part of the ruling class.

04:19:52.897 --> 04:19:56.799
Bret Weinstein wants to be part of the ruling class, just like a lot of other people do.

04:19:58.360 --> 04:20:04.403
And I think he was given the opportunity to join the ruling class as part of the intellectual dark web.

04:20:05.250 --> 04:20:32.511
with his brother leading the funding to make sure that his podcast and his brother's podcast and Sam Harris's podcast and Joe Rogan's podcast and Shapiro's podcast and the Daily Wire and all these other things were ready and controlled and populated so that when the narrative needed to be controlled, the two sides of the narrative could be crafted the way they wanted to be crafted.

04:20:34.028 --> 04:20:35.728
And this is an extension of that.

04:20:35.808 --> 04:20:40.549
Maybe it's a, maybe it's an adjustment to the plan.

04:20:40.589 --> 04:20:43.630
Maybe they didn't think that they needed to do this, but now they're doing it.

04:20:43.690 --> 04:20:50.452
And so that's why it's still a very haphazardly done rollout of the message.

04:20:50.472 --> 04:20:52.732
They're not sure what message they need to give yet.

04:20:53.812 --> 04:20:55.333
So they're still titrating it out.

04:20:55.373 --> 04:20:57.793
That's why the clones word came up once.

04:20:57.913 --> 04:21:00.894
That's why, that's why these things are,

04:21:02.023 --> 04:21:05.850
not as oiled out with Steve as they are with Robert.

04:21:06.552 --> 04:21:12.303
That's why we're still working through the, what can we really say and not say is still being decided in this video.

04:21:16.312 --> 04:21:17.213
IRB approval.

04:21:17.934 --> 04:21:21.278
But he told me, hey, if you can get an IRB approved, I have no trouble doing it.

04:21:21.679 --> 04:21:22.960
So I get the IRB approval.

04:21:23.140 --> 04:21:25.904
And the IRB guy says, you don't need IRB approval.

04:21:25.944 --> 04:21:26.825
It's a repurposed drug.

04:21:27.465 --> 04:21:28.887
So I tell him that.

04:21:28.967 --> 04:21:29.988
And he says, well, let me check that.

04:21:30.289 --> 04:21:33.693
So he calls the guy just to verify that I was telling him the truth.

04:21:34.113 --> 04:21:36.035
And then he says, yeah, but we're not going to do it.

04:21:37.346 --> 04:21:38.367
And I said, well, why?

04:21:38.407 --> 04:21:39.708
You know, here are all the papers.

04:21:40.008 --> 04:21:41.389
Here's all the justification.

04:21:42.029 --> 04:21:42.990
Why would you not do this?

04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:45.391
And he said, well, we're just not going to do it.

04:21:45.451 --> 04:21:49.794
We convinced the patient not to accept that therapy.

04:21:50.194 --> 04:21:55.478
And it's like, here you go and you give them the treatment on a silver platter.

04:21:56.258 --> 04:22:09.669
and they say no we're not going to do it and it's the same thing for ivermectin right when people have gone to court to force doctors to give ivermectin and the hospital doesn't want to do it because if the hospital

04:22:10.598 --> 04:22:15.241
gives a drug which has not been approved by the NIH.

04:22:15.722 --> 04:22:17.823
They are liable if something happens.

04:22:18.224 --> 04:22:22.807
Because if they follow what the NIH says, then they're clean of liability.

04:22:22.847 --> 04:22:30.132
So the hospital actually doesn't want to give you stuff that would save your life because the NIH is keeping it from you.

04:22:30.192 --> 04:22:31.053
Hang on, Robert.

04:22:31.373 --> 04:22:32.754
I know you want to talk, but hang on.

04:22:34.275 --> 04:22:37.998
Wow, that is pretty condescending shit right there from Steve.

04:22:38.438 --> 04:22:39.199
That's impressive.

04:22:42.321 --> 04:22:51.837
It's interesting because he is making a valid point that if they stay on the CDC protocol, they'll get financial protection and they get legal protection as well, right?

04:22:51.877 --> 04:22:53.941
For not knowing what they're doing, but doing what they're told.

04:22:54.492 --> 04:23:06.695
The other thing is that in a pandemic, another solution rather than the ferrets and animals is just to, doctors are always, the outpatient doctors are always trying new things.

04:23:06.735 --> 04:23:11.456
And so if they reported in to the FDA, that's all we need, right?

04:23:11.496 --> 04:23:21.479
Because you see all the data coming in and you can see, holy moly, the doctors that are giving the ivermectin and fluvoxamine, they've got like no hospitalization.

04:23:22.299 --> 04:23:29.281
Repeatedly and so you can see a signal there and the final thing and then Robert I'll let you talk is that Bruce Patterson.

04:23:29.501 --> 04:23:30.682
That was awesome.

04:23:30.822 --> 04:23:36.844
Is specializing in long-haul COVID and he's found that there are four drugs that are effective for long haulers.

04:23:38.104 --> 04:23:40.745
It's fluvoxamine, ivermectin,

04:23:41.945 --> 04:23:44.907
simvastatin, or statin, and maraviroc.

04:23:45.408 --> 04:23:47.009
Stats.

04:23:47.649 --> 04:23:49.090
I have problems with pronouncing it also.

04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:52.032
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:23:52.052 --> 04:23:57.136
And those four drugs, he's found that, well, some people need these two, and other people need these two.

04:23:57.156 --> 04:23:57.516
He's still smiling.

04:23:57.796 --> 04:23:59.237
I have problems with pronouncing it also.

04:23:59.257 --> 04:24:02.179
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:24:02.199 --> 04:24:09.564
And those four drugs, he's found... We can't pronounce drug names, and people are dying by the thousands every day from a gain-of-function virus.

04:24:09.664 --> 04:24:10.525
It's pretty funny, right?

04:24:10.985 --> 04:24:36.574
that well some people need like these two and other people need these two and other people need this dose and so forth and he measures the biomarkers so he has a scientific way to tell which of those four but those four drugs he says that if one of his friends gets acute COVID which means you got COVID he says if they take these four drugs right because he knows what works because long-haul COVID is essentially oh I get to experiment on you until I cure you

04:24:37.214 --> 04:24:45.163
And then, so he says, hey, if this works in long-haul COVID, then isn't that interesting that ivermectin works in acute COVID?

04:24:45.444 --> 04:24:47.946
And isn't it interesting that fluoxamine works in acute COVID?

04:24:48.187 --> 04:24:50.830
So if I was running ACTIV6,

04:24:52.231 --> 04:24:56.532
I would take Bruce up on the offer and I would use all four of these drugs.

04:24:56.552 --> 04:24:58.633
Okay, so I can speak to that too.

04:24:58.753 --> 04:24:58.973
Okay.

04:24:59.893 --> 04:25:01.154
So you hit on three things.

04:25:01.174 --> 04:25:01.934
Let's see if I can remember.

04:25:02.154 --> 04:25:03.974
Active six was one.

04:25:04.074 --> 04:25:04.475
What is that?

04:25:05.195 --> 04:25:05.615
We'll get there.

04:25:05.775 --> 04:25:06.415
Okay.

04:25:06.935 --> 04:25:12.717
One is the inherent paradox of the disincentives for hospitals.

04:25:13.669 --> 04:25:13.809
Yep.

04:25:14.149 --> 04:25:14.329
Okay.

04:25:14.669 --> 04:25:14.829
Right.

04:25:15.250 --> 04:25:17.770
Um, uh, and I figured what the third one was.

04:25:18.251 --> 04:25:41.379
Um, so let me just do the two that I, that I, that I remember, um, on that the hospital has two components and, and, oh, well the third one is, I just wanted to acknowledge what a pleasure it is, um, interacting with you because you often, oh, I remember now the third one, you often independently arrive at the same position, which kind of is validating.

04:25:41.499 --> 04:25:41.679
Yeah.

04:25:42.219 --> 04:25:42.299
Um,

04:25:42.839 --> 04:25:46.381
that the team that I work with at the DOD comes to.

04:25:47.201 --> 04:26:01.009
I work closely with a team at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in the Joint Science and Technology Office that's specifically focused on coming up with systems to allow rapid response for outbreaks and engineered pathogens

04:26:12.495 --> 04:26:13.176
for warfighters.

04:26:13.216 --> 04:26:13.816
That's our mission.

04:26:13.936 --> 04:26:15.938
So hold on, I want to highlight something.

04:26:16.258 --> 04:26:18.700
What you said will be misinterpreted by some people.

04:26:19.060 --> 04:26:31.510
When somebody else arrives at the same position, yes, that's very nice and validating, but what you're really saying is if somebody arrives at the same position from a different starting point, it's very likely that that position has a great deal of merit, right?

04:26:31.610 --> 04:26:35.613
It's a signal that the thing is actually robust because it doesn't matter where you start, you land there.

04:26:36.093 --> 04:26:36.394
Just so.

04:26:36.734 --> 04:26:37.114
Well put.

04:26:37.314 --> 04:26:37.634
Thank you.

04:26:37.935 --> 04:26:38.615
Okay.

04:26:41.021 --> 04:27:05.960
The comment that you made about actually really saying is if the DOD comes to, okay, I work closely with a team at the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in the Joint Science and Technology Office that specifically focus... So he called it DOD at first, then he says DTRA, and it's about, you know, finding systems to deal with biotechnology for the warfighter in the field.

04:27:06.736 --> 04:27:13.703
on coming up with systems to allow rapid response for outbreaks and engineered pathogens for warfighters.

04:27:13.723 --> 04:27:14.364
That's our mission.

04:27:14.944 --> 04:27:16.466
I want to highlight something.

04:27:16.786 --> 04:27:19.208
What you said will be misinterpreted by some people.

04:27:19.729 --> 04:27:22.071
He also said engineered pathogens.

04:27:23.112 --> 04:27:33.940
the technology office that's specifically focused on coming up with systems to allow rapid response for outbreaks and engineered pathogens for warfighters.

04:27:34.160 --> 04:27:39.804
So what if there aren't any real engineered pathogens that we need to be worried about except for synthetic viruses?

04:27:39.864 --> 04:27:40.705
Is that what he means?

04:27:42.171 --> 04:27:47.393
Or is he seeding the narrative that there are synthetic pathogens and that this could be one of them?

04:27:47.413 --> 04:27:49.734
You see, it's very clever what's happening here.

04:27:49.754 --> 04:27:50.395
It's our mission.

04:27:50.515 --> 04:27:52.516
So hold on, I want to highlight something.

04:27:52.836 --> 04:27:55.277
What you said will be misinterpreted by some people.

04:27:55.637 --> 04:27:59.098
When somebody else arrives at the same position, yes, that's very nice and validating.

04:27:59.138 --> 04:28:07.582
But what you're really saying is if somebody arrives at the same position from a different starting point, it's very likely that that position has a great deal of merit.

04:28:08.163 --> 04:28:12.190
It's a signal that the thing is actually robust because it doesn't matter where you start, you land there.

04:28:12.651 --> 04:28:12.951
Just so.

04:28:13.312 --> 04:28:13.672
Well put.

04:28:13.893 --> 04:28:14.153
Thank you.

04:28:17.594 --> 04:28:34.827
The comment that you made about setting up a system to enable patient-reported outcomes and physician-reported outcomes on a national or global basis is a profound statement.

04:28:35.848 --> 04:28:37.369
We have nothing like that.

04:28:38.069 --> 04:28:44.134
My friends at the FDA also came to that conclusion, and they're frustrated because it doesn't exist.

04:28:47.215 --> 04:28:48.716
My friends at the FDA again.

04:28:49.816 --> 04:28:52.837
We have, you know, you come from the Silicon Valley culture.

04:28:55.057 --> 04:29:03.720
And that culture gives us, as a nation, some incredible tools, including machine learning and artificial intelligence and deep learning.

04:29:04.820 --> 04:29:14.743
And if we were to set up a system, as you're proposing, to enable distributed capture

04:29:15.700 --> 04:29:25.948
of primary reports from practicing physicians and then apply our amazing toolkit now for analysis of that.

04:29:26.969 --> 04:29:39.619
It is probably one of the strongest things that we could do that would have the lowest cost in terms of being able to identify and discriminate signal and noise from novel interventions.

04:29:39.659 --> 04:29:40.420
So that's that one.

04:29:40.660 --> 04:29:42.021
Good job, we agree.

04:29:42.958 --> 04:29:56.491
And if you did it here, if you had that in place here, it would have identified a kit of, it sounds like four drugs that between them are essentially sufficient, which is amazing because frankly, antivirals that actually work and are safe.

04:29:56.511 --> 04:29:59.174
So it's curious because he's not saying domain here.

04:29:59.214 --> 04:30:05.540
And he's not saying that they used an AI to find the drugs that they identified as remdesivir and other things.

04:30:05.580 --> 04:30:06.922
He's not saying that right now.

04:30:08.325 --> 04:30:20.994
But he's suggesting that it's cool that Steve suggested of setting up a system to capture the reports from physicians and then use AI or machine learning to extract from that data meaningful interpretations.

04:30:22.755 --> 04:30:28.399
Sounds a lot like trying to give up our sovereignty in order to get us out of a mess.

04:30:29.920 --> 04:30:37.666
Sounds like trying to give up our genetic data and our medical data to get us out of a mess, to use AI to get us out of a mess.

04:30:39.716 --> 04:30:43.417
Sounds like a bunch of transhuman hocus pocus to me there, Robert.

04:30:44.518 --> 04:30:46.758
Well, there's a reason for that we can unpack, but let's not.

04:30:46.778 --> 04:30:47.639
I want to get down to it.

04:30:47.659 --> 04:30:49.799
But amazing that with this pandemic, that actually.

04:30:49.819 --> 04:30:54.621
So hospitals, hospitals, you've identified one of the structural disincentives.

04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:57.330
which is legal liability.

04:30:57.370 --> 04:31:00.412
And remember who the cops are that are enforcing this.

04:31:01.272 --> 04:31:02.233
It's administrators.

04:31:02.433 --> 04:31:03.233
It's not docs.

04:31:04.774 --> 04:31:06.836
So what you have is MBAs.

04:31:06.876 --> 04:31:07.796
They're not allowed to.

04:31:08.036 --> 04:31:12.939
MBAs controlling the practice of medicine and the use of alternative drugs.

04:31:13.019 --> 04:31:19.243
The other disincentive they have, and this is really coming out of the federal treasury.

04:31:19.363 --> 04:31:21.284
This is coming out of your tax dollars.

04:31:22.225 --> 04:31:22.465
Okay.

04:31:23.166 --> 04:31:41.985
Is that, um, they don't make the same compensation if, if they're, if they prescribe remdesivir, you know, six or 8,000 bucks pop, um, for treatment course versus they prescribe ivermectin.

04:31:43.527 --> 04:31:44.608
Okay.

04:31:44.628 --> 04:31:46.108
12 bucks a dose or something.

04:31:46.529 --> 04:31:47.769
They're not making the same nickel.

04:31:48.170 --> 04:31:48.430
Right.

04:31:48.890 --> 04:31:52.712
So there's a legal liability structural disincentive.

04:31:52.772 --> 04:31:53.713
Yeah, it's a disincentive.

04:31:53.773 --> 04:31:55.814
And there is a financial disincentive.

04:31:57.475 --> 04:31:58.955
Now, what was the third one we were talking about?

04:31:58.975 --> 04:32:03.358
See, now we keep using these words that confuse people like disincentive, this kind of thing.

04:32:03.398 --> 04:32:05.039
Why not just say it very clearly?

04:32:05.119 --> 04:32:06.759
Remdesivir is more profitable.

04:32:09.401 --> 04:32:10.902
Why not just say it clearly?

04:32:11.678 --> 04:32:18.042
If the goal is to inform people, why do people like Brett Weinstein and Robert Malone talk the way that they talk?

04:32:19.103 --> 04:32:20.764
Just ask yourself that question.

04:32:21.124 --> 04:32:22.505
It doesn't make it any easier.

04:32:24.247 --> 04:32:26.808
Would it help if I use bigger words like these guys?

04:32:26.888 --> 04:32:31.291
If I use those disincentive and dispositive proof and all this other crap?

04:32:32.012 --> 04:32:32.652
Of course not.

04:32:34.073 --> 04:32:38.016
I'm not trying to reach those high level elite readers.

04:32:39.502 --> 04:32:41.704
I'm trying to reach average Joe and Jane.

04:32:41.784 --> 04:32:58.495
I'm trying to reach the average person on the street that's not a biological expert, that's dabbled in telomere biology and immunology and evolutionary biology as the perfect toolkit to interpret the pandemic biology.

04:33:00.196 --> 04:33:02.958
So who are these guys talking to when they talk like this?

04:33:03.899 --> 04:33:05.480
That's your question you need to ask.

04:33:08.444 --> 04:33:11.341
the other big theme that you were hitting on.

04:33:12.039 --> 04:33:14.660
which I've now lost because I got lost in the hospital world.

04:33:14.700 --> 04:33:19.181
I was talking about long COVID and the fact that, uh, it's a place to test.

04:33:19.201 --> 04:33:20.861
You've got a bunch of different tools.

04:33:22.542 --> 04:33:24.582
Um, yeah, so no, I've lost that.

04:33:25.163 --> 04:33:26.043
Well, hold on.

04:33:26.283 --> 04:33:35.785
Um, before we go to reproductive, uh, before we go to reproductive harms, damn, I've now lost what I was going to say.

04:33:36.226 --> 04:33:37.746
I could give you my, my paper.

04:33:38.026 --> 04:33:40.807
Um, but, uh, there's another, uh, drug, um,

04:33:41.807 --> 04:33:46.150
which we funded the work on, which is GS441524.

04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:48.591
And this is an antiviral.

04:33:48.831 --> 04:33:52.293
It's, in fact, sort of the precursor to remdesivir.

04:33:52.834 --> 04:33:55.695
And it works really, really well.

04:33:55.995 --> 04:34:01.239
But it's being pursued by Victoria Yan, who's just an individual.

04:34:01.279 --> 04:34:04.741
And so she's raised some money privately to do this.

04:34:07.742 --> 04:34:22.008
A long hauler essentially got this drug and the long hauler said, oh my God, I have been a long hauler for like six months, I have been in pain, I can't get out of, and a week

04:34:23.235 --> 04:34:31.664
Or it was like three days after taking this gs4 4 1 5 2 4 she said like I Have I like back to normal.

04:34:32.025 --> 04:34:40.434
I have never seen say, you know, it's like it was Couldn't believe it right, you know and and Gilead is doing nothing, right?

04:34:40.454 --> 04:34:40.474
I

04:34:41.134 --> 04:34:41.755
On this drug.

04:34:41.855 --> 04:35:05.451
I mean it's crazy and it's much safer than remdesivir It's easier much easier to produce and yet the Gilead has totally dropped the ball on This thing which was transformative for this long haul so somehow there's enough bias in this system to shut down Anything generic cheap and safe and to amplify things that are dangerous news still under patent can understand it's multifactorial, right?

04:35:05.491 --> 04:35:06.431
It's multifactorial now.

04:35:06.491 --> 04:35:06.932
Here's the thing.

04:35:06.972 --> 04:35:10.134
I forgot I've come back up with it the

04:35:10.874 --> 04:35:12.636
I was talking to Pierre Corey about this.

04:35:13.276 --> 04:35:17.299
There's something that bugs me about what doctors once were and what they've become.

04:35:17.780 --> 04:35:22.223
And my sense is doctors, you know, I used the example of Frontier doctors when I was talking to him.

04:35:22.984 --> 04:35:25.766
Frontier doctors had a lot fewer tools at their disposal, right?

04:35:25.806 --> 04:35:29.589
A lot less knowledge about what could be done, a lot fewer drugs, right?

04:35:29.969 --> 04:35:33.834
But what they had was the ability to interact with patients.

04:35:33.854 --> 04:35:40.522
The house call led you to see the context in which somebody was sick, led you to see the pattern of sickness in a neighborhood.

04:35:40.562 --> 04:35:42.745
There are all kinds of things that you might detect.

04:35:42.825 --> 04:35:43.787
Classical diagnosis.

04:35:44.067 --> 04:35:44.227
Right.

04:35:44.307 --> 04:35:46.410
And the point is, doctors were scientists.

04:35:46.770 --> 04:35:46.950
right?

04:35:47.291 --> 04:36:01.403
They may have been informal scientists but they were in a position to experiment and tinker and you give the patient a hypothesis and it's right it doesn't really work and you've got something's bugging you in the back of your mind that actually this looks more like that and so you try the thing that works on that and lo and behold the person gets better.

04:36:02.203 --> 04:36:21.169
That kind of scientific doctoring is shut down by exactly the processes you're talking about the lies The the the liability sensitivity of the hospital right the the the FDA Broadcasting, you know checklists are on high all of these things are resulting in the information that would be screwed

04:36:21.169 --> 04:36:33.864
screaming at us if each doctor was having the same patients and you know they sit down at lunch with their buddy and they say you know I've got this patient I don't know what to do oh I had one of those and here's what I did and it worked and then you know the point is it would spread.

04:36:33.904 --> 04:36:41.413
It's not only that it shut down structurally but the new wrinkle now is communication about it is forbidden.

04:36:42.014 --> 04:36:42.234
Right.

04:36:42.855 --> 04:36:46.820
It prevents the natural accumulation of information that would make us smarter.

04:36:47.020 --> 04:36:48.962
And people don't believe it, too.

04:36:49.302 --> 04:36:54.368
And when I see, like, there's a case of a doctor who I finally convinced to use fluvoxin.

04:36:54.808 --> 04:36:56.791
So he says, okay, fine, I'll use it in my practice.

04:36:57.271 --> 04:37:02.537
It'll be, if you're over 65, you have multiple risk factors, and you have symptoms and, you know,

04:37:02.997 --> 04:37:08.562
You're in bad shape then only then will I use it and it's this is like are you kidding me, right?

04:37:08.582 --> 04:37:11.685
You're supposed to use it as soon as the patient presents, right?

04:37:11.985 --> 04:37:18.991
And you're supposed to use it even you should be even using it on kids because I mean the tragedy is that There's a doctor.

04:37:19.032 --> 04:37:20.473
I know that said oh you're a kid.

04:37:20.493 --> 04:37:21.814
I'm not gonna give you anything, right?

04:37:21.914 --> 04:37:27.177
Well, fluvoxamine is really a very mild drug.

04:37:27.798 --> 04:37:37.023
And what happened is that the 17-year-old developed Tourette's syndrome as a result of the long-haul COVID.

04:37:37.804 --> 04:37:40.485
And so this doctor said, OK, I learned my lesson.

04:37:41.006 --> 04:37:42.907
I am going to treat even the kids.

04:37:42.967 --> 04:37:43.947
Can he say that?

04:37:44.047 --> 04:37:46.169
Can he say that it's a really mild drug?

04:37:46.209 --> 04:37:48.130
It's an SSRI inhibitor.

04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:52.553
To give an SSRI inhibitor to the developing brain of a teenager.

04:37:55.156 --> 04:37:56.777
To stop long COVID.

04:37:58.496 --> 04:38:00.037
to use prophylactically.

04:38:00.117 --> 04:38:06.041
This kind of advocation for a drug known to cross the blood brain barrier is absurd.

04:38:06.682 --> 04:38:07.763
It's absurd.

04:38:08.323 --> 04:38:09.384
It's absurd.

04:38:09.864 --> 04:38:20.292
Can I tell you how much I think it is absurd that Steve is so focused on this one substance and no other one?

04:38:21.413 --> 04:38:27.557
Can I tell you how absurd it is that Brett Weinstein is focused on ivermectin and not one other one?

04:38:33.826 --> 04:38:37.369
And so you have the physicians who are like, oh, can't do any harm.

04:38:37.389 --> 04:38:39.150
We'll only treat you if you're necessary.

04:38:39.551 --> 04:38:41.012
But this is a virus.

04:38:41.032 --> 04:38:44.074
You always treat viruses early.

04:38:44.174 --> 04:38:47.877
It's like if you had a fire right here on your laptop, you'd be like this.

04:38:47.917 --> 04:38:50.940
I would need a randomized controlled trial to see if water would help.

04:38:51.480 --> 04:38:52.301
Right.

04:38:52.321 --> 04:38:58.246
The 17-year-old developed a really very mild drug.

04:38:59.867 --> 04:39:02.789
What happened is that... A very mild drug.

04:39:02.809 --> 04:39:08.153
The 17-year-old developed Tourette's syndrome as a result of the long-haul COVID.

04:39:08.673 --> 04:39:12.296
And so Tourette's syndrome comes from long COVID, is what Steve says.

04:39:13.296 --> 04:39:17.559
And if he would have used the SSRI inhibitor on that kid, he wouldn't have it.

04:39:19.561 --> 04:39:20.281
Do you hear him?

04:39:20.301 --> 04:39:21.702
Do you see what they're doing here?

04:39:21.742 --> 04:39:22.843
It's constant.

04:39:22.863 --> 04:39:23.904
They're not stopping.

04:39:25.776 --> 04:39:28.457
And so this doctor said, OK, I learned my lesson.

04:39:28.977 --> 04:39:30.878
I am going to treat even the kids.

04:39:31.198 --> 04:39:34.739
And so you have the physicians who are like, oh, can't do any harm.

04:39:34.759 --> 04:39:36.520
We'll only treat you if you're necessary.

04:39:36.920 --> 04:39:38.380
But this is a virus.

04:39:38.400 --> 04:39:39.861
You always treat viruses

04:39:40.621 --> 04:40:08.337
early quickly it's like it's like if you had a fire right here on your laptop you'd you'd be like i would need a randomized controlled trial to see if water would help right no no but it's a it's a reasonable metaphor you take the glass of water and put out the fire you wouldn't like wait and wait and wait and wait oh yeah it's really big now right you'll call the fire department all right i want to push back in one place okay and it's not so we know that's true about remdesivir we know that they have data that shows that remdesivir doesn't do anything

04:40:09.471 --> 04:40:14.404
for the survival rate unless you use it early, but are they mentioning that now in September of 2021?

04:40:14.444 --> 04:40:14.544
No.

04:40:14.564 --> 04:40:14.605
No.

04:40:23.377 --> 04:40:24.177
serious pushback.

04:40:24.197 --> 04:40:25.398
I think what you found is right.

04:40:25.418 --> 04:40:27.858
I'm compelled that we've got multiple drugs that work, okay?

04:40:28.198 --> 04:40:33.820
I'm a little nervous about fluvoxamine because it's an SSRI, and so I know it's gonna have cognitive implications.

04:40:33.920 --> 04:40:35.140
Not in 14 days.

04:40:35.680 --> 04:40:42.962
Maybe not, but the point is I'm a little cautious about it because I know it's interacting with systems that we ideally would like not to mess with.

04:40:43.122 --> 04:40:45.062
Don't take coffee when you're taking fluvoxamine.

04:40:45.422 --> 04:40:47.023
Okay, but here's my point, right?

04:40:48.126 --> 04:40:52.631
we've got a drug that seems to have no serious interactions with other systems.

04:40:52.711 --> 04:40:54.773
And so it should be your go-to first.

04:40:55.113 --> 04:40:58.236
If you've got fog, maybe fluvoxamine is the go-to.

04:40:58.256 --> 04:40:59.738
No, no, no, no, no.

04:40:59.958 --> 04:41:11.250
And the reason for that is that this, you're, you're thinking that this virus should be treated, you know, tenderly and gingerly and let's only put, you know, remember David Hope?

04:41:12.270 --> 04:41:13.371
You remember David's sister?

04:41:13.831 --> 04:41:16.692
AIDS, the guy that came up with multi-drug combinations for AIDS.

04:41:17.053 --> 04:41:18.693
It's early and hard.

04:41:19.554 --> 04:41:24.136
And so the point is that COVID is so deceptive.

04:41:24.216 --> 04:41:25.757
It's not the right analogy, and here's why.

04:41:26.017 --> 04:41:26.437
OK.

04:41:26.858 --> 04:41:27.318
Here's why.

04:41:27.438 --> 04:41:34.442
Because the problem with AIDS was as a retrovirus,

04:41:35.402 --> 04:41:38.905
you had an impossibly fast rate of evolution.

04:41:39.465 --> 04:41:43.148
And so the reason you hit it with three drugs is that it can evolve in three directions at once.

04:41:43.288 --> 04:41:43.469
Yeah.

04:41:43.569 --> 04:41:43.689
Right.

04:41:43.969 --> 04:41:46.051
And so the point is, should I miss that?

04:41:46.071 --> 04:41:46.771
I'm going to go back.

04:41:46.811 --> 04:41:47.172
Sorry.

04:41:47.932 --> 04:41:51.055
We're going for the five hour marathon, six hour marathon.

04:41:51.115 --> 04:41:55.578
No, I want to hear the Dr. Steve have cognitive implications, not not in 14 days.

04:41:56.599 --> 04:42:02.622
Maybe not, but the point is I'm a little cautious about it because I know it's interacting with systems that we ideally would like not to mess with.

04:42:02.862 --> 04:42:05.983
Don't, yeah, don't take coffee when you're taking Fluboxamine.

04:42:06.343 --> 04:42:07.964
Okay, but here's my point, right?

04:42:09.045 --> 04:42:13.568
We've got a drug that seems to have no serious interactions with other systems.

04:42:13.828 --> 04:42:15.710
And so it should be your go-to first.

04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:19.152
If you've got fog, maybe fluvoxamine is the go-to.

04:42:19.192 --> 04:42:20.653
No, no, no, no.

04:42:20.873 --> 04:42:32.181
And the reason for that is that you're thinking that this virus should be treated, you know, tenderly and gingerly and let's only put, you know, remember David Hope?

04:42:33.188 --> 04:42:34.149
You remember David Ho, right?

04:42:34.749 --> 04:42:37.630
AIDS, the guy that came up with multi-drug combinations for AIDS.

04:42:37.991 --> 04:42:39.631
It's early and hard.

04:42:40.472 --> 04:42:44.394
And so the point is that COVID is so deceptive.

04:42:45.134 --> 04:42:46.695
It's not the right analogy, and here's why.

04:42:46.955 --> 04:42:47.375
OK.

04:42:47.776 --> 04:42:48.256
Here's why.

04:42:48.376 --> 04:42:55.380
Because the problem with AIDS was, as a retrovirus,

04:42:56.340 --> 04:42:59.843
you had an impossibly fast rate of evolution.

04:43:00.383 --> 04:43:04.086
And so the reason you hit it with three drugs is that it can't evolve in three directions at once.

04:43:04.226 --> 04:43:04.406
Yeah.

04:43:04.466 --> 04:43:04.606
Right?

04:43:04.906 --> 04:43:11.911
And so the point is, it's like, you know, one of these military things where you've got guns on three islands and it stifles the enemy.

04:43:12.212 --> 04:43:15.634
In this case... I'm sorry, but I'm actually shocked by what Brett's saying.

04:43:15.754 --> 04:43:20.037
I don't think Brett knows Jack about the evolutionary rate of AIDS.

04:43:21.478 --> 04:43:23.480
And how the evolutionary rate of AIDS

04:43:25.091 --> 04:43:28.513
factors into the infection and its time course.

04:43:28.593 --> 04:43:36.276
So the idea that he's saying that the AIDS virus has an impossibly fast rate of evolution is ridiculous.

04:43:37.536 --> 04:43:38.517
Ridiculous.

04:43:40.461 --> 04:43:46.003
No evidence that I'm aware of that there's actually any evolution away from the kind of protection you get from ivermectin.

04:43:46.664 --> 04:43:50.305
And so the point is, if ivermectin works, you've got an evolution.

04:43:50.365 --> 04:43:51.086
No, no, no.

04:43:51.246 --> 04:43:53.006
OK, so here's my counter argument.

04:43:53.106 --> 04:43:54.907
OK, Robert, you can go next.

04:43:54.967 --> 04:43:55.267
OK.

04:43:56.168 --> 04:43:57.548
So my counter argument is this.

04:43:58.069 --> 04:43:59.569
So let's take an anecdote.

04:43:59.889 --> 04:44:02.611
OK, let's take Dr. Drew.

04:44:03.411 --> 04:44:04.631
Dr. Drew, he's a doctor.

04:44:05.432 --> 04:44:06.632
He knows what he's doing.

04:44:07.132 --> 04:44:07.753
He got COVID.

04:44:08.744 --> 04:44:14.607
and he went for the monoclonal, he got it early, and he went for ivermectin.

04:44:17.409 --> 04:44:20.030
He went for the monoclonal and he went for ivermectin.

04:44:20.851 --> 04:44:21.351
That was his treatment.

04:44:21.371 --> 04:44:22.532
He didn't do fluoxamine at all.

04:44:23.410 --> 04:44:24.191
Guess what happened to him?

04:44:24.771 --> 04:44:27.594
Well, I'm trying to figure out whether there's any reason to expect.

04:44:28.154 --> 04:44:31.037
I don't think that the monoclonal is going to interact with the ivermectin.

04:44:31.097 --> 04:44:31.618
No, it doesn't.

04:44:31.638 --> 04:44:32.779
They both point to the same thing.

04:44:33.139 --> 04:44:33.539
It doesn't.

04:44:33.619 --> 04:44:33.820
Yeah.

04:44:34.140 --> 04:44:34.440
Right?

04:44:34.760 --> 04:44:35.001
OK.

04:44:35.121 --> 04:44:39.084
Because I think the antiviral for ivermectin is fairly modest.

04:44:39.144 --> 04:44:40.005
But OK.

04:44:40.205 --> 04:44:41.226
So he took those two drugs.

04:44:41.446 --> 04:44:41.607
Yeah.

04:44:41.707 --> 04:44:42.347
Guess what happened?

04:44:43.268 --> 04:44:43.909
He kept getting sick.

04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:45.008
No.

04:44:45.048 --> 04:44:46.629
Well, he ended up with long-haul COVID.

04:44:47.570 --> 04:44:53.773
So the point is that this is a very, very serious virus.

04:44:54.253 --> 04:44:57.254
And people are treating it like it's a regular virus.

04:44:57.554 --> 04:45:01.617
Now, I agree with you about HIV and how it's different.

04:45:01.977 --> 04:45:11.561
But David Ho's point should still be the same for this virus in that we should not go and say, like undertreat it.

04:45:12.922 --> 04:45:14.943
If we have safe, effective drug.

04:45:15.003 --> 04:45:17.945
Right, too slow is an error in and of itself, you're right.

04:45:17.965 --> 04:45:28.772
Right, and so in Pierre Khoury's FLCC protocol, they say, well start with ivermectin, but if you're getting worse over two days, then give the fluvoxamine.

04:45:29.372 --> 04:45:34.335
And that's not right, because fluvoxamine, it's not the mental drug.

04:45:34.656 --> 04:45:37.898
It activates sigma-1, which calms down the inflammation.

04:45:38.258 --> 04:45:57.191
And the thing you do not want is- I think the reason why they don't talk about monoclonal antibodies is that they actually work for a brief period of time, and because they're extremely expensive to design and produce, and because they require hospitalization and injection to work.

04:45:58.317 --> 04:46:01.700
So they work in the context of a war fighter.

04:46:02.521 --> 04:46:07.085
They work in the context of somebody you're sparing no expense to save.

04:46:08.526 --> 04:46:11.749
They don't work so much in the context of a general treatment.

04:46:12.890 --> 04:46:22.099
And if you apply an antibody that's not appropriate for the pathogen that you have, you could potentially have a bad reaction or a negative reaction to it.

04:46:23.376 --> 04:46:28.984
I don't think monoclonals are bad, they're just kludgy, as Robert Malone has said many times.

04:46:29.429 --> 04:46:31.210
inflammation in the brain.

04:46:31.290 --> 04:46:34.292
And this is what Dr. Drew suffered from.

04:46:34.653 --> 04:46:38.075
So yes, ivermectin is great, but it's not 100%.

04:46:38.135 --> 04:46:42.958
And once we have a combo, which is 100%.

04:46:42.998 --> 04:46:54.726
And so he's advocating for the fact that his drug of choice, fluvoxamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier, but never gives a mechanistic explanation for how it reduces the effect of long COVID.

04:46:54.746 --> 04:46:56.227
So it's very, very,

04:46:57.711 --> 04:47:02.093
He's missing a lot of biology if he's gonna advocate for that drug.

04:47:02.133 --> 04:47:08.715
He's missing a lot of biology if he's gonna advocate for a less than perfect response.

04:47:08.775 --> 04:47:09.736
It's just annoying.

04:47:11.376 --> 04:47:14.778
Then we can go and say, okay, we're done.

04:47:15.178 --> 04:47:17.299
You've compelled me, right?

04:47:17.479 --> 04:47:24.922
And the answer is my concern, which is real, is minor in comparison to the hazard of COVID.

04:47:25.782 --> 04:47:31.125
Correct, because he was in terrible shape.

04:47:32.006 --> 04:47:35.708
And I said, look, Dr. Drew, you should try the fluvoxamine.

04:47:36.368 --> 04:47:39.450
And I kept beating on him like every time I was on his show.

04:47:40.031 --> 04:47:42.512
And he finally got the fluvoxamine.

04:47:43.052 --> 04:47:45.874
And he said, wow, this is like really game changing.

04:47:46.194 --> 04:47:49.156
And I said, yeah, you know, doctors are the worst patients, aren't they?

04:47:49.676 --> 04:47:49.836
Right.

04:47:50.176 --> 04:48:10.213
So the point is, and so again, we have an anecdotal story about the effectiveness of an SSRI on long COVID as an anecdotal story that it should also work on regular COVID and, and Robert's just sitting there with his finger in the air and both Steve Kirsch and, and

04:48:12.202 --> 04:48:21.911
Brett Weinstein agree that the hazards of COVID are much greater than the hazards of using an SSRI or any other experimental therapy.

04:48:22.512 --> 04:48:28.978
Even transfection is worth the risk because of the hazards of COVID.

04:48:30.960 --> 04:48:32.261
These people are responsible.

04:48:33.618 --> 04:48:42.707
that treat this virus like your life depended on it because you don't want to have any kind of inflammation in your brain.

04:48:42.747 --> 04:48:43.067
All right.

04:48:43.087 --> 04:48:46.190
So I'm compelled and I would say ivermectin is a prophylactic.

04:48:46.290 --> 04:48:47.411
I think that's a slam dunk.

04:48:47.571 --> 04:48:51.295
Treating it with the drugs you've got that work in some reasonable combination is a slam dunk.

04:48:52.506 --> 04:48:53.947
The third point was active six.

04:48:54.487 --> 04:48:54.647
Okay.

04:48:54.687 --> 04:48:55.048
Oh, right.

04:48:55.348 --> 04:48:55.628
Okay.

04:48:55.828 --> 04:48:57.970
And it's germane, it's, it's germane to this.

04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.410
Okay.

04:48:58.810 --> 04:48:59.010
Okay.

04:48:59.571 --> 04:49:02.673
A statement was Steve suggested the obvious.

04:49:04.034 --> 04:49:06.335
Why don't you do trials with these drug combinations?

04:49:07.916 --> 04:49:08.517
Okay.

04:49:08.557 --> 04:49:09.257
So agents.

04:49:09.337 --> 04:49:12.760
So for me, this isn't a theoretical, I'm living it.

04:49:13.260 --> 04:49:15.241
I've been living it for the last nine months.

04:49:15.261 --> 04:49:16.582
Okay.

04:49:16.682 --> 04:49:22.026
I've been trying to advance a two drug and three drug strategy with us government funding.

04:49:22.806 --> 04:49:39.393
Through the FDA because my the source of this capital is coming through the Department of Defense We have to be very rigorous about ensuring human subject safety FDA compliance all that we got to do everything by the book That's the way it is in the DOD these days.

04:49:40.013 --> 04:49:40.794
Not like it used to be.

04:49:40.814 --> 04:49:44.035
Okay, we're really rigorous So we're living it

04:49:45.546 --> 04:49:55.948
I can tell you that the barriers to proceeding with clinical research in either inpatient or outpatient environments for repurposed multi-drug strategies are immense.

04:49:57.088 --> 04:50:06.770
The agency is requiring that we do the full portfolio of drug interaction studies before we are allowed to proceed.

04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:10.411
That's nine to 12 months worth of stuff.

04:50:11.551 --> 04:50:21.298
And in our case, it's for drug combinations that we already have data on substantial numbers of patients because of the things I was talking about, docs tinkering.

04:50:23.720 --> 04:50:33.307
So this idea, which is totally valid and has guided us from the get-go, that we would build, we would learn from David Ho.

04:50:34.728 --> 04:50:37.689
And we would use a multi-drug strategy.

04:50:37.749 --> 04:50:45.932
In this case, for repurposed drugs, what we have is a rich library of capabilities relates to anti-inflammatories.

04:50:46.072 --> 04:50:52.075
Almost all the agents you've been talking about are acting at the level of anti-inflammatories, not antivirals.

04:50:52.155 --> 04:50:54.235
Why are we not focused on antivirals?

04:50:55.876 --> 04:50:58.437
Tamiflu is the best way I can express that.

04:50:59.224 --> 04:51:11.354
The history, long history of coming up with strategies for treating pulmonary viral infections at the level of an antiviral agent is horrible.

04:51:12.174 --> 04:51:13.615
It basically doesn't work.

04:51:13.656 --> 04:51:15.097
It's a strategy that doesn't work.

04:51:15.237 --> 04:51:15.777
Why not?

04:51:16.418 --> 04:51:18.660
Because it's too hard to get it early.

04:51:19.080 --> 04:51:20.401
And that's what you gotta do.

04:51:20.861 --> 04:51:21.442
Okay?

04:51:21.802 --> 04:51:26.446
And what- So he's advocating, I think he's using this active six thing

04:51:27.854 --> 04:51:31.497
as the HIV reference for using multi-drugs.

04:51:31.517 --> 04:51:38.522
And then he says that he's advocating for two and three drug treatments, but the DOD has to go by the book because they're very rigorous in the DOD.

04:51:39.223 --> 04:51:42.105
So they have to do a full portfolio on drug interactions.

04:51:43.226 --> 04:51:46.108
And so we should be learning from HIV and from David Ho.

04:51:47.169 --> 04:51:54.474
And why aren't we all, in addition to using anti-inflammatories, why aren't we using antivirals like Tamiflu?

04:51:54.494 --> 04:51:55.215
It's a really

04:51:56.769 --> 04:51:59.091
It's a really strange situation we're in.

04:51:59.872 --> 04:52:10.943
What you're doing with fluvoxamine, what we're doing with our agents that we're trying to get through the FDA, and perhaps we'll launch in India soon, is that we're attacking the second phase.

04:52:11.940 --> 04:52:14.762
COVID is a hyper-inflammatory response.

04:52:14.962 --> 04:52:16.603
It's not the virus that kills you.

04:52:17.024 --> 04:52:19.305
It's your response to the virus, okay?

04:52:19.646 --> 04:52:24.789
And the good news that, I'm sorry, I'm gonna criticize Tony.

04:52:25.370 --> 04:52:26.450
I didn't wanna go there.

04:52:27.671 --> 04:52:37.979
The thought leaders that have set public strategy in the drug space have decided

04:52:39.884 --> 04:52:43.705
to a large part to emphasize direct acting antivirals.

04:52:45.305 --> 04:53:04.210
And they have sought... It's a very interesting segue he does here because he's talking about antivirals, but what he really should be mentioning is that they have decided to use seroprevalence and the presence of antibodies as a proxy for generating immunity to an immunization.

04:53:06.190 --> 04:53:08.911
That's what he should be saying we have been broken by.

04:53:09.758 --> 04:53:12.999
but instead he says something completely different.

04:53:14.920 --> 04:53:28.745
The thought leaders that have set public strategy in the drug space have decided to a large part to emphasize direct acting antivirals.

04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:37.379
And they have sought to test those most often in a late stage COVID environment.

04:53:38.160 --> 04:53:39.281
And- That's not true.

04:53:39.301 --> 04:53:46.770
Okay, COVID environment maybe, but not for virals, antivirals they test upon exposure.

04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:49.413
Remdesivir was tested upon exposure.

04:53:50.054 --> 04:53:52.476
and it was shown that it doesn't work after.

04:53:52.556 --> 04:53:58.300
So this is a disingenuous representation of what's going on and that's why Steve is reacting that way.

04:53:58.880 --> 04:54:19.634
It is a disingenuous representation of what's going on because we know that the thought leaders have not just emphasized direct acting antivirals, but they have actually emphasized

04:54:23.957 --> 04:54:26.298
Antibody, seroprevalence, right?

04:54:30.319 --> 04:54:33.520
This is what they emphasize over and over and over again.

04:54:34.681 --> 04:54:37.122
This is what all the grant applications are written for.

04:54:37.162 --> 04:54:38.482
These are what the endpoints are.

04:54:38.562 --> 04:54:40.883
These are how they immunobridge to the little kids.

04:54:42.645 --> 04:54:53.671
So in a way here, you have a guy who claims to be objecting and saying that, you know, they're not really, they have chosen to emphasize direct acting antivirals.

04:54:54.131 --> 04:54:55.932
They've chosen to emphasize this.

04:54:55.952 --> 04:54:56.793
That's a mistake.

04:54:57.313 --> 04:55:00.995
They've chosen to emphasize antibody seroprevalence.

04:55:01.435 --> 04:55:02.376
That's the mistake.

04:55:04.057 --> 04:55:11.301
So again, pretending to be a dissident, actually not teaching you anything that can help you actively save your family.

04:55:12.368 --> 04:55:33.029
Like severe hospitalized car that makes no sense and well more importantly it doesn't work But it gives it gives you the faulty signal that there's some ambiguity I mean I've seen this in the ivermectin data where the point is the studies vary and if it takes you five days to get to the patient then of course the signal is weak and

04:55:33.189 --> 04:55:51.903
And if you're giving insufficient drug and you're only giving it for one day, and ivermectin, so in my correspondence with the agency, advocating for an ivermectin-containing arm in the study, I had to write the section about the justification for mechanism of action of ivermectin.

04:55:53.104 --> 04:56:00.229
And just to illustrate the point, okay, so this is, I've never disclosed this publicly, I don't have actually authorization to say so, so maybe I shouldn't.

04:56:00.749 --> 04:56:09.674
But the truth is that I wrote this big long section, summarized the different potential mechanisms of action of ivermectin, most of which are anti-inflammatory.

04:56:11.755 --> 04:56:17.698
The agency wrote back and said, you have to do the studies in cell culture to prove the mechanism of action.

04:56:22.160 --> 04:56:22.800
What's happening?

04:56:22.880 --> 04:56:24.501
Come on, computer, don't screw up.

04:56:27.875 --> 04:56:28.816
I don't know what's going on.

04:56:28.856 --> 04:56:30.457
I think my computer is under attack.

04:56:30.517 --> 04:56:31.278
It's my second.

04:56:31.979 --> 04:56:37.744
It's my, my other, my other computer here that I use for a backup.

04:56:53.010 --> 04:57:19.408
Therapy and it's like here you go and you give them the treatment on a silver platter That bugs me about what doctors once were and what they've become and my sense is doctors You know, I used the example of frontier doctors when I was talking to him Frontier doctor about ensuring human subject safety FDA compliance all that we got to do everything by the book That's the way it is in the DOD these days not like it used to be.

04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:21.289
Okay, we're really rigorous.

04:57:22.069 --> 04:57:22.650
So we're living it

04:57:23.631 --> 04:57:25.932
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.

04:57:27.534 --> 04:57:30.856
At the level of an antiviral agent is horrible.

04:57:31.677 --> 04:57:33.118
It basically doesn't work.

04:57:33.178 --> 04:57:34.619
It's a strategy that doesn't work.

04:57:34.739 --> 04:57:35.300
Why not?

04:57:35.940 --> 04:57:38.162
Because it's too hard to get it early.

04:57:38.583 --> 04:57:40.944
And that's what you gotta do.

04:57:41.305 --> 04:57:50.152
And what you're doing with Fluvoxamine, what we're doing with our agents that we're trying to get through the FDA, and perhaps we'll launch in India soon,

04:57:51.218 --> 04:57:53.139
is that we're attacking the second phase.

04:57:54.100 --> 04:57:56.942
COVID is a hyper-inflammatory response.

04:57:57.142 --> 04:57:58.783
It's not the virus that kills you.

04:57:59.203 --> 04:58:01.485
It's your response to the virus, okay?

04:58:01.825 --> 04:58:06.969
And the good news, I'm sorry, I'm gonna criticize Tony.

04:58:07.549 --> 04:58:08.630
I didn't wanna go there.

04:58:09.851 --> 04:58:20.158
The thought leaders that have set public strategy in the drug space have decided

04:58:22.051 --> 04:58:25.874
to a large part to emphasize direct acting antivirals.

04:58:27.495 --> 04:58:34.460
And they have sought to test those most often in a late stage COVID environment.

04:58:35.282 --> 04:58:38.625
and like severe hospitalized cause that makes no sense.

04:58:38.965 --> 04:58:47.733
And well, more importantly, it doesn't work, but it gives, it gives you the faulty signal that there's some ambiguity.

04:58:47.773 --> 04:58:52.417
I mean, I've seen this in the ivermectin data where the point is the studies vary.

04:58:52.617 --> 04:58:56.481
And if it takes you five days to get to the patient, then of course the signal is weak.

04:58:56.821 --> 04:59:15.558
And if you're giving insufficient drug and you're only giving it for one day and ivermectin... So in my correspondence with the agency advocating for an ivermectin-containing arm in the study, I had to write the section about the justification for mechanism of action of ivermectin.

04:59:16.739 --> 04:59:19.821
And just to illustrate the point... Did you hear that?

04:59:19.961 --> 04:59:21.082
Mechanism of action?

04:59:22.043 --> 04:59:29.047
Mechanism of action is something that he doesn't have, that Steve Kirsch doesn't have for an SSRI that crosses the blood-brain barrier.

04:59:29.607 --> 04:59:31.808
How does it protect you from a respiratory disease?

04:59:31.848 --> 04:59:32.548
Do you hear it?

04:59:39.832 --> 04:59:42.474
It doesn't want me to keep going or what?

04:59:45.295 --> 04:59:46.896
I don't know why it keeps dying like this.

04:59:54.213 --> 04:59:55.033
Super weird.

04:59:57.254 --> 04:59:58.634
I'm telling you, I'm not doing this.

04:59:58.674 --> 05:00:01.194
This is like something that Rumble's doing to me.

05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:25.011
They got a little ahead of them.

05:00:25.271 --> 05:00:26.332
We got a little ahead of them there.

05:00:26.372 --> 05:00:26.993
Sorry about that.

05:00:29.054 --> 05:00:30.776
Rumble just isn't helping me.

05:00:30.956 --> 05:00:32.517
Why isn't rumble helping me?

05:00:32.537 --> 05:00:38.042
I mean, I'm pushing rumble here.

05:00:38.122 --> 05:00:39.644
You should be helping me rumble.

05:00:43.046 --> 05:00:44.548
Come on, come on.

05:00:44.588 --> 05:00:47.991
We just crossed the five hour mark and now I can't get this to work anymore.

05:01:03.617 --> 05:01:05.150
Me, not so happy.

05:01:21.994 --> 05:01:24.095
goes up concentrating in bone marrow.

05:01:24.635 --> 05:01:27.737
And we're just going to start in here because we skipped like three minutes.

05:01:28.077 --> 05:01:35.540
I'm not saying this is going to happen, but I'm saying we need to look for something like leukemias showing up here because of their creation in bone marrow.

05:01:36.021 --> 05:01:43.064
I know from other work that it also seems to show up preferentially in lymph nodes.

05:01:43.764 --> 05:01:48.306
which raises the question of whether or not lymphomas might be created.

05:01:48.646 --> 05:01:57.629
In any case, these are possible long-term effects that we have no way of knowing don't arise because these things have not been injected into people for more than a year.

05:01:57.809 --> 05:02:05.892
So we have two adverse event signals that are starting to become apparent, my friends at the FDA tell me.

05:02:06.561 --> 05:02:06.821
Okay.

05:02:07.001 --> 05:02:11.043
Keep saying his friends at the FDA that are relevant to what you're saying.

05:02:11.463 --> 05:02:12.644
You're focusing on bone marrow.

05:02:13.324 --> 05:02:26.670
So typically a plastic anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, those kinds of things might, if, if there are is going to be, is going to be a signal, we might see it six months, three years, nine years.

05:02:26.690 --> 05:02:27.450
Okay.

05:02:27.690 --> 05:02:28.151
Card to tell.

05:02:30.435 --> 05:02:31.958
Well, isn't that just nice?

05:02:33.101 --> 05:02:34.183
Isn't that just nice?

05:02:34.263 --> 05:02:37.771
The cancers that John Bodeman are finding is just the tip of the iceberg.

05:02:38.814 --> 05:02:45.116
that we need to wait a few years before some of these more complicated bone marrow cancers will show up in symptomology.

05:02:46.016 --> 05:02:46.856
Oh joy.

05:02:46.876 --> 05:02:48.877
Fires multiple mutations.

05:02:48.897 --> 05:02:49.177
Yep.

05:02:49.197 --> 05:02:49.457
Okay.

05:02:49.517 --> 05:02:51.357
So, so let's just park that.

05:02:51.477 --> 05:02:51.997
Yeah.

05:02:52.157 --> 05:02:52.878
It is a risk.

05:02:53.018 --> 05:02:54.538
It is a risk that should be monitored.

05:02:54.578 --> 05:02:55.098
Well, wait a second.

05:02:55.158 --> 05:02:58.999
You said, you said somebody is beginning to see a signal of something, but I didn't get what it was.

05:02:59.039 --> 05:02:59.259
Yeah.

05:02:59.299 --> 05:03:00.220
So I was going to get into that.

05:03:00.280 --> 05:03:01.040
Okay.

05:03:01.180 --> 05:03:05.121
There's two signals that are starting to in,

05:03:06.502 --> 05:03:11.549
We don't have time to go into the nuance of how come it takes so long for them to figure out what's going on.

05:03:11.989 --> 05:03:18.899
But one of them is thrombocytopenia, that's not having the platelets.

05:03:19.252 --> 05:03:44.836
His hands could also be swollen from the gout he supposedly has because when I shook his hand at the CHD meeting in Knoxville and he jerked his hand away and said he didn't know who I was and that he didn't introduce me to RFK and then walked away from me, his wife later told me that he had gout and that maybe I had just hurt his hand when I shook his hand with my very delicate man hands.

05:03:46.241 --> 05:03:52.387
I'm not shoveling stalls all day, so I have very delicate man hands.

05:03:52.907 --> 05:03:55.430
But when I shook his hand, I heard it.

05:03:56.951 --> 05:03:58.052
Because he's got gout.

05:03:59.814 --> 05:04:01.576
Which are manufactured in the bone marrow.

05:04:01.956 --> 05:04:04.418
Could be true, I don't know, it could be true.

05:04:06.613 --> 05:04:09.214
But I see him shake a lot of other people's hands without pain.

05:04:09.434 --> 05:04:14.656
Another one that is very hard to understand that's starting to come up in the database.

05:04:14.716 --> 05:04:18.078
I wonder if he'll remember me on Wednesday when we see each other in Boston.

05:04:18.831 --> 05:04:23.414
Okay, so this is shingles, shingles is an example of that, but there are many others.

05:04:23.474 --> 05:04:28.918
And there's something in the literature about reactivation of human, latent human retroviruses.

05:04:30.139 --> 05:04:47.051
Okay, so it is, there are anomalous findings cropping up and I concur that it was when I received these data to evaluate,

05:04:49.102 --> 05:04:50.282
I gave you that whole story.

05:04:50.302 --> 05:04:51.403
Okay?

05:04:52.083 --> 05:04:53.143
Those are two of the things.

05:04:53.343 --> 05:05:00.727
And by the way, what's really odd to me about the ovarian signal is there's no signal in the testis.

05:05:01.667 --> 05:05:01.847
Right.

05:05:02.248 --> 05:05:02.768
It's very low.

05:05:02.928 --> 05:05:10.331
And a colleague of mine, Dr. Kevin Tamera, has done a lot of thinking and reading about that because it bothers him too.

05:05:10.791 --> 05:05:14.733
He's a urologist, so he kind of specializes in the male reproductive system.

05:05:15.494 --> 05:05:16.294
And he has some

05:05:18.969 --> 05:05:21.832
Gosh darn Rumble.

05:05:24.294 --> 05:05:26.496
Rumble is not going to let me finish this video.

05:05:28.318 --> 05:05:29.239
What is happening here?

05:05:29.279 --> 05:05:31.121
Maybe I should pull it up on my other computer.

05:05:31.161 --> 05:05:32.622
Maybe I can double team this thing.

05:05:55.546 --> 05:05:56.727
No, Rumble's really mad.

05:05:58.048 --> 05:05:59.709
It's not playing on this computer either.

05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:03.511
This computer's hard-lined and it's not playing either.

05:06:03.551 --> 05:06:05.252
I think they're slowing me down.

05:06:05.572 --> 05:06:07.133
I gotta be really honest with you.

05:06:07.153 --> 05:06:11.396
I think they're stopping me from doing this because I'm just crushing them right now.

05:06:12.897 --> 05:06:16.639
And they can't do anything about it except for stop the video from playing.

05:06:16.719 --> 05:06:19.161
Otherwise, I got another hour of these clowns.

05:06:21.142 --> 05:06:24.324
I mean, what is the other explanation for the reason why this is not working?

05:06:30.646 --> 05:06:49.318
So there are anomalous findings cropping up, and I concur that it was when I received these data to evaluate, I gave you that whole story.

05:06:51.154 --> 05:06:52.194
Those are two of the things.

05:06:52.394 --> 05:06:59.778
And by the way, what's really odd to me about the ovarian signal is there's no signal in the testis.

05:07:00.719 --> 05:07:00.899
Right.

05:07:01.299 --> 05:07:01.819
It's very low.

05:07:01.979 --> 05:07:09.343
And a colleague of mine, Dr. Kevin Tamera, has done a lot of thinking and reading about that because it bothers him too.

05:07:09.363 --> 05:07:13.746
He's a urologist, so he kind of specializes in the male reproductive system.

05:07:14.526 --> 05:07:19.270
And he has some theories having to do with charge, because these are charged lipids.

05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:31.118
So there are particular features of the ovary that may, as opposed to the testis, that may explain some of this, but it doesn't get us away from the two core things.

05:07:31.379 --> 05:07:31.839
Number one,

05:07:33.570 --> 05:07:36.072
This was known with the original data packages.

05:07:36.152 --> 05:07:39.955
The Japanese data package is essentially a historic document.

05:07:40.596 --> 05:07:43.017
It's different from what the FDA is currently looking at.

05:07:43.138 --> 05:07:45.639
So these data have been out there a long time.

05:07:46.280 --> 05:07:47.541
And yes, we have a whole lot of messaging.

05:07:47.581 --> 05:07:48.662
But not in public view.

05:07:49.706 --> 05:08:00.815
within the purview, the confidential, protected, not disclosed purview of the regulators across the world.

05:08:00.955 --> 05:08:06.139
So this messaging that we're all good, nothing to worry about.

05:08:06.759 --> 05:08:11.363
That messaging was inconsistent with these signals that were apparent, at least inside of the data.

05:08:11.443 --> 05:08:12.964
The data or the data?

05:08:13.084 --> 05:08:13.265
Yeah.

05:08:13.705 --> 05:08:13.885
Okay.

05:08:15.606 --> 05:08:19.809
We've got potential long-term, we've got short-term implications in the bone marrow.

05:08:19.869 --> 05:08:22.390
We've got potential long-term implications in the bone marrow.

05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:24.311
We have short-term implications in the ovaries.

05:08:24.351 --> 05:08:26.012
We've got potential long-term implications.

05:08:26.412 --> 05:08:33.296
I would add to the list what I've been worried about most from the beginning are autoimmune disorders that might show up in the long run.

05:08:33.857 --> 05:08:35.979
Is that plausible as you see it?

05:08:36.580 --> 05:08:38.181
We talked about this earlier.

05:08:38.201 --> 05:08:46.369
And for me, it's less the lipid component, although that certainly has merit for autoimmune.

05:08:47.109 --> 05:08:51.373
It's more the circulating free spike protein, which we didn't expect.

05:08:51.694 --> 05:08:57.019
And in the literature, the developers assured us this would not happen.

05:08:57.099 --> 05:08:59.561
The literature suggested we would not have free spike.

05:08:59.881 --> 05:09:08.204
There we go again, we're talking about spike protein being free and so some mistake being made in the manufacturing process or an assumption being made that was incorrect.

05:09:08.824 --> 05:09:14.166
And then Harvard and Brigham did a study in nurses and lo and behold, we clearly have free spike after vaccination.

05:09:14.666 --> 05:09:17.847
And that has a whole other set of implications, but autoimmune

05:09:18.789 --> 05:09:27.516
development of autoimmune disease against complexes of foreign protein plus normal human proteins is certainly something that you'd have to monitor for.

05:09:27.916 --> 05:09:32.180
As we were discussing, the way that that's... That was very well said.

05:09:32.280 --> 05:09:39.605
Complexes made with viral proteins and self proteins can cause autoimmunity.

05:09:39.646 --> 05:09:40.886
That's exactly

05:09:41.877 --> 05:09:44.439
what Michael Eden and I have been arguing for three years.

05:09:44.479 --> 05:09:49.182
So it's nice to hear him say it in the midst of this three and a half hour word salad.

05:09:50.163 --> 05:10:02.491
Part of the reason why you typically want a two to three year follow up period on the initial group of phase three patients to make sure that autoimmune consequences don't develop because they typically take time.

05:10:02.791 --> 05:10:02.911
Right.

05:10:02.951 --> 05:10:08.672
And this is why, you know, they always say that there's no such thing as a vaccine that was, that has developed fast.

05:10:08.852 --> 05:10:12.173
You know, like the fastest we've ever developed a vaccine has been like, what?

05:10:12.233 --> 05:10:13.553
So it's really weird, right?

05:10:13.573 --> 05:10:27.296
That Robert, or that, that, that on a podcast with Robert Malone, almost a year after this in Bath, the UK, they're sitting on a, on a, on a couch and Brett Weinstein says,

05:10:31.098 --> 05:10:33.520
He says, what is this?

05:10:33.900 --> 05:10:34.660
What is this?

05:10:35.961 --> 05:10:40.224
He says, why is this not going away?

05:10:42.165 --> 05:10:42.885
What does he say?

05:10:42.965 --> 05:10:44.386
I mean, I'm being serious here.

05:10:44.426 --> 05:10:46.067
There's something here.

05:10:47.448 --> 05:10:49.089
I've got it clipped up, listen.

05:10:52.250 --> 05:10:58.311
Listen, I'll pause you because I advanced a hypothesis on dark horse, which is now just come right back up.

05:10:58.331 --> 05:11:01.152
So I want to catch people up and then I want you to pick up your explanation.

05:11:01.612 --> 05:11:10.113
So what I argued, and I, I believe I came up with this independently, but I believe Peter McCullough has mentioned something similar as has Jonathan Cooley.

05:11:10.394 --> 05:11:16.055
So what he's going to say there really interestingly is, is what Mike Eden says here.

05:11:16.195 --> 05:11:17.575
And what I've said before.

05:11:19.844 --> 05:11:25.708
which is that the transfection of a spike protein can cause an autoimmune reaction.

05:11:27.929 --> 05:11:33.873
And more than a year before that, here's Robert Malone saying it on his podcast.

05:11:34.013 --> 05:11:39.716
And yet still, Brett Weinstein says that I came up with this on my own.

05:11:44.199 --> 05:11:45.460
And Robert doesn't correct him.

05:11:47.612 --> 05:11:50.093
Robert is leading a narrative.

05:11:50.133 --> 05:11:52.774
He's making sure that everybody stays on point.

05:11:53.894 --> 05:11:56.655
So if you claim it's you, that's all the better.

05:11:58.215 --> 05:12:00.356
If you say it was Jay, that's all the better.

05:12:00.856 --> 05:12:07.758
Keep everybody on message and encourage them to focus on the shot and not on the virus.

05:12:07.878 --> 05:12:09.319
Not on the gain of function.

05:12:09.419 --> 05:12:10.759
Assume that's all real.

05:12:11.780 --> 05:12:15.921
Keep them focused on the transfection and what the transfection might do.

05:12:17.441 --> 05:12:18.522
That's what was done to us.

05:12:18.562 --> 05:12:21.086
Prefer to stay out of the public eye and they've done that.

05:12:21.126 --> 05:12:24.250
But I took this position because I feel very strongly.

05:12:24.730 --> 05:12:26.312
Easy, easy, easy.

05:12:26.432 --> 05:12:29.136
Nobody said we wanted you to keep talking there.

05:12:29.576 --> 05:12:29.817
Okay.

05:12:29.837 --> 05:12:30.157
Here we go.

05:12:30.738 --> 05:12:31.719
Seven years or.

05:12:32.360 --> 05:12:36.305
Yeah, probably if we, unless we go back mid century when things were loose and fast.

05:12:36.445 --> 05:12:37.586
Right, but there's a reason for that.

05:12:37.626 --> 05:12:41.890
It's not just that, OK, well, we have better technology now.

05:12:42.210 --> 05:12:45.893
We still need to be able to see what the long-term effects is on a 12-year-old.

05:12:45.913 --> 05:12:46.874
You can't fast-forward time.

05:12:46.934 --> 05:12:49.416
And in fact, usually you use animal models to do that.

05:12:49.476 --> 05:12:52.519
And the assumptions on which the animal models bring these things to light are faulty.

05:12:52.759 --> 05:12:56.240
Right, and how do you judge the effect on the 12-year-old?

05:12:56.280 --> 05:13:03.243
What the animal models give us is a signal that alerts us to things that we need to follow up on carefully in humans.

05:13:03.323 --> 05:13:04.783
Okay, so hold on.

05:13:05.323 --> 05:13:11.465
Unless that signal is of toxicity or autoimmunity and then you don't need to follow up on it, you just don't do it.

05:13:12.806 --> 05:13:15.607
Again, we're clouding the waters here.

05:13:15.667 --> 05:13:17.588
We're muddying the waters here.

05:13:17.608 --> 05:13:19.968
We're making it worse for people to understand.

05:13:20.008 --> 05:13:21.469
There's no gray area here.

05:13:22.901 --> 05:13:27.483
If an animal model shows toxicity or autoimmunity, you don't try it in humans.

05:13:29.024 --> 05:13:32.965
That's not what Robert Malone is arguing in this long little thing here.

05:13:33.005 --> 05:13:37.787
He's arguing that mice and monkeys don't tell us anything about what's in humans.

05:13:38.407 --> 05:13:42.189
So the only way to test it in humans is to do a meta-analysis, he said.

05:13:46.092 --> 05:14:02.243
I don't think you can underestimate the extent to which this single podcast bamboozled so many people, including myself, into believing a laboratory leak was being covered up and that a imperfect transfection was being used to counteract it.

05:14:04.266 --> 05:14:13.890
and that was soon to be sold as a serendipitous consequence of the pandemic that these transfections are working, except, well, you know, we didn't get the batches right and the spike protein was toxic.

05:14:13.970 --> 05:14:19.793
Just to make this segment clear, OK, we've got very alarming short-term stuff.

05:14:20.313 --> 05:14:27.920
We've got short-term stuff that is alarming on the basis of where we find these lipids, where we find the spike proteins.

05:14:28.140 --> 05:14:31.563
Those things are reasons for concern because it wasn't supposed to be this way.

05:14:32.064 --> 05:14:38.089
We've also got an alarming signal in terms of the hazards and deaths or the harms and the deaths that are reported in the system.

05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:40.892
And there's a reason to think that those are dramatic under-reports.

05:14:40.972 --> 05:14:43.575
Yes, and they're all consistent with the spike distribution.

05:14:43.595 --> 05:14:46.137
That's two parts of the harm equation.

05:14:46.317 --> 05:14:50.819
Okay, the harm equation involves, there appears to be short-term harm being done at an alarming level.

05:14:51.159 --> 05:14:58.642
Long-term harm is quite plausible based on what we already know about what's taking place, but we, of course, are going to take time to figure out whether it's actually manifest.

05:14:58.662 --> 05:15:00.283
To find out and then it's going to be too late.

05:15:00.303 --> 05:15:02.344
You can vaccinate yourself, but you can never unvaccinate.

05:15:02.364 --> 05:15:03.264
You can't unvaccinate.

05:15:03.604 --> 05:15:08.106
Okay, so then there are two other harms that are potentially involved in this vaccine.

05:15:08.126 --> 05:15:13.469
I wanted to get your input on whether it's worth worrying about these things.

05:15:14.469 --> 05:15:28.441
One of them, as made famous by Garrett Vandenbosch, who was a guest on this program, is the hazard of the vaccines because they create a very concentrated evolutionary push on spike protein alone.

05:15:29.742 --> 05:15:34.787
Vaccinating into a pandemic rather than in advance of the pandemic is like... Here it comes.

05:15:35.667 --> 05:15:37.029
The transfection works.

05:15:38.112 --> 05:15:46.534
Spike protein is produced, it goes into circulation and puts a very pinpoint immune pressure on the virus.

05:15:47.255 --> 05:15:54.777
Exactly the story that Herod von den Bosch is selling on Amazon for $35 a book right now.

05:15:56.077 --> 05:16:05.220
A nonsense story about transfection being able to put pinpoint immune pressure on the virus to cause

05:16:07.617 --> 05:16:19.787
Immune re, immune refocusing is what, what cared, cared funding Bosch has as a new, new term, immune refocusing.

05:16:20.608 --> 05:16:24.311
And you can buy his Amazon book for 35 bucks and find out what he means.

05:16:24.891 --> 05:16:30.776
Able to cause the evolution of escape mutants and that it could in fact make a much worse pandemic in the end.

05:16:31.476 --> 05:16:35.079
So this isn't a theoretical, this is a real, it's real.

05:16:35.119 --> 05:16:35.940
We already have the data.

05:16:36.640 --> 05:16:37.181
What does that mean?

05:16:38.629 --> 05:16:41.952
We are having escape mutants arise all over the place.

05:16:42.212 --> 05:16:42.373
Yep.

05:16:42.713 --> 05:16:45.135
And you believe it is caused by the vaccines?

05:16:45.495 --> 05:16:46.856
So I can't, I can't.

05:16:47.036 --> 05:16:51.660
So because we've got two variables going on at the same time, we've got vaccination and we've got natural infection.

05:16:51.840 --> 05:16:52.001
Yeah.

05:16:52.861 --> 05:16:58.266
But in my mind, I mean, the data, the, the, the data are in.

05:16:59.046 --> 05:16:59.967
Yep.

05:17:00.287 --> 05:17:00.728
The escape.

05:17:00.748 --> 05:17:03.150
The data are in, the escape mutants are there.

05:17:04.537 --> 05:17:10.165
The escape mutants, the dangerous variants are there.

05:17:10.306 --> 05:17:12.248
This is all narrative, guys.

05:17:12.529 --> 05:17:13.891
Mutants are happening, yeah.

05:17:19.955 --> 05:17:29.404
We have focused on the spike domains that are associated with escape from the vaccine domains.

05:17:30.605 --> 05:17:36.671
We have neglected to focus as a community on the other mutations that are also accumulating.

05:17:38.633 --> 05:17:48.420
So that's kind of a sampling or selection bias that we have ongoing because we're focused on the vaccines, but it's not the only thing that's changing.

05:17:49.781 --> 05:17:52.743
You mentioned HIV, super example.

05:17:53.644 --> 05:17:56.948
HIV evolves during its infection of each separate patient.

05:17:57.689 --> 05:17:59.891
Single-stranded RNA.

05:17:59.951 --> 05:18:12.825
As a virologist, and there's some veterinary virologists that are speaking about this too, that this is, for those of us who are hardcore virologists and vaccinologists,

05:18:13.786 --> 05:18:15.727
This is accepted wisdom.

05:18:16.428 --> 05:18:17.669
This is just the way things are.

05:18:20.711 --> 05:18:23.293
This kind of gets to my point that I made earlier.

05:18:23.313 --> 05:18:29.717
We're focused on the vaccines, but it's not the only thing that's changing.

05:18:30.198 --> 05:18:33.160
You mentioned HIV, super example.

05:18:34.100 --> 05:18:37.441
HIV evolves during its infection of each separate patient.

05:18:38.101 --> 05:18:39.542
Single-stranded RNA.

05:18:39.662 --> 05:18:47.684
So as a virologist, and there's some veterinary virologists that are speaking about this too.

05:18:47.864 --> 05:18:51.445
Veterinary virologists speaking out about this would be here at VandenBosch.

05:18:51.485 --> 05:18:54.006
He's queuing him up right now just so you know what's going on.

05:18:55.726 --> 05:19:02.790
For those of us who are hardcore virologists and vaccinologists, this is accepted wisdom.

05:19:03.490 --> 05:19:07.112
This is just the way things are.

05:19:07.412 --> 05:19:11.034
And this kind of gets to my point that I made earlier.

05:19:11.054 --> 05:19:12.775
I objected a little bit to some of the statements.

05:19:13.435 --> 05:19:21.540
In my opinion, we're stuck with this virus or its downstream variants pretty much for the rest of our lives.

05:19:21.900 --> 05:19:23.281
For the rest of our lives.

05:19:25.342 --> 05:19:28.770
for the rest of our lives, for the rest of our lives.

05:19:35.433 --> 05:19:41.677
We're stuck with this virus or its downstream variants pretty much for the rest of our lives.

05:19:43.018 --> 05:19:45.439
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

05:19:45.459 --> 05:19:46.299
I believe that that is inescapable.

05:19:46.339 --> 05:19:48.421
Well, so I would argue, based on what I understand,

05:19:59.247 --> 05:20:01.209
that that might happen.

05:20:01.649 --> 05:20:09.935
I've worried about it from the beginning, that the likelihood of it happening has to do with the fact that we botched the early response and therefore gave it a large canvas in which to experiment.

05:20:09.976 --> 05:20:11.557
Yeah, a large canvas.

05:20:11.657 --> 05:20:12.978
It's all Trump's fault.

05:20:13.038 --> 05:20:14.279
We blew it in the beginning.

05:20:14.339 --> 05:20:16.220
We should have locked down harder, right?

05:20:16.621 --> 05:20:25.007
I don't, I haven't seen anything yet that tells me that we couldn't, if we got on this now, that we couldn't stamp it out in two months, three months of concerted effort.

05:20:25.027 --> 05:20:28.410
Except for the experience of actually trying to do that with polio and smallpox.

05:20:30.854 --> 05:20:32.055
I don't know what to say here.

05:20:32.095 --> 05:20:35.416
My whole computer is just freaking out and I don't get it.

05:20:35.536 --> 05:20:41.639
I don't know why it's freaking out, but this computer is definitely having some issues here.

05:20:45.221 --> 05:20:46.081
And I don't get it.

05:20:46.141 --> 05:20:46.901
We are at 231.

05:20:48.822 --> 05:20:54.045
Oh man, you're killing me. 231.

05:21:05.655 --> 05:21:12.122
stuff that sticks to other stuff, but it can stick in a way that actually enhances the infectivity, right?

05:21:12.462 --> 05:21:23.093
So, the fact that we don't control what happens after we introduce the immune system to the antigen, and that the evolution can produce things with unpredictable effects, can result in exactly the opposite.

05:21:23.133 --> 05:21:25.515
And in fact, this is not just a theoretical possibility.

05:21:25.555 --> 05:21:28.679
This is something we've actually seen, and I believe we've seen it with mRNA

05:21:29.379 --> 05:21:32.540
Vaccines Okay, so is that right?

05:21:33.541 --> 05:21:36.082
So there haven't been any mRNA vaccines and other creatures.

05:21:36.182 --> 05:21:45.085
We are the first creatures that is being tried to there's just that okay, okay, okay, but What you're talking about did Brett really not know that?

05:21:46.326 --> 05:21:51.087
That's not even possible Is it possible that he's so irresponsible.

05:21:51.127 --> 05:21:52.648
He didn't even know the answer to that.

05:21:52.668 --> 05:21:54.729
I mean, come on Brett really

05:21:55.689 --> 05:21:56.450
Come on.

05:21:57.310 --> 05:22:07.938
Um, when I, so we've been writing and trying to get published papers about this, uh, kind of from the beginning, I think her father was British intelligence, not CIA.

05:22:08.038 --> 05:22:09.739
It's not purely theoretical.

05:22:10.259 --> 05:22:12.901
Um, it is the basis for dengue hemorrhagic fever.

05:22:12.921 --> 05:22:13.882
Okay.

05:22:13.942 --> 05:22:15.603
So it's not what he's talking about.

05:22:15.623 --> 05:22:18.806
Isn't something that he's just come up with out of his mind.

05:22:19.306 --> 05:22:23.529
Um, it's, it's a, it's actually the basis for one of the major viral diseases.

05:22:23.749 --> 05:22:26.030
So is this why the second bout of dengue is worse?

05:22:26.370 --> 05:22:31.233
That is precisely it, especially it has to be a different strain and, and it is a whole.

05:22:31.793 --> 05:22:40.038
So he didn't even bother to do due diligence to read that by the time we got to September of 2021, he's been online for a year.

05:22:41.238 --> 05:22:46.361
Daily or weekly talking about the pandemic and he didn't bother to read about dengue fever.

05:22:51.581 --> 05:23:02.625
I mean, Bret Weinstein is one of the biggest posers of all time, pretending to be this preeminent biologist with this polymath-like knowledge, and it's really a joke.

05:23:03.525 --> 05:23:06.706
I'm sorry, but it's really, really a joke.

05:23:10.469 --> 05:23:19.220
It's a lovely, if you wanna understand the interaction of virology and immunology, dengue is a super way to dive into that world.

05:23:19.881 --> 05:23:25.468
But one of the nuances that you almost got to,

05:23:30.461 --> 05:23:32.262
So I'm going to go to my metaphor of the fork.

05:23:33.423 --> 05:23:39.967
And so the tines of a fork, if you think about that, are akin to the sticky part of the antibody that he's talking about.

05:23:40.347 --> 05:23:42.749
But the fork has a tail, the handle that we hold on to.

05:23:43.669 --> 05:23:45.811
That tail is not there just for nothing.

05:23:46.727 --> 05:23:50.609
That tail has its own cool, evolved, neat stuff that it does.

05:23:52.409 --> 05:23:57.171
And one of the things that it does is it sticks to specific evolved receptors.

05:23:57.411 --> 05:24:02.553
It's called the FC region because it's the constant region of the antibody.

05:24:02.913 --> 05:24:05.815
The tines are variable, as you say.

05:24:07.335 --> 05:24:11.597
So the part that sticks out has a receptor that it binds to.

05:24:13.767 --> 05:24:29.500
That receptor is present in cells that normally can't be infected by this virus, dendritic cells and macrophage, which, by the way, go to lymph nodes and travel around all over the body and are totally central to our ability to generate an immune response.

05:24:30.861 --> 05:24:36.525
And one of the things that happens… Nice to mention that at 2 hours and 36 in there, Robert.

05:24:38.638 --> 05:24:54.709
with certain types, because there are different types of antibody-dependent enhancement, but the word, antibody, so that's the fork, dependent, this won't happen without it, enhancement, what is being enhanced?

05:24:55.469 --> 05:24:58.892
What's being enhanced is infection and virus replication.

05:24:59.092 --> 05:25:00.152
How is that happening?

05:25:00.553 --> 05:25:02.374
How is the presence of an antibody

05:25:03.587 --> 05:25:08.169
increasing the ability of the virus to infect something else when it's blocking the virus.

05:25:08.669 --> 05:25:26.415
Because what happens is that essentially that handle of the fork can now interact with the FC receptors on macrophaged dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells and enable that virus to come into those cells that would normally not be able to infect.

05:25:27.235 --> 05:25:29.576
And those cells travel all over the body.

05:25:29.596 --> 05:25:30.596
These are immune cells.

05:25:31.052 --> 05:25:34.053
These are the cells responsible for presenting antigen.

05:25:34.093 --> 05:25:52.399
And so what you have happened with antibody-dependent enhancement is you can get an explosive increase, not only in virus replication, but in activation of inflammatory responses, which happens about seven days after the infection.

05:25:52.439 --> 05:25:53.039
And all of the prior vaccines

05:25:57.421 --> 05:26:08.763
that have been developed largely for veterinary purposes and all of the prior attempts to develop human coronavirus vaccines have failed due to ADE.

05:26:09.023 --> 05:26:11.404
That's one of the things that's really interesting.

05:26:12.324 --> 05:26:19.485
Really interesting about the current ones is they are showing so much efficacy.

05:26:19.685 --> 05:26:22.226
It's the reason why I wouldn't take vaccine for a long time.

05:26:23.345 --> 05:26:25.586
is I was watching for an ADE signal.

05:26:25.726 --> 05:26:26.586
I'm not seeing it.

05:26:27.466 --> 05:26:28.626
We're all looking for it.

05:26:29.226 --> 05:26:31.807
And we're not seeing it.

05:26:32.147 --> 05:26:34.268
We're not seeing an ADE signal, huh?

05:26:35.668 --> 05:26:37.528
Anti-interferon antibodies.

05:26:39.289 --> 05:26:40.109
We're not seeing it.

05:26:40.509 --> 05:26:41.529
He's just full of it.

05:26:41.929 --> 05:26:43.410
Everywhere we've looked, we've found it.

05:26:45.190 --> 05:26:47.991
And more importantly, if you don't look, you don't find it.

05:26:49.096 --> 05:27:01.608
and emphasizing that antibody-dependent enhancement is the primary thing he was concerned about and not the globs of self and viral proteins that could cause autoimmunity three years from now.

05:27:02.208 --> 05:27:03.650
What is he talking about?

05:27:05.069 --> 05:27:07.270
He was worried about antibody-dependent enhancement.

05:27:07.290 --> 05:27:26.198
He was watching for those signals, but he wasn't worried about any of the other things that come along with transfection, like autoimmunity that could show up as cancer in the bone marrow three years from his injection that he was just talking about a few minutes ago, but now says, my main concern was antibody-dependent enhancement.

05:27:26.758 --> 05:27:28.979
Holy balls is this nonsense.

05:27:29.439 --> 05:27:30.120
Get vaccinated.

05:27:31.080 --> 05:27:33.761
See, I got vaccinated because I didn't know any of this.

05:27:34.422 --> 05:27:37.283
I assumed that what I was being told is the truth.

05:27:37.503 --> 05:27:43.086
Nobody was dying and everything was safe and it was safe and effective that I was told that.

05:27:43.186 --> 05:27:48.208
And I trusted the authorities and I, you know, was just like that.

05:27:48.248 --> 05:27:54.711
And then when I discovered, you know, my little, you know, you know, popped up and is he pissed?

05:27:55.828 --> 05:27:57.049
Because I would be pissed.

05:27:58.609 --> 05:28:07.653
It doesn't really seem like Steve is pissed that he injected his children with something he should have never injected his children with, that this guy didn't warn him early enough.

05:28:09.014 --> 05:28:12.355
This guy didn't warn him early enough, that's why he took it.

05:28:13.635 --> 05:28:15.076
Why isn't he pissed about that?

05:28:16.697 --> 05:28:21.759
Why doesn't he hear the incongruency that's sitting across the table from him at all?

05:28:23.240 --> 05:28:25.602
discovered, wow, confirmation of my hypothesis.

05:28:25.702 --> 05:28:27.243
You took the red pill and suddenly.

05:28:27.303 --> 05:28:29.044
Yeah, well, no, I've always had the red pill.

05:28:30.905 --> 05:28:35.268
But on this one, I said, there's only so much you can question, right?

05:28:35.508 --> 05:28:40.392
And when has the CDC ever misled us and the NIH ever misled us?

05:28:40.412 --> 05:28:41.592
So I can't blame ignorance.

05:28:41.632 --> 05:28:42.953
I'm a bona fide expert, right?

05:28:43.254 --> 05:28:43.674
Right, right.

05:28:43.694 --> 05:28:44.414
So how did you?

05:28:44.454 --> 05:28:47.396
Well, we didn't know about the biodistribution.

05:28:47.436 --> 05:28:48.617
We didn't know about the free.

05:28:48.657 --> 05:28:49.478
It's so funny.

05:28:50.078 --> 05:28:54.360
It's so funny how I took a transfection I should have never taken, because I'm an expert.

05:28:54.420 --> 05:28:55.361
I should have known better.

05:28:55.401 --> 05:28:56.821
It's so funny, isn't it?

05:28:56.961 --> 05:28:58.682
It's so funny.

05:28:58.922 --> 05:29:00.843
About the pathogenics?

05:29:00.883 --> 05:29:01.944
So why did I take the vaccine?

05:29:02.004 --> 05:29:03.424
Yeah, why did you?

05:29:03.824 --> 05:29:04.265
Two reasons.

05:29:04.745 --> 05:29:05.625
Admit it.

05:29:06.226 --> 05:29:07.826
I'm finally on the spot here.

05:29:07.886 --> 05:29:11.708
No, I'm totally transparent about it and have been in multiple other podcasts and online.

05:29:12.588 --> 05:29:13.349
There's two reasons.

05:29:13.929 --> 05:29:15.750
And I waited.

05:29:16.752 --> 05:29:28.398
I would not get involved early on, um, because I, I knew that it was going to take time for the ADE signal to either be proven or not revealed.

05:29:28.758 --> 05:29:28.958
Yeah.

05:29:29.298 --> 05:29:29.598
Okay.

05:29:30.198 --> 05:29:33.080
So I came to the conclusion, it's been enough time.

05:29:33.240 --> 05:29:33.660
We're not.

05:29:34.000 --> 05:29:38.382
The only thing he was concerned about was ADE, nothing else.

05:29:38.522 --> 05:29:41.484
He's saying that right now, hear him.

05:29:43.208 --> 05:29:53.992
Hear him tell you that none of the other concerns that they've been talking about for the last hour were on his radar as he decided to take two shots in the Moderna vaccine.

05:29:55.593 --> 05:29:56.633
He wanted acceptance.

05:29:57.194 --> 05:29:58.534
He wanted to be able to travel.

05:30:00.595 --> 05:30:03.996
This is just the biggest ball of nonsense I've ever heard in my life.

05:30:04.076 --> 05:30:07.678
And I agree totally with the Breggins that this guy's pulling the wool over our eyes.

05:30:07.718 --> 05:30:08.338
He's gotta be.

05:30:10.831 --> 05:30:14.534
This is just one great big gigantic pile of nonsense.

05:30:16.075 --> 05:30:17.056
I don't know what he's up to.

05:30:19.378 --> 05:30:21.840
But oh man, this is really something special to me.

05:30:23.861 --> 05:30:28.605
The idea that he's suing the Breggans while he did this and said these words.

05:30:31.112 --> 05:30:35.154
Did this whole podcast, we could watch it over and over and over again.

05:30:35.214 --> 05:30:48.260
It'll only become more and more clear how absurd it is that he sits where he sits right now in the eyes of so many people as some kind of knight in shining armor.

05:30:49.280 --> 05:30:49.901
What a joke.

05:30:51.261 --> 05:30:52.922
Seeing the 80s E signal.

05:30:53.823 --> 05:30:56.044
And I don't have to worry about that too much.

05:30:56.944 --> 05:30:58.165
Remember I'm a long COVID.

05:30:59.397 --> 05:31:05.302
there was a lot of reports popping up about vaccines helping with long COVID.

05:31:05.502 --> 05:31:11.327
And number two, I need to travel.

05:31:11.347 --> 05:31:16.531
And the rules that are emerging, particularly if you wanna go to Europe or offshore.

05:31:17.011 --> 05:31:27.260
The rules that are emerging that you might have to accept, the rules that are emerging that you might have to accept because these men aren't gonna keep their arms straight

05:31:29.738 --> 05:31:32.079
because these men aren't going to keep their arms straight.

05:31:32.139 --> 05:31:44.063
You might have to put up with these rules because these men aren't willing to stand up for those rules being against all forms of informed consent, against all previous principles of sovereignty.

05:31:44.103 --> 05:31:48.705
They're not going to stand up for that because these men aren't holding their arms straight.

05:31:49.821 --> 05:31:50.381
It's just crazy.

05:31:50.401 --> 05:31:52.463
You gotta have, well, it is what it is.

05:31:53.684 --> 05:31:55.805
I live in the real world and I need to travel.

05:31:56.185 --> 05:32:01.269
So the reason my wife and I both took vaccines, because she's also a vaccine expert.

05:32:02.110 --> 05:32:15.579
She's also a vaccine expert on the incorporation papers of Inovio, on Facebook saying that the technology and ideas of Robert Malone are saving the world.

05:32:16.701 --> 05:32:20.985
that the vaccine is working exactly as it expected, and it's saved millions of people.

05:32:22.446 --> 05:32:26.269
They're recommending that you take it now because the ADA signal is not there.

05:32:26.309 --> 05:32:30.272
It hasn't shown up yet, says Robert Malone on this podcast, so take the shot.

05:32:30.833 --> 05:32:33.935
I both took Moderna, the highest dose, right?

05:32:33.976 --> 05:32:37.899
The one, frankly, the one that I advise to everybody, don't take Moderna.

05:32:37.919 --> 05:32:39.400
If you're gonna take anything, take Pfizer.

05:32:39.900 --> 05:32:44.544
Okay, that's been my advice again and again, but it wasn't an option for me where I live in Virginia.

05:32:46.346 --> 05:32:48.288
By the way, what he's talking about is... So that's what I took.

05:32:48.508 --> 05:32:53.694
Yeah, they never did any dosing studies to find out whether they were overdosing.

05:32:54.054 --> 05:32:55.336
So hold on.

05:32:55.376 --> 05:32:57.118
I want to just collect our gains here, okay?

05:32:57.638 --> 05:33:01.422
We've got two kinds of harm to patients, short-term and long-term.

05:33:01.763 --> 05:33:03.044
Both of these are alarming.

05:33:03.404 --> 05:33:04.926
They're worrying from what we already know.

05:33:05.595 --> 05:33:18.582
You've got the possibility of the driving of escape mutants, for which we know that we were getting escape mutants, and we don't know to what degree that is responsive to the vaccine, but it's at least... I would speculate that Meryl Nass is beguiled by Robert Malone.

05:33:18.622 --> 05:33:21.424
I would speculate that she's just been fooled.

05:33:24.105 --> 05:33:28.808
She spent a lot of time with him and his wife, and they have a very good schtick.

05:33:29.770 --> 05:33:34.112
of fighting in front of people and being condescending to one another.

05:33:34.132 --> 05:33:38.855
And then it seems like they have this real marriage and it's almost embarrassing.

05:33:40.035 --> 05:33:51.421
And I've heard the story from too many people that if you're around the Malones long enough, you hear Robert talk very nasty to Jill, or you hear very, uh, court, uh, curt language with one another.

05:33:51.481 --> 05:33:53.802
And it's obvious that they're really just a married couple.

05:33:55.649 --> 05:34:06.400
And this level of trust that one gets when you think that they can't be lying is what I think Meryl has experienced.

05:34:06.440 --> 05:34:17.212
I think Meryl is just beguiled by someone who she is so, she's probably incapable of imagining that someone would lie to her so consistently and so often.

05:34:19.429 --> 05:34:25.692
And that's, I think, you know, what happens to everybody that gets beguiled by somebody who's a liar.

05:34:25.732 --> 05:34:27.973
I don't know what lies he's told.

05:34:28.033 --> 05:34:29.473
I don't know what lies he's telling.

05:34:29.974 --> 05:34:32.835
I just know that he's probably very skilled at it.

05:34:32.875 --> 05:34:37.157
Like he said that his friend Michael Callahan is also a very skilled liar.

05:34:39.018 --> 05:34:48.842
If he can say that Michael Callahan's a very skilled liar, I wonder if it's okay for me to hypothetically wax intellectual about how skilled of a liar Robert Malone might be.

05:34:51.488 --> 05:34:52.448
at least quite plausible.

05:34:52.728 --> 05:34:56.330
And then we have the risk of ADE, which it turns out we don't have the signal for.

05:34:56.370 --> 05:34:56.950
So that's good news.

05:34:56.970 --> 05:34:57.550
Yeah, currently.

05:34:57.690 --> 05:34:57.890
Yeah.

05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.550
So far.

05:34:59.051 --> 05:34:59.531
But that's great.

05:34:59.731 --> 05:35:00.231
Good news.

05:35:00.291 --> 05:35:00.531
No ADE.

05:35:00.591 --> 05:35:11.035
That's a pretty good encapsulation of worries in this neighborhood that are... The one that was unexpected is the coagulopathy associated with the adenovector.

05:35:11.755 --> 05:35:13.316
Holy cow, he did it again.

05:35:13.356 --> 05:35:14.376
The adenovector.

05:35:15.672 --> 05:35:43.116
adenovirus transformation that's the one that has coagulopathy not the mRNA the mRNA doesn't do that oh wait now it does this was an orchestrated calculated differential between those two at this time to try and make you think that them taking the Moderna was smart that the Moderna works that the Moderna is the pure one yada yada yada it's all

05:35:44.187 --> 05:35:45.928
fun and games with your brain here.

05:35:46.509 --> 05:35:47.389
That's what's happening.

05:35:47.969 --> 05:35:49.751
That one was out of the blue.

05:35:50.031 --> 05:35:57.335
So the coagulation problems, which are almost one of the central hallmarks of COVID disease.

05:35:57.495 --> 05:35:57.756
Right.

05:35:57.856 --> 05:36:01.138
So am I wrong to think that that's just more spike protein cytotoxicity?

05:36:01.498 --> 05:36:03.379
I think it's a plausible hypothesis.

05:36:03.479 --> 05:36:03.779
OK.

05:36:04.760 --> 05:36:05.020
All right.

05:36:06.101 --> 05:36:08.983
Which means, in English, that means he agrees.

05:36:09.537 --> 05:36:11.979
No, it means it's a plausible hypothesis.

05:36:12.019 --> 05:36:14.662
He's a scientist, he gets what I mean.

05:36:14.822 --> 05:36:16.583
I'm translating it for the non-scientists.

05:36:16.603 --> 05:36:24.951
It's a plausible hypothesis, and the tone in your voice suggested there's not another obvious, more plausible hypothesis.

05:36:25.612 --> 05:36:28.995
I think it is the most compelling current hypothesis that I know of.

05:36:29.295 --> 05:36:29.856
Yes, June 21.

05:36:30.596 --> 05:36:39.504
So I think we have taken care of the big pieces of the puzzle that I was hoping to hit aside from the one where we saved the earth from COVID.

05:36:41.245 --> 05:36:46.030
Are there things on your agenda that you... You wanted to talk a little more about the repro talks.

05:36:46.690 --> 05:36:46.990
Yes.

05:36:47.551 --> 05:36:48.511
Well, indeed.

05:36:48.751 --> 05:37:14.144
So we did it, but what should people be thinking about the fact that we at least know that it... So the thing that this signal about the relative concentration of these novel lipids that we've never had before in humans that we don't have long exposure to in animals and the signal in this limited rodent study

05:37:14.977 --> 05:37:18.862
Hopefully, which was not done under good laboratory practices.

05:37:19.723 --> 05:37:22.527
It wasn't the real vaccine.

05:37:22.687 --> 05:37:26.432
It wasn't even the RNA encoding spike.

05:37:26.532 --> 05:37:26.672
Right.

05:37:26.712 --> 05:37:31.419
And you couldn't, because you'd want to find out where the spike actually went.

05:37:32.620 --> 05:37:45.670
I spoke to, remember I spoke to the director of CBER about all this and he said, you know, that was then, we have a new data package now and please allow us the respect to evaluate it.

05:37:45.690 --> 05:37:46.811
Okay.

05:37:47.331 --> 05:37:53.135
And Peter Marks is, they said it again, that we've got a new data set.

05:37:53.175 --> 05:37:55.037
So give us the time to evaluate it.

05:37:55.057 --> 05:37:56.138
He's saying it again.

05:37:57.062 --> 05:38:01.924
He's leaving the door open for it working or for the data to say, Oh, it's okay.

05:38:02.385 --> 05:38:02.965
Do you hear it?

05:38:03.025 --> 05:38:03.865
Ladies and gentlemen.

05:38:06.266 --> 05:38:08.447
Among the best we have at the FDA.

05:38:08.467 --> 05:38:10.288
Okay.

05:38:10.448 --> 05:38:12.009
He's he's time-tested.

05:38:12.229 --> 05:38:12.889
He's smart.

05:38:13.490 --> 05:38:14.390
He has integrity.

05:38:15.010 --> 05:38:19.492
He asked me, he is saying that Jeremy Marks has integrity.

05:38:20.513 --> 05:38:24.615
The guy who pushed this vaccine all the way to six month old kids.

05:38:26.104 --> 05:38:28.465
He's saying, Jeremy Marks has integrity.

05:38:29.005 --> 05:38:30.265
Can you believe this?

05:38:30.886 --> 05:38:32.226
Can you believe this?

05:38:32.706 --> 05:38:34.107
Can you believe this?

05:38:35.247 --> 05:38:41.169
To allow them the respect to evaluate the product.

05:38:41.870 --> 05:38:43.930
And I think we've kind of got to give that.

05:38:44.210 --> 05:38:45.571
But if we go off the date.

05:38:45.591 --> 05:38:46.731
We've got to give it that.

05:38:46.791 --> 05:38:48.272
We've got to give them six months.

05:38:48.292 --> 05:38:50.613
We've got to take the shot and just get this over with.

05:38:50.653 --> 05:38:51.393
Do you hear it?

05:38:54.342 --> 05:39:01.286
that the Canadians provided to us from that package that shows the graph that you just showed.

05:39:02.306 --> 05:39:07.189
We have concentration in ovarian tissue of a novel lipid reagent.

05:39:08.267 --> 05:39:11.789
that is previously untested and has some very unique characteristics.

05:39:12.389 --> 05:39:14.590
It's an ionizable cationic lipid.

05:39:15.291 --> 05:39:17.312
We just don't know what that means.

05:39:18.032 --> 05:39:18.632
Here's the thing.

05:39:19.473 --> 05:39:30.538
When I first started, when I first trained about what the history of the FDA is, the thing that is the hallmark of the modern FDA is the response to thalidomide.

05:39:33.495 --> 05:39:42.859
And that has guided the whole legislative structure and organizational structure of the FDA.

05:39:43.799 --> 05:39:48.881
That's all about reproductive toxicity and potential consequences in terms of birth defects.

05:39:52.293 --> 05:40:03.980
I hope that Pfizer has submitted to Peter a comprehensive genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity panel in the non-clinical studies.

05:40:04.060 --> 05:40:07.202
But even then, rats are not humans.

05:40:08.823 --> 05:40:16.208
And what we've learned is that reproductive risks don't always manifest in the first generation.

05:40:17.566 --> 05:40:23.487
So I don't mean to scare, but I do mean to speak honestly and with integrity.

05:40:24.527 --> 05:40:38.630
And, um, I think the, the, the honest position is if you were to ask me, Robert, do you know what the reproductive consequences are for this signal?

05:40:39.890 --> 05:40:43.631
I have to tell you, no, I don't because we don't have the data.

05:40:45.197 --> 05:41:03.966
And if you then ask me, has there been any examples in the past of reproductive effects of agents in female reproductive tissue that were not anticipated by the animal model testing, I would have to say, yes, there is.

05:41:05.427 --> 05:41:12.391
So I think my position on all of this goes back to the bioethics, if you'll forgive me.

05:41:13.331 --> 05:41:15.933
There has to be full and open disclosure.

05:41:15.953 --> 05:41:28.163
I think we owe it, we do owe it to people, to the audience, to those of us who are facing this crisis and wanting to do the right thing.

05:41:29.724 --> 05:41:32.667
I think we, this gets back to it's your body.

05:41:34.908 --> 05:41:44.417
I think that the burden is on the government not to tell us what to do, but to convince us based on the information what to do.

05:41:45.458 --> 05:41:54.447
And I think that they have an obligation, they do have an obligation, this goes back to the bedrocks of bioethics, to full and open disclosure.

05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:57.610
And in the case of the

05:41:58.393 --> 05:42:01.237
potential reproductive implications of this.

05:42:01.297 --> 05:42:02.218
That's on the video.

05:42:02.238 --> 05:42:07.204
I don't know where that aggregated noise is coming from signal in a female reproductive tissue.

05:42:09.467 --> 05:42:12.250
I think that there needs to be transparency.

05:42:13.171 --> 05:42:15.795
I think that we have to not

05:42:17.329 --> 05:42:32.780
assume that reports such as dysmenorrhea, which are occurring, and you can appreciate if you're a young woman and you're having menstrual irregularities, it's kind of embarrassing socially to talk about it.

05:42:33.361 --> 05:42:36.063
And you're not going to rush off to the internet and go post it.

05:42:36.843 --> 05:42:40.186
even if you're a millennial, and I don't think.

05:42:41.807 --> 05:42:49.413
So I think that we as a public health community, if I can speak for the public health community,

05:42:51.972 --> 05:43:11.842
really should err on the side of transparency and disclosure and trust the American people and the people all over the world, the adults who are competent to make decisions, to make decisions for their own health and for those adolescents and infants and youth.

05:43:12.679 --> 05:43:15.641
Remember, they cannot give informed consent.

05:43:15.841 --> 05:43:18.303
They can't by definition.

05:43:19.184 --> 05:43:22.746
The only people that can give it for them are their parents and their guardians.

05:43:23.927 --> 05:43:38.278
And, um, I, I do feel pretty strongly that these things that I hear about now in multiple cultures, the strategy, we're going to give out ice cream to get the kids to get vaccinated.

05:43:38.958 --> 05:43:39.839
That's just wrong.

05:43:39.979 --> 05:43:40.159
Yeah.

05:43:41.553 --> 05:43:48.200
Now it's, it's tantamount to evil in light of the very scary implications of the thing.

05:43:48.280 --> 05:43:49.721
And we're going to, we're going to look back.

05:43:49.841 --> 05:43:50.622
We're going to look back.

05:43:50.822 --> 05:43:56.368
It would be wrong also to go on a podcast and suggest that the main danger of transfection was ADE.

05:43:57.409 --> 05:44:03.475
It would also be wrong to go on a podcast and suggest that the main danger is a virus rather than the transfection.

05:44:05.117 --> 05:44:14.962
And we are going to look back on this in a few years or in a generation and realize that these men were among the men that led us down the path of destruction.

05:44:16.122 --> 05:44:22.005
That led us down the path that we should not have ever walked because they didn't hold their arms straight.

05:44:24.886 --> 05:44:26.187
These are not good men.

05:44:27.418 --> 05:44:33.725
These are men who have broken under the pressure of the narrative and have towed the line because they were forced to tow the line.

05:44:34.045 --> 05:44:35.467
They're happy to tow the line.

05:44:35.987 --> 05:44:38.149
I don't care if they don't know they're towing the line.

05:44:38.610 --> 05:44:45.597
They are responsible for where we are now, and they could have done something different, like hold their arms straight.

05:44:46.226 --> 05:44:59.521
You know, there's been times when as a culture facing as, you know, many cultures facing major crises, war and other things, where there's been decisions made to cross ethical lines.

05:45:00.562 --> 05:45:06.088
And, you know, in US history recently, in our experience in World War II, we had the internment camps.

05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:09.632
Germany has had their experiences, heaven knows.

05:45:11.034 --> 05:45:18.643
And it's easy in the fog of war, and I can tell you from being on the front lines of outbreak response, it is like war.

05:45:19.965 --> 05:45:22.989
And it's easy to make judgment calls.

05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:31.756
where you say that the benefits merit compromising some of our core ethical principles.

05:45:33.037 --> 05:45:40.643
And invariably, in retrospect, we end up saying that was a mistake.

05:45:41.384 --> 05:45:42.265
And I'm going to leave it at that.

05:45:42.545 --> 05:45:42.845
All right.

05:45:43.606 --> 05:45:49.871
So I think you have a last point you want to make and then I will deploy my plan and we'll see how that goes.

05:45:50.191 --> 05:46:00.163
Well, look, knowing what I know today, if I had known what I know today, I never would have vaccinated my three young daughters.

05:46:01.524 --> 05:46:07.411
I would have done whatever I could, you know, they're of age, they can decide for themselves.

05:46:08.411 --> 05:46:23.230
Um, but I would have done everything, uh, in, in my power to have tried to domain was not mentioned in this podcast, even though it was mentioned in science magazine before the podcast and associated Robert Malone with it changed their minds.

05:46:24.965 --> 05:46:30.587
And I don't have any boys, but if it were my children, I would do whatever I could to do that.

05:46:31.027 --> 05:46:45.351
I think it's, I do not understand this push to let's get this, let's accelerate the approval of this experiment.

05:46:45.431 --> 05:46:51.473
And to experiment on our kids is to me, and what really frustrates me

05:46:52.498 --> 05:47:04.814
is I know one of the cabinet members of the Biden administration, and I brought this to his attention numerous times, and he has tried to get the attention of the proper people.

05:47:05.623 --> 05:47:06.403
And I hear crickets.

05:47:06.503 --> 05:47:07.744
The bell doesn't ring.

05:47:08.104 --> 05:47:11.066
It doesn't register because it's against the narrative.

05:47:11.326 --> 05:47:11.466
Yeah.

05:47:12.166 --> 05:47:13.667
And there's a reason for that.

05:47:14.127 --> 05:47:17.589
It's it's like I and I because I sent it to a friend of mine.

05:47:19.870 --> 05:47:24.612
It's against their narrative because they they have been told that vaccines work.

05:47:24.652 --> 05:47:27.254
They have told that vaccines can't be questioned.

05:47:27.294 --> 05:47:29.195
They have been told that vaccines are the way out.

05:47:29.915 --> 05:47:42.724
They have been told that gain-of-function viruses are real, that synthetic viruses are dangerous on a military field and in bioterrorism, and they've been told all of this stuff by people like Robert Malone for 20 years.

05:47:45.686 --> 05:47:53.091
He's trying to say that these people don't understand and that they've been misled and whatever, but what he's not saying is that they've been misled by people like Robert Malone.

05:47:54.500 --> 05:48:07.892
that perpetuate the danger of zoonotic viruses, perpetuate the danger of gain-of-function viruses, perpetuate the danger and need for vaccine-like countermeasures, for vaccine technologies, for vaccine budgets.

05:48:09.634 --> 05:48:13.217
And Robert Malone sits on those study sections.

05:48:13.578 --> 05:48:19.843
He chairs those study sections that distribute those billions of dollars for those imaginary dangers.

05:48:21.102 --> 05:48:29.289
And he is now involved in ushering in the permanent system that will govern us by the existence of those imaginary dangers.

05:48:29.830 --> 05:48:30.450
That's where we are.

05:48:30.831 --> 05:48:32.132
Welcome to the real world.

05:48:32.672 --> 05:48:38.337
And you can see it plain as day through the Dark Horse podcast from June of 2021.

05:48:39.498 --> 05:48:47.024
Yesterday, and I said, hey, could you get the, you know, I've tried the secretary and he was unable to get it to Biden's attention.

05:48:49.063 --> 05:48:54.490
Could you at least get it to and mention someone who's a top staffer of Pelosi?

05:48:55.530 --> 05:48:59.933
And so he looked at the document, he spent probably spent two minutes looking at it.

05:49:00.593 --> 05:49:02.014
And he said, Steve, I love you.

05:49:02.034 --> 05:49:03.135
I've known you for a long time.

05:49:03.175 --> 05:49:15.123
You're a great guy, but it, I mean, I should show you the email, but it ended with, and you probably don't think that there was an attack on January 6th.

05:49:15.804 --> 05:49:20.927
And that is just, you know, it's like, look, it's gaslighting.

05:49:21.908 --> 05:49:24.850
If you want to, if you want to criticize what I've written,

05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:38.293
Please tell me what's wrong and I'll fix it and and I said so you just so Can you believe they brought up January 6th on this interview Can you believe it?

05:49:39.333 --> 05:49:42.374
That they set up that controversy already on this interview.

05:49:42.894 --> 05:49:43.454
Tell me the truth.

05:49:43.494 --> 05:49:48.115
You just deleted it when when you saw it He said no, I I I didn't delete it.

05:49:48.635 --> 05:49:52.256
I kept it around but I didn't forward it like he said he would

05:49:53.083 --> 05:49:58.825
He said, forward it to me, I will send it to... So he just, you know... Cowardice.

05:49:59.305 --> 05:50:01.786
Yeah, I mean, this is important, right?

05:50:02.466 --> 05:50:04.026
I might be right on this.

05:50:04.507 --> 05:50:14.910
And everything I've seen, every single thing I've seen from talking to the paramedics, from talking to the doctors, seeing doctors fired, seeing paramedics intimidated,

05:50:16.051 --> 05:50:24.820
You know, seeing my friends, doing the next door surveys, every single time I try to look for, oh, maybe, you know, are they right?

05:50:25.141 --> 05:50:26.842
And I get nothing.

05:50:26.923 --> 05:50:29.445
I get confirmation the more I learn.

05:50:29.846 --> 05:50:37.113
And for me to try to convince an academic, oh, and his argument was, Steve, you must be wrong.

05:50:37.754 --> 05:50:43.140
because all the academics say that it's safe and effective.

05:50:43.881 --> 05:50:52.050
I commented on a post from one of the doctors at UCSF who says, I'm going to vaccinate my kid.

05:50:52.571 --> 05:50:54.553
And I said, well, you should look at this first.

05:50:56.755 --> 05:51:01.517
And so my friend's comment was, look, this is like global warming.

05:51:01.557 --> 05:51:03.417
And so there's the global warming deniers.

05:51:03.997 --> 05:51:07.298
And they're, you know, deniers of, you know, what happened.

05:51:07.618 --> 05:51:08.178
It's tribal.

05:51:08.298 --> 05:51:13.140
He goes and he says, he says, Look, you're up against all everybody else.

05:51:13.820 --> 05:51:16.101
says that it's safe and effective.

05:51:16.561 --> 05:51:18.661
All the academics say it's safe and effective.

05:51:18.781 --> 05:51:21.162
No one is raising any alarms.

05:51:21.702 --> 05:51:26.903
And so it's basically, they're saying like, there's something wrong with you.

05:51:26.943 --> 05:51:36.366
And in fact, right after Byram's presentation, my wife was entertaining five of my friends, or five of our friends.

05:51:37.609 --> 05:51:56.142
And after I heard this about the biodistribution, I said, hey, if you haven't vaccinated your kids, I just found out some information that says, this is gonna be unsafe and here's why, we're supposed to be in the arm, went to the whole body, spike protein is not a harmless antigen.

05:51:56.723 --> 05:52:00.285
And then they said, hey, thank you, Steve, thank you, Steve.

05:52:00.926 --> 05:52:05.049
We were gonna vaccinate our kids, but we're not gonna go to, and then I walk out.

05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:10.516
And then they're like, is Steve okay?

05:52:10.917 --> 05:52:12.038
Has he been working too hard?

05:52:12.118 --> 05:52:14.061
Is he like, you know?

05:52:15.062 --> 05:52:16.284
As if this was a minor issue.

05:52:16.966 --> 05:52:22.150
Yeah, they're like thinking that he's lost it, right?

05:52:22.611 --> 05:52:24.312
And so this is the frustration.

05:52:24.352 --> 05:52:26.714
This is why people can't speak out, right?

05:52:26.754 --> 05:52:32.679
Because the narrative is so strong that everybody believes in this false narrative.

05:52:32.759 --> 05:52:36.483
And so anyone who challenges and says the emperor wears no clothes,

05:52:37.486 --> 05:52:42.409
is just shot down and marginalized and they say to your face, oh, hey, thank you a lot.

05:52:42.569 --> 05:52:48.212
And then when you turn around, they're like, wow, what's happened to him?

05:52:48.232 --> 05:52:53.715
And the amazing thing, of course, is that here you have a case.

05:52:54.406 --> 05:53:13.638
where the NIH is basically sandbagging effective treatments, that the CDC is going along for the ride, that the FDA is fooled, and that people in Congress think Tony Fauci, who's been called out as the creator of the coronavirus and caused this whole thing, and then screwed up by not

05:53:14.558 --> 05:53:16.759
Oh, no, it's no there is believe me.

05:53:16.819 --> 05:53:35.564
I was I was very early on the lab We should we should have a separate one on this but Chris Chris Martinson does a fabulous job on his YouTube channel in taking down Tony Fauci Chris Martinson mentioned again interesting small circle of people getting mentioned on this podcast, isn't it in this whole cover?

05:53:35.584 --> 05:53:36.745
I'm not defending but okay.

05:53:36.865 --> 05:53:37.145
Okay.

05:53:37.345 --> 05:53:41.106
Yeah, but you know, but Congress like I wrote to Anna

05:53:42.246 --> 05:53:48.088
sorry, my Congresswoman, and I said, look at, here's the document, here's the facts.

05:53:48.768 --> 05:53:49.589
How do you respond to this?

05:53:50.049 --> 05:54:07.275
She wrote me a nice letter that says the vaccine is safe and effective, we'll be rolling it out, and the CDC has found no problems, and I'm going like, well, they haven't even analyzed any of the cases, and they should be assuming that there's a vaccine.

05:54:07.575 --> 05:54:10.956
Like, they halt things, like they're stopping criteria.

05:54:11.556 --> 05:54:15.418
you know, should be a hundred deaths or 200, you know, anyway.

05:54:15.558 --> 05:54:16.178
Robert's right.

05:54:16.938 --> 05:54:17.859
They're gaslighting us.

05:54:18.719 --> 05:54:19.399
It's getting to you.

05:54:19.900 --> 05:54:20.340
I hear you.

05:54:20.380 --> 05:54:24.962
You sound completely rational to me, but you know, look, look, look, I expected this.

05:54:25.062 --> 05:54:34.226
I knew, I knew when I went into this that I would suffer, that, that, that, you know, I would be, let me give you 30 seconds of comfort and then we're going to, we're going to fix the planet.

05:54:34.546 --> 05:54:37.948
This is always the case when you're at the tip of the spear.

05:54:39.510 --> 05:54:41.454
He said it again, tip of the spear.

05:54:41.595 --> 05:54:42.898
All you get is arrows in the ass.

05:54:43.118 --> 05:54:43.279
Yeah.

05:54:43.299 --> 05:54:45.624
Okay, this is a paradigm shift problem.

05:54:46.576 --> 05:54:50.157
And the lovely thing about medicine is we've been through multiple cycles of this.

05:54:51.637 --> 05:55:03.601
The classic one is gastric ulcers and the bacterial basis for gastric ulcers, which the guy that did that was subjected to everything that you're experiencing and more.

05:55:04.741 --> 05:55:08.222
It is just, so I guess I'm saying, welcome to my world.

05:55:08.342 --> 05:55:09.943
Embrace you.

05:55:09.963 --> 05:55:11.763
And it's the nature, it is the.

05:55:15.004 --> 05:55:16.307
He's never been in that world.

05:55:16.327 --> 05:55:17.309
What is he talking about?

05:55:19.763 --> 05:55:35.068
It's the red badge of courage that you're going through this and you have the guts, despite all that, to continue to say whether you're right or wrong, to have the courage to go to swim upstream and say, this isn't right.

05:55:35.208 --> 05:55:35.388
Right.

05:55:35.528 --> 05:55:43.291
And everybody, by the way, everybody advised me because I told people, look, and you know, this is the real, like Pierre Cory doesn't do this.

05:55:43.311 --> 05:55:45.632
This is like, you're taking on two albatrosses.

05:55:46.412 --> 05:55:48.873
One is championing early treatment.

05:55:48.913 --> 05:55:53.956
In Brazil, they don't think early treatment works at all, despite all the proof.

05:55:54.636 --> 05:55:57.697
So, you're trying to champion this cause.

05:55:57.717 --> 05:56:00.979
You're going up against the NIH and the WHO.

05:56:01.259 --> 05:56:04.841
And they said, if you take on also the vaccine,

05:56:05.754 --> 05:56:06.094
You're done.

05:56:06.114 --> 05:56:06.654
You're done.

05:56:06.734 --> 05:56:07.395
You're done.

05:56:07.575 --> 05:56:08.375
So wait a minute.

05:56:08.395 --> 05:56:09.936
Robert is saying something very important.

05:56:10.136 --> 05:56:14.018
And I know he's right, because I've been through it in a totally separate instance, right?

05:56:15.458 --> 05:56:22.081
The work I did that revealed that there was a flaw in the drug safety system, that was 2002, right?

05:56:22.441 --> 05:56:24.482
So I know what that is.

05:56:24.622 --> 05:56:25.523
And Robert's right.

05:56:25.563 --> 05:56:30.125
This is par for the course, except the stakes are really high here.

05:56:30.865 --> 05:56:36.506
And the amazing thing is that nobody is pulling the Andon cord in Congress to say, hey, stop.

05:56:36.546 --> 05:56:39.027
But that's what we've got to do with the Save the World Plan here.

05:56:39.207 --> 05:56:42.647
Because I really want to begin to wrap this up.

05:56:42.808 --> 05:56:46.888
And I think the point is, you've got all of these anomalous signatures, right?

05:56:47.508 --> 05:56:58.691
Even if the answer is, and I can make a defense for emergency authorizations for a vaccine that is not well enough tested in the face of an emergency, in the face of a virus that we might get stuck with as a permanent fellow traveler.

05:56:59.571 --> 05:57:00.712
know about the risk.

05:57:00.912 --> 05:57:06.558
I can't make that argument when there's perfectly safe therapies that are available to us off the shelf.

05:57:06.638 --> 05:57:06.978
That's right.

05:57:07.178 --> 05:57:07.839
Absolutely right.

05:57:08.059 --> 05:57:11.342
And I never could have made that argument for people who've already had COVID.

05:57:11.362 --> 05:57:18.148
And I certainly wouldn't have made that argument for women or children, especially pregnant women.

05:57:18.188 --> 05:57:19.750
But the fact is, that's ovaries, right?

05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:23.593
That signal is telling us something about potential long-term reproductive health.

05:57:23.633 --> 05:57:24.814
So all of that said,

05:57:26.015 --> 05:57:26.595
Nicely worded.

05:57:26.735 --> 05:57:28.796
Potential long-term reproductive health.

05:57:29.436 --> 05:57:29.817
Thank you.

05:57:30.197 --> 05:57:33.858
I would have said something different, but you said it correctly.

05:57:33.898 --> 05:57:35.259
He's a scientist.

05:57:35.339 --> 05:57:37.279
I'm cautious this way.

05:57:37.379 --> 05:57:46.323
So let's just say we've got all of these signals of something I would call extended regulatory capture, where regulatory capture now reaches into

05:57:47.083 --> 05:57:55.626
Not just regulatory agencies, it reaches into journals, it reaches into universities, it reaches into the social media layer, it reaches into the organizations of doctors, all of the things.

05:57:56.807 --> 05:57:58.127
And the World Health Organization.

05:57:59.728 --> 05:58:02.349
So this extended capture, we're all feeling it.

05:58:02.449 --> 05:58:11.052
To the extent that people are not doing what we're doing here, and they are silencing themselves because they're afraid of the stigma that comes back if they talk about the things they think they might be seeing.

05:58:11.892 --> 05:58:12.052
right?

05:58:12.232 --> 05:58:13.633
Everybody is being touched by this.

05:58:13.653 --> 05:58:15.195
I call it self-censorship.

05:58:15.495 --> 05:58:20.539
It is self-censorship, but the point is, I don't think there's any way to beat that going through the front door.

05:58:21.397 --> 05:58:29.663
What you're finding out about trying to raise the alarm here is telling you something about that's not going to work, because there are so many layers protecting it.

05:58:29.843 --> 05:58:30.624
We are aligned.

05:58:30.844 --> 05:58:31.004
Right.

05:58:31.024 --> 05:58:31.164
Right.

05:58:31.345 --> 05:58:31.525
Right.

05:58:31.625 --> 05:58:33.406
The only way to go is to go to the people.

05:58:34.007 --> 05:58:36.709
Not the people, because the people can't do anything about it.

05:58:36.729 --> 05:58:37.609
No, no, no, no, no.

05:58:37.649 --> 05:58:38.310
Yes, they can.

05:58:38.330 --> 05:58:40.271
It sounds to me like you're coming to the same point.

05:58:40.331 --> 05:58:40.531
Oh, yeah.

05:58:40.591 --> 05:58:41.312
Well, OK.

05:58:41.352 --> 05:58:41.953
Well, let's see.

05:58:41.993 --> 05:58:43.494
Let's see what your solution is.

05:58:43.754 --> 05:58:45.195
My solution, and I, you know.

05:58:45.355 --> 05:58:46.416
I have my own solution.

05:58:46.436 --> 05:58:46.756
OK.

05:58:46.816 --> 05:58:47.937
So my solution.

05:58:49.918 --> 05:58:53.760
It doesn't have to be Elon, but it can be Elon, right?

05:58:53.840 --> 05:58:54.540
Now, here's my point.

05:58:54.620 --> 05:58:56.261
Elon checks all the boxes, right?

05:58:57.041 --> 05:59:00.043
Elon is hyper-intelligent, right?

05:59:00.103 --> 05:59:02.824
And he appears to be hell-bent on saving planet Earth.

05:59:03.144 --> 05:59:05.866
And he's willing to do this with Herculean efforts, right?

05:59:05.906 --> 05:59:10.468
How hard is it to shift the country to thinking that electric cars are safe?

05:59:10.908 --> 05:59:14.410
That is some si- where did- did that come out of left field for you?

05:59:16.370 --> 05:59:16.791
Elon?

05:59:18.007 --> 05:59:20.050
What in the hell are we talking about here?

05:59:20.090 --> 05:59:20.791
I gotta go back.

05:59:21.693 --> 05:59:25.819
I thought he was gonna have like a series of planned, like, not a person.

05:59:26.618 --> 05:59:27.739
What the hell is this?

05:59:28.799 --> 05:59:29.480
Right, right.

05:59:29.560 --> 05:59:31.361
The only way to go is to go to the people.

05:59:31.962 --> 05:59:34.663
Not the people, because the people can't do anything about it.

05:59:34.683 --> 05:59:35.564
No, no, no, no, no.

05:59:35.624 --> 05:59:36.285
Yes, they can.

05:59:36.525 --> 05:59:37.946
Sounds to me like you're coming to the same point.

05:59:37.966 --> 05:59:39.567
The people can't do anything about it.

05:59:39.647 --> 05:59:41.428
That's an interesting theme, isn't it?

05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.509
Point of view.

05:59:42.569 --> 05:59:43.129
Well, let's see.

05:59:43.189 --> 05:59:45.471
OK, well, let's see what your solution is.

05:59:45.731 --> 05:59:48.373
My solution, and I, you know, I have my own solution.

05:59:48.393 --> 05:59:53.096
OK, so my solution, it doesn't have to be Elon.

05:59:54.096 --> 05:59:55.077
But it can be Elon.

05:59:55.397 --> 05:59:55.937
It can be!

05:59:55.977 --> 05:59:56.517
Here's my point.

05:59:56.597 --> 05:59:58.278
Elon checks all the boxes, right?

05:59:58.599 --> 06:00:00.200
Oh man, he checks all those boxes.

06:00:00.220 --> 06:00:02.021
Elon is hyper-intelligent, right?

06:00:02.081 --> 06:00:04.742
And he appears to be hell-bent on saving planet Earth.

06:00:05.122 --> 06:00:07.364
And he's willing to do this with Herculean effort.

06:00:07.404 --> 06:00:11.066
Do you really have the opinion that Elon Musk is hyper-intelligent?

06:00:12.327 --> 06:00:15.869
Have you ever heard him speak in a way that makes him hyper-intelligent?

06:00:17.870 --> 06:00:21.652
You know who I've heard speak that I think is hyper-intelligent?

06:00:22.472 --> 06:00:23.133
Thomas Sowell.

06:00:24.636 --> 06:00:28.758
When I watch him speak, I think somebody speaking there is very hyper-intelligent.

06:00:31.859 --> 06:00:34.821
But I don't have that feeling about very many people.

06:00:34.841 --> 06:00:38.142
I'm not trying to be arrogant or anything like that.

06:00:38.763 --> 06:00:40.563
The average adult is the average adult.

06:00:40.904 --> 06:00:45.986
Most people have a pretty hard time conveying the ideas that are floating around in their head.

06:00:47.188 --> 06:00:55.415
Most people have an even harder time juggling the ideas that were just thrown at them and then throwing them back to the person and repeating that over and over again.

06:00:58.277 --> 06:01:10.388
I think that what you see here on a regular basis on the Dark Horse Podcast is people pretending to be able to juggle ideas in their head and then throw them back to the other person, juggle them around and then throw them back again.

06:01:11.989 --> 06:01:13.250
And they're not doing that at all.

06:01:14.605 --> 06:01:24.173
that's actually a carefully orchestrated pigeonholing your brain into thinking very, very limited thoughts.

06:01:25.474 --> 06:01:29.297
Rather than showing you the possibilities, they limit them.

06:01:31.499 --> 06:01:33.841
And that's what this podcast was designed to do.

06:01:34.021 --> 06:01:43.949
Rather than show you all the possibilities of what's going on and what is causing the pandemic, what's going wrong in the pandemic, they have narrowed your focus.

06:01:45.146 --> 06:01:52.128
narrowed your focus, never once in three hours did they mention the PCR test.

06:01:54.648 --> 06:01:59.389
Not once in three hours did they mention the PCR test.

06:02:01.169 --> 06:02:06.711
And I have heard remdesivir a total of twice, I believe, not even five times.

06:02:08.411 --> 06:02:12.852
And the one time that Robert Malone said it, he followed it immediately with dexamethasone.

06:02:15.282 --> 06:02:15.842
efforts, right?

06:02:15.882 --> 06:02:21.344
How hard is it to shift the country to thinking that electric cars are super cool, right?

06:02:21.645 --> 06:02:23.905
How hard is it to get us to actually put people on Mars?

06:02:23.925 --> 06:02:24.646
These are difficult.

06:02:24.666 --> 06:02:33.429
And so my point is, look, if Elon is hell-bent on saving planet Earth, the hard thing to come by when you're in the saving planet Earth business is practice, right?

06:02:33.489 --> 06:02:40.412
It's very hard to find places where you can- Make no mistake about it, Elon Musk has an RNA-making company.

06:02:43.413 --> 06:02:44.574
Make no mistake about it.

06:02:44.774 --> 06:02:46.055
He loves the RNA.

06:02:46.535 --> 06:02:48.156
He loves transfection.

06:02:48.176 --> 06:02:49.917
He loves genetic therapy.

06:02:50.778 --> 06:02:57.482
He loves the fact that we are being coerced into giving up the sovereignty over our bodies.

06:02:57.522 --> 06:02:58.143
He loves it.

06:02:58.834 --> 06:03:01.455
practice that skill and you need it because it's a difficult job.

06:03:01.515 --> 06:03:11.718
So my point is this is the perfect instance because here we have an easy way to save planet Earth and it just so happens that Elon has a tremendous number of resources.

06:03:11.818 --> 06:03:17.860
Now he could do this as a matter, he could get together some of his friends and he could pool the resources or he could do it alone.

06:03:17.900 --> 06:03:18.820
But my point is

06:03:19.660 --> 06:03:27.765
What we're really looking at is runaway extended regulatory capture that has caused the greatest defect.

06:03:27.805 --> 06:03:40.053
If there is an argument to be made about our economic and political system, it is that our system can allow you to evaporate trillions of dollars of wealth in the pursuit of billions of dollars of wealth.

06:03:40.393 --> 06:03:41.674
And that is what is happening here.

06:03:41.754 --> 06:03:44.796
If what we see- There's a lot to be said for that statement.

06:03:44.836 --> 06:03:46.777
That bears repeating.

06:03:46.937 --> 06:03:49.959
It's pretty scary and the point is it's not just wealth in this case.

06:03:49.979 --> 06:03:51.981
We're talking about trillions of dollars of wealth.

06:03:52.061 --> 06:03:57.986
We're talking about the tensions on the global economic and political system like we have never seen before.

06:03:58.346 --> 06:04:06.652
We're talking about a huge amount of needless death and suffering and loss of years of viable life from people.

06:04:07.053 --> 06:04:12.337
So that's a hell of a lot to lose so that some entity or set of entities can make

06:04:12.957 --> 06:04:15.899
I don't know, five, ten billion dollars, right?

06:04:16.079 --> 06:04:16.760
It's absurd.

06:04:16.900 --> 06:04:18.982
So the point is, look, there's a bitter pill here.

06:04:19.810 --> 06:04:22.671
The bitter pill is we can't solve the problem perfectly.

06:04:23.411 --> 06:04:25.331
We're going to have to accept something ugly.

06:04:25.891 --> 06:04:40.235
And I think what we have to accept is that if this is going to happen to planet Earth with perfectly viable solutions available to us off the shelf that we're not going to be allowed to touch, I'm afraid the next move is that they're going to be taken from us so that we can't even source them as individuals.

06:04:40.775 --> 06:04:46.336
If that's what's going to happen, then the answer is we need to buy out the interests of those who are doing it.

06:04:46.676 --> 06:04:46.856
right?

06:04:47.256 --> 06:04:58.863
If they've got an emergency use authorization for an untested dangerous new drug and that's the reason that they're thwarting our ability to talk about the solutions that are available to us, then let's just fucking buy them out already, right?

06:04:59.164 --> 06:05:00.785
And if that's Elon, then it's Elon.

06:05:00.805 --> 06:05:02.806
And if it's a group of people, then it's a group of people.

06:05:02.826 --> 06:05:04.627
But there's no reason to crash plant Earth.

06:05:04.647 --> 06:05:07.849
So Elon should buy everybody ivermectin.

06:05:07.909 --> 06:05:08.649
Is that what he's saying?

06:05:08.669 --> 06:05:09.210
I guess it is.

06:05:09.983 --> 06:05:11.526
It's the little fish rising up enough.

06:05:13.369 --> 06:05:17.817
I've never even imagined acting with that strategy.

06:05:17.857 --> 06:05:18.538
That's profound.

06:05:18.759 --> 06:05:19.600
Why wouldn't we do it?

06:05:20.201 --> 06:05:21.644
Well, cash, capital.

06:05:22.105 --> 06:05:22.926
Right, but the point is, OK.

06:05:23.965 --> 06:05:24.485
I ain't got it.

06:05:24.525 --> 06:05:25.746
I don't think any of us have it.

06:05:26.226 --> 06:05:28.787
Well, as you've done, my friend, I don't think you've got it.

06:05:28.867 --> 06:05:29.867
Not quite in that category.

06:05:29.927 --> 06:05:30.787
No, but you know.

06:05:30.907 --> 06:05:34.028
But you've done your part.

06:05:34.148 --> 06:05:35.549
I can speak to something.

06:05:35.569 --> 06:05:37.109
Assuming we're not silenced.

06:05:37.289 --> 06:05:37.489
Right.

06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:43.131
I don't know if YouTube is going to go and say this violates their policy.

06:05:43.151 --> 06:05:44.432
We talked about Ivermectin.

06:05:45.372 --> 06:05:48.213
We're going to find out in a few minutes whether we're even still on the internet.

06:05:48.253 --> 06:05:51.134
My guess is we are or somebody would have found a way to alert us.

06:05:51.334 --> 06:05:55.958
Well, I'm getting these all, you know, all these texts.

06:05:56.138 --> 06:05:58.920
They're pretending like they don't know it's going to be canceled.

06:05:58.980 --> 06:06:00.121
Oh, it might be canceled.

06:06:00.181 --> 06:06:02.483
And then we'll know for sure that we're being censored.

06:06:02.523 --> 06:06:03.604
So we must be right.

06:06:06.266 --> 06:06:07.287
It's cute, isn't it?

06:06:08.088 --> 06:06:09.709
It's just terrible how they played us.

06:06:10.410 --> 06:06:11.370
It's diabolical.

06:06:12.031 --> 06:06:12.912
It's malevolent.

06:06:14.053 --> 06:06:14.833
It's not funny.

06:06:15.954 --> 06:06:16.875
It's a disaster.

06:06:17.796 --> 06:06:18.616
They played us.

06:06:19.704 --> 06:06:21.326
They got us to drop our arms.

06:06:22.207 --> 06:06:38.845
Millions of people around the world did not keep their arms straight like they would have as normal, wide-awake adults because they were terrified by the TV, they were terrified by social media, they were terrified by the censorship, and they were terrified by people on this podcast.

06:06:39.764 --> 06:06:40.304
It's a signal.

06:06:40.344 --> 06:06:46.629
But in any case, look, I do think this is way easier than shifting people to electric cars.

06:06:46.709 --> 06:06:48.570
And it's a hell of a lot easier than going to Mars.

06:06:48.910 --> 06:06:49.791
Can we just try this one?

06:06:49.811 --> 06:06:53.574
This is a, hey, practice saving planet Earth kind of a plan.

06:06:53.854 --> 06:06:55.015
And it's right there in front of us.

06:06:55.275 --> 06:06:56.115
And everything adds up.

06:06:56.155 --> 06:06:56.756
And the thing is,

06:06:57.927 --> 06:07:04.592
The thing that's really glorious about Elon is he is way smart enough to look at the same data that we've looked at.

06:07:04.892 --> 06:07:08.334
How many times is he gonna say that Elon Musk is hyper smart?

06:07:08.354 --> 06:07:09.275
He's way smart.

06:07:09.315 --> 06:07:12.117
He's so smart he can look at the data and see stuff we don't see.

06:07:12.697 --> 06:07:17.640
What is with this man crush that Brett has with Elon?

06:07:20.242 --> 06:07:22.284
You know another person that was in that

06:07:23.220 --> 06:07:29.724
That secret chat group with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson is a guy by the name of Alexandros Marinos.

06:07:31.285 --> 06:07:37.488
And if there's anybody on the internet that has a crush on Elon Musk, oh my goodness, get a room.

06:07:38.029 --> 06:07:40.630
It's the only conclusion you could reach if you look at it, right?

06:07:41.391 --> 06:07:41.891
He'll see it.

06:07:42.191 --> 06:07:45.853
So, um, I, I have to be careful here.

06:07:45.993 --> 06:07:46.794
I'm a consultant.

06:07:48.395 --> 06:07:52.517
Uh, one of my clients is a very, very large Indian conglomerate.

06:07:54.972 --> 06:08:04.417
run by one of the wealthiest men in the world, who the tax law there basically requires companies to tithe into a non-profit.

06:08:06.386 --> 06:08:14.451
and one has awareness, your comments spark a link.

06:08:16.572 --> 06:08:25.377
In that setting, that very large multi-billion dollar non-profit, a fund that's been created.

06:08:26.978 --> 06:08:28.198
Alex tweeted my Twitch.

06:08:28.218 --> 06:08:30.119
He's actively investing in.

06:08:30.400 --> 06:08:32.481
Alex tweeted my Twitch, well that's pretty sweet.

06:08:33.376 --> 06:08:36.157
I didn't think that he had ever, ever, ever once promoted me.

06:08:36.197 --> 06:08:37.798
That's very, very nice to hear.

06:08:37.818 --> 06:08:39.098
I hope that's true.

06:08:41.219 --> 06:08:47.702
Novel solutions of the kind that we're talking about for the rural poor in India.

06:08:49.282 --> 06:08:59.386
And so that, I think one of the things that... Relcovax, that sounds like a laxative, doesn't sound like a vaccine, yikes.

06:09:00.907 --> 06:09:02.968
I have, we haven't talked about,

06:09:03.942 --> 06:09:22.979
but the global kind of geopolitical what comes out the other side of the sausage machine thing is we're facing a future where pharmaceuticals and vaccines are largely produced offshore.

06:09:22.999 --> 06:09:27.343
We are losing or have largely lost.

06:09:27.503 --> 06:09:29.144
Did somebody slow the video down?

06:09:29.184 --> 06:09:30.966
I don't understand why he's talking like this.

06:09:32.000 --> 06:09:37.943
our pharmaceutical industry here in the United States as a consequence of this kind of kookiness.

06:09:39.203 --> 06:09:44.065
And it's the odd thing is, as you say, use the term market regulatory capture.

06:09:45.126 --> 06:09:52.749
Problem with those kind of situations is you get protected industries and they're not able to continue to compete on a global stage.

06:09:54.870 --> 06:10:00.092
And I fear with good reason and knowledge and experience

06:10:01.485 --> 06:10:04.289
that we're well along that road.

06:10:05.771 --> 06:10:16.145
And it's hard for me to see a future, basically I'm going to use slang, where China and India have not eaten our lunch.

06:10:18.502 --> 06:10:33.143
No, and you know, the thing is, this actually dovetails with the, if you zoom out and you look at planet Earth with respect to the question of vaccines and off the shelf, out of patent drugs,

06:10:35.766 --> 06:10:42.752
Somehow, whatever it is that looks a lot like extended regulatory capture is putting the United States behind.

06:10:42.953 --> 06:10:43.573
Exactly.

06:10:43.713 --> 06:10:43.913
Right.

06:10:44.474 --> 06:10:49.158
How is it we botched the initial reaction to COVID and now we're going to botch the solution?

06:10:49.238 --> 06:10:53.101
Everybody else is going to reach for ivermectin because it works and they're going to figure it out.

06:10:53.442 --> 06:10:53.582
Right.

06:10:53.622 --> 06:10:54.082
They already are.

06:10:54.302 --> 06:10:56.064
And other agents, not just ivermectin.

06:10:56.324 --> 06:10:56.504
Sure.

06:10:56.664 --> 06:10:58.325
Other repurposed agents?

06:10:58.645 --> 06:10:59.245
Fluvoxin.

06:10:59.645 --> 06:11:03.827
You can take ivermectin as a prototype.

06:11:03.927 --> 06:11:05.488
Inhaled butasenide.

06:11:05.588 --> 06:11:14.231
And you know, it's the one, maybe there are others, but it is the one that seems to me like a safe prophylactic response, which is really the key to making it drive COVID to extinction.

06:11:14.512 --> 06:11:15.412
But so anyway,

06:11:15.732 --> 06:11:29.854
If there's a group out there or an Elon that wants to do this, the key thing is you have to buy out the interests of the obstructionists who are making billions and evaporating trillions and inadvertently, I assume, killing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands.

06:11:30.254 --> 06:11:38.456
He thinks that Elon is going to buy a bunch of drug companies to prevent them from profiting on their EUAs that have already been granted.

06:11:39.256 --> 06:11:42.257
What kind of nonsense solution is this?

06:11:42.917 --> 06:11:44.817
Why doesn't he just say noncompliance?

06:11:47.403 --> 06:11:51.249
Why doesn't he just say united noncompliance is the only way out?

06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:53.813
Learning the biology is the only way out.

06:11:54.294 --> 06:11:57.559
Informed consent and the ability to say no is the only way out.

06:11:58.300 --> 06:11:59.703
Why is he saying Elon?

06:12:01.567 --> 06:12:04.568
Why is he saying that some super rich guy?

06:12:05.209 --> 06:12:06.069
Not any of us.

06:12:06.709 --> 06:12:07.690
Not the horse guy.

06:12:08.070 --> 06:12:08.730
Not me.

06:12:09.250 --> 06:12:10.991
I used to be a university professor.

06:12:11.511 --> 06:12:13.452
Not the optical mouse inventor.

06:12:13.732 --> 06:12:15.733
He's got a lot of money, but not that much money.

06:12:16.193 --> 06:12:17.254
Not Elon money.

06:12:17.634 --> 06:12:22.256
We need Elon style amount of money in order to save the world.

06:12:23.176 --> 06:12:24.677
Average people can't do anything.

06:12:25.657 --> 06:12:33.140
There's nothing you can do as an average person that would work besides united non-compliance with everybody around you.

06:12:35.660 --> 06:12:40.462
Can you see this, ladies and gentlemen, the intellectual dark web at its finest?

06:12:40.522 --> 06:12:42.663
I give you Brett Weinstein.

06:12:43.599 --> 06:12:55.528
potentially millions of people and the other thing you have to do is you have to ratchet up a campaign to generate these agents and to get them to the people who need them so we can drive COVID to extinction which really does to me at least look readily possible.

06:12:55.588 --> 06:12:56.729
Okay so I have a different solution.

06:12:56.829 --> 06:13:00.011
He thinks that we can drive COVID to extinction.

06:13:00.091 --> 06:13:06.276
Can we once and for all realize that this totally and completely discredits Brett as a biologist?

06:13:07.822 --> 06:13:10.203
as having any relevant opinion.

06:13:11.003 --> 06:13:13.784
Can we just say that this completely discredits him?

06:13:15.605 --> 06:13:22.588
I mean, I know I've been working on that for months now, trying to convince you that he keeps stepping in it, but this is just a joke.

06:13:24.129 --> 06:13:31.872
If this doesn't reveal him as somebody who's got some hands firmly up inside of him like a puppet, I don't know what does.

06:13:33.052 --> 06:13:33.793
Come on, guys.

06:13:34.890 --> 06:13:36.451
All right.

06:13:36.951 --> 06:13:41.573
Elon tweets a link to this video.

06:13:42.193 --> 06:13:45.554
And he says, everybody should watch this.

06:13:45.875 --> 06:13:49.776
So Elon can tweet this video to everyone and save the world.

06:13:49.916 --> 06:13:51.397
What is with Elon?

06:13:52.697 --> 06:13:55.999
This is very, very, very important.

06:13:56.699 --> 06:13:59.300
He has 50 million Twitter followers.

06:14:00.421 --> 06:14:03.802
And with 50 million, you've got scale.

06:14:04.906 --> 06:14:12.655
Well, you guys are operating in a world that I don't touch, and so I defer to you and your knowledge of these things.

06:14:12.876 --> 06:14:18.362
It's a different world than I live in, and I wish you godspeed, quite literally.

06:14:19.644 --> 06:14:22.788
And I hope, like we said about extinction of COVID,

06:14:23.408 --> 06:14:24.589
I hope I'm wrong and you're right.

06:14:24.709 --> 06:14:27.752
Yeah.

06:14:27.892 --> 06:14:29.733
I fear that's not the case.

06:14:29.834 --> 06:14:44.165
So he doesn't live in that world now, but in a few months apparently he's going to live in that world because he'll be on Getter and Gab and Telegram and Twitter and writing sub stack posts, sometimes three or four a day.

06:14:45.767 --> 06:14:51.912
And so while he doesn't dabble in any of that right now in June of 2021, I assure you at some point his staff

06:14:53.294 --> 06:14:55.655
and his wife are gonna dabble in that pretty readily.

06:14:58.297 --> 06:14:59.598
It's all a big show.

06:15:01.519 --> 06:15:07.302
So there's another solution too, which is that everybody who is watching this video,

06:15:08.419 --> 06:15:22.890
I think has a social responsibility, moral responsibility, ethical responsibility to retweet this, share it on whatever social media, LinkedIn, Facebook, the employees.

06:15:23.650 --> 06:15:47.158
of these companies also, if you're an employee of Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter and so forth, that if you see your company acting in a way that is actually where they're taking this, where they're promoting misinformation or suppressing legitimate information, then

06:15:48.338 --> 06:16:14.104
You know, the only thing that can stop, the government is not gonna stop these companies from doing the wrong things, but the employees of these companies can say, this is not acceptable for humanity, and I will not work for a company that is basically telling people to get the safe virus that is running ads that says ivermectin doesn't work, that is censoring

06:16:14.764 --> 06:16:29.012
Like how do you, if you work at Facebook, how do you think about working for a company which is censoring these vaccine victims who are trying to get support and trying to understand what can I do about them?

06:16:29.532 --> 06:16:32.174
And this company is censoring those people.

06:16:32.594 --> 06:16:35.876
And what we don't have is these people don't have a voice.

06:16:36.676 --> 06:16:37.997
The people who have died.

06:16:38.017 --> 06:16:39.418
I think that's crucial what you just said.

06:16:39.758 --> 06:16:43.300
The people who have died from this vaccine

06:16:44.127 --> 06:16:45.008
don't have a voice.

06:16:46.029 --> 06:17:03.146
The people who, the doctors, who want to speak out cannot because they don't have a voice, especially if you got any kind of NIH funding, if you're in academia, you speak out, you will never see a dime, you will never get a drug approved again.

06:17:03.546 --> 06:17:05.809
These agencies have a long, you know,

06:17:06.209 --> 06:17:15.379
people, I need to, you know, so I'm trying to be the voice for the voiceless for the vaccine victims who are ignored by the mainstream media.

06:17:16.019 --> 06:17:22.746
And and I just got a tweet yesterday from a woman who says I run a support group.

06:17:23.167 --> 06:17:24.188
And one of our members

06:17:25.279 --> 06:17:26.239
a committed suicide.

06:17:27.160 --> 06:17:29.541
Because this can I can I jump in on this?

06:17:29.601 --> 06:17:31.221
Because no one was listening to her.

06:17:31.441 --> 06:17:33.502
And yeah, can I can I let me finish?

06:17:33.522 --> 06:17:34.943
Okay.

06:17:36.263 --> 06:17:37.684
And a voice for the children.

06:17:38.504 --> 06:17:38.684
Right?

06:17:38.724 --> 06:17:40.705
Because who is going to speak for the children?

06:17:41.765 --> 06:17:41.946
Right?

06:17:42.006 --> 06:17:46.327
Who is going to be the voice of the children here, and to speak up for them.

06:17:46.827 --> 06:17:51.089
And so we have all of these people who are afraid to speak up.

06:17:51.449 --> 06:17:52.830
And I was told Steve,

06:17:53.652 --> 06:17:57.614
They told me, let me advise you, don't touch this issue.

06:17:58.114 --> 06:17:59.155
It's a third rail.

06:17:59.275 --> 06:18:02.277
If you touch it, you'll vanish.

06:18:02.397 --> 06:18:03.457
I was given the same advice.

06:18:03.657 --> 06:18:03.857
Right.

06:18:03.877 --> 06:18:10.261
And look, I really acknowledge your taking.

06:18:10.441 --> 06:18:12.042
He was given the same advice?

06:18:17.372 --> 06:18:19.633
So are they rolling it back now a little bit?

06:18:19.753 --> 06:18:22.314
They're getting back from that line of don't touch it.

06:18:22.354 --> 06:18:23.194
What is happening here?

06:18:23.234 --> 06:18:24.754
Let's make sure we heard that correct.

06:18:25.255 --> 06:18:25.835
To speak up.

06:18:26.195 --> 06:18:32.377
And I was told, Steve, they told me, let me advise you, don't touch this issue.

06:18:32.877 --> 06:18:33.897
It's a third rail.

06:18:34.037 --> 06:18:37.038
If you touch it, you'll vanish.

06:18:37.158 --> 06:18:38.219
I was given the same advice.

06:18:38.419 --> 06:18:38.599
Right.

06:18:39.239 --> 06:18:49.862
Um, you know, and, and look, and my, I really acknowledge you're taking the risk here because YouTube may totally demonetize you.

06:18:50.542 --> 06:18:52.522
Your, your income will be wiped out.

06:18:53.162 --> 06:18:55.843
Oh, his income will be wiped out.

06:18:55.863 --> 06:18:58.924
Oh, he won't have any alternative, but to use Patreon.

06:18:59.824 --> 06:19:01.945
Oh, his income will be wiped out.

06:19:02.445 --> 06:19:04.605
I wonder how he saw that coming.

06:19:05.105 --> 06:19:07.246
I wonder why Steve is bringing that up.

06:19:08.561 --> 06:19:10.682
because it's part of the planned narrative.

06:19:11.022 --> 06:19:16.745
It was part of the song, the little violin that Brett's been playing for the last three years now.

06:19:17.986 --> 06:19:23.969
My YouTube channel got canceled because I let Robert Malone and Steve Kersh speak out about the truth.

06:19:24.309 --> 06:19:25.209
What was the truth?

06:19:25.669 --> 06:19:29.331
Let's go back to the beginning and find out what the truth was, shall we?

06:19:30.712 --> 06:19:34.694
The truth was, hmm, censorship first.

06:19:37.375 --> 06:19:38.656
And we are unmasked.

06:19:38.736 --> 06:19:43.618
We are going to reveal a new secret as to how you too can be unmasked.

06:19:43.978 --> 06:19:48.060
You can be fully vaccinated with previous infection, like Robert Malone is.

06:19:48.440 --> 06:20:00.485
You can be fully vaccinated like Steve Kersh is, or you can use a prophylactic like ivermectin, and then you and your family can also enjoy a close proximity, mask-free existence.

06:20:02.446 --> 06:20:05.247
That's how they started this podcast, ladies and gentlemen.

06:20:07.447 --> 06:20:13.191
And what you're doing is trying to spread information that's all factual.

06:20:14.112 --> 06:20:15.313
But it goes against the narrative.

06:20:15.493 --> 06:20:17.174
But what choice is there?

06:20:17.214 --> 06:20:19.235
And so people are afraid to speak out.

06:20:19.636 --> 06:20:21.057
And everybody I asked

06:20:22.125 --> 06:20:28.548
Every single person I asked said, Steve, do not do this because you will get shot down.

06:20:28.868 --> 06:20:30.049
You will get gaslighted.

06:20:30.149 --> 06:20:31.329
People will not believe you.

06:20:32.010 --> 06:20:36.972
And you will, this message of early treatment then will never.

06:20:37.292 --> 06:20:38.653
You will get gaslighted.

06:20:38.673 --> 06:20:42.554
Is he just talking nonsense?

06:20:42.614 --> 06:20:44.235
Is he just throwing terms out there?

06:20:44.275 --> 06:20:48.017
He doesn't really know what they mean, or is he really trying to confuse people?

06:20:49.884 --> 06:20:55.708
If Steve comes out speaking against injuries due to the vaccine, how does he get gaslighted?

06:20:56.048 --> 06:20:57.008
What does that mean?

06:20:57.108 --> 06:20:58.629
You see what we're talking about here?

06:20:59.710 --> 06:21:00.871
There's an imprecision.

06:21:02.346 --> 06:21:03.787
that belies lying.

06:21:04.528 --> 06:21:04.928
Be heard.

06:21:05.208 --> 06:21:07.029
Yeah, but if not this, what?

06:21:07.209 --> 06:21:08.750
And if not now, when?

06:21:08.951 --> 06:21:10.312
That's really what it comes down to.

06:21:11.212 --> 06:21:11.452
Robert?

06:21:12.173 --> 06:21:12.593
Two things.

06:21:13.274 --> 06:21:21.119
The irony is that the RNA story went through this same thing, where it got suppressed and shut down and was considered to be crazy talk.

06:21:21.800 --> 06:21:22.080
OK?

06:21:22.240 --> 06:21:23.000
That's a small thing.

06:21:23.020 --> 06:21:23.341
Many years ago.

06:21:23.361 --> 06:21:23.961
Many years ago.

06:21:24.081 --> 06:21:24.742
That's a small thing.

06:21:25.482 --> 06:21:30.944
Um, riffing off of your speaker for the dead, just kind of what you're saying.

06:21:32.064 --> 06:21:38.467
Um, I just like to throw in that I'm in close contact with the, um, long hauler community.

06:21:39.867 --> 06:21:44.509
And, um, like your story, a member of that community recently committed suicide.

06:21:45.889 --> 06:21:50.431
And, um, there was a huge outpouring in social media

06:21:51.820 --> 06:22:03.745
particularly in LinkedIn, in the long hauler chat groups of other people that have been suffering long hauler syndrome that feel, you know, hopeless and helpless.

06:22:03.825 --> 06:22:09.708
This is, you know, the parameters of depression and are also at risk for suicide.

06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:17.771
And, um, so speaking, you were speaking to employees of it companies, um,

06:22:20.999 --> 06:22:26.901
If we can't allow these people to even have a voice, then they're completely disempowered.

06:22:27.121 --> 06:22:29.261
It's as if they are written out of history.

06:22:30.421 --> 06:22:45.845
And I think that if you want to make a case for a moral obligation, we must let these people who have no voice to at least speak to each other.

06:22:46.146 --> 06:22:47.746
If we're not going to listen to them as a

06:22:48.146 --> 06:22:49.747
And he's talking about long COVID.

06:22:49.767 --> 06:22:55.790
He's not talking about people who died of remdesivir and he's not talking about people who died of the shot or suffering from it.

06:22:56.250 --> 06:22:57.251
Public health community.

06:22:57.731 --> 06:23:00.033
Let's at least let them talk to each other.

06:23:00.253 --> 06:23:01.593
They have an absolute right.

06:23:01.974 --> 06:23:02.154
Yeah.

06:23:02.554 --> 06:23:03.234
Absolute right.

06:23:03.394 --> 06:23:05.616
These people are suffering, whatever they may be suffering from.

06:23:05.676 --> 06:23:08.397
They have an absolute right to discuss it with others who are suffering.

06:23:08.457 --> 06:23:08.797
Thank you.

06:23:09.578 --> 06:23:10.198
Absolute right.

06:23:10.698 --> 06:23:10.818
Yeah.

06:23:10.838 --> 06:23:13.060
I was trying to look for my, the, the message.

06:23:13.400 --> 06:23:13.460
Um,

06:23:14.481 --> 06:23:28.659
Yeah, well for what it's worth I'm getting these messages too and people are clearly losing their lives to suicide among other things because it's so horrible and how much worse does it make it when you're being gaslit and told that it isn't a thing and you're not allowed to talk to others.

06:23:29.520 --> 06:23:31.683
It's an impossibly cruel situation.

06:23:32.875 --> 06:23:34.716
All right, I think we have to bring this to a close.

06:23:34.837 --> 06:23:36.778
I think we've covered what we needed to cover.

06:23:37.018 --> 06:23:41.622
I must say I am very grateful to you both.

06:23:41.922 --> 06:23:44.865
I regard you both as extremely courageous for speaking up.

06:23:44.945 --> 06:23:46.946
This is not an easy topic to speak up on.

06:23:47.467 --> 06:23:49.088
I know it's not safe for any of us.

06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:56.614
I do hope that whatever it is that needs to coalesce out there to fix this problem, we'll hear what we're saying and figure out how to put it into motion.

06:23:56.634 --> 06:23:57.595
If we haven't gotten it right,

06:23:58.095 --> 06:23:58.896
then that's fine.

06:23:58.916 --> 06:24:01.217
There's some way to do this, and it's got to happen now.

06:24:01.297 --> 06:24:14.125
And frankly, the clock is ticking because every month that we don't do this or do something, we are giving COVID-19 time to evolve to become a permanent fellow traveler, which will be an absolute tragedy for humanity.

06:24:14.185 --> 06:24:16.666
So let's get on this immediately.

06:24:17.366 --> 06:24:18.727
Thanks for joining us on Dark Horse.

06:24:19.208 --> 06:24:20.468
Steve Kirsch, Robert Malone.

06:24:20.508 --> 06:24:20.829
Thank you.

06:24:21.069 --> 06:24:21.449
Thank you.

06:24:21.509 --> 06:24:22.810
I really appreciate it.

06:24:22.930 --> 06:24:25.871
Thank you for allowing us to be here.

06:24:25.992 --> 06:24:26.612
Be well, everyone.

06:24:29.195 --> 06:24:37.020
I want to remind you about the video that I started with, because those men that we just watched are not men that kept their arms straight.

06:24:38.641 --> 06:24:44.344
They are not men that stood up when should have been standing up, but they stood up a year too late.

06:24:45.745 --> 06:24:52.729
And I would argue that what we just watched right there was beyond a shadow of a doubt evidence that they didn't stand up at all.

06:24:54.036 --> 06:25:10.521
but they were actually part of this narrative, part of this theater, which was designed to make us believe that there was a gain of function virus, that it was released, that they did cover it up, that we needed the countermeasures, that everybody was just doing what they thought they had to do.

06:25:12.402 --> 06:25:14.183
And so we're stuck with where we are.

06:25:14.223 --> 06:25:18.404
It's an imperfect system, but you know, we got to work with what we got to work with, right, Robert?

06:25:19.864 --> 06:25:21.125
I don't believe that that's true.

06:25:22.526 --> 06:25:30.331
I believe that people like myself were standing up for what was right when it was time to stand up for what was right.

06:25:30.391 --> 06:25:41.879
Speaking out against transfection as an immunization when there was still hope because we were keeping our arms straight because we did what was right when it was time to do what was right.

06:25:43.200 --> 06:25:47.783
Not a year and a half later when they decided not to choose my company for an EUA.

06:25:49.304 --> 06:25:55.867
Not a year and a half later when my vaccine is already out there and I'm already being reviewed for the Nobel Prize.

06:25:57.648 --> 06:26:04.231
Not a year and a half later when my wife is still saying that my vaccine technology is saving the world.

06:26:05.492 --> 06:26:08.894
I came out immediately when I knew it was wrong.

06:26:09.354 --> 06:26:14.376
And then I learned the immunology and I learned the biology and I taught it to everybody I could.

06:26:15.437 --> 06:26:17.218
That was what I thought was the right thing to do.

06:26:18.632 --> 06:26:20.692
That's what I thought was keeping my arms straight.

06:26:21.593 --> 06:26:23.993
And this is what I mean by keeping my arms straight.

06:26:26.773 --> 06:26:32.754
After the season, the season ended, we needed a break, so we went to a beach.

06:26:47.734 --> 06:26:53.261
As he was going down the beach, going down these dunes, he saw a military group working out on the beach.

06:26:54.242 --> 06:26:58.267
It was about maybe 10, 15 lines, something like that.

06:26:58.748 --> 06:27:02.052
Each line maybe had about 10 or 20 army guys in it.

06:27:02.412 --> 06:27:03.734
So he started to walk a little closer.

06:27:04.801 --> 06:27:08.502
As he walked closer, he could see that the guys were drenched.

06:27:08.522 --> 06:27:10.263
They had on full army fatigue.

06:27:10.283 --> 06:27:13.064
They had all their weapon gear on, helmets on.

06:27:13.384 --> 06:27:15.325
But they were wet, and they had sand all over them.

06:27:15.565 --> 06:27:16.205
And he's watching.

06:27:16.246 --> 06:27:16.806
He saw something.

06:27:16.826 --> 06:27:18.766
They had these logs in their hands.

06:27:19.267 --> 06:27:21.508
And they were holding them up over their shoulders.

06:27:22.588 --> 06:27:25.829
Three, maybe six, seven minutes, something like that.

06:27:26.149 --> 06:27:27.530
Think about how long that burns.

06:27:28.391 --> 06:27:31.033
to hold your hands up like that and hold them straight.

06:27:31.053 --> 06:27:32.454
And they would hold them straight.

06:27:33.015 --> 06:27:34.536
Then they would curl them like this.

06:27:34.896 --> 06:27:47.426
They would get on the ground and do sit-ups together with them, put the log down, run into the ocean, swim around a buoy, come out, roll in the sand, run down the beach, run back, and do it all over again.

06:27:48.647 --> 06:27:54.912
And this thing happened as he's walking down to the beaches, maybe 10 more minutes, 15 more minutes going.

06:27:54.932 --> 06:27:56.354
Each group was doing this.

06:27:57.185 --> 06:28:01.986
Some of the sergeants and officers saw him sitting there, and they could recognize who the coach was, so they didn't mind him watching.

06:28:03.106 --> 06:28:04.806
Soon as he got closer, he realized something.

06:28:05.306 --> 06:28:06.347
All these guys look alike.

06:28:07.367 --> 06:28:12.708
Same height, got the same cell phone, but he thought, in football, how do I pick my stars?

06:28:13.048 --> 06:28:13.888
Who catches the ball?

06:28:14.608 --> 06:28:15.448
Who makes the tally?

06:28:16.468 --> 06:28:18.048
Who doesn't have too many missed assignments?

06:28:18.769 --> 06:28:20.229
You know, these are things that we judge you by.

06:28:20.269 --> 06:28:20.789
Who's taller?

06:28:20.809 --> 06:28:21.409
Who's shorter?

06:28:21.729 --> 06:28:22.569
Who has the heart?

06:28:23.049 --> 06:28:25.490
But all these guys look the same.

06:28:25.510 --> 06:28:26.970
And he was thinking,

06:28:27.543 --> 06:28:30.164
How do they pick who stays and who leaves?

06:28:30.564 --> 06:28:33.565
Because it was more than what a normal military group would have.

06:28:34.125 --> 06:28:34.925
But how do they pick?

06:28:35.786 --> 06:28:36.926
So he got closer and closer.

06:28:37.986 --> 06:28:39.687
Again, some of them had boats.

06:28:39.867 --> 06:28:41.427
Some of them had things that were holding them up again.

06:28:41.848 --> 06:28:50.170
Another three, six minutes, four minutes, doing the crunches, still holding their hands out straight, doing wall sit squats in the sand.

06:28:50.891 --> 06:28:55.012
And he came to the sergeant and he said, how do you pick who stays and who goes?

06:28:57.093 --> 06:28:58.653
And the sergeant looked at him and he smiled.

06:28:58.673 --> 06:29:00.434
He said, the ones who keep their arms straight.

06:29:01.994 --> 06:29:02.794
He said, excuse me?

06:29:02.834 --> 06:29:05.335
He said, the ones who keep their arms straight.

06:29:05.735 --> 06:29:08.316
He said, you don't think we go into battle with logs and boats, do you?

06:29:09.076 --> 06:29:10.436
Bullets are flying over your head.

06:29:10.716 --> 06:29:19.499
When adversity hits, when the firecrackers start going off, grenades, the ones who can stay in line, keep their arms straight through pressure, are the ones we want.

06:29:20.319 --> 06:29:21.659
Those are the ones that are going to have your back.

06:29:22.679 --> 06:29:25.020
So when adversity strikes you and they say you can't do it,

06:29:26.018 --> 06:29:27.258
When people you love doubt you.

06:29:27.999 --> 06:29:30.420
When it's fourth and one and we need a first down and we need to stop.

06:29:31.220 --> 06:29:32.961
When somebody's phone turns the ball over.

06:29:33.321 --> 06:29:36.442
When a penalty hits, you get backed up 15 more yards.

06:29:36.982 --> 06:29:37.963
And you gotta keep going.

06:29:38.163 --> 06:29:43.805
When we say run one more pass, when we say run off the field, who is keeping their arms straight?

06:29:45.546 --> 06:29:51.088
When adversity outside of football hits, and you have to come in here and do your job, are you keeping your arms straight?

06:29:52.059 --> 06:30:04.568
When somebody contacts you and says, shut up about remdesivir and tell everybody the spike protein is dangerous and you'll make money, you got to keep your arms straight.

06:30:06.129 --> 06:30:15.696
When somebody tells you that you're going to get fired if you don't shut up on your YouTube channel about the transfection, you got to keep your arms straight.

06:30:17.312 --> 06:30:24.337
When somebody insists that a billion people are gonna die and that we need to wear masks, you need to keep your arms straight.

06:30:25.398 --> 06:30:34.785
When somebody tells you that there's a gain-of-function virus that leaked out of a laboratory and it's causing millions of people to die, you gotta keep your arms straight.

06:30:36.867 --> 06:30:38.248
You gotta pull up your pants.

06:30:39.349 --> 06:30:41.710
You gotta light a candle and you gotta start reading.

06:30:42.391 --> 06:30:43.232
You gotta learn.

06:30:44.224 --> 06:30:51.190
You gotta take responsibility for being the adult that you are, and you gotta keep your arms straight for your family and for your friends.

06:30:52.651 --> 06:30:56.795
And so many adults on this planet did not keep their arms straight.

06:30:58.676 --> 06:31:09.325
And for the first time, unlike this coach here, who's telling us a very, very cool story,

06:31:10.262 --> 06:31:16.845
about training military guys and finding a way to get soldiers to be of the highest level.

06:31:19.146 --> 06:31:30.272
What I'm trying to suggest to you is that there are people who kept their arms straight in the face of adversity that was the pandemic, an unknown, a worst case scenario possibly.

06:31:31.664 --> 06:31:44.694
But there were people that kept their arms straight and knew that our sovereignty was paramount, that informed consent was paramount, and were smart enough to know that we were not being allowed to exercise informed consent.

06:31:46.415 --> 06:31:54.061
And that kept their arms straight and knew that an emergency was not a good enough excuse for us not to keep our arms straight.

06:31:59.201 --> 06:32:08.087
You need to reflect on the fact that there are some people in our midst who did not keep their arms straight and they are not being honest about it.

06:32:09.528 --> 06:32:19.655
And we need to make sure that these people do not continue to be influential until they apologize for not keeping their arms straight and they get back in line.

06:32:21.396 --> 06:32:22.677
They sit back down.

06:32:26.320 --> 06:32:27.721
That's what this stream is about.

06:32:29.855 --> 06:32:35.799
It's been taking me a long time to figure out what to do with myself now that I know that Robert F. Kennedy's book is about to end.

06:32:37.160 --> 06:32:40.943
Now that I know that I'm going to need to start shaking the can for money on the internet again.

06:32:41.444 --> 06:32:42.744
What are we really doing here?

06:32:44.786 --> 06:32:47.848
Well, ladies and gentlemen, what we're doing here is we're keeping our arms straight.

06:32:48.849 --> 06:32:55.374
We were standing up for the principles of freedom, of individual sovereignty, of parental sovereignty over their children.

06:32:58.442 --> 06:33:06.585
And we were standing up for fundamental biology, standing up for God's creation and the sacredness of it.

06:33:09.326 --> 06:33:26.071
And the active degradation that is going on right now by people like Robert Malone and Elon Musk and Brett Weinstein and all the other people who think that it's possible to augment such a complex mechanism as the human body, the human immune system, the human brain.

06:33:27.844 --> 06:33:32.327
This arrogance belies nothing.

06:33:35.150 --> 06:33:36.891
These people are just that.

06:33:37.772 --> 06:33:44.937
They're just power-hungry, fame-hungry, power-hungry monkeys.

06:33:46.658 --> 06:33:48.100
It's time for this to end.

06:33:49.100 --> 06:33:54.825
Identify the people that kept their arms straight and follow the people who kept their arms straight.

06:33:55.876 --> 06:34:02.600
Do not, do not underestimate how many of these people are still a danger to you and your family.

06:34:03.841 --> 06:34:06.002
They are not being honest.

06:34:07.323 --> 06:34:19.229
When people you love doubt you, when it's fourth and one and we need a first down and we need to stop, when somebody's phone turns the ball over, when a penalty hits you, you get backed up 15 more yards and you gotta keep going.

06:34:19.470 --> 06:34:25.093
When we say run one more pass, when we say run off the field, who is keeping their arms straight?

06:34:26.854 --> 06:34:32.417
When adversity outside of football hits, and you have to come in here and do your job, are you keeping your arms straight?

06:34:33.197 --> 06:34:36.019
Your families will depend on you to be that type of leader, man.

06:34:37.820 --> 06:34:39.561
That's what life has to teach you.

06:34:39.961 --> 06:34:41.902
That's what Colorado football will teach you.

06:34:42.222 --> 06:34:43.603
That's what these coaches will teach you.

06:34:43.923 --> 06:34:47.745
Listen, you've heard my story a million million times before.

06:34:47.845 --> 06:34:49.366
I've been with this man 17, 18 years.

06:34:51.347 --> 06:34:52.247
Pee-wee football.

06:34:54.676 --> 06:34:56.977
How many people wanted to be next to him, wanted my job?

06:34:57.537 --> 06:34:58.757
But guess what I did they couldn't do?

06:35:00.118 --> 06:35:00.958
I kept my arms straight.

06:35:02.218 --> 06:35:03.558
I didn't worry about what people were saying.

06:35:03.979 --> 06:35:05.139
I didn't worry about what people were doing.

06:35:05.559 --> 06:35:07.139
We just told you about believing in yourself.

06:35:07.480 --> 06:35:08.640
Keep your arms straight.

06:35:08.920 --> 06:35:10.961
When stuff start happening, people say you can't do it.

06:35:11.181 --> 06:35:14.502
When we face adversity this year, keep your arms straight.

06:35:14.762 --> 06:35:15.682
Do the right techniques.

06:35:16.702 --> 06:35:17.562
Make the right plays.

06:35:17.602 --> 06:35:18.523
Make the right execution.

06:35:18.983 --> 06:35:21.523
You do that in life, nothing will ever stop you.

06:35:21.804 --> 06:35:23.384
But once you start listening to everybody else,

06:35:23.757 --> 06:35:29.800
and the whistle's coming over your head, the bullets flying by you, and you cower in the corner, people then will label you.

06:35:31.401 --> 06:35:32.502
I'll label them right now.

06:35:33.902 --> 06:35:35.403
I'll label those people right now.

06:35:36.864 --> 06:35:40.225
The people that put on the bandanas like Brett Weinstein.

06:35:41.566 --> 06:35:49.070
The people who said they took the shot because ADE signal wasn't there and didn't care about any other signal like Brett or like Robert Malone.

06:35:50.411 --> 06:35:52.732
People didn't know better like Steve Kirsch.

06:35:56.778 --> 06:36:05.449
I blame them for not keeping their arms straight, but I don't blame people that followed them for not keeping their arms straight.

06:36:06.786 --> 06:36:12.870
They were part of an elaborate scheme to make it very hard for you and I to keep our arms straight.

06:36:13.570 --> 06:36:27.499
Robert Malone, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, all of the people on PBS NewsHour were all part of an elaborate scheme to make it very hard for us to keep our arms straight.

06:36:33.103 --> 06:36:34.164
But I believe in us.

06:36:35.407 --> 06:36:36.728
I believe in Team Human.

06:36:37.648 --> 06:36:39.409
I believe that we're going to overcome.

06:36:39.429 --> 06:36:44.953
I believe that there's a possibility that Team Human's gonna win.

06:36:46.053 --> 06:36:52.717
But we've got to make sure we realize who kept their arms straight and get them out of leadership positions.

06:36:53.297 --> 06:36:54.378
Stop following them.

06:36:54.778 --> 06:36:57.380
Stop sharing their substacks and reading their Twitters.

06:36:57.980 --> 06:36:58.740
Just stop.

06:36:59.981 --> 06:37:02.863
There's lots of people out there worth following.

06:37:03.834 --> 06:37:10.257
And I don't think that the three guys on this podcast were the ones to follow.

06:37:11.178 --> 06:37:14.800
I don't think these three guys right here were the ones to follow.

06:37:16.493 --> 06:37:17.333
That's my message.

06:37:18.274 --> 06:37:20.115
I just think you shouldn't follow them anymore.

06:37:21.015 --> 06:37:23.456
I don't think they're the leaders that they claim to be.

06:37:24.117 --> 06:37:28.499
And I think this three hour video shows exactly why that's the case.

06:37:29.079 --> 06:37:30.520
They didn't have the insight.

06:37:30.540 --> 06:37:32.681
They didn't try to teach you.

06:37:33.341 --> 06:37:34.562
They didn't try to save us.

06:37:35.442 --> 06:37:38.583
They limited, they limited the narrative.

06:37:39.183 --> 06:37:40.963
They limited the possibilities.

06:37:41.603 --> 06:37:44.824
And they focused us on things that wouldn't help us escape.

06:37:45.264 --> 06:37:46.164
You have to see it.

06:37:46.684 --> 06:37:47.165
I see it.

06:37:47.185 --> 06:37:48.465
I hope you see it.

06:37:48.985 --> 06:37:50.245
Thanks very much for joining me.

06:37:50.265 --> 06:37:52.186
It's been Giga Home Biological.

06:37:52.426 --> 06:37:58.147
A high resistance, low noise information stream brought to you by a biologist.
