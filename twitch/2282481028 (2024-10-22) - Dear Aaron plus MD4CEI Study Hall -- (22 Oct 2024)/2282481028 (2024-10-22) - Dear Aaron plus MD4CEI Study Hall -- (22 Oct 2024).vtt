WEBVTT

00:20.066 --> 00:21.008
Testing one, two.

00:21.149 --> 00:21.971
Test one, two.

01:02.887 --> 01:12.235
And on the eighth day, God looked down on his planned paradise and said, I need a caretaker.

01:15.498 --> 01:16.478
So God made a farmer.

01:19.321 --> 01:28.168
God said, I need somebody willing to get up before dawn, milk cows, work all day in the fields, milk cows again, eat supper, then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board.

01:28.248 --> 01:29.169
So God made a farmer.

01:32.910 --> 01:37.492
I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle a calf and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.

01:37.752 --> 01:47.855
Somebody to call hogs, tame cantankerous machinery, come home hungry, have to wait lunch until his wife's done feeding visiting ladies, then tell the ladies to be sure and come back real soon and mean it."

01:48.175 --> 01:49.115
So God made a farmer.

01:53.997 --> 02:02.280
God said, I need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt and watch it die and dry his eyes and say, maybe next year.

02:04.170 --> 02:20.017
I need somebody who can shape an axe handle from a persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who can make harness out of hay wire, feed sacks, and shoe scraps, who, planting time and harvest season, will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then paint him from tractor back, put in another 72 hours."

02:20.097 --> 02:21.057
So God made a farmer.

02:23.639 --> 02:33.643
God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor's place.

02:35.185 --> 02:36.186
So God made a farmer.

02:38.147 --> 02:49.874
God said, I need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales, yet gentle enough to yeen lambs and wean pigs and tend to pink-combed pullets who will stop his mower for an hour to splint the broken leg of a meadow lark.

02:50.888 --> 02:54.109
It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners.

02:54.369 --> 03:05.533
Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake, and disc, and plow, and plant, and tie the fleece, and strain the milk, and replenish the self-feeder, and finish a hard week's work with a five-mile drive to church.

03:06.954 --> 03:20.099
Somebody who'd bail a family together with a soft, strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says,

03:21.340 --> 03:25.563
that he wants to spend his life doing what Dad does.

03:27.724 --> 03:28.785
So God made a farmer.

03:54.577 --> 03:55.778
you you

04:19.845 --> 04:20.105
you.

05:04.109 --> 05:24.834
The next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of America, of the American people,

05:25.655 --> 05:31.777
Is being used to create the crisis they need to divide and conquer us to ruin Maybe america.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.858
I don't know Crash the dollar.

05:34.058 --> 05:38.980
I don't know steal the rest of our our what limited treasury value we have left.

05:39.180 --> 05:49.303
I don't know But I know for sure that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health

05:49.992 --> 06:00.083
and access to health care to create a crisis, to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

07:42.344 --> 07:42.685
Yeah.

08:28.150 --> 08:28.531
Yeah.

09:53.269 --> 09:53.469
do

11:41.237 --> 11:43.198
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

11:44.299 --> 11:49.022
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.144
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

11:53.780 --> 11:54.490
It's embarrassing.

12:12.895 --> 12:13.915
Good morning, everyone.

12:13.935 --> 12:14.575
It is 1146.

12:14.615 --> 12:18.576
I snuck in under the bell or before the bell.

12:18.616 --> 12:23.157
It is still the morning here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the USA.

12:23.177 --> 12:27.758
I'm still running in the hamster wheels, still trying to save people from them.

12:28.798 --> 12:30.778
I hope this message finds you well.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.519
Your consciousness is still the prime real estate.

12:34.199 --> 12:38.220
Your attention is still the prime real estate these people are competing for.

12:39.680 --> 12:45.825
and military programs have been deployed after a generation of charlatanism.

12:47.126 --> 12:52.831
They have upped the stakes because they can and because we have willingly complied.

12:53.051 --> 12:55.693
These charlatans now have the added ability

12:56.454 --> 13:07.980
to deploy all kinds of illusions of consensus on social media, which can lead us all kinds of places we don't need to go and definitely teach us all kinds of things we shouldn't be teaching our kids.

13:08.540 --> 13:09.741
And so that's why I'm here.

13:09.901 --> 13:16.084
And that's why I think a lot of other people are here still fighting for the illusion to be broken.

13:16.125 --> 13:22.108
Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

13:22.788 --> 13:28.753
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminal, and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

13:28.793 --> 13:37.520
This illusion must be broken and not be taught to our kids, or they will be enslaved by this same lively debate within that same limited spectrum.

13:38.240 --> 13:44.425
And what Noam Chomsky refers to as a limited spectrum of debate, I gotta say, is actually just a mythology.

13:44.886 --> 13:47.568
It doesn't need to be a limited spectrum of truth.

13:48.048 --> 13:50.891
It can be a limited spectrum of lies, and actually,

13:51.491 --> 14:01.666
Because of social media, we have transitioned from this model that Noam Chomsky may have been very honest about, where it's a limited spectrum of debate about something true.

14:02.167 --> 14:07.835
We have now transitioned into a time when military programs are able to convince us of things that are not true.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.557
We got into a car with a bunch of strangers and let them drive us around.

14:11.957 --> 14:15.179
And we even thought what we saw outside of the windows was real, but it wasn't.

14:15.219 --> 14:16.239
They were all screens.

14:16.279 --> 14:17.200
They were all illusions.

14:17.280 --> 14:32.148
Even the people that we met on the way, the cops that arrested us, all the things that happened at the wayside, all of those things were an elaborate illusion to get us to believe this kind of nonsense, to believe that a mystery virus is responsible for excess deaths.

14:32.188 --> 14:33.748
I almost lost my coffee there.

14:36.636 --> 14:37.319
I did it again.

14:37.339 --> 14:41.173
It's always starting out so fast, but that's what they wanted.

14:41.193 --> 14:42.257
They wanted us to rush in.

14:44.044 --> 14:47.306
And these excess deaths are just not explainable by that.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.848
They are explainable by expected excess deaths.

14:49.908 --> 14:59.934
And then a little military operation, some murder and lies to sweep them together and create some sharp peaks that could be misconstrued as a spreading novel pathogen.

15:00.014 --> 15:03.296
Unfortunately, the epidemiology doesn't line up.

15:03.456 --> 15:07.998
Unfortunately, there are ways, I should say fortunately,

15:09.059 --> 15:10.099
There are ways out.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.020
There are legal ways out, especially in America.

15:13.060 --> 15:20.003
We're going to discuss some of those today very briefly, um, and pass along some reading material.

15:20.063 --> 15:22.564
That's usually, I think the best way to do it.

15:22.604 --> 15:24.205
People don't need to take my word for it.

15:24.245 --> 15:31.727
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule, about transfection and what it was before the pandemic and about what RNA can and cannot do.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.329
We also need a new consensus about them, their murder and lies.

15:36.009 --> 15:36.069
Um,

15:37.813 --> 15:41.596
These people have created an illusion of consensus and now they are sustaining it.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.776
They are clinging to it.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.818
That's why today I actually got accused of being a bigot.

15:45.978 --> 15:46.859
Can you imagine that?

15:46.879 --> 15:59.087
I don't even know what my, the exact quantification of the amount of watercolor that was mixed together in the form of my background with my mom and my dad and my grandparents.

15:59.127 --> 16:07.093
I don't, it's funny to be called a bigot today on X. But I was, and it's fun times, fun times where

16:07.933 --> 16:26.486
The effective manipulation of the masses that was first described by Edward Bernays and later by other people like Aldous Huxley and later by Noam Chomsky has become a fine samurai sword that can be used to divide and conquer the population like slicing a melon.

16:27.486 --> 16:36.493
And they are doing it now with brutal efficiency and if we allow these acolytes to, if we allow our children rather, to inherit

16:37.509 --> 16:44.033
this kind of governance, we are going to be in big trouble and they will be enslaved.

16:45.054 --> 16:45.995
I'm convinced of that.

16:46.015 --> 16:56.342
I don't know any other language to choose other than they will be enslaved by these acolytes on social media and how social media is used against us.

16:57.686 --> 17:08.296
And as we argue with these people and accept their argument and accept their questions and the answers that they propose, the narrative of the state is enforced.

17:09.137 --> 17:12.961
Maybe multiple sides of the narrative, but you never get out of the trap.

17:13.001 --> 17:15.123
You're just running around in circles against the fence.

17:17.648 --> 17:27.599
If you're participating in it, they might have even given you a motorcycle and let you ride around in concentric circles on the inside of the great metal sphere that is the narrative.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.003
But you are not effectively going anywhere.

17:32.179 --> 17:43.991
And it's taken me a long time to admit that I was actually so stuck in this that I would have bought into almost every, I did buy into almost everything they were selling at the beginning of the pandemic.

17:44.011 --> 17:50.338
I have a long track record that is freely available on the National Library of Medicine PubMed website.

17:51.359 --> 17:54.982
You can see how long I was trying to chase tenure by looking at

17:55.763 --> 18:03.046
neuronal connections under a microscope by working on mice and monkeys and a little bit of human tissue in Rotterdam.

18:05.486 --> 18:07.887
The name GigaOM Biological is derived from that work.

18:07.927 --> 18:17.711
You can go to stream.gigaom.bio and find our own personal archive of our work, Houston Tonic and I.

18:21.869 --> 18:33.771
Full disclosure, Mark Hucytonic has now, for the past couple months, donated $100 a month to me, which I have turned around, of course, and put into this, which costs more than $100 a month to maintain.

18:35.351 --> 18:48.674
And so, yeah, we have a server, we have our own database, we have our own suggested reading, and we are trying to get a momentum going with regard to Biology 101 and Uncertainty 101, an auditing course.

18:49.514 --> 18:53.277
course audit of my friend Matt Briggs on Substack.

18:54.398 --> 18:57.441
And that's all on our own website where you don't have to log in.

18:57.481 --> 18:59.282
You don't have to give your information.

19:00.023 --> 19:06.808
It says that your IP address is being used to share with other people, but that's just the nature of how PeerTube works.

19:06.828 --> 19:09.010
When you watch a video, it's not stealing anything.

19:09.070 --> 19:10.131
I'm not stealing anything.

19:10.171 --> 19:11.972
Nobody's stealing anything that I know of.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.099
Probably didn't sound very convincing.

19:16.181 --> 19:19.568
Let me get over here and Let me see.

19:19.608 --> 19:21.091
Oh, yeah, I move my buttons over here.

19:21.131 --> 19:23.716
I got to do this then I got to do that I got rid of a

19:25.629 --> 19:27.189
I made a very Hello, my name is Jonathan Koo.

19:27.229 --> 19:28.910
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

19:28.930 --> 19:30.170
This is GigaOM Biological.

19:30.750 --> 19:34.671
It is a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

19:34.811 --> 19:45.994
I have been continuously juggling a Craigslist collection of technology, which enables me to do some of the, what are very mundane tricks on this, um,

19:47.282 --> 19:53.065
on this stream that include like changing over to different screens, that kind of thing, having me down at the bottom.

19:53.885 --> 20:00.748
Those tricks are pretty rudimentary if you know what equipment is required for it and then you just look for it on Craigslist for a while.

20:01.889 --> 20:07.092
But nevertheless, it's been an ongoing kind of thing to get this to work correctly.

20:07.132 --> 20:09.533
I think I'm pretty happy with the way things are working now.

20:10.733 --> 20:12.274
And so I'm excited to be here.

20:12.915 --> 20:24.402
I've got a few interesting points to hit and just to start it off, the presentation that I gave to the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International, MD4CEI,

20:29.892 --> 20:37.565
That presentation that I gave yesterday was originally invited by Stephen Frost, the chairman of that, the founder of that little group.

20:38.026 --> 20:41.031
It was originally an invitation to explain

20:43.166 --> 20:50.728
or introduce everybody to, or I don't know, I think the best way to say it would have been explain the Human Genome Project.

20:50.788 --> 20:57.370
Now, at first, knowing what I knew I wanted to say, I agreed to it.

20:57.610 --> 21:06.493
But as I got closer and closer to Sunday, it became clear to me that, wow, if I would have really gone for the target,

21:07.493 --> 21:15.025
as accurately described as explaining the Human Genome Project, boy that would have been a tremendous face plant.

21:18.536 --> 21:40.572
I'm very free to admit that there is a level of technological detail and methodological detail and a methodological history that I'm sure has many, many punctuated landmarks that I would not be able to explain in sufficient enough detail to convince you that I was an expert on all of them, because I'm not an expert on all of them.

21:41.292 --> 22:04.288
And I'm sure that there are people within the context of this narrative who could take a shot at a few of them, but only one or two people that is in front of the fake cameras right now would be able to really enunciate what would appear like a coherent narrative about what the Human Genome Project was, how it fell short, and where we are now.

22:04.869 --> 22:06.410
Mark Lander might be able to do it.

22:08.797 --> 22:34.524
Maybe Kevin Esvelt might be able to do it and Kevin McKernan and now I mentioned Kevin McKernan in that talk and we will I'm not sure if we're gonna do a whole study hall on it or not but I do want to explain why the video on Rumble has a person presenting before me about something that it seems to be kind of absurd and understand that in the context of what's going on and how close we are to the entire

22:36.465 --> 22:38.626
to the entire theater starting to break down.

22:39.047 --> 22:40.628
And that's really what's happening right now.

22:40.668 --> 22:47.232
And I don't wanna be overexcited about it because of the nature and the timescale of the battle that we're fighting.

22:47.773 --> 23:05.444
This is just, it's kind of still meaningless, but for now, the collection of performers that has been in front of us, especially acutely in front of us on X and on YouTube and on a few other of these social media, like Rumble,

23:06.468 --> 23:14.954
These people are now beyond... It's possible for you to see them now, and I think more and more people are seeing them.

23:19.197 --> 23:24.680
I'm babysitting a pot of coffee, which I just, for the love of coffee, I cannot let go cool.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.642
So I gotta kind of keep this up here.

23:29.003 --> 23:30.184
I'll get us off the starship.

23:31.804 --> 23:34.647
And the first thing I want to start with, oh, I didn't get us off the starship.

23:34.687 --> 23:42.293
The first thing I want to start with is a, is a Dear Aaron Seery part.

23:44.755 --> 23:46.196
It's the 22nd of October, 2024.

23:46.657 --> 23:58.227
And I have been trying my best in the context of recovering from the pandemic and recovering from

23:59.266 --> 24:06.194
I don't know, more than a decade of trying to get tenure in the context of an academic medical school environment.

24:07.956 --> 24:12.340
I have also been trying to come to better understand the

24:14.585 --> 24:37.477
come to better understand the American legal system as it matters to me, or as it matters to this, or as it matters to this biology, especially as I've come to understand, and this is key, that before the pandemic, there were already plenty of people, already for plenty of years, that had come and gone, that had said that the vaccine schedule was terrible.

24:38.743 --> 24:44.144
women and men, parents with injured kids or just doctors.

24:44.965 --> 24:46.265
There've been lots of people.

24:47.325 --> 24:56.908
There were famous holistic doctors in Chicago while I was a Chicagoan running around, you know, bartending and high school teaching.

24:56.948 --> 25:00.889
There were doctors in Chicago that weren't vaccinating their patients.

25:04.386 --> 25:14.434
And so for me, one of the most humbling things about going back into this history is realizing that there were plenty of people who knew this for a very, very, very, very long time.

25:16.016 --> 25:19.499
And that the people that are in front of us now were put in front of us.

25:20.299 --> 25:21.200
They had to have been.

25:21.961 --> 25:25.864
And the more I dig, and the more that I put everything in line,

25:27.392 --> 25:43.222
It doesn't make any sense other than to say that a lot of people have known that this biology is bunk, this immunomythology is an illusion, and there have never been any of these people that have risen to break the illusion.

25:43.282 --> 25:52.968
And instead, we have the only people that have been able to sustain any level of existence have never usefully questioned that illusion as the primary flag they carry.

25:53.817 --> 25:54.337
Just hasn't.

25:54.417 --> 26:00.902
Anybody that's carried the flag of vaccines and the idea of a vaccine in general is very bad.

26:01.482 --> 26:06.125
If it's intramuscularly injected, these people are not, they're not around anymore.

26:10.508 --> 26:21.916
And it's pretty striking because now I think also it has become clear to me that the people that are playing or pretending to play on our side with the ESQ after their name,

26:23.283 --> 26:30.106
Esquire, that's a lawyer, people with law degrees may not be playing a fair game.

26:30.146 --> 26:43.112
And it's frustrating because it has taken me, this pandemic, and meeting people and friends and making friends with people that I trust that consistently help me, that watch my back,

26:43.772 --> 26:58.665
that criticize me in a useful way have also, some of those people I've consulted for on trials and on court proceedings or court documents, provided affidavits, and those people answer my questions in earnest.

27:00.946 --> 27:04.509
And after a great deal of searching and

27:06.500 --> 27:19.462
A lot of it searching in the dark because this stuff is not out there and readily available for the simple fact that this has been an ongoing battle in the intellectual space for many, many years, many, many years before the pandemic.

27:23.503 --> 27:30.584
It's way more than trillions of dollars at stake here, ladies and gentlemen, if the whole vaccine schedule could be put under question on its face.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.805
That the very idea is dumb.

27:37.014 --> 27:46.227
And so if there are people, and you can bet your bottom dollar, there were people that knew exactly this and that were saying it exactly like that, that are no longer with us.

27:46.968 --> 27:53.077
Anybody that said it like I'm saying it right now, like a lot of people have said it, they're gone.

27:56.977 --> 28:13.517
And everybody else that has been allowed to say it, or kind of said it, has then gone on never to repeat it, but instead gone right back to selling their book, or right back to selling their spike protein cures, or right back to saying that the spike protein is present in people who had COVID, or right back to

28:13.997 --> 28:20.243
Long COVID they only say it one time on one obscure Podcast and then it's never said again.

28:20.323 --> 28:29.192
It's not like they repeat it every time they get on a podcast first and foremost I'd like to say we've got to stop Americans taking these giving their kids shots.

28:29.212 --> 28:33.196
We got to stop it all Nobody's saying that

28:35.819 --> 28:40.105
And none of these lawyers are saying certain things that I think are really important.

28:40.185 --> 28:47.897
So, without further ado, let me first and foremost say that on my website, at the homepage,

28:49.488 --> 28:52.229
You can now, I did, of course, you know, it was kind of dumb.

28:52.829 --> 28:57.810
At first, I had this stuff link all the way down here at the bottom, which it still is.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.491
If you can see my arrow, I think you can.

28:59.651 --> 29:02.612
If you can see my arrow right here, the stuff link is down here at the bottom.

29:03.052 --> 29:05.013
But now I put it also here up at the top.

29:05.093 --> 29:11.654
If your browser or your screen or whatever doesn't open wide enough, then it'll be more, and then you'll have to pull the more down.

29:11.714 --> 29:12.955
So maybe I'll put stuff

29:13.635 --> 29:21.099
You know, over here at home, and then livestream, and then 101, and then Soapbox, and then stuff already, and then it'll always be visible even on a phone.

29:21.259 --> 29:21.640
I don't know.

29:22.180 --> 29:30.465
But it's there in a couple places, and if you click on that link, stuff, you will find our Biology 101 text, which will, I think, are always going to remain at the top.

29:31.666 --> 29:42.696
The book that I recommended that everybody read at the beginning of my presentation yesterday for the Doctors, Stephen Frost's group, was this book and that's easily downloadable there.

29:42.756 --> 29:46.439
I also mentioned this book there and I also mentioned that book there.

29:46.519 --> 29:48.942
So all three of them, again, you guys know are available.

29:49.362 --> 29:53.165
If you go down one little thing, you're going to see random tort law stuff.

29:53.846 --> 30:02.848
And this says, here's some reading for fans of Aaron Seery, ICANN, Children's Health Defense, and any other law firm, lawyer, or organization claiming to fight on our behalf.

30:03.428 --> 30:10.330
And the thing that I want to look at is called Gallo, Getting to Market the Scientific and Legal Climate for Developing Vaccines.

30:11.090 --> 30:19.932
Now, what's really interesting about this particular paper is, no, this one, is that

30:24.935 --> 30:26.456
It's written by Robert Gallo.

30:28.698 --> 30:33.903
And I might have to, just a second here, make sure I remember what year it is written.

30:41.742 --> 30:50.012
It is written in 1987 and so that means that it's after the National Vaccine Safety Act or whatever the hell it was called, which we'll talk about in here.

30:50.612 --> 30:54.517
Now you can find this article also freely available online.

30:54.617 --> 30:58.602
I'll just scroll up again so that you can probably do it for yourself.

30:59.182 --> 31:07.552
It's at the Scholarly Commons of the Boston University Law School, summer of 1987, getting to market the scientific and legal climate for developing an AIDS vaccine.

31:08.072 --> 31:10.135
Now, what would really be quite frightening, right?

31:10.635 --> 31:16.662
It would be really, really frightening, in my humble opinion, if this article were to describe the

31:17.563 --> 31:24.225
legal situation that we're in better than Aaron Siri can, or better than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

31:24.265 --> 31:26.666
can, or better than Mary Holland can.

31:27.126 --> 31:30.727
All of these really prominent and outspoken lawyers.

31:30.807 --> 31:36.609
Mary Holland is speaking for the exact same Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International today at 3 p.m.

31:39.812 --> 31:58.099
a lawyer, somebody who was on Democracy Now in 2015, claiming that her son was injured by a specific vaccine and probably a specific component of it, arguing for a testing of vaccines.

31:58.239 --> 32:07.683
And we have not made any progress from that very disingenuous fake attack on this immunomythology.

32:08.763 --> 32:22.032
limiting it to we better test people, we better test the vaccines, maybe it's a component of the vaccine, and that's the hamster wheel that they have managed to get us to run in for 10 years, to get us to here now, where it's still about free speech.

32:26.195 --> 32:30.798
And that magic trick is a doorway to our enslavement.

32:30.818 --> 32:34.440
If we don't get out of that hamster wheel now, in the next year or two,

32:36.155 --> 32:44.457
while the chaos is still high enough, while the disbelief and the mistrust is high enough that anyone that hears the truth can potentially hear it?

32:47.358 --> 32:54.480
This is an article from 1987, not written by a lawyer, but written by the guy who apparently discovered the AIDS virus.

32:54.980 --> 33:00.461
And he's talking about the legal climate in America with regard to developing an AIDS vaccine.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.062
Hmm, I wonder what we're gonna find here.

33:09.858 --> 33:12.361
Let's go down and here it is.

33:12.441 --> 33:17.307
The expectations of a vaccine to prevent acquired immune deficiency syndrome are rising.

33:18.309 --> 33:25.818
Not only are the prospects for an effective immunogen improving, but immunization appears to hold the greatest promise for halting the spread of infection and disease.

33:27.310 --> 33:40.193
Identification of the causal agent of the retrovirus called HTLV-3, LAV, or generically HIV, has provided the direction and limited the options for containing the disease.

33:40.233 --> 33:42.733
Well, there you already see something you don't see every day.

33:44.614 --> 33:53.536
Apparently, the virus that Judy Mikovits and her boss, Ruschetti, worked on is related to, or maybe the same as, HIV.

33:53.896 --> 33:55.716
HIV might be a general word.

34:00.731 --> 34:02.231
So do you see what we're doing here already?

34:02.271 --> 34:03.412
You're already seeing it.

34:04.292 --> 34:11.653
It is a hiding of the truth in plain sight where our immune system already uses retroviruses.

34:11.753 --> 34:25.356
They identified that process, maybe, uh, through, through intramuscular exposure to related particles from related animals or related preparations that interfered with this or misregulated it.

34:25.476 --> 34:25.876
And then now,

34:30.575 --> 34:49.961
We move forward with a disease that is somehow or another based on the transmission of retroviruses that just happened to attack our T-cells, attack our T-cells, as opposed to being an aberrant form of an endogenous communication that's always there.

34:50.916 --> 35:00.542
but would be potentially vulnerable to exposure to the related signals in related animals, if related animals have related signals.

35:05.766 --> 35:09.448
We're not here to talk about AIDS, though, so don't worry, Aaron, I'll get right to it for you.

35:12.110 --> 35:16.292
Hopefully we will get some responses from Aaron on this one.

35:16.312 --> 35:17.272
We're just going to go down.

35:17.332 --> 35:22.954
This is just an article written by, you know, I mean, I think you should download it and read it yourself.

35:23.114 --> 35:25.055
Like I said, I'm a biology coach.

35:25.235 --> 35:27.636
I'm not going to do the exercises with you.

35:28.956 --> 35:33.578
And I'm not going to do the exercises for you, but I can recommend what exercises you should do.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.879
And I think this is one that you ought to do.

35:36.899 --> 35:41.541
This is a whole set of exercises that we all ought to be doing.

35:41.641 --> 35:45.543
So let's get in here.

35:46.043 --> 35:46.643
Let's get in it.

35:48.038 --> 35:51.642
Tort liability for vaccine-related injury.

35:51.662 --> 35:57.249
Let's see if I can get a pen here.

35:57.309 --> 35:57.770
Highlight.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.252
Let's just do a pen.

36:00.333 --> 36:00.553
No.

36:01.074 --> 36:01.354
Pen.

36:01.975 --> 36:02.195
There.

36:02.616 --> 36:02.896
Draw.

36:03.357 --> 36:03.677
Perfect.

36:05.640 --> 36:13.862
The scientific and ethical issues surrounding the testing of candidate vaccines are complicated by uncertainty about the potential liability for adverse reactions to any such vaccine.

36:14.623 --> 36:16.203
The uncertainty is twofold.

36:16.403 --> 36:29.327
Uncertainty as to the legal principles that will be applied if a vaccine injures or is thought to injure any recipient or uncertainty and uncertainty as to what legal principles ought to apply in such a case.

36:30.376 --> 36:44.499
This concern undoubtedly stems from recognition that adverse reactions are sure to follow vaccination with AIDS vaccine, if not during clinical trials, then after a licensed vaccine is marketed.

36:45.559 --> 36:47.759
So he's talking about an AIDS vaccine here.

36:49.960 --> 36:55.961
And it's important to hear that he's talking about an AIDS vaccine here because as he shifts to generally speaking,

36:56.846 --> 37:09.976
what the issues are with regard to strict liability and pharmaceutical products, or strict liability and a vaccine, there are a few principles that will jump out, and a few words that will jump out.

37:10.657 --> 37:20.904
And just so you're aware, if we go already, I have the latest Aaron Seery claim right here, and we look for the word strict, it's not in the whole document.

37:21.465 --> 37:22.826
Not one time strict.

37:23.803 --> 37:30.925
That pretty much means that strict scrutiny and strict liability as legal terms will not be in this document.

37:30.965 --> 37:41.188
And in fact, you can confirm that yourself by downloading Aaron Seary's document and seeing that in his case and in all the language, he doesn't talk about that.

37:42.689 --> 37:50.992
And that's a problem if we're to believe that this guy from Goldman Sachs is actually fighting on our behalf with ICANN.

37:54.062 --> 37:54.902
And so we're here now.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.183
Just roll up.

37:57.603 --> 38:04.786
Producers and manufacturers of vaccines may be held liable for injuries resulting from their products in strict liability or in negligence.

38:06.047 --> 38:06.247
What?

38:06.787 --> 38:07.227
Sorry, what?

38:07.907 --> 38:16.631
Producers and manufacturers of vaccines may be held liable for injuries resulting from their products in strict liability or in negligence.

38:18.891 --> 38:44.067
Is Robert Gallo, the scientist who brought us the HIV virus, about to explain the legal landscape of vaccines better than Aaron Seery or Mary Holland or Children's Health Defense have ever managed to write down on their website or on any publication or in any trial document ever?

38:45.068 --> 38:46.069
Oh, yes, he is.

38:47.003 --> 38:49.564
Oh yes, oh yes, definitely he is.

38:52.764 --> 39:04.567
Strict liability is imposed when the product has a defect that renders it unreasonably dangerous as measured by the expectations of the vaccine recipient or the consumer.

39:07.148 --> 39:10.829
Three categories of defects may give rise to strict liability.

39:11.389 --> 39:15.950
Manufacturing flaws, defects in design,

39:17.199 --> 39:22.663
and inadequate directions for use or warnings of risks.

39:25.865 --> 39:32.130
I wonder how many times you've heard the combination of words together from any of these posers in America.

39:32.951 --> 39:34.532
Duty to warn.

39:39.895 --> 39:51.261
A manufacturer may be held liable for negligence when it failed to exercise the appropriate level of care required of it in producing the product and, as a result, the product causing actual injury.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.501
That's manufacturing flaws.

39:52.982 --> 40:00.085
Liability for failing to provide an adequate warning of vaccine risks has a long and controversial history.

40:00.145 --> 40:01.066
Wow, you'd never know.

40:02.066 --> 40:14.441
However, in view of the somewhat greater ease of avoiding liability on this ground, and its limited effect on decisions concerning what type of vaccine to produce, it will not be considered here.

40:21.862 --> 40:29.147
For years, vaccines were thought to be exempt from strict liability for design defects and liability for negligence in design.

40:29.587 --> 40:40.854
But that assumption has been soundly criticized, most recently in the Toner v. Leaderly Laboratories decision by the Supreme Court of Idaho in February of 1987.

40:42.415 --> 40:57.086
These decisions raise the possibility of subjecting vaccine manufacturers to liability for injury resulting from defects in vaccine design on the grounds that the risks associated with the vaccine could have been avoided had a different vaccine been produced.

40:58.987 --> 41:09.535
That sounds kind of eerily similar to what might happen now if we blame Pfizer for having produced the selected the spike protein or Moderna for selecting the spike protein.

41:12.421 --> 41:22.947
This has caused concern among prospective vaccine producers that their financial exposure for possible unforeseeable adverse reactions may outweigh their potential revenues from marketing the vaccine.

41:24.568 --> 41:34.774
Potential liability for design defects can influence decisions about what types of immunogens, sorry,

41:38.342 --> 41:52.031
What types of immunogens ought to be studied, the duration of animal and clinical trials, the population targeted to test immunogens in clinical trials, whether to seek FDA approval, a candidate vaccine, and whether and how to market and monitor a licensed vaccine.

41:52.752 --> 42:06.541
The concern is that the pressure to produce a vaccine against AIDS will result in a vaccine that might not be optimal in the sense of being free of all possible risks because there's too little time to investigate or discover unforeseeable or even some foreseeable reactions.

42:06.581 --> 42:08.002
Does this sound familiar?

42:08.622 --> 42:12.106
to how they didn't have enough time that warp speed just rushed it out.

42:13.347 --> 42:20.514
The fear of liability for defects in design may inhibit manufacturers from experimenting with some immunogens or from attempting to develop any at all.

42:25.459 --> 42:26.480
The brief history

42:27.958 --> 42:39.082
Of this theory for liability for vaccine injury, however, argues against the likelihood that a new vaccine against AIDS would be found to have an acceptable, sorry, an actionable defect in design.

42:40.042 --> 42:44.504
The vaccine cases strict liability has been defined in terms of its formulation.

42:46.623 --> 43:00.092
And anyone who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused by the ultimate user or consumer, even if the seller has excised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product.

43:02.674 --> 43:15.143
And so it is very possible that in the context of what has happened here, that somebody may be successfully prosecuted, that somebody may be held liable

43:16.852 --> 43:29.880
It's also possible that the legal shield that prevents that by the PrEP Act may successfully shield anybody from being held liable, strictly liable.

43:31.602 --> 43:44.450
But there is a narrative developing now about these DNA contaminations that is separate from the idea that they always should have known better, that the purest form of this would still be inappropriate for humans, and therefore,

43:46.758 --> 43:54.744
If it's always in any form, even in its best form, if it's not appropriate for humans, then we are in a different situation, right?

43:54.764 --> 43:56.425
We're in a much different situation.

43:56.885 --> 44:02.870
And that's why these words here are most important for everybody to listen to.

44:03.570 --> 44:06.652
Or it's these words right here.

44:07.773 --> 44:10.575
Whoops, that's not what I wanted.

44:12.116 --> 44:13.117
It's these words right here.

44:16.496 --> 44:22.479
And I'll read them again because I think these are the words that somehow or another, maybe Aaron Seery went to the wrong law school.

44:22.539 --> 44:32.725
Maybe Mary Holland didn't learn this at Columbia, but producers and manufacturers of vaccines may be held liable for injuries resulting from their products in strict liability or in negligence.

44:32.785 --> 44:35.506
Those are two sort of legal spaces.

44:35.646 --> 44:41.590
There's either negligence or just holding someone to strict liability standard.

44:42.390 --> 44:52.472
Strict liability is imposed when the product has a defect that renders it unreasonably dangerous as measured by the expectations of the vaccine recipient or the consumer.

44:56.633 --> 45:02.014
And so you could say, for example, that an anthrax vaccine might be unreasonably dangerous to the consumer.

45:03.054 --> 45:10.156
You might say that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system of a healthy human

45:10.945 --> 45:14.719
is an unreasonably dangerous idea.

45:20.947 --> 45:28.411
Three categories of defects may give rise to strict liability, manufacturing flaws, defects in design, and inadequate directions for use or warnings of risk.

45:28.811 --> 45:44.238
Well, in that case, the duty to warn would have been on people like Robert Malone, who have a lifelong familiarity with the word transfection, the methodology of transfection, and the biological shortcomings of transfection with regard to how our pattern integrity would react to it.

45:46.739 --> 45:49.881
And so the duty to warn would have been on all of these people.

45:50.745 --> 45:53.847
The duty to warn was on me at the beginning of the pandemic.

45:53.887 --> 46:11.641
The moment I realized that Bill Gates was referring to something that I already understood as a transfection, I already understood it would be inappropriate for anybody's grandmother, nevermind anybody's child or a pregnant woman, I felt the duty to warn.

46:11.681 --> 46:15.844
These companies would have had the duty to warn if they were held to strict liability.

46:17.932 --> 46:25.476
The PREP Act would be struck for unconstitutionality if fundamental rights are being suspended on the rational basis test alone.

46:29.198 --> 46:36.422
And that the government should instead be held to strict scrutiny in that scenario, that we are due substantive due process in that scenario.

46:36.862 --> 46:41.565
Those words are not used by Aaron Seery and Mary Holland and Bobby Kennedy.

46:41.605 --> 46:45.607
And if we don't start using them soon, the cage will close.

46:49.690 --> 47:10.335
These are not complicated issues because they have been hashed out in other contexts where people and lawyers were very freely using words like jurisdiction stripping to describe some of the fundamental rights suspensions that occur in a pandemic emergency scenario in the context of countermeasures.

47:14.520 --> 47:20.302
It's time to realize, ladies and gentlemen, that there are places we can push and they cannot stop us.

47:21.243 --> 47:22.083
These are real.

47:22.864 --> 47:37.190
Every lawyer worth their salt can find this article, can download other ones, and they can do their own research to find out whether or not these legal issues, these legal ideas come to bear here.

47:38.095 --> 47:48.316
and then go to this third complaint and look at what Aaron Siri is doing and you will find no mention of these legal terms.

47:49.437 --> 48:11.017
And when they are mentioned, they are mentioned in such a way that semantically makes it unnecessary for the other side of this argument, the United States, United Health and Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services doesn't even have to address them.

48:12.833 --> 48:28.186
If you read this document carefully, the only time he uses any combination of words that resembles things that I just talked about are in paragraphs that the way that they are worded make it unnecessary for these guys to address them.

48:34.151 --> 48:36.913
And that's why this isn't gonna win here in Louisiana.

48:36.933 --> 48:40.576
It's probably not gonna win in Texas, wherever he cut and paste this same language.

48:41.718 --> 48:42.879
because it's neutered.

48:44.660 --> 48:45.520
It's not real.

48:47.421 --> 48:48.842
And we've got to snap out of it.

48:49.643 --> 48:55.886
I don't know if it's because he worked for Goldman Sachs and that explains it all.

48:55.926 --> 49:09.034
All I know is, is that if anybody who is a lawyer who would just look at this and listen to what I'm saying and fact check it and teach what I'm getting wrong, we would make progress.

49:11.566 --> 49:24.290
If some lawyer, anybody worth their salt, would just take these ideas and say, okay, Jay says these words together and these words together, and he's wrong because this and because of that, we would make progress.

49:25.310 --> 49:28.011
But I can guarantee you, Aaron Seery's not gonna do it.

49:28.051 --> 49:29.511
Mary Holland's not gonna do it.

49:29.591 --> 49:30.111
They can't.

49:32.892 --> 49:34.992
This is very serious times right now.

49:37.513 --> 49:40.354
These are very wide open escape hatches.

49:43.083 --> 49:46.267
These are very, very available ladders out of the cave.

49:48.189 --> 49:58.682
It only takes one lawsuit for one person's injury to bounce up the court in a way that will get them to challenge the PrEP Act on its unconstitutionality.

49:58.722 --> 50:00.124
But they need to use these words.

50:02.734 --> 50:05.855
Somewhere in there, strict scrutiny has got to be said.

50:05.955 --> 50:09.115
Somewhere in there, substantive due process has to be said.

50:09.175 --> 50:14.357
Somewhere in there, fundamental rights being suspended has to be argued.

50:16.097 --> 50:21.138
Somewhere in there, maybe you also have to say restoring strict liability or something like that.

50:21.738 --> 50:24.299
But ladies and gentlemen, it's not being said.

50:31.598 --> 50:34.679
So that was Dear Aaron Seery.

50:37.140 --> 50:39.581
And now I'm going to move on really quick with a summary.

50:39.621 --> 50:46.503
Don't forget that the Population Pyramid offers an example, offers an explanation that could explain everything.

50:48.363 --> 50:55.486
And the fact that none of these people are talking about how it also explains how all these Western nations and China

50:56.351 --> 51:01.433
would have cooperated to use this theater to manage this problem.

51:03.194 --> 51:11.618
The extent to which they were able to manage this problem, how much headway they made, all requires you to have the real numbers, which none of us have.

51:13.579 --> 51:16.220
Even Denny Rancor doesn't have the real numbers.

51:16.320 --> 51:22.242
We have to just assume that the numbers that the states have collected, that the countries have collected, that the who collected are real.

51:22.302 --> 51:25.484
And then you have to assume that Denny's analysis is real

51:26.613 --> 51:37.864
because nobody's got time to go through an article with 150 figures that refers to another article with 25 figures that refers to the original article with 40 figures.

51:41.148 --> 51:46.513
When all that really matters is how did Denny Rancourt calculate the baseline here?

51:47.892 --> 51:52.661
How did Denny Rancor calculate his baseline of expected all-cause mortality?

51:52.701 --> 51:56.509
And I can guarantee you, he didn't take this kind of data into account.

51:59.002 --> 52:18.946
It's most likely that that's the reason why Denny was there already in May of 2020, to make sure that somebody had first dibs on that narrative of all cause mortality and made sure that nobody would start out with an expectation of a rise in all cause mortality that would start around 2019, because that would be a problem.

52:19.826 --> 52:22.247
Because then you would realize that it might just be murder.

52:25.467 --> 52:25.868
And why?

52:25.928 --> 52:28.048
Because trillions of dollars were at stake.

52:29.670 --> 52:43.424
And you can see how crazy it is that these people who were in place very early on saying that the real danger of these kinds of viruses is should they go endemic, then they'll contribute to this, you know, background of stuff that kills people every year.

52:43.864 --> 52:49.190
Those same people had this crazy idea of endemicity, but I've never been able to

52:50.515 --> 52:54.960
sort of wake up to the idea that, oh wow, but that also means they could lie about a background.

52:55.060 --> 52:55.721
No, no, no.

52:56.341 --> 53:00.526
They are absolutely certain that something appeared in a mud puddle and now is endemic.

53:02.042 --> 53:02.863
And it could happen again.

53:03.664 --> 53:11.010
That's why all these people in 2020 had all these different parts of the story and went all in on certain parts of the story.

53:11.051 --> 53:15.074
And then if you paid attention to a couple of these people, you'd be putting these pieces together.

53:15.515 --> 53:25.064
And the crazy part is, is that narrative, which covers for outcomes of transfection in a population, that narrative is being sustained by the same people right now.

53:26.914 --> 53:39.379
same people that have been front of the Senate every year, the same people that are touring the world in the international COVID summits, the same people that are repeatedly in front of the NCI in Canada, that's all the same.

53:41.420 --> 53:46.982
Sustaining little bits and pieces of this narrative, agreeing never to question the premise of the whole thing.

53:49.551 --> 53:51.693
that something in a mud puddle went endemic.

53:51.733 --> 53:55.297
And that's why nobody's talking about the murder in Scotland that we know happened.

53:55.397 --> 53:57.258
Nothing happened in Scotland but murder.

53:59.361 --> 54:03.765
But everywhere else, I guess there was a virus, but nothing but murder happened in Scotland.

54:05.011 --> 54:12.834
That's why these people won't talk about that and how oxygen in America could have easily caused ARDS in anybody that they gave it to.

54:12.914 --> 54:17.215
And that would have been characterized as COVID progression and that's murder and lying.

54:17.775 --> 54:33.981
If you coupled that with the way that PCR was, you know, distorted as being extremely accurate, it's like a gift from God, but only when applied in earnest, like it is on an academic bench, not how it is applied as a product, a diagnostic.

54:38.976 --> 54:47.280
Nobody's talking about the fact that transformation and transfection were product types before the pandemic, and then suddenly we called them investigational vaccines.

54:47.340 --> 55:06.188
Nobody's talking about the fact that even in its purest form, a chemical RNA, a perfect sequence in perfect stoichiometric relationship to the lipid nanoparticle in perfect ratios would still have been inappropriate to give to our healthy grandparents, nevermind pregnant women or children.

55:08.424 --> 55:27.827
The obvious truth that infectious clone, every time it's found, every time it's found, every time the term infectious clone is found in a virology paper, they are using it to indicate or to substitute for what should have been called the transformation and transfection of cell cultures or animals in that paper.

55:29.656 --> 55:42.206
And by pointing this out, that these terms, these methodologies are present in all of these parts of the narrative, you can very easily see why the no virus position was also part of the trap.

55:42.766 --> 55:50.512
And that's why the no virus people won't get to the point where they say RNA cannot pandemic because then they will unravel everything.

55:53.734 --> 55:55.556
This was us on social media.

55:57.162 --> 56:14.652
Do not ever stop reminding yourself that whenever you get on social media, you are getting in that chair, you are putting on goggles, you are grabbing that dirty joystick, and you are allowing them to put images in front of you and convince you of things, add thoughts to your brain.

56:15.092 --> 56:18.234
You are essentially letting people siege your garden with weeds.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.537
That's why I put this up every time.

56:23.557 --> 56:25.678
I think it's really important.

56:33.487 --> 56:36.748
So yesterday I pointed out that the United States would begin.

56:36.768 --> 56:37.229
You have a theory.

56:37.249 --> 56:37.509
Yes.

56:37.589 --> 56:37.889
Yes.

56:38.089 --> 56:38.909
I have multiple.

56:38.949 --> 56:40.070
I've now real quick.

56:40.090 --> 56:40.550
Sorry.

56:40.930 --> 56:42.170
So I want to make sure I'm clear here.

56:43.371 --> 56:49.593
Following the election, you have already said you think there will be 1000 deaths, politically motivated deaths by April.

56:49.613 --> 56:50.014
Is that correct?

56:50.054 --> 56:50.334
Yes.

56:50.854 --> 56:58.017
Now, this is just an illusion of consensus of two performers that agree that there's going to be a civil war and are fascinated by the.

56:58.922 --> 57:05.588
the complexity and fascinated by models of history that are all predicting the same downfall of America.

57:06.869 --> 57:11.053
It's not that guy explaining his dumb theory.

57:11.514 --> 57:22.624
It's more than one person agreeing that this dumb theory is worth discussing and worth talking about and worth dissecting the details of, worth criticizing.

57:24.366 --> 57:28.168
And so it's very different than just listening to music or watching TV.

57:28.228 --> 57:33.852
This is active engagement in active misleading.

57:35.233 --> 57:47.080
And if you go on social media without the understanding that it's actually you getting in a chair and putting on goggles, you will miss this because you will think one or more of these people really means well.

57:47.120 --> 57:51.043
Maybe only the guy is a bad, maybe Tim is just a victim.

57:52.887 --> 58:01.009
Just to be sure you know, Tim Poole actually went on live yesterday to say that he's not sure he can keep going anymore.

58:01.389 --> 58:10.671
He has 30 employees and 10 contractors, but it's just a lot of dead weight and nobody's really working as hard as him.

58:11.151 --> 58:14.412
And he still works 80 hours a week and without him, none of this would happen.

58:14.452 --> 58:15.292
And so he's not sure.

58:15.773 --> 58:21.574
Last night he titled his live stream, this may be the last Tim IRL show.

58:26.107 --> 58:28.248
This is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.

58:28.429 --> 58:37.114
The whole landscape is starting to shake because the script is having been advanced too quickly.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.517
It doesn't mean that we're going to win.

58:40.537 --> 58:43.078
This is a multi-generational war.

58:43.438 --> 58:44.959
They will adjust.

58:45.560 --> 58:46.941
They are adjusting right now.

58:48.854 --> 58:50.776
And so we need to keep moving forward.

58:50.796 --> 58:51.997
We can't look backwards.

58:52.057 --> 58:54.940
We have to keep the lights forward, our arms straight.

58:55.340 --> 58:56.942
We need to keep moving out of the cave.

58:56.962 --> 58:58.963
We need to keep lifting people out of the cave.

58:59.484 --> 59:05.329
Just like I showed you here, this guy presenting about his worm findings and about how

59:06.110 --> 59:19.714
small RNAs belong somewhere in the central dogma, but completely and totally bamboozled by the system that gives him fame, that gives him notoriety, that tells everybody, that tells himself that he's a genius.

59:20.595 --> 59:28.417
A year after this presentation, he's then awarded an award by Elon Musk and Kate Beckinsale

59:31.072 --> 59:40.121
And it's for the discovery of mRNA and the regulatory role that they play in all kinds of processes, the absolute new level of complexity.

59:41.570 --> 59:43.192
in terms of gene regulations.

59:43.452 --> 59:50.619
Kay Beckinsale says that small mRNAs, regulatory mRNAs are actually genes that regulate other genes.

59:51.280 --> 01:00:03.432
So we use this as an example of the kind of chicanery that goes on with regard to the idea of genes and the sort of what they want you to believe is a very acidic

01:00:06.161 --> 01:00:10.804
an acidic discovery in the sense that it dissolves all the other questions away.

01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:15.568
In other words, evolution was still up for grabs until we found DNA.

01:00:16.088 --> 01:00:19.891
The determinist nature of biology was up for grabs until we found DNA.

01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:23.974
Now that we've found DNA, clearly evolution happens.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:28.377
Clearly evolution is the way that God created us.

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:36.325
You know, like he spun everything in motion and then a million years later, we were the result of it.

01:00:36.365 --> 01:00:40.369
And so it was like the breath of God blowing life onto the planet.

01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:44.414
And then the earth just kept circling the sun for millions of years.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:45.656
And eventually we were there.

01:00:47.304 --> 01:00:53.249
That illusion is part of what biologists like this guy contribute to.

01:00:53.289 --> 01:01:00.294
Where I was when I was in tenure track seeking mode was exactly the same place.

01:01:01.175 --> 01:01:06.019
That's how, exactly how I resolved my faith with how I was working.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.980
And it translates very well.

01:01:08.141 --> 01:01:14.846
I was interested in a better appreciation of the complexity of creation.

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:17.879
the beauty of the work of the Creator.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:28.029
But at the same time, of course, I understood that I was working with people who thought the whole idea of God had been disproven a long time ago because evolution and DNA.

01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:38.761
Almost half or more of the people that I worked with, probably all of them at the University of Pittsburgh, were working under the absolute pretense that

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:45.131
Everything about us was biology, including consciousness, including our experiences.

01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:46.212
There's no soul.

01:01:49.194 --> 01:01:50.415
Everything is an illusion.

01:01:52.136 --> 01:01:59.942
And so when a neuroscientist is looking for consciousness, they are looking for where the illusion is generated, where the screen is projecting.

01:02:03.211 --> 01:02:29.374
And this guy is one of those biologists, just like I was, that is under the illusion from biology 101, that because Mendel formulated some laws, but was missing the hereditary material, and because Watson and Crick found the hereditary material, then evolution and genetics are reality.

01:02:31.809 --> 01:02:35.090
And that is not something that is under debate anymore.

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:38.851
That is part of the foundational bricks of biology.

01:02:38.931 --> 01:02:43.832
Everybody builds all of their questions under with these assumptions firmly in place.

01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:51.815
And so if those assumptions are horribly wrong, we have a very big problem.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.355
And that's where I think we are.

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:56.776
And I think that's what I wanted to try and

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:03.832
take a shot at with regard to that explanation for the UK Doctors for COVID Ethics yesterday.

01:03:04.953 --> 01:03:25.667
And that's why I brought this guy up and recommended that you watch this presentation with Kevin Esvelt because here again, we're talking about using very standard molecular biological techniques to try and probe what is a probably irreducibly complex background of genetic signals, misconstrue it as understanding,

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:42.236
confuse everybody as to the threats that it poses to our futures, so that all kinds of regulatory schemes and experimental paradigms can be set up under the pretense of effective altruism or global public health.

01:03:42.716 --> 01:03:46.058
And he doesn't work for the MIT Media Lab.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:50.420
In this talk, he's working for the Geneva security something something.

01:03:54.229 --> 01:04:01.515
We are in very big trouble, but I do think that we are at a stage where some of the exits that are open are starting to become very visible.

01:04:12.384 --> 01:04:19.607
So I am now going to do this PlusMD4CEI.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:24.668
That's the Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International, the Stephen Frost and Charles Kovas group.

01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:28.430
And that is available freely on Rumble, of course.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:34.632
I'm just going to play my own version of it here.

01:04:35.825 --> 01:04:43.150
in the background and I just want to talk through the first part of it here now and I'll probably turn it down as it plays.

01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:53.397
So everybody, welcome to today's meeting of Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:05:04.966
We're having an urgent announcement for five minutes to start before I... So the urgent announcement was, it's a very interesting phenomenon that occurred at the beginning of this meeting.

01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:12.692
So Stephen announced that I was going to speak again for the sixth time about the Human Genome Project on Saturday or Friday.

01:05:13.693 --> 01:05:19.918
And then maybe a half a day later, maybe it was really sooner than that.

01:05:20.038 --> 01:05:23.601
I don't remember off the top of my head, to be honest, because I don't check my emails all day.

01:05:23.621 --> 01:05:29.086
Darn, the coffee's gone.

01:05:29.106 --> 01:05:31.267
The entire group

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:35.102
And this is a thing that is generally not done.

01:05:35.522 --> 01:05:38.544
It's generally frowned upon to reply to the whole group.

01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:41.745
And this group has gone through a lot of iterations of that.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:50.469
The group has also gone through, like the email is not formatting anymore because he keeps copying the same email and then putting it in a new email.

01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:54.131
And so kind of ham-fistedly moving forward.

01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:59.953
So every day with the email has caused some problems every once in a while.

01:06:02.202 --> 01:06:14.286
And so as a result, it has become general etiquette for this group not to respond to that email because then you're responding to like 80 people or 100 people and everybody hates that.

01:06:14.826 --> 01:06:19.488
But this group's already gone through enough of that where generally speaking, that doesn't happen anymore.

01:06:20.148 --> 01:06:25.230
The only emails that we get are the emails coming from Stephen Frost and one from Charles usually.

01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:27.591
And so it's been pretty clean signal.

01:06:28.843 --> 01:06:34.693
Um, but for my talk about some time later, it could have been a couple hours, could have been a half a day.

01:06:34.713 --> 01:06:41.804
I don't remember because again, like I said, I didn't check the email for this particular thing, but somebody by the name of Craig Particopa.

01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:50.723
emailed everyone in response to the announcement that I was speaking and said that he needed five minutes at the beginning.

01:06:50.763 --> 01:07:05.767
He demanded, and it was mandatory, required, I don't know, it was urgent, critical that he be given 10 minutes to speak or a slot to speak at the start of this meeting because he has something really important to tell everybody.

01:07:07.165 --> 01:07:28.709
And so now what's really interesting about this Craig Partakoper guy is that he's actually pretty well known in my mind, associate with Sasha Latupova, because Sasha Latupova and Craig Partakoper are the two people that started out way back whenever talking about hot batches and not hot batches.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:36.231
And in fact, Sasha Latupova appeared on GigaOM Biological as a guest representing

01:07:37.256 --> 01:07:50.437
Craig Particopa's data and talking about Craig Particopa's data as being evidence for either manufacturing flaws or storage flaws or something, we'd have to go back to that video and see what exactly she said.

01:07:51.963 --> 01:08:06.576
And so this is very much in line with what I've tried to explain before as Sasha Latupova being somebody who was probably involved in this nonsense on social media through her daughter already, or as evidence with her daughter already before the pandemic.

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.598
If you don't know who Soph is, she's in my introduction.

01:08:10.139 --> 01:08:14.563
She's a, unfortunately, a minor at the time.

01:08:16.204 --> 01:08:38.283
was making all kinds of very disturbing content on YouTube, lost her YouTube channel for threatening the life of the CEO, I guess, in jest, and eventually appeared on Alex Jones a few months before the start of the pandemic as this censored young kid who was speaking truth to the woke movement in America.

01:08:39.544 --> 01:08:55.114
And I don't think, for me, there's any way to look back and see a minor appearing on Alex Jones with that kind of content for a couple years before the... I mean, there's some really awful videos where she's clearly, you know...

01:08:56.535 --> 01:09:07.211
12 or 10 or whatever, pretending to overdose and dressing in a hijab or pretending to be an FBI agent.

01:09:07.691 --> 01:09:09.013
It's an extraordinary

01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:33.468
sort of catalog of previous activity before the pandemic for the mom to then emerge as somebody who was interviewed multiple times by CHD, including one with Polly and Meryl, including two separate appearances on the Defender podcast with Bobby all by herself, with an appearance on the

01:09:35.409 --> 01:09:44.195
American thought leaders for the Epoch Times and also was on stage in Sweden with Asim Malhotra and Meryl Nass and Robert Malone.

01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:46.776
in 2023 in January.

01:09:47.416 --> 01:10:11.189
And so it's a very strange sort of pattern if this daughter of hers is supposed to be just something that happened, and that now she is a semi-retired pharmaceutical executive who's speaking out about, I don't know, I guess in 2022 it was about bad batches, and then in 2023 it was about what Catherine Watt had to say, and then in 2024 it's now I'm a bigot.

01:10:15.239 --> 01:10:35.591
And so what's interesting is that Craig Partakoper is the guy who comes into my presentation or our scheduled presentation to Medical Doctors for COVID-19 Ethics International with an urgent, critical, you know, I've got to interrupt everybody and I need the attention of all of you people.

01:10:37.935 --> 01:10:41.037
Now, not being invited, that's a pretty bold claim, right?

01:10:41.077 --> 01:10:52.226
I mean, if you walk into a movie theater where they're about to start the movie and it's Dune II and everybody's got their popcorn ready, and I'm not saying I'm Dune II, but I'm just saying that everybody was there for something else.

01:10:53.507 --> 01:11:01.473
And now you're asking for everybody to listen to you for just a minute because you have something really important to say.

01:11:01.934 --> 01:11:03.095
What do you think he's gonna say?

01:11:03.908 --> 01:11:20.983
What do you think the friend of Sasha Latupova, one of the first reasons why Sasha Latupova became visible all over the world, in the English speaking world, was because of Craig Pardecoper and how she and him were working on this data?

01:11:22.504 --> 01:11:28.489
Understand the significance of what is happening here because this is a red alert to everybody.

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.472
I need to tell everybody this, he says.

01:11:33.277 --> 01:11:48.854
And now, of course, this is the beginning of the archived video where I will discuss the implications or lack of implications of the Human Genome Project and genes and DNA.

01:11:49.495 --> 01:11:50.256
So it's interesting.

01:11:50.296 --> 01:11:51.077
Listen carefully.

01:11:52.915 --> 01:11:59.080
Jay Cooey, wonderful presenter, wonderful thinker who's joining us today.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:05.945
We're going to have five minutes from Craig Party Cooper, who's presented to us twice before.

01:12:06.466 --> 01:12:09.969
This group was founded over three years ago by Stephen Frost.

01:12:10.029 --> 01:12:10.869
I'm Charles Cobis.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.331
I'll do a shortened invitation today.

01:12:16.397 --> 01:12:19.981
We comprise lots of professions here and we're from all around the world.

01:12:21.142 --> 01:12:24.185
This is Craig Particopa right here, this guy in the upper left.

01:12:24.325 --> 01:12:26.487
He has a vest on with no shirt.

01:12:28.871 --> 01:12:35.960
and he's in a dark room and he's about to tell us something that we all had to, you know, everything goes on hold.

01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:40.947
He's probably going all over the place telling everybody that this is the most important message.

01:12:41.047 --> 01:12:46.614
Recognize that we're in World War III and that we're partway through World War III.

01:12:47.955 --> 01:12:52.056
This is a free speech environment with appropriate moderating.

01:12:52.136 --> 01:12:57.817
We reject the offense industry and we reject the triggering industry.

01:12:58.897 --> 01:13:02.018
If you're offended by anything, be offended.

01:13:02.638 --> 01:13:04.239
We are lovingly not interested.

01:13:04.299 --> 01:13:07.219
We come with an attitude and perspective of love and not fear.

01:13:07.999 --> 01:13:09.260
Fear is the opposite of love.

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.420
Fear squashes you and enslaves you.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.581
Love, on the other hand, expands you and liberates you.

01:13:16.937 --> 01:13:18.618
So thank you for being here.

01:13:18.658 --> 01:13:21.539
The meeting is recorded, is uploaded onto the rumble channel.

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:27.922
And before I introduce Jay, Jay Cooey, Craig Patacoupa, the next five minutes is yours.

01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:31.823
We are all ears and Craig, we can see your screen.

01:13:31.943 --> 01:13:32.284
Okay.

01:13:34.064 --> 01:13:34.384
Oops.

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:34.805
Darn it.

01:13:35.325 --> 01:13:36.045
I got to go back.

01:13:36.105 --> 01:13:36.705
My bad.

01:13:36.866 --> 01:13:38.106
Darn, darn, darn.

01:13:38.146 --> 01:13:39.647
I wanted to get my timer out.

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:40.347
Hold on a minute.

01:13:40.507 --> 01:13:42.568
I'm going to, I'm going to get my timer out.

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:48.671
a free speech environment with appropriate moderating.

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:54.433
We reject the offense industry and we reject the triggering industry.

01:13:55.513 --> 01:13:58.634
If you're offended by anything, be offended.

01:13:59.255 --> 01:14:00.835
We are lovingly not interested.

01:14:00.855 --> 01:14:03.836
We come with an attitude and perspective of love and not fear.

01:14:04.616 --> 01:14:05.877
Fear is the opposite of love.

01:14:06.157 --> 01:14:08.037
Fear squashes you and enslaves you.

01:14:08.098 --> 01:14:12.199
Love, on the other hand, expands you and liberates you.

01:14:13.559 --> 01:14:15.240
So, thank you for being here.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.181
The meeting is recorded, is uploaded onto the Rumble channel.

01:14:18.961 --> 01:14:24.523
And before I introduce Jay Cooey, Craig Patacoupa, the next five minutes is yours.

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:26.824
We are all ears.

01:14:26.904 --> 01:14:28.425
And Craig, we can see your screen.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:28.885
OK.

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.727
Can anyone... Lovely, great.

01:14:34.187 --> 01:14:35.787
OK, so the headline is...

01:14:39.319 --> 01:14:44.584
I'm not sure how you're going to take this, but I'm just going to tell you the facts without trying to interpret them.

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:55.753
A message has been found in the X logo for the X platform, and it is of significant meaning to everyone.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.134
Now, in my mind, it should have been stopped right here.

01:14:59.174 --> 01:15:00.654
It should have just been like, wait a minute.

01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:05.795
No, we're not going to talk about symbology of social media platforms right now.

01:15:07.355 --> 01:15:07.935
I don't know.

01:15:08.315 --> 01:15:10.756
You said that this was a very urgent message.

01:15:11.636 --> 01:15:19.798
I thought that that would mean something about murder or something about murder or maybe something about murder, but it's not.

01:15:20.718 --> 01:15:23.519
And so we're not going to interrupt this meeting for this.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.140
Thank you very much.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.421
But that's not what happened.

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:31.123
And it's fine because we did agree that he could have five minutes.

01:15:31.163 --> 01:15:32.203
So what is he going to say?

01:15:33.284 --> 01:15:42.908
The logo was made public initially in August 2023 on the X platform when Elon took over from Twitter.

01:15:44.193 --> 01:15:55.997
People have noticed that there appears to be a scratch on the logo, which was a bit odd, but no one actually zoomed in and actually saw what was embedded in the message.

01:15:56.537 --> 01:16:02.759
So here is the actual logo, which has been present on all phones since 2023 August.

01:16:07.304 --> 01:16:11.125
When you zoom in, you can see that the scratch isn't a scratch.

01:16:11.385 --> 01:16:15.726
It has letters and numbers, which comprise a message.

01:16:16.307 --> 01:16:21.208
Initially, I didn't know what language it was in, but it's now been completely deciphered.

01:16:22.228 --> 01:16:32.411
The actual line of message points to an image above the X, which I'll show you briefly what that is.

01:16:35.094 --> 01:16:39.578
So the central scratch is not a scratch, it's a message.

01:16:40.518 --> 01:16:42.119
And he has deciphered it.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.280
It's been deciphered.

01:16:49.365 --> 01:16:52.988
When I deciphered it, it consisted of two parts.

01:16:53.969 --> 01:17:01.895
It consisted of a sequence that repeated three times, consisting of three letters each time, and it reads,

01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:06.905
Now this is going to sound horny, but I'm just going to say what the facts are.

01:17:07.466 --> 01:17:07.986
It reads.

01:17:08.266 --> 01:17:11.488
Uh-oh, we lost him.

01:17:11.508 --> 01:17:13.009
Uh-oh.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:20.293
Zoom glitch for dramatic pause.

01:17:20.694 --> 01:17:21.334
Hang on, Craig.

01:17:21.614 --> 01:17:22.955
This is happening.

01:17:23.135 --> 01:17:25.577
You can see me laughing in the corner here.

01:17:25.617 --> 01:17:28.658
You can see me laughing.

01:17:29.539 --> 01:17:29.979
Start again.

01:17:30.059 --> 01:17:30.460
It reads.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:30.900
OK.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:31.840
It reads.

01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:39.931
666 in letters, not in numbers.

01:17:40.352 --> 01:17:47.715
So you've got S-I-X, S-I-X, and S-I-X.

01:17:48.075 --> 01:17:56.139
I've put a full document of this on my website, howbad.info, under the section COVID and Cult.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.823
So people can look at it in detail and get zooming in on high-resolution images to see this.

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:07.569
Get some high res images and start zooming in, people.

01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:18.656
An image that I can interpret this in detail in the files that I've provided.

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.461
This is the image that I was referring to.

01:18:23.642 --> 01:18:28.485
Anybody that downloads those files is labeled already and on a server somewhere.

01:18:28.565 --> 01:18:29.585
I mean, come on.

01:18:29.945 --> 01:18:34.868
It consists of a person in a walking position with wearing shoes.

01:18:36.009 --> 01:18:41.352
Upright walking position, but it has the head of a beast.

01:18:44.441 --> 01:18:51.202
And it goes by a name beginning with two letters, E-L, followed by two spaces.

01:18:51.662 --> 01:18:54.903
So it's a four-letter name beginning with E-L.

01:18:59.624 --> 01:19:05.445
Now, concerning the image above the X, which is on everyone's phone, this is it.

01:19:06.845 --> 01:19:10.166
And initially, I wasn't sure

01:19:11.223 --> 01:19:18.166
what it was, but then when we used high resolution, we can see this is, it's a person.

01:19:18.746 --> 01:19:22.148
Their head is at an angle of 20 degrees to their right.

01:19:22.288 --> 01:19:32.272
What movie was that where they could just like zoom in infinitely from the satellite until they were reading what everybody was looking at and they could just get any image they wanted.

01:19:32.312 --> 01:19:35.693
And it was Jack Black sitting at the console all the time.

01:19:35.733 --> 01:19:36.154
Do you remember?

01:19:36.674 --> 01:19:38.915
You can see its eyes here and here.

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:40.823
Enhance!

01:19:41.223 --> 01:19:41.743
Enhance!

01:19:42.124 --> 01:19:44.044
It should have a little... It's mouth.

01:19:45.264 --> 01:19:49.425
And there's a symmetry at 20 degrees to the vertical.

01:19:49.865 --> 01:19:53.346
And you can see one of its ears here, which looks quite pointed.

01:19:55.347 --> 01:20:00.848
Now, as bizarre as all this sounds, like a fairy tale, it's actually what's on everyone's phone.

01:20:01.648 --> 01:20:03.549
And the interpretation is...

01:20:04.451 --> 01:20:08.614
The X, my interpretation now... Five minutes is up.

01:20:08.854 --> 01:20:12.317
The X has always been a symbol for Christ.

01:20:13.078 --> 01:20:19.743
And when you have a vertical line through the X, that's the iota chi, which is the symbol for Jesus Christ.

01:20:19.843 --> 01:20:22.425
It's a traditional Christian symbol.

01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:31.592
Here instead, it's the line going through it with the message 666 and that strange walking beast.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.021
pointing to what looks like a kind of a devil at the top.

01:20:36.621 --> 01:20:46.663
To me, it looks like the symbol for the Antichrist because we have, instead of... He froze again.

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:47.763
I think we're going to cut him off now.

01:20:47.783 --> 01:20:57.806
It's relevant to what's going to be happening in America over the next few months, which is that they're having an election.

01:20:58.919 --> 01:21:07.202
People are taking part in that election, and it's up to people to decide whether they want to take this information into account, that's all.

01:21:08.222 --> 01:21:14.585
And this information isn't provided by anyone except the person who is taking part in the election.

01:21:15.265 --> 01:21:21.527
So it's not provided by me, it's not provided by an opposition to them, it's provided by them themselves.

01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:24.068
They're declaring who they are here.

01:21:25.353 --> 01:21:33.976
I'm just saying this is relevant and it's going to affect the history of America and also of the globe in the coming months.

01:21:34.717 --> 01:21:36.057
So I've said that.

01:21:36.137 --> 01:21:37.138
That's my newsflash.

01:21:42.853 --> 01:21:48.317
I've provided links, so here you have, you can find this information under COVID and COLD.

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:55.362
I've created a document that's about 40 pages where I go into detail in analyzing the image.

01:21:56.142 --> 01:22:00.165
Howbad.info is the website that him and

01:22:03.087 --> 01:22:26.565
Sasha Latupova have been pushing as the batch website just so you know it's all one big show ladies and gentlemen they had to send this dude in have like a video and a document so the video's on bitshoot and the document is here and i'll invite everybody to at least take this into consideration regarding a self-declared identity

01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:30.267
of the person who actually created this image.

01:22:31.007 --> 01:22:34.888
So people should take it into consideration.

01:22:35.248 --> 01:22:37.929
So therefore, whatever they decide, they decide.

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:40.970
Well done, Craig.

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:42.970
Thank you for all those links.

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:45.471
You've put those links into the chat, have you, Craig?

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:54.553
OK, I'm going to go back to

01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:03.681
Just copy and paste while Jay starts.

01:23:04.061 --> 01:23:06.182
Just copy and paste that into the chat, Craig.

01:23:08.543 --> 01:23:09.984
Make it easy for people to access.

01:23:17.587 --> 01:23:18.208
And he's frozen.

01:23:18.228 --> 01:23:19.968
Yes, he is.

01:23:22.049 --> 01:23:24.210
All right, so we've got those links.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:25.351
I can put them into the chat.

01:23:26.773 --> 01:23:27.773
And we'll get Craig.

01:23:27.813 --> 01:23:29.434
Thank you for that.

01:23:29.474 --> 01:23:38.878
If you can hear us, that is a newsflash and Craig will discuss with Steven and I will stop his sharing there.

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:39.038
And

01:23:49.153 --> 01:23:53.816
Jonathan J. Cooey.

01:23:53.836 --> 01:23:55.256
I'm delighted.

01:23:55.336 --> 01:23:59.999
We're delighted to have you again to talk about the Human Genome Project.

01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:03.701
Jay's bio is on the show notes.

01:24:03.741 --> 01:24:12.806
For those of you who don't know who he is, he is a researcher and wonderful presenter, wonderful investigator.

01:24:12.986 --> 01:24:15.627
And we thank you so much again, Jay, for joining us.

01:24:15.687 --> 01:24:17.989
And thank you again, Stephen Frost, for creating

01:24:18.769 --> 01:24:23.632
this group and giving us an opportunity to speak the truth.

01:24:24.232 --> 01:24:27.874
I mean, it's unfortunate because really what it does is it discredits the video.

01:24:27.914 --> 01:24:36.398
It puts this video in a place where anybody that clicks on it on Rumble, remember that on Rumble, if you advance any video, you get two ads right away.

01:24:37.059 --> 01:24:40.481
If you even touch the slider, you get ads in five seconds.

01:24:41.281 --> 01:24:50.264
So anybody that even wants to hear me speak is going to have to watch like four more ads to try and get to the beginning of where the introduction is over.

01:24:50.784 --> 01:24:52.724
That's what's most extraordinary.

01:24:52.784 --> 01:24:54.225
And it's not Charles's fault.

01:24:54.265 --> 01:24:59.046
You see, they know that Charles wants to make this as an open forum as possible.

01:24:59.106 --> 01:25:01.867
Charles wants to give everybody a chance at the mic.

01:25:01.907 --> 01:25:02.387
That's what this

01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:19.430
this whole group is about when people ask questions they ask questions for like a half an hour each it's it's a really well done open forum and Charles does an excellent job of maintaining it that way and so that means they're also vulnerable to anybody who wants to come in and say you know like

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.525
Hey, guys, I got something really important to tell everybody.

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.651
And, you know, I got a message.

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:35.204
And, you know, it's a place where people and they want people to feel comfortable jumping in like that.

01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:56.837
But what you should also realize is that that means that it's very likely that this guy was sent specifically at, that's not an urgent message that needed to come in on Sunday the 20th, unless it was to make sure that because Charles is how he is, because this forum is how he is, that this video could be polluted.

01:25:57.337 --> 01:26:02.340
This message could be polluted with that, which can only be characterized as bullshit.

01:26:04.502 --> 01:26:10.267
Because of course they want us to think that Elon thinks that he is the chosen one, or the savior, or the antichrist.

01:26:10.307 --> 01:26:15.832
And that's why he wore the stupid Halloween costume last year, and he'll probably have an even better one this year.

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:21.031
You gotta get ready for this because that is part of the cage.

01:26:21.091 --> 01:26:28.374
That's part of the big sphere of steel and mesh that the motorcycles are riding around in.

01:26:28.855 --> 01:26:32.016
One of those motorcycles is labeled, Elon is the savior.

01:26:32.156 --> 01:26:33.596
It's got fire coming out of it.

01:26:34.017 --> 01:26:38.118
And there's a guy in a devil suit riding that motorcycle, but that's not to make it real.

01:26:38.659 --> 01:26:44.481
And if this guy comes and points to that motorcycle and says, then that doesn't mean anything.

01:26:46.698 --> 01:26:52.661
especially when that guy is so intimately associated with the mother of Soph.

01:26:55.503 --> 01:26:56.103
For each other.

01:26:57.083 --> 01:26:58.244
Jay, over to you.

01:26:58.284 --> 01:27:01.746
You can share your screen and you're the man.

01:27:01.766 --> 01:27:06.208
Wow, so that's an interesting thing to say.

01:27:06.408 --> 01:27:06.829
False.

01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:08.730
I get no interesting.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:11.091
Let's just see what I get when I go to Rumble.

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:22.173
Hmm, what an interesting thing to put in the... Yeah, that's very interesting.

01:27:22.353 --> 01:27:24.714
Oh no, I didn't click on that guy.

01:27:30.076 --> 01:27:32.396
Very interesting to put that in.

01:27:32.476 --> 01:27:35.097
Let's see what I get when I click on here.

01:27:36.428 --> 01:27:37.608
Then I push play.

01:27:38.449 --> 01:27:39.349
I get one ad.

01:27:39.469 --> 01:27:40.470
Watch the news lately.

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:42.090
Israel's under attack.

01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:43.631
Israel's under attack.

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:48.413
Have you heard of this brand new product that instantly cleans toilets without any scrubbing?

01:27:48.993 --> 01:27:49.493
Take any dirty.

01:27:49.513 --> 01:27:53.495
And then I start the video and let's see if something happens.

01:27:53.795 --> 01:27:59.377
Welcome to today's meeting of Medical Doctors for COVID Ethics International.

01:28:00.603 --> 01:28:02.786
If... Oh, ad begins in five minutes.

01:28:03.106 --> 01:28:04.147
Oh, five seconds.

01:28:04.187 --> 01:28:04.788
Oh, I see.

01:28:04.808 --> 01:28:06.570
I do get an ad.

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.092
Isn't that weird?

01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:11.916
Every time I touch the, uh, advance... Every time...

01:28:13.143 --> 01:28:20.726
Every time I touch the physicists and chemists, oh look, ad begins in three, two, one.

01:28:20.906 --> 01:28:24.088
The US government doesn't want you to have this drone.

01:28:24.588 --> 01:28:28.890
Can you briefly explain why you think you don't get ads when you watch?

01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:32.371
How does that happen for you?

01:28:32.431 --> 01:28:33.512
Why is that false?

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.401
Very strange thing to put in the chat.

01:28:37.681 --> 01:28:38.361
But we'll go on.

01:28:38.381 --> 01:28:40.982
Thank you very much, again, for the opportunity to speak.

01:28:42.143 --> 01:28:44.163
I'm going to put myself over on the other side.

01:28:44.223 --> 01:28:48.165
If you can't see this as one screen, you just have to change your view to speaker view.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:55.527
So I want to take a look at this book, which is called What is Life, Mind, and Matter.

01:28:55.567 --> 01:28:56.908
I put a link in the chat.

01:28:57.068 --> 01:29:02.150
It's a link on my website, where if you go to that link, you can see these PDFs that are downloadable.

01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.230
And one of them is this book.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.744
You can also find this book on the internet archive and if you just search but then it's not false What is life?

01:29:09.784 --> 01:29:10.865
What are you talking about?

01:29:10.925 --> 01:29:19.570
Then you use I mean that doesn't make any sense Some of the pdfs have this cover some of the pdfs have a little chicken on the front Um, there's a cambridge version.

01:29:19.611 --> 01:29:22.893
There's a there's another well, this one's also a cambridge version.

01:29:22.913 --> 01:29:28.657
Maybe there's multiple ones anyway, I think that the reason why this book is so interesting is because

01:29:29.998 --> 01:29:45.430
It has become clear to me in trying to formulate a new Biology 101 for freshman students in college that something is really wrong with Campbell, the book that everybody uses at universities in America.

01:29:46.531 --> 01:30:03.761
With the help of my friend Mark Kulak and other people like Peter Hotez and others, I understand that there are browsers that people can use and there are plugins that people can use, but that doesn't change the fact that most old people, when they open up a Rumble link,

01:30:04.421 --> 01:30:06.882
aren't going to install those things.

01:30:07.542 --> 01:30:14.466
It doesn't change the fact that most people that casually use Rumble and aren't very savvy are not using those things.

01:30:14.526 --> 01:30:21.369
And so Rumble is a very bad place to put your stuff if your audience is new to Rumble.

01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:27.992
If your audience is being brought there by social media platforms, it is a terrible place because of that.

01:30:28.732 --> 01:30:29.452
Now, it is true.

01:30:29.512 --> 01:30:32.733
I'm sure you can make it so that it's not like that.

01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:36.034
But the point is to see that they don't have to.

01:30:36.054 --> 01:30:37.435
It doesn't need to be that way.

01:30:37.535 --> 01:30:38.975
It's that way on purpose.

01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:55.100
And that is what makes that meddler coming in at the beginning so terrible in my mind, because the way that Rumble works for the vast majority of people who aren't as savvy as the people in this chat,

01:30:56.061 --> 01:30:59.463
It's got ads, and there's two of them every time, and they gotta click them away.

01:30:59.483 --> 01:31:02.245
I don't know how many times I've heard people say that they hate Rumble.

01:31:06.267 --> 01:31:18.154
Very clear to me that there is a long mentor chain of thoughtfulness with regard to answering some very crucial questions about what we can and can't understand about ourselves.

01:31:20.756 --> 01:31:23.598
And it's a, sorry, I thought my dog was gonna come in here.

01:31:24.758 --> 01:31:25.079
It's a,

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.321
It's become sort of my life now.

01:31:29.981 --> 01:31:35.642
It was COVID, but COVID has kind of passed for me because I understand it in a larger context now.

01:31:36.222 --> 01:31:50.165
And how, more importantly, after repeating over and over again for you and for many other people, that we actually inherited these charlatans from our parents, that I realized that I needed to explore the consequences of that idea.

01:31:52.245 --> 01:31:53.086
Oh, it's not going to work.

01:31:53.206 --> 01:31:56.808
I want to respond to some of the chat, but I can't really click out of here.

01:31:57.389 --> 01:31:59.110
We're just going to listen to this for a little bit.

01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:21.124
I know it seems kind of weird for me to watch this as a study hall, but I really wanted to emphasize, first of all, the beginning and how that happens and what that represents, what connections you can make there, how ridiculous it is that somebody said that we have to stop everything, you know, stop the whole enterprise and listen for a second.

01:32:23.536 --> 01:32:25.098
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:32:25.118 --> 01:32:26.259
That's how close we are.

01:32:26.299 --> 01:32:27.560
That's how desperate they are.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.744
That's how little actual, you know, ground is left to cover.

01:32:33.946 --> 01:32:34.746
They're scrambling.

01:32:35.887 --> 01:32:40.832
And this, I really, when I watched it again, this morning, I was actually

01:32:42.574 --> 01:32:49.621
I was blown away at what I was able to articulate, having nothing but these notes right here.

01:32:49.661 --> 01:32:52.144
I just had these notes, and I knew what I was going to do.

01:32:52.784 --> 01:32:59.291
And you can see here that I have four PDFs open, and I don't know when I'm going to go to which PDF.

01:32:59.351 --> 01:33:02.674
I'm just going to start with the book that we started with, Biology 101.

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:19.484
And so rather than doing it again for you, I think it's just better to watch it here and see what consequences of that idea, of course, are having to go back to those times and those books and actually read them to see how it is that we got to the point where we are, where people are very.

01:33:20.604 --> 01:33:22.704
somehow able to go in front of a stage.

01:33:22.745 --> 01:33:25.925
I think the best example that I have, I'm just going to take a cut right here.

01:33:25.945 --> 01:33:29.626
I have little notes and I'm just going to grab this notes here.

01:33:29.646 --> 01:33:31.186
I'm going to drop this in the chat.

01:33:32.327 --> 01:33:35.547
It is a YouTube video that I would like to assign to you as homework.

01:33:37.368 --> 01:33:41.228
I'm going to get that one up right now because I think it's really good for you guys to have it too.

01:33:43.309 --> 01:33:47.050
That should be in my history over here somewhere from the other day.

01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:47.830
Let's go down.

01:33:49.025 --> 01:33:49.926
Don't look too hard.

01:33:50.186 --> 01:33:54.971
You'll see all kinds of crazy videos that I click on and it's just the way it is.

01:33:55.332 --> 01:34:01.758
There's all kinds of videos there that my sons watch too because sometimes they're logged into me so that I don't have to worry about it.

01:34:02.839 --> 01:34:07.504
Maybe I should search myself better here.

01:34:07.524 --> 01:34:09.046
Let's go up to the top.

01:34:11.603 --> 01:34:29.148
and uh let's see all these solar storm people um we want to watch adam ruther that's what we want search no videos what um jeans

01:34:30.552 --> 01:34:30.872
Search.

01:34:31.792 --> 01:34:32.312
There it is.

01:34:32.432 --> 01:34:34.973
Greg, everything you wanted to know about genetics is wrong.

01:34:35.053 --> 01:34:41.194
So this is the video that I think everybody could watch as, you know, when you're bored, watch the homework here.

01:34:41.795 --> 01:34:43.435
And maybe that's what we should do right now.

01:34:46.036 --> 01:34:49.436
Maybe instead, that's what we should do is watch this and then talk about it.

01:34:50.136 --> 01:34:50.977
Did I download it?

01:34:51.017 --> 01:34:52.457
Maybe I downloaded it already.

01:34:54.278 --> 01:34:55.279
Let me escape out of here.

01:34:55.339 --> 01:35:07.772
Maybe instead of watching me, which is what you can do later, maybe we should instead do something together, like watch Adam's video and see if... I didn't completely screw it up.

01:35:07.872 --> 01:35:08.713
That would be here.

01:35:11.826 --> 01:35:14.727
and everything you know about viruses is wrong is right there.

01:35:14.827 --> 01:35:28.631
What I've discovered over the last 10 years is that compared to subjects like physics, particularly quantum physics or astrophysics, where the concepts are so distant from us as people,

01:35:29.753 --> 01:35:38.441
that they're almost easier to understand, especially they're easier to understand when there's revelation or when new discoveries are made.

01:35:39.382 --> 01:35:45.348
In contrast, genetics, human genetics, is fundamentally about families, inheritance, and sex.

01:35:45.928 --> 01:35:49.632
And these are things that we all experience and we think we know about.

01:35:50.112 --> 01:35:51.393
And what science does

01:35:52.578 --> 01:35:54.900
is remove those biases.

01:35:55.180 --> 01:36:01.984
It removes the ways that we think we perceive the world and tries to describe how they actually are.

01:36:02.865 --> 01:36:16.134
And so, in genetics, I find my thesis is that when we talk about inheritance, when we talk about genetics, when we talk about families and we talk about sex, we come with a load of baggage which has turned out to be not quite what is true.

01:36:17.014 --> 01:36:23.495
Anyway, so we come with a lot of baggage that has turned out to be not quite what is true.

01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:34.197
Now, this is going to be a talk where someone is going to try to hold a whole set of contradictory ideas up over their head and pretend that they're coherent.

01:36:35.318 --> 01:36:37.998
And they are, in his mind, extremely coherent.

01:36:38.118 --> 01:36:38.478
Why?

01:36:38.938 --> 01:36:41.739
Because we just don't quite understand

01:36:43.605 --> 01:36:50.783
As Schrodinger said, we just don't quite understand the obvious inability, that's what it is,

01:36:52.483 --> 01:37:03.093
that would be here, the obvious inability of present day physics and chemistry to account for such events is no reason at all for doubting that they can be accounted for by those sciences.

01:37:04.014 --> 01:37:05.695
So this guy is under that spell.

01:37:05.916 --> 01:37:17.647
It is the same spell that anybody who really, really, really learns this biology 101 stuff well, like I did, that's the spell that you are put under.

01:37:19.062 --> 01:37:24.387
And it is a spell where evolution is real because DNA.

01:37:26.849 --> 01:37:29.911
That's my best RNA cannot pandemic version of this.

01:37:30.652 --> 01:37:33.074
Evolution is real because DNA.

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:37.758
That's really the central dogma of modern biomedicine.

01:37:39.039 --> 01:37:43.163
Evolution is real because DNA.

01:37:44.864 --> 01:37:52.848
And that's the story that he's going to tell you, despite also admitting that DNA is not life.

01:37:52.928 --> 01:37:55.389
Like DNA is not who we are.

01:37:56.590 --> 01:37:59.811
So he's going to have to juggle those two very adeptly.

01:38:00.532 --> 01:38:12.598
And if you can hear the contradictions when they come as kind of like a little ring, you know, where something is off and then you hear this, you know,

01:38:14.178 --> 01:38:16.800
In the back, you're like, wait, no, no, that's wrong.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:17.980
And we'll hear it.

01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:19.121
So let's go.

01:38:21.623 --> 01:38:28.947
The sort of subtitle to this is why we are culturally programmed to misunderstand how genetics works.

01:38:29.388 --> 01:38:32.369
And I'm going to start with a story about this man.

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:39.074
We are culturally programmed to misunderstand how genetics works.

01:38:40.683 --> 01:38:44.906
Wow, I actually didn't catch that the first time I watched this video.

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:48.028
Holy cow, that is a beautiful statement.

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:50.029
I almost think we should listen to it again.

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:55.493
Title to this is, Why We Are Culturally Programmed to Misunderstand How Genetics Works.

01:38:55.973 --> 01:38:58.535
And I'm gonna start with a story about this man.

01:38:58.615 --> 01:39:03.438
This is Charles II of Spain, so Carlos II.

01:39:03.518 --> 01:39:06.180
And he was, Carlos was the last ruling member

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.281
of the Habsburg dynasty.

01:39:08.301 --> 01:39:17.308
And the Habsburgs, who many of you will know from studying genetics and from studying history, were the most powerful family in Europe.

01:39:18.154 --> 01:39:19.735
for almost 200 years until 1700.

01:39:21.916 --> 01:39:33.803
During that time, the Habsburg family provided six Holy Roman Emperors and ruled the largest chunk of Europe right down to the Spanish Peninsula for almost 200 years.

01:39:34.663 --> 01:39:38.585
But it ended when Charles II died, aged 38 in 1700, because he didn't leave a son or heir.

01:39:43.715 --> 01:39:49.619
And the reason he didn't leave a son or heir was because he was profoundly disabled.

01:39:49.659 --> 01:39:51.640
He had an extraordinarily troubled life.

01:39:52.781 --> 01:39:55.003
He didn't learn to walk until he was seven.

01:39:55.083 --> 01:39:56.964
He didn't learn to talk until he was about eight.

01:39:57.644 --> 01:39:59.245
He was physically disabled.

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:00.506
He was mentally disabled.

01:40:01.447 --> 01:40:04.729
And he got weirder and more disabled during the course of his life.

01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:09.452
By the time he was 14, the rule was effectively given to his aunt.

01:40:10.233 --> 01:40:10.993
But he lived until he was 38.

01:40:11.814 --> 01:40:13.435
And he was almost certainly sterile.

01:40:14.796 --> 01:40:20.101
Several attempts were made for him to procreate with several different women, and they never conceived.

01:40:20.461 --> 01:40:24.505
So he was probably sterile, and possibly impotent as well.

01:40:24.845 --> 01:40:34.934
Now, for all of these reasons, the people of Spain gave him a nickname, which was Carlos el Jequitado, which means the hexed or the bewitched.

01:40:35.995 --> 01:40:36.916
And we now think,

01:40:38.524 --> 01:40:46.909
that he was hexed, he was bewitched, because of the really profound level of inbreeding that existed within this family.

01:40:47.389 --> 01:40:54.434
So the Habsburgs are known for their chin and their lip, that very distinctive facial characteristic which is passed down through the Habsburg family.

01:40:55.054 --> 01:40:57.838
probably because of this incredible level of inbreeding.

01:40:57.878 --> 01:40:59.380
And it's pretty ugly, right?

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:06.991
But actually, it was considered a badge of honor in terms of it being the stamp of divine rights, the stamp of royalty.

01:41:07.051 --> 01:41:09.254
So here's a few of his family members.

01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:17.633
So that's Charles, that's his uncle, that's another one of his ancestors, and another one, and this gentleman here is his aunt, actually.

01:41:18.754 --> 01:41:30.121
Now, when we see this characteristic, this Habsburg lip, all through these people, and we think about how inbred this family was, let's have a look at his family tree.

01:41:32.972 --> 01:41:38.596
So for the geneticists among you, in fact, for anyone who knows what a family tree should look like, this is not it.

01:41:39.056 --> 01:41:50.865
A family tree seven generations back, if you have two parents and four grandparents and eight great-grandparents, by the time you get seven generations back, you should have 250-odd people on your family tree.

01:41:51.225 --> 01:41:56.529
Actually, most people have fewer than that because most people are relatively inbred as humans are as a species.

01:41:56.969 --> 01:41:57.551
Charles had 29.

01:41:58.412 --> 01:41:59.795
So he just slipped that in there.

01:42:00.055 --> 01:42:03.182
Humans are inbred as a species already.

01:42:04.517 --> 01:42:07.720
but the Habsburgs were especially inbred.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.841
...on this family tree.

01:42:09.201 --> 01:42:15.626
So if we just take an example, this is Mariana of Austria, which is his mother, and this is Philip IV of Spain, which is his father.

01:42:15.947 --> 01:42:21.952
Now Maria Anna of Spain is Mariana of Austria's mother and Philip IV's sister.

01:42:21.992 --> 01:42:28.758
So this woman here is his... If your family tree does not branch, you might be a redneck.

01:42:29.679 --> 01:42:32.884
grandmother and aunt at the same time.

01:42:33.605 --> 01:42:39.194
What that means is that this woman, Margarita of Austria, is his great-grandmother

01:42:40.424 --> 01:42:51.368
and grandmother at exactly the same time, which means that this person, Charles, here, is his great-great-grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-great-grandfather, all at the same time.

01:42:51.548 --> 01:42:58.631
Basically, on a family tree, you should never see loops like this, and like this, and like this, and like this.

01:42:59.132 --> 01:43:07.395
And what we think this means genetically is that, well, in fact, we know this because it's been calculated in 2011 by a Spanish group who analyzed his genome.

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.561
His inbreeding coefficient is about 0.254.

01:43:11.621 --> 01:43:36.665
What that means is more than a quarter of his genes are identical on both chromosomes, which means that the possibility there being recessive disorders emerging, because they didn't have a dominant characteristic, a corrective one on one chromosome, means that a quarter of all of his genomic material is subject to being homozygous at every single allele, which is more than if a brother and a sister successfully have a child.

01:43:36.705 --> 01:43:37.345
So basically,

01:43:38.566 --> 01:43:40.949
Genetically, he was a mess.

01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:48.298
And it all starts, in fact, up here with this woman, Joanna of Castile.

01:43:48.338 --> 01:43:52.723
Now, her nickname was La Loca.

01:43:53.604 --> 01:43:55.045
Any Spanish speakers amongst you?

01:43:55.065 --> 01:43:58.606
La Loco means the crazy, or the insane, or the mad.

01:43:58.686 --> 01:44:06.630
She had some severe mental health issues which we haven't been able to accurately, posthumously diagnose.

01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:12.992
But in terms of the family tree, at the level that she was at, there should be 32 women.

01:44:15.933 --> 01:44:18.334
of one generational line at that level.

01:44:18.414 --> 01:44:27.677
Now, because there are so many intergenerational breeding processes in this family tree, actually we don't have clear generational lines in this family tree.

01:44:28.277 --> 01:44:38.360
But in the two lines that she occupies, there should be 32 and 64 women, and she occupies 14 spaces, which should be individual women.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.141
So the basic point to this is that

01:44:42.634 --> 01:44:49.536
Inbreeding is really, really bad for families, but really, really good for geneticists.

01:44:51.016 --> 01:44:51.776
I'm sorry, what?

01:44:53.676 --> 01:44:54.257
I'm sorry, what?

01:44:54.277 --> 01:45:05.039
The big point to this is that inbreeding is really, really bad for families, but really, really good for geneticists.

01:45:06.677 --> 01:45:10.343
And that's not really relevant, that guy there, but he's just there.

01:45:11.445 --> 01:45:12.626
That's my next king.

01:45:12.646 --> 01:45:18.896
All right, so when we're talking about family trees, we just go through some of the basics of biology, which all of you will know very well.

01:45:19.156 --> 01:45:21.580
This is the first really important family tree that was ever drawn.

01:45:22.381 --> 01:45:37.574
1837, Charles Darwin sketched down this in one of his notebooks and where he was beginning to think, following his trip on the Beagle, he was beginning to think about how characteristics were passed from generation to generation and how that resulted in the diversity and radiation of species.

01:45:37.995 --> 01:45:43.880
And Darwin was keenly aware that no common ancestors were currently present now,

01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:49.923
By definition, the process that he was imagining meant that they wouldn't be present now.

01:45:50.103 --> 01:45:51.944
We only have the present forms.

01:45:52.744 --> 01:46:00.247
We only have the one snapshot of the contemporary collection at the end of this process.

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:05.869
If this process were real, if this really explained and is explanatory all the way back,

01:46:07.574 --> 01:46:16.577
to a single cell that we all evolved from, which is what this mythology professes, because again, evolution is real because DNA.

01:46:19.338 --> 01:46:36.043
And so here you have Darwin hypothesizing about predecessors and shared common ancestors without any evidence for it and without any biological material or explanation for how that might occur.

01:46:37.659 --> 01:46:41.066
And so again, evolution because DNA, that's it.

01:46:41.727 --> 01:46:49.021
The whole thing is evolution because DNA and it's, it's an absolute, it's a disaster.

01:46:50.342 --> 01:46:53.904
And 20 years later, he would publish the most important book ever written.

01:46:55.746 --> 01:46:56.726
So this is a family tree.

01:46:56.746 --> 01:46:58.568
This is an incredibly important family tree.

01:46:59.248 --> 01:47:02.030
In terms of what it looks like now, well, actually in 2003.

01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:09.495
So this is a very famous phylogenetic tree of, well, it shows the diversity of life on Earth in general.

01:47:10.175 --> 01:47:12.657
But actually, it's changed since then.

01:47:12.817 --> 01:47:25.488
But what this shows is about 2,000 individual species, which you can just about make out that these little hairs on the edge of this circle are, in fact, individual species, so all of bacteria.

01:47:25.588 --> 01:47:28.350
This is a PDF that you can download and zoom in on.

01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:31.953
And the idea is that they've ranked or ordered all of these

01:47:32.774 --> 01:47:45.923
contemporary life forms into a hierarchy of complexity and a relationship that seems to imply common ancestry with absolutely zero data on the common ancestors.

01:47:47.204 --> 01:47:47.585
None.

01:47:48.505 --> 01:47:49.086
Zero.

01:47:50.947 --> 01:47:55.010
The assumption is that those common ancestors exist because DNA.

01:47:57.054 --> 01:47:58.615
Evolution because DNA.

01:47:58.675 --> 01:48:01.296
So we can make this map because there's DNA.

01:48:01.376 --> 01:48:05.278
And so obviously, this map must be true because DNA.

01:48:06.359 --> 01:48:10.341
Archaea are crammed in here, which is not really representative of how the truth is.

01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:12.962
But you've got process, which is single-cell eukaryotes here.

01:48:12.982 --> 01:48:17.044
You've got plants up here, animals there, and a big chunk of fungi down here.

01:48:17.264 --> 01:48:20.526
The origin of life is there, where

01:48:22.977 --> 01:48:36.425
The origin of life is depicted on this screen that purports to construct or represent a phylogenetic relationship of evolution of 2,000 organisms on the planet.

01:48:36.805 --> 01:48:37.505
Stop lying!

01:48:37.826 --> 01:48:39.446
Do you see how bad it is?

01:48:41.428 --> 01:48:48.992
That if you really work hard, I mean really work hard to learn this and the book that comes after it, this is where you get.

01:48:51.141 --> 01:48:53.309
And you can very vigorously explain it.

01:48:55.837 --> 01:48:57.242
Like a well-trained acolyte.

01:48:57.898 --> 01:49:06.700
The first living cell that we refer to as Leuka, the last universal common ancestor, speciated and divided into two branches, Archaea and Bacteria.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.540
And that happens roundabout there.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:16.181
I've got a whole other talk about why the sentence I just said is entirely wrong, but you'll have to come back another time for that.

01:49:16.421 --> 01:49:24.523
And incidentally, if you're a little bit anthropocentric, if you're interested in humans, just focus up there, and that is where we are.

01:49:25.606 --> 01:49:40.594
Okay, so those ideas about the radiation of life on Earth, the branching tree-like structure of how evolution by natural selection works, that was all happening in the mid-19th century.

01:49:40.954 --> 01:49:54.161
And as all students of genetics and the history of science know, around about the same time, Gregor Mendel, a monk and scientist, I don't really like calling him a monk, he may have been a monk, but he was a much better scientist

01:49:55.161 --> 01:50:01.125
He was a pretty good monk as well, so he was a good monk and a good scientist, but I'm just going to call him a scientist.

01:50:02.146 --> 01:50:09.872
He was coming up with the rules of inheritance by breeding his pea plants together, 29,000 pea plants bred together to produce

01:50:10.892 --> 01:50:17.735
Mendelian rules, the rules of how characteristics are passed on from generation to generation, as every school kid has learned.

01:50:18.575 --> 01:50:25.138
And he was prefiguring, of course, Darwin didn't know about this work, but it would all come together at the beginning of the 20th century.

01:50:25.678 --> 01:50:32.181
So, you know, the fruit fly is an incredibly important model species for genetics in the early 20th century.

01:50:32.281 --> 01:50:37.683
Did he just skip over the fact that those 29,000 pea plants that he bred were bred to be

01:50:39.437 --> 01:50:40.638
pure breeding plants.

01:50:41.499 --> 01:50:56.349
They were inbred, selectively inbred, to create the signal to noise ratio that would result in the Punnett square assortment of certain obvious phenotypes.

01:50:58.211 --> 01:51:00.753
Not that dissimilar from the Habsburg family.

01:51:03.154 --> 01:51:06.337
Another obvious biological anomaly

01:51:07.264 --> 01:51:14.690
that probably isn't giving us that much insight into how a healthy human is generated, but how it can go drastically wrong.

01:51:15.151 --> 01:51:35.928
And yet our very basis for the Human Genome Project, whose paper in Nature starts out with the rediscovery of the Mendelian laws of genetics in the early 20th century, yada, yada, yada, is exactly the same place that this guy just thinks we have to take for granted because evolution, because DNA.

01:51:37.506 --> 01:51:41.331
century in the fly labs in New York, T.H.

01:51:41.371 --> 01:51:52.266
Morgan was working out that individual characteristics were carried on individual bits of DNA and chromosomes and that these were accounting for characteristics like

01:51:53.007 --> 01:51:55.569
having red eyes and having white eyes in a fruit fly.

01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:56.590
And we do these experiments.

01:51:56.690 --> 01:52:13.845
And again, understand that because there are examples where phenotypes can sort by some, what appears to be a mathematical law, those laws only work when the signal to noise ratio is high enough, when there are enough particles above the noise in order to see that.

01:52:13.905 --> 01:52:18.870
That means you need inbred fly lines, you need inbred mice, you need an inbred family.

01:52:21.306 --> 01:52:26.852
Otherwise, there are no signals that you can point to as evidence for how this works.

01:52:26.932 --> 01:52:33.739
But those signals don't mean that we understand how it works well and how it moves forward through evolution.

01:52:34.199 --> 01:52:39.344
You're not actually arguing that the Habsburgs are an example of how evolution works.

01:52:39.424 --> 01:52:40.966
It's how evolution doesn't work.

01:52:43.683 --> 01:52:52.927
And so the passing along of those traits and their appearance in that family is only evident because of the aberrant nature of them as pattern integrities.

01:52:53.467 --> 01:53:05.212
Just in the same way that the only reason why there was any pattern for Mendel to find was because he created a pattern integrity that wasn't representative of what was in nature.

01:53:07.065 --> 01:53:17.512
in the same way that none of those inbred mice at the University of Pittsburgh or any of these other schools are representative of the pattern integrity of wild-type mice.

01:53:18.452 --> 01:53:26.017
And the biology that we learn from them is very likely inapplicable because of its anecdotal qualities.

01:53:29.909 --> 01:53:39.892
And certainly it's not definitive if this, this guy's talking about is how it is the foundational cornerstones of all that we understand since.

01:53:39.912 --> 01:53:50.416
No, it has been fundamentally a wrong direction, an assumption that has led us to create all kinds of fake fields of knowledge.

01:53:51.656 --> 01:53:54.999
And we cannot teach these fake fields of knowledge to our children.

01:53:55.019 --> 01:54:04.489
Experiments at school and as undergraduates where you take white eyed flies and you take red eyed flies and you breed them together and you get proportions of red and white eyed flies and you never get pink eyed flies.

01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:11.956
And so again we began to understand how units of inheritance are passed from generation to generation.

01:54:12.857 --> 01:54:27.448
I am making the argument that these units of inheritance that they point to as fundamental portions of our biology are actually only properties of the stupid, awful models that they've emerged from.

01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:33.913
And we have been led to believe that these are the foundations of biology.

01:54:33.953 --> 01:54:39.558
That's the same bullshit as somebody who studies yeast and says that what they're looking at is prions.

01:54:40.734 --> 01:54:50.354
It's the same as somebody who studies phages and bacteria and says that they're studying the same viruses and the kind of thing that other virus people study in us.

01:54:50.935 --> 01:54:51.917
This is wrong.

01:54:54.778 --> 01:55:04.822
and how characters, how particular traits emerge in organisms and fruit flies and humans and pea plants as a result of those Mendelian rules of inheritance.

01:55:05.262 --> 01:55:10.464
Of course, in 1953, the double helix, the structure of DNA was elucidated.

01:55:11.044 --> 01:55:15.006
The fact that DNA was the hereditary material was known before that in the late 30s.

01:55:15.026 --> 01:55:23.569
So less than 10 years before this book was written, in the same few years that this book was finally released and published,

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:41.333
We discovered the chemical structure of DNA that allowed us to make the argument that it could be the transmission mechanism of all the information necessary for life.

01:55:42.972 --> 01:55:44.993
Evolution because DNA.

01:55:45.073 --> 01:55:46.074
This is it right here.

01:55:58.542 --> 01:56:03.425
Ray Gosling, Maurice Wilkins, and primarily Rosalind Franklin, who generated this image.

01:56:03.745 --> 01:56:12.169
Actually, Ray Gosling took the photo, but Rosalind Franklin was the expert on X-ray crystallography, generated this image, which is known as Photograph 51.

01:56:13.089 --> 01:56:22.474
Incidentally, just opened in the West End in London last week is the play called Photograph 51, with Nicole Kidman playing Rosalind Franklin.

01:56:23.715 --> 01:56:25.456
I haven't seen it yet, but it's had very good reviews.

01:56:25.876 --> 01:56:26.456
So how about that?

01:56:28.818 --> 01:56:45.058
Crick and Watson acquired that data and over the course of a few months at the beginning of 1953 worked out that the double helix is the structure of DNA and that that allowed the mechanism for the transfer of information from generation to generation.

01:56:45.738 --> 01:56:47.159
Evolution because DNA.

01:56:47.219 --> 01:56:51.521
The structure of DNA is probably the most important scientific discovery of the 20th century.

01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:53.442
The structure is most important.

01:56:53.482 --> 01:56:57.164
The structure is what gives it all of its divine powers.

01:56:57.824 --> 01:57:01.426
Its structure is what underlies its super abilities.

01:57:02.486 --> 01:57:14.192
Its abilities to transcend normal physical and chemical laws, and its ability to be at the center of the transmission of all the information of life from the mud puddle all the way from the lightning bolt to us.

01:57:15.268 --> 01:57:26.592
Listen to it carefully because these are the bamboozling cartoons and the bamboozling sort of biology 101 schtick that everyone is under the spell of right now.

01:57:27.913 --> 01:57:29.953
From your high school teacher to mine.

01:57:31.754 --> 01:57:37.176
And we need to fundamentally change this in the coming years or we are in trouble and I think we can do it.

01:57:37.276 --> 01:57:37.536
I do.

01:57:39.798 --> 01:57:44.843
It is because the structure, the double helix, is inherent to its function.

01:57:45.264 --> 01:57:57.836
It's not just that it's pretty, it's not just that this is how it's packaged up together, but the fact that it is in this double helical shape, this twisted ladder, it gives it, it bestows two specific things that DNA can do.

01:57:58.297 --> 01:58:01.680
The first is that it allows replication of that molecule.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:06.901
perfect replication where if you take the ladders, and I know you all know this, but I'm going to go through it anyway.

01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:16.424
If you take the two branches of the ladders, which are held together with the struts by the nuclear bases, A, C, T, and G, they pair up in a particular way.

01:58:16.444 --> 01:58:19.605
A pairs with T, C pairs with G, and if you split them up,

01:58:20.225 --> 01:58:24.666
You have all the A's and T's and C's and G's on one side, which means you know what's missing from the other side.

01:58:25.006 --> 01:58:31.828
So you can split this molecule in two and you have all the information on both strands, which allows you to replace the missing strands.

01:58:32.328 --> 01:58:38.029
So where you have one molecule at first, through the process of replication, you have two molecules afterwards.

01:58:38.389 --> 01:58:46.111
And that goes on in every living cell and has been going on in every living cell for the last four billion years in an absolute continuous way.

01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:54.334
So now, in this beautiful animation of a double-stranded DNA being copied, both strands being proofread, all this stuff, there's no water molecules in this video.

01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:19.556
I don't know where the bases are and how they're getting to the enzyme in the right order.

01:59:21.038 --> 01:59:26.023
I can't see any chaperone proteins or other stuff going on here.

01:59:26.064 --> 01:59:27.285
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

01:59:27.305 --> 01:59:31.270
I guess they have the water molecules set for invisible.

01:59:32.171 --> 01:59:33.873
I'm sure they're in their model though, right?

01:59:35.646 --> 01:59:44.449
And so they showed you photograph 53, which was not exactly a photograph of a double helix, an electron or x-ray crystallography.

01:59:44.489 --> 01:59:46.230
It wasn't exactly a double helix.

01:59:47.250 --> 01:59:52.852
But now they're very happy to show you a computer animated model.

01:59:53.843 --> 01:59:58.627
of how DNA is copied having almost no data to back this up.

01:59:58.928 --> 02:00:08.536
The data that they have to back it up actually probably looks a lot like the data that they use to back up a lot of virology stuff.

02:00:08.576 --> 02:00:10.198
It probably looks like data like this.

02:00:11.636 --> 02:00:15.337
And then somebody said, well, because this band is there and that band is there.

02:00:15.637 --> 02:00:18.698
And we did another experiment where these signals were there.

02:00:18.798 --> 02:00:21.399
Then we can make that cartoon because that's probably what's happening.

02:00:21.719 --> 02:00:24.300
That's exactly where we are right now.

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:27.701
That's exactly where biology 101 is.

02:00:27.741 --> 02:00:30.042
That's exactly where virology is right now.

02:00:31.465 --> 02:00:33.468
because they can make these fancy cartoons.

02:00:33.508 --> 02:00:41.859
They can say whatever nonsense they want and imply all the fidelity they want and exaggerate as much as they want as long as they have a cartoon to back it up.

02:00:43.991 --> 02:00:58.340
And I don't know if Adam Rutherford is just completely bamboozled like I was when I was a grad student or when I was a wannabe tenure professor, but I can tell you for sure that at some point I was exactly as bamboozled as this guy is.

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:03.843
And I come to you as humbly as I possibly can to submit that this is me eating crow.

02:01:06.765 --> 02:01:10.647
I didn't figure this out until very recently, thanks to people like Dennis Noble,

02:01:13.951 --> 02:01:18.193
and Peter Hotez for getting me to read Teilhard de Chardin.

02:01:18.233 --> 02:01:23.436
And once reading Teilhard de Chardin, once reading Hilary Koprowski in this book, I can see it.

02:01:23.816 --> 02:01:25.477
Now I can see how I've been fooled.

02:01:25.917 --> 02:01:31.240
Once I've read this guy's words and what he admits in this book, I can see how I was fooled.

02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.661
I can see how we've all been fooled.

02:01:34.062 --> 02:01:44.346
And we will continue to fool each other with this illusion of consensus about what has been figured out and the implications of it being evolution because DNA.

02:01:46.887 --> 02:01:47.287
Strands.

02:01:48.107 --> 02:01:49.788
There is one single strand there.

02:01:50.268 --> 02:01:52.169
There is the other single strand there.

02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:59.131
Now, as the single strands wind out, they then fed into another protein complex where the missing strand is replaced.

02:01:59.792 --> 02:02:00.132
So you get

02:02:01.258 --> 02:02:06.981
One double helix being split in two and then replaced into two double helices.

02:02:07.622 --> 02:02:12.505
So one double helix, one, and then the second double helix there.

02:02:13.165 --> 02:02:15.186
So this is the process by which replication occurs.

02:02:15.206 --> 02:02:17.487
This is the process going on in your cells right now.

02:02:17.547 --> 02:02:24.331
It's been going on continuously in every cell that has ever existed and every organism that has ever existed since around about 3.9 billion years ago.

02:02:25.612 --> 02:02:27.914
That's an incredible level of certainty.

02:02:27.994 --> 02:02:33.058
It's an incredible level of certainty that explains almost all of time.

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:41.265
Just this animation right here, just imagine it everywhere and then you pretty much understand evolution because DNA.

02:02:41.325 --> 02:02:41.925
Do you see it?

02:02:42.606 --> 02:02:43.226
Can you see it?

02:02:44.087 --> 02:02:48.371
This is the absolutely, it's like getting hit in the head with a hammer for me.

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:54.704
Because I was so enthusiastically into the idea that, wow, I understand.

02:02:54.724 --> 02:02:57.048
I get it now.

02:03:00.013 --> 02:03:02.658
So much so that I was happy to teach it to high school kids.

02:03:08.041 --> 02:03:21.317
So excited that I wanted tenure at any university that would have me, because I wanted to study the brain and how the brain was actually the end product of a billion year process of physics and chemistry.

02:03:25.362 --> 02:03:26.444
Which is pretty impressive.

02:03:27.932 --> 02:03:30.053
So that's the first thing that DNA does.

02:03:30.093 --> 02:03:34.834
And the second thing that DNA does is that it is effectively a code, or it contains a code.

02:03:35.154 --> 02:03:41.836
Because those letters, those nuclear bases on the inside of the double helix, form a language.

02:03:42.157 --> 02:03:48.539
A language that, as Erwin Schrodinger characterized it in this book, it is a language

02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.922
Remarkable language.

02:03:58.182 --> 02:03:58.923
It is really.

02:04:01.404 --> 02:04:02.665
It's a remarkable language.

02:04:04.707 --> 02:04:07.368
Because what is it?

02:04:07.568 --> 02:04:13.952
It is very, very much it is the it is very much

02:04:21.758 --> 02:04:24.400
But the term code script is of course too narrow.

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:29.923
The chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in bringing about the development they foreshadow.

02:04:29.963 --> 02:04:38.228
They are law code and executive power, or to use another simile, they are architect's plan and builder's craft in one.

02:04:38.288 --> 02:04:48.574
And so let's see if we have both the architect's plan and the builder's craft in one in the description here from Mr. Rutherford.

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:55.868
And this was worked out in the years after 1953 up until the 70s.

02:04:56.348 --> 02:05:04.518
But in fact, the way that the letters were arranged in a particular order encoded the basic units of proteins, which are amino acids.

02:05:05.019 --> 02:05:08.283
And amino acids string together to form proteins, and proteins

02:05:09.324 --> 02:05:12.790
All life is made of or by proteins.

02:05:14.353 --> 02:05:20.183
So they worked out by the end of the 1970s, and this is the doctrine, the central doctrine.

02:05:23.635 --> 02:05:33.039
which everyone knows that DNA is a code and via the intermediate molecule RNA it makes protein and all life is made of or by protein.

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:45.625
Except for when you have RNA that has a fear and cleavage site in it because then RNA can all by itself express proteins in white-tailed deer and humans for many many years in a row.

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:48.593
Francis Crick called this the central dogma.

02:05:49.153 --> 02:05:51.735
We don't really like the word dogma in science.

02:05:52.115 --> 02:05:55.417
And in the 1970s, he was asked why he named it the central dogma.

02:05:55.697 --> 02:06:01.241
And his answer was that he didn't really know what the word dogma meant, which was unfortunate.

02:06:01.801 --> 02:06:03.862
But it just shows that geniuses can be idiots.

02:06:05.103 --> 02:06:07.425
Anyway, so that's a brief history of genetics.

02:06:07.465 --> 02:06:15.952
That takes us up to the 1980s, where we had really seriously begun to elucidate how biology works, how life works.

02:06:16.353 --> 02:06:24.180
We had established, effectively, three grand unifying theories of biology, which all say the same thing.

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:26.542
Are there any physicists here?

02:06:27.342 --> 02:06:27.683
Three!

02:06:27.763 --> 02:06:28.423
Here it comes!

02:06:28.483 --> 02:06:28.964
None at all.

02:06:29.004 --> 02:06:29.384
That's good.

02:06:29.424 --> 02:06:30.425
I can make this joke now.

02:06:30.805 --> 02:06:35.650
Physicists have been trying to come up with a grand unifying theory of everything for about 3,000 years.

02:06:36.130 --> 02:06:37.432
And how are they getting on with that?

02:06:38.252 --> 02:06:38.993
Not that well.

02:06:39.413 --> 02:06:43.057
In biology, we managed to do it three times in the space of 100 years.

02:06:43.117 --> 02:06:45.979
And the first is Evolution by Natural Selection by Darwin.

02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:50.544
Actually, the first chronologically came a few years before that, and it's called Cell Theory.

02:06:51.303 --> 02:07:08.134
it's weirdly uncontroversial cell theory and it's weirdly not focused on when taught but i think in a slightly revisionist way it should be cell theory very clearly states two things which are universally true all like the theory states two things that are universally true

02:07:12.867 --> 02:07:13.568
OK, go ahead.

02:07:13.688 --> 02:07:19.514
Life is made of cells, and cells, I think, in a slightly revisionist way it should be.

02:07:19.935 --> 02:07:23.218
Cell theory very clearly states two things which are universally true.

02:07:23.699 --> 02:07:31.407
All life is made of cells, and cells only ever come from existing cells, with one exception, which is the origin of life.

02:07:33.128 --> 02:07:36.570
So this is just a universal rule, and it's good to have universal rules.

02:07:36.730 --> 02:07:37.290
That's fantastic.

02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:38.771
It means you can set up a framework.

02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:42.973
It's great to have universal rules, especially if they're really dumb.

02:07:43.033 --> 02:07:45.215
From which you can invent your next questions.

02:07:45.475 --> 02:07:45.575
Okay.

02:07:45.595 --> 02:07:46.115
So that's two.

02:07:46.175 --> 02:07:46.535
What was it?

02:07:46.595 --> 02:07:48.296
Natural selection, cell theory.

02:07:48.396 --> 02:07:49.197
Oh yeah, and the third one,

02:07:49.557 --> 02:07:52.119
So actually, he stated it, but he didn't do it very well.

02:07:52.199 --> 02:07:54.642
Cell theory came before evolutionary theory.

02:07:54.702 --> 02:07:55.903
That's what he said.

02:07:56.003 --> 02:07:56.883
Universal genetics.

02:07:57.144 --> 02:08:04.890
All living organisms, all of those cells, since LUCA for the last 4 billion years, have used exactly the same system to encode their proteins and to reproduce.

02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:06.812
So, you know, we've got it.

02:08:06.892 --> 02:08:08.253
By the end of the... We've got it.

02:08:08.373 --> 02:08:08.654
We've got it.

02:08:12.896 --> 02:08:38.510
And now in order for the no-sphere to form, in order that one consciousness, one vision, one idea, one notion of who we are as a species, that can finally happen now that we finally have these uniting rules and these uniting ideas about who we are and about the role of God.

02:08:39.727 --> 02:08:41.368
God is just a hands-off dude.

02:08:41.928 --> 02:08:45.390
He just got this thing rolling, and then after that, he just let it go.

02:08:45.891 --> 02:08:49.653
And so now that we understand God's creation, we better take the wheel.

02:08:55.557 --> 02:08:57.258
That's what Biology 101 does.

02:08:57.318 --> 02:09:00.159
I never thought I'd say it, but that's what Biology 101 does.

02:09:03.021 --> 02:09:06.183
It is a very slippery slope when it is presented like this.

02:09:07.044 --> 02:09:09.205
It's a very slick sail.

02:09:11.471 --> 02:09:16.374
It sure is enticing, especially to somebody who doesn't know all the details that are missing here.

02:09:16.535 --> 02:09:22.239
All the, hasn't spent their whole life gazing out the window going, how in the hell did that happen?

02:09:25.821 --> 02:09:31.625
How is it possible that all that's out there, so beautiful and perfect?

02:09:33.606 --> 02:09:39.911
Why don't we spend more time appreciating it, gardening it, as a caretaker,

02:09:41.647 --> 02:09:43.708
Why aren't we all gardeners and all farmers?

02:09:45.148 --> 02:09:48.109
Why don't we all have a farm full of animals?

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:54.330
Why aren't we all enjoying the fruits of creation?

02:09:56.031 --> 02:09:58.711
It's because these people don't want us to see the creator.

02:10:00.332 --> 02:10:07.714
They don't want us to appreciate the sacred irreducible complexity that was gifted to us in our child and in our world.

02:10:09.704 --> 02:10:15.069
They want us to see a job incomplete, a being imperfect.

02:10:15.129 --> 02:10:24.078
And in fact, they want us to forget about our role as an individual, forget about our own manifestation of the divine.

02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:29.103
That God lives in us, we don't want that, we don't want to think about that.

02:10:29.143 --> 02:10:33.668
We want to think of ourselves as part of a larger whole, this phenomenon of man.

02:10:40.116 --> 02:10:42.438
I don't think that's where I want to take my kids.

02:10:43.599 --> 02:10:49.984
And I don't think that that is the universal religion that I want to take hold in the world.

02:10:50.024 --> 02:10:51.886
And yet that's where this is progressing.

02:10:51.946 --> 02:11:07.078
That is the enticing offer that will be made in the coming years to all of these academics who have been looking for this higher calling, looking to explain and put into context their loss of touch with God.

02:11:10.501 --> 02:11:18.222
And it will be very enticing for them to accept this idea that God's a hands-off God, and that your understanding of evolution is your understanding of God.

02:11:18.262 --> 02:11:37.126
Your manifestation of our collective realization that we are generations of people, and so we should take... That's all very enticing to these people who have been godless for so long, who've been trying to juggle these incongruencies like I had been.

02:11:38.936 --> 02:11:59.387
But there's also a crucial window open here right now where this oversimplification, this incredible exaggeration of fidelity and understanding, this can all be dispelled like a bad dream if we can move in the right direction toward bringing this

02:12:01.758 --> 02:12:12.867
to the fore to our young people as they start to open their minds to biology and to adults who have tried to open their minds to biology and still have their minds open.

02:12:12.947 --> 02:12:14.849
We can still teach this.

02:12:16.170 --> 02:12:26.378
And once we see it, then all the certainty on PBS NewsHour and all the certainty of NIH and all the certainty of CDC and all the certainty of the who will all vanish.

02:12:29.278 --> 02:12:35.782
Because all of those certainties rest on the exact same certainty that this guy is displaying here.

02:12:36.422 --> 02:12:41.505
Which in this display is obviously just, you know, a house of cards.

02:12:44.267 --> 02:12:48.750
And at the bottom of the house of cards is just a t-shirt that says, evolution because DNA.

02:12:50.251 --> 02:12:50.591
That's it.

02:12:51.591 --> 02:12:57.335
Just like, don't talk about 2020, COVID shots are bad, or RNA can't pandemic.

02:12:59.913 --> 02:13:04.976
Simple messages will dispel this illusion.

02:13:05.776 --> 02:13:11.079
And it is not as simple as evolution because DNA, but that's exactly what you hear here.

02:13:11.519 --> 02:13:15.281
And I hope that you will take the time to listen to this yourself to hear it.

02:13:17.442 --> 02:13:19.823
70s we understood how all biology worked.

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:26.141
except it turned out to be much more complicated than anyone anticipated.

02:13:26.981 --> 02:13:42.424
The real reason that we do genetics or the real reason that genetics gets funded is so that we can begin to understand how human characteristics are passed on from generation to generation, and particularly how diseases manifest, in order that we might address those diseases.

02:13:42.864 --> 02:13:44.005
So what began to happen in the 1980s?

02:13:46.826 --> 02:13:58.750
once we understood the genetic code, once we understood how DNA works, once we understood how Mendelian inheritance worked, we began to look for the genetic causes of various diseases.

02:14:00.050 --> 02:14:11.594
And one of the first- What he means by looking for genetic causes is that doing genome-wide studies for signals that associate with symptomologies.

02:14:12.777 --> 02:14:22.863
ones was, so you know who Woody Guthrie was, the most famous folk singer, the most important folk singer of the 20th century, maybe Dylan, I don't know.

02:14:23.043 --> 02:14:31.568
Well, he died of Huntington's disease, and Huntington's disease is an incredibly penetrative disease, it's devastating, it is inevitably, always fatal.

02:14:32.188 --> 02:14:49.356
But it is passed down in families in a very clear Mendelian way, in exactly the same way that the eye colour in fruit flies is passed from generation to generation, and the same way that Mendel had established that the colour of his peas or the wrinkliness of his peas or the leaf shape of his petals was passed from generation to generation.

02:14:49.696 --> 02:14:57.639
The others that were beginning to be discovered in the late 80s was also Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis in 1986-87.

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:07.425
And so we'd really begun to understand the genetic cause, the underlying genetic cause, the genes that actually bestow.

02:15:07.605 --> 02:15:26.617
Imagine, for example, that you wanted to understand how it is that somebody, this is not me showing off, it is me doing an analogy, but imagine that you wanted to understand what happens in terms of in the piano when you go,

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:37.001
Oh, I don't remember.

02:15:37.041 --> 02:15:39.262
There we go.

02:15:39.282 --> 02:15:44.444
So you play Star Wars on the piano, and there's all those strings back there in a real piano.

02:15:44.844 --> 02:15:48.365
And then you get on a piano, and when you hit the C, nothing happens.

02:15:48.846 --> 02:15:50.006
It doesn't make any sound.

02:15:51.827 --> 02:15:52.327
Wow!

02:15:52.447 --> 02:15:56.449
This piano has a very special, rare condition.

02:15:57.827 --> 02:16:03.031
And it turns out when we open the piano that the C chord, the actual string is broken.

02:16:03.572 --> 02:16:05.753
And that's why the C doesn't make any noise.

02:16:05.793 --> 02:16:13.099
And it turns out that in every piano where the C string is broken, then the C key, it doesn't make any noise.

02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:14.780
Holy cow.

02:16:15.201 --> 02:16:16.101
Isn't that cool?

02:16:16.502 --> 02:16:24.648
And now we understand that when the key over here doesn't make any noise, then that's because it's very likely that that string is broken.

02:16:25.809 --> 02:16:26.730
Wow.

02:16:30.054 --> 02:16:35.396
Now I understand why Star Wars doesn't sound very good on this piano, but it sounds better on the piano with the sea.

02:16:38.138 --> 02:16:49.683
But do you understand anything about how the music is made on the piano or how those chords were designed or what the song is about or where the song came from or what the implications of the song would be and people that hear it?

02:16:50.803 --> 02:16:52.544
And when I made mistakes or when I didn't?

02:16:55.014 --> 02:17:12.100
And so what he's talking about here and what genome-wide association studies attempt to do and what they tricked all of neuroscience into doing when I started in the 2000s was to knock out a gene and then study the piano to see how songs sounded on that piano when you played it.

02:17:13.801 --> 02:17:18.902
And if it was missing a G or the middle G or a high G, then songs would sound different.

02:17:18.942 --> 02:17:23.204
Some songs wouldn't even be affected, but other songs would be affected.

02:17:25.387 --> 02:17:31.830
And so now, of course, you can see how a piano is a terribly uncomplex metaphor for the human body.

02:17:31.890 --> 02:17:52.380
But you can also understand how these kinds of examples that he cites as examples of edifying evidence that Mendelian laws are useful in studying our biology is just as dumb as saying that you understand how piano music works and what Beethoven was and Mozart were thinking.

02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:57.702
If you understand that the C key doesn't make sound, it's probably because the wire is disconnected.

02:18:00.563 --> 02:18:17.891
And so the complex, the exaggeration of the fidelity of understanding is, is that because these people can explain why when you disconnect certain strings, that certain songs don't sound very good, doesn't mean that they understand what Mozart's thinking.

02:18:20.034 --> 02:18:35.577
And understanding what Mozart's thinking when he plays at a piano is still a horribly insufficient level of irreducible complexity to understand what it is they are implying here, what they are implying incorrectly here.

02:18:37.765 --> 02:19:05.005
because we can associate some molecular signal with some phenotypes in some rare conditions, in some rare inbred pure strains, in some rare inbred families does not mean that those laws are a fundamental part of or an exhaustive explanation for who we are as a phenomenon.

02:19:08.274 --> 02:19:16.962
and who my daughter is and my sons are, and what they can be potentially as creative individuals.

02:19:19.164 --> 02:19:32.015
If you believe in evolution, somebody very close to me recently just said this absolutely brilliant thing that I have not been able to say so well, but if you believe in random evolution, then that means any individual could hold the trait

02:19:33.195 --> 02:19:48.764
any individual could evolve the random trait that all of humankind would need to move in the direction of the x-men with superpowers and levitation of teleportation if somebody is going to develop that that mutation at random

02:19:50.208 --> 02:19:59.652
and then need to pass it on to next generations with children, then any individual in an evolutionary scheme could potentially have that valuable trait.

02:19:59.972 --> 02:20:17.959
And in fact, in the evolutionary model that you would have to play in an honest brain that was trying to imagine it, it's gonna take a lots and lots and lots of positive traits that never make it to the next generation in order for this evolutionary process to have any chance

02:20:19.514 --> 02:20:22.456
of having a successful direction in terms of complexity.

02:20:23.297 --> 02:20:31.582
It all just falls woefully short of explaining anything, and yet we are supposed to accept that evolution because DNA.

02:20:32.182 --> 02:20:37.746
And in fact, academic biology has been led to know God because DNA.

02:20:39.465 --> 02:20:39.865
That's it.

02:20:40.786 --> 02:20:43.827
That is what this guy got in trouble for.

02:20:44.508 --> 02:20:56.414
Because he is essentially saying that from the time that he got condemned for pushing the pith down man idea in the 20s, this guy got thrown out.

02:20:56.474 --> 02:21:01.717
They didn't allow him to publish this work until he was dead or close to his death.

02:21:03.134 --> 02:21:10.456
Because this work essentially says that, you know, no God because DNA, no God because evolution, evolution because DNA.

02:21:11.337 --> 02:21:15.018
That's the little hamster wheel that we've been in for the last two generations.

02:21:16.038 --> 02:21:29.863
And it is the hamster wheel that we stay in if we buy that virology is a very high fidelity thing, that the Human Genome Project solved the big problem, and that Kevin McKernan is one of the foremost experts on the problems it's solving.

02:21:31.769 --> 02:21:35.250
to particular devastating diseases on people.

02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:42.911
Now, during the late 80s into the 90s, individual labs around the world were working on specific diseases.

02:21:42.951 --> 02:21:46.312
That tended to be how people worked in genetics in those days.

02:21:46.352 --> 02:21:49.892
You looked at a specific disease and tried to establish its underlying mechanism.

02:21:49.932 --> 02:21:51.393
As if they're not doing that now.

02:21:51.433 --> 02:21:54.573
Well, they are, but now they're having even more problems, and he'll tell you why.

02:21:54.633 --> 02:21:57.254
Ebolic or physiological or genetic cause.

02:21:57.854 --> 02:21:58.814
And so there was a sort of

02:22:00.268 --> 02:22:03.611
A sort of a gold rush towards trying to establish genes.

02:22:03.772 --> 02:22:09.558
A sort of a gold rush that was determined actually by the grant calls that determined who got the money.

02:22:09.658 --> 02:22:13.022
So it was not a sort of a gold rush and it wasn't spontaneous.

02:22:15.154 --> 02:22:16.795
cause specific disorders.

02:22:17.436 --> 02:22:36.051
And then in the mid-90s, at the behest of people like John Sulston and the Wellcome Trust, who funded a lot of the research that was to come, the Human Genome Project was set up, probably the grandest endeavor in science, yet certainly the grandest endeavor in medical science and biological sciences.

02:22:36.091 --> 02:22:41.135
Maybe the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has now usurped it, but an incredibly collaborative

02:22:42.296 --> 02:22:57.290
exciting, multi-lab, multi-disciplinary, global project, which basically said, you can have a bunch of money to work out the entire human genome, to work out every single base pair, every single gene in a human, if you start working together.

02:22:57.310 --> 02:23:00.673
And it's a great story about how science progresses.

02:23:00.713 --> 02:23:05.638
It really fundamentally changed the way we do science, because science became much more collaborative.

02:23:06.258 --> 02:23:06.879
at this point.

02:23:07.259 --> 02:23:12.463
And some people argue that that is problematic and that grand endeavors like this are not useful.

02:23:12.664 --> 02:23:14.966
But that is what's happened.

02:23:15.766 --> 02:23:18.329
Instead of looking at individual diseases, we look at the whole genome.

02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:25.295
We try and establish a database in which we can fish through the human genome.

02:23:25.635 --> 02:23:33.542
We have created a structure in which we can throw things that we think we've found, like a general map

02:23:34.537 --> 02:23:37.299
for a national park, but not specific things.

02:23:37.339 --> 02:23:43.522
And then when we find specific things, we can drop them in and we can compare across national parks, across genomes.

02:23:43.862 --> 02:23:45.143
Huh, is that the same as that?

02:23:45.563 --> 02:23:46.464
That's pretty cool.

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:53.888
That's got over there too on that restriction enzyme map of DNA to look for behaviors and traits and characteristics, phenotypes. 2001.

02:23:56.209 --> 02:24:07.116
Nature published the first draft of the public consortium of the human genome to great fanfare, and it was a glorious day back in February 2001.

02:24:07.616 --> 02:24:21.625
I was still doing my PhD at this time, but a year later, I was working at Nature as an editor, and it was great fanfare, and I don't know whether any of you remember, but just before they published it, well, actually six months before they published it,

02:24:22.705 --> 02:24:35.170
Bill Clinton on stage with Craig Venter, who was the head of the private consortium, standing next to, oh, I've forgotten his name, the head of the public consortium, whose name will come to me in a minute.

02:24:35.771 --> 02:24:36.391
Eric Lander.

02:24:36.411 --> 02:24:38.872
No, it wasn't Watson, it was- Eric Lander.

02:24:39.812 --> 02:24:41.093
Watson stood down in 1996.

02:24:41.133 --> 02:24:41.373
Eric Lander.

02:24:44.094 --> 02:24:45.735
Anyway, stood on stage, it was a big announcement.

02:24:45.755 --> 02:24:46.876
It's McKernan's boss.

02:24:46.896 --> 02:24:48.657
The language of God, the language of life.

02:24:49.717 --> 02:24:55.661
Reports at the time suggested that... It could have also been Francis Collins, but they were all there.

02:24:55.741 --> 02:24:58.343
McKernan was there, Lander was there, Collins was there.

02:24:58.383 --> 02:24:59.783
He's talking about exactly that.

02:24:59.903 --> 02:25:08.609
It would be a matter of months before we had established the cause of every genetic disease and possibly cured many of them.

02:25:09.777 --> 02:25:12.980
That was said in 2000, July 2000.

02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:15.082
The publication was in February 2001.

02:25:17.825 --> 02:25:25.792
Actually, the greatest thing, the greatest reveal from the Human Genome Project was effectively that we didn't really understand how genetics worked at all.

02:25:27.494 --> 02:25:27.654
Oh!

02:25:31.238 --> 02:25:34.559
We didn't understand how genetics works at all.

02:25:35.019 --> 02:25:37.780
So you can pick up this where I'm leaving off right here.

02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:50.445
It's a very interesting exercise to see how someone who at the same time seems to be admitting all the shortcomings of the central dogma at the same time will tell you that these are known things.

02:25:50.505 --> 02:25:51.866
These are known things.

02:25:51.926 --> 02:25:57.468
These are known things because evolution because biology or evolution because DNA.

02:25:58.581 --> 02:25:59.982
That's the main message today.

02:26:00.002 --> 02:26:08.067
I hope you will take the time to share this one and also share the Senator Ron Johnson stream that I did the other day.

02:26:08.087 --> 02:26:20.535
I think it's a very important summary with some very important details and some very sort of, you know, I think it's got the right energy for a lot of people that haven't seen me present to see that in particular.

02:26:21.535 --> 02:26:26.176
Because I hope that Senator Ron Johnson will come around and hope that he will contact me.

02:26:26.236 --> 02:26:28.717
I hope that we can start pushing some of these ideas forward.

02:26:29.677 --> 02:26:32.797
Remember very clearly there's a nice list you can talk about.

02:26:32.857 --> 02:26:34.278
You can talk about the backgrounds.

02:26:34.718 --> 02:26:37.598
You can talk about how PCR was an elaborate lie.

02:26:37.618 --> 02:26:40.979
You can talk about the product types that came before the pandemic.

02:26:41.359 --> 02:26:44.560
You can talk about the transfection even in its purest form.

02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:50.801
You can talk about how infectious clone is a nice search term to look for transfection and transformation in PubMed.

02:26:51.321 --> 02:26:57.185
and you can challenge people to argue against the idea that RNA cannot pandemic.

02:26:58.906 --> 02:27:10.254
They are getting away with it because they have managed to scare everybody with the idea that something can go endemic and there's no way to tell the difference between endemicity and a background if you don't have data and we don't have any.

02:27:10.914 --> 02:27:12.976
So that's why they keep sticking to this story.

02:27:13.937 --> 02:27:16.741
I don't know what to say other than I think we're making a lot of progress.

02:27:16.781 --> 02:27:18.022
Thank you very much for sharing.

02:27:18.502 --> 02:27:23.408
Thank you very much for taking the time to go to my website and find a way to support the stream.

02:27:23.428 --> 02:27:26.251
That's GigaOMBiological.com.

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:30.195
Jonathan Gee, a few other people that have come through in the last few days.

02:27:30.896 --> 02:27:32.036
I can't thank you guys enough.

02:27:32.616 --> 02:27:34.077
My family really, really needs it.

02:27:34.117 --> 02:27:40.638
And we are kind of stretching things a little bit on the credit cards to do the live thing in November.

02:27:40.658 --> 02:27:44.359
I want to help out some people that are coming.

02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:49.581
I want to help out Scott Shara with a rental car and things like that.

02:27:49.661 --> 02:27:58.463
So if there's anybody that wants to donate money just to help out a little bit, maybe buy the food, the pizza or whatever we order for the people that are there, or you want to,

02:28:00.492 --> 02:28:03.854
The location is costing about $900 to rent.

02:28:03.934 --> 02:28:13.199
So if you want to take that as a figure and you have some pile of money sitting next to the garbage can, you want to donate a little bit of it to help with that, that would also be great.

02:28:13.959 --> 02:28:16.201
But I don't want anybody to feel any obligation.

02:28:16.641 --> 02:28:23.184
I want you to feel the desire to come on November 3rd and be present for what I think will be a very important gathering.

02:28:23.605 --> 02:28:27.247
And if not enough people come, then I guess Virla is just going to make dinner and we're going to

02:28:27.907 --> 02:28:29.589
have a barbecue and hang out somewhere else.

02:28:29.629 --> 02:28:30.810
So I don't know what's going to happen.

02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:36.835
I just know that it's going to happen because the Brownstone meeting is going to happen the Friday and Saturday before it.

02:28:37.335 --> 02:28:42.740
And because Mark's coming to visit and Joe's coming to visit and Scott's coming to visit and a few other people might come.

02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:46.042
Even Paul Alexander is actually threatening to attend.

02:28:46.543 --> 02:28:47.724
So let's see what happens.

02:28:47.884 --> 02:28:49.345
I hope to see you guys again soon.

02:28:49.425 --> 02:28:50.967
I will most likely be on tomorrow.

02:28:51.007 --> 02:28:51.207
Thanks.
