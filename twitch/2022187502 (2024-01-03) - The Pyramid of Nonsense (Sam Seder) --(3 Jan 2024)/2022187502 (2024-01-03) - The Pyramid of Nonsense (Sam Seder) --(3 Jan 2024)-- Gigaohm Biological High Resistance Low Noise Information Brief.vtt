WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
I am getting everything in order I'm sorry I'm very late sorry I am very very

00:07.880 --> 00:18.740
late I am very very late here we go wait that should have been a fade should

00:18.740 --> 00:23.720
not have been a mix where I was that like that should have been like that okay

00:23.720 --> 00:35.740
this should still be good that should still be good wait so this isn't set up that we're going to do this again

00:35.740 --> 01:05.020
I think we're ready to go I think

01:05.020 --> 01:24.340
we're just gonna do this oh sorry I'm so late here we go

02:05.020 --> 02:12.100
oh look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa oh timeout JC on the bike JC on the bike

02:12.100 --> 02:20.620
it's JC on the bike it's JC on the bike yeah well I'm wise enough to know when a

02:20.620 --> 02:27.100
chomp needs banning and I know just the one look at round it's JC on the bike

02:27.100 --> 02:35.100
who says beta didn't study music in college that's Z-dog MD from YouTube every

02:35.100 --> 02:38.700
once in a while he puts that beta mask on and makes it cool of himself and I

02:38.700 --> 02:44.140
got it his chat once and got him to say my name which is pretty funny

02:45.140 --> 02:52.220
it's not taking long to read up on infectious clones and read up on you

02:52.220 --> 02:58.260
know causes pieces that he makes and guess what when I every single time the

02:58.260 --> 03:05.020
red one there was not the support for his theory there just wasn't there so what

03:05.020 --> 03:09.340
I argued I'm I believe I came up with this independently but I believe Peter

03:09.340 --> 03:15.180
McCullough has mentioned something similar as his Jonathan Cooey

03:39.340 --> 03:58.980
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a

03:58.980 --> 04:10.500
worst case scenario again you know I'm having to go down this pathway because

04:10.500 --> 04:19.820
of kurism's and you know his lack of imagination

04:20.820 --> 04:30.380
where you know I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to so that's the best I

04:30.380 --> 04:37.100
can do with that I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic

04:49.820 --> 05:01.340
scene if if you think about it you know if we're defining vaccine really

05:01.340 --> 05:04.620
liberally and these COVID vaccines are vaccines the flu vaccines vaccine okay

05:04.620 --> 05:08.060
but actually they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines

05:08.060 --> 05:13.140
and you know anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need

05:13.140 --> 05:17.660
shots within a year you know Canada saying nine months is as actually JJ

05:17.660 --> 05:22.060
Cooey's insistence and I think he's right on calling them

05:22.060 --> 05:30.620
transfections rather than the vaccines I'm not sure exactly who he is his name is

05:30.620 --> 05:38.460
JJ Cooey and I believe he's a consultant for CHD and I believe he has a PhD in

05:38.460 --> 05:47.140
some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand it doesn't matter

05:47.140 --> 05:52.020
much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important

05:52.020 --> 05:57.460
ones you know until we have a pandemic it's killing everyone you know and you

05:57.460 --> 06:01.780
know it's not it's you know measles plus and okay I can tolerate what you think

06:01.780 --> 06:06.660
about measles because you know not that many people die from it it's just a big

06:06.660 --> 06:13.260
hassle in the end but know when when we have this new pandemic that is you

06:13.260 --> 06:21.900
know got 75% mortality and it's not it's not it's there'll be no pretense of

06:21.900 --> 06:25.980
being polite in the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it

06:25.980 --> 06:31.260
has to be and this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one

06:31.260 --> 06:34.580
condition or another I mean it was so

06:48.220 --> 06:51.620
that's what I'm talking

06:51.620 --> 06:57.420
the rules protect yourself at all times follow my structure keep it clean touch

06:57.420 --> 06:59.540
blood that you wish let's do it

06:59.540 --> 07:09.100
sweaty palms this is so crazy like this is so crazy I feel so nervous like what in

07:09.100 --> 07:18.780
the world man you schedule for 60 minutes next he's going on French British

07:18.780 --> 07:25.580
Italian Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him

07:25.580 --> 07:29.140
it's embarrassing

08:55.580 --> 09:07.780
evening good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to the show we are here with

09:07.780 --> 09:13.940
another evening a big home biological hopefully we're gonna get a few more

09:13.940 --> 09:20.500
viewers but thank you very much all of you for being here trying to break the

09:20.500 --> 09:25.540
man bezel men trying to shake ourselves from the power of these of these

09:25.540 --> 09:32.620
charlatans I don't know how successful we're gonna be but we sure are trying

09:32.620 --> 09:54.220
I like my pre-auds medium rare too I actually had a wahoo burner the other

09:54.220 --> 10:02.380
night somebody took me out for a burger for Christmas kind of you know and it

10:02.380 --> 10:09.580
was cooked really rare not used to my burger like that but it was really good

10:09.580 --> 10:14.140
generally speaking I'm not down with the red burger though I still not really

10:14.140 --> 10:20.140
down with it wasn't so good that I thought okay this is a gear up not trying to

10:20.140 --> 10:23.340
disrespect Mr. Kennedy here I'm just trying to give you a chance to read

10:23.340 --> 10:29.540
that this is a stream put together by a patch plan physiologists this what I

10:29.540 --> 10:34.340
used to be when I was in a catapagician I'm now a recovering academic and I'm

10:34.340 --> 10:45.900
trying to teach biology biology immunology some big ideas and I'm based on

10:45.900 --> 10:53.340
at Giga Home biological calm and also at Giga Home dot bio spending a lot more

10:53.340 --> 10:57.580
time in Giga Home dot bio the last few days because I'm trying to weed myself

10:57.580 --> 11:02.460
off of Twitter you can find my confession at that link called Scooby you can find

11:02.460 --> 11:06.700
a couple different places to support the stream a schedule there you can also

11:06.700 --> 11:10.860
find a phone number where you can leave a voicemail still nobody really taken me

11:10.860 --> 11:16.620
up on that offer with a nice question or something like that and there is a

11:16.620 --> 11:22.500
contact link there of course this stream is definitely most definitely

11:22.500 --> 11:29.780
supported by these people and actually a few other people of course that serve

11:29.780 --> 11:35.500
the first year or two as some major donors their list is still there is

11:35.500 --> 11:41.900
Greg James Rodney Mullen and a few others that used to have their own

11:41.900 --> 11:46.540
slide and don't anymore so I apologize to those people but I have not forgotten

11:46.540 --> 11:51.500
about you and if you'd like to subscribe again that's all on the website there

11:51.500 --> 11:55.180
and I appreciate it all very very much

11:55.180 --> 12:08.060
well it's not doesn't take a lot you know everybody chips in a little bit we're

12:08.060 --> 12:13.180
gonna get there this whole narrative about an ongoing RNA viral pandemic we

12:13.180 --> 12:18.940
can we can break it and I do believe we're on our way counting one two three four

12:18.940 --> 12:23.660
five and we get people to count those one two three four five and we start to

12:23.660 --> 12:27.700
really think about this faith in a novel virus and really give people the

12:27.700 --> 12:31.300
ponder what it really means I think we're gonna get out of this that's what I

12:31.300 --> 12:36.580
think I think we also talk very straightforward about what intramuscular

12:36.580 --> 12:42.460
injection is it isn't I think that's how we get through this and if you can't

12:42.460 --> 12:47.300
support you know sharing the work is really what needs to happen because if

12:47.300 --> 12:53.020
you if dare I say hundreds of thousands of people we're seeing this work I don't

12:53.020 --> 12:55.900
think we'd have to worry about funding anymore I think there would be enough

12:55.900 --> 13:01.900
people that would step up that I would have to I would have to become a become

13:01.900 --> 13:05.900
a donor to some people or support other people's streams I don't know what I

13:05.900 --> 13:11.380
would do but I'd have to do something because we're breaking this this this

13:11.380 --> 13:16.460
whole faith in a novel virus it's coming undone and the reason why it's

13:16.460 --> 13:21.940
coming undone is because we're starting to understand a few things about faith

13:21.940 --> 13:26.340
that aren't true which is there was no spread in New York City infectious

13:26.340 --> 13:29.740
clones are the only real threat it seems placebo batches were likely

13:29.740 --> 13:32.060
distributed that nobody talks about it anymore

13:32.060 --> 13:37.900
Transfection and healthy mammals is obviously dumb protocols were murdered

13:37.900 --> 13:42.640
gain of function is a mythology this could be to Israel and a spectacular

13:42.640 --> 13:46.780
commitment to lies when all that would be required that's really important

13:46.780 --> 13:49.380
understand

14:03.860 --> 14:14.140
here we are giga home biological January 3rd 2024 I'm coming to you live from

14:14.340 --> 14:22.740
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the back of my garage it is 1051 in the evening which

14:22.740 --> 14:27.540
is not an ideal time for me to stream but I am doing it because I'm starting a

14:27.540 --> 14:32.980
little streak here and I'm not sure how long I'm gonna maintain it but I'm

14:32.980 --> 14:39.900
gonna try and keep going oh that was bad that was the wrong key I would like

14:39.900 --> 14:44.660
that threw me off for a second there I would like to try and maintain some

14:44.660 --> 14:49.980
level of presence every week and I think a stream of days not too much to ask

14:49.980 --> 14:55.700
for although I am still holding a full-time job during the day that does I'm

14:55.700 --> 15:00.700
still not really as productive at as I would like to be and so this is a little

15:00.700 --> 15:04.500
bit tough to pull off and then we did have late basketball practice tonight

15:04.500 --> 15:08.580
basketball practice from 730 to 9 I didn't even have really time to mess

15:08.620 --> 15:13.900
around with changing my start up with the basketball that I usually do oh yeah

15:13.900 --> 15:19.300
that's right we always are going to do a different slide deck here I always have

15:19.300 --> 15:25.220
to change now it's it's it's just becoming easier if I do it this way one

15:25.220 --> 15:32.580
more shout out to my friend Jeff from Earth up in Canada that's his head

15:32.940 --> 15:43.060
there he had a something removed from his his cranial cavity and he appears to

15:43.060 --> 15:48.980
be doing pretty well he has been a longtime supporter of the stream and an

15:48.980 --> 15:57.180
activist up in Canada with him and his wife Kara and so it is a little bit of a

15:57.180 --> 16:02.860
joke that we use that as part of this slide deck it's it's a little bit

16:02.860 --> 16:10.140
laughing at how fantastically lucky he got or you know how healthy he is how

16:10.140 --> 16:14.660
well he heals I don't know it's it's one of these knock-on-wood situations when

16:14.660 --> 16:18.860
you cut someone's skull open and take things out you never know for sure if

16:18.860 --> 16:22.820
everything is settled and everything is healed and it seems to be going very

16:22.860 --> 16:29.420
well and so you know God willing he's gonna be live a long and healthy life

16:29.420 --> 16:36.340
with a with a very odd scar on his head right and that's that's the safest way

16:36.340 --> 16:40.580
to get biology is definitely reading it's discussing it with friends it's

16:40.580 --> 16:45.460
discussing with people who can challenge your own understanding of biology and I

16:45.460 --> 16:50.580
hope that for the vast majority of my viewers I'm able to do that quite

16:50.580 --> 16:56.500
regularly for you because I seek that out myself for those of you who are

16:56.500 --> 17:00.900
joining for the first time we have a shortcut to understanding what happened

17:00.900 --> 17:05.040
with the pandemic and it goes something like a Scooby-Doo episode we were fooled

17:05.040 --> 17:10.660
over the last four years we were fooled over the last four years it's very

17:10.660 --> 17:21.540
important to point out that there was 2020 2021 2022 in 2023 there were four

17:21.540 --> 17:29.620
years of this exercise where we thought we were figuring out what was going on

17:29.620 --> 17:34.940
we thought we were uncovering the cover-up of the lab leak that is what the

17:34.940 --> 17:39.220
Scooby-Doo is and if you've congratulated yourself for figuring out

17:39.220 --> 17:44.460
that this was a lab leak then you were essentially taken by this national

17:44.460 --> 17:50.980
security exercise this global theater I think coordinated between five ice

17:50.980 --> 17:58.460
countries and other countries to feign a pandemic so that changes could be made

17:58.460 --> 18:05.500
in the way that we are governed and so the real trick is to understand that

18:05.500 --> 18:11.220
they have created this illusion of a novel virus and convinced health

18:11.220 --> 18:16.980
professionals and scientists and laypeople around the world that this out of

18:16.980 --> 18:21.660
nowhere this train called a pandemic pulled into the station and all of us

18:21.660 --> 18:26.140
had no choice but to get on it and if we got on this train essentially we

18:26.140 --> 18:30.820
accepted that there have been pandemics in the past and this is just another one

18:30.820 --> 18:35.820
and we've saved each other from from this before with vaccines they accepted

18:35.820 --> 18:39.740
the fact that coronaviruses can do that very specifically you also accepted the

18:39.740 --> 18:44.060
PCR was a way to track it and any symptomatic spread was real he also

18:44.060 --> 18:48.460
accepted that the variants were both evidence of spread and continuing

18:48.460 --> 18:51.900
evolution of a single virus they told you that once you were on the train it

18:51.900 --> 18:55.140
was like the second announcement and then by the time the train had pulled

18:55.140 --> 18:58.540
out of the station they were also telling you that this could be a gain of

18:58.540 --> 19:05.580
function virus because we've been doing that for decades and so this this faith

19:05.580 --> 19:10.180
that this train pulled in and we all got on it it's all gone now our kids are on

19:10.180 --> 19:14.660
it and we've got to get them off of it and the only way to do it is to break

19:14.660 --> 19:21.260
the spell with biology and so the way to break the spell is with the with the

19:21.260 --> 19:27.660
most course and direct language possible the vaccine schedule in

19:27.660 --> 19:33.220
America if only when compared to the vaccine schedule in other western

19:33.220 --> 19:41.740
countries is thereby criminal they have pushed shots ever earlier in the medical

19:41.740 --> 19:49.460
sort of lifespan of a kid in order to make it easier to confound vaccine injury

19:49.540 --> 19:57.220
with genetic predisposition it's just terrible because of course the farther

19:57.220 --> 20:00.980
the kid is long in development the more obvious it's going to be that his

20:00.980 --> 20:05.900
development has been arrested interrupted or somehow maladaptively

20:05.900 --> 20:10.820
affected by the application of a vaccine so advocating for strict liability for

20:10.820 --> 20:17.660
all pharmaceutical products will remove remove this profit structure completely

20:17.660 --> 20:23.820
from from out from under these vaccine makers invest in the use of in the use

20:23.820 --> 20:27.540
of deadly or sorry investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass

20:27.540 --> 20:31.740
casualty events and this is again to see the narrative of the pandemic these are

20:31.740 --> 20:36.740
the ways that we will get back what they have taken from us and basically it's

20:36.740 --> 20:42.140
get rid of the CDC stop being told by this pseudo-military organization what's

20:42.140 --> 20:47.380
happening it's stop surrendering to the who and the UN the Congress has to do

20:47.420 --> 20:51.580
that for us we've talked about how the pandemic was created from very long

20:51.580 --> 20:55.860
time ago we talked about how they've drilled the government we've also talked

20:55.860 --> 21:00.900
about how important it was to see these problems expected to be from

21:00.900 --> 21:05.380
transfection to see them into the narrative very early on in 2020 and

21:05.380 --> 21:10.780
2021 so that they could be confounded when they showed up with the first shots

21:10.780 --> 21:15.660
they could already be said that that was probably just the virus and finally

21:15.660 --> 21:20.220
making this response to national security response makes it possible for

21:20.220 --> 21:25.020
them to sort of put a lid on people it also makes it possible for them to for

21:25.020 --> 21:29.300
example author sub-stacks for other people who makes it possible for them to

21:29.300 --> 21:34.740
have a bunch of of anonymous sub-stacks that are out there putting out the

21:34.740 --> 21:38.740
propaganda that that they want and then you know real people or real people that

21:38.740 --> 21:43.300
are playing this game can then retweet or re-stack or whatever the hell it's

21:43.340 --> 21:49.300
called these these messages and so don't underestimate how much of this is being

21:49.300 --> 21:54.100
orchestrated how many people for example have surrendered their passwords to

21:54.100 --> 21:58.820
their sub-stack just so that the sub-stack can occasionally be hijacked

21:58.820 --> 22:03.660
and posted with you know new things on it or inflammatory things or repost this

22:03.660 --> 22:09.500
or repost that who knows how that's going how much money laundering occurs

22:09.540 --> 22:15.100
through these these kinds of new websites and new social media that showed up

22:15.100 --> 22:18.500
during the course of the pandemic

22:20.180 --> 22:26.220
my guess it's an awful lot and so now in the end number six the toxicity of the

22:26.220 --> 22:29.300
virus and transfection are confounded to allow the pandemic to prove

22:29.300 --> 22:34.780
transfection successful and so that's what really this this in this particular

22:34.780 --> 22:39.980
episode is all about and I really want to get to this video with Sam Cedar and

22:39.980 --> 22:43.580
kind of explain a little bit of what I think is happening here in the broad

22:43.580 --> 22:51.380
scheme of things I'm not gonna draw you a a a multi faceted you know million hub

22:51.380 --> 22:55.420
map of all the players and then move stuff around and show you that I think I

22:55.420 --> 23:03.500
know who's connected to who but I do know that a bunch of people have worked to

23:03.500 --> 23:08.940
limit our spectrum of debate so that the presuppositions of the system are

23:08.940 --> 23:15.420
reinforced by it and the presuppositions of the system are that there was a novel

23:15.420 --> 23:18.940
virus that millions were killed by that millions more were saved from that

23:18.940 --> 23:24.220
likely came from gain of function and therefore could come again you see how

23:24.220 --> 23:28.220
this works am I trying am I getting these pieces to fit together better now

23:28.220 --> 23:32.900
with the gears meshing because that's all we can really do is keep going

23:32.900 --> 23:37.940
through it over and over and so that people understand not only how but why

23:37.940 --> 23:41.620
the pandemic was created there's a million different reasons why this

23:41.620 --> 23:45.980
benefited the controllers of our society and what they can do now on this you

23:45.980 --> 23:50.180
know wave of chaos what they can pivot on and what they are pivoting on and I

23:50.180 --> 23:53.820
think Mike Eden is very correct the digital ID and digital currency is a

23:53.820 --> 23:58.460
definite goal in the near future I also think that Mark Gulak is correct that

23:58.460 --> 24:04.700
getting people to surrender their own medical data their genetic data and

24:04.700 --> 24:11.180
and be basically experimental monkeys in their cage without even really

24:11.180 --> 24:15.860
realizing that they're being treated that way over the next couple generations

24:15.860 --> 24:22.740
as the population is slowly reduced and not by necessarily you know mass

24:22.740 --> 24:27.940
casualties but just reduced by again possibly the lowering of lifespan but

24:27.940 --> 24:37.060
also just the reduction of of of having kids it's the biggest and easiest thing

24:37.060 --> 24:44.220
they can do right if nobody has kids in 70 years everything's gone a few days

24:44.220 --> 24:49.420
ago is at 30% they're only a 30% capacity now I don't know probably the

24:49.420 --> 24:54.740
same but they have a lot of capacity in addition academic laboratories big

24:54.820 --> 25:01.660
research labs there's tremendous capacity out there and some of them want the fast

25:01.660 --> 25:09.220
you know the instant abbot machine which just came about due to the research

25:09.220 --> 25:13.100
during this little short period of time and it's very quick but these labs can

25:13.100 --> 25:16.260
do it very quickly also and they're they're massive they can handle much more

25:16.260 --> 25:22.620
much more than the machine the small machine can handle we continue to procure

25:22.620 --> 25:28.820
millions of swabs test collectors I have something here just have it on just

25:28.820 --> 25:34.260
swab looks innocent not very complicated listen to those cameras go

25:34.260 --> 25:38.580
anybody like to see what it looks like should I open it does everybody open it

25:38.580 --> 25:49.660
up I will I will this is what it's about right is it does it remind you of

25:49.700 --> 25:55.780
something it reminds you of this right once a swab once acute tip it's actually

25:55.780 --> 26:01.220
different it's very sophisticated actually but it's a little bit like so

26:01.220 --> 26:08.860
this is the swamp and we've ordered a lot of them they have a lot of them some of

26:08.860 --> 26:12.420
them some of the states they were shipped to states and the states don't know

26:12.420 --> 26:20.460
where they are and but that's that's it what do we give this to Karen perhaps

26:20.460 --> 26:28.260
you'll take an extra but this is a big deal and we're working on it and we're

26:28.260 --> 26:33.740
working with the companies and I think in the end we're gonna have we're gonna

26:33.740 --> 26:38.820
have a true we're gonna have a tremendous a tremendous success nobody

26:39.180 --> 26:44.980
to us no country is close to us in fact no country is close to us I just wanted

26:44.980 --> 26:48.900
to play that just to remind you of where we were how we transitioned into this

26:48.900 --> 26:56.660
who we transitioned into this with and how easy it was for them to use him as a

26:56.660 --> 27:02.340
tool to manipulate us to make sure that we fell really on one side of this

27:02.340 --> 27:07.460
narrative or the other based on the fact that essentially social media and

27:07.460 --> 27:12.580
mainstream media made it seem like if you didn't accept the full worst case

27:12.580 --> 27:18.100
scenario then you weren't being realistic and you were being like him and he was

27:18.100 --> 27:22.020
brushing off the worst case scenario brushing off the worst case scenario

27:22.020 --> 27:26.620
was done by the guy that at least half the population thought was an idiot so

27:26.620 --> 27:31.460
worst case scenario gets believed

27:32.460 --> 27:37.220
that that's the point I'm trying to make here what I want is high morbidity

27:37.220 --> 27:44.780
this worst case scenario this plan works if there are people in social media and

27:44.780 --> 27:54.340
on mainstream media who are prepared to take advantage of the of the the

27:54.340 --> 27:59.180
dispersion method that Giardano's explaining is I'm using a dispersion

27:59.180 --> 28:03.460
methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid

28:03.460 --> 28:08.140
condition now not all of them need to know that that was what was done but when

28:08.140 --> 28:12.980
that is done we need to have people that are pushing the worst case scenario so

28:12.980 --> 28:18.980
that the idea of questioning whether or not what they see represents a novel

28:18.980 --> 28:26.780
spreading risk-additive pathogen or whether it's something else and it's so

28:26.820 --> 28:30.180
important to understand that you can't just have people that are on the Sunday

28:30.180 --> 28:43.340
evening news that won't work and now they have really basically tricked most of

28:43.340 --> 28:48.220
the dissident organization into the the dissident groups into believing that

28:48.220 --> 28:52.820
there was a novel virus it's still going around and it has all of these crazy

28:52.860 --> 29:03.460
properties because it was enhanced in a laboratory and so it's really I'm

29:03.460 --> 29:07.580
tweaking this little diagram a little bit because I think it's really we're

29:07.580 --> 29:14.740
getting to the stage now where where it's really there are certain home runs

29:14.740 --> 29:20.380
that we can hit the first home run is these little small numbers down here on

29:20.420 --> 29:25.900
the bottom it is it is the fifth year ladies and gentlemen there is no there

29:25.900 --> 29:32.740
is this little number right here one two three four doing a little weather man

29:32.740 --> 29:37.140
thing seriously can you believe that we are in the fifth year and that the same

29:37.140 --> 29:41.740
characters are still fooling around in the background the same dissidents are

29:41.740 --> 29:48.700
still piping up there I invented this I invented that and the lion behind me

29:48.740 --> 29:57.140
makes me you know not lion I mean we are still here there is no other

29:57.140 --> 30:02.060
explanation for it other than we got trapped in a hamster wheel and I'm part

30:02.060 --> 30:06.380
of it there's no question that I'm part of it but I was part of it from the very

30:06.380 --> 30:13.060
very very beginning I got sucked into it from the very very beginning and then

30:13.060 --> 30:18.020
have been trying to break free ever since and I've been brought back into the

30:18.020 --> 30:24.500
fold over these last five years by people coming to my house so while I

30:24.500 --> 30:31.860
would really like to ask for everyone's forgiveness I have an extra excuse they

30:31.860 --> 30:38.260
came to my house I have a whole whiteboard that describes the the relationship

30:38.260 --> 30:44.220
between these people and when they came to Pittsburgh and who they came with

30:44.660 --> 30:50.620
this isn't a funny joke to me because when some of these people came to my

30:50.620 --> 30:54.580
house I still wasn't even aware of what was going on but now in retrospect when

30:54.580 --> 31:00.900
you look backwards and you see oh my gosh all these people came to my house

31:00.900 --> 31:04.500
and if you turn like this and then you see that all those people are those

31:04.500 --> 31:12.940
people it's like oh my gosh I've been targeted by the same criminal syndicate

31:12.980 --> 31:21.660
or two criminal syndicates for almost four years but what criminal syndicate or

31:21.660 --> 31:27.620
syndicates are they I don't know but they are all related to each other it

31:27.620 --> 31:36.340
could just be one but there's no way to explain how we are now here in the

31:36.340 --> 31:42.900
fifth year in 2024 except for a concerted effort in the foreground in the

31:42.900 --> 31:50.460
background to keep us in a hamster wheel with this illusion of consensus that has

31:50.460 --> 31:54.460
now turned into a faith in a novel virus where there's an ongoing RNA viral

31:54.460 --> 32:00.580
pandemic that has killed roughly seven million people worldwide most people

32:00.580 --> 32:04.380
think it's a lab leak now and without strict regulations they think the

32:04.420 --> 32:11.620
future pandemics might be worse like Sam Harris said on December 19th 2019 not a

32:11.620 --> 32:19.460
fluke thank heaven transfection works better than expected and so see this is

32:19.460 --> 32:24.100
where we are I mean really it's important to see that I turn off the sound for a

32:24.100 --> 32:37.420
second it's really important to see that the fifth year and really nobody

32:37.420 --> 32:44.100
nobody started speaking up nobody started speaking up really significantly

32:44.100 --> 32:51.460
until 2022 yes some people were speaking up in the middle of 2021 but they were

32:51.500 --> 32:56.980
very wishy-washy about what they were saying it weren't saying stop hold up

32:56.980 --> 33:00.580
there's not there's nothing dangerous going on here except for what we're

33:00.580 --> 33:07.300
doing to people there oh wait not Remdesivir nobody was saying that the

33:07.300 --> 33:13.020
only guy was saying Remdesivir in 2021 was also saying snake venom and getting

33:13.020 --> 33:19.220
himself discredited even if snake venom is in some of these patents ladies and

33:19.220 --> 33:24.180
gentlemen see it for what it is this recent history that's right before our

33:24.180 --> 33:30.660
eyes is where the truth lies the only danger we have is a compression of the

33:30.660 --> 33:38.900
history of 2020 and 2021 into a meaningless a meaningless smear in our

33:38.900 --> 33:46.580
memories because if we really go back to 2020 and 2021 and look who was trying to

33:46.580 --> 33:52.580
win to break free to fight for our rights to speak up for what should have

33:52.580 --> 33:58.780
been spoken up for and then look which of those is consistently there still we

33:58.780 --> 34:08.020
will find the answer and conversely if we look at 2020 and 2021 and look for the

34:08.020 --> 34:16.260
people who were hyping the worst-case scenario and where they are now we will

34:16.260 --> 34:25.740
find the answer in fact it's very easy once you start making a list and a

34:25.740 --> 34:35.580
brief history of each of these players and where they were in 2020 2021 2022

34:35.580 --> 34:42.380
you will find that their track records reveal everything about why they are

34:42.380 --> 34:49.740
where they are now and this conflated background signal I think a lot of

34:49.740 --> 34:55.140
people are still very angry because this picture that I show has viruses on it

34:55.140 --> 34:59.180
but the conflated background signal doesn't need to be viruses you can think

34:59.180 --> 35:03.380
of those as exosomes you can think of those as RNA and DNA noise in the

35:03.380 --> 35:10.900
background you can draw it that way if you want to why not there's exosomes RNA

35:10.940 --> 35:15.380
DNA in the background how's that for a conflated background signal and you

35:15.380 --> 35:20.820
start doing PCR without valid controls and without nested primers and you can

35:20.820 --> 35:27.700
find anything you want now what a great great opportunity to make a product

35:27.700 --> 35:32.660
right and so why the pandemic was created was to avoid an exponential

35:32.660 --> 35:40.540
increase in Medicare costs to avoid the growing skepticism in vaccines I think

35:40.540 --> 35:48.220
in 2007 or 2008 is when it was really starting to rock but there was a lot of

35:48.220 --> 35:54.340
momentum before the pandemic with regard to skepticism in vaccines to confound

35:54.340 --> 35:58.260
the toxicity of the virus with transfection of course transition youth into

35:58.260 --> 36:04.940
submission that was what the last four years of college was all about the last

36:05.020 --> 36:10.620
four years of college where they also ramped up the the trans gender something

36:10.620 --> 36:15.700
something or other thing way way more than it ever was before the pandemic they

36:15.700 --> 36:21.180
went completely overboard on it and so the same ones that are wearing their

36:21.180 --> 36:24.380
met the only ones that are wearing their masks now are college kids those are

36:24.380 --> 36:29.940
the ones that are really almost completely over the top in on these on

36:30.020 --> 36:37.380
these ideas about about fluid gender and this kind of deal so this is far from

36:37.380 --> 36:43.140
over right because this is a biological it's a salt on on the sacred biology

36:43.140 --> 36:49.500
that is humanity you know just the sacred biology the idea that when a baby comes

36:49.500 --> 36:55.300
out of the womb it's perfect that that that that idea is under assault right

36:56.300 --> 37:00.380
now because the soon as the baby comes out of the womb it could already be all

37:00.380 --> 37:05.860
kinds of problems that need to be fixed by by you know modern futurism medicine

37:05.860 --> 37:13.580
things and so of course it's to edify the the mythology of pandemic viruses it's

37:13.580 --> 37:17.340
probably you know bonuses could be disrupting family formation or

37:17.340 --> 37:20.260
shortening the lifespan of billions of people although I don't know for sure if

37:20.260 --> 37:26.340
that biology in the shot exists it's possible to kill millions of people of

37:26.340 --> 37:31.260
the gain of function virus I don't think that's possible to destroy the cultural

37:31.260 --> 37:35.260
fabric of America and the rest I think if that can happen they will definitely

37:35.260 --> 37:41.500
do that yes and to help create chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization

37:41.500 --> 37:46.100
of how the world is governed I think Michael you deny agree 100% on the idea

37:46.100 --> 37:52.620
that digital currency digital ID and ever more strict controls on movement for

37:52.620 --> 38:00.700
us are definitely coming if we don't reject it wholeheartedly

38:01.100 --> 38:07.020
and so is the curation of ideas for four years it's gotten us here it was the

38:07.020 --> 38:11.100
hamster wheels of conversation the hamster wheels arguing about things that

38:11.100 --> 38:15.380
don't matter like oh my gosh they're they're not letting us use Ivermectin

38:15.380 --> 38:20.420
they're lying about Ivermectin oh and you're not talking about the fact that

38:20.420 --> 38:24.860
there's no evidence of spread then you're not talking about the fact that RNA

38:24.860 --> 38:28.460
can't pandemic then you're not talking about the fact that the only way to

38:28.460 --> 38:38.980
study it a self replicating RNA pathogen is to make a DNA copy of it and so we

38:38.980 --> 38:42.980
have really been misled to believe that this worst-case scenario of a gain of

38:42.980 --> 38:46.740
function laboratory weapon is the real thing that happened we've got

38:46.740 --> 38:51.900
senators saying it we've got representative saying it we've got news

38:51.900 --> 38:59.620
stars saying we've got people on on the internet saying books are being sold

38:59.620 --> 39:11.660
stories are being told and and logged for the ages and I I am one of these

39:11.660 --> 39:15.220
people who didn't wake up fast enough because I was caught up in team worst

39:15.220 --> 39:18.060
case scenario I was caught up in the people that wouldn't tell the truth

39:18.060 --> 39:21.740
because they're direct participants in a national security operation that they

39:21.740 --> 39:26.900
can't tell about I got caught up with all of them that's why I show those

39:26.900 --> 39:30.700
pictures of all those people I got into the car with these people and I haven't

39:30.700 --> 39:36.620
been able to get out until very recently and now I have the feeling that quite a

39:36.620 --> 39:41.500
few of them are pretty pissed that I want to get out of the car that I want

39:41.500 --> 39:46.420
them to stop and let me off the next guy they're not happy with that

39:51.420 --> 40:02.340
and so from March 2020 there were people saying which led us into this

40:02.340 --> 40:06.740
faith of a novel virus and since we've been in this car that the latest data

40:06.740 --> 40:10.220
tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario I'm

40:10.220 --> 40:13.460
afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a

40:13.460 --> 40:17.540
worst and this is gonna keep going on and on and it doesn't matter much at all

40:17.540 --> 40:22.940
what you believe in 2019 until we invent really this idea was already there you

40:22.940 --> 40:27.460
know until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone you know and you know

40:27.460 --> 40:31.820
it's not it's you know measles plus and okay I can tolerate what you think about

40:31.820 --> 40:36.540
measles because you know not that many people die from it it's just a big

40:36.540 --> 40:43.220
hassle in the end but no one when we have this new pandemic that is you know

40:43.220 --> 40:52.740
got 75% mortality and it's not it's there'll be no pretense of being polite in

40:52.740 --> 40:57.300
the face of these beliefs it'll be a moral emergency because it has to be and

40:57.300 --> 41:01.620
this is just sheer contingency as to whether we're in one condition or

41:01.620 --> 41:08.500
another I mean so he said that about one month before the pandemic was

41:08.500 --> 41:18.620
declared by the who that's not an accident he said that one month before

41:18.620 --> 41:28.380
this fiasco started use the word pandemic said 75% mortality we are

41:28.380 --> 41:37.100
talking very specifically about worst case scenario and it is so vital to

41:37.100 --> 41:41.420
understand that that's really what this is all about worst case scenario

41:41.420 --> 41:47.620
justifies the vaccine schedule because the worst case scenario if everybody

41:47.620 --> 41:52.340
doesn't vaccinate is a world full of measles and kids dying in the hospital

41:52.340 --> 42:01.180
right worst case scenario if you don't take that take it seriously when the

42:01.180 --> 42:06.820
when the virus is killing 75% of the people we're gonna have to do it for you

42:06.820 --> 42:11.020
that's what Sam Harris is trying we don't have tolerate we can't tolerate

42:11.020 --> 42:22.060
those ideas anymore you see this wasn't about anything other than making sure

42:22.060 --> 42:29.620
that the biosecurity state had these ideas embedded in the next generation even

42:29.620 --> 42:34.060
if there's some grumpy old people like me that don't ever believe in it it doesn't

42:34.060 --> 42:43.460
really matter to them they know that they're gonna time this just right and now

42:43.460 --> 42:51.580
with the chaos coming with this election coming it's very hard to see what outcome

42:51.580 --> 43:00.340
is gonna benefit us if they're if any it's very very interesting times ladies

43:00.340 --> 43:04.940
and gentlemen very interesting times on this road and I want to take you on a

43:04.940 --> 43:12.100
little journey on the internet now if you would permit me I am going to go to

43:12.100 --> 43:17.860
YouTube and then I'm gonna swing this over here and I don't know what this is

43:17.940 --> 43:22.980
gonna reveal over my viewing habits by putting this up here and then I'm gonna

43:22.980 --> 43:26.980
look at my history because I do think it's actually just gonna be easier that

43:26.980 --> 43:35.780
way I do occasionally here we go perfect then so this guy I'm gonna shrink my

43:35.780 --> 43:41.580
brain here a little bit this guy and this girl on the majority report with Sam

43:41.580 --> 43:47.820
Cedar like to talk about stuff they like to talk about vigious and they

43:47.820 --> 43:53.660
like to talk about opinions and they they have very very sharp ideas and if

43:53.660 --> 43:57.700
they decide for example that Brett Weinstein's an idiot I mean they will

43:57.700 --> 44:02.860
tear him up and laugh at him and ridicule him there's no middle ground

44:02.860 --> 44:07.660
with these people they pick people that they can just you know tee up and and

44:07.660 --> 44:14.300
field goal kick so in this video which is really interesting they are looking

44:14.300 --> 44:21.700
at this clip that we've all seen where recently Bill Maher had Seck McFarland

44:21.700 --> 44:25.340
Seck McFarland is the guy from Family Guy who does all those voices Bill Maher

44:25.340 --> 44:29.700
is that annoying dude from HBO and other things um who says he hates kids all

44:29.700 --> 44:35.980
this other stuff all these messages are perfect right and what I wanted to just

44:36.020 --> 44:45.860
point out and and this is a kind of a an an anti-digital diagram kind of thing

44:45.860 --> 44:50.580
here let me see if I can do oh that wasn't what I wanted to do this is what I

44:50.580 --> 44:57.820
want to do yes so yeah I have seen other diagrams on the internet trying to

44:57.820 --> 45:01.940
purport to show how people are connected but I just want to say that it's

45:01.940 --> 45:09.300
something like this imagine that there's like some guy named Peter and he's got

45:09.300 --> 45:15.620
a lot of money and he's got these people who he really likes and he's got a friend

45:15.620 --> 45:27.260
named named Elon and and they've got some people that they they kind of used to

45:27.340 --> 45:33.020
massage opinion on the internet and one of them might be named Joel and another

45:33.020 --> 45:40.100
one might be Eric and another one might be Brett and then underneath them are a

45:40.100 --> 45:53.740
bunch of other dudes like Steve and Alec and Lex and you know the names go on

45:53.820 --> 46:00.100
and on and some of them share the same sponsors for example maybe you know

46:00.100 --> 46:06.980
there's some sponsors that they share and they also might share some I don't

46:06.980 --> 46:13.060
know social media platform or or whatever and so my point is is that then

46:13.060 --> 46:18.700
they also these guys have each other on their podcasts you know and they all

46:18.700 --> 46:23.220
visit each other and they program and they they do different visits and they

46:23.220 --> 46:27.260
give each other watches and stuff and then it's all really cool little in group

46:27.260 --> 46:31.180
where they tell each other how cool they are and they work out together and look

46:31.180 --> 46:38.940
at each other's muscles so then underneath this are some lesser fish but

46:38.940 --> 46:42.740
they're not really lesser fish because some of them have many more followers

46:42.740 --> 46:47.180
than these mid-level guys who are actually just really cool you know like

46:47.180 --> 46:52.820
athletes and bowl hunters and this kind of crap but down here there are people

46:52.820 --> 47:00.500
like what I love are like Tim Poole and Sam Cedar Sam Cedar is this guy who

47:00.500 --> 47:06.260
were we're looking at right here this dude right here and so underneath here

47:06.260 --> 47:10.340
are these people that these guys have like millions of followers okay Tim Poole

47:10.340 --> 47:15.500
and Sam Cedar when they go live 40,000 people watch them live until they're

47:15.500 --> 47:20.140
done and then lots of people watch their clips they have an amazing audience but

47:20.140 --> 47:25.500
most importantly they are entirely antagonistic they hate each other okay

47:25.500 --> 47:31.740
so this girl for example has been on Tim Poole's show like once and then they

47:31.740 --> 47:38.340
use those clips for like four months and you know it's very much left and

47:38.340 --> 47:41.580
right and oh my gosh they don't understand anything and oh my gosh they

47:41.580 --> 47:46.780
don't understand anything it's really like a Fox News MSMBC but now for medium

47:46.820 --> 47:52.140
young people I don't know if it's college age or just out of high school or or

47:52.140 --> 47:57.460
adults that are like 25 or 30 I don't really know who watches them but they

47:57.460 --> 48:04.380
have a lot of yours so very typically Brett Weinstein for oh sorry I didn't mean

48:04.380 --> 48:09.180
to say that name Brett for example could be on Tim's show I shouldn't really put

48:09.180 --> 48:12.860
these names here but Tim Poole and Sam Cedar are so big it's okay for me to say

48:12.860 --> 48:18.140
that so Brett might be on Tim Poole's show and say something that's pseudo

48:18.140 --> 48:22.940
controversial and then Sam Cedar will take that clip and make a make a really

48:22.940 --> 48:28.380
nice super well-watched video where he talks about how Brett and Tim Poole

48:28.380 --> 48:34.700
got something wrong so basically what you're gonna see here in this video is

48:35.180 --> 48:45.420
up here also are people like like Mar and all the other intellectual dark web

48:45.420 --> 48:53.660
people right and what we have here also is like somewhere in between the super

48:53.660 --> 49:01.140
rich guys and these social media clowners are also Hollywood people right and so

49:01.140 --> 49:07.500
here is where actually we have this Seth guy and so a Hollywood dude is talking

49:07.500 --> 49:12.580
to this guy who's kind of making his living on on social media now and he's

49:12.580 --> 49:16.300
a little bit higher in that order than these guys are because he used to be on

49:16.300 --> 49:22.460
HBO whatever and so these two guys are are saying something silly that then this

49:22.460 --> 49:30.180
dude down here is gonna make a video about and so what's really interesting is

49:30.180 --> 49:37.660
to hear how the TV narrative is translated through Sam Cedar into this

49:37.660 --> 49:44.140
you know lambasting of Bill Maher and that's what's so interesting about this

49:44.140 --> 49:50.780
is that for from our perspective Bill Maher gets some things right but this

49:50.780 --> 49:56.780
Seth guy sounds like he just watches TV and takes notes but from Sam's

49:56.940 --> 50:03.300
perspective that guy smart and he's been paying attention he's a skilled TV

50:03.300 --> 50:08.540
watcher and this dude is a conspiracy theorist so let's I think it's really

50:08.540 --> 50:15.580
an instructive video all the other thing I wanted to recall and I wonder if I can

50:15.580 --> 50:18.540
just make my head big here and then just ask you guys this question in the

50:18.540 --> 50:27.260
chat do you remember when we watched here at Funded Bush when he was on

50:27.260 --> 50:37.260
Steve Kersh's podcast the word mitigate mitigated mitigating infection infection

50:37.260 --> 50:44.420
mitigating antibodies he said infection mitigating so many times that I actually

50:44.420 --> 50:48.900
wrote it down and was like what the hell is he talking about so let me see if I

50:48.900 --> 50:56.100
can find that really really quick where was the notes about that guy here

50:56.100 --> 51:02.060
low affinity area infection mitigating that's where I got it infection see it

51:02.060 --> 51:07.940
infection mitigating effect so I want you to remember this this was from

51:07.940 --> 51:13.140
Herit fund in Walsh not even a week ago and the video that I'm gonna show you

51:13.140 --> 51:18.580
right now is from about a day ago okay just keep this in mind I'm trying to

51:18.580 --> 51:22.900
crack the code here trying to crack the code I'm trying to save us from this

51:22.900 --> 51:31.580
this web of deception it's a web of deception okay here we go you're gonna go

51:31.580 --> 51:35.660
here I'm gonna put my head in the middle and I got to get my head out of the way

51:35.660 --> 51:40.220
and then I got to start it over because this is just brilliant Bill Mark continues

51:40.220 --> 51:46.900
to descend to descend into madness I mean and it's been slow I think I already

51:46.900 --> 51:53.140
have it on speed I mean I should I should say he's been on it for a long time

51:53.140 --> 52:00.700
and but here is a Bill Maher with his you know non anti-vax anti-vaxism he's

52:00.700 --> 52:04.580
on with Seth MacFarlane the guy from Family Guy who supported Bernie so you

52:04.580 --> 52:08.260
know seems like he has decent politics you don't need to have decent politics

52:08.260 --> 52:13.420
to understand the basic functioning of vaccinations and squares that aren't

52:13.420 --> 52:19.060
socialists get it and let's be clear I mean it's very very hard to really get

52:19.060 --> 52:22.580
a sense of just what's going on with COVID at this point because the CDC is

52:22.580 --> 52:26.020
not even tracking this stuff in any type of like daily manner anymore and they

52:26.020 --> 52:30.980
haven't for over a year well over a year now but there's a spike there's a big

52:30.980 --> 52:39.900
spike and we still lose about 200 people a day to COVID it may be a little bit

52:39.900 --> 52:45.060
higher than that right now and people forget that the biggest fear at the

52:45.060 --> 52:50.460
beginning of this was that our hospital systems would be overwhelmed and they

52:50.460 --> 52:53.740
certainly were right on the brink particularly like in New York for a

52:53.740 --> 53:00.140
couple weeks you know in March of 2020 where you had to have refrigerated 18

53:00.140 --> 53:06.660
wheelers to stab the bodies there and we seem to have basically settled into

53:06.660 --> 53:13.700
where COVID is gonna be endemic and we put up with 80 flu deaths a day and now

53:13.700 --> 53:22.300
we'll put up with about 200 COVID deaths per day we have also this sort of third

53:22.300 --> 53:29.540
element now RSV respiratory virus it's unclear you know what COVID is done to

53:29.540 --> 53:36.060
our immune systems that we have this sort of like third now threat but we

53:36.060 --> 53:42.100
have yet to sort of step up and accept that these things are real like even the

53:42.100 --> 53:47.460
flu we accept is more real than COVID were across the population well that's

53:47.460 --> 53:50.900
because that's pretty extraordinary right he wants you to believe that the

53:50.900 --> 53:54.420
hospitals were overwhelmed that COVID will become endemic like we weren't

53:54.420 --> 53:59.540
already talking about the possibility that it was already endemic which is

53:59.540 --> 54:04.900
what we said at Giga on biological already when almicron came out we said

54:04.900 --> 54:08.580
that it doesn't have to be a brand-new laboratory leaked virus to have that

54:08.580 --> 54:12.860
many variants it just or that many differences from the previous one it

54:12.860 --> 54:16.580
just has to be all part of the same background

54:16.580 --> 54:23.340
flu and RSV now come up as things that are we're not sure what COVID did to our

54:23.340 --> 54:28.380
immune system I mean think about how extraordinary it is the the language

54:28.380 --> 54:34.860
that he's choosing he could be extremely programmed he could be a very skilled

54:34.860 --> 54:41.100
TV watcher or he could have marching orders like he's getting paid to say

54:41.100 --> 54:45.660
these things he could not know we could just think he's doing what he has to do

54:45.660 --> 54:49.940
because it's a national security priority he does believe that something was

54:49.940 --> 54:56.180
released and became endemic he thinks that that's possible you can't blame him

54:56.180 --> 55:03.140
really I mean how can you blame him when there are books out there about it how

55:03.140 --> 55:07.540
can you blame him when there are people on TV talking about it and and the YouTube

55:07.540 --> 55:13.780
videos that don't get canceled are talking about it how could you blame him

55:14.500 --> 55:18.620
flu shot yeah Bill Maher has heard of flu had heard of the flu growing up but

55:18.620 --> 55:21.740
COVID was a new thing well let's be careful Bill Maher also said flu shots were

55:21.740 --> 55:26.460
bullshit in 2015 and he said it on this too oh okay he's a long he's a OG anti

55:26.460 --> 55:34.540
and listen flu shot OG anti-vax he says flu shots don't work oh okay oh wow so

55:34.540 --> 55:39.980
these people are convinced that even flu shots have value let's listen we have

55:39.980 --> 55:44.540
known they vary in efficacy from year to year based upon what the flu strand is

55:44.700 --> 55:48.620
we are in that stage with COVID where we don't know how to predict

55:48.620 --> 55:53.260
which strand of COVID is going to exist because it continues to mutate which strand

55:53.260 --> 56:02.460
and we do know that even if the strand that we of the flu that we vaccinate for isn't the one

56:02.460 --> 56:07.420
that is predicted or is different enough so that it can't inhibit your ability to get it

56:07.420 --> 56:10.460
or it inhibits your ability to get it but it doesn't fully prevent it and people

56:10.540 --> 56:18.380
understand that difference right I can you know reduce the chances of me getting into a car accident

56:18.380 --> 56:23.980
on my bicycle but not eliminate it I can reduce it by maybe dropping my speed and by

56:24.540 --> 56:30.300
following the the traffic laws but I can't get rid of the danger of it I can also mitigate

56:30.300 --> 56:36.460
the implications of getting into that accent by wearing a helmet and if I want to wear you know

56:36.460 --> 56:39.820
I don't know elbow pads and knee pads that could also

56:42.220 --> 56:47.740
that if I want to wear patients of getting into that accent by I can also mitigate

56:47.740 --> 56:53.420
the implications of getting into that accent by wearing a helmet that's one and if I want to wear

56:53.420 --> 56:59.820
you know I don't know elbow pads and knee pads that could also mitigate two the nature of the

56:59.820 --> 57:06.220
injury I start the vaccinations work the same way they always have and I just say so vaccinations

57:06.220 --> 57:15.180
now mitigate disease and they've always worked that way but I assure you the truth is can be found

57:15.180 --> 57:24.140
in videos from 2020 where they tell you that we have defeated disease in the past with vaccination

57:24.140 --> 57:27.660
here he's saying vaccination has always worked to mitigate things

57:29.660 --> 57:33.180
let's see if he uses the word mitigate anymore it's basic things because

57:33.980 --> 57:39.500
Bill Maher isn't just an idiot and what's also amazing in this he looks like he's shrinking into

57:39.500 --> 57:45.340
his seat in some weird things this guy's literally shrinking as he talks I mean I just I have a few

57:45.340 --> 57:50.940
just quick points just to observe it just seems like every club random episode is just an opportunity

57:50.940 --> 57:59.100
for Bill Maher to get as messed up as possible drinking so much there are seven bottles of alcohol

57:59.660 --> 58:04.300
on the thing there's not it doesn't need to be this way and every guest seems more uncomfortable

58:04.300 --> 58:07.980
than the last and more sober than the other than the others then the others gaffigan when I'm

58:07.980 --> 58:12.620
remembering gaffigan is like not I'm not about this he's a touch I don't know I saw the Richard

58:12.620 --> 58:18.620
Dreyfuss one and it looked like Dreyfuss one that was very very except I also like it's always so

58:18.620 --> 58:23.580
yeah guys you go into it knowing that and that's by the way that's why they consult with each other

58:23.580 --> 58:27.580
that's why they call their colleagues there's a lot of guesswork but it's educated guesswork yes

58:27.580 --> 58:31.020
if you're not a doctor your guess is maybe not going to be as educated as as someone who is

58:31.020 --> 58:35.740
but then why are doctors wrong about so much yes and but very often people who aren't doctors

58:35.740 --> 58:39.740
have been writer about things keep positive like it like for some doctors are wrong about

58:39.740 --> 58:43.580
things medical history is like medical science provisional usually the people determined isn't

58:43.580 --> 58:46.700
just a normal guy being like hey I think you're doing that like heart surgery wrong it's other

58:46.700 --> 58:50.380
doctors being like oh I think our methods can stand to improve material right he's just talking

58:50.380 --> 58:53.740
out of his arms here honestly I mean just like completely I love how the chair just seems to

58:53.740 --> 58:57.100
be growing around him now go ahead and but very often people who aren't doctors have been

58:57.180 --> 59:01.420
writer about things what like like what would be an example of that I would think this country

59:01.420 --> 59:06.860
did not allow for um natural immunity to be considered when I know this is subject

59:06.860 --> 59:10.620
due to your thoughts in one second like you know like first of all this game wrangle is just like

59:10.620 --> 59:15.340
I don't know like who in the world like what what is this most of me communicating I know this is

59:15.340 --> 59:19.980
my own little pet peeve you can imagine like you are at some sort of this wall them smoke here

59:19.980 --> 59:26.460
big and that is even with like the existence of vaccinations and progression of like some semblance

59:26.460 --> 59:32.060
of how to treat this imagine if it was just like let's let it burn just let it burn through

59:32.060 --> 59:39.340
everyone we'll be talking can you imagine that he's talking about language that was used in 2020

59:39.340 --> 59:46.060
if he's just inventing it now for these people his viewers this is the depth of the enchantment

59:49.260 --> 59:53.820
that's what you need to understand the depth of the enchantment is such that this guy has

59:53.900 --> 01:00:00.700
millions of views millions of followers in social media not just on youtube

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.420
paid subscribers that buy his pot seeds

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:17.900
it's an extraordinary network of personalities of operators on the internet

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:24.860
who are keeping our family and our friends and our neighbors trapped in this scooby-doo

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.380
convinced that it's already done sealed and delivered

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:38.620
and that people that don't understand how powerful vaccine technology is don't understand how

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:45.340
complicated this stuff is and how you need to surrender to the technocracy that saved you from

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.820
this being much much worse you're an idiot

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:58.460
we are in grave danger ladies and gentlemen because the young people are watching this and

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:06.380
thinking that this is logic and reason and all they need to do is bathe in it

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:16.780
and these people are at best skilled tv watchers at best they are single channel

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:24.940
skilled tv watchers at worst they are skilled facebook users they are skilled twitter users

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.980
they are skilled instagram users they are skilled reddit readers

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:35.820
three four five times that maybe go ahead

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.740
yes you had the disease you still had to get a vaccine that's powerful stupid they don't do that

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:46.460
in europe they do that here there's mandatory vaccination and crazy sure looks like they're having a

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:50.220
lively debate we didn't see that we didn't seem to believe in that was debunking army that was

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.940
that's not the book don't you know people have had covid four or five times i do that's not

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.540
natural unity there's no immunity there you've had covid five times probably because you had too

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.700
there's no natural immunity because you know people who have had covid four or five times

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:07.580
are we just talking about positive testing see that's the frustrating part

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:15.980
is that the people who really believe in vaccines don't conceive of the possibility that taking

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:22.060
the vaccine could be responsible for their getting the virus because as they understand

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.820
the way the vaccine works it doesn't make a virus it just makes a spike protein

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:34.860
and so i make antibodies there's no way it can make me more likely to get

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:42.620
a positive test to get sick from something because they think that all of these things are high

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:50.300
fidelity real markers of reality they take a lateral flow test that data is useful

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:56.060
if they take a a PCR test that data is useful to them

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.020
and so this is the bamboozlement this using their equipment

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:11.980
to measure for their ghosts and thinking that you're a ghostbuster is ridiculous

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.740
and that's what we've been led to believe that we're doing it all over the world and these people

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.940
are leaving us there over the cliff

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:31.340
because natural immunity does exist but that the vaccination reverses natural immunity is what he

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:36.300
said it doesn't let natural immunity cook yeah it's just the dumbest i mean this is like grade

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.980
school stuff except for a grade school student would realize like i'm really not in a position

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.020
don't mind about this that's what's funny is they all think they're right about this stuff and it's

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:48.300
actually like extremely stupid stupid now it's what's really funny is that they all think they're

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:55.420
right about this but it's extremely deadly it's extremely dangerous it's extremely

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.900
clearly negligent

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.700
and that's how spectacular this bamboozlement has been these people actually believe

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:13.100
i don't think either sam or his sidekick is aware of how entranced they are

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:19.260
and only a vaccine injury to themselves would break them out of this

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:27.260
i doubt it if even one of them if they're close enough friends that if she got hurt for example

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.820
that he would change his tune i doubt it

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:38.460
it's very dark times ladies and gentlemen and he used the word mitigate three times in a row

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:45.340
but probably because you had too many vaccines i didn't have coven to the vaccine gave you

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:49.180
coven sorry well that's certainly him all i didn't have coven because he like works on his own

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.700
compound yes it's never near what's normal people he's never on public transportation he's never

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.820
like yeah you're you get limousine so now they say that he didn't get coven because he's always on a

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:05.180
limousine and he's always on his personal lockdowns work see what they've just enforced there see how

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:12.780
amazing this is if they are unwitting participants in this it is spectacular chances are they're not

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:18.620
they chances are they know that they are delivering a message they've been staying on it for a very

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.700
long time they're totally fine with it because they believe it but they know that occasionally

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:31.580
they exaggerate occasionally their certainty is overextended occasionally you know the rarity of

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.220
what they say is rare is not as rare you know but they got to do it it's okay i get it

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.940
yes wealthy people who have the ability everything delivered to them um and don't have to have any

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:48.540
human contact if they don't want to yes they're less likely to be a coven wtf coven my great grandpa

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.260
died after his second coven infection go ahead i didn't have coven to the vaccine gave you coven

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.100
uh well that's certainly not the unscientific about the fact of the vaccine which does weaken

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.300
you in order to strengthen you says to all vaccines exactly yeah but while you're in a

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:07.900
weekend state of yes listen to seph how how cocky he is it would be so amazing to get seph

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.020
on the other side of a microphone and be able to talk to him for 20 minutes about what he knows

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:19.180
about this stuff because in front of bill mar he's very confident that bill mar is an idiot and

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.340
doesn't know what he's talking about and he's getting drunk and he's smoking a crappy cigar

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:30.940
so i'll drink my canadian dry and and wipe the floor with him based on what i know from watching

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:36.860
tv that's why so many people like me got it did not have it while the thing was raging and i

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:40.540
was taking zero precautions because i was never that afraid of it but that's anecdotally i had

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:44.780
everybody all there is anecdotal that yeah and i've never had coven i got a flu shot was here i

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.940
was like that like bill mar revelation they're like uh when it was raging and i took zero precautions

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:51.500
how was how psychotic he doesn't understand how psychotic that is but we're not just saying

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.620
like oh what a daredevil you are you could have caught it been asymptomatic and spread it to

01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:00.460
a whole bunch of people you also it's also wow there was you could have you could have caught it

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:05.100
been asymptomatic and spread it to a bunch of people you moron

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:16.700
they still believe that this is a ongoing phenomenon where an RNA molecule is sneaking around from

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.820
lung to lung and reproducing with high enough fidelity so that we can track the

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.340
phylogenetic development of it and we are at jn1

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:34.380
and haired fund and ball show used to work for seppy and govy and and bill and malinda

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:38.380
gates foundation is now telling us that this is a worst case scenario happening

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.860
other people are telling us it's a worst case scenario where a pre-on extinction event is going

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:52.940
to happen other people are telling us that this is just absurd and this is a new technology

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:58.380
that's just on the brink of changing everything about us as we call humans so who's right

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:04.060
in precautions around you your show wasn't shooting for instance like you didn't have to

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:10.460
go to work like you're just hanging out with literally the most elite humans you know in the

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:15.500
country um who are less exposed to these things running rampant and incidentally also by the

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.260
time it gets owed to california uh i mean uh from yeah i mean it's just and set this like another

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.100
example of somebody who has a ton of money who he says i never got it most people didn't have that

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.220
luxury like frontline workers and minimum wage workers and people that were working at restaurants

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.260
like they didn't have that the people that were working as cashiers at all the grocery stores didn't

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:38.460
die in a higher proportion than anybody else the people that working at restaurants couldn't open

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:44.940
so i don't know what she's talking about but the people that worked as cashiers at all of these

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:52.060
stores big shop stores and and and grocery stores that got to stay open i don't really recall

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:58.220
a surge in cashiers going to the hospital even though they were pretty freaking exposed

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:07.180
but they just edit this part of their actual lived experience completely out of their memory

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:14.860
apparently because a symbol calculation in this six-year-old's head would say that wow you're

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.420
working at a grocery store some pretty dangerous shit if this is a real pandemic that's going to

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:30.780
kill a billion people ongoing psychological operation it's an ongoing scooby-doo they are

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:38.220
still sure that they figured it out and it's not a wild virus for these people it's just a

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:42.220
leak or something you know opportunity but these two rich guys are like on the others i mean again

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.420
says being right here but he's a case of case an example or case study what we're talking about

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.380
yeah just think yeah anecdotal but uh the people that i know that went until like maybe the last

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:52.700
like uh it's followed without getting covid were people who were best that yeah and i have never

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.140
had covid i get a flu shot once a year i don't have a flu in 20 years right well i have anything i

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:59.180
don't get a flu shot okay so this is all anecdotal but but right but you know the difference between

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.340
anecdotal and then statistical i do well and statistically you still have a 90 percent better

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.100
chance of not being hospitalized not dying if you're vaccinated okay well but that's assuming all

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.980
people are alike and that is one of the giant fallacies in your way of thinking we are not all

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:14.300
alike yes i would recommend and have recommended the covid vaccine for the high-risk people like if

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.100
you're 90 see and that's where i made the mistake for the first year and a half saying that while

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:25.740
certain people it's probably a great idea i actually said that in a video like the idiot that i was

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:32.380
but i said it more out of fear more out of uncertainty more out of doubt

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.580
because of all these people preaching worst case scenario behind me in the background

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.460
urging me on with emails and text messages signal groups

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:55.020
i was played for four years ladies and gentlemen i didn't change my website to have that scooby-doo

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:00.620
link until only a month ago and before that it still really hadn't clicked

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.220
and so we've got to start making a click for other people we've got to start making

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.620
people admit that it hasn't clicked for them yet

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:20.460
because bill marznot cutting it here sam uh seth mcfarland is totally trapped here

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:25.260
and he's unable to rescue him because he's actually trapped in it too

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.140
he still believes in a novel virus he still believes that a million people died he still believes

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.060
that millions more were saved he still believes is probably a lab leak and he still believes he could

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:41.340
come again fat get it absolutely you need it some people don't but you had joke of it

01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:46.540
positive no listen here's the point we don't know who those people are at any given time

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.140
yes it is true that you have a a greater chance of dying from covid if you're 90

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.220
you have a greater chance of dying if you are uh as he says fat now 40 percent of it

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:58.700
the thing about it is is that all the data that we have shows that actually the old people are

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:04.860
very vulnerable to having a heart attack stroke or clotting problem from the shot

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:14.380
and they're still talking about the novel virus you know the one with the fear and cleavage

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.700
site that was the most transmissible virus in the history of mankind because it was modified

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:27.260
in a laboratory that one the one that everybody was so damn sure about for 2020 and 2021

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:35.340
the one that Brett Weinstein seeded the drastic narrative with Yuri Dagan on his own podcast

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.500
that one

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.820
we need to break free ladies and gentlemen

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.780
i've only been free really free for a few months

01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:01.100
and i've been clawing my way out of this cave clawing my way out now we need to go back in

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.340
and bring some more people out

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:13.260
adults our obese 31 percent of us adults are overweight um the the idea that like you're

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.700
gonna pick and choose who's gonna do this we don't do that with any any other vaccinations

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.100
incidentally um the the there are definitely children who get the hepatitis vaccine

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:29.580
who are more susceptible to hepatitis because of income levels let's say or because of regions

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:36.380
where they live then others but this is public health and the whole point of public health is

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.140
what brings about the greatest health benefits to the most amount of people which policy

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.940
you know that's the thing he doesn't understand this is about public health and there is always

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.900
like in every single medical procedure a risk that is associated with it and when it comes to

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.260
public health you are always saying we are not instituting this because we think that we can

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.660
save 100 percent of the people we are instituting this measure because we can believe that we are

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:06.940
going to be saving more people's lives and health than not instituting this policy that's so apparently

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:12.300
he doesn't really understand the full implications of such a policy and the amount of power that's

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:17.500
associated with it never mind the idea that if this is going to randomly kill one out of every

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:24.620
800 people or randomly handicap one out of every 400 people then really justifying the use of

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:32.380
such a product is pretty difficult but we are we are listening to what is for all practical

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:40.060
purposes junior high level bioethics discussion where now it's time for a teacher to say well

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.140
but you haven't really thought that through Sam maybe you should think again about what you read

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:53.180
last night in the chapter I assigned or maybe this uh you know super super student over here

01:14:53.260 --> 01:15:02.380
and teachers pet will correct but I doubt it and so we are really dealing with a crisis right now

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:12.380
because people are being led by people who don't have any firm understanding of the basic principles

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:17.500
of bioethics talking about bioethics and pretending as though they're making points

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:25.180
and also talking about virology biology and immunology as if they know because they've been watching TV

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:33.660
and the TV has been telling them the truth and ridiculing people who don't conform to that TV

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:39.020
narrative that don't understand what the TV's been trying to teach ladies and gentlemen

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.340
we are at a crucial time point right now we're the only way we're going to get through this

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:51.500
every single person that was caught up in the worst case scenario narrative apologizes for it

01:15:55.100 --> 01:16:01.260
because otherwise we're not acknowledging what actually happened which was a lemmings type event

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:09.020
that was orchestrated by people who were put there with the notion that they must push

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:14.620
the worst case scenario and avoid questioning the novel virus

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.660
it's a very big deal ladies and gentlemen because the dam is breaking but we need to break it in

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.700
our way because they were always planning to break the dam they were planning to use that dam break

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:38.380
for their own purposes right and so we if we're going to use this dam break we need to be very

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:45.100
clever about it and I think we can be clever about it

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:53.340
but if we're going to use this dam break to our advantage sorry I should have switched over here

01:16:53.340 --> 01:17:00.780
if we are going to use this dam break to our advantage we need to continue to keep this steady

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:07.020
pressure on the players that are involved continue to keep the skepticism up so that people understand

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:11.340
that there are lots of people that are going to be letting off smoke bombs and letting off all

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:17.740
kinds of other you know shiny objects that we can't we can't afford to pay attention to these

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:24.300
non-dramas anymore and these fake these fake rivalries once you see that all these people were

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:30.460
connected for four years once you see that they have these you know backgrounds that connect them

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:38.860
all back to the very beginning I mean it's really pretty fascinating if you think how many

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:47.580
people are connected through some of these characters some of these horse traders some of these

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:54.940
you know foot journalists on foot

01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:02.060
it's just really extraordinary but I do think that we are really breaking them

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:08.300
and and breaking the narrative and so we can still stay with some pretty simple messages

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:13.820
I still think we can say that we should stop all transfections in humans

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:21.420
I do think that that's still one way that we can be clear with our family and friends about what

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:28.860
we mean I do think another way to do it is to say you know you're a member of the control group

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:35.180
and being a member of the control group still means something and in this case it means you're

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:42.860
untranspected and you're an organic free-range human and the other way to talk to your family

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.260
and friends is to just tell them that intramuscular injection many combination of substances with

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:52.060
the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb let me draw you a picture of the immune

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:58.060
system so I can show you why and then you can say well you know transfection and healthy

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:04.460
humans is actually criminally negligent because there are hundreds of thousands of academic biologists

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.580
and doctors who should have done known better because they've used transfection in their own work

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:13.980
and finally viruses are not patterned integrity which means the way that we talk about them and

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:20.460
think about them as being under selective pressure and and reacting to selective pressure and

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:26.860
and enriching their infectiousness survivors are are virulence and all these other things attribute

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:33.980
things to them that can only be really attributed to patterned integrity and RNA has not been shown

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:41.260
to have these attributes and so in a lot of ways these no-virus people have been have been right

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:47.660
for a long time and it's just really unfortunate how their narrative was so curated that it

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:53.900
was detrimental to our progress but we're here now and it's time for everybody to apologize for

01:19:53.900 --> 01:20:00.940
what they did and then we'll build this new independent bright web of people who are trusted

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:07.260
because they have a proven track record of being trustworthy unlike this uh you know I don't know

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:12.300
what Barbara Malone says you got to give trust to earn trust or something I don't know I hope

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:18.220
that in the last four years if anything I've been consistent enough in telling you what I think

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:23.420
and what I understand and explaining it so that you know in the end I've been able to challenge

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:29.820
you and myself to get through this with with honesty and I think that's where we are so

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:39.180
so please don't forget this is really a stream that is brought to you by some really important

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:43.980
people and I thank all of them very very much for subscribing and for supporting

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:53.500
and I thank you very much for sharing my work please share the work often I believe it's much

01:20:53.580 --> 01:21:00.540
more likely if this is a lab leak please share this work it is a lot of work and it's a lot of

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:06.620
time that I take away from my family to do this and I'm not whining I do think it is definitely

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:12.460
necessary I'm just saying that I'm trying to fortify this work because we've got a lot more work to

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:16.300
thank you very much and I'll see you tomorrow
