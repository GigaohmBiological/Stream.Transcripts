00:13.433 --> 00:14.934
Okay, now that's wicked fast.

00:15.554 --> 00:17.154
Oh wait, it says 1202.

00:18.075 --> 00:21.016
Technically speaking, that is not the first one in the chat.

00:21.236 --> 00:24.117
The cash is still up for grabs, ladies and gentlemen.

00:24.977 --> 00:31.579
If you're in the chat and you haven't posted yet, you could be the winner of big prizes.

00:31.639 --> 00:32.260
There it is!

00:32.760 --> 00:34.260
Tosics Cube is the winner.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.741
Nice, nice work.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.901
Ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological.

00:40.141 --> 00:48.364
RNA cannot pandemic, intramuscular injections are dumb, and transfection is a crime on January 10th, 2025.

00:49.704 --> 00:50.425
Hello, everybody.

00:50.465 --> 00:51.065
Good to see you.

00:52.625 --> 01:01.629
If you want to check out who I am and my record as an academic tenure-chasing neurobiologist, please go to PubMed.

01:02.520 --> 01:10.703
put in my last name, C-O-U-E-Y, and the first initials J and J. Thank you very much for being here, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12.203 --> 01:15.364
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:15.845 --> 01:17.665
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:19.626 --> 01:20.026
Isolation?

01:20.066 --> 01:20.406
What was it?

01:20.566 --> 01:21.667
Isolation and purification.

01:23.507 --> 01:24.207
Of the virus?

01:24.327 --> 01:24.508
Yes.

01:25.768 --> 01:27.529
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:34.324 --> 01:36.806
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:37.467 --> 01:42.352
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:43.132 --> 01:44.634
I don't understand what the issue.

01:44.654 --> 01:44.754
I see.

01:44.794 --> 01:46.055
No, it depends on how they use it.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.731
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:01.811 --> 02:03.651
I mean, he actually isolated it.

02:03.912 --> 02:07.833
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:07.913 --> 02:09.994
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:15.736 --> 02:21.338
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:22.022 --> 02:34.267
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

02:34.547 --> 02:36.547
It's just a big hassle in the end.

02:37.148 --> 02:43.150
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not,

02:49.514 --> 02:52.835
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

02:52.895 --> 02:55.475
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

03:02.117 --> 03:03.937
It's literally turning into worst-case scenario.

03:03.957 --> 03:07.738
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:07.858 --> 03:12.079
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:17.318 --> 03:21.722
That Sam Harris quote is from the 8th Bret Weinstein podcast.

03:21.782 --> 03:25.525
It's before they were doing live with him and his wife.

03:25.685 --> 03:30.529
He was doing his own podcast and at first, at least on that one, there isn't even a video of it.

03:31.710 --> 03:37.115
It's Bret Weinstein's 8th podcast in 2019 in December that you can find that quote.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.915
that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:39.935 --> 03:42.676
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:42.696 --> 03:45.077
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:45.097 --> 03:47.478
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:47.498 --> 03:49.619
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.401
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:52.421 --> 03:54.862
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:54.882 --> 03:57.203
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:57.223 --> 04:00.505
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

04:00.525 --> 04:02.846
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

04:02.866 --> 04:05.247
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

04:05.267 --> 04:05.327
I'm

04:05.799 --> 04:07.440
We want everybody to feel good.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.802
That's not the way life is.

04:12.324 --> 04:13.825
But you can tell if someone's lying.

04:14.465 --> 04:16.227
You can sort of feel it in people.

04:18.028 --> 04:18.748
And I have lied.

04:18.768 --> 04:19.809
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:19.829 --> 04:20.730
I don't want to lie.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.591
I don't think I'm a liar.

04:22.691 --> 04:23.732
I try not to be a liar.

04:23.752 --> 04:24.613
I don't want to be a liar.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.895
I think it's really important not to be a liar.

04:29.995 --> 04:49.690
the rules protect yourself at all times follow my instructions keep it clean touch gloves if you wish let's do it sweaty palms this is so crazy like goosebumps this is so crazy i feel so nervous like what in the world man he introduced

04:50.745 --> 05:09.250
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:09.270 --> 05:18.832
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment

05:23.066 --> 05:24.268
I don't care how you get there.

05:24.288 --> 05:26.951
I don't care what you do to get there.

05:26.971 --> 05:29.614
The goal is to win.

06:16.563 --> 06:21.725
Just hold on loosely, but don't let go.

06:21.865 --> 06:29.708
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control.

06:29.768 --> 06:38.011
You'll bet that it's hard once you believe it, and a whole lot of space to breathe in.

06:38.492 --> 06:44.254
It's so damn easy when you feel exhausted.

07:12.986 --> 07:14.808
You're gonna lose control.

07:14.988 --> 07:19.753
You may be too soft to be leading.

07:19.973 --> 07:24.037
And a whole lot of space to breathe in.

07:24.077 --> 07:28.942
Don't let her slip away.

07:51.989 --> 07:53.350
feel like what you had.

07:53.370 --> 07:57.573
So hold on loosely, but don't let go.

07:57.653 --> 08:04.177
If you cling to tightness, you're going to lose control.

08:04.257 --> 08:16.286
You're barely someone to believe in, and a whole lot of space to breathe.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.330
You're gonna lose it

09:11.505 --> 09:12.531
To hide

09:41.618 --> 09:44.782
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this time I think it could be different.

09:44.902 --> 09:46.303
I do think it could be different.

09:48.886 --> 09:54.072
I think we just got to pull our heads out and realize what's right in front of our eyes.

09:56.607 --> 09:58.268
Intramuscular injection is dumb.

09:58.308 --> 10:01.690
Transfection was always criminal and RNA cannot pandemic.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.091
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.

10:04.151 --> 10:10.894
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:10.914 --> 10:16.377
My name is Jonathan Cooey, coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

10:17.637 --> 10:19.198
It's very good to see everybody here.

10:19.238 --> 10:20.639
Let me see if I can pull this off.

10:22.245 --> 10:23.125
Good morning, everybody.

10:23.165 --> 10:23.925
Welcome to the show.

10:23.986 --> 10:31.207
Again, this is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise, crooked-back news brief brought to you by a biologist.

10:31.267 --> 10:32.448
It is the 10th of January, 2025.

10:33.468 --> 10:35.889
I've got a pretty good message this morning again.

10:35.909 --> 10:36.929
I hope I'm in focus.

10:39.530 --> 10:42.551
Yeah, we are... Wow, I don't even know what to say.

10:43.531 --> 10:46.272
It's very easy to summarize the position that we're in right now.

10:46.332 --> 10:47.392
COVID shots are bad.

10:48.226 --> 10:49.427
Let's not talk about 2020.

10:49.628 --> 11:04.605
And I think this sort of rubric will help you understand where we are, how we got here, what's the danger of where we are, and why it is so darn important to get our act together for our kids' sake.

11:08.189 --> 11:12.894
So I want to be clear that we do have a message that we're trying to develop in the background.

11:12.954 --> 11:14.736
I think there's a couple books to be written here.

11:14.756 --> 11:17.138
A couple short books to be written.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.040
I'm not talking about large tomes.

11:19.721 --> 11:24.146
I'm talking about short and to the point handbooks for mankind.

11:26.368 --> 11:29.530
None of this hunter-gatherer's guide to the galaxy nonsense.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.672
Very simple messages.

11:33.713 --> 11:35.934
Very, very simple messages are what we need right now.

11:36.414 --> 11:38.556
Like healthy people don't get sick.

11:39.076 --> 11:42.098
Like this bad biology 101 is what we need to fix.

11:42.178 --> 11:47.101
And the bad biology can be summarized by evolution because DNA or DNA therefore evolution.

11:47.978 --> 11:50.840
And I think we can think our way out, but we're all going to have to do the work.

11:50.920 --> 12:01.708
We're all going to have to do the exercises that are needed in order to extricate our brains from this trap, this trap that we've been in since we were kids, this trap that our parents grew up in.

12:02.869 --> 12:04.470
And I do think there is a way out.

12:05.411 --> 12:10.434
And it is very succinct and precise language about these crucial biological myths.

12:11.431 --> 12:18.174
And very precise language about these crucial biological myths instantaneously dispels them.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.714
That's what I love about this statement.

12:19.754 --> 12:23.456
Intramuscular injection is the single worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

12:23.976 --> 12:30.259
Has all kinds of thought sparks in it that makes people, if they really read it and understand it,

12:31.139 --> 12:48.744
It forces any doctor, any biologist, or any would-be armchair virologist to rethink what they have thought they were certain about, or just to be put in a position where they must cling to that certainty with nothing to edify it.

12:50.564 --> 12:53.066
And so that's what I think we need to focus on.

12:53.086 --> 12:58.849
We need to focus on a new biology 101 that's life as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

12:59.609 --> 13:07.854
And so, you know, maybe one really short question for anybody that believes genes are important is where is puberty encoded in the human genome?

13:12.213 --> 13:25.998
I'll say that again, you ask somebody that question sometime, the next time you get to interview Kevin McKernan or Mark Lander, why don't you ask him where puberty is encoded in the Human Genome Project, so we can figure that one out.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.439
So yeah, it's...

13:30.785 --> 13:31.987
It's crazy where we are, right?

13:32.067 --> 13:36.693
I have a very succinct message about a background signal being misconstrued as spread.

13:36.713 --> 13:47.048
I have a very succinct message about how RNA cannot pandemic and the health freedom movement in America and around the world has a message that's the COVID shots are bad, but don't talk about 2020.

13:48.968 --> 13:51.050
I mean, this is where we are right now.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.034
This is the dates, the 2025 over there.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.235
Do you see the timeline here?

13:55.275 --> 13:57.858
Going all the way back to 2015 right here.

13:57.878 --> 13:58.959
I'm not a very good weatherman.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.123
Just above my head, 16, 17, 18, and 2019 where presumably the release occurred.

14:08.900 --> 14:20.826
And so I have a pretty succinct explanation I want to expand on a little bit to make sure I start with that pretty regularly now, because I do think it's important that this is where people try to challenge us and try to sharpen our message.

14:21.746 --> 14:35.392
I think that there was no effort at the beginning of the pandemic to make any reasonable differentiation from a absolutely loud, hot, noisy background of RNA and DNA from all sources, bacterial, phage,

14:37.073 --> 14:57.528
fungus, everything from ourselves to other animals, insects in the air, water, I don't care what, microbes everywhere, all that signaling was ignored at the start of the pandemic and then they just told you they could roll out a test and draw up a signal from the background that represented the spread of a novel virus.

14:58.288 --> 15:04.093
And my argument is, is that all the people that are still selling that story have always known that transfection is a crime.

15:04.653 --> 15:15.763
And they've always understood that part of the sort of caper that they were going to help pull off was to pull a little bait and switch with EUAs and with the FDA and with all the regulations.

15:16.403 --> 15:20.786
to use an emergency to call transfection an investigational vaccine.

15:21.186 --> 15:41.718
And I think Robert Malone was very central to making sure that nobody reasonably questioned this bait and switch, this little shell game that they played with what is essentially worthless intellectual property from decades ago being recycled and reintroduced as something investigational and novel that resets an intellectual property clock.

15:41.778 --> 15:45.440
And I'm pretty sure they're all playing that game primarily.

15:46.704 --> 15:56.210
And so in 2019, just one possibility that doesn't require any magic, it doesn't require any special biological myths that you just got to take my word for.

15:57.311 --> 16:07.177
I'm just suggesting that there is a background signal and they could have released a pure signal on that background and anyone that was told to find it or needed to find it or should find it would find it.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.865
And if Shengxi Li was working for us, then she just reported what she found.

16:12.726 --> 16:24.880
And if that signal overlapped significantly enough with the background, the nonspecific PCR test could be used to magically turn that into a novel spreading pathogen, especially because we have no data from before 2019.

16:28.820 --> 16:41.677
And so again, be sure you understand that you can't find anyone else in the health freedom movement side of any of this that can explain the illusion of the pandemic in under two minutes, except for me.

16:44.838 --> 16:53.025
Of course, the other side of this story is that there was a problem to manage mostly in Western countries, maybe even exclusively in Western countries.

16:53.065 --> 17:10.419
And that problem was the large family size after World War II was a population pyramid bump that was going to result in a large quantity of people that were going to age out and be a burden on our retirement systems and a burden on our healthcare systems because old people need more medicine.

17:11.437 --> 17:15.879
And the last six months of medical care in a system like the United States is about $500,000.

17:16.800 --> 17:39.612
And so knowing that this problem was coming for decades is what population pyramids have been showing us, what population pyramids could have shown us at the beginning of the pandemic, that an expected rise in all cause mortality might be conveniently managed using myths perpetrated by traitors to hide murder with lies.

17:42.864 --> 17:47.725
And so again, in less than two minutes, I've been able to explain to you how the pandemic was pulled off.

17:49.146 --> 18:12.493
And now Noam Chomsky's thoughts and contributions about how people are governed kind of fills in the rest of the blanks, because what they needed to do was put people in front of you that were really certain about what was going on, had real certain answers about it, had real important questions to ask with possible answers that they were already well-versed in, and that lively debate

18:15.001 --> 18:20.704
was scripted and orchestrated by the very state that came to save us.

18:22.465 --> 18:25.607
By the very system that we think we're fighting.

18:26.527 --> 18:35.092
We are fighting within that system, against that system, fighting on the same team as people that also work in that system.

18:37.193 --> 18:38.554
Noam Chomsky told us this.

18:39.116 --> 18:46.341
Well, the title of this talk, as I suppose you saw somewhere, is Necessary Illusions, Thought, Control, and Democratic Societies.

18:46.841 --> 18:50.804
The title is intended to be paradoxical.

18:50.924 --> 18:51.404
It should be.

18:52.516 --> 18:59.800
Thought control and indoctrination are inconsistent with democracy, therefore one can't have thought control in a democratic society.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.141
I can't do anything about that sound.

19:02.181 --> 19:09.125
That's the recording that we have, maybe on purpose, because maybe here Noam Chomsky is still absolutely speaking 100% truth.

19:09.825 --> 19:15.488
In the next nine minutes, at some point in the first some minutes, he's going to absolutely blow your mind.

19:19.484 --> 19:21.844
There is a standard view about this matter.

19:22.664 --> 19:38.268
This standard view is expressed, for example, by Supreme Court Justice Powell, who speaks of what he calls the societal purpose of the First Amendment, that is, enabling the public to assert meaningful control over the political process.

19:38.748 --> 19:44.830
Now, he happens to be speaking about the media and their crucial role in affecting this societal purpose.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.477
I would already argue that that's wrong.

19:49.517 --> 20:15.263
And I think because of all the discussions that I've had with some of my good friends during the pandemic, like regular guy on YouTube, I've come to understand this as a, as kind of not the right argument because freedom of the press is the freedom of the printing press, the ability to print pamphlets and cartoons and small books and flyers and distribute them without anybody stopping you.

20:17.210 --> 20:32.241
It's not about necessarily, maybe newspapers too, but understand it's very, you got to be very careful when he starts talking about the media in general, because this is, this is beyond the scope of the constitution at the time that it was written.

20:32.281 --> 20:40.787
And so we have to be careful because we don't want to be enticed into overextending things and overextending our understanding to the point where we are

20:42.017 --> 20:48.363
we are no longer armed with the legal protections that we should be because we don't understand them well enough.

20:48.383 --> 20:57.311
So I'm not saying yes or no, I'm just saying be careful with these words and be careful with this subject because it's not as simple as I understand free speech.

20:57.972 --> 21:01.793
and the history of free speech, and it's in the Constitution, and that kind of thing.

21:01.813 --> 21:06.295
You've got to be careful about what he says, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, this kind of thing.

21:06.755 --> 21:08.036
You want to learn that stuff.

21:08.496 --> 21:14.258
This is part of the list of exercises that everybody's got to do in America if we're really going to pull our heads out.

21:14.298 --> 21:22.541
We can't assume that these people that have stepped in front of us to speak for us are really speaking the truth.

21:24.982 --> 21:25.622
We need to know.

21:27.799 --> 21:35.908
remarks could be made and should be made about the educational system, about publishing, about intellectual life generally.

21:36.669 --> 21:47.422
But the media are particularly important in providing free access to information and opinion, and therefore allowing a democratic process to function in a meaningful way.

21:48.266 --> 21:59.395
So the media therefore fulfill what the New York Times on Sunday called their traditional Jeffersonian role as a counterbalance to government power.

22:00.356 --> 22:15.369
And if one takes Jefferson seriously, as he may or may not have taken himself, he would presumably have gone further, speaking not just of counterbalancing government power, but counterbalancing other concentrations of power.

22:15.942 --> 22:24.325
specifically the kinds that developed in the post-Jeffersonian period, corporate power, which is the dominant feature of modern social life.

22:25.125 --> 22:29.467
Well, all of this seems obvious, even tautological.

22:29.607 --> 22:31.987
What else could be the foundations of democracy?

22:33.148 --> 22:42.411
But it's worth bearing in mind that there is a contrary view, and it probably is the dominant view among liberal democratic theorists.

22:42.931 --> 22:45.452
It goes right back to the origins of modern

22:46.001 --> 23:04.890
democracy in the English revolutions of the 17th century, English revolution of the 17th century, at that time, great concern was expressed over popular agitators, itinerant preachers and workers with their little printing presses and their pamphlets and their public speeches.

23:05.590 --> 23:06.410
So when is this?

23:06.590 --> 23:08.011
The 17th century.

23:09.612 --> 23:14.014
They were already worried about these people with their pamphlets and their printing presses.

23:16.277 --> 23:17.198
Now listen carefully.

23:18.579 --> 23:28.506
Which were removing the cloak of mystery behind which the parliament and the king were carrying out their much narrower struggle than when you read about in the history books.

23:29.667 --> 23:43.457
Now, these people were, in their words, they were people who wanted to be represented not by lords and gentry, but by men of their own kind.

23:44.105 --> 23:48.768
men who know the people's swords," quoting from Leveller pamphlets.

23:49.329 --> 24:05.861
And observing their activities, one contemporary historian warned that by revealing the workings of power, they will make the people so curious and so arrogant that they will never find humility enough to submit to a civil rule, which is a big problem.

24:06.565 --> 24:20.695
Well, well after these radical Democrats had been crushed by about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

24:21.195 --> 24:24.978
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.

24:25.979 --> 24:35.105
Now, these concerns arose once again during the American Revolution, as they typically do during popular revolutions.

24:35.798 --> 24:49.317
And it was not until the 1780s that the Radical Democrats in the American Revolution were crushed, and there was no more any thought that people would be represented by

24:50.950 --> 24:55.091
people at that time, men of their own kind, who know the people's sores.

24:55.691 --> 25:17.057
They would be represented by those qualified to rule over them, of whom they were permitted to make a selection, the modern democratic political system, which follows the principle laid down by the founding fathers, that those who own the country ought to govern it, quoting John Jay.

25:17.377 --> 25:17.598
Now,

25:20.200 --> 25:21.642
All of this comes right to the present.

25:21.742 --> 25:26.026
I won't try to go through the history, but there's a rich tradition expressing these same views.

25:26.126 --> 25:27.408
It comes right down to the present.

25:28.189 --> 25:41.783
In the modern version, Reinhold Niebuhr, for example, the revered moralist and foreign policy analyst, he explained that, in his words, rationality belongs to the cool observer.

25:42.939 --> 25:48.162
But because of the stupidity of the average man, he follows not reason, but faith.

25:48.862 --> 25:52.104
And this faith relies upon necessary illusion.

25:53.565 --> 25:55.425
I thank him for offering me my title.

25:55.866 --> 26:08.112
This faith relies upon necessary illusion and emotionally potent oversimplifications, which have to be provided by the myth-makers, by the cool observers, folks like us, smart guys.

26:09.112 --> 26:09.553
Wow!

26:10.732 --> 26:33.153
myths provided by the cool observers sounded like he described the stupid complicated and dumb simple things that I've been saying I just stumbled upon myself as I realized that this was the pattern they either attacked you with a stupid complicated narrative with too many details for you to check with too many terms for you to learn the concepts too many concepts to integrate

26:34.309 --> 26:37.892
Or they attack you with a dumb, simple narrative that's like, what?

26:37.992 --> 26:38.552
Wait, what?

26:38.612 --> 26:39.773
There's so much more involved.

26:39.833 --> 26:40.694
No, it's just this.

26:47.458 --> 26:50.340
I could let it play, but I think I want to keep this a little tight here.

26:51.421 --> 26:56.705
I also really enjoy thinking about why movies show up when they do.

27:03.462 --> 27:08.785
I have been debating with a few friends of mine about why it is that the remake of Dune came out now.

27:10.866 --> 27:21.393
You know, it's not for nothing that real ID in the United States in May of 2025 is going to be required to use your driver's license to fly around America.

27:21.553 --> 27:25.915
You can't use your driver's license anymore unless it's a real ID as of May of 2025.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.677
And that was already scheduled for quite some time.

27:28.717 --> 27:30.178
Do you think that that's an accident?

27:31.576 --> 27:45.725
Or are you able to see on long enough time horizons now to understand that these people are manipulating our habits and opinions, our concerns, so that we didn't see the real ID coming as the real digital ID.

27:45.785 --> 27:46.326
It's coming.

27:46.986 --> 27:49.628
It's already been in law for a very, very long time.

27:49.688 --> 27:52.750
The infrastructure to give you a real ID is already in place.

27:52.770 --> 27:53.811
That's not going anywhere.

27:53.911 --> 27:56.312
Every DMV in America already has it.

27:56.372 --> 27:56.853
Florida.

27:57.373 --> 27:59.794
has already been using it since the start of the pandemic.

27:59.814 --> 28:05.237
That was what was so comical about moving to Florida with all these people at the beginning of the pandemic.

28:05.257 --> 28:08.559
They were going to pick up a real ID by just changing their driver's license.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.862
And so there's a, that's happening right now.

28:15.882 --> 28:17.663
This is happening right now.

28:17.803 --> 28:23.046
And that's what I've come to realize, even with this, let me just point out something here.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.860
I just want to point out what happens here.

28:35.621 --> 28:38.524
Now remember, I'm not saying this isn't a good movie.

28:38.564 --> 28:39.745
I enjoyed this movie a lot.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.086
I enjoyed the book a lot too.

28:42.668 --> 28:48.815
But what's really interesting is that now, remember, he's going into a mountain full of fanatics.

28:50.162 --> 29:02.599
I mean, don't even call them fanatics, just think about them as very serious religious people, like these are real Muslims, and they're in Saudi Arabia walking around the Black Cube,

29:03.590 --> 29:05.371
He's walking through the middle of them.

29:05.411 --> 29:10.253
You know, they think about it like that Okay, that's what this is supposed to represent on a different planet.

29:10.973 --> 29:17.556
And these guys are serious Religious people that are all dressed the same they live in a very harsh environment.

29:17.596 --> 29:26.980
They have you know witches then and and and seers that are really powerful and really smart that they submit to and They're gathering at the bottom of a planet.

29:27.060 --> 29:32.622
There's thousands of them inside of this giant cave and they're all praying together and

29:37.193 --> 29:40.354
We must talk.

29:40.374 --> 29:42.435
Stillcar, you can stop this.

29:42.755 --> 29:43.175
Do you hear me?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.636
You have the power to stop this.

29:44.776 --> 29:47.737
Northern women, you are not allowed to speak inside the circle.

29:48.457 --> 29:49.958
If you want to speak, you know what to do.

29:50.478 --> 30:00.361
Now, if she wants to speak inside of the circle, what she's supposed to do is kill her leader, because only tribal chiefs are allowed to speak inside of this circle.

30:01.762 --> 30:04.683
So it seems like kind of a pretty strict rule,

30:06.087 --> 30:22.700
that in the face of tens of thousands of fellow strict followers that have their whole life followed this strict set of rules that includes no one can talk inside of this circle unless they kill their tribal leader in order to sit and take their place.

30:23.821 --> 30:31.747
But this girl just casually goes up and starts talking inside of the circle, and that guy just casually warns her, hey, you know you're not allowed to do that.

30:31.927 --> 30:35.070
If you want to talk inside of the circle, you know what you have to do.

30:39.482 --> 30:42.045
This scene has always bothered me.

30:44.447 --> 30:48.411
Because very quickly she should be dead, right?

30:48.451 --> 30:51.834
Now some people are gonna approach and pretend to pull her out.

30:54.377 --> 30:56.639
But then she does something even crazier.

30:56.799 --> 30:59.562
Again, remember, she's in a room with thousands of people.

30:59.702 --> 31:03.466
Outside of this room are thousands more people that couldn't fit in.

31:07.588 --> 31:18.090
She's gonna stand up in the middle of that mosque in Saudi Arabia while thousands of people are walking around the black cube and start shouting, Muhammad is a fake.

31:18.590 --> 31:20.130
This is how they enslave you.

31:20.670 --> 31:21.911
And nothing's gonna happen to her.

31:27.752 --> 31:30.072
She ignored him and kept talking.

31:32.452 --> 31:35.653
Now she takes her headdress off to show that she doesn't give a shit.

31:37.059 --> 31:41.242
And then she screams at a cave full of fanatics.

31:44.725 --> 31:51.489
And then it's not even a one of these religious people that pulls her down and shuts her mouth.

31:54.732 --> 32:01.737
But it's a guy who doesn't believe in the religion and knows that Paul is kind of sort of just going with it.

32:03.328 --> 32:04.848
In the book, that's not how this is.

32:05.069 --> 32:07.369
In the original movie, I don't think that's how this is.

32:07.409 --> 32:12.071
His girlfriend from the Fremen is not skeptical of him.

32:15.432 --> 32:29.356
It's a very interesting plot twist tossed into this little movie where everybody that's watching the movie knows that Paul doubts himself, that his mom doubts himself, that the Bene Gesserit doubt him.

32:31.152 --> 32:32.613
That's not what happens in the book.

32:32.773 --> 32:36.275
That's not what happens in the original movie.

32:40.338 --> 32:41.359
It's very strange.

32:41.419 --> 32:48.104
It's an interesting plot point in my mind, because, you know, again, here he's going to come out and convince the whole cave.

32:49.725 --> 32:53.647
She just stood up in front of a bunch of people and said, this is bullshit.

32:54.608 --> 32:57.070
That's my boyfriend, and this is bullshit.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.132
And this bullshit is how they enslave us.

33:02.657 --> 33:09.779
But yet now he's going to show and produce prophecy and magic and read this guy's mind.

33:09.839 --> 33:12.219
And then everybody's going to drop down to their knees.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.560
Get yourself in trouble.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.901
This is none of your business.

33:17.401 --> 33:19.341
Rabban Harkonnen himself killed my family.

33:19.401 --> 33:21.242
He gave me this scar to remember him by.

33:21.462 --> 33:22.902
This is all of my business.

33:28.530 --> 33:31.751
Now remember, these people believe that she's like all powerful.

33:31.811 --> 33:33.371
She tells them what to do.

33:33.651 --> 33:34.952
All of these people would listen.

33:36.532 --> 33:41.033
And all those women walking with her have something to say too, that none of these people would dare doubt.

33:42.514 --> 33:45.055
And yet she just stood up and said, this is all bullshit.

33:45.075 --> 33:46.395
This is how they enslave us.

33:54.363 --> 33:58.226
And now here comes her boyfriend that she thinks is full of shit.

34:01.688 --> 34:03.509
And he's gonna step inside of the circle.

34:04.210 --> 34:09.473
And he's gonna talk smack about why would I destroy my best warrior.

34:09.493 --> 34:12.095
Only tribe leaders can speak.

34:12.595 --> 34:19.520
If you wish to share your voice, you must take his place by defeating him and returning his water to the well.

34:20.381 --> 34:23.343
You think I'm stupid enough to deprive myself of the best of us?

34:32.551 --> 34:40.282
So that guy who's ready to give up his life in order to help him fulfill a prophecy that he believes in since he was a boy

34:41.755 --> 34:52.700
didn't feel it was that big of a deal for that chick to come up and say some crap about, you know, you can stop this and you should stop this when he thinks that this is the culmination of his lifelong belief.

34:53.261 --> 35:00.164
And in fact, their entire culture's multi-generational belief in the arrival of a savior.

35:01.499 --> 35:12.590
And yet nobody in this room that is gathering because they are considering the possibility that multi-generational myth is about to be fulfilled in the form of a savior from the outer worlds.

35:14.331 --> 35:21.378
This lady decides to violate, you know, something that, you know, you have to kill in order to get in here, by the way, and they don't care.

35:22.796 --> 35:37.606
She stands up in front of a room of thousands who believe enough to ride giant worms across their country through a giant sandstorm in order to get to this cave and hang out with this guy and test and figure out whether he's... Do you see the problem?

35:40.988 --> 35:41.848
She should be dead.

35:44.070 --> 35:50.694
And it should have ruined the story and the telling of this story that anybody doubted him and goes into the final battle doubting him.

35:57.449 --> 36:03.252
This is not a good telling of the story, and there's probably a reason that I haven't been able to discern yet.

36:04.152 --> 36:09.935
But it's a very weak telling of the story, because he's about to drop a whole- I'm pointing the way!

36:10.315 --> 36:13.637
He's about to drop a whole cave to their knees after just telling, look.

36:14.257 --> 36:19.560
This is a battling culture where they fight each other to the death.

36:28.168 --> 36:32.871
Think of samurais in ancient Japan in shogun with high honor.

36:33.751 --> 36:42.096
Think about any kind of extreme religion and these people have just been told, there's not one person in the room that can take me, you are all pussies.

36:43.877 --> 36:48.140
And that's not a joke with these people, that is an insult to their honor.

36:52.182 --> 36:53.563
That's why they all stand up.

36:57.386 --> 37:00.227
And those are the people that she said, you guys are idiots.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.888
This is how they enslave us.

37:01.988 --> 37:03.949
This prophecy is a joke.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.510
Those people.

37:21.298 --> 37:26.100
So with his words alone, he's able to make thousands of people stand up and draw a knife.

37:27.554 --> 37:36.361
Thousands of people want to murder him right now, but they not very much They're not interested in that circle thing with you know, you have to kill your tribe leader to talk in there They're not worried about that.

37:36.421 --> 37:50.313
She could have said something from outside of the circle She didn't need to walk into the circle to talk to Stilgar she could have talked from outside of the circle she violated that custom

37:51.155 --> 37:51.815
on purpose.

37:52.475 --> 37:55.716
Then she violated the custom again by taking her headdress off.

37:56.136 --> 38:01.638
Then she violated and insulted them again by saying that this prophecy is how they enslave us and she's alive.

38:03.338 --> 38:08.540
But this guy walks into the middle of the circle and says all you guys are wimps and every one of them draws their knife.

38:26.206 --> 38:27.187
It's a powerful scene.

38:27.887 --> 38:29.408
Do you think you could have a chance?

38:56.431 --> 38:57.052
Dune.

38:57.092 --> 38:57.352
Marty.

39:26.142 --> 39:27.283
And there it is.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.063
So he follows the script.

39:54.019 --> 40:01.403
follows the script supposedly that the Bene Jesuit put there generations ago, and these people grew up believing.

40:02.544 --> 40:07.426
And now the weird part about it is, right, is that he's able to read that person's mind.

40:07.466 --> 40:10.468
He's able to read, he's able to use the voice.

40:10.508 --> 40:11.929
He's able to do all these things.

40:11.969 --> 40:16.051
He's able to drink the, so there's no reason for her not to believe in him.

40:19.497 --> 40:24.441
There's no reason for him not to believe that he's the one because they're not supposed to have boy kids, right?

40:24.501 --> 40:27.344
And now they had a boy kid before they were supposed to have a boy kid.

40:27.404 --> 40:28.925
So that's a problem.

40:29.045 --> 40:30.326
Do you see the problem here?

40:32.148 --> 40:44.038
Something is broken, is incongruent in the way this story is told in order to tell it in such a way that defeats the sort of magic of the story in my opinion.

40:48.971 --> 40:55.232
I want you to listen to the author of Dune explain something that I think is very, very profound.

40:57.633 --> 40:58.193
It's really cool.

40:58.213 --> 41:00.673
Let me see if I can get this to work.

41:06.974 --> 41:14.396
It's a two-edged sword without a handle, and if you grab it hard enough to wield it, you're going to be self-destructive.

41:14.796 --> 41:14.996
Yes.

41:17.822 --> 41:23.624
I deliberately did this in Dune for that whirling backward through the story.

41:25.585 --> 41:26.605
There was another thing there.

41:28.306 --> 41:31.327
In the pacing of the story, it was very slow at the beginning.

41:31.367 --> 41:33.328
It's a colloidal rhythm all the way through the story.

41:33.728 --> 41:34.208
It's a what?

41:34.449 --> 41:35.289
A colloidal rhythm.

41:35.389 --> 41:35.729
Okay.

41:36.129 --> 41:36.709
Very slow.

41:37.550 --> 41:39.410
Pace increasing all the way through.

41:40.211 --> 41:44.733
And when you get to the ending of it, I've chopped it at a

41:50.541 --> 41:59.413
at a non-breaking point so that the person reading the story skids out of the story trailing bits of it with him.

42:00.734 --> 42:05.801
And on this I know I was successful because people come to me and say that they want more and

42:07.867 --> 42:17.225
I have said this to my classes, that in many ways as satisfying as Dune is, I find it unsatisfying because there are so many unanswered questions.

42:17.285 --> 42:20.190
You don't tie up the loose ends of, say, Paul's sister.

42:22.192 --> 42:26.495
Unless you read, what is it, The Hunters of a Thousand Worlds?

42:26.515 --> 42:29.078
That marvelous little footnote.

42:29.818 --> 42:30.559
Princess Alia.

42:31.360 --> 42:34.022
But, or several other things.

42:34.162 --> 42:46.953
The whole question of the Spacing Guild itself and how it got to be the way it was is handled very, you know... Well, let's examine something as far as fiction in general is concerned.

42:49.312 --> 43:01.575
Now there are other reasons why stories are remembered, and I'm talking about the story in the classic sense of the of the Jean L'Heure who goes from castle to castle to earn his meal.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.515
All right.

43:03.575 --> 43:04.195
Entertainment.

43:04.235 --> 43:05.536
Sure.

43:05.636 --> 43:10.817
The stories that are remembered are the ones that strike sparks from your mind.

43:12.737 --> 43:13.497
One way or another.

43:15.038 --> 43:15.998
It's like a grinding wheel.

43:17.540 --> 43:19.261
They touch you and sparks fly.

43:19.401 --> 43:26.107
Whether this be something like the Miller's Tale of Chaucer or Sir Gawain and the Grain of Knicks, if you please.

43:26.147 --> 43:26.587
Yes, indeed.

43:27.848 --> 43:35.014
Or, well, we could adduce thousands of other examples up to, say, Treasure Island or what you will.

43:35.094 --> 43:36.575
There's sparks there, okay?

43:36.595 --> 43:38.056
I'm just reading your term.

43:40.057 --> 43:44.481
Now, we all have stories that we go on with after finishing reading them.

43:47.412 --> 43:50.856
As children, we can remember playing Treasure Island.

43:52.177 --> 43:52.517
Right.

43:52.618 --> 43:53.579
Or playing Tom Sawyer.

43:53.759 --> 43:54.520
Or Tom Sawyer.

43:56.041 --> 43:56.622
Any of these.

43:57.323 --> 43:58.384
We remember playing these.

43:58.924 --> 44:00.746
The story stayed with us.

44:02.368 --> 44:07.894
The characters and their conflicts and their joys, their play.

44:10.422 --> 44:11.262
All stayed with us.

44:12.022 --> 44:19.184
And it enkindled sparks in our own imagination so that we were then active in creative play.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.104
That's exactly right.

44:20.164 --> 44:21.904
We went on and told the story ourself.

44:21.944 --> 44:26.745
Now, I deliberately did this in Dune for that purpose.

44:27.145 --> 44:36.486
I want the person to go on and construct for himself all of these marvelous flights of fantasy and imagination.

44:37.247 --> 44:39.167
I want him to... You see,

44:40.654 --> 44:45.482
You haven't had the Spacing Guild explained completely just enough so that you know its existence.

44:46.724 --> 44:48.006
Now, with lots of people...

44:48.919 --> 44:50.220
They've got to complete this.

44:50.300 --> 44:50.580
Yes.

44:50.820 --> 44:52.181
So they build it up in their own minds.

44:52.241 --> 44:52.421
Yeah.

44:53.162 --> 44:56.044
Now, this is right out of the story, though, you see.

44:56.064 --> 44:56.144
Yeah.

44:56.164 --> 44:57.445
Or the whole... The sparks have flown.

44:57.965 --> 44:59.286
Bene Gesserit, you pronounce it?

44:59.366 --> 45:00.166
Bene Gesserit, yeah.

45:00.186 --> 45:00.747
Bene Gesserit.

45:01.607 --> 45:06.631
Their whole mystique and so on is relatively unexplained.

45:06.671 --> 45:11.774
Why do they want the Kwisatz Haderach in the first place, you see, is relatively... The name of the game is power.

45:11.794 --> 45:11.994
Yeah.

45:13.095 --> 45:14.376
And they want power, hmm?

45:16.513 --> 45:18.954
That explains it to a certain extent.

45:19.274 --> 45:21.935
They want power in a specific way.

45:23.275 --> 45:31.077
You know, I've always been amazed by the statement, or by the label, of psychological warfare.

45:32.958 --> 45:35.639
There can be no such thing as psychological warfare.

45:38.620 --> 45:42.641
If you develop a psychological weapon

45:45.413 --> 45:51.877
sufficiently that it is destructive to any potential enemy, it will destroy you with the enemy.

45:56.460 --> 46:03.864
It's a two-edged sword without a handle, and if you grab it hard enough to wield it, you're going to- It's just self-destructive.

46:04.304 --> 46:04.544
Yes.

46:08.867 --> 46:11.869
So we could have a variation on the Lord Acton

46:12.887 --> 46:41.245
notion power corrupts both the user and the receiver of the power both absolutely right uh-huh actin i'm gonna keep it playing but i just want to answer christy this is the author of dune frank herbert being interviewed by somebody on his book saw it yeah how interesting i had no i hadn't thought of the who power corrupts and now the betty jesserett see this

46:42.742 --> 46:44.883
You see how they keep themselves in the background.

46:46.664 --> 46:47.384
Yes, that's true.

46:48.024 --> 46:53.606
They want a user of power they can control.

46:54.987 --> 46:55.347
I see.

46:56.848 --> 46:57.728
With safety to them.

46:57.968 --> 46:58.368
That's right.

46:58.428 --> 46:59.889
It's a safety device, you see.

47:00.549 --> 47:00.849
Yeah.

47:02.150 --> 47:05.111
And I say this in several ways, not in this way.

47:05.131 --> 47:05.211
Yeah.

47:06.303 --> 47:13.391
not in this blatant, you know, way, but implying it with all of its permutations, because there are much more to this.

47:13.411 --> 47:15.794
We could go on for several hours discussing this aspect of it.

47:16.474 --> 47:24.123
Yeah, the whole attitude of Reverend Mother Gaius Moyam, for example, Helen Gaius Moyam.

47:26.405 --> 47:27.627
Yes, I see how we could.

47:28.459 --> 47:29.660
various aspects of it.

47:30.220 --> 47:35.303
Well, I'd like to examine this a little bit further in some of the religious constructs.

47:35.703 --> 47:37.444
Before we get into that, let me tell you something.

47:38.985 --> 47:55.574
I was up at Sonoma State last month to talk to a class up there, and the question that seemed to attract the most attention from the class, somebody asked back there, what's all this nonsense about controlling people with voice?

47:58.743 --> 48:04.846
And there seemed to be a lot of agreement with this point of view, that it's impossible to do this.

48:06.066 --> 48:08.867
And so I said, we do it all the time.

48:08.887 --> 48:09.588
Of course we do.

48:10.668 --> 48:17.851
And it's amazing to me that anybody could even begin to question this as a fact of our existence.

48:18.551 --> 48:19.432
And they couldn't see it.

48:19.452 --> 48:20.652
So I said, well, I'll give you an example.

48:22.633 --> 48:24.414
I'm going to describe a man to you.

48:26.135 --> 48:27.175
You know this man.

48:29.068 --> 48:36.551
And I'm going to give you a task of controlling him by voice after I've described him and after you recognize him."

48:37.392 --> 48:54.799
I said, this is a man who was in World War I as a sergeant, came home from World War I to his small town in the Midwest, married his childhood sweetheart, and went into his father's business.

48:55.976 --> 48:59.698
raised two children whom he didn't understand, and they don't understand him.

49:03.261 --> 49:16.509
He joined the VFW and the Legion, went on every picnic, every convention, lived by the double standard, he thought.

49:19.691 --> 49:23.293
Now, on the telephone,

49:24.156 --> 49:25.137
Strictly by voice.

49:25.698 --> 49:47.578
I want you to make him mad Now that might be hard for us to put into context, you know world war one veteran came home took over his father's business raised two kids that he doesn't understand and

49:48.884 --> 50:03.298
Maybe we just have to make it a more modern person, like somebody who voted Democrat their whole life, really hates Donald Trump, lost their business during the first part of COVID, and blames everything on Donald Trump, and now call him up and piss him off.

50:03.438 --> 50:04.740
Well, that's very easy, right?

50:07.762 --> 50:20.174
And you could flip that around too and say, you know, you know, somebody who maybe you wouldn't be able to make them mad, but you could, you could come up with a scenario like that right now, even if you just went like, uh, uh, it's somebody who's cheered for the Green Bay Packers his whole life.

50:20.274 --> 50:25.018
And, uh, you know, really likes all everything about football and whatever, then you could come up with something, you know, like.

50:26.099 --> 50:28.942
And Brett Favre is the best of your franchises ever had.

50:28.982 --> 50:31.044
And you could try to come up with something that would piss them off.

50:31.064 --> 50:32.726
You can control them with words.

50:35.939 --> 50:46.042
And so it's really not a very bad representation to say when you say, give me the water, that they just do it because the way you use the language forces them to do it unconsciously.

50:46.082 --> 50:54.805
It's a perfect representation of what an illusion of consensus on social media might get someone to do without even knowing they're doing it.

50:56.185 --> 50:57.446
Accepting a mythology.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.787
Explaining a mythology to their kids.

51:02.347 --> 51:02.627
Listen.

51:04.448 --> 51:05.368
Simplest thing in the world.

51:06.913 --> 51:31.418
Now, what we're saying here is that, see I've drawn a gross caricature of course, but we're saying that if you know the individual well enough, if you know the subtleties of his strengths and weaknesses, that merely by the way you cast your voice, by the words you select, by the intonations, whatever,

51:32.034 --> 51:56.580
whatever right you can control him now if you can do it in a gross way obviously with refinement you can do it in much more subtle fashion and it's done all the time in politics and this is one of the techniques it's done all the time according to noam chomsky and according to uh somebody like noam chomsky they've known this for generations already all the way back to the 17th century they've known this

52:00.339 --> 52:02.921
This is very important to see, ladies and gentlemen.

52:02.941 --> 52:09.364
It's really, really, really important to see because we are very close to breaking this.

52:11.986 --> 52:13.427
Because that's what they did to us.

52:13.947 --> 52:25.934
From the start of the pandemic, there were people put in place with scripts, with limited spectrums of debate that they curated, that they got us excited about, that they knew how to get us to fight about.

52:27.014 --> 52:38.827
They set up each other to be on different sides of these arguments and deferred to each other as the source of those arguments that they were arguing.

52:40.529 --> 52:48.637
And ignored all the people like me and all the people like Mark, if there are any other people like me and Mark, who have not accepted

52:49.761 --> 53:03.725
the spoon feeding of a laboratory leak mystery that needed to be solved over the course of five years and a rollout of transfection under the guise of investigational vaccine that these people still haven't been able to adequately describe.

53:08.546 --> 53:17.649
And so yes, I do think that there are important pieces of this puzzle that have come in contact with my family that make it very easy for me to declare that these are ways to find your way out.

53:18.752 --> 53:36.112
And so if you would do the calendar work here and you pay close attention to the 27th of November, 2020, when this website came live, it's not there anymore, but the contents of that website are still available on the internet where these people, I think this guy actually roped in a couple of good guys.

53:37.270 --> 53:56.173
along with Claire Craig, who's not a good guy, and wrote a paper that didn't really usefully question the existence of the novel virus, nor did it usefully question the usefulness of PCR to track it, just questioned the specific details of the test put out by Drorsten and accepted by the WHO.

53:58.854 --> 53:59.975
And that is by design.

54:00.635 --> 54:10.941
And that's why none other than Kevin McKernan, whose father was doing work that supported the Human Genome Project, and that he was actually the Research and Development Director of.

54:10.961 --> 54:16.945
There's no reason for him to be on podcasts in 2020 unless he's working.

54:18.700 --> 54:20.841
And I think that math is really easy to do.

54:20.961 --> 54:23.963
And so I've been following him for five years now.

54:24.063 --> 54:27.865
And he was recently on the Danny Jones podcast just at the end of the year.

54:28.305 --> 54:40.032
And I've been using this slide repeatedly and accusing him of being committed to a spectacular level to these national security lies.

54:41.158 --> 54:57.406
And so I think at some point, you know, I hope everybody would look at this interview and try to find out if I'm full of it or not, but I've taken a couple of clips here and I want to make a couple of points with these clips in order to make sure that you see that the truth is available right now because that's the way it has to be.

54:57.447 --> 55:05.771
They have to create this much chaos and expose themselves because we've pushed them this far because the pressure has been steady and they are breaking.

55:05.831 --> 55:07.712
They have only one script to stick to.

55:09.656 --> 55:12.581
So what is this spectacular commitment to lies that's required?

55:12.622 --> 55:13.764
What lies are they committed to?

55:13.804 --> 55:17.050
Here's one of the main ones, in my humble opinion.

55:21.176 --> 55:35.884
It was a group in Seattle that showed that their lab people were testing positive for kovat But didn't have kovat and they only tested positive if you remember the kovat test They actually had three assays usually testing for the virus.

55:35.904 --> 55:38.946
They would look at the spike They'd look at nucleocaps and they look at the envelope.

55:39.206 --> 55:48.291
Okay, so that is an absolutely positively 100% national security state lie It's a lie

55:48.973 --> 55:57.096
There were so few tests available in 2020 and 2021 that had three amplicons.

55:58.717 --> 55:59.757
I bet you can't find one.

56:02.058 --> 56:03.219
I'm challenging anybody.

56:03.279 --> 56:09.561
I'm challenging Kevin McKernan and Sasha Latipova and all of those people on Team Robert Malone.

56:09.661 --> 56:13.243
Show me a PCR, EUA PCR test

56:14.451 --> 56:20.696
description from 2020 that had three amplicons, the N-protein, the E-protein, and the S-protein.

56:20.736 --> 56:21.257
Show me one.

56:24.680 --> 56:29.383
And then show me all the ones from 2020 that had just one amplicon.

56:31.445 --> 56:32.246
Let's make a list.

56:34.482 --> 56:45.666
And then let's make a list of how many of the reported cases that were reported in 2020 and 2021 were taken from tests with three amplicons or taken from tests with one amplicon.

56:49.287 --> 56:53.609
This is one of the biggest lies that all of these people have to cover up that took place in 2020 and 2021.

56:53.649 --> 56:55.050
It is the conversion of a background noise

57:00.236 --> 57:02.941
to a high fidelity signal that represents a novel virus.

57:02.981 --> 57:11.077
And that's why he was on the scene in 2020 so often in so many different podcasts, because that part of the narrative needed lots of protection.

57:12.591 --> 57:19.695
And that's why he is explicitly saying this on the Danny Jones podcast, not just, you know, wherever they wandered and wherever they talked about.

57:19.755 --> 57:31.140
No, no, this is a carefully orchestrated strip script that he has been practicing and perfecting with coaching from the behind the scenes for more than five years now, ladies and gentlemen, wake up.

57:34.802 --> 57:39.044
And I made this point on the, on the show the other day, because it's really important.

57:39.865 --> 57:39.945
Um,

57:42.133 --> 57:43.974
What was the known background in 2019?

57:44.455 --> 57:45.395
We don't have any data.

57:47.256 --> 57:49.218
Is the E protein a background signal?

57:49.418 --> 57:51.199
Is the N protein a background signal?

57:51.259 --> 57:56.382
Is the S protein or the amplicon that they selected from it a background signal?

57:58.303 --> 58:02.946
Is there the conserved regions of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase subunits?

58:02.986 --> 58:05.408
Are any of those hot background signals?

58:07.150 --> 58:18.252
Are any of these background signals possibly confounded with these purported signals that are actually from PCR tests we can never check because they're all gone?

58:20.373 --> 58:23.554
And he's lying to you about the number of amplicons that were in most tests.

58:23.574 --> 58:28.675
He's lying to you by not telling you that nested primers would make them much more accurate and they were not used.

58:30.015 --> 58:34.976
Canada did not use nested primers and did not use multiple amplicons.

58:36.598 --> 58:44.960
And then nobody was checking the sequence of the amplicon that was brought up except for DITRA, where all of these crappy tests were sent for the first two years.

58:45.020 --> 58:51.421
Again, something that none of these people are gonna talk about because that's 2020 and 2021 and they don't talk about those years anymore.

58:54.041 --> 59:01.603
Except for, again, being on podcasts where they tell these lies and they show a spectacular commitment to them.

59:02.745 --> 59:08.447
where their narrative and their understanding and their explanation has not advanced in five years.

59:08.968 --> 59:15.170
You can go back to the Vance Crowe podcast and hear the same story that he's telling now, plus DNA contamination.

59:18.752 --> 59:21.153
It's time for this to break, ladies and gentlemen.

59:21.253 --> 59:26.935
Right now, they are absolutely over their skis because this script is over.

59:29.516 --> 59:31.137
And they have created a remnant

59:32.651 --> 59:39.755
stream that is too valuable and too necessary and too central to their plan.

59:41.596 --> 59:49.180
Sequencing all the college kids repeatedly in 2020 and 2021 using testing that none of these people opposed.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.342
None of these people said, maybe take the year off and don't go back to college.

59:54.923 --> 59:58.825
And then the following year, they mandated a transfection for those kids.

59:58.905 --> 01:00:00.826
And again, none of these people spoke up at all.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:21.185
because that remnant stream was part of their money, part of their job to create it, to normalize it, and to ignore it while they talked about the shots, while they talked about a lab leak, while they talked about ivermectin, while they ignored the opioid crisis in America.

01:00:26.536 --> 01:00:29.578
And so that's why they came to my house and not yours.

01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:42.925
Because in 2020, as a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, I was on YouTube saying that these people were using a nonspecific PCR test to convince us of something that's actually just a background.

01:00:42.965 --> 01:00:43.865
I wasn't perfect.

01:00:44.265 --> 01:00:46.987
I wasn't exactly right yet, but essentially I had it.

01:00:48.234 --> 01:00:53.977
And I was also saying that transfection would be a crime because they already know that this is not an investigational vaccine.

01:00:54.457 --> 01:01:01.240
As a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and it wasn't until October of 2020 that they asked me not to come in.

01:01:04.542 --> 01:01:07.203
And so again, just trying to keep this timeline straight, right?

01:01:07.223 --> 01:01:07.783
Because that was 2020.

01:01:07.823 --> 01:01:12.266
And in 2020, in November, you know, months after I was already there,

01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:25.282
comes the Corman Jorstin review with Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig of Heart and a few other people that I don't trust at all.

01:01:27.464 --> 01:01:34.352
And they didn't object to the testing and didn't question the novel virus, just said that the test that Jorstin got through peer review too fast.

01:01:35.553 --> 01:01:36.975
And a year later,

01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:44.517
In December of 2021, Kevin McKernan is on my stream saying the RNA isn't pure.

01:01:45.098 --> 01:01:53.505
There are live dead technologies that we could use so that we could tell whether there were, you know, the right number of viruses were there or anybody was infectious or not.

01:01:54.286 --> 01:02:06.431
And I was blown away by the absolutely stupid amount of detail that he could give me and the stupid, simple explanation, or the dumb, simple explanation of overcycling of PCR.

01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:09.472
And he was just confirming everything I wanted to believe I understood.

01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:13.354
And so he didn't say anything useful.

01:02:13.414 --> 01:02:19.856
He just confirmed the novel virus, the strains, and confirmed that the PCR wasn't working exactly as they said.

01:02:21.117 --> 01:02:22.417
Maybe the virus was around in 2019.

01:02:22.457 --> 01:02:22.958
You never know.

01:02:31.636 --> 01:02:36.460
And so it's a very spectacular commitment to lies that this guy has shown us on Danny Jones.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:42.526
And the one that I find the most striking and the one that I've kind of been just wondering, how is it that no one else is seeing this?

01:02:43.006 --> 01:02:45.088
Why isn't someone else doing a stream about this?

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:51.494
Wouldn't somebody call me about this by now and say, hey, wait a minute, this is weird, Jonathan.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.436
Can you help us understand what's going on here?

01:02:55.617 --> 01:02:57.379
So I guess I gotta do it on my own stream.

01:03:01.055 --> 01:03:05.117
Ralph Baric's the guy who arguably taught WIV how to create the coronavirus.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:06.117
Taught who?

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:08.038
The Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:08.358
Oh.

01:03:08.558 --> 01:03:13.160
So there was their grants that Fauci basically boomeranged off of EcoHealth into the WIV.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:29.226
So the first thing is that he's saying that these grants that fund EcoHealth and WIV and that Ralph Baric taught the WIV how to make coronaviruses or how to do gain of function, which is absurd because

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:37.269
The details of gain of function are just ligation, which is the joining of two DNA together.

01:03:37.329 --> 01:03:45.191
Ligation is what all molecular biologists on all academic benches, they're all doing it for some reason or another, just join this DNA with that DNA.

01:03:45.632 --> 01:03:50.713
And the way you do it is you cut it with one enzyme that works there, enzyme that works there, and then you get the ends that fit together.

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:51.814
And everybody knows how to do it.

01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:52.474
It's old school.

01:03:54.093 --> 01:04:02.284
So this idea of assembly even has like a number of products, like Golden Gate Assembly is just a product that people sell for putting things together.

01:04:04.367 --> 01:04:06.589
Ralph Baric didn't teach them anything.

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:09.774
That's like saying Ralph Baric is the one who taught the French how to make cakes.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.155
It's like, well, no.

01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:14.363
There's lots of bakers out there.

01:04:14.443 --> 01:04:15.604
Everybody knows how to bake.

01:04:15.764 --> 01:04:19.829
And everybody knows how to make a DNA sequence and link it to another DNA sequence.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:27.158
And anybody that was doing plant biology on the molecular level would know how to make a large construct of DNA using ligation techniques.

01:04:28.763 --> 01:04:34.047
And that's no different when doing synthetic biology in virology.

01:04:34.067 --> 01:04:38.530
You're just making DNA, and then you have to make a big DNA, because they're big DNA, I guess.

01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:49.237
And then you put that big DNA in a cell culture in a highly pure, large quantity, and then the cell culture reacts to it, packages it, whatever, and you call that virology.

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:54.601
And he is spectacularly committed to covering up that lie.

01:05:01.067 --> 01:05:04.189
because they put a gain-of-function ban on funding here in the States.

01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:05.450
Obama did that, right?

01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:06.030
Obama did that.

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:17.198
And so what Fauci's creative way around that was, well, we'll fund a nonprofit called Echo Health Alliance, run by Peter Daszak, who will launder the money for us into the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:05:17.238 --> 01:05:19.359
Therefore, it's not directly from Fauci to Wuhan.

01:05:19.379 --> 01:05:20.700
It's going through some intermediary.

01:05:21.381 --> 01:05:30.687
And through that process, they taught the Wuhan Institute of Virology how to do this seamless no-seam technique, which is a technique of assembling

01:05:31.287 --> 01:05:39.430
No-see-um technique is something that Ralph Baric said a couple times in passing, and now these guys are talking about it like it's just the thing.

01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:41.251
It's just so absurd.

01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:43.972
That's also how they wrote it in the book, which is just dumb.

01:05:44.472 --> 01:05:48.074
But again, if you gotta follow the script, you gotta follow the script, right?

01:05:48.334 --> 01:05:50.815
viral genome, so you don't leave any evidence behind.

01:05:51.855 --> 01:05:55.956
It's a ligation technique that uses a golden gate assembly.

01:05:57.177 --> 01:05:58.537
It's a clever way of putting stuff together.

01:05:59.057 --> 01:06:02.738
So he just called it golden gate assembly, so it's not a no-see-um technique at all.

01:06:02.798 --> 01:06:07.280
It's a technique that probably descends directly from one of his colleagues in the Human Genome Project.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:10.981
Right?

01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:26.523
And so it's a really, again, it's stupid, complicated, so that Danny Jones can't follow what he just said, which is that all the things that I just said was bullshit, because it's not an OCM technique, and Barrick didn't teach him anything.

01:06:26.563 --> 01:06:32.525
They just used standard molecular biological tools, one of which has the name, before the pandemic, Golden Gate Assembly.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:42.193
But if you're not a biologist and you don't know the names and these details and some of these words and what they mean, then it can be very, very hard to follow.

01:06:42.253 --> 01:06:44.496
And that's what Stupid Complicated does.

01:06:45.838 --> 01:06:46.780
That's his specialty.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:53.280
You can't tell that someone built it necessarily from a laboratory.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.241
However, they did leave behind some fingerprints that make us, that got them caught basically.

01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:04.302
And you should, if you want to hear about that story, you should get Charles Rixey on here.

01:07:04.402 --> 01:07:07.942
Charles Rixey has helped, you know, RFK write his book about this.

01:07:08.803 --> 01:07:10.463
And Charles- So what?

01:07:10.823 --> 01:07:11.323
Sorry, what?

01:07:12.003 --> 01:07:16.544
Rixey's a Marine and he's been like a dog on a bone with this problem.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.241
And he was the one who leaked the defuse proposal.

01:07:20.481 --> 01:07:22.123
Are you familiar with the defuse proposal?

01:07:22.243 --> 01:07:22.944
No, what is that?

01:07:23.064 --> 01:07:24.185
So that's really interesting.

01:07:24.766 --> 01:07:31.693
Charles Rixey leaked the defuse proposal to drastic and drastic released a cleaned up PDF of it.

01:07:32.534 --> 01:07:36.858
And also actually, CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:07:36.918 --> 01:07:38.440
reported that Veritas

01:07:40.163 --> 01:08:00.659
released the diffuse proposal and didn't say anything about Rixie, which is really weird because Rixie and I met for the second time in person at the Knoxville CHD conference and the first time at my house in January of 2022.

01:08:03.362 --> 01:08:17.991
when he came to my house to convince me that the diffuse proposal was real when I had spent the last three months telling everybody that drastic was full of shit with this proposal and it fits so well it was a joke they're not spraying vaccines into bat caves and causing pandemics come on people

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:26.423
sent Charles to my house at the beginning of 2022 in order to make sure that I rejoined drastic and streamed.

01:08:26.463 --> 01:08:31.925
And that stream is the stream that Robert Malone supposedly recommended to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:35.486
and Senator Ron Johnson to watch and to hire me.

01:08:37.206 --> 01:08:41.668
And yet here is the fellow from the Human Genome Project, the former

01:08:42.415 --> 01:08:54.798
Acolyte of Mark Lander and and Francis Collins on a very popular podcast not even a month ago saying that it's Charles Rixey who helped Robert F. Kennedy jr.

01:08:54.878 --> 01:09:08.562
Write his book and that Charles Rixey released the diffuse proposal So we can do some fact-checking on that right that's pretty easy to do we can check that right now, let's just Let's look here

01:09:09.815 --> 01:09:13.936
and see on the acknowledgements page whether or not Charles Rixey's listed.

01:09:14.056 --> 01:09:14.496
Hmm.

01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:15.757
Let's see.

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:16.797
Would he be listed here?

01:09:16.837 --> 01:09:17.477
Because they were.

01:09:18.037 --> 01:09:20.658
Children's Health Defense was paying us, so let's see.

01:09:21.218 --> 01:09:28.340
Judith and Nancy and Carrie and Rebecca and Gina and Rachel and Rita and Aaron and Jackie and Zoe.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.401
I know all those people.

01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:30.401
Brian Hooker, you know.

01:09:30.461 --> 01:09:34.182
Laura Bono, she started the whole organization, right?

01:09:34.802 --> 01:09:37.103
Kim's a lawyer and Ralph's a lawyer.

01:09:37.143 --> 01:09:37.923
And there's Risa.

01:09:37.943 --> 01:09:39.244
I really like Risa a lot.

01:09:39.264 --> 01:09:39.804
She's great.

01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:42.225
Mary, not so much.

01:09:42.325 --> 01:09:46.686
Sue is his secretary, I think.

01:09:46.726 --> 01:09:50.428
David Whiteside, I think, is his nephew that runs the Defender podcast.

01:09:50.848 --> 01:09:53.249
Heather Ray is on the science team.

01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:54.329
She's so sweet.

01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:57.930
Amy Miller, Matt, Ray Flores, another lawyer.

01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:59.431
So there's no Rixie there.

01:10:00.211 --> 01:10:06.895
This book would not have been possible without the expertise and invaluable insights provided by Jonathan Cooey?

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:15.019
Gavin DeBecker, that's his head of security that apparently Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:27.206
still owes him money because he's still sending out emails to everybody saying that he's got debts from his unsuccessful presidential campaign because he had to pay for private security that the government wouldn't pay for.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:34.194
private security that he had when I met him at the CHD conference in 2022.

01:10:34.535 --> 01:10:46.383
So it's weird when he declared that he was gonna run for president, that he had security already, that he was already having for years, then needed new, and now he's in debt where he wasn't in debt.

01:10:46.463 --> 01:10:47.784
I don't know how that really works.

01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:54.289
Okay, anyway, Merrill Nass, Francis Boyle, that's the guy from the University of Illinois who's an expert on

01:10:55.510 --> 01:11:01.913
on bioweapons, just like the doctor from Maine who's apparently an expert on bioweapons.

01:11:02.713 --> 01:11:07.155
Paul Thacker, Brett Weinstein, brilliant evolutionary biologist.

01:11:07.295 --> 01:11:13.718
Lee Smith, Jan Jekielek of the Epoch Times, you know, that guy's awesome.

01:11:13.818 --> 01:11:16.159
Elaine Duar, I don't know who that is, Derek Harvey.

01:11:16.219 --> 01:11:18.760
Stephen Quay, the guy from Australia who's

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.921
who's sure that this is a lab leak.

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:24.681
Andrew Huff, real stand up fella.

01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:27.322
I got to meet him in Boston at Bobby's announcement.

01:11:28.002 --> 01:11:33.003
Jeffrey Sachs, that's an interesting guy, the most popular speaker at the Vatican.

01:11:33.503 --> 01:11:40.344
I really think I was told a story or heard a story that Bobby met Jeffrey Sachs in a tent in Africa when he was 21 years old.

01:11:40.805 --> 01:11:41.985
But again, that could be just me.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.066
Could just be me not remembering everything.

01:11:45.406 --> 01:11:50.641
But Jeffrey Sachs also supposedly had a private meeting with Kevin McCairn.

01:11:51.431 --> 01:11:57.477
that's the raccoon guy, and Charles Rixey on a weekend on a Saturday when I was going camping.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:12:06.705
And they supposedly had a private discussion with him that they later had another live stream that they discussed, you know, what they had talked about with Jeffrey Sachs, and they really wanted me to be there.

01:12:06.725 --> 01:12:09.628
But I was going camping, so I didn't show up.

01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:12.510
Richard Ebright is the guy who at the end of

01:12:13.572 --> 01:12:27.752
In the middle of 2020, when everybody was about to go back to college, he said that if they go back to college without masks or without mandates or without controls or without testing, that up to a quarter million college students would be dead by Christmas.

01:12:29.907 --> 01:12:38.729
Annie Jacobson is the lady with the very warm voice who goes on Joe Rogan's podcast and talks about how much she knows about nukes.

01:12:39.769 --> 01:12:40.949
Hal Gold, I don't know.

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:42.490
Alex Joska, I don't know.

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.070
And Stephen Kinzer, I don't know.

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:45.030
Okay, so there you go.

01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:50.832
I guess there's no, I don't see Charles Rixey listed here.

01:12:50.892 --> 01:12:52.192
That's kind of weird, right?

01:12:54.493 --> 01:12:56.353
I would be kind of shooting myself in the foot.

01:12:57.697 --> 01:13:08.748
If I come out against almost all of these people and say that, you know, these guys tricked me and that all of these people, I talked to them at the end of the publishing of the book and explained what I've been explaining for the last year.

01:13:08.768 --> 01:13:09.889
And they just ignored me.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.391
They didn't do anything about it.

01:13:15.174 --> 01:13:16.956
What do I have to gain by saying that?

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.911
So let's just keep going here.

01:13:24.951 --> 01:13:30.255
I mean, is there a, there's a, you know, interestingly enough, um, for this book, it's really cool.

01:13:31.155 --> 01:13:37.560
There is a, um, there's a index that we can see right here.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.222
So we can look in the index and see if the index works.

01:13:40.882 --> 01:13:46.786
First of all, um, here's the index for Jonathan Cooey and there's some pages we could go read.

01:13:46.806 --> 01:13:47.707
Okay.

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:56.639
So then that means, I guess, if Charles Rixey's in here and he's credited with all, you know, figuring this shit out, that there should be something in here on Rixey, huh?

01:13:56.679 --> 01:14:00.081
Let's see, hmm.

01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:12.410
Remdesivir, Revolution in Military Roads, Scholar, Rice, Ridley, Rinsberg, RNA viruses, Robert Wood Johnson, what the hell?

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.753
Why isn't there any Rixey in here?

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:18.355
If he helped him write the book,

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:24.109
Why wouldn't Rixie, why would McKernan mention Rixie?

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.730
Has McKernan met Rixie before?

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:28.571
It's not clear to me how he knows Rixie.

01:14:28.611 --> 01:14:29.851
Rixie's been to my house.

01:14:30.772 --> 01:14:35.173
I met Rixie at the Knoxville Conference of CHD in 2022, it was cool.

01:14:36.714 --> 01:14:44.177
I met Matt Crawford that day too, and Robert Malone, and Jill Glasspool Malone, and Whitney Webb, and Ryan Cole.

01:14:46.707 --> 01:14:47.807
It's really strange, right?

01:14:47.847 --> 01:14:48.828
Because I'm in the index.

01:14:48.868 --> 01:14:52.249
I guess since I'm in the index, we might as well just check to see what else, you know.

01:14:52.269 --> 01:14:53.610
I mean, what did they put in here of me?

01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:56.051
Uh, 281.

01:14:56.131 --> 01:14:56.511
Let's go to 281.

01:14:56.811 --> 01:14:57.231
Hmm.

01:14:59.932 --> 01:15:00.532
Let's see.

01:15:00.552 --> 01:15:00.532
281.

01:15:00.672 --> 01:15:00.932
Huh.

01:15:01.152 --> 01:15:04.714
I mean, maybe there's something about Rixie here.

01:15:05.314 --> 01:15:06.434
Maybe I mentioned Rixie.

01:15:07.695 --> 01:15:08.175
Hmm.

01:15:08.195 --> 01:15:08.175
281. 281.

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:24.703
Here it is right here on the bottom.

01:15:24.723 --> 01:15:24.703
281.

01:15:25.943 --> 01:15:34.145
Coronaviruses are composed of strings of RNA code which is very unstable in nature and gets increasingly unstable with each replication.

01:15:34.186 --> 01:15:39.987
That's likely why the SARS 2002 pandemic fizzled out so quickly.

01:15:41.008 --> 01:15:41.788
Says Jonathan Cui.

01:15:43.064 --> 01:15:46.391
An RNA virus is like a 1970s audio cassette.

01:15:46.431 --> 01:15:51.301
The master copy retains high fidelity, but every new copy thereafter loses quality and coherence.

01:15:52.182 --> 01:15:52.623
However,

01:15:53.786 --> 01:16:12.822
Barrick's reverse genetic techniques allow him to create DNA clones of artificially infectious strains on paper and then to generate in a lab huge numbers of identical particles that would far exceed the purity of any natural infection, enabling the potential production of stocks that were ideal launch pads for pandemics.

01:16:12.882 --> 01:16:15.985
So see, Bobby already understood it.

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.689
These words can't be in there if he doesn't already get it.

01:16:22.659 --> 01:16:25.608
It's just that I wasn't quite good enough at explaining it, right?

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:26.590
That's the one problem.

01:16:26.610 --> 01:16:28.516
So let's see if we got more in the indexes.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.801
283, so that's just one page away.

01:16:33.841 --> 01:16:38.123
Let's see if that's very similar here.

01:16:38.183 --> 01:16:40.163
Where is it?

01:16:40.183 --> 01:16:40.163
283.

01:16:41.344 --> 01:16:45.285
Bats and stuff and bats and stuff and bats and stuff.

01:16:47.566 --> 01:16:48.026
Do you see it?

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:48.706
I don't see it.

01:16:49.727 --> 01:16:51.787
Sorry, maybe I'll look at the screen instead of the book. 183.

01:16:58.786 --> 01:17:07.735
Baric's specialty, synthesizing super-infectious clones of naturally-occurring viruses, solved one of the long-standing challenges of CoV research, the near-impossibility of culturing most species in vitro.

01:17:21.909 --> 01:17:25.090
In this book, they are preserving the myth of viruses.

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:35.074
Even though before this book was published, I had decided that a lot of these no-virus claims were actually valid and that viruses might be an exaggeration.

01:17:35.953 --> 01:17:49.860
and that I wanted to explain it very succinctly by saying that they can find sequences in the wild, and then they can make pure copies of those sequences and pretend to study them in cell culture, but they're not recapitulating natural processes.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.121
This is what I got in the book.

01:17:51.821 --> 01:17:56.144
Researchers don't pass cultures of virus around like they do with bacteria.

01:17:56.704 --> 01:18:00.286
Cell lines or mouse lines, says biologist Jonathan Cooey.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:01.887
If you cannot,

01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:08.804
culture it, you cannot make enough to use as a stable laboratory model.

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:12.727
Barrick's techniques made this a non-issue.

01:18:13.747 --> 01:18:16.469
Barrick's lab clones were nearly perfectly pure.

01:18:16.509 --> 01:18:20.012
The frightening significance of this is difficult to overestimate.

01:18:20.752 --> 01:18:30.559
Barrick had devised a method for creating huge quantities of infectious RNA, you could just say pure RNA or pure DNA, that would otherwise never exist in nature.

01:18:31.547 --> 01:18:56.456
Barrick's techniques allowed him to make laboratory recombinations of any identified viral genes, any sequences they find in the sewer, in an animal, that she had recovered in her fishing expeditions using metagenomic sequencing of bat blood, feces, and saliva to generate billions of identical lab clones in concentrations and purities, ideally suited to cause a pandemic.

01:18:56.696 --> 01:18:59.057
Maybe not, because the pandemics can't happen.

01:19:00.677 --> 01:19:06.141
but ideally suited to plant a sequence and find it wherever they wanted to.

01:19:07.602 --> 01:19:08.343
That for sure.

01:19:09.764 --> 01:19:12.586
And so thanks to Barrick and the tutorials he gave the Chinese.

01:19:12.646 --> 01:19:25.215
And again here, this is Bobby writing the same thing that McKernan was quoting on the Danny Jones podcast more than a year later, that Barrick taught them something that's just, it's bacon bread.

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:30.679
Molecular ligation of DNA molecules is just, it's weak sauce.

01:19:30.859 --> 01:19:31.861
It's not important.

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:36.065
I'm gonna keep going with the index, 310.

01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:40.670
Remember, Rixey helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:41.311
write this book.

01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:42.752
310, hmm.

01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:54.181
This is in, interesting, this is in the Diffuse Proposal Chapter 47.

01:19:54.221 --> 01:19:59.467
Now, how did they use me for the Diffuse Proposal?

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:01.610
Here it is.

01:20:02.211 --> 01:20:04.513
Jonathan Cooey similarly observes.

01:20:05.489 --> 01:20:09.172
The fact that Fauci and NIH turned down DASAC's proposal is irrelevant.

01:20:09.212 --> 01:20:12.535
The proposal itself is evidence that the work may have already been done.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:16.839
And that's how modern research is conducted and funded.

01:20:17.439 --> 01:20:25.306
That's actually what I said on my podcast in January with Rixie in my own house in Shaler, Pennsylvania.

01:20:27.127 --> 01:20:28.529
In January of 2022, it dawned on me

01:20:32.498 --> 01:20:37.984
that that proposal could have already been done because, again, that's how a lot of proposals are done.

01:20:38.044 --> 01:20:39.726
They actually have the data already.

01:20:39.926 --> 01:20:40.807
They know it'll work.

01:20:41.348 --> 01:20:42.089
They've tested it.

01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:48.356
And for a few weeks, I thought, you know, that's really interesting.

01:20:48.416 --> 01:20:49.937
That is actually crazy.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:21:02.399
And now remember that podcast is the one that Robert Malone sat Bobby Kennedy down and sat Senator Ron Johnson down and said, hey, you got to watch this podcast and listen to these guys because they got it.

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:05.542
And part of what they got was this part right here.

01:21:07.423 --> 01:21:13.289
They oftentimes grant proposals are already done or some of the data has or the experiments have been done.

01:21:13.329 --> 01:21:14.530
They have preliminary data.

01:21:16.311 --> 01:21:21.875
And that was a very cool part of the story because then if the defuse proposal is real, then maybe they did do it.

01:21:22.216 --> 01:21:27.119
What they left out of the book is that Dr. Cooey doesn't think that the defuse proposal is real.

01:21:27.159 --> 01:21:28.280
They left that part out.

01:21:30.342 --> 01:21:35.386
Even though I told them repeatedly from the moment that they hired me, that that was the case.

01:21:36.755 --> 01:21:45.604
And in fact, that was the main reason why I think they hired Rixey in the beginning was to make sure that Rixey would be there to make sure that the diffuse proposal was real.

01:21:46.064 --> 01:21:47.906
And that's why it was really a problem.

01:21:50.103 --> 01:22:06.697
when my coworker and I came on a meeting that had this Kevin McCairn in there, and then the uncompromised, non-sabotaged people at CHD that looked into Kevin McCairn realized that this is not just a random guy.

01:22:07.418 --> 01:22:13.039
that was in the hotel room with Rixie, and if Rixie won't explain himself, he's fired, and that's how he lost his job.

01:22:13.479 --> 01:22:26.923
So it is extraordinary that not only is he not in the book, not only is he not in the index, and there's even a cast of characters that I'm listed as a neurobiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Rixie is not listed at all.

01:22:27.423 --> 01:22:36.705
Not as the guy who helped drastic release the diffuse proposal like Kevin McCarran of the Hell Human Genome Project said on the Danny Jones podcast, no,

01:22:37.305 --> 01:22:38.385
Not at all!

01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:39.426
Stop lying!

01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:52.789
Okay, 310 and now what's the next one?

01:22:52.809 --> 01:22:57.650
310, 319, still probably the... Oh no, next chapter is wrapped around my finger.

01:22:57.670 --> 01:22:57.650
319.

01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:01.811
Oh, this is still Diffuse Proposals, sorry.

01:23:01.911 --> 01:23:04.092
This is still the Diffuse Proposals, so maybe I got it.

01:23:06.966 --> 01:23:07.406
Here it is.

01:23:08.588 --> 01:23:20.519
Jonathan Cooey explains, the magic of Barham's no-see-um technique is to invisibly weave these telltale spelling changes into the viral sequence between relevant genes without altering the viral protein.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.063
This is like changing the spelling of the word without changing its pronunciation or meaning.

01:23:25.464 --> 01:23:27.666
The casual listener will never notice the difference.

01:23:27.726 --> 01:23:30.589
And Cooey continues, consider how a Brit would spell color.

01:23:31.109 --> 01:23:39.456
And so this whole analogy here comes from a discussion that I had with Bobby about how to explain what Barrick's techniques do and don't do.

01:23:39.916 --> 01:23:47.282
And I was still thinking that I was learning very fast and explaining very quickly to a guy who I thought was a hero.

01:23:49.043 --> 01:23:56.469
That a lot of people that I was working with at the time thought he was a hero, including Laura Bono and including all those names on that list.

01:23:58.015 --> 01:24:03.840
And so it was very easy for me to get sucked in despite how many people told me it was crazy and that he was compromised.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.522
And obviously he can't be a good guy.

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:07.784
I've heard it a lot, but I never believed it then.

01:24:07.804 --> 01:24:12.848
And I was getting paid like $9,000 a month.

01:24:12.888 --> 01:24:14.089
Why would I believe that?

01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:16.071
I thought I was finally winning.

01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:26.333
319, 349.

01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:26.333
Now that's interesting here.

01:24:41.943 --> 01:24:55.726
Dr. Jonathan Cooey pointed out that while numerous point mutations exist between SARS-CoV-2 and the Moenka cave virus, here we are again with the lab leak, the difference between the two did not occur in hundreds of mutations evenly across the genome as one would expect.

01:24:56.166 --> 01:25:06.608
And so here we are again with this citation here is going to be about the sequence that was reported versus the sequences that were in the database versus the database being erased.

01:25:07.188 --> 01:25:12.293
And then here we bring in the diffuse proposal again, although again, I'm not writing this, he's writing this.

01:25:13.714 --> 01:25:19.340
And then now we go back to the E protein and how the E protein and a lot of these reported viruses is the same.

01:25:20.441 --> 01:25:22.403
And at the time, I didn't realize why that was.

01:25:22.463 --> 01:25:26.506
But the reason why that is, is because they are pulling from a background using metagenomics.

01:25:26.547 --> 01:25:32.132
So a lot of times, that background is the same, which makes it even worse for their testing, right?

01:25:38.952 --> 01:25:42.236
And finally, again, you know, you can do this all yourself.

01:25:42.276 --> 01:25:43.037
The book's available.

01:25:43.057 --> 01:25:43.037
441.

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:43.878
So 441 says here, um...

01:25:59.042 --> 01:26:02.063
But not just engineered superbugs that concern us.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:11.228
With such an inventory of genomic sequences of every virus in the world, malevolent actors with billions of dollars at stake could attribute even the most harmless seasonal colds to a deadly villain.

01:26:11.969 --> 01:26:17.752
Pumped up in the media with pandemic porn and then a vaccine deployed on the terrified masses.

01:26:18.212 --> 01:26:22.815
Has Jonathan Cooey said no actual virus would even be necessary?

01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:32.511
And so again, these are all quotes taken from me at the beginning of this service when I still didn't get it.

01:26:32.831 --> 01:26:36.792
But by the end of the service, I understood that we had all been fooled.

01:26:37.872 --> 01:26:42.753
And I approached Bobby as if I could help him become unfooled.

01:26:43.453 --> 01:26:55.915
I approached him by email, and that email resulted in the Defender podcast that's Robert Malone and others on the list that CHD and Bobby curate, but actually it is me

01:26:57.307 --> 01:27:02.573
being interviewed and introduced as somebody that five other people are going to listen to and then comment on.

01:27:06.567 --> 01:27:33.718
And that was when I was finally waking up and realizing that, wow, we've been fooled, and we might have a chance to write this book the right way so that everybody will realize that this is just synthetic biology, that they're lying about a background, and that they fooled us, and that one of the best examples and best reasons why to believe that is because of the Allison Totura, Sina Bavari paper from 2019 that's also featured in this book and discussed in this book because I put it in there because

01:27:35.256 --> 01:27:42.821
Not because I found it, because my friend Mark Kulak showed me that paper, where Sina Bavari, head of the U.S.

01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:59.072
Emirates, says that with the last post-doc of Ralph Baric, who was also on Jeopardy, that a novel coronavirus out of a bat cave is coming soon as a pandemic, and that remdesivir would be a great thing to have on the shelves.

01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:07.248
And so that's the spectacular commitment to lies that I'm talking about here.

01:28:08.548 --> 01:28:20.154
This is Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project lying about how this book was written and Rixie's role in it, and by proxy then, lying about my role in it.

01:28:21.835 --> 01:28:23.056
Lying about the contents.

01:28:26.212 --> 01:28:39.763
And make no mistake about it, for the duration of the writing of this book, I represented the stance that the defuse proposal would be a very convenient way for the military to pretend that this is definitely a leak.

01:28:41.184 --> 01:28:46.829
A great way for anyone that wanted that to happen to pretend that this was a lab leak.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.630
What a strange place we are in.

01:28:56.891 --> 01:29:02.012
There was a grant that was what a strange place we are in where the Wuhan cover up.

01:29:02.572 --> 01:29:04.653
That's where this is the calendar, right?

01:29:04.873 --> 01:29:13.375
And 2020 when I was still working at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, I said they were using nonspecific tests to lie about a background to try and trick us into taking transfection to our kids.

01:29:14.943 --> 01:29:33.541
Then in November of 2020, the fake objection to the Corman PCR test that the WHO was using was released by Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig of Heart, two avid genome collectors before the pandemic.

01:29:34.383 --> 01:29:50.118
And then over a year later, Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project decides to grace my stream with his presence and tells me about live dead technologies that could have been used to break the illusion of overcycling or some nonsense like that.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:55.743
Little nuggets of the RNAs in Pure so it might be bad for you, but not really.

01:29:55.943 --> 01:29:58.266
And the strains and talking about sequencing.

01:29:59.315 --> 01:30:08.879
And the live dead technology is something that he said last year, like in 2024, about a few months before the end of the year on the Brett Weinstein podcast.

01:30:08.959 --> 01:30:09.219
Okay.

01:30:09.239 --> 01:30:12.380
So he said that in end of 21 on my podcast.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:16.482
And then almost three years later on the Brett Weinstein podcast, he hadn't moved at all.

01:30:16.862 --> 01:30:24.325
Same bullshit story, the same bullshit story that he was telling in 2020, you know, PCR works, but not really, or kind of, I know how it works.

01:30:25.373 --> 01:30:35.015
And so now in 2024, at the end of the year, he's told you that the Wuhan cover-up book was assisted by Charles Rixey.

01:30:36.836 --> 01:30:43.218
And this blue scenario here, this blue screen is how long I worked for CHD and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:44.458
Almost two years.

01:30:47.136 --> 01:30:49.559
And at the end of that service, the book was released.

01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:54.284
They did an interview with me about the book that they never released because they said it wouldn't sell the book.

01:30:54.684 --> 01:31:02.432
And then at the end of 2023, I was fired because of what I said on my December 22nd podcast about Robert Malone.

01:31:05.876 --> 01:31:06.597
Just the facts.

01:31:08.752 --> 01:31:10.413
And so you can see it if you want to.

01:31:11.114 --> 01:31:13.496
You can dispel their mythologies if you want to.

01:31:13.536 --> 01:31:21.883
You just have to keep working because they've all revealed themselves after five years as following a pattern that is not a good guy.

01:31:21.903 --> 01:31:24.726
It's not a rescue team.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:33.966
These aren't valiant fighters on a white horse, as Robert Malone was described in that church militant interview.

01:31:34.587 --> 01:31:36.589
No, ladies and gentlemen, these are actors.

01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:37.670
These are participants.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:40.212
These people are employed by the slavers.

01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:46.591
And that's why in 2025 we are where we are.

01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:49.173
That's January 10th, 2025.

01:31:49.273 --> 01:31:54.738
This is the gigohm biological high resistance, low noise information brief that everybody ignores.

01:31:54.858 --> 01:32:02.404
And in 2020, the people that ignore it now were the people that were the health freedom movement that was already ahead.

01:32:02.464 --> 01:32:09.510
And before the pandemic with Vax, the movie, and you know, we need to genetically screen people for vulnerabilities to adjuvants.

01:32:11.124 --> 01:32:20.766
Those are the people that knew about the fear and cleavage site, the spike protein toxicity, the censorship, the lab leak, the no virus, the flying AIDS, gain of function.

01:32:21.046 --> 01:32:21.726
Oh my goodness.

01:32:24.447 --> 01:32:27.088
And that's the health freedom movement now.

01:32:27.188 --> 01:32:28.528
So how did that work?

01:32:28.988 --> 01:32:33.529
There was a whole year and a half before anybody did anything.

01:32:35.086 --> 01:32:41.849
Maybe Jessica Rose and Matt Crawford were doing some things in 2020 here to do some cat wrangling.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:33:02.517
But in general, nothing happened in 2020 until the middle of 2021 when the great hero, Bobby Malone, was on the Dark Horse podcast with the great hero, Steve Kirsch, and the great hero, Brett Weinstein, where they decided that a combination of Moderna, previous infection, and ivermectin could result in a sort of hybrid herd immunity.

01:33:05.862 --> 01:33:11.407
Of course, then he went on the Joe Rogan podcast right after that and then Brett Weinstein got demonetized.

01:33:11.447 --> 01:33:16.892
And then we saw Bobby Malone in Rome, Italy doing the first international COVID summit.

01:33:19.514 --> 01:33:21.355
Stephen Hatfield was there with him, I think.

01:33:22.857 --> 01:33:28.742
And his former friend from Inovio and somewhere else, that Patterson dude was there.

01:33:32.714 --> 01:33:34.855
Then we had International COVID Summit No.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:41.176
2 in France that Bobby Malone coordinated, that I think also Jessica Rose and Meryl Nass were at, but you can check, maybe it was Pierre Cory.

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:46.958
And then we had International COVID Summit No.

01:33:46.978 --> 01:33:53.080
3 in 2023 in Brussels with Bobby Malone in front of the EU Parliament, or at least a room that looked like that.

01:33:54.855 --> 01:34:12.128
Then we had, interestingly, Romania in November of 2023, again with Bobby Malone, this time with Brett Weinstein and Jessica Rose and Denny Rancourt and Nick Hudson and Meryl Nass and Stephen Hadfield all posing for a picture.

01:34:14.089 --> 01:34:17.512
Then they had an international COVID summit number five at CPAC.

01:34:18.615 --> 01:34:19.796
in Washington, D.C.

01:34:20.016 --> 01:34:30.382
in early 2024 in February, then they had international COVID number six in Japan with Bobby Malone on stage still with Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose.

01:34:32.423 --> 01:34:34.004
This is the health freedom movement.

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:36.865
This is what they've accomplished over the last five years.

01:34:37.385 --> 01:34:39.347
These are the people that are saving us.

01:34:43.029 --> 01:34:43.589
These people.

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:53.296
that don't usefully oppose the people here, they don't usefully oppose the people up there, they don't usefully oppose the people over there.

01:34:53.376 --> 01:35:00.878
All these people agree that Jay is worth arguing about, that Jay is worth discrediting, that Jay is worth firing, that Jay is worth ignoring.

01:35:02.878 --> 01:35:12.621
Even the current nomination for the Health and Human Services Secretary in the United States of America, who paid me for a year, ignores me now.

01:35:13.982 --> 01:35:33.697
Even the guy that I've met three times over the last three years at broken science meetings, Jay Bhattacharya, and taking pictures with him because he wants to, nominated for the head of NIH, he also ignores me because he says that he's not sophisticated enough to evaluate my biology.

01:35:36.279 --> 01:35:38.301
And I should stop talking about Robert Malone.

01:35:39.349 --> 01:35:41.790
Maybe we should drop a few more time points in, you know?

01:35:42.310 --> 01:35:57.277
Maybe we should drop in my CHD time there in blue, my first speaking out as a faculty member, and then there's the Corman-Jorston report, and then here's when Kevin McKernan was on my stream, and then there's all the international COVID summits, right?

01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:16.588
We could drop in a little line here, that little dotted line there was when in January of 2023, Sasha Latipova and Meryl Ness and Robert Malone and Michael Palmer and Aseem Malhotra were all on stage in Sweden telling us it was a psi war that we would never figure out.

01:36:17.789 --> 01:36:19.851
And that it was the US military that was doing it.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:37.748
We could add the three times that Sasha Latapova, the mother of Soph, was on the Defender podcast, or a CHD podcast, or who knows what with the American Thought Leaders of the Epoch Times podcast, but we'll just put those three from CHD on there.

01:36:38.148 --> 01:36:45.889
And then we'll put some lines over here for the two times that her daughter, Soph, was promoted on Alex Jones in 2019.

01:36:45.929 --> 01:36:48.270
It might've been three times, but let's be conservative here.

01:36:50.353 --> 01:37:03.845
Let's put one more line in here in 2021 when she and her daughter went to some gun range and made a stupid video about using Discord groups to recruit people to shoot Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

01:37:03.885 --> 01:37:07.167
Let's just ignore that because, you know, she's 19 here, so she's an adult.

01:37:07.207 --> 01:37:08.368
She can do whatever we want to.

01:37:08.769 --> 01:37:17.076
But Soph, before the pandemic, wasn't an adult when she was doing the videos that were promoted with Laura Loomer.

01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:40.375
So we could put another line here for when, maybe when Steve Bannon was on his war room with Stephen Hatfield talking about a lab leak, or that line could also represent when Michael Callahan called Robert Malone from Wuhan to tell him that something was happening.

01:37:40.415 --> 01:37:46.660
And that could also be the time when Whitney Webb publishes her article about the man in Wuhan

01:37:49.517 --> 01:37:58.739
And so the health freedom movement is based on this timeline that we could keep going until the, until I'm blue in the face, adding points where you're like, wait, what they did, what, when, what?

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:06.721
This is only with like two characters and like one, you know, COVID summit series.

01:38:06.861 --> 01:38:12.823
We're not talking about all the podcasts and all the appearances and all the travel.

01:38:14.301 --> 01:38:30.589
and all the ridiculous repetition that occurred over these five years where they never made any useful progress in any direction even though supposedly they knew that the vaccine schedule was a problem back in 2015 when none other than Mary Holland was featured on Democracy Now!

01:38:31.349 --> 01:38:35.591
to say that some component of the MMR vaccine probably injured her kid.

01:38:38.752 --> 01:38:43.113
That health freedom movement in 2015 also produced James Lyons Wyler.

01:38:43.573 --> 01:38:45.174
It also produced the movie Vaxxed.

01:38:45.274 --> 01:38:47.774
It also eventually produced CHD and ICANN.

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:52.996
And none of those people at the beginning of the pandemic said that we knew this was shit before.

01:38:53.536 --> 01:38:56.757
And so they're probably lying about a pandemic now to cover that up.

01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:57.997
They didn't.

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:08.583
10 years later, six years into a pandemic with all this track record, we have a freedom movement called MAHA.

01:39:10.943 --> 01:39:25.668
January 10th, 2025, a freedom movement called MAHA that ignores the gigaohm biological high resistance low noise information brief and focuses on processed foods, fluoride in the water, corn syrup.

01:39:26.974 --> 01:39:28.516
dies, you know, that kind of thing.

01:39:28.936 --> 01:39:30.638
Not worried about GMO, anything.

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:32.599
Not worried about glyphosate, anything.

01:39:32.659 --> 01:39:35.983
Not worried about the sale of medical remnants, the generation of them.

01:39:39.886 --> 01:39:40.207
Nothing.

01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:51.117
I would like you to compare my track record, compare my record of integrity, and compare my ability to summarize what happened on one slide.

01:39:52.739 --> 01:39:59.343
where a background was misconstrued as spread with non-specific PCR tests and the planting of a sequence if necessary.

01:40:02.645 --> 01:40:04.906
And the way to see through it is RNA cannot pandemic.

01:40:05.607 --> 01:40:12.911
Intramuscular injection is dumb and doctors, you should be so ashamed of yourself for not having thought of this already when you just started your practice.

01:40:14.591 --> 01:40:23.074
transfecting healthy people is a crime and any academic biologist that uses transfection or transformation on their bench should be ashamed of themselves.

01:40:25.015 --> 01:40:36.960
If you lost your mom or your dad during COVID because they had a stroke after they had a vaccine, you should be ashamed of yourself because you killed them or at least you allowed the state to manage that problem.

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:37.840
What is that problem?

01:40:39.315 --> 01:40:42.238
None of these in the people in the health freedom movement are gonna talk about it.

01:40:42.298 --> 01:40:47.283
This is the cartoon that Robert Malone promoted today in his Friday funnies.

01:40:48.365 --> 01:40:51.387
I'm just not ready to accept that everything I believed was a lie.

01:40:51.447 --> 01:40:52.788
Can't you see the PSYOP there?

01:40:53.168 --> 01:41:14.200
If he's the liar, if he's covering up for the shell game of intellectual property recycling, if he's covering up for the shell game of the billions of dollars made on testing, if he's covering up for the shell game of the generation of remnants that can be used to fill in the gaps of this human genome project, or maybe even to start it in earnest finally because we have the computing power to do it,

01:41:15.658 --> 01:41:37.741
computing storage base to store it compare my record with theirs and compare my my description of why this signal is important to their complete absence of even naming this signal only visible on population pyramids that no one ever shows there was a bump

01:41:39.451 --> 01:41:45.895
The cost of managing these retired old people, especially in unhealthy America was going to skyrocket.

01:41:46.015 --> 01:41:50.738
And people like Ted Turner have seen this coming for two decades or more.

01:41:52.839 --> 01:41:55.200
And that's why they were able to predict the pandemic.

01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.501
That's why they knew it was coming.

01:41:56.541 --> 01:42:01.224
That's why they all stuck to the narrative because all these countries had a problem to manage.

01:42:01.264 --> 01:42:06.347
They all had a vested interest in managing it to avoid bankruptcy.

01:42:08.447 --> 01:42:10.328
That's why the health freedom movement won't say it.

01:42:10.348 --> 01:42:18.351
That's why you can represent their whole accomplishment over the last 15 years with a slide as weak and vapid as this one.

01:42:19.892 --> 01:42:26.835
With a list as short as that one, or a list like the one on my door, rise and resist people over profits, truth over lies, and courage over fear.

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:31.517
That's why we're here.

01:42:33.206 --> 01:42:41.272
and we ignore this, nobody will say it, nobody will critique it, nobody's gonna touch this with a 10-foot pole because if they did, they'd have to admit that they could have been here in 2020.

01:42:41.713 --> 01:42:55.183
We could have been here in the beginning of 2021 and saved all the college kids from this and we wouldn't be a split, fractured society, but we would be united under a flag and under the concept that we are being undermined by traitors.

01:42:57.657 --> 01:43:02.479
You know what I find extraordinary about that dune scene that I showed you again.

01:43:02.499 --> 01:43:06.061
And I wanted to show it again because I want to make sure I make this point very well.

01:43:06.541 --> 01:43:10.283
And so I'm just going to bring it up again and play the same scene again.

01:43:12.664 --> 01:43:13.685
Remember what this is.

01:43:13.745 --> 01:43:19.788
This is Paul walking into a giant temple outside of the temple.

01:43:22.242 --> 01:43:29.966
are thousands, there's a sandworm that's exploding out of the ground behind him because he likes him.

01:43:31.868 --> 01:43:46.356
And there are thousands of people standing outside of this very ancient temple, this multi-generationally old temple of this ancient faith that believes that someday from the outer world, some Messiah will come that will have magical powers to be able to see the future.

01:43:47.648 --> 01:43:54.431
and return green trees and water to an otherwise dead desert planet.

01:43:56.391 --> 01:44:07.296
These people are so fanatic that they gather in groups this size and have traveled across desert storms, risked their lives on the back of giant sandworms to get to this giant meeting.

01:44:07.956 --> 01:44:10.137
And there are so many people at this giant meeting.

01:44:11.015 --> 01:44:19.921
that there's a shit ton of people outside that can't even come into the giant cave where the witch mom and her colleagues are presiding over prayer.

01:44:22.363 --> 01:44:26.366
Thousands of people are praying inside of this cave.

01:44:26.466 --> 01:44:26.826
See it?

01:44:27.046 --> 01:44:27.867
Thousands.

01:44:30.689 --> 01:44:34.631
And now this girl, sorry, I have to go back.

01:44:35.092 --> 01:44:35.372
Darn it.

01:44:36.633 --> 01:44:39.316
Let me get my head out of the way for just a second, please.

01:44:40.277 --> 01:44:41.038
And here.

01:44:45.182 --> 01:44:46.503
I'm making a point, promise.

01:44:46.543 --> 01:44:47.825
I promise I'm making a point.

01:44:56.294 --> 01:44:58.336
So they're praying, and it's a lot of them.

01:44:59.741 --> 01:45:01.422
And now this girl breaks the circle.

01:45:01.482 --> 01:45:10.226
Now, this is significant because again, the high priest is going to explain that if you want to speak inside of this circle, you know what to do.

01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:16.009
And what to do is that you have to kill this guy, your tribe leader, in order to speak in the circle.

01:45:16.069 --> 01:45:19.671
Now, she could have spoke outside the circle and tried to get his attention, but she didn't.

01:45:21.211 --> 01:45:22.152
Because they're just praying.

01:45:22.892 --> 01:45:28.335
But she went inside the circle, violated, she's supposed to kill him in order to talk to him, but she didn't.

01:45:29.434 --> 01:45:33.376
And now after explaining that to him, now remember what I'm trying to say here.

01:45:33.996 --> 01:45:54.524
Thousands of people that believe that a Messiah might come, thousands of warriors that fight to the death for honor, and have believed this their whole life, have now assembled under the possibility that, hey, his mom became our head lady, and he drank the

01:45:56.094 --> 01:45:57.696
the water of life and he didn't die.

01:45:57.776 --> 01:45:59.538
So something really strange is happening.

01:45:59.558 --> 01:46:04.503
So that thousands, hundreds of thousands of them have come to see what's going on here.

01:46:05.344 --> 01:46:10.610
And now she violates a cardinal rule that supposedly requires murder and nobody does anything about it.

01:46:11.051 --> 01:46:14.515
And then later in this scene, she's going to stand up and she's going to scream.

01:46:15.236 --> 01:46:15.977
What does she scream?

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:29.846
This prophecy is how they enslave us, how they dominate.

01:46:31.268 --> 01:46:33.511
This prophecy is how they enslave us.

01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:38.279
Now, my question is, how committed are these people really to what they believe?

01:46:40.839 --> 01:47:03.217
I want you to do the thought experiment that if this was a Muslim gathering and they thought that Muhammad had come back and that the Quran says that Muhammad's gonna come back and now some guy has fulfilled all of the requirements of coming back and they're all traveled all around the world to go to Saudi Arabia to meet him and now some random chick stands up and said that this is all bullshit.

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:06.180
This prophecy is how they enslave you.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.422
Do you don't think somebody would kill her or stone her or

01:47:11.058 --> 01:47:20.520
And now afterward, of course, Paul's going to walk in and he's going to convince the entire room to drop to their knees that he is actually their savior.

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:22.440
And still they don't kill her.

01:47:23.761 --> 01:47:24.561
They don't even care.

01:47:25.421 --> 01:47:39.484
You would think if any of them were doubting their fanaticism and doubting their faith after that happened, after that first warrior goes, and he goes down and then everybody kneels down and then the priest says something and he says something and then everybody goes down.

01:47:42.023 --> 01:47:48.210
I want you to do a thought experiment for a second, ladies and gentlemen, because this is the point that I want to make, and it is a very important point.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:49.471
Okay?

01:47:53.335 --> 01:47:59.061
It's a very important point, and it's going to hit hard in a way that I think we need to be hitting right now.

01:48:01.024 --> 01:48:17.754
If the Health Freedom Movement and the Maha Movement and the People on X and all these patriots and everybody else thinks that the fires in Canada or the fires in California or the fires in Maui are being purposefully set by directed energy weapons,

01:48:18.857 --> 01:48:38.295
If these people really believe that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed by directed energy weapons, if they really think that HAARP is being used to generate hurricanes that are displacing hundreds of thousands of people or thousands of people in the Appalachian Mountains in order to gain access to minerals,

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:51.186
If you think that the United States government is flooding our streets with migrants in order to destroy our country, then at what point are you gonna do something other than tweet?

01:48:53.988 --> 01:49:04.314
At what point are you gonna require some of these people with this unimaginably large reach on social media start speaking the truth of the destruction of our country?

01:49:08.001 --> 01:49:13.722
You actually think that they're using directed energy weapons to destroy LA, to destroy Maui?

01:49:13.742 --> 01:49:16.723
You actually think that they're using HAARP to direct the winds?

01:49:18.143 --> 01:49:21.984
To direct the rain currents, but you're not willing to do anything other than tweet?

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:27.486
And subscribe to Malone's substack?

01:49:29.106 --> 01:49:31.026
And pay for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:49:31.006 --> 01:49:33.147
's presidential campaign security?

01:49:35.427 --> 01:49:45.270
instead of paying attention to somebody who worked for them and was fired by them and has told you what they're lying about and tried desperately to teach you how to fight back.

01:49:47.931 --> 01:49:49.391
That's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49:49.431 --> 01:49:54.653
I can summarize it in one slide plus one little video with the population pyramid.

01:49:54.693 --> 01:50:01.135
I can say it very succinctly and these people will not, will not acknowledge it because it is their job

01:50:02.233 --> 01:50:04.454
Maybe I'm the reason why a lot of them have a job.

01:50:04.475 --> 01:50:07.296
And in that case, please share my work.

01:50:07.937 --> 01:50:09.718
Please subscribe.

01:50:09.778 --> 01:50:12.140
Please find a way to support my stream.

01:50:13.541 --> 01:50:15.742
Social media, this is how it's done, ladies and gentlemen.

01:50:15.762 --> 01:50:16.943
It's a very lively debate.

01:50:17.603 --> 01:50:18.764
It is curated by them.

01:50:19.564 --> 01:50:25.548
And as long as you think that tweeting is gonna save the world or the next substack you write is gonna save the world, you're probably wrong.

01:50:26.269 --> 01:50:28.931
We gotta save the world one young person at a time.

01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:32.491
one neighbor at a time, one family member at a time.

01:50:33.471 --> 01:50:40.095
Anybody that's willing to listen, send them to this stream and let's start breaking the narrative as fast as we can.

01:50:40.135 --> 01:50:41.276
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:50:41.316 --> 01:50:48.280
I will see you again sometime over the weekend, although I'm not sure when because we do have two games this weekend and so it's a busy one.

01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.381
Thanks very much.

01:50:49.481 --> 01:50:50.481
Happy Friday, everybody.

01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:51.182
See you again soon.
