WEBVTT

01:30.000 --> 01:56.000
You

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
schedule for 16 minutes next.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
It's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
It's embarrassing.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, I can't thank you kids enough.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Shaggy should get most of the credit.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Where is Shaggy?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, no, not again.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
It looks like Shaggy wants to try it for the eight-man role in the picture.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Arise!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
But there's Scooby doing the other chair.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Surprise!

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
It's the Scooby hat the eight-band was wearing.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Now, there's real talent.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
We sure fooled him, Scooby. We ought to be in the movies.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Spare!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Show me where we go!

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Would you understand to join the city of the eight?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Yes.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yes.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Two days ago, one-time state of the eight?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Would you understand to join the city of the eight?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yes.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yes.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Two days ago, one-time state of the eight?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Welcome to Giga home biological entire resistance.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.760
I resisted slow noise information.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.240
We brought to you by a raspy voice biologist.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.700
It's the 14th of October, 2023.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.480
The bottom of the holy weapon.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
Peace.

04:01.480 --> 04:11.480
The bottom of the holy weapon.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.480
Peace.

05:01.480 --> 05:31.000
A little slow there on the, on the draw.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I apologize for that cut.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah, so I got a pretty sore throat, some sore ears.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not really sure where that came from, but I'm not going to talk very much tonight.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
He's not very loud.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm not going to get very angry.

05:48.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm trying to give my voice a little bit of a rest.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
My blower is still on back there.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
So I'm not sure how long that's going to run, but I'll just leave it there for now.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
If it gets annoying after a while, I can take it down.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Don't take the bait on TV and social media, of course.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
We're still trying to solve this mystery of Scooby-Doo.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Looks like this one's a little bit out of alignment or something here.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Need to move it.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, see, it was just one out.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
There we go.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, we're still getting tricked into solving this mystery tonight.

06:34.000 --> 06:44.000
I've got a couple of interesting examples of, I guess, surprisingly on point Scooby-Doo plays.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Things in people that I didn't think would do it, and it's so late in the game.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
If my throat felt better, I was going to watch a movie, an interview rather with Jessica Rose

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
on Amadmalaik's podcast.

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
It's exceptionally interesting, but I don't have the endurance for it tonight.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So I will skip that tonight.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Why did that stop there?

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
So we're still trying to get through this illusion that's been created by all these people on the Internet

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
and annoying.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
They definitely are.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But nonetheless, this is where we are.

07:24.000 --> 07:38.000
They've created this illusion, and the illusion has been done so well that the almost entire planet has been tricked into solving a mystery that we never needed to solve.

07:38.000 --> 07:52.000
But in being tricked and accepting the challenge of solving the mystery, we've also accepted the mystery's premises, which are that there's a novel virus that everybody was vulnerable to.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
That we had to do something, including lockdown masks and vaccines.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
And if the vaccines wouldn't have been rushed, they would be spectacular.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
But they saved 20 million lives already.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
And there's definitely going to be another one of these because gain of function is real.

08:12.000 --> 08:23.000
And so by solving the Scooby-Doo mystery that all these people, including myself, tricked ourselves into solving, we have accepted those premises of the faith.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
And until very recently, I was under the same spell that everybody else was under.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
And now I'm desperately trying to wake people up as you are to this illusion.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
And it's an illusion of consensus that all these people agree on something.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
And what do they agree on?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
They don't even actually say it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That's the crazy part.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
But you have to solve it.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You have to see what they don't talk about.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You have to see what they avoid talking about.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
And then they all share a pattern.

08:59.000 --> 09:15.000
And so in trying to penetrate this illusion of consensus, we've identified people like Mick Hudson and Peter McCullough that have either been consistent or even in their inconsistencies have been aiming toward the truth.

09:15.000 --> 09:28.000
And it's been very hard to find people that have gotten to the stage where they can freely admit that, you know, maybe intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system on behalf of the immune system.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
On behalf of the CDC in America is pretty dumb.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
Taking advice from the CDC about how to augment your immune system is probably pretty dumb.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.000
And I assure you, transfection is not immunization.

09:46.000 --> 09:55.000
And so we've been talking a lot about it not being a matter of what's true, but what's perceived to be true.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.000
And yesterday I queued in on this idea of, you know, a tunnel on a screen. There goes the blower.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh, no, I can finally hear again.

10:07.000 --> 10:24.000
If we if we think about this as an illusion, then these people back here have essentially helped in creating an illusion very much like a tunnel but a tunnel in time and space.

10:24.000 --> 10:35.000
And experience that was on our TVs, in our social media feeds and on our telephones, on our iPads.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
And not much different than the thing that we were just watching here.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Except what streaming past you are Facebook posts.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
And an illusion of consensus which led us to believe that, okay, we got to keep walking this way, watch out for that. Look out.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Here we go. Stay behind Robert Malone. He's a smart guy.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
Listen to Tony Fauci. He knows what he's been there for 38 years. He's got to know what's going on.

11:05.000 --> 11:16.000
And it doesn't matter what side of the ball you were on, you were being led by someone down this imaginary tunnel and told not to look too closely at the walls.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Don't bother to check. Trust us. Just keep going.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
And it's this spectacular that there is something about this injection.

11:27.000 --> 11:43.000
This spectacular commitment to lies that we've got a break. Now, Daniel Nagasi is a really interesting fellow because I believe he has been on Kevin McCarran's show before.

11:43.000 --> 11:52.000
He was very early out in Canada speaking out about these shots.

11:52.000 --> 12:01.000
But when I tried to contact him, he basically accused me of being a no virus guy when I said there wasn't any spread.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
And later on, he kind of backpedaled a little bit after I tried to explain who I was and what I really meant.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
But he didn't want to waste his time coming on Gigome and didn't really want to talk to me anymore.

12:14.000 --> 12:27.000
Now, I find him an interesting and puzzling guy because when I first saw him on the Internet, I thought we were basically the same dude, one in Canada and one in Pittsburgh.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
But then after not being able to get in touch with him at all, like with repeated.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
After that was cleared up again, we weren't communicating anymore.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
But now I saw this video where he had testified with what's his name?

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
But this thing over in Europe, I've also testified for them.

12:50.000 --> 13:11.000
And he made a very interesting set of comments about the contents of the shot related to graphene, which as far as I know, Kevin McCarran, that was one of the things on his list from the very, very beginning, was there is no 5G in the virus and there's no 5G in the shot

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
and there's no graphene in the shot and even looked at it under the microscope to prove to everybody that there was no graphene or hydras.

13:20.000 --> 13:35.000
And so I find it very interesting and I wonder if Daniel and Kevin McCarran will get together and talk again about this, this new idea or revelation in Daniel Legassi's mind. Listen carefully.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
That is vitally important to their agenda.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
They have to take away bodily autonomy.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
So I don't know.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
It makes me think that there is something about this injection that is vitally important to their agenda.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
They have to take away bodily autonomy.

13:56.000 --> 14:04.000
So I don't know what's in the injection, but you know, if you have self polymerizing carbon fiber, that can act as an antenna.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Graphene has electrical properties.

14:07.000 --> 14:18.000
And then I have to question why there's all these purple streetlights showing up at important intersections all over Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton.

14:18.000 --> 14:27.000
And you also have these purple ultraviolet streetlights on all the major highways at the choke points between the border of Alberta and BC.

14:28.000 --> 14:47.000
Now, the only thing I can say about the purple streetlight is back from the 90s when I was doing cell biology is if you wanted to check to see whether a gene was successfully spliced into a bacteria or a yeast, you could use ultraviolet light to see whether the gene splicing occurred.

14:47.000 --> 14:59.000
So the big question in my mind is, are these purple streetlights being put up at certain intervals throughout the city to create 15 minute zone.

14:59.000 --> 15:10.000
And then if you try and cross the border within a city that they will be able to verify your vaccine status using the ultraviolet light.

15:11.000 --> 15:22.000
Now, that being said, it's pretty hard because skin has a lot of keratin, right? So the blood flow doesn't go very close to the skin. So it would be very difficult to detect fluorescence on skin.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
But I'm sure everyone's aware that when it's dark, you can see cat's eyes glow in the dark.

15:29.000 --> 15:43.000
And that's because the cat eye collects enough light, even very ambient light when they even when it seems dark to us that it can reflect that light outward human eyes are similar, just not as effective as cat eyes.

15:43.000 --> 15:58.000
So again, if you have a block where it's dark, because the only streetlights are ultraviolet and someone's walking down the street, you probably will be able to detect whether or not they have a fluorescent protein, because it would be circulating

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
in the circulation of the retina at the back of the eye.

16:02.000 --> 16:11.000
So I don't know what resolution of video camera you need, a 4K or an 8K with a night enhancement version.

16:11.000 --> 16:20.000
But I suspect you might be able to see through the reflection, you know, the red eye that you sometimes get when you have a camera flash.

16:21.000 --> 16:35.000
A variation of that might be able to detect if people have been vaccinated or genetically altered at every intersection in a city.

16:35.000 --> 16:48.000
So that's a pretty weird turn right I mean, I'm not going to speculate on whether or not these technologies could exist or can exist I think you need an awful lot of fluorescent protein and circulation to be able to detect it in your eye.

16:49.000 --> 16:58.000
I don't think he exactly explained the way a cat eyes reflectivity works.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
It's a strange thing.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And that discussion is longer.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But the point is, is that where are we going?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
We're still going toward confusion.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
He's not questioning the narrative.

17:10.000 --> 17:22.000
He's not questioning the main faith, which is that there was a novel virus that got released and ran around the world and we had to do something and the mRNA did a lot but it could have been better because we rushed it.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
It's going to come again because this was gain of function.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
And that's what we really should be questioning right now.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.000
And if we're not, I think we're playing games and so it's really to me.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
I think we got to be very careful at this stage not to be distracted.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
And again, you know, directed back into the cave.

17:49.000 --> 17:56.000
We got to keep looking for the exit.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
I think we're in the middle of an ongoing crime.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I've no idea how long it's going to last.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
I think it's, I'm convinced that it will be the biggest crime in history.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
It's global.

18:07.000 --> 18:15.000
It has the intent of control, removing everybody's freedom and I personally think will involve killing for the millions, if not billions of people.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
That makes it a pretty big competitive for the title worst crime in history.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It is long plans.

18:21.000 --> 18:35.000
I won't bore you with the details, but I've definitely come across information that shows that the components of the receipts that they've used, you know, PCR, exaggerated PCR testing, the use of fear based messaging through the media.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
This stuff's been rehearsed by militaries and the people we might think of as the spooks for at least 25 years and possibly longer.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
So it's long plan. Very serious.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Here's the thing why I'm calling you to arm.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
It's not going to return to the old normal one.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
That's never their intention.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
So it's not going to happen passively because it's not risen to an actual phenomenon that's going to wear off.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
They're not going to allow it to return to normal.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
So if you comply with this tyranny, it will end with the loss of your liberty and probably your life.

19:07.000 --> 19:15.000
The supply chains that move materials, raw materials and finished goods around the world are being sworn through on a global scale.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
You only got to look at where the shipping is where it should be and where it actually is.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
And terrifyingly, the same is happening to food production worldwide food and fertiliser production.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
It's in the wrong place.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
It's deliberate.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
They're smashing the means of manufacturing enough calories to keep 7.8 billion people alive.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And where do you think that's going to end?

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
Well, the answer is mass starvation or a global migration.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
That's what's going to happen if you and everybody else choose to do nothing at all.

19:48.000 --> 20:00.000
Also, economic instruction, we can see happening around us, interest rates will rise on the back of huge debts that will just cause mass bankruptcies, rolling recessions, depressions, things like that.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
And I would also imagine loss of confidence in the very thing called money.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
So any savings you've got, I think they'll just vanish.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Literally, people will just say, I no longer trust sterling.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't want to accept it.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And so all your savings are worth nothing.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
So if you wait, I believe it will be too late.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
I think you already know that I'm broadly telling you something that's closer to the reality than what government's telling me.

20:24.000 --> 20:37.000
But I believe that we can head off the worst crimes in history by actively withdrawing our consent and definitely not accepting these digital ID for any reason, any reason.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
If you accept it, they will sweep over us.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
And so just the last few words, I implore you to get involved to use some of what I and others are saying to you.

20:47.000 --> 20:56.000
Be brave, actually, you have to be brave now and risk embarrassment and recruit other people to this cause, and we can roll them over.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Yes, I believe this is true.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I've got two short videos to watch.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
One is a secret pocket from the World Council of Health.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
And one is a comedy video called the spy who poisoned me.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
And you might remember this lady from another semi viral video that she did about masks and lockdowns and other stuff.

21:19.000 --> 21:26.000
I actually think this might be a clue over here, this spilled vase.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
I'm just saying, I don't know if I trust this person, but let's listen to secret first and then we'll end with that lady.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
And then I'll take a early evening.

21:39.000 --> 21:50.000
Our next speaker tonight is one of my personal heroes of this time of this time.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
A shining light in this time of darkness professor.

21:56.000 --> 22:05.000
A specialist in microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology professor emeritus of the Johannes Gutenberg University in mines.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Head of the Institute for medical microbiology and hygiene there from 1991 to 2012.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
And he's a founder and chairman of the M and WTFD, a society of physicians and scientists for health.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
Freedom and democracy is an association of physicians and other medically active persons with scientists.

22:23.000 --> 22:32.000
We're engaged in research and teaching on the topics of health, freedom and democracy in order to serve the health and social welfare of the population.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
Of course, we could add a lot more to this biography here, but I'll hand it over to you.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
Welcome, professor, please go ahead and you're listening to your words.

22:44.000 --> 22:55.000
Thank you. Well, I was asked to take a break from top science and talk to you in lay language about the,

22:55.000 --> 23:02.000
if you an overview about the dangers, can vaccine dating, contamination, all to algae.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
No man promotes cannabis, that's the topic to go for.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
So any school child, 14 year old will understand, and this is what I'm going to try to do in 10 minutes.

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
Now, the genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in the cell packaged in chromosomes, the books of life, that are safeguarded in the cell nucleus.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
When a recipe for a product, let's say a cake is required.

23:26.000 --> 23:34.000
The book is opened at the right page and a copy of the recipe is made that is sent to the manufacturing site, the bakery, in the cell.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
The cake and tasty bits thereof are placed for inspection on the windowsill of the cell.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
Having fulfilled its purpose, the copied recipe, mRNA, is disposed of.

23:46.000 --> 23:56.000
RNA vaccines are such short lived copies of chromosomal recipes that direct the production of selected pathogens, like the spike protein.

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
More than 1 billion copies are administered with each injection into the human body.

24:01.000 --> 24:07.000
Mass production of mRNA requires mass ability of the DNA templates.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
How can this be achieved?

24:09.000 --> 24:19.000
You have just heard that this is done because the billions and trillions of copies of the DNA recipes are derived.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
So did you already catch it?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
Or did you miss it?

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Because he's trying to get everything into 10 minutes. He's doing it really fast.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
He says the DNA is all the code of your life is stored in the nucleus.

24:34.000 --> 24:45.000
If you need anything out of that code, part of the code that contains the recipe that you need is translated into RNA and shipped to the bakery.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
The RNA is a very short lived message.

24:49.000 --> 25:02.000
Then he transitioned right away to say that these mRNA vaccines are very short lived messages. Listen carefully.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
You've got to hear everything. You've got to listen to everything to know the message.

25:07.000 --> 25:14.000
Any school child, 14-year-old, will understand, and this is what I'm going to try to do in 10 minutes.

25:14.000 --> 25:23.000
Now the genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in itself, packaged in chromosomes, the books of life, that are safeguarded in the cell nucleus.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
When a recipe for a product, let's say a cake is required.

25:27.000 --> 25:35.000
The book is opened at the right page and a copy of the recipe is made that is sent to the manufacturing site, the bakery, in the cell.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
The cake and tasty bits thereof are placed for inspection on the windowsill of the cell.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Having fulfilled its purpose, the copied...

25:43.000 --> 25:52.000
That was nice. The tasty bits of the cake are displayed on the windowsill of the cell. That's like an MHC presentation. That's very clever.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
So great.

25:53.000 --> 26:06.000
The recipe, mRNA, is disposed of. RNA vaccines are such short-lived copies of chromosomal recipes that direct the production of selected antigens, like the spike protein.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Did you hear the words he chose? That was terrible.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
mRNA vaccines are short copies of chromosomal what?

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
Holy cow. Listen to that.

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
I'll lose my voice tonight. I didn't even hear this yet. I'm a little shocked. Come on, Sucre. You can do better than this.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
Acry in the cell. The cake and tasty bits thereof are placed for inspection on the windowsill of the cell.

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
Having fulfilled its purpose, the copied recipe, mRNA, is disposed of.

26:42.000 --> 26:52.000
RNA vaccines are such short-lived copies of chromosomal recipes that direct the production of selected antigens, like the spike protein.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
More than 1 billion copies are administered with each injection into the human body.

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
Mass production of mRNA requires mass availability of the DNA templates. How can this be achieved?

27:05.000 --> 27:15.000
You have just heard that this is done because the billions and trillions of copies of the DNA recipes are derived from bacteria.

27:15.000 --> 27:25.000
The recipes are contained in minute bacterial chromosomes that attract plasmids. Plasmids are easily manipulated.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
Foreign recipes, like the genes encoding for viral proteins, can be inserted.

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
Following bacterial multiplication, the plasmids are harvested and used as templates for production of the RNA copies.

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
The RNA molecules are then packaged into tiny fatty globules termed lipid nanoparticles.

27:46.000 --> 27:55.000
The packaging material is essential to protect RNA from destruction so that it can travel in the bloodstream to reach all organs of the body.

27:55.000 --> 28:09.000
There, the lipid nanoparticles act as Trojan horses. They are taken up by cells, their cargo is released within, and the recipes direct production of the gene product that is displayed on the windowsill.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
What everyone simply must know is that outside the cell, security guards.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
So it's displayed on the windowsill, he said again, but it's not the same.

28:21.000 --> 28:32.000
It's not the same as being displayed on MHC1. This is actually expressed on the outside of the cell, which again, with regard to normal RNA, is not the case.

28:32.000 --> 28:50.000
Normal RNA, you might make RNA for an ion channel, and then if the cell reports that protein expression, it's going to report a cell antigen taken from that and displayed on MHC1.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
It doesn't have to go to the cell service.

28:55.000 --> 29:12.000
There's some strange imprecision here, maybe just because he's trying really hard to get this all into one paragraph, and he's reading it, but there's some pretty big mistakes or at least some pretty large examples of imprecision.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm not darn it.

29:15.000 --> 29:23.000
But on the watch, all is well, when a cake is produced according to a recipe originating from one's own book of life.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
You don't need to get angry.

29:26.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm not saying he's a bad guy. I learned all my terminology about the shots and the way that they work from the perspective of the good way, the cartoon way from him.

29:38.000 --> 29:57.000
He's saying that now he's got the opportunity to tell everybody everything about the shot, and unfortunately he's been distracted into believing that the DNA contamination is somehow thousands of times worse than the transfection ever was.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And I think that's a mistake.

30:00.000 --> 30:07.000
It might be bad. It might be very bad, but transfection was very bad.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
And so to add this on top is what he should do.

30:11.000 --> 30:23.000
He should explain the biology of transfection and why it's bad, and then say, and in order to make this for everybody, we made it even worse.

30:23.000 --> 30:41.000
That's the point. And you can't read something like this and read it really fast in a language that's not your first tongue and put sarcasm in there that people are going to get, which he's done a couple times now, which is kind of funny, but it's kind of not because nobody's going to get that.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
Sarcasm in second language is not, you know, it's not the most universal thing.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
You need to chill out. I'm such a flog.

30:56.000 --> 31:06.000
You're just having trouble with the fact that everybody on Earth has been Scooby-Dooed, and there aren't very many people who can see it.

31:06.000 --> 31:14.000
Even me and him, when we were on the same page in 2020, we're Scooby-Dooed.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
Because we still believed in a virus that flew around the world and he does too.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
And that's what we've got to be careful of. That's what this is about.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
And if we're going to do it, we've got to be precise about this, and we can't say that the RNA vaccines are short-lived.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Are they short-lived?

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
Sucred Bakti knows that they're not short-lived. He did journal clubs on those papers.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So then why is he saying it?

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
Why is he calling RNA vaccines short-lived chromosomal recipes?

31:54.000 --> 32:06.000
We're going to get out of this. We can't keep making mistakes like this, where people like Debunk the Funk can use this video against him.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
And other people will say, well, Debunk the Funk kind of knows what he's talking about because that jives with it I know.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
Get a grip. I'm not doing this for ego.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
I'd rather be upstairs watching Rocky with my kids.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
But I think that this is for them too. This is really important.

32:32.000 --> 32:40.000
We are about to drop the ball here. We're at the goal line, you know, and it's like third in goal. We got one more mistake.

32:40.000 --> 32:54.000
One genome, but whoa, if the recipe originates from an alien book, then the security guards, our immune system, will leap into action and attack that cell.

32:55.000 --> 33:04.000
The capacity of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cells that manufacture non-self is given at birth and ends at death.

33:05.000 --> 33:15.000
Reflect on transplant rejection. You get my kidney, you reject my kidney. Non-self is not tolerated even within the same species of humans.

33:16.000 --> 33:26.000
And if after first failure, a repeat attempt is made, you get my second kidney, an explosive rejection followers, fast and furious.

33:27.000 --> 33:36.000
The same principle underlies the ever-increasing intensity of adverse events following in the wake of booster RNA injections.

33:37.000 --> 33:51.000
The numbers of packaged RNA coffees administered with each injection are gigantic, myriad immune attack events will erupt throughout the body that can only hold when production of the alien protein comes to an end.

33:51.000 --> 34:10.000
How long will this take? Just a few days as the vaccine manufacturers, the vaccine perpetrators, and recently the Nobel Prize Committee are not weary to assert an alarming finding surfaced over the past year that was not consolable with that assertion.

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
Spike protein and multi-organ inflammation was detected in vaccine leaves weeks and even months after the injections.

34:20.000 --> 34:34.000
This was associated with severe and often fatal illness. What earthly reason could there have been and could there still be for such disastrous long-lasting production of an RNA encoded protein?

34:35.000 --> 34:44.000
The discovering of contaminating plasmic DNA in the vaccines by Kevin McCurnan and colleagues immediately provides one terrifying explanation.

34:45.000 --> 34:55.000
In the vaccine production process, the plasmic DNA templates must be removed from the generated mRNA before the latter is packaged into the lipid nano.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
So I misunderstood him. So he was saying something here that must have not jive because he said almost everything right. It was really good.

35:04.000 --> 35:12.000
But he must have said something about the long-lived spike protein and not the long-lived RNA.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
And then now he's explaining the long-lived spike protein with the DNA contamination. I got to listen again. I'm sorry. I missed it.

35:20.000 --> 35:30.000
Tell security guards are on the watch. All is well. When a cake is produced according to a recipe originating from one's own book of life, one's own genome.

35:31.000 --> 35:41.000
But whoa, if the recipe originates from an alien book, then the security guards, our immune system, will leap into action and attack that cell.

35:42.000 --> 35:51.000
The capacity of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cells that manufacture non-self is given at birth and ends at death.

35:52.000 --> 36:02.000
Reflect on transplant rejection. You get my kidney, you reject my kidney. Non-self is not tolerated even within the same species of humans.

36:03.000 --> 36:13.000
And if after first failure, a repeat attempt is made, you get my second kidney and explosive rejection followers, fast and furious.

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
The same principle underlies the ever-increasing intensity of adverse events following in the wake of booster RNA injections.

36:24.000 --> 36:38.000
The numbers of packaged RNA copies administered with each injection are gigantic, myriad immune attack events, will erupt throughout the body that can only halt when production of the alien protein comes to an end.

36:39.000 --> 36:50.000
How long will this take? Just a few days as the vaccine manufacturers, the vaccine perpetrators, and recently the Nobel Prize Committee are not weary to assert.

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
An alarming finding surfaced over the past year that was not consilable with that assertion.

36:59.000 --> 37:07.000
Spike protein and multi-organ inflammation was detected in vaccinees weeks and even months after the injections.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
This was associated with severe and often fatal illness. What earthly reason could there have been a assertion?

37:14.000 --> 37:23.000
Spike protein and multi-organ inflammation was detected in vaccinees weeks and even months after the injections.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
So technically he is going to blame that spike protein on the DNA, or at least this is the explanation he's accepting it.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
I'm not saying that he doesn't see the other part, but...

37:36.000 --> 37:49.000
associated with severe and often fatal illness. What earthly reason could there have been and could there still be for such disastrous long-lasting production of an RNA encoded protein?

37:50.000 --> 37:59.000
The discovering of contaminating plasmic DNA in the vaccines by Kevin MacKernan and colleagues immediately provides one terrifying explanation.

38:00.000 --> 38:11.000
In the vaccine production process, the plasmic DNA templates must be removed from the generated mRNA before the latter is packaged into the lipid nanoparticles.

38:12.000 --> 38:24.000
Otherwise, plasmids will also end up in the packages. Kevin MacKernan discovered that this crucial step of removing plasmic DNA had not been assiduously undertaken.

38:25.000 --> 38:39.000
Huge amounts of plasmic DNA were found in packaged form that guaranteed their successful delivery to cells. Kevin's work has been replicated now in other laboratories, several are represented at today's panel.

38:40.000 --> 38:51.000
Cell uptake of whole or fragmented plasmids alters the entire set of DNA instructions and by definition equates with alteration of the genome,

38:52.000 --> 39:06.000
keyed that the nuclear envelope breaks down when the cell divides so that foreign DNA can gain proximity to and become encased with chromosomes in newly formed nuclei of daughter cells.

39:07.000 --> 39:18.000
Whole recipes will cause production of whole products and continued production of any non-cell protein will provoke long-term information and organ damage throughout the body.

39:19.000 --> 39:31.000
Vessel walls will be damaged. Bleeding and blood clot formation are inevitable consequences. Tissues will die for lack of oxygen. The heart is one organ that cannot replace dead cells.

39:32.000 --> 39:40.000
Who has not heard of the mysterious sudden cardiac deaths that are occurring around the world? They are only the tip of an iceberg.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Vaccine induced heart disease has entered the daily agenda of young and old.

39:46.000 --> 39:57.000
The second organ that cannot replace its dead is the brain, depending on where a vaccine damage is done, any neurological and psychiatric affliction may follow.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
In a similar fashion autoimmune diseases can develop simultaneously in different organs.

40:04.000 --> 40:18.000
This multifaceted feature of vaccination induced injury is unique and tellingly illustrated in the tragic case of a 14-year-old child who died of multi-organ inflammation as has never been seen before.

40:20.000 --> 40:31.000
The potential of vaccination to negatively impact on fertility and reproduction is enormous. The vaccines accumulate in the reproductive organs and this could immediately impair fertility.

40:32.000 --> 40:46.000
Uptake of circulating RNA and DNA by cells of the placenta could result in stillbirths. The central damage may also enable the packaged genes to enter the fetal circulation.

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
Indeed it is known that stem cells in umbilical cord blood are reduced and impaired following vaccination.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
And it must be feared that this is because the baby is reached in the mother's womb.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
The flat fat globules with their carol are also known to find their way into breast milk.

41:07.000 --> 41:23.000
That permeability is high during the first weeks after birth and the real possibility exists that breastfeeding will result in direct passage of vaccines into the baby's blood, where suicide mechanisms may be triggered.

41:24.000 --> 41:33.000
Never forget the capacity of the immune system to recognize and destroy cells that produce alien proteins is given at birth.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
The incredible horror story does not end here.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
Packaged DNA fragments have been found en masse as vaccine contaminants.

41:44.000 --> 41:51.000
Once they reach the nucleus, short DNA sequences have an increased propensity to insert into chromosomal DNA.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
The possible consequences are unending.

41:55.000 --> 42:04.000
Disruption of the exquisitely tuned network that controls cell division and differentiation can lead to cancer and to developmental defects.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
Mutations in sperm and fertilized egg cells could render altered traits inheritable.

42:11.000 --> 42:18.000
Cost-effective procedures to reliably separate mass-produced RNA from plasmids do not exist.

42:19.000 --> 42:26.000
Contamination of RNA vaccines with plasmid DNA must therefore be expected to be the rule and not the exception.

42:27.000 --> 42:39.000
Whoever propagates RNA vaccines as being safe and effective, whoever claims that nothing can happen to your genome is either incredibly ignorant or endlessly evil.

42:40.000 --> 42:47.000
That person is turning his back on the horror scenario that is unfolding in front of our very eyes.

42:48.000 --> 42:57.000
Fellow citizens and physicians of the world turn away from the perpetration of this monstrous crime against humanity.

42:57.000 --> 43:10.000
Do this to save yourself, your descendants, do this to rescue the name of your family or go down in history as one of the greatest criminals of all time.

43:11.000 --> 43:25.000
Okay, so I stand a little corrected. He definitely pulled it out of the ditch there, but I still think that in the beginning when he said that RNA vaccines are short-lived chromosomal recipes,

43:26.000 --> 43:37.000
I think he was attempting to be sarcastic and it doesn't come off that way if it's not your first language and it's not going to come off that way for anybody else that's listening to him either.

43:38.000 --> 43:45.000
Even people that speak English as their first language because of him not doing that and vice versa.

43:46.000 --> 43:58.000
So it's a great message. Obviously it's a great message and I really liked how actually the DNA wasn't so central to his explanation.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
It didn't matter. It was worse. It made it worse.

44:03.000 --> 44:12.000
I was anticipating that was going to be a lot worse than it was. So when it started with the bakery and whatever, I was getting really worried at first.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
So that's good. I'm happy. That's great.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
More hope there.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
This one is less hopeful to me. It's a little weird.

44:23.000 --> 44:31.000
She's funny, but it's a little weird and we go full-court press on one particular idea which I need to process still.

44:32.000 --> 44:40.000
It's been nearly four years since the imaginary virus swept the Earth and almost three since the release of its antidote.

44:41.000 --> 44:50.000
A miracle vaccine that utilized a brand new never-before-seen technology with capabilities far beyond our existing antiquated immunizations.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
Its swift release came with a promise that it was completely safe and 95% effective.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Then it would ensure your grandmother's survival and secure your future employment.

45:03.000 --> 45:11.000
It would protect you, not only from the dangerous contagion, but from the even more dangerous social contagion that had taken hold of the mom.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
You would no longer run the risk of being ostracized by your friends or excommunicated by your family.

45:18.000 --> 45:25.000
It would eliminate the risk of being threatened on public transportation by strangers who wish death upon you and your children.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
You wouldn't have to abandon any more of your family members as they...

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
as they died in a cold and sterile hospital bed.

45:34.000 --> 45:41.000
But three years and ten boosters later, it seems like every month another acquaintance of mine is dropping dead from a heart attack.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
And that social contagion? Well, the world has never been more divided.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
In other words, as suspected, all of those promises fell short.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
And while anyone with two eyes to see would call the response to the pandemic and epic failure,

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
the regime continues to operate as though the Titanic didn't just smash into a giant iceberg

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and that it successfully made its way across the Atlantic Ocean.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
And now we're all expected to clap for the captain of the ship.

46:09.000 --> 46:19.000
And that's exactly what we did this week, when the circus production of delusion awarded to scientists a Nobel Prize for their contribution to the development of COVID-19.

46:21.000 --> 46:28.000
I mean, the fact that anyone would be awarded for creating something so dangerous and deadly is ridiculous enough on its own.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
But after Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize for bombing seven countries, this isn't what should surprise you.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
What should set off alarm bells is that these two won the prize instead of the actual inventor of mRNA technology, Robert Malone.

46:43.000 --> 46:59.000
You see, back in the late 1980s, Robert Malone in a landmark experiment discovered that it was possible to transfer mRNA protected by a liposome into cultured cells to signal the information needed for the production of proteins.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
Yeah, I don't really get what any of this means either, but we don't have to get what it means.

47:04.000 --> 47:12.000
Because up until the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community agreed that it meant Robert Malone was the inventor of mRNA technology.

47:13.000 --> 47:23.000
Even Wikipedia recognized Malone as the pioneer, as the way back machine shows us that before the pandemic, their page on mRNA vaccines said the following.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
In 1989, Robert W. Malone P. felt

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
I find myself asking is, is 204 captures?

47:34.000 --> 47:42.000
A lot of captures for a, for a webpage between, what is it between February?

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
I mean, I don't know, anyway, low, it's a low number, okay.

47:47.000 --> 47:55.000
Wagner et al. developed a high efficiency in vitro and in vivo RNA transfection system using cationic liposomes.

47:56.000 --> 48:06.000
These studies were evidence that in vitro transcribed mRNA could deliver the genetic information to produce proteins within living cell tissue.

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
But then something unexpected happened after the release of a vaccine, Malone started talking a lot.

48:14.000 --> 48:21.000
In fact, he talked his way right into the highest rated podcast of all time, Joe Rogan.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
And what he said was not so favorable,

48:24.000 --> 48:34.000
First person to post the right, the right date of the Joe Rogan podcast that, that Robert Malone was on, uh, wins prize.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
I don't know what that prize is, like you win.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Do you remember when it was? Because it wasn't as early as you think.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
To the people who stood to gain very handsomely from the vaccine.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
He said unequivocally that the COVID-19 vaccine was unsafe.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
A claim he is not wavered on to this day.

48:55.000 --> 49:02.000
When recently asked if given that the patents for mRNA vaccines belong to him in date back to 1989.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Who's she citing here?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Who's she citing here?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Who is that guy?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I think he's on my map.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
He's down here on my map.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
Robert Martinotti blocked me because I was trying to point out that they used clones.

49:24.000 --> 49:31.000
And Robert Martinotti is the gatekeeper for, for Mike Eden's telegram group.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Like he blocked me.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Uh, uh, I just find it kind of funny.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I mean, here she is.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Robert Malone is definitely the inventor.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Should have definitely got the prize of anyone.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
And Robert Martinotti agrees.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
If he should have gotten the Nobel Prize instead, he replied,

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
probably not because the technology has not been proven to be safe.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
After making his rounds on several popular podcasts,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
the media swiftly removed him as the inventor of mRNA technology.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
The mainstream media got to work on their hit pieces and in came Catalin Carrico,

50:12.000 --> 50:20.000
a little known scientist who spent her entire career attempting to improve the technology that Malone developed to no avail.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
Until magically in 2020, everything changed.

50:24.000 --> 50:31.000
After the release of the vaccines, she suddenly shot straight up to the top as the darling inventor of the miracle prophylaxis.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
So what exactly was Carrico's contribution to the science behind mRNA vaccines?

50:37.000 --> 50:44.000
She and her partner Weisman modified the vaccine by adding pseudo-uridine, which get this,

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
made the vaccine less inflammatory.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Yeah, that's right.

50:49.000 --> 50:55.000
The drug that's inflaming people's hearts to the point of killing them was tweaked by Carrico and Weisman

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
to be less inflammatory, earning them a Nobel Prize.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
That really is something. I can't imagine what the vaccine did before their contribution,

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
but I'm going to assume it looks something like this.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
I mean, aside from the fact that the vaccine is unsafe and useless,

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
awarding these to you instead of the actual inventor of mRNA technology

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
is kind of like snubbing the Sumerian people for inventing the wheel

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
and instead opting to award the dude who invented spinner hubcaps.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
This is wild.

51:41.000 --> 51:51.000
Look, I know I didn't make it possible for like things to move or whatever,

51:51.000 --> 52:01.000
but I made it possible for things to look like they're moving when they're not.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Which is super trippy, bro. Trust me, it's jokes.

52:04.000 --> 52:11.000
I mean, none of this is surprising, just as the scientists behind lobotomies won a Nobel Prize back in 1949,

52:11.000 --> 52:18.000
our upside-down society will continue to award those who conduct the most atrocious experiments on human beings,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
as long as it's profitable, of course.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
I learned very young that you don't win in this world for talent or hard work or virtue.

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
You win by being part of the club.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
And boy are these two ever part of the club.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
Drew Weisman spent his college year studying biochemistry.

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
He engaged in environmental and racial justice and was also a voting rights activist.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
After graduate school Weisman completed a residency at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center

52:48.000 --> 52:55.000
and a fellowship at the NIH, where he worked on HIV research under the supervision of none other

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
than the King of COVID and the Vouchy.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Katalyn Carrico's rap sheet is even worse.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
After being demoted four times throughout her career, because not a single one of her peers

53:07.000 --> 53:10.000
saw any value in her contributions to mRNA research,

53:10.000 --> 53:17.000
she finally caught her lucky break when she ran into Weisman at a photocopier in 1997.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
Weisman told her he wanted to create a vaccine for HIV.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
She told him she could do that and they became fast friends.

53:25.000 --> 53:33.000
In 2005, the pair published their research on how mRNA might be used to send instruction to disease cells.

53:33.000 --> 53:40.000
And in their own words, they were waiting for their phones to ring off the hook but didn't get a single phone call.

53:40.000 --> 53:50.000
It wasn't until 2019 when Carrico became the vice president of BioNTech, the creators of the COVID-19 vaccine,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
that her hard work finally bared through.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But wait, there's more.

53:55.000 --> 54:02.000
Pfizer, who I will remind you, teamed up with Carrico's company BioNTech to create the COVID-19 vaccine,

54:02.000 --> 54:10.000
donates heavily to the Carolinska Institute, which is solely responsible for awarding the Nobel Prize.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Wow, how perfectly kosher.

54:12.000 --> 54:23.000
Catalin was also a communist spy in her home country, Hungary, but she ensures us that she didn't do anyone any harm during that period of her life.

54:23.000 --> 54:32.000
Besides the last statement, most of that's right out of Robert Malone's own Twitter feed.

54:32.000 --> 54:44.000
So the fact that she plugged him so hard, the fact that she plugged Robert Montanatti and that he was plugging Robert,

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
it's definitely some kind of network of theater.

54:49.000 --> 55:00.000
It's a question of who they work for or working for or against or what, but JP Sears is part of this group.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
It's a pretty impressive little machine.

55:06.000 --> 55:15.000
And so I do think that there's a lot more pieces of this puzzle to put together and we'll keep doing that because the show must go on.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
And they are definitely having a spectacular commitment to these lies.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
It's such a spectacular commitment to the lies that it creates an illusion of consensus.

55:28.000 --> 55:36.000
And that illusion of consensus is what fooled you and me and everybody, our families and friends and everybody on the whole planet.

55:36.000 --> 55:45.000
Into thinking that the right thing to do with the right question to ask was, where the hell did this virus come from?

55:45.000 --> 55:56.000
And the craftiness of it was is that this plan also included ceding a poison pill narrative of there are no viruses at all.

55:57.000 --> 56:11.000
So that if you ever started to consider the possibility that they were lying, then there would be this ostracized group of incongruent people that you could be immediately placed in,

56:11.000 --> 56:23.000
or immediately find a home in with people who gave you the illusion of consensus that no virus is actually a really, really smart place to be.

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
You don't get there all by yourself and you don't stay there all by yourself.

56:28.000 --> 56:36.000
But if you find the truth or you get very close to the truth all by yourself, you tend to stay there.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
And that's how we're here. We're all people wandering in the dark and saw each other's torch.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
And now we all get together here every once in a while, but this is what this is about.

56:49.000 --> 56:56.000
Everybody else is being led away from the exit and back deeper into the cave.

56:56.000 --> 57:08.000
By all these sides shows all these dumb stories that have nothing to do with the original crime as Mike Eden so eloquently put it.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
It is a crime. It's an ongoing crime. I don't know how long it's going to go on.

57:13.000 --> 57:21.000
They have lied to us about this pandemic potential and our accessibility to it in order to create a mythology that could enslave our children.

57:21.000 --> 57:33.000
And they did it with an illusion of consensus on all sides of the ball, on TV, on social media, but also among the people who were full censored

57:33.000 --> 57:43.000
so that everybody would in theory be sucked into this and decide that solving these were a good idea because we didn't know what was going on.

57:43.000 --> 57:53.000
Because it was a gain of function virus, we didn't know how bad it would be. So thank goodness we locked down.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
So it's going to take a while for everybody to come to the conclusion that I energetic murder was the pandemic, but we can do it.

58:00.000 --> 58:19.000
We've got to stay strong and consistent and not be distracted by the illusion of consensus about a laboratory or bad cave virus and be steadfast in our understanding that the protocols were murder and transfection is a medicine.

58:19.000 --> 58:28.000
It doesn't matter what you call it. Whatever name you want to call the background, it doesn't matter.

58:28.000 --> 58:34.000
And this is the trap that you cannot fall into. Don't let them get you.

58:34.000 --> 58:42.000
That there are artificial ways to create disease. There are artificial ways to disseminate DNA and RNA.

58:42.000 --> 59:00.000
And there may be lots in different ways that mammals and plants and reptiles and vivians fungi all use small vesicles containing RNA and DNA to communicate within and between.

59:01.000 --> 59:08.000
And we know that's true. It's just a question of how much, what role they play, how much they drive evolution.

59:08.000 --> 59:21.000
It's always been something missing in the biology of evolution, of mutation, random mutations leading to adaptation.

59:21.000 --> 59:30.000
One of the things that really is missing from there is that you kind of have a real, you lose a lot of really good traits then for just unlucky.

59:30.000 --> 59:36.000
I think we're going to find that a lot of the biology that we've been led to believe is a lie.

59:36.000 --> 59:43.000
And I think we're going to find that a lot of the reason why we've been lied to is because they don't want us to understand their goals.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
They don't want us to understand how we're really being governed.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
And they don't want our children to understand how they intend to govern them.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is going to likely be dumb in a few years.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So you might as well get ahead of the curve.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Transfection is definitely not immunization. That's not ahead of the curve. That's just smart.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Stop all transfections in humans.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
They are trying to eliminate the control group by any means necessary.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm going to go get some TV and put some vinegar in it or something, whatever Pamela said.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Hopefully this is not going to get any worse.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Thanks for joining me, everybody.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Thanks for joining me.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:30.000
What does that mean? I am Amalek.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You type that every night, but I don't know what you mean.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Keeping our flashlights forward, our arms straight.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
We're going out of here.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Walking out of the cave, my friends.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Hey, there was an eclipse. I forgot to use that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Darn it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'll use it tomorrow night.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Thanks, guys.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Thank you.
