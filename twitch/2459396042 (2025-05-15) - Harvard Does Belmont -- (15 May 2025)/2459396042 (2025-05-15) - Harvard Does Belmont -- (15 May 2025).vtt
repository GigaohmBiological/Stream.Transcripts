00:05.103 --> 00:08.805
I have to tell you that I'm more interested in substance than slogans.

00:09.265 --> 00:12.187
I'm getting a little lost in the MAGA, the MAHA.

00:12.267 --> 00:13.167
Now there's AHA.

00:13.587 --> 00:14.948
I don't know where we're going with this.

00:15.388 --> 00:16.949
I want to talk about the substance.

00:17.569 --> 00:24.012
And in this case, something very personal to me is the issue of addiction and mental health.

00:24.513 --> 00:27.494
And I know what you care deeply about these issues.

00:28.034 --> 00:32.997
I know you have been honest about your own recovery, your own struggle with addiction.

00:33.657 --> 00:39.460
In my family, my middle son Harry is now 12 and a half years in recovery from opioid addiction.

00:39.900 --> 00:40.741
It was a long road.

00:41.221 --> 00:42.302
It was a hard road.

00:42.702 --> 00:48.525
In active addiction, you know how difficult it is and it's difficult to bring a family member back.

00:48.945 --> 00:50.286
I give Harry great credit.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.907
He now works in the area of addiction.

00:53.568 --> 00:58.230
That's why I'm very, very worried about what is going on with SAMHSA.

00:58.871 --> 01:03.274
If you take a look at the data, the numbers, we were getting somewhere.

01:03.775 --> 01:09.939
Two years ago, three years ago, we were losing 110,000 people a year to overdose.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.061
That's 300 people a day.

01:12.741 --> 01:16.864
I call that a jetliner a day of souls crashing to this country.

01:17.525 --> 01:24.670
Just last year, the second half of 23 and the first half of 24, 12 months, that number went down 27%.

01:27.679 --> 01:29.360
81,000 deaths of overdose.

01:29.841 --> 01:31.802
Don't let me minimize 81,000 deaths.

01:31.982 --> 01:34.504
That's still 220 people a day.

01:34.884 --> 01:39.287
Today, tomorrow, yesterday, 365 days a year.

01:39.967 --> 01:44.230
But a 27% reduction in overdose deaths in this country?

01:45.170 --> 01:48.732
Overdose is still stealing a generation in this country.

01:49.373 --> 01:52.855
So why in God's name are we shuttering SAMHSA?

01:54.379 --> 01:56.361
We are not shuddering, Samson.

01:56.661 --> 02:01.864
I share your concerns and I'm anxious to work with you on this problem.

02:02.425 --> 02:03.766
I'm fully committed to it.

02:04.847 --> 02:09.009
Because of my own history, I lost a brother to overdose.

02:09.110 --> 02:11.811
I lost one of my nieces during the pandemic to overdose.

02:12.652 --> 02:15.614
Like every family in this country has somebody that was lost.

02:16.655 --> 02:20.297
As you point out, we were losing, I think, two years, three years ago, 106,000 American kids.

02:23.849 --> 02:29.752
It's double the number that we lost during the 20 year Vietnam War and we ought to be applying.

02:32.994 --> 02:37.416
I think he said 106,000 kids, which gosh, darn it.

02:37.636 --> 02:39.277
I don't, I don't know if that's accurate.

02:39.297 --> 02:44.080
I don't have all these numbers, but I'm sure he's going to fumble the ball here and it's frustrating.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.341
I'm very, very, very, very sorry about that.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.480
Why the cuts to SAMHSA and why are you shifting?

02:50.540 --> 02:52.721
We're not, we are not shuttering SAMHSA.

02:52.761 --> 02:55.122
We are still running 500 addiction centers.

02:55.502 --> 03:03.845
You've already cut SAMHSA and the budget proposal is to shutter it and shift it to an AHA program, which I don't know what AHA means.

03:03.885 --> 03:07.407
To shift it to the Administration for Healthy America.

03:09.019 --> 03:17.465
We're shifting a lot of the chronic disease programs out of CDC into a center that will address chronic disease.

03:17.825 --> 03:22.569
And you and I agree that overdose is a public health epidemic in this country.

03:22.789 --> 03:23.109
Yes.

03:23.830 --> 03:33.176
And why would we, when we are finally seeing some success, bury that success, put it in an AHA program, which, by the way, logically doesn't make any sense.

03:33.497 --> 03:37.720
We have to now rehire people and figure out what their roles will be within AHA.

03:38.430 --> 03:39.711
Why wouldn't we analyze?

03:39.831 --> 03:52.616
I would also point out, I guess Mark would agree with me, hi Mark in the chat, that the deaths going down doesn't mean that the opioids are ruining any fewer lives.

03:54.809 --> 04:02.991
Just like when deaths from gunshot wounds go down in Chicago, that doesn't mean that guns are being fired less or people are being shot less.

04:03.512 --> 04:07.473
It can just mean that the ER is getting better and better at treating gunshot wounds.

04:08.033 --> 04:20.556
And in this case, if you're putting Narcan in everybody's purse so that people don't die of acute overdose, I guess you're kind of reducing that number, but I don't really know if that's

04:21.761 --> 04:23.162
If that's a use, I don't know.

04:23.422 --> 04:24.382
You know, see what I'm saying?

04:24.402 --> 04:26.543
I'm just kind of pessimistic about this whole argument.

04:26.883 --> 04:34.546
The data that shows we just saved 20 plus thousand lives in the course of one year.

04:35.007 --> 04:36.367
This matters in my district.

04:36.667 --> 04:41.229
I have buried way too many kids to overdose, to fentanyl poisoning, by the way.

04:41.249 --> 04:41.950
You don't have to be an addict.

04:41.970 --> 04:42.610
This was like this week.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.650
You can just be poisoned.

04:43.690 --> 04:44.951
Yesterday or the day before.

04:45.311 --> 04:48.775
Why in God's name are this this administration wants to shutter it?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.998
We know that and shift it into aha.

04:52.389 --> 04:53.230
Why would you do that?

04:53.350 --> 04:54.370
They don't want to shutter.

04:54.430 --> 05:00.315
What we want to do is we want to shift that function into a place where we're going to be able to administrate it more efficiently.

05:00.455 --> 05:01.716
And that's all.

05:01.916 --> 05:03.217
What analysis was done?

05:03.257 --> 05:09.301
Can you show us the study that led you to the decision, shutter SAMHSA, shift it.

05:09.481 --> 05:14.104
We call that shift and shaft in my old days as an appropriator in Pennsylvania.

05:14.425 --> 05:17.427
Shift it over here, throw it in a block grant program, and good luck.

05:17.967 --> 05:30.279
What's the analysis that you did that said whatever SAMHSA was doing with harm reduction, by the way, with making naloxone available, with training for naloxone, I literally carry this with me every day.

05:30.579 --> 05:36.685
I want to normalize the life-saving capacity of naloxone and you guys want to bury it in AHA.

05:37.279 --> 05:40.280
Oh, we want to provide Naloxone, Narcon.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.881
We want to make sure that addicts have every option.

05:42.921 --> 05:44.282
You're eliminating the training for that.

05:44.322 --> 05:51.024
Suboxone to methadone and to 12-step programs to inpatient, outpatient.

05:51.224 --> 05:53.485
You're zeroing them out.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.746
We run 500 addiction centers.

05:55.826 --> 05:57.386
We're not going to stop doing that.

05:57.646 --> 05:59.067
My agency will still do it.

06:00.488 --> 06:06.633
It's shifting to a subdivision where we can operate it more efficiently with other chronic diseases.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.397
But do you realize that- CDC is going to do infectious disease, which is why we created it.

06:13.799 --> 06:20.805
How can he really be doing any of this if he spends all of his time talking to cameras or standing behind Trump while Trump talks to cameras?

06:20.945 --> 06:21.486
It's just-

06:23.004 --> 06:29.225
I mean, obviously now, given where we are in America, I want to be very clear with my messaging.

06:29.365 --> 06:30.005
I'm afraid.

06:30.025 --> 06:36.807
I'm, I'm afraid in a, in a adult, mature and realistic way.

06:37.027 --> 06:49.709
I'm worried that our country is somehow, you know, like the, the cruise ship is going way too fast into the Harbor and everybody is arguing about the,

06:51.437 --> 07:06.125
the lack of top shelf whiskey on the fourth floor bar, and about the ruckus that's being created in the pool, instead of worrying about what's going on with the ship as a whole.

07:07.466 --> 07:13.810
And this show, as it gets more and more malevolent, really starts to eat at me.

07:14.070 --> 07:20.554
And I'm sure it eats at you, but the most important thing to understand is that it is designed

07:21.929 --> 07:22.669
to eat at us.

07:24.350 --> 07:33.735
And the trick is, can we understand it correctly so that it motivates us in the right way, that it points us in the right direction, that it suggests the correct actions?

07:34.775 --> 07:43.759
Because if we interpret this in the way that the militarized social media and our skillful use of it would like us to, then we will

07:45.908 --> 07:47.849
We will panic ourselves into a trap.

07:47.929 --> 08:11.675
I don't know exactly what the trap is I'm not going to call it some kind of digital prison because I think that's a That's a that's a myth the real prison is the acceptance of social media as as The new norm as the new way to like we didn't already like email didn't already work And so we're

08:12.771 --> 08:16.533
and, and, you know, having your own website and maintaining your own website.

08:16.553 --> 08:19.075
These are all things that worked just fine.

08:20.255 --> 08:23.397
And now we are, we are surrendering our consciousness.

08:23.457 --> 08:28.220
And more importantly, we are surrendering our children's consciousness to social media programs.

08:28.300 --> 08:37.445
And that is incredibly dangerous because again, remember what's really happening there is we are allowing our use of language

08:38.320 --> 08:45.846
and infinite examples of it to be produced and given to an AI, if you want to call it that.

08:45.886 --> 08:51.771
But it's really just a machine learning algorithm that can see patterns that we can't, identify patterns that we can't.

08:51.791 --> 08:59.777
I shouldn't say it can see, but it can be used to identify patterns in language that when put together,

09:02.421 --> 09:05.343
can mimic human speech.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.985
And that's not magical.

09:08.045 --> 09:13.949
That's just the application of computing power already to a solved problem.

09:15.790 --> 09:30.721
And this transition that's happening where computers are gonna start to produce more and more of this language, and we're gonna have to understand that, that language can be weaponized against us because language is not as complicated as we imagine it to be.

09:32.777 --> 09:55.667
And so if you are not sufficiently adept at using the correct word at the correct time and aware of how the misuse of words can be weaponized and has been weaponized against all of us since we were kids,

09:56.957 --> 10:07.205
then you won't really be able to see how malevolent it is on social media where this has taken on a couple layers of acting, couple layers of actors.

10:08.666 --> 10:23.658
Now instead of, if you have one principled Tom Brokaw who has authority to choose his staff and he chooses principled people, then it's gonna be pretty hard for you to get Tom Brokaw to read fake stories.

10:24.870 --> 10:30.013
unless you produce them, unless you make them happen and provide the characters.

10:31.414 --> 10:51.748
And so on social media, unfortunately, our use of it provides the opportunity for a government or a military or a private weaponized pile of money to provide you with bad guys and good guys, opinions and crazy people

10:53.058 --> 11:18.413
and even provides the means by which a malevolent actor, a person with ulterior motives could use a combination of messages to create an illusion that you would never be able to see through because the default assumption when you pick up your phone and you open up one of these apps is that you're getting a representation of your follower list.

11:20.154 --> 11:20.935
And that's not true.

11:22.409 --> 11:23.630
It's absolutely not true.

11:23.670 --> 11:38.821
What you're getting is a representation of the theater that this social media, i.e., weaponized military social control suite, is giving you.

11:39.581 --> 11:46.766
And if they want you to be concerned about Israel today, because there was a bomb that exploded in

11:48.197 --> 11:50.979
some capital city, then they'll tell you all about it.

11:51.139 --> 11:54.041
And all kinds of personalities will tell you about it.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.783
And all kinds of personalities will tell you that they're also concerned about it.

11:59.224 --> 12:07.630
Just like on some days on this media, you can see a lot of TikTok videos with AI, and sometimes you see none.

12:08.530 --> 12:15.155
Sometimes you see the same kind of video, like babies was it the other day, baby AI videos.

12:16.656 --> 12:19.379
And everybody was sharing one funny one or another one.

12:19.439 --> 12:23.164
I think even Nicole Shanahan shared one the other day.

12:25.567 --> 12:35.719
And so if you think about that phenomenon happening on a platform like X, and because you scroll through it for 20 minutes, and so that means you see, what, 100 posts?

12:38.267 --> 12:40.228
They already understand very well.

12:40.288 --> 12:42.809
Number one, how to keep you on there as long as possible.

12:43.169 --> 12:45.210
Number two, how many ads you'll tolerate.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.771
Number three, how fast you read.

12:47.331 --> 12:51.613
Number four, whether or not you look at boobs or not.

12:51.653 --> 12:52.753
They know all those things.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.874
And they've known it for a long time.

12:54.914 --> 12:57.975
And the more that you've used it, the more that they've learned about all of us.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.237
And as I've come to understand this,

13:03.658 --> 13:21.277
Malevolent platform more and more I've come to understand it as a place also where people are paid to to pretend You know to be a certain character and a lot of anonymous people there are paid to be certain characters and maybe paid to be several characters and

13:22.205 --> 13:33.891
Those pictures that they show you of a bunch of phones on a rack with one or two Chinese people working that, what they're showing you that for is for you to imagine, oh, the Chinese are very wicked.

13:34.411 --> 13:37.653
Would they make a bunch of fake accounts and then try to control their people?

13:38.553 --> 13:41.995
But of course we know that Britain and America would do that just as well.

13:42.515 --> 13:44.997
That's why they blame it on the Russians or the Chinese.

13:46.277 --> 13:49.279
And so the trick is to understand that

13:50.723 --> 14:07.980
maybe a lot like and this is important maybe a lot like how Epstein and the story of Epstein was likely a story maybe with some reality in it that was a homegrown um

14:10.066 --> 14:18.939
Operation they want you to believe it's you know Mossad or something like that, but just imagine that the United States Had some kind of you know safe

14:23.277 --> 14:26.539
safe sort of, you know, compromise or operation.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.563
So that, you know, if you're going to do this kind of stuff, you're going to do it with Jeffrey Epstein and all these clowns.

14:33.283 --> 14:42.469
And at least then you'll be doing it with other Americans and under the supervision of the FBI and not under the supervision of, you know, whatever the KGB or MI6 or whatever they're called.

14:43.990 --> 14:44.090
And

14:45.427 --> 15:03.272
maybe just maybe that's that's what you have here with regard to social media is it gives it gives a sort of you know private provided option for governments to potentially control the opinion of the masses you almost can kind of sell it to them

15:04.121 --> 15:10.446
You know, you could almost see maybe even that that's exactly what Elon Musk is doing all around the world.

15:11.046 --> 15:15.629
That's why he's paying all of these people to keep saying that on X and on X, I post this.

15:15.669 --> 15:20.133
That's why Nicole Shanahan, who some, Mark enlightened me.

15:20.753 --> 15:25.096
You know, I was just kind of casually commenting yesterday on, wow, I'm just going crazy here.

15:26.277 --> 15:29.480
Casually commenting on Nicole's, I don't know how much she's worth, but

15:30.240 --> 15:34.704
I guess I kind of forgot that she was married to the guy that created Google.

15:34.744 --> 15:41.551
Google's worth like, you know, I don't know, 10 or 100 times more than a pharmaceutical company's worth.

15:43.032 --> 15:46.976
Like, so we're talking about Pfizer wanting to make all this money.

15:47.016 --> 15:51.940
But I mean, there are companies that are orders of magnitude larger than Pfizer.

15:53.582 --> 15:53.682
And

15:54.246 --> 16:04.694
potentially worth more because they are selling their services, can sell their services to the highest bidders around the world, the largest weaponized piles of money around the world.

16:06.035 --> 16:10.398
And I don't think we can underestimate how much of that is central to what's going on here.

16:12.099 --> 16:16.582
And while we're arguing about fluoride in the water or Froot Loops,

16:18.444 --> 16:28.409
And, you know, Pfizer, these people are operating companies on orders of magnitude larger than that with objectives that are much bigger.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.191
And that is controlling how people know things.

16:33.252 --> 16:34.172
Absolutely it is.

16:34.733 --> 16:41.256
It is more or less, I think, creating an electronic alternate reality that they can flip on a dime.

16:41.477 --> 16:45.379
It may already basically exist in the form of the internet as we use it.

16:46.260 --> 16:57.224
And unless we get decentralized in a serious way, unless we start really building and taking over this infrastructure in a decentralized way, we really may be in trouble.

16:57.344 --> 17:09.408
I don't even know as a, I'm not a computer engineer, so I don't even know if building a decentralized internet of peer tubes and soap boxes will even solve the problem if in the end all those servers can be turned off too.

17:10.419 --> 17:16.865
All of those websites can just be erased or IP not found or whatever it is.

17:20.468 --> 17:21.489
Something is wrong.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.873
And they are running out the clock with this theater.

17:25.033 --> 17:26.314
This is a theater.

17:26.874 --> 17:29.876
It is a big show that we're supposed to get engaged with.

17:29.936 --> 17:32.457
We're supposed to wave the waitress over and get more drinks.

17:32.537 --> 17:37.279
And we're supposed to not want this to stop because our guy's on stage.

17:37.739 --> 17:38.700
He's finally there.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.381
We got him on stage and now he's going to do something, right?

17:44.881 --> 17:53.228
It's very, very, very, very, very important to understand how crucial a time point in American history I think this is.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.490
You've got to change your perspective.

17:58.472 --> 18:01.195
You've got to start thinking in longer time horizons.

18:01.995 --> 18:10.602
You've got to think about planting trees under whose shade you will not shelter by trying to get our kids out of this trap.

18:11.203 --> 18:13.685
And it is a very, very, very deep,

18:14.611 --> 18:22.576
multi-layered trap, but it is essentially constructed of people who have a spectacular commitment to lying.

18:23.737 --> 18:24.538
It's that simple.

18:25.218 --> 18:27.640
They have decided not to look behind the curtain,

18:28.914 --> 18:37.621
If you want to use that analogy to say what he's and Donald Trump are doing with respect to Israel, you could say that.

18:37.721 --> 18:45.127
But honestly, I don't know enough about what's going on in Israel to know if what's going on in Israel is going on.

18:47.396 --> 18:56.182
I don't wanna say anything that'll make anybody mad, but I just wanna say that most people only know what they see on social media.

18:56.262 --> 19:06.588
And it is possible, however unlikely, that they clear everybody out all the time, all the time, all the time, before they bomb things.

19:07.909 --> 19:14.733
And then they show people and they pay people to do this because they're all trying to create a narrative.

19:14.773 --> 19:15.354
It could be,

19:16.539 --> 19:17.479
And you don't know.

19:18.560 --> 19:23.081
And it's not because I think that that guy on Joe Rogan was right, you have to go there to know.

19:23.882 --> 19:29.304
I'm saying that you don't even know what's going on on the north side of Pittsburgh right now.

19:30.484 --> 19:31.124
I don't either.

19:32.885 --> 19:41.948
And so there's a reason why on our phone and on my phone, there's nothing about the north side of Pittsburgh, but there's always something about Israel.

19:42.728 --> 19:44.049
There's nothing about Egypt.

19:45.503 --> 19:47.004
There's almost nothing about Jordan.

19:48.506 --> 19:51.809
And only recently did I hear that Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia.

19:51.849 --> 19:53.651
So then there was something about Saudi Arabia.

19:53.691 --> 20:00.457
But most of the time, the only thing I hear about is this, how many ever square miles of relatively poor country.

20:04.724 --> 20:15.707
I mean, what is the biggest GDP and some of the biggest portion of GDP in Israel is pharmaceuticals and research and development in pharmaceuticals.

20:16.767 --> 20:23.889
I don't really understand how that economy works, but it's not amazing.

20:25.730 --> 20:33.432
It's not like a super productive population of people that are paying taxes into a government that has a surplus or something like that.

20:35.956 --> 20:39.217
At least that's what I can glean off of my phone and off of the internet.

20:42.418 --> 20:53.862
The thing about it is that frustrates me the most about this whole, this whole show is that no one on either side can claim to be winning.

20:54.162 --> 20:55.263
And I don't get it.

20:55.383 --> 20:59.444
The only people that can be, that can claim that the Trump

21:01.222 --> 21:06.265
3D chess is working are people that are absolutely positively paid to say that.

21:06.365 --> 21:23.434
No one in a rational, no one with their rational right mind would say that things are going great, that they got what they voted for, that he's doing exactly what I thought he would do, that prices are going down, that I'm so happy with my cheap eggs, that I can't believe that gas went so cheap.

21:25.995 --> 21:27.496
None of these things are happening.

21:30.458 --> 21:33.019
because they were never gonna happen.

21:33.059 --> 21:42.963
They just had to happen under somebody so that the people that were, you see, they got us riled up in a ball and we're just rolling around, but we're rolling in the exact same direction we were before.

21:43.003 --> 21:55.608
And if you see it as a ball and realize that sometimes you're on the bottom and sometimes you're on the top, and these people are just absolutely excited to be part of the people that are pushing the ball.

21:57.438 --> 22:08.467
This giant ball of confused people that's arguing with each other over years about the same thing, you know, like MMR.

22:09.188 --> 22:11.329
And I think we should have separate vaccines.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.391
And Andrew Wakefield's a hero.

22:13.451 --> 22:16.774
And oh my goodness, my son was injured by MMR.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.334
I cured him.

22:17.414 --> 22:20.297
And 25 years later, we're here.

22:23.527 --> 22:34.090
with this guy who basically got where he is because he took a video at the beach of himself swinging on chains with no shirt on and dropping to the floor and doing a few push-ups.

22:35.710 --> 22:44.192
I mean, he certainly didn't get to that chair by putting a dead bear in a bicycle in Central Park as a joke.

22:51.214 --> 22:51.294
I'm

22:53.482 --> 22:54.522
I'm motivated now.

22:54.663 --> 22:56.263
I really feel like it's time.

22:56.623 --> 22:58.884
And I really feel like our kids can win.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.885
Our kids can end this.

23:01.065 --> 23:11.570
Our kids can change fundamentally how people build and think about communities in society.

23:12.410 --> 23:12.990
I really do.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.251
And that's really what needs to happen.

23:15.952 --> 23:18.593
We need to come together under a new

23:20.899 --> 23:30.908
you know, renewed sense of who we are, and who we are as people, and what we want for our children, what we want for our grandkids.

23:31.308 --> 23:35.832
And none of what these people want is what we want.

23:36.612 --> 23:45.220
They pretend, they pretended very well for nearly 10 years straight, I think a lot of these people have been knowing this was coming.

23:46.397 --> 23:49.338
Maybe some of them even expected it to happen a little earlier.

23:49.398 --> 23:52.378
Maybe some of them even expected it to happen in 2001 or 2002.

23:53.178 --> 23:54.839
I think that's actually possible.

23:55.479 --> 23:58.380
Some of them thought it was going to happen in 2008 and it didn't.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.980
And now that it's happening now, they're so excited.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.181
All the signs are there.

24:05.001 --> 24:07.822
Everything I was told was going to happen is happening.

24:07.862 --> 24:11.902
So that's why I'm putting all my eggs in the basket of these people.

24:11.962 --> 24:13.983
That's what these people are thinking.

24:14.123 --> 24:14.723
I know it.

24:18.214 --> 24:21.536
It's a really, really pivotal moment in American history.

24:21.756 --> 24:22.696
I can't believe it.

24:23.436 --> 24:31.040
How excited I am about how of a pivotal moment in history this is.

24:31.460 --> 24:35.702
And I think that by really learning

24:38.536 --> 24:52.299
a different interpretation of basic biology and realizing, realizing that the anti-vax movement, the fake health freedom movement made no progress since its inception whenever that was.

24:53.260 --> 25:03.822
And that all the players that are in the upper echelon of that movement now, including Del Bigtree and Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Mary Holland,

25:04.738 --> 25:09.885
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pierre Kory, and Peter McCullough.

25:11.087 --> 25:15.432
These people are all there because they accepted the script in 2020.

25:17.996 --> 25:22.382
Wittingly or unwittingly, or under duress or not, they accepted the script.

25:24.133 --> 25:30.197
if it was because they were read into a national security operation and somebody said, well, if you don't do it, someone else is going to do it.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.218
We really need your help.

25:31.258 --> 25:33.079
This is a national security priority.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.101
And then they got in over their head.

25:35.161 --> 25:38.944
They still didn't have the principles they should have had.

25:39.384 --> 25:47.210
And they still don't have the principles that they should have now, knowing what they obviously know now, which is that they were lied to.

25:48.049 --> 26:01.985
that it was just murder, that it was just a anticipated rise in all-cause mortality seen in the population pyramid for decades, because even Ted Turner talked about it on TNT.

26:03.006 --> 26:06.490
I think he talked about it with Carl Sagan even.

26:08.720 --> 26:14.402
The one child policy in China created an inverted population pyramid in China too.

26:14.442 --> 26:20.323
They have this exact same problem that the rest of the West has, and maybe even more exacerbated in China.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.905
That's why we don't need as many elementary schools as we have.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.686
We won't need as many universities as we have right now.

26:29.746 --> 26:32.687
And so people are all scrambling for seats on a sinking ship.

26:37.958 --> 26:59.451
And I think that once you can see on that longer time horizon, then you can also see why fumbling the ball for a few years with opioids and fumbling the ball for a few years with carfentanil on the streets and other drugs would be a one real easy way to create a bunch of excess death all across the board.

27:00.456 --> 27:09.078
And then also, you know, put a bunch of people in place and tell a nice story about public health and how public health is a reason all the time.

27:09.138 --> 27:12.098
And virology is a science that you'll never understand.

27:12.158 --> 27:19.100
And intramuscular injection is absolutely the best way to administer medicine.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.921
And that's what this is really about.

27:23.761 --> 27:27.842
It's about turning your grandchildren into experimental farm animals.

27:27.882 --> 27:28.562
That's all it is.

27:30.919 --> 27:34.902
Because there will never be this much genetic diversity available on Earth again.

27:35.522 --> 27:36.242
And they know that.

27:37.863 --> 27:44.588
So it's a multigenerational, species-wide priority.

27:46.309 --> 28:00.018
Like, don't screw this up, says great-great-grandfather to great-great-grandson, who's thinking about his great-great-grandsons as being princes of the Earth generations from now.

28:01.423 --> 28:28.381
always destined to rule because you know it's the survival of the wisest okay i probably just ruined the beginning of this i probably should stop the video and start again but i won't i'll do the introduction now thanks for being here let's listen to a tune that i have no i have no reason to justify um i i

28:29.804 --> 28:31.445
I forgot I had another tune to play.

28:31.465 --> 28:31.605
Sorry.

28:31.625 --> 28:36.106
I was gonna make a joke, but it's not a joke Actually, I have a really good song to play and it's got a really good story.

28:36.146 --> 28:36.966
I forgot about that.

28:37.046 --> 28:37.267
Nice.

28:37.287 --> 28:44.509
Okay, here we go I don't care how you get there.

28:44.529 --> 28:55.413
I don't care what you do to get there The goal is to win What time is it

32:50.049 --> 32:51.070
The End

33:22.156 --> 33:23.717
Okay, let's start this thing right.

33:23.737 --> 33:24.677
Good morning, everybody.

33:24.737 --> 33:25.437
Welcome to the show.

33:25.457 --> 33:30.599
This is GigaOM Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

33:31.319 --> 33:33.060
That biologist is Jonathan Cooley.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.101
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the back of my garage.

33:36.121 --> 33:42.743
You can find the work that I did at the University of Pittsburgh, as well as in Norway and in the Netherlands at the

33:44.544 --> 33:48.789
Sorry, National Library of Medicine website PubMed.

33:48.949 --> 34:03.964
You can also find some of my work and commentary and some of my ideas in the Wuhan cover-up, A Terrifying Bioweapons Arms Race, a book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the Health and Human Services Secretary of the United States of America.

34:03.984 --> 34:06.127
I'm also a good friend of Jay Bhattacharya, although

34:06.707 --> 34:11.868
Darn seems to have lost my number since he got at the head of the NIH, but I forgive him.

34:12.789 --> 34:21.851
And I also was a staff scientist at Children's Health Defense under Brian Hooker before Mary Holland fired me for talking too much about Robert Malone.

34:23.211 --> 34:28.353
Anyway, this is the show that's also misrepresented on this sub stack called Woodhouse 76.

34:29.733 --> 34:36.415
This is a sort of conglomeration creation under the moniker Jessica Hockett.

34:37.555 --> 34:54.400
This is an American apparently from Chicago, but she collaborates with Nick Hudson and Jonathan Engler on this little work where they then have fake arguments with the geneticist Claire Craig and the respiratory enthusiast

34:55.880 --> 35:12.027
opioid expert Pierre Cory, Mike Eden, the retired pharma guy who doesn't know how biologics are made, and of course Jay Bhattacharya, the head of NIH, who ever since the last barbecue we were at, he seems to have lost my number.

35:12.167 --> 35:14.568
Anyway, there's my new little

35:15.208 --> 35:16.968
My little icon there.

35:16.988 --> 35:21.049
I don't think we're gonna call him Chief Woohoo anymore, but anyway.

35:21.870 --> 35:22.770
Welcome to the show.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.710
This is GigaOM Biological.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.351
We do stream to stream.gigaom.bio.

35:27.391 --> 35:29.571
I'm not so sure how playback goes there.

35:30.172 --> 35:32.672
I was having a little problem with it on my iPad this morning.

35:32.712 --> 35:43.655
So if you've got any feedback about my own websites there, gigaom.bio or stream.gigaom.bio, please give it to me because if I need to invest a little more money in a better server or something like that, I will.

35:44.675 --> 35:53.365
And finally add yourself to that list and my wife will send you an email and alert you to the fact that I'm going live.

35:53.966 --> 36:01.634
So yesterday and the day before we have been covering the topic of what is autism really?

36:02.415 --> 36:04.777
And we've been bouncing around from current

36:05.632 --> 36:16.176
thought leaders in America back to a 1968 proceedings of an Indiana University colloquium on infantile autism.

36:16.597 --> 36:31.723
And there seemed to be some striking differences between, number one, the relative frequency of finding it in children in the 60s and 70s was much lower, of course, and agreed upon

36:32.796 --> 36:46.685
an agreed upon pattern by both the current purveyors of this mythology, as I call it, autism spectrum disorder, and what I think is reality.

36:48.840 --> 36:53.824
I think they're telling us a story because intramuscular injection is not medicine.

36:53.844 --> 36:57.848
I think they're telling us a story that RNA can do things that it cannot.

36:57.908 --> 37:07.196
I think they're telling us a story so that we will allow our kids to essentially be subjects to transfection in the future.

37:07.276 --> 37:12.140
And I think that the population pyramid is a real problem that all of these people, wittingly or unwittingly,

37:12.680 --> 37:26.389
have omitted from their explanation of what happened when in reality this is a primary mover for why the murder and lies needed to be where they were, in what age groups, etc.

37:29.611 --> 37:35.942
And so again, just trying to, you know, stay on the ball, keep summarizing things every day, but also stay focused.

37:36.002 --> 37:39.788
And so let me just make sure I know which one is coming here.

37:40.870 --> 37:42.132
Oh yeah, we're gonna do that first.

37:42.813 --> 37:43.734
Am I gonna do that first?

37:44.454 --> 37:44.614
Yeah.

37:45.354 --> 37:49.056
So I really think this is short introduction.

37:49.116 --> 37:51.456
Oh, look, JC on a bike was timed out by Risa.

37:51.656 --> 37:53.277
Oh, time out, JC on a bike.

37:53.597 --> 37:58.539
Although this is no laughing matter, of course, somebody like ZDogg thinks it's a laughing matter.

37:58.579 --> 38:00.919
He's fine with dressing up as Doc Darth Vader.

38:00.959 --> 38:11.243
He's fine with making jokes with this dude for many, many, many podcasts for many, many, many years, lining him up to be taken into this Maha movement.

38:11.843 --> 38:16.147
that everybody insists is the biggest movement on earth, but it's a joke.

38:16.307 --> 38:22.013
It's only a big movement because X says it is, because on X it's made to look like that, but it's not.

38:23.114 --> 38:35.446
And that's what I find remarkable, is I think if you just look at how these people use podcasts on YouTube, Rumble, Rockfin, Locals, to create the illusion that Maha is big,

38:37.039 --> 38:50.822
You know, put the camera below the people, don't show the crowd, put in fake clapping, anything you need to do to make things look like it is as big as whatever Trump was doing, or a part of it, or adding to it.

38:51.803 --> 39:06.046
And that illusion now is stuck on the conservative side, and quite frankly, stuck on the liberal side, or whatever the other side is called, because they also kind of see it on social media as, wow, these people all are really crazy.

39:07.119 --> 39:10.682
and they have agreed with each other on these podcasts.

39:10.762 --> 39:12.503
And wow, they really are all crazy.

39:14.364 --> 39:19.888
And so this is a very, very dangerous place that this fake health freedom movement has brought us.

39:20.949 --> 39:27.574
And it's people like Brett Weinstein and his very naive wife are part of it.

39:27.634 --> 39:34.079
Because in 2021, I already had taught them that the PCR can't be as specific as they say.

39:35.205 --> 39:42.607
So they're misconstruing a background with spread and that transfection would cause autoimmune, it would be devastating.

39:42.687 --> 39:45.408
So I don't know how they're going to do it, but do not do it.

39:46.248 --> 39:47.349
And they shouldn't do it.

39:47.449 --> 39:48.409
And it's inappropriate.

39:48.449 --> 39:53.010
And I wrote a review that's on my website at the link Scooby.

39:53.050 --> 39:58.472
And that review supposedly is the whole reason why Brett Weinstein called me in the first place.

39:59.994 --> 40:09.807
And that review already said, lab leak, it already said, you know, the virus will evolve into more dangerous viruses if we transfect people to this protein.

40:09.848 --> 40:10.969
So I was totally in.

40:11.758 --> 40:17.119
and totally understood what Geert van den Bosch was saying and what Marek's disease in chickens meant.

40:17.939 --> 40:19.680
But I was right about one thing.

40:20.180 --> 40:32.143
These are transfections and they should have always been called transfections because then everybody would just understand that they're not special, they're not investigational vaccines, they're not worthy of a Nobel Prize.

40:32.523 --> 40:37.884
We've been using them on our bench in plants and in animals for decades.

40:39.207 --> 40:39.647
actually J.J.

40:39.727 --> 40:46.370
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

40:47.190 --> 40:59.835
And so that is really absolutely remarkable because I can tell a story like that about him, about him, about him, about, well, he's a good guy, about these guys, about all these people.

40:59.875 --> 41:00.915
They all know me.

41:00.955 --> 41:02.456
They've all had contact with me.

41:02.476 --> 41:06.037
They've all either been afraid or attempted to befriend me.

41:08.106 --> 41:29.829
and then disappeared, and then not published my podcast, and then had Sasha Latupova on three times afterward, or then instead went on to promote Jessica Hockett and Nick Hudson, or argue with Jiki Leaks instead of promoting GigaOM Biological, just some American family in Pittsburgh trying to fight for the truth.

41:33.399 --> 41:44.924
And imagine that somebody like Mary Holland would get somebody like me on her team, a biologist that could teach that all intramuscular injections don't make sense, and she fired me because I was talking about this guy.

41:48.886 --> 41:49.326
This guy.

41:49.346 --> 41:50.227
Who is this guy?

41:50.847 --> 41:59.191
How is it possible that a subsect of America thinks that this dude is some kind of emu-raising, horse-breeding patriot?

42:02.230 --> 42:14.114
How is it possible that this traitor, whose family has allegiances not to America, but to the crown, is not on a list somewhere?

42:16.315 --> 42:19.556
And instead, these people are behind this man.

42:19.716 --> 42:21.596
They are behind this man.

42:23.017 --> 42:29.159
And I make that accusation with authority, knowing what it might do for my five,

42:30.390 --> 42:36.275
my five member family, knowing what kind of position that puts us in, but I don't know what else to say.

42:36.295 --> 42:38.957
No one else can say it.

42:43.700 --> 42:45.502
And so I feel obliged to do so.

42:47.372 --> 43:00.458
I feel obliged to say that something is going drastically wrong, and that's why Kevin McKernan and Jessica Rose were in front of a Senate hearing with Ron Johnson a couple, three times, and not me.

43:03.139 --> 43:13.124
That's why it's very dangerous that these guys are getting multiple books published by Skyhorse Publishing, you know, the brilliant Tony Lyons.

43:16.809 --> 43:29.512
And I can't stress enough, it is not by accident that in 2008, Sky Horse publishes a book with an epilogue that suggests that an independent candidate named Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

43:30.072 --> 43:31.972
could help someone get to the White House.

43:32.072 --> 43:35.913
And then that someone could get shot in 2008.

43:36.473 --> 43:41.574
And then two years later, a book by Andrew Wakefield

43:42.907 --> 43:50.716
not a book by Heather Frazier, not a book by Brian Hooker, a book by Andrew Wakefield.

43:55.781 --> 44:03.490
Then in 2012, they did another book by Andrew Wakefield, not a book by Heather Frazier, not a book by, you know,

44:05.936 --> 44:17.605
Paul Thomas about unvaccinated kids or a book by Brandy Vaughn about unvaccinated kids or a book by Brian Hooker about unvaccinated, no, no, another book by Andrew Wakefield.

44:21.187 --> 44:32.696
Then in 2016, they published a book not with Brian Hooker, no, not with Brandy Vaughn, no, no, not with James Lyons Weiler.

44:35.353 --> 44:38.334
The guy who called it COVID like Robert Malone in 2020.

44:38.554 --> 44:43.035
The guy who knew about the fear and cleavage site before anybody else on the internet.

44:44.216 --> 44:52.098
The guy who in 2019 was saying that vaccine preventable diseases circulate asymptomatically among the vaccinated.

44:55.039 --> 45:00.201
Essentially setting up the narrative in the anti-vax movement in America

45:01.570 --> 45:04.831
that there is asymptomatic spreading of viruses everywhere.

45:05.171 --> 45:09.593
And so it will be plausible, not only plausible, but obvious that COVID could do that too.

45:10.073 --> 45:27.039
SARS-CoV-2, you know, the one that he was an expert on and staged that ridiculous thing in Pittsburgh where he stepped up to a podium and pretended to be talking to a large crowd when he was actually in the parking lot of a historic hotel that just happened to have a, you know, a really big covering.

45:28.598 --> 45:31.299
a concrete building above it that it could echo like that.

45:31.579 --> 45:33.119
Oh my gosh.

45:36.400 --> 45:56.765
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this guy, in like, what, April or March, was promoting Judy Mikovits, who descends from the same collection of mentors that Robert Malone descends from, the same collection of mentors that all these AIDS-believing retrovirus people

45:58.160 --> 46:06.693
Robert Malone thought that there would be a geneticist in every hospital using retroviruses to cure genetic diseases in 10 years when he was a postdoc.

46:07.695 --> 46:09.438
That's the kind of clown he is.

46:16.798 --> 46:21.504
So it's been a long strange trip to realize that I'm one of the few people who can actually figure it out.

46:21.985 --> 46:29.115
But I honestly, hearing Brian Hooker say what he said in 2013 on a recording really hit me in the head.

46:29.615 --> 46:31.297
Because this recording reveals

46:32.299 --> 46:35.161
that Brian Hooker is part of this.

46:35.381 --> 46:42.427
It reveals that every interaction that I had with him at CHD was kind of pretending not to know what I was talking about with transfection.

46:42.447 --> 46:51.575
We should do a podcast about that because, I don't know, I only have 16 years experience transforming and transfecting plants to make medicine.

46:51.715 --> 46:53.597
I won't mention that to you, Jay.

46:55.550 --> 46:58.233
A condition that we will not call autism.

46:58.373 --> 46:59.934
I don't like the word autism.

47:00.835 --> 47:01.876
He was vaccine damaged.

47:02.237 --> 47:03.658
He was neurologically damaged.

47:04.419 --> 47:07.101
A condition that we will not call autism.

47:07.262 --> 47:08.803
I don't like the word autism.

47:09.704 --> 47:10.725
He was vaccine damaged.

47:13.174 --> 47:14.255
And so that's why we're here.

47:14.295 --> 47:23.139
One thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

47:23.179 --> 47:31.644
But one thing I am confident of, from everything I've read, is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.

47:32.589 --> 47:36.871
So I know I promise not to do my introduction all the time, but I'm doing it today.

47:38.492 --> 47:46.836
That's Kevin McKernan saying that there is an RNA, you can find it, you can sequence it, you can move it around in cell culture and recapitulate disease.

47:46.876 --> 47:50.718
That's him just testifying that there is a novel virus that killed billions of people.

47:51.179 --> 47:53.380
It might be gain of function and therefore it could come again.

47:54.471 --> 47:55.912
It's just a statement of faith.

47:56.853 --> 48:03.597
And it's no different than when we see that recording of David Baltimore and he says, yeah, but didn't Gallo isolate it?

48:03.637 --> 48:04.678
So then why don't you ask him?

48:04.698 --> 48:06.098
This is just textbook stuff.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.542
Textbook stuff is the reason we are here.

48:12.102 --> 48:13.283
Textbook bullshit.

48:14.184 --> 48:15.905
And we need to come to terms with that.

48:16.789 --> 48:20.733
that the biology that we were taught in high school and college, it's wrong.

48:20.833 --> 48:22.114
It's essentially wrong.

48:22.194 --> 48:28.680
It's not that those chemicals don't exist or those proteins don't exist or those ion channels don't exist.

48:28.780 --> 48:38.569
It's that the interpretation of what those observations imply about the foundational principles underlying the pattern integrity.

48:39.995 --> 48:53.448
And they want you to believe that genes mean that evolution occurred and that evolution is a process that we should try to take hold of and control of.

48:54.529 --> 49:02.656
And even Joshua Lederberg down here, Joshua Lederberg already knew that this was ridiculous because how could we take control of a

49:04.813 --> 49:13.398
a written plan when we don't understand how the written plan is implemented over time and whether we have optimized that implementation or not.

49:13.458 --> 49:25.065
Maybe we should first work on figuring out how to optimize the development of a human before we start messing with the code of how development occurs when we don't even understand it.

49:25.506 --> 49:32.230
You see, I think Joshua Lederberg was much smarter than he's given credit for and a lot of times just to make sure

49:33.030 --> 49:35.472
I guess they had to keep him in these circles.

49:35.513 --> 49:36.513
They had to ask him in.

49:36.554 --> 49:41.538
And I think he was clever enough to know that most of the people in the room were not going to listen to him, even if he did.

49:43.300 --> 49:43.761
I don't know.

49:44.381 --> 49:46.203
It's a very interesting place to be.

49:46.223 --> 49:53.130
I know that I, at this, at knowing what we know now, I wonder what, where Joshua Lederberg would be.

49:53.190 --> 49:55.232
I still think he would be part of the ruling class.

49:56.707 --> 50:03.949
I still think he would be part of this group of people that thinks that, you know, the vast majority of people need to be told what to believe.

50:04.470 --> 50:08.111
And if we tell them the truth, it'll be way too complicated to explain to them.

50:08.171 --> 50:19.134
So we might as well just tell them some, you know, ridiculously simple version of the truth that gets us basically what we want and gives them, you know, a bunch of scary stories to tell their kids.

50:19.635 --> 50:20.815
And then we can get on with this.

50:25.489 --> 50:26.670
And they're all happy to do it.

50:27.251 --> 50:28.512
It just requires lying.

50:28.652 --> 50:31.515
It just requires, you know, surfing on four continents.

50:31.595 --> 50:34.138
It just requires accepting money for your farm.

50:34.178 --> 50:36.781
It just accepting a horse or two.

50:38.002 --> 50:42.026
Just accepting a house on the Atlantic Ocean.

50:42.326 --> 50:43.127
And $10,000 cats.

50:43.187 --> 50:43.608
That's all.

50:43.868 --> 50:44.689
That's all it means.

50:48.005 --> 50:49.266
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

50:49.346 --> 50:53.367
spent the day testifying on Capitol Hill where he faced a grilling as lawmakers.

50:53.547 --> 50:58.129
I want you to see how they can weaponize this against us because this is the problem right here.

50:58.169 --> 51:07.232
Because while we're on the conservative side thinking that autism means, you know, severe vaccine injury, shitting against the wall, headbanging and whatever.

51:08.018 --> 51:14.543
You know, because when I was on Zoom meetings with Brian Hooker, his adult son was walking in the background with a shirt off.

51:14.583 --> 51:23.571
So I guess that means that he's never gonna get better, permanently damaged, like Paula Aitken's son.

51:25.633 --> 51:35.261
And yet PBS NewsHour and the neuroscience community and the psychiatric societies and psychologists

51:37.256 --> 51:40.779
And teachers think a very different thing about autism.

51:40.939 --> 51:50.207
And if this rift in understanding is exploited, there are going to be some pissed off people in the world, some really ridiculously pissed off people in the world.

51:50.628 --> 51:53.931
And they're going to be believing things that are incongruent with one another.

51:54.911 --> 51:56.593
They won't be able to talk to each other.

51:56.633 --> 52:00.817
You see, I can't reason with my parents if they think this.

52:02.415 --> 52:06.817
And my dad was a special ed teacher, so I'm not even sure that he doesn't think this.

52:06.857 --> 52:07.797
He probably does.

52:08.437 --> 52:19.381
And so this revelation of the history of infantile autism and the thinking around it, and the understanding that the definition was so important.

52:21.215 --> 52:27.737
Otherwise they would lose control of even being able to figure it out if they couldn't define it and then agree about it in the same way.

52:28.217 --> 52:33.518
And that has been weaponized in a way that I cannot describe how ugly it is.

52:35.258 --> 52:50.422
To disguise that intramuscular injection is a terrible methodology, to disguise the fact that virology is a hoax of a science, and to describe the fact, to disguise the fact rather that public health is never

52:51.272 --> 52:53.134
a good reason to do anything.

52:54.235 --> 53:08.691
Yet public health right now, as I explained about these lawyers, public health right now, and in this case Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is allowed, an unelected official is allowed to suspend many fundamental rights on a whim.

53:09.632 --> 53:10.252
And a whim in

53:12.162 --> 53:15.444
Legal speak in America is called the rational basis test.

53:15.484 --> 53:17.625
You just have to have a reasonable explanation.

53:17.645 --> 53:20.546
You know, like you heard some stuff, you have a feeling.

53:21.787 --> 53:26.649
I just, I have a feeling something's going to go wrong, so I'm going to declare an emergency and it's totally okay.

53:27.970 --> 53:37.495
And there is a legal principle in American law called strict scrutiny, which means a good explanation, a good set of reasons, and a specific set of reasons.

53:38.306 --> 53:53.114
And if you hold the government to strict scrutiny when suspending fundamental rights, what you do is you essentially require the government to have a very strict list of circumstances and reasons why to justify suspending fundamental rights.

53:53.734 --> 53:58.997
It can't just be because some unelected official has a feather.

54:01.178 --> 54:06.301
It's gotta be a list of reasons, you know, like a thousand people have died in a day or, you know, whatever.

54:07.560 --> 54:12.605
And so this makes the PrEP Act unconstitutional.

54:13.025 --> 54:22.334
And any federal judge could, in theory, if put in the face of the right trial, where, oh, the PrEP Act doesn't allow you to sue.

54:22.374 --> 54:25.957
Well, yeah, it doesn't allow you to sue, but that's a fundamental right.

54:25.997 --> 54:29.741
You can't suspend that without strict scrutiny.

54:29.821 --> 54:33.264
So the law is struck and this would be done.

54:36.764 --> 54:40.006
Aaron Seery must understand that, or he's incompetent.

54:40.906 --> 54:44.388
Mary Holland must understand that, or she's incompetent.

54:44.888 --> 54:49.431
He, as a lawyer, must understand that, or he is essentially incompetent.

54:49.951 --> 55:02.618
And you can take this clip and play it to any lawyer you know, and either they can explain to you why I got the language kinda wrong, or they will explain to you that they also don't know, and therefore you know your friend is incompetent.

55:03.686 --> 55:09.968
Now listen to how awful the PBS NewsHour was with regard to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

55:10.148 --> 55:13.369
and autism just a couple days ago, maybe even yesterday.

55:13.590 --> 55:21.532
It's pressed him on the Trump administration's overhaul of federal health agencies and billions in cuts to the multiple agencies he oversees.

55:21.973 --> 55:31.136
House Democrats in particular raised concerns about whether Kennedy was violating the law in cutting funding appropriated by Congress for medical research this year.

55:31.616 --> 55:33.837
Kennedy said he's streamlining some funds.

55:35.097 --> 55:36.597
Excuse me, but that's BS.

55:36.977 --> 55:39.118
You are not rescaling NIH research.

55:39.178 --> 55:41.838
You are proposing to cut it by $20 billion.

55:42.098 --> 55:53.941
I want my questions answered on are you freezing and withholding funding that Congress- So your programming is so good that the PBS NewsHour is exactly the opposite of what you'd expect to see.

55:53.981 --> 55:57.382
So they show you this lady as a, you know,

55:59.117 --> 56:04.540
sharp and attacking and holding his feet to the fire kind of lady.

56:04.981 --> 56:07.482
And they're going to show Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

56:07.542 --> 56:08.823
as kind of a bumbling idiot.

56:09.003 --> 56:18.929
And it's amazing how a combination of editing and clip choice and setup can use the same clips to create the absolute opposite feeling.

56:19.049 --> 56:22.011
And it is remarkable how good they are at doing it.

56:22.131 --> 56:23.532
And this is not AI

56:24.522 --> 56:32.926
This is just very, very clever decades of advertising work being weaponized against you to control a narrative.

56:33.587 --> 56:37.369
Appropriated in 2025 for life-saving NIH research.

56:39.250 --> 56:43.012
We are not withholding any funding for life-saving research.

56:43.412 --> 56:44.913
Do you commit to following the law?

56:45.620 --> 56:46.061
Of course.

56:46.081 --> 56:54.570
I would just point out, and this is in the chat, Reginald says that PBS viewership is way down as a result of all this.

56:54.630 --> 56:55.711
It's not like it used to be.

56:56.332 --> 57:03.220
That just underscores the potential malevolence of the pivot.

57:04.315 --> 57:25.461
to instead of having something like PBS NewsHour being a news source that everybody pays attention to and holds their feet to the fire from all sides, now we have social media networks that can provide safe bubbles for everybody to think in where they never really have to be challenged like that.

57:25.541 --> 57:28.482
And when they step outside of their bubble, it's so

57:31.863 --> 57:36.486
It's so incongruent with what they understand that they see it clearly as the bubble that it is.

57:36.566 --> 57:39.849
But over here, they're so familiar with it that it feels normal.

57:43.211 --> 57:54.499
Almost like when a city kid comes to Kadat, Wisconsin for Neighbor Days and goes to the carnival in the park and is like, wow, is this lame.

57:55.620 --> 57:57.621
And then you have a beer tent up there and that's it?

57:58.221 --> 57:58.622
That's it?

57:59.382 --> 58:00.183
That's the whole thing?

58:01.328 --> 58:05.170
And a parade on Sunday with only two marching bands?

58:05.210 --> 58:05.830
Are you kidding?

58:06.571 --> 58:06.971
Wow.

58:07.631 --> 58:09.492
I mean, this is kind of sad.

58:10.252 --> 58:22.839
And if you grew up in Kadat, Wisconsin, you would think it was the perfect thing, like Grady in Doc Hollywood, that movie with Michael J. Fox.

58:23.875 --> 58:26.676
It's like this small town versus big city thing.

58:26.756 --> 58:36.060
And then it's crazy how on social media they've created that with the left and the right and a million other little fractions of that.

58:36.721 --> 58:46.745
So that no matter how you attempt to wander outside of your little bubble of discourse, it just feels so alien.

58:47.776 --> 59:09.944
And that's why I think it's really important to watch PBS NewsHour, because you can see how distorted your view is, or our view is, by using X and Instagram and Soapbox and whatever else I use, versus PBS News and MSNBC, or I don't know what else you would do, watch The View.

59:10.504 --> 59:12.985
I mean, remember, there are people who still watch TV.

59:14.522 --> 59:21.350
And it's this transition to people who are watching what they think or treat as TV, but really watching social media.

59:22.211 --> 59:30.040
And that transition is, is putting this power of how people know things.

59:30.520 --> 59:34.465
It's putting that power into other people's hands and that power is worth a lot of money.

59:35.711 --> 59:38.234
That's why Google is valued the way it's valued.

59:38.294 --> 59:45.622
That's why all these companies are valued the way they're valued and much higher than pharmaceutical companies that we're all being told to argue about right now.

59:48.024 --> 59:51.827
I really, I can't stress enough how I really think this is the issue.

59:51.867 --> 01:00:06.018
And so the no sphere that Desjardins is talking about is this network of computers and communication devices that would allow essentially everybody to, to more or less think the same thing.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:16.447
And how that would help us with the evolution of the species, because it would put all of us on the same page with regard to what we imagined we wanted in the future.

01:00:17.566 --> 01:00:19.047
and how we imagined we'd get there.

01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:21.509
Sounds like a really altruistic goal.

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:28.013
Could also be a very easy way to get everybody in the world to agree that being a farm animal is great.

01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:34.197
Let's see what they do with this.

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:35.717
Sorry, I don't know what's going on today.

01:00:35.737 --> 01:00:36.378
I can't shut up.

01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:40.437
fully obligating funding that Congress appropriated.

01:00:41.017 --> 01:00:49.320
We appropriated, it is the law of the land for NIH research, and to obligate those funds by September 30th of this year.

01:00:50.061 --> 01:00:54.943
Or are you planning to break the law by impounding congressionally appropriated funds?

01:00:55.263 --> 01:00:58.264
If you appropriate me the funds, I'm going to spend them.

01:00:59.551 --> 01:01:03.436
Kennedy's approach to the measles outbreak also came under scrutiny.

01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:08.522
He defended the CDC's response, but was pressed by Democrats about his stance on vaccines.

01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:12.386
If you had a child today, would you vaccinate that child for measles?

01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:13.828
For measles?

01:01:13.848 --> 01:01:14.669
Ooh.

01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:24.307
Probably for measles, I, you know, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.

01:01:25.368 --> 01:01:27.309
I have directed Jay Bhattacharya.

01:01:28.009 --> 01:01:29.289
Sure, no, like I said, I don't want to.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.330
So that everybody can make that decision.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.672
But I, you know, I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:34.892
Yeah.

01:01:35.732 --> 01:01:39.674
But I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me.

01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:44.342
Kennedy has also been vocal about autism.

01:01:44.402 --> 01:01:45.502
Look at this.

01:01:45.522 --> 01:01:57.145
Don't forget one of the predictions that I've made is that at some point there's going to be an announcement where Brian Hooker will be able to say, Hey, I always knew it was black boys because William Thompson covered up the data about black boys.

01:01:57.845 --> 01:02:01.186
And so it's going to be, there's going to be a racial tint to this too.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:05.007
Um, and it's probably bullshit.

01:02:06.247 --> 01:02:06.347
Um,

01:02:08.772 --> 01:02:11.614
It's probably bullshit for a number of reasons.

01:02:13.515 --> 01:02:18.718
It probably more has to do with something physiological, not genetic.

01:02:19.258 --> 01:02:25.422
Unless it's genetic by you mean like less fat, thinner skin, more muscle.

01:02:26.202 --> 01:02:31.305
Okay, so then you're more likely not to do a subcutaneous injection of MMR.

01:02:31.925 --> 01:02:36.248
You're more likely to do an intramuscular injection and so then maybe they are more vulnerable.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:41.792
That's one of the things that we're not talking about yet because I'm not sure how this figures in.

01:02:41.832 --> 01:02:46.394
But the MMR shot is one of the few subcutaneous shots on the schedule.

01:02:47.634 --> 01:02:54.337
I almost think it's not by accident that MMR was the shot that they chose in the UK with Wakefield.

01:02:56.598 --> 01:03:00.980
Because they may have even planned to declare

01:03:02.426 --> 01:03:08.111
that subcutaneous vaccination was dangerous and that we should go exclusively intramuscular.

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:11.614
That may be something that they were intending to do there.

01:03:12.975 --> 01:03:29.589
And the number of papers in the last, let's say 10 years since that originally started in the UK where people are advocating for needle gauge and direct, you know, how long the needle should be for good intramuscular injection without hitting any bones is pretty amazing.

01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:38.716
I don't know who in their right mind thinks to write a paper about how great intermuscular injection is as long as you use the right size needle.

01:03:39.336 --> 01:03:42.380
But apparently, quite a few people thought that that would help their career.

01:03:44.744 --> 01:04:01.634
And so I'm again arguing that the discussion of autism, the definition of autism has been militarized against us to make sure that our children and the parents of the coming generations don't realize that intramuscular injection is an invalid way of administering medicine in any context.

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:05.957
And we can keep saying that until proven otherwise.

01:04:09.448 --> 01:04:12.691
database to find, as he says, the causes of autism.

01:04:13.211 --> 01:04:18.716
His agenda has won praise from some, including those whose loved ones have severe complications.

01:04:19.137 --> 01:04:25.823
But his rhetoric, others say, fails to accurately portray the variety of people on the spectrum and the contributions they make.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:31.827
Our Ali Rogin has our look at how leaders in the autism community are advocating for themselves.

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:37.872
But let's start with the perspectives of viewers with autism and their caregivers on how they see this moment.

01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:39.433
Here's some of what they told us.

01:04:39.994 --> 01:04:44.017
OK, so remember, we're going to now talk to people with autism.

01:04:46.238 --> 01:04:50.582
So one of these kids could be could be Brian's son, right?

01:04:52.543 --> 01:04:55.525
As far as I understand, Brian's son could not do an interview.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.333
It could be Paula Aitken's son, right?

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:04.378
No, as far as I know, her son can't really do interviews like this either.

01:05:05.398 --> 01:05:16.608
But now we're going to hear a bunch of people say that not only are they autistic, but they're pissed that they're going to throw a lot of words at you.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.221
It's a semantic enchantment.

01:05:19.461 --> 01:05:27.765
And if you don't know the definition of the words or the new words have some weird meaning in your head when you hear them, you'll understand what's going on here.

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:39.191
It's not that dissimilar to, you know, defining all these different genders and challenging people to learn all these different pronouns under the pretense of accepting them in the first place.

01:05:40.471 --> 01:05:43.873
It's no different than talking about ma-ha-ha-ha-a-ha.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:48.891
other than getting everybody listening to accept them in the first place.

01:05:48.951 --> 01:06:01.593
And now on PBS NewsHour, as has been going on for a very long time, because you can see the evidence in 2007 or eight from Jenny McCarthy that she cured her autistic kid.

01:06:03.933 --> 01:06:12.715
But in 2011, in the Los Angeles Times Parade Magazine, autism is a lost generation.

01:06:15.277 --> 01:06:19.959
And Harvard Magazine calls it a devastating disorder in 2008.

01:06:31.524 --> 01:06:36.305
Mind blindness, mind blindness, the understanding autism in 2002.

01:06:36.445 --> 01:06:37.766
I mean, no, this is in 2000.

01:06:42.042 --> 01:06:42.703
Weird, right?

01:06:42.843 --> 01:06:53.390
That autism, the idea of what it was, was being seeded right before, right at the same time that all this ramp up and talk about bioterror.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:07:03.318
Joe Biden is on ABC News saying that, you know, somebody with a little tiny container and talking down to the lady about bioweapons, bioweapons.

01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:09.221
It's a very interesting place we are in in American history.

01:07:09.261 --> 01:07:15.967
If we can see it correctly, I think we can save our grandkids, maybe even save a lot of grandkids around the world.

01:07:17.328 --> 01:07:18.469
My name is Cody Clifford.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:20.071
I'm on the autism spectrum.

01:07:20.752 --> 01:07:24.935
As somebody who's late diagnosed, it's a new prospect.

01:07:25.336 --> 01:07:29.740
Autism is not liking fairy ears and fairy wings.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.522
That's not autism at all.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:40.206
for me to be thinking about is how other people see me, how other people are, like, talking about autism issues in the media.

01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:46.810
I'm gonna try not to get too emotional about it, because it is, I think, overall really hurtful.

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.571
My name is Doris Smith.

01:07:49.752 --> 01:07:56.437
I have a son, a 30-year-old son named Jacob, who has been diagnosed with autistic behavior.

01:07:56.677 --> 01:08:00.180
We see the scratching, the biting, the inability to sleep.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:05.303
I've got holes in my walls that, you know, I'm tired of doing drywall.

01:08:06.043 --> 01:08:10.746
So does that other girl do drywall damage and stuff?

01:08:11.786 --> 01:08:13.647
That kid couldn't be on camera.

01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:16.909
I mean, do you see the problem we have here?

01:08:16.969 --> 01:08:19.450
Because they're not all the same problem.

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:21.752
It's not all the same phenomenon.

01:08:21.812 --> 01:08:27.535
But these people have been somehow convinced to tell you that it is all the same phenomenon.

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:29.850
It's just remarkable.

01:08:30.431 --> 01:08:36.376
We're talking about the human brain and human behavior and human cognition and language skills.

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:40.599
And, and, and these people are saying it's a spectrum.

01:08:40.619 --> 01:08:51.509
My name is Shamira Chaney and I have three beautiful, beautiful, awesome sons.

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.430
who are all on the autism spectrum.

01:08:54.610 --> 01:08:59.434
I do believe that all of my boys will be contributing members of society.

01:09:00.575 --> 01:09:02.918
They're all on the spectrum.

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:07.802
I mean, this is crazy shit right here.

01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:11.545
People have been told this.

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:12.466
She believes it.

01:09:12.506 --> 01:09:13.647
I'm sure she believes it.

01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:17.891
I'm not blaming her, but this is a dangerous place for America to be.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.271
You know, there was some comments made about, oh, they won't be able to play baseball.

01:09:23.351 --> 01:09:27.994
My son Eli runs track, a gold medalist, may I add, in track.

01:09:28.434 --> 01:09:30.335
He is a basketball player.

01:09:30.736 --> 01:09:33.097
I think he just recently told me I'm signing him up for soccer.

01:09:33.157 --> 01:09:37.640
I'm sorry, but just the boys fits right into Brian Hooker's narrative.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.802
It fits right into the script that I think Brian Hooker's gonna read at some point.

01:09:42.903 --> 01:09:45.524
Three boys, black boys, it fits perfect.

01:09:45.884 --> 01:09:46.825
I don't know what to tell you.

01:09:49.345 --> 01:09:50.606
and baseball this summer.

01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:52.447
So like he's thriving.

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:56.009
My name is Michael Wilson and I am neurodivergent.

01:09:56.309 --> 01:09:59.811
First of all, vaccines do not cause no divergence.

01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:01.892
We need to end that myth once and for all.

01:10:02.152 --> 01:10:03.853
I am neurodivergent.

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:10.377
I can't play stop lying because I don't think he's lying, but he's, he's wrong.

01:10:11.497 --> 01:10:17.601
I mean, neurodivergent is a new word designed to confuse.

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:36.010
It's designed to bunch a bunch of developmental trajectories gone wrong into one bundle, and then justify spending a bunch of money on that bundle, justify all kinds of remedies for that one bundle.

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:38.351
And it's all meaningless.

01:10:39.532 --> 01:10:46.936
Because we don't understand how his particular pattern integrity was disrupted when he was younger that resulted in what he calls neurodivergent.

01:10:49.548 --> 01:10:52.029
but let's just pretend for a second that they did.

01:10:52.129 --> 01:11:01.615
The fact that people would rather have a child die from a preventable disease than to have a neurodivergent child, it's just really heartbreaking to me.

01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:09.179
My name is Ciel Kiefer-Neal, and I am autistic, and I've also been diagnosed with ADHD.

01:11:09.559 --> 01:11:19.125
For someone to try and put a cap on our limitations and tell us what we are capable of doing,

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:22.424
It's insulting, it's dehumanizing.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:47.700
All of the language we've heard in the last couple of weeks from RFK Jr., it- She has a tattoo on her clavicle of a clavicle, which as far as I know as a skinny guy and I have a tattoo, I cannot imagine a worse place to choose to tattoo and nevermind the worst shape to choose.

01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:53.551
I'm going to tattoo the shape of my clavicle over my clavicle.

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:54.493
Isn't this the clavicle?

01:11:54.513 --> 01:11:54.993
I hope it is.

01:11:55.133 --> 01:11:55.694
I'm sorry.

01:11:55.714 --> 01:11:57.196
I'm not an anatomy expert.

01:11:57.797 --> 01:11:58.678
That's remarkable.

01:11:58.738 --> 01:12:02.483
I don't know very many autistic people that could handle getting a tattoo.

01:12:02.543 --> 01:12:05.967
That's... Wow.

01:12:06.668 --> 01:12:07.689
I don't even know what to say.

01:12:11.496 --> 01:12:13.098
Can you play that last guy again?

01:12:13.158 --> 01:12:14.639
I guess I can play the last guy again.

01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:14.879
Yeah.

01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:15.920
It has echoed.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:20.645
If you are advocating that I'm up for something, it should.

01:12:20.965 --> 01:12:24.869
But let's just pretend it's Michael Wilson and I am no divergent.

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:28.692
First of all, vaccines do not cause no divergence.

01:12:28.732 --> 01:12:30.774
We need to end that myth once and for all.

01:12:31.135 --> 01:12:33.617
But let's just pretend for a second that they did.

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:34.458
The fact that

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:41.120
people would rather have a child die from a preventable disease and to have a neurodivergent child.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.360
There you go.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400
I didn't, I missed that.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.362
So the choice is they either die of measles or they're retarded.

01:12:47.882 --> 01:12:54.884
So if you're, you'd rather have a dead kid versus a retarded kid, well, that's pretty lame because I'm retarded.

01:12:55.424 --> 01:12:55.704
It's like,

01:12:57.628 --> 01:13:01.829
I'm sorry, we're going to use that word because that's the only way that this works.

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:04.630
Like, come on, come on, come on.

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:05.631
This is silly.

01:13:05.651 --> 01:13:11.553
And we're letting this neurodivergent guy tell us what the trade-offs are?

01:13:11.993 --> 01:13:13.013
Give me a break.

01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:14.154
Wow.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.114
It's just really heartbreaking to me.

01:13:16.555 --> 01:13:23.657
My name is Ciel Kiefer Nail, and I am autistic, and I've also been diagnosed with ADHD.

01:13:24.197 --> 01:13:26.138
And she reads a shit ton of books.

01:13:27.605 --> 01:13:39.011
For someone to try and put a cap on our limitations and tell us what we are capable of doing, it's insulting.

01:13:39.171 --> 01:13:40.472
It's dehumanizing.

01:13:41.492 --> 01:13:46.115
All of the language we've heard in the last... Sorry, I had to allow that comment.

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.435
Wow, that's crazy.

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:50.357
A couple of weeks from RFK Jr.

01:13:52.998 --> 01:13:58.339
It has echoes of Nazi Germany and wanting to make a list of us.

01:13:58.699 --> 01:13:59.699
It's frightening.

01:14:00.899 --> 01:14:02.440
He wants to make a list of us.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.700
Well, Nicole Shanahan wants to make a detailed list.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.881
She wants the medical records of everybody.

01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:20.363
I think it's really important to consider the possibility that they actually want the medical records of everyone because without the medical records of everyone, then they won't actually have what they need.

01:14:21.872 --> 01:14:24.614
They don't just need a list of people with autism.

01:14:25.334 --> 01:14:30.378
They need a list of people with those problems so that they can remove them from the control group.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.581
Does that make sense?

01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:37.143
You have to remove those people from the control group.

01:14:41.486 --> 01:14:43.067
And they need the control group too.

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:47.850
The healthier you are, the more valuable you are as a control group.

01:14:50.066 --> 01:14:52.707
I don't think anybody understands that anymore.

01:14:52.767 --> 01:14:55.629
They may have already collected the data of the control group.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:01.251
They may have already all the control data they think they need.

01:15:05.273 --> 01:15:07.354
We're in a very dark place, ladies and gentlemen.

01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:13.662
So many of us are terrified, both for ourselves, for our family members.

01:15:13.682 --> 01:15:15.742
He has certain places he likes to go.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:17.803
He's Mr. GPS.

01:15:18.003 --> 01:15:20.663
So we have to go to those places in a certain way.

01:15:21.123 --> 01:15:27.305
God forbid if there's an accident or something is blocked off, then we get a rise in behavior.

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:34.746
And that rise in behavior can be everything from having a tantrum, to throwing things, to scratching.

01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:41.253
to repeating things over and over again, to even biting in some cases.

01:15:41.714 --> 01:15:42.997
Both of our cars have

01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:46.482
damage on the inside.

01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:53.565
There are so many ways that we could be supporting people with autism rather than focusing our energy on, like, do you see that over there?

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.405
You don't want your kid to be like that.

01:15:55.706 --> 01:16:04.289
See, so that was the argument that Polly Tommy and her daughter made for the first 10 or 12 years of their campaign after their son supposedly got autism.

01:16:04.869 --> 01:16:09.091
They didn't try to warn anybody about how to avoid it or what might have caused it.

01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:11.772
They've spent most of their time trying to raise awareness

01:16:12.742 --> 01:16:18.623
and to create job training programs and to make sure that teachers understood what autism was.

01:16:18.683 --> 01:16:25.684
And in fact, she was in a newspaper claiming that she cured her son's autism with secretin injections with Andrew Wakefield.

01:16:25.744 --> 01:16:39.107
So I don't really understand how it is that she's still a central player at CHD when somebody like Brian Hooker actually has a kid that is permanently damaged, like Paula Aitken has a kid that's permanently damaged.

01:16:39.147 --> 01:16:39.907
Paula Aitken

01:16:40.743 --> 01:16:56.055
is a parent that was in the original group of 12 children in the original Lancet paper that was also featured in this book, Callous Disregard, published by CHD's publisher, Sky Horse Publishing.

01:16:57.156 --> 01:17:01.119
Essentially, CHD is like the front group of this publisher.

01:17:01.179 --> 01:17:01.599
That's it.

01:17:01.759 --> 01:17:03.261
It's just like a joke to me now.

01:17:04.301 --> 01:17:06.063
I feel really just like a used

01:17:07.495 --> 01:17:09.377
used piece of garbage at this point.

01:17:09.817 --> 01:17:10.878
I was such a dupe.

01:17:11.699 --> 01:17:12.340
So duped.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.402
I don't know what the right word, way to say that is.

01:17:14.462 --> 01:17:18.125
How do we research and find out how to never have that happen again?

01:17:18.145 --> 01:17:21.309
That just seems really counterproductive to me.

01:17:21.369 --> 01:17:21.829
My daughter.

01:17:22.089 --> 01:17:22.430
Wow.

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:26.554
So why spend any time researching how to never have that happen again?

01:17:26.614 --> 01:17:30.758
Instead, we should waste all of our time providing for these people.

01:17:31.894 --> 01:17:32.814
She just said that.

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:37.636
Why would we waste any time trying to figure out how to make this not happen again?

01:17:37.676 --> 01:17:40.376
We should just try to find ways to deal with these people.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:52.820
It seems like very similar actually to what Peter McCullough said the other day with regard to febrile seizures and maybe if we just knew how to treat febrile seizures better that this autism epidemic would go down.

01:17:56.909 --> 01:18:01.053
Let's hear from this mom who's auditioning for future shows.

01:18:01.273 --> 01:18:07.760
Raelynn, she's not on the autism spectrum, but she is just so good with her brothers.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:14.146
I overheard a conversation that she was having with her friends and they were like, so, okay, so all your brothers have autism?

01:18:14.206 --> 01:18:15.007
And she's like, yeah.

01:18:15.787 --> 01:18:18.270
And the friends are asking like, oh, so what exactly is it?

01:18:18.567 --> 01:18:20.267
And she's like, they just do things differently.

01:18:20.307 --> 01:18:21.768
They do things their own way.

01:18:22.348 --> 01:18:23.969
And, you know, she spoke about it.

01:18:24.209 --> 01:18:31.511
I would almost be willing to bet dollars to donuts that I could take my daughter to one of those doctors and they would diagnose her as on the spectrum.

01:18:31.631 --> 01:18:35.192
I wonder how many kids can go into their office and not be on the spectrum.

01:18:36.632 --> 01:18:37.972
In such a positive light.

01:18:38.332 --> 01:18:42.014
And so I'm like, if an 11 year old girl can do it, come on.

01:18:42.294 --> 01:18:47.295
What, what the politicians, this administration, like, I need y'all to get it together.

01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:52.171
I am very excited at this initiative by Mr. Kennedy.

01:18:54.552 --> 01:18:56.152
This has been a long time coming.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:02.735
We've got a whole generation now going into a second generation that has been lost.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:10.118
And if this were any other concern, there would be programs, you know, somebody would be looking into it.

01:19:11.667 --> 01:19:14.248
We're made to accept that these things happen.

01:19:14.448 --> 01:19:14.848
It's genetic.

01:19:14.868 --> 01:19:24.371
You might argue in some ways that the opioid epidemic has been much more recently devastating than the autism epidemic, whatever it is.

01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:27.492
I mean, just to be frank.

01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:33.294
I think the reason why that is is because they use placebo a lot.

01:19:36.595 --> 01:19:40.756
Again, because the goal is to permanently

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:54.223
put in place public health as a reason, virology and PCR diagnostics as a science, and intramuscular injection as a methodology.

01:19:56.063 --> 01:19:59.724
So these people are not arguing their way out, they're arguing their way in.

01:20:01.104 --> 01:20:05.425
Medics, it's the environment, it's this, it's that, well show us.

01:20:05.525 --> 01:20:07.586
There's research that needs to be done into

01:20:08.854 --> 01:20:15.216
the differences between autistic people and neurotypical people, especially in the way of like health care.

01:20:15.236 --> 01:20:18.937
Because I have noticed that in my own journey, no one's doing research on that kind of stuff.

01:20:18.977 --> 01:20:20.438
And I think they need to be.

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:24.399
Instead, they're doing research into what causes autism.

01:20:24.559 --> 01:20:31.421
I want neurotypical people to know that neurodivergent people have beautiful, productive, and fulfilling lives.

01:20:32.023 --> 01:20:34.325
Our brains are wired differently.

01:20:34.365 --> 01:20:35.406
We think differently.

01:20:35.446 --> 01:20:36.767
We look at the world differently.

01:20:37.788 --> 01:20:39.029
Our senses are different.

01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:40.810
I mean, that's the big difference.

01:20:41.471 --> 01:20:51.099
And for them to think that we are a problem that needs to be solved, it, no, this is my life.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:58.746
And to be looked at this way by society, it's insane.

01:20:59.861 --> 01:21:02.182
for a look at how members of the autism community.

01:21:02.582 --> 01:21:06.044
That is extraordinary.

01:21:08.926 --> 01:21:24.514
Because if my parents think that I'm a wacko because I'm in this book, having worked for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., if they think I'm a wacko because I worked for CHD, and they are basing it on news programs like this, think about that.

01:21:26.395 --> 01:21:27.396
Think about that.

01:21:30.213 --> 01:21:40.635
To see this moment, I'm joined by Zoe Gross, Director of Advocacy at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a non-profit organization run by and for autistic individuals.

01:21:40.655 --> 01:21:42.876
Zoe, thank you so much for being here.

01:21:42.896 --> 01:21:44.116
Thank you for having me.

01:21:44.296 --> 01:21:55.358
When you hear those voices, do they represent part of the range of responses that you and your colleagues are hearing from members of the autistic community?

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:56.478
Absolutely.

01:21:56.559 --> 01:21:59.740
I think people have been really upset by the comments that they've been hearing.

01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:04.343
Things about autistic people not being able to do certain things.

01:22:04.823 --> 01:22:06.804
Talk like autism destroys families.

01:22:07.644 --> 01:22:09.966
No one wants their disability to be stigmatized.

01:22:10.006 --> 01:22:12.567
No one wants to be blamed for things going wrong in their family.

01:22:13.087 --> 01:22:16.530
or in society, it's very distressing to hear that kind of thing.

01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:22.136
And there's a lot of mistrust of the data collection effort that's going to be going forward.

01:22:22.576 --> 01:22:22.916
Yeah.

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:27.581
And let's take a step back, though, and talk about just what is autism spectrum disorder.

01:22:27.621 --> 01:22:30.363
This is a wide spectrum we're talking about.

01:22:31.324 --> 01:22:31.564
Sure.

01:22:31.644 --> 01:22:35.946
So autism is a disability that we're born with, and it affects us our whole lives.

01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:41.649
It affects how we think, how we move, how we learn, how we see the world, how we process sensory information.

01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:51.013
And that is a very curiously close to exactly the interpretation of infantile autism, but it was an incredibly rare thing.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:54.155
They all agreed it was an incredibly rare thing.

01:22:59.884 --> 01:23:12.087
And it had nothing to do with shitting on walls, or headbanging, or screaming, or no sleep, incontinence, violence, biting, nothing of that.

01:23:13.148 --> 01:23:14.468
Self-harm, none of that.

01:23:17.289 --> 01:23:21.310
That's the point you need to see here, and they're not talking about that either.

01:23:22.449 --> 01:23:24.051
They're not talking about SIDS.

01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:34.181
They're not talking about acute neurological damage hours or days after a set of intramuscular injections.

01:23:35.863 --> 01:23:44.212
And they specifically seeded that one guy in there to say, even if it was, I can't believe people would choose between having a retarded kid and a dead kid.

01:23:46.325 --> 01:23:49.768
That's what this message boils down to, and this is by design.

01:23:49.828 --> 01:23:58.195
It is exactly the same script, but it's the other half of the script.

01:23:58.515 --> 01:24:00.397
And this script is designed to rip.

01:24:01.297 --> 01:24:03.279
It's designed to tear America in half.

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:09.444
This might only be one part of the momentum that could tear America in half.

01:24:09.904 --> 01:24:15.089
If my neighbors are watching this, or my neighbors hear the social media version of this,

01:24:18.997 --> 01:24:25.126
And when we try to have a conversation about autism, and I start with, you know, autism spectrum disorder is kind of a myth.

01:24:25.847 --> 01:24:28.050
They're just going to think right away, stop lying.

01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:30.112
And then I'm lost.

01:24:31.014 --> 01:24:33.958
And that is how effective this military

01:24:35.672 --> 01:24:39.355
industrialized, you know, media control.

01:24:39.915 --> 01:24:41.856
It's bad, ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:41.896 --> 01:24:43.157
They have really got us.

01:24:43.898 --> 01:24:47.660
Because social media is a free-for-all, and mainstream media is gone.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:54.304
So, we are in big trouble, and if we acquiesce to letting our kids inherit this system, we're screwed.

01:24:54.745 --> 01:25:05.012
We need people like me, like Joe, like Mark, like anybody that's willing to go out there and speak their mind and try to figure out what's really going on, despite

01:25:05.852 --> 01:25:12.442
the militarized program social control suites that have been deployed on our civilization.

01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:16.452
It affects the way our brains organize information.

01:25:16.472 --> 01:25:19.014
It affects our communication.

01:25:19.074 --> 01:25:22.456
We may not speak or we may speak using scripts or a device.

01:25:23.677 --> 01:25:25.919
It affects the way we socialize with other people.

01:25:25.939 --> 01:25:42.471
I mean, imagine saying that autism can range from a series of awkwardness and from awkwardness and extreme intelligence all the way to incontinence and psychotic behavior and inability to learn at a toddler level.

01:25:44.271 --> 01:25:45.753
And I'm on that spectrum.

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:49.036
I'm the same as them and I'm the same as them.

01:25:49.717 --> 01:25:51.118
Imagine thinking that.

01:25:52.739 --> 01:25:57.604
That would be like me saying that, you know, being fat is a spectrum and I'm also fat.

01:25:57.764 --> 01:26:01.087
I'm just not as fat as everybody else is, but I'm also fat.

01:26:01.107 --> 01:26:02.829
I got the same fat that you have.

01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:06.192
So I deserve the same amount of sympathy as somebody who's 400 pounds.

01:26:08.206 --> 01:26:11.389
I know that's kind of a weak analogy, but you see my point.

01:26:11.489 --> 01:26:25.260
The spectrum of overweight, the spectrum of autism, this is an absurdity beyond absurd with a lack of specificity that should constantly have a laugh track behind it.

01:26:33.857 --> 01:26:37.762
And that's the point I want to make with the fat versus skinny thing.

01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:41.708
It's a lack of specificity if you say that everybody's on the fat spectrum.

01:26:42.689 --> 01:26:43.670
Everybody's obese.

01:26:44.652 --> 01:26:47.255
Or anyone can potentially be obese.

01:26:47.335 --> 01:26:48.377
It depends how they feel.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:27:03.655
I mean, they have no justification for their classification as on the spectrum, except for some highly unscientific pseudo professional has told them they are.

01:27:05.895 --> 01:27:07.216
That's the remarkable thing.

01:27:07.316 --> 01:27:11.417
And somebody like Nicole Shanahan is arguing for certain

01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:20.873
solutions that include highly technical and specific diagnostic tests, which are glorified genetic screens.

01:27:22.254 --> 01:27:24.576
And here you have the slippery slope.

01:27:24.596 --> 01:27:26.278
Well, I don't want you to make that list.

01:27:26.358 --> 01:27:27.319
I want to make a list.

01:27:27.359 --> 01:27:28.280
Don't make the data.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.281
Don't collect the data.

01:27:29.341 --> 01:27:30.221
I want the data.

01:27:30.622 --> 01:27:35.166
And we're going to argue and argue and argue and never really identify what's actually happening.

01:27:35.206 --> 01:27:36.067
It's already done.

01:27:36.107 --> 01:27:37.348
They're already collecting it.

01:27:38.766 --> 01:27:43.029
The PCR test allowed them to collect it from everybody that submitted.

01:27:45.271 --> 01:27:46.532
And it's still going on today.

01:27:46.572 --> 01:28:08.469
It's an accepted gold standard diagnostic and that is just... That's one of the biggest jokes on our kids right now is PCR diagnostics being accepted in the medical community as working and valid and real and not just generating a remnant stream that the Human Genome Project is finally technically capable of using.

01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:15.146
And it affects that we may need help day to day with things like dressing, bathing or daily routines.

01:28:16.147 --> 01:28:20.031
Does she need help dressing or bathing or daily routines?

01:28:20.051 --> 01:28:21.652
Does she need help wiping her ass?

01:28:21.692 --> 01:28:27.478
Because I don't understand how she can think she's on the same spectrum as people who do.

01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:29.280
That's fucked up.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.763
I'm sorry, I got to use that word, but that's really screwed up.

01:28:34.298 --> 01:28:42.385
That is really screwed up if she thinks she's on the same spectrum as Brian Hooker's kid or Paula Aitken's kid, because that's gross.

01:28:45.147 --> 01:28:51.773
And I don't think that it's right that our society has weaponized this idea to the point where these people believe that.

01:28:51.873 --> 01:28:52.914
That's terrible.

01:28:54.725 --> 01:29:01.247
And HHS Secretary Kennedy said recently, and I'm quoting from him now, most cases now are severe.

01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:08.668
25% of the kids who are diagnosed with autism are nonverbal, non-toilet trained, and have other stereotypical features.

01:29:09.209 --> 01:29:13.130
Does that match what your organization tracks on this level?

01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:14.290
And also,

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:20.211
Does it represent the perception and the experience of some parts of the autism community?

01:29:20.251 --> 01:29:22.732
And I'm wondering if you can speak to that as well.

01:29:23.252 --> 01:29:34.395
So what he's referring to is that the CDC did a study which showed that of all autistic people, 25% either are non-speaking, are minimally speaking, or have a measured IQ that's under 50.

01:29:34.815 --> 01:29:39.256
Now, it's very difficult to measure the IQ of many autistic people reliably, so take all this with a grain of salt.

01:29:41.116 --> 01:29:44.837
It's that group of three different populations that he's grouping together.

01:29:44.917 --> 01:29:50.599
And when he says no one in that group is toilet trained, there's no studies to back that up.

01:29:51.499 --> 01:29:54.540
And to make other generalizations about that group I think would be unwise.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.401
All we know about them is those three things.

01:29:57.581 --> 01:29:59.142
That is so awful.

01:30:00.583 --> 01:30:03.865
Essentially, what they are doing is the same thing that CHD is doing.

01:30:04.326 --> 01:30:11.330
They're bundling all this together when there are incredibly devastating examples that include dead babies.

01:30:14.152 --> 01:30:29.823
That's the part that autism makes so screwed up, is because if we are right at GigaOM Biological and at Heucytonic ITS and at the Liberty Perspective, and these three guys at least seem to agree with me that intramuscular injection might actually just be dumb.

01:30:32.378 --> 01:30:41.825
then SIDS is the same as a damaged child in the same category of crime.

01:30:42.725 --> 01:30:44.267
Some die, some don't.

01:30:46.368 --> 01:30:58.557
And the fact is, is that when we start talking to these people about autism in this way about autism and start confounding this autism with a bunch of other conditions and developmental trajectories,

01:31:01.226 --> 01:31:15.185
then we really, really, really are being lied to in the most malevolent way possible by people who don't have a damn clue about how the pattern integrity that is your mind and body develops.

01:31:16.824 --> 01:31:18.465
ideally through time.

01:31:18.985 --> 01:31:38.877
And that is an argument that Joshua Lederberg made already a long time ago, that we can't possibly think that understanding the genetic code could yield any useful information if we have no idea how to optimize the development of the pattern integrity from, you know, conception to adult.

01:31:39.892 --> 01:31:47.497
The optimization of that trajectory would be necessarily relevant to understanding what the genome encoded.

01:31:49.619 --> 01:31:55.184
I mean, just imagine the worst case scenario where because we're not eating the right food, none of the men grow horns.

01:31:55.824 --> 01:32:02.350
And if we suddenly ate the right food and did the right exercise from very early on, most men would grow horns.

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:17.023
Well, that would be a pretty exceptional discovery to find that our genes could change their expression and their trajectory across time just by treating the trajectory across time differently.

01:32:17.972 --> 01:32:21.473
training kids younger at different things or whatever the case may be.

01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:47.338
Now, I understand that that's a little bit of a ridiculous thing, but the subtle differences in the way a child might develop into adult with given one thing or another thing, another one set of circumstances or another, would necessarily be a prerequisite to understanding what potentially could be coded in whatever thing you think you're decoding.

01:32:48.433 --> 01:32:59.381
And as I pointed out many times before, we have never found a hint of coding for how the thing is built and how it is developed across time.

01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:08.207
So understanding that some of this DNA codes for proteins, or at least it seems to, is an elaborate illusion in terms of understanding.

01:33:08.247 --> 01:33:17.234
The implications are not that now evolution is real and we can all go rest assured that scientists in the future are going to crack this puzzle, because that's not the way it is.

01:33:20.365 --> 01:33:29.591
What he's trying to do is to inspire panic and fear and make people very worried about the possibility of autism in their family or just, you know, about autism in society.

01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:31.312
And that doesn't help autistic people.

01:33:31.532 --> 01:33:36.876
We are in a moment where there's a lot of talk about what the government can and should do when it comes to autism.

01:33:37.256 --> 01:33:38.417
So where do you come down on this?

01:33:38.537 --> 01:33:40.918
What should the federal government be doing?

01:33:41.038 --> 01:33:45.001
Where are there more resources needed and where can government

01:33:46.222 --> 01:33:47.383
play a role in your view?

01:33:47.863 --> 01:33:53.909
So one of the biggest ways that the government could help autistic people today is by expanding Medicaid home and community-based services.

01:33:54.389 --> 01:33:56.251
This is a waiver service through Medicaid.

01:33:57.292 --> 01:34:01.295
States are not required to provide it, so when there are cuts to Medicaid, this is the first thing to go.

01:34:01.696 --> 01:34:05.199
But these are the services that help people live their daily lives, help people

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:16.843
you know, live in the community, do things they need, like transportation, help with daily routines, shopping, cooking, other stuff that means that they can live in their own home instead of in an institution.

01:34:17.244 --> 01:34:26.106
Without these services, either people are forced to go into an institution or someone is forced to leave their job to care for them unpaid, which can really strain many families financially.

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:31.928
So these are life-saving services, and right now they're on the chopping block.

01:34:32.048 --> 01:34:33.989
One thing the government could do is protect these services.

01:34:34.249 --> 01:34:42.496
A lot of people moved to Pennsylvania because we have a lot more public services dedicated to autistic kids in our school system.

01:34:42.536 --> 01:34:43.516
I know that for sure.

01:34:45.838 --> 01:34:54.125
I see something in the chat from Catherine Organic that micro RNA expressed in waves changing expression through time is where a lot of research is ongoing right now.

01:34:55.044 --> 01:35:10.007
I just want to expand that thought a little bit in the sense of thinking about having reached the limit of what we can really understand from a molecular biological perspective from our previously used models.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.068
I'm just riffing today, man.

01:35:15.108 --> 01:35:16.289
I don't care anymore.

01:35:16.469 --> 01:35:17.109
I'm just riffing.

01:35:20.487 --> 01:35:27.631
So if you think about evolution and you think about where we are and you just give them that maybe there were animals before us.

01:35:27.872 --> 01:35:30.073
I don't, I don't, I don't want to

01:35:32.298 --> 01:35:32.838
How do I say it?

01:35:32.958 --> 01:35:35.259
I don't want to debate evolution right now.

01:35:35.299 --> 01:35:37.479
I'm just going to make a really short phylogenetic tree.

01:35:37.519 --> 01:35:40.680
We all started from, you know, one thing apparently.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:52.342
And then we all got together and now there's animals A, B, C, D, E, and F. And one of them is, you know, this is bacteria and this is yeast.

01:35:53.323 --> 01:35:54.623
And then these are insects.

01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:02.236
And these are reptiles, I guess, or something like that.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:02.617
I don't know.

01:36:02.657 --> 01:36:03.418
And amphibians.

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:04.980
And then we have mammals up here.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.423
How do we do mammals?

01:36:08.205 --> 01:36:08.745
Like a mouse?

01:36:08.866 --> 01:36:09.146
I don't know.

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:13.095
What is a mouse?

01:36:13.135 --> 01:36:14.015
How do you draw a mouse?

01:36:14.115 --> 01:36:18.197
Shouldn't they have like a... Anyway, I can't do it on the camera.

01:36:19.177 --> 01:36:27.740
So you have this phylogenetic tree and the reality is that this phylogenetic tree has been weaponized against us.

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.481
And how is it weaponized against us?

01:36:29.561 --> 01:36:35.163
Because they want you to believe that molecular techniques that are found down here

01:36:36.917 --> 01:36:41.503
apply to animals that are up here because we're all connected by this tree.

01:36:41.943 --> 01:36:55.259
But if this tree doesn't really exist, if this Darwinian evolutionary process that started from a mud puddle and then reaches all the way to here is not an explanation for creation,

01:36:56.630 --> 01:37:08.695
for whatever it is our existence is, then this presupposition, which is that molecular biology that we can learn here applies to molecular biology here because the same chemicals are in a cat.

01:37:10.556 --> 01:37:13.478
Cat has DNA and a bacteria has DNA.

01:37:13.758 --> 01:37:20.581
So anything that we do with bacteria and DNA must obviously apply, or in bacteria must obviously apply to the DNA in a cat.

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:22.602
And that is only

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:35.963
Presupposed because the evolutionary tree is presupposed And so evolution because DNA right that's the that's the thing I keep repeating evolution evolution

01:37:45.017 --> 01:37:45.237
Right?

01:37:45.337 --> 01:37:46.658
Evolution because DNA.

01:37:46.758 --> 01:37:50.561
And that is where this phylogenetic tree comes from.

01:37:50.621 --> 01:37:51.741
That's where this comes from.

01:37:51.802 --> 01:38:01.288
And that's also where what Mark and I have been kind of exploring independently and parallel is where all this nonce... Oh, I took the book back upstairs because I'm still reading it.

01:38:01.748 --> 01:38:10.374
Where this stuff comes from, where all of these physicists converted to biology after the Manhattan Project and brought all of their assumptions

01:38:11.536 --> 01:38:22.866
all of their techniques, all of their preconceived notions about how life must emerge from sort of this particle probability type thing.

01:38:25.103 --> 01:38:31.145
And a lot of these people who went into phage biology actually went into it after reading this book.

01:38:31.386 --> 01:38:40.749
In fact, the book that I showed you yesterday where Leo Szilard is going to University of Chicago with this other person and they're converting to biology in that book, they're talking about it.

01:38:41.530 --> 01:38:50.153
One of the essays that I just read yesterday starts out with the idea that this book inspired this person as a physicist to convert to biology, this book right here.

01:38:52.403 --> 01:38:56.464
That's what brought him to work with Delbruck and all these guys that were working on phages.

01:38:56.524 --> 01:39:06.508
It's remarkable that this biological history and this sort of mentor chain is completely lost in the American consciousness.

01:39:06.548 --> 01:39:10.169
And if it wasn't for my friend, Mark Kulak, I don't know if I would have found it so easily.

01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:13.611
But I'm definitely there now and I'm very excited about it.

01:39:13.671 --> 01:39:19.553
And I do think this is a wonderful way to think about why so much of what we've found in this

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:29.942
area of our study is being weaponized against us by assuming that what we find here is applicable here.

01:39:30.942 --> 01:39:31.622
And it's not.

01:39:32.022 --> 01:39:46.145
More importantly, if we take DNA that we make here, and we put it up here, and we get proteins, that doesn't mean that we understand what's happening in this animal.

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.344
But we do know that that works.

01:39:51.305 --> 01:39:53.547
That's called transformation and transfection.

01:39:54.348 --> 01:40:01.555
We also know that we can make RNA down here, and we can take that and we can put it up here, and we'll get protein.

01:40:02.056 --> 01:40:05.179
And that's called transfection for sure, and we've been doing it for a long time.

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:07.422
But it doesn't mean that we understand

01:40:09.702 --> 01:40:24.690
what a cat is as a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time because we can sequence some of its DNA, or we can amplify some of its DNA using molecular tools from this toolbox, which is all we can do.

01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:37.917
All the Human Genome Project did was industrialize the toolbox of molecular enzymes that were found and identified in E. coli and other targeted molecular organisms.

01:40:39.778 --> 01:40:40.158
That's it.

01:40:40.999 --> 01:40:41.539
Nothing more.

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.101
It's restriction enzymes.

01:40:43.461 --> 01:40:45.282
All are enzymes that are found.

01:40:45.503 --> 01:40:49.306
The no-see-um technique of Barak is all based on stuff down here.

01:40:50.046 --> 01:41:01.115
Prion disease is based on stuff that is done in yeast and assumed to recapitulate something that supposedly occurs in higher animals, but there's no recapitulating happening.

01:41:01.175 --> 01:41:01.856
It's just a myth.

01:41:03.058 --> 01:41:14.343
Again, the reason why that myth exists is because all the biologists in academia accept the phylogenetic tree that goes back to a mud puddle and a lightning bolt.

01:41:15.864 --> 01:41:27.789
And because they accept that, then they also accept the presupposition that the molecular basis of the existence of life is the same for all branches of the tree.

01:41:29.358 --> 01:41:37.041
The molecular rules that govern bacteria are the same molecular rules that govern the inheritance in higher animals.

01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:47.084
And that might not be true if you see that the definition of a pattern integrity is not yeast or a bacteria.

01:41:49.628 --> 01:41:58.330
and that everything above this, including plants, require a symbiosis with these type of organisms in order to exist.

01:41:58.910 --> 01:42:13.153
And so, the pattern integrities that we think about as biology, mammals, insects, birds, are complex pattern integrities that have a hyper symbiosis with bacteria that include mitochondria in their cells.

01:42:13.213 --> 01:42:15.193
Mitochondria have their own ribosomes.

01:42:15.233 --> 01:42:16.454
I don't know if you knew that before.

01:42:16.474 --> 01:42:17.694
They have their own DNA.

01:42:20.914 --> 01:42:24.247
and the bacteria in the gut, the bacteria in the soil.

01:42:26.778 --> 01:42:30.779
And that symbiosis is what allows these organisms to exist.

01:42:30.859 --> 01:42:39.041
And so the molecular rules and the hereditary rules that govern these animals are obviously much more complex.

01:42:39.741 --> 01:42:52.744
And the molecular limitations are much different than what we would find when studying these organisms, which are just a small part of the symbiosis that makes this possible.

01:42:54.605 --> 01:43:09.908
And again, remember, this whole concept is lost if you see all of these life forms as having descended from a common ancestor and therefore sharing common molecular mechanisms instead of seeing them as emergent properties.

01:43:10.628 --> 01:43:14.008
Insects are emergent properties of bacteria.

01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:22.690
And plants are emergent properties, emergent phenomenon from the existence of bacteria.

01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:35.092
And an abundant and diverse bacterial flora is the foundation of all of these pattern integrities.

01:43:35.152 --> 01:43:47.305
If there is an advance that you can see in land-based pattern integrities, then it would be that they can carry around this compost heap inside of them instead of needing to be embedded in it like a plant is.

01:43:48.151 --> 01:44:00.443
But the same nutrient exchange between the external, if you will, bacterial components and the nutrient exchange there, the symbiosis is the same in the roots as it is in our gut.

01:44:02.961 --> 01:44:11.207
And of course, plants also have this extra sort of symbiont, these chloroplasts, which are also derived from a bacterial construction.

01:44:11.267 --> 01:44:22.314
So again, we're looking at a sort of hyper symbiosis that allows us to exist that therefore does not support the idea of this phylogenetic tree.

01:44:22.434 --> 01:44:28.739
And once you throw this phylogenetic tree away, then you can reorganize your understanding of how this biology emerges from the layers.

01:44:30.506 --> 01:44:40.974
But what's interesting is that what else reinforced this molecular phylogenetic tree of evolution was, of course, SARS-CoV-2.

01:44:42.355 --> 01:44:51.282
And the huge story that they told us for the last five years about its molecular evolution and how that is the foundation of all evolution.

01:44:51.722 --> 01:44:55.265
Of course, you have to accept it because evolution is real because we found DNA.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.758
Wow, this is completely impromptu.

01:44:58.799 --> 01:45:01.441
I didn't expect this to come out of my brain right now.

01:45:01.501 --> 01:45:05.283
So, you know, thank somebody else, not me.

01:45:05.384 --> 01:45:05.864
Here we go.

01:45:08.366 --> 01:45:11.068
What do you want people to know about living with autism?

01:45:11.128 --> 01:45:12.149
How has it affected your life?

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.264
Yeah, so what I want people to know is that autistic people may need different supports than non-autistic people.

01:45:19.064 --> 01:45:21.746
It's very important that we have those supports, those accommodations.

01:45:22.147 --> 01:45:30.152
That can mean the difference between whether or not we can live in the community, whether or not we can go to school with our peers, whether or not we can work a job in the community as opposed to in a sheltered workshop.

01:45:31.333 --> 01:45:35.156
Making those accommodations for us is the difference between including and excluding us.

01:45:35.956 --> 01:45:42.181
So if you see someone, for example, wearing headphones in a crowded area or someone at a job with a job coat,

01:45:42.281 --> 01:45:45.403
Yes, Christy, this person talking is on the spectrum.

01:45:47.145 --> 01:45:54.410
Or if someone asks for accommodations in housing or at work, I want you to think about that as the way that autistic people are included in society.

01:45:55.231 --> 01:45:58.013
Zoe Gross at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network.

01:45:58.053 --> 01:45:59.294
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:45:59.554 --> 01:46:00.315
Thank you for having me.

01:46:00.415 --> 01:46:03.017
She had a real hard time looking at, not looking at the camera.

01:46:03.037 --> 01:46:06.400
She broke that, she broke it like four times.

01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:19.172
So anyway, that's what I see coming.

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:22.215
And this would be about injection versus ingestion, right?

01:46:22.235 --> 01:46:25.557
It would be about intramuscular injection not being medicine.

01:46:26.258 --> 01:46:34.424
And I think they put a lot of these people in place to tell us that the who was important and that the COVID vaccines are bad, but to make sure that the murder

01:46:35.445 --> 01:46:45.772
and lies that was happening in 2020 and 2021 that was used to convince the rest of the world of the pandemic coming, those are covered up by these traitorous organizations.

01:46:45.933 --> 01:46:51.537
And they include foreign organizations like Heart, this is one of the worst ones, Panda, also terrible.

01:46:52.717 --> 01:46:57.001
Just a bunch of real posers here.

01:46:57.461 --> 01:47:00.043
And we're told to focus on all these people,

01:47:00.983 --> 01:47:09.511
Even the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a front group for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundational Trust.

01:47:09.551 --> 01:47:13.094
That's the real weaponized pile of money that nobody talks about.

01:47:14.475 --> 01:47:15.977
All of these companies are tiny.

01:47:17.168 --> 01:47:29.515
compared to the tech conglomerates that are now controlling social media and the potential that they have for controlling world governments, selling to the highest bidder their ability to control the narrative.

01:47:29.535 --> 01:47:31.176
And it's all because we gave it to them.

01:47:31.256 --> 01:47:34.578
We are acquiescing to the use of these platforms.

01:47:34.618 --> 01:47:39.281
We're producing content on these platforms and allowing them to decide what's seen

01:47:39.861 --> 01:47:47.046
And so if you want to beat them, you got to start using email again and emailing people with real links and telling them, watch this and nothing else.

01:47:47.967 --> 01:47:53.191
And if I have to, I mean, to make the PeerTube better so that it plays better, that people can download easier.

01:47:53.731 --> 01:48:01.697
But remember, PeerTube allows you to download, so you can even download it, put it in the background, and when it's done downloading, watch it offline.

01:48:02.389 --> 01:48:03.931
In fact, I encourage you to do that.

01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:17.645
I encourage you to download it and then open your own YouTube channel called Giga Ohm Mirror and start putting up the stream after I do somewhere else on the internet.

01:48:17.685 --> 01:48:18.166
Why not?

01:48:19.047 --> 01:48:23.932
Because that's the only way we will beat them is if we make it so that

01:48:25.330 --> 01:48:28.892
What they are now weaponizing against us is weaponized against them.

01:48:29.392 --> 01:48:30.953
I don't know exactly how to do it yet.

01:48:31.013 --> 01:48:33.294
Maybe there's a way we can use AI against them, I don't know.

01:48:34.514 --> 01:48:45.599
So what I've got here is a video that I think I'm gonna leave until tomorrow because it's 1.47 in the stream here and I don't wanna, but it is the title of the video.

01:48:45.639 --> 01:48:52.963
The title of the show today was Harvard Does Belmont and that's the Belmont Report.

01:48:54.165 --> 01:49:03.572
And that is a pretty seminal bioethics document that is the result of a lot of funding and a lot of meetings and many years of meetings and discussions.

01:49:05.153 --> 01:49:09.656
And it is essentially one of the more important bioethics documents in American

01:49:10.726 --> 01:49:11.807
literature, let's say.

01:49:12.628 --> 01:49:27.039
And I've done several streams about it, especially in 2020 and 2021 in the context of Christine Grady and how she does a lot of ethics presentations without ever mentioning the Belmont Report as being important.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:33.865
And so don't get the Belmont Report confused with the Belford Declaration, but the Belmont Report

01:49:34.765 --> 01:49:39.769
is the ethics report that I think it came out in the 70s, but it might even be the 80s.

01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:52.318
And it is really fundamental to understanding what I think is the legal basis for getting rid of the PrEP Act, the legal basis for, you know, calling people what they are, which is murderers.

01:49:53.573 --> 01:49:55.415
but they're not gonna talk about it that way.

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:58.598
Harvard's might not even tell you what the document actually is.

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:04.524
So maybe I'll just watch the first five or 10 minutes of it to see if I'm correct about my feeling of what's gonna happen here.

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:07.868
And then if it's significant enough, maybe we'll watch it tomorrow.

01:50:07.908 --> 01:50:10.651
Otherwise, we're just gonna move on to more important things tomorrow.

01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:11.592
Let's just see how it works.

01:50:20.066 --> 01:50:20.566
Welcome.

01:50:21.386 --> 01:50:25.707
I'm Rebecca Brindel, Director of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School.

01:50:26.367 --> 01:50:32.248
I'll be your moderator today for this critical and timely discussion on trust and ethics in public health.

01:50:33.249 --> 01:50:46.151
Joining me today are David Augustin-Hodge, the Interim Director and Associate Professor of the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Healthcare at Tuskegee University, Evelyn Hammonds,

01:50:46.584 --> 01:50:54.026
Barbara Gutmann Rosenkranz, professor of the history of science and professor of African and African American studies at Harvard University.

01:50:54.186 --> 01:50:55.786
Professor of the history of science.

01:50:55.866 --> 01:51:15.070
I bet she doesn't know jack all about the the mentor chain that goes from the Manhattan Project into molecular biology and bacteriophages right into AIDS and chronic fatigue and the vaccine agronomy right up into Robert Malone and

01:51:16.194 --> 01:51:28.723
and Judy Mikovits and Mary Holland and Stephen Hatfield, which is actually, I think, who we're going to watch tomorrow as the study hall because he's done this recent interview that's just extraordinary.

01:51:28.743 --> 01:51:34.868
University and professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health.

01:51:36.112 --> 01:51:44.018
and Alan Brandt, Professor of the History of Science and Annaleigh Moses Cass Professor of the History of Medicine at Harvard University.

01:51:44.599 --> 01:51:45.880
Thank you all for being here.

01:51:48.042 --> 01:51:53.866
I wanna start with some important framing for our audience, some of whom may be learning this material for the first time.

01:51:54.727 --> 01:51:59.431
It goes back to 1978, well, actually before, but we'll put ourselves in 1978.

01:51:59.551 --> 01:52:05.536
It was before because I think it's the result of like five years or four years of meetings.

01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:18.216
After four years of work, a National Commission of Physicians, Lawyers, and Scientists released what is now known as the Belmont Report, laying out ethical principles for research with human participants.

01:52:19.497 --> 01:52:34.798
One catalyst for this work was the revelation that for more than 40 years, the United States Public Health Service and the CDC had conducted a study in which researchers observed the effects of untreated syphilis in nearly 400 African American men.

01:52:36.673 --> 01:52:52.695
Wow, so after all of this malfeasance, they took four years to outline the ethics of using human subjects in experimentation, and instead of talking about what they found and the conclusions they came to,

01:52:53.416 --> 01:53:00.498
This poser is starting with the bullshit that brought about the whole thing in the first place.

01:53:00.578 --> 01:53:07.900
The only reason why the Belmont Commission was established and the Belmont Report was produced was because of that bullshit.

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.760
It's not in the report.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.201
The report exists because of crap like that.

01:53:13.461 --> 01:53:16.782
And she's not really saying that correctly if I hear her right.

01:53:17.242 --> 01:53:21.203
This, despite the easy availability of medicine to treat them,

01:53:22.196 --> 01:53:30.158
The men who were enticed to participate in the study with the promise of free medical care were never informed of their diagnosis.

01:53:31.278 --> 01:53:39.700
By the time the study was shut down in 1972, more than 100 patients had died of syphilis or its complications.

01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.420
She reads about as well as Casey means.

01:53:43.141 --> 01:53:45.521
And dozens of their wives became infected.

01:53:45.541 --> 01:53:49.222
19 children were born with congenital syphilis.

01:53:50.771 --> 01:54:03.062
Now, close to five decades after the Belmont Report was published, it's time to look back at what it has meant for ethics and trust in public health and medicine, and to consider the work that's still left to do.

01:54:04.783 --> 01:54:12.450
David, you've been spending a lot of time thinking about research ethics and healthcare ethics.

01:54:36.101 --> 01:54:37.462
crazy.

01:54:37.542 --> 01:54:39.922
I really hope they don't blow it, because I'm going to get pissed.

01:54:40.043 --> 01:54:44.004
And you've been working to create a Tuskegee response to the Belmont Report.

01:54:44.604 --> 01:54:46.465
Tell us what that means and what it's all about.

01:54:47.665 --> 01:54:48.986
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:54:49.006 --> 01:54:49.986
Good afternoon, family.

01:54:50.026 --> 01:54:51.587
And it's just so good to be here.

01:54:51.687 --> 01:54:52.507
Thank you, Becca.

01:54:52.968 --> 01:54:53.948
Thank you, Emily.

01:54:54.488 --> 01:54:56.509
Good afternoon, family.

01:54:59.961 --> 01:55:05.042
and all of those who worked together to make this opportunity possible.

01:55:05.242 --> 01:55:09.123
So we can have a conversation on this very amazing question.

01:55:09.803 --> 01:55:24.326
The Belmont Report did and was supposed to do a remarkable job in responding to not just those men in the syphilis study, but in terms of research,

01:55:25.186 --> 01:55:30.313
in terms of human subjects and how they should be cared for and cared about.

01:55:31.114 --> 01:55:32.476
That was its responsibility.

01:55:33.417 --> 01:55:42.929
Here we are 50 years later and we see that excess deaths categories are still ruled by the same pigmentation of those who were in the syphilis study.

01:55:43.928 --> 01:55:53.957
black men and black people are still dying at a faster rate in every one of the excess deaths categories.

01:55:54.698 --> 01:56:09.492
It terrifies me to think that this, what he's saying right now, could be distorted by the claims of William Thompson and Brian Hooker into the idea that the vaccine schedule is the result of this.

01:56:10.461 --> 01:56:16.383
or rather this is the result of the vaccine schedule because it harms black people, black boys in particular.

01:56:17.044 --> 01:56:28.128
And so we have to wonder to what extent the Belmont Report, as excellent as a project it was, doesn't it need to be interrogated to ensure that we get closer to where we need to be?

01:56:30.396 --> 01:56:42.891
So we have to actually question whether the Belmont Report is where we need it to be, whether it got us where we need it to be, without actually thinking about what the Belmont Report says?

01:56:42.911 --> 01:56:43.852
Wow.

01:56:43.933 --> 01:56:46.816
Trials, for example, we still have low participation.

01:56:48.075 --> 01:57:09.012
And though there's low participation, I am really wondering are the factors or the actions that are being done to increase participation in clinical trials, are they considering all of the nuances that may be involved in why many will not be participatory?

01:57:09.753 --> 01:57:20.836
So even though good actions are present, one wonders whether or not those good actions are missing some critical points, like what kind of access are present for the good actions.

01:57:21.237 --> 01:57:26.638
For example, if we live in, if we want to do critical trials with people who live in rural communities.

01:57:27.699 --> 01:57:38.742
Clinical trials with people who live in rural communities, is he not talking about turning the entire population into test subjects and how we can ethically do it?

01:57:40.828 --> 01:57:43.330
Is he not directly talking about that?

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:44.310
And what?

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:45.771
He's from what?

01:57:46.191 --> 01:57:47.912
Gonna write a response from who?

01:57:48.533 --> 01:57:49.093
For the what?

01:57:50.574 --> 01:58:03.682
What is happening here other than the exact same bullshit that Tony Fauci's wife does when she gives a presentation about community medicine or communal medicine or communal ethics in public health?

01:58:06.468 --> 01:58:11.091
This is extremely terrifying because this is the other side, right?

01:58:11.111 --> 01:58:12.992
This is the side that wore the masks.

01:58:13.073 --> 01:58:17.275
This is the side that believes in the systemic racism.

01:58:17.315 --> 01:58:22.039
This is the side that would put us in a camp, quite frankly.

01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:23.555
Yikes.

01:58:24.035 --> 01:58:27.677
And a large population of black people, particularly those that live in rural communities.

01:58:28.057 --> 01:58:33.579
If you want to do clinical trials, have we given due consideration to what access means?

01:58:34.039 --> 01:58:38.861
Like access to transportation, access to child care, access to food and food securities.

01:58:39.242 --> 01:58:41.663
So these are stuff that they deal with on a regular basis.

01:58:41.703 --> 01:58:48.305
So if there is no access, then to what extent can we say that the action is legitimate?

01:58:48.645 --> 01:58:52.527
So we have to raise questions about the kinds of things that on the GERD

01:58:52.967 --> 01:58:56.891
what we think is good morality in access.

01:58:57.371 --> 01:59:06.199
So we know about the social political health, we know about political determinants of health, and my dear brother Lachlan right here, I've been talking for quite a bit on moral determinants of health.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:10.544
To what extent are we serious about the moral determinants?

01:59:10.664 --> 01:59:12.906
The moral determinants of health.

01:59:13.982 --> 01:59:17.303
is a frighteningly aspecific phrase.

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:23.104
I don't know what any of the word combinations he said for the last minute means.

01:59:23.324 --> 01:59:39.188
Tuskegee Report is what I would call a black bioethics approach to interrogate the Belmont Report to see to what extent the factors and the features in the Belmont Report are consistent with the kinds of things we need to be considering.

01:59:39.628 --> 01:59:40.268
for example.

01:59:40.288 --> 01:59:41.389
It's ridiculous.

01:59:41.489 --> 01:59:50.971
They are questioning a document that forms the foundation of bioethics as we know it without addressing what specific little tweaks it needs to be made.

01:59:51.692 --> 01:59:59.354
That would be like going and just saying willy-nilly that the Nuremberg Accord is something that we need to reconsider.

01:59:59.454 --> 02:00:07.676
Maybe we didn't quite get to the finish line with the Nuremberg Accord because we're interested in testing rural populations.

02:00:08.057 --> 02:00:09.197
How does that make sense?

02:00:11.035 --> 02:00:12.396
but that's an equivalent statement.

02:00:13.036 --> 02:00:31.626
I think we need to reconsider whether we got to the finish line with the Nuremberg Accord, because if we think in the future about testing rural populations, we have to know more about access and equity and whether or not these ethical principles are being met as we think about our moral determinants of public health.

02:00:32.627 --> 02:00:33.968
Stop lying.

02:00:35.387 --> 02:00:36.448
Holy shit.

02:00:52.253 --> 02:00:53.695
No, it's really not.

02:00:53.755 --> 02:00:58.699
If we read the justice part, who ought to receive the benefits of the research and bear its burdens?

02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:03.624
This is the question of justice and the sense of fairness of distribution or what is deserved.

02:01:04.164 --> 02:01:11.992
And injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly.

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:16.376
Another way of conceiving the principle, sorry, I'm doing that to you.

02:01:32.359 --> 02:01:38.946
Another way of conceiving the principle of justice is that equals is that equals ought to be treated equally.

02:01:39.466 --> 02:01:39.987
However, this

02:01:43.228 --> 02:01:45.390
This statement requires explication.

02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:47.691
Who is equal and who is unequal?

02:01:47.791 --> 02:01:52.294
What considerations justify departure from equal distribution?

02:01:52.454 --> 02:02:03.221
Almost all commentators allow that distinctions between experience, age, deprivation, competence, merit, and position do sometimes constitute criteria justifying differential treatment.

02:02:03.762 --> 02:02:09.406
There are several widely accepted formulations of just ways to distribute burdens and benefits.

02:02:10.387 --> 02:02:15.852
Each formulation mentions some relevant property on the basis of which burdens and benefits should be distributed.

02:02:15.912 --> 02:02:28.383
These formulations are to each person an equal share, to each person according to their individual need, to each person according to individual effort, to each person according to societal contribution, to each person according to merit.

02:02:29.394 --> 02:02:35.056
Questions of justice have long been associated with social practices such as punishment, taxation, and political representation.

02:02:35.536 --> 02:02:41.057
Until recently, these questions have not been associated with scientific research.

02:02:41.477 --> 02:02:46.939
However, they are foreshadowed even in the earliest reflections of the ethics of research involving human subjects.

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:58.522
For example, during the 19th and 20th centuries, the burdens of serving as research subjects fell largely on poor ward patients, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed primarily to private patients.

02:02:59.082 --> 02:03:09.711
Subsequently, the exploitation of unwilling prisoners as research subjects in the Nazi concentration camps was condemned as a particularly flagrant injustice.

02:03:10.292 --> 02:03:21.281
In this country in the 1940s, the Tuskegee syphilis study used disadvantaged rural black men to study the untreated course of a disease that is by no means confined to that population.

02:03:21.762 --> 02:03:26.706
These subjects were deprived of demonstrably effective treatment in order not to interrupt the project,

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:29.647
long after such treatment became generally available.

02:03:30.167 --> 02:03:35.708
Against this background, it can be seen how conceptions of justice are relevant to research involving human subjects.

02:03:36.248 --> 02:03:53.713
For example, the selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order to determine whether some classes are being systematically selected simply because of their ease of availability, their compromised position, or their manipulability, rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being studied.

02:03:55.694 --> 02:04:15.939
Finally, whenever research supported by public funds leads to the development of a therapeutic device and procedure, justice demands both that these not provide advantages only to those who can afford them and that such research should not unduly involve persons from groups unlikely to be among the beneficiaries of the subsequent applications of the research.

02:04:16.419 --> 02:04:19.120
I think they were pretty specific about what they meant by justice.

02:04:20.305 --> 02:04:28.588
just like they were specific about what they meant about beneficence, and just like they were specific about respect for persons, not humans.

02:04:30.889 --> 02:04:32.269
Respect for persons.

02:04:38.132 --> 02:04:45.454
First, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection.

02:04:48.015 --> 02:04:49.796
You see, so the less you know,

02:04:51.394 --> 02:04:53.436
the more protection you should be afforded.

02:04:53.716 --> 02:04:57.519
The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements.

02:04:57.559 --> 02:05:02.323
The requirement to acknowledge autonomy, that's a person, not a human.

02:05:03.084 --> 02:05:04.365
Humans aren't autonomous.

02:05:04.405 --> 02:05:10.290
Humans are part of a species that they owe a lot to and should be thinking about the evolution of.

02:05:11.631 --> 02:05:19.498
Persons are autonomous agents given a very limited time on earth to do with what they can.

02:05:20.754 --> 02:05:25.277
to contribute to trees under whose shade they will never shelter.

02:05:28.419 --> 02:05:35.424
This autonomous person is an individual capable of deliberation about personal goals and of acting under the directive of such deliberation.

02:05:35.984 --> 02:05:46.291
To respect autonomy is to give weight to autonomous persons' considered opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless they are clearly detrimental to others.

02:05:47.091 --> 02:06:06.044
to show lack of respect for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person's considered judgments, to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered judgments, or to withhold information necessary to make a considered judgment when there is no compelling reason to do so.

02:06:06.684 --> 02:06:13.409
So for example, to call something an investigational vaccine when it should have been called a transfection or transformation.

02:06:14.943 --> 02:06:20.405
that would be withholding necessary information to make a considered judgment.

02:06:20.545 --> 02:06:35.771
And I tried desperately to get people to understand that, you know, like the jackass Brett Weinstein or the poser Chris Martinson, both of whom are now supported by Brownstone and IMA and whatever else they're taking fellowships from.

02:06:36.191 --> 02:06:42.954
These people are traitors because they violated the principles of the Belmont Report.

02:06:44.175 --> 02:06:47.937
The principles of respects for persons was primary.

02:06:48.778 --> 02:06:52.039
And that's what the people on the internet are doing to you now.

02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:59.103
They are withholding information for their handlers on purpose for money and fame.

02:07:00.664 --> 02:07:05.267
Slow rolling us to a truth that we will never realize a lot like Lucy in the football.

02:07:06.707 --> 02:07:07.668
That's what you see here.

02:07:08.448 --> 02:07:10.609
This is such malevolent bullshit.

02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:11.410
It hurts me.

02:07:14.842 --> 02:07:16.142
When have we ever achieved justice?

02:07:16.963 --> 02:07:18.183
What does justice look like?

02:07:18.803 --> 02:07:36.992
Now, if we talk about social justice, we could actually put some measure... Imagine that they took four years to write that summary paragraph about what they meant by justice, and this would-be scholar, academician, gave it less than two sentences.

02:07:37.152 --> 02:07:38.652
I mean, that is some serious...

02:07:42.093 --> 02:07:45.234
combined with some serious, stop lying.

02:07:46.995 --> 02:07:47.396
Yikes.

02:07:48.676 --> 02:07:49.777
Bring on it.

02:07:49.977 --> 02:07:57.981
We could put some, we could put, we could level the field somewhat because we could actually look at pieces and see how critical they are.

02:07:58.081 --> 02:08:04.704
For example, if, if there's only a Piggly Wiggly in Macon County,

02:08:06.039 --> 02:08:14.063
And that Piggly Wiggly represents the best of the fruits and vegetables that you're going to get.

02:08:15.464 --> 02:08:19.446
How then can you support your children and give them a healthy diet?

02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:34.970
Now, the strange thing is that right up the street in Auburn, or down the street in Montgomery, which is about 15, 20 miles in each direction, you have Kroger, you have Publix, you have all of these different places.

02:08:35.451 --> 02:08:37.432
But now you have transportation as an issue again.

02:08:37.812 --> 02:08:38.913
And you have funds.

02:08:39.213 --> 02:08:41.595
There's no city bus that runs in rural communities.

02:08:42.175 --> 02:08:42.996
So now we're struggling.

02:08:43.176 --> 02:08:44.137
So the Tuskegee report.

02:08:46.556 --> 02:08:48.417
Sorry, I had to allow that comment.

02:08:48.997 --> 02:09:05.006
Is the National Center's attempt to respond to the Belmont Report with practical ideologies, practical thought, to really interrogate what we need to do to ensure that we can have a better playing ground?

02:09:05.026 --> 02:09:06.647
So there's a lot of time.

02:09:06.747 --> 02:09:10.009
That has shit all to do with what the Belmont Report is.

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:11.269
It's remarkable.

02:09:11.349 --> 02:09:13.150
What are these monkeys doing?

02:09:13.311 --> 02:09:14.551
Oh, I shouldn't have used that word.

02:09:15.031 --> 02:09:15.892
But you know what I mean.

02:09:17.145 --> 02:09:18.087
I mean all of them.

02:09:18.187 --> 02:09:19.068
She's a monkey too.

02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:21.392
They're all just grinding it out.

02:09:21.552 --> 02:09:23.275
I don't even know what's going on here.

02:09:24.577 --> 02:09:25.599
It's remarkable.

02:09:25.659 --> 02:09:26.521
What is she again?

02:09:26.581 --> 02:09:29.886
She's an ethics, like the head of an ethics department this monkey is.

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:32.037
My goodness.

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:49.067
But really what you're suggesting is that we need to look from the perspective of a black bioethics from those who have been systematically left out even after we've made moral commitments in the Belmont report.

02:09:49.107 --> 02:09:50.568
He can't even look at her.

02:09:54.042 --> 02:09:56.524
I mean, they're supposed to be having a conversation.

02:09:56.564 --> 02:09:57.864
He can't even look at her.

02:09:58.265 --> 02:09:59.145
Hello, family.

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:01.146
And I ain't talking to this white girl.

02:10:03.188 --> 02:10:03.848
It's gross.

02:10:04.028 --> 02:10:11.333
What you see here is very, very much set up malevolence that is part of the controlled demolition of America.

02:10:11.393 --> 02:10:13.914
And we have to reject it wholeheartedly.

02:10:14.515 --> 02:10:19.458
This theater and these unwitting participants need to be rejected wholeheartedly.

02:10:20.575 --> 02:10:30.460
because they are taking what is a foundational American document in science and ethics and making a laughingstock of it by talking about piggly wiggly.

02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:35.442
50 years later to... Yes, she said black bioethics.

02:10:35.502 --> 02:10:36.523
That didn't happen again.

02:10:37.222 --> 02:10:47.650
Evelyn, I'm wondering if you can put this in context for us about what that looks like in terms of health disparities, thinking about, for example- Change of perspective, people.

02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:54.555
Morbidity, mortality crisis, and how this all fits together to where we find ourselves today.

02:10:55.523 --> 02:10:58.245
Well, first, thank you all for inviting me.

02:10:58.265 --> 02:11:04.729
And I'm happy to be here on this panel with people I have a great deal of respect for and the work that they do all the time.

02:11:06.431 --> 02:11:10.013
So the answer to that question is a very long one, historically.

02:11:11.534 --> 02:11:19.797
The way I put it is that we've not had a time since Africans were first brought here and became enslaved in the United States.

02:11:19.817 --> 02:11:22.718
We've never had a period of time when there weren't health disparities.

02:11:23.579 --> 02:11:33.763
And the distinction between what was health for those who were enslaved versus the health of those who enslaved them is something that

02:11:35.183 --> 02:11:57.050
began to be noticed as... It's really interesting because there's a guy in my childhood who was on TV who lost his job on TV because he argued that the really big black dudes in basketball and in the NFL were so big because they descend from slaves that were bred to be really big.

02:11:57.210 --> 02:12:04.253
So it's not really fair sometimes if you have to compete against somebody who descends from people that were bred to be giants.

02:12:04.997 --> 02:12:07.099
you know, super strong and fast and whatever.

02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:10.163
Like seriously, he lost his job.

02:12:10.203 --> 02:12:12.766
His name is Jimmy the Greek for saying something like that.

02:12:13.502 --> 02:12:22.049
And so this woman wants you to accept some portion of the history of the American slave.

02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:30.797
And for sure, forget about generations of slavery where the color of the skin did not matter at all who was enslaved.

02:12:31.297 --> 02:12:35.380
But let's just focus on the recent, recent, recent, recent, recent,

02:12:36.281 --> 02:12:45.931
sort of manifestation of slavery in America and then talk about very specific aspects of it with the Belmont Report behind her.

02:12:50.175 --> 02:12:51.737
Yikes, I mean it's really yucky.

02:12:53.003 --> 02:12:58.606
as early as the first time black people arrived here as slaves.

02:12:59.086 --> 02:13:01.548
So we have to think about it's been a long story.

02:13:01.988 --> 02:13:05.310
In that sense, that means that there are ways in which we've accepted.

02:13:05.530 --> 02:13:19.078
I think you need to think about it from a really hardcore biological perspective, like only the really, really badass, strong genes, strong immune systems made it through two months of being in the bottom of a slave ship.

02:13:21.269 --> 02:13:27.351
all the weak constitutions, all the weak immune systems, all the, I mean, they all died.

02:13:29.012 --> 02:13:37.375
And then you had generation or two of, you know, I mean, come on, ladies and gentlemen, let's, let's be honest here.

02:13:37.415 --> 02:13:41.036
This is not a accurate reckoning of

02:13:41.883 --> 02:13:44.785
recent or deep human history at all.

02:13:44.805 --> 02:13:53.753
This is not an accurate sort of, you know, updating of our understanding of the Belmont Report, even though they say we have to update our understanding of it.

02:13:53.793 --> 02:13:56.095
Why would we need to update our understanding of the U.S.

02:13:56.135 --> 02:13:58.837
Constitution unless there might be a reason to destroy it?

02:13:59.337 --> 02:14:05.983
Why would we need to update something as beautiful as something that took four years to decide on how to write?

02:14:08.812 --> 02:14:13.195
with just some willy-nilly discussion about the distribution of Piggly Wigglies.

02:14:14.736 --> 02:14:23.062
This is a mockery to all of academia in the world, a mockery of all academia in the West, and that's on purpose.

02:14:24.588 --> 02:14:28.009
to in this society that there will be health disparities.

02:14:28.710 --> 02:14:38.074
And so for certainly for me and those of us who've studied African-American history and my colleagues here on the panel, what happened.

02:14:38.214 --> 02:14:41.555
I mean, only black people live in poor neighborhoods, right?

02:14:41.655 --> 02:14:42.936
Only black people live there.

02:14:42.956 --> 02:14:45.116
So only black people have these disparities.

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:47.698
That's the actual story they're telling.

02:14:47.718 --> 02:14:50.939
There's no poor people in Appalachia except for black people.

02:14:51.259 --> 02:14:53.340
And only poor people everywhere are black.

02:14:54.678 --> 02:15:08.007
and that the Belmont report is a response to was something that we had been struggling with in this country through public health infrastructure as well as the medical establishment to try to address.

02:15:08.487 --> 02:15:15.772
But certainly Tuskegee became this sort of flashpoint of bringing all of what we had been aware of in the past to the fore.

02:15:16.413 --> 02:15:23.798
And so one of the major issues, as David just talked about, certainly was issues of access.

02:15:24.918 --> 02:15:41.146
that certainly deserved much more extensive discussion than what... So they're saying access all over and over again when in the Belmont Report, it would be about beneficence and it would be about equity and they listed it all.

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:48.450
They listed equals get equals and to each their, to their need and they listed principles.

02:15:49.386 --> 02:15:54.070
The old principles, the ways you could think about it, they didn't take it lightly.

02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:56.993
It was a scholarly work that took four years to produce.

02:15:57.393 --> 02:16:01.136
And these shitheads are ad-libbing about ideas they haven't even read.

02:16:02.898 --> 02:16:04.179
They're Harvard people.

02:16:04.359 --> 02:16:04.920
Come on.

02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:09.264
They're supposed to be, you know, ivory tower learned people.

02:16:10.825 --> 02:16:16.029
You couldn't even have a conversation with this lady for more than five minutes before everything would break down.

02:16:16.983 --> 02:16:23.107
She would consider you an unlearned, unwashed, oh my gosh.

02:16:23.747 --> 02:16:24.788
In the Belmont Report.

02:16:25.348 --> 02:16:34.273
Secondly, the ways in which we want to talk about not just what happens to individuals, but what was happening to black communities throughout this long history.

02:16:34.794 --> 02:16:39.036
And of course, this period of time, 1619 to the president is a long period of time.

02:16:39.096 --> 02:16:41.918
Many, many things have changed, but there are some aspects that

02:16:42.398 --> 02:16:45.919
I think, are persistent across time.

02:16:46.519 --> 02:16:52.920
And the one that I would point to is if you think about the black maternal and morbidity crisis as it's now defined.

02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:57.961
One of the first things I said about it when it was first called a crisis, I said, how long?

02:16:58.161 --> 02:17:00.242
It's been going on for like two and a half centuries.

02:17:00.282 --> 02:17:01.562
Why is it a crisis now?

02:17:02.102 --> 02:17:04.682
I mean, it's always been a crisis.

02:17:04.763 --> 02:17:11.984
But one of the things that reproductive health advocates and scholars have been writing about is that something seems to have

02:17:12.404 --> 02:17:19.527
made this crisis, this situation, into a crisis in the late 20th century for some observers.

02:17:20.308 --> 02:17:25.851
And one of the issues that has emerged from that is how to determine what is the cause of it.

02:17:26.131 --> 02:17:28.092
And that's where the health disparities work is coming in.

02:17:28.372 --> 02:17:29.752
How do we figure out what causes it?

02:17:29.812 --> 02:17:30.413
What causes it?

02:17:30.673 --> 02:17:35.955
And there are rooms full of studies trying to figure this out.

02:17:36.175 --> 02:17:38.717
But I think there's something very important

02:17:39.717 --> 02:17:53.693
here, that we do take this time right now to try to figure it out and hopefully, once and for all, come to terms with the kinds of factors that have led to high rates of black women's death and their infants' death.

02:17:54.414 --> 02:18:02.321
debts as well, that we can really begin to make a shift in the ways in which it's both at the individual level, it's at the community level.

02:18:02.341 --> 02:18:13.570
I think it's a legitimate point to make that one of the, or two of the strategies that were listed as possible ways to determine what equal is were essentially communist ideas.

02:18:13.610 --> 02:18:16.372
They absolutely are, but they didn't list all communist ideas.

02:18:16.432 --> 02:18:19.555
They also said equals get equals and what else did they say?

02:18:21.266 --> 02:18:23.028
I might've put it away already, so it doesn't matter.

02:18:23.388 --> 02:18:24.609
But I see your point, I do.

02:18:25.089 --> 02:18:29.813
Unity level and it's at the level of systems and institutions in this country.

02:18:29.853 --> 02:18:34.457
I think we can mark all those things, but we still haven't been able to come up with a coherent.

02:18:34.617 --> 02:18:45.186
Now imagine what I see and what Mark sees and what you probably see if you've been here long enough is that all these words and all this discussion and all these terms

02:18:47.301 --> 02:19:08.569
They don't address any of the very simple points that it's about the human genome and we need to convert everybody to human test subjects because we can't learn anything about ourselves anymore from studying these organisms with which we are symbiotically in existence with.

02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:15.452
There is no molecular phylogenetic tree that connects us and justifies

02:19:16.465 --> 02:19:30.780
these molecular observations as being taken as either evidence of the existence of that tree or evidence of our understanding these higher order pattern integrities of which we are one.

02:19:32.742 --> 02:19:39.789
And we have to understand that, that the biology of bacteria and the molecular biology of bacteria has been

02:19:41.266 --> 02:19:57.143
weaponized against us in all aspects, including of our understanding of ourselves, so that we have been led to believe that we are descended from bacteria instead of an emergent property of the symbiosis with bacteria.

02:19:59.309 --> 02:20:01.050
Dang, every once in a while I nail it.

02:20:02.591 --> 02:20:03.132
What a story.

02:20:03.572 --> 02:20:06.054
And back to the point of access.

02:20:06.434 --> 02:20:14.580
One of the things we do know, if you just think about trying to understand this crisis in terms of race, you get up to a point, you get some clear factors.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:18.663
But then if you add socioeconomic class, then you get other issues come up.

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:23.087
And so one of the consistent things that have recently been discussed

02:20:23.827 --> 02:20:28.209
It's crazy because they are contributing to this public health is the answer.

02:20:28.289 --> 02:20:29.529
Public health is the answer.

02:20:29.569 --> 02:20:33.771
We have to be able to test rural, you know, disparities.

02:20:33.831 --> 02:20:38.293
And they wanna do all this stuff just under the, they're coming at it with a different angle.

02:20:38.333 --> 02:20:47.356
And it's a gross and malevolent angle if you're not there, just like I described earlier in the stream, how if you're not in this circle, it seems crazy.

02:20:47.876 --> 02:20:51.838
And you can easily imagine how this woman would think I was crazy

02:20:52.338 --> 02:20:55.261
for suggesting that public health is an illusion.

02:20:56.462 --> 02:21:00.306
That this whole idea of virology is an illusion.

02:21:00.346 --> 02:21:06.313
This whole idea of we've sequenced the human genome and now we're moving forward is a ridiculous mythology.

02:21:06.393 --> 02:21:08.415
She is not aware of that.

02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:17.916
She's just really happy that it takes seven and a half minutes to read all of her accolades before they say her name.

02:21:18.176 --> 02:21:30.328
Many black women, no matter their educational level, no matter their class status, are still reporting that they are engaged, they have to deal with health practitioners who do not listen to them.

02:21:31.591 --> 02:21:35.034
I think I'm going to move on now because I think it's time to end.

02:21:35.074 --> 02:21:36.595
It is two hours and 20 minutes.

02:21:36.635 --> 02:21:37.515
It's bad biology.

02:21:37.575 --> 02:21:38.856
Evolution because DNA.

02:21:38.896 --> 02:21:45.180
I think I nailed this little impromptu discussion of why that molecular phylogenetic tree is a myth.

02:21:45.741 --> 02:21:53.126
And that myth facilitates this juggling of this means that, evolution because DNA.

02:21:53.166 --> 02:21:54.307
And that's all bullshit.

02:21:55.407 --> 02:21:59.050
And they have put this myth in place for a long time.

02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:00.371
They've insisted that this myth

02:22:00.951 --> 02:22:04.412
be there even though they now know that it's an irreducible complexity.

02:22:04.453 --> 02:22:06.193
They have no chance of digesting it.

02:22:06.613 --> 02:22:13.476
They still are on this script and they have taken advantage of an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality.

02:22:13.936 --> 02:22:19.879
They murdered a few people in America by briefly losing control of how they treated pneumonia.

02:22:21.653 --> 02:22:25.256
And they misconstrued that as a spreading novel pathogen.

02:22:25.416 --> 02:22:27.038
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:22:27.098 --> 02:22:42.732
played his role because Robert Malone gave him a good script, because Kevin McKernan gave him a good script, because Merrill Nass was in his ear already years ago, because Brett Weinstein and his father are part of the script, because Steve Bannon is aware of the script.

02:22:43.152 --> 02:22:49.056
and probably was aware of Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy being brought over America for this script.

02:22:49.436 --> 02:23:04.085
It's probably why the great Tony Lyons, as Steve Bannon called him the other day, was clever enough to get Jesse Ventura to write a book like this that kind of presaged the idea that an independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:23:04.105 --> 02:23:06.707
would help somebody win the White House and then they'd get shot.

02:23:10.666 --> 02:23:14.429
So that's not by accident, ladies and gentlemen, because this is for all the marbles.

02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:15.850
This is for grandchildren of earth.

02:23:15.890 --> 02:23:25.677
That's why there's a fake anti-vax movement in America that helped lay down this myth of a novel pathogen on what is an irreducibly complex background.

02:23:26.097 --> 02:23:33.842
And so that irreducibly complex background using nonspecific PCR tests was told to us as evidence of spread.

02:23:33.882 --> 02:23:36.504
And since RNA cannot pandemic, we know that's bullshit.

02:23:36.945 --> 02:23:40.087
The only way they got away with it is placebos made it safe.

02:23:42.335 --> 02:23:46.097
And so using PCR to find their ghost doesn't make their ghost real.

02:23:46.137 --> 02:23:48.058
And it doesn't make you a ghostbuster either.

02:23:48.078 --> 02:23:48.758
Okay.

02:23:48.778 --> 02:23:54.001
I think tomorrow we're going to watch this video, but I have a special video for you, uh, from BBC.

02:23:54.761 --> 02:23:55.982
Um, it's called placebo.

02:23:56.462 --> 02:23:58.043
Um, it's a really good video.

02:23:58.383 --> 02:24:00.024
Um, and we'll watch that one tomorrow.

02:24:00.084 --> 02:24:01.425
So thanks very much for being here.

02:24:02.025 --> 02:24:05.007
And tomorrow, I think we're also going to probably watch, um, the,

02:24:06.730 --> 02:24:10.414
the recent interview that everybody's getting all excited about with Stephen Hadfield.

02:24:10.434 --> 02:24:24.410
We'll probably watch it at one and a half speed because I can't stand the guy, but we will watch it and then we'll watch this placebo thing because I think once you see this video, you'll realize why my claim that the US vaccine schedule can only be

02:24:25.131 --> 02:24:26.592
possible because of placebo.

02:24:26.732 --> 02:24:31.654
And the rollout of billions of doses of mRNA can only be possible because of placebo.

02:24:32.194 --> 02:24:39.098
You'll understand why they had shitheads like Sasha Latupova running around the world saying the different batches are different.

02:24:39.138 --> 02:24:43.420
And they had a big paper in Denmark that said different batches are different.

02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.761
No, a lot of them are placebo.

02:24:45.801 --> 02:24:46.981
Thanks very much for being here.

02:24:47.562 --> 02:24:49.603
And I definitely will see you again tomorrow.

02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:53.625
Yes, tomorrow.

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:54.165
Thanks.

02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:54.385
Thanks

02:25:05.133 --> 02:25:13.622
But one thing I am confident of from everything I've read is that this RNA exists, you can capture it, you can sequence it, you can move it to other cells and recapitulate disease.
