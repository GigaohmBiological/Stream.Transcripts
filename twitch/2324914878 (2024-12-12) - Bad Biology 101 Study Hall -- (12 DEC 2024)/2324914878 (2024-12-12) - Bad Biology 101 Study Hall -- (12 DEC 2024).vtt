WEBVTT

00:35.183 --> 00:35.443
Yeah.

01:19.386 --> 01:22.547
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:23.027 --> 01:24.827
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:26.828 --> 01:27.848
Isolation, what was it?

01:27.968 --> 01:28.988
Isolation and purification.

01:30.689 --> 01:31.409
Of the virus?

01:31.489 --> 01:31.709
Yes.

01:32.949 --> 01:34.710
Well, you isolate a virus by

01:41.528 --> 01:43.991
finding the virus which causes a disease.

01:44.651 --> 01:49.516
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

01:50.317 --> 01:51.738
I don't understand what the issue.

01:51.758 --> 01:51.858
I see.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.120
No, it depends on how they used it.

02:06.974 --> 02:08.936
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:08.996 --> 02:15.042
I mean, he actually isolated it, so... I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:15.102 --> 02:17.144
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:46.343 --> 02:49.285
Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs.

03:08.243 --> 03:08.463
do do

03:32.923 --> 03:34.704
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

03:34.724 --> 03:40.045
This is GigaOM Biological coming to you live from my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

03:40.225 --> 03:42.106
It's 1116 on the 12th of December.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.287
I'm happy to be here to bring you another Biology 101 session.

03:46.767 --> 03:50.128
Today is another one of these Bad Biology 101 study halls.

03:50.948 --> 03:52.349
Good to see everybody in the chat.

03:52.829 --> 03:54.930
That was indeed the Chips theme.

03:55.430 --> 04:14.721
I've got a number of pictures of me when I was a small child before first grade where I was riding around my neighborhood in Indiana with a black square radio strapped to the front of my bicycle and a Cubs batting, you know, plastic

04:15.692 --> 04:28.537
faux batting helmet on and sunglasses pretending to be Poncharello and riding around my neighborhood with a blonde friend of mine named Shane, who was, of course, Andy.

04:28.837 --> 04:35.919
And it was, I don't know how many years we did that, but for a very long time, Poncharello was me on TV.

04:36.279 --> 04:40.001
And all these years later, believe it or not, I have a,

04:41.406 --> 04:56.756
a BMW California Highway Patrol motorcycle in my garage that I very rarely ride and had originally purchased to do JC on a bike on the bike and then very quickly realized that

04:57.396 --> 05:05.406
That was a level of danger combined with large machine operation that didn't really combine very well with my filmmaking desires.

05:06.287 --> 05:09.390
And so I've since abandoned that idea.

05:09.450 --> 05:14.677
I only ride that bike when I want to have fun and completely forget about everything else is what you do on a motorcycle.

05:15.737 --> 05:30.447
Today we're going to try and combat this bad biology evolution because DNA thing again by trying to take a look at and practice watching and listening to other people swim within it.

05:31.027 --> 05:37.049
And if you listen to them swim within it, you can hear some of these big ideas, these big assumptions bubble up.

05:37.570 --> 05:55.037
And as they bubble up, you can see how often they have to come back to that well of assumption in order to keep talking about the things that they want to talk about, or in order to frame the particular paper that they're talking about within what appears to be a relevant discussion framework.

05:55.957 --> 06:00.100
They always have to go back to this bad biology 101 and evolution because DNA.

06:00.540 --> 06:16.972
And so I think one of the ways that I can help myself to develop the big points of a curriculum that would try to combat this would be to try and work daily at trying to find ways to quickly and succinctly show

06:19.198 --> 06:21.039
how people are trapped in these ideas.

06:21.800 --> 06:31.126
And so I have proposed many times that there are a number of quick and short combinations of words that can be used to try and shake the enchantment.

06:31.186 --> 06:45.276
And I said yesterday, I think pretty well, how actually words that have elaborate meanings and elaborate concepts attached to them can often function as enchantments because if those

06:46.579 --> 06:59.267
in-depth meaning and in-depth concepts that are tied to the meaning of that particular word are provoked or evoked in people's minds because of the nature of the way they understand those things.

07:00.202 --> 07:10.232
Very similar to how someone who has grown up his whole life thinking that, you know, saying for Christ's sake would be a very, very bad way to swear.

07:10.352 --> 07:15.617
Much worse than say, I don't know, son of a bitch or something like that.

07:15.717 --> 07:19.481
And I apologize for the sensitive ears out there, but there are different

07:19.921 --> 07:24.285
ways of swearing, and some of those swear words are very corrosive to our ears.

07:24.765 --> 07:27.107
Swear words in other languages might not be.

07:27.167 --> 07:35.673
For example, if I said kankerhoor, do you really, does that, maybe that one is a bad example because you can kind of hear what it says already.

07:36.574 --> 07:36.914
Sorry.

07:37.955 --> 07:40.857
So that's a Dutch swear word, of course, which means cancer

07:41.917 --> 07:45.782
Oh, it would be conquer wife is what you say, I think most of the time.

07:45.822 --> 07:46.904
But anyway, it doesn't matter.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.868
Now I'm being I'm going down a bad place here.

07:49.908 --> 07:59.561
What I'm trying to do is to give you this concept that words and the more colorful their meanings are, the more

08:00.675 --> 08:14.861
elaborated on the meanings of these words have been, and more importantly, the more we are unconsciously aware of how uniform these meanings are, the more likely it is that they are to function as an enchantment.

08:14.981 --> 08:21.684
One of the, you know, things you might look at in this context is history, and what we understand as history, for example, around

08:22.304 --> 08:24.245
the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

08:24.265 --> 08:43.090
There is a mythology around that, and that mythology has been built up over time, and it is the shared understanding of what that mythology is that gets evoked in our mind when someone says, hey, you know about the JFK assassination?

08:43.110 --> 08:43.730
Do you know about that?

08:44.960 --> 08:48.001
Do you know about the 9-11 conspiracy thing?

08:48.261 --> 09:01.664
Those are pretty complex combinations of words relative to, say, some of the words that are used in biology that provoke magnificently detailed concepts by their simple mention.

09:03.784 --> 09:05.605
And this, I think, is where

09:06.681 --> 09:16.949
We have to find the language that will help high school teachers, high school students, freshmen and sophomores in biology, first year medical students break out of this.

09:18.652 --> 09:20.213
this cognitive trap that they're in.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.115
And it is a cognitive trap.

09:22.175 --> 09:24.636
And you don't have to see it as malevolent.

09:24.656 --> 09:27.578
You can see it as something that lemmings would have happen.

09:27.659 --> 09:29.440
This is where the mass psychosis is.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.523
And it's not a completely innocent one.

09:33.583 --> 09:37.526
It is one that has been influenced by those people in our past

09:38.146 --> 09:49.073
who consider themselves some of the wisest people around, those people are the influencers and the people that have codified these ideas in such a way that have allowed them to propagate across generations.

09:49.634 --> 09:57.199
And their students that they have mentored are the people that are helping to propagate it to the next generation, and we need to break that.

09:57.979 --> 10:04.504
And I think the way to break it might be to explore the truth and mythology of the Human Genome Project.

10:04.564 --> 10:25.661
I think one way to break it might be to challenge doctors and nurses to really consider the biology of intramuscular injection and challenge themselves to really assess how much they understand of human biology and whether or not they can really explain why intramuscular injection is something that they use in their professional

10:27.063 --> 10:28.344
in their professional existence.

10:28.404 --> 10:44.238
And finally, RNA cannot pandemic, I believe, is still the best three combinations of words to throw at an academic biologist who is probably most likely not in the field of RNA virology, not in the field of pandemics, and challenge them to say, hey,

10:44.778 --> 10:57.446
You remember when you did your PhD and you had this oral examination and somebody asked you the question about the central dogma of molecular biology and cellular biology, and you answered that it was DNA to RNA to protein.

10:58.507 --> 11:02.870
How does the idea that RNA can pandemic fit into that?

11:02.910 --> 11:11.596
Because in the dogma of modern bad biology, DNA is the stable, the magic,

11:13.397 --> 11:24.364
encodes everything part, the protected in the nucleus part, the telomeric senescence part, the Hayflick limit part, the evolution acts on genes part.

11:25.244 --> 11:34.970
And the RNA is the local temporary signal that is regulating the protein expression that changes all the time as part of the pattern integrity.

11:35.471 --> 11:40.194
So how does that work that outside of the context of what you would call life,

11:41.645 --> 11:51.248
RNA itself can sustain itself in the background in the terms of endemicity, which basically means in perpetuity.

11:51.308 --> 11:53.329
How does that figure into that?

11:53.849 --> 12:00.891
Because even species can't maintain themselves in perpetuity and change and go extinct.

12:00.951 --> 12:08.654
And so how is it that outside of this, without all of the elaborate machinery of DNA, how can RNA accomplish this?

12:10.076 --> 12:13.038
in the context of a coronavirus and who told you that?

12:13.819 --> 12:16.400
That's maybe the biggest thing.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.542
Do I have to crank it up a little bit?

12:18.562 --> 12:20.303
I can crank it up a little bit.

12:21.043 --> 12:28.368
That's some of the biggest thing that we have to deal with here is the idea that maybe the microphone is just not quite pointed right.

12:30.302 --> 12:42.010
that we have to deal with is the idea that these people have accepted these preposterous notions as proven and therefore just move on again with these assumptions on the wall.

12:42.111 --> 12:53.659
And one of the worst ones is that RNA can pandemic, that RNA is something we need to fear, that free range RNA is something that if you make it right, oh my gosh, it could be worse than a nuclear bomb.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.000
And this is absolutely absurd.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.840
And we cannot let our children grow up in a world where they believe this.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.501
We are in 2024.

13:01.881 --> 13:08.723
One way to challenge your doctor might also just be say, you know, intramuscular injection is the single worst way to be exposed to a toxin.

13:08.743 --> 13:09.984
Can you tell me a worse way?

13:10.404 --> 13:12.364
And maybe they'll say, well, IV injection.

13:12.404 --> 13:20.247
And you might say, well, IV injections actually not as bad because it will never fool you.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.228
You're never going to not know that it was what you injected.

13:25.285 --> 13:27.606
You're never going to think, oh, wow, maybe it was something else.

13:27.666 --> 13:28.867
Maybe it was something that I ate.

13:28.927 --> 13:30.168
Maybe it was my genetics.

13:31.509 --> 13:44.696
But if you inject it intramuscularly and the onset of the symptoms is over the course of days or weeks or months, then you're never going to attribute it to the acute exposure to whatever was in that injection.

13:45.817 --> 13:50.119
IV, it's very, very much harder to divorce the effects from the cause.

13:52.324 --> 14:00.527
And so it's a lot less dangerous because you're a lot less likely to misattribute your suffering to something else.

14:02.227 --> 14:12.491
And it is a very great way to be exposed to toxins or be exposed to dangers that you don't want to be associated to the exposure.

14:14.031 --> 14:21.794
It is a great way to be exposed to a toxin if you don't want the dangers of the toxin exposure to be revealed.

14:23.311 --> 14:31.156
If you don't want to see the effects temporarily related to the exposure of the toxin, the intramuscular injection's great.

14:33.458 --> 14:44.305
If you want the exposure to a toxin to be longer lasting and to ramp up and crescendo and decrescendo on a different time course than IV injection, well, yeah, sure, this is great.

14:48.137 --> 14:53.860
And so New Biology 101 is based on the idea that life is a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time.

14:53.920 --> 15:00.743
This is an idea that I am stealing from Buckminster Fuller, among, I think, probably other biologists before him.

15:00.783 --> 15:17.230
But Buckminster Fuller has stood out to me in my reading recently as one of the greatest thinkers of the late modern era, and a curious omission from all of these people's pantheon of brightness.

15:18.966 --> 15:24.590
Almost nobody talks about Buckminster Fuller, even though Buckminster Fuller was an enthusiastic biologist.

15:25.771 --> 15:26.972
So it's very curious to me.

15:27.732 --> 15:34.998
And so that's why I'm very confident to try to establish this new biology idea that way.

15:35.038 --> 15:36.779
And it's not new, it's just new for me.

15:38.601 --> 15:40.862
Let me slide down here to the bottom.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.004
Still keep doing that a little slow.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.585
Remind you that I am doing JC on the hardwood.

15:48.025 --> 15:51.507
Um, I did not manage to shoot a video yesterday.

15:51.527 --> 15:54.449
Um, I will not manage to shoot a video today.

15:54.509 --> 15:57.531
However, I should be able to get around to it on the weekend or else next week.

15:58.371 --> 16:06.476
Um, it's actually during the week that I have the most opportunity to do it around two in the afternoon, because that's when the gym is completely empty and I can hog the whole half court.

16:08.046 --> 16:14.329
And today I don't think I'm gonna make it there at two o'clock because we do have a freshman game this afternoon.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.231
But it is a project that's not gonna stop.

16:18.271 --> 16:33.679
And it's also because of, I'm focusing first this week on five days a week, and then next week we'll get five days a week plus JC on the hardwood and probably also the probability course once a week, which we might actually do on Thursdays now, we'll see.

16:38.618 --> 16:46.542
So Bad Biology 101, watching a slow motion train wreck is basically what it's going to feel like when you hang out with me nowadays, because this is where we are.

16:46.582 --> 16:58.247
We're surrounded by thousands and thousands of academic biologists who have spent their lives specializing and pigeonholing their brains so that they can excuse themselves from having to think usefully about many other topics.

16:59.718 --> 17:04.020
They don't have to think very much about what food they buy or what school their kid goes to.

17:04.080 --> 17:21.728
They only have to really focus on their career because everybody else around them also only gets by by only focusing on their career and only hyper-focusing on that little question, that little receptor subtype, that little experimental model, that little knockout mouse, and trying to get as many slices out of it as possible.

17:23.069 --> 17:40.884
And so these are the people that I am trying to wake up with these small, succinct, semantic word bombs, like RNA cannot pandemic, or intramuscular injection is dumb, or transfection was criminal, or these kind of, you know, that's what I'm trying to do with those things.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.506
But ultimately, I can only coach people.

17:43.586 --> 17:48.750
I can't make them do the exercise, and a lot of those people require a lot of exercise.

17:49.704 --> 17:51.705
just like I required a lot of exercise.

17:51.806 --> 17:54.988
I did not get here in 2020.

17:55.348 --> 18:10.419
It was with a great amount of effort and pain and self-doubt and rechecking and double-checking and making mistakes that I got to the stage where now I think I understand exactly or close to how they're doing this.

18:12.256 --> 18:16.057
And we have to get our thinking on different time horizons.

18:16.117 --> 18:18.698
We've got to get our thinking on different time scales.

18:18.738 --> 18:24.380
We have to understand that these people have raised us to misunderstand ourselves.

18:25.921 --> 18:30.122
They actually raised our parents to misunderstand themselves.

18:30.162 --> 18:35.744
And our parents raised us with their guidance to misunderstand ourselves.

18:38.834 --> 18:39.594
That's where we are.

18:39.734 --> 18:44.315
And so it is a long and arduous trek that we are gonna have to help these people.

18:44.335 --> 18:45.955
We're gonna need to be Sherpas in a way.

18:46.636 --> 18:48.796
And so we're gonna have to climb the mountain lots of times.

18:48.816 --> 18:59.658
We're gonna have to get accustomed to being at high altitude and to carrying the heavier loads for people that have just gotten there and can barely even put the left in front of the right.

19:01.939 --> 19:03.559
And we're gonna have to do it for a while.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.529
Until people understand that there is a way up this mountain.

19:07.569 --> 19:08.711
There is a peak up there.

19:09.552 --> 19:10.754
And there's a safe way down.

19:16.303 --> 19:17.985
But it's going to be a slow motion train wreck.

19:18.026 --> 19:18.967
I can guarantee you that.

19:19.858 --> 19:38.050
And so what I want to approach it with and how I want to coach you to approach it is to ask what questions are they asking and really try hard if you ever do this on your own, which I hope you do, try really hard to write them down, write down the question, what are they asking?

19:38.110 --> 19:42.773
And then what model are they using to ask it?

19:42.833 --> 19:48.317
Because almost invariably in modern academic science, they're not gonna be using a model of

19:49.645 --> 19:50.946
of what they're testing.

19:51.606 --> 19:53.567
They're not gonna be testing autistic kids.

19:54.488 --> 20:02.972
They're not gonna be testing, you know, they don't, they always have to have a model system.

20:03.032 --> 20:06.654
How far away from the actual question is the model system?

20:06.694 --> 20:19.140
These are the kinds of directions I want you to take your curiosity rather than the direction that they want you to take it and using the tools that they want you to assume are useful.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.942
And so that's the other thing that we want to listen to as we listen to these guys talk.

20:25.483 --> 20:31.306
What biological ideas do they assume are proven?

20:31.506 --> 20:38.770
Assume are certain concepts, certain concepts in the sense of sound concepts, proven concepts.

20:40.731 --> 20:44.433
If you talk about extraterrestrials as if they exist, that's one thing.

20:45.573 --> 20:48.515
If you talk about Vulcans as if they exist, that's another thing.

20:49.824 --> 20:54.329
And so how many times are they talking about extraterrestrials as a general proposition?

20:54.790 --> 20:56.792
How many times are they talking about Vulcans?

20:59.616 --> 21:04.341
Because again, that's where this here, I'll even put my little thing on right now.

21:05.783 --> 21:07.365
I'll play science officer.

21:10.004 --> 21:18.230
And we will try to answer the question, okay, so how many times are they talking about extraterrestrials?

21:18.290 --> 21:19.911
Which in theory would be fine, right?

21:19.931 --> 21:22.873
It would be fine to talk about extraterrestrials as a possibility.

21:23.614 --> 21:25.575
And how many times are they talking about Vulcans?

21:25.635 --> 21:26.836
Because that's very different.

21:27.337 --> 21:32.420
And so if you hypothetically talk about a mechanism or you hypothetically talk about a

21:33.881 --> 21:35.802
Biological phenomenon, that's one thing.

21:35.882 --> 21:41.506
If you certainly talk about an existing phenomenon that doesn't exist, that's another.

21:43.407 --> 21:54.214
If you talk about a possibly existing phenomenon with some indirect evidence as if it's already a proven fact, that is very similar to talking about Vulcans.

21:55.936 --> 22:03.039
talking about extraterrestrials as a possibility and admitting that they could also be based on silicon or something like that, that's all hypothetical.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.862
Talking about what planet they live on, what they look like, and their language is another thing entirely, right?

22:09.903 --> 22:21.128
And I would suggest to you that there are concepts in biology right now, in bad biology, that have been built up into a false mountain of knowledge.

22:23.038 --> 22:30.406
And every time these words are said, that false mountain of knowledge is in the background, subconsciously.

22:31.531 --> 22:36.756
edified by the collective acceptance of the people in the conversation.

22:36.816 --> 22:39.878
So for example, we have four people on the screen, that's what we're going to see soon.

22:40.419 --> 22:43.882
Four people on the screen, three people from the United States, one person from Scotland.

22:44.582 --> 22:55.392
And if they say something like, Big Macs are really tasty because the secret sauce is Thousand Island dressing, and they all go, yeah, that's true.

22:56.172 --> 22:57.974
That's an illusion of consensus.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.955
And then they go on to say, yeah, but fast food's bad for you.

23:03.975 --> 23:05.416
That's an illusion of consensus.

23:05.496 --> 23:17.244
But if they just said Big Macs, and then all of them said, mm, mm, that's also an illusion of consensus that leaves a lot more to your imagination, a lot more to what do you know.

23:20.626 --> 23:30.173
And so if you don't know very much about fast food, and you don't know very much about Burger King or McDonald's, and somebody says Big Macs, and they all say, oh, wow, those are tasty,

23:31.837 --> 23:32.377
What happens?

23:32.898 --> 23:34.479
Well, you're pretty curious about Big Macs.

23:34.519 --> 23:40.203
What if they say prions and they all go, oh wow, yeah, those things are really interesting, wow.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.707
Because that's how this works.

23:46.638 --> 23:48.679
That's what happens to academic biologists, too.

23:48.739 --> 24:11.310
As I said yesterday, when they go to a seminar and they hear a story that has a big word definition with several sub definitions or subcategories, and they are looking at one subcategory, and you pay attention and learn all these terms and how this person proposes they're working together, then the next time you hear this little term, all of these ideas will be provoked.

24:13.120 --> 24:18.322
And if that person did their job right, they will be provoked as ideas that make sense.

24:18.422 --> 24:22.624
And more importantly, you might want to assume are right because that guy's working on them.

24:23.124 --> 24:24.385
That woman was working on them.

24:24.985 --> 24:27.346
She's dedicated her whole life to studying that stuff.

24:27.746 --> 24:30.147
She was really nice and very charming over coffee.

24:30.527 --> 24:32.548
She can't be, she's obviously not an idiot.

24:32.568 --> 24:33.768
That's an interesting idea.

24:33.848 --> 24:40.191
I'm going to come, I'm going to, I'm going to run with that in my own understanding of her own system for the rest of my life.

24:42.092 --> 24:42.792
That's what happens.

24:44.514 --> 24:50.016
And we start sharing each other's models as all being as certain as we write it in our grant application.

24:51.397 --> 25:13.825
And because our salaries and our wonderful job with its wonderful perks and its wonderful schedule and its wonderful feeling of authority and prestige and whatever else it feels like to be on the faculty of a medical school, all prevents these people from snapping out of it and saying, wait, what are we doing here?

25:16.107 --> 25:17.808
And so like I said, we're gonna be Sherpas.

25:17.868 --> 25:27.731
It's gonna be a lot of hard work, a lot of carrying heavy stuff for people who don't really think that we're doing very much, who are super proud of themselves for just being on the trail.

25:31.652 --> 25:37.694
Until they realize what we're doing and what we've done and how they're really not doing what they thought they were doing.

25:40.835 --> 25:41.915
Maybe we can end the,

25:42.697 --> 25:45.683
the academic Mount Everest climbing forever.

25:46.063 --> 25:49.851
But first we're gonna have to walk with them and show them what they're doing is so ridiculous.

25:51.940 --> 25:54.242
So of course, he's going to raise a little money.

25:54.282 --> 25:56.243
I might have to fast forward through this part.

25:56.423 --> 25:58.124
Support Microbe TV.

25:58.605 --> 26:01.567
It's time for our annual fundraising drive.

26:02.147 --> 26:07.751
We depend on your support to produce high quality science videos and podcasts.

26:08.272 --> 26:09.833
And now is the time to help us.

26:10.573 --> 26:14.336
If our programs have appealed to your science interests,

26:14.976 --> 26:22.141
or if they have helped you in some way, please record a brief audio or video with your phone and tell us about it.

26:22.642 --> 26:25.144
Let us know how we empower your inner scientist.

26:25.464 --> 26:27.325
We'll use it for our fundraising efforts.

26:27.425 --> 26:30.788
Send it to incubator at microbe.tv.

26:31.288 --> 26:38.273

26:38.773 --> 26:40.475
From microbe.tv, this is Twip.

26:41.257 --> 26:50.001
This Week in Parasitism, episode 248, recorded on November 22nd, 2024.

26:50.721 --> 26:56.944
Oh, nice choice of music, you monkeys.

26:57.144 --> 26:57.744
Wow.

27:00.965 --> 27:05.647
I try very hard not to watch these beforehand because my reaction is a lot better.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.729
And you're listening to the podcast all about parasites.

27:09.724 --> 27:12.085
Joining me today from New York, Daniel Griffin.

27:12.325 --> 27:19.847
I think that's a hairstyle commitment that at one point in time, I think George Clooney made the commitment to, and that's where he's living right now.

27:19.927 --> 27:24.348
Maybe in the late ER stages of George Clooney's thingy, Bob.

27:25.649 --> 27:26.709
Hello, everyone.

27:27.129 --> 27:28.109
What you got on your tie?

27:28.149 --> 27:30.610
It's Friday, so it's got to be an STD, right?

27:32.403 --> 27:34.024
Gonorrhea.

27:34.344 --> 27:35.445
I know, exactly.

27:35.645 --> 27:36.585
The gonococcus.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.607
Is that like cocktail hour or something?

27:41.108 --> 27:45.351
Also joining us from Fort Lee, New Jersey, Dixon DesPommiers.

27:45.711 --> 27:46.531
And ditto.

27:46.591 --> 27:47.392
Hello, everybody.

27:47.412 --> 27:53.916
Today was an auspicious day in the fact that it was cloudy and it was not warm.

27:54.656 --> 27:56.377
And yesterday was even more auspicious.

27:56.697 --> 27:57.858
It actually rained.

27:59.198 --> 28:02.162
So that was an event that hadn't occurred since late September.

28:02.523 --> 28:04.005
Still raining now, supposedly.

28:04.025 --> 28:05.007
It's 40 degrees.

28:05.067 --> 28:05.267
Yeah.

28:05.648 --> 28:09.914
Well, it's not raining here right now, but it might pick up again.

28:10.618 --> 28:12.979
It's cold, it's wet, it's raining where I am.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.122
That sounds like your sailing season has come to an end.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.523
Sounds like Glasgow weather.

28:18.603 --> 28:20.484
No, this is winter sailing season.

28:20.804 --> 28:23.166
I'll let you introduce our last co-host.

28:23.226 --> 28:28.069
Also joining us from Glasgow, Scotland, Christina Nowla.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.209
Hello, everybody.

28:29.329 --> 28:34.793
I think I'm beating you all with the weather because it's been quite nice, freezing cold, but no rain.

28:36.744 --> 28:39.606
I thought it's always cold and wet and rainy in Glasgow.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.828
It's usually wet and windy.

28:42.848 --> 28:44.730
Cold, I don't know, I suppose that's relative.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.431
It's below freezing.

28:46.531 --> 28:47.252
Is that cold?

28:47.692 --> 28:48.252
Yeah, it's cold.

28:48.272 --> 28:51.014
It doesn't usually get that cold, so that's quite unusual.

28:51.054 --> 28:52.916
Anything below 10 C is cold to me.

28:55.094 --> 28:55.654
Okay.

28:55.954 --> 28:59.257
I've had to scrape the car today, so it's definitely cold.

28:59.317 --> 29:01.538
Oh, that's cold.

29:01.558 --> 29:07.762
I was going to tell Dixon that in the winter, I race sailboats every Sunday.

29:08.403 --> 29:10.984
I usually do that with my cousin.

29:11.965 --> 29:16.848
There is this one guy, John Browning, who basically is a professional sailor.

29:16.948 --> 29:23.473
He was a trimmer for the America's Cup, more Newport Bermuda races.

29:24.173 --> 29:28.197
You can look at how many books he's got behind him that are entitled for this thing.

29:28.257 --> 29:31.320
So infectious diseases, parasites, parasites, parasites.

29:31.340 --> 29:33.301
This is not always what he has behind him.

29:33.341 --> 29:37.225
He's got several backgrounds because he's on several shows, I guess.

29:37.265 --> 29:40.768
So he moves his laptop around a little bit and he's always got a new bow tie.

29:41.408 --> 29:43.630
And he looks a lot older after five years.

29:43.670 --> 29:46.353
It's a lot of these people have aged very, very poorly.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.428
I've also aged very, very poorly.

29:51.488 --> 29:54.309
If I look back at my 2020 videos, I was a lot younger.

29:54.549 --> 29:56.449
My kids were a lot younger.

29:56.469 --> 29:57.549
There you can see behind him some cups.

29:57.569 --> 29:59.630
That's, I guess, periticism and that's virology.

30:11.334 --> 30:12.335
So they're making cups.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.216
They got lots of money because all these people are getting stipends.

30:15.256 --> 30:16.317
And he's going to say it again.

30:16.497 --> 30:19.079
He's got this studio in Manhattan, right?

30:19.099 --> 30:19.779
Exactly right.

30:19.839 --> 30:21.040
Yeah.

30:21.180 --> 30:22.281
Could be quite productive.

30:22.341 --> 30:23.982
And also, you know, the fish seem less.

30:24.382 --> 30:26.263
I apologize for the blower in the background.

30:26.323 --> 30:26.843
It's the heater.

30:26.883 --> 30:27.544
It's cold in here.

30:27.624 --> 30:29.505
The river and everything.

30:29.605 --> 30:30.966
And it's beautiful.

30:31.086 --> 30:32.367
Beautiful.

30:32.387 --> 30:33.828
Daniel, did you say nymphing?

30:34.554 --> 30:34.834
Yeah.

30:35.014 --> 30:41.659
So, you know, as Dixon well knows, 80, 90% of a trout's diet is subsurface.

30:41.719 --> 30:43.460
It's not on the surface.

30:43.780 --> 30:49.404
And so if you're surface fly fishing, it's actually not as productive as if it's called nymphing.

30:49.844 --> 31:03.633
And so you actually put a little weight or use a sinking line and you're actually going to get the earlier forms of the arthropods down there to where the trout, you'll often see it looks like they're rising, but they're not rising.

31:03.673 --> 31:04.354
It's the tail.

31:04.894 --> 31:06.395
breaking the surface as they're going down.

31:06.415 --> 31:08.075
That's right, that's right, that's right.

31:08.756 --> 31:09.936
I've never heard that term.

31:10.256 --> 31:14.878
I've only been fishing once, so... There's even a term called euronymphing.

31:15.558 --> 31:19.620
It's a specialty, a way of handling... This all sounds too obscene to me.

31:19.640 --> 31:24.142
Well, it depends on how you do it, but you're right.

31:24.162 --> 31:27.203
Also these beautiful maiden spirits of the water.

31:27.243 --> 31:28.444
That's right, that's right, that's right.

31:28.904 --> 31:29.964
That would be nigh-adding.

31:33.434 --> 31:34.675
Enjoy these conversations.

31:34.695 --> 31:35.636
We'd love to have your support.

31:35.656 --> 31:35.916
Okay.

31:35.936 --> 31:55.950
I just wanted you to see what they're trying to do They're trying to put together a little hokey, you know kind of nice You know for old people and young people alike to love these, you know these very interesting people that talk about biology and so now these four are gonna discuss a paper that's gonna blow your mind because We need I've looked at the paper.

31:55.990 --> 32:00.153
We're gonna have to do some stuff but you know science is under siege and

32:00.509 --> 32:04.091
We have the nomination of RFK Jr.

32:04.171 --> 32:05.852
as head of Health and Human Services.

32:05.872 --> 32:11.495
Someone who has zero qualifications and has contrary views to the health of Americans.

32:13.880 --> 32:18.404
And so, in fact, you should write your senators and oppose his nomination.

32:18.424 --> 32:22.067
I have a website to send you to, safecommunitiescoalition.org.

32:22.227 --> 32:30.213
And of course, this is a very large possibility for Jay Bhattacharya, for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for any of these people.

32:30.253 --> 32:39.601
They could just be taking up time and space in our head, living rent-free until their nomination is spiked and they make a big story about that.

32:39.641 --> 32:43.204
And then in four days, they confirm somebody else that used to work for Big Pharma.

32:46.253 --> 32:48.515
Why isn't that more than likely?

32:50.436 --> 32:58.102
And now you have none other than Vincent Racaniello saying that this is the thing, we have to really get, we have to figure this out, this guy's terrible.

32:58.803 --> 33:05.128
He's already done some streams with Paul Offit about that, the same guy who's been in front of that mic for the last 10 years.

33:07.475 --> 33:09.977
So it's, it's, it's, this is just theater.

33:10.017 --> 33:17.144
You don't have to get really excited about it, unless you're getting excited about it from the pretense that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

33:17.224 --> 33:26.533
could be freed from the people that are currently influencing him and refocused on the most urgent,

33:27.927 --> 33:31.168
of dangers in the United States to our freedom and to our sovereignty.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.809
But I don't think that's going to happen.

33:32.849 --> 33:34.909
And it's not because I think Bobby's a bad guy.

33:34.949 --> 33:52.675
I think it's because the Truman Show-like operation that's being used on all of these people, where groups of people lie to them about the dangers, groups of people lie to them about the biology and about what bioweapons mean and what national security means, and lie to them about who to trust.

33:53.843 --> 34:08.256
And it is the coordinated effort of these people to lie to these puppets, these victims, that gets people into places where they have a book, and they have a single message, and they push ivermectin for five years.

34:09.057 --> 34:14.342
Or they have a substack, and they have a single message, and they push VAERS and the spike protein for several years.

34:16.564 --> 34:19.546
This is all part of the same nonsense.

34:19.606 --> 34:21.367
It's just the opposite side of the coin.

34:21.387 --> 34:22.648
So it looks very foreign.

34:22.668 --> 34:25.610
It looks very mainstream because we're not watching mainstream media.

34:25.991 --> 34:30.994
But this is the alternate side of media on that alternate side of the narrative.

34:31.955 --> 34:37.639
And so it's of utmost importance that we listen to this because these people are the most committed to the bad biology.

34:39.611 --> 34:43.753
FK, you can put your little letter in there, and they have a draft already made for you.

34:44.073 --> 34:45.954
You put where you live, and we'll send it to your senators.

34:45.974 --> 34:47.255
I have a solution for this, by the way, Vincent.

34:47.275 --> 34:48.635
What's the solution, dilution?

34:49.236 --> 34:54.038
No, the solution is that only the Republican kids don't get vaccinated.

34:54.838 --> 34:58.420
Well, you know red states had higher incidence of COVID, right, Daniel?

34:59.681 --> 35:00.341
Red states?

35:00.421 --> 35:06.404
I think Danny Rancor said that it had to do with economic status, but okay, red states, that's good.

35:07.671 --> 35:17.341
Unfortunately, there was what they referred to as red COVID, because early on you saw a lot of the deaths, hospitalization, morbidity in urban centers.

35:18.142 --> 35:25.569
But then, unfortunately, once vaccines were available, once we had a lot of therapeutics available, there was sort of this reverse phenomenon.

35:25.769 --> 35:28.871
where a lot of the other areas were really hard hit.

35:28.891 --> 35:30.291
It really was tough.

35:30.311 --> 35:31.752
I don't understand the messaging.

35:31.792 --> 35:39.015
There was a lot of uptake of the monoclonal antibodies, which, you know, thumbs up, that was fantastic, you know, 80-90% reduction in

35:40.572 --> 35:41.893
and progression in hospitalization.

35:42.253 --> 35:44.354
Unfortunately, no reduction in long COVID.

35:45.234 --> 35:56.379
Where in other areas where you had the vaccines, not only did you get that 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths, we're also now seeing really significant impact.

35:56.399 --> 36:01.741
Probably about the same, probably about a 75% reduction in the risk of long COVID, post-acute sequelae.

36:02.816 --> 36:03.016
Yeah.

36:03.036 --> 36:07.278
So, you know, and I think that, you know, the solution is that.

36:07.878 --> 36:17.741
OK, so now Griffin is going to tell us about the the status of the 30,000 foot, the 30,000 foot view of what happened during covid.

36:19.082 --> 36:21.962
And so let's just take notes and see what kind of.

36:24.923 --> 36:28.545
Let's just see what kind of thing, let me see if I can get this over here.

36:28.945 --> 36:29.605
How does that work?

36:31.406 --> 36:32.166
I think it's this one.

36:34.605 --> 36:38.366
Yeah, let's just take some notes and see what he says about this.

36:40.527 --> 36:48.330
And see if we can, we can succinctly, you know, sort of critique what it is, sorry, what it is that he says here.

36:49.630 --> 36:57.873
I'm very curious about it myself, because it's, it sounded very short through the corner, as they would say in Dutch, it sounds like he took, he left a lot out.

36:57.933 --> 36:58.834
Let's say it like that.

36:58.874 --> 36:59.154
Here we go.

37:01.524 --> 37:08.209
COVID, because, you know, early on, you saw a lot of the deaths, hospitalization, morbidity in urban centers.

37:08.989 --> 37:19.756
But then, unfortunately, once vaccines were available, once we had a lot of therapeutics available, there was sort of this reverse phenomenon where a lot of the other areas were really hard hit.

37:19.776 --> 37:21.177
It really was tough.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.638
I don't understand the messaging.

37:22.658 --> 37:27.862
There was a lot of uptake of the monoclonal antibodies, which, you know, thumbs up.

37:27.902 --> 37:28.923
That was fantastic.

37:29.123 --> 37:31.064
You know, 80, 90 percent reduction in

37:31.384 --> 37:35.227
in progression, hospitalization, unfortunately, no reduction in long COVID.

37:36.088 --> 37:52.620
Where in other areas where you had the vaccines, not only did you get that 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths, but we're also now seeing really significant impact, probably about the same, probably about a 75% reduction in the risk of long COVID post-acute sequelae.

37:53.661 --> 37:53.861
Yeah.

37:53.901 --> 37:58.865
So, you know, and I think that, you know, you know, what is it, the solution to pollution is dilution.

37:58.946 --> 38:10.555
So maybe if we can dilute out the misinformation with accurate information from those of us who are not trying to sell you a snake oil, then yeah, maybe, maybe we can make a difference.

38:10.595 --> 38:14.158
So, but we, yeah, we need your money so we can get our, our, absolutely.

38:14.339 --> 38:15.900
We need your money.

38:24.895 --> 38:25.335
Wow.

38:25.455 --> 38:30.457
So early on, early on, it was in urban areas, that would be the blue effect.

38:30.497 --> 38:38.599
And then after we got vaccines and therapeutics, it kind of reversed to all the red states, which, okay.

38:38.619 --> 38:45.001
90% of reduction in hospitalizations and death in the vaccinated population is of course wrong.

38:46.281 --> 38:49.042
And a reduction in long COVID is comical.

38:49.122 --> 38:49.922
I mean, I don't even know.

38:51.182 --> 38:52.843
But again, remember what we're doing here.

38:54.520 --> 39:06.267
This is what happens at a seminar in any university when they give their introduction and they say that there are several genes for autism and one of the genes for autism is this one, according to that paper.

39:06.307 --> 39:10.249
And so we made a knockout mouse of that gene and now here's the data from it.

39:11.990 --> 39:12.890
And what happened there?

39:12.990 --> 39:17.613
Everybody in the room accepted that there are genes for autism and that it has a list and that list is there.

39:17.653 --> 39:20.855
And so when they go on to their next talk, that's already what they think is real.

39:22.563 --> 39:27.464
No different than everybody listening to this talk, listening to this thing says, oh yeah, that's right.

39:27.504 --> 39:31.346
I heard that once, that there was a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and death.

39:31.806 --> 39:32.406
That's great.

39:32.446 --> 39:33.706
I'm glad that Nate took it.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.027
I'm sure Nate's daughters are really glad he took it.

39:38.968 --> 39:50.671
Because that 90% reduction in hospitalization and death due to COVID is also balanced out by a few people every year having an aneurysm they shouldn't have had, having a stroke they shouldn't have had, having a heart attack or three that they shouldn't have had.

39:56.465 --> 40:05.059
And so the Bad Biology 101 starts right away, right off with a COVID bad biology, a pandemic enchantment.

40:06.335 --> 40:30.107
All through this discussion that you just heard right there, everybody that's listening to this, that listens to it often, is confirming in their head that these four people agree there was a pandemic, there's long COVID, there is COVID, it's still spreading, vaccines helped, the vaccines were great, there were therapeutics, some of them are called, I don't know, Paxlovid and Remdesivir.

40:32.446 --> 40:37.390
Dilution is the solution to pollution and dilution is in fact what they've done to me.

40:38.431 --> 40:51.241
By taking little bits and pieces of what I was saying in 2020 and twisting them around in my head and forcing me, coercing me, encouraging me to become the expert on lab leaks.

40:54.324 --> 40:58.747
And less of a skeptic of the basic biology of a pandemic.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.690
Less of a skeptic of the basic biology of a pandemic.

41:02.705 --> 41:05.446
please be less of a skeptic of the pandemic.

41:05.906 --> 41:10.188
You can be skeptic of the shot, just don't be skeptic of the pandemic.

41:10.288 --> 41:12.109
And that is what they do here.

41:12.289 --> 41:23.794
Every time, no matter what they're going to talk about, they first got to reinforce the overarching narrative of evolution because DNA and RNA can pandemic.

41:23.834 --> 41:24.694
This is a lie.

41:26.789 --> 41:39.797
but they just reinforced it with a long, long, long diatribe about all the details that supposedly confirm that RNA can and is in the process of an ongoing pandemic and transition into endemicity.

41:40.677 --> 41:50.143
Wait, speaking of snake oil, you know, Dr. Oz was nominated as head of Medicare, Medicaid services, right?

41:50.323 --> 41:51.424
What do you think about that, Daniel?

41:53.739 --> 42:17.303
Unfortunately, as well, I think many of us, three of the four of us, Columbia faculty, there was actually a letter, which I think was signed by maybe 10 or 12 Columbia faculty, basically calling out for the fact that he was knowingly misinforming people so that he could sell his products, he could sell his

42:18.063 --> 42:19.765
So I think that's probably what brings it up.

42:19.785 --> 42:40.438
So that's not OK to take someone, put him in the head of Medicare, Medicaid, CMS, who has a history of ethical laxity, of actually basically misinforming, lying for their own financial self-interest.

42:40.538 --> 42:41.879
That's not OK in my book.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.301
I apparently also owns a lot of Medicare companies as well.

42:47.341 --> 42:48.462
So that would benefit him.

42:49.862 --> 42:50.462
Oh, interesting.

42:50.502 --> 42:51.142
So yeah.

42:52.483 --> 42:54.904
Well, I hearken back to that quote that I am often.

42:55.404 --> 43:04.566
So while they're talking about Medicare, I'll take the time to remind you that the cost of old people and that whole program is about half of the US budget.

43:05.207 --> 43:09.288
And because of the population pyramid problem, that budget was about to balloon.

43:10.197 --> 43:17.565
And so I am making the argument along with a few other people that they murdered people and lied about it in order to manage that problem.

43:19.489 --> 43:25.050
And so it's very funny that these people are talking around that, you know, talking about it, but not talking about it.

43:25.330 --> 43:42.894
The one big elephant in the room is that this increase in all cause mortality, this increase in Medicare, Medicaid burden, this increase in retirees relative to the productive taxpaying working class, this has been foreseen for a couple decades now.

43:48.530 --> 43:51.132
And these people may not be sophisticated enough to know it.

43:51.192 --> 43:59.859
It's very possible that they're not, because again, these are academic biologists who spend their whole day trying to focus on the most important problem in the world.

43:59.919 --> 44:02.741
And that's the one that their lab does experiments about.

44:03.582 --> 44:08.306
Almost their entire life has been spent focused on that.

44:09.467 --> 44:16.933
To the chagrin of their kids, their marriage, their hobbies, their physical health,

44:22.644 --> 44:28.748
prone to say when this topic comes up, but it rings true virtually every time I say it.

44:29.268 --> 44:36.412
Mark Twain was quoted as saying that there's only one criminal class in America, and that's Congress.

44:36.672 --> 44:44.177
The other thing that Mark Twain has quoted, another one that I like a lot better than that, is that he always told the truth because then you don't have to remember anything.

44:45.862 --> 44:47.523
And that's kind of my shtick.

44:47.683 --> 44:50.805
That's kind of how I get through this and make sure that I don't lose my mind.

44:50.845 --> 44:56.568
I just keep telling the truth all the time and show all my cards as often as I can so that nobody ever doubts.

44:56.708 --> 44:57.649
Nobody can ever doubt.

44:57.709 --> 45:04.773
Nobody can point to me and say that I just tried my best and made a mistake for more than a year and a half.

45:06.774 --> 45:11.437
And so people I love died because they took this shot as a working vaccine.

45:11.477 --> 45:15.159
They took this pandemic as a potential lab leak disaster.

45:22.717 --> 45:26.981
And everyone laughed, and then they stopped laughing when they realized it was true.

45:27.221 --> 45:27.641
It's true.

45:27.721 --> 45:28.121
Yeah.

45:28.542 --> 45:28.782
Yeah.

45:28.882 --> 45:33.606
I mean, I don't want to make all our programs a, well, maybe it is okay.

45:33.626 --> 45:37.629
All our programs really are about combating anti-science and misinformation.

45:38.210 --> 45:40.011
Without funding, there is no science.

45:40.772 --> 45:40.972
Yeah.

45:41.662 --> 45:43.843
And the funding all comes from government.

45:44.223 --> 45:46.444
One of the things that RFK Jr.

45:46.484 --> 45:52.225
has said before is that he would like an eight-year pause on infectious disease research in the U.S.

45:55.626 --> 45:58.987
Many of our programs are about infectious diseases, right?

45:59.247 --> 46:02.869
Today we're going to talk about a paper that involves infectious disease research.

46:02.969 --> 46:10.231
So to think that you could stop it for eight years is the silliest of silly notions, to put it mildly.

46:11.231 --> 46:19.314
Okay, so they're going to talk about some infectious disease research today, and we're going to critique that research as whether or not it's valuable or not.

46:20.274 --> 46:21.415
It's not even possible.

46:22.235 --> 46:25.576
It reflects an ignorance of what infectious disease research is.

46:25.596 --> 46:26.736
Where is the Scottish lady?

46:26.776 --> 46:28.617
Why is she just a voice in the background?

46:28.637 --> 46:39.141
Maybe that leads us right into our paper, which is where infectious disease research may actually be tapping into Alzheimer's disease, which, you know,

46:43.152 --> 46:51.716
So remember that Alzheimer's disease could not be the exposure, the intramuscular exposure to toxins, could not be that.

46:52.496 --> 47:00.479
It can't be the ingestion of toxins, the inhalation of toxins, the cutaneous exposure to toxins.

47:00.519 --> 47:01.620
It can't be any of that.

47:03.703 --> 47:17.007
Alzheimer's disease is a specific phenomenon that these parasitologists are going to define based on what they've heard from other biologists, not because they've done the experiments or read enough to know.

47:17.528 --> 47:27.891
I assure you, no, none, no, none of these four have spent any significant time reading into the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease, none of them.

47:28.791 --> 47:33.173
They only know what they've read in maybe a review article.

47:34.701 --> 47:43.228
But more likely, they know what they have heard from a seminar that came to their department sometime where somebody told them about Alzheimer's and a mouse model of it.

47:44.729 --> 47:50.073
And you're going to see it very clearly when they expound on and you know,

47:52.652 --> 47:58.317
dissect this paper, and nowhere on their radar is the idea that what they're doing is absurd.

47:58.377 --> 48:00.599
What they did in the paper is absurd.

48:00.639 --> 48:01.700
The data is absurd.

48:01.760 --> 48:02.721
The model is absurd.

48:02.761 --> 48:06.044
The whole question in the context of that model is absurd.

48:06.224 --> 48:11.008
Nowhere are they going to get to it except for one guy, and that's Dixon, and they hate him.

48:11.789 --> 48:13.670
And they have to talk over him all the time.

48:13.710 --> 48:16.373
That's this old dude here down in the bottom.

48:17.153 --> 48:20.016
I guess he can barely see my cursor there.

48:21.375 --> 48:29.180
Um, so I'll, I'll make them big for a little bit and then, uh, I'll keep taking notes and we will, um, we'll see what we get here.

48:34.104 --> 48:36.145
We shall we jump into it.

48:36.225 --> 48:38.006
Okay.

48:38.066 --> 48:39.527
So this is why you're here.

48:39.647 --> 48:42.209
So we're going to discuss what's real FSA.

48:42.229 --> 48:43.350
It's a, it's a great paper.

48:44.076 --> 48:44.517
A great paper.

48:44.597 --> 48:56.070
And so this is a paper entitled Toxoplasma gondii infection of Alzheimer's disease mice reduces brain amyloid density globally and regionally.

48:56.170 --> 48:57.752
And you know, I'm old school.

48:57.772 --> 48:58.793
I printed it out.

49:00.519 --> 49:16.929
So the authors are Catherine Yanes, Nathaniel Guanzon, Ricardo Azevedo, Damian Wheeler, Sunil Gandhi, and Melissa B. Loden.

49:18.049 --> 49:21.932
And a lot of these authors are from California.

49:21.992 --> 49:38.205
So Department of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, and also Translucence Biosystems, Irvine, California.

49:39.145 --> 49:44.169
So it helps to clarify the title a little bit.

49:44.976 --> 49:52.158
And that is that we're not talking about globally and regionally, geographically, we're talking about it in the regions of the brain.

49:52.178 --> 50:01.861
It's a little, you know, for anyone not really up on this literature, perhaps they would be a little bit confused about the

50:03.587 --> 50:09.049
How did you get mice out of a regional... No, we're not going there.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.190
Which part of the world does it help the mice?

50:11.330 --> 50:13.331
It just confounds the issues.

50:13.731 --> 50:31.739
No, but they do talk about the brain as... So he's there, kind of, but because he's so entrenched, so deeply lost in the bad biology of evolution because DNA, bad biology that there's no...

50:32.580 --> 50:39.064
There's no firm line between things that are pattern integrities and things that aren't.

50:39.745 --> 50:50.091
There's no even mental energy expended on trying to discern where pattern integrities borders are or anything like that because they're not thinking that way.

50:52.573 --> 50:58.096
And this guy starts to see it already, but wait until you see the details of what he's really talking about.

50:58.596 --> 51:00.658
None of these guys are neuroscientists.

51:01.687 --> 51:03.349
None of these guys are neurobiologists.

51:03.429 --> 51:09.854
And it's an interesting combination paper where they're using neurobiology to do a parasitology paper.

51:10.215 --> 51:13.758
They're using neurobiology to do Alzheimer's research.

51:13.898 --> 51:18.522
And you can see exactly how shitty academic biology has become.

51:18.922 --> 51:25.769
And now think that some of those authors that we watched there a second ago, some of those authors are in training.

51:26.755 --> 51:26.975
Right?

51:27.696 --> 51:30.218
Some of those authors are post-docs in training.

51:31.159 --> 51:33.381
Global Institute for Immunology.

51:34.923 --> 51:35.923
So the.

51:37.245 --> 51:37.345
Ah.

51:38.926 --> 51:39.407
No.

51:40.548 --> 51:41.248
What happened there?

51:44.812 --> 51:47.654
Oh, I went back, I went, I went over to slide, what did I do?

51:49.536 --> 51:50.477
Yeah, ships.

51:56.545 --> 51:58.610
Alzheimer's is a form of dementia.

51:59.051 --> 52:00.774
This is Alzheimer's what's going on.

52:00.854 --> 52:03.981
It just confounds the issue geographically.

52:05.103 --> 52:11.305
biology, biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California Institute.

52:11.545 --> 52:15.107
And so this is a paper entitled Toxoplasma.

52:15.387 --> 52:28.072
Yeah, so these people right here, this one, you know, this is the, this is the person who's teaching everybody, this might be a postdoc, this might be a technician, this might be a technician, this might be a PhD student, this might be a PhD student, or they could all be

52:28.752 --> 52:38.467
PhD students and grad students that are all learning about biology, and all think that they're learning about how Alzheimer's disease works by working on this mouse.

52:40.850 --> 52:43.915
And so you can read here, oops, darn it, I did it again.

52:54.127 --> 52:54.547
Where is it?

52:55.207 --> 52:55.728
I'm sorry.

52:56.228 --> 53:05.871
And so now what we need to think about to answer the questions that I want to ask, what questions, what models, what we need to think about is, okay, first,

53:17.960 --> 53:18.520
Background.

53:18.680 --> 53:27.122
Toxoplasma gondii infection of Alzheimer's disease model mice decreases amyloid beta plaques.

53:29.903 --> 53:39.765
We aim to determine if there is a brain regional difference in amyloid beta reduction in the brains of gonadi infected compared to control mice.

53:39.845 --> 53:42.146
So apparently they already had a paper

53:43.220 --> 53:52.729
where they showed that amyloid beta in the brain of these mice was decreased when they were exposed to or infected by Toxoplasma gondii.

53:54.010 --> 53:54.891
Whatever the hell that is.

53:54.931 --> 53:57.193
I think that's the stuff that comes out of cat litter boxes.

53:59.135 --> 54:05.541
I know that there was a person who contacted me a couple years ago who wanted me to think about the possibility that COVID was actually this.

54:06.624 --> 54:16.509
So I find it curious that this is a paper that TWIP or whatever this one is called, has decided to cover.

54:16.549 --> 54:18.770
So that's the reason, one of the reasons why I'm here.

54:19.250 --> 54:30.596
Another reason why I'm here, of course, is because amyloidosis was something that a lot of people were saying the spike protein could do, that it was an amyloid generating protein or it could cause amyloidosis.

54:32.472 --> 54:33.673
And that's very different.

54:33.813 --> 54:41.581
Please understand that saying the spike protein can cause amyloidosis is very different than saying that transfection can cause amyloidosis.

54:43.683 --> 54:51.791
It's very different than saying transfection with a pseudo-uridine M1 modified mRNA, it could cause amyloidosis.

54:51.851 --> 54:54.254
It's different than saying, you see,

54:56.055 --> 55:02.258
And so these people, of course, first need to tell you what they know about this stuff, even though they don't actually know it.

55:02.298 --> 55:03.218
They were just told it.

55:03.258 --> 55:09.421
They were handed these tools and they are going to tell you how these tools work, even though they're just all air tools.

55:10.402 --> 55:12.242
You know, this is how an air hammer works.

55:12.803 --> 55:14.684
This is how an air screwdriver works.

55:15.064 --> 55:17.385
And so now we're going to build an imaginary tree house.

55:25.626 --> 55:29.892
And because so much of this is cerebral, this discussion, that's essentially what you're doing.

55:30.532 --> 55:35.018
Globally and regionally, and I'm old school, I printed it out.

55:36.750 --> 55:48.697
So the authors are Catherine Yanes, Nathaniel Guanzon, Ricardo Azevedo, Damian Wheeler, Sunil Gandhi.

55:48.998 --> 55:50.238
I just wanted to make that point.

55:50.298 --> 55:50.879
I apologize.

55:50.899 --> 55:53.440
We'll just let this play because otherwise I'll screw up where it is.

55:54.281 --> 55:58.063
And a lot of these authors are from California.

55:58.243 --> 56:02.466
So Department of Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, University of California,

56:03.186 --> 56:19.454
Irvine, Irvine, California, Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, and also Translucence Biosystems, Irvine, California.

56:20.374 --> 56:25.437
So it helps to clarify the title a little bit.

56:26.177 --> 56:30.139
And that is that we're not talking about globally and regionally, geographically.

56:30.831 --> 56:33.375
We're talking about it in the regions of the brain.

56:33.395 --> 56:43.111
It's a little, you know, for anyone not really up on this literature, perhaps they would be a little bit confused about the

56:44.813 --> 56:45.233
How did you?

56:45.473 --> 56:53.898
So one of the things that they didn't they're not going to say and not explain is that they're they're using an anatomical measurement and a stain for for amyloid.

56:53.958 --> 57:02.763
So what they do is they use this very special thing called I disco, which is a acronym for some way of clearing the brain.

57:02.803 --> 57:07.906
What they mean by clearing the brain is that a couple of three, four years ago, five years ago, somebody

57:08.826 --> 57:10.668
I don't remember who it was first figured this out.

57:10.688 --> 57:13.130
You could do it with urea and you can do it with other ways.

57:13.610 --> 57:15.231
There are lots of different methods for doing it.

57:15.291 --> 57:16.572
You can essentially make a

57:18.345 --> 57:23.849
the lipids and the fats of a mouse brain translucent.

57:24.550 --> 57:28.753
And you do it by like dissolving things and, you know, maybe you replace some things.

57:28.833 --> 57:38.120
I don't know all the details of it, but in this paper, they use something called iDisco, which is a methodology to clear the whole brain so that you can image through it from top to bottom.

57:38.681 --> 57:42.244
And so on the back of that, the proteins are still supposedly all there.

57:42.644 --> 57:45.947
They can use an antibody that's fluorescent to stain

57:47.040 --> 58:00.048
where the amyloid is, and then they can image through the whole brain and see in the control mice versus the mice that were infected with Toxoplasmoda gandhi, have different distributions of amyloid in their brain.

58:00.088 --> 58:12.356
And that's what he means, they're going to look at anatomical regions in the brain where the amyloid is present in the control group, and then look to what extent is the amyloid present in the group that is infected.

58:12.436 --> 58:14.398
So that's already

58:16.949 --> 58:23.131
It's already a very bad representation for what's going on because on that background, what is the mouse?

58:24.631 --> 58:30.473
And maybe as a non-academic biologist, this is one of those crucial questions that you need to ask very early on.

58:30.553 --> 58:32.473
What is the mouse model they're using?

58:32.533 --> 58:42.436
Is it an inbred line with a name like Sprague Dolly rats or Long Evans rats or C57 Black 6 mice?

58:46.536 --> 58:47.798
Or is it a knockout mouse?

58:48.979 --> 58:50.221
Is it a knock-in mouse?

58:51.363 --> 58:53.025
Is it a regional knock-in mouse?

58:53.976 --> 59:08.968
And so it matters very greatly because if they are using a genetically modified inbred strain, then they're using a pattern integrity that probably is orders of magnitude and distance away from any relation to how our pattern integrity works.

59:09.268 --> 59:13.872
A mouse is already quite a distance away from how our pattern integrity works.

59:13.912 --> 59:16.374
They're lacking the complications that we have.

59:16.414 --> 59:20.678
And so it's not gonna be possible to understand how we work by looking at them.

59:21.840 --> 59:33.705
The analogy that I used the other day was if you want to study the finest Swiss watch, you better not start by, or you're not going to get very far if your only experiments are done on cuckoo clocks.

59:35.964 --> 59:37.945
You'll learn a lot about how clocks work.

59:37.985 --> 59:55.838
You might learn a lot about how the basic gear mechanisms, you might be able to identify the timekeeping parts of a Swiss watch, but if it's got all the calendar functions or a date wheel or all these other things, you're gonna have to, you're not just gonna learn very much from a cuckoo clock.

01:00:00.703 --> 01:00:17.104
And this is a horribly short analogy for the difference between the pattern integrity and, and the requirements and, and, and, and operation of it at a mouse level and the pattern integrity and the operational requirements of it at the human level.

01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:36.294
because we live longer, because our development is longer, because our intelligence is higher, because our conceptual ability is higher, and all of those things require necessarily an infrastructure of biological mechanisms that don't exist at the level of a mouse.

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:39.795
And yet here these people already are accepting

01:00:40.675 --> 01:00:51.304
this mouse model, without inadequate description even, a mouse model as equivalent to and useful to studying a phenomenon in our own pattern integrity.

01:00:53.205 --> 01:00:53.726
And why?

01:00:54.126 --> 01:01:09.999
Because this mouse has a homologue of a protein that some very poor scientists in academia have convinced us is crucially related to the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:14.632
when in reality it's turned out that most of those papers were fraudulent.

01:01:15.893 --> 01:01:23.737
It's not that amyloid beta isn't there or is there or whatever, but it doesn't appear to be the central cog of the mechanism.

01:01:23.777 --> 01:01:27.259
It doesn't appear to be the spike protein of amyloidosis.

01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:30.561
It doesn't appear to be the spike protein of Alzheimer's disease.

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:39.907
It's there and it does stuff, but what they can show or pretend that it does in vitro is not confirmable in vivo.

01:01:42.807 --> 01:01:57.291
There's lots of other things that happen like neuronal death and the retraction of long myelin tracks and all kinds of other changes that occur that yeah, amyloid might be there, but amyloid is not causing all this to happen.

01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:09.274
But now we are going to have a mouse model that qualifies as a model of Alzheimer's because there is overexpression of amyloid in the brain.

01:02:11.544 --> 01:02:13.046
I mean, this is extraordinary.

01:02:14.588 --> 01:02:19.355
Get mice out of a regional, no, we're not going there.

01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:21.958
Which part of the world does it help the mice, but no.

01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:23.641
It just confounds the issues.

01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:26.825
No, but they do talk about the brain as a globe.

01:02:29.675 --> 01:02:32.276
a global issue because it's got so many parts.

01:02:33.036 --> 01:02:37.517
Yeah, no, and I think that that's going to be an area that we'll touch on.

01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:45.999
I mean, I think they could have just gone away with, you know, Toxoplasma gondii infection reduces brain amyloid density.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:55.721
But there is some parts where it becomes interesting for those sort of deeper in the weeds about the different areas of the brain that they're going to look at.

01:02:55.801 --> 01:02:55.921
So,

01:02:56.021 --> 01:02:56.181
Right.

01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:58.643
What an interesting choice of words deeper in the weeds.

01:02:58.703 --> 01:02:59.723
They're not in the weeds.

01:03:01.584 --> 01:03:06.648
They're lost, not even in, they're lost in the weeds of ideas that don't make sense.

01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:08.289
For sure.

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:15.113
But the funny thing is, is that these people think they're not lost in those same weeds.

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:25.455
So maybe we should start off just by talking about Alzheimer's and the current theories about what causes Alzheimer's, what's going on.

01:03:25.515 --> 01:03:28.476
So I'll start off with just the clinical perspective.

01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:30.756
What is Alzheimer's?

01:03:30.776 --> 01:03:35.077
So Alzheimer's disease is a form of dementia.

01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:40.679
And one of the things clinically we make a distinction from is it's memory loss.

01:03:41.979 --> 01:03:50.301
sort of this memory loss that we expect, unfortunately, as people get older, just forgetting things, compared to dementia.

01:03:50.841 --> 01:04:00.964
There are lots of mouse models where the entorhinal cortex and the cells of the entorhinal cortex that present, project to the hippocampus are the first cells to deteriorate during Alzheimer's.

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:08.426
And so this actually could be the key because that is a central part of the memory circuit of the hippocampus and as part of the

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.908
memory circuit that I spent my time studying.

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:30.708
And so from the perspective of the hippocampus, I think the state of the art would be to say that certain cells of layer two of the medial entorhinal cortex may be the first cells to be lost, and that may explain why specifically Alzheimer's disease people have a short-term memory problem and a problem with navigation.

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:37.228
So amyloid is on a lot of places that cells don't die.

01:04:37.288 --> 01:04:46.032
And so it's, again, I'm just saying that I'm not one of, I played in this sandbox before, so I know what they're talking about.

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:48.414
Dementia is really a cognitive dysfunction.

01:04:49.174 --> 01:04:55.057
It's confusion, disorientation, trouble, activities of daily living.

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:58.159
So Alzheimer's is a form of dementia.

01:04:59.732 --> 01:05:03.414
And it's one of the neurodegenerative forms of dementia.

01:05:03.794 --> 01:05:07.677
So breaking them in, we have vascular dementia.

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:17.842
So someone might have major or minor infarcts, ischemia, damage to the brain, not getting enough blood supply to different parts of the brain.

01:05:17.862 --> 01:05:19.803
So we have our vascular dementias.

01:05:20.604 --> 01:05:28.748
And then we have a whole group of these neurodegenerative, where it seems that the brain itself is degenerating over time.

01:05:30.067 --> 01:05:34.311
When we get to Alzheimer's And so it's not related to toxins.

01:05:34.391 --> 01:05:37.154
It's not related to intramuscular toxin exposure.

01:05:37.274 --> 01:05:54.228
It is related to the brain deteriorating I guess There's been I'm gonna say three major theories on Types pathogenesis what's driving and the number one that people have probably heard most about is the the amyloid

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:56.400
theory.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.762
And it's interesting because they talk about camps.

01:05:58.802 --> 01:06:00.924
They talk about people who are in the amyloid camp.

01:06:01.484 --> 01:06:03.766
They talk about people who are in the tau camp.

01:06:03.786 --> 01:06:08.830
So the other is there are these tau that form.

01:06:09.171 --> 01:06:16.377
And then there's this inflammatory, the idea that, oh, those are all just sort of markers of an ongoing inflammatory process.

01:06:17.967 --> 01:06:21.730
and if people had any comments sort of there before we go moving forward.

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.553
It's interesting the way there's- Anybody have any comments there?

01:06:24.593 --> 01:06:26.374
Because I don't really know what I'm talking about.

01:06:26.434 --> 01:06:34.262
I'm just kind of regurgitating what I heard in a couple seminars or what I read in a very cursory book a long time ago or in the introduction to the last paper.

01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:47.097
There's an amyloid camp, a tau camp, and an inflammatory camp, and they all do bullshit experiments and bullshit mouse models, and they all justify themselves as being right, and that's why you have to fund them.

01:06:48.017 --> 01:06:49.858
And none of them ever attack each other.

01:06:49.998 --> 01:06:55.760
These guys are not gonna, the tau camp is not gonna do experiments to show that amyloid camp is full of shit.

01:06:56.821 --> 01:07:02.703
And the amyloid camp is not gonna get funded to do tau experiments to show that tau experiment people are full of shit.

01:07:03.723 --> 01:07:14.352
And for sure, the inflammatory camp is not going to get any funding to do experiments to prove that amyloid and tau are just byproducts of some other thing.

01:07:16.654 --> 01:07:19.976
They can get experiments to show that inflammation is important.

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:23.419
They can get funding to show that tau might be important.

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:26.222
They can get funding to show that amyloid might be important.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:29.985
But none of them will ever get funding to show why the other ideas are wrong.

01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:33.590
And they are discouraged from doing that.

01:07:39.254 --> 01:07:42.876
And so what you get is three different sources of bullshit.

01:07:43.156 --> 01:07:51.741
And it's bullshit guaranteed because by definition, they aren't trying to disprove other people's model to make their model sharper.

01:07:52.221 --> 01:07:56.924
They're barely trying to test their own because they're using p-values and null hypotheses.

01:07:58.444 --> 01:08:03.953
And the null hypothesis is based on the idea that amyloid has something to do with Alzheimer's disease.

01:08:04.774 --> 01:08:11.125
And so a good model of Alzheimer's disease would be a mouse that expresses a crap ton of amyloid in its brain.

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:16.710
There's camps here.

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:19.772
It isn't a bipartisan.

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:21.232
You've got the partisan here.

01:08:21.272 --> 01:08:25.295
You've got one side, the aisle, the amyloid people, they want all the funding.

01:08:25.315 --> 01:08:27.576
You've got the tau people, they want all the funding.

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:31.939
Is this the Green Party, the inflammatory people?

01:08:35.161 --> 01:08:39.684
Only if there's pus coming out of us.

01:08:39.724 --> 01:08:43.506
You also might want to add that Alzheimer's disease is on the rise.

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:46.383
And I believe that's a global problem.

01:08:47.063 --> 01:08:48.884
It's not just a regional problem.

01:08:50.205 --> 01:08:52.686
It's wherever you go, it's increasing.

01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:56.648
So- I suppose that's got something to do with the aging population.

01:08:56.668 --> 01:08:59.069
It might, very well.

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:01.931
The aging population has nothing to do with anything.

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:04.292
The aging population is not the pandemic.

01:09:04.352 --> 01:09:06.353
It's not the rise in all cause mortality.

01:09:06.413 --> 01:09:08.174
It's not the rise of death in hospitals.

01:09:08.514 --> 01:09:12.876
It's not the rise of death as a result of not using antibiotics or supplemental oxygen.

01:09:12.976 --> 01:09:13.577
Come on.

01:09:14.477 --> 01:09:18.261
We're not expecting old people diseases because of old people.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:27.289
We're not expecting old people diseases that come from a long life of exposure to toxins to start manifesting more if we have more old people, are we?

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:28.631
That would be crazy.

01:09:41.202 --> 01:09:42.563
That's a good point actually.

01:09:42.964 --> 01:09:48.871
Is it not, I presume you're meaning Alzheimer's in general and not early onset Alzheimer's that's on the rise?

01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:50.813
Is that another camp?

01:09:51.734 --> 01:09:52.215
I don't know.

01:10:04.335 --> 01:10:14.422
So these purported experts, aka jackasses, are on here trying to lecture us about the biology of Alzheimer's, and they're not even aware that there's early-onset Alzheimer's.

01:10:18.264 --> 01:10:24.688
Now this Scottish lady's gonna point out, what else, I mean, what else could she possibly point out here?

01:10:25.128 --> 01:10:26.209
Parasitologist!

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:31.853
It is clear, I mean, Alzheimer's is- I don't know, I'm a parasitologist!

01:10:35.185 --> 01:10:35.505
Wow.

01:10:36.206 --> 01:10:37.247
It's just pathetic.

01:10:37.627 --> 01:10:47.195
But I say it's pathetic with the self-deprecating knowledge that I was as gung-ho as these guys and then more so.

01:10:49.137 --> 01:10:56.143
And if you'd have met me in Norway when I was a neuroscientist or a neurobiologist and talked to me about evolution, I would have eaten you for lunch.

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:06.543
Just make sure you realize that I'm very humbly submitting that all the time, that I was as bamboozled as these people.

01:11:07.204 --> 01:11:14.729
And that's why I think I have a unique job to do because I can, you know, I was there and in it and all in.

01:11:14.989 --> 01:11:24.096
I had the sweatshirts and the t-shirts and the hats and I wanted to have pit, pit, uh, chairs in my house.

01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:28.819
And I wanted to wear the pit blue and yellow because I was proud to be working for that place.

01:11:30.725 --> 01:11:33.182
The guy who invented the polio vaccine came from there.

01:11:33.203 --> 01:11:33.787
Are you kidding me?

01:11:37.153 --> 01:11:42.157
something in general associated with advanced age, like as people get older.

01:11:42.217 --> 01:11:49.002
So as you have an advancing population, people stay alive long enough, then you can start to see dementia and some of it.

01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:51.003
And there's a couple of things that go through here.

01:11:51.043 --> 01:12:04.133
So the idea of the amyloid hypothesis, which we're going to talk quite a bit about today, is this notion that the amyloid plaque accumulation itself, like the amyloid itself is toxic.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:14.463
And so the amyloid accumulates, it causes neural damage, it triggers the inflammation, it then leads to the cognitive deficits, right?

01:12:14.483 --> 01:12:18.024
So that's going to be a lot of this paper is talking about.

01:12:18.344 --> 01:12:20.225
And of course, tau is the same thing.

01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:30.470
Tau just says that that protein is more important than the other protein, but it's an accumulation of, or it's a toxic accumulation of the same protein, depending on how you want to say it.

01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:32.051
But they're both very different concepts.

01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:40.957
It's important to be accurate about it or precise about it, or it's important to realize whether he realizes it or not, that those are two different things.

01:12:40.997 --> 01:12:47.462
The accumulation of a toxic protein or the toxic accumulation of a protein are two different things, but that's okay, whatever.

01:12:48.023 --> 01:12:57.530
Then, you know, you would think like, well, if there's some way to decrease the amyloid, then we can decrease the neurotoxicity, we can decrease the inflammation, we can make folks better.

01:12:59.262 --> 01:13:08.065
And as mentioned, this is a... And so I guess the basic simple thing is, is that inflammation is caused by amyloid and so it's a chicken or egg question and they can go on forever like that.

01:13:13.107 --> 01:13:18.809
And their only evidence will be that if we overexpress amyloid in the brain of a mouse, there's a lot of inflammatory signals there.

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.752
We're not even close to the worst part of this yet.

01:13:26.772 --> 01:13:27.552
You're not going to believe it.

01:13:27.952 --> 01:13:32.095
This is a huge problem affecting a lot of folks as they get older.

01:13:32.635 --> 01:13:34.516
And they start off with this background.

01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:38.598
And there isn't a lot of data in this paper, to be honest.

01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:39.939
There's two figures that we'll go through.

01:13:39.959 --> 01:13:40.659
That's right.

01:13:40.699 --> 01:13:43.781
But there's a lot of background context.

01:13:44.141 --> 01:13:48.924
So one of the things- There's a lot of background context, which you could also call mythology.

01:13:51.015 --> 01:14:01.479
There's a lot of mythology, there's a lot of summaries of other labs' hypotheses that have yet to be proven, and that summary is presented as almost fact.

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:10.542
And if you read that crap all day long, it doesn't sink in in the right way.

01:14:10.922 --> 01:14:12.563
I know because I did it for 20 years.

01:14:15.037 --> 01:14:19.063
It sinks in in a way where again, you know, here's a imaginary hammer.

01:14:19.124 --> 01:14:20.666
Here's an imaginary screwdriver.

01:14:20.726 --> 01:14:21.948
Here's an imaginary drill.

01:14:22.429 --> 01:14:24.933
Now let's build an imaginary tree house together.

01:14:24.973 --> 01:14:26.896
And an hour later, you're climbing around in it.

01:14:31.789 --> 01:14:49.437
As they point out, and I'm just gonna read this straight from the intro here, recent studies have shown a link between infection with the obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and protection from Alzheimer's dementia-associated pathology in mouse models.

01:14:49.678 --> 01:14:58.642
So in mouse models, they have seen something, so they are justifying their further work in the mouse model because in the mouse model, they've seen something.

01:15:03.905 --> 01:15:05.506
And it's not just a mouse model.

01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:10.410
It's a inbred genetically altered mouse model.

01:15:14.894 --> 01:15:24.662
And then they mentioned that T. gondii is estimated to infect 13.3% of the US population and up to one third of the world's human.

01:15:24.942 --> 01:15:32.528
So why in the hell wouldn't we just do a survey and find out how many people with Toxoplasma gondii get AD and then be done with it?

01:15:34.471 --> 01:15:46.197
And if there's a signal, you'll see it across all the old folks homes and all the old folks that live at home and all the people that come into the hospital because when they check the box, yeah, I like cats, they don't get Alzheimer's disease.

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:53.580
But instead we're working on a genetic mouse model.

01:15:55.421 --> 01:16:01.384
I mean, and teaching kids that that's biology at the cutting edge population.

01:16:02.603 --> 01:16:09.849
So it would seem a very straightforward study to say, do the people who have toxo get AD?

01:16:10.289 --> 01:16:10.669
Correct.

01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.990
There you go.

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:20.577
And there's certain areas like in France and Brazil where, what is it, 80, 90% of the population has an infection.

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:21.518
Do they have AD?

01:16:21.658 --> 01:16:27.342
Wait, so in Brazil and in France, like 80% of the people have Toxoplasma gondii?

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:27.923
I didn't know that.

01:16:29.758 --> 01:16:37.324
So then there should be a huge difference between the Alzheimer's in those populations and the populations that don't have it.

01:16:39.326 --> 01:16:40.968
You see how stupid this is?

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:50.596
That it passed a grant review committee, that it got funded, that it was a grant call that this was answered with and it got funded.

01:16:52.079 --> 01:17:01.882
And now these people are discussing it as a relevant set of questions and a relevant set of data to discuss so that we can better understand our own biology as humans.

01:17:07.163 --> 01:17:07.583
In France?

01:17:07.603 --> 01:17:08.824
Of course.

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:09.924
Yeah, they do.

01:17:10.124 --> 01:17:10.504
They do.

01:17:10.564 --> 01:17:11.965
They have over a million cases.

01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:18.347
I did some background reading on this just to see if there was a relationship.

01:17:18.987 --> 01:17:19.727
And it turns out

01:17:20.154 --> 01:17:26.539
Well, France's population is about 63 million, and they have 1.6 million cases of Alzheimer's.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.364
In the United States, it's 360 million, and we have 6 million cases of Alzheimer's.

01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:35.487
And it's on the rise in both places.

01:17:35.587 --> 01:17:39.510
In France, it could be that those million cases are the people that don't have toxo.

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.871
It could be.

01:17:40.891 --> 01:17:42.132
It could be.

01:17:42.172 --> 01:17:43.453
I don't know if they ever checked or not.

01:17:43.733 --> 01:17:46.395
Well, that's a pretty straightforward study, right?

01:17:47.765 --> 01:17:59.116
And Vincent's first instinct was to assume that the paper was right, and so then explain France and America's difference, but America's difference is not explained then, see?

01:17:59.656 --> 01:18:01.478
Well, then we can just use the French data.

01:18:02.239 --> 01:18:03.860
We don't have to use the American data.

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:06.483
Stop lying!

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:07.844
And I shouldn't even play that.

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:08.565
They're not lying.

01:18:09.721 --> 01:18:19.267
These people are lost in a maze of mirrors and they're bumping into things, but that's just normal because they do that all day long, bumping into mirrors and, oh yeah, that's right.

01:18:19.287 --> 01:18:20.248
Sorry, I'm wrong about that.

01:18:20.288 --> 01:18:21.248
You know that better than me.

01:18:21.288 --> 01:18:21.909
Let's go this way.

01:18:21.949 --> 01:18:23.089
Okay, here we go.

01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.992
And they started in the hall of mirrors of Alzheimer's disease.

01:18:27.472 --> 01:18:33.115
Now they're getting into the hall of mirrors of the causes of Alzheimer's.

01:18:33.676 --> 01:18:36.257
I think they've looked at, I don't think there's a correlation.

01:18:36.317 --> 01:18:37.098
I don't think there is.

01:18:37.657 --> 01:18:39.778
Yeah, I think in the discussion, they talk about that.

01:18:39.838 --> 01:18:40.018
Yeah.

01:18:40.258 --> 01:18:44.459
I mean, the other, and we'll get into is, does it matter when you get infected?

01:18:44.499 --> 01:18:45.239
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.560
Right.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:51.781
There are other agents they mentioned as well that also cause a reduction in amyloid.

01:18:52.081 --> 01:18:53.802
So Daniel, what is amyloid?

01:18:55.410 --> 01:18:57.071
Yeah, so what is amyloid?

01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:02.374
I got sidetracked here because amyloid builds up elsewhere too, doesn't it?

01:19:02.414 --> 01:19:06.116
It builds up in other parts of the body as well and causes different diseases.

01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:07.797
I got a little bit sidetracked.

01:19:09.198 --> 01:19:10.418
I mean, is it a protein?

01:19:10.478 --> 01:19:12.079
Is it a fat?

01:19:12.139 --> 01:19:14.601
Is it a polysaccharide?

01:19:14.641 --> 01:19:15.321
What the heck is it?

01:19:16.109 --> 01:19:17.170
So it's a protein.

01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:20.193
It's a protein that actually builds up.

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:24.979
And yeah, it can collect, as Christina points out, not just in the brain.

01:19:25.079 --> 01:19:28.402
It can actually collect in a lot of other places as well.

01:19:28.843 --> 01:19:33.648
Why is it called amyloid?

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:36.192
Oh, that's good.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:39.695
So what is the etymology of amylase?

01:19:39.715 --> 01:19:44.299
Oh, starch and cellulose-like.

01:19:44.459 --> 01:19:45.880
I think that's where that's from, isn't it?

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.480
Look at that.

01:19:46.881 --> 01:19:55.167
And so there's an enzyme called amylase, which digests starch and glycogen.

01:19:56.028 --> 01:19:56.508
And if

01:19:58.749 --> 01:20:01.370
People don't know what the chemical signature of this is.

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:03.731
They're wondering, how does that build up?

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:06.632
Why does this Rick Griffin guy look so sad right now?

01:20:06.672 --> 01:20:09.233
Did she just say something she wasn't supposed to say?

01:20:10.113 --> 01:20:16.295
I've never heard that amyloid was related to starch or to, yeah, that's interesting.

01:20:17.716 --> 01:20:18.376
Interesting.

01:20:18.896 --> 01:20:23.498
Up in your brain and how does it interfere with transmission of neurons and that sort of thing.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:27.499
So I'm glad I asked the question rather than I was asked

01:20:30.976 --> 01:20:38.282
So they're all happy not to be experts in this but they're also happy to take money and talk shit about this stuff, right?

01:20:38.842 --> 01:20:43.346
And laugh about how they don't know enough to know really talk about it, but they're talking about it anyway.

01:20:45.548 --> 01:20:48.130
They're taking they're asking for money to talk about it.

01:20:49.232 --> 01:20:52.794
actually mean starch-like, but it's protein, right?

01:20:52.854 --> 01:20:55.076
So we're starch-like, right?

01:20:55.156 --> 01:20:57.437
Carbohydrates, so it's a starch-like protein.

01:20:57.858 --> 01:20:58.058
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:58.098 --> 01:21:01.340
Is this a repeated protein, like a polyprotein?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:02.901
So it is interesting.

01:21:02.981 --> 01:21:12.747
Is there a connection here between amyloid and misfolded proteins of a Crutzfield-Jakob, which almost has this PCR replication?

01:21:12.967 --> 01:21:13.508
We don't think so.

01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:17.990
What are those, the replicator things from?

01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:18.790
Prions.

01:21:19.191 --> 01:21:20.071
Prions, so.

01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:30.075
Interesting, because I think Kevin McCarron and a lot of people like Stephanie Seneff often make a parallel comparison between amyloid, amyloidosis and prions and prion disease.

01:21:30.696 --> 01:21:33.337
And I think that's intentional.

01:21:34.295 --> 01:21:53.745
Because again, they're trying to blur the line so that our biology and the sacredness of it is lost in these details of molecular biology instead of a firm line being drawn where pattern integrities end and where molecular biology begins, where chemistry and physics begins and takes over.

01:21:55.094 --> 01:22:03.159
Because life is emergent properties beyond physics and chemistry that can't be accounted for by physics and chemistry alone.

01:22:03.239 --> 01:22:17.288
And yet we are still stuck in this idea that physics and chemistry alone do account for everything, the genes account for everything, that we can basically think of ourselves on a determinist track while evolution works in the background.

01:22:18.108 --> 01:22:20.910
And if we would pull our big boy pants on, we would take control of it.

01:22:24.744 --> 01:22:26.545
prions, depending on where you're from.

01:22:27.145 --> 01:22:33.729
I mean, Stanley Prusiner thinks these are all, in the end, misfolding diseases.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:35.911
Why not plug Stephen Prusiner, right?

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.732
The guy that went to the Vatican with Hilary Kaprowski.

01:22:38.773 --> 01:22:42.595
Why not plug him with these giant books about prions?

01:22:43.015 --> 01:22:52.601
And most of the stuff that they think about prions is based on experiments in yeast and anecdotal observations of people that eat other people.

01:22:58.203 --> 01:23:01.890
And they want you to believe that prion diseases only take one molecule.

01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:02.671
Right, Rixie?

01:23:03.372 --> 01:23:04.274
Right, Kevin McCarron?

01:23:04.294 --> 01:23:04.775
Just one.

01:23:04.795 --> 01:23:06.157
It only takes just one.

01:23:06.177 --> 01:23:10.505
It's really turning out to be a worst-case scenario, isn't it?

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.650
right?

01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:18.993
Because the amyloid is misfolding and the tau is misfolding to make these plaques and tangles.

01:23:19.073 --> 01:23:22.394
So they have a similar underlying mechanism.

01:23:23.455 --> 01:23:25.696
A similar underlying mechanism?

01:23:25.736 --> 01:23:28.918
Do you mean that amyloid misfolds other amyloid?

01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:30.559
Because that's what prions mean.

01:23:30.979 --> 01:23:40.864
And if you don't at least know that mythology well enough to make that parallel, you are really a pathetic biologist on faculty of a really pathetic university.

01:23:41.804 --> 01:23:43.546
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:23:44.146 --> 01:23:45.067
That is sad.

01:23:45.367 --> 01:23:47.789
I was also, yeah, I was also a protein as well.

01:23:47.829 --> 01:23:58.998
And so the same sort of theory there that if you can get rid of these abnormal, toxic, misfolded proteins, you can have some benefit here.

01:23:59.418 --> 01:24:01.359
So how are the proteins toxic?

01:24:01.379 --> 01:24:04.062
Are they folded in such a way that they induce

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:18.014
inflammation, they just throw around these ideas because they are enchantments that they think are provoking very limited ideas in your brain that will add up into a cognitive picture that makes you accept what they're saying.

01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:25.933
they're relying on the idea that most of the people that actually listen to them don't know what they're talking about.

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:37.758
So the interesting thing, we sort of get back to some of the things that we've talked about is, so does infection with T. gondii actually impact learning, memory, behavior?

01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:40.499
And so they point out that

01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:54.727
There's been some prior work where they've done T. gondii infection of this AD, so this Alzheimer dementia mouse model, so Alzheimer's disease mouse.

01:24:55.127 --> 01:25:02.411
And they've actually shown improvement in learning and memory deficits, and that this actually persists after infection.

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:05.553
Follow the mice out for almost a year, right?

01:25:05.593 --> 01:25:07.774
Which for a mouse, that's like an eternity.

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:08.715
Exactly.

01:25:09.295 --> 01:25:10.696
I kinda miss that, I wanna listen again.

01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:29.102
you can have some benefit here.

01:25:29.162 --> 01:25:41.325
And so the interesting thing, we sort of get back to some of the things that we've talked about is, so does infection with T. gondii actually impact learning, memory, behavior?

01:25:42.225 --> 01:25:54.168
And so they point out that they actually, there's been some prior work where they've done T. gondii infection of this ED, so this Alzheimer

01:25:55.208 --> 01:26:05.874
dementia mouse models, Elmer's disease mouse, and they've actually shown improvement in learning and memory deficits, and that this actually persists after infection.

01:26:06.514 --> 01:26:07.935
Follow the mice out for.

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:10.016
Wow, I would have to read that paper.

01:26:10.056 --> 01:26:11.697
That seems like extraordinary.

01:26:13.718 --> 01:26:14.899
So it's a mouse model.

01:26:16.513 --> 01:26:19.274
But keep in mind, right, this is what he's essentially arguing.

01:26:19.314 --> 01:26:20.794
I'm just going to switch over here really quick.

01:26:20.814 --> 01:26:29.696
What he's essentially arguing is that they have this AD mouse, and it has amyloid in its brain.

01:26:30.636 --> 01:26:45.599
And if they expose it to Toxoplasma gondii, then they have an increase in memory or behavior.

01:26:48.817 --> 01:26:49.658
behavior score.

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:53.543
Doesn't matter what they do and they have some increase in behavior score.

01:26:54.103 --> 01:27:05.437
So you have a mouse model that has a genetically predisposed bad brain with overexpression of what these guys assume is a toxic protein.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:10.171
And so it's already got bad stuff happening.

01:27:10.211 --> 01:27:13.874
And then when they give it this, they see a better behavior.

01:27:13.914 --> 01:27:20.259
And so now they want to look and see if this infection reduced the amount of amyloid in that mouse brain.

01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:26.804
And so they're not testing whether amyloid makes that mouse

01:27:29.517 --> 01:27:30.938
silly, so dumb.

01:27:31.038 --> 01:27:36.462
So my guess is, is that there's a lower behavioral score in this mouse relative to its wild-type counterpart.

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:38.263
But that's not also very surprising.

01:27:39.724 --> 01:27:55.275
What you might ask yourself, the question is, if you took another mouse and you expressed another protein in it, let's call it XY, and you expressed it in the same places under the same promoter as amyloid, would you get the same results in this mouse behavior?

01:27:56.776 --> 01:27:58.357
Would you have the same problems?

01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:04.170
Because my guess is, is that that question has not been asked.

01:28:05.331 --> 01:28:16.199
They have not transfected or permanently genetically engineered another mouse to express exactly in the same way that they are doing it in this mouse, but a different protein.

01:28:16.719 --> 01:28:23.124
A slightly less, a slightly less toxic protein with very similar structural motifs, perhaps.

01:28:23.944 --> 01:28:27.547
Maybe a protein with all the same amino acids in a different order.

01:28:30.984 --> 01:28:32.284
They haven't done that control.

01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:37.086
The control is this mouse versus a wild type control.

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:40.847
A wild type control doesn't have the alteration in it, right?

01:28:41.588 --> 01:28:46.029
And so just like a lot of other experiments, the control isn't the right one.

01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:49.830
The control isn't the right one.

01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.391
Why?

01:28:50.411 --> 01:28:57.273
The control isn't the right one because these people work in the amyloid camp and the amyloid camp gets the free pass.

01:28:59.557 --> 01:29:10.740
to assume that the amyloid is accumulation of a toxin and so you can use any mouse model you want that produces that accumulation of that said toxin.

01:29:12.081 --> 01:29:19.623
You get to have this assumption for free because you work in the amyloid camp and you wrote a grant to the amyloid grant call.

01:29:20.728 --> 01:29:22.990
That's why they don't have to do this experiment.

01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:29.317
That's why this experiment is dumb, because they've already working under the assumption that the amyloid is responsible.

01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:38.166
And so rather than them teaching you this as they do this little thing, they're not teaching you at all.

01:29:38.927 --> 01:29:41.350
They're just teaching you to accept

01:29:42.432 --> 01:29:56.399
They're teaching you to accept the presuppositions of this whole model of Alzheimer's and that there are a limited list of possible causes and that it's sufficient for us to just think about these three causes and how they're related to each other.

01:29:58.402 --> 01:30:02.524
They are no more sophisticated than the experts that they learned this from.

01:30:02.584 --> 01:30:12.470
And the experts that they learned it from are in the amyloid camp, the tau camp, or the inflammatory camp and work under one of those three assumptions as a basis for their work.

01:30:19.295 --> 01:30:20.095
Just a year, right?

01:30:20.115 --> 01:30:22.336
Which for a mouse, that's like an eternity.

01:30:22.956 --> 01:30:23.296
Exactly.

01:30:24.356 --> 01:30:29.777
Right, what is it my cousin says, like if two people date in college, it's like you multiply it by seven, it's like dark.

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:32.897
I'm sorry, but the NIH takes these people very seriously.

01:30:32.957 --> 01:30:35.178
Columbia University takes these people seriously.

01:30:35.218 --> 01:30:38.058
The university somewhere in Scotland takes these people seriously.

01:30:38.498 --> 01:30:41.019
A university in Texas takes this guy seriously.

01:30:41.039 --> 01:30:44.140
A hospital in New York City takes this guy seriously.

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:46.480
We have to take these people seriously.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.402
and we have to confront them as non-serious.

01:30:51.583 --> 01:30:55.826
We have to rescue people from these people.

01:30:55.887 --> 01:30:59.329
We have to rescue the people that take these people seriously.

01:30:59.369 --> 01:31:12.739
And that goes all the way to the top of the NIH, the NIAID, all of these people in these bureaucracies take these people seriously, just like they take seriously anyone that has a tenure track position.

01:31:13.906 --> 01:31:19.090
Anyone that has a faculty position is taken seriously by other people with faculty positions.

01:31:20.732 --> 01:31:31.600
And they are very careful and very gentlemanly and very parliamentary procedure about how they interact with each other so that they don't step on the toes of somebody who's not in the camp that they're in.

01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:37.345
Even if they're in the same field of Alzheimer's disease or neurodegenerative disorders.

01:31:40.034 --> 01:31:45.243
And this creates an illusion of a whole sea of knowledge that has to be taken seriously.

01:31:45.684 --> 01:31:51.474
And this little exercise is watching four people practice taking it seriously.

01:31:52.416 --> 01:31:52.716
Yes.

01:31:53.953 --> 01:31:55.614
This is exactly what we have to do.

01:31:57.675 --> 01:31:59.676
Mouse, they need to have, what are mouse years, right?

01:31:59.696 --> 01:32:02.318
It's going to be like two years on your toes, right?

01:32:02.378 --> 01:32:04.219
I mean, mice live, what, three years?

01:32:04.599 --> 01:32:06.320
Max, that's max, right?

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.042
So that's like each mouse year is like 30 of our years.

01:32:09.182 --> 01:32:19.408
But interestingly enough, if the mice are kept on a minimal caloric diet, they live longer than their litter mates that are allowed to eat anytime they want.

01:32:20.478 --> 01:32:23.160
That's a general thing for all animals.

01:32:23.381 --> 01:32:24.301
Ooh, big deal.

01:32:24.362 --> 01:32:25.543
Why bring that up now?

01:32:25.623 --> 01:32:26.644
What in the world?

01:32:26.804 --> 01:32:27.645
Dixon is funny.

01:32:28.445 --> 01:32:29.967
Dixon is one funny old man.

01:32:30.247 --> 01:32:34.030
But I like him because he's still one of the only guys who will say this is stupid.

01:32:35.271 --> 01:32:45.941
So being normal weight, not just overweight, but just normal weight, appears to be a pathological condition, which eventually ends up shortening your lifespan.

01:32:47.165 --> 01:32:54.068
That's a bizarre finding because there are a lot of people out there that believe that so much that they look like they're walking skeletons.

01:32:55.408 --> 01:33:00.690
I mean, that's another one of those that might be true in mice, but we haven't necessarily seen that in people.

01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:02.731
So yeah, so another question.

01:33:02.751 --> 01:33:06.932
Oh, they're happy to bring that up whenever it's convenient for them, but not as a general rule.

01:33:09.586 --> 01:33:12.508
I don't even know how you'd try it, how you'd test it in people.

01:33:12.548 --> 01:33:14.629
You can't infect people with Toxo, right?

01:33:14.649 --> 01:33:15.469
Yes, you can.

01:33:15.689 --> 01:33:16.250
Oh, yes, you can.

01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:17.310
Well, yes, so this is different.

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:24.494
There's a group in Japan, right, which, you know, sort of almost like a cultish type group that believe this is how they're going to live forever.

01:33:24.734 --> 01:33:28.817
And they incredibly limited caloric intake.

01:33:28.857 --> 01:33:29.677
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:29.817 --> 01:33:30.478
And we'll see.

01:33:30.498 --> 01:33:34.200
So, Dixon, you can infect people with Toxo?

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.941
Under extraordinary conditions, you can.

01:33:38.908 --> 01:33:52.755
If they're in a state of ill health where no matter what you do, in the known medicine world, they're going to die, then they often approve protocols for extraordinary experiments like this one.

01:33:52.995 --> 01:33:56.917
So, Dixon, if you get toxo as an adult, what are the consequences?

01:33:57.497 --> 01:34:01.339
Well, you don't get the learning deficit.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.002
As far as I know, there are no permanent effects unless it

01:34:08.481 --> 01:34:21.747
activates as an adult, and that came out during the initial AIDS outbreaks, and that diminished your immune response against everything, including Toxoplasma.

01:34:23.147 --> 01:34:27.189
A lot of AIDS patients died of encephalitis to Toxo.

01:34:27.349 --> 01:34:34.732
But if you have a healthy person who does not have Toxo, and then they get infected at age 50, will it become a chronic infection?

01:34:35.498 --> 01:34:42.459
Oh yeah, well, you know, it depends on how you define infection, because it gets into this Bradyzoite stage.

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.961
And the Brady's whites are not dividing.

01:34:45.841 --> 01:34:50.082
So should we go back and do this, like, let's do basic toxoplasmosis?

01:34:50.262 --> 01:34:51.622
We should probably do.

01:34:51.662 --> 01:34:53.463
We did that once already, but we can do that again.

01:34:53.863 --> 01:34:54.603
Yeah, so let's start off.

01:34:54.683 --> 01:34:57.824
How do you get toxoplasmosis?

01:34:57.944 --> 01:34:59.324
Do you have to own a cat?

01:34:59.745 --> 01:35:00.765
Well, there are two ways.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:05.226
One is that you eat the cat, and the other one is you take very good care of the cat.

01:35:05.246 --> 01:35:09.847
No, I think the primary way, the reason why the French

01:35:13.191 --> 01:35:30.796
have such a high rate of infection, their prevalence and incidence rates are very, very high, is that they have a set of cultural dishes and cuisines that if you don't eat them by the time you're two years old, you're not considered French.

01:35:31.416 --> 01:35:33.016
And one of them is steak tartare.

01:35:33.777 --> 01:35:37.598
And steak tartare is free of toxoplasma, by the way.

01:35:37.658 --> 01:35:40.278
Steak, as long as it's steak, it's OK.

01:35:40.298 --> 01:35:41.359
But they don't use steak.

01:35:41.399 --> 01:35:42.579
They use lamb.

01:35:43.513 --> 01:35:44.574
And they use mutton.

01:35:45.314 --> 01:35:47.635
And those animals are not free of toxo.

01:35:48.416 --> 01:35:51.918
And so a lot of toxo is transmitted by the ingestion of raw meat.

01:35:53.199 --> 01:36:00.423
In nature, this is, by the way, the most widely distributed protozoan infection in the world.

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:06.407
The next most prominent is the one we had last time for a case history for Trichomonas vaginalis.

01:36:06.947 --> 01:36:08.748
And then I guess malaria is third.

01:36:08.808 --> 01:36:11.850
But this is probably the world's greatest

01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:15.401
successful protozoan parasite.

01:36:15.421 --> 01:36:31.632
Because Vincent, if you acquire this as an adult, and you have an intact immune system, you'll probably have six weeks of mild symptoms, a few swollen lymph nodes maybe, some fever, as the organism distributes itself throughout the body.

01:36:32.473 --> 01:36:36.075
Thank you, macrophages, for picking me up and dropping me somewhere else.

01:36:36.636 --> 01:36:39.518
It's like the taxi cab for Toxoplasma.

01:36:40.137 --> 01:36:41.638
But we should say ingestion, right?

01:36:41.658 --> 01:36:43.959
It tends to be an oral ingestion.

01:36:44.379 --> 01:36:46.280
Oral ingestion is the only way you're going to catch this.

01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.241
It's not a sexually transmitted disease at all.

01:36:49.222 --> 01:36:59.067
So you get the infection by ingesting the bradyzoite stage, which is a dormant stage in muscle tissue, usually.

01:36:59.627 --> 01:37:05.690
But of course, if you eat brain or if you eat other organs as well, you have an option for getting it that way as well.

01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:08.652
But it's mostly through the ingestion of muscle tissue.

01:37:09.713 --> 01:37:14.236
So then the organisms are activated by passage through the stomach.

01:37:14.877 --> 01:37:23.283
And as they enter the small intestine, they receive environmental cues to sort of wake up, because now you're in the right place to start the next phase of your infection.

01:37:24.364 --> 01:37:26.566
The bradyzoites change into tachyzoites.

01:37:27.566 --> 01:37:35.192
Tachyzoites are the stage that we're used to looking at, these sort of banana-shaped, crescent-shaped organisms.

01:37:36.133 --> 01:37:39.015
And they can penetrate cells.

01:37:39.827 --> 01:37:58.958
and they penetrate the cells in the small intestine, and they set up an infection in the lamina propria, and it's loaded with all kinds of phagocytic cells, and some of them, like neutrophils, I believe, can actually destroy toxoplasma tachyzoites, but macrophages don't.

01:37:59.818 --> 01:38:07.903
And in fact, John Boothroyd, a friend of mine who worked at Stanford on this, has investigated why that happens.

01:38:08.817 --> 01:38:17.124
And it's because of the way it enters the cell and the kind of membrane it induces around itself to prevent the fusion of lysosomes.

01:38:17.904 --> 01:38:20.906
And as a result, the organisms are not destroyed.

01:38:22.348 --> 01:38:32.596
And that's one of its key survival tactics, is to avoid death by phagocytosis so that you can be distributed throughout the body.

01:38:32.996 --> 01:38:36.879
The other remarkable feature about Toxoplasma is that there are no limits

01:38:37.435 --> 01:38:39.236
to the kind of cell it can infect.

01:38:40.436 --> 01:38:53.702
Now, this week in virology, of course, we talk about all of the receptors for various tissues or for various cell types and how specific some viruses are, at least for those cell types.

01:38:54.522 --> 01:39:01.785
Toxoplasma has no bounds with regards to entering and leaving the cells as well.

01:39:02.245 --> 01:39:04.946
In cell culture, you can watch this happen all over the place.

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:06.427
The cells are still alive.

01:39:06.997 --> 01:39:16.400
So it can punch a hole in the cell membrane and then going through the hole that it just creates, seals up, allows the tachyzoite to go inside.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:20.941
And if you leave it in culture long enough, of course it will replicate.

01:39:22.362 --> 01:39:24.622
And you can use any kind of cell that you want.

01:39:24.662 --> 01:39:27.803
You're free to study this in any cell culture.

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:30.784
And fibroblasts are good to start with.

01:39:31.324 --> 01:39:33.085
Fibroblasts come from foreskin.

01:39:35.447 --> 01:39:50.644
Okay, so in your body this is happening all over the place and you can imagine what effects this might have because as the organism... It's interesting that he had a very detailed mechanism for the distribution of one part of the life cycle in the body, but not a very good explanation for how they replicate.

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:52.727
Just if you wait long enough, they start to replicate.

01:39:54.011 --> 01:39:56.072
I'm not saying it's not real.

01:39:57.153 --> 01:39:58.414
It's not a virus.

01:39:58.474 --> 01:40:02.417
So I'm open to the idea that it's definitely real and that they understand a lot about it.

01:40:02.477 --> 01:40:08.040
But it's funny how certain they are about viruses and how viruses work and how specific they are.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.901
And we talk about that on another program.

01:40:10.402 --> 01:40:22.910
But this is actually supported by an awful lot of tractable evidence, which is very different than virology, even though, again, here he is making it seem as though they're equivalent levels of fidelity and understanding.

01:40:23.619 --> 01:40:28.283
replicate inside of a cell, just like with malaria, and they're related to each other.

01:40:28.323 --> 01:40:29.504
They're both epicomplexa.

01:40:30.445 --> 01:40:33.247
Out come the tachyzoites to look for another cell.

01:40:34.068 --> 01:40:37.251
And in doing that, it destroys the cells that they were in.

01:40:37.951 --> 01:40:39.352
And that could go on for some time.

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:52.283
That could maybe, if your immune system is active, and your IL-12 is active, and you've got lots of ILs there that are not ill, but rather helping the cells around them survive,

01:40:52.847 --> 01:41:07.778
Then eventually, eventually, with the help of interferon and several other immune-inducible responses, including immunoglobulins, the tachyzoites are brought under control.

01:41:08.739 --> 01:41:12.262
And when that happens, in most cells, they die.

01:41:14.464 --> 01:41:15.705
But in the brain.

01:41:16.045 --> 01:41:17.386
In most cells, they die?

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:18.146
Why do they die?

01:41:19.367 --> 01:41:20.488
Such a weird story.

01:41:21.289 --> 01:41:22.610
And in selected other tissues.

01:41:23.328 --> 01:41:29.373
in the eye, for instance, also, the choroid plexus, the organisms can live for a long time.

01:41:29.933 --> 01:41:35.098
They inhibit immune responses against them by a very simple technology.

01:41:35.138 --> 01:41:36.199
They just stop dividing.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:43.164
They said, I'm not going to let you see me because my metabolism will go to almost zero.

01:41:45.026 --> 01:41:51.211
And those organisms transformed from tachyzoids into bradyzoids.

01:41:51.957 --> 01:41:55.498
which is a rounded-up form of the banana-shaped tachyzoites.

01:41:55.998 --> 01:42:07.241
But the moment you eat the bradyzoites in the form of a cyst, they reactivate and become tachyzoites again.

01:42:07.261 --> 01:42:14.163
So the other thing about this organism is that it's very specific for its hosts with regards to reproduction.

01:42:15.163 --> 01:42:15.263
It's

01:42:15.854 --> 01:42:18.155
It's got a male and female equivalent.

01:42:18.855 --> 01:42:21.977
But he just said that it doesn't really matter what cell they replicate in.

01:42:21.997 --> 01:42:25.238
You can do it in any cell culture, but now they're very specific, what?

01:42:27.979 --> 01:42:35.882
And the only group of animals that it can reproduce in are the felidae, so cats of all kinds.

01:42:36.543 --> 01:42:40.244
In fact, all- Do they cell culture it in cat cells then or what?

01:42:40.904 --> 01:42:42.245
What is going on here?

01:42:43.482 --> 01:42:46.484
Clearly he's not an expert, he just knows what he's been told.

01:42:47.004 --> 01:43:06.798
Cats are susceptible to both the tachyzoite stage that it eats from an animal that it just killed, to the sexual reproduction stages, which never leave the animal and go in and disperse throughout the tissues.

01:43:07.218 --> 01:43:10.741
What that stage does is it fuses

01:43:11.601 --> 01:43:33.009
going from a haploid to a diploid stage protozoan, and then they produce two internal spores, and the Oocyst, which it's called the Oocyst, and that name was also used for the sexual stages of Plasmodium as well.

01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:37.611
That stage is then excreted into the environment.

01:43:38.691 --> 01:43:40.472
So another way to catch this infection

01:43:41.204 --> 01:43:46.027
is by accidentally eating some cat feces contaminated with the oocysts.

01:43:47.208 --> 01:43:56.394
And they almost instantly upon hitting air, mature into the infectious form that's... So I don't understand.

01:43:56.434 --> 01:43:59.175
They can replicate in your body, but you don't poop them out.

01:43:59.236 --> 01:44:00.917
I guess that's the point, right?

01:44:00.997 --> 01:44:02.558
I mean, this is so bad.

01:44:03.238 --> 01:44:04.279
This is so bad.

01:44:04.319 --> 01:44:07.841
It doesn't even make any sense, even though he thinks he's telling a coherent story.

01:44:08.101 --> 01:44:09.362
And viable for some time.

01:44:10.462 --> 01:44:12.504
Of course, if it dries out, it dies, and that's the end.

01:44:12.964 --> 01:44:17.748
But carnivorism and scavenging is the way this organism finds its way around the world.

01:44:18.628 --> 01:44:22.471
And I think that's enough for the biology.

01:44:22.511 --> 01:44:23.772
The biology is very complicated.

01:44:24.213 --> 01:44:39.144
Once it gets inside of a cell, it's very virus-like in terms of its ability to interfere with normal host processes and even interacts with host genomics in a way that is reminiscent of the way trichinella

01:44:39.861 --> 01:44:59.651
interfaces with its host genomics to cause the host to produce proteins that it never would have produced otherwise, at least under those circumstances, and enables the parasite to live a long and non-reproductive life until the next host comes along.

01:44:59.671 --> 01:45:04.354
And all you have to do is die in order to transmit this to another animal.

01:45:05.274 --> 01:45:08.296
And that's the real crux of the whole situation.

01:45:09.373 --> 01:45:25.338
Most infections don't depend on death of host in order to transmit itself from one place to the other, but toxoplasma is famous for its ability to survive as these bradyzoites in tissue.

01:45:25.959 --> 01:45:29.382
It's amazing how many human beings are infected.

01:45:29.622 --> 01:45:32.964
We're really kind of a bystander to this sort of... Yeah, that's right.

01:45:33.004 --> 01:45:34.105
We're a dead end.

01:45:34.765 --> 01:45:35.166
That's right.

01:45:35.186 --> 01:45:37.828
Except we're not a dead end necessarily.

01:45:37.848 --> 01:45:40.730
I guess we're eaten by a lion, right?

01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:41.530
Well, no, no.

01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:54.880
There are cultures on the Himalayan mountains, mostly Buddhist cultures, which actually dismember a person who has died and put them on these platforms.

01:45:55.632 --> 01:46:01.936
for the vultures to come and feed on the carcass, to recycle the body back into nature.

01:46:02.877 --> 01:46:05.599
And other animals will scavenge on those parts as well.

01:46:05.639 --> 01:46:10.262
And when they do, of course, they have the option of acquiring toxoplasma as well.

01:46:11.843 --> 01:46:14.345
You can also catch it from the mother.

01:46:15.306 --> 01:46:18.168
So there's a congenital toxoplasmosis as well.

01:46:19.148 --> 01:46:21.690
And so that's a third way of catching this.

01:46:23.487 --> 01:46:25.690
It's the one that causes the most damage in people.

01:46:26.691 --> 01:46:28.773
An adult can usually fight off this thing.

01:46:29.233 --> 01:46:33.678
If you're suffering from AIDS, then the answer is you can't.

01:46:34.299 --> 01:46:38.644
But if you're an immunocompetent person.

01:46:39.545 --> 01:46:42.188
So I'm going to see if I can speed this up.

01:46:42.228 --> 01:46:44.671
What I'm going to do is I'm going to try and go here.

01:46:46.158 --> 01:46:49.220
which is the original video on YouTube.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.302
And I'm going to go down here and try to see if I can find the show notes.

01:46:52.742 --> 01:46:53.463
That's this one.

01:46:55.304 --> 01:46:58.266
And then I'm going to look at the paper that they looked at.

01:46:59.166 --> 01:47:01.748
Because that's, of course, what we're talking about here.

01:47:01.788 --> 01:47:03.109
Let me move my big head.

01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:07.472
And reduces amyloid in the brain is this one.

01:47:07.492 --> 01:47:12.055
And can I get that one?

01:47:23.975 --> 01:47:25.195
Um, there they are.

01:47:25.435 --> 01:47:33.857
5xFAD is the name of the mouse that they used, and so I'm gonna go back to PubMed, where is it?

01:47:34.837 --> 01:47:39.478
And, uh, 5xFAD.

01:47:40.319 --> 01:47:40.639
Mice.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:51.321
So, mast cells, blah blah blah blah blah.

01:47:52.461 --> 01:48:01.546
seizures, exacerbate, excitatory, inhibitory, imbalance, and Alzheimer's disease, and patch clamp recordings.

01:48:01.566 --> 01:48:02.707
That's kind of a cool paper.

01:48:08.951 --> 01:48:10.272
And this is a cool paper.

01:48:10.392 --> 01:48:12.413
Okay, these are the two that I found before.

01:48:13.547 --> 01:48:20.969
Background, alterations in gastrointestinal function and gut brain axis are associated with progression and pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

01:48:21.009 --> 01:48:34.353
Studies in Alzheimer's disease animal models show that changes in the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers can contribute to, I hate saying it, Alzheimer's disease development in the central nervous system.

01:48:34.393 --> 01:48:36.354
Again, animal models.

01:48:36.554 --> 01:48:38.094
And so what are the animal models?

01:48:38.194 --> 01:48:39.115
Six month old,

01:48:41.616 --> 01:48:47.958
5xFAID, their transgenic Alzheimer's disease, and wild type, male and female mice.

01:48:48.798 --> 01:49:01.142
GI function was assessed and expression of amyloid in the brain and in the colonic myenteric plexus, so I guess that would be

01:49:02.872 --> 01:49:07.458
a little patch of nerves in the gut or else a little patch of nerves somewhere in the deep brain.

01:49:07.498 --> 01:49:07.798
I don't know.

01:49:07.818 --> 01:49:08.679
I haven't looked it up yet.

01:49:08.779 --> 01:49:18.189
But the point is, is that in this one, they say they're not a robust model of Alzheimer's to study amyloidosis in the gut because these guys don't mimic that.

01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:19.110
Thank you very much.

01:49:19.731 --> 01:49:21.233
They don't mimic that effect.

01:49:22.711 --> 01:49:29.359
And so this transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease only has the transgenic alteration in the brain.

01:49:29.399 --> 01:49:31.963
It only has amyloid in the brain.

01:49:32.023 --> 01:49:38.751
So it's not really a model of amyloid generating Alzheimer's disease.

01:49:38.831 --> 01:49:39.732
It's a model of

01:49:40.848 --> 01:49:51.772
of transgenic alteration of amyloid expression, altering the behavior of an animal, and them equating that to a model of Alzheimer's disease.

01:49:52.633 --> 01:50:03.497
And depending on how bad that assumption, that jump is, that leap is, we could really be studying nothing, and maybe even two orders of magnitude removed from something.

01:50:05.126 --> 01:50:07.127
Inbred mouse.

01:50:07.328 --> 01:50:11.030
Transgenic expression of a protein that shouldn't be there.

01:50:12.591 --> 01:50:17.354
And then the assumption that that protein is central to a human disease.

01:50:18.355 --> 01:50:25.860
There's like three bad assumptions here all in one whole list of literature.

01:50:26.929 --> 01:50:28.430
Remember what I just did here.

01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:35.634
I did a whole search on these mice and got a whole list of papers that goes to 1,541 papers where they talk about this mouse model.

01:50:35.654 --> 01:50:43.198
1,500 papers that taught at least 1,000 grad students, at least 1,000 postdocs, and spent at least a million euros each.

01:50:56.718 --> 01:51:02.102
Because not any of these labs are doing one paper using these models.

01:51:02.242 --> 01:51:04.083
That's not how you get grant funding.

01:51:09.267 --> 01:51:17.792
I wonder if we can find something that would help us understand exactly what happens in these mice.

01:51:17.892 --> 01:51:21.515
I don't know, but I'm going to go back to this.

01:51:26.567 --> 01:51:27.167
than you can.

01:51:27.228 --> 01:51:34.893
But a fetus, especially in its first and second trimesters, has got no immune system, basically.

01:51:35.454 --> 01:51:37.115
So the parasite can take advantage of it.

01:51:37.595 --> 01:51:42.479
And eventually, the parasite ends up in brain tissue, as well as other tissues.

01:51:42.539 --> 01:51:46.822
And the one most affected, of course, is the development of the brain and the fetus.

01:51:47.082 --> 01:51:52.266
And some horrible cases of congenital toxoplasma

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.441
Okay, we're going to forget that again.

01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:54.901
I'm sorry.

01:51:55.621 --> 01:51:57.382
I forgot what I was doing here.

01:51:57.462 --> 01:51:57.842
Now I know.

01:51:57.882 --> 01:51:59.323
I remember now that the coffee's in me.

01:52:00.203 --> 01:52:02.084
We were getting this paper out, right?

01:52:02.164 --> 01:52:03.085
Oops, wrong screen.

01:52:03.145 --> 01:52:04.365
We were getting this paper out.

01:52:04.405 --> 01:52:05.366
Where did the paper go?

01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:06.526
Where's the paper?

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.147
Where's the paper?

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:07.807
Here's the paper.

01:52:08.587 --> 01:52:11.289
They looked at a brain region specific manner.

01:52:11.369 --> 01:52:13.169
They have some, oh, here's the data.

01:52:15.931 --> 01:52:20.893
So if they infect, yeah, we can just blow this up because this is the whole point, right?

01:52:22.418 --> 01:52:26.180
They are going to look anatomically at two different places.

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.962
These are sagittal slices of the brain, so they're slicing sideways like this.

01:52:30.002 --> 01:52:34.004
This one might be a little more lateral than this one that's in the middle.

01:52:34.044 --> 01:52:35.645
This is probably a lateral slice.

01:52:35.685 --> 01:52:37.766
This is more of a midline slice.

01:52:39.507 --> 01:52:44.430
And you see down here, I believe, amyloid density is expressed in this yellow color here.

01:52:44.490 --> 01:52:46.451
So purple is low, yellow is high.

01:52:47.605 --> 01:52:48.746
Hopefully you can see my arrow.

01:52:49.947 --> 01:52:52.889
And so this is high amyloid expression here at the base of the brain.

01:52:53.970 --> 01:52:58.793
Maybe this is the, I don't know, is that the nucleus accumbens there, something like that.

01:52:59.634 --> 01:53:02.736
And then in the frontal cortex, you can see a lot of it there.

01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:04.257
You can also see some of it back here.

01:53:04.318 --> 01:53:08.341
This might be cerebellum, and this might be entorhinal cortex back here.

01:53:08.361 --> 01:53:15.146
This could also be entorhinal cortex right here along the edge of these lateral slices, sorry, sagittal slices.

01:53:16.952 --> 01:53:18.033
Are these sagittal slices?

01:53:18.574 --> 01:53:19.234
Yeah, I think they are.

01:53:20.996 --> 01:53:25.120
I've been so long since I've talked with Menno, I don't remember all the planes of the anatomy anymore.

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:25.780
I apologize.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:27.141
But I think this is a sagittal slice.

01:53:27.702 --> 01:53:29.243
It would be coronal.

01:53:29.564 --> 01:53:31.425
No, coronal is like this.

01:53:33.467 --> 01:53:35.969
And sagittal should be like this.

01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:38.311
And horizontal should be like that.

01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:39.212
I think that's right.

01:53:39.833 --> 01:53:41.134
And if I'm wrong, I apologize.

01:53:41.798 --> 01:53:54.394
But I'm definitely not wrong about the fact that they're looking at injection of phosphate buffered saline versus injection of the toxin.

01:53:54.514 --> 01:53:56.717
And so the question is, how do they do it?

01:53:56.757 --> 01:53:59.080
Let's look at the methods.

01:54:02.691 --> 01:54:15.444
were bred, all mice were infected at three months of age with 200 green fluorescent protein expressing tachyzoids, injected intraperitoneally.

01:54:18.307 --> 01:54:25.015
So if we believe the biology that the old man was telling us, the tachyzoids are the

01:54:27.506 --> 01:54:28.687
Those are the live ones, right?

01:54:28.747 --> 01:54:30.269
Those are the infectious ones.

01:54:30.329 --> 01:54:42.279
And they do 200 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 green fluorescent protein-expressing PA7 tachyzoids.

01:54:43.801 --> 01:54:45.062
Intraperitoneally.

01:54:49.165 --> 01:54:51.846
And intraperitoneally, just to make sure.

01:54:51.866 --> 01:54:55.347
I think I know what it means.

01:54:56.128 --> 01:55:00.069
But if I say it out loud and then I look like a fool, I don't want that.

01:55:00.129 --> 01:55:01.250
So I think I know what it means.

01:55:06.632 --> 01:55:07.392
I can't even spell it.

01:55:10.553 --> 01:55:12.314
Interperitoneal.

01:55:13.752 --> 01:55:15.633
Cavity of the abdominal organs.

01:55:15.693 --> 01:55:16.354
That's correct.

01:55:16.454 --> 01:55:19.055
So that's interesting, right?

01:55:19.095 --> 01:55:21.157
Because they're not going to inject it in the brain.

01:55:21.197 --> 01:55:23.638
They're injecting it intraperitoneally.

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:27.200
Hmm.

01:55:28.061 --> 01:55:29.782
Also where they don't put vaccines.

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:32.603
They don't put vaccines intraperitoneally.

01:55:32.643 --> 01:55:33.484
That's interesting, huh?

01:55:36.678 --> 01:55:44.847
Females were used in all experiments, as females have been reported to have a more aggressive timeline for the development of AD pathology.

01:55:45.067 --> 01:55:45.848
One citation.

01:55:46.869 --> 01:55:52.995
Parasites were serially passaged in human foreskin fibroblasts, as previously described.

01:55:53.116 --> 01:55:55.058
Isn't that such a great use?

01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:12.256
Isn't that such a great use for medical remnants that are taken from infant boys under the pretense of keeping their penis clean during infanthood, making it easier for them to maintain the hygiene of their genitals?

01:56:14.198 --> 01:56:15.539
What an awesome use.

01:56:20.663 --> 01:56:32.753
And so this is the optical clearing, and then they use DISCO, and then they show you that basically they can see that there's some plaques and whatever the infection took.

01:56:33.013 --> 01:56:36.796
See, they look at infection, and they see, and they don't see.

01:56:36.916 --> 01:56:38.137
I don't know what they're showing here.

01:56:38.318 --> 01:56:39.378
A, what is A showing?

01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:41.480
Amyloid burden is reduced.

01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:44.022
Three-month-olds were injected.

01:56:44.723 --> 01:56:48.406
Representative Z-planes showing amyloid signal from PBS injected.

01:56:52.734 --> 01:56:56.257
So this is apparently showing the amyloid and it's lower.

01:56:57.638 --> 01:56:58.559
It's not that impressive.

01:56:58.579 --> 01:56:59.600
This is more impressive.

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:12.911
B is amyloid density was quantified at each mouse and density maps were computed or analyzed or aligned across that atlas and then mean density of amyloid in the lateral medial sagittal.

01:57:12.951 --> 01:57:13.612
Yeah, it was sagittal.

01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:19.994
amyloid density, the number of plaques per voxel, and then they have some p-value here.

01:57:20.435 --> 01:57:21.195
So p-value.

01:57:21.276 --> 01:57:21.936
Pervuvian.

01:57:22.637 --> 01:57:26.120
P-value says that there's a difference between this group and that group.

01:57:27.141 --> 01:57:28.222
And so we have an effect.

01:57:28.242 --> 01:57:28.983
You see how it works?

01:57:29.043 --> 01:57:29.403
That's it.

01:57:29.443 --> 01:57:29.844
It's done.

01:57:30.204 --> 01:57:34.989
There's a difference between this group and that group, even if you just, maybe you should throw that one away.

01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.929
Well, let's not.

01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:39.433
Let's not throw that one away because then there might not be a significant difference.

01:57:40.674 --> 01:57:43.395
There might not be a significant difference if you just threw that one away.

01:57:44.075 --> 01:57:47.735
But it doesn't matter, because that's not how p-values work, ladies and gentlemen.

01:57:48.376 --> 01:57:51.896
That's not how knowledge is created on the academic bench.

01:57:55.097 --> 01:57:58.658
Shall we give them a chance to actually finish their discussion of this paper?

01:57:58.718 --> 01:58:00.918
Because they haven't really started even discussing it yet.

01:58:01.138 --> 01:58:01.418
I don't know.

01:58:01.458 --> 01:58:02.038
Maybe we should.

01:58:08.019 --> 01:58:10.040
Are available online for you to

01:58:11.513 --> 01:58:22.064
become absolutely repulsed by the damage that a very small organism can cause to a very innocent bystander, basically, that had nothing to do with this at all.

01:58:22.084 --> 01:58:29.012
The mother ate a piece of raw meat or had a pet cat that, you know, she was not taking

01:58:30.347 --> 01:58:32.610
as good a care of as she should have probably.

01:58:32.630 --> 01:58:34.992
So Daniel, tell us, tell us what they did in this paper.

01:58:36.934 --> 01:58:39.377
Let's go into reality here.

01:58:39.757 --> 01:58:41.639
No, no, this, I mean, this is reality.

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:42.580
Well, that's true.

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:43.041
That's true.

01:58:43.361 --> 01:58:43.641
Yeah.

01:58:43.681 --> 01:58:45.744
Clinically and people it's world.

01:58:47.205 --> 01:58:48.907
This is reality.

01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:52.451
This is reality.

01:58:54.793 --> 01:59:05.921
you know, unless it's from mom, um, usually presents a model like illness, but yeah, then you end up with these, uh, intracellular creatures in the brain and in most cases.

01:59:05.981 --> 01:59:08.602
And, and so that's, that's where we're going to go.

01:59:08.622 --> 01:59:10.043
So let's get back to our paper.

01:59:10.063 --> 01:59:13.446
Uh, we've gotten much of the, uh,

01:59:15.553 --> 01:59:30.821
I think the other thing we should probably mention in the paper, we're still in the intro here, is that the impact of the T. gondii infection in mice is different, whether you're dealing with your lab BALB-C, right?

01:59:31.401 --> 01:59:40.666
You're familiar with the little white BALB-C mice versus the wild type, or even the black 57 mice.

01:59:40.966 --> 01:59:43.147
So actually, it depends which mice you're

01:59:43.627 --> 01:59:52.994
Oh, so Toxoplasma gondii infects different inbred mouse strains differently, but we can learn a lot of human biology from infecting mice with it.

01:59:53.274 --> 01:59:54.515
Holy shit.

01:59:54.555 --> 01:59:59.958
Stop lying!

02:00:00.679 --> 02:00:03.000
That is spectacularly dumb.

02:00:03.681 --> 02:00:08.684
Infecting, as far as the impacts that you're potentially going to have.

02:00:09.084 --> 02:00:09.725
So let me see.

02:00:09.865 --> 02:00:11.006
Let me read the paper again.

02:00:11.026 --> 02:00:12.647
The mouse model is weird, right?

02:00:14.398 --> 02:00:26.263
It is because there's actually this, yeah, this special Alzheimer's disease mouse, right, which again changes things because you're doing the infection in a... It doesn't change things.

02:00:26.543 --> 02:00:37.087
It nullifies what you find and makes it inapplicable to any other pattern integrity because the pattern integrities that they are studying in this study

02:00:37.947 --> 02:00:40.529
are not relevant to natural pattern integrities.

02:00:40.589 --> 02:00:42.270
It's not a natural pattern integrity.

02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:47.633
It's a genetically inbred, transgenically modified mouse line.

02:00:47.653 --> 02:00:54.077
It changes things.

02:00:54.157 --> 02:00:54.938
Boy, that's, yeah.

02:00:57.254 --> 02:00:58.674
It changes things.

02:00:58.694 --> 02:01:11.597
In particular, inbred, genetically modified mutant mouse, which you can buy from the National Institute of Health Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers.

02:01:11.637 --> 02:01:12.878
I'm sure they're going to get shut down.

02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:15.778
In fact, they're transgenic mice.

02:01:16.878 --> 02:01:23.380
And you can buy them and use them and get grant money to use them and learn nothing about how your beautiful child works.

02:01:25.936 --> 02:01:33.337
that overexpress a human altered amyloid protein.

02:01:34.057 --> 02:01:38.438
They express a human altered amyloid protein.

02:01:42.419 --> 02:01:45.579
Even Vincent can see that this is bullshit, but not really.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.960
Because again, that's what happens when you're trapped.

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.601
When I was trapped, I called everybody's bullshit out all the time, but not all the way down to the hardwood.

02:01:56.124 --> 02:02:02.226
just down to them not wearing the right uniform, or your hat's on crooked, or you didn't say that quite right, or don't forget that that's not proven yet.

02:02:04.686 --> 02:02:06.227
But I gave them all their assumptions.

02:02:06.287 --> 02:02:15.369
I gave them their assumptions about amyloid, or I gave them their assumptions about genes, and about behavior related to genes, because that's what you gotta do to work in neurobiology.

02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:17.990
So I was just as broken.

02:02:19.991 --> 02:02:23.692
And I accepted vaccines and all that public health stuff, because I'm not a doctor.

02:02:24.727 --> 02:02:32.915
And because I raised my children, luckily, in Norway, where the same level of public health mythology is not pushed on parents.

02:02:35.398 --> 02:02:37.760
Not even close, because you know what they do in Norway?

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:44.327
They encourage you with three days in the hospital hotel room with a string that you can pull

02:02:45.185 --> 02:03:03.899
where you can sleep with your wife and your newborn kid for three days and pull on a string for 24 hours every day for three days to have a midwife come in and help you as the father learn how to help mom to get the baby to latch and breastfeed.

02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:06.401
Because mom can't see it.

02:03:07.442 --> 02:03:14.908
Mom can't see if there's enough of the breast in the mouth so that the mouth is encompassing the nipple.

02:03:16.323 --> 02:03:17.944
and Papa can help with that.

02:03:20.524 --> 02:03:42.152
And they spend three days encouraging women to not underestimate how wonderful it is, how beautiful it is, how much it is worth the time and effort to learn how to do it and how important it is for the husband to be present during it and be an expert enough to help so that in the middle of the night when wife is crying, you can remain calm

02:03:45.202 --> 02:03:54.005
And I can get chills thinking about those three days because I never imagined how wonderful it would be to bond with my wife in that way.

02:03:54.045 --> 02:04:01.488
And I never imagined how important it was to understand that because that's the reason why moms feel the way they feel.

02:04:03.108 --> 02:04:08.670
And I also believe that's the reason why these malevolent monsters want you to stop breastfeeding babies.

02:04:10.411 --> 02:04:13.452
Because they don't want strong, independent moms.

02:04:16.325 --> 02:04:26.980
They don't want strong, independent women who understand their worth and understand the irreducible complexity that is their little baby on their breast.

02:04:28.782 --> 02:04:30.685
They don't want them to even experience it.

02:04:38.718 --> 02:04:47.181
So these are mutations in the amyloid gene that are known to predispose to misfolding.

02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:56.404
So they put five copies of the mutant genes into the mice to try and, you know, because mice don't normally develop Alzheimer's.

02:04:56.504 --> 02:04:57.504
How would you know?

02:04:59.805 --> 02:05:01.805
Well, I think they do know, right?

02:05:01.845 --> 02:05:09.927
Because they would have loved to have found, this goes back to the history, they would have loved to find naturally occurring, you know, Alzheimer's malars, you know.

02:05:10.427 --> 02:05:11.868
But yes, they had to make these.

02:05:11.888 --> 02:05:12.668
They had to make these.

02:05:12.708 --> 02:05:14.028
You can buy them up in Jackson.

02:05:14.068 --> 02:05:15.668
It was actually up at Jackson.

02:05:15.868 --> 02:05:17.049
And why did they make them?

02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.989
And then we're going to stop.

02:05:19.049 --> 02:05:21.469
They made them because there was an amyloid camp.

02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:28.611
They made them because the Human Genome Project tells us that everything is genetic.

02:05:31.977 --> 02:05:46.628
They made them because the Human Genome Project provided the techniques and the technology to make knockout mice that would allow the amyloid camp, the tau camp, the inflammatory camp, the genetic causes of autism camp to exist.

02:05:51.732 --> 02:05:57.797
And in so doing, they have created an entire illusion of knowledge based on the genetic causes of autism

02:05:58.902 --> 02:06:06.728
the genetic causes of amyloid, the genetic causes of Parkinson's disease, and some of those are genetic explanations.

02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:18.617
And because some of those low-hanging fruit have a genetic explanation, then they think that they can say evolution because DNA.

02:06:20.202 --> 02:06:30.027
Because Mendel did some experiments on inbred pea plants that made it seem like they were dominant and recessive genes, we now think that evolution happened because of DNA.

02:06:33.277 --> 02:07:02.141
And this level of obfuscation of the truth, this level of irreverence for the irreducible sacred complexity of our children is facilitated and edified by that biological assumption that evolution because DNA and the way that it is used to create all of these little islands of investigation that execute steps of logic on false assumptions.

02:07:04.952 --> 02:07:13.697
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:07:14.897 --> 02:07:20.940
I don't actually think I have a goodbye slide here.

02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.761
And so I'm just going to use this one again.

02:07:26.496 --> 02:07:27.497
Thank you very much for coming.

02:07:28.317 --> 02:07:31.239
I'm going to go to the freshman basketball game in an hour or so.

02:07:31.519 --> 02:07:37.824
And then I'm going to go work out with my son doing some, I don't think the gym is going to be empty enough for me to film an episode.

02:07:37.844 --> 02:07:38.544
If it is, I will.

02:07:39.184 --> 02:07:46.369
And otherwise we'll get a JC on the hardwood episode done on Monday and probably up on the internet by Monday night or Tuesday.

02:07:47.110 --> 02:07:51.232
And as usual, or as I'm planning to do now, I'm going to try and take the weekend off.

02:07:51.272 --> 02:07:51.553
Although,

02:07:52.333 --> 02:07:56.055
Things may happen and I may end up doing a surprise stream on Saturday or Sunday.

02:07:56.115 --> 02:07:59.116
Maybe we'll even do an interview with Oma who's here.

02:07:59.896 --> 02:08:04.098
Maybe we'll just do a chat and discussion with Big Mike.

02:08:04.218 --> 02:08:04.578
I don't know.

02:08:05.679 --> 02:08:12.382
Most likely my plan is to take the weekend off and show up again next week for five days in a row, including another

02:08:13.473 --> 02:08:24.768
Bad Biology, including another Monday Meddler Medley, and including a, tomorrow we're gonna do a Friday week update as well, which I already have ready to go.

02:08:24.808 --> 02:08:28.613
We're gonna keep ringing the bell of that Scooby-Doo until people understand how bad it is.

02:08:29.113 --> 02:08:30.914
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks very much for being here.

02:08:30.934 --> 02:08:32.034
Thanks for supporting the stream.

02:08:32.054 --> 02:08:32.854
Thanks for sharing.

02:08:33.935 --> 02:08:42.657
I had a little glitch on the peer tube yesterday, so it took me a while to re-upload my stream from yesterday, but it is there now, so go check it out if you missed it.

02:08:42.677 --> 02:08:43.758
It was also a really good one.

02:08:44.478 --> 02:08:46.979
And again, I will see you again tomorrow.

02:08:47.019 --> 02:08:47.519
Thanks for coming.
