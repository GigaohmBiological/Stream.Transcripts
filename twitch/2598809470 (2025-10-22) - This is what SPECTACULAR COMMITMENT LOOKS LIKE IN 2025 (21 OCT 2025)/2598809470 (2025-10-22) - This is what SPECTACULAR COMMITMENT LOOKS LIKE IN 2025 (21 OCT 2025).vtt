WEBVTT

00:38.547 --> 00:40.634
That was a rather ominous start.

00:42.782 --> 00:43.063
Whoa.

01:01.203 --> 01:14.988
the specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious, and that's sort of my starting bias.

01:17.244 --> 01:31.030
The specializations should make you suspicious, because if it's gotten harder to evaluate what's going on, then it's presumably gotten easier for people to lie and to exaggerate, and then one should be a little bit suspicious, and that's sort of my starting bias.

01:35.153 --> 01:40.777
How do you think they live with themselves at this point when they just lie again and again and we have the internet to expose the lies?

01:41.037 --> 01:46.981
If this isn't 20 years ago when you were on CNN and we couldn't expose things, we can expose it now and they still do it.

01:47.882 --> 01:52.105
Well, I guess I would ask myself, I mean, I lie.

01:52.705 --> 01:54.807
If I'm really cornered or something, I lie.

01:54.827 --> 01:56.808
I really try not to.

01:56.828 --> 01:59.770
I try never to lie on TV.

01:59.790 --> 02:00.571
I don't like lying.

02:00.691 --> 02:03.753
I certainly do it out of weakness or whatever.

02:06.195 --> 02:08.896
a condition that we will not call autism.

02:09.036 --> 02:10.597
I don't like the word autism.

02:11.497 --> 02:12.537
He was vaccine damaged.

02:12.897 --> 02:14.318
He was neurologically damaged.

02:15.058 --> 02:17.759
A condition that we will not call autism.

02:17.899 --> 02:19.460
I don't like the word autism.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.400
He was vaccine damaged.

02:25.802 --> 02:31.424
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:32.090 --> 02:44.337
you know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and, you know, it's not, it's, you know, measles plus, you know, okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because, you know, not that many people die from it.

02:44.637 --> 02:46.619
It's just a big hassle in the end.

02:47.239 --> 02:53.222
But no, when we have this new pandemic that is, you know, got 75% mortality and it's not,

02:59.577 --> 03:02.920
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

03:02.980 --> 03:05.543
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

03:05.563 --> 03:13.771
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

03:14.011 --> 03:14.471
It can't.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.875
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

03:19.776 --> 03:23.880
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

03:25.953 --> 03:29.376
It's like Jay said, the RNA can't pandemic.

03:29.596 --> 03:30.037
It can't.

03:30.677 --> 03:34.461
And there's no reason to discuss this anymore, because it's clear.

03:35.362 --> 03:39.546
And if it's clear, we shouldn't waste time talking about it.

03:41.427 --> 03:41.928
Actually, J.J.

03:41.948 --> 03:48.554
Cooley's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

03:51.949 --> 03:53.510
I think truth is good for kids.

03:53.930 --> 03:57.792
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in this society.

03:58.232 --> 03:59.853
We want everybody to feel good.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.214
That's not the way life is.

04:23.021 --> 04:26.242
I woke up this morning, and the sun was gone.

04:27.303 --> 04:30.524
Turned on some music to start my day.

04:30.644 --> 04:36.267
And I asked myself, did I forget a song?

05:35.960 --> 05:43.410
If this is fate as the years go by, can I stir a cup as I walk along?

07:09.011 --> 07:22.227
when i'm tired i'm thinking cold i hide in my music forget the day and dream of a girl i used to know i close my

08:45.060 --> 08:46.722
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

08:46.762 --> 08:47.803
Welcome to the show.

08:47.863 --> 08:58.113
It's still Rocktober in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where GigaOM Biological comes to you live in the back of my garage.

08:58.273 --> 08:59.174
Hopefully there's

09:00.652 --> 09:03.134
Not any incriminating evidence on the table here.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.837
I didn't really check before I switched to my overhead cam.

09:05.857 --> 09:07.358
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

09:07.418 --> 09:08.199
Welcome, welcome.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.861
This is the Bat Cave at night.

09:11.322 --> 09:15.686
I was going to build a fire, but it's threatening to rain and I didn't want to be dealing with that.

09:16.646 --> 09:19.548
Um, so, uh, this is Rocktober.

09:20.468 --> 09:23.869
Um, I gotta tell you, we're still here trying to stay focused.

09:23.970 --> 09:25.330
Is this supposed to be over here?

09:25.350 --> 09:27.911
Are we supposed to be doing the big sweep?

09:27.991 --> 09:29.432
And then that would be down there.

09:29.532 --> 09:31.133
And then I could cut over to this one.

09:31.753 --> 09:32.393
Good evening.

09:32.453 --> 09:32.834
Hello.

09:32.974 --> 09:33.374
Welcome.

09:33.434 --> 09:35.195
It's all nice and cozy in here today.

09:35.215 --> 09:38.196
Um, we're still staying focused on the biology.

09:38.837 --> 09:41.359
are still not taking the bait on social media.

09:41.819 --> 09:43.340
And we're still trying to love our neighbors.

09:43.380 --> 09:49.964
We're still trying to reconnect with the right people in America to try and bring ourselves out of this nosedive.

09:51.285 --> 09:56.708
And the Right Now Show has been a focus of mine for the last couple of weeks.

09:58.355 --> 10:05.400
The last time that I used this particular slide deck The right now show was about the RFK jr.

10:05.560 --> 10:23.372
Enchantment and a new rule admission which referred to something that Bill Maher does which is always the same cast the same cast of characters and Then I also had a little segment that I saved up that I hadn't ever really gotten to called the longest con Can you still see it?

10:23.432 --> 10:27.835
And I was gonna show you all kinds of stuff about how all these people had been put in place

10:28.395 --> 10:54.344
During the course of the pandemic and then they're all getting rolled out in different time frames and it's all just this It's like they're in order for the play to last seven or eight years You got to have seven or eight years of script complete with seven or eight years of drama and questions and investigations and I don't know what else but they've definitely done it and they've done it in a way that is

10:55.612 --> 11:05.740
Quite frankly, I got to admit here, on the 22nd of October of 2025, I may have overestimated how far off script they are.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.984
They might actually be right, pretty much still right in the groove.

11:10.851 --> 11:13.952
They may have had to work harder to keep it in that groove.

11:14.452 --> 11:19.995
They may have had to work harder in order to make sure that people didn't find out the truth.

11:20.515 --> 11:35.341
They may have had to work harder because of our work here at GigaOM Biological, maybe harder because of the work that Mark Kulak has done, or harder because some of the work that other people have done on the internet, but as a whole,

11:36.121 --> 11:39.183
I think they intended more or less to bring us right here.

11:39.884 --> 11:56.156
And what I have been trying to make the argument for the last, I don't know, very many months, sorry, I'm shaking the whole table there is that, you know, as, as naive as I was, I, I, at one point also thought that Robert F. Kennedy jr.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.377
Was a legitimate

12:00.337 --> 12:14.732
objective, you know, free thinking, well-meaning, good-hearted, insightful, intelligent actor, you know, like as in person trying to do something in the world.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.361
And it turns out that I don't think that's the case at all.

12:18.441 --> 12:27.264
I think he could be the victim of an extremely focused and elaborate mind control operation since he was very, very young.

12:28.005 --> 12:35.448
Trauma opens up all kinds of doors for reprogramming and so does drug abuse and drug addiction.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.422
It's just remarkable.

12:38.502 --> 12:41.025
I think America was set up for this.

12:41.265 --> 12:48.453
I think that the Kennedy family was set up for this level of discrediting for many, many years.

12:48.513 --> 12:51.857
I mean, it's just hard for me to believe, ladies and gentlemen.

12:52.810 --> 13:00.898
that I'm about to show you a PBS News frontline documentary called The Rise of RFK Jr.

13:01.799 --> 13:09.306
And it is going to feature all of the players that we have been laying out the chronology of.

13:10.807 --> 13:16.273
And it's going to feature all of the narratives that we have been relaying out the chronology of.

13:18.957 --> 13:45.055
It is it is gonna blow your mind because I'm sorry we've been we have been right This has been an elaborate hoax and an operation that included Exquisitely, this is what's so amazing to see that a biosecurity national security state multiple Western nations involved this kind of

13:46.520 --> 14:04.894
operation was coordinated to the extent to which, orchestrated to the extent to which, they even controlled the candidates in office and orchestrated those changes in power from one administration to the next flawlessly.

14:06.644 --> 14:19.612
so that the blame, the mystery, the intrigue, and the credit could all be spread in different ways by different people from different perspectives, and they could all be telling the truth.

14:22.293 --> 14:25.395
I just can't even believe that I'm here to watch this thing right now.

14:25.455 --> 14:29.658
So I'm just gonna start it right now because I think it's just better that way if we just play it.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.620
So I think I can just... Where is it?

14:32.660 --> 14:33.401
It's over here.

14:34.222 --> 14:34.482
Right?

14:35.843 --> 14:38.665
And then... Oh no, then I gotta cut over here.

14:38.705 --> 14:39.906
This has gotta be this one.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.308
Cause this one would be... Right?

14:43.368 --> 14:47.331
This one would be over here and then... Is it gonna play?

14:51.980 --> 14:52.380
There it is.

14:54.701 --> 14:55.302
Front line.

14:55.682 --> 14:56.182
Front line.

14:56.242 --> 14:57.783
I mean, I don't know what to tell you anymore.

14:57.803 --> 15:02.025
This goal will be to make America healthy again.

15:02.045 --> 15:04.327
Senator Kennedy has been shot.

15:04.587 --> 15:06.948
The young man whose father just was assassinated.

15:07.008 --> 15:08.669
This is an inescapable trauma.

15:08.849 --> 15:14.372
Once you start seeing the world through a conspiratorial lens, I think you start to see conspiracies everywhere.

15:14.392 --> 15:15.793
They're not playing by the rules.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.774
They're not using gold standard science.

15:17.794 --> 15:18.955
They're not using evidence.

15:19.555 --> 15:21.276
He's the most famous Kennedy in America right now.

15:22.102 --> 15:25.489
Now on Frontline, the rise of RFK Jr.

15:27.092 --> 15:27.332
Hmm.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.237
Trying to make it louder, but it's not getting much louder.

15:31.508 --> 15:34.009
Okay, so already we're starting with this, right?

15:34.629 --> 15:39.171
Look at this.

15:41.232 --> 15:45.834
So they already started it with letting you know that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

15:45.974 --> 15:51.916
said out loud many times, in fact, that he thought that Donald Trump was the answer to his prayers.

15:53.817 --> 15:55.757
Like, that's pretty extraordinary, right?

15:57.588 --> 15:58.568
Why is that not going back?

15:58.588 --> 15:58.929
Look at that.

15:58.949 --> 16:00.149
So this is how they open.

16:24.886 --> 16:30.951
Something has happened at the Trump... Oh, we see Donald Trump there at a rally in Pennsylvania.

16:31.231 --> 16:35.134
Clearly, Secret Service wants to get him out of this situation.

16:35.674 --> 16:48.463
The moment that Donald Trump was missed by the bullet, we all saw this image of Trump standing with the American flag blowing behind him and blood running down his face.

16:51.666 --> 16:53.127
I don't know how you beat that image.

16:54.062 --> 16:55.103
Let me speak for myself.

16:55.503 --> 16:59.125
I just thought he just won the presidency of the United States of America.

17:01.106 --> 17:02.247
I felt very emotional.

17:02.427 --> 17:05.148
So we're really here, right?

17:05.669 --> 17:06.189
There was something.

17:06.249 --> 17:08.931
So this is going to annoy me watching president Trump.

17:09.391 --> 17:20.437
So we're really here right now confirming that Donald Trump was shot and that when Donald Trump was shot, that Robert F. Kennedy jr.

17:20.477 --> 17:23.199
Was persuaded to call Donald Trump by Cali means.

17:25.455 --> 17:27.998
And that Del Bigtree was there when it happened.

17:30.861 --> 17:35.826
And so, the spell is being cast, ladies and gentlemen, around the world.

17:37.107 --> 17:41.171
And the vast majority of people are fully under the capture of this spell.

17:43.894 --> 17:44.515
It's right now.

17:46.084 --> 17:51.528
with the blood dripping down his face and the history of Bobby's experiences with assassination.

17:51.548 --> 17:55.951
Law enforcement agencies are treating this as an attempted assassination.

17:55.971 --> 18:05.158
I felt a spiritual urge to call Bobby and put on his radar that this might be the time to call President Trump.

18:06.799 --> 18:09.361
And Bobby, after some reflection, thought that was a good idea.

18:10.502 --> 18:14.905
And I worked with Tucker Carlson, who connected Bobby to President Trump as he was leaving the hospital.

18:16.525 --> 18:21.247
I think a real relationship between the two men was forged on that first night.

18:21.287 --> 18:22.827
Bobby asked about his family.

18:44.261 --> 18:50.542
Having grown up with assassination of his own family, he said, this can be very traumatic for your kids and your grandkids.

18:50.962 --> 18:52.103
How's everybody doing?

18:53.423 --> 18:55.363
Trump said, I appreciate you asking, Bobby.

18:55.483 --> 18:58.524
You know, everyone's doing OK under the circumstances.

19:00.864 --> 19:03.725
President Trump then said to Bobby, I'm glad you called, Bobby.

19:04.765 --> 19:05.765
I've been wanting to talk to you.

19:07.226 --> 19:08.506
We should really work together.

19:11.428 --> 19:23.331
I think that this is kind of extraordinary that PBS News is letting Del Bigtree talk as the campaign manager of the 2024 presidential campaign of RFK Jr.

19:23.351 --> 19:32.114
without ever filling in his role in establishing the anti-vax movement in America, actually two years before they ever recruited him.

19:34.195 --> 19:44.019
They put out the Vax movie, they got Andrew Wakefield and Pauly Tommy over here, and they're not gonna say anything about Del Bigtree being that guy.

19:44.079 --> 19:51.362
They're just letting Del Bigtree being a good-looking guy with big blue eyes, you know, nice suit, talking about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

19:51.402 --> 19:52.802
in a very sympathetic voice.

19:52.842 --> 19:53.662
That's interesting.

19:55.303 --> 20:01.986
I would be, I would love you to just, and I think it would be so good for you, and so big for you, and we're gonna win.

20:02.386 --> 20:02.886
We're gonna win.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.687
We were all sort of shocked.

20:06.727 --> 20:14.694
We just thought it was going to be a condolences, you know, the call to wish everyone well, but it really sunk deep into Bobby.

20:14.754 --> 20:20.439
And we were like, wait a minute, are you, are you actually considering joining president Trump?

20:21.620 --> 20:24.802
And, uh, and he's.

20:25.523 --> 20:26.664
Make no mistake about it.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.006
This guy is a podcast actor.

20:30.205 --> 20:30.425
Right?

20:31.205 --> 20:32.746
He's a podcast actor.

20:32.826 --> 20:34.127
That's what we should see here.

20:34.147 --> 20:35.507
He said, I don't know.

20:37.928 --> 20:42.510
Which meant to all of us, oh my God, he's thinking about this.

20:46.052 --> 20:52.395
The son of Democratic icon, Robert Kennedy, suspending his independent campaign and endorsing Donald Trump.

20:52.435 --> 20:57.457
Kennedy has done the unthinkable, throw the family name behind a Republican candidate.

20:59.076 --> 21:01.759
He's seen his elevation to power and status again.

21:03.260 --> 21:06.784
It's a real inflection point, a real renaissance.

21:08.025 --> 21:10.247
I think that's really notable in his life.

21:13.170 --> 21:16.974
He's already had a period in his life when he was an addict.

21:18.135 --> 21:19.797
He publicly had a fall from grace.

21:22.202 --> 21:24.643
Rehabilitated himself.

21:24.663 --> 21:25.564
Oh What's that?

21:25.724 --> 21:27.685
What wait what hello?

21:28.045 --> 21:28.586
I'll go that.

21:28.606 --> 21:29.546
Oh, wow.

21:29.806 --> 21:30.447
What was that?

21:31.227 --> 21:36.150
rehabilitate bingo So we know what this picture is, right?

21:36.170 --> 21:42.854
That's that's some guy who like Did a show or something right Mark Kulak can tell you about that.

21:43.074 --> 21:46.576
I think that's funny So

21:50.171 --> 21:53.478
He became a vaccine skeptic, fell from mainstream grace.

21:55.362 --> 22:00.052
Now he's been rehabilitated by a powerful sector of American society.

22:02.535 --> 22:07.418
He's been rehabilitated by a powerful sector of American society.

22:07.438 --> 22:21.165
Would that powerful sector be a sector of people trying to create the illusion of a populist conservative movement in America that by definition is kind of dumb because

22:21.765 --> 22:23.246
Conservative people don't do that.

22:23.707 --> 22:29.991
But then, you know, she had tipped a mark for that really, I think, very astute observation.

22:30.471 --> 22:37.617
And so what we have is an anti-vax movement that was essentially sabotaged by a bunch of actors on a shitty script.

22:38.437 --> 22:41.420
And essentially that's what we have in the Trump administration.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.863
It is a conservative movement on a shitty script.

22:45.344 --> 22:52.690
And so you're given really bad alternatives that made it seem pretty obvious that you weren't going to vote for Biden or Harris.

22:52.770 --> 22:56.734
And so the fake conservative movement still seemed pretty reasonable.

23:01.067 --> 23:05.993
Don't get caught up into this, you know, the lesser of two evils kind of thing.

23:06.033 --> 23:08.596
That's not the right way to describe it.

23:09.477 --> 23:17.007
You're choosing from two actors, two bands at the same Lollapalooza.

23:18.889 --> 23:26.920
And in the last, say, 12 years, the bands that win the Lollapalooza contest have been rigged.

23:27.661 --> 23:35.212
The bands have agreed to not play their hits when they need to play their hits and play their hits when they're called on to play their hits.

23:38.146 --> 23:39.627
And people have been put in place.

23:40.227 --> 23:54.915
Bands have been playing shitty music for a long time, and they don't seem to get any better, even though they've been on stage for so long, and they've had so many sets to frickin' improve the transition between the two songs that they play every night, but they can't do it.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.317
And the reason why is because they are scripted that way.

23:59.778 --> 24:05.701
And what we see here is the culmination of many years of a script, and please understand,

24:07.395 --> 24:27.192
It is so important to understand that this book right here by Sky Horse Publishing, the same publishing company that published all of Robert Malone's books, published all of Robert F. Kennedy's books, published the book of Judy Mikovits, published the book of James Lyons Weiler, published the book of all of these clowns.

24:30.023 --> 24:32.986
also published a book in 2008 with Jesse Ventura.

24:33.066 --> 24:48.399
It was mostly a story about him and his rise or dealing with being the governor of Minnesota, but the epilogue is a story about if the body Ventura were to run for president as a Republican and then take

24:49.239 --> 24:58.305
as his running mate, the vice president, or sorry, as his running mate, as a vice president, the independent candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

24:58.365 --> 25:03.949
That is the epilogue of this book, in 2008, by Skyhorse Publishing.

25:04.049 --> 25:05.050
Tony Lyons!

25:05.931 --> 25:08.813
Tony Lyons is gonna be in this documentary!

25:13.416 --> 25:16.338
It's just not possible, ladies and gentlemen, it's not possible.

25:17.236 --> 25:24.480
becoming a Kennedy again in that glamorous Camelot way, but within the Trump movement.

25:27.922 --> 25:29.643
He's the most famous Kennedy in America right now.

25:48.168 --> 25:55.575
Please recall that PBS Frontline has given us multiple hours of Steve Bannon's political insight.

25:55.995 --> 25:57.036
Multiple hours.

25:59.158 --> 26:07.946
They've given us all kinds of coronavirus stuff, all kinds of climate change stuff, all kinds of America's divided and destroying itself stuff.

26:08.687 --> 26:13.071
And so this is exactly in the same pipeline here.

26:23.695 --> 26:32.120
I am announcing today my candidacy for the presidency of the United States.

26:32.260 --> 26:37.424
In 1968, 14-year-old Bobby Kennedy watched as his father commanded the national spotlight.

26:38.765 --> 26:45.809
I think about what it must have been like to be a young child, raised with just cameras on you all the time.

26:54.855 --> 26:59.238
There's a lot of mythologizing that begins almost from the cradle in that family.

26:59.979 --> 27:06.564
He writes about the kind of access that he had as a young child to some of the biggest political figures of his time.

27:09.466 --> 27:14.109
Bearing witness to moments in history that most of us just read about in history books.

27:16.651 --> 27:22.075
That has a pretty powerful effect on a young person in their sense of a mandate to do something with their lives.

27:24.841 --> 27:25.801
Matters are remedy.

27:26.081 --> 27:27.442
We cannot be satisfied.

27:27.582 --> 27:30.242
And that's why I run for president of the United States.

27:33.023 --> 27:42.725
Bobby Kennedy, the father, was running for president as a kind of having taken the baton of JFK and taking it to a new place.

27:42.925 --> 27:51.427
So Vanity Fair is the news organization that published the existence of drastic and then Tucker Carlson, like,

27:54.477 --> 28:02.566
broadcast the existence of that article in Vanity Fair and interviewed the author of it on his show while he was still on Fox in 2021.

28:03.607 --> 28:09.694
Vanity Fair is just one of these places that will do the same thing that the New York Times or the Atlantic will do.

28:10.695 --> 28:13.338
And so in this case, this guy is just magnificent.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.320
By the end of this, you're not going to like him very much.

28:21.320 --> 28:26.022
It had been four years since young Bobby's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, had been killed.

28:26.883 --> 28:29.624
President Kennedy has been assassinated.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.444
It's official now.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.085
The president is dead.

28:33.346 --> 28:39.669
RFK, particularly in the wake of his brother's death, had a real deep spiritual soul-searching.

28:41.158 --> 28:48.145
And that run in 68 was pretty monumental and pretty brave in a lot of ways for someone who had watched his brother die.

28:48.226 --> 28:56.054
It's interesting that they have people that could not possibly have any personal knowledge of this talk about it.

28:58.331 --> 29:05.192
It's kind of odd in my mind, but it's the way this is done.

29:05.272 --> 29:23.435
So what they're going to do now in my mind is show you a lot of stuff that if they had class, if this was still really about class and about, you know, a higher kind of thinking and doing, they wouldn't show you.

29:23.816 --> 29:26.296
And in fact, it's odd that it even exists.

29:28.211 --> 29:29.372
It's extraordinary.

29:30.232 --> 29:30.793
Public life.

29:31.693 --> 29:39.678
I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done.

29:39.698 --> 29:43.260
And I feel that I'm obliged to do all that I can.

29:44.581 --> 29:49.423
He was willing to fight for what he believed was right and he was willing to make sacrifices.

29:50.544 --> 29:57.008
Robert Kennedy learned through losing his own brother about being a compassionate human being.

29:58.840 --> 30:04.565
and he carried that on as he was able to touch and reach people in that way that I think Bobby Jr.

30:05.165 --> 30:06.786
really longed for himself.

30:09.168 --> 30:18.455
I ask for your help to change the course of the United States, to give us back our spirit, give us back our heart, and give us back our soul.

30:18.916 --> 30:19.756
I ask for your help.

30:22.719 --> 30:27.803
Bobby saw as a boy and a teenager that his father had these qualities

30:29.468 --> 30:37.934
His dad was definitely someone he emulated and felt he had to continue to do whatever he could as he grew up to follow that.

30:37.954 --> 30:43.137
I'm warning you that you are being set up, okay?

30:43.218 --> 30:44.819
Understand, you're being set up.

30:44.879 --> 30:48.001
It seems like PBS NewsHour is incredibly sympathetic.

30:49.762 --> 30:51.423
He deeply, deeply loved his father.

30:53.765 --> 30:55.226
Home was Hickory Hill.

30:56.658 --> 31:01.901
a Virginia estate where his father built a paradise for Bobby, his brothers, and sisters.

31:01.921 --> 31:10.266
♪ ♪ The backdrop for this is his very unusual childhood.

31:10.286 --> 31:18.531
He's one of 11 children in a house that is wild in a lot of ways.

31:18.571 --> 31:23.214
I think wild with kids running around, wild with this big family.

31:23.234 --> 31:26.116
And there's a lot of money

31:27.611 --> 31:29.252
and there's a ton of animals.

31:31.172 --> 31:38.554
He had a lot of exotic animals, lizards and snakes, and he had a terrarium in Hickory Hill.

31:39.755 --> 31:45.056
I mean, Hickory Hill was, you know, as Andre Malraux said, hell's a-poppin'.

31:46.157 --> 31:48.738
Bobby's cousin Stephen was often at Hickory Hill.

31:51.559 --> 31:56.180
It was a really fun, chaotic and interesting place to be.

31:58.567 --> 32:00.609
I had a pet show every year for charity.

32:00.629 --> 32:11.137
When he was very young, his father gave him a gift, and it was a red-tailed hawk.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.200
And he fell in love with this bird.

32:15.140 --> 32:17.903
Dick Russell wrote a biography of RFK Jr.

32:18.123 --> 32:19.083
and is a close friend.

32:19.104 --> 32:26.990
It went from raising falcons to whitewater rafting trips that his father took him on on the Hudson River and elsewhere.

32:28.339 --> 32:34.122
took him down to the Grand Canyon, showed him the beauty of the outdoors, and he fell in love with it.

32:35.103 --> 32:41.707
I think for a boy growing up in this sort of fairytale atmosphere, it must have been really exciting, privileged,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.236
energizing in all sorts of ways.

33:02.259 --> 33:03.179
But also nightmarish.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.581
What happens when it goes wrong?

33:07.502 --> 33:10.665
My thanks to all of you, and now it's on to Chicago, and let's win there.

33:10.685 --> 33:13.126
Thank you very much.

33:14.007 --> 33:19.591
What happens when it turns out not to be a dream, but actually turns into a kind of nightmare?

33:21.432 --> 33:24.094
Which it does, in the most horrible, violent ways.

33:25.259 --> 33:35.863
Please remember that trauma is a great way to open your mind to manipulation or influence or suggestion and so showing this video is

33:49.953 --> 33:59.461
and the music and the lead up to it so that you feel like you're in the shoes of that young boy, that young 14 year old whose dad's about to die.

34:00.062 --> 34:01.803
That's being done on purpose.

34:03.084 --> 34:13.412
This is classless because it is a military, militarily precise emotional manipulation of the audience

34:14.298 --> 34:21.519
because they're about to take this fake conservative populist movement in America and make it face plant on itself.

34:21.999 --> 34:27.580
That was the whole reason they got everybody riled up behind Trump and behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

34:27.620 --> 34:33.361
and behind the fake health freedom movement, was to get them set up for a face plant.

34:36.262 --> 34:37.082
That's it, Wafers, get it.

34:37.122 --> 34:38.302
Hit the gun, Wafers.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.243
Okay, now hold on to the guy.

34:48.550 --> 34:51.212
cameras captured the moments of Bobby grieving.

34:53.373 --> 35:04.321
If the cameras captured the moments of Bobby grieving and Bobby is now the HHS secretary in America, why in the world would they feel like it would be okay to show it?

35:05.622 --> 35:07.063
What archive is this in?

35:12.747 --> 35:17.670
Unless they're, you know, manipulating you.

35:30.618 --> 35:44.745
The day of the funeral, he just kind of goes up to his father's office and looks at all the pictures and lays down and just cries.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.681
I didn't see what her credentials were.

35:58.701 --> 35:59.882
How the hell does she know all this?

35:59.922 --> 36:02.884
It's just a 14-year-old kid sobbing for hours in his father's office.

36:25.467 --> 36:29.529
Now the car bearing Senator Kennedy is passing by this point.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.432
Of course, he talked about this train ride on stage in Boston.

36:34.452 --> 36:36.053
My father organized that train that went from St.

36:36.073 --> 36:38.754
Patrick's Cathedral to Arlington Cemetery.

36:41.055 --> 36:42.436
I was on that train myself.

36:45.037 --> 36:48.539
I, like Bobby, looked out the window for, I think it was six hours.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.782
Over two million people, I believe, on the tracks.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.152
It was very, very moving.

37:02.634 --> 37:06.415
Losing a parent under any circumstance is devastating, especially when you're young.

37:07.835 --> 37:15.578
It has to be exceptionally more so when you're in the public eye and you're 14 years old.

37:16.438 --> 37:26.461
It would have to be even more so, right, if your father was killed by the intelligence agencies because of some reason, like they run the world.

37:27.748 --> 37:30.130
And so they killed your father and your uncle.

37:31.691 --> 37:46.862
And so they, how many of these Kennedy kids were under the focus of intense control operations after these great big intelligence agencies or organized crime or the Jews, whoever it was, killed his father and his uncle.

37:48.062 --> 37:55.628
It's kind of like Mark said the other day that if you could have stopped the terrorists from crashing the planes into the buildings, wouldn't the explosives still been there?

38:00.925 --> 38:04.027
And so they're not really talking about it in the right way, right?

38:04.067 --> 38:13.772
Because I guess some crazy guy just killed his uncle and some crazy guy just killed his dad and who did it and why they did it doesn't even matter.

38:13.792 --> 38:18.754
They're not going to acknowledge that that's the biggest conspiracy on earth.

38:20.455 --> 38:29.700
That there are more explanations and more bad guys associated with the assassination of those two guys than any other story on earth.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.962
It makes Charlie Kirk look like an open shut case.

38:34.022 --> 38:41.790
It makes Donald Trump's shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania look like an open and shut case.

38:43.892 --> 38:47.755
Kid went on social media, got bad ideas, climbed on roof, got shot.

38:49.837 --> 38:54.201
And I guess the same with the guy with the trans boyfriend or something like that.

38:54.722 --> 38:56.003
We're supposed to believe.

38:57.062 --> 39:18.839
that despite the fact that everybody around the world believes that RFK and JFK were killed by an elaborate government conspiracy that might've also involved either the Vatican or the Russians or the Jews or something, or the organized crime, I don't know, that then they just stopped and then they let everything go again.

39:18.879 --> 39:23.022
They let all their kids go and, you know, let all the, everything, that's it.

39:23.322 --> 39:25.704
Just, they got rid of the dads and then that was enough.

39:27.383 --> 39:30.966
Then they stopped doing stuff until they got Epstein out there.

39:30.986 --> 39:34.710
And then I guess Epstein started controlling people because, I don't know.

39:35.711 --> 39:37.773
You see how dumb this story is?

39:41.116 --> 39:41.937
It's remarkable.

39:44.199 --> 39:48.583
It was probably extremely traumatic and terrifying and sad.

39:51.872 --> 40:01.356
How do you make sense of your life as John Kennedy's nephew and Robert Kennedy's son, carrying almost a stigmata?

40:03.937 --> 40:07.058
Are you good enough to be that kind of martyr?

40:07.218 --> 40:15.402
Carrying a stigmata, in case you're not aware of what that means, it means that you have the signs of a crucifixion in your hands because you're a saint.

40:16.499 --> 40:27.746
And you're like, what kind of stupid ass statement is that for him with a non-American accent to make on my American public television, damn it.

40:33.749 --> 40:36.071
It's a burden, even in much better circumstances.

40:37.411 --> 40:43.075
But to do so in circumstances of trauma, of just immense pain,

40:45.454 --> 40:48.898
You know, it just has to leave very, very deep psychological scars.

40:51.661 --> 40:55.585
That was a really difficult time after Bobby's father was killed.

40:57.107 --> 40:58.769
Things definitely changed.

41:00.531 --> 41:02.934
I think a lot of people had...

41:05.103 --> 41:09.645
maybe unrealized, you know, trauma, looking back on it.

41:10.485 --> 41:19.709
I think people just sort of soldiered through it, and it was probably difficult for a lot of people, you know, not only in my generation, but for the older generation as well.

41:21.570 --> 41:23.871
Bobby's mother struggled to comfort her children.

41:25.312 --> 41:29.094
Ethel was pregnant with her 11th child when RFK was assassinated.

41:30.394 --> 41:33.536
And I think she was overwhelmed in the aftermath of the assassination.

41:35.745 --> 41:38.907
Bobby really was a little bit lost in the shuffle.

41:40.348 --> 41:46.351
The effect of that for Bobby Kennedy was a really difficult relationship with his mother, a contentious relationship with his mother.

41:49.433 --> 41:50.774
She sent him off to boarding school.

41:51.835 --> 41:58.379
He gets sent off to start his freshman year of high school months after his dad shot, and he had a boarding school, like, far from his family.

41:58.399 --> 42:05.143
He lasted two years before being kicked out and went on to cycle through two more schools.

42:06.431 --> 42:07.532
He was somewhat of a loner.

42:08.673 --> 42:10.315
He just wanted to disappear.

42:10.875 --> 42:13.018
He was a lost soul, is the best way I could describe it.

42:14.079 --> 42:17.442
Skip Hine and Bobby were classmates at the elite Pomfret school.

42:18.663 --> 42:25.250
There was one picture in my yearbook of him sitting in a field in front of the dorms with his back to the camera.

42:26.871 --> 42:28.193
He avoided all the photographs.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.986
I just never really saw him being in big groups.

42:32.046 --> 42:34.129
I didn't see him, you know, a big jovial laugh.

42:35.009 --> 42:38.893
He was just very subdued, but very polite, considerate.

42:40.075 --> 42:42.357
But, you know, he was much more alone.

42:44.119 --> 42:48.663
The tragedies that he experienced, and most of all the loss of his father, who he was very close to.

42:49.745 --> 42:53.208
led to the need to escape and very quickly he was used.

43:03.467 --> 43:32.896
him before he became a presidential candidate and after he became a presidential candidate mostly because it was already what they were doing and because he's his friend and because apparently Biden didn't offer him personal security protection and then after Donald Trump got elected he was still raising money via email to pay off this guy's security detail from when he ran for president which is kind of comical

43:33.860 --> 43:41.050
I got like 50 emails from him over the course of six months trying to pay for his presidential campaign after he ended it.

43:44.154 --> 43:46.638
Somehow or another, this all doesn't add up.

43:49.602 --> 43:50.824
It's really weird.

43:52.415 --> 43:55.016
Because this is supposedly one of his best friends.

43:55.356 --> 43:55.616
See?

43:55.916 --> 43:56.216
Friend.

43:56.276 --> 43:57.636
It's one of his best friends.

43:58.297 --> 44:04.238
I shook this guy's hand in Boston at the meet and greet after Bobby announced his candidacy.

44:04.298 --> 44:09.620
And I said, Gavin, it's really great to meet you, thinking he had no idea who I was.

44:10.180 --> 44:11.780
And he said, oh, I know who you are.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.821
All my guys watch your show.

44:14.341 --> 44:21.423
That's exactly what Gavin DeBecker said to me before I took my first selfie with Bobby Kennedy.

44:21.463 --> 44:30.566
And at the time, I could have taken a picture with that woman from Larry David's show too, but I actually didn't ask her to come over.

44:31.426 --> 44:35.808
And I didn't even know what that show was at that time.

44:35.868 --> 44:37.608
I only watched it since then.

44:38.248 --> 44:42.049
Since I learned that his wife was a famous actor, his second wife.

44:42.229 --> 44:43.810
It's just remarkable!

44:46.408 --> 44:47.008
using drugs.

44:48.549 --> 44:52.612
Bobby does a lot of drugs and he acts out and he goes to a lot of different schools.

44:53.973 --> 44:55.554
And I think he's a bad boy.

44:55.934 --> 45:00.377
To me, it's sort of a classic, very tragic portrait of a struggling adolescent.

45:01.938 --> 45:12.604
I do know from at least somebody told me on the inside of CHD that actually Gavin DeBecker's firm is also the firm that screens everybody before they're hired by CHD.

45:12.644 --> 45:15.446
That's just something interesting to write down in the background.

45:16.977 --> 45:19.698
He's a young man whose father just was assassinated.

45:20.758 --> 45:22.458
This is an inescapable trauma.

45:23.959 --> 45:25.259
He was never grounded, really.

45:26.159 --> 45:32.221
And I think that the ready availability of drugs and the times he was in, it's the early 1970s.

45:32.261 --> 45:40.603
More important to remember is that the bear carcass story was more recently retold

45:42.769 --> 45:46.694
to a very special Roseanne bar, which is kind of cool, right?

45:48.256 --> 45:54.464
And he's kind of conspire to create an environment that's not going to help ground him.

45:55.413 --> 45:59.915
Once again, members of the Kennedy family are in the news, and the occasion is not a happy one.

46:00.315 --> 46:04.296
At 16, his arrest for drug possession became national news.

46:04.757 --> 46:12.159
Warrants have been issued for the arrest of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the 16-year-old son of the late senator, on marijuana charges.

46:12.960 --> 46:16.181
Because of the Kennedy name, they will also face a national spotlight.

46:17.581 --> 46:19.662
His mother was really upset.

46:20.863 --> 46:24.424
She was really angry and told Bobby he was, you know, ruining the family name.

46:25.543 --> 46:32.205
But Ethel and the family hoped Bobby would redeem himself on the well-worn Kennedy path, Harvard.

46:33.666 --> 46:35.727
That's part of the Kennedy family legacy.

46:35.747 --> 46:44.490
He was a screwed-up teenager who got thrown out of two boarding schools and still ended up at Harvard because he has the Kennedy name and pedigree.

46:45.650 --> 46:49.552
Harvard was a space in which there were no consequences for bad behavior.

46:51.144 --> 46:54.992
Clearly growing up in a powerful wealthy family is an advantage.

46:55.192 --> 46:55.813
No question.

46:56.996 --> 47:02.967
Joseph P. Kennedy, my uncle, a good thing that is pointed out in the chat who gave him the drugs.

47:04.534 --> 47:06.616
Was he just, you know, very clever?

47:06.716 --> 47:09.779
He just went off the school campus and found the drugs.

47:09.819 --> 47:11.800
You know, it was just really easy for him to get them.

47:11.841 --> 47:12.781
He had the cash.

47:12.841 --> 47:13.422
You know what I mean?

47:14.022 --> 47:16.124
And I think that's an excellent question.

47:17.245 --> 47:22.670
The same people who gave him the drugs are probably the same people who killed his father and his uncle.

47:22.970 --> 47:23.311
You see?

47:23.791 --> 47:25.473
That's the thing I'm trying to say.

47:26.053 --> 47:35.498
is that if there really is a conspiracy theory, if there really is a conspiracy theory that's going to explain things, it's got to explain more than one single event.

47:36.799 --> 47:45.183
It can't be a separate conspiracy theory for the plane that hit the towers and a separate conspiracy theory for the plane that never hit the Pentagon.

47:46.864 --> 47:51.207
And then a separate conspiracy theory for the space lasers that shot the buildings down.

47:51.567 --> 47:52.867
It can't work like that.

47:52.927 --> 47:53.728
That's stupid.

47:55.424 --> 48:04.154
Especially when there are very simple explanations like the same people that got rid of JFK and RFK also got rid of Estes Kefauver.

48:05.512 --> 48:14.337
and then looked to try and use one or more of their children to make sure that they could control the legacy of that family until it was extinguished.

48:14.937 --> 48:17.899
Now, now we're talking like big kids.

48:18.299 --> 48:25.343
You see, now we're talking like kids that are actually around a campfire where we're not afraid to say what we think.

48:27.084 --> 48:29.585
Joe's name is on the wall of the Harvard church.

48:30.445 --> 48:32.086
Obviously John F. Kennedy went to Harvard.

48:32.206 --> 48:33.307
RFK went to Harvard.

48:40.273 --> 48:45.154
He was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tall and handsome and charismatic.

48:45.214 --> 48:49.576
Wow, he looks a lot like Mark Kulak did when he was younger, actually, believe it or not.

48:49.976 --> 48:51.916
Sorry, Mark.

48:51.936 --> 48:53.497
A Kennedy.

48:53.517 --> 48:55.797
At least that hair!

48:56.498 --> 48:57.238
That hair!

48:57.378 --> 49:03.680
Mark had flowing locks when he was younger, and that's at least what I saw there, flowing locks.

49:04.800 --> 49:04.960
Type.

49:07.406 --> 49:09.808
at that moment, which is this sort of preppy hippie.

49:10.329 --> 49:15.814
He had long hair and, you know, smoked pot a lot.

49:17.335 --> 49:19.898
He could probably, couldn't hardly say it.

49:20.278 --> 49:24.382
I've heard that all the young, cool, glamorous, preppy kids were using cocaine.

49:24.922 --> 49:25.963
And it's great.

49:26.544 --> 49:27.685
And what do you know?

49:27.905 --> 49:29.006
Bobby Kennedy Jr.

49:29.487 --> 49:30.608
is a dealer of cocaine.

49:32.045 --> 49:32.765
And it was exciting.

49:33.366 --> 49:34.526
I was buying cocaine.

49:35.126 --> 49:37.567
And I'm buying it from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:39.288 --> 49:41.449
I wondered, like, does he need to do this?

49:41.609 --> 49:43.710
Is he not getting a big enough allowance?

49:44.010 --> 49:46.391
Or is this way to support his own health?

49:46.511 --> 49:46.971
I didn't know.

49:47.511 --> 49:52.953
But I took it as an act of kind of performative outlawry.

49:54.374 --> 49:57.735
He's a cool cat outlaw guy who can do this.

49:58.055 --> 49:59.316
Was that Ted Danson?

50:00.700 --> 50:04.621
Or was that the guy from Back to the Future?

50:04.681 --> 50:05.581
Who was that dude?

50:07.722 --> 50:09.222
He wasn't just using cocaine.

50:09.963 --> 50:10.903
It was speedballs.

50:11.703 --> 50:20.126
Cocaine mixed with- I'm sorry, but what comes to mind right now is Rick James on the Dave Chappelle program saying, Cocaine's a hell of a drug!

50:20.726 --> 50:21.506
It's a hell of a drug!

50:22.981 --> 50:31.307
I mean, we're talking about shooting speedballs and very hardcore drugs that are not social in any way.

50:31.407 --> 50:37.371
They are drugs that leave you kind of, you know, knotted out and alone in a room.

50:38.792 --> 50:50.501
It was... What does that guy know about... He lists speedballs and probably his only other thing that he could say is that he thinks James Belushi died of a speedball.

50:51.682 --> 50:53.903
self-destructive and grim.

50:55.064 --> 50:59.367
Coke and heroin were my drugs of choice over the next 14 years.

51:00.847 --> 51:02.008
People had an idea.

51:02.028 --> 51:08.932
He used cocaine and heroin for 14 years.

51:10.653 --> 51:13.875
That, now that is hardcore.

51:13.895 --> 51:14.415
14 years.

51:19.221 --> 51:25.204
of cocaine and heroin, you... you... you are gonna feel that.

51:25.844 --> 51:26.224
Damn.

51:27.004 --> 51:27.424
Damn!

51:29.565 --> 51:30.446
Something was wrong.

51:30.466 --> 51:34.247
I had no clue about how badly off I was.

51:35.908 --> 51:38.069
He just wanted to be removed from the life.

51:39.129 --> 51:41.030
He just wanted to get away from his life.

51:42.351 --> 51:47.153
There's an absolute direct relationship between the tragedies and his...

51:48.919 --> 51:49.519
his addiction.

51:50.339 --> 51:54.181
Blake Fleetwood has been friends with Bobby Kennedy since his Harvard days.

51:55.121 --> 51:58.722
His addictions were very serious and they were very concerning.

51:59.362 --> 52:00.322
Uh, he could have.

52:00.743 --> 52:01.063
Wow.

52:01.103 --> 52:08.185
Wouldn't it be interesting as if they were actually weren't as bad as all these people are saying, but that's gotta be part of the story.

52:08.605 --> 52:11.086
And so they're all scripted to say it.

52:11.977 --> 52:19.660
but actually he's not as messed up from the cocaine and the heroin as he is messed up from like the LSD or whatever other shit they were giving him.

52:20.440 --> 52:24.942
My goodness, this music score is going full out for sure, my man.

52:26.142 --> 52:27.503
He could have died many times.

52:28.903 --> 52:32.604
He's oblivious to danger out there.

52:32.845 --> 52:35.525
He was almost killed by a bear in a bicycle.

52:36.166 --> 52:39.447
Swimming across a river filled with piranhas and stuff like that.

52:41.789 --> 52:42.449
Why did he say that?

52:42.469 --> 52:44.611
It was a very desperate, desperate time for him.

52:44.631 --> 52:52.316
I think there was a point in his life where he didn't really care that much, you know, whether he lived or died.

52:54.598 --> 52:59.641
But even as he struggled, he increasingly tried to project the image of a Kennedy.

53:02.823 --> 53:04.485
Bobby was good at compartmentalizing.

53:05.728 --> 53:11.252
He was very high functioning, even as he took drugs, he could go on and do what he was gonna do.

53:12.033 --> 53:20.139
Are you telling me that if you have enough money and you can afford cocaine and heroin, that you can be a functional cocaine and heroin addict?

53:21.680 --> 53:24.182
Oh my gosh, why don't they just say that then?

53:25.660 --> 53:40.171
Why don't they just say that because actually what they're doing is telling you without telling you because there's lots of people that are capable of being functioning heroin and cocaine addicts as long as they have enough money and they can get the heroin and the cocaine.

53:42.532 --> 53:43.373
It's not a joke.

53:43.453 --> 53:43.973
It's real.

53:44.974 --> 53:51.639
For 14 years, he probably used cocaine and heroin and was fine with it and it didn't ruin him because he could always get it.

53:51.719 --> 53:52.760
He didn't run out of money.

53:54.301 --> 53:55.702
He didn't ever go to jail.

53:56.583 --> 54:05.471
How is it possible that he was 14 and there was an arrest warrant for him for marijuana, but he was at Harvard selling Coke and doing heroin for 14?

54:09.195 --> 54:11.036
Not many people knew he was a drug addict.

54:12.298 --> 54:14.159
And there's this private dark side to him.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.703
And then there's this public side, which he's able to act out very credibly.

54:18.962 --> 54:47.777
That's it right there in the chat those guys know it's all about having a clean source of cocaine and a clean source of heroin and have it not be mixed with anything else not have it be contaminated or dirty and so if you can get pharmaceutical grade shit yes you can cope for a very long time and you probably cope very well have a lot of high-functioning moments you know the movie what was that movie about limitless

54:48.817 --> 54:58.243
It's probably really, really just kind of about like Adderall and cocaine and heroin in quantities, you know, daily.

54:59.344 --> 55:00.224
It's really.

55:00.604 --> 55:05.768
Kay, Bobby's senior thesis even became a book, which he promoted on television.

55:06.668 --> 55:13.973
Our first guest, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of- It became a book that he was allowed to promote on television.

55:14.053 --> 55:15.374
Why do they say it like this?

55:17.881 --> 55:18.962
And that's the key here.

55:20.223 --> 55:32.712
PBS NewsHour pretends again, like, you know, just because he's a Kennedy and they've got all these connections, he's able to get on TV and sell his book and pretend that he's got everything together when really he doesn't.

55:33.152 --> 55:34.513
He's setting himself up.

55:34.574 --> 55:35.634
He's a big liar.

55:36.395 --> 55:38.396
How is that possible?

55:39.657 --> 55:40.118
It's not.

55:41.328 --> 55:49.594
He was able to sell his book and put his book out there because this is all part of an elaborate use of the Kennedy children.

55:52.095 --> 55:57.019
It is an opportunity that presented itself at the trauma of his dad's death.

55:58.460 --> 56:00.881
They probably tried it with more than one of the kids.

56:00.981 --> 56:02.202
This is the one they got.

56:07.105 --> 56:07.966
It's unbelievable.

56:09.417 --> 56:11.359
The late Senator Kennedy from New York.

56:11.739 --> 56:14.061
This is his book, Judge Frank M. Trump.

56:14.141 --> 56:34.619
There's a consistency in his life story in that whatever messes are happening internally or in his personal life, nothing scuffs the notion that he is this golden boy, inheritor of a golden legacy.

56:38.330 --> 56:39.811
I just want to go back for a second.

56:42.913 --> 56:44.014
How was the volume down?

56:46.195 --> 56:46.876
Yes, thank you.

56:48.117 --> 56:50.578
Some kind of snack would be great too, but I don't know what there is.

56:55.182 --> 56:55.642
It's fine.

56:55.742 --> 56:56.102
It's good.

56:56.162 --> 56:56.482
It's good.

56:56.542 --> 56:57.223
Don't worry about it.

57:00.197 --> 57:05.122
Our first guest, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late Senator Kennedy.

57:05.323 --> 57:10.408
Now look, he's sitting there right now with a funny face on, and in fact, they don't play this clip for you.

57:10.448 --> 57:12.050
They just show you that it occurred.

57:12.691 --> 57:15.974
Watch him stare down at this guy.

57:16.014 --> 57:21.440
It's almost like he's not very comfortable with being on television selling his book.

57:21.500 --> 57:22.041
Look at this.

57:26.239 --> 57:36.023
There's a consistency in his life story in that whatever messes are happening internally or in his personal life.

57:36.423 --> 57:39.484
Why are we listening to all these chicks about him?

57:39.564 --> 57:40.685
Like, it's weird.

57:40.945 --> 57:43.286
It's really weird.

57:44.346 --> 57:46.187
Nothing scuffs.

57:47.961 --> 57:53.465
the notion that he is this golden boy, inheritor of a golden legacy.

57:53.485 --> 57:54.746
He definitely was ambitious.

57:54.786 --> 57:56.628
He wanted to be involved in politics.

57:56.708 --> 57:59.330
I think he felt that he might want to be president someday.

58:10.879 --> 58:13.720
I'll probably do some form of public service.

58:13.980 --> 58:19.781
I think everybody in my family really feels that a lot of my father's goals and ideals are worth pursuing.

58:20.261 --> 58:30.744
And so how hard would it be for them to have put people around him since he was 14 to put those ideas in his head and at the same time put the cocaine and heroin in his pocket?

58:34.332 --> 58:36.293
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, you got to see it.

58:36.333 --> 58:38.655
America has been under attack for a long time.

58:38.695 --> 58:49.502
You want to believe that America has been under attack since JFK and RFK, but you don't really want to think about the implications of Estes Kefauver and, and Les Weinstein.

58:49.522 --> 59:03.652
You don't want to think of the implications of the fact that maybe this kid has been set up for a very long time in a sort of pseudo Truman show over 50 years of a Truman show that involved a lot of drugs and a lot of sex.

59:04.452 --> 59:12.017
and a lot of lies, and a lot of manipulation for him to believe wholeheartedly that this is what he's supposed to do with his life.

59:12.097 --> 59:15.679
Maybe even that Donald Trump is the answers to his prayers.

59:16.840 --> 59:17.780
Where'd you get those shoes?

59:19.181 --> 59:20.482
Those are Alabama shoes.

59:22.443 --> 59:24.705
Man, that's some kind of boot, I'll tell you.

59:24.805 --> 59:25.925
Okay, we're gonna take a break.

59:26.266 --> 59:27.206
Just a second, don't go away.

59:27.326 --> 59:28.087
Where'd you get those shoes?

59:38.683 --> 59:40.424
He's trying to live a very conventional Kennedy life.

59:41.604 --> 59:44.925
He had been dutifully going to Harvard, going to UVA Law School.

59:45.905 --> 59:49.807
He's given a position in the Manhattan DA's office without having passed the bar.

59:51.027 --> 59:52.768
He gets married.

59:52.848 --> 59:59.430
I mean, he's doing a lot of really conventional things, a lot of things that are following in the Kennedy way of doing things.

01:00:00.816 --> 01:00:03.457
He married this woman, Emily Black, who looked like Jackie Kennedy.

01:00:04.337 --> 01:00:09.758
People who were close to the family said, oh, he really is going to become politically engaged.

01:00:09.798 --> 01:00:13.579
He's marrying somebody who looks like she's meant to be the first lady of the United States.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.641
He's able, clearly, to do that while he's on heroin.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.862
To live in more than one reality at the same time.

01:00:24.477 --> 01:00:35.781
The compartmentalization that allows him to survive through that period when he's a heroin addict has very positive effects for him, in a sense.

01:00:36.661 --> 01:00:39.402
However, it does have long-term consequences.

01:00:41.783 --> 01:00:47.965
People who learn to compartmentalize can also be very, very good at lying.

01:00:49.738 --> 01:00:57.604
They can get very good at convincing themselves in one half of their brain that what they're saying actually is true, even though they know it's not.

01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:02.867
Years later in recovery, he wrote about it in his journal.

01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:14.896
So this guy who is some kind of master of books for the New York times or something, the Irish accent guy is now telling us about the

01:01:17.223 --> 01:01:19.605
psychiatric condition of this kid.

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:25.190
And I guess he's basing it on this one passage that our narrator is going to read.

01:01:44.795 --> 01:01:48.458
I think that there is some sense of the seams ripping a bit.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.361
Bobby fails the bar.

01:01:52.983 --> 01:01:58.768
He's got a big lawyer job in Manhattan that's supposed to be kind of high profile, and he's not doing well at it.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:02.312
He's sort of succumbing to his drug addiction.

01:02:06.916 --> 01:02:10.079
Then, one night, it all caught up with him.

01:02:10.987 --> 01:02:14.617
There was a new and dramatic development today in the story of young Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:19.509
Kennedy's luggage was searched in South Dakota for what were called controlled substances.

01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:21.890
He was on a plane to South Dakota.

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:27.535
He had shot heroin, and he was overdosing, and he went into the bathroom and passed out there.

01:02:27.975 --> 01:02:28.956
Robert Kennedy Jr.

01:02:28.996 --> 01:02:30.657
has been charged with possessing heroin.

01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:33.299
A small amount of heroin was found in his flight bag.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.281
And this is how it all became public.

01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:42.547
The 29-year-old son of the late senator today was charged with heroin possession, a felony that could land him in jail for two years.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:48.972
Suddenly, a decade of heroin abuse and heroin addiction is a public event.

01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:59.431
His fall from grace is very public.

01:03:02.133 --> 01:03:06.917
There's a taint of shame, of failure.

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:14.662
But it's not just his own personal shame, his own hitting rock bottom.

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:24.129
It's this whole great saga, multi-generational saga of the Kennedys coming potentially to this point of self-abasement.

01:03:27.216 --> 01:03:29.197
The devastation wouldn't stop there.

01:03:30.118 --> 01:03:35.441
The family whose tragedies our country has followed and indeed felt has been struck once again.

01:03:36.162 --> 01:03:39.123
David Kennedy, found dead in a Palm Beach, Florida, hotel room.

01:03:40.224 --> 01:03:50.010
David Kennedy, who was Bobby's younger brother, he died of an overdose in Florida shortly after Kennedy had his arrested.

01:03:52.352 --> 01:03:54.473
So were they going after more than one kid?

01:03:58.086 --> 01:03:59.446
Are you starting to see the point now?

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:07.609
The reason why it doesn't matter if you stopped the hijackers when there were explosives already in the buildings.

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:15.132
It doesn't matter if you figure out who shot John F. Kennedy if you don't think about Estes Kefauver.

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:21.074
It doesn't matter if you figured out who shot Robert F. Kennedy if you don't figure out what the frick they would do with their kids.

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:27.036
If they were willing and able to kill the President of the United States

01:04:28.155 --> 01:04:29.536
And then a year later, his brother.

01:04:30.377 --> 01:04:30.857
Come on.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.339
In South Dakota.

01:04:39.284 --> 01:04:44.488
The death of a close sibling, a sibling friend, I think it must have been absolutely devastating to Bobby.

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:46.730
They were really close.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.232
You know, they were close in age.

01:04:51.674 --> 01:04:53.355
They were playmates when they were really little.

01:04:59.574 --> 01:05:01.236
David was at Harvard with Bobby.

01:05:04.138 --> 01:05:05.719
David developed a drug addiction.

01:05:08.982 --> 01:05:12.666
Where Bobby was kind of charismatic and cool, David was really desperate.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:17.310
He used drugs with Bobby in college.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:24.125
I've heard from family friends that it was Bobby who encouraged David's drug use.

01:05:24.165 --> 01:05:31.032
In the eyes of the family, the family and classmates both felt that Bobby was a bad influence on David.

01:05:36.637 --> 01:05:37.158
Hardcore.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:09.563
I think if you talk to a lot of people who've struggled with addiction, they'll talk about the fact that they needed to hit rock bottom and realize that they have to radically change their life or they're going to die.

01:06:10.963 --> 01:06:18.045
Bobby had passed the bar, and in the years after the drug conviction, he'd gotten clean and become an environmental lawyer.

01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:27.580
Not only did he get clean at a rehab facility on the East Coast, but part of the plea deal was that he had to do community service.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:32.183
And by chance, he ended up working on a project in the Hudson Valley.

01:06:34.685 --> 01:06:38.007
Nature to me was always something that was important.

01:06:38.507 --> 01:06:43.930
It was always a place that I went to fill some emptiness inside of me.

01:06:45.171 --> 01:06:48.033
He had an amazingly precipitous fall from grace.

01:06:49.608 --> 01:06:56.012
And this period of his life when he's an environmentalist is sort of, I think, a personal redemption, a professional redemption for him.

01:06:56.132 --> 01:06:58.274
You know, he's seen as a good guy again.

01:06:59.194 --> 01:07:01.596
This pipe has had a history of violating the law.

01:07:02.276 --> 01:07:03.937
This has been going on for a long time.

01:07:03.997 --> 01:07:05.659
It is pure raw sewage.

01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:10.742
He's getting a taste of what it means to be respected as a Kennedy.

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:21.381
Because suddenly, that kind of destiny as a Kennedy to do something great, to pull the sword from the stone, to be heroic, it's like a package handed to him.

01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:25.763
He takes on the mantle of the environmentalist, and he's good at it.

01:07:26.603 --> 01:07:35.948
And if somebody dumps something into the river that goes into, that's poison, and it goes into a drinking water intake, and children drink that drinking water, that is child abuse.

01:07:38.953 --> 01:07:48.777
When I was editor of New York Magazine in the mid-'90s, you know, I put him on the cover with some headline like, this is the Kennedy that really matters.

01:07:49.677 --> 01:07:55.940
You know, OK, he's pulled his life together, and he's, oh, he's an environmental lawyer, good, oh, saving the Hudson River, I like that, great.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.721
He seemed like he's doing good work.

01:07:59.661 --> 01:08:01.462
He made other changes to his life, too.

01:08:02.503 --> 01:08:07.865
He divorced Emily Black, remarried, and started a new family with Mary Richardson.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.143
Mary Richardson had been a friend of the family since she was in high school.

01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:19.871
She went to high school with Bobby's sister, Carrie, and she had always inhaled deeply of the Kennedy mythology.

01:08:20.171 --> 01:08:21.332
She believed in the Kennedys.

01:08:21.432 --> 01:08:23.454
She wanted to be around them.

01:08:23.514 --> 01:08:24.255
She worshipped them.

01:08:25.656 --> 01:08:27.839
Mary was also from a big Irish Catholic family.

01:08:29.161 --> 01:08:36.365
A lot of people described her similarly to Ethel Kennedy, how Ethel Kennedy was described as more Kennedy than the Kennedys.

01:08:36.985 --> 01:08:46.070
Mary also really embraced the idea of being a friend of the Kennedys and eventually really loved the idea of being Bobby Kennedy's wife.

01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:48.131
They had four children.

01:08:48.351 --> 01:08:50.252
It's a weirdly weird way to say it.

01:08:50.272 --> 01:08:53.814
He loved the, she loved the idea of being Bobby Kennedy's wife.

01:08:53.854 --> 01:08:55.995
Like people just don't fall in love and stuff.

01:08:56.075 --> 01:08:56.976
It's so lame.

01:08:59.747 --> 01:09:02.068
and an estate in Westchester County, New York.

01:09:05.009 --> 01:09:06.510
He was on the gala circuit.

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:15.633
In a lot of ways, he kind of had a life that was really admirable and one to be envied.

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:18.639
It was really great.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:27.663
I was really happy for him that he had found something that was of deep interest and he seemed to excel at.

01:09:28.644 --> 01:09:32.125
We always felt that he was a very promising, talented person.

01:09:35.967 --> 01:09:36.687
Bobby Kennedy.

01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:39.028
I mean, his name was everything.

01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:46.151
I mean, if he were Randy Johnson, that person would not be famous.

01:09:46.512 --> 01:09:47.152
They just wouldn't.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:49.451
They would not get attention.

01:09:49.471 --> 01:09:57.520
— He strikes me as undeniably addicted to attention.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:04.908
— Rebecca Traister is a journalist and author who has written extensively about politics, gender, and power.

01:10:05.809 --> 01:10:08.312
She profiled Bobby Kennedy from New York magazine.

01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:11.338
It's very clear to me when I met him even.

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:20.145
You know, we have lunch and he carries himself with the air of somebody who expects people to be looking at him and paying attention to him.

01:10:20.985 --> 01:10:26.870
And he strikes me as the kind of person who has an unhealthy sense of his own importance.

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:36.677
That you can do drugs and get caught doing drugs, yet never have to face any of the consequences that somebody without your privilege has to face.

01:10:38.365 --> 01:10:44.626
and still have people want to be around you, to cover you, to publish you.

01:10:44.727 --> 01:10:46.227
Bon Jovi!

01:10:46.487 --> 01:10:58.870
Interesting, because at the start of the pandemic, I got mixed up with a music producer who was one of the members of Drastic, who was going by the name of Kevin McH.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.891
And that guy was actually Jack Ponte.

01:11:04.645 --> 01:11:08.030
And you can look Jack Ponte up on Wikipedia.

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:20.066
He started a high school band with John Bon Jovi and supposedly was a day trader that took me into his day trading group for a little while at the end of 2020.

01:11:21.829 --> 01:11:23.330
Uh, to kind of help me out.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:34.541
Um, and in that day trading group was Uri Dagan, another member of, of drastic, and he wouldn't come on my live stream for some reason that at the time I didn't understand.

01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:36.023
John Bon Jovi.

01:11:36.063 --> 01:11:37.084
That's fantastic.

01:11:39.113 --> 01:11:40.754
to ensure that you're still a public figure.

01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:52.041
Oh, and there's that picture, which is of course wonderful because that would be the direct connection to Seinfeld, to Steve Bannon, and to his third wife.

01:11:55.263 --> 01:11:59.806
I think it must give you a sense of omnipotence that is very distorting.

01:12:03.058 --> 01:12:11.547
That period of the late 90s, on the surface, it's a period of great, you know, contentment and professionally and personally for Bobby Kennedy.

01:12:12.988 --> 01:12:16.371
He has a nice home in the Hudson Valley, a beautiful wife, a nice job.

01:12:17.753 --> 01:12:22.758
But there's also a darkness to that period that kind of exists in the private realm with Kennedy.

01:12:41.912 --> 01:12:52.680
And so they've actually lured you in to have sympathy for this kid whose dad died by showing you video purportedly immediately when he heard that his dad died.

01:12:53.241 --> 01:12:56.383
Showing you video of him standing live over the coffin.

01:12:56.903 --> 01:13:03.128
And now they're trying to show you why it makes perfect sense that he would be a psychopath.

01:13:06.671 --> 01:13:09.413
Bobby Kennedy's desires found a new form.

01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:17.632
He was in a recovery from his drug addiction, but by many accounts was a sex addict.

01:13:19.734 --> 01:13:21.355
I'm not really sure that exists.

01:13:21.715 --> 01:13:22.336
I'm sorry.

01:13:23.517 --> 01:13:27.359
As a biologist and a man, I can only speak for myself.

01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:33.164
I think sex addict is kind of a dumb concept.

01:13:35.706 --> 01:13:39.188
You can like it, but it doesn't do

01:13:40.345 --> 01:13:42.546
What addictive drugs do to you?

01:13:43.226 --> 01:13:44.987
The changes aren't the same.

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:48.729
The circuitry isn't the same.

01:13:48.769 --> 01:13:51.250
And if you don't have sex, you're never going to go into withdrawal.

01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:56.132
I mean, that's the reality.

01:13:57.102 --> 01:13:59.444
So it's a stupid thing for them to say.

01:13:59.464 --> 01:14:08.492
It excuses him in a way because you should have sympathy for somebody who gets addicted to an opioid.

01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:21.563
You should have very much sympathy for them because that's a medical condition that you can't just reverse by changing your mindset or putting, you know, focusing for a few weeks.

01:14:23.134 --> 01:14:25.676
Biological changes have occurred in your brain.

01:14:25.736 --> 01:14:29.978
Chemical changes have occurred in your brain that lead to imbalance in the absence of the drug.

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.859
That can't happen with sex.

01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:35.241
And so it's just stupid.

01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:44.507
It kind of excuses the behavior and it makes it seem as though we, again, it's it, this is so malevolent because it's by design.

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:47.229
He was the center of a trap.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:53.620
that was a fake conservative populist movement in America that was part of the controlled demolition of America.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.321
And we can still pull our heads out.

01:14:55.981 --> 01:15:04.763
We can still organize with our children and plan a different future for America than the ones that these jackasses have planned for us right now.

01:15:07.944 --> 01:15:11.745
I would say the arc of his life is trading one addiction for another.

01:15:11.765 --> 01:15:13.686
Addiction.

01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:22.461
I think that word has to be, you know, seen throughout this story, starting with the heroin addiction and the addiction to sex.

01:15:23.482 --> 01:15:24.482
They're all of a piece.

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:35.525
It affected many people along the way, including a 23-year-old woman who worked in his law clinic and was the family's live-in babysitter.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.726
I was facing away from the kitchen, reaching up, getting pasta or something off the shelf.

01:15:45.647 --> 01:15:58.236
He came to the pantry, came up behind me, and I feel him and I feel his hands on the back of my hips.

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:05.222
The hands were doing the move up my skin and up the side of my body.

01:16:06.448 --> 01:16:08.909
you know, up, up, up, up, up, up.

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.471
Eliza Cooney says it was just one of a number of similar incidents.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.692
I think he was testing me.

01:16:18.492 --> 01:16:21.734
I think he was trying to see if I was interested.

01:16:23.534 --> 01:16:30.677
Maybe I was one of those people who wanted to throw myself at him, like all, you know, I don't know, throngs of adoring women.

01:16:33.518 --> 01:16:34.078
I was not.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:42.582
When Cooney went public in 2024, Kennedy said he didn't remember those moments, but apologized to her.

01:16:43.623 --> 01:16:45.783
He has since denied he did anything wrong.

01:16:47.144 --> 01:16:49.745
He is alleged to have harassed a babysitter.

01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:55.006
You know, this is not just, oh, I met a woman at a party.

01:16:55.886 --> 01:17:04.228
The entitlement that is almost surely a product of all of this, all of these endless resources and endless wells of forgiveness.

01:17:04.688 --> 01:17:13.630
It couldn't possibly be that he is the victim of a deep state operation that started with the murder of his uncle and his dad.

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.571
It couldn't possibly be that, right?

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:20.632
We just think that after they killed JFK and RFK, then those bad guys went away.

01:17:21.485 --> 01:17:21.725
Right?

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.967
And they just let the country go back to controlling itself.

01:17:25.527 --> 01:17:28.828
But when those Kennedy boys were around, we had to get rid of them.

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:36.171
Breeds the sense that you can do anything and get away with it.

01:17:37.832 --> 01:17:42.334
He came off to me as somebody who was in the bow of the boat.

01:17:44.122 --> 01:17:51.106
and he could call directions and say, I wanna do this or go here.

01:17:52.227 --> 01:17:54.408
He just got to be the bow of the boat.

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.051
He never had to worry about the wake behind him that he left.

01:18:01.173 --> 01:18:07.036
She described it as he gets to kind of call the shots and totally disregards the mess that he's uniquely capable of making.

01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:09.358
You know, there's no consequences.

01:18:11.032 --> 01:18:17.016
but the rest of the world, who are his family and his household staff, all suffer the consequences.

01:18:26.242 --> 01:18:31.385
Bobby was just having flagrant affairs in the area with people who were close to his wife.

01:18:32.866 --> 01:18:36.229
Mary Richardson, it's been reported that she was aware of his infidelities.

01:18:37.438 --> 01:18:38.578
and they drove her mad.

01:18:38.818 --> 01:18:41.979
They drove her, they made her insane with jealousy.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:51.521
People would say that he was maybe a bit of a gaslighter in their relationship, denying what was to her very obvious.

01:18:52.902 --> 01:19:03.264
Mary certainly developed her own addiction problem, but was also really distraught by, I think, the posture that Bobby had taken about his cheating.

01:19:03.885 --> 01:19:05.545
She felt gaslit by many accounts.

01:19:07.304 --> 01:19:13.372
You can imagine this isn't great for her self-esteem and isn't great for her mental state.

01:19:14.493 --> 01:19:22.624
She may have had... The one thing these people can't imagine is that the deep state or the national security state would be doing this to them.

01:19:23.766 --> 01:19:25.627
would be using the Kennedy family.

01:19:25.687 --> 01:19:40.833
They imagine that they think that JFK and RFK were killed, but I guess by either rogue actors or lone shooters or, I don't know, animal rights activists or Cuba freedom people, I don't know.

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:52.578
But I believe that we live in an America where a lot of people think that there is some big machinery, something

01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:58.093
Controlling and why is that light up?

01:20:04.856 --> 01:20:22.585
Oh Something controlling the world But most of the time it doesn't do anything or the world is controlled by I guess people that got to fly to Epstein Island or the world is controlled by the Jews and when the people get out of line they get shot and

01:20:24.943 --> 01:20:27.425
But nobody ever gives drugs to kids.

01:20:27.525 --> 01:20:33.609
Nobody ever tries to create personalities in people that they can manipulate and control.

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:35.390
There's nobody like that.

01:20:35.771 --> 01:20:39.233
We don't put people on podcasts and give them scripts to read.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:41.355
We wouldn't do anything like that.

01:20:41.975 --> 01:20:52.983
It's really just people with bad ideas, you know, grifting for 10 years as an anti-vax lawyer and getting away with it because they're so clever or so handsome.

01:20:58.584 --> 01:21:07.390
depression and challenges that predated her marriage to Kennedy, but they certainly weren't helped by being married to him.

01:21:09.051 --> 01:21:12.533
They eventually separated, and he filed for divorce.

01:21:18.858 --> 01:21:20.399
What kind of music is this?

01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:28.822
another tragedy to strike the Kennedy family.

01:21:28.962 --> 01:21:34.704
Mary Kennedy, the mother of four children of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been found dead.

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:39.726
Police in Bedford, New York, confirmed they found a body on Kennedy's property Wednesday afternoon.

01:21:39.886 --> 01:21:44.067
Mary Kennedy's body was found hanging in the barn in the back of the house.

01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:46.948
She hangs herself.

01:21:49.069 --> 01:21:50.569
This is the mother of four of his children.

01:21:50.589 --> 01:21:51.850
It's an incredibly

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.651
tragic moment privately.

01:21:55.431 --> 01:22:20.888
It's an incredibly dumb story because it's hard for me to imagine that no matter what I did, no matter what I did, no matter what I did, listen to me very carefully, no matter what I did, no matter how many women I slept with and how many times I lied about it, my wife would not kill herself and leave our three kids alone with me.

01:22:22.611 --> 01:22:23.752
Are you freaking nuts?

01:22:24.733 --> 01:22:26.495
That doesn't even make any sense.

01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:38.027
It doesn't make any sense.

01:22:39.744 --> 01:22:43.687
And yet these ladies are telling us this story like it makes sense.

01:22:43.747 --> 01:22:47.689
Just like, you know, it makes sense that I totally understand why he thinks the way he thinks.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.411
I totally understand why he's got this big ego.

01:22:50.751 --> 01:22:52.172
I totally understand everything.

01:22:52.512 --> 01:22:57.856
And I totally understand why a mom of four kids in an incredibly rich family would kill herself.

01:22:59.937 --> 01:23:01.478
That's so stupid.

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:15.695
This is an extremely dark moment for Bobby and very disturbing for his family and friends.

01:23:18.798 --> 01:23:24.201
The Richardson family is so angry and horrified by this event, and they blame Bobby.

01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:38.131
Her death, I think, marks this moment where he stops being a... Ian, what should we do besides try to get the word out in America that we are the victims of an elaborate theater?

01:23:40.020 --> 01:24:00.568
At this stage right now, America still believes that there are good guys and bad guys that are fighting with each other, and some of them are on one side, and some of them are on the other, and some of them understand, and some of them don't, some of them might get convinced later, some of them might never wake up, and all of them that need to be are controlled by people that used to go to Epstein Island.

01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:03.669
So what should we do right now, Ian?

01:24:04.602 --> 01:24:30.881
If we all agree that this guy is a stooge, we all agree that it's been an elaborate hoax for decades now, and we all agree that we're being converted from sovereign individuals to experimental animals for the Human Genome Project goals, because there's only going to be this amount of human diversity available for scientific investigation for another two generations or so, and then the population of the world will have decreased by a factor of 10,

01:24:31.701 --> 01:24:35.244
and they will have lost this opportunity for many millennia to come.

01:24:36.845 --> 01:24:39.247
What should we do to avoid this problem?

01:24:39.287 --> 01:24:41.528
We can't really avoid the problem.

01:24:41.928 --> 01:24:54.558
The only thing we can do is really teach our children where we are with regard to the population pyramid, where we are with regard to the transition to this new world order that these people are doing, and not do it!

01:24:56.059 --> 01:25:00.502
Our biggest solution to this problem, Ian, is to get off of social media.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.642
Watch my videos on my own app.

01:25:04.742 --> 01:25:06.904
Watch my videos on my website.

01:25:07.004 --> 01:25:10.827
Watch other people's videos on their website and get off of social media.

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:23.757
All of it, all of corporate social media is just military programs and you using them is how they're going to rule us and how they will rule our children.

01:25:23.837 --> 01:25:27.980
So we need to leave social media and our children need to leave with social media.

01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:30.883
And then this jackass wouldn't be anybody.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:40.670
The only reason why he's anybody is because social media was used in a military fashion from 2020 to put him in front of as many people as possible.

01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:55.844
Kennedy watchers say the Richardson family feels Robert Kennedy didn't do enough to help Mary.

01:25:56.305 --> 01:26:02.150
And photos like this of Robert and actress Cheryl Hines, the two reportedly dating, didn't help.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:09.617
Just days after the shocking death of Mary Richardson Kennedy, both sides of that family are now embroiled in a feud.

01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:26.618
It was her death and the public response to it, and her family's response to it, and then the publication of the quote-unquote sex diary shortly after marked a change in his public persona or the perception of who Bobby Kennedy is.

01:26:27.939 --> 01:26:32.042
A diary allegedly obtained by the New York Post reveals that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:26:32.122 --> 01:26:34.424
had dozens of affairs during his marriage.

01:26:35.194 --> 01:26:43.556
A copy of the 398 pages reviewed by the Post record the names of women, with numbers from 1 to 10 next to each entry.

01:26:44.316 --> 01:26:48.417
The codes corresponded to sexual acts, with 10 meaning intercourse.

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:57.139
It was a very personal account of some of his philandering, I guess you'd say, if you want to call it that.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:27:00.200
His relationships with other women besides Mary.

01:27:01.604 --> 01:27:06.288
There are 37 women named in the ledger, 16 of whom get tens.

01:27:07.449 --> 01:27:10.732
On November 13, 2001, RFK Jr.

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:11.973
records a triple play.

01:27:12.914 --> 01:27:21.361
The separate encounters, coded 10, 3, and 2, occur the same day he attended a black tie fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria.

01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:25.425
He writes about all the women who he'd slept with.

01:27:26.701 --> 01:27:29.182
The way he writes about them is that they mugged him.

01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:35.326
No, I think your chat is being curated because the only people that show up here are the real people that are left.

01:27:35.566 --> 01:27:40.149
I used to have sometimes as many as a hundred people on a stream, but a lot of them were jackasses.

01:27:40.869 --> 01:27:45.752
I think everybody that I can see here right now, I don't recognize ArsDivina06.

01:27:47.673 --> 01:27:49.595
No offense, but I don't recognize that one.

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:51.536
I do recognize Ian to the fray though.

01:27:51.556 --> 01:27:52.957
You've been here quite a few times.

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:53.657
I know who you are.

01:27:54.675 --> 01:27:58.339
that they, he was helpless, he was passive.

01:27:58.919 --> 01:28:00.340
This was something that was happening to him.

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:15.474
He has a tremendous victim complex and cannot seem to take responsibility for any of his own behaviors.

01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:25.005
Decades later, Kennedy talked about the journal on a podcast, why he wrote it, and what he says Mary did with it.

01:28:25.939 --> 01:28:28.941
the journal that you're talking about was called Your Fifth Step.

01:28:29.682 --> 01:28:32.804
It was part of my recovery.

01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:42.150
Newspapers reported that to make it look like it was keeping a kind of notches on the trigger.

01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:43.451
That's not what it was.

01:28:43.471 --> 01:28:53.097
It was my own way of trying to live an examined life and struggling with an issue that I was struggling with at that time.

01:28:53.137 --> 01:28:53.958
And I kept that.

01:28:54.987 --> 01:29:04.410
fifth step in a safe and somehow got in her, in the place that where she was.

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:15.534
She put a lot of effort into getting that safe open and then handing that to her sisters with instruction that if anything happened to her, it should be published in the press.

01:29:16.414 --> 01:29:18.835
And then shortly after that, she took her own life.

01:29:22.443 --> 01:29:24.464
I still don't think that really makes a lot of sense.

01:29:24.724 --> 01:29:28.366
I don't think if anything happens to me, publish that.

01:29:29.487 --> 01:29:33.749
And then I'm going to kill myself and leave my four kids with that monster man.

01:29:33.769 --> 01:29:36.690
It just doesn't really make much sense to me.

01:29:37.891 --> 01:29:45.014
And the more that there is a diary than the, in my mind, the more it would mean that you didn't have anything to begin with.

01:29:45.054 --> 01:29:48.916
It would mean that, you know, you're, yes, you were wrong.

01:29:48.996 --> 01:29:52.078
You hoped you had more with your husband than you did.

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:57.473
But like, I don't know.

01:29:57.573 --> 01:29:59.495
I just, it doesn't add up for me at all.

01:29:59.555 --> 01:30:00.295
It doesn't add up.

01:30:00.355 --> 01:30:13.784
And the fact that all of these people are being put together and edited together to make me believe and make everybody believe that it does add up, it adds up very convincingly to a psychopath is pretty impressive.

01:30:14.205 --> 01:30:20.129
Um, Hmm.

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.090
It's pretty impressive.

01:30:35.045 --> 01:30:37.106
Hey, Ian to the fray, what are you going to do?

01:30:37.166 --> 01:30:38.566
I'm just curious about that.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.927
Like, uh, what are your plans?

01:30:40.967 --> 01:30:41.627
What are you going to do?

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:43.127
I'm actually writing two books.

01:30:43.307 --> 01:30:48.388
I'm writing a children's book and I'm writing a biology 101 textbook, which is a lot of work.

01:30:49.248 --> 01:30:51.869
Um, and it's not something you can really do online right now.

01:30:51.909 --> 01:30:54.390
It's certainly not something you would ever want to do on Substack.

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:55.930
I'm just wondering what you're doing.

01:30:56.930 --> 01:31:03.033
It seems like you're kind of here trying to convince people that what we're doing is wasting our time.

01:31:03.153 --> 01:31:11.936
But right now, what we're trying to do is figure out how we can establish an alternative to social media, which isn't out there right now.

01:31:12.457 --> 01:31:14.677
There is no alternative to social media.

01:31:14.798 --> 01:31:18.719
If you're on Twitch, then you're still on social media.

01:31:18.759 --> 01:31:23.161
You're not on PeerTube, which means your data is still being collected.

01:31:23.201 --> 01:31:25.202
Your IP address is still being used.

01:31:25.942 --> 01:31:31.148
And the fact that you're watching me is being logged because they log everybody that watches this show.

01:31:31.608 --> 01:31:35.472
It's one of the only shows that actually has some grasp of the truth.

01:31:37.094 --> 01:31:39.336
And that's really the reality of it.

01:31:39.376 --> 01:31:47.144
It's not very easy to take action when most of this apparatus has been aimed at our little club for the last five years.

01:31:47.164 --> 01:31:48.565
We're the only club that matters.

01:31:49.326 --> 01:31:52.948
Or the only club that it's been even remotely right for the last five years.

01:31:53.128 --> 01:31:57.711
Every other club that you could have possibly stumbled on is fully on a script.

01:31:58.151 --> 01:32:00.052
They tried, you see?

01:32:01.733 --> 01:32:06.156
They tried to get me on a script to the point where they put me in this book.

01:32:07.177 --> 01:32:14.541
Even though I taught everybody during the writing of the book that a gain-of-function virus is a stupid biological myth.

01:32:16.502 --> 01:32:19.443
They really tried, Ian, you understand that, right?

01:32:19.463 --> 01:32:30.847
So we're standing here right now with that guy as HHS secretary, me in his book, and even the PBS NewsHour doesn't seem to see that as a story.

01:32:31.287 --> 01:32:39.510
Instead, they see a story as being trying to explain to you how this egomaniac is now endangering our public health system.

01:32:40.558 --> 01:32:49.501
You know, like the national security script that's been using him for at least the last 15 years had always intended to use him as.

01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:56.503
The one that this book admits that's the plan all along.

01:32:57.401 --> 01:33:00.122
Because in this book and this epilogue, they actually tell it.

01:33:00.162 --> 01:33:02.382
So what am I doing for an action right now?

01:33:02.902 --> 01:33:14.585
I'm making a video that you can share with whoever you want to all around the earth that actually contains the literal truth of American history.

01:33:15.405 --> 01:33:17.366
What are you doing, Ian?

01:33:18.186 --> 01:33:26.908
Because a few of us are actually cataloging, archiving, and bringing to light real American history.

01:33:33.717 --> 01:33:38.099
Kicking ass is what I'm doing, and taking names, that's what I'm doing.

01:33:51.046 --> 01:33:53.068
Pretty soon after, Mary dies.

01:33:54.147 --> 01:34:01.332
Bobby kind of packs up his East Coast life, where he's been for his whole life up until then, and he moves to California.

01:34:01.832 --> 01:34:04.353
You don't have a solution, you can't type it in.

01:34:05.034 --> 01:34:06.375
You're full of shit, Ian.

01:34:06.495 --> 01:34:08.116
There are very simple solutions.

01:34:08.196 --> 01:34:11.678
Teach the real biology to children, which I'm working on doing.

01:34:12.158 --> 01:34:15.420
Teach the real biology to adults, which I'm working on doing.

01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:22.125
If your solution is so amazing, type it into the chat and let us fix the world.

01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:26.893
You see, I think my solutions for teaching biology are really simple.

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:32.877
I start every single stream with them, and not one biologist on earth will touch them.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:36.199
So again, type it in the chat.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.381
Scare us with your genius.

01:34:38.441 --> 01:34:39.342
We'll keep watching.

01:34:41.323 --> 01:34:43.345
He moves in to Sheryl Hines' world.

01:34:44.886 --> 01:34:50.650
He'd begun dating his third wife, television star Sheryl Hines, toward the end of his marriage to Mary.

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.120
And it's sort of a fresh start for him.

01:34:54.940 --> 01:35:02.323
He's distanced himself from all the tragedy and all the mess that he's made back east, and he hits the reset button.

01:35:03.663 --> 01:35:08.825
But he arrives with this new path that he's on now, which is the anti-vax movement.

01:35:09.666 --> 01:35:13.267
He was writing a book about vaccines and the dangers of mercury.

01:35:14.412 --> 01:35:22.815
Ian still hasn't typed jack shit in the comments, again because he's not dealing with the reality here.

01:35:24.596 --> 01:35:32.279
The reality is that this is the one place on the internet where the truth is available and either you can see it or you can't.

01:35:33.399 --> 01:35:37.921
The message is for anyone, but it's not for everyone, Ian.

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.642
It might just be over your head.

01:35:40.442 --> 01:35:52.369
It might just be too big of an idea for you to comprehend, or you might just be a jackass working for these people, trying desperately to disrupt what's definitely going to happen.

01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:58.953
The Cooey family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is going to bring Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:02.576
and the health freedom movement in America to its knees.

01:36:03.482 --> 01:36:04.863
Because they are frauds.

01:36:04.943 --> 01:36:06.724
Because Brian Hooker's a fraud.

01:36:07.224 --> 01:36:08.825
Because Mary Holland's a fraud.

01:36:08.885 --> 01:36:10.526
Because Meryl Nass is a fraud.

01:36:10.566 --> 01:36:12.047
Because Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:36:12.087 --> 01:36:12.948
is a dipshit.

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:16.550
And because all of these people belong in jail.

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:19.832
Kevin McKernan is my favorite of them.

01:36:20.392 --> 01:36:23.194
I can't wait until I finally see him in person.

01:36:23.234 --> 01:36:24.795
I don't know where I'm gonna start.

01:36:30.338 --> 01:36:32.940
An issue he'd started learning about years before.

01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:38.512
He was traveling around the country doing speeches and interviews about mercury in fish.

01:36:39.313 --> 01:36:54.041
Mercury, we now know, has saturated the bodies of one out of every six American women of childbearing years to such an extent that their children are at risk for permanent IQ loss and a grim inventory of other diseases, kidney and liver disease, autism, blindness.

01:36:54.941 --> 01:37:03.486
And in the audience, there would be women waiting to talk to him who all wanted to talk about mercury in vaccines because they felt their children had been adversely affected.

01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:08.614
We really needed somebody to be a spokesperson for us.

01:37:09.955 --> 01:37:11.376
Our children had no voices.

01:37:12.056 --> 01:37:17.619
I just thought that Mr. Kennedy would be a perfect person because he knew what mercury was about.

01:37:18.639 --> 01:37:26.903
So Lynn Redwood is even going to come on here and tell us that, well, you know, I mean, I kind of tried to help him too.

01:37:27.743 --> 01:37:32.906
Lynn Redwood was also autism, but now her mercury's coming from the water or something, you see.

01:37:35.205 --> 01:37:41.827
It's not that all of these people have to be winning participants, but Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:37:41.907 --> 01:37:43.627
is a scripted stooge.

01:37:44.968 --> 01:37:57.451
A combination of substance abuse and, and physical abuse and mental abuse and, and lots of lying people around him has resulted in him being a national security asset.

01:37:58.131 --> 01:38:03.773
He is an actor given a script that he trusts and has trusted for years.

01:38:06.269 --> 01:38:09.611
I don't think this is the mastermind.

01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:19.796
I don't think that the reason why he's so successful is because he's so charming or his blue eyes are so beautiful or his vocabulary is so wide.

01:38:21.256 --> 01:38:30.621
He's able to get away with everything he's able to get away with because he has been a national security asset since they killed his dad.

01:38:32.642 --> 01:38:34.683
That's the only thing to assume.

01:38:37.677 --> 01:38:41.620
And so what are we arguing about here other than who does he play for?

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.001
And he's not playing for us.

01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:44.602
That's the simple truth.

01:38:45.983 --> 01:38:48.765
Just like Donald Trump doesn't play for us.

01:38:49.365 --> 01:38:51.727
Donald Trump is a national security actor.

01:38:52.487 --> 01:38:54.389
Just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:38:55.009 --> 01:38:56.690
Just like Jay Bhattacharya.

01:38:58.231 --> 01:38:59.632
Just like Marty McCary.

01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:01.674
America has been sabotaged.

01:39:04.392 --> 01:39:18.800
A conservative populist movement in America was artificially created so that it could be sabotaged by the buffoonery and failure of Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.122
What do you think is going on in Israel right now?

01:39:21.222 --> 01:39:21.582
Peace?

01:39:22.142 --> 01:39:22.963
Prosperity?

01:39:23.503 --> 01:39:28.326
New hotels being built and casinos in Gaza and jobs for everybody?

01:39:34.938 --> 01:39:38.699
Son Will showed signs of autism after his first birthday.

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:45.482
She ran a group of moms and dads whose children also had autism and wanted to recruit Kennedy to their cause.

01:39:46.402 --> 01:39:49.963
We didn't come across as being crazy tinfoil hat-wearing people.

01:39:51.404 --> 01:39:52.564
And he believed us.

01:39:52.664 --> 01:39:56.526
He listened to us when other people were gaslighting us.

01:39:58.260 --> 01:39:59.501
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:39:59.561 --> 01:40:09.231
is lending the famous family name to a new cause, the idea that something in vaccines triggered the autism and ADD epidemics.

01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:14.455
It was a role that he took on full well knowing that it was going to be unpopular.

01:40:14.956 --> 01:40:16.958
And he did not have a dog in this fight at all.

01:40:16.998 --> 01:40:19.500
He did not have a child that was injured.

01:40:20.141 --> 01:40:22.863
And that even meant so much more to us.

01:40:23.553 --> 01:40:28.761
I was skeptical but sympathetic because, you know, these are people who've been through hell, literally.

01:40:29.202 --> 01:40:33.228
After researching studies on both sides, Kennedy became a believer.

01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:38.016
You know, there were still things that I hadn't quite figured out about him.

01:40:39.051 --> 01:40:45.698
And when I read this passage of the book that he wrote, American Values, I was like, okay, this nails it.

01:40:45.898 --> 01:40:58.510
So he says, from my youngest days, I always had the feeling that we were all involved in some great crusade, that the world was a battleground for good and evil, and that our lives would be consumed in that conflict.

01:40:59.311 --> 01:41:03.235
It would be my good fortune if I could play an important or heroic role.

01:41:04.631 --> 01:41:09.253
The next sentence says that it would be rooted in his Catholic faith, but that's okay.

01:41:09.273 --> 01:41:10.653
They can blank that out, I guess.

01:41:12.514 --> 01:41:15.995
So that's why he does this.

01:41:16.396 --> 01:41:22.638
I mean, he really feels this obligation to be able to make this world a better place.

01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:27.740
To spread the word, he used his celebrity connections.

01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:37.894
Bobby knows the publisher of Rolling Stone, Jan Wenner, a sort of notorious celebrity-struck guy in publishing.

01:41:39.336 --> 01:41:43.342
And Bobby writes a article for Rolling Stone called Deadly Immunity.

01:41:44.232 --> 01:41:50.154
Kennedy made his case in a 4,700 word article in Rolling Stone and online at Salon.

01:41:51.394 --> 01:41:58.336
A mercury-based preservative in the vaccines by Marisol appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism.

01:41:58.836 --> 01:42:09.940
And so we're supposed to believe, we're supposed to believe that Steve Kirsch and Pierre Cory, the hero of the George Floyd trial and also the hero of supplementary oxygen in New York in 2020,

01:42:11.587 --> 01:42:18.392
got on stage this year in New York City and argued that thimerosal was the cause of autism.

01:42:22.195 --> 01:42:33.724
The same argument, of course, that he made in, this guy made in Rolling Stone, and the same that would be discredited by Paul Offit.

01:42:34.304 --> 01:42:36.126
The same story.

01:42:37.047 --> 01:42:41.210
Like, what, how is it possible that we've made no progress, that Pierre Khoury

01:42:42.386 --> 01:42:44.648
got on stage and argued the same shit.

01:42:46.889 --> 01:42:51.192
And was dunked on because of course thimerosal was removed from all the vaccines.

01:42:51.253 --> 01:42:54.015
I mean, it is remarkable.

01:42:54.515 --> 01:42:56.616
There's no progress on PBS NewsHour.

01:42:56.656 --> 01:43:00.279
They're just repeating the same story that we've been told for the last 10 years.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.941
Disorders among children.

01:43:04.222 --> 01:43:08.005
When he starts on the vaccine stuff, you know, he's basically saying,

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:10.064
every American.

01:43:10.104 --> 01:43:13.747
See this guy is the New York Review of Books.

01:43:13.927 --> 01:43:20.652
So who the hell is this guy to be talking about the psychological state of a person after a trauma?

01:43:21.093 --> 01:43:26.157
Who's he to be waxing intellectual about most of the things that they've been asking him about now?

01:43:26.797 --> 01:43:28.799
It is freaking ridiculous.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.163
That's how awful this military exercise is.

01:43:34.183 --> 01:43:38.167
A child is being poisoned.

01:43:40.055 --> 01:43:45.498
If this is true, it's the worst conspiracy that the world has ever seen.

01:43:46.819 --> 01:43:49.841
To secretly poison every single child in America.

01:43:52.382 --> 01:43:56.025
His tragedy, in a way, is that he's already... But he's not wrong there, right?

01:43:56.325 --> 01:43:58.986
This is the argument that we've been making for some time.

01:43:59.046 --> 01:44:06.351
If you actually believed for 25 years that the vaccine schedule in America was a criminal...

01:44:07.393 --> 01:44:30.791
enterprise and all you did was what these people have done and all the progress in your messaging and in your ability to teach the reasoning behind your stance doesn't progress for 20 years that's because you're on a military national security script it's not because you're real if you're

01:44:31.656 --> 01:44:49.931
bumbling between mercury in fish and mercury in vaccines and other stuff in vaccines and maybe it's aluminum and maybe it's not that kind of mercury and maybe it's the bad food and the processed food if that's the way you're fighting then you don't believe what you said you believed

01:44:52.247 --> 01:45:10.131
Like, for example, if you thought that all the kids in America were being poisoned by vaccines and you equated it to, say, I don't know, Nazi death camps, then you should take some pretty harsh stance and take some pretty drastic action at some point in your life, right?

01:45:11.452 --> 01:45:21.094
Be pre-prepared by his terrible experiences as a child for this idea that

01:45:22.839 --> 01:45:27.181
Everything must be explicable by dark forces.

01:45:28.882 --> 01:45:31.904
I believe that this is a moral crisis that must be addressed.

01:45:32.684 --> 01:45:48.133
If, as the evidence suggests, our public health authorities knowingly allowed the pharmaceutical industry to poison an entire generation of American children, their actions arguably constitute one of the biggest scandals in the annals of American medicine.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:58.166
He has to embody somehow this savior complex, you know, that he's someone who can save the world from all of these dark forces.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:13.535
He is the only person who can really understand all these forces, who can really articulate what's going on, and who can engage in this apocalyptic struggle.

01:46:14.796 --> 01:46:18.779
The reaction from the scientific community was immediate and forceful.

01:46:20.293 --> 01:46:24.997
I called the editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone and said, here's a list of the misstatements of fact.

01:46:25.037 --> 01:46:27.499
Why didn't they at least let him clean his glasses?

01:46:27.579 --> 01:46:28.980
I mean, this is just sad.

01:46:30.641 --> 01:46:40.749
Dr. Paul Offit is a world-renowned scientist, an inventor of a rotavirus vaccine, and someone who Kennedy accused of being part of a vaccine conspiracy.

01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:45.793
You are not at greater risk of developing autism if you got that vaccine or if you didn't.

01:46:46.293 --> 01:46:47.574
But Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:46:47.614 --> 01:46:48.495
still doesn't believe it.

01:46:50.302 --> 01:46:50.962
Here's what he does.

01:46:51.703 --> 01:46:56.486
He either quotes studies that don't exist, or he misrepresents the studies that do.

01:46:57.467 --> 01:47:01.930
He has this religious belief that vaccines are doing harm, period.

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:07.213
And it doesn't matter what you say to him scientifically to show that he's wrong, he will not believe you.

01:47:09.535 --> 01:47:13.938
For almost six years, Kennedy did battle with the scientists over the article.

01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:21.220
The science exonerating thimerosal is weak, it's flimsy, and it's phony.

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.161
It's fraudulent.

01:47:22.581 --> 01:47:27.602
We have the guys who are supposed to be protecting Americans' health, who are actually conspiring.

01:47:27.722 --> 01:47:36.724
OK, so again, what we're supposed to believe is because he's a Kennedy, he's able to get on the news and say stupid shit.

01:47:37.164 --> 01:47:43.505
Because he's a Kennedy, he's able to raise millions of dollars and continue to say stupid shit.

01:47:44.245 --> 01:47:50.951
And in fact, because he's a Kennedy and he can get away with it, he's able to run for president saying stupid shit.

01:47:52.052 --> 01:48:06.364
And Paul Offit, no matter how stupid that stuff is, he can't do anything about it because, you know, I guess he's just that handsome or he's just that persuasive because no matter what you say, he believes it.

01:48:07.549 --> 01:48:07.809
No.

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:13.811
No matter what you say, all the people behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:48:13.871 --> 01:48:14.491
believe him.

01:48:15.111 --> 01:48:31.095
So again, this is a very convenient bullshit story which seems to suggest that Paul Offit has been on a crusade to prove to the world that this guy is full of shit for 15 years and he has failed.

01:48:31.835 --> 01:48:40.103
to the extent to which this guy has succeeded to getting all the way to HHS secretary.

01:48:42.325 --> 01:48:51.213
And I guess it's because of a perfect storm of a stupid shit Donald Trump and a really handsome and persuasive Kennedy kid.

01:48:52.254 --> 01:48:52.515
Right?

01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:54.436
That's what we're supposed to believe.

01:48:54.496 --> 01:48:56.779
It couldn't possibly be by design.

01:48:58.919 --> 01:49:02.826
You know that he was able to have 16 years of cocaine and drugs?

01:49:03.647 --> 01:49:06.913
That his mother of four killed herself?

01:49:09.824 --> 01:49:23.950
that he's now married to an actress that's connected to Steve Bannon and Larry David, and that there's a book from Sky Horse Publishing that suggests that he would run as an independent candidate and then get taken as vice president.

01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:30.172
And there are videos of these jackasses suggesting that to Donald Trump before the shooting.

01:49:33.814 --> 01:49:34.754
Like Brett Weinstein.

01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:40.315
Like Aaron Siri, like these other people.

01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:44.922
You don't think that's the plan?

01:49:46.784 --> 01:50:11.777
Mary Holland from Children's Health Defense actually left Children's Health Defense to be the general manager of his presidential campaign because, you know, Children's Health Defense is such an important organization and I'm so proud that I put my life into it that I've decided to ditch it for a year and go work for Robert F. Kennedy's campaign right until they hired Jonathan Couey and then I decided I had to come back and fire him.

01:50:14.713 --> 01:50:17.074
Where is Laura Bono in this video?

01:50:17.134 --> 01:50:29.661
Laura Bono is the one who sat outside of his house with papers about vaccines and and and begged him to to come to their not not Lynn Redwood

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:36.401
And the co-founder of CHD is supposed to be Laura Bono.

01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:37.042
Where is she?

01:50:37.822 --> 01:50:42.584
She was forced to retire by, by Mary Holland when I was there, as far as I understand.

01:50:43.044 --> 01:50:49.386
Look, like it or not, America is under attack, but it's not under attack in the way that you imagine.

01:50:49.586 --> 01:50:56.029
America is under attack by an elaborate hoax that involves Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Aaron Siri.

01:50:58.343 --> 01:51:08.786
and Matt Taibbi and the Weinstein brothers and their dad who's connected directly to Estes Kefauver and the FDA and thimerosal for the love of goodness.

01:51:12.881 --> 01:51:14.862
You know that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:31.168
's dad, Robert F. Kennedy, was involved in the formation of the FDA with Brett Weinstein and Eric Weinstein's dad, Les Weinstein, and with Estes Kefauver, who died in the Senate floor about three weeks before John F. Kennedy was shot.

01:51:31.648 --> 01:51:36.170
Do we understand that real American history is here right now for the taking?

01:51:39.306 --> 01:51:40.727
And now there's a movement.

01:51:41.568 --> 01:51:43.630
And that's what Bobby Kennedy Jr.

01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:43.870
wants.

01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:47.913
He wants to be the head of a new kind of movement that makes him look heroic.

01:51:48.234 --> 01:51:51.697
These mothers know what made their child sick.

01:51:57.382 --> 01:52:02.346
Green the Vaccines was the campaign that was being run by Jim Carrey and

01:52:07.063 --> 01:52:12.284
And, uh, why can't I come up with her name anyway?

01:52:12.324 --> 01:52:13.245
You know who I'm talking about.

01:52:13.285 --> 01:52:17.286
— Coming up to the plate and correcting an error, even if it is five years late.

01:52:17.306 --> 01:52:24.428
— Then, Salon stunned Kennedy by taking the extraordinary step of retracting his entire story.

01:52:25.248 --> 01:52:26.588
The scientists had won.

01:52:26.608 --> 01:52:31.710
— We've grown to believe the best reader's service is to delete the piece entirely.

01:52:31.730 --> 01:52:36.151
— That piece was discredited by the time it was pulled down.

01:52:37.606 --> 01:52:41.409
Boy, I don't think I could spend 15 minutes in a room with this woman.

01:52:41.529 --> 01:52:42.570
Whoa, yeesh.

01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:45.052
It wasn't just a thing that happened to him.

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:48.374
It was because he made mistakes in his reporting.

01:52:49.335 --> 01:52:56.941
Continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science behind the connection make taking down the story the right thing to do.

01:52:58.831 --> 01:53:06.437
if you have lived decades on this earth and enjoyed relatively unchallenged access to power and adulation.

01:53:06.557 --> 01:53:11.281
She keeps on repeating how much she hates this rich boy.

01:53:11.301 --> 01:53:12.802
It is really silly.

01:53:14.824 --> 01:53:18.727
And then you experience what is fundamentally a consequence of his error.

01:53:19.868 --> 01:53:22.670
It feels like, help, I'm being oppressed.

01:53:24.298 --> 01:53:35.621
Because if all you've had is access and entitlement and power, then anything short of access and power feels like persecution and oppression.

01:53:36.601 --> 01:53:37.341
It's weird, right?

01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:38.401
It's really weird.

01:53:38.441 --> 01:53:41.422
It's almost like she has no sympathy at all for him anymore.

01:53:41.762 --> 01:53:51.825
It's a strange place because they are completely ignoring the fact that we don't have a good explanation for why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:53:51.845 --> 01:53:53.065
and John F. Kennedy Jr.

01:53:53.085 --> 01:53:53.625
were shot.

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:56.874
We don't have a good explanation for that.

01:53:58.715 --> 01:54:04.977
And so we're just supposed to say that this is a kid who's from a rich family whose parents were killed.

01:54:05.377 --> 01:54:14.679
We're not supposed to talk about the fact that there are conspiracy theories and books that line shelves about why they were killed.

01:54:19.141 --> 01:54:19.901
It's remarkable.

01:54:20.861 --> 01:54:23.702
Kennedy, unapologetic, lashed out.

01:54:24.844 --> 01:54:26.945
It's like Nazi death camps, but

01:54:43.991 --> 01:54:50.012
It's like Nazi death camps, but I'm also concerned about getting the dyes out of Froot Loops.

01:54:50.072 --> 01:54:54.994
I'm also concerned about, you know, the RNA for other things.

01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:59.895
I'm also concerned this is just a scripted national security actor.

01:55:00.355 --> 01:55:04.736
If you try to explain it by saying that he's a guy with feelings,

01:55:05.476 --> 01:55:19.884
or he's a guy with sex addiction, or he's a guy who's complicated, or he's a guy who's got a lot of emotional value, you know, or whatever words you want to use to describe him, then you're not going to get it right.

01:55:20.705 --> 01:55:31.211
Because he's just an actor, a national security actor who will say and adjust what his script is in his head as instructed.

01:55:33.533 --> 01:55:36.316
It has nothing to do with the people that show up.

01:55:37.417 --> 01:55:39.318
It has nothing to do with getting laid.

01:55:40.619 --> 01:55:46.345
It has to do with doing what he has been told to do, showing up where he's told to show up.

01:55:46.925 --> 01:55:56.434
And that all the people that are told to be there, meant to be there, brought to be there are there because it's a national security exercise.

01:55:56.494 --> 01:55:59.937
And he has been a national security exercise for quite some time.

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:13.693
When you're faced with having made outrageous claims and having got enormous publicity for them because of who you are, and then, you know, it just becomes obvious.

01:56:13.793 --> 01:56:20.220
If you believe the vaccine schedule is Nazi death camps, then you have to take more action than he's taken.

01:56:22.482 --> 01:56:23.563
That's the reality of it.

01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:34.422
It's that you're either lying or you're deluded, what you're claiming is just not true.

01:56:35.322 --> 01:56:36.683
There's only two ways you can go.

01:56:38.604 --> 01:56:44.586
One is you completely lose face and credibility and you just kind of retire into private life.

01:56:46.047 --> 01:56:50.009
And the other way is to double down, which is what he does.

01:56:54.898 --> 01:56:57.019
Bobby Kennedy would do that in L.A.

01:56:57.079 --> 01:57:02.260
in 2014, with that book he'd been writing to push back against the salon retraction.

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:12.143
— By the time that I met him, he was really having trouble getting his voice— — Tony Lyons, the guy who published this book right here.

01:57:13.894 --> 01:57:21.899
Skyhorse publishing president, this book right here, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, the epilogue describes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:21.959 --> 01:57:35.668
running as an independent and getting taken as the vice presidential candidate of the Republican candidate, then the Republican candidate getting shot right after the election so that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:57:35.708 --> 01:57:37.929
can become president and save America.

01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:40.551
That's in this fricking Skyhorse book from 2008.

01:57:48.803 --> 01:57:51.786
How is this guy in a PBS NewsHour show?

01:57:53.928 --> 01:58:01.415
Unless it's all one malevolent national security script.

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:06.319
Tony Lyons agreed to publish the book about thimerosal and vaccines.

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:09.282
He was soon swept into the controversy.

01:58:10.236 --> 01:58:15.759
We tried to place ads for that book, and people just simply wouldn't take them.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:30.168
Any book or any statement or any person who questioned any ingredient in any vaccine under any circumstances was a dangerous anti-vaxxer who was going to hurt children.

01:58:31.389 --> 01:58:36.632
Kennedy may deeply believe the rubbish he's peddling, but science doesn't care about your sincerity.

01:58:36.972 --> 01:58:38.133
It cares about the facts.

01:58:39.096 --> 01:58:47.926
The real threat to kids isn't some imagined conspiracy, but Robert Kennedy's promotion of... So here is PBS NewsHour using AI-generated voices.

01:58:48.106 --> 01:58:48.666
Why?

01:58:48.766 --> 01:58:54.132
Well, because they're part of the show, because they want you to be conditioned to AI voices.

01:58:54.212 --> 01:58:58.457
And so they're not going to employ real people to read things when

01:58:59.157 --> 01:59:10.788
that when the gay space vampire Peter Thiel wants them to focus on Substack and focus on X and focus on AI being a kind of foregone conclusion.

01:59:11.288 --> 01:59:14.411
So of course they use AI voices to read this shit.

01:59:15.131 --> 01:59:16.693
That's the malevolence.

01:59:18.594 --> 01:59:19.976
Dangerous pseudoscience.

01:59:20.936 --> 01:59:26.461
He goes from being an absolute media darling to the worst person who ever existed.

01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:32.546
If you're looking for proof that smarts can skip a generation, look no further than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:33.287 --> 01:59:35.409
It's sad to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:59:35.449 --> 01:59:37.891
attach his great name to dangerous nonsense.

01:59:38.811 --> 01:59:42.695
Unfortunately, there's no vaccine for irresponsible stupidity.

01:59:44.719 --> 01:59:50.723
with one simple choice to write a book about mercury in childhood vaccines.

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:52.945
He was suddenly in the wilderness.

01:59:53.325 --> 01:59:54.666
He was persona non grata.

01:59:54.706 --> 01:59:55.807
He was excommunicated.

01:59:56.533 --> 02:00:01.796
Gavin DeBecker runs one of the nation's leading protection and security firms, working with the U.S.

02:00:01.836 --> 02:00:14.942
government, celebrities... So it sounds like that The Truman Show might be run by this jackass, because they're giving him lots of props, they're giving him like he's the cool guy, and he's giving us an insight into him.

02:00:15.882 --> 02:00:17.323
It's pretty remarkable, isn't it?

02:00:19.044 --> 02:00:21.125
You can start to feel bad for Bobby, almost.

02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:23.073
and tech moguls.

02:00:24.096 --> 02:00:26.684
He is a close friend and confidant of Bobby Kennedy.

02:00:28.442 --> 02:00:30.943
He was living in LA, and I was over at his house.

02:00:31.583 --> 02:00:35.505
We were having lunch, Cheryl and Bobby and I, and that was my birthday.

02:00:35.545 --> 02:00:40.467
And I said, hey, do you guys want to come to a little birthday gathering I'm having tonight?

02:00:41.127 --> 02:00:53.852
And so they came to this little dinner that I had, and I come to learn it was one of the only social events that they were able to go to together in Los Angeles.

02:00:55.549 --> 02:00:58.530
he lost lifelong friendships over this topic.

02:01:00.871 --> 02:01:08.234
Robert Kennedy epitomizes an attitude which is, if people are not listening to me all the time, I am being silenced.

02:01:09.314 --> 02:01:12.075
And therefore, I am the one who is suffering.

02:01:12.795 --> 02:01:16.457
Silence itself becomes a kind of martyrdom.

02:01:18.718 --> 02:01:21.879
I'm suffering for having the courage to speak my mind.

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.601
It's like a series of events that are happening.

02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:32.262
The separation from his wife, her suicide.

02:01:33.622 --> 02:01:36.963
The retraction of his article involving vaccines.

02:01:38.343 --> 02:01:39.144
This is a big moment.

02:01:39.204 --> 02:01:43.045
Suddenly, everything that was grounding him has become untethered.

02:01:44.325 --> 02:01:45.805
And he's at a fork in the road.

02:01:47.486 --> 02:01:48.446
When he moves to L.A.

02:01:48.866 --> 02:01:52.487
and he goes to the next phase of his life, there are no more guardrails for him.

02:01:53.365 --> 02:02:00.369
And of course, in California at that time, Brandy Vaughn is starting to put up her vaccine billboards.

02:02:04.932 --> 02:02:06.633
I'm sure they'll include reference to that.

02:02:07.493 --> 02:02:08.734
He's totally independent.

02:02:09.214 --> 02:02:10.275
He's in charge of himself.

02:02:10.335 --> 02:02:11.075
He's gone rogue.

02:02:12.917 --> 02:02:16.699
The obsession with vaccines soon merged into other conspiracies.

02:02:18.214 --> 02:02:23.179
One of RFK's 11 children seems to be buying into those conspiracy theories of how his father died.

02:02:23.459 --> 02:02:24.880
Now Robert Kennedy Jr.

02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.082
is calling for a new investigation.

02:02:28.483 --> 02:02:36.551
I think that once you start seeing the world through a conspiratorial lens towards things, I think you start to see conspiracies everywhere.

02:02:37.170 --> 02:02:38.291
Robert Kennedy Jr.

02:02:38.511 --> 02:02:53.724
said he believes... See, so that's kind of a statement that's supposed to make you think kind of like that dumb stuff that we were talking about before where, you know, there's a really elaborate conspiracy that shot John F. Kennedy and nobody could figure out who actually did it.

02:02:54.665 --> 02:02:57.447
And then that same conspiracy killed his brother.

02:02:58.087 --> 02:03:03.432
But we don't have to worry about it anymore because, you know, those people all went and back to their normal business again.

02:03:09.612 --> 02:03:14.934
It's really quite ridiculous.

02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:19.975
He wouldn't let these stories die.

02:03:20.795 --> 02:03:21.955
They've been adjudicated.

02:03:21.995 --> 02:03:22.956
They've been studied.

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:31.858
And he has continued to sort of suggest that his father's death, but also his uncle's death, were caused, at least in part, by the government.

02:03:33.078 --> 02:03:43.011
Charles Cabal, who was the mayor of Dallas at the time my uncle was assassinated, was actually a CIA operative and had been a CIA operative since 1956.

02:03:52.668 --> 02:04:07.319
For him to come out and try to reinvent the story of the death of John F. Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy as having to do with the CIA and building a whole new conspiracy, to the point that he went and interviewed Sirhan Sirhan, who killed his father.

02:04:09.941 --> 02:04:13.564
It's hard to believe that Sirhan shot my dad.

02:04:14.765 --> 02:04:17.767
I was never part of any conspiracy.

02:04:18.861 --> 02:04:27.363
In 1989, the convicted assassin Sirhan Sirhan told Inside Edition that he took full responsibility for gunning down Senator Kennedy.

02:04:28.223 --> 02:04:35.984
Bobby believed conspiracy theories about his father's death and sort of thought maybe Sirhan Sirhan is innocent, and that was a family split.

02:04:36.485 --> 02:04:43.366
Bobby on one side saying, release this guy, there's a conspiracy theory, and his family saying, no, we want him to stay in prison.

02:04:44.494 --> 02:04:50.161
why in the world anyone would take him seriously is just beyond comprehension.

02:04:52.088 --> 02:05:02.954
I think Bobby is so obsessed and concerned with these conspiracy theories because he had an incomprehensible loss that he couldn't understand.

02:05:03.754 --> 02:05:14.319
And the way to make sense out of that is to somehow redeem the situation by finding the truth and being the savior by finding the truth.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.621
I think it's a troubling

02:05:17.972 --> 02:05:20.956
They are surely insisting that he is a savior, right?

02:05:21.216 --> 02:05:22.477
It's kind of scary.

02:05:23.719 --> 02:05:27.984
They even referred to him as having the marks of the crucifixion, right?

02:05:28.044 --> 02:05:31.388
That like, that's, that's intense.

02:05:32.089 --> 02:05:33.991
This is some serious mind games.

02:05:35.993 --> 02:05:37.175
Sad situation.

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:59.114
We begin with the growing worries and response to the deadly coronavirus.

02:05:59.235 --> 02:06:03.296
The CDC all but promises that the coronavirus will spread here.

02:06:03.876 --> 02:06:06.897
Across the country, some hospitals bracing for the worst.

02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:10.918
The United States has the world's finest public health system.

02:06:12.179 --> 02:06:13.939
I'll remind the American people one more time.

02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:21.062
We are working hard to keep you safe, and your health and safety has been and will be our top priority.

02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.741
I mean, we were overwhelmed by that virus.

02:06:24.061 --> 02:06:30.063
All we could do was restrict travel, close businesses, shutter schools, isolate.

02:06:30.684 --> 02:06:35.766
More than one fourth of Americans are now being ordered to stay home.

02:06:36.366 --> 02:06:39.807
The transit system began ordering riders to wear face coverings.

02:06:40.247 --> 02:06:43.929
One man saying he was pulled off a bus because he wasn't wearing one.

02:06:44.449 --> 02:06:47.530
I'm asking this member to put on a mask because that is our company policy.

02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:48.891
So either wear the mask.

02:06:49.111 --> 02:06:51.392
And I'm not doing it because I woke up in a free country.

02:06:52.668 --> 02:06:57.632
I think that was seen as massive government overreach by a significant percentage of this population.

02:06:59.473 --> 02:07:03.677
Fresh anger rippling across the country in the face of widespread shutdowns.

02:07:03.937 --> 02:07:08.000
Protesters calling the orders too extreme in a violation of their rights.

02:07:09.281 --> 02:07:13.084
It was true, I think, in 2020 and 2021, that we were a little dictatorial.

02:07:13.324 --> 02:07:16.947
I think we should have included the public in many of those decisions.

02:07:17.587 --> 02:07:19.429
Open Arizona now.

02:07:20.768 --> 02:07:24.153
They saw the government as dictating what to do, and they didn't like it.

02:07:24.173 --> 02:07:27.197
Bobby Kennedy seized on the anger.

02:07:27.658 --> 02:07:29.620
They've lied to us from day one.

02:07:30.461 --> 02:07:33.406
To tell everybody in our country, you have to stay in your house.

02:07:35.683 --> 02:07:46.892
Mark, maybe you missed it, but Robert F. Kennedy is a story about clean cocaine and very fine, pure, pharmaceutical-grade heroin.

02:07:47.312 --> 02:07:50.575
He's not a story about fentanyl, carfentanil, or

02:07:51.315 --> 02:07:53.657
or contaminated or laced drugs.

02:07:54.097 --> 02:07:58.580
He's a story about the finest in pharmaceutical grade street drugs.

02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:01.723
So, you know, you gotta, you want to keep everything straight.

02:08:01.743 --> 02:08:06.846
That's a completely different thing where, you know, a million Americans or so were killed in the last eight years or so.

02:08:06.886 --> 02:08:08.447
That's, that's completely different.

02:08:08.968 --> 02:08:15.712
But yes, it is absolutely essential that they don't talk about that because otherwise there would be nobody left for COVID.

02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:21.871
In one live stream after another, he was returning to the spotlight.

02:08:22.651 --> 02:08:26.293
My father told me this when I was a really young child.

02:08:26.794 --> 02:08:34.938
The opioid pandemic is a great justification for bombing boats with remote cameras, indeed.

02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.379
It's a power lie.

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:42.703
And the only way democracy functions is if everybody is constantly questioning them.

02:08:43.544 --> 02:08:47.646
Bobby used social media in a powerful way.

02:08:48.307 --> 02:08:52.169
Bobby used social media in a powerful way.

02:08:52.429 --> 02:08:53.150
Stop lying!

02:08:53.630 --> 02:08:56.612
Social media used Bobby in a very powerful way.

02:08:57.893 --> 02:09:02.634
Social media is used to use Del Bigtree in a very powerful way.

02:09:03.515 --> 02:09:06.596
Del Bigtree actually just kind of works on social media.

02:09:07.236 --> 02:09:17.239
Social media is the military social control program that put RFK where he is, established who he is, and got as many people to follow him as possible.

02:09:19.847 --> 02:09:20.628
I am winning.

02:09:20.908 --> 02:09:21.729
I am winning.

02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:24.112
Yes, I am winning.

02:09:24.132 --> 02:09:32.140
Media gave everyone that was really questioning what was happening a voice.

02:09:33.081 --> 02:09:36.745
Oh, social media gave everybody a voice.

02:09:36.765 --> 02:09:36.805
No.

02:09:42.466 --> 02:09:45.067
No, social media gave everybody an answer.

02:09:45.667 --> 02:09:48.867
Social media gave everybody the hero that they needed.

02:09:48.967 --> 02:09:52.608
If they needed the hero to be Tony Fauci, they gave him Tony Fauci.

02:09:53.108 --> 02:10:05.471
But if they needed an alternative hero, maybe they found Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or Del Bigtree, or Robert Malone, or that, I don't know, that crazy lady from Africa that was

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:20.832
was part of the American Frontline Doctors, or Simone Gold, or whoever, or they found Pierre Kory, or they found Peter McCullough, or maybe they found Jessica Rose, God forbid.

02:10:21.453 --> 02:10:23.795
That's what social media did.

02:10:23.875 --> 02:10:26.318
Social media did not give anyone a voice.

02:10:26.398 --> 02:10:28.880
It tricked people into believing they had a voice.

02:10:29.841 --> 02:10:30.542
That's for sure.

02:10:32.594 --> 02:10:35.637
Del Bigtree is a podcaster, a vaccine critic.

02:10:36.197 --> 02:10:41.242
He's a first and foremost, he is a podcaster.

02:10:41.762 --> 02:10:43.164
You're damn right he is.

02:10:43.184 --> 02:10:46.967
Close friend of Kennedy.

02:10:47.988 --> 02:10:51.551
Only Bobby Kennedy and people like him were asking that question.

02:10:51.891 --> 02:10:56.776
All of mainstream media was just, whatever the government says, we're going to support that.

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:04.262
During the lockdowns, more and more people saw that things didn't make sense.

02:11:05.163 --> 02:11:09.744
And they just thought maybe we're being lied to.

02:11:10.405 --> 02:11:11.785
What's the reality on masks?

02:11:12.886 --> 02:11:20.228
Well, right now, Chris, let me just say, there's no reason for people in the United States now to be walking around with masks.

02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:21.509
There just isn't.

02:11:24.718 --> 02:11:34.221
But some sort of mask-like facial covering, I think for the time being, should be a very regular part of how we prevent the spread of infection.

02:11:34.941 --> 02:11:40.883
I think uncertainty is a really powerful force in politicizing people in unexpected ways.

02:11:41.223 --> 02:11:43.364
Yeah, throw it off!

02:11:43.444 --> 02:11:44.384
Throw it off, baby!

02:11:44.624 --> 02:11:47.305
Out of that discomfort comes this

02:11:48.007 --> 02:11:53.268
Uncertainty is a way of politicizing people in very unexpected ways.

02:11:53.428 --> 02:12:03.570
But we've done a lot of military exercises to try and understand how uncertainty can mobilize people in very predictable ways.

02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:12.572
The military understands exactly how to create chaos and mobilize people in very specific ways.

02:12:13.132 --> 02:12:17.473
So either she's a super dipshit or she's reading a script.

02:12:18.732 --> 02:12:21.693
Passion for, wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:12:21.813 --> 02:12:23.073
This can't be normal.

02:12:23.913 --> 02:12:25.474
There's something else going on.

02:12:26.034 --> 02:12:28.695
And I think that breeds conspiracy thinking.

02:12:28.715 --> 02:12:30.615
There's got to be another explanation.

02:12:32.255 --> 02:12:35.416
I guess for her, there's never another explanation.

02:12:35.476 --> 02:12:37.857
It's always just what she knows.

02:12:38.965 --> 02:12:39.986
It's a joke, really.

02:12:40.046 --> 02:12:40.886
It's really a joke.

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:48.532
And the problem is, is that there are lots of shithead adults right now in America and around the world because of social media.

02:12:49.172 --> 02:12:53.795
Social media is likely responsible for the reason why that woman is so unlikable.

02:12:54.596 --> 02:13:01.381
She doesn't even understand how unlikable she is because she is a skillful social media user.

02:13:03.402 --> 02:13:05.624
And here's this guy over here who's like, I have the answer.

02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:10.313
This disease is about engineering compliance.

02:13:11.453 --> 02:13:12.334
And who's that?

02:13:12.414 --> 02:13:14.215
That's Sherry Tenpenny.

02:13:14.295 --> 02:13:20.359
She's been working on vaccines for more than 25 years, roughly 17 hours a day.

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:31.387
And about three years in to her 25 years of work, she actually heard the voice of God tell her to keep doing it.

02:13:33.359 --> 02:13:34.380
That's why she does it.

02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:55.671
And Judy Mikovits is a hero because she worked in Nevada, and she spoke out about some kind of contamination in the vaccines to do with mouse viruses, and also worked on AIDS, but not really, kind of, sorta.

02:13:57.413 --> 02:14:24.428
And that's Andrew Wakefield up there, who is of course the guy who advocated for separating the measles, mumps, rubella shot into three separate shots in the early 2000s with Polly Tommy in the UK and then came to the United States and bought lots of property in Austin with Polly Tommy having, they're each having a ranch down there in Austin, Texas and started the whole game again and are actually behind Del Big Tree

02:14:25.448 --> 02:14:33.112
and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Mary Holland, and Brian Hooker, they're all part of the same team.

02:14:33.652 --> 02:14:42.896
And here they are at the beginning of the pandemic, and Bobby Kennedy is just playing along with them because one way or another, it's all one malevolent show.

02:14:42.956 --> 02:14:47.539
And I think it's very possible that Judy Mikovits knows more than he does.

02:14:47.999 --> 02:14:51.320
It's possible that Andrew Wakefield knows more than he does.

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:54.082
It's possible that Del Bigtree knows more than he does.

02:14:54.642 --> 02:14:58.225
But he is definitely being played.

02:15:01.287 --> 02:15:04.008
I really think you have to see it for what it is.

02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:12.554
I think it's very possible that it would be better described as an English-based controlled demolition of America.

02:15:13.715 --> 02:15:21.761
And in that case, you're kind of looking at a crown royal American saboteurs

02:15:22.861 --> 02:15:36.895
that probably can be traced with family connections all the way back to the Confederacy or to, you know, whatever part of America during that time was, you know, being supported by the British.

02:15:38.737 --> 02:15:39.478
Something like that.

02:15:40.865 --> 02:15:47.008
I mean, I don't know what's going on, but I definitely know that it's not the Jews.

02:15:47.848 --> 02:15:54.672
I know for sure that it's not just the people that went to Epstein Island and had pictures taken with them.

02:15:55.312 --> 02:15:56.753
I know it can't be just that.

02:16:04.282 --> 02:16:19.019
He begins to bring people together under this idea that the government response has been a pretext for a clampdown, a sort of totalitarian clampdown on free speech and a way to strip people of their civil liberties.

02:16:19.571 --> 02:16:26.014
They are going to rob us not only of our democracy and our liberties, but they're going to rob us of our souls.

02:16:26.634 --> 02:16:28.735
Bobby's the one that I'm relating to the most.

02:16:29.476 --> 02:16:31.817
That is what changed the conversation for Bobby.

02:16:32.237 --> 02:16:35.199
Bobby Kennedy is saying it's wrong to be shutting down my church.

02:16:35.659 --> 02:16:37.640
I thought he was crazy, but I agree with him there.

02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.820
What else is he saying?

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:39.961
Oh, he's saying that the masks

02:16:40.481 --> 02:16:41.302
Don't really do anything.

02:16:41.382 --> 02:16:41.962
It's weird.

02:16:42.002 --> 02:16:45.665
It's almost like he's pretending he didn't know Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:16:45.705 --> 02:16:49.948
for like already five years beforehand and know exactly what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:16:49.988 --> 02:16:50.469
is thinking.

02:16:50.969 --> 02:16:53.791
Otherwise, why in the hell would he choose him to head his campaign?

02:16:55.513 --> 02:16:57.094
They didn't work on Vax together.

02:16:57.114 --> 02:16:59.075
They didn't work on Vax two together.

02:17:01.277 --> 02:17:02.238
Like it's weird, right?

02:17:03.834 --> 02:17:11.400
Don't forget Aaron Seery worked for Goldman Sachs, the vampire squid that Matt Taibbi used to fight against until he stopped fighting against it.

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:15.383
The same vampire squid that Steve Bannon works for.

02:17:15.643 --> 02:17:18.385
Goldman Sachs, you know, the bank that bankrupted Greece.

02:17:19.226 --> 02:17:22.748
Goldman Sachs, you know, the bank that nobody talks about anymore.

02:17:22.788 --> 02:17:24.990
Instead we talk about BlackRock all the time.

02:17:29.175 --> 02:17:30.095
What's a bandana gonna do?

02:17:30.135 --> 02:17:31.136
How's that stopping a virus?

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:32.616
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense either.

02:17:33.256 --> 02:17:34.597
Bobby Kennedy is making sense.

02:17:35.077 --> 02:17:36.217
What else was he saying?

02:17:36.977 --> 02:17:46.540
A bandana doesn't stop the virus, but Brett Weinstein used a bandana and woodshop glasses to stop the virus for like nine and a half months.

02:17:47.661 --> 02:17:51.622
And you've been on stage with him several times, including in front of the Senate.

02:17:52.082 --> 02:17:53.482
You were sitting right next to him.

02:17:53.522 --> 02:17:55.143
Did you call his shit out?

02:17:57.521 --> 02:17:59.623
Dell, you're such a clown.

02:17:59.643 --> 02:18:15.134
I love pandemics because it gives them power, it gives them control, and it gives them the capacity to impose obedience on human beings.

02:18:16.495 --> 02:18:19.837
It's easy for people to say that their freedom is being restricted.

02:18:21.038 --> 02:18:24.961
On the other hand, more lives would have been lost had some of those policies not been in place.

02:18:25.936 --> 02:18:31.259
Dr. Fiona Havers is an infectious disease expert who worked on the CDC's COVID response.

02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:39.865
At the time, the number of people becoming very seriously ill and dying from COVID was really very high.

02:18:40.485 --> 02:18:42.006
I saw the real human costs of it.

02:18:42.046 --> 02:18:45.869
I mean, we had families that were being brought into the ICU to say goodbye to their loved ones.

02:18:46.499 --> 02:18:46.999
The U.S.

02:18:47.059 --> 02:18:49.440
now leading the world in deaths.

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:52.521
More than 2,000 lives lost in the last 24 hours.

02:18:52.821 --> 02:18:54.162
America's deadliest day yet.

02:18:54.402 --> 02:18:58.944
COVID-19 has brought this country to its knees and their future is uncertain.

02:18:59.964 --> 02:19:02.406
So no mention of supplementary oxygen.

02:19:02.486 --> 02:19:05.588
No mention of ventilators being used to stop spread.

02:19:05.668 --> 02:19:10.871
No mention of the thousands and thousands of Americans killed by opioids.

02:19:11.692 --> 02:19:23.179
No mention of a population pyramid, which predicted a rise in all cause mortality that might be sustained for about 10 years and threatening to bankrupt many Western civilization countries.

02:19:23.279 --> 02:19:28.463
It's, it's, it's remarkable because after six years I expect nothing less.

02:19:32.242 --> 02:19:37.788
At the time, the Trump administration was embarking on an unprecedented effort to produce a vaccine.

02:19:37.808 --> 02:19:41.191
— It's called Operation Warp Speed.

02:19:42.752 --> 02:19:44.374
That means big, and it means fast.

02:19:44.394 --> 02:19:52.362
A massive scientific, industrial, and logistical endeavor, unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project.

02:19:54.781 --> 02:20:17.773
You know the Manhattan Project is where all those people that built the atomic bomb then they moved on to working on bacteria and phages because they were going to solve the problem of heredity and evolution and unlock the last remaining rules of the universe and then they kind of failed.

02:20:18.701 --> 02:20:23.744
And everybody stopped working on bacteria except to use it to make like lots of copies of DNA.

02:20:24.304 --> 02:20:30.567
And then everybody just started working on animal cells and animal viruses and everybody just forgot about bacteria and phages.

02:20:32.988 --> 02:20:35.809
That's the actual reality of biology.

02:20:36.470 --> 02:20:43.153
And so for him to be scripted to cite the Manhattan Project is ironic in a battleship-sized way.

02:20:44.468 --> 02:20:51.022
because it is from the Manhattan Project that a lot of these assumptions about where we were going to be by 1970 or 1980 or 1990 were based.

02:20:56.158 --> 02:21:12.766
that once these physicists that just had cracked the atom turned their attention to the newly found chemical material for DNA, or chemical material for heredity called DNA, we would have the keys to the universe.

02:21:13.186 --> 02:21:14.307
And that didn't happen.

02:21:15.147 --> 02:21:16.908
That actually didn't happen.

02:21:19.269 --> 02:21:25.092
Just like the Human Genome Project wasn't the end of something, it was proof of principle.

02:21:26.263 --> 02:21:40.070
And ever since, they have been doing iterations to try and get the specificity and the reliability and the reproducibility higher of actually obtaining a full human genome.

02:21:40.531 --> 02:21:45.974
Storing it in a useful format that is accessible by a machine learning algorithm.

02:21:46.034 --> 02:21:53.578
And now, imagine trying to do it for the entire population of a university, because they tried to do that during the pandemic as well.

02:21:54.418 --> 02:21:57.020
Now imagine it trying to do it for an entire state.

02:22:01.004 --> 02:22:17.037
These iterations are all being done right now with the idea of eventually having the enough computing power so that they could crack some meaningful progress in understanding human heredity and human biology, but they haven't made that progress yet.

02:22:18.138 --> 02:22:22.001
Because they have quantified the problem as needing data,

02:22:22.702 --> 02:22:31.729
The data in the form of as much medical data as we can get from one individual and as precise a measurement of their genetic data as we can get.

02:22:31.849 --> 02:22:36.994
A precise as measurement as we can get of the composition of their microbiome.

02:22:37.094 --> 02:22:42.058
As precise a measurement as we can get of the DNA of their mitochondria.

02:22:44.039 --> 02:22:48.183
And so we're a long ways from being able to do that, my friends.

02:22:49.346 --> 02:22:59.670
But you know, a cell phone in every pocket is just one step forward in a long, long march to experimental animal status for our grandkids.

02:23:00.871 --> 02:23:05.072
This guy, Jeremy Marks, gladly participating.

02:23:10.094 --> 02:23:10.894
Where's my pen?

02:23:11.135 --> 02:23:11.855
Oh, it's in my hand.

02:23:12.495 --> 02:23:16.937
Accelerate the process of making a vaccine from two years down to one year.

02:23:17.793 --> 02:23:21.254
Dr. Peter Marks was one of the creators of Operation Warp Speed.

02:23:22.215 --> 02:23:28.717
CDC estimated that during an extra year, while we were waiting for a vaccine, we'd lose probably about 3 million lives.

02:23:29.337 --> 02:23:33.159
We're all witnessing a potential turning point in the coronavirus pandemic.

02:23:33.759 --> 02:23:35.179
It took less than a year.

02:23:35.679 --> 02:23:43.342
The FDA authorizing Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, clearing... It is Biontech's vaccine, for cripes' sake.

02:23:43.362 --> 02:23:45.203
Pfizer just puts their name on it.

02:23:48.959 --> 02:23:55.662
Look how deep that intramuscular injection goes.

02:23:55.782 --> 02:23:56.703
Look how deep.

02:23:56.723 --> 02:24:00.925
I think it was the greatest scientific or medical achievement in my lifetime.

02:24:01.185 --> 02:24:03.986
And my lifetime includes the development of a polio vaccine.

02:24:04.594 --> 02:24:10.697
As Operation Warp Speed kicks into high gear, the latest projection is 40 million doses delivered.

02:24:11.538 --> 02:24:17.681
For millions of doses to be... The United States has launched the biggest vaccine drive in its history.

02:24:18.421 --> 02:24:21.563
I think it was the greatest scientific or medical achievement in my lifetime.

02:24:21.823 --> 02:24:24.625
And my lifetime includes the development of a polio vaccine.

02:24:25.505 --> 02:24:28.206
Paul Offit is scripted to say that.

02:24:28.487 --> 02:24:31.068
He might not even want to say it, but he's saying it.

02:24:32.162 --> 02:24:33.763
because the script calls for it.

02:24:33.803 --> 02:24:53.098
The national security script calls for Paul Offit, who thanks to the scholarship of a Housatonic in Boston, Mark Kulak, we have an article of Paul Offit saying that in an ideal situation, all of the vaccine schedule would be oral.

02:24:53.118 --> 02:24:56.241
Well, I wonder why you would say that.

02:24:58.488 --> 02:25:00.270
Warp speed kicks into high gear.

02:25:00.610 --> 02:25:05.314
The latest projection is 40 million doses delivered by the end of the month.

02:25:06.155 --> 02:25:09.418
I thought that this would really hurt the anti-vaccine movement.

02:25:09.458 --> 02:25:12.241
To hear they would see this, how vaccines could save our lives.

02:25:12.321 --> 02:25:13.902
And that vaccine did save our lives.

02:25:14.242 --> 02:25:16.344
That vaccine probably saved 3 million lives.

02:25:17.505 --> 02:25:18.506
We can end this.

02:25:19.667 --> 02:25:23.711
We have the capability and the resources to end it.

02:25:24.577 --> 02:25:28.283
We've just got to get people to step up and get vaccinated.

02:25:29.425 --> 02:25:31.489
This was Bobby Kennedy's moment.

02:25:33.186 --> 02:25:41.934
How in the heck can we be mandating to children that they take a medical product for which we do not know the risks?

02:25:42.475 --> 02:25:44.437
And to me, that is criminal.

02:25:45.137 --> 02:25:54.686
He sees this great opportunity to question the vaccine, which everybody else sees as like the great hope for getting out of this horrible thing.

02:25:54.787 --> 02:25:56.768
See, so again,

02:25:57.899 --> 02:26:22.903
Despite the unequivocal value of something like vaccines, this guy, because he's a Kennedy and he's handsome and he's addicted to drugs and he's addicted to sex, he's able to overcome all of the intellectual resistance and all of the common sense that would otherwise lead people to believe that he's an idiot, and they fall for it.

02:26:23.043 --> 02:26:26.704
And he's able to raise millions of dollars and able to put

02:26:27.304 --> 02:26:36.169
videos and movies out and able to get Robert De Niro to talk shit on, on, on, on TV broadcasts.

02:26:36.189 --> 02:26:44.094
So it's remarkable that this guy is being used by PBS NewsHour because he doesn't even seem to understand the history correctly.

02:26:44.854 --> 02:26:46.815
It's vanity fair.

02:26:47.556 --> 02:26:48.636
Look at this chump.

02:26:50.978 --> 02:26:53.199
He immediately questions it and sows doubt about it.

02:26:54.731 --> 02:26:58.992
And it turns out there was an audience who didn't trust that the government had created something.

02:26:59.012 --> 02:27:10.214
But he sowed doubt on a government-provided script, which means he didn't say that this was an old technology that's been used on every bench, in every academic bench, on every university in America.

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.634
It's called transfection.

02:27:12.074 --> 02:27:14.055
We're not going to do this to healthy people.

02:27:14.515 --> 02:27:15.395
That would be nuts.

02:27:16.015 --> 02:27:19.616
Even though he could have said it, because there was a medical

02:27:20.711 --> 02:27:31.494
faculty member in the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was saying it in 2020 and got fired for saying it and he was aware of him, but yeah, whatever.

02:27:31.514 --> 02:27:33.815
I think that could save their lives.

02:27:35.155 --> 02:27:45.078
I can tell you a vaccine that prevents 99.8% of people from dying from COVID and it's called your immune system.

02:27:46.523 --> 02:27:51.309
He has really found his calling because his Twitter feed explodes.

02:27:52.650 --> 02:27:54.412
Now he's got a big following of people.

02:27:54.872 --> 02:27:57.696
Wow, so Twitter is just out of control.

02:27:57.796 --> 02:28:06.225
So Twitter and his really clever use of social media resulted in a bunch of people being fooled by bullshit.

02:28:08.302 --> 02:28:11.384
Because Paul Offit doesn't know how to use social media.

02:28:11.984 --> 02:28:19.029
Paul Offit doesn't have a social media manager, so he's not able to reach people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:28:19.069 --> 02:28:19.769
can.

02:28:20.290 --> 02:28:26.054
If only Paul Offit and the pro-vaccine people had somebody as good at social media as Del Batre.

02:28:28.175 --> 02:28:30.837
COVID is really a kind of godsend for Robert Kennedy.

02:28:31.834 --> 02:28:34.096
It's a kind of part of the Savior story, isn't it?

02:28:34.136 --> 02:28:35.677
You know, that the Savior is mocked.

02:28:36.277 --> 02:28:40.100
Are we gonna keep calling him a Savior for this whole two hours?

02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:43.462
Are we really gonna keep calling him a Savior like an enchantment?

02:28:44.182 --> 02:28:49.486
This is the same clown who said that he had the marks.

02:28:49.786 --> 02:28:50.546
Nobody listens.

02:28:51.867 --> 02:28:54.249
And then something happens and he says, you were right all along.

02:28:55.862 --> 02:29:07.811
If you take the vaccine, you're 500% more likely to die of a heart attack over the next six months than if you don't.

02:29:07.891 --> 02:29:13.836
What a weird thing to be scripted to say now that we're in 2025 and people are talking about myocarditis, huh?

02:29:15.257 --> 02:29:17.338
A strange thing to be talking about then.

02:29:17.939 --> 02:29:19.280
It's almost like he was scripted.

02:29:20.020 --> 02:29:23.283
One with a very large audience spreading misinformation.

02:29:24.633 --> 02:29:33.978
It was really frustrating and really disheartening because we finally had a tool to combat this new virus that was killing thousands of people every week.

02:29:34.458 --> 02:29:41.021
And a lot of those people now were making choices based on the bad information that he was spreading, and it was costing lives.

02:29:43.182 --> 02:29:45.063
Let's go and fight for freedom.

02:29:46.924 --> 02:29:49.426
Soon, Kennedy was facing powerful opposition.

02:29:49.466 --> 02:29:50.286
There's nobody there!

02:29:53.837 --> 02:29:55.919
President, what is the situation on the ground?

02:29:55.959 --> 02:30:00.483
President Biden's COVID relief battle, his first real test as president.

02:30:00.883 --> 02:30:04.667
And then Joe Biden tried to tamp down on misinformation.

02:30:05.267 --> 02:30:07.789
We must end the politics of misinformation.

02:30:07.809 --> 02:30:10.331
It's divided families, communities in the country.

02:30:11.352 --> 02:30:13.014
It's cost too many lives already.

02:30:14.215 --> 02:30:21.658
and the Biden administration starts working with social media companies to take- Hey, Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

02:30:21.758 --> 02:30:28.921
Isn't that the chick that, that, that Robert Malone set up for, uh, Mark, are you still there?

02:30:29.021 --> 02:30:30.001
Isn't that the chick?

02:30:30.541 --> 02:30:31.902
I didn't watch it this far.

02:30:33.095 --> 02:30:43.002
I think that's the girl that got, the lady that got set up with the Jesse Gelsinger story and made her career according to Robert Malone in an interview.

02:30:43.022 --> 02:30:45.964
Uh, maybe Hugh Satonic will confirm that.

02:30:47.185 --> 02:30:48.086
Misinformation.

02:30:49.647 --> 02:30:54.670
And Kennedy is identified as one of the top misinformation spreaders.

02:30:55.391 --> 02:30:56.512
That's a bingo!

02:30:59.372 --> 02:31:00.653
That's fantastic!

02:31:03.196 --> 02:31:08.020
Instagram has banned controversial anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:31:08.401 --> 02:31:15.508
Facebook, which owns Instagram, saying, we remove this account for repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.

02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:24.293
If you were a government that believed it was very important for everybody to get this mRNA vaccine, Bobby Kennedy Jr.

02:31:24.353 --> 02:31:25.653
was your enemy.

02:31:25.993 --> 02:31:27.914
He was the adversary you needed to knock.

02:31:28.114 --> 02:31:30.455
Boy, Gavin is a great friend, isn't he?

02:31:30.535 --> 02:31:31.535
Boy, he's awesome.

02:31:34.465 --> 02:31:34.745
down.

02:31:35.666 --> 02:31:38.229
Quickly on Instagram, they take him off Instagram.

02:31:38.789 --> 02:31:40.551
YouTube, he's not allowed on YouTube.

02:31:40.811 --> 02:31:41.552
Deplatformed.

02:31:42.273 --> 02:31:43.234
Facebook, gone.

02:31:43.314 --> 02:31:44.355
Can't be on Facebook.

02:31:45.316 --> 02:31:59.049
My crime was... And so now the Facebook platform, the social media platforms can track everybody that goes from that click to searching for him.

02:32:00.287 --> 02:32:05.532
And everybody that does that gets put into a social media group, gets funneled into, and what?

02:32:06.173 --> 02:32:09.255
Del Bigtree said that social media gave everybody a voice.

02:32:11.698 --> 02:32:17.183
No, social media gave everybody an answer, gave everybody bad questions, gave everybody a hero.

02:32:19.385 --> 02:32:20.126
You see it now?

02:32:21.519 --> 02:32:25.501
And they're all on a script to try and pretend that it wasn't their fault.

02:32:25.922 --> 02:32:27.202
They had nothing to do with it.

02:32:27.242 --> 02:32:34.867
They've been trying to stop him for years, but he's just the benefit of the Kennedy name and he's got lots of friends and money.

02:32:34.907 --> 02:32:36.988
And so there's nothing we can do about it.

02:32:37.108 --> 02:32:39.330
Just rich people get away with shit.

02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:41.751
I'm in policies.

02:32:42.251 --> 02:32:46.434
I'm not, it was not passing actual misinformation.

02:32:47.955 --> 02:32:49.876
If there's fight or flight, he fights.

02:32:51.069 --> 02:32:52.349
He sees it as a real affront.

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:55.310
He believes that what he's spreading is not misinformation.

02:32:55.370 --> 02:33:01.152
It's just sort of, you know, making people more fully informed about vaccines, even though what he's spreading is misinformation.

02:33:02.752 --> 02:33:15.456
And this is really when the seed of the idea to run for president is planted, because what really gets him going is, well, if I ran for president, I'd have to restore my social media accounts.

02:33:15.496 --> 02:33:19.757
So he ran for president to get his social media accounts restored.

02:33:20.387 --> 02:33:21.108
Stop lying!

02:33:22.509 --> 02:33:24.972
That's so dumb, I don't even know where to start.

02:33:25.572 --> 02:33:31.839
Especially because if you're a journalist, you would know about this frickin' book!

02:33:34.997 --> 02:33:54.472
You're on the same show as the producer of this book, the editor and the president of this publishing company that published a book that just put out the hypothetical that a Republican president might take an independent candidate as their vice president if that independent candidate was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:33:55.112 --> 02:34:00.195
and then that Republican candidate might get shot and then Republican, then Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:34:00.215 --> 02:34:02.897
would end up being president and could save the United States.

02:34:03.377 --> 02:34:16.905
And you're in the same frickin' documentary as the jackass who's the president of this publishing company and yet you're gonna try and tell me that this is when the idea to run for president came in his mind.

02:34:21.584 --> 02:34:26.047
That is some seriously stupid scripted shit right there.

02:34:26.327 --> 02:34:26.908
Wow.

02:34:27.528 --> 02:34:28.349
Wow.

02:34:29.330 --> 02:34:34.453
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:34:34.553 --> 02:34:36.875
I was at his announcement in Boston.

02:34:37.656 --> 02:34:38.336
It was incredible.

02:34:40.238 --> 02:34:42.239
I was at his Boston announcement.

02:34:42.379 --> 02:34:43.400
It was incredible.

02:34:44.730 --> 02:34:50.753
I was one row in front of Meryl Nass and Abby Rockefeller.

02:34:50.813 --> 02:35:02.598
I was two rows behind Robert Malone and Jill Glasspool Malone, next to my friend Mark Kulak and my not-so-friend John Bodwin.

02:35:04.175 --> 02:35:12.677
You know, the guy with the CDC book and the guy that's been touring all around with McKernan and, and Kirsch, that guy was on the steering committee of Kirsch.

02:35:13.118 --> 02:35:16.799
He's a terrible script, scripted shithead.

02:35:16.959 --> 02:35:24.281
I mean, he was recruited late, but he's a scripted shithead and John Bodwin deserves to get punched in the face.

02:35:24.961 --> 02:35:28.182
And if I ever see him in person, that's probably what I'm going to do.

02:35:29.622 --> 02:35:31.163
felt that he was the savior.

02:35:31.183 --> 02:35:32.845
It was Masonic.

02:35:33.245 --> 02:35:34.486
He's a populist.

02:35:36.067 --> 02:35:37.828
Did he just say Masonic?

02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:40.370
That everyone was swept up.

02:35:41.471 --> 02:35:42.692
He's a populist.

02:35:44.033 --> 02:35:45.615
I thought he was a savior.

02:35:45.635 --> 02:35:46.315
It was incredible.

02:35:47.756 --> 02:35:49.818
And they felt that he was the savior.

02:35:49.838 --> 02:35:51.519
It was Masonic.

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:53.141
He's a populist.

02:35:54.482 --> 02:35:56.063
I thought that everyone was swept up.

02:35:57.219 --> 02:36:01.000
As he made his announcement, he wasn't going to let his past hold him back.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.340
I'm going to put my cards on the table.

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.541
I am not an ideal presidential candidate.

02:36:08.341 --> 02:36:12.762
I had a rambunctious youth and it lasted until my early 60s.

02:36:15.323 --> 02:36:23.204
I told my wife... We got to watch because we might get on this program because I was in the audience, so was Mark.

02:36:24.065 --> 02:36:25.265
I got to pause it every time.

02:36:25.325 --> 02:36:25.725
Pause.

02:36:27.261 --> 02:36:28.081
I don't see.

02:36:28.321 --> 02:36:29.842
Okay, I recognize her.

02:36:30.562 --> 02:36:32.303
This is a lawyer at CHD.

02:36:32.343 --> 02:36:34.663
Her name is Rita and she's awesome.

02:36:35.444 --> 02:36:36.984
I think Rita is a good person.

02:36:40.665 --> 02:36:41.045
Who else?

02:36:41.105 --> 02:36:43.286
Oh, there's Robert Malone right there in the front row.

02:36:44.487 --> 02:36:51.329
Which means that Mark and I would be over here somewhere.

02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:52.649
Can you see that mouse?

02:36:52.769 --> 02:36:53.669
I don't think you can see that.

02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:54.810
You can see this mouse though.

02:36:55.751 --> 02:36:58.812
I think we're over, wait, where's my mouse?

02:37:00.253 --> 02:37:00.993
We're over here.

02:37:01.393 --> 02:37:05.435
We're just to the right of this screen.

02:37:05.675 --> 02:37:07.295
But the gnome is right down here.

02:37:07.335 --> 02:37:08.616
You can see the gnome right here.

02:37:08.676 --> 02:37:10.916
And then this would be Jill's head.

02:37:13.297 --> 02:37:20.320
My wife, the other day, I said, I got so many skeletons in my closet that if they could vote, I could be king of the world.

02:37:23.422 --> 02:37:30.287
Pause, that guy, let's see, that guy raises funds for CHD.

02:37:33.969 --> 02:37:36.051
Who else do I see that I recognize?

02:37:37.031 --> 02:37:41.434
Is that, that could be Vera, Vera Sharov right there.

02:37:44.436 --> 02:37:49.360
I thought Andrew Huff was kind of here in kind of the middle somewhere, but

02:37:50.123 --> 02:37:51.023
Maybe I'm wrong.

02:37:51.063 --> 02:37:52.423
Maybe he was on the other side.

02:37:52.463 --> 02:37:54.864
I don't think he got into the front part like we did.

02:37:56.804 --> 02:38:01.545
He told me in my interview with him that he wanted to run because he felt he'd been muzzled.

02:38:02.965 --> 02:38:05.426
Kind of a strange reason to run for president.

02:38:05.966 --> 02:38:14.147
Oh, so this is another one of those journalists who can't seem to figure out that, yeah, it's a strange reason to run for president because it's not the right reason.

02:38:14.187 --> 02:38:18.668
The reason why is because he's been set up to run for president, you dumb ass.

02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:26.194
It's almost like they're all on a script because they can't figure it out even though it's all right there in front of their face.

02:38:26.234 --> 02:38:27.936
All they got to do is like buy books.

02:38:31.639 --> 02:38:40.265
Given that he's a Kennedy and he already had a platform, but you know, claiming that the world's against you has always been part of his narrative.

02:38:41.266 --> 02:38:44.688
This is what happens when you censor somebody for 18 years.

02:38:49.648 --> 02:38:51.829
So there's Robert Malone.

02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:54.451
There's Jill Glasspool Malone.

02:38:55.832 --> 02:38:59.254
And so we would be like right over here.

02:38:59.474 --> 02:39:07.259
I don't think you'd have to turn the camera even that much, and we would be right there, which is super duper annoying.

02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:10.481
But I'm coming up in a second, don't worry.

02:39:11.042 --> 02:39:16.045
They shut me up that long, because now I'm going to really let loose on them for the next 18 months.

02:39:16.105 --> 02:39:17.806
They're going to hear a lot from me.

02:39:19.542 --> 02:39:27.007
Now remember, one of the things that happens here, now if you look very carefully you can see a guy right here with a black hat.

02:39:27.227 --> 02:39:28.828
Okay, let me get my mouse over here.

02:39:28.868 --> 02:39:34.912
With a black hat and then there's going to be an arm up here with a plaid shirt and that's me for sure.

02:39:35.533 --> 02:39:41.957
So there's a black hat here and then I think that's actually, that actually might be Mark and then me.

02:39:42.537 --> 02:39:44.238
But you'll see in a second, I'll pause it.

02:39:44.258 --> 02:39:46.140
You can see my arm clearly.

02:39:47.592 --> 02:39:49.974
And at the time right I will admit it.

02:39:50.354 --> 02:39:52.136
I thought that something was happening.

02:39:53.437 --> 02:39:54.918
I Thought something was happening.

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:56.620
I thought that these people were real.

02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:11.334
I thought I thought Robert F. Kennedy jr Was real I didn't really think Robert Malone was real, but I thought him being there suggested that Robert F. Kennedy jr might be real But it was at this event that we saw

02:40:12.603 --> 02:40:23.205
Mary, sorry, Meryl Nass walk into the center aisle and Robert Malone walk into the center aisle and then walk up to each other and hug without words.

02:40:24.106 --> 02:40:28.507
And not hug in a casual way, but hug in a longtime friend way.

02:40:29.087 --> 02:40:29.687
No words.

02:40:29.807 --> 02:40:31.387
And then they walked away together.

02:40:32.848 --> 02:40:36.809
That happened before this actually, before Kennedy took the stage.

02:40:37.629 --> 02:40:38.489
And this is the end.

02:40:40.276 --> 02:40:42.717
And it's remarkable because we were there.

02:40:44.017 --> 02:40:59.161
This is real American history being distorted by a national security narrative control apparatus on social media and PBS NewsHour and lots of other news channels, because that's how this shit is done.

02:40:59.221 --> 02:41:00.582
That's how the donuts are made.

02:41:02.642 --> 02:41:05.263
Instagram lifted their- There it is right there.

02:41:05.303 --> 02:41:06.063
Oh, ships.

02:41:07.263 --> 02:41:07.763
Gotta go back.

02:41:11.607 --> 02:41:14.998
Instagram so this arm right here.

02:41:15.058 --> 02:41:18.449
I know you can see it that arm right there is

02:41:20.612 --> 02:41:27.757
He's got a plaid shirt, and then there's a hand, and there's a GoPro camera, and then there's a black hat right here.

02:41:28.337 --> 02:41:29.238
And that is me.

02:41:29.838 --> 02:41:36.823
That is me on the PBS NewsHour Frontline episode about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:41:36.943 --> 02:41:38.444
I guess my work is done here.

02:41:38.484 --> 02:41:40.105
This is my 15 minutes of fame.

02:41:40.125 --> 02:41:42.727
This is as close as I'm gonna get to the truth getting out.

02:41:42.787 --> 02:41:45.169
So enjoy it while it lasts, ladies and gentlemen.

02:41:46.178 --> 02:41:55.572
lifted their ban on his personal social media after he decided to run because they couldn't restrict a presidential candidate.

02:41:56.873 --> 02:41:59.757
It gives him a lot more headlines, a lot more media.

02:41:59.777 --> 02:42:01.760
It puts him back on people's radar.

02:42:03.067 --> 02:42:06.629
It was a political rally steeped in Kennedy family history.

02:42:06.709 --> 02:42:08.050
So they censored him.

02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:13.673
They censored him because the vaccine was so important and it worked so well.

02:42:14.053 --> 02:42:17.375
But then when he ran for president, they couldn't censor him anymore.

02:42:18.456 --> 02:42:19.776
That's what we're supposed to believe.

02:42:20.777 --> 02:42:27.741
So he's so clever and so rich that he got through the censorship because he's a Kennedy.

02:42:29.777 --> 02:42:31.299
of his father and uncle.

02:42:31.879 --> 02:42:46.110
You know, I remember going to a campaign rally for Bobby Kennedy, and the marquees in all the theaters were filled with these kind of AI-generated images of the younger Bobby Kennedy, kind of as this knight crusading on a horse.

02:42:46.911 --> 02:42:55.058
And in the background were the kind of ghostly figures of his father and his uncle, which is, I think, an apt metaphor.

02:42:56.431 --> 02:43:00.513
He's completing the 1968 campaign that his father never finished.

02:43:00.614 --> 02:43:05.196
I mean, it is truly like a sort of unashamed co-option of that legacy.

02:43:06.217 --> 02:43:10.880
A Kennedy political action committee even repurposed JFK's TV ad.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:12.521
Kennedy!

02:43:12.541 --> 02:43:13.021
Kennedy!

02:43:13.041 --> 02:43:13.561
Kennedy!

02:43:13.581 --> 02:43:14.082
Kennedy!

02:43:14.102 --> 02:43:15.142
Kennedy!

02:43:15.162 --> 02:43:15.983
Kennedy!

02:43:16.043 --> 02:43:16.563
Kennedy!

02:43:16.803 --> 02:43:17.824
Kennedy!

02:43:17.864 --> 02:43:18.845
Kennedy!

02:43:18.905 --> 02:43:19.725
Kennedy!

02:43:20.526 --> 02:43:23.507
And I should say, much of his family is very angry about that.

02:43:23.768 --> 02:43:24.368
Very angry.

02:43:26.511 --> 02:43:29.934
It was just tacky and opportunistic.

02:43:30.875 --> 02:43:36.779
He's in the position he's in for one reason, because his name is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:43:38.941 --> 02:43:40.682
See, that's the illusion.

02:43:41.443 --> 02:43:48.909
He's in this position for one reason and one reason only, because the national security state required him to be there.

02:43:54.229 --> 02:43:56.290
Forget his brother's dead, right?

02:43:56.330 --> 02:44:00.893
That was his brother that died, also of an overdose, because they were probably setting him up, too.

02:44:02.774 --> 02:44:06.516
He tried to deliver his unconventional message to a national audience.

02:44:07.756 --> 02:44:11.919
So in the first big network interview that he had was on ABC News.

02:44:12.899 --> 02:44:17.342
I sat down with him earlier today to ask him about his campaign and trying to take on the president.

02:44:17.961 --> 02:44:21.703
And man, get this footage, because it is extraordinary.

02:44:21.963 --> 02:44:26.626
They say, this interview you're about to see, we had to edit it to keep out untruths.

02:44:26.686 --> 02:44:32.009
I mean, isn't it weird that all of his friends are so happy to go on PBS NewsHour?

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:34.890
Do they assume that they're doing him a favor?

02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:39.613
This Gavin DeBecker guy comes off to me as a real backstabber, like yuck.

02:44:41.533 --> 02:44:45.716
We should note that during our conversation, Kennedy made false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines.

02:44:45.956 --> 02:44:51.439
We've used our editorial judgment in not including extended portions of that exchange in our interview.

02:44:52.380 --> 02:45:00.405
Facing a mainstream media that was going to fact-check him, he instead relied on the unfiltered world of podcasts and social media.

02:45:00.425 --> 02:45:07.089
— When the histories were written on Bobby Kennedy, one of the key attributes that led him to gain influence was independent media.

02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:09.191
And that's how I met Bobby.

02:45:11.534 --> 02:45:15.596
A podcast star.

02:45:25.001 --> 02:45:30.745
Ladies and gentlemen, PBS NewsHour and PBS Frontline have been admitting

02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:47.092
have been instructing you for the last several years that Substack and X are the new town square, the new journalism, and that podcasts are the new journalism, and the new news, and the new media.

02:45:47.512 --> 02:45:55.558
And now these people are cementing that idea once and for all that, you know, podcasts are where really shit happens, like,

02:45:56.278 --> 02:46:03.923
real discussions, and also real bad ideas, where people can raise millions of dollars with bad ideas on podcasts.

02:46:04.443 --> 02:46:08.826
And podcast stars get away with that all the time.

02:46:11.187 --> 02:46:13.088
Mr. Kennedy's presidential campaign.

02:46:14.149 --> 02:46:23.775
The lack of snark from independent media, the ability for Bobby to just talk, was a key driver for him because he was able to get outside of this media filter.

02:46:25.097 --> 02:46:31.959
the podcasting world that was full of people able to talk at length and without fact-checking.

02:46:33.019 --> 02:46:34.060
And he loved it.

02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:34.940
He was made for it.

02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:43.203
The CIA is ultimately working for industry, like the oil industry, the coal industry, and the military.

02:46:43.223 --> 02:46:43.963
It's weird, right?

02:46:43.983 --> 02:46:50.345
If he's made for it, then why didn't Spotify give him like a $100 million contract and make a shit ton of money from it?

02:46:51.149 --> 02:46:51.449
I don't know.

02:46:51.809 --> 02:46:54.431
Callie Means could also, you know, why not?

02:46:54.912 --> 02:46:55.712
Terry Contractor.

02:46:56.933 --> 02:47:03.797
He pulls strange facts from all over the place and pieces them into a picture that seems plausible, right?

02:47:03.937 --> 02:47:06.319
Even if it's completely fraudulent, it seems plausible.

02:47:06.359 --> 02:47:08.020
And that's all you need to do on a podcast.

02:47:09.001 --> 02:47:10.342
Wi-Fi radiation.

02:47:11.773 --> 02:47:16.577
It does all kinds of bad things, including causing cancer.

02:47:17.318 --> 02:47:18.779
Wi-Fi radiation causes cancer.

02:47:18.799 --> 02:47:19.579
Yeah, from your cell phone.

02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:21.261
I mean, cell phone tumors.

02:47:21.861 --> 02:47:24.884
He advances this idea in speaking to a number of people.

02:47:24.904 --> 02:47:30.428
100% of the people who died of the first thousand at what age were people who were addicted to poppers.

02:47:34.511 --> 02:47:36.193
Maybe Judy Mikovits told him that.

02:47:38.471 --> 02:47:43.735
He has argued in different points that the water is causing children to become transgender.

02:47:44.815 --> 02:47:46.777
Maybe Alex Jones told him that.

02:47:46.797 --> 02:47:53.622
The actual dysphoria that we're seeing, you know, these kids are being overwhelmed by a tsunami.

02:47:53.702 --> 02:47:59.267
I mean, they're swimming through a soup of toxic chemicals today, and many of those are endocrine disruptors.

02:48:00.568 --> 02:48:02.850
There's atrazine throughout our water supply.

02:48:03.772 --> 02:48:08.815
He ends up going where all conspiracy theories end up, which is with the Jews.

02:48:09.775 --> 02:48:16.138
He ends up going right into the antisemitic DNA of conspiracy theory.

02:48:16.699 --> 02:48:24.623
COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people.

02:48:25.603 --> 02:48:30.425
The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.

02:48:32.346 --> 02:48:33.247
And now you see.

02:48:36.243 --> 02:48:38.765
You know, you see exactly how the script worked.

02:48:40.546 --> 02:48:56.716
And you can see exactly how we were lured into solving the Scooby-Doo mystery, even though there were a lot of other retards following the same trail of breadcrumbs, we thought, well, you know... No, ladies and gentlemen, we were played.

02:48:57.537 --> 02:48:58.317
We were set up.

02:48:58.858 --> 02:49:05.702
He was scripted, and now they are using that script against him, just like it was written.

02:49:09.046 --> 02:49:12.168
And we don't know whether they were deliberately targeted in that or not.

02:49:13.329 --> 02:49:17.271
Regardless of the science, do you understand why people saw those remarks as anti-Semitic?

02:49:18.472 --> 02:49:22.935
Well, I can understand why people were disturbed by those remarks.

02:49:23.955 --> 02:49:25.476
They certainly weren't anti-Semitic.

02:49:25.696 --> 02:49:26.177
They were not?

02:49:26.337 --> 02:49:27.397
No, of course not.

02:49:27.838 --> 02:49:31.600
I was talking about a true study, an NIH-funded study.

02:49:33.441 --> 02:49:34.002
He knows better.

02:49:34.942 --> 02:49:36.023
You know, he's not an idiot.

02:49:37.648 --> 02:49:47.613
He knows what it means for somebody like him to start asking his followers to believe that somehow the Chinese and the Jews concocted COVID.

02:49:49.113 --> 02:50:04.001
It's not just that he's kind of- It's funny because that's basically what Kevin McCairn in Japan has been saying since the very beginning, that the Chinese and the Jews did it and that the Indians are heroes and that I'm taking money from the Mossad.

02:50:04.061 --> 02:50:06.922
I mean, it's pretty remarkable.

02:50:08.888 --> 02:50:10.970
I mean, I don't know how they can leave out Epstein.

02:50:11.231 --> 02:50:14.254
I mean, it just seems so obvious.

02:50:14.314 --> 02:50:17.918
If you haven't read Whitney Webb's books, you don't know anything.

02:50:18.078 --> 02:50:22.983
And they haven't mentioned Whitney Webb yet, so I don't know how I can take PBS News seriously anymore.

02:50:23.704 --> 02:50:31.072
Very far away from the progressive legacy of the Kennedys, he's moving right into the worst forms of reactionary thinking.

02:50:34.332 --> 02:50:36.752
It was too much for the rest of the Kennedy family.

02:50:37.613 --> 02:50:40.033
They distanced themselves with a photo op.

02:50:44.414 --> 02:50:50.715
We all went to the White House and spent time with President Biden and let him know that we were in his corner.

02:50:52.715 --> 02:50:54.116
It was very disturbing to Bobby.

02:50:54.136 --> 02:50:57.996
A lot of them were very close to Bobby and they loved him.

02:50:58.576 --> 02:50:59.717
And he was very close to them.

02:50:59.737 --> 02:51:01.057
He would call them all the time.

02:51:02.639 --> 02:51:03.399
My name is Joe Kennedy.

02:51:03.539 --> 02:51:04.419
I'm Carrie Kennedy.

02:51:04.439 --> 02:51:05.100
I'm Lori Kennedy.

02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:06.480
I'm Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.

02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:07.340
Chris Kennedy.

02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:09.541
And I'm here to proudly endorse Joe Biden.

02:51:09.601 --> 02:51:10.021
Joe Biden.

02:51:10.181 --> 02:51:10.741
Joe Biden.

02:51:11.761 --> 02:51:14.422
It was designed to send a message, and I think it did the job.

02:51:15.842 --> 02:51:20.683
I think it was covered nationally as, you know, this is a repudiation of RFK Jr.'

02:51:20.503 --> 02:51:22.184
's campaign.

02:51:23.924 --> 02:51:27.205
I think Joe Biden is the RFK of his generation.

02:51:27.785 --> 02:51:31.606
This is a president who embodies the Kennedy legacy.

02:51:33.993 --> 02:51:36.234
Bobby Kennedy's campaign was in trouble.

02:51:36.254 --> 02:51:38.495
They were running out of money.

02:51:39.575 --> 02:51:43.036
His campaign was already, you know, on fumes.

02:51:43.716 --> 02:51:49.899
Robert F. Kennedy is not going to be the next president of the United States, and it's looking more and more like he might not even impact the outcome.

02:51:50.579 --> 02:51:55.821
His poll numbers start to plummet and then sort of stagnate in the single digits.

02:51:57.842 --> 02:52:01.523
Running into that summer of 2024, it was pretty clear that he had no path to victory.

02:52:09.056 --> 02:52:10.009
Take a look at what happened.

02:52:18.544 --> 02:52:19.804
He is holding up his arm.

02:52:20.565 --> 02:52:21.705
He is pumping his fist.

02:52:22.045 --> 02:52:24.106
Law enforcement agencies are treating this.

02:52:24.286 --> 02:52:28.847
So it's the second time we've been shown this image in this series of videos.

02:52:29.668 --> 02:52:35.830
Second time we've been told that Trump was shot and shown quote-unquote evidence of it being shot.

02:52:36.330 --> 02:52:43.012
And now this is the second time that Del Bigtree is going to talk about how important it is that Donald Trump was actually shot.

02:52:44.153 --> 02:52:44.613
Remember,

02:52:45.478 --> 02:52:53.805
The Republican candidate in Jesse Ventura's book gets shot and that makes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:52:54.045 --> 02:52:55.947
become president in that book.

02:52:58.529 --> 02:53:00.010
As an attempt at assassination.

02:53:00.991 --> 02:53:09.377
The day that the assassination attempt occurred with President Trump, Bobby really wanted to talk to President Trump.

02:53:10.038 --> 02:53:12.080
And that phone call happened within a few hours.

02:53:13.186 --> 02:53:15.628
And it was, it was a bullet going around.

02:53:15.848 --> 02:53:18.870
You know, what do they call that, an AR-15 or something?

02:53:18.890 --> 02:53:19.650
That was a big gun.

02:53:20.110 --> 02:53:22.472
Those were pretty tough guns, right?

02:53:23.773 --> 02:53:26.634
President Trump then said to Bobby, I'm glad you called, Bobby.

02:53:27.695 --> 02:53:28.676
I've been wanting to talk to you.

02:53:30.177 --> 02:53:31.437
We should really work together.

02:53:31.457 --> 02:53:34.679
I would love you to do stuff.

02:53:34.759 --> 02:53:37.721
And I think it would be so good for New York and so good for you.

02:53:38.462 --> 02:53:39.222
And we're going to win.

02:53:39.662 --> 02:53:40.523
We're going to win.

02:53:42.841 --> 02:53:44.082
It was a lot on his shoulders.

02:53:45.683 --> 02:53:50.206
If I was to join President Trump, would he actually allow me to do anything?

02:53:50.286 --> 02:53:51.447
Does he really mean it?

02:53:53.188 --> 02:53:57.191
I think for Bobby, it came down to, if not Trump, then who?

02:53:59.252 --> 02:54:00.553
Kennedy wanted a seat at the table.

02:54:01.494 --> 02:54:06.557
His closest allies behind him were kind of saying, we don't really trust Trump, or, you know, we should do it.

02:54:07.978 --> 02:54:11.941
That was hotly debated in Bobby's actual family.

02:54:12.984 --> 02:54:24.411
I'm not talking about his siblings, his actual family, of his own kids and Cheryl and others who had very strong opinions at times against that idea.

02:54:26.092 --> 02:54:30.195
I wrote a document strongly opposing supporting the Trump candidacy.

02:54:35.618 --> 02:54:37.800
We all went to Hyannis Porter to discuss it.

02:54:39.428 --> 02:54:43.471
What does it mean to cross over and join someone like President Trump?

02:54:45.633 --> 02:54:47.815
It was intense.

02:54:48.035 --> 02:54:50.738
It was one of those moments I'll cherish and I'll never forget.

02:54:50.758 --> 02:55:00.226
The morning of the last day when we were discussing it, I woke up thinking, Bobby, you shouldn't do this.

02:55:00.646 --> 02:55:04.609
But I had this really sinking feeling that this isn't the right move for Bobby.

02:55:06.275 --> 02:55:10.138
I met him on the beach in front of the Kennedy Compound, and we walked on the beach.

02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:18.846
And I said, Bobby, you have run telling your story of addiction and saying that we have to overcome self-will.

02:55:20.247 --> 02:55:33.519
It's hard for me to imagine, if God is with us or is behind this, that what you're supposed to do is bow to the feet of someone who is probably the greatest personification of self-will.

02:55:34.926 --> 02:55:35.887
That's Donald Trump.

02:55:37.087 --> 02:55:38.768
Why would that be the case?

02:55:40.529 --> 02:55:45.712
And Bobby said, I want you to say all that today in front of my family, in front of everybody.

02:55:46.153 --> 02:55:47.093
It's a really good point.

02:55:48.734 --> 02:55:49.295
And so I did.

02:55:49.315 --> 02:55:52.757
I was amongst over a dozen people that weighed in that day.

02:55:52.777 --> 02:55:56.079
And I gave a very impassioned plea.

02:55:56.099 --> 02:56:02.162
I think I even had tears running down my face because we all just felt this beauty in Bobby.

02:56:02.242 --> 02:56:03.063
He's so

02:56:04.997 --> 02:56:09.119
honest and so empathetic and caring.

02:56:09.139 --> 02:56:14.421
And the image that many of us had of Trump was just the exact opposite of that.

02:56:16.442 --> 02:56:21.425
There was a lot of inner circle drama, angst in those days.

02:56:22.025 --> 02:56:29.789
But ultimately, he decided that without a path forward, he didn't want to just, you know, drop out with nothing.

02:56:30.973 --> 02:56:35.015
If he backed Trump and Trump won the White House, he could have meaningful power.

02:56:36.836 --> 02:56:44.500
And by the end of that day, it was pretty much a unanimous decision.

02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:47.622
This is the right move.

02:56:48.142 --> 02:56:49.323
Trump's your only way forward.

02:56:49.463 --> 02:56:50.183
Can we trust him?

02:56:50.404 --> 02:56:50.924
Who knows?

02:56:51.844 --> 02:56:54.686
But you don't really have any other options.

02:57:01.189 --> 02:57:11.738
Tonight I'm very pleased to welcome a man, he is a great person, I've known him for so long, for the past 16 months, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:17.623
People mentioned it was the loudest applause they've heard other than for President Trump.

02:57:18.924 --> 02:57:24.349
There was something electric about Bobby's acceptance into the MAGA community.

02:57:25.430 --> 02:57:27.612
I think Bobby was really energized by that.

02:57:33.325 --> 02:57:36.467
You have to imagine that kind of political attention is intoxicating.

02:57:38.268 --> 02:57:41.610
He never had that kind of rally size as a presidential candidate.

02:57:43.731 --> 02:57:48.594
That kind of access to the center of power is what he's in some ways been after his whole life.

02:57:50.095 --> 02:57:56.139
I don't think I've ever introduced anybody that got applause like that.

02:57:58.442 --> 02:58:03.403
The one addiction I think that he has now fully embraced is adulation.

02:58:04.384 --> 02:58:05.784
He goes where he can get it.

02:58:06.624 --> 02:58:11.205
I'm talking about finding adulation from conspiracy theorists, from anti-vaxxers.

02:58:13.246 --> 02:58:25.489
So what just doesn't make any sense about this, and I want to be very clear before I go to bed, is that these people believe that that crowd was reacting

02:58:26.385 --> 02:58:27.766
to the Kennedy name.

02:58:29.007 --> 02:58:50.806
The crowd was reacting to the Kennedy charm, or the Kennedy eyes, or... It's remarkable that these journalists actually believe that none of the people in the audience are discerning enough, that they're all fooled.

02:58:51.650 --> 02:58:56.252
that none of them believe in anything except for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:58:56.292 --> 02:59:01.534
They don't believe that maybe intramuscular injections, a bad idea from the late 1800s.

02:59:01.594 --> 02:59:03.795
Maybe they believe that RNA cannot pandemic.

02:59:03.835 --> 02:59:13.138
Maybe they believe that their kid was poisoned by a particular intramuscular injection, but they believed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:59:13.178 --> 02:59:17.680
was fighting for them, that CHD was fighting for them, that I can and

02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:21.301
And Del Bigtree was fighting for them, but they weren't.

02:59:21.421 --> 02:59:29.545
They were always a staged, sabotaged, predestined-to-fail movement.

02:59:32.086 --> 02:59:33.587
And Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

02:59:33.647 --> 02:59:35.427
doesn't need to know that.

02:59:36.168 --> 02:59:38.109
But Gavin DeBecker would need to know it.

02:59:39.369 --> 02:59:40.890
Mary Holland would need to know it.

02:59:40.930 --> 02:59:42.270
Meryl Nass would need to know it.

02:59:42.330 --> 02:59:43.831
Robert Malone would need to know it.

02:59:43.891 --> 02:59:46.092
A lot of people around him would need to know it.

02:59:47.844 --> 02:59:55.687
The rest of his objecting family wouldn't need to know it because they're behaving exactly as is required by the script on their own.

02:59:57.367 --> 03:00:01.129
That's the other part of a national security exercise you need to understand.

03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:05.050
If Pierre Cory's dumb enough to go along with it, then he's fine.

03:00:05.270 --> 03:00:05.830
That's great.

03:00:05.950 --> 03:00:06.591
He's useful.

03:00:07.751 --> 03:00:11.872
If Peter McCullough's dumb enough to go along with it, then he's useful.

03:00:11.932 --> 03:00:12.513
That's great.

03:00:12.933 --> 03:00:15.694
If Brett Weinstein's dumb enough to go along with it,

03:00:16.919 --> 03:00:21.182
If there's an actor that's willing to read the lines, then it's fine.

03:00:21.282 --> 03:00:21.762
It works.

03:00:22.242 --> 03:00:27.725
If there's a journalist that's dumb enough to believe that they think they've figured something out, then that's fine.

03:00:27.785 --> 03:00:28.485
They're useful.

03:00:30.807 --> 03:00:31.307
You know, like...

03:00:32.751 --> 03:00:48.958
Gay Stolberg, that we showed earlier, that was given the leaked, you know, bioethics whistleblowing report on Jesse Gelsinger all those years ago by Robert Malone, and she thinks her career was made because she was given the truth by a whistleblower.

03:00:49.958 --> 03:00:52.859
When in reality, it was just a staged event.

03:00:56.161 --> 03:00:58.162
Just like COVID is a staged event.

03:00:59.096 --> 03:01:02.397
The adult life of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:01:02.457 --> 03:01:07.920
is a staged event that goes back all the way to the murder of his dad and the murder of his uncle.

03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:18.204
Because the murderers of the Kennedys and the murderers of Estes Kefauver didn't just say, okay, job done, I guess we can leave now.

03:01:23.566 --> 03:01:26.167
From Trump voters, from the right wing,

03:01:27.793 --> 03:01:35.038
The Kennedy family was the epitome of Democrats and he has chased adulation past the definition of what Kennedys were supposed to be.

03:01:35.418 --> 03:01:46.566
And so by chasing adulation, by chasing his addictions and by being very charming and handsome and using the Kennedy name, he was able to make money.

03:01:46.586 --> 03:01:48.567
He was able to run for president.

03:01:49.127 --> 03:01:57.533
He was able to get all the way to HHS secretary, even though he's just an addicted loser, liar, fraud, right?

03:01:58.713 --> 03:01:59.634
Isn't that weird?

03:01:59.654 --> 03:02:08.919
His father, Robert Kennedy, a great man, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.

03:02:09.579 --> 03:02:15.762
And I know that they are looking down right now and they are very, very proud of Bobby.

03:02:15.782 --> 03:02:18.344
I'm proud of Bobby, you want to know the truth.

03:02:20.004 --> 03:02:26.948
You know, the actual legacy of his father is a legacy of progressive change.

03:02:29.026 --> 03:02:39.889
And the sun has ended up as really an important part to destroy whatever remnants of that legacy there might be.

03:02:44.611 --> 03:02:45.831
It was another reinvention.

03:02:46.231 --> 03:02:50.413
Remnants of that legacy there might be.

03:02:50.453 --> 03:02:56.834
It's really too bad that Donald Trump's thumb is actually on the knuckle of

03:02:58.906 --> 03:03:00.306
of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

03:03:00.266 --> 03:03:00.606
's hand.

03:03:00.706 --> 03:03:03.927
It's actually really too bad.

03:03:06.588 --> 03:03:08.308
Why do they show these handshakes?

03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:15.610
It was another reinvention.

03:03:16.971 --> 03:03:21.252
For now, less talk about vaccines and a new catchphrase.

03:03:22.032 --> 03:03:26.233
And don't you want a president that's going to make America healthy again?

03:03:29.514 --> 03:03:39.440
to make America healthy again, he built this new wing onto the MAGA movement, his own space where we knew he could live.

03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:41.481
It was brilliant.

03:03:42.402 --> 03:03:44.503
And the MAHA movement was born in that moment.

03:03:46.404 --> 03:03:51.428
And don't we deserve a president of the United States that's going to make America healthy again?

03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.989
Turning point.

03:03:54.509 --> 03:03:56.631
Make America healthy again.

03:03:58.576 --> 03:03:59.759
Nobody can argue with that.

03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:09.722
When I saw Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

03:04:09.702 --> 03:04:21.152
's speech, I just realized at that moment that, oh my goodness, we might actually have a chance to fix the food system.

03:04:21.392 --> 03:04:28.438
And so this is a woman who apparently made a lot of fame and fortune on the internet being the food babe.

03:04:29.241 --> 03:04:34.726
because she's pretty and she talks about food, but she's not concerned about vaccines at all.

03:04:34.786 --> 03:04:44.535
And even after meeting all these people and being in all of these alternative meetings, she's not concerned about vaccines at all, which leads me to believe that she's probably full of shit.

03:04:44.975 --> 03:04:51.881
I know there's a lot of people out there that like the food babe, but I think she's probably just a very pretty girl on a script.

03:04:52.722 --> 03:04:55.784
And it's unfortunate, but that's what I see.

03:04:56.565 --> 03:05:01.210
I see it in a lot of them because, again, you got to have some progress.

03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:14.285
You can't think about like, oh, we got to get all the bad dyes out of our cereal and then focus on that and focus on that and focus on that and focus on that as if there are no other problems in the world.

03:05:15.114 --> 03:05:26.856
You know, like when, I don't know, a hundred thousand or 120,000 Americans are dying of opioids every year, like bad opioids, opioids from China or somewhere and, or India.

03:05:27.176 --> 03:05:29.176
And we're not doing shit about it.

03:05:29.236 --> 03:05:33.157
Even though we have an addicted guy at HHS.

03:05:33.697 --> 03:05:34.117
Really?

03:05:34.137 --> 03:05:34.257
Really?

03:05:35.657 --> 03:05:44.359
Donald Trump can bomb boats, but we don't talk about the Americans that are being killed by the drugs on the boats that he's bombing.

03:05:48.149 --> 03:05:51.752
Don't you want a president who's going to get the chemicals out of our food?

03:05:54.554 --> 03:05:55.454
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:05:55.474 --> 03:05:58.336
did not really talk about food until the end of 2024.

03:06:00.218 --> 03:06:06.762
That was not really a top talking point for him until you saw the Maha movement get launched.

03:06:06.882 --> 03:06:09.784
It was somewhat of a rebrand for him, so to speak.

03:06:11.606 --> 03:06:13.207
And a very populist one at that.

03:06:14.793 --> 03:06:17.056
Nobody gets a standing ovation like that.

03:06:17.116 --> 03:06:18.317
What's going on over here?

03:06:20.200 --> 03:06:26.768
Suddenly, now, everywhere you're going, it's another room of 20,000 to 40,000 people jumping to their feet and cheering.

03:06:28.055 --> 03:06:31.037
It was like suddenly you knew you had a rock star.

03:06:31.057 --> 03:06:32.378
Isn't that funny?

03:06:32.418 --> 03:06:36.280
Because we only saw it once but apparently Del saw it lots of times.

03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:40.803
We just saw another clip of Donald Trump saying, wow we never get it.

03:06:41.143 --> 03:06:42.384
That was that turning point.

03:06:42.444 --> 03:06:44.585
So how many times did they do that?

03:06:45.786 --> 03:06:46.987
Bobby was a rock star.

03:06:47.627 --> 03:06:49.228
Finally he had a hit song.

03:06:50.909 --> 03:06:51.790
And it was going crazy.

03:06:57.719 --> 03:07:07.745
It's almost like Del Bigtree has been scripted to play this sort of lapdog worshipper that has been fallen under the spell of the false savior, isn't it?

03:07:07.865 --> 03:07:15.029
It's almost like he's been scripted to play that exact role in a PBS Frontline documentary.

03:07:16.690 --> 03:07:19.572
Washington is if we get Donald Trump elected.

03:07:22.153 --> 03:07:26.576
And on election night, Bobby Kennedy's deal with Donald Trump paid off.

03:07:28.797 --> 03:07:32.639
Former President Trump once again becomes President-elect Trump.

03:07:32.719 --> 03:07:37.682
President Trump surprised across the country, across every demographic group.

03:07:38.802 --> 03:07:41.384
Our future was hanging in the balance over Trump winning.

03:07:42.204 --> 03:07:45.946
So I have to say, the moment he won is a huge relief.

03:07:46.927 --> 03:07:48.768
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he came in.

03:07:51.087 --> 03:07:55.370
And he's going to help make America healthy again.

03:07:59.833 --> 03:08:02.916
We were so elated, and it was almost like, oh, we did it.

03:08:04.657 --> 03:08:08.720
And then the next morning, you know, it sort of sunk in.

03:08:08.740 --> 03:08:12.423
Wait a minute, Bobby's still got to get confirmed.

03:08:12.443 --> 03:08:13.864
There's still a vote that has to happen.

03:08:15.737 --> 03:08:16.918
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:08:17.178 --> 03:08:20.380
is Mr. Trump's pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services.

03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:29.666
If confirmed, Kennedy would be in charge of the CDC, National Institutes of Health, with a budget of nearly $2 trillion annually.

03:08:30.586 --> 03:08:32.808
What's on the line for him is something he's wanted for years.

03:08:34.049 --> 03:08:38.231
It's a seat of power that he's never held at that level.

03:08:38.251 --> 03:08:43.354
I mean, being a cabinet secretary is a huge political advancement for him, obviously.

03:08:44.591 --> 03:08:49.034
And it's also a culmination of his years of feeling like he's on the outside.

03:08:50.335 --> 03:08:51.916
Now he would be the one making the decision.

03:08:51.936 --> 03:08:57.280
— To get there, Kennedy would first have to go before the United States Senate.

03:08:57.300 --> 03:09:00.602
— This could also be a long road ahead for Senate confirmation.

03:09:00.622 --> 03:09:04.745
— There undoubtedly will be some heated reaction to this pick.

03:09:04.765 --> 03:09:14.111
— Dear Senators, now that Bobby has been nominated by President Trump to be Secretary of Health and Human Services,

03:09:14.833 --> 03:09:19.174
a position that would put him in charge of the health of the American people.

03:09:20.034 --> 03:09:21.755
I feel an obligation to speak out.

03:09:22.995 --> 03:09:26.596
Bobby's cousin Caroline is President John F. Kennedy's daughter.

03:09:27.376 --> 03:09:29.057
She wrote a letter to key senators.

03:09:30.557 --> 03:09:31.477
I talked to Caroline.

03:09:32.818 --> 03:09:33.718
She showed me the letter.

03:09:35.112 --> 03:09:45.234
And I said, look, I think you should send it because if there's any chance of derailing the nomination, we have to do our best.

03:09:46.294 --> 03:10:02.478
Overseeing the FDA, the NIH, the CDC, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agencies that are charged with protecting the most vulnerable among us, is an enormous responsibility and one that Bobby is unqualified to fill.

03:10:03.516 --> 03:10:05.638
Caroline's letter was the real shocker.

03:10:06.518 --> 03:10:11.782
If you listen to his cousin Caroline, there was a cruel side to him.

03:10:11.802 --> 03:10:14.264
I've known Bobby my whole life.

03:10:14.304 --> 03:10:15.324
We grew up together.

03:10:16.045 --> 03:10:23.350
Don't forget that that Times reporter there, Stolberg, was the one that Robert Malone claims to have set up with Jesse Gelsinger's story way back when.

03:10:24.371 --> 03:10:29.974
It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because Bobby himself is a predator.

03:10:31.476 --> 03:10:32.096
His basement

03:10:32.506 --> 03:10:43.148
His garage, his dorm room were always the center of the action, where drugs were available and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in a blender to feed to his hawks.

03:10:45.169 --> 03:10:48.489
It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.

03:10:51.150 --> 03:11:00.032
Siblings and cousins who Bobby encouraged down the path of substance abuse suffered addiction, illness, and death.

03:11:00.652 --> 03:11:02.272
While Bobby has gone on

03:11:02.984 --> 03:11:06.647
to misrepresent lies and cheat his way through life.

03:11:13.151 --> 03:11:14.772
Confirmation hearings are happening today.

03:11:15.212 --> 03:11:15.993
RFK Jr.

03:11:16.053 --> 03:11:17.234
for HHS secretary.

03:11:17.254 --> 03:11:20.436
The question is, will lawmakers actually listen to Caroline Kennedy?

03:11:21.337 --> 03:11:25.820
In addition to Caroline Kennedy's attack, the Democrats on the committee joined in.

03:11:27.981 --> 03:11:36.966
He has made it his life's work to sow doubt and discourage parents from getting their kids life-saving vaccines.

03:11:37.827 --> 03:11:40.389
Your voice would be a voice that parents would listen to.

03:11:40.549 --> 03:11:41.689
That is so dangerous.

03:11:41.909 --> 03:11:47.533
I will be voting against your nomination because your views are dangerous to our state and to our country.

03:11:48.694 --> 03:11:55.778
When was it that you decided to sell out the values you've had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?

03:11:57.705 --> 03:12:04.671
One thing that I've been struck by in my interviews with him over the years, there's kind of this like latent, this kind of seething anger to him.

03:12:04.691 --> 03:12:09.215
And I saw some of that in the hearings, you know, especially when he was questioned by the Democratic senators.

03:12:10.536 --> 03:12:13.119
Senator, there are 91,000 employees.

03:12:13.159 --> 03:12:16.402
So that, I take that as a, I take it, that's a simple yes and I'm going to take that as a no.

03:12:16.482 --> 03:12:18.423
Do you think I can run that agency without any medicine?

03:12:18.443 --> 03:12:18.984
I take that as a no.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:27.563
That's amazing because now I think what we're seeing is very clearly a guy who was played for his whole life.

03:12:28.983 --> 03:12:31.284
Believes a lot of the things he's been told.

03:12:31.404 --> 03:12:33.785
Believes a lot of the myths he's been told.

03:12:34.286 --> 03:12:45.550
Believes what he's been told by Robert Malone, Kevin McKernan, Mary Holland and Meryl Nass and Gavin DeBecker for many years.

03:12:47.051 --> 03:12:48.658
That's why he's where he is.

03:12:48.718 --> 03:12:50.928
That's why he behaves the way he behaves.

03:12:54.622 --> 03:12:59.803
I was struck by the demeanor that he showed toward senators.

03:12:59.823 --> 03:13:05.045
He was not afraid to take on senators and to berate them.

03:13:05.065 --> 03:13:08.146
It kind of shows you that this is not your ordinary cabinet secretary.

03:13:18.277 --> 03:13:22.059
is someone who feels himself to be equal to these senators.

03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:26.322
He's there calling Bernie Sanders Bernie instead of Senator.

03:13:27.022 --> 03:13:36.688
And by the way, Bernie, almost all the members of this panel are accepting, including yourself, are accepting millions of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry.

03:13:37.369 --> 03:13:38.189
Oh, no, no, no.

03:13:38.249 --> 03:13:39.410
And protecting their interests.

03:13:41.596 --> 03:13:47.979
It was hard to watch hour upon hour of just this vomiting upon Bobby, and it didn't matter what he said.

03:13:47.999 --> 03:13:57.965
You're watching someone that is now having to navigate politics and handle very difficult questions.

03:13:57.985 --> 03:13:59.385
That's not the question.

03:13:59.546 --> 03:14:07.430
You and I, you have said — You're asking me, Senator — The Democrats look mean, angry, spiteful.

03:14:10.060 --> 03:14:14.861
It was like watching one of your best friends try to fight with both of his hands tied behind his back.

03:14:17.422 --> 03:14:20.783
But I thought he did a brilliant job under those circumstances.

03:14:21.884 --> 03:14:29.006
Despite years of railing against vaccines, he tried to reassure senators that he wouldn't do away with them once in power.

03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:31.922
I support the measles vaccine.

03:14:32.022 --> 03:14:33.684
I support the polio vaccine.

03:14:33.824 --> 03:14:42.192
I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking either of those vaccines.

03:14:42.432 --> 03:14:53.423
It was pretty obvious that he was trying to hide who he was, and it was unclear if the senators voting on his confirmation believed him or just didn't care to look into it any more deeply.

03:14:57.984 --> 03:14:59.986
The question occurs on the Kennedy nomination.

03:15:01.067 --> 03:15:01.988
Clerk, call the roll.

03:15:03.069 --> 03:15:04.570
Senators voting in the affirmative.

03:15:05.171 --> 03:15:08.634
Bozeman, Cornyn, Crapo, Graham.

03:15:09.535 --> 03:15:22.828
He's obviously somebody who revels in his power, who believes he deserves this power, who believes that he could have been president, should have been president, who believes he can run an American health care system.

03:15:23.655 --> 03:15:26.117
On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are 48.

03:15:26.157 --> 03:15:27.898
The confirmation is confirmed.

03:15:30.079 --> 03:15:32.340
That was the Senate confirming Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:15:32.380 --> 03:15:34.362
as Secretary of Health and Human Services.

03:15:34.582 --> 03:15:36.763
Not a single Democrat voted for Kennedy.

03:15:36.983 --> 03:15:38.704
Kennedy was quickly sworn in.

03:15:38.764 --> 03:15:42.586
He will now preside over a $1.7 trillion budget.

03:15:45.748 --> 03:15:53.133
I think it was the ultimate redemption for all the struggles that he has gone through in his career.

03:15:54.451 --> 03:15:56.892
and all the attacks, it was the ultimate redemption.

03:15:59.374 --> 03:16:18.665
It is a token of just how extraordinary the times we're living in are, that a figure who's so fundamentally at odds with science, with evidence, with truth, ends up in the position of power, which is built completely on all of those things.

03:16:20.083 --> 03:16:28.614
What's a department of health if it's not a department of evidence, if it's not a department of science, if it's not a department of trying to match rational means to rational ends?

03:16:29.815 --> 03:16:33.380
All the things that he has denied, he's sort of ended up in charge of.

03:16:51.058 --> 03:16:52.439
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:16:52.499 --> 03:16:55.882
is now the nation's Secretary of Health and Human Services, officially.

03:16:55.982 --> 03:16:57.583
The Maha movement has begun.

03:16:57.603 --> 03:17:02.266
As the new HHS secretary says, the future of public health is about to change forever.

03:17:03.307 --> 03:17:08.651
He perceives the agencies that he is running as the enemy.

03:17:10.339 --> 03:17:15.323
as corrupt and in need of being dismantled.

03:17:16.363 --> 03:17:20.646
Whether it's CDC, NIH, FDA, throughout COVID, they all lied.

03:17:21.067 --> 03:17:24.849
Look at what CDC and NIH's and FDA's behavior during COVID.

03:17:24.929 --> 03:17:26.150
What are they showing you here?

03:17:26.230 --> 03:17:27.651
Governance by podcast.

03:17:27.851 --> 03:17:32.094
A minute ago, they were bitching because, you know, he got to go on podcasts and say whatever he wants.

03:17:32.575 --> 03:17:38.699
And then now they're going to show you all that stuff and pretend that they couldn't do anything about it because that's how podcasts work.

03:17:39.933 --> 03:17:47.096
These are industries that are not doing public health, they are doing pharmaceutical profit promotion.

03:17:48.516 --> 03:17:56.980
Mr. Kennedy was in direct control of agencies that he had been saying for years were criminal organizations captured by big pharma.

03:17:57.300 --> 03:17:59.501
The CDC vaccine branch has really

03:18:00.307 --> 03:18:00.667
Tucker Carlson.

03:18:00.687 --> 03:18:04.069
He said openly that American government employees were poisoning the American public.

03:18:04.129 --> 03:18:07.710
Now that he's reached this ascent of power, it's time for him to deliver.

03:18:23.035 --> 03:18:29.339
Kennedy comes in and it's literally like one big Trump Apprentice show, like, you're fired.

03:18:29.620 --> 03:18:31.241
You know, everybody's fired.

03:18:31.841 --> 03:18:33.582
Growing lines of confusion.

03:18:33.722 --> 03:18:37.025
Employees turned away, told they no longer had jobs.

03:18:37.285 --> 03:18:41.788
Cutting 20,000 people from the department, a quarter of its workforce.

03:18:42.822 --> 03:18:52.948
If any CEO comes into a company, you expect they're going to immediately start doing interviews and weed out who has moved this company in the wrong direction.

03:18:54.689 --> 03:19:00.712
If you find scientists that were willing to compromise the truth, you've got to cut that out.

03:19:01.232 --> 03:19:04.794
Among those fired, top doctors, researchers, and disease trackers.

03:19:04.854 --> 03:19:09.697
The layoffs are hitting everywhere from the FDA to CDC and national institutes of health.

03:19:10.771 --> 03:19:19.939
CDC and FDA were looked at, as well as NIH, as essentially the jewels in the world's crown of public health agencies.

03:19:20.140 --> 03:19:21.941
And now, what are they?

03:19:22.562 --> 03:19:24.323
They're shadows of their former selves.

03:19:24.343 --> 03:19:32.591
— Dr. Peter Marks, that architect of Trump's Project Warp Speed, was a high-profile casualty of those early cuts.

03:19:32.611 --> 03:19:35.734
— Peter Marks abruptly resigning, saying that RFK Jr.

03:19:35.774 --> 03:19:37.055
is posing a danger to the public.

03:19:37.668 --> 03:19:41.450
Marx expressed concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

03:19:41.410 --> 03:19:43.611
's lack of confidence in vaccines.

03:19:44.551 --> 03:19:49.854
He's pushing back against people who've told him he's a fraud and a crank and endangering people's lives.

03:19:51.095 --> 03:19:59.099
There's certainly an element of revenge that you can see in his actions as the secretary.

03:19:59.999 --> 03:20:01.640
They all know what he's thinking.

03:20:02.568 --> 03:20:06.131
It's very hard to see what was built over my 13 years at FDA.

03:20:06.151 --> 03:20:08.152
Yeah, he was resigned, but he got cut.

03:20:08.212 --> 03:20:15.117
And during my nine years as center director, essentially destroyed or largely destroyed.

03:20:15.237 --> 03:20:18.680
So it's very sad to me.

03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:19.941
Oh, please.

03:20:20.341 --> 03:20:21.002
What a liar.

03:20:21.022 --> 03:20:21.662
Where it's gone.

03:20:21.982 --> 03:20:22.803
What a liar.

03:20:26.345 --> 03:20:28.147
It was chilling when Friedenmarks was pushed out.

03:20:29.639 --> 03:20:31.480
That was probably the first signal.

03:20:32.200 --> 03:20:38.502
I was like, okay, so yeah, they're coming for vaccine policy, they're coming for COVID vaccines, they're coming for the science-based recommendations.

03:20:39.383 --> 03:20:45.605
He quickly took aim at the CDC's panel of experts that recommends vaccination policy, ACIP.

03:20:45.825 --> 03:20:46.446
Oh no.

03:20:47.606 --> 03:20:50.247
There were 17 members of this panel.

03:20:51.467 --> 03:20:52.888
Kennedy fires them all.

03:20:53.708 --> 03:20:55.569
Still the same lady, wow.

03:20:55.629 --> 03:20:57.630
Two weeks before their scheduled meeting.

03:20:59.059 --> 03:21:09.644
For those of us that believe that the regulatory agencies have been committing fraud, removing the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was one of the greatest moves that has ever taken place.

03:21:11.185 --> 03:21:23.490
And then they announced the people who were coming on, and those folks have a lot of baggage around vaccines and have been outspoken about their opposition of vaccines.

03:21:25.051 --> 03:21:28.653
Dr. Havers was scheduled to deliver a presentation to the committee.

03:21:30.390 --> 03:21:34.651
I did not want to participate in what he was turning into a sham process.

03:21:36.212 --> 03:21:39.072
They're clearly not doing this in good faith anymore.

03:21:40.013 --> 03:21:41.073
They're not playing by the rules.

03:21:41.113 --> 03:21:43.874
They're not using gold standard science.

03:21:43.914 --> 03:21:45.034
They're not using evidence.

03:21:45.914 --> 03:21:50.376
I didn't feel like I could sort of legitimize this committee by presenting to them and presenting the data to them.

03:21:50.976 --> 03:21:53.997
And for like my own personal integrity, that was the moment I was like, I'm out.

03:21:55.037 --> 03:21:55.717
They all quit.

03:21:55.777 --> 03:21:58.858
I just couldn't participate any longer in what he'd made a complete sham.

03:22:00.233 --> 03:22:03.275
But Kennedy's supporters liked the direction he was going.

03:22:03.296 --> 03:22:12.903
— It felt like, finally, we were going to be able to have science take a priority over public policy and public health.

03:22:13.444 --> 03:22:27.715
It felt like there was going to be a— — It feels significant to me that they're choosing Lynn Redwood instead of, let's say, Mary Holland or— not really, Mary Holland wouldn't be a good choice,

03:22:28.735 --> 03:22:30.755
but Laura Bono.

03:22:30.775 --> 03:22:42.157
— A real push to be able to stop a lot of the corporate capture of our federal regulatory agencies.

03:22:43.677 --> 03:22:53.159
— Good morning, everybody, and welcome back to the— — Lynn Redwood became Kennedy's special advisor and addressed the committee.

03:22:53.179 --> 03:22:57.200
— The next presenter is Lynn Redwood, so please.

03:22:57.220 --> 03:22:58.260
— Thank you, Martin.

03:22:59.229 --> 03:23:07.395
For those of us that know his story, it was a historic moment to see Lynn Redwood get up and present at the ACIP meeting.

03:23:08.096 --> 03:23:14.341
The use of thimerosal and over-the-counter products is not generally recognized as safe or effective.

03:23:15.241 --> 03:23:21.726
Lynn Redwood came in and presented data on thimerosal, which was, frankly, science that had been debunked.

03:23:22.447 --> 03:23:27.491
Removing a known neurotoxin is a good place to start with making America healthy again.

03:23:29.059 --> 03:23:31.540
Kennedy's committee voted to ban thimerosal.

03:23:32.060 --> 03:23:34.961
The secretary has signed off on a ban on thimerosal.

03:23:35.021 --> 03:23:39.102
A major move, banning a mercury-based preservative from all vaccines.

03:23:40.623 --> 03:23:44.024
To see him remove that, that had to be a cathartic moment.

03:23:45.504 --> 03:23:46.705
Robert Kennedy Jr.

03:23:46.745 --> 03:23:52.327
had essentially destroyed his career by getting into a conversation about mercury in vaccines.

03:23:53.807 --> 03:23:56.068
The Rolling Stone article being retracted.

03:23:57.196 --> 03:24:00.897
This is what drove him into his investigation of vaccines.

03:24:00.917 --> 03:24:08.418
— He's already gutted a vaccine advisory committee, he's cut billions to state health agencies, and canceled an ad campaign for the flu shot.

03:24:08.438 --> 03:24:11.619
— He's the same person he's been for the last 20 years.

03:24:12.719 --> 03:24:13.880
I think he's a man on a mission.

03:24:13.900 --> 03:24:19.501
— Dr. Paul Offit, who served as a vaccine advisor to the FDA, was also pushed out.

03:24:20.356 --> 03:24:28.381
His mission is to eliminate chronic diseases, and he believes that the best way to do that is to make vaccines less available, less affordable, and more effluent.

03:24:28.401 --> 03:24:30.923
And if he had an opportunity, he would eliminate vaccines.

03:24:31.383 --> 03:24:32.544
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:24:32.584 --> 03:24:36.906
announced he's shutting down nearly half a billion dollars in mRNA research.

03:24:37.287 --> 03:24:40.489
mRNA shots were first used during the COVID-19 pandemic.

03:24:49.935 --> 03:24:51.556
then a crisis.

03:24:53.077 --> 03:24:55.939
Atlanta 911, what is the location of your emergency?

03:24:56.439 --> 03:24:59.121
Across the street from the CDC, there's an active shooter.

03:24:59.141 --> 03:25:01.782
Oh my God.

03:25:03.624 --> 03:25:10.508
I was on the fifth floor of building 16 when we started hearing the sound of the bullets.

03:25:15.802 --> 03:25:19.925
It was very loud and it was very repetitive.

03:25:20.145 --> 03:25:22.607
And so many of us thought that this was a jackhammer.

03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:30.933
And then the tornado siren went off over at Emory.

03:25:34.255 --> 03:25:37.177
That indicated to us that this was real.

03:25:37.978 --> 03:25:39.379
These are shots hitting the building.

03:25:39.399 --> 03:25:43.582
And then there was just glass all over the place.

03:25:46.101 --> 03:25:47.021
Another U.S.

03:25:47.081 --> 03:25:50.742
shooting, this time outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta.

03:25:50.842 --> 03:25:57.183
The gunman fired more than 500 shots, striking buildings on the CDC campus nearly 200 times.

03:25:57.463 --> 03:26:03.445
When it was all over, the gunman and 33-year-old officer David Rose were both dead.

03:26:04.925 --> 03:26:06.705
Chilling new details about the suspect.

03:26:06.765 --> 03:26:10.666
He blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal.

03:26:10.686 --> 03:26:14.407
The suspect blamed the CDC for an illness that he possibly had.

03:26:15.489 --> 03:26:27.040
When I saw that it was due to COVID misinformation, I was very angry that because of misinformation that was out there, it resulted in harm to Officer Rose and longtime trauma for my staff.

03:26:28.542 --> 03:26:32.365
Dr. Deborah Aure was the highest-ranking scientist at the CDC.

03:26:33.066 --> 03:26:37.991
They truly felt targeted because they were CDC and the work that's being done.

03:26:40.137 --> 03:26:47.543
Some of our staff who'd work on vaccine science or other high-profile topics don't want to present publicly right now and don't want their names on papers.

03:26:49.144 --> 03:26:54.187
They're concerned about their own personal safety because of this, and it's been propelled by misinformation.

03:26:56.609 --> 03:27:02.774
The shots are, I think, only metaphorical for the shots that we've had flung at us for the last five years.

03:27:04.324 --> 03:27:17.353
All of the dehumanization of the public health workforce that has happened, with Secretary Kennedy being one of the dehumanizers, I think has created the environment where such violence is tolerated.

03:27:22.977 --> 03:27:28.501
The Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., visited the CDC headquarters.

03:27:28.621 --> 03:27:32.464
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who criticized the vaccine and the CDC in the past,

03:27:35.598 --> 03:27:37.218
That was the first time he'd been to CDC.

03:27:38.018 --> 03:27:39.339
And it was a fairly brief visit.

03:27:41.419 --> 03:27:43.740
I actually did tour the facility with Secretary Kennedy.

03:27:44.620 --> 03:27:46.020
That was the only time I'd ever met him.

03:27:47.020 --> 03:27:51.601
And he seemed, you know, really surprised by the extent of the damage.

03:27:53.781 --> 03:28:00.003
Each bullet or each shattered glass, that was meant for a person.

03:28:00.083 --> 03:28:01.523
That was meant for one of our staff.

03:28:05.060 --> 03:28:11.303
The staff were deeply concerned that we had a secretary that had been demeaning the agency.

03:28:12.584 --> 03:28:21.909
And they were calling for him to make statements against that, to really correct the record, indicate that vaccines are safe.

03:28:23.390 --> 03:28:29.353
I come from a family that lost two of its members to political violence, and it's always wrong.

03:28:30.285 --> 03:28:37.389
So what is the plan to sort of quell disinformation, misinformation, so that something like this doesn't happen again?

03:28:37.409 --> 03:28:45.054
Well, you know, I would not say that this — we don't know enough about what the motive was of this individual.

03:28:46.274 --> 03:28:48.836
But people can ask questions.

03:28:49.736 --> 03:28:53.799
In light of what he had just seen, I was very disappointed.

03:28:55.993 --> 03:29:00.916
I was hoping that he would defend the agency, and that didn't happen.

03:29:02.778 --> 03:29:07.701
I'm sure he would say, why is it his responsibility that some guy showed up with a gun at the CDC?

03:29:09.322 --> 03:29:16.027
Kennedy is often able to kind of play this role of, like, hyping people up and then kind of distancing himself from the impact.

03:29:18.715 --> 03:29:27.618
Deepening the crisis for Kennedy, his new CDC director, Susan Monaras, contradicted him, blaming misinformation for the shooting.

03:29:28.879 --> 03:29:34.521
The dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.

03:29:35.601 --> 03:29:41.843
It was important for the staff to hear that, but also it's a statement of fact that that's what happened.

03:29:43.124 --> 03:29:46.725
So in that sense, the staff were pleased to see that coming from the director.

03:29:48.624 --> 03:29:51.146
I think that public statement is a very dangerous statement.

03:29:52.408 --> 03:29:55.811
I think it's dangerous when we attribute why things are happening.

03:29:56.311 --> 03:30:01.656
That's an opinion that fuels rage in a lot of hearts and minds.

03:30:01.977 --> 03:30:11.546
When you start seeing scientists making opinions that are going to affect millions of people's attitudes and lives without scientific evidence, I think that's a problem.

03:30:12.776 --> 03:30:15.959
the shooting inflamed tensions between Kennedy and Monares.

03:30:16.760 --> 03:30:22.585
In a meeting, he demanded she fire top staff and commit to support his vaccine agenda.

03:30:22.605 --> 03:30:26.329
— Susan called me right after, was very upset.

03:30:27.169 --> 03:30:32.354
She told the secretary she also stood behind, like, data and science, and she couldn't rubber-stamp recommendations.

03:30:32.414 --> 03:30:36.218
She couldn't agree to sign off on vaccine recommendations before she had seen it.

03:30:37.441 --> 03:30:43.305
tumult at the CDC as the Department of Health and Human Services announces the director of the CDC is out.

03:30:43.785 --> 03:30:47.547
Susan Monterrez was at odds with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:30:47.748 --> 03:30:49.629
over his COVID vaccine policies.

03:30:50.538 --> 03:30:52.620
I mean, who's in charge, right?

03:30:52.740 --> 03:30:54.261
In this case, Robert Kennedy Jr.

03:30:54.281 --> 03:31:01.106
is in charge, and he's trying to triage the worst health situation this country has ever found itself in.

03:31:01.807 --> 03:31:04.689
You don't have time to have disagreement around you.

03:31:04.869 --> 03:31:07.971
Get someone in here that agrees with where we're going, and let's do this.

03:31:07.991 --> 03:31:15.057
— Menard is a staunch supporter of vaccines, and her ouster comes as Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, moves to reshape the government's approach.

03:31:15.077 --> 03:31:19.720
— For many of the CDC's top scientists, it was the last straw.

03:31:20.598 --> 03:31:26.481
With her removal, I think was what brought the other two doctors and myself to resign.

03:31:27.661 --> 03:31:29.882
I told her the second she left, I was gone.

03:31:31.003 --> 03:31:36.765
I saw all of the scientific endeavors starting to become like weaponized into an ideology machine, and I had to leave.

03:31:39.666 --> 03:31:49.811
I see the reality-based community trying to alert the public that there is something fantastical and crazy going on inside that world.

03:31:50.672 --> 03:32:01.441
the direction that the country... And so this guy with the glasses there in the middle, the CDC guy, is the one that they supposedly had pictures of him in bondage leather and stuff like that.

03:32:01.481 --> 03:32:02.481
It's so stupid.

03:32:02.501 --> 03:32:07.345
Dmitry's public health is going is not one that is evidence-based or science-based.

03:32:07.766 --> 03:32:10.087
America's public health is significantly in danger.

03:32:10.408 --> 03:32:14.771
And Dmitry, Dan, and I chose to leave together to send that bat signal.

03:32:15.852 --> 03:32:19.335
For Bobby Kennedy Jr., it's probably just evidence that he's right.

03:32:20.509 --> 03:32:23.512
That's what he's been saying for the last 20 years every time somebody resisted him.

03:32:24.292 --> 03:32:27.315
You know, it was just like, more evidence that I must be on the right path.

03:32:27.696 --> 03:32:30.578
You know, the CDC is an agency that is very troubled.

03:32:31.419 --> 03:32:38.846
And it's going to require getting rid of some people over the long term in order for us to change the institutional culture.

03:32:40.067 --> 03:32:41.568
He's able to continually spin it.

03:32:42.452 --> 03:32:48.356
You know, I have found people who aren't towing the line who are your enemy, and I'm getting rid of them.

03:32:48.396 --> 03:32:48.977
Are they leaving?

03:32:49.017 --> 03:32:50.798
He's constantly able to spin it that way.

03:32:51.458 --> 03:32:56.822
There's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency.

03:32:57.703 --> 03:33:00.505
And we need to fix it, and we are fixing it.

03:33:01.826 --> 03:33:03.447
CDC is in a bad place.

03:33:04.227 --> 03:33:11.832
It's a very specific and important agency for the U.S., and right now it's coding in the ICU.

03:33:12.652 --> 03:33:13.433
It's on life support.

03:33:14.953 --> 03:33:15.614
It may not make it.

03:33:17.575 --> 03:33:23.098
The FDA might not make it either, and the FDA not making it would be a real big disaster for all of us.

03:33:24.439 --> 03:33:28.381
And it's funny how many of these people have hated the FDA since the very beginning.

03:33:29.588 --> 03:33:45.648
how they're not even talking about the FDA on the PBS NewsHour, even though it's his father and Brett Weinstein's father and Estes Kefauver who were responsible for modernizing the FDA in the same month or two that that John F. Kennedy guy was shot.

03:33:48.135 --> 03:33:50.116
if he continues in the current approach.

03:33:50.937 --> 03:33:54.299
It will make decisions to get vaccinated more difficult.

03:33:55.700 --> 03:34:04.686
As you see an erosion of people's trust, you'll see the numbers of people getting vaccinated going down, and you'll start to see the numbers of illnesses coming back up.

03:34:05.526 --> 03:34:14.432
And that is an awful thing to think about in a country that has put so much into protecting Americans with vaccines so far.

03:34:15.979 --> 03:34:16.259
nice.

03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:24.669
With changes to vaccine policy fueling the turmoil at the CDC, confusion over how and where Americans will get the new COVID vaccine.

03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:29.856
We've had quite a few number of measles cases this year and it's just one more vaccine that isn't available.

03:34:31.345 --> 03:34:36.787
He's turning the world upside down to make himself right and to prove that he was right all along.

03:34:37.188 --> 03:34:43.951
To prove that this power and this destiny that he had to be here where he is was always correct.

03:34:44.311 --> 03:34:51.114
And there's nothing anybody can do about it because he's so handsome and he's so Kennedy.

03:34:51.154 --> 03:34:51.914
Listen to this music.

03:34:58.397 --> 03:35:02.740
recommend the MMRV vaccine for kids under the age of four.

03:35:03.961 --> 03:35:09.464
If you disrupt and dismantle vaccination programs, people will die.

03:35:10.725 --> 03:35:12.506
It's just an absolute reality.

03:35:15.007 --> 03:35:25.874
Is he so used now to kind of compartmentalizing what he says and what the consequences might be as two completely different things that he doesn't see that connection anymore?

03:35:27.438 --> 03:35:39.521
between the way he uses power and what effect that's going to have, which will be matters of life and death for millions and millions and millions of people in America and around the world.

03:35:39.541 --> 03:35:41.622
Trump and RFK Jr.

03:35:41.722 --> 03:35:44.583
linking autism to Tylenol without any new evidence.

03:35:44.923 --> 03:35:49.484
Six former Surgeons General sounding the alarm on Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

03:35:49.504 --> 03:35:55.146
The group's science and expertise has taken a backseat to ideology and misinformation.

03:36:00.598 --> 03:36:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I told you it was a trap.

03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:11.745
And I think PBS frontline by releasing that yesterday has all but admitted it was always a scripted trap.

03:36:11.785 --> 03:36:20.090
I don't know exactly when they recruited him exactly when they had him, but it didn't stop when his dad was killed.

03:36:20.170 --> 03:36:21.111
That's when it started.

03:36:24.002 --> 03:36:31.710
The Kennedy family has been completely discredited and destroyed by a multi-generational attack on America.

03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:33.732
They are the victims just like we are.

03:36:36.115 --> 03:36:40.860
And we are still being victimized by their complete and total discrediting.

03:36:41.786 --> 03:36:49.073
That's why we have so many books about who killed JFK and so many books about who killed RFK, but no real solution to the problem.

03:36:49.653 --> 03:36:54.558
No real answer except for a general feeling that the government did it.

03:36:57.701 --> 03:37:01.264
But if the government did it, then what's the logical conclusion to come to?

03:37:03.426 --> 03:37:05.648
The government didn't leave those kids alone.

03:37:09.534 --> 03:37:17.783
The government is using those kids against us as part of a national security theater scripted by people a lot smarter than Bobby.

03:37:18.703 --> 03:37:25.087
Like Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, Kevin McKernan, Mark Lander, Tony Fauci, Francis Collins.

03:37:25.327 --> 03:37:25.747
I don't know.

03:37:26.327 --> 03:37:28.028
The guy who's the head of DITRA.

03:37:28.048 --> 03:37:28.949
What's his name again?

03:37:29.029 --> 03:37:29.689
David Hohn?

03:37:30.149 --> 03:37:32.310
Maybe the guy who's the head of U.S.

03:37:32.471 --> 03:37:32.791
Emirate.

03:37:32.831 --> 03:37:33.171
I don't know.

03:37:33.231 --> 03:37:34.111
Well, who's that guy?

03:37:34.131 --> 03:37:34.832
Sina Bavari?

03:37:35.272 --> 03:37:39.895
Like, I'm talking about foreigners in charge of big offices in America.

03:37:39.915 --> 03:37:42.776
You know, like the NIH director or the FDA director.

03:37:43.397 --> 03:37:45.578
Ladies and gentlemen, America's under attack.

03:37:46.929 --> 03:37:48.210
And it's easy to see.

03:37:49.351 --> 03:37:51.212
All you gotta do is follow me.

03:37:51.712 --> 03:37:53.013
Or you can follow Mark Kulak.

03:37:53.073 --> 03:37:53.834
Thanks for being here.

03:37:53.894 --> 03:37:54.955
I'll see you again soon.

03:37:55.995 --> 03:38:01.139
Probably not tomorrow because this is like three and a half hours and I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed.

03:38:01.939 --> 03:38:04.401
But maybe, maybe, maybe tomorrow.

03:38:04.461 --> 03:38:06.142
It's possible it could be tomorrow.

03:38:06.363 --> 03:38:06.683
I don't know.

03:38:06.943 --> 03:38:07.723
Thanks for being here.

03:38:07.864 --> 03:38:08.284
See you soon.

03:38:38.268 --> 03:38:38.649
Yeah.
