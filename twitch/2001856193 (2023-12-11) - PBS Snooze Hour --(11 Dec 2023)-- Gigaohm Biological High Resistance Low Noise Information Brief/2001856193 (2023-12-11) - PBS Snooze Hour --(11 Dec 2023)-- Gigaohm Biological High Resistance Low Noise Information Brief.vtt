WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh

00:33.480 --> 00:37.800
Look JC on the bike was timed out by Risa. Oh timeout JC on the bike

00:38.760 --> 00:40.260
JC on the bike

00:40.260 --> 00:42.260
It's JC on the bike

00:42.260 --> 00:44.260
It's JC on the bike. Yeah

00:45.120 --> 00:51.240
Well, I'm wise enough to know when a chomp needs banning and I know just the one

00:52.200 --> 00:57.600
Look at round. It's JC on the bike. Who says Vader didn't study music in college?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
You

01:17.720 --> 01:21.720
That is the great Z-Dog MD in the Vader mask Z-Dog

01:21.720 --> 01:23.720
It's getting over 60 minutes next

01:24.480 --> 01:27.620
It's going on French British Italian

01:27.620 --> 01:35.140
Japanese television people everywhere are starting to listen to him it's embarrassing

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
Well

02:14.740 --> 02:17.940
Well, we are back again here with another episode

02:19.020 --> 02:23.220
Trying to dispel the faith in a novel virus. He knows it is a lie

02:23.220 --> 02:31.120
And we're trying to stick to these three points and the biology that underpin them

02:31.580 --> 02:37.680
That's the strategy we're trying to use at big old biologicals the 11th of December, 2023

02:37.680 --> 02:55.080
Remember, this is the faith we are trying to dispel

02:59.000 --> 03:02.080
And this is the show you are watching

03:08.520 --> 03:12.080
We made it to a stream he says

03:14.600 --> 03:17.880
Let me see if I can do this correctly sometimes I can

03:19.240 --> 03:26.440
Thank you very much for joining me. This is Giga Ohm biological a high-resistance low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist

03:26.440 --> 03:30.640
I'm yelling more in the gym and my voice keeps going down. I don't know if I'm

03:31.600 --> 03:39.040
Rupturing more tumors in my throat or if it's just a natural progression of the strengthening of my vocal cords renewed

03:40.080 --> 03:46.560
But anyway, here we are. My name is Jonathan Cooey. I'm coming to you live from the back of my garage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

03:47.200 --> 03:53.480
It is 10 o 2 p.m. Local time wherever you are. Thank you for joining me

03:54.600 --> 03:59.120
Sorry for that abrupt sound change. We are still trying to solve the mystery of the

03:59.120 --> 04:07.200
The novel coronavirus and who set us on this mystery. We're trying to figure out who really set us up

04:08.000 --> 04:15.040
Who really laid down these these narratives and these mythologies about these sources of gain of function and

04:15.520 --> 04:20.380
That this one was possibly a gain of function virus. Maybe a two-part

04:21.320 --> 04:22.720
Bioweapon

04:22.760 --> 04:26.560
Maybe even a three-part bioweapon a multi-stage bioweapon

04:27.080 --> 04:33.400
Maybe a bioweapon that de attenuated and then needed to be augmented by a third bioweapon something like that

04:33.760 --> 04:36.840
Who set us up for these narratives?

04:38.920 --> 04:44.040
What's the difference between any of these books and why is it that?

04:45.720 --> 04:49.560
There are so many of these books the exact same books

04:50.160 --> 04:56.080
Told by people who've had shootouts with the FBI in their backyards in upper, Michigan

04:56.880 --> 05:00.160
told by people who are suing other people and

05:01.560 --> 05:03.560
Are being sued by other people

05:04.960 --> 05:07.440
told by senators and

05:10.160 --> 05:14.200
Sons of and and and nephews of presidents

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Strange company here

05:19.880 --> 05:21.880
All the same story

05:23.800 --> 05:31.600
Ensure I put some biology in that Wuhan cover-up, but it's 450 pages of lab leak bioweapon

05:35.880 --> 05:43.200
So where are we with dispelling this this narrative where are we with really coming to terms with this?

05:45.120 --> 05:48.400
Are we really gonna make any more progress or is this just the end?

05:48.400 --> 05:54.080
This is as far as we get now and everybody who has managed to get this far as you know

05:54.080 --> 05:58.200
Couldn't get a tattoo or something and and pretend like we're all I

05:59.320 --> 06:05.760
Don't know some kind of consolation prize and when we all go swimming at the local pool and see the

06:06.520 --> 06:13.080
See the special symbol will all know that all you are one of those truth or guys how you know what happened, right? Yeah, cool

06:15.120 --> 06:17.120
Building seven, you know

06:17.360 --> 06:23.320
You just either get it or you don't then that's it. It's just gonna fade off into history. You're never gonna address it again

06:23.960 --> 06:29.840
What would what would you bother bringing that up for anymore, right? That was that was so many years ago?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.840
Why would you want to argue about that again?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
That's how this ends

06:37.160 --> 06:45.080
Is when people decide that the work ain't worth it anymore that the argument isn't worth it anymore and other people are being

06:45.960 --> 06:48.160
Well encourage you not to stop

06:49.680 --> 06:53.440
Because of course, that's how they want to govern us by this story

06:55.600 --> 07:01.160
And so they've got to double down and triple down and they've got to pay everybody to keep doing it

07:05.480 --> 07:10.680
So that we keep being lost on this on this road

07:15.320 --> 07:19.240
Keep being lost on this road where we're we're arguing inevitably

07:19.680 --> 07:24.160
Forever about the novel virus and what it did what we should have done

07:25.160 --> 07:26.680
and

07:26.680 --> 07:30.160
Talking about how you know, we need to take care of the stuff that's coming in the future

07:31.800 --> 07:32.640
and

07:32.640 --> 07:37.320
all of these people ladies and gentlemen all of these people have have

07:38.160 --> 07:43.560
Actually shown us the border of this cave shown us the very borders of this

07:45.480 --> 07:47.480
this consensus and

07:49.240 --> 07:51.240
Never crossed it

07:51.960 --> 07:56.440
About a worst-case scenario either now or in the future it could have happened now

07:56.640 --> 07:59.800
But it definitely could happen in the future. It becomes more

08:00.920 --> 08:07.760
Probable as we move into the future and these technologies become ever more available right now according to Robert Malone

08:08.120 --> 08:12.120
They're accessible to someone with a bachelor's degree in biology in a garage

08:13.080 --> 08:16.120
Soon they'll be accessible to your toddler in a kit

08:22.800 --> 08:25.640
And so I really want to delve into this little

08:26.640 --> 08:34.240
analogy that I've been working on for a while because I want to try and get people to really be able to explain exactly how this is done

08:35.600 --> 08:40.600
But I want you to imagine you're in a car and you've been kidnapped by the people that are in the car with you

08:42.120 --> 08:50.120
And you're trying to figure out if any of those people in the car have been kidnapped like you've been kidnapped or if all of them are against you or what's going on

08:53.160 --> 08:55.160
And in the perfect scenario

08:57.240 --> 09:00.840
Where you're being kidnapped by psychologically clever people

09:03.080 --> 09:05.080
At least one of the people in the car

09:06.360 --> 09:11.800
According to the bad scary movie script will actually be your friend pretend to be your friend even

09:12.120 --> 09:15.440
let's say for example while the driver is really mean and

09:16.280 --> 09:22.040
The person that's sitting in the passenger seat in the front seat is really mean the person that's sitting in the back seat

09:23.480 --> 09:27.440
That pushed you into the car and then came around to the other side and got in

09:28.840 --> 09:30.840
Might hand you a cigarette

09:31.200 --> 09:38.360
Or maybe in this movie in your dreams they he gives you a candy bar or something to chill you out

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
It makes you feel at ease

09:42.800 --> 09:46.440
whispers to you while the other two are talking mean to each other and

09:47.160 --> 09:50.480
Tries to confuse you about who their allegiance is with

09:51.680 --> 09:56.640
And then they could even argue and have a staged argument in front of you

09:58.520 --> 10:04.000
And one of them could say now we can't we can't hurt him now. We should just let him out and

10:04.840 --> 10:08.000
advocate for your your safety and

10:09.880 --> 10:13.840
Then when they stop at a certain place and the two guys get out and walk out

10:13.840 --> 10:18.000
Then you're gonna be more apt to say something to this guy in the backseat next to you like hey man

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
What's up with these guys man? What's going on?

10:20.720 --> 10:24.280
And then when he asks you a question you tell him what you know

10:25.760 --> 10:32.160
They get what they want they fooled you into believing that you can trust the person in the backseat and this this

10:32.160 --> 10:35.080
Ruse can go on for for miles and miles

10:35.920 --> 10:37.920
gas station after gas station

10:39.200 --> 10:45.120
Until at some point they may have fooled you that actually the two people that aren't driving are good guys

10:46.000 --> 10:51.680
Trying to take control of the situation from the bad guy and get you to join them

10:54.320 --> 10:59.360
And before you know it you've completely accepted the situation as a

11:00.360 --> 11:06.080
Kidnapping sort of kind of but you're gonna help these guys get rid of this guy

11:10.280 --> 11:16.840
And they've completely manipulated you because all the while these three guys are all laughing because they're all in on it together

11:16.840 --> 11:18.840
Just trying to fool you

11:20.600 --> 11:22.600
Just trying to mess with you so that at the end

11:23.640 --> 11:27.480
When you when you find out that actually no it's over for you

11:28.120 --> 11:30.120
It hurts even more

11:30.560 --> 11:32.560
It's even more confusing

11:32.960 --> 11:37.160
And even better you didn't resist at all you just sat in the car and ate the food and

11:37.440 --> 11:42.400
We're quiet because you thought these two were working with you are gonna protect you

11:43.200 --> 11:45.200
And so you didn't resist

11:45.400 --> 11:47.480
You didn't cry you didn't scream

11:49.000 --> 11:52.360
They could leave you in the car and not worry about you running away

11:53.720 --> 11:56.280
Because the whole time while you were in this

11:56.800 --> 11:59.960
Kidnapping situation you didn't understand it

12:01.760 --> 12:03.920
And I want you to imagine what this

12:05.640 --> 12:12.880
Illusion of consensus does to you over the past three years you've been lured into believing that these people in the car with you are on your team

12:14.120 --> 12:16.120
That they're helping you

12:16.440 --> 12:22.840
They're giving them your your best interpretation of the situation is actually going to help everybody

12:22.840 --> 12:28.840
If you just keep telling everybody in this signal chat what you know about

12:29.080 --> 12:33.560
Immunology eventually it's going to get out because these guys have a farther reach than you do Jay

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And that's how they did this

12:44.400 --> 12:48.200
That's how they tricked me into thinking that this had to be a lab leak

12:48.880 --> 12:51.240
That they were lying about that they covered up

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
And

12:55.960 --> 13:03.680
It took me a long time to get where I am right now a long time and a lot of pain and a lot of a lot of

13:07.040 --> 13:09.040
Of being lied to

13:10.040 --> 13:16.360
And and having to figure out that people that you trust are lying to you and this isn't fun

13:17.240 --> 13:19.240
Especially when they don't confess

13:20.080 --> 13:22.080
Especially when they double down

13:23.840 --> 13:27.600
And that's what I've experienced in this car ride

13:29.560 --> 13:35.040
Liars that continue to lie liars that are willing to lie on top of lies

13:44.680 --> 13:47.480
I'm frustrated I guess because I don't really

13:47.480 --> 13:49.480
I

13:51.160 --> 13:56.200
Don't really have a good plan for how to go forward other than to keep

13:57.800 --> 13:59.800
Plugging away at the

14:00.760 --> 14:04.600
At the brick wall that they've managed to assemble around us

14:05.240 --> 14:13.400
The illusion of consensus about this novel virus that killed millions of people that we don't really need to look back and think about anymore

14:13.880 --> 14:17.280
That we can kind of we want to put behind us

14:17.720 --> 14:25.720
Nobody wants you at the funeral man because we don't want to talk about what might have happened because you know

14:26.840 --> 14:30.480
We wouldn't want to know the truth. We wouldn't want any justice for our friend

14:40.680 --> 14:46.000
We got here because all of these people were a combination of confused or lacking of courage

14:47.480 --> 14:49.480
We

14:50.680 --> 14:54.200
Got here because it was a very sophisticated operation a

14:55.120 --> 15:01.800
very sophisticated operation of people pretending to antagonize one another pretending to

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
to fight and to

15:05.600 --> 15:07.840
leave each other's signal groups and

15:08.840 --> 15:13.240
Join other people's signal groups and invite you into a special signal group or

15:14.120 --> 15:18.080
A special telegram group with all these really great doctors

15:19.120 --> 15:25.640
Man, you should join this gab. This thing is great. Oh, we've got this discord group where we really solve everything

15:25.640 --> 15:27.640
It's called error-free asylum

15:33.640 --> 15:35.640
That's how this was done

15:37.280 --> 15:41.480
That's how this was done in the foreground and in the background

15:41.560 --> 15:49.080
You don't think that journalists are in those same kind of groups. You don't think that that people working in in in all sorts of

15:49.240 --> 15:51.760
intelligence agencies all sorts of of

15:54.640 --> 15:58.560
Private kinds of intelligence firms and this kind of thing. They're not all

15:59.320 --> 16:02.560
Trying to read these social medias in just the same way

16:03.720 --> 16:05.720
Getting sucked into the same

16:05.880 --> 16:10.960
Sort of pseudo espionage cloak and dagger crap that ended up to be this Scooby-Doo

16:11.480 --> 16:17.320
The only difference is that right now after three years of pushing back this hard

16:17.320 --> 16:22.760
We're starting to bump into the very people that are responsible for it. Not like two layers in between

16:25.520 --> 16:30.880
We aren't experiencing the Veritas part we actually get blocked by the people who are doing it

16:32.360 --> 16:36.280
The people that were supposed to be the people behind the people that we're doing it

16:37.120 --> 16:42.480
But we're now all the way to the only people who can hold the narrative right on camera all the time

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
and

16:46.760 --> 16:54.080
Either understand it or are kept purposefully ignorant so that they can't make a mistake and stumble over it

16:58.840 --> 17:03.000
And over the next you know a few weeks before the end of the year before

17:03.640 --> 17:05.880
Before Christmas before New Year's

17:08.480 --> 17:15.440
We're just gonna have to come to terms with this long list of lies including Ivermectin and I proxy chloroquine and how

17:16.480 --> 17:18.480
Clever those lies were

17:21.080 --> 17:24.560
We're just gonna have to come to terms with them and people aren't gonna like it

17:26.560 --> 17:31.440
We're gonna have to come to terms with these these narratives that were laid down

17:33.000 --> 17:38.680
And we're gonna have to identify the people that were involved in laying them down and then those people are gonna have to be

17:38.920 --> 17:41.480
just outed as well as what they are and

17:42.600 --> 17:44.600
Then they can say they're sorry

17:46.360 --> 17:50.360
Or they can you know admit that they they made a mistake

17:52.320 --> 17:54.320
And I'll show you how you do it

17:56.560 --> 17:58.560
Just put it on your website

17:58.960 --> 18:00.560
Where it says

18:00.560 --> 18:03.960
gig ombiological.com and it says scooby

18:05.160 --> 18:09.080
And it says this review was written with the intent of stopping

18:09.280 --> 18:15.320
Transfection rollout you will notice the conspicuous absence of any discussion regarding the protocols that led to the massive

18:16.240 --> 18:20.000
Iatrogenic casualty events that were used to define the crisis for the world

18:20.000 --> 18:23.360
And then you can go down here and you can see this review that I was so proud of in

18:23.880 --> 18:28.840
2021 because it's so succinctly described the biology that I thought was at play and

18:31.280 --> 18:36.320
I've now come to understand RNA virology as almost exclusively a mythology

18:37.600 --> 18:43.400
Coronavirus RNA virology in particular make no mistake. I was part of the illusion of consensus

18:44.080 --> 18:48.880
That there was that was used to compel millions of healthy humans to submit to transfection

18:48.880 --> 18:52.360
I was guilty of falling for the theater and pushing a mythology of

18:52.840 --> 18:58.520
a novel circulating RNA coronavirus. I mean I did it on my bicycle, right?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.840
The review I wrote then now

19:04.040 --> 19:07.680
stands as a record of where I was and what I was thinking at the end of

19:08.280 --> 19:11.680
2020 and how I had not yet realized the full extent of the theater

19:12.000 --> 19:18.640
This is an account of the lab leak good guy narrative where drastic and other slu's have solved the mystery of their novel coronavirus

19:18.800 --> 19:21.720
It even includes the bonus mythology of an effect

19:22.840 --> 19:24.200
effective

19:24.200 --> 19:30.040
Transfection technology. They can influence the evolution of the novel circulating RNA virus. I

19:31.360 --> 19:36.440
Leave this document available for everyone so as not to hide my history, but instead to own it

19:37.280 --> 19:40.400
Everyone that pushed the mystery of the novel coronavirus was whitting

19:40.880 --> 19:48.080
Wittingly or unwittingly involved in enabling the murder of thousands if not millions of humans myself included

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
And I have changed the

19:52.200 --> 19:56.000
That the videos down here to indicate

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, that's not

20:00.320 --> 20:03.800
Did I not publish those? Oh, I did switch those I'll change them again

20:04.280 --> 20:09.480
To make them a little bit more sarcastic in terms of what I was thinking and there's a couple videos down here

20:09.480 --> 20:13.040
The one about measles I still need to look up. I think there's gonna we're gonna find

20:13.600 --> 20:19.400
Some things are not as simple as there's no viruses at all measles is possibly one of those things

20:20.400 --> 20:25.280
And I think that's going forward what I want to be most careful about is

20:26.240 --> 20:32.400
not allowing anybody anyone to push us down this slippery slope of there's nothing anywhere of

20:33.680 --> 20:38.320
Value and no observations at this size scale are of value we

20:38.880 --> 20:44.320
the chances of that being true are pretty slim in my humble opinion, but I think this is already a pretty far and

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And reaching

20:48.720 --> 20:53.240
Sort of status of where I am it's I don't I don't know what I would call this, but I'm

20:53.960 --> 20:55.960
it's a long time coming right because

20:57.240 --> 21:00.000
it's really important for everybody to

21:00.640 --> 21:05.240
Come to this place on their own and it's very different than coming to the place where

21:05.640 --> 21:13.440
There just aren't any viruses and then stop because I would really like to hone in on the fact

21:14.160 --> 21:15.720
that for

21:15.720 --> 21:17.720
nearly three years now

21:17.720 --> 21:19.720
they have been killing people and

21:20.760 --> 21:28.360
the no virus people haven't given a darn about that haven't said anything about that and and I think

21:30.040 --> 21:32.040
Whether all of them are

21:32.680 --> 21:34.680
are necessarily

21:36.120 --> 21:42.040
Culpable, I don't really think that's up to me to decide but I know from my own personal perspective

21:42.040 --> 21:45.720
they did not help my friend Nathan in any way at all and

21:48.080 --> 21:54.440
And I tried really hard to help Nathan I tried really hard to explain what what the

21:54.720 --> 21:59.800
Transfections shouldn't be able to do can't do and are likely actually doing

21:59.800 --> 22:01.800
I

22:01.840 --> 22:07.200
Don't think he took me very seriously back in 2020. In fact, I would like to share that with you right now

22:08.760 --> 22:16.480
Because it is a little moving I had a look at it and I was I was actually pretty moved

22:18.400 --> 22:20.400
Why is my phone not working

22:22.440 --> 22:24.960
Come on now, oh, I just unplugged it. That's why

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
I

22:28.720 --> 22:32.080
Just want to show you this email that I got from

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
My friend Nate so

22:36.360 --> 22:38.360
What I would like to say is

22:39.480 --> 22:41.480
the the last time

22:42.360 --> 22:44.360
Why can't I find it now?

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
I guess I got a look and just search

22:54.960 --> 22:56.960
Oh

22:59.200 --> 23:01.200
Wait what oh

23:06.040 --> 23:08.040
No wait what oh

23:17.560 --> 23:23.400
Wow that sucks is that really true no way

23:24.960 --> 23:26.960
I

23:27.320 --> 23:32.640
Can't believe it I should have did I did I oh my gosh

23:34.840 --> 23:36.840
Darn it I

23:37.560 --> 23:39.480
Didn't do it

23:39.480 --> 23:41.480
Okay, so that's a little weird

23:41.760 --> 23:43.760
apparently if

23:44.080 --> 23:46.080
if somebody dies and

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And they

23:50.640 --> 23:52.640
Disconnected their iPhone

23:53.640 --> 24:02.560
Then you lose all the messages with you and that person because all of my messages from Nathan are not on my phone anymore

24:02.560 --> 24:04.560
Which is very bizarre

24:05.360 --> 24:07.880
Hold on. Let me see if I can find him in my contacts

24:07.880 --> 24:09.880
Oh

24:19.240 --> 24:24.640
Here we go, okay, whoo, that's not what was weird. I could not get him back. Okay, here we go. I'm gonna go back

24:25.520 --> 24:27.520
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back to

24:27.960 --> 24:32.960
2020 and they're not that many messages right because we were in touch but not really in touch

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
Um

24:35.840 --> 24:41.920
The last time we got in touch actually was about the North Face logo because I was asking if I could use the North Face logo

24:45.680 --> 24:47.680
Oh, that's 20, okay, here we go

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
So the reason why we got in touch

24:53.440 --> 25:01.040
May and then okay, we got in touch about the North Face logo in May of 2020 because I was gonna make this this

25:02.000 --> 25:06.440
North Face, let me go to the front. I was gonna make this North Face logo

25:08.560 --> 25:15.640
That I have on my hat and that kind of thing and and then we had been going through

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
We had been going through

25:21.880 --> 25:23.880
Chicago for

25:24.480 --> 25:31.000
Christmas so since we had gotten back in 2016 we would go home to my parents in northern Wisconsin

25:31.040 --> 25:37.520
Go through Chicago and spend the night there with some of my friends and it was just a blast. It was becoming this regular thing. I

25:38.120 --> 25:44.640
Don't know if we stopped in 2016 because I think my parents came for that Christmas, but it could be wrong and then

25:45.160 --> 25:46.760
and

25:46.760 --> 25:48.760
then in 2017

25:49.000 --> 25:50.680
2018

25:50.680 --> 25:52.960
But in 2019 they didn't want to

25:53.760 --> 25:56.920
Yeah in 2019 we did it and then in 2020

25:57.160 --> 26:00.840
December we didn't they didn't want to do it. My friends didn't want us to stay

26:01.400 --> 26:05.680
They didn't think it was very cool that we were even asking if we could stop

26:06.640 --> 26:09.080
And so I sent a message to Nate

26:10.080 --> 26:13.880
Check this out. I sent a message to Nate

26:19.360 --> 26:21.360
What do I got to do this

26:21.960 --> 26:23.960
this sorry I

26:24.360 --> 26:27.880
Sent a message to Nate that little light's gonna get in the way. I guess

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
Maybe I have to turn it off

26:31.760 --> 26:36.200
There so I sent a message to Nate on December 4th 2020

26:36.200 --> 26:40.520
So are you guys also blown out by COVID no visit over Christmas?

26:40.520 --> 26:43.640
Just wondering as Amy won't see us unless we are vaccinated

26:43.960 --> 26:49.200
So we won't be seeing her again. Ah the irony of losing my job because of this and now my friends to

26:49.680 --> 26:55.560
Oh well someday of sweet apology or I'll be dead in prison. Let me know how you all doing hugs from Pittsburgh

26:56.480 --> 27:01.720
Nate says I'm trying to sort this out. So just to confirm you're a staunch anti-vaxxer

27:02.480 --> 27:06.680
Shoulder shrug and then you know the tooth smile thing and I said no

27:06.680 --> 27:09.880
But that's a loaded term my kids have their shots and so does my dog

27:09.880 --> 27:15.160
I don't do Facebook so I'm less misinformed about the biology I'd say but with regard to a vaccine from Gates

27:16.120 --> 27:22.200
Software magnet. Yes staunch anti-billionaire products tonight's live stream will be a message to my friends in Chicago

27:22.200 --> 27:25.520
I feel very bad for you all to be so terrorized your mayor are

27:26.480 --> 27:28.480
And so I sent him a link to my live stream

27:29.640 --> 27:35.560
He says his stepfather is currently grappling with COVID pneumonia. So terrorized would be an appropriate

27:36.600 --> 27:42.040
characterization so his father stepfather in law is having about with

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
COVID pneumonia

27:45.000 --> 27:51.160
What is COVID pneumonia, right? The COVID pneumonia is just it's just it's just pneumonia. I mean

27:51.800 --> 27:53.000
whoops

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
so it's really

27:56.920 --> 28:03.440
It's really kind of unfortunate if you think about where we are because I could have probably

28:04.480 --> 28:08.080
Not saved him had I gone full no virus without

28:08.560 --> 28:12.760
The subtleties that I have now and if I had the subtleties that I have now

28:15.120 --> 28:20.640
Could I have saved him I don't know could I have convinced him that I was right? I don't know

28:23.840 --> 28:32.680
But I I do know that that all these people telling this story about a virus killing millions of people all these people telling a story about a

28:33.600 --> 28:35.600
Transfection working on some people

28:38.320 --> 28:45.680
Or or that natural immunity is not good enough. I mean these people these worst case scenario people they they are responsible

28:47.120 --> 28:52.800
Because they enabled the newscasts they enabled the blogs they enabled the facebook they enabled at all

29:00.800 --> 29:02.240
I would like you

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
excuse me

29:04.240 --> 29:06.240
I apologize for that. I

29:06.240 --> 29:10.880
Would like you to watch this movie in your spare time. I'm not going to waste your time with it, but it is a

29:11.920 --> 29:13.920
a david e Martin movie

29:14.640 --> 29:16.480
where he

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
is giving a speech in

29:18.880 --> 29:25.280
In switzerland and he gives basically the same cookie cutter speech that he gives in a lot of other places with the same

29:26.400 --> 29:27.760
Slides

29:27.760 --> 29:35.040
And the same basic spiel, but it's really quite slowly done and he does very specifically the

29:36.800 --> 29:40.560
Infectious replication defective clones

29:41.680 --> 29:47.440
And I think I've kind of figured out what he does. I think I kind of figured out what his shtick is. I'm not really sure i'm ready to fully

29:48.720 --> 29:52.480
Rip into it anymore because I know people are getting a little bit tired of david e Martin

29:52.480 --> 29:56.640
But I think his main shtick is is that he's very imprecise

29:57.760 --> 29:59.760
about describing the

30:00.560 --> 30:05.040
significance of the term infectious replication defective clone

30:05.760 --> 30:07.760
Because what it suggests

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And what the psychology

30:10.080 --> 30:13.920
I think the game that he's playing here is what it suggests is is that

30:14.480 --> 30:18.080
In order to make an infectious replication defective clone

30:21.360 --> 30:23.120
You need to have

30:23.120 --> 30:25.280
the infectious

30:25.280 --> 30:26.880
clone

30:26.880 --> 30:32.960
Right the one that is infectious and replication competent that can spread itself all over the world

30:34.320 --> 30:39.520
And even though he doesn't explicitly say that even though he doesn't explicitly say that they made one of those

30:40.000 --> 30:43.360
He also doesn't explicitly say that they can't make one of those

30:44.640 --> 30:47.440
He doesn't say that RNA can't pandemic

30:48.960 --> 30:53.040
He says that they have a patent for an infectious RNA defective clone

30:53.760 --> 30:55.760
And that means they made a bioweapon

30:57.520 --> 30:59.040
Well

30:59.040 --> 31:01.040
Explain how the bioweapon works

31:01.680 --> 31:03.840
Explain like jr. Giordano does

31:04.480 --> 31:10.640
That you only need to put a few cases in a few places with a clone to allow a perfect sequencing reaction

31:11.440 --> 31:18.320
And allow the simultaneous detection of the same virus in multiple places to give the illusion of a pandemic

31:19.600 --> 31:22.000
If that's the kind of bioweapon you mean absolutely

31:22.960 --> 31:29.200
But it's not a bioweapon that can spread around the world and he's very imprecise as he pretends to be very

31:29.760 --> 31:31.760
precise about the biology

31:32.240 --> 31:37.680
And you can see him do the same stick over and over again the talks are about an hour and 40 minutes long

31:37.680 --> 31:41.360
They cover all the same slides that cover all the same spots. It's uncanny

31:52.960 --> 31:55.520
It's almost become a holiday tradition

31:56.000 --> 32:02.160
Temperatures go down decorations go up and so do covet cases for a look at the current state of affairs

32:02.240 --> 32:05.440
Not just with covet but also with rsv and seasonal flu

32:05.840 --> 32:11.440
We turn again to kaitlyn jennelina publisher of the popular newsletter your local epidemiologist

32:11.760 --> 32:19.680
Caitlin, what is the situation right now with these three respiratory conditions or diseases and how does it compare to previous years?

32:20.400 --> 32:21.680
Yeah, it's a good question

32:21.680 --> 32:22.560
So

32:22.560 --> 32:32.240
Unfortunately, we are in this mac middle of respiratory season and that means that rsv flu and covet 19 are exponentially increasing

32:32.720 --> 32:38.480
Really across the nation right now. We hope that rsv may be peaking soon in the south

32:38.560 --> 32:43.440
But uh, I would not be surprised if a lot of your family and friends are

32:43.920 --> 32:45.920
Feeling a lot of different symptoms right now

32:46.320 --> 32:50.240
The last time we talked it was just before the the federal health emergency ended

32:50.560 --> 32:54.720
And the government was getting out of the business of buying the vaccines and distributing them

32:55.120 --> 32:58.160
Has there been any any change or any effect of that change?

32:58.720 --> 33:06.080
There's actually then a very dramatic effect particularly around vaccine disparities like you said the funding is gone

33:06.320 --> 33:12.400
Um, which means campaigns education pop-up clinics partnerships incentives as they're all gone as well

33:12.960 --> 33:18.560
And there's additional layer of barriers to access due to cost or just availability

33:18.960 --> 33:24.320
For example, that's a lot of layers, right? I mean if you go back to just list them off again

33:24.320 --> 33:32.480
It's like you said the funding is gone. Um, which means campaigns education pop-up clinics partnerships incentives as they're all gone as well

33:32.640 --> 33:38.720
That's a lot and there's additional layer of barriers to access due to cost or just availability

33:39.120 --> 33:45.360
For example, some local health clinics the vaccine costs more than they can afford or are willing to risk

33:45.760 --> 33:50.640
Financially so for example the gap between latina x and white residents

33:51.120 --> 33:56.240
Is more than twice what it was last year in coven 19 vaccination coverage

33:56.720 --> 34:00.400
Same with african-american black residents same with residents of low income

34:00.560 --> 34:04.640
So unfortunately we are seeing that the marketplace

34:05.120 --> 34:10.560
Uh in our regular health care system regular public health system not during an emergency

34:11.040 --> 34:14.640
Is really not fairly distributed to those who need it the most

34:15.200 --> 34:20.320
Family friends and co-workers. This is the time of year. There are a lot of office parties a lot of people are traveling

34:20.400 --> 34:22.400
They'll be gathering with their families

34:22.560 --> 34:24.400
Uh for holiday celebrations

34:24.880 --> 34:26.720
What advice do you have

34:26.720 --> 34:32.880
For these people that they don't take away from these celebrations a case of covid or rsv or the flu

34:33.280 --> 34:38.800
Yeah, I think the most important thing at least what i'm laser focused on is I don't want to miss that party

34:38.800 --> 34:42.000
I do not want you to have disruptions because i'm sick

34:42.480 --> 34:48.320
And so uh what i'm doing is i'm wearing a mask in very crowded areas like traveling for example

34:48.640 --> 34:51.680
And then of course keeping up to date with those vaccines

34:52.400 --> 34:55.360
Even though we are in the middle of respiratory season

34:55.520 --> 34:58.160
It's still not too late to get your coven 19

34:58.480 --> 35:02.720
Vaccine your flu vaccine or even your rsv vaccine if you're over 60

35:02.800 --> 35:08.400
So there's a lot of measures we can put in place to maximize our fun for these holidays

35:08.800 --> 35:11.200
And ensure that we minimize our sickness

35:11.600 --> 35:16.720
We asked viewers what was on their mind what they wanted to know about and there's a lot about what we're talking about here

35:16.880 --> 35:20.880
Canton north carolina asked does the booster shot cover all variants

35:21.520 --> 35:26.640
Yeah, so the importance of this fall vaccine is that it is updated with xbb

35:26.800 --> 35:30.800
Which is the newest variant that has been circulating around this fall

35:31.280 --> 35:32.800
There are other variants coming

35:32.800 --> 35:34.800
Yeah, this is yesterday

35:34.800 --> 35:36.720
viruses do and we are

35:36.720 --> 35:38.080
And day before maybe

35:38.080 --> 35:44.160
But the latest data from the lab shows that you know this updated vaccine is still a great match

35:44.640 --> 35:49.280
um particularly against severe disease and death a lot of interest about long covid

35:49.760 --> 35:53.200
Prakash asked what are the latest statistics on long covid

35:53.920 --> 35:59.360
Yeah long covid is certainly a thing there are millions of people suffering right now

35:59.920 --> 36:05.280
And we are working very hard in public health to try to figure out the patterns and the treatments for it

36:05.840 --> 36:10.480
Thankfully though that the risk of long covid is declining over time

36:10.960 --> 36:14.000
Thanks to immunity. Thanks to vaccines

36:14.640 --> 36:17.600
And thanks to also the virus just changing

36:17.920 --> 36:24.480
Um on macron for example is less prevalent with long covid than delta was um a few years ago

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
So it is still a risk

36:27.120 --> 36:33.840
And it is I think here to stay as long as the virus is here to stay and we need to figure out solutions for it

36:34.160 --> 36:37.360
We also got a question about the rsv vaccine and its availability

36:37.760 --> 36:44.320
Sylvia in pennsylvania asked when will the rsv vaccine be available for those under the age of 65

36:44.640 --> 36:47.600
And for those who are young with chronic lung disease

36:49.200 --> 36:55.600
That's a really great question. So right now the rsv vaccine is available for those over 60

36:56.240 --> 37:02.240
Um as well as pregnant people we also have a monoclonal antibody, which is basically um

37:02.800 --> 37:08.160
A shot of antibodies for very young kids the rest are

37:14.320 --> 37:20.560
Done the pipeline but at least right now we know that the highest of highest risk for rsv

37:20.560 --> 37:24.720
Are somewhat protected um through these prevention strategies

37:25.040 --> 37:30.080
We were talking earlier about the price now that the government has gotten out of uh the business of buying and distributing

37:30.480 --> 37:37.040
Uh the covid vaccine lisley in main asks if there's a program for free or reduced cost vaccine shots

37:37.280 --> 37:39.280
For someone who is unemployed

37:39.360 --> 37:43.360
So there is a unique and very new program by the federal government

37:43.360 --> 37:47.840
It's called the bridge program and it's just for covid 19 vaccines

37:47.920 --> 37:51.920
But it provides free shots this fall to under an uninsured people

37:52.400 --> 37:58.080
And there's three places you can really kind of find these free shots is one health care providers

37:58.560 --> 38:05.120
Two local health centers and three and probably most popular as pharmacies like cvs and walgreens

38:05.680 --> 38:11.680
Um, but the really the best place to look where you can find this bridge program is at vaccines dot gov

38:12.160 --> 38:15.280
Because partners participating in this program are

38:23.040 --> 38:25.840
Caitlin jennelina thank you very much for that

38:28.080 --> 38:30.080
Thanks for having me

38:30.640 --> 38:32.640
You can read more

38:35.760 --> 38:41.040
Okay, so now this is the other one that I thought was really funny. This is from the next day. So I think this one is from

38:42.000 --> 38:48.320
Yesterday and the one I just showed you is from the day before but pbs news hour is watched by so many old people

38:49.120 --> 38:51.120
so many old boomers

38:51.120 --> 38:52.960
um

38:52.960 --> 38:54.960
And so it's a really important

38:57.360 --> 39:00.400
I really feel like it's one of the best ways to see what the

39:01.360 --> 39:06.400
What the borg would like you to think or the the the system would like you to think

39:06.960 --> 39:08.960
um in other words

39:09.360 --> 39:10.880
if you would

39:10.880 --> 39:12.880
look at the pbs news hour

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and get

39:16.880 --> 39:21.920
Exactly as riled up as they are about what they are riled up about

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
Did I just say that very silly?

39:25.760 --> 39:28.080
Then then it would be perfect for the government

39:29.040 --> 39:31.040
So if you got exactly

39:31.040 --> 39:37.040
Interested in the things that they're interested in and exactly with the amount of vigor that they're interested in

39:37.040 --> 39:40.080
You would be completely neutralized and a perfect voter

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
For for the status quo

39:43.440 --> 39:46.800
So what are they gonna tell us about climate and health? This is gonna be good

39:47.360 --> 39:52.480
For whether countries can or will meet their prior pledges to hold down global temperatures

39:52.800 --> 39:57.280
If temperatures continue to climb the impact on human health could be profound

39:57.520 --> 40:00.320
And some doctors say their profession is not prepared

40:00.880 --> 40:06.480
William Branham has the story in collaboration with the global health reporting center with support from the Pulitzer Center

40:06.560 --> 40:10.560
Pulitzer. Oh boy. He's on a chilly fall day in Cambridge, Massachusetts

40:10.880 --> 40:14.240
The conversation here at harvard is about extreme heat

40:14.960 --> 40:19.600
And how in south asia alone it kills tens of thousands of people every year

40:20.080 --> 40:23.360
Water the water becomes so hot that they can't drink it

40:23.600 --> 40:29.600
Dr. Sat sheet balsari is an ER doctor and co-director of the crisis ready initiative at harvard

40:30.000 --> 40:38.720
He's part of a movement to get doctors focused on how climate change impacts human health and how to respond you're an emergency room physician

40:39.840 --> 40:46.560
How is it that you are talking so much about climate change? I mean there is a direct impact on health

40:47.520 --> 40:53.040
Heatwaves will lead to heat illness and heat exhaustion and heat stroke people present to the emergency room

40:53.040 --> 40:57.280
When there are wildfires and there is smoke and there's more particulate matter in the air

40:57.280 --> 41:05.200
And but there is also a persistent tale of morbidity and mortality that these extreme weather events are resulting in in this day and age

41:06.080 --> 41:12.080
Even in the developed world the rickshapulurs are the first big team of temperature in case

41:12.560 --> 41:18.080
Today he and his colleagues are working on a project to try and understand and hopefully mitigate

41:18.560 --> 41:25.040
Some of the impacts of extreme heat in places where millions of the world's poorest people live and work

41:26.240 --> 41:34.400
In india balsari's team partnered with the self-employed women's association a union that represents small scale independent workers

41:34.720 --> 41:37.200
Who make up the vast bulk of india's population

41:37.920 --> 41:40.960
By giving them tiny wearable temperature sensors

41:41.520 --> 41:47.680
They found the women were often experiencing heat extremes well beyond what was officially recorded

41:48.160 --> 41:53.360
So this is madu ben's house madu ben works from home. She's a weaver. I'll just show you a couple of graphs

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
This one for example

41:55.440 --> 42:00.000
The green dots are the satellite observation. So that's nasa power data

42:00.320 --> 42:04.320
But the gold shows the readings from the sensors in the women's homes

42:04.640 --> 42:08.400
That's the range of lived experience between the temperature of our time

42:09.360 --> 42:10.960
So that's nasa power data

42:10.960 --> 42:12.320
But the gold shows

42:12.320 --> 42:19.120
Thoughts are the satellite observation. So that's nasa power nasa, but the gold shows the readings from the senate

42:23.280 --> 42:29.680
Answers in the women's homes and there is a 10 degree difference, but do you see what i'm seeing here?

42:30.560 --> 42:32.640
range of lived experience i'm

42:33.600 --> 42:37.360
i'm confused as to what that means is that when they're awake or

42:38.080 --> 42:39.920
Or

42:39.920 --> 42:41.920
Anyway, the satellite data

42:42.320 --> 42:49.280
Is how it's matching up with the range of lived experience. I guess what's that's the temperature they record on their body versus what nasa

42:50.240 --> 42:55.440
And so nasa is not accurately tracking their body temperature or something like that. I mean this is some

42:57.040 --> 43:00.240
Are the satellite observation? So that's nasa power data

43:00.480 --> 43:04.560
But the gold shows the readings from the sensors in the women's homes

43:04.960 --> 43:09.600
And there is a 10 degree difference between the temperature outside and the temperature at home

43:09.920 --> 43:15.040
So the cruder temperature data might tell you oh, it's actually not so bad because it's cooling at night

43:15.120 --> 43:19.360
Yes, but when you actually look at what her lived experience is it's much more it has complete

43:19.520 --> 43:22.320
it could also be that they've changed the the

43:24.080 --> 43:29.200
Place where they're drawing the temperature from i thought i heard something about that that they used to draw it from

43:30.240 --> 43:31.440
a certain

43:31.440 --> 43:37.600
You know ground level and now they're doing it from somewhere else so all the temperatures went up somehow or they're used to do it above ground

43:37.600 --> 43:41.120
And now they're doing it. It's something. I don't know whatever. It's just all nonsense

43:41.600 --> 43:46.400
Any different ramifications right living and working in 45 degrees celsius

43:46.560 --> 43:51.760
That's 113 degrees fahrenheit is more than unpleasant. It's dangerous

43:52.160 --> 43:57.920
This is massive ramifications for workplace safety as well to be able to say that when it is

43:58.240 --> 44:05.200
Only 40 degrees outside. We know that these kinds of workshops actually are at 45 or 48 degrees

44:05.680 --> 44:12.400
This kind of fine grain data points to problems and solutions which are barely on people's radar now

44:12.880 --> 44:14.400
If we had better information

44:14.400 --> 44:18.960
I bet those people that worked in those places already knew that it was hotter inside than outside

44:19.360 --> 44:23.120
Even before they got all these fancy thermometers. I bet you could have interviewed them

44:23.120 --> 44:26.640
They all they would all say the same thing. Oh in there. Oh, it's hotter than hell

44:28.240 --> 44:31.440
I bet they would have all said it in about local climates

44:32.800 --> 44:37.120
You could change school timings for example there were a bunch of

44:37.600 --> 44:42.800
But we would have never been able to figure that out without all these thermometers and satellites. I mean, oh my goodness

44:43.840 --> 44:45.840
So great all this data

44:46.400 --> 44:49.200
Of workers that we were working with who

44:50.000 --> 44:53.520
Stopped going to school because it would get so hot in the afternoon

44:54.080 --> 44:58.640
That their feet would burn when they would step on the asphalt and so they just stop going to school

44:59.040 --> 45:02.240
and unless you're on the field studying this it wouldn't

45:03.440 --> 45:04.320
really

45:04.320 --> 45:07.040
occur to any of us that that

45:08.080 --> 45:12.000
School dropouts is because you know, it's too hard to walk back from school

45:12.400 --> 45:15.680
Trying to do better models using microclimate variation

45:15.920 --> 45:21.040
While sari's partner in this work is dr. Caroline bucky a harvard professor variation

45:21.360 --> 45:23.200
Walkback from school

45:23.200 --> 45:26.080
Trying to do better models using microclimate variation

45:26.400 --> 45:34.000
She's trying to do better models with microclimate variation. So it's the same fallacy that a lot of other modeling

45:36.080 --> 45:42.800
Research lines fall into where they think that okay if I had just enough thermometers are all around the world

45:43.440 --> 45:47.520
And I they were accurate enough in their measurements in real time

45:48.240 --> 45:52.800
Then I could make an accurate model of the weather that could accurately predict the future

45:52.800 --> 45:58.560
And the only reason why our models right now don't work is because we don't have enough data points from enough places

45:59.200 --> 46:03.600
With enough fidelity in order to feed the model enough data for it to give us the good

46:04.560 --> 46:06.560
prediction out

46:07.760 --> 46:13.360
And so with climate they're going to do the same crap where they think well if we could just measure it better

46:13.360 --> 46:19.840
We measure it more often in more places around the world than we would get a better idea of how exponentially it is

46:20.720 --> 46:22.720
careening out of control

46:23.040 --> 46:25.040
Because our models will show us

46:26.320 --> 46:32.880
Anytime anyone at this stage starts out with we're going to study a natural phenomenon by making better models

46:34.240 --> 46:42.000
You should already just say whoa, okay, that's not science. That's not science. That's not science. So just stop

46:42.960 --> 46:45.760
But they're not going to stop because that's where all the money goes

46:45.760 --> 46:47.440
That's where all these

46:47.440 --> 46:51.280
Headlines can be made. That's how they generated the pandemic because they took

46:52.000 --> 46:57.520
The mash casualty event of New York City. They put those numbers into a model and the model said

46:58.720 --> 47:00.720
worst case scenario is coming

47:01.680 --> 47:06.640
The slope of the deaths in New York indicate the worst case scenario is coming

47:07.280 --> 47:14.160
And then a bunch of clowns on the internet all over the place started saying that oh my gosh the worst case scenario is coming

47:18.080 --> 47:22.960
And a very very very large proportion of us were not sophisticated enough to see it

47:23.520 --> 47:29.360
Not sophisticated enough to know or to know enough to know until it was too late

47:31.600 --> 47:35.040
Until our family and friends have been bibed a whole year

47:35.920 --> 47:41.600
of isolation and Brett Weinstein and PBS NewsHour

47:43.600 --> 47:48.880
That's why my friend Annie Worshing is probably dead. That's why my friend Nate is probably dead

47:50.160 --> 48:00.880
That's why lots and lots of people are probably dead because this narrative was seated on purpose on PBS NewsHour and in the back corners of the internet

48:01.520 --> 48:04.000
And in our own social media circles

48:05.840 --> 48:09.760
That unbeknownst to us probably assembled not spontaneously

48:12.480 --> 48:14.480
But because they needed to

48:16.400 --> 48:21.840
To control us to control our narratives to control us as people as outspoken

48:22.640 --> 48:28.160
Leaders of a dissident movement everybody needed controlling and everybody that needed controlling met friends

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
Found an influencer a handler

48:35.840 --> 48:37.840
You

48:40.320 --> 48:44.800
Some of us just climbed higher on the hand on the handling ladder than others did

48:48.400 --> 48:51.120
But in the end if you have been handled

48:51.840 --> 48:58.160
And chances are you haven't come to the point where you've said that the no virus people are wrong and there's no virus

49:00.240 --> 49:02.240
Very few people have gotten that far

49:03.200 --> 49:05.200
Mark Gulak's gotten that far

49:06.240 --> 49:09.440
Jessica Hawkins gotten that far Nick Hudson's gotten that far

49:10.000 --> 49:15.600
Jonathan Engler's gotten that far, but not very many other people. I think Amad Malik's gotten that far

49:17.280 --> 49:24.000
But not many or any other people really understand exactly how subtle and contradictory and incongruent

49:25.200 --> 49:27.200
And deceptive

49:27.440 --> 49:33.760
This narrative has been how many people have been lying behind each other's back about whether or not they know or talk to one another

49:37.840 --> 49:41.440
How many fake rivalries have you been witnessed to

49:42.560 --> 49:47.920
How many fake fights have you seen how many fake arguments on social media have you watched how many

49:48.640 --> 49:56.080
How many times have you watched somebody leave a telegram group in a in a in a big drama or leave a social media group

49:56.080 --> 49:58.480
Like a signal chat group in a sub big drama

50:00.000 --> 50:06.320
How many times have you seen that happen and thought to yourself? Oh, wow, that means something when actually you were wrong

50:08.720 --> 50:14.320
How many times have you seen two people fighting on twitter two people blocking each other on twitter and thing for sure

50:14.480 --> 50:17.200
It must be something very significant instead of a

50:18.960 --> 50:20.960
Two people doing an act

50:21.840 --> 50:27.440
Maybe three people doing an act maybe two teams of 50 doing an act

50:29.440 --> 50:36.000
That's what you need to start seeing now because that's what's happening if the pbs news hour is all holy and captured

50:36.720 --> 50:39.120
encapsulated theater of the absurd

50:40.720 --> 50:45.440
Then I assure you these people with these giant piles of weaponized money have taken to the streets

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
They have taken to social media

50:48.160 --> 50:50.160
I

50:50.160 --> 50:56.400
Don't think it would be very expensive at all from the perspective of their budget size to create a whole group of

50:58.160 --> 51:02.320
Take a whole group of unemployed people and make them into something really powerful

51:03.360 --> 51:05.520
Especially if your only goal was chaos

51:07.360 --> 51:10.080
Fear uncertainty and doubt about a worst-case scenario

51:12.720 --> 51:14.400
Get a few ringers

51:14.400 --> 51:18.880
Let those ringers recruit a few people based on who you have to control

51:19.520 --> 51:22.480
How many people did they need to control mike eden

51:24.960 --> 51:26.960
Wolf gang woda

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
Sukhred bhakti

51:31.440 --> 51:33.440
Bobby kennedy

51:34.560 --> 51:39.520
A lot of people think Bobby kennedy was already long controlled a long time ago. Oh my goodness

51:40.400 --> 51:42.560
So then who'd they really need to control?

51:43.520 --> 51:47.200
Who really spoke out pure quarry nurse erin

51:48.480 --> 51:50.480
Trump

51:51.440 --> 51:55.040
Once you start to ask these questions and think about it there weren't very many

51:56.960 --> 51:59.520
There weren't very many people that need you controlling at all

52:02.160 --> 52:04.640
And that should stun you quite a bit actually

52:05.600 --> 52:12.000
Because it should start to make you realize that even the control that you thought you saw the censorship that you thought you saw was all

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
a staged act

52:17.200 --> 52:18.960
All of it

52:18.960 --> 52:21.600
Alex baronson got to sue twitter

52:22.800 --> 52:28.320
Now he's back out saying that the frame shift is actually a big deal. Come on

52:29.680 --> 52:31.680
Come on

52:32.480 --> 52:36.560
These people have been playing us for a long long long time

52:38.880 --> 52:41.680
Coronavirus is all basically based on models

52:42.960 --> 52:47.600
Models of how sure short sequences can be assembled into full genomes

52:51.280 --> 52:56.960
While sorry's partner in this work is dr. Caroline bucky a harvard professor of epidemiology

52:57.200 --> 53:03.200
A lot of the ways that we are conceiving of the issues of climate change are from large global models

53:03.680 --> 53:08.960
Remote sensing data from satellites and things like this and the scale on which we're talking about

53:08.960 --> 53:15.360
I don't understand how frame shift leads to ADE ADE is antibody dependent enhancement where the antibodies

53:16.000 --> 53:23.280
That are made to a previous antigen are somehow beneficial to a future version

53:24.240 --> 53:26.240
of the same antigen

53:27.120 --> 53:32.560
So if you apply it to coronaviruses and you think that the cartoon of coronaviruses is real

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
How does it lead to ADE?

53:36.240 --> 53:38.240
It leads to ADE, I guess because

53:38.960 --> 53:43.760
non neutralizing antibodies for the spike protein now help the virus by

53:44.880 --> 53:51.200
Leaving it in the open fear and cleavage site position. I mean it's it's ADE is part of their

53:52.080 --> 53:58.960
It's part of their narrative. It's their way of explaining what happens when vaccination goes wrong

53:59.760 --> 54:02.160
I'm not even really sure that ADE is a

54:04.240 --> 54:09.440
Is a mechanism that we need to recognize in the way that they want us to recognize it should we investigate

54:10.160 --> 54:13.840
The idea that there could be pathological antibodies absolutely

54:14.960 --> 54:16.960
absolutely we should

54:17.840 --> 54:22.880
And I would be willing to bet that if we did that in earnest and with an objectivity that mattered

54:23.600 --> 54:26.560
We would actually reach the conclusion that in vaccination

54:27.680 --> 54:31.920
Many of the antibodies we make are useless many of them have the potential to be

54:32.560 --> 54:35.440
disease enhancing and most of them are ridiculous

54:36.880 --> 54:40.560
Because of the way that we stimulate our immune system and where are we stimulated

54:41.280 --> 54:43.280
But

54:44.800 --> 54:52.560
Let's be precise here and make sure that we're not always jumping back to their cartoon mythologies always jumping back to their

54:53.520 --> 55:00.240
Immuno mythology models of how things work ADE is their model of what happens when vaccination goes wrong

55:00.960 --> 55:02.960
We need to revisit it

55:03.200 --> 55:08.640
because the mechanisms that are portrayed in it are portrayed in such a way as to

55:09.520 --> 55:11.680
make vaccination still a viable

55:14.080 --> 55:16.080
A viable goal

55:16.560 --> 55:23.040
as a as a therapeutic and as a a methodology to optimize and it's not

55:28.640 --> 55:34.640
There are human-scale data to understand the impacts of climate change getting better data is critical

55:35.040 --> 55:38.640
Knowing who is most affected could trigger insurance payments

55:39.120 --> 55:43.840
Disaster declarations and more it doesn't need to be weirder proteins though

55:43.840 --> 55:49.360
You see if you what you need to realize I think consider not realize but consider

55:50.240 --> 55:55.840
Is that if the original narrative that was told to us for how many years three

55:57.600 --> 56:02.640
Three years by Walter chestnut and kevin mccain and charles ricksey and

56:03.520 --> 56:10.560
Um stephanie sineff and all these other people who told us that the spike protein is toxic and it had all these very special

56:11.520 --> 56:15.040
Mimicking sequences on it that are overlapping with human

56:15.840 --> 56:24.240
Human genes and if all of these things are true about the spike protein then a frame shift mutation will inevitably reduce that homology

56:25.120 --> 56:32.240
There's no way that an engineered protein that's designed to have all this stuff and it like luke montanier said

56:32.640 --> 56:34.800
It was designed by a clock maker

56:36.560 --> 56:44.720
Don't forget that right I believe it's much more likely. It's a lab leak. It was made like a clock by a watchmaker

56:45.840 --> 56:49.600
So if you do a frame shift mutation on that it doesn't become a better watch

56:51.360 --> 56:58.640
It doesn't become a more dangerous toxin. It doesn't get closer to mimicking human proteins. Don't be ridiculous. You must know that

56:59.600 --> 57:01.600
It will become a nonsense protein

57:03.120 --> 57:08.480
It will not become more immunogenic if it's designed that's like saying, okay, this is a beautiful book

57:08.800 --> 57:13.360
It's like the best book ever and i've got all the chapters in exactly the right order

57:13.840 --> 57:17.680
Now we're going to shift all the words by one letter and it's still going to read just fine

57:18.880 --> 57:20.880
Come on

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
This was a known

57:23.840 --> 57:28.400
Consequence of transfection a known consequence of the chemical alteration of the RNA

57:28.800 --> 57:34.880
But let's think logically about the biology that we're supposed to be that's supposed to be at play here

57:36.240 --> 57:41.920
The only way frame shift mutation on this antigen is going to cause problems that aren't worse

57:42.720 --> 57:45.840
That are worse than the transfection itself

57:46.240 --> 57:48.240
Is

57:48.240 --> 57:56.000
If the frame mutation makes it a more antigenic protein and that's just not very likely if this what everybody's been telling us

57:56.560 --> 58:01.840
Since the beginning of the pandemic every single one of these suckers has been saying that luke montagney

58:02.000 --> 58:07.440
Said that this is a design like a watchmaker with all these special things in it like from hiv

58:08.160 --> 58:10.160
and all these, you know

58:10.960 --> 58:12.960
Super antigens

58:13.920 --> 58:19.200
Then if you frame shift the super antigen it doesn't become a super duper antigen it becomes nonsense

58:22.080 --> 58:28.080
They know how it's frame shifting they can see it they can predict all the outcomes what what what

58:33.120 --> 58:38.880
It's not a surprise that this happens. It's not a surprise. It's an additional randomness. It's not good

58:39.840 --> 58:45.840
It's not great for anybody that's been transfected, but let's make one thing absolutely certain

58:47.360 --> 58:49.360
You can't make fun of the Nobel Prize

58:50.800 --> 58:53.280
Make fun of the people who got the Nobel Prize

58:54.160 --> 58:59.600
And say well, it's the n-methyl pseudo uridine that was a big mistake. Wow, I guess we shouldn't have hyped that

58:59.680 --> 59:05.920
I guess if we go back to just codon optimizing and you know, there's going to be a little more immune response

59:06.160 --> 59:13.840
Maybe that'll be okay. Maybe we can come up with some other solution besides that that will that will be read through the ribosomes better

59:15.440 --> 59:17.440
Maybe we can fix it

59:18.480 --> 59:20.480
That's where this goes

59:20.880 --> 59:22.880
That's where this goes

59:27.360 --> 59:29.360
They knew they knew this

59:30.880 --> 59:33.680
They knew it would happen. There's no question. They knew it would happen

59:34.640 --> 59:38.000
And so the only deal is is that they're slow rolling this out

59:38.880 --> 59:42.160
if anything you should take credit we should take credit for it because

59:42.800 --> 59:43.920
the only

59:43.920 --> 59:45.920
the only

59:45.920 --> 59:50.080
People are people following us that are listing the whole list

59:52.080 --> 59:56.000
The whole list, you know, not not some of the list, but the whole list

59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.360
The whole list of all the things that can go wrong in the

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.840
The

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.480
Whole list where is that? Do I have the whole list here?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.480
Darn it. My computer's running slow again

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.840
It's very angry at me. I don't know what's wrong. I think it's because

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.400
There's a bug on the computer from the NSA or something like that when they

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.720
Yeah, they don't like me streaming right now is my am my timing is still okay though

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.720
I

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.240
Think that that's really the way you need to realize that they are been fooling us fooling us fooling us

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.640
And they're going to keep fooling us as long as they can

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.640
And they're this is the list that they're they're we're just not going to ever have anybody else assemble this list

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.640
They're not going to assemble it

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.320
Because they don't want you to think about this whole list because the whole list starts with

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.280
Transfection is wholly inappropriate for healthy humans and then all the other reasons why

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.320
They're slow rolling this list out because we made this list

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.280
And I'm happy to give credit to Kevin McCurnan for helping me make this list

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.880
But he's not making this list anymore. He's not listing this list anymore

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.280
He's focused very much on two things here

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.760
And not very well

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.960
And not very

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.160
Whole focused or wholeheartedly

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.200
While having spent almost a half a year trying to burn me inside and out of chd. It's very strange

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.240
Sending emails complaining

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.680
Sending tweets complaining blocking me and then still tweeting about me

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.080
And

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:57.280
He did spend a better part of a year trying to I guess convince me of certain things

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.240
that he was the master of

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:07.680
Of sequencing reactions and the authority on the dissonance side for all the molecular things to the point where I just didn't know what I was

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.680
Talking about with clones and that clones were the same as natural viruses because

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.320
They both have error rates

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.320
Cooley doesn't know what he's talking about

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.800
Nanopore nanopore

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.840
I

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.520
We are at the precipice of this damn breaking

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.520
That's why I don't really have a good organized show tonight because I'm not really sure where to push because I know it's just all

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.160
Gonna collapse and I kind of don't want to be in front of it

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.240
And I think that was part of the whole idea of the book

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.080
Was to have me kind of in front of the dam while it went

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.600
But I'm not standing in front of the dam

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.480
I

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.040
Told everybody from the very very beginning

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.080
The book was written before I started I tried to put my biology in it and the biology that I put in it is in it

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.440
I'm not going to go back to this physician's climate change stuff anymore. Am I

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.200
For balsari

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.760
Hurricane Maria the storm which devastated Puerto Rico in we know what they're going to say

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.840
Um, we know what they're going to talk about. We know what they're going to say

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.560
It's the same stuff

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800
um

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.920
I'm not sure how to get us out of this other than to keep pushing hard on the the core of

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.520
the goof ballery

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.120
And I do think the core of the goof ballery is this right here

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480
um

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.720
I do really think that the core of the goof ballery is right here

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.720
and

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.920
This

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.320
Graph you can see deaths behind my head at 5000 per week

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.360
in blue you can see

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.440
the

01:03:53.440 --> 01:04:00.640
The deaths due to pneumonia in the yellow you can see the identified deaths due to influenza and in red you can see the

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.200
purported covid deaths

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.000
And the idea is is that these excess deaths

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.480
above the

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.240
Basically the blue repeated pattern from 2014

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.160
Is the this repeated pattern here

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.120
the excess from it is

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.680
the covid mystery virus

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.200
And of course we know the reason why this is not true is because

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:32.240
Although they showed us this all the time on pbs news hour. It actually they should have shown this

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.920
and

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:42.000
They should have done all of the math to subtract all of the things that contributed to these excess deaths that had nothing to do

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.200
with the super deadly novel virus

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.480
But they didn't do that and they're still not doing that

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.880
Three and a half four years were almost into the fifth year and they are not doing this

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.560
Only a handful of people on the internet are doing this

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.560
Everybody else is exquisitely ignoring it talking about super prions

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.800
Not talking about restoring strict liability to these products not talking about

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.600
Specific ways to solve the problem like challenging the the seventh amendment violation of our rights none of these things are discussed

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.760
By anyone on our side with any real vigor

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.040
To the average person it just needs to hear that you know what we need to do

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.320
We need to restore strict liability to the vaccines on the childhood schedule and this problem will go away

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.040
What do you mean by that Earl

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:54.800
Well, you better ask your smart lawyer friend that because I heard somebody on the news say we just need to restore strict liability

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.000
And I think that Kennedy guy's pretty smart. Wouldn't that be brilliant

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360
You

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.680
There's zero epidemiological evidence of spread now that we know this why doesn't somebody say it

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.120
They all had a big gathering. They all got to meet him in person in Romania

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.160
They flew him all the way around the world. They flew all those people all the way around the world

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:31.120
His talk made enough impression on Robert Malone that Robert Malone did a tweet and a sub stack about it

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.840
And never once mentioned that there was no epidemiological evidence of spread across borders anywhere in their data set

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.840
And that they had a data set for counties in the United States didn't even set anybody on fire

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:53.040
Nobody's tweeting about it. Jessica Rose took a selfie with him and wrote a sub stack about the breakfast

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.320
And

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.000
She's preparing a sub stack about the frame shift mutation and I'm sure

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.560
Mutations and I'm sure it's going to be terrifying

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.280
But there's no sub stack about zero epidemiological evidence of spread

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:16.880
There's no sub stack about the long list of reasons why the mystery virus is not equal to excess deaths

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.840
But

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.320
I'm glad to hear that the hotel breakfast was great

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:31.360
The projected Medicare costs in the coming years after 2020 and 21 have almost been completely avoided

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
The Medicare costs that all kinds of different government agencies were

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:42.960
Complaining about that it costs $500,000 to keep one of these old people alive on Medicare for half a year

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.960
That these costs were going to balloon in the coming years. It might even bankrupt the United States

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.600
They were talking about that as late as 1995

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.360
How convenient that they found a new way to get all these people that are costing a lot of money on Medicare to be

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.720
Ventilated out

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.880
And how curious it is that so many people in this excess death group died and are on Medicaid

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.680
I wonder how much Jessica Hockett has looked into that

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.760
I bet she could if she could get any death certificates and any data on who these

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.760
20,000 plus people that died at the beginning of this event this mass casualty event in New York City

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.960
I bet she could find out that a lot of them were on Medicare

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.400
And that perhaps years of medical costs were avoided having these people accidentally get COVID

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:46.000
Where are all the sleuths on these numbers? Where are all the sleuths finding out about these numbers in America and about what

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.120
costs were avoided

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.720
How come all the sleuths are going into the exobiology of super pre-owned zoonosis

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160
But nobody cares about

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.640
How we lied to create the illusion

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.040
Nobody cares to find out the extent of the lies

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Everybody is just annoyed

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320
That we've come to the point where

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.480
We're almost no virus people except curiously. I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna get a phone call anytime soon

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.240
Like with my with my no virus hat and my jacket

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.280
I'm sure I'm still not doing something right

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.840
Or I'm sure that my name inside of the cover of that book will be sufficient to disqualify me from ever

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400
and being able to be

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.960
Accepted as a fellow dissident against this nonsense

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.520
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best chance we've got

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.280
Of bringing significant change to our world

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.800
Is to try and just be honest about what happened be honest about how naive we were be honest about how taken we were

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.080
And i'll be the first to admit it. I didn't learn this fast enough in order to save my friends

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.320
I didn't figure it out fast enough in order to save my friends

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.840
And I blame a lot of these people because they confused me

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.560
on signal chats

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.880
They confused me in telegram groups. They confused me in discord chats

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.080
They confused me with private messages. They confused me in slack groups

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:39.520
And I think a lot of them did it on purpose because I was one of these people that needed controlling

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.200
Couldn't be bought

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.120
Couldn't give me to cheat

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.680
Couldn't give me to lie

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.680
So

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.480
So you had to lie to me

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.800
with multiple people

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.720
Lying about each other

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.720
Lying about knowing each other to try and fool me into trusting one of them

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.800
In order to influence my thinking in order to delay

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.760
my pronouncements in order to delay my

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560
eventual realization

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.760
That there was never any real virus in circulation

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.200
That it was all an elaborate hoax to get people to solve the mystery and think they were winning

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.800
And I got taken by it hook line and sinker

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.160
Cottrell mccairn

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.800
Rixie drastic

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.040
All of these people hook line and sinker

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.360
And i'm sure there are still people now who are fooling me

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
I don't doubt it

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:05.920
And so I go into every day assuming that there are going to be lies told right to my face over zoom right to my ear through my phone

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.080
Right to my eyes in the text

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400
Every day i'm lied to

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.800
Every day you are lied to

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.960
And the moment you get tired and you decide it's all over the lie will become the truth

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.600
The moment that you get tired and decide that it's not worth trying to explain to your kids the lie becomes the truth

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.440
The moment that you decide that you can't you don't have the balls to go home to a funeral and stand up for this

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.520
The lie becomes the truth

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.720
And yeah, I don't know where I stand anymore. I'm a little bit

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.320
I

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.680
I'm a little bit broken from this past weekend. I don't know if I missed an opportunity

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.120
If I did the right thing

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.440
But i've definitely come to the realization that i'm part of this

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:04.160
I made the mistake of listening to people who said that there might be a billion people dead that this might be a bioweapon

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.800
That I might not know

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.920
Enough about immunology to know that we're going to be okay. I had doubts because of these people

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360
I

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800
Because they were good at their job

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.720
Because the social media was good at fooling

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.160
Because they were riding in the car with me and lying to my face

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.880
In coordination with each other. That's how they did this

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.160
Oh boy

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.040
I think I'm gonna I'm gonna skip this part. I've been putting together a new

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.880
Slide deck, but I don't think it's ready to roll out. And so I'm just gonna keep doing study halls

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.640
And keep assembling the slide deck. We've got a few things planned for the holidays

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.280
Lots of stuff coming

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.720
I'm gonna try and be on most nights again. I had to take the weekend off though. I was I was pretty

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.680
exhausted emotionally and

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.520
I

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.160
Was pretty exhausted emotionally and both of my sons had a lot of basketball

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.440
And I just I couldn't push the button

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400
And tonight I didn't really have a plan

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.160
And so you know the the pbs news hour was kind of a impromptu thing

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.600
So I apologize for that also. I'm usually a little bit more organized than this

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.480
so

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.320
I think I'll just leave it there and I will promise to see you tomorrow

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.920
I have so many things that I want to get done this week for my regular day job

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.240
And uh, I have some

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.560
Wonderful

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.960
Family changes coming for the holidays. We have some visitors and stuff. So there's going to be a lot of joy in the house

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840
So I think there's going to be a lot of

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.880
Energy and possibility for me to share that energy with you guys. So I hope that

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.560
Um

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.880
December is going to be a really fun month for us

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.880
Into january and that we're going to really be able to end

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.160
2023 on an extremely positive note a series of really positive streams

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.920
um

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.960
uh a couple star trek streams, I think and also um enter 2020

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.640
for

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.440
On a very positive note as we push the ball forward

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.040
So many people are using our lingo

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.520
Taking our

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.440
Our ideas and running with them in different directions to try and distract people from their impact

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.640
And I don't think we really need to worry about it because what they're really doing is

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.680
Plugging holes in a dam that's beyond repair

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.560
And so all we need to do is just keep tapping and keep tapping and keep tapping and eventually it's going to happen

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.240
And the warm waters will flood over us all

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.160
The warm waters of the truth, which I'm really excited about

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.040
Um, and I'm really happy that a lot of you have been here for so long with me

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.680
Supporting my work

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.000
It's just been really cool. And I feel really good about where we're going and uh

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.000
And and how we're going to get there together. So thanks very much

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.440
Um, stop all transfections and humans

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.760
Don't let them eliminate the control group. They really did try

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.760
Um

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.880
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.320
Transfection helping humans is criminally negligent and viruses are not patterned integrity

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.240
When I get that slide deck done, we're going to make it the first one available

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.880
I guess it'll probably be done on thursday and we'll be able to vote for it together

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.040
um

01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.560
It's basically a slide deck that will reflect what I tried to do with the doctors for covid ethics a few days ago

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.600
with some better graphics with regard to

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.240
the clones

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.960
You might remember we had a graphic that looked something like this

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:19.440
And it was better because you could see the the whole flow of everything just a wee bit better

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.120
And if it was told right it would flow better

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:28.960
So I'm trying to get these all assembled in the slide deck that we can use and you can use

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.960
Because I haven't loaded up on in a while, but anyway, thank you very much for joining me

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.760
And I will see you again tomorrow night. Thank you

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760
You

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.040
Good to see everybody tonight. Good night Pamela
