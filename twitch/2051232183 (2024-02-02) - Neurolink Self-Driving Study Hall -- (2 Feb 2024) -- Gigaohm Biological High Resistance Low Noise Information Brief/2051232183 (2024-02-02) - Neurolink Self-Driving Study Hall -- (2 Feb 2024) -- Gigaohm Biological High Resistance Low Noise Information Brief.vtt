00:00.000 --> 00:11.920
I don't really have anything to drink except for my water which I guess okay maybe my

00:11.920 --> 00:14.740
Right

00:41.920 --> 00:43.920
.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.920
.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.920
.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.920
.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.920
.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.920
.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.920
.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.920
.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.920
.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.920
.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.920
.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.920
.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.920
.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.920
.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.920
.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.920
.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.920
.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.920
.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.920
.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.920
.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.920
.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.920
.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.920
.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.920
.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.920
.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.920
.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.920
.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.920
.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.920
.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.920
.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.920
.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.920
.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.920
.

02:02.920 --> 02:03.920
.

02:03.920 --> 02:04.920
.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.280
It's a medicine for it.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.840
This little box is of water with fish in them

02:09.840 --> 02:12.240
can be a real pain.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.400
Darn it.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.360
Fred Rogers had an aquarium.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.600
He never had it, can't it?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.200
It's annoying.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.520
The rules protect yourself at all times.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.920
Follow my structure.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.920
Keep it clean.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.200
Tough gloves if you wish.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.920
Let's do it.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.000
20 pounds.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.040
This is so crazy.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.240
Yes, happy birthday, everybody.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.680
Happy birthday to Katniss.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.520
Trying to mix it up a little bit with the tunes

02:49.520 --> 02:50.360
every once in a while.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.520
This one sounds really good in my ears.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.040
I don't know if it sounds very good on tinnies,

03:00.040 --> 03:03.760
tinnies, bones, beakers.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.240
But it's good to me.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.320
Yeah, so we're trying to do an earlier show in the afternoon

03:17.320 --> 03:19.280
because it works better for my family.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.120
I can probably put more time into it.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.120
It can look a little better, sound a little better,

03:24.120 --> 03:27.160
be a little more awake instead of trying to do it

03:27.160 --> 03:30.640
after basketball practice, which is sometimes just really

03:30.640 --> 03:31.480
zombie jade.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.120
And I don't like to bring you zombie jade all the time.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.400
I'm definitely sharper before dinner.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.800
I don't know why that is, but I get a little bit of a lull

03:49.800 --> 03:50.680
after eating.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.080
I need to wake myself up with a walk or something like that.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.040
That's what I usually do.

03:58.040 --> 04:04.400
There might be some repeats here.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.320
I'm trying to figure out a new little deck

04:06.320 --> 04:08.000
to start with, a little quicker.

04:08.000 --> 04:27.720
MUSIC

04:27.720 --> 04:31.320
We are standing firm as the control group, untransfected,

04:31.320 --> 04:36.400
but most of our kids have had all of their

04:36.480 --> 04:38.680
Mike Vandenberg of all of their shots.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.240
MUSIC

04:42.240 --> 04:47.080
There's a lot of us that have a lot of regrets that...

04:47.080 --> 04:52.640
MUSIC

04:52.640 --> 04:56.000
There's a lot of us that are still wrestling with this,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.760
the truth of the matter, that we didn't wake up very quick either.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.280
MUSIC

05:00.280 --> 05:03.760
And being humble about that is really important.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.200
Being humble about that and realizing that there are

05:07.200 --> 05:10.960
families of autistic kids, families of damaged children

05:10.960 --> 05:13.240
that have been fighting for this for many, many years,

05:13.240 --> 05:15.400
and we've just been oblivious.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.360
Because we have been actively participating in the illusion

05:19.360 --> 05:21.080
that keeps them hidden.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.720
We've been actively participating in this illusion,

05:23.720 --> 05:26.760
that anti-bax is some kind of a bad idea,

05:26.760 --> 05:31.360
that questioning the CDC or the vaccine schedule

05:31.360 --> 05:34.360
is somehow a bad idea.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.360
The people who are learning biology are starting to figure this out,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.360
that this was a ruse.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.160
This guy's not dangerous, this is not...

05:42.160 --> 05:44.960
This is not the guy who's responsible for...

05:44.960 --> 05:47.360
What did they say yesterday, 25?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.360
25?

05:49.360 --> 05:51.760
These aren't new slides, these are old slides actually.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.560
Some of these are old slides for more than a year ago,

05:54.560 --> 05:57.360
a couple of them are even older than that.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.960
This is what we're up against right here.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.960
We're up against a room full of people, full of computers.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.960
We're up against a group of people that has been trained

06:06.960 --> 06:09.960
and put in place.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.960
This is how the show is run nowadays,

06:12.960 --> 06:15.960
and if we don't keep swinging for our children,

06:15.960 --> 06:17.960
they're gonna wake up inside of this cage

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
and not even know it exists.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.960
That was their plan all along.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.960
Listen to me, mister, poke, poke, poke.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
Viva Fry!

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
Oh my goodness, there you go.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.960
Well, the hope is in our history, right?

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
The hope is in our history.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.960
Go look at these people before the pandemic.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.960
Go find out what they were doing before the pandemic.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.960
Go find out what they were doing before the pandemic.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.960
Go find out what they were doing before the pandemic.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.960
This is what I want to address today,

07:00.960 --> 07:02.960
the idea that there's only one chance in history

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
to collect the data that they need for their God

07:04.960 --> 07:06.960
to solve all of humanity's problems.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
I really want to address this idea

07:08.960 --> 07:14.960
because these charlatans have taken the richest,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.960
most powerful economically at least people in the world

07:17.960 --> 07:20.960
and bamboozled them with this idea.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.960
They have bamboozled them with the idea

07:24.960 --> 07:28.960
that AI and data is enough to conquer the human genome

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
and to become the transgenic futurist

07:30.960 --> 07:33.960
that we are always destined to be.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.960
And they need to ignore an awful lot of biology to sell this.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.960
And so that's why I think it's really important

07:41.960 --> 07:44.960
that we work together to get this biology out there.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.960
41 people in the afternoon

07:48.960 --> 07:50.960
is making me very, very happy, guys.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.960
This is a stream brought to you by a patch plan

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
for physiologists.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.960
Gigaum is a resistance measurement

07:56.960 --> 07:59.960
that needs to be attained in order to make these

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
high-resistance low-noise recordings

08:01.960 --> 08:04.960
that I used to make a living teaching people how to do.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.960
And now it's back to the drawing board

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
back to what I always should have been doing,

08:09.960 --> 08:11.960
which is teaching.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.960
And welcome to the show.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.960
This is Gigaum Biological.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.960
If you are here at the top of the way

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
that we've been watching for a while,

08:18.960 --> 08:20.960
and otherwise you might be a skilled TV watcher

08:20.960 --> 08:23.960
who's about to become released from this

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
was that really loud and I was into that.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.960
And so welcome to the show.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.960
This is a place where we stay focused on the biology.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.960
We don't take their bait on TV and we love our neighbors.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.960
That's how we get through this.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
That's the main message.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.960
And how it works is that there are a lot of beautiful people

08:40.960 --> 08:43.960
who have decided to subscribe or send donations.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.960
And there are a lot more beautiful people

08:45.960 --> 08:47.960
who consistently spread the word

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
about this work each week.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.960
And this biology finds new people and kabang.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
This is where it happens.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.960
If you want to help out, gigaombiological.com.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
If you want to communicate with me,

08:59.960 --> 09:02.960
probably the best place is to try at gigaom.bio

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
or just send me an email.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.960
If you scroll down, you can find that.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.960
There's a place to find my admission at Scooby-Doo.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.960
A one-time support link.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.960
And then if you scroll down, you can find a place to subscribe,

09:14.960 --> 09:17.960
which is actually going forward.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.960
Probably the best thing for my family.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
Something we can count on.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
Something we can sort of look at as a scoreboard

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
that we know that at the end of the month

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
we're going to have enough rent.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.960
Right now we have 27 days left in this month

09:29.960 --> 09:32.960
in order to round up enough rent.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.960
And so that's really what we're doing.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
We're just trying to do that and people like Simon

09:36.960 --> 09:39.960
and Fabrizio and Catherine and Caroline and Lori

09:39.960 --> 09:42.960
and Michelle and Leo and Jeffrey

09:42.960 --> 09:45.960
and all these people like Greg James and Christian

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
and Rodney and Stefan, they all help.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.960
And all of these subscribers are the reason

09:50.960 --> 09:54.960
why I feel the courage to try and keep this going

09:54.960 --> 09:59.960
and if we can get enough subscribers.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.960
I know for sure a thousand subscribers is enough,

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
but something a little under that might be okay.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.960
So that's really just what I'm trying to say.

10:06.960 --> 10:07.960
It's a real easy number.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.960
I don't think it's very much to ask from the Internet.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.960
You can't help financially.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.960
You can help by sharing.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.960
And that might even mean getting a social media account

10:17.960 --> 10:20.960
and doing it specifically to share this work.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.960
And that's it.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.960
You don't have to read Twitter.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.960
Just get on Twitter and start posting.

10:25.960 --> 10:30.960
And that can also be a way of helping.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.960
So this is a independent bright web presentation.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.960
I don't know what the independent bright web is,

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
other than a bunch of people supported by people like you

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
that are trying to dispel this narrative

10:40.960 --> 10:43.960
that they want to govern our children by this narrative

10:43.960 --> 10:47.960
of an ongoing RNA-viral pandemic whose likely source

10:47.960 --> 10:48.960
has gained a function.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.960
We are entering the fifth year of this charade

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
and in order to break out we need to teach our kids

10:54.960 --> 10:56.960
that this was just a fate.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.960
A faith that we've all been coerced into accepting

10:58.960 --> 11:00.960
and we don't have to accept it.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.960
And I think we've got to do a lot about it.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.960
And we can, by teaching our kids the fundamental biology

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
that underpins these three statements,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.960
especially the first two are the first one.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.960
I'm online.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.960
It's okay.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
But, yeah.

11:12.960 --> 11:13.960
It's okay.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
It's okay.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
It's okay.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
It's okay.

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
It's okay.

11:17.960 --> 11:18.960
It's okay.

11:18.960 --> 11:19.960
It's okay.

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
It's okay.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
It's okay.

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
It's okay.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
It's okay.

11:23.960 --> 11:24.960
It's okay.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
It's okay.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
Yeah.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
We don't have to do it right now.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
Oh.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
What?

11:29.960 --> 11:30.960
I need a light.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.960
No, I'm okay.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
You can bring tea when you make your own.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.960
Thank you.

11:34.960 --> 11:41.960
Talking about the fish tank water, as I mentioned,

11:41.960 --> 11:42.960
we're going to do it.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.960
I want to do a way to treat it with my son

11:44.960 --> 11:46.960
so that he can at least see how I'm going to do it.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.960
We are fighting against this faith in a novel virus

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
as I just said a minute ago,

11:51.960 --> 11:53.960
the way to fight it is to see the truth,

11:53.960 --> 11:55.960
where it is on the street.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.960
That means no spread in New York City.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.960
Infectious clones are the only real threat.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.960
placebo batches are likely to distribute in

12:01.960 --> 12:02.960
transfection and healthy mammals.

12:02.960 --> 12:03.960
It's dumb.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.960
Protocols were murder, gain of function is a big

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
mythology.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.960
The Scooby-Doo that you've been fooled into solving

12:08.960 --> 12:09.960
a mystery.

12:09.960 --> 12:10.960
This is real.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
And it's because of a spectacular commitment

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
to lies.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.960
That's what we've got going here.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.960
That's what we've got going here.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.960
Oh, yeah, right.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.960
Remember this?

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
This was always a fun one.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
I like this a lot.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.960
What someone pointed that they had a talk.

12:26.960 --> 12:35.960
So, yes, I wanted to do a study hall today to try and

12:35.960 --> 12:38.960
expand your mind a little bit and use something

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
completely out of left field.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.960
Every once in a while, I feel like it's okay to get

12:43.960 --> 12:44.960
a curve ball.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.960
And today I thought I'd throw you a little curve ball.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.960
It is a curve ball not meant to shift a paradigm

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
or anything like that.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.960
That paradigm shift has already occurred.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.960
And now they're just trying to pretend that it

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
didn't happen.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.960
And so we're going to try and make gentle the life

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
of this world.

13:01.960 --> 13:07.960
And we're going to try and, you know, stay focused.

13:07.960 --> 13:08.960
Is this repeating?

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
Oh, no.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
I cut that out.

13:10.960 --> 13:11.960
Okay.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
It looks like it's a little bit repeating.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.960
This should be a flash up.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
Yes.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.960
Okay, great.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.960
Thank you.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
Thank you.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.960
Thank you.

13:19.960 --> 13:20.960
Thank you.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
Thank you.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.960
A little bit.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
I have to fix this start up a little bit.

13:25.960 --> 13:26.960
Don't forget.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.960
This stream is especially possible because of my

13:29.960 --> 13:31.960
wife and best friend.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.960
Please don't forget that.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.960
And now that if you subscribe, you're actually

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
going to be communicating with me and her,

13:37.960 --> 13:40.960
which is interesting, maybe for some people, I don't

13:40.960 --> 13:43.960
know, to find out that it's really just a family

13:43.960 --> 13:45.960
that's going to be doing this pandemic.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.960
United noncompliance is the only way out.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.960
And the illusion is sustained through your active

13:51.960 --> 13:52.960
participation.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.960
So we've got to stop listening to these people.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.960
That's really the idea here.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.960
And so as we move forward, whoa.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.960
Should have gone over here.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.960
As we move forward, yeah.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.960
That's really how we have to think about it with one

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
another.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.960
Whenever they try to throw a little something our way,

14:12.960 --> 14:15.960
we really need to not take that bait.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.960
And that's I think the most important thing.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.960
Not to fall victim to the coercion that's most

14:23.960 --> 14:26.960
certainly going to come in the future.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.960
Again, it's February 2nd, 2024.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.960
I'm trying to do a little afternoon study hall here

14:31.960 --> 14:34.960
to bring you the independent bright web in a different

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
way in a different time.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.960
Hopefully this will help my family a little bit with

14:38.960 --> 14:41.960
regard to, you know, having me around when it actually

14:41.960 --> 14:44.960
matters, like at dinner time, that kind of thing.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.960
In any respect, this is going to be easier for me

14:47.960 --> 14:49.960
because it's not going to keep me up until the middle

14:49.960 --> 14:53.960
of the night, which a lot of times I find myself up

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
until the middle of the night after I stream until

14:55.960 --> 14:56.960
midnight.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.960
And that's not good for my long term health.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.960
So we're going to try and stop misleading the young

15:00.960 --> 15:01.960
here.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
And I think the way we stop misleading the young is

15:03.960 --> 15:06.960
to really teach them their history so that they

15:06.960 --> 15:10.960
understand that there are, there isn't a concern

15:10.960 --> 15:12.960
that there are, there are some things that are

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
not going to be enforced.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.960
But this is a concerted effort to manipulate our

15:15.960 --> 15:18.960
habits and opinions in order to govern us.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.960
And this is not the democracy quote unquote that they

15:21.960 --> 15:23.960
talk about on television.

15:23.960 --> 15:24.960
It's not the nightly news.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.960
But in fact, it's the inversion of that.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
And all of these, you know, conspiracy theories

15:29.960 --> 15:32.960
that say the left ring news and the right wing news

15:32.960 --> 15:35.960
is not readable or not fundable.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.960
This is all, this is all a hoax.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.960
And I'm trying to get you to fight about a limited

15:41.960 --> 15:43.960
spectrum of debate with every reality.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.960
We'll never get you free no matter who you vote for.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.960
And as a 52 year old man, it's only now really obvious

15:49.960 --> 15:52.960
to me how often my family and my father was being

15:52.960 --> 15:57.960
jerked around by the, the governing establishment and

15:57.960 --> 16:00.960
now it's become ever more possible with the expansion

16:00.960 --> 16:01.960
into social media.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.960
And that's really the point here is that we can really

16:06.960 --> 16:09.960
see how dangerous will bump in the table here.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.960
How dangerous this has become, especially if we see

16:13.960 --> 16:16.960
and we look at our small kids, our young teenagers.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.960
This is just a horrible, horrible situation where

16:20.960 --> 16:23.960
on their phone with roadblocks and with,

16:23.960 --> 16:27.960
with Fortnite and with, with all of these apps,

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
it's just become a nightmare.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.960
And it's not very far away from the cartoon behind my head.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.960
And that's how they've gotten us to essentially give up

16:37.960 --> 16:40.960
the right to informed consent.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.960
We, we aren't even really informed enough to understand

16:43.960 --> 16:46.960
that we should expect them to provide informed consent.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.960
That's how sadly our children are being educated

16:50.960 --> 16:52.960
about recent history.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
And it's not that long ago, right?

16:55.960 --> 16:56.960
I apologize.

16:56.960 --> 17:03.960
I have a little bit of a dry whistle there.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.960
And so it's the spread of bad ideas that's much scarier

17:07.960 --> 17:09.960
than the spread of any RNA molecule.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.960
And I've been tracking a lot of these people since the

17:12.960 --> 17:15.960
beginning because I have assumed I got,

17:15.960 --> 17:19.960
I went out into the world as a naive medical professor

17:19.960 --> 17:23.960
being, being essentially sent home for not wanting to get

17:23.960 --> 17:27.960
my temperature taken and wear a mask all day.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.960
I went into this completely naive thinking that the vast

17:30.960 --> 17:32.960
majority of the people that I would run into,

17:32.960 --> 17:35.960
that I would encounter, that I would contact, that I would

17:35.960 --> 17:38.960
call and seek out for help would be people that would

17:38.960 --> 17:41.960
legitimately be on my side.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.960
And over the last four years, it's become painfully obvious

17:44.960 --> 17:49.960
that many of the people that sought me out were never on

17:49.960 --> 17:54.960
my side, even as they professed to be.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.960
And so if you've only been dipping your toes in the

17:58.960 --> 18:01.960
water on Twitter, trying to decide who to follow,

18:01.960 --> 18:04.960
or if you've only been looking at Instagram to decide

18:04.960 --> 18:10.960
who to follow, you know nothing.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.960
Chances are very good that you follow people who follow

18:12.960 --> 18:15.960
each other and promote each other so that when you get

18:15.960 --> 18:19.960
sucked into that, that, that whirlpool,

18:19.960 --> 18:23.960
the exact narratives, the exact questions,

18:23.960 --> 18:28.960
and the exact ideas are amplified as would the script

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
desire.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.960
It's only with extremely hard work,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.960
an extremely studious filtering.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.960
Can you get to the point where you can kind of sense who has

18:39.960 --> 18:42.960
been playing the game fair from the beginning?

18:42.960 --> 18:45.960
And I'm sure, I am absolutely sure that I'm not right

18:45.960 --> 18:48.960
about most of these people still.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.960
If what I have learned in the last four years is true,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.960
then I am still mistaken about a good portion of these

18:55.960 --> 18:56.960
people.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.960
And when I say mistaken, I mean even less of them have

18:59.960 --> 19:02.960
our children's best interest in mind.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.960
I know that's not, I know that's not a very positive

19:06.960 --> 19:08.960
message.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.960
But this is not a self-help group.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.960
This is not a group that's looking to build a coalition.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.960
The independent bright web is exactly what I mean it is.

19:19.960 --> 19:23.960
It's a bunch of independent points shining a light on

19:23.960 --> 19:27.960
the same thing from different angles to illuminate something

19:27.960 --> 19:30.960
that's too big for any one of us to illuminate.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.960
And if we are indeed all working to illuminate the same thing,

19:34.960 --> 19:37.960
then in the end, that thing will be the most visible.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.960
If we are not trying to coordinate our actions,

19:41.960 --> 19:43.960
if we are not trying to coordinate where we go,

19:43.960 --> 19:45.960
he has to a certain extent, I get it.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.960
If we're all illuminating the back end of whatever we're

19:48.960 --> 19:50.960
trying to illuminate, then no one will ever be

19:50.960 --> 19:51.960
illuminating the front.

19:51.960 --> 19:52.960
Great.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.960
The analogy is a little bit weak.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.960
But what I want you to understand is that there's no reason

19:57.960 --> 20:00.960
for us to all declare a team.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.960
There's no reason for me to be friends with any of these

20:03.960 --> 20:04.960
people because of what I do.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.960
All I do is teach biology, talk about biology,

20:07.960 --> 20:11.960
listen to people speak and then say that I don't understand what

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
they're saying.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.960
I don't do a lot.

20:13.960 --> 20:18.960
And yet somehow or another, what I'm doing and who I'm listening

20:18.960 --> 20:24.960
to and who I'm interpreting, who I'm talking about is has become

20:24.960 --> 20:25.960
very important.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.960
And I think it's because the light that we are shining is shining

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
on the right thing.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.960
Our flashlights are held high and they are pointed in the right

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
direction.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
That's the way out of the cave.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.960
And so if we keep doing the work we're doing, keep focused the

20:41.960 --> 20:43.960
way we are focused, keep our arms straight.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
Big things are going to happen.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.960
I really, really believe this.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.960
And so one of the things that I've been trying to emphasize

20:52.960 --> 20:54.960
over the last few weeks, and I think I've really been hitting at

20:54.960 --> 20:59.960
home since about December 23rd, 2023.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.960
You can find that as the dark days of Christmas part two.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.960
And if you look at the big titles, you can see the date.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.960
So you can find the stream from the 23rd of December and you can

21:14.960 --> 21:20.960
watch from about the 35th minute until the 45th minute, 10 minutes

21:20.960 --> 21:27.960
of that is somewhere in there is what changed my life recently.

21:28.960 --> 21:33.960
And I believe that meddling in there is this amorphous web of

21:33.960 --> 21:37.960
people, not necessarily that all of them know one another or

21:37.960 --> 21:38.960
coordinate with one another.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.960
They haven't all been at the same table together and not for a

21:41.960 --> 21:42.960
long time anyway.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.960
But they are a group of people or groups of people that were

21:46.960 --> 21:49.960
there put in place to assure that the worst case scenario

21:49.960 --> 21:52.960
narrative was not only considered, but considered to be pretty

21:52.960 --> 21:56.960
likely, especially by people speculating off camera by right

21:56.960 --> 22:00.960
people writing blogs, by people working social media.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.960
And there were two basic types of people.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.960
The first one was kind of like this guy, the raccoon leader

22:07.960 --> 22:11.960
dude, explore and repeat the worst case scenario narratives of a

22:11.960 --> 22:15.960
gain of function virus escape versus international or intentional

22:15.960 --> 22:17.960
release for depopulation.

22:17.960 --> 22:21.960
So this is a person and there are many of these characters that

22:21.960 --> 22:24.960
were out there talking from the very beginning about how bad this

22:24.960 --> 22:27.960
was about how dangerous a potential gain of function virus

22:27.960 --> 22:30.960
could be because they would have engineered it to be much worse.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.960
And this engineering it to be much worse is above and beyond

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
whatever mother nature could have done.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.960
And usually the engineering to be much worse is centered around

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
the spike protein.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.960
That was the first two years of the worst case scenario people

22:44.960 --> 22:46.960
like like that clown.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.960
And I say clown because he's dressed like a clown here.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.960
The other kind are experts who chase down an unmasked bad guys

22:54.960 --> 22:58.960
identify problems and offer solutions or ask irrelevant questions.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.960
And so here again, I have your two dudes who are pushing forward

23:03.960 --> 23:07.960
the double stranded DNA contamination.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.960
You will know that Phillip Buckholz is the guy who spoke in front

23:10.960 --> 23:13.960
of the South Carolina Senate and said that he would still give

23:13.960 --> 23:14.960
this shot to his parents.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.960
But because there's DNA and he might not give it to his daughter.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.960
And that it would be probably pretty safe if they could get the

23:22.960 --> 23:24.960
DNA out.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
And so he's offered on the Internet to sequence people's

23:27.960 --> 23:30.960
cells or something like that to find out if there's any DNA

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
integration.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.960
And I'm sure that they'll work together to prove that there

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
was no DNA integration in the end.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.960
It's it looks ugly, but it was fine.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
Nothing's going to come out of it.

23:40.960 --> 23:41.960
I assure you.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.960
And if it does, it will be something that will that will that

23:44.960 --> 23:50.960
will absolve the transfection as being potentially dangerous and

23:50.960 --> 23:55.960
instead allow the complete blame to be placed on the double

23:55.960 --> 23:59.960
stranded DNA contamination in the rushing that resulted in that

23:59.960 --> 24:03.960
the process to that resulted in that instead of them

24:03.960 --> 24:06.960
acknowledging that transfection in its finest form would have

24:06.960 --> 24:09.960
still been dangerous and uninappropriate for healthy

24:09.960 --> 24:10.960
humans.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
That's what these worst case scenario operatives are

24:13.960 --> 24:17.960
trying to make sure that our children never realize.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.960
They don't want our children to realize the transfection in

24:21.960 --> 24:25.960
healthy humans was criminally negligent no matter how it was

24:25.960 --> 24:27.960
produced.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.960
And process one versus process two.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.960
If there is a danger of endotoxins and all this other stuff in

24:35.960 --> 24:38.960
process two, it is a compounding on top of the already

24:38.960 --> 24:42.960
criminally negligent use of transfection on healthy people.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.960
I hope I'm making that clear.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.960
And so this team of worst case scenario is a key issue to

24:50.960 --> 24:53.960
understand because if you understand it, then you will also be

24:53.960 --> 24:56.960
able to better interpret what these people are doing and not doing

24:56.960 --> 24:59.960
what these people are doing, rather saying and not saying.

24:59.960 --> 25:04.960
As they protect the novel virus, they also protect the idea that

25:04.960 --> 25:08.960
the number of people that was killed is nonzero.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.960
The number of people that the virus continues to infect is

25:11.960 --> 25:12.960
nonzero.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.960
That's part of what they need to protect.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.960
That's what you saw with Steve Kirsch and Denny Rancore

25:18.960 --> 25:21.960
last night where he says over and over, do you believe that?

25:21.960 --> 25:22.960
Yes or no?

25:22.960 --> 25:23.960
Do you accept that there was a virus?

25:23.960 --> 25:25.960
Do you accept that there was something novel?

25:25.960 --> 25:29.960
What about this oxygenation level in people's blood?

25:29.960 --> 25:33.960
These EMTs said they've never seen anything like it.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.960
Maybe it's because people were never measuring that all the time.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.960
But I don't know, maybe they were, but he rules out everything

25:40.960 --> 25:43.960
except a novel pathogen, a novel virus.

25:43.960 --> 25:44.960
It couldn't be a toxin.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
It couldn't be panic attacks.

25:46.960 --> 25:53.960
It couldn't be a chemical sprayed into the subway.

25:53.960 --> 26:00.960
And so all of these considerations are usually a dichotomy.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.960
They're usually a or a B.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.960
And so in this case, you know, was it a natural virus that came from a

26:06.960 --> 26:10.960
bat cave or was it a a virus that was enriched on a cell culture?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.960
Or was it a virus that was enriched in an animal culture?

26:13.960 --> 26:17.960
Or did we stitch it together?

26:17.960 --> 26:20.960
And now the argument has always been about whether or not it's a lab

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
leak or a natural virus.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.960
And there's just many different ways that you could get a lab

26:25.960 --> 26:29.960
virus, which makes it even more of an enticing solution.

26:29.960 --> 26:37.960
It makes it even a more swallowable future outcome.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.960
This gain of function virus being the worst case scenario.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.960
And if we didn't, if this was one that, you know, wasn't so bad,

26:45.960 --> 26:49.960
but it did leak, then the worst case scenario is for sure real because

26:49.960 --> 26:53.960
obviously they could build a more dangerous one.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.960
And none of these people, none of these people, none of these people

26:56.960 --> 26:59.960
will address this foundational idea that we're going to put up

26:59.960 --> 27:03.960
on the screen every day until this show doesn't need to run anymore.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.960
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the

27:06.960 --> 27:09.960
intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

27:09.960 --> 27:10.960
Why is it dumb?

27:10.960 --> 27:15.960
Because it implies a level of mastery, a level of fidelity in

27:15.960 --> 27:19.960
understanding that these people do not have, that the CDC doesn't have,

27:19.960 --> 27:23.960
that the immunologists at the NIH do not have.

27:23.960 --> 27:27.960
They do not have the fidelity of understanding of a four-year-old

27:27.960 --> 27:33.960
or a six-month-old child's immune system to have the audacity,

27:33.960 --> 27:37.960
the confidence to say that they can inject millions of children

27:37.960 --> 27:42.960
intramuscularly with a combination of toxins and recombinant proteins.

27:42.960 --> 27:49.960
Never mind injecting a transfection agent RNA wrapped in a lipo nanoparticle,

27:49.960 --> 27:53.960
a lipo cationic coat.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.960
This is absurd.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.960
And some people knew it was absurd from the very beginning,

27:59.960 --> 28:02.960
and others did not, and some of them should have known,

28:02.960 --> 28:07.960
and that's why it's called criminal negligence.

28:07.960 --> 28:13.960
There are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, or tens of thousands

28:13.960 --> 28:17.960
of biologists, academic biologists that should have known better.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.960
Academic MDs that should have known better because they've used

28:21.960 --> 28:25.960
transfection in their laboratory, so they have no excuse to think

28:25.960 --> 28:27.960
that this would be an appropriate therapeutic.

28:27.960 --> 28:31.960
No matter what proprietary lipid nanoparticles were used,

28:31.960 --> 28:37.960
this is the foundation of the objection.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
That it's criminally negligent.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.960
It's like, you know, you're a construction worker.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.960
You work on the big machinery all the time.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.960
You knew that you couldn't let the four-year-old drive the end loader.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.960
That's criminally negligent.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.960
You are a molecular biologist.

28:54.960 --> 28:59.960
You are an MD PhD working at a top 10 medical school,

28:59.960 --> 29:03.960
and you use transfection in your animal model every day, every week,

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
with your grad students.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.960
You should have known better that no form of transfection

29:08.960 --> 29:13.960
would be appropriate for young people, for college-age kids.

29:17.960 --> 29:22.960
I mean, how much more obvious can it be that we're still not talking

29:22.960 --> 29:27.960
about this on Twitter and, you know, Tucker Carlson and Brett Weinstein

29:27.960 --> 29:34.960
don't cover this stuff because it's not about that anymore.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
This is the slow roll.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.960
We're going to get there in, like, eight years.

29:39.960 --> 29:44.960
We're going to get there in eight years when we're using an anovial-based

29:44.960 --> 29:49.960
electroporation for required immunizations in children in the United States.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
Then we'll get there.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.960
Boy, that transfection intramuscularly was crazy, wasn't it?

29:54.960 --> 29:59.960
I can't believe we used to put adjuvants in with these recombinant proteins.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.960
Whoo!

30:00.960 --> 30:02.960
Snake oil days.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.960
What I want is high morbidity.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.960
I want people to complain.

30:07.960 --> 30:11.960
And so what I am trying to suggest is that something occurred,

30:11.960 --> 30:13.960
something was done to us.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.960
I don't know how it was done to us.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.960
I don't know if it was a plan that was waiting to be put in motion,

30:20.960 --> 30:23.960
and then the Chinese put it in motion.

30:23.960 --> 30:27.960
I don't know if we attacked the Chinese in order to put it in motion.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
I don't know.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
I don't know.

30:29.960 --> 30:30.960
I don't know.

30:30.960 --> 30:35.960
But what I do know is that somebody like James Giordano has already explained

30:35.960 --> 30:40.960
a number of different ways, how a toxin or a molecular biological agent

30:40.960 --> 30:49.960
could be used to seed the symptoms and perhaps the molecular biology of a spreading pathogen.

30:49.960 --> 30:54.960
And that using the Internet, you might be able to confound that signal

30:54.960 --> 30:57.960
with a dangerous spreading pathogen.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.960
And that's really the argument I'm trying to make.

31:00.960 --> 31:06.960
Clones could have been used to seed a very, very, very clear molecular signal

31:06.960 --> 31:10.960
that would never otherwise be able to be done with a coronavirus.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.960
A coronavirus doesn't spread like that.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.960
And yet somehow or another, hey, a guy who was like,

31:17.960 --> 31:22.960
it was almost like he had symptoms for two weeks, it said, the Sohomish County man.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.960
And then he came into the hospital.

31:24.960 --> 31:29.960
Then they sampled him and they got this really robust growing culture

31:29.960 --> 31:34.960
that provided them with a perfect sequence that matched Wuhan exactly.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
This is not serendipity.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.960
I would suggest that this is exactly what they needed to do to once and for all,

31:42.960 --> 31:46.960
established to all of these naive bench scientists that look,

31:46.960 --> 31:52.960
this is the molecular biology of coronavirus virology accepted.

31:52.960 --> 31:59.960
You don't think that they would have used, they would have done something like spray DNA all over.

32:00.960 --> 32:07.960
That would have been inert on countertops in order to get a signal to be everywhere

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
and then call it spread.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.960
You don't think that that's an option?

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
Of course, it's an option.

32:12.960 --> 32:18.960
Of course, it's a possibility because the opposite of this possibility

32:18.960 --> 32:23.960
is that the hospital protocols didn't really make a meaningful difference.

32:23.960 --> 32:28.960
That the change in emergency policies didn't make a big difference.

32:28.960 --> 32:35.960
And in fact, it was this mRNA molecule that started out with a few thousand copies

32:35.960 --> 32:44.960
that has now covered the inhabited globe with itself or copies of itself,

32:44.960 --> 32:46.960
descendants of itself.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.960
Insects can't do this.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.960
Mammals can't do this.

32:52.960 --> 33:02.960
Even the most invasive insect can't do this, and yet an RNA molecule with none of its own machinery

33:02.960 --> 33:07.960
is purported to have started at a point in Wuhan and then progressively gone

33:07.960 --> 33:13.960
around the world changing flavors like Baskin Robbins 31.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.960
And we are supposed to believe this because the diffuse proposal was leaked,

33:17.960 --> 33:24.960
because Peter Desak is a creep because Rand Paul and Tony Fauci have argued

33:24.960 --> 33:28.960
because we saw redacted emails and even Slack messages.

33:28.960 --> 33:33.960
We're supposed to believe this because a U.S. right-to-know FOIA request

33:33.960 --> 33:36.960
revealed that they ordered those enzymes.

33:41.960 --> 33:45.960
We are being made to believe that this occurred

33:45.960 --> 33:48.960
because they want to govern our children with this mythology.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.960
They want us to pass this mythology on to our children.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.960
That's what they want to do.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.960
And so they've doing that with an illusion of consensus.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.960
And I noticed this week that there's another illusion of consensus.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.960
An illusion of consensus that electric cars are great.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
An illusion of consensus that Neuralink is great.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.960
Hand that Elon Musk is a genius.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.960
So I wanted to look into this a little bit.

34:13.960 --> 34:21.960
And the way that I wanted to look into it is with looking at a few videos

34:21.960 --> 34:23.960
because, you know, that's what's fun to do.

34:23.960 --> 34:27.960
So let me check this out here.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
Which one am I going to start with?

34:28.960 --> 34:30.960
Tesla Autopilot.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.960
Oops, this one.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.960
Is that one?

34:32.960 --> 34:33.960
Yeah.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.960
That one.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Yeah.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
And this one.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.960
Okay, so first we're going to start with the Wall Street Journal exclusive video

34:40.960 --> 34:42.960
that was put out about a month ago.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.960
If you're not aware.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.960
Let me just throw this slide back up here to make sure that we're still on the same page here.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.960
If you're not aware, right?

34:49.960 --> 34:54.960
I mean, Elon Musk is this guy who, from my perspective, let's see.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.960
Elon Musk.

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
What does he do?

34:56.960 --> 35:00.960
He's a rocket scientist.

35:00.960 --> 35:05.960
He has a tunneling or mining or tunneling company with like these big tunneling things.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.960
He's building stuff underground.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.960
He's doing satellites also with the space thing, right?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.960
And relanding rockets and stuff like that.

35:13.960 --> 35:19.960
And then he's also a neuroscientist because he's implanting stuff in people's heads.

35:19.960 --> 35:24.960
And he also is some kind of engineer because he's making electric cars.

35:24.960 --> 35:31.960
Now, the weird thing about this is, is that I'm pretty sure that most of this stuff is being done with.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.960
Sorry, thank you.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
Is being done with government money.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.960
So he gets money that would have gone to NASA.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.960
He gets to do this stuff.

35:41.960 --> 35:47.960
I don't know where all this money's coming from, DARPA, DOD, whatever.

35:47.960 --> 35:52.960
But I know for sure that this is not a guy who, through the profit of his companies,

35:52.960 --> 36:02.960
through grant writing and through just the sheer sort of jogger knot of success that is based on his ideas.

36:03.960 --> 36:11.960
This is sort of an artificial rise because you don't start a rocket company.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.960
That's not how that works.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.960
You don't start a satellite company.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
That's not how that works.

36:16.960 --> 36:21.960
You don't start a tunnel under major metropolitan areas company.

36:21.960 --> 36:26.960
And you don't start a non-subsidized electric car company.

36:26.960 --> 36:31.960
Now, one of the things that I think is so cool about this is that Elon Musk,

36:31.960 --> 36:37.960
in my mind, feels like one of these people that really stretches the narrative so far, it's absurd.

36:37.960 --> 36:43.960
And what I'm meaning by that is that, I don't know, I'll give you an example off the top of my head,

36:43.960 --> 36:47.960
which means something to me, but it might not mean something to you.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.960
You can go look up a video on YouTube and I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts.

36:52.960 --> 36:58.960
You could get it if you just looked LeBron James and photographic memory.

36:58.960 --> 37:09.960
And what you will most likely find is this really striking interview where he might even be in like a fur coat or something, you know, after the game and he's got big sunglasses on.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.960
And this dude asks him a question about what happened in the game.

37:16.960 --> 37:21.960
And he asks a question which triggers LeBron's memory.

37:21.960 --> 37:30.960
And then LeBron goes on to exactly describe the three plays that led to the question that this guy had.

37:30.960 --> 37:42.960
And this YouTuber took the game and played it live while that press conference description is happening.

37:43.960 --> 37:58.960
And it becomes very obvious that LeBron James is sharp as a knife because I understand he's playing basketball and stuff, but that the memory is not just like, yeah, I think, you know, one of my teammates had the ball and then we passed it up and then this happened.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.960
No, it was like step for step.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.960
What happened.

38:04.960 --> 38:14.960
And then explained why he made the decision that he did. So what I am saying there with a very long story is is that it doesn't take long.

38:14.960 --> 38:26.960
If you are around someone or you listen to or you watch a video of someone with natural greatness to see it shine through if you watch a video of Rodney Mullen, you'll see it.

38:27.960 --> 38:36.960
I think Daniel Dennett can be a really sharp guy to listen to.

38:36.960 --> 38:53.960
I'm trying to think of some other people that really but but Daniel Dennett doesn't have the thing that Rodney Mullen has doesn't have the thing that Steve Jobs had doesn't have the thing that and I would argue that that Elon Musk doesn't, he doesn't have it at all.

38:53.960 --> 39:10.960
He really comes off as a very, very average guy. And so it's very hard to believe that if you get behind the scenes and you put him in the room with his engineers that he suddenly evolves in or he he metamorphosis sizes or metamorphosis into this

39:11.960 --> 39:18.960
person that can speak very articulated articulately about about complex ideas.

39:18.960 --> 39:37.960
If he can't get in front of an audience of of of lay people and express, you know, complex ideas then then how in the world is it possible that anybody believes that he's capable of being the head of all of these different projects that even the the most, you know, astute

39:38.960 --> 39:46.960
engineer and businessman or woman would have trouble running one of those companies, right? I mean, and would be fine with running one of those companies.

39:46.960 --> 39:54.960
So the idea that he's also got time to go on Joe Rogan and to go over to London and have an AI talk and all this other crap.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.960
I mean, it's just these, this is an illusion.

39:58.960 --> 40:10.960
It's the same illusion on a grander scale, but the same illusion is being cast by Robert Malone as he puts out between 20 and 30 pages of sub stack every day.

40:10.960 --> 40:16.960
And he's on podcast. He's been on sometimes nine or 10 podcasts a day during the pandemic. This is an illusion.

40:17.960 --> 40:26.960
Because you can't also be raising emus and birthing and birthing 11 Colts and all this other stuff.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.960
So some of this is really an illusion.

40:31.960 --> 40:41.960
It's made, it's meant to make the average person that, you know, just barely can get their kids on the bus on time and barely can get the lunches loaded in the morning and can barely get their stream done.

40:41.960 --> 40:52.960
These are the people that Elon Musk and these other fake entities make feel terrible.

40:52.960 --> 41:07.960
And I think that that gets you down. And this is, I think what I want to emphasize today with this watching party here to look at really what what we have here is somebody who's overextended on every front.

41:07.960 --> 41:19.960
And one of the ways that he's overextended is the idea that self driving is just a matter of time and please understand self driving is just a matter of time is the exact same argument.

41:20.960 --> 41:28.960
That they made when they said that, well, we solved chess. And now if we solve go, well, then we really got it.

41:28.960 --> 41:33.960
And it turns out that they really haven't solved go yet, but they, they're, they're closer.

41:33.960 --> 41:41.960
And the way that they do it, remember with chess or with go, it is many, many, many iterations of the game.

41:41.960 --> 41:48.960
With self driving, it's many, many, many iterations of driving.

41:48.960 --> 41:59.960
And so there wasn't already a, there's an algorithm there, but it's a machine learning algorithm that's sculpting itself to learn to interpret camera images.

41:59.960 --> 42:06.960
And it's being trained by real people that select the footage to train the cameras.

42:06.960 --> 42:12.960
And then that software is constantly updated in your car. Should you own one?

42:12.960 --> 42:17.960
And so let's watch first what happened. I think a couple years ago already now.

42:17.960 --> 42:22.960
And so you're, you're going to first argue that, okay, the self driving has gotten better.

42:22.960 --> 42:28.960
But remember, we're still talking about self driving a car with like seven cameras and a radar.

42:30.960 --> 42:41.960
And we're talking about a relative, you know, we're talking about highway driving, you know, we're not talking about a lot of, you know, residential area driving or anything like that that they're really representing it.

42:42.960 --> 42:48.960
And this is somewhere between, I mean, it might even be easier than chess in some ways, right? I mean, we're not.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
This is a.

42:50.960 --> 42:54.960
From a problem perspective, it's a second by second problem.

42:54.960 --> 42:58.960
It's a recognition problem. It's a vision problem. It shouldn't.

42:58.960 --> 43:03.960
From the perspective of these guys, it shouldn't be that hard, right? It doesn't seem like it should be that hard.

43:04.960 --> 43:11.960
So where is this? I guess I have one missing here. I got to get this other one. Sorry. I wanted to watch the.

43:11.960 --> 43:16.960
The, um, Neuralink. Yeah, that one.

43:16.960 --> 43:22.960
Okay. So first, let's start with him. Okay. And let's start where we are with Neuralink.

43:22.960 --> 43:27.960
Um, and listen to this presentation and just try to process him.

43:28.960 --> 43:33.960
Process him as a biologist, as an engineer, as a visionary.

43:33.960 --> 43:40.960
Welcome to the Neuralink show and tell. So we've got as a communicator, as somebody who.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.960
Who could lead a company of two or 3000 people.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.960
But could also lead a room of 12 people.

43:48.960 --> 43:56.960
And I want you to think very carefully about this should be the most relaxed. He is, right? This should be the easiest time here.

43:57.960 --> 44:01.960
Um, because he doesn't have to go into any technical details.

44:01.960 --> 44:08.960
So let's see an amazing amount of new developments to share with you.

44:08.960 --> 44:14.960
That I think are incredibly exciting as well as tell you about the future of what we're planning to do here. It's, uh,

44:14.960 --> 44:18.960
another says meant to be a technical podcast or sort of like a work.

44:18.960 --> 44:27.960
I mean, I'm going to provide an overall summary. Um, and then we're going to have a number of members of the Neuralink team come in and give a deep technical overview of the various areas.

44:27.960 --> 44:31.960
So, uh, yeah, so let me move forward with the, the overall summary.

44:31.960 --> 44:37.960
Now, some of the things I'm going to say are things you've, well, if you've been following your link, you've already heard before.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.960
That's, uh, for, for a lot of people out there, they've no idea what Neuralink does.

44:41.960 --> 44:46.960
And so I'll be a little bit repetitive of things you may already know.

44:46.960 --> 44:53.960
But now I want to just make sure I point this out once and for all. And maybe somebody like Kevin McCarron could correct me if I'm wrong.

44:53.960 --> 45:05.960
But, uh, as far as I know, um, you know, implanting something into a monkey's head for several years is not something that's done.

45:05.960 --> 45:15.960
We don't do that in neuroscience. And if it was doable, you could make the argument that that would be the most humane way to do neuroscience on a monkey's brain.

45:15.960 --> 45:25.960
Would be to make a permanent implant into their brain that you wouldn't have to mess with, that wouldn't, that wouldn't bleed, that wouldn't get infected.

45:25.960 --> 45:42.960
And so if we could have done that already and had, you know, a monkey recording for five years from a particular area of the brain or a whole swath of the brain with a, with a long electrode sampling array, we would have done that already.

45:43.960 --> 45:50.960
So what Elon Musk is proposing is to do a monkey experiment on people that's never been done on monkeys.

45:50.960 --> 45:59.960
And if he's doing it on monkeys, those monkeys just have to die. They have to just get one infection.

46:00.960 --> 46:13.960
So the whole concept of implanting something in a brain of a mammal and leaving it there is a wholly untested principle. It's not something that we would ever do with a child.

46:13.960 --> 46:18.960
Can you imagine make a permanent hole to the outside world?

46:18.960 --> 46:23.960
Maybe use chemical polymers to seal it up permanently. I don't care how you do it.

46:23.960 --> 46:32.960
Just the concept of a foreign body in your brain, in your head, in your body somewhere forever is already wrong.

46:32.960 --> 46:41.960
Even if it's a little tiny chip that just has your, your currency in it and your digital ID, it's very wrong.

46:41.960 --> 46:45.960
Because this is sacred.

46:46.960 --> 47:03.960
Tattoos are already something that, you know, back in the day when we did consider ourselves sacred, our children's sacred tattoos were like really, really going, going far, desecrating something that you definitely shouldn't desecrate.

47:03.960 --> 47:11.960
At one point piercing ears was something that you couldn't do until you were old enough.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.960
And that's where we are.

47:14.960 --> 47:24.960
The people don't see their little girls as precious enough to just wait to get their freaking ears pierced four times.

47:24.960 --> 47:32.960
And so the idea, again, remember, is to implant something in somebody's brain and leave it there and make it useful.

47:32.960 --> 47:40.960
A brain mind interface on the, on the ground level has been done in monkeys. It's been done in mice. It works.

47:40.960 --> 47:51.960
What hasn't been done. What doesn't work is implanting it there and leaving it there indefinitely and having it to be, you know, ever used.

47:51.960 --> 48:00.960
That's never been done. That hasn't been done in any animal. It's not, it's not likely to be done.

48:00.960 --> 48:10.960
And so what I'm suggesting to you is, is just the, the, the principle, the claim alone, if it was possible, we would have already done it in mice and monkeys by now.

48:10.960 --> 48:20.960
Permanent implants, years of observation, you know, days and days and days of recording at the same time doing the same behaviors, free roaming all the time.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.960
I mean, all of these things we would have done by now.

48:23.960 --> 48:26.960
And it's not to say we're not trying to do them.

48:26.960 --> 48:33.960
It's saying that after we do them, the animal is sacrificed so that we can get the anatomical trace from where we recording.

48:33.960 --> 48:37.960
Even if it's a long recording, it's not the life of the animal.

48:37.960 --> 48:46.960
It's not even a meaningful period in the animal's life. It can't be by definition.

48:46.960 --> 48:54.960
And so this is charlatanism, but let's, let's just let it run for a little bit before I get into the, the driving part.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.960
That others do not.

48:56.960 --> 49:07.960
So the overall, the overarching goal of Neuralink is to create a, ultimately a whole brain interface.

49:07.960 --> 49:13.960
So a generalized input output device that.

49:13.960 --> 49:23.960
Now what I want you to understand, and I want you to understand it very, very clearly because it's really important now, is that what they plan to do is not monitor the brain

49:23.960 --> 49:27.960
in a meaningful way that understands the signal that they have.

49:27.960 --> 49:33.960
What they plan to do is very much akin to like wrapping electrodes around your wrist.

49:33.960 --> 49:38.960
And then comparing across those electrodes as you move your fingers.

49:38.960 --> 49:47.960
If they did that, then they would get, if they had like five electrodes here, they would get different readings on every one of those five electrodes as you moved your hands around.

49:47.960 --> 50:00.960
And they would be able to reasonably well read where your hands were, what position they were in as they measured these signals and then over time collected the data and correlated it with a machine learning program.

50:00.960 --> 50:15.960
Machine learning program could predict the voltage across all of those five electrodes as your hand position moved and probably over time they could get a reasonably good read on what your hand position is given what the voltage was over the last.

50:15.960 --> 50:21.960
300 milliseconds before the position is inquired.

50:21.960 --> 50:25.960
Does that mean that they understand how the hand and the wrist works together?

50:25.960 --> 50:34.960
Does that mean that they understand how the motor cortex is coordinating with the cerebellum in order to produce those complex motor behaviors? Absolutely not.

50:34.960 --> 50:47.960
But it does mean that they have used machine learning and a proxy measurement to make a reasonable model to predict where these digits will be given these voltages.

50:47.960 --> 50:59.960
Now, not any different than that putting five electrodes or 50 electrodes in your head and monitoring the signals on those electrodes.

50:59.960 --> 51:10.960
And then also at the same time monitoring the intention of the animal, what the animal is trying to do, for example, for example, let's say move this mouse, you can see this mouse.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.960
Now I'm doing it with my hand.

51:13.960 --> 51:23.960
But if they record the data in my motor cortex as I do this, they're going to get a signal, not unlike this signal that I described here, but now from the brain.

51:23.960 --> 51:35.960
And so they don't need to know what those signals mean. They just need to know what my hand is doing on the desk. They need to know where the mouse is in the screen.

51:35.960 --> 51:43.960
And now the machine learning program can correlate where I'm moving the mouse what direction I'm moving the mouse with the signal here.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.960
And it doesn't matter what the signal is.

51:46.960 --> 52:05.960
This signal could be from the parietal cortex. It could be three layers of functionality and and conceptualization of the movement. It could be many layers past the primary motor cortex and still there would be a discernible signal that a machine learning program could use this data that

52:05.960 --> 52:12.960
it sees on the screen for where and what direction the mouse is moving in to make a model of what you want.

52:12.960 --> 52:29.960
And over time with practice and training, eventually you could just lift up your hand and move the mouse and it would it would essentially that signal that ghost signal would still be present there.

52:29.960 --> 52:41.960
And that might be very hard to understand, but it will be easier to understand if you knew that monkeys are often strapped down in their cage and can only move one digit or one arm, but not the rest of it.

52:41.960 --> 52:57.960
And so the signal that you get in the cortex is very, very clear. It's not a monkey that's, you know, fidgeting and grooming its neighbor and whatever else is an animal that's strapped into a cage or strapped into a chair with its head fixed like this.

52:57.960 --> 53:10.960
And so the only real motion signals that are in the brain that are leaking around in the brain are eye movement signals, emotionality and whatever motor movements they're allowed to do.

53:10.960 --> 53:21.960
And so this high signal to noise allows any electrode array basically to pick up a signal that will be unique depending on where that arm is in space.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.960
And it will be unique depending on where that animal is looking in space.

53:24.960 --> 53:39.960
And so with a few months of training, they can build a brain mind interface that's based on this machine learning program and the random signals that are recorded in this, this animal's brain or in the animal's musculature.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.960
And that's the foundation of a brain mind interface.

53:43.960 --> 54:00.960
If you're using your phone all the time during that interfacing and getting that signal and then you stop scrolling with your finger, but you think about it, that signal will still be present in many of these places where your brain, when your brain imagines something that's part of what happens.

54:00.960 --> 54:04.960
That's the beauty of neuroscience. We already know that.

54:04.960 --> 54:12.960
If you imagine shooting a free throw, there are not just active neurons in your visual cortex that are attempting to create that image.

54:12.960 --> 54:28.960
There are also motor neurons that are that are being activated as memories of your, you know, your dribbling rhythm and how many times you spin the ball backwards before you shoot and your knees bending and all this stuff.

54:28.960 --> 54:43.960
The snake oil here is the create a generalized input output platform for the brain. We've already got that we can do a brain mind interface with the dumbest of animals. If I, if I say that so boldly not all I don't think animals are dumb necessarily but less sophisticated animals.

54:43.960 --> 54:52.960
We can already do this with them and now you might say, well, that's because they've got a smaller, easier brain to understand. No, not necessarily.

54:52.960 --> 55:00.960
Most of the signals inside of our brain are probably repetitive representations of the same thing so that it can be processed in parallel.

55:00.960 --> 55:09.960
And that's why a lot of times there are signals that are recorded in other parts of the brain that it seemed like, wait, I thought this part of the brain did this and not that.

55:09.960 --> 55:14.960
But I keep seeing correlative signals with this behavior, even though it's supposed to be in a different place.

55:14.960 --> 55:29.960
That's been confounding neuroscientists for decades because again, the whole idea that the brain works in compartments with different pieces, you know, is really like a thinking like a computer when it's really probably more like a vibrational symphony of sorts.

55:29.960 --> 55:36.960
A ionic, cationic electrical symphony.

55:36.960 --> 55:49.960
And so the idea that you can, you know, again stick a electrodes or a set of electrodes in the brain and read a useful signal that over time you can start to in a limited repertoire of behaviors.

55:49.960 --> 55:57.960
For example, controlling your phone is a limited repertoire of behaviors. How many things do you need to be able to do?

55:57.960 --> 56:04.960
So how many signals does this little device need to be able to recognize as you intending to open your phone?

56:04.960 --> 56:10.960
You intending to open messages, you intending to type a message and then thinking that message that it goes in there.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.960
That's not that it's not mind reading.

56:14.960 --> 56:24.960
In the end, it might be you have to think about hearing the words out loud and then the AI interface machine learning can figure that out.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.960
But we're a long ways from that.

56:26.960 --> 56:39.960
We're a long ways from reading people's minds to words, but reading people's mind to intention or direction or anything to do with movement is possible because movement is such a huge thing.

56:39.960 --> 56:45.960
It has such a huge representation. It's behavior.

56:45.960 --> 56:56.960
But the moment that you're going to try and read somebody's imagination or read their subtle thoughts or what they're thinking behind them, this is this is in possibility space.

56:56.960 --> 57:06.960
But the implication is that, and really what he's only going to do is replace a mouse with something in your head, replace an optical mouse with something in your head.

57:06.960 --> 57:09.960
That's the that's what he's talking about right now.

57:09.960 --> 57:14.960
You know, in the long term, literally could interface with every aspect of your brain.

57:14.960 --> 57:32.960
And in the short term interface with every aspect of your brain is the dumbest thing that he's going to say in this whole presentation because I can't imagine it's possible, but I can't imagine a dumber thing that somebody could say when talking about the brain and interfacing with it.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.960
Let's listen to that again because that's really a home run.

57:35.960 --> 57:43.960
What output device that, you know, in the long term, literally could interface with every aspect of your brain.

57:43.960 --> 57:55.960
And in the short term, what does that even mean? There can't be a neurobiologist on the planet. It takes him seriously anymore if he says that. What, what kind of implant is this?

57:55.960 --> 58:13.960
It's just, it's just ridiculous. Okay. So I don't know how much more that we can interface with any given section of your brain and solve a tremendous number of things that cause debilitating issues for people.

58:13.960 --> 58:26.960
So, you know, so our long term is like, I'll talk a little bit about a long term goal. It's going to sound a little esoteric, but does this sound like a genius to you?

58:26.960 --> 58:31.960
Does this sound like a guy with a vision for the future?

58:31.960 --> 58:41.960
Or does this sound like a guy who's trying to remember what was the, what was the sales pitch again? What am I supposed to sell them on that I'm going to fix what again?

58:42.960 --> 58:47.960
Am I going to restore vision or I'm going to fix the spinal cord? What's he going to do?

58:47.960 --> 59:01.960
It's the, it was actually the sort of my prime motivation, which was, you know, what do we do about AI? Like, what do we do about artificial general intelligence?

59:02.960 --> 59:17.960
If we have digital super intelligence, that's, you know, just much smarter than any human. How do we mitigate that risk at a species level? How do we mitigate that risk?

59:17.960 --> 59:24.960
So at a species level, he wants to mitigate the risk of AI by connecting us to computers now through our brain with a physical interface.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.960
Because then what the AIs won't kill us.

59:29.960 --> 59:36.960
I mean, this, he, he's not even articulate enough to tell this science fiction story with any vigor.

59:37.960 --> 59:53.960
I'm not even really excited by it because of the awkwardness with which he, he expounds on this idea. It is, it is laughable that we are being presented with this guy as an intellectual leader as some kind of.

59:54.960 --> 01:00:05.960
It's just, it's really, it is, it is frightening. It is really frightening. I mean, this is an inversion of everything that's true.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:20.960
If we have digital super intelligence, that's, they're just much smarter than any human. How do we mitigate that risk at a species level? How do we mitigate that risk?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:36.960
And then even in a benign scenario where the AI is very, very benevolent, then how do we even go along for the, go along for the ride? How do we participate?

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:46.960
And the conclusion, okay, so we're going to leave it right here. I'm not going to torture you with that anymore. I didn't realize it was so bad.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:55.960
They're going to say that they need to get a quadriplegic and they're actually going to show a monkey playing pong with its brain, which is, again, remember pong with its brain is what?

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.960
What is it, ladies and gentlemen? It's moving something from one part of the screen to the other part of the screen.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:14.960
So the only thing they need to do was train the learning, the machine learning to read either the, the, the signals in the motor cortex that correspond to up or down or middle and there's only a few.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:23.960
How many positions are there, a hundred? And, and is it locked into where the, the monkey is looking?

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:33.960
And so we really have two main signals that they're trying to get from the cortex. Not very hard.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:41.960
It's really not very hard at all. I mean, I guess we can see if we can watch that part. Let's see if we can watch the monkey part.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:57.960
He makes a Rick and Morty reference, which I don't like because Rick is, Rick is not my, here we go, monkey playing pong.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:11.960
Pager, who is playing a monkey mind pong. So this is a, Pager has a neural link implant in this video.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.960
And the thing that's interesting is that you, you can't, you can't even see the, the neural implant.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:27.960
So it's the, it's, we've miniaturized the neural implant to the point where it matches the, the thickness of.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.960
So I assume that he's licking sugar water here to keep participating.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.960
I guess that's the neural link there. Maybe that's his other ear, but he's bragging about the fact that you can't see it.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960
But again, remember what I'm saying to you.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:51.960
A very small number of electrodes put almost anywhere in the neocortex in a monkey like this could get a discernible signal during the playing of pong.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.960
And could be used to train the positioning of that thing, which doesn't have infinite position, right?

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.960
It's not even moving in, in 2D space. It's moving in 1D space.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.960
And so the monkey is able to interact with this game in 1D space. That's it.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
This is not even replacing a mouse yet.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.960
Do you see my point?

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:25.960
So this is very much snake oil and this is not even the best brain mind interface that has been seen in neuroscience already in terms of what the animals can and can't do.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.960
So this is actually also part of the frustration.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.960
And I'm sure a lot of people that work on monkeys would think that this was just absurd what he's doing here, what he's claiming here.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960
And that's what drives me nuts.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:57.960
The skull that is removed. So it's essentially that it's sort of like having an Apple watch or a Fitbit, replacing a piece of skull with a smartwatch for lack of a better analogy.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:05.960
How is that even possible for somebody to argue that that's a good idea that we're going to replace a piece of your skull with a smartwatch?

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:07.960
How?

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.960
Look at him. Listen to him.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.960
This is just meant to keep us on our heels. It's just meant to bamboozle our children.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.960
And we need to be active in saving them from this illusion.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.960
So you can see he really can't. He looks pretty as normal.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.960
And I think that's pretty important if you have a neural link device.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.960
I could have a neural link device implanted right now.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
Here you go.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.960
Oh, here we go. What is he saying? I could have a neural link of device implanted right now and...

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.960
You wouldn't even know. I mean...

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960
Hypothetically...

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960
I may be one of these demos. In fact...

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960
One of these demos I will.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.960
One of these demos I will.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.960
One of these demos I will. Okay, we're going to end it right there because that's just dumb.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.960
So that was this one. So let's watch the...

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.960
Remember now we're not even talking about interfacing with the brain now.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.960
Now we're just talking about using a computer...

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:26.960
Using a computer to make a car drive safely. Watch this video.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960
February 27th, 2021.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Police body cam footage shows a traffic stop on a highway in Montgomery County, Texas.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:43.960
As this 2019 Tesla Model X driving in autopilot mode strikes their vehicles at 54 miles per hour.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.960
Enduring five officers and hospitalizing the subject of the original traffic stop.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:06:07.960
The crash is one of 16 between Teslas and emergency vehicles being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or NHTSA to determine whether Tesla's autopilot has contributed to the accidents.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.960
The journal obtained exclusive dash cam footage and partial data logs from the Tesla and the Texas crash.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960
We annotated the footage for clarity.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:23.960
These materials show the car's autopilot system failed to recognize the stopped emergency vehicles in time.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:32.960
And though its driver monitoring system appears to have worked as designed, it was not enough to sideline the impaired driver and prevent the collision.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.960
We also obtained eight crash reports included in the NHTSA investigation.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.960
In at least six, the incidents occurred when emergency vehicle lights were flashing.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:50.960
Now, this is something that I wanted to make sure that we don't get too far into because in this one, they're going to say that the emergency lights are the one, the thing that did it.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960
But I want you to understand that it's a little more complicated than that.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.960
Let's just, let's just watch some other analysis.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:11.960
Braking and sudden acceleration and steering wheel jerks and things like that make me realize that the big difference between a stage two Tesla and a stage two Nissan or Hyundai or Kia is just confidence.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.960
It's not an iconic or an 86 hits a sharp curve or situation that it's uncertain of.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960
It leads the decision up to the driver.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.960
Now, when a Tesla encounters uncertainty, it will confidently, I'll show you an example.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:31.960
As most men in their 40s do, I bought a plastic child and then tried to hit it with autonomous vehicles on a closed roadway.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
And guess what?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.960
Despite what you may have seen in videos like this, the Tesla actually did rather well at avoiding the child when it was barreling down the road.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.960
And I decided that this experiment was a success and cruise control over to the profit camera stuff.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:53.960
With cruise control still on, the car braked for the child, stood stationary for a bit and then suddenly accelerated over the child and sped up until I manually braked and took over.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.960
Oh my God, it just mowed down the child.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.960
Yeah, what the fuck?

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.960
I lifted my orange plastic boy back up to his feet and I tried approaching him at a moderate pace.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.960
The car recognized the child and the road, braked a bit and then decided, Meh, it's fine and then drove over it.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.960
Here's a really, really painfully obvious question.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.960
When a car detects a humanoid object and says, hey, there's a humanoid object, I'm going to break for that.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960
And then the car breaks for it.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.960
Why in the world would it not suspend full self driving and have the human take over?

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.960
Like a car should not ever accelerate from a stop if it thinks that it just detected a pedestrian in front of it.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
What the fuck?

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.960
And it's not like this is some type of anomaly.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.960
A few days before that, I decided to actually test out full self driving in public.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.960
It tried to drive me into the side of another car in a Kroger parking lot.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.960
I decided to stop testing it in public and brought it to a closed lot.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.960
And even in that closed lot, I probably had to disengage to prevent a collision over a dozen times.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.960
And when I was filming in public the entire time, I thought to myself, this is actually really dangerous.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.960
Why am I filming myself driving this thing in public?

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960
I'm going to get canceled.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:14.960
But like close to 400,000 people are using this exact shitty system or an even older and shittier version of it on public roadways.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:25.960
And a whole lot of people from Elon dick riders to Tesla investors are really defensive and full of shit when any sort of claim about full self driving safety comes up.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:39.960
In fact, last year when the independent published footage of a Tesla hitting a child mannequin in a controlled test, not only did Tesla threaten them, but Hallmark's catalog argued that full self driving cars can detect the difference between false pedestrians and true pedestrians.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.960
And then literally asked for somebody in the Bay Area to volunteer to have their child run in front of his Tesla to prove it.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:10:04.960
And sure enough, just when you think that you can't possibly hear anything stupider than the paragraph that just came out of my fucking mouth in a now removed YouTube video, Tad Park, a private equity CEO, heavily invested in Tesla, decided to volunteer his child to play Russian roulette with full self driving beta.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960
So far so good.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960
But what about with real life kids?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960
The car refuses to move.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960
Okay, it's moving a little bit.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
Moving a little bit.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.960
Let's send it to 40 miles an hour, just like Dan O'Dowd's test.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:23.960
And thank God it didn't do to his child what it's done to mannequin children in tests.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:30.960
Okay, honey, daddy is balls deep on an option ETF for one of Elon's broken promises that daddy's also hedged with Bitcoin.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:38.960
I'm going to need you to go help daddy out and go stand in front of the 4,000 pound self driving vehicle that's being beta tested.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:44.960
There's been tons of both formal, well funded research and independent research from concerned Tesla owners.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:59.960
AI addict, for example, has set up all sorts of test scenarios on private roads, including but not limited to fooling Tesla's driver monitoring system with stuffed animals and even an inflatable bottle of champagne while plowing through a closed road sign and also plowing through a moving

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960
pellet.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:11.960
I'm a mannequin walking its dog, and just like in my experiences, a lot of the time the test level of detective pedestrian break and then be like, nah, it's probably fine and go on to commit vehicular homicide in a hit and run.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.960
The reason some of the old autopilot running over children tests are safer than others isn't that complicated.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960
Okay, so maybe I'm going to let this run.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:26.960
Fully autonomous vehicles or vehicles that claim to be fully autonomous use LiDAR sensors, which is like a pretty foolproof real time 3D scanner.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:33.320
real-time 3D scanner. Elon Musk thinks that LiDAR sensors are far too expensive so

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.760
he is relied on just using regular cameras and ultrasonic sensors. Ultrasonic

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.520
sensors are a tried true reliable way to detect nearby objects. They're used in

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.200
everything from collision warning systems to parking assist systems to rear

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.280
occupant alert systems. Come to think of it the last time I had a car that didn't

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.660
have any type of ultrasonic sensor on it was like 20 years ago. They cost like

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.940
$50 to replace for the consumer and they cost as low as four dollars to make for

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:05.620
the manufacturer. This expense was apparently too much to ask for a 40 to

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:11.860
$50,000 vehicle because last year despite the overwhelming advice to not do

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:16.900
this from Tesla engineers Elon removed the ultrasonic sensors from all Tesla

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:21.260
models coming after. Okay so I'm just gonna stop this one because this isn't

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:25.660
really the video I wanted to watch to finish the to finish them off so I

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:30.300
wanted to recommend a YouTube channel to you if you are not already aware of it.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:37.380
As a motorcycle rider this Canadian guy by the name of Fort 9 is probably the

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:43.380
best YouTuber out there. He's got a partner I'm not getting anything for this

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.580
I really just like this guy's work he does a lot of funny videos about

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.780
motorcycles so if you don't like motorcycles you're not interested in

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.140
motorcycles and you don't want to watch these videos but they're really well

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:59.340
made his production value is very high for you know being a couple guys in

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:05.220
Canada and so like there's this you know do you here basically have to employ

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.380
RSV a low-blown he does a video like this and really on the

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:16.100
botanium so if you get a chance to own a V4 do it singles are for saving money

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.860
and riding dirt V twins add power if you don't mind adding length in line

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:24.940
twins kind of low belong and sound like a sewing machine unless it's one of the

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:30.620
new 270 degree jobs boxers are dumb inline triples are inherently unbalanced

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.380
you'll see these marketed as raw engines but I sold you a raw hamburger would

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:41.100
that be desirable inline fours are the first true screamers constant power being

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.380
a better way to rev fast though you'll need a balancer shaft and inline sixes

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.820
are theoretical perfection but realistically impractical we've been

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.820
and so he does a lot of videos like this and they're really entertaining and he

01:13:53.820 --> 01:14:00.940
did a video not too long ago about Teslas and running over motorcycles and so in

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:05.620
order to feature fort nine and his production crew I'm gonna use this

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:11.020
video to make the point I want to make about self-driving and I think he does

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.500
a really good job of introducing it from the perspective of you know what it's

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.460
representing versus what it really means and so enjoy this I hope you enjoy it I

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.700
really do like this a lot

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:47.540
two almost robotically identical crashes are under investigation because

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:52.820
artificial intelligence is the suspected link

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:08.060
can you spot the fatal flaw in Tesla's autopilot

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:28.340
eight cameras enable this car to see both crashes occurred on straight highway

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:34.740
so we'll consider the narrow forward-facing camera and it's 250 meter range if the

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:40.500
bike was going 65 and the Tesla 80 that equates to 37 seconds of reaction time

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.660
maybe our closing speed was faster but regardless the computer had enough

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:53.540
processing time by an order of magnitude meaning autopilot decided this is not a

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:59.780
problem this is not a problem this is not a problem this is not a problem until

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:05.980
see our brains can tell a motorcycle from a car from a stop sign these human

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:10.660
farms data sets are fed to computer vision programs until they too learned

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.660
to label videos and Tesla vision is nothing more than more in Tesla has

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:20.820
billions of dash cam minutes they sample millions of sketchy moments which

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:26.100
humans label and teach to AI and that runs in shadow mode on your next drive

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:31.420
making a few more questionable decisions which are corrected and relearned again

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:37.980
and again through seven modes of refinement but it's still just labeling and I

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:45.020
can't stress enough to you right now how the only plan they have to solve the

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:52.100
human genome is collecting lots of iterations of it and labeling labeling

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:58.180
it with medical data labeling it with time series of medical data as many data

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:02.820
points as they can find with the hopes that there will be enough data for the

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:11.500
AI to convert data into some understanding data into some mastery of

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:19.660
the system the exact same thing that Fortnite just described they are doing

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:26.260
with billions of hours of driving and it's still failing miserably you saw the

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:33.220
last video it's failing miserably it's not that problem all however tractable

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:42.620
it may be is just a tiny speck of a droplet of vapor in a five gallon bucket

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:47.460
of water that represents the complexity of the human immune system the human

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:53.460
digestive system the human nervous system and they expect you to believe

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:59.420
that they can augment it that they can make predictions about how when they

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:05.100
augment it what will happen years in the future they can't even do it seconds in

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:17.180
the future and so it's with great great urgency that I beg you to start

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:24.060
teaching your children about this mythology about this enchantment that

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:28.700
AI and machine learning if it just had a few more cores or it just had a few more

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.220
gigabytes of data or a few more hours of driving a few more examples of a

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:38.940
collision that the AI would finally have all the answers that it needs to drive

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:43.620
us safely down the road and and do whatever else you know like augment the

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:54.540
genome this is the same snake oil but it's easier to see here with driving and

01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:00.540
self-driving algorithms than it is to see with the human genome and with medicine

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:07.380
and with personalized medicine and with personalized therapies and with

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:14.220
personalized transfections this this is the same kind of snake oil but the

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:19.540
snake oil that's happening in the in the public health space his orders of

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:28.820
magnitude more dangerous this is a motorcycle up close this is a car far

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:33.900
away this is a problem this is not now remember our crashes happened at night

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:39.380
so AI can't see his body and they were on empty highways so we have few linear

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:45.940
perspective cues and both motorcycles were cruisers with low tail lights my

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:50.220
theory is that all the computer saw was two glaring orbs close together and

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:56.860
close to the horizon it labeled this a distant car so it hit our imminent

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.660
motorcycle

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:08.860
of course a human might make the same mistake and statistically AI is still

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:16.260
said to be safer but that is a dangerous misrepresentation Elon's referring to

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:21.140
autopilot crashes per million miles driven but think about it autopilot is

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:26.700
massively biased to highway use and on highways cars usually travel a long

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:32.220
distance before smacking into things formulas exist for adjusting the highway

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:37.140
advantage and when you interpret the data responsibly autopilot is sometimes more

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.060
dangerous than driving without a catastrophic distinction for a

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:47.140
feature that is only meant to augment driver safety but it's all the same in

01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.780
a sales spreadsheet never mind the salvation of mankind maybe the world's

01:20:51.780 --> 01:21:01.940
richest car company is out to make money oh I like money case in point Tesla

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.660
recently removed the radar that lived in here so its computer can guess at

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:11.140
distances based on parallax and what it thinks an object is but the chilling

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:17.180
truth is that your Tesla no longer knows the distance to anything not without

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:23.500
radar sending radio waves there and back again it's a cost-saving deletion both

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:29.620
in parts and reputation see radar is all distance and no substance it knows how

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:34.580
far that mass is but can't tell whether it's an overpass or an overturned truck

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:42.860
so the AI either has to ignore radar input or trust radar only to occasionally

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:47.660
panic break for no reason it's an embarrassing problem and when we

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.260
understand autopilot as a profit proposition we can understand why Tesla

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:57.380
buried that problem in the cheapest way possible so actually three weeks ago we

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:02.060
started to ship cars that have no radar at all so we deleted the radar and we

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:06.380
are driving on vision alone in these cars and the reason we are doing this I

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:10.380
think is well expressed by Elon in a suite he's saying when radar on vision

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.900
disagree which one do you believe vision has much more precision so better to

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:19.500
double down vision than do sensor fusion that is a reckless idea imagine I

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.940
hire two artists to paint what do you think your brain does other than sensor

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:30.180
fusion better to double down on vision than to work on sensor fusion so the one

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:35.900
thing that that biology does well to produce behavior from sensory input is

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:43.500
sensory fusion sensory integration is the right term and so rather than tackle

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.220
the challenge of sensory integration he's just decided to go on vision alone

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:53.180
think about how spectacularly silly this is from the perspective of him

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:58.620
standing up there pretending that they're doing all this magic stuff they're not

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:04.220
doing anything they're cutting corners they're making money they're making sales

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:09.020
pitches they're making claims that they can't back up it is very very close to

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:17.580
thoranos level deception sure it can help you on the highway whoopty ding

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:21.180
Chevy trucks can do that too

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.260
Chevy trucks don't explode into spontaneous fires that can't be put out

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:32.060
without special chemicals that I know for sure my traverse is never going to blow

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:39.100
up like that into picture of the road ahead and uh oh and they're different

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:42.460
and I guess I better throw one away so there's nothing left to contradict the

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.020
other and that means I can drive assuming it's correct

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:54.140
hmm the only place that logic makes sense is in a profit loss call if Tesla really

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:58.380
cared to solve the discrepancies between radar and vision I expect they'd check

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.340
with LiDAR it's like a million tiny radars

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:06.780
doving a pointless map of accurate distances with definition such is the

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:14.140
reason every autonomous giant failsaves with LiDAR except Tesla LiDAR is is a

01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:19.820
fool's errand and anyone relying on LiDAR is doomed

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:26.700
doomed that statement only makes sense when I translate into dollars

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:32.380
LiDAR is expensive it's ugly it requires pre-made maps that are

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.500
unscalable to market of course money is not the party line

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:42.460
and Tesla would say that we drive with two eyes and our intelligence so eight

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.500
cameras and an artificial intelligence is all you need for autonomous driving

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:54.060
in theory in the future I agree but Tesla is making billion selling

01:24:54.060 --> 01:25:00.060
future features to consumers today and today two motorcyclists are dead

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:10.140
nobody wants to see a third and Tesla least of all so let's suggest three

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:16.540
fixes to our three parties starting with Tesla don't call it autopilot

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.460
Germany has banned the term as false advertising California is trying to

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:24.060
oust it as dangerously misleading we all know

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.940
selling an autopilot that requires drivers to be constantly piloting it

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:32.380
it's like selling a flamethrower that is not a flamethrower

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:38.940
it's willfully incendiary now to Tesla consumers be skeptical

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:43.820
any influencer can recognize that Elon Musk is an influencer his genius is

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:47.900
insane the most compelling things not the most true

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:51.260
so before you trust his take on autonomy just know that autopilot is programmed

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:55.740
to shut down one second before impact so who's the man's letter charge gonna

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.740
stick to

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:15.100
and finally to motorcyclists yours is the deadly serious

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:21.820
responsibility it's also the most vague maybe when headlights loom behind

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:26.620
we've side to side your lateral motion will be wider than a far away car it

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:29.900
should help the AI to gauge your distance

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:35.420
it's something but i wish i had more

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.580
i really like that guy he makes me so excited he makes youtube videos like i

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.980
would make if i could spend that much time editing a video

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.500
he's fabulous and the point that i'm trying to make i hope is very very

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:53.740
clear the idea is that these people who are

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:57.820
selling us on this concept that with enough replications enough

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:03.100
enough recordings enough interactions with motorcycles enough

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:07.660
you know labeled videos eventually this machine learning algorithm would come

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:12.060
up with a solution that that worked

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:18.460
and this as fort nine so eloquently says is is selling a future

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:23.340
feature that doesn't exist now calling it autopilot is deceptive calling

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.700
these transfections vaccines was deceptive telling Robert Malone when he

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:32.140
was really young and just cutting his teeth as a postdoc

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:35.980
that everybody would be carrying genetic diseases with retroviruses in 10 years

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:40.380
was deceptive and telling everybody in these

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.260
meetings behind the scenes that if we just collect enough

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:48.700
genomes and we just collect enough of examples of human

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:56.220
biology and feed it accurately into the ai that the ai will crack the puzzle

01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:01.500
this is an illusion of the grandest order

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:06.780
and it can be seen very clearly if you look at smaller examples of the same

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:11.500
power being applied to other simpler problems like chess

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.740
go

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.420
and autopilot are self-driving

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.300
you can see very quickly how how in the world are you going to describe

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:26.540
the symphony that is this complex pattern integrity that we

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.460
start out as babies and progress until we're 75 years old

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.660
changing the entire time metabolically spiritually electrically

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:42.060
ionically microbiologically and yet somehow we're smart enough to

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.940
understand that infinite complexity to

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:49.180
inject a combination of substances intramuscular in attempt to augment it

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:53.980
over time think about that

01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:58.860
and in the meantime we're going to do our best until the ai tells us the way we

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.820
should have done it all along that's where we are

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:05.340
and our children need to know

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.820
our children need to know what they're doing why they're doing it that's what

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:14.860
that's that's it they need to know this they need to understand this

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:18.300
they need to understand that this was created by making us solve this

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.980
mystery and we accepted everything that went along with it including this

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:25.980
high fidelity transmission of RNA over many many years

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.180
we've been fooled into accepting that there's a novel virus that's

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:33.020
that is responsible for excess deaths and we've been fooled

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.300
by some people wittingly and unwittingly participating in the

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:40.700
extension of this worst case scenario narrative

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:43.340
one of the new players on the scene for me is

01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:47.420
the amazing poly she seems to be really contributing to kind of

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:50.460
pounding on this and making sure that these people that have

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.660
pushed out the worst case scenario from the beginning are being exposed i'm

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.900
really optimistic about poly but i do think that poly is also

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:03.500
tied up with Epstein and with uh QAnon and so there's always this thing where

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:09.340
you know if you and that's why we should remain parallel but separate

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:12.060
because if you start collaborating with somebody and they say oh yeah you

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.740
collaborated with that person named George Webb he was a big

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.980
QAnon guy so if you're related to George Webb then i'm not going to listen to

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:23.580
you anymore and that's how this often works

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.940
that's how they did it with brian artists i believe they got him to say a silly

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.260
thing and that maybe even what's happening with

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:33.260
judy mikovitz but judy mikovitz is a more complicated

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:36.300
situation because she's been more recently

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:41.020
sort of entangled with these guys who are entangled with George Webb

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:45.660
from the very beginning of the pandemic and even before that

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.740
and so if i want to be very specific about it i mean i'll be very specific

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.580
about it um sorry about that

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:58.300
hit that uh a little fast there listen carefully

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.260
bark right now where i believe you live maybe

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.100
massachusetts you don't have to tell us

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:08.060
i went to a protest uh this is in 2020 city hall

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:13.740
just a little over a week or two ago and uh the park was shut down

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:18.300
you can see there was no violence going on but the police basically informed me

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.300
a uh a plane closed officer informed me that the park was closed

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:25.580
he showed me no badge even when i asked to see it

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:28.620
and he said that despite the fact that i was standing there

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:33.660
talking to a 70 year old woman calmly and having a polite conversation no one

01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.540
was even arguing they closed the park they kicked us out

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.380
they told me that if i didn't leave i could take it up with a judge

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:44.460
which i took to mean they would arrest me throw me in a concrete box

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.140
and allow me to speak to a judge about the constitution on monday since this

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:52.940
was a friday is governor Andrew Cuomo allowed to shut down the

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.740
constitution because of allegations of a virus

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.020
that certain medical professionals argue against

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.700
let's be very clear how we break down this issue

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:07.180
the city of new york the state of new york has the power to close the park

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:11.580
based on their view that it would be helpful in defeating the pandemic

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:15.500
absolutely no question about that the supreme court has case in case

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:18.940
the case saying that public health justifies

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:23.580
closing down parks closing down no the reason why i'm showing this is you

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.500
should ask yourself why is this particular guy on this particular

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:31.500
podcast at this particular time

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.180
because this i believe is a harvard professor law school dude who talks

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.820
all the time on the news and now he's on

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:42.140
on this relatively unknown podcast with this fellow who used to be

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:47.740
very much recently in this video associated with george web good or bad

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.580
george web the guy who is on earlier this year

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:56.300
february of 2020 on 60 minutes talking about america releasing the virus at

01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:01.180
the wuhan games they're all intertwined

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:05.980
and at the beginning of the pandemic this lawyer decided to legitimize his

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:10.380
podcast by coming on and delivering this very

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:14.860
disingenuous message and representation about state rights constitutional rights

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:18.300
and the ability of the state to force vaccinate people

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:23.820
why on his podcast why not on cnn why on his podcast why is this guy

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:27.020
related to george web being promoted in 2020

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:31.420
and why is he still around now interacting with some of the same people that

01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.300
i've called medlers for years that's the trick

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:37.420
listen carefully next question is does the governor have

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:41.580
the right to do that governors generally are not

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:45.660
authorized to make the law uh they're authorized to enforce the law

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.660
so you'd have to look to see if there were legislative authority

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:53.020
allowing the governor to close the part if there is

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.340
then it would be legitimate uh let me put it very clearly you have no

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.540
constitutional right to endanger the public and spread

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:07.260
the disease even if you disagree you have no right not to be vaccinated

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.500
you have no right not to wear a mask you have no right to open up your

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:15.340
business where can i stop you naked so he's saying that there's no right

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:19.020
codified in the constitution that permits you to do that that that's a

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:23.260
that's a very disingenuous presentation of the legal argument that

01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.660
they're purporting to talk about this is a limited spectrum of debate

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:31.580
from limited angles with limited words on purpose

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:35.500
to seed a narrative of the worst case scenario not only

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.060
they're not talking about a lab leak here we're talking about the worst case

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:42.860
scenario what can the government do if it deems necessary to close down

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:47.740
and that's what they're doing here this is a worst case scenario discussion

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.860
worst case scenario the government can do whatever the hell it wants to so you

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.420
better get ready for it that's the message here

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:58.060
in 2020 being delivered by this lawyer

01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:03.660
and this relatively unknown podcaster who's associated

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:09.180
on video riding in the same car as George Webb before the pandemic

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:14.620
and so i don't know when this was i think it was about a half a year ago or so

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:19.820
biology we knew despite the envelope the surface unit alone

01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:25.420
of these viruses was the deadly component so they cloned the deadly parts

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:33.660
of the 1918 Spanish flu the 1918 pandemic strain of influenza

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:38.140
this was never about SARS-CoV-2 hear me this was about and this is John

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:43.340
Cullen's work as he talked to me in september of 2021 on Jason Goodman

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:47.740
show um september 20 so here's here's here's

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:53.900
here's uh judy mikovitz promoting again somebody who's related to George

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.740
Webb someone who claims that this was flu getting covered up

01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:01.740
and that there's no coronavirus it was flu and it was 1918 flu and now he's

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.060
changed it to h7n1 bird flu

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:11.180
but here she is promoting him as having the right idea which was at the time

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:18.620
1918 flu re- resurrected by the NIH and now i understand that he's moved his

01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:23.180
theory on to a bird flu pandemic but you must

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:29.980
notice that nobody ever nobody ever does this for me nobody ever does this for

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:34.220
nick hudson nobody ever does this for jessica hocket nobody ever does this

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:39.820
for for mark hu satanic but for some reason or other

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:44.860
judy mikovitz of all the people to promote on the london real show

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:49.020
she promotes crowdsource the truth and john kullen that's

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.860
interesting i find it very interesting because

01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:59.420
not too long ago john kullen and a guy who i consider to be guaranteed a

01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:03.340
medler charles rixi had some kind of debate about

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:07.020
whether it was again a function coronavirus or whether it was a

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:10.220
resurrected bird flu

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:16.860
charles rixi is somebody who i believe was involved in

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:22.060
well just just let's just say what he is he's a former marine

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:26.140
who at the start of the pandemic was working at a shoe store

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:30.060
as a manager and working on his mba that he says that he was within one

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.100
course of finishing but didn't finish because he had to stop

01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:36.700
to fight the pandemic was one of the first people infected got infected on

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:41.340
his way back from whoever he was in europe

01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.620
became a member of drastic at some point and then

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:50.860
the the diffuse proposal was first leaked charles rixi before it was

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:54.540
leaked to veritas maybe at the same time

01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:58.540
the veritas leak doesn't acknowledge that charles rixi and drastic also got

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:03.660
the got the document charles doesn't really ever mention that veritas got

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.460
the document and charles in his infinite wisdom and

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:13.980
and you know head to toe patriotism decided that when this

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:19.580
this person decided to leak this grand proposal he decided it was a good

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.620
idea to share it with a bunch of anonymous people on twitter many of

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:27.500
whom are foreign nationals and this is supposed to be somebody

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:32.060
who's fighting for our children's sovereignty

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.420
with a guy by the name of kevin mccaren in japan

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:40.620
this is the the narrative that now is supposed to intersect logically

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:46.220
with the idea that the the judy mikovitz promoted

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:51.980
pandemic flu guy now considers charles rixi a legitimate virologist

01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:56.540
and and and bio-weapons expert needs to talk to him

01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:00.540
and try to convince him that it was flu rather than coronavirus and he didn't

01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:07.340
succeed but the point is again this has got to be a theater

01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.820
these people are not legitimate actors arguing about a legitimate discussion

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.940
about how we're going to free our grandchildren this is a limited

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.500
spectrum of debate being sculpted by weaponized piles of money and that's

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.900
about all i can tell you i don't know their motivation but it is not

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.780
to free our children of these mythologies obviously

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:33.420
it's not to free our children from these mythologies

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.620
and giggle on biological is about freeing our children from these

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:40.860
mythologies i believe that deni rancor is fighting

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:45.340
to free our children i think nick hudson and and martin niel and jessica

01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:48.540
hocket and thomas binder and husatonic live

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:53.900
mark kulek are all fighting for this i think jonathan angler is also fighting

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:57.340
and i'm hoping that many more of these people in this circle will come to

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.340
fight for this as well but you can put these people in

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:04.940
you can put judy in you can put them in at

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:08.700
they're not fighting for our kids right now they're still fighting for the

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.860
novel virus that explains the excess deaths they're still fighting for

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:17.100
between seven and 25 million people being killed over the last four years

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:21.820
and they're fighting very sure to make sure that college age kids don't realize

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.180
that it had so much to do with fear uncertainty and doubt about do not

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:28.940
resuscitate orders and ventilators and lack of antibiotic use and poor use of

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.180
steroids and remdesivir medazalam and propofol and opioid deaths that were

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:36.780
ignored and death certificate fraud financial incentives to do all of the

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:40.780
things above track and trace millions of dollars spent and gone and lost

01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:43.740
along with the pcr fraud the lateral test flow fraud

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:47.420
and likely sequencing fraud

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:53.660
and instead they spend hours arguing about which virus went around the world

01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:58.220
for five years who's right about which virus who's right about who made it who

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:01.100
unmasked who

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:06.620
and it's this limited spectrum of a debate that has been crafted and curated by

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.980
these actors for four years that has us trapped

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:13.740
that they want us to pass this narrative down to our children that we have to

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.500
stop and our children are on this road right now all by

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.460
themselves looking for us to provide answers

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:24.380
looking for us to provide guidance and on their phone

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:28.060
are the cars on this road figuratively representing misleading

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:32.940
information on the internet misleading information and mainstream media

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.260
oops

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.660
and so no matter whose car they get into on social media they're going to find

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:42.540
that there was a novel virus that killed millions and millions more were saved

01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:46.940
from that's likely from gain a function and therefore we'll come again

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:49.820
they have changed the way we think ladies and gentlemen they want to change the

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:52.620
way our kids think forever

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:56.540
and we can't allow them to do that some of these people are responsible for

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:59.260
seeding the worst-case scenario narrative others are unwittingly

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:01.900
participating others are participating because they've been

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:05.340
coerced they have they have figurative or real guns

01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:08.460
pointed at their head i have no doubt that some people are

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.700
controlled to that level i've been pinched financially to that level

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.340
that's why nobody talks about strict liability

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:19.020
that's why nobody talks about the vicp and the cicp being a seventh

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:22.780
amendment violation that's why nobody talks about zero evidence of spread

01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:25.340
except for denny rancor and a few other people

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:29.420
and denny did a brilliant job yesterday on steves podcast once they got 48

01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:32.220
minutes in they started talking about things that were relevant

01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:35.420
and they won't do that math

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.660
and instead they're pretending to contribute to stopping and starting the

01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:43.820
train of the pandemic they're contributing they're pretending to

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.340
contribute to the stopping and starting of the train by taking their own little

01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:50.940
place on the side of the train and doing exactly what this guy does

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:54.700
pretend to pull it to a stop chalk their hands and pretend to push it

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:58.940
into a go again with all these different issues

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:04.140
fighting about natural immunity or pcr cycle counts or primers

01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:07.580
or whether it's again a function spike or not arguing about

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.540
you know this novel treatment or that novel treatment doesn't argue about

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:14.060
whether you need any novel treatments it accepts that

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:19.580
arguing about how long and how hard we should lock down never discussing

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:24.860
the misuse of basic treatment for respiratory disease never discussing

01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.620
what all of these protocols did never discussing the financial incentives

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:32.540
or the the lack of liability if you declared somebody covid in new york and

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:36.780
elsewhere never discussing the elderly care malfeasance that's still going on

01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:40.780
now with these these all these new vaccines they're pushing on these old

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.420
people and never talking about nutrition or

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:48.700
immuno 101 or conflating the virus with 5g

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.860
and so for three or four years this has been going on with people making us

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:56.620
ask the wrong questions about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin

01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:01.260
asking the wrong questions about why these things would work

01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:05.420
and why they weren't in our medicine cabinet for the 15 years before the

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:09.260
pandemic never asking the question about

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.860
you know is this double-stranded DNA contamination really the only danger

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.620
or is it really true what jonathan cooey says

01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:20.060
the transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent no one's going to

01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:24.940
ever ask that question because that answer is known

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:29.420
and no one's ever going to question the diffuse proposal in fact now we have a

01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.580
full court press designed to make you accept it

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:38.380
we have emily cop going on different podcasts on alternative media and

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:44.140
youtube telling everybody about how she's figured out the scooby-doo

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:47.980
and they stitched it together and that's how this happened

01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:52.940
and that was already by design many years ago i was already calling this out

01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:56.940
as what they were going to do all they've done is add to it with these

01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:01.900
with these foyer requests doubling down on the biological significance

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:04.940
that's not significant to make you believe that this

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:09.180
previous record of pandemic potential in

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:12.540
in the literature means anything to make you believe that these

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:15.740
these exercises that they were in were for a reason

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:21.180
other than convincing these bureaucrats what to do when the fire alarm went off

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:25.500
they want you to believe that this these mass casualty events aren't bombs

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:28.300
like jessica hockett says they are but they're

01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:33.340
they're evidence of spread and these actors have been telling us all kinds

01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:36.780
of different worst case scenarios for four years with the idea of us being

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:41.420
confused frustrated and doubting what we know

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:44.700
and i think the reason why more people are not telling the truth right now is

01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:49.340
because they know they have been coerced into accepting the national security

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:54.940
event and their participation in it precludes them from telling everything

01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:59.580
i could tell you but then they'd have to kill me

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:04.460
and this was all by design to make sure that the spike of the vaccine and the

01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:08.140
spike of the virus were confounded with one another

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:12.460
so that the general public the mouth-breathing tv watching skilled tv

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:17.980
watching public who would believe that either double-stranded dna or the

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.020
spike itself is responsible for these toxic effects it

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:25.580
couldn't be transfecting healthy humans because that that's fine

01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.940
and we prove that with three billion transfections that's what they want you

01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.300
to believe they want you to accept that vaccine antibodies

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:35.740
mean something and that they're actually better than the antibodies from

01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:40.060
natural infection and for five years it feels like now i've been trying to

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.700
explain that t-cells are not even in this

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.580
they're not even in this equation and that's already

01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:49.740
disingenuous to the nth degree they're already misleading our children when

01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:54.380
they put this kind of immunology on the cdc website this

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:59.420
new world order about bat cave viruses is the way they want to

01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:03.020
govern us forever and if we do not expose it for the

01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:06.220
lie that it is it will become truth that's the way this works

01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.420
they are working hard to make that happen right now

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:12.140
these people these worst case scenario people

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:15.420
and they know what has been accomplished they already know what has been

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.540
accomplished they already know where we're going

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:23.580
that's why they keep us focused on the who instead of on the prep act

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:29.100
they don't tell us that the the vaccine act from 1986 when it was first written

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.540
was actually pretty badass and they changed it in the years following that

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.580
made that took all the teeth out of it they don't tell us that

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.460
they don't tell us that they're planning to move to a digital currency because

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:45.820
the dollar is overextended but that's obviously known

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:50.460
all economists know that but they're not telling our kids that

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:54.060
they're telling the kids that the convenience of this is going to be

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:58.700
how i mean the the universal income idea is awesome

01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:03.020
they are going to destroy the social fabric of america because the america

01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.860
is the last bastion of real freedom a real republic even if it's just a

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:10.300
skeleton of what it used to be this is one of the only places where

01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:15.660
that thing could be maintained maybe even rebuilt

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.140
the EU is lost if we don't if we don't survive

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.500
the EU is already gone

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:27.740
and you can see that it's that this is a plan right you can look back at the

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:34.380
spars pandemic timeline and look at like page 48 or something you can see

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:38.780
that they were already talking about a scenario where eventually

01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:43.260
they would have to cop to the rushing of the vaccine and the injuries that

01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:47.580
resulted from it it's in the script and in

01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:51.180
canada they're already talking about how you only really need access to your

01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:54.300
kids medical records until they're 14 and then after that you have to get

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:59.820
permission from your kids and that giving access to your kids

01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:06.700
your kids um your kids medical records is a uh

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:11.020
a special permission granted to them by your health care team

01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:14.540
so they're already taking away the sovereignty over our children in

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.740
canada and they've already done it in many places in the united states make

01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:21.660
no mistake about it it's just not on the nightly news

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:25.500
because they they want your kids on this train

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:30.140
they want your kids on the train where they accept the edicts from public health

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:33.500
they want your kids to accept that required vaccines are just things you

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.740
have to do they want you to accept that testing is just things you have to do

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.780
they want you to accept that quarantine is something that might have to happen

01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:44.300
again because asymptomatic spread of RNA virus is real

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.140
and because virologists are playing around with gain of function viruses

01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:52.700
all the time we cannot let our little children get on this train we need them

01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:55.500
to understand that this is a humoristic

01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:01.100
joke of a ridiculous narrative and the ridiculous methodology

01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:08.940
that dates back to pre tony fauci pre tony fauci who has actually if you look

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:12.540
at the scoreboard he has accomplished nothing

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:19.980
in his 39 years in his seat accomplished nothing cured nothing

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:25.420
made nothing progress our children have more chronic disease than ever our

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:30.620
population is more unhealthy than ever tony fauci presided over the

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:38.700
greatest decline in average well-being in american history that's the truth

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.620
and the penultimate show before he stepped off stage

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:47.500
was this show right here the show of an illusion

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:51.820
of a consensus of a novel virus spreading around the world

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:56.940
killing millions of people this faith between 25 7 and 25 million people were

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:59.980
killed according to some of these news outlets

01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:04.300
we've got to get rid of this we cannot let our children grow up believing this

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.380
faith it's much worse than Santa Claus much worse

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:12.940
than the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy this is a disaster

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:18.300
okay it's a disaster we've got to explain this biology we've got to learn the

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.460
biology we've got to be able to articulate it well

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:24.780
enough so that we're not bamboozled by either side anymore

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:28.060
and that means we need to be able to articulate very carefully how the

01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:31.900
american vaccine schedule in particular should be

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:36.700
notably criminal to anybody with

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.060
critical thinking skills its strict liability should be

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.860
advocated for all pharmaceutical products including

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:47.180
vaccines in children investigating the use of deadly protocols to create a

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:50.140
mass casualty event that could be misconstrued as friend and

01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:54.540
as spread and investigate the use of transfections to create a homogenous

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.220
signal around the world that could be misconstrued as that spreading

01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:01.260
pathogen we also need to identify these people

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:05.420
who are meddling with us by just simply asking them very carefully

01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:09.740
to ponder the consequences of there being no evidence of spread

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:12.700
not just saying i guess we're going to agree to disagree because i really

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:15.500
believe in these sequences i really believe

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:19.180
in this in this in these o2 measurements from these

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:24.700
these paramedics boy they sure had something they sure saw something

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:30.540
i believe i believe i believe do you believe

01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:33.420
they don't use the word clone they don't use the word transfection

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.460
and they can't summarize across the entire show

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:39.980
he actually agreed that there was no evidence of spread that the virus

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:44.140
didn't spread around and yet still thinks that there's something was there and

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:48.380
that that justified the transfection and justifies talking about everything

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.500
going forward it's an extraordinary level of

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:55.740
dissonance that we saw yesterday dissonance excuse me

01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:59.580
that we saw yesterday in the brain of Steve Kirsch at least that's what he

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:02.540
it seems that he was

01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:07.020
implying i mean i i don't think that he actually holds these

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:11.580
disparate views of his head i think he understands like anyone

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.260
in this in this narrative that there was no spread

01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.700
i think he understands that very well and i think he understands that

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:22.860
as a member of the teamwork case scenario it is his job to make sure that

01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:26.700
we never get to the stage where we can articulate that

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:30.700
and it was a devastating devastating interview i think daddy did a really

01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:35.100
good job and if you haven't seen it that was the video from yesterday

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.220
please stop all transfections and humans because they are trying to eliminate

01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:41.180
the control group thanks for joining me this afternoon

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:46.060
for this afternoon broadcast there's 95 people watching so it looks like to me

01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:49.500
that a three o'clock show or a two 30 show is not going to be the worst thing

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:53.260
ever so that's really great thanks for joining me guys

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:57.100
um you want to eliminate the control group i don't

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:00.380
i'm going to be a member of the control group for the rest of my life because

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.260
intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:06.700
intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:10.540
you can find me at giggleambiological.com and gigglehome.bio

01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:14.940
um and uh yeah the ways to support are going to

01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:18.380
expand a little bit we're going to try and fix that but for now you can just

01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:21.900
share the stream subscribe if you can afford it

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.100
one-time donation they're also very welcome um

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.460
this is really just uh running on fumes kind of thing

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:32.300
it's not a one-man band anymore because my wife is now helping out

01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:35.180
with the communications and that kind of thing so it should be a little bit more

01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:38.700
fluid but i can't guarantee anything i just know for sure i'm gonna be here

01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:41.980
every day that i'm awake every day that it's possible

01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.420
um and so thank you very much and uh leave a

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:49.260
message um if you can leave an email send me a

01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:53.820
question i'd love to play or your um i'd love to play your voicemail

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:58.060
question over over live stream um so consider

01:54:58.060 --> 01:55:01.580
recording a question if you have one and then leave your name separately at

01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.940
the end and i can edit it out um thank you very much for all of
