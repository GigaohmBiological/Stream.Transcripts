WEBVTT

00:21.587 --> 00:31.696
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the, of America, of the American people is being used to create the crisis.

00:31.756 --> 00:35.679
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin maybe America.

00:35.819 --> 00:36.239
I don't know.

00:36.900 --> 00:37.761
Crash the dollar.

00:37.961 --> 00:38.401
I don't know.

00:38.942 --> 00:42.865
Steal the rest of our, our, what limited treasury value we have left.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.148
I don't know, but I know for sure.

00:46.533 --> 01:03.975
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary and more importantly never be possible.

01:06.079 --> 01:12.824
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:13.244 --> 01:16.287
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:16.367 --> 01:25.814
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:25.854 --> 01:32.439
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.920
do do

05:14.225 --> 05:16.225
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

05:17.285 --> 05:22.006
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.127
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:26.847 --> 05:27.473
It's embarrassing.

05:43.137 --> 05:44.337
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

05:44.817 --> 05:45.698
Welcome to the show.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.678
I feel really inspired by the Olympics.

05:47.738 --> 05:56.500
I know that sounds a little crazy, but the American basketball team came back from a pretty average performance.

05:56.560 --> 06:02.081
It's pretty hard for these pros to play with rules, rules like traveling and this kind of thing.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.902
And so it's been a real challenge for them, especially with certain teams.

06:05.942 --> 06:09.702
And it was really cool to watch them come back at the end of that game.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.963
And it was also really cool to see

06:12.563 --> 06:19.048
The American women's sevens rugby team, if you haven't checked that out, check it out.

06:19.088 --> 06:22.952
Talk about a last second win.

06:23.092 --> 06:35.382
And so I think it's still possible, even though America has been behind the ball for many years now, because our government and our biosecurity state has been at the forefront of this illusion.

06:36.282 --> 06:44.408
creating it, laying down the groundwork in people's minds in Hollywood and in the NIH.

06:45.869 --> 06:57.157
We really are at the stage now where I think we can make a real play to have the average person understand why intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

06:57.637 --> 07:02.121
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent and RNA cannot pandemic.

07:02.521 --> 07:03.682
I'm really excited to be here.

07:03.702 --> 07:04.783
My name is Jonathan Cooley.

07:04.803 --> 07:06.345
I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

07:06.745 --> 07:09.107
I used to be a career academic biologist.

07:09.147 --> 07:10.968
I wanted tenure and all those good things.

07:11.749 --> 07:22.618
The name of this show is derived from gigaohm, a measure of resistance that I used to try to achieve as I made these recordings depicted here and described here.

07:23.799 --> 07:29.902
Um, welcome again to the show where we understand that the mystery virus isn't responsible for the excess deaths.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.804
We understand it's a much longer list of things.

07:33.584 --> 07:37.566
Um, and we were led by our noses and we've been running in hamster wheels.

07:37.906 --> 07:42.729
Um, and that's the reason why almost nobody realizes that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread.

07:43.249 --> 07:53.195
And almost no one is talking about how easily we can fix this problem by simply instilling strict liability again and restoring our Seventh Amendment right to sue for damages.

07:53.615 --> 07:55.976
We need a new consensus about transfection.

07:56.016 --> 08:01.580
We need a new consensus about the vaccine schedule in America and about what RNA can and can't do.

08:01.640 --> 08:06.963
And that's what GigaOM Biological is going to try to do, point to the murder and the lies.

08:07.023 --> 08:10.205
It's these people, ladies and gentlemen, these people have decided

08:10.925 --> 08:13.006
to, whoops, darn, I cut that wrong again.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.930
These people have decided and some of them are participating wittingly.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.831
Some of them are way in over their heads.

08:19.891 --> 08:22.252
Some of them still don't know how over their head they are.

08:23.253 --> 08:27.716
Others of them are trying desperately to distance themselves from what they've done.

08:28.136 --> 08:35.241
And the way that they do it is by keeping you focused on the COVID shot and not asking any questions about what they were up to in 2020 and before.

08:37.202 --> 08:47.449
And as long as you go on to social media and climb into your chair and decide how you're going to retweet and tweet to save the universe, you're effectively caught in their trap.

08:47.489 --> 08:52.333
And it doesn't matter what social media app you use or where you share your information.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.194
These are the people who are going to rise.

08:54.614 --> 09:01.219
These are the people who are going to rise independent of what you do and how good your stream is or how hard you write your sub stack.

09:01.619 --> 09:03.120
These are the people that are going to rise.

09:03.180 --> 09:03.881
Those are the people

09:04.441 --> 09:08.228
that are going to share each other and never going to share you.

09:08.268 --> 09:16.083
And that's because they serve the weaponized piles of money that are currently using social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

09:17.586 --> 09:34.373
And as long as you argue with whom they want you to argue, or even worse, sit back in your chair and listen to the people that they want you to listen to argue, then you will accept the premises of their narrative because you'll be asking and arguing about the questions that they want you to argue about.

09:34.814 --> 09:40.976
And the unfortunate thing is, is that people like Noam Chomsky and Edward Bernays have been telling us this for decades.

09:41.657 --> 09:46.759
And unfortunately, we are the generation that finally the cage is closing.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.385
and the mythology is complete.

09:49.466 --> 09:51.892
In other words, almost everything that we believe

09:53.183 --> 10:03.031
about how the American government works, about how banks work, about how universities work, about hospitals work, and about how the dollar works is all a mythology.

10:03.071 --> 10:05.593
And on top of all of that is public health.

10:06.113 --> 10:07.554
And so that's really where we are.

10:07.594 --> 10:12.798
That's why it's so difficult to try to give an opening presentation every day.

10:13.299 --> 10:18.943
And instead, we're oftentimes just kind of stuck, you know, saying that, hey, here we are trapped on a starship.

10:21.145 --> 10:21.965
Hold on one second.

10:21.985 --> 10:22.846
Let me just answer this.

10:26.223 --> 10:26.784
Hello, sir.

10:26.804 --> 10:31.209
Hey, I just wanted to bounce some ideas off of you.

10:31.389 --> 10:32.430
I'm live.

10:32.650 --> 10:33.491
I'm live right now.

10:33.531 --> 10:36.555
But maybe you want to just say hello to everybody and let them know what you're up to.

10:38.697 --> 10:39.739
Oh.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.442
I think they already recognize your voice.

10:46.621 --> 11:09.270
I was just gonna go over some of the 2020 2021 timeline I Think some of the evidence that Judy Mike of its and Robert Malone are longtime colluders might have Some evidence might be that Well, obviously they both work with that Who's that producer?

11:10.110 --> 11:13.091
Gosh darn it Mickey Mickey Mickey something something

11:16.897 --> 11:24.488
The book was planned, the production was all done, it was pretty much certain that she was going to be the big face of the show.

11:26.049 --> 11:53.968
counter-narrative in 2020 but Malone wasn't Malone was a behind-the-scenes kind of guy and Malone didn't come out till 2021 and I think the fact that they've never they try not to share the stage together but they both work with Willis and they're also both kind of tight with this former Feds group and that's what I'm really focusing on right now they're this I shared some stuff with

11:54.969 --> 11:56.569
I said, I said I'm live, right?

11:56.630 --> 11:57.330
You know that, yeah?

11:58.090 --> 11:58.330
Yeah.

11:58.490 --> 11:58.850
Okay, okay.

12:00.091 --> 12:01.411
Yeah, well, hopefully I didn't say anything.

12:01.431 --> 12:02.151
Hello, everybody.

12:03.552 --> 12:04.632
Well, anyways, I can let you go.

12:04.652 --> 12:06.272
I don't really need to say this right now.

12:06.752 --> 12:07.433
Okay, that's fine.

12:07.473 --> 12:12.634
I just wanted to, I didn't want to just blow you off or give you the button message.

12:13.054 --> 12:14.055
We'll talk after I'm done.

12:14.175 --> 12:14.355
Yeah.

12:14.655 --> 12:15.695
I don't want to steal your show.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.855
It's like a 20 minute rant.

12:17.396 --> 12:18.256
It's all good, man.

12:18.536 --> 12:18.696
Bye.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.982
Hey, I guess you guys know who that was.

12:23.562 --> 12:25.803
That's our good friend, Mark.

12:27.063 --> 12:31.445
And I just got a message from Grace's dad, Scott, a minute ago.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.746
He wants to talk again.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.967
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to really tell you that I think

12:38.123 --> 12:40.004
the sort of landslide is starting.

12:40.364 --> 12:57.031
The sort of, you know, once you get converted to understanding what's going on, once you see the chair with the joystick and the goggles that you've been sitting in and you actually take those goggles off and you take your hand off the joystick, it starts to become a very, very quick learning experience.

12:57.071 --> 12:59.192
And so I think we just got to keep pushing.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.272
That's what I think.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.653
And so I got to correct something from yesterday.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.432
I've got to correct something from yesterday.

13:11.553 --> 13:20.078
I said that the video that we watched yesterday, which was by Nova on PBS called Vaccines Calling the Shots was from 2017 and that was wrong.

13:20.179 --> 13:23.841
It was actually from 2014, which according to Pamela, who was in the chat,

13:28.925 --> 13:30.106
earlier, but had to leave.

13:30.987 --> 13:34.510
I think that is the same year that the movie Vaxxed came out.

13:34.550 --> 13:47.302
And so here we are, also in the same year, this time at Harvard, having a discussion with five people on the panel, some of whom contributed to the making of that movie.

13:47.342 --> 13:49.404
And so I thought I would double back

13:49.884 --> 13:52.285
and make sure that people realize that I made that mistake.

13:52.305 --> 13:58.587
Of course, I'm going to correct some of these titles on the various platforms that were on to reflect that it was 2014, not 17.

13:59.188 --> 14:07.231
But more importantly, what it should do is really shock you that that was really 10 years ago.

14:07.291 --> 14:10.332
That was five or six years before the pandemic.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.893
Like, that is extraordinary.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.354
This is not even really close to the pandemic.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.554
So you start to see how

14:19.798 --> 14:26.642
The childhood vaccine schedule has been expanded and resisted and expanded and resisted.

14:26.702 --> 14:41.012
And as social media has grown in scope and in breadth and depth of coverage, it has become a harder and harder thing for them to occupy and to dilute.

14:42.312 --> 14:49.057
And it used to be quite easy, I think, for the PBS NewsHour to dilute with a documentary like that, but now,

14:50.177 --> 15:05.343
with daily shows like Giga Home Biological, daily shows that ask questions like this, even in the best case scenario, they need to titrate us to the truth at best because otherwise there will be a flood and they will look foolish.

15:06.063 --> 15:14.686
And so, so much of our narrative over the last three years has been sucked up by these people that we've been paying a lot of attention to and I've been screaming and yelling about, but

15:16.553 --> 15:26.320
What I think is most important now for me personally, and maybe for a lot of the people that watch, is to really reflect on when we didn't know what was going on.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.582
And so what's crazy, and this makes me feel just a tiny, tiny bit better.

15:30.043 --> 15:38.469
When I saw the PBS NewsHour yesterday, thinking that it was from 2017, that was when my family and I were already in the United States and could have seen that on television.

15:39.520 --> 15:45.522
And so I was a little bit like, wow, was that really going on in the background while I wasn't paying any attention?

15:45.542 --> 15:52.405
Because I was so fricking focused on grant writing and experiments and the next day of experiments and where my mice were and whatever.

15:52.845 --> 16:03.449
You really can reflect back and realize how much of my cognitive energy was wholly focused on the kinds of things that I, all the things that I was busy with at Pitt.

16:05.382 --> 16:22.021
And in the meantime, parents really having to deal with the vaccine schedule, really having to deal with vaccine injury are the only ones in this little bubble that of course moves temporarily through space and time in our culture where only the people who are

16:22.725 --> 16:38.153
dealing with newborn babies to year two are confronted with this what would obviously be an incongruity for any adult like any parent once you have a kid you understand there's a different kind of thing if it's your kid or a kid

16:38.713 --> 16:44.358
the level of responsibility and protective instinct that you have changes a lot.

16:44.719 --> 16:54.467
And there's a lot of evidence for it in the brain of animals that we've studied where whole new windows of synaptic plasticity open up in the males that have babies.

16:54.728 --> 16:59.532
And so when you have children, you are changed into a parent.

16:59.632 --> 17:03.616
And it's a biological truth that a lot of people want to ignore.

17:04.614 --> 17:11.741
And indeed, right now at this crucial state and this crucial time in human history, we want to ignore.

17:11.801 --> 17:21.950
And if we go back 10 years and watch how this movie was edified by these people at Harvard on stage about why this movie needs to be made,

17:22.530 --> 17:30.039
what points were being made in the movie, how can we more accurately and more nuanced bring these messages to parents.

17:30.079 --> 17:38.770
And you will notice that there is no concern about the possibility that the combination of lack of liability, lack of strict liability,

17:40.265 --> 17:54.703
and this guaranteed crop of new customers has in any shape or form the possibility to be used malevolently or maliciously or even just mischievously.

17:56.371 --> 18:10.102
In theory, the vaccine schedule in America could be made perfectly safe and even more profitable by simply putting saline into those shots if they're indeed not doing anything for anyone ever.

18:13.260 --> 18:22.850
And so we really need to look at this, I think, with wide open eyes now and try to see where we were and how we got here and realize that it was a very steady ramp.

18:23.651 --> 18:31.420
I've been thinking it much more of like, oh, they made this huge mistake at the start of the pandemic and all these lies suddenly became obvious.

18:32.503 --> 18:43.488
But what we're finding out is that these lies were being told in a ramp up to the pandemic, not in a ramp up of a couple months, like, you know, they started with DEVENT 201 in October of 2019.

18:44.149 --> 18:46.890
And so obviously they were planning.

18:46.970 --> 18:47.590
No, no, no.

18:48.711 --> 19:01.077
I'm talking about 10 years earlier, 15 years earlier, where they started to write the papers about pandemic potential, started to speculate about pandemic potential, started to build laboratory models about pandemic potential.

19:02.398 --> 19:20.788
started to build laboratory models about viral detection and viral sequencing and viral ecology and all these other things, which established this whole mythology, the basis of the idea of a pandemic.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.009
And so this is part of it.

19:23.049 --> 19:24.410
This is 2014.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.431
Sorry for the long introduction.

19:27.851 --> 19:28.512
Let's get at it.

19:29.512 --> 19:30.733
Excuse my head for a second.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.200
Welcome.

19:37.380 --> 19:43.643
My name is Phil Hiltz, research associate at MIT and former director of the Knight Science Journalism Fellowships.

19:44.223 --> 19:45.404
And today I'll be the moderator.

19:45.824 --> 19:52.927
The forum is presented in partnership with Tangled Bank Studios, a film production company of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

19:53.707 --> 19:57.830
and in collaboration with NOVA, PRI's The World, and WGBH.

19:58.911 --> 20:03.354
NOVA aired a film on PBS last week called Vaccines Calling the Shots.

20:03.774 --> 20:10.258
That was produced at NOVA, by NOVA at WGBH, Tangled Bank Studios, Gene Poole Productions.

20:10.839 --> 20:12.360
And we're lucky to have some of the producers.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.561
Gene Poole Productions.

20:15.702 --> 20:18.764
That is, it's like they're just waving it in our face.

20:18.864 --> 20:19.544
I mean, come on.

20:19.825 --> 20:21.125
With us here in the audience today.

20:22.407 --> 20:26.497
We will be showing three clips from that film during today's webcast.

20:26.717 --> 20:30.486
We will also take questions from the online and studio audiences both.

20:31.442 --> 20:45.691
A question for the panelists can be emailed to theforum, all one word, at hsph.harvard.edu, or tweeted to atforumhsph using hashtag hashvaccinetrust.

20:46.012 --> 20:52.336
So all the way back in 2014, we were already, as an alternative way of communicating, we were tweeting stuff out.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.277
Incredible.

20:54.117 --> 20:55.398
I really resisted Twitter.

20:55.438 --> 21:00.081
I thought it was stupid for a long time until somebody said, oh, yeah, but everybody's solving the mystery on Twitter.

21:00.101 --> 21:01.002
You've got to join Twitter.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.682
That's where everybody is.

21:02.702 --> 21:03.683
You've got to join Twitter.

21:05.083 --> 21:09.625
You can also participate in a live chat discussion that's happening on the forum site right now.

21:10.625 --> 21:23.130
Today's panelists, starting from my immediate right, are Seth Mnookin, Associate Director of MIT's Graduate Program in Science Writing and author of The Panic Virus, The True Story Behind the Vaccine Autism Controversy.

21:24.071 --> 21:28.335
And Barry R. Bloom, Professor of Public Health at the Harvard School of Public Health.

21:28.796 --> 21:35.102
We have Richard Malley, Senior Associate Physician in Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital Boston.

21:35.683 --> 21:41.128
And we have Jane Kim, Associate Professor of Health Decision Science, Harvard School of Public Health.

21:41.869 --> 21:44.190
So we've gathered here to discuss trust.

21:44.310 --> 21:45.330
What was that?

21:45.930 --> 21:51.392
And we have Jane Kim, associate professor of health decision science, Harvard School of Public Health.

21:52.112 --> 21:55.213
So we've gathered here to discuss trust in vaccines.

21:56.313 --> 22:00.395
While most Americans do vaccinate their children and routinely follow recommendations.

22:00.835 --> 22:03.315
I mean, did you does anybody scream it about that yet?

22:03.495 --> 22:03.796
I mean.

22:05.216 --> 22:08.437
Health decision science, is that really what they said?

22:09.505 --> 22:10.465
Is that even a thing?

22:10.865 --> 22:11.906
Can you imagine?

22:14.346 --> 22:15.806
You know what I want to be when I grow up?

22:15.846 --> 22:17.887
I want to be a health decision scientist.

22:18.407 --> 22:22.348
I think that's the most important thing in the world is to be a health decision scientist.

22:22.468 --> 22:26.749
I've wanted to be a health decision scientist since I was a little tiny Jane Chan.

22:26.769 --> 22:31.490
Your associate physician in medicine division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital Boston.

22:32.070 --> 22:37.511
And we have Jane Kim, associate professor of health decision science, Harvard School of Public Health.

22:38.251 --> 22:41.353
So we've gathered here to discuss trust in vaccines.

22:42.454 --> 22:55.143
While most Americans do vaccinate their children and routinely follow recommendations, some are now choosing to alter the recommended schedule themselves or select specific vaccines they will allow to be given to their children.

22:55.523 --> 22:58.885
And some have even declined to vaccinate their children altogether.

22:59.926 --> 23:00.306
Why?

23:00.566 --> 23:02.648
And why are these decisions important?

23:03.530 --> 23:07.651
To kick off the conversation, we will show the first of three clips from the Nova film.

23:07.911 --> 23:12.513
This clip shows several mothers who explain their decisions about vaccinating their children.

23:13.613 --> 23:15.254
We saw this yesterday, but it's good.

23:15.434 --> 23:21.096
Wants to vaccinate her two children, but she's chosen not to follow the recommended vaccine schedule.

23:21.954 --> 23:27.615
So the plan is to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible, but we're doing one vaccine at a time.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.335
I don't know if that's the right way.

23:30.395 --> 23:31.696
I don't even know where I came up with that.

23:31.736 --> 23:32.336
Yeah, I don't know.

23:32.956 --> 23:37.277
Yulia Patse has a four-year-old and is expecting another child soon.

23:37.977 --> 23:40.557
She delayed vaccinating her oldest till she was three.

23:41.657 --> 23:45.018
I was concerned that her immune system couldn't handle it, and we just waited.

23:45.738 --> 23:50.439
My son and her, they're not vaccinated yet, and my older ones don't have boosters.

23:51.317 --> 23:53.579
Mariana Festovsky has four children.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.663
She vaccinated at first, but then one child had a seizure.

23:58.443 --> 24:00.685
I was just really worried about reactions.

24:01.386 --> 24:05.229
And I am worried about the diseases, so kind of confused, really.

24:06.631 --> 24:10.314
In America, children must be vaccinated before they start kindergarten.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.617
But the required shots vary from state to state.

24:14.257 --> 24:18.201
And most allow for exemptions based on personal or religious beliefs.

24:19.042 --> 24:22.565
Here in California, almost 3% of children are exempt.

24:23.126 --> 24:24.907
And in some schools, it's more than 30%.

24:26.517 --> 24:28.779
I have a lot of friends who don't vaccinate at all.

24:28.839 --> 24:35.264
And if you say vaccine around them, they look at you like you are literally, well, you know, like you are poisoning your child.

24:36.065 --> 24:43.171
On the other hand, you have parents that can't even understand why this is even a question.

24:43.751 --> 24:49.156
Nobody is willing to really have a conversation with you and discuss what's a severe reaction.

24:49.176 --> 24:51.458
Is it OK to have a seizure?

24:51.998 --> 24:55.001
I would really like to know what the real risks are.

24:56.874 --> 24:58.375
Okay, Seth, what do you think?

24:58.575 --> 25:00.416
And the real answer is they don't know.

25:00.516 --> 25:05.518
You see, they don't understand the immune system well enough to augment it with intramuscular injection.

25:06.238 --> 25:23.405
And they have this proxy, which is antibodies or seroprevalence that the government and the FDA and the CDC and the biosecurity state has allowed to become a standard which defines immunity both in the context of medicine and in the context of public health.

25:23.885 --> 25:25.006
That's how stupid it is.

25:26.175 --> 25:38.438
And because all of these people have a vested interest in not understanding it, because otherwise their career will crash, most of these people don't bother understanding it, because what little part that they have to understand isn't very hard.

25:38.898 --> 25:51.021
You heard that that author down there at the far end here, where I use my arrow, that guy right there, I don't know if you can see that or not, that guy right there was an author of a book called The Panic Virus.

25:51.866 --> 25:58.149
So he thinks it is a problem of people and of lemmings and of sheep.

25:58.909 --> 26:05.752
And this woman is a associate professor at Harvard in something called health decision science.

26:06.553 --> 26:07.313
Stop lying.

26:08.414 --> 26:14.096
And that's pretty extraordinary because we're not, I mean, really, I don't know.

26:14.176 --> 26:15.297
I just, I gotta,

26:16.860 --> 26:18.802
I got a lot of trouble with some of this stuff.

26:18.903 --> 26:19.503
I really do.

26:19.984 --> 26:24.449
Because we should have been aware that this was going on, and we weren't.

26:24.930 --> 26:26.111
And it is frustrating.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.836
It is very, very frustrating that that's the case.

26:30.556 --> 26:34.561
But when you don't have children, you're not paying attention to it.

26:34.661 --> 26:35.142
And when you're

26:35.754 --> 27:03.616
when your children are healthy or your children are through this crucial window of development, the odds of you noticing the injury rather than just thinking it's an allergy or a rash or eczema or whatever other things, acne, whatever they get is lower and lower and lower because the temporal correlation will most likely go away.

27:04.508 --> 27:15.180
And so unless a teenager is severely injured, all the other symptoms that are probably attributable to some of these older vaccines that are very, very, very toxic.

27:16.860 --> 27:19.762
are misattributed to just everyday life.

27:19.842 --> 27:23.464
Again, because these kids aren't in perfect shape, they're not eating perfect foods.

27:23.925 --> 27:27.707
And so there's lots of potential for it to be a compound problem.

27:28.207 --> 27:43.777
And of course, public health has every incentive and has billions of dollars aimed at making sure that whether it's 1% of the problem or 100% of the problem, that the vaccine schedule is never considered

27:44.497 --> 27:47.479
a possible contributor to any of these problems.

27:48.199 --> 27:48.960
That's the trick.

27:49.720 --> 27:54.844
It's the idea that, well, I mean, it's not the vaccines.

27:54.904 --> 27:55.784
Let's start there.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.545
And then we can list whatever we want to.

27:58.146 --> 28:11.775
And because it's this thing, and it's mostly genes, and it's mostly what, then you immediately, it's all about just convincing people to understand one thing and one thing only, that the vaccines can't be to blame.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.316
It's impossible.

28:13.717 --> 28:15.199
Vaccines don't hurt people.

28:15.239 --> 28:21.847
And when they do, as they showed us yesterday, it's one in like 20 Michigan football games.

28:24.090 --> 28:31.279
It's really extraordinary what we're dealing with, because that is the bamboozlement that we have

28:32.398 --> 28:48.101
such an understanding of the immune system that we have wiped out childhood diseases as a result of using vaccines, and that the vaccines can't possibly change in quality, in quantity, in content.

28:48.881 --> 28:54.723
They can't possibly need even stricter regulation because of how they are almost mandated.

28:55.103 --> 29:00.684
They can't possibly need stricter controls or better under, none of this stuff.

29:02.042 --> 29:09.751
Because once it's a vaccine, it's safe, and you are racist and anti-American for thinking otherwise.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.601
That's where we are, and we were there in 2014.

29:13.641 --> 29:15.721
That's what's extraordinary.

29:15.941 --> 29:16.481
Going on here.

29:17.102 --> 29:18.342
What leads to this hesitancy?

29:18.562 --> 29:26.285
Well, one thing I think is interesting is we're dealing with a generation that, for the most part, has not seen the effects of vaccine-preventable diseases.

29:26.565 --> 29:34.767
So my peers have not grown up in an era where they saw children blinded by rubella or routinely hospitalized by measles.

29:35.348 --> 29:38.328
One thing I think is really interesting about that clip is their statement.

29:38.348 --> 29:39.289
You mean like when the...

29:40.129 --> 29:48.155
When the Brady Bunch did an episode about one in the family getting measles and had a whole chalkboard about who had this and who had that.

29:49.156 --> 29:51.417
And they were keeping track of all the things that they got.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.019
And after they got them, it was all fine.

29:53.039 --> 29:56.341
But then actually Greg also got measles because he'd never had it.

29:56.361 --> 30:08.250
I mean, when those kids were all in the hospital and, you know, like back before we had antibiotics for things and that kind of stuff.

30:09.949 --> 30:10.289
I don't know.

30:11.070 --> 30:14.273
These people are absolutely spectacularly committed to this lie.

30:14.993 --> 30:16.174
I don't know if this is the right way.

30:16.374 --> 30:29.925
I don't even know how we came up with this when they're talking about the alternate vaccine schedules, which is one of the things I find so shocking because we do know how we actually came up with the vaccine schedule that is recommended.

30:30.886 --> 30:33.488
And that's figuring out how we could best protect children.

30:33.568 --> 30:33.909
So what

30:34.409 --> 30:42.616
those parents are doing are leaving their children vulnerable at the exact moment when all of those vaccine-preventable diseases are going to potentially do the most harm.

30:43.857 --> 30:56.107
So, but, you know, I think in addition to their not having seen... And so they don't make any consideration for the fact that the earlier you push back an intramuscular injection of any combination of substances,

30:57.062 --> 31:11.068
with the intent of augmenting the immune system, the earlier you push it back, the more likely it is that you're going to interfere with an uninterruptible process in development, and that that will have cascading effects for the rest of that child's life.

31:13.345 --> 31:25.689
Just think about it from the perspective of being a retired 65-year-old man who's decided that he's gonna try heroin versus a six-month-old baby who you've decided you want to have try heroin.

31:26.189 --> 31:32.230
And which one might have worse consequences for the outcomes of that individual?

31:35.011 --> 31:40.673
Because when we get to this critical window in development that in the brain is,

31:42.341 --> 32:03.676
acknowledged in neuroscience in general to extend all the way to the early 20s for our young people, that augmenting their immune system with the possibility of interfering with the ongoing development of not their liver, but their brain is a pretty amazing arrogance.

32:05.669 --> 32:23.221
If we were really to appreciate the irreducible complexity and the sacred biology that are our teenagers, then as they go through puberty, when their body is trying to completely reorganize the synaptic structure of their brain from a young animal to an adult form,

32:24.366 --> 32:37.532
that we have no concept or clue of what's actually going on there, but we just know that it's a waterfall cascade across metabolic pathways for like four or five or six, sometimes seven years.

32:40.553 --> 32:49.177
And we have the arrogance to think that we can intramuscularly inject combinations of substances to augment that immune system during that process.

32:50.720 --> 33:00.222
A process that we all agree takes at least 22 years before the full frontal cortex and neocortex of a human is mature.

33:05.069 --> 33:27.720
And this is the kind of biological truth that these people should be telling and preaching from the rooftops, that when a baby comes out, the reason why you can't just put it outside in a little house with a bowl of water and food is because it is still way, way, way developing and still requires incredible amount of social, physical,

33:29.491 --> 33:33.957
interaction with its parents and its conspecifics, it's part of its development.

33:33.977 --> 33:37.001
And without that, then the development will go wrong.

33:38.944 --> 33:46.574
Is it impossible to imagine that if you raised a baby in a shoebox and never had any physical contact with it, that it might be slightly different than a baby who wasn't?

33:49.025 --> 34:08.087
And so then is it so difficult to understand why augmenting the immune system with a combination of substances injected intramuscularly at six months and then at seven months and at eight months and then at nine months for the next six months until they've been augmented or injected 28 times might be a little arrogant?

34:10.098 --> 34:25.588
light of the complex process that's happening before our eyes that maybe the first thing we should have done is focused on making sure that that mom is fully facilitated in her maximum ability to be able to breastfeed and care for that child in a stress-free way.

34:27.029 --> 34:29.871
So that that child grows up in a stress-free environment.

34:31.929 --> 34:33.290
but we don't talk about that at all.

34:33.330 --> 34:34.991
They're not talking, they don't care about that.

34:35.031 --> 34:44.055
They're just, they just think that childhood is all dependent on whether or not you got measles or whether you're not, you got whooping cough or even worse, whether you saw people who got it.

34:44.876 --> 34:47.457
And if you don't, then you grow up real naive and dumb.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.803
and unaware of things, and it's a danger.

34:52.124 --> 35:02.934
In a lot of these diseases, you also saw there some skepticism, some larger skepticism about expertise, about doctors in some situations, so a lot going on.

35:02.954 --> 35:04.675
Yeah, I'm a bit confused, I guess.

35:04.835 --> 35:07.097
So let's look at another clip about vaccines.

35:07.878 --> 35:11.982
This one begins with an immunologist, Gustav Nussl, from the University of Melbourne.

35:13.271 --> 35:21.515
What we have seen in the industrialized world is essentially all of the major epidemics, they've vanished.

35:22.315 --> 35:29.638
Mums today have every... Remember that we're listening to Australians and Australian doctors and Australian people.

35:31.179 --> 35:38.062
And in 2014, we watched an Australian person in the hospital wearing a headdress, having this baby with whooping cough.

35:38.442 --> 35:40.903
And we're listening to this guy who can't even brush his teeth.

35:41.843 --> 35:47.468
Tell us about how we need vaccines and how vaccines are magic, just like Brett Weinstein thinks they're magic.

35:50.851 --> 35:56.956
The 2013 measles outbreak in New York hit hard and fast, but remained within the Brooklyn area.

35:57.236 --> 35:59.378
Oh, is this the part with the guy and the flag?

35:59.418 --> 36:02.480
Why didn't it spread to the other 8 million people in the city?

36:08.462 --> 36:12.803
The virus was in circulation, even though it often wasn't obvious.

36:14.244 --> 36:18.225
And it was being carried by people who often had no idea they were infected.

36:26.148 --> 36:31.069
But the vast majority of people who came into contact with the virus had protection.

36:31.789 --> 36:32.950
They were vaccinated.

36:40.713 --> 36:42.553
for whether or not I'm going to get sick.

36:43.234 --> 36:49.815
One is, if I bump into somebody who has the disease, am I protected against it or not?

36:50.855 --> 36:59.737
But the other piece, and the more important piece, is the chance I will bump into somebody in the first place who has this disease.

37:01.397 --> 37:04.418
And you can think of this as these sort of concentric circles of people.

37:05.393 --> 37:13.197
And the less the disease exists in my circle or the next circle or the next circle, the safer I am.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.299
It's known as herd immunity.

37:18.143 --> 37:24.045
and it protects everyone, including young babies and people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons.

37:24.325 --> 37:45.352
Remember Brett told us about a sort of hybrid herd immunity where a combination of vaccines and infection and clever use of prophylactics like ivermectin could essentially bring us back to zero COVID, which was a goal in June of 2021 that he still thought was very attainable and worthwhile, maybe even to the point of forced drugging a nation.

37:47.465 --> 37:49.726
And in New York, it worked.

37:50.066 --> 38:01.191
If we didn't have the high vaccination levels that we do, you know, in New York City and even in this community, I can promise you we would have had hundreds if not thousands of cases.

38:02.672 --> 38:04.713
But this protection is fragile.

38:05.614 --> 38:12.977
For highly infectious diseases like measles, we need 95% of the community vaccinated for herd immunity to hold.

38:14.505 --> 38:18.810
If the rate drops, even just a few percent, herd immunity can collapse.

38:20.211 --> 38:25.698
Barry, tell us more about vaccines themselves and how their nature fits into this picture.

38:26.431 --> 38:39.919
So the whole concept of a vaccine is to help people, particularly kids, develop an immune response against a germ that threatens, ultimately, their lives.

38:40.959 --> 38:45.922
The usual way it was done historically is you got sick with an infection, and you either lived or died.

38:46.242 --> 38:49.224
If you lived, you probably generated immune response.

38:49.264 --> 38:51.626
So many infections don't come twice.

38:53.067 --> 39:00.892
But I think what Sir Gus Nossel's comment was is hard to imagine how astonishing the effects of vaccines were.

39:01.773 --> 39:11.520
I mean, it's the only example where a disease, smallpox, has been eradicated from the face of the earth, and I think it's hard for you to imagine, but there were 50 million

39:12.341 --> 39:19.445
patients with smallpox, a very big percentage of which, 80% in the case of children, died from smallpox.

39:20.486 --> 39:22.527
That's gone since 1977.

39:24.888 --> 39:30.412
Polio, 350,000 paralyzed cases worldwide before the vaccine.

39:30.912 --> 39:34.334
And now we have maybe 15 to 20.

39:34.574 --> 39:38.857
We have, in this country, essentially no polio, or very, very little.

39:40.097 --> 39:45.678
And before then, in the U.S., we had 20,000 cases of kids that are paralyzed.

39:46.138 --> 39:51.239
Before whooping cough vaccine, there were 12 million kids in this country who got whooping cough.

39:51.479 --> 39:53.320
Every kid got measles.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.701
And so these have done spectacular things.

39:57.981 --> 40:03.322
Just remember that the fatality rate of these diseases plummeted drastically with the

40:04.230 --> 40:14.354
with increase in sanitation, water purification, antibiotics, just the advancement of medicine, washing of hands, this kind of thing.

40:14.414 --> 40:22.198
So there were lots of advancements that were made that led to a drastic drop in the mortality rate of all of these diseases and their prevalence.

40:24.154 --> 40:32.258
which is oh, so many and so often completely credited to the rollout of vaccines, which is completely disingenuous.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.719
The question is, how do we know they're safe?

40:34.939 --> 40:35.479
Are they safe?

40:36.240 --> 40:39.501
And the answer is, vaccines are different than drugs.

40:40.201 --> 40:44.663
We know that because you give them to healthy kids, not people who are sick.

40:45.344 --> 40:45.864
Wow.

40:46.024 --> 40:52.547
So vaccines are different than drugs because we give them to healthy kids, not to kids that are sick.

40:53.575 --> 40:55.538
Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

40:56.379 --> 41:01.407
Who is the audience that he is convincing with such a ridiculously dumb statement?

41:02.648 --> 41:07.030
I mean, that is some seriously, that is some seriously sad shit right there.

41:07.170 --> 41:07.711
Are they safe?

41:08.471 --> 41:11.713
And the answer is vaccines are different than drugs.

41:12.413 --> 41:16.855
We know that because you give them to healthy kids, not people who are sick.

41:17.495 --> 41:23.839
And we have to be enormously thoughtful and careful to prevent anyone from being harmed by a vaccine.

41:24.079 --> 41:30.562
See, so the idea is, is that we would never, I mean, this is even more important than sick kids.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.561
Think about how stupid of a question that is.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.621
What kind of rationale is that?

41:36.681 --> 41:42.302
That we would be, we're being even more careful with healthy kids than we are with sick kids.

41:42.702 --> 41:54.964
That is the stupidest argument, the most illogical, hugest, gigantic, massive incongruency in thinking morally, ethically.

41:54.984 --> 41:58.045
I don't know what this is, but this is just dumb.

42:00.447 --> 42:05.510
Somebody should have stood up and yelled at this guy and then walked out to like, this is atrocious.

42:07.191 --> 42:10.814
High schoolers should reject a, an argument like this.

42:12.915 --> 42:21.100
They're intramuscularly injected combinations of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system of a healthy child.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.941
You're God dang right.

42:22.981 --> 42:24.302
They're different than medicine.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.906
not in the way this monkey is saying it.

42:31.426 --> 42:32.747
But people are very different.

42:33.027 --> 42:35.027
No vaccine is absolutely perfect.

42:35.708 --> 42:44.411
And there are, for the vaccines we give now, on the order of one in a million child will find an adverse effect.

42:44.911 --> 42:46.732
We'd love to reduce that to zero.

42:47.372 --> 42:52.174
But the fact is that the safety is as good as it can be made.

42:52.934 --> 42:56.716
And we take, we, the scientific community, the medical community,

42:57.476 --> 43:07.581
as good as an intramuscular injection of any combination of untested substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system can be, which is dumb.

43:08.321 --> 43:09.462
That's as good as it can be.

43:10.162 --> 43:10.683
It's dumb.

43:11.503 --> 43:20.447
It's not going to get any smarter, no matter how many Peter Cullis's or Robert Malone's you put on that problem, it's not going to get any smarter.

43:21.368 --> 43:25.690
That's why Robert Malone was really into electroporation at the skin and stuff, because he knew it.

43:27.475 --> 43:29.596
And he still probably knows it now.

43:30.276 --> 43:31.617
It's just part of the titration.

43:31.657 --> 43:35.539
If we got there all at once, we would throw all these people out of the car and never listen to them again.

43:36.880 --> 43:41.923
If we got to the truth all at once, we would put all these people in jail and never listen to them again.

43:41.983 --> 43:44.104
But we've got to get to the truth over many years.

43:45.004 --> 43:45.965
And that's what's happening.

43:46.405 --> 43:47.946
That's why we have so much work to do.

43:48.566 --> 43:48.906
This was 2014.

43:48.986 --> 43:51.407
Take that enormously seriously.

43:55.902 --> 44:00.927
We heard about, we would like to call it community immunity rather than herd immunity.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.650
What happens when you stop vaccinating?

44:04.230 --> 44:05.672
Well, we don't see much.

44:05.732 --> 44:10.797
We've had more outbreaks in the last two years of vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S.

44:11.257 --> 44:17.263
than we've had in the past 20, because people, for whatever sets of reasons, have chosen not to vaccinate.

44:18.004 --> 44:18.505
their kids.

44:18.565 --> 44:22.250
But let me give you one example to indicate how serious it could be.

44:22.671 --> 44:24.334
We had almost wiped out polio.

44:24.714 --> 44:30.563
It was down to four countries when one state in Nigeria decided to stop vaccinating.

44:31.457 --> 44:40.162
Within two years, 24 countries that had wiped out polio now and continuingly have to vaccinate their kids all over again.

44:40.922 --> 44:47.946
So one has only to look at what's happening with Ebola when you don't have a vaccine for a lethal virus disease.

44:49.287 --> 44:52.428
So the power of vaccines is enormous.

44:52.548 --> 45:00.033
And the challenge is, how can we persuade people that it's in everybody's interest to protect their kids and their communities?

45:01.465 --> 45:05.648
Rick, tell us a little bit about your experiences as a doctor who delivers vaccinations.

45:06.149 --> 45:10.372
Well, so I'm a pediatrician, and I've worked for many years at Children's Hospital.

45:11.153 --> 45:18.999
And the first experience I had was very similar to what both Seth and Barry said, which is I started at Children's Hospital as an intern in 1990.

45:19.940 --> 45:25.664
What we learned was how to take care of children afflicted with Haemophilus influenzae type B invasive disease.

45:26.465 --> 45:29.530
I became very good at that, I think, by the end of my internship year.

45:29.990 --> 45:35.818
And I was ready, preparing myself to train the new intern crop in what I had learned, and the disease disappeared.

45:36.239 --> 45:42.207
Because in 1990, we introduced the H flu type B universal immunization campaign in the U.S.

45:42.888 --> 45:52.756
From one year to the next, a disease that was afflicting one in 200 kids completely disappeared from our state, from pretty much every state in the U.S.

45:53.196 --> 45:55.078
and then- I want to hear that again, hold on.

45:55.398 --> 46:04.325
Invasive disease, which is, well, I'm a pediatrician and I've worked for many years at Children's Hospital and- No, he's in Boston.

46:04.385 --> 46:09.609
It was very similar to what both Seth and Barry said, which is I started at Children's Hospital as an intern in 1990.

46:11.210 --> 46:16.952
What we learned was how to take care of children afflicted with Haemophilus influenzae type B invasive disease.

46:17.753 --> 46:20.794
I became very good at that, I think, by the end of my internship year.

46:21.274 --> 46:28.657
And I was ready, preparing myself to train the new intern crop in what I... So I'm pretty sure that what he meant was HIB, H-I-B.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.018
There is a vaccine called the HIB

46:33.558 --> 46:36.567
And there is a Hib vaccine, which is like what he said.

46:36.607 --> 46:40.077
It's like some influenza B, hemophilia influenza B, you gotta look it up.

46:40.217 --> 46:41.019
I'm not that guy.

46:42.763 --> 46:45.345
that vaccine is very nasty.

46:45.545 --> 46:50.109
And if you look it up, that vaccine has changed owners a couple times.

46:50.169 --> 46:56.674
And if you look that up, you will find that that vaccine actually immunizes kids to the diphtheria toxin.

46:56.694 --> 47:05.261
The diphtheria toxin is conjugated to the Hib protein, but the large portion of antigenic

47:07.343 --> 47:26.622
information or antigenic material available in that vaccine is actually the diphtheria toxin and so any antibodies that are said to be indicative of that vaccine working are much more likely to be specific for the diphtheria toxin than they are for the Hib

47:27.554 --> 47:39.763
protein itself, and I would be willing to bet dollars to donuts that when they evaluated the effectiveness of these products that targeted that and used this combination of the diphtheria toxin and Hib

47:42.250 --> 47:52.335
protein that they were looking at, polyclonal antibodies that could pull down any portion of that protein, which again doesn't necessarily provide immunity.

47:52.415 --> 48:03.281
It's another interesting thing is that the Hib vaccine in at least some databases that I have seen, I'm not sure it's smart for me to say which databases I've seen,

48:04.661 --> 48:13.325
But I've seen a state database or more, or indirectly seen analysis of these databases.

48:13.985 --> 48:21.669
And I do know that the Hib vaccine, be it Hib-Titer or the new one, which is I think Prevnar,

48:22.729 --> 48:33.217
These are both basically the same formulation and they are both shit and they are both associated with a high number of vaccine reported injuries in the childhood schedule.

48:33.597 --> 48:44.766
And so it's very curious to me that in 2014, this guy's talking about it when one of the worst of those vaccines was actually in use and later pulled from the market.

48:48.450 --> 48:50.291
But yeah, he's ready to train interns.

48:50.631 --> 48:51.032
I've learned.

48:51.352 --> 48:52.392
And the disease disappeared.

48:52.793 --> 48:57.896
Because in 1990, we introduced the H-flu type B universal immunization campaign.

48:58.376 --> 49:04.379
Yeah, he's saying H-flu type B. But if you look it up, it's like, yeah, anyway, you'll see it.

49:04.439 --> 49:07.861
It's Hib, H with a big H, little I, big B, I believe.

49:08.001 --> 49:08.222
US.

49:08.962 --> 49:20.330
From one year to the next, a disease that was afflicting one in 200 kids completely disappeared from our state, from pretty much every state in the US and then in Western Europe.

49:20.950 --> 49:34.019
And that was a dramatic transformation, such that today when we talk to residents or physicians and we mention Haemophilus influenzae type B disease, the greatest majority of them have never seen a case and don't even consider it as even a possibility.

49:34.799 --> 49:41.265
Now, I work in a travel clinic at Children's Hospital where I immunize children and adults who are traveling abroad.

49:42.026 --> 49:49.833
And what I have noticed is very similar to the tape, which is that in general, I'm seeing a patient population that is sort of inclined to get vaccinated.

49:49.893 --> 49:51.755
Otherwise, they wouldn't really come to a travel clinic.

49:52.256 --> 49:55.359
But even amongst them, there is this idea that perhaps

49:56.289 --> 49:59.392
I wonder how they were identifying it, right?

49:59.452 --> 50:01.073
I wonder if there was a test for it.

50:01.133 --> 50:09.521
Maybe the way that it works is they, they roll out a test and for a few years, they're telling all these pediatricians to test for this and see how prevalent it is.

50:10.081 --> 50:17.989
And then after a few years, if the test says that it's prevalent all the time in the, in the ICUs of hospitals, they can argue that they need to roll out a vaccine.

50:18.029 --> 50:19.570
I wonder if it's something like that.

50:19.610 --> 50:20.611
This guy would definitely know.

50:21.211 --> 50:27.773
we should be managing the vaccine schedule a little bit differently, because their kids may not be ready to receive that vaccine.

50:28.313 --> 50:50.299
And I think it's something very interesting, because in many ways, as clinicians, as physicians, we participate in the confusion that one of the individuals portrayed in the clip showed, where if we say yes, we might start changing the schedule to accommodate your child, we are sort of acquiescing to the idea that this may not be safe, and let's manipulate

50:50.419 --> 50:51.639
And so that's the idea.

50:52.880 --> 51:17.669
Any recognition of the complexity of the problem, any recognition of the sacredness of early childhood development, both from a biological perspective, but also from a neurobiological perspective, from a metabolic perspective, from an allergies perspective, from any number of perspectives, it just makes very good sense up until

51:19.099 --> 51:24.283
around 85 or 90 in America, it makes good sense to delay it.

51:25.204 --> 51:31.889
That's why they still allow you to delay shots in Norway until year two, if you're going to breastfeed until then.

51:33.811 --> 51:45.740
Do you understand the implications of that simple statement that a country like Norway or Sweden, or even the Netherlands will basically go, okay, well, if you're going to breastfeed, don't worry.

51:45.800 --> 51:46.621
You can come back later.

51:49.417 --> 52:02.482
But here we have people on stage at Harvard that are creating the illusion of consensus that the only responsible position to take is that the earlier the better.

52:02.582 --> 52:09.545
And don't you dare question what we recommend because we have the best interest of your family and your kid at heart.

52:09.585 --> 52:12.766
And it's all about doing it for your neighbor or some shit.

52:14.246 --> 52:18.068
There is no biology on this fricking forum at all.

52:21.323 --> 52:39.898
We got a lot of work to do, because this is how people got to the stage where in 2020, when Brett Weinstein went on his show with a bandana around his face and then wood shop goggles on to explain how he goes to the store, and they were already here before the pandemic, then boom.

52:42.848 --> 52:51.498
Not only were they not going to get out, but they were going to take the TV seriously because even the batshit crazy people on the intellectual dark web are agreeing with them.

52:52.679 --> 52:53.840
that could be even worse?

52:53.860 --> 52:58.342
What if it's a laboratory virus that we can't make immunity to because it's flying AIDS?

52:59.362 --> 53:01.463
It differently just to make you more comfortable.

53:01.824 --> 53:06.086
But in fact, if we said that for her child, why would we not do it for everybody?

53:06.146 --> 53:16.131
So I think in many ways, we participate in the confusion when we try to accommodate fears that are probably best dealt with scientifically rather than emotionally.

53:17.252 --> 53:23.277
Jane, it seems there's some mistrust directed at other vaccines, newer ones, besides the standard.

53:23.317 --> 53:24.618
Here we go.

53:25.178 --> 53:25.458
Sure.

53:25.558 --> 53:28.561
So one of the new vaccines is HPV vaccination.

53:28.601 --> 53:33.665
I think there are several issues that really make HPV vaccination very unique.

53:34.125 --> 53:39.987
The first and I think most obvious thing is that the vaccine is targeting a sexually transmitted infection.

53:40.908 --> 53:44.729
HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide.

53:45.329 --> 53:54.413
And we now know that it causes nearly all cervical cancers, as well as a large number of... Causes all cervical cancers.

53:54.473 --> 54:00.255
I mean, think about that Nobel Prize winning statement for the person who figured that shit out.

54:00.575 --> 54:06.939
vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, which are actually on the rise.

54:07.380 --> 54:11.582
So this vaccine is actually trying to protect against cancer.

54:11.602 --> 54:17.606
And I think when they first came out on the market, nobody knew what HPV was.

54:18.187 --> 54:22.009
And even less people knew the causal link to cancer.

54:22.029 --> 54:25.972
And it's so funny, isn't it, that nobody knew what HPV was.

54:26.112 --> 54:27.553
And so I got a job with

54:28.213 --> 54:43.226
Merck and Harvard to become a health decision scientist and figure out why it is that people don't think that we can use a vaccine to cure a virus that causes cervical cancer, like all of them, and all the anus and penis cancer too.

54:43.346 --> 54:43.767
Cancer.

54:44.327 --> 54:54.037
So the vaccine really caught on as an STD vaccine, which automatically makes the issues, the subject a little more touchy, a little bit more controversial.

54:54.057 --> 55:06.109
I think over the past couple of years, there's really been an effort with communication and education, a turning of the tides to raise awareness that this is really an anti-cancer vaccine.

55:07.318 --> 55:13.120
The second thing I wanted to mention was actually the timing of vaccination, which makes HPV vaccination special.

55:13.940 --> 55:21.282
This is a vaccine that is targeted primarily to young adolescents, so ages 11 and 12, and as early as age nine.

55:21.942 --> 55:28.124
And this is a time where health services are not being administered as routinely.

55:28.984 --> 55:32.365
This vaccine requires three doses over a six-month period.

55:33.005 --> 55:34.506
Oh, that is just gross.

55:36.795 --> 55:43.403
I mean, she is just advocating for it as if that makes sense, as if that's just okay.

55:44.945 --> 55:48.249
I mean, wow, it's just awful.

55:49.750 --> 55:53.054
Raise awareness that this is really an anti-cancer vaccine.

55:54.264 --> 55:56.925
The second thing I wanted to mention was actually- And why is that?

55:56.965 --> 55:58.765
Because we watched that video yesterday, right?

55:58.805 --> 56:08.108
Because we don't want parents to think that it's a sexually transmitted disease we're trying to prevent so that we're enabling their kids to have sex younger.

56:08.568 --> 56:09.968
We don't want them to think that.

56:10.068 --> 56:11.769
So we've got to make it about cancer.

56:11.809 --> 56:22.652
See, they are telling you what the limited spectrum of debate is, that if you trap parents in that limited spectrum of debate, they'll basically have no choice but to take your recommendation.

56:23.376 --> 56:29.206
The limited spectrum of debate is that, don't worry, this is not to encourage your kid to have sex.

56:29.727 --> 56:34.275
Don't worry, this is really about cancer and you don't want your kid to have cancer.

56:38.305 --> 56:42.008
timing of vaccination, which makes HPV vaccination special.

56:42.808 --> 56:52.615
This is a- Three in six months or our perfectly orchestrated augmentation of your teenager's immune system will not work quite right.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.717
And they might be vulnerable to cervical cancer anyway.

56:58.739 --> 57:03.663
Think about what she's- Think about what- Why are you doing that?

57:04.163 --> 57:05.864
Think about what she's saying there.

57:06.865 --> 57:07.105
Right?

57:07.205 --> 57:07.746
Think about it.

57:09.397 --> 57:10.818
Think about what she's saying there.

57:10.838 --> 57:13.180
I'm just gonna go back one more time.

57:13.280 --> 57:22.586
Vaccine really caught on as an STD vaccine, which automatically makes the issues, the subject a little more touchy, a little bit more controversial.

57:23.927 --> 57:34.654
I think over the past couple of years, there's really been an effort with communication and education, a turning of the tides to raise awareness that this is really an anti-cancer vaccine.

57:35.868 --> 57:41.652
The second thing I wanted to mention was actually the timing of vaccination, which makes HPV vaccination special.

57:42.473 --> 57:46.236
This is a vaccine that is targeted primarily to young adolescents.

57:46.616 --> 57:49.819
So ages 11 and 12 and as early as age nine.

57:50.479 --> 57:52.341
And the only reason why.

57:53.649 --> 58:00.936
The only reason why is because of the story that she told originally, which is that it's a sexually transmitted disease, they say.

58:01.557 --> 58:08.984
And so we have to get it in kids before they have sex, even though she says she doesn't want to make it about that.

58:09.024 --> 58:10.405
She wants to make it about cancer.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.808
The reason why that time she has no other.

58:14.136 --> 58:15.337
back up the truck, right?

58:15.377 --> 58:23.662
She has no other explanation for why it's between 10 and 12 and not at 16 or not at 22 or not at four.

58:25.023 --> 58:32.048
She has no argument other than the preceding bullshit argument that this is a sexually transmitted disease.

58:32.068 --> 58:34.149
We got to get it to them before they start having sex.

58:34.169 --> 58:35.450
So we should target between 10 and 12.

58:36.331 --> 58:37.832
So we get the vast majority of them.

58:39.073 --> 58:40.793
You see how dishonest they are?

58:41.053 --> 58:43.174
You see how dishonest they've always been?

58:43.194 --> 58:45.594
They're so dishonest, they don't even understand they're doing it.

58:46.275 --> 58:52.076
This is a time where health services are not being administered as routinely.

58:52.716 --> 58:53.416
Because why?

58:53.476 --> 58:59.277
Because the kids are healthy, they're growing, they don't need a lot, they don't get sick a lot, so they're not coming into the doctor.

58:59.777 --> 59:01.938
And so this is a problem because, you know,

59:03.169 --> 59:26.721
This vaccine requires three doses over a six-month period, so we're really... In order for our highly orchestrated augmentation of your teenager's healthy immune system to work properly, these doses have to be given in a strict regimen in a six-month time window because we understand exactly what's going on and if it doesn't happen in that six-month time window, then it won't work.

59:27.202 --> 59:27.442
Stop!

59:28.102 --> 59:28.583
Lying!

59:29.103 --> 59:30.024
And so that's why.

59:30.044 --> 59:38.553
I mean, it's really important to understand that we have such an intricate understanding of how these vaccines work that some of them only need one every few years.

59:38.713 --> 59:41.596
Others of them need three doses in six months to work.

59:41.917 --> 59:42.677
Stop lying!

59:43.819 --> 59:45.200
Stop lying!

59:46.440 --> 59:57.846
placing a burden on parents and the vaccine recipients themselves to come back to the health clinic for multiple visits at a time when they wouldn't otherwise be intersecting with the health care system.

59:58.306 --> 01:00:11.513
So I think in talking about how to increase the rates of HPV vaccination and other vaccines, we'll really need to figure out how to overcome these logistical challenges to make the vaccines more accessible.

01:00:12.353 --> 01:00:17.856
The last thing I wanted to mention was actually the timing of the disease relative to vaccination.

01:00:18.356 --> 01:00:26.720
So for a lot of the childhood vaccines, we're really addressing diseases that have a very imminent, very visible threat.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.384
But with HPV vaccination, we're talking about preventing cancers that otherwise wouldn't present themselves for another 20 or 30 years.

01:00:34.304 --> 01:00:43.969
We are making a silly, crazy claim that in a six-month battery of three shots, we can effectively prevent many different types of cancers.

01:00:46.671 --> 01:00:52.454
That's what she should say if she was being truthful about what Merck is promising with their product Gardasil.

01:00:53.155 --> 01:00:54.515
Why don't they call it Gardasil?

01:00:54.535 --> 01:00:57.357
Why don't they remind us that it's a commercial product?

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:00.186
They don't want you to realize that, right?

01:01:00.206 --> 01:01:06.920
They want you to think that these are all generic medicines that are made by some generic factory that the government runs.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:16.345
So I do think that there is some kind of discounting of health benefits that we attribute to HPV vaccination compared to these other childhood vaccines.

01:01:18.406 --> 01:01:28.169
And in a similar way with respect to the other vaccine-preventable diseases, with cervical cancer, which is the most strongly linked to HPV,

01:01:29.429 --> 01:01:39.035
We've also been the victim of our own success in that we've had pap smear screening programs for decades that have dramatically reduced the incidence and burden of cervical cancer.

01:01:39.555 --> 01:01:43.818
And so the need for HPV vaccination may not feel as urgent.

01:01:44.318 --> 01:01:51.742
But I think it's critical to remember that for these other HPV-related cancers, there really is no other prevention mechanism.

01:01:51.862 --> 01:01:53.343
There are no screening programs.

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:57.806
And so the HPV vaccines really remain the best defense against them.

01:01:58.709 --> 01:01:59.850
That is just absurd.

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.191
It's the best because that's all we've got.

01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:03.392
I mean, it's so gross.

01:02:04.172 --> 01:02:09.315
She has no biology here at all, and she works in the Department of Health Decision Science.

01:02:10.656 --> 01:02:11.357
Stop lying!

01:02:12.168 --> 01:02:16.631
Now we're going to turn from describing the problem to beginning to talk about what could be done about it.

01:02:17.412 --> 01:02:19.573
Patient education is part of the issue.

01:02:20.174 --> 01:02:25.737
Let's take a look at a clip from the Nova film that shows a pediatrician talking to patients about the HPV vaccine.

01:02:25.798 --> 01:02:26.618
Here we go.

01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:29.800
People often say they wish they could prevent cancer.

01:02:31.221 --> 01:02:33.803
People often say they wish they could prevent cancer.

01:02:33.823 --> 01:02:34.103
I don't know.

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:37.546
I wake up every other morning thinking, man, I wish I could prevent cancer.

01:02:37.606 --> 01:02:38.606
It prevents cancer.

01:02:39.327 --> 01:02:40.688
Who doesn't want that for their child?

01:02:44.358 --> 01:02:46.420
Amy Middleman is a mother of three.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:54.966
She's also- So don't talk about all the toxins that they put on their skins and the toxins that are in your laundry detergent.

01:02:54.986 --> 01:02:58.468
Don't talk about the toxins that are in your laundry tumbler sheets.

01:02:58.528 --> 01:03:10.717
Don't talk about the toxins that are in their processed food or their breakfast cereals or the soft drinks that they drink or the energy drinks that they do or all the other supplements that are around nowadays or the cosmetics that girls buy.

01:03:11.097 --> 01:03:12.999
Don't talk about any of those things.

01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:19.959
adolescent pediatrician involved in assessing the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.

01:03:25.082 --> 01:03:28.525
She vaccinated her children as soon as it became available.

01:03:29.665 --> 01:03:34.208
I am a little confused by the drama around this vaccine.

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:38.991
To me, this is... We are watching a video of other people watching a video that we watched yesterday.

01:03:40.032 --> 01:03:41.353
It's a life-saving vaccine.

01:03:41.413 --> 01:03:43.214
I can't imagine not giving it to my children.

01:03:46.144 --> 01:03:48.667
She can't imagine not giving it to her children.

01:03:48.707 --> 01:03:51.791
If she didn't give it to her children, she probably wouldn't be able to sleep at night.

01:03:51.971 --> 01:04:01.823
On the other hand, I think sometimes we expect parents to have all of the data that we have as physicians, and that's not really fair.

01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:09.735
So our job as providers is to make sure we... Let me give you an alternative universe for a second.

01:04:09.755 --> 01:04:12.015
Shall we try an alternative universe that just came up?

01:04:12.155 --> 01:04:14.076
And you know, I'm not saying this is what we should do.

01:04:14.636 --> 01:04:17.317
I just want to give you an alternative universe to think about.

01:04:17.597 --> 01:04:20.397
Now, let's just imagine that vaccines worked.

01:04:21.578 --> 01:04:22.458
And let's imagine...

01:04:23.677 --> 01:04:25.178
Ooh, that's the bell.

01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:27.420
They are in Detroit now.

01:04:28.701 --> 01:04:38.310
Let's just imagine that vaccines work and that they work by augmenting your immune system, by opening a window of educational opportunity.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:42.934
And then whatever your body is exposed to, your immune system will process and learn.

01:04:45.137 --> 01:04:52.604
And then let's imagine that the doctor sat you down and he said, okay, or she said, um, Jonathan, I'm fearless.

01:04:53.305 --> 01:04:58.810
Uh, your daughter is approaching three years of age and you're considering stopping breastfeeding.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:06.357
And so we need to talk about vaccination against measles and against whooping cough and a couple other things that are really vital in my humble opinion.

01:05:06.977 --> 01:05:23.714
Now, when we do these things, it's going to be really important when we open this window of vulnerability to your immune system, it's going to be really vital that the microbiome of your daughter is in the proper state, that her body is properly detoxed.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:37.348
So that the only possible antigenic signal that your daughter's body would have available to it are the signals that we are going to provide via the oral vaccine and the cream that we're going to put on her.

01:05:37.909 --> 01:05:40.552
So essentially this process is going to take about three weeks.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:46.595
you're going to be on it, she's going to be on a very strict diet, she's going to have to do a couple things like that, but you know, there's a whole list.

01:05:47.096 --> 01:05:54.760
And then if you've checked off all of those things, then we can start the battery of exposure, which will go across three weeks and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:05:56.201 --> 01:06:01.204
Imagine if a doctor showed the kind of

01:06:02.802 --> 01:06:06.846
of understanding, in-depth understanding that I just tried to explain.

01:06:07.106 --> 01:06:22.982
This is a fantasy world where vaccines do work and they do open a window of opportunity in your immune system, but then the doctors understand that the complexity of this is not to be underestimated, and so they take all kinds of measures for three weeks to make sure

01:06:23.482 --> 01:06:35.648
that this young, already pretty developed child at age four is properly detoxed and properly sterile, if you will, from an immunological perspective so that they are ready to be augmented.

01:06:37.964 --> 01:07:02.213
And I really think that if you just start to imagine, if you really believe the thing, if these people really believe the things that they are saying and really understood the immune system and our physiology as a whole for the irreducible complexity that it is, then they would at least have the respect for what they were about to do so that they would have already been at least what I just described there.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:17.816
very respectful of what they were about to try to accomplish and very aware that, you know, when we immunize your child, we're opening up a window that if you make a mistake and expose them to the wrong thing, it could permanently augment them in a way that we don't want.

01:07:20.097 --> 01:07:25.458
That would be approaching something sounding like informed consent to vaccination.

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:32.327
separate the issues and bring forth the important ones that should be considered.

01:07:33.409 --> 01:07:43.984
If again, if this biology turns out to have some real, some real aspects to it, which I'm still open to the possibility that most of it will not.

01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:58.907
that most of these pathogens that are characterized with fancy names are really just symptomologies that have been misconstrued as having pathogens which track with them.

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.370
And I'm much more open to that idea.

01:08:05.626 --> 01:08:09.309
Certainly, certainly much more open to that idea than I was before 2022.

01:08:09.369 --> 01:08:17.195
The key is to vaccinate boys and girls before they're ever exposed to the virus.

01:08:18.175 --> 01:08:20.697
That is before they become sexually active.

01:08:20.757 --> 01:08:22.218
See, so it's still about that.

01:08:22.379 --> 01:08:30.265
So she says that they would just don't want to make it about that when we're trying to give informed consent to the parents and to the children.

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:33.107
And that's just, that is just gross.

01:08:35.788 --> 01:08:39.029
It's recommended for every boy and girl at age 11 and 12.

01:08:39.809 --> 01:08:41.269
This is just like everything else.

01:08:41.289 --> 01:08:45.510
You want to get the vaccine before you have a risk of getting the disease so that it protects you.

01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:50.190
Around 60 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been given in the U.S.

01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:56.212
Like all vaccines, it's carefully monitored for safety.

01:08:57.152 --> 01:09:00.952
There have been claims of rare, serious reactions, even deaths.

01:09:02.173 --> 01:09:04.273
These have been carefully investigated.

01:09:04.963 --> 01:09:09.786
There are no serious adverse events associated with this vaccine in a causal way.

01:09:09.806 --> 01:09:16.169
This is one of the safest vaccines that we have to offer and it prevents cancer.

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:31.437
I would say, Susie, that one of the reasons why they really discourage or let's say don't encourage breastfeeding is because of that, because it's a social, they're creating dissociative behavior.

01:09:31.477 --> 01:09:32.818
I mean, my wife,

01:09:33.806 --> 01:09:40.408
breastfed our daughter until I mean, I don't know, I don't even I don't want to say how long because it was it's magical.

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:50.632
OK, now let's turn to Barry and Seth, who both worked on a report called Public Trust in Vaccines Defining a Research Agenda.

01:09:51.732 --> 01:09:53.473
What research is needed and why?

01:09:53.713 --> 01:09:54.413
Starting with Barry.

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:10.273
One would think that people in the business of immunizing kids and protecting kids from infection would have a really good idea.

01:10:11.178 --> 01:10:22.889
of with the numbers that I've cited and that we know that have wiped out these diseases, as you heard in the film, why would anybody hesitate vaccinating their kids?

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:25.691
We don't have data for that.

01:10:25.751 --> 01:10:31.256
We don't have good evidence to know what are the ways that people

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:34.140
make up their minds about vaccines.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.502
Where do they get the information from?

01:10:36.943 --> 01:10:38.424
How good is the information?

01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:40.907
Is it social networks?

01:10:41.267 --> 01:10:43.930
Is it over the back fence?

01:10:44.191 --> 01:10:45.972
Is it from moms at schools?

01:10:46.873 --> 01:10:51.699
See, social networks in 2014 weren't quite there yet, but they were going to be.

01:10:52.631 --> 01:11:07.776
So it's very hard to develop a strategy if, in fact, we actually don't know what the values that people are bringing when they come to the pediatrician and say, I don't want to use my kid as a pin cushion.

01:11:08.496 --> 01:11:11.658
It's hard to say that's not what this is about.

01:11:11.838 --> 01:11:14.600
It's protecting your kid in the community from many things.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:33.673
So I think there's a huge need for evidence that everybody can believe that would help doctors, Rick and all other pediatricians, and people who work in their offices, who actually often meet with the parents, to do a better job of anticipating their concerns.

01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:39.258
providing the evidence to allow them to make better decisions that are now being made.

01:11:40.199 --> 01:11:42.521
Do we know why the research is lagging behind?

01:11:43.201 --> 01:11:43.822
What caused that?

01:11:47.185 --> 01:11:49.446
I think that's actually one of the many questions.

01:11:49.486 --> 01:12:07.553
I mean, one of the reasons why Barry and I led the workshop that put together this report was because we both had had the experience of being asked to participate in a conference, a workshop, a meeting about vaccine hesitancy and trying to figure out why people were hesitant.

01:12:08.293 --> 01:12:22.104
And I think we both realized, I realized very starkly that here we were discussing and debating why it was people made decisions based on instinct and not on reason, but we had no data in front of us.

01:12:22.384 --> 01:12:27.949
So we were sitting there and throwing out our instinctual reactions as to why people were hesitant about vaccines.

01:12:28.309 --> 01:12:31.872
And that did not seem like a good way to go about that.

01:12:33.993 --> 01:12:41.115
I think there are a couple of things that are really striking if we look back at the last couple of decades of vaccine communication.

01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:45.657
And that's the result of our not having this data.

01:12:46.077 --> 01:12:49.878
We've had really poor vaccine communication outreach.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:54.840
You know, when whenever I see something about HPV, what does that even mean?

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.861
We've had very poor vaccine communication outreach.

01:12:57.921 --> 01:12:59.001
I mean, seriously, stop.

01:13:00.322 --> 01:13:04.808
I think of the smoking ads that show someone in the shower with a voice box.

01:13:04.888 --> 01:13:16.143
And have someone, a survivor of cervical cancer, talking about what it's like to suffer through that, that can very quickly change the conversation.

01:13:16.163 --> 01:13:17.365
Holy shit.

01:13:19.178 --> 01:13:23.223
They're talking about coercion, coercion with no scientific basis.

01:13:23.343 --> 01:13:33.296
We are assuming that this three-shot, six-month battery at 10 to 12 years of age will protect your child 30 years from now.

01:13:33.336 --> 01:13:37.541
We have no data, but why don't we encourage people to take this

01:13:38.402 --> 01:13:49.390
three-dose, six-month battery of augmentation based on an anecdotal portrayal of a cervical cancer victim.

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.029
It's so gross.

01:13:54.349 --> 01:13:57.871
So in terms of the type of research that's needed.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:04.255
I mean, if you're talking from a pure salesman perspective, you know, like how can we get people to just accept it?

01:14:04.715 --> 01:14:09.798
How can we get people to everybody to eat at McDonald's or how can we get everybody to wear Nikes?

01:14:09.858 --> 01:14:11.279
Then that's all they're talking about.

01:14:13.281 --> 01:14:20.085
And of course, in that case, we have, we know all kinds of different ways to coerce people into accepting even, even begging for it.

01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:24.162
That's exactly what they're talking about here.

01:14:24.202 --> 01:14:35.971
There is no rational respect for the sovereignty of parents or their responsibility over their children, and there is no respect for the

01:14:37.228 --> 01:14:44.312
the perfectly made child that comes out of 99.9% of healthy moms all around the world every day.

01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:53.878
Just to amplify a little bit what Barry said, we don't even know, once we have a vaccine hesitant parent,

01:14:55.359 --> 01:15:06.861
if the best approach is to change the subject, which it actually might be, or to sit down and talk to them, or to say, you know what, I'm vaccinating your children, end of conversation.

01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:07.561
Say what?

01:15:10.562 --> 01:15:11.042
Say what?

01:15:11.062 --> 01:15:15.843
In 2014, say what?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:30.668
the subject, which it actually might be, or to sit down and talk to them, or to say, you know what, I'm vaccinating your children, end of conversation.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:35.433
And that's a very wide range of different decisions.

01:15:35.793 --> 01:15:43.200
One thing that's also really, really clear, and Rick, you could probably speak to this, is it's... Does that guy have children?

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.401
He's got too much acne to have children in my humble opinion.

01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:48.162
Not just parents who are frustrated here.

01:15:49.062 --> 01:16:07.009
Pediatricians are also very frustrated because they're put in a position where in a 15 minute wellness appointment, when they have A through Z that they also need to cover, they're being asked to address these really fundamental concerns about their child's health.

01:16:08.129 --> 01:16:12.851
And so I think this is a situation where there's frustration sort of from top to bottom.

01:16:13.231 --> 01:16:17.973
If you want to have that conversation with a patient, there's no way to bill for that.

01:16:18.033 --> 01:16:19.273
There's no insurance code for that.

01:16:19.353 --> 01:16:25.235
So either you need to make up some reason why they need to come back in, or you're stuck not having it.

01:16:25.856 --> 01:16:27.776
Oh man, it's the insurance codes.

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:30.037
They're screwing up our insurance codes, man.

01:16:30.357 --> 01:16:31.218
Holy ships.

01:16:32.098 --> 01:16:32.238
Rick?

01:16:33.105 --> 01:16:34.045
I agree completely.

01:16:34.085 --> 01:16:36.546
I think it's a very frustrating situation for everybody.

01:16:36.566 --> 01:16:47.070
The best solution, of course, is to avoid the sort of nuclear option of saying, I'm going to immunize your child no matter what you say.

01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:50.931
And of course, we can never get away with it.

01:16:51.191 --> 01:16:55.993
And we never want to, because it's really a dismissive way of taking care of patients.

01:16:57.133 --> 01:16:59.294
I think one thing that's very interesting, and I'd be curious

01:16:59.534 --> 01:17:11.677
Under no circumstances are they debating the variable effectiveness of different vaccines, the different necessity for different vaccines, because all of these diseases are deadly.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.904
And since they're all deadly, then they all need vaccines.

01:17:16.944 --> 01:17:23.087
For example, has the rotavirus vaccine saved as many people as the measles vaccine supposedly saved?

01:17:23.688 --> 01:17:32.653
Or have as many people been saved by the, by the, I don't know, DTAP as have been saved by the polio vaccine?

01:17:32.693 --> 01:17:33.353
You see what I mean?

01:17:33.394 --> 01:17:37.056
There's no, it's just all one shelf of good shit.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:42.059
And one shelf of stuff that you just shouldn't question.

01:17:42.139 --> 01:17:42.359
I mean,

01:17:45.285 --> 01:17:46.565
This is how the mass goes.

01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:55.648
At a certain moment, you're on your knees and then you stand up and you walk to the front of the church and you take a wafer and you take a drink and you come back around and you get back on your knees.

01:17:55.668 --> 01:17:57.409
This is just how the mass goes.

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:08.753
You can't ask questions about why you're there except for, you know, you're on your knees because you're in the presence of something that then goes away and so then you're not to be on your knees anymore.

01:18:10.506 --> 01:18:11.528
That's how the mass goes.

01:18:11.908 --> 01:18:17.716
These people are talking about a faith for which they have no basis in reality for believing.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:27.059
other than their own children and their patients haven't been injured in a temporally correlative way that they've managed to detect.

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:29.520
And that is the sad truth of it.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:47.044
See what Jane thinks about this is when you look at the analogy of the hepatitis B vaccine, which is in fact a vaccine that is targeting a sexually transmitted infection that will lead to many problems, including cirrhosis and possibly also hepatocellular carcinoma.

01:18:47.224 --> 01:18:47.584
And so

01:18:47.944 --> 01:18:53.229
So liver disease is being prevented by the hepatitis B vaccine.

01:18:53.269 --> 01:19:00.415
And I think that's the one they give to babies as soon as they come out of the hole, which is the grossest thing of all in America's schedule.

01:19:00.655 --> 01:19:13.207
This is a vaccine that really in many ways is very similar to the HPV vaccine with one, even another similarity, which was originally introduced in adolescence and then shuttled down to the very young.

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:17.350
particularly when they noticed that the uptake in the adolescents was really very low.

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:20.832
But here is a vaccine that really is very similar to the one you see.

01:19:20.872 --> 01:19:25.395
So they couldn't get teens to take it, so they shifted it to date of birth.

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:41.247
And these four adults, or five adults, are pretending to have some basic biological understanding that edifies their better understanding of vaccines than the rest of the people in the room.

01:19:42.142 --> 01:19:42.842
Stop lying.

01:19:43.103 --> 01:19:44.143
And they're not even lying.

01:19:44.183 --> 01:19:44.964
They're just dumb.

01:19:45.884 --> 01:19:51.567
They are just bamboozled by their own bullshit and by their bullshit of the people around them.

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:56.309
No different than what happens in a large congregation in a church.

01:19:58.771 --> 01:20:06.975
Except in this case, they are under the misconception that they don't believe in ghosts.

01:20:08.695 --> 01:20:20.033
that they believe in brick walls and toolboxes and measuring tapes, scales, you know, hard science.

01:20:22.142 --> 01:20:24.944
study, it is a sexually transmitted infection.

01:20:24.964 --> 01:20:29.446
It can also be transmitted other ways, such as IV drug use and so forth, and blood transfusions.

01:20:29.987 --> 01:20:34.109
But it is trying to eliminate a deadly cancer.

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:43.815
And yet now, when we give it to children, I have very rarely heard of parents actively refusing that vaccine, perhaps because

01:20:44.195 --> 01:20:53.361
Perhaps because you have to actively do it, because otherwise you don't even know it's coming, and before your baby's even made any noises, two needles have gone in her ass.

01:20:55.562 --> 01:21:00.886
And if you say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, the obstetrician's not gonna stop and say, oh, you forgot about this?

01:21:00.986 --> 01:21:04.228
No, you have to actually actively ask not to have it.

01:21:06.049 --> 01:21:07.550
These frickin' barbarians.

01:21:08.953 --> 01:21:14.639
The same people that cut the foreskin off of any baby whose parents are too stupid to know better.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.583
Because, you know, it's really handy for cell cultures.

01:21:18.643 --> 01:21:23.468
The virology people like Vincent Racaniello, they really like foreskin culture.

01:21:23.508 --> 01:21:24.649
Fibroblasts are great.

01:21:26.891 --> 01:21:31.236
But America is a bastion of freedom and liberty.

01:21:32.602 --> 01:21:36.904
It's just that our healthcare system is the front-facing part of our slavery, that's all.

01:21:37.144 --> 01:21:44.827
As we are now learning with HPV, we're moving away from talking about it as a vaccine against a disease that is transmitted by sex or IV drug use.

01:21:44.927 --> 01:21:52.410
Nobody would really volunteer for that necessarily, but we've avoided that problem and now the uptake of hepatitis B vaccination is quite high.

01:21:52.890 --> 01:22:00.274
They're saying it's quite high because it's given on the day of birth and most people don't know that it is even dumb.

01:22:03.413 --> 01:22:11.616
I mean, I do think that the initial marketing or how this vaccine caught on was... Can you imagine arguing with that in real time?

01:22:11.676 --> 01:22:12.976
Like, my wife's gonna breastfeed.

01:22:12.996 --> 01:22:14.037
You don't need... What are you doing?

01:22:15.677 --> 01:22:16.378
It's already over.

01:22:18.198 --> 01:22:19.999
You can barely even get a sentence out of your mouth.

01:22:20.039 --> 01:22:20.459
No, no, no.

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:20.919
Wait, what?

01:22:20.959 --> 01:22:21.279
What?

01:22:21.319 --> 01:22:22.460
My wife's gonna breastfeed.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:22.860
It's okay.

01:22:27.614 --> 01:22:33.840
you know, very important to the perceptions that people had about what this vaccine was addressing.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:38.924
I mean, it's, you know, I think that now we're just learning more about HPV.

01:22:38.984 --> 01:22:46.371
We're trying to educate parents that this is really against these cancers that are we might not see as often as, you know, some

01:22:46.431 --> 01:22:47.331
It really is.

01:22:47.431 --> 01:22:49.752
Now that we've tried to prove it, it really is.

01:22:49.812 --> 01:22:52.452
We didn't have P values before, but now we really do.

01:22:52.512 --> 01:22:56.013
So we really have to convince parents because we got those P values now.

01:22:56.033 --> 01:23:03.034
No cancers, but really these are the only ways to prevent them, I think is an important turning point.

01:23:03.634 --> 01:23:12.156
I think the question about whether- It also, of course, implies that every other cancer could, in theory, have a vaccine if we could just find the pesky virus that causes them.

01:23:16.198 --> 01:23:32.913
that we can kind of change the schedule so that we can bring it down to the infant schedule, which would be, I think, maybe place less emphasis on HPV vaccination right before your child starts having sex.

01:23:32.953 --> 01:23:36.356
These things are really that end up making it very taboo.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:38.478
Those data are coming.

01:23:38.538 --> 01:23:43.182
We want to make sure that this vaccine has efficacy that is long lasting enough

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.942
Ethicacy would be what?

01:23:45.082 --> 01:23:46.083
Seroprevalence?

01:23:49.904 --> 01:23:51.844
So that we could bring it down to the infant schedule.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.625
Bring it down to the infant schedule where every vaccine wants to be.

01:23:55.705 --> 01:24:04.187
Where strict liability is not even a factor and there is an unlimited uptake of your product with very little oversight.

01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:05.868
Stop lying!

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.048
It's gross.

01:24:07.796 --> 01:24:09.417
before we actually go ahead and do that.

01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:10.317
So we're hopeful.

01:24:11.458 --> 01:24:14.679
The data look promising, but we just need a few more years before.

01:24:14.859 --> 01:24:26.644
I thought she was a health decision scientist, but somehow or another, she's really up to date on the HPV trials, and HPV testing, and HPV experiments, and wow.

01:24:26.664 --> 01:24:27.265
Stop lying!

01:24:27.285 --> 01:24:29.046
I think we can actually practically do that.

01:24:29.386 --> 01:24:31.867
We have a couple more minutes for discussion of solutions.

01:24:31.987 --> 01:24:34.128
Any other things that we need to add on top?

01:24:35.688 --> 01:24:47.763
I think one of the things that I would like to see, if we had the kind of research data that Seth has talked about, and we know what parental concerns are, doctors

01:24:49.309 --> 01:24:54.012
as you just heard earlier, haven't seen these dreadful diseases.

01:24:54.852 --> 01:25:04.677
And so we're training doctors where it is accepted the kids don't get these diseases, and vaccines is not high on how to train doctors to deal with the problem.

01:25:05.638 --> 01:25:18.665
This school, as you know, is famous for Atul Gawande, who has checklists for surgery and checklists for all kinds of things that are not checklists that you tick off, but they're points where

01:25:19.952 --> 01:25:23.774
It tells you how to deal when you hesitate to move to the next point.

01:25:24.194 --> 01:25:46.184
I would love to see, with the basis of the evidence that we hope is acquired, that every doctor and every person in the doctor's office that meets with parents that have to vaccinate kids will just run through a checklist so they know how not to offend people, how not to dictate to them, and how to engage them in actively understanding why it's good to do this.

01:25:46.705 --> 01:25:47.365
Rick, can we do this?

01:25:48.931 --> 01:25:51.274
I mean, it's difficult, exactly as Seth said.

01:25:51.314 --> 01:25:54.077
It's very difficult because of time issues.

01:25:54.097 --> 01:25:58.902
The amount of time that a pediatrician spends with his or her patients is getting reduced.

01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:09.172
I think some of you may have experienced, if you have children, that the pediatrician now often just lists the vaccines, and then some other health care provider, like a nurse practitioner or a physician

01:26:09.773 --> 01:26:20.480
Well, it's of course misleading parents because otherwise they would be using the words informed consent and talking about how and where the line of informed consent is and how to get parents across it.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.662
But they're not because... Stop lying!

01:26:22.742 --> 01:26:23.402
They're lying.

01:26:23.462 --> 01:26:25.263
The assistant will come and minister the vaccine.

01:26:25.323 --> 01:26:30.207
So actually it's sort of, it's one step removed from even what Barry is saying.

01:26:30.247 --> 01:26:33.229
These are physicians who don't see the disease and actually many of them don't.

01:26:33.829 --> 01:26:35.029
administer the immunization.

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:38.050
So how would they be great advocates for those vaccines?

01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:40.550
I think it's a very important problem.

01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:58.694
And I think some of these solutions like one of my friends took a law school class with Cass Sunstein, setting up a clear educational program for for physicians and training on how to approach it, and really not leave it, for example, for the end when everybody is rushed and time really is running

01:26:58.894 --> 01:27:04.317
It's not informed consent if you can't say no, Catherine, and they don't want anybody to be able to say no.

01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:07.259
No is not an option for this panel, right?

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.501
They have to convince people that no is a dumb choice.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:11.702
So you're definitely right.

01:27:11.742 --> 01:27:16.465
Information would increase hesitancy, but the object is not to give you informed consent.

01:27:16.645 --> 01:27:20.227
Otherwise, informed consent is a two-sided coin.

01:27:20.387 --> 01:27:21.428
One side says no.

01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:23.991
Sure, it might really help things.

01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:25.792
Maybe train the assistants as well.

01:27:26.013 --> 01:27:27.934
Also, yeah, I think that's true.

01:27:27.994 --> 01:27:38.221
But I mean, really, just the fact that the physician is walking out as this is about to happen, and some practices do it differently, but in several, it's really sort of like almost an afterthought.

01:27:38.261 --> 01:27:40.722
Here's the person who's going to administer the vaccines.

01:27:40.903 --> 01:27:44.765
And that's the moment when the parent might say, wait, there's six shots here.

01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:47.007
And what are they for?

01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:48.768
And the person who's administering them.

01:27:48.788 --> 01:27:49.788
So they're just laughing.

01:27:49.808 --> 01:27:50.869
Yeah, I know, six shots.

01:27:50.929 --> 01:27:51.690
It's crazy, right?

01:27:52.350 --> 01:28:01.302
His job is really at that point not to engage in a very thoughtful, they don't have time, they could, but they don't have time to engage in a very thoughtful conversation.

01:28:01.362 --> 01:28:02.884
It's just gross.

01:28:03.265 --> 01:28:04.787
It is really just gross.

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:09.052
I also wonder if there's an opportunity to learn more about individual parents and

01:28:09.793 --> 01:28:16.016
you know, what angle they're coming from, because there are so many aspects of vaccination that worry people.

01:28:16.536 --> 01:28:36.184
So maybe to be able to triage that information a little bit so that when the provider intersects with that patient, to really get down to the bottom of, you know, what is concerning so you don't have to run down the whole thing and the whole gamut and actually instill more fear in the parents, which might, you know, actually happen if you're talking about autism and that didn't even register.

01:28:37.444 --> 01:28:45.227
And so maybe trying to pre-screen, as parents, we have questionnaires that we fill out prior to the health care visit.

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:48.069
Maybe some of this could be included in that.

01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:52.990
I want to make one point in terms of possible solutions.

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:59.853
And this was something that was driven home for me when I brought our first child in to get his vaccines.

01:29:01.354 --> 01:29:01.814
At that point,

01:29:02.635 --> 01:29:05.279
I was lucky to have tied my shoes that morning.

01:29:05.299 --> 01:29:07.362
I hadn't slept.

01:29:07.402 --> 01:29:08.384
I hadn't shaved.

01:29:08.504 --> 01:29:10.247
My fly was probably down.

01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:16.817
I was uniquely poorly disposed at that point to take in information about vaccines.

01:29:17.538 --> 01:29:18.639
anything made me anxious.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:25.544
If they said, you have 20 minutes left on the meter, when you're working on two hours sleep, that's going to make you anxious.

01:29:25.644 --> 01:29:34.570
So I think one thing that could be interesting is moving the initiation of the vaccine discussion to prenatal visits.

01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:40.814
When my wife and I went into prenatal visits, we had a notebook and a list of questions.

01:29:40.914 --> 01:29:42.996
And then we would go home and talk about all the answers.

01:29:43.016 --> 01:29:45.898
That was probably the last conversation we had about

01:29:46.078 --> 01:29:47.899
health care after our child was born.

01:29:48.779 --> 01:29:53.101
And that was a time in which we could take in information.

01:29:53.261 --> 01:30:03.146
And another issue I think we've run into by not initiating that conversation in a health care setting until after the child is born is that parent has already been primed.

01:30:04.226 --> 01:30:11.170
There are very few parents who get through their pregnancy and their birth without someone bringing up at some point the issue of vaccines.

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:21.036
To the extent that the public health community, the medical community can be the people who are priming it, I think that could be really helpful.

01:30:21.277 --> 01:30:31.204
I also, because it's so difficult to... Yeah, I think it's important to point out what Catherine is pointing out in the chat, that really right now we've gone 10 years farther than this.

01:30:32.702 --> 01:30:48.669
And we are now encouraging pregnant moms to take vaccines to protect their babies as opposed to probably where we were in 2014, which is, you know, don't use cosmetics and don't eat raw fish and don't eat unpasteurized cheese because your baby is in development.

01:30:50.249 --> 01:31:01.214
And so that is part of the reason why I think it's important to go back to these videos that are 10 years old so that you can see that it hasn't been a shift that suddenly occurred because of a pandemic.

01:31:02.096 --> 01:31:18.629
But it's been a steady, gradual shift from where we were when we were kids and where this messaging was when we were kids to the point now where young pregnant women are being encouraged by their healthcare providers to take a battery of vaccines, which is absolutely terrible.

01:31:18.929 --> 01:31:19.630
Stop lying!

01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:23.013
address concerns within a wellness appointment.

01:31:23.674 --> 01:31:31.442
I think some pediatric offices, if they're big enough, could hold office hours like once a month or twice a month.

01:31:32.203 --> 01:31:33.344
You don't need to make an appointment.

01:31:33.424 --> 01:31:35.667
You can come in and they'll be

01:31:36.387 --> 01:31:42.350
people from the practice there, or having one person in a practice that's a designated vaccine expert.

01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:52.494
So instead of every pediatrician and every nurse practitioner feeling like, I need to be up on all of the crazy conspiracy theories that have popped up today, you can have one person.

01:31:52.534 --> 01:31:57.777
And if a parent says, I'm concerned about this, you can say, OK, well, I'm going to put you in touch with our vaccine expert.

01:31:57.837 --> 01:32:00.358
And make some time available to have those conversations.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:05.502
Okay, now let's turn to- And what would the vaccine expert be?

01:32:05.542 --> 01:32:23.334
Would it be like that lady Kim over there who works on health decision science, or would it be somebody who is an immunologist and who is capable of adequately explaining the pros and cons of it, or the potential dangers of it, or helping people exercise informed consent about what timeframe they do it on?

01:32:23.894 --> 01:32:27.597
None of this is a question because it's not about biology.

01:32:28.197 --> 01:32:34.065
It's about making sure that people believe that vaccines are 100% as good as airplanes in the wheel.

01:32:34.526 --> 01:32:36.669
They are the best invention since buttered bread.

01:32:37.791 --> 01:32:41.576
The questions, both from online and in studio.

01:32:42.097 --> 01:32:44.180
And we'll start with question number one from online.

01:32:44.807 --> 01:32:45.427
Thanks, Phil.

01:32:45.487 --> 01:32:46.468
And thanks, everybody.

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:47.988
We're getting a lot of questions.

01:32:48.568 --> 01:32:53.170
And I'm going to try to group them by topic so we can take as many as we can.

01:32:53.190 --> 01:32:56.311
And of course, we're getting some on the autism question.

01:32:56.371 --> 01:32:57.751
So why don't I just start with that?

01:32:58.472 --> 01:33:03.193
Many people believe vaccinations are contributing to the alarming rise in autism.

01:33:03.614 --> 01:33:07.415
This is making new parents fearful of having their children vaccinated.

01:33:07.895 --> 01:33:13.397
It is so important to protect our children and population from these potentially devastating diseases.

01:33:13.857 --> 01:33:26.006
But I have to say, having children of childbearing age and knowing several people struggling with autistic children, I have a concern that the way we are manufacturing our vaccines needs to be changed.

01:33:26.326 --> 01:33:27.447
What are your thoughts on this?

01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.192
Why would that guy take it?

01:33:33.252 --> 01:33:36.594
The guy who wrote the book called The Panic Virus?

01:33:36.674 --> 01:33:38.756
Why are they laughing about it?

01:33:40.253 --> 01:33:47.736
Because it is very possible that what we're doing right now is not a very good way of augmenting anybody's immune system.

01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:55.399
And in fact, we could just be using a hammer to pound in a screw to hold in a cabinet that's gonna fall down from the wall anyway.

01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:58.451
All right, everybody else can jump in.

01:33:58.531 --> 01:34:09.115
One of the really interesting things about the vaccine autism conspiracy theories is that if you look at it, you see the goalposts have consistently been moved down the field.

01:34:09.235 --> 01:34:16.817
So initially, a big concern was thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that was in some but not all standard pediatric vaccines.

01:34:17.298 --> 01:34:19.418
And each one of those was a hamster wheel, right?

01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:21.739
Because once you start to say, oh, no, it's the mercury.

01:34:21.799 --> 01:34:22.839
Oh, no, it's the aluminum.

01:34:22.879 --> 01:34:24.200
Oh, no, it's the thimerosal.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:33.008
You are already assuming that yeah, of course these guys, you know, they already sequenced the human genome Of course, they know how to augment the immune system.

01:34:33.348 --> 01:34:38.173
It's just that they were using the wrong combination of chemicals with that You know, it's not their fault.

01:34:38.213 --> 01:34:49.984
Sometimes things work and sometimes things don't But if you can blame it on one poison or one adjuvant then you immediately have this thing where yeah But everything else was fine

01:34:51.474 --> 01:34:52.195
Stop lying!

01:34:52.655 --> 01:35:06.703
The fundamental principle of intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system has always been dumb, and that's why when that lady finished her question and they said, who's gonna answer it, they all laughed, because they know that's the damn truth.

01:35:07.124 --> 01:35:09.685
That was removed, has now been removed for a decade.

01:35:10.826 --> 01:35:12.787
The rates of autism have continued to climb.

01:35:13.288 --> 01:35:20.172
So I hear some people now saying that it wasn't really removed, that that was a conspiracy perpetrated by the vaccine manufacturers.

01:35:20.732 --> 01:35:22.875
Most people asking the wrong questions again.

01:35:22.915 --> 01:35:25.319
Did they really remove thimerosal or not?

01:35:25.339 --> 01:35:26.721
That's a conspiracy theory.

01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:27.482
You're an idiot.

01:35:28.464 --> 01:35:29.184
Don't believe that.

01:35:30.184 --> 01:35:44.568
But now you have these new other concerns that it's too many too soon, that it's too... It couldn't possibly be that number one, it's intramuscular injection of any combination of substance with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

01:35:44.988 --> 01:35:54.671
But then also the United States government and the FDA and Harvard and all these other shitheads have decided to push these things ever earlier into the childhood vaccine schedule, which is

01:35:55.171 --> 01:36:21.548
kind of more or less mandated and very very much legally protected from any liability and that that might not have any biological basis in reality that might only have to do with these manufacturers wanting to be on that schedule and wanting to be early enough so that they're going regularly to the doctor and more likely that they will get high uptake of their product because you just heard them bitch that once you start giving it to teenagers it's kind of hard to get people to bite

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:28.222
But if we could get it pushed to the childhood vaccine schedule, then we'd have guaranteed customers forever.

01:36:28.602 --> 01:36:39.427
And we wouldn't need to market to them anymore because they would be stuck in this time when, as he described it, they're too tired and they're too worn out and they're too scared to listen to any information from their doctor anyway.

01:36:39.467 --> 01:36:41.227
So if the doctor says, do it, they'll do it.

01:36:41.707 --> 01:36:42.748
Don't you hear it?

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:46.927
young, that kids' immune systems aren't prepared for this.

01:36:47.608 --> 01:37:01.459
And I think the only real answer is that every single piece of research, and I think autism, out of all the adverse reactions, has been studied more than almost any other because of the intense focus on it.

01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:07.925
Every single piece of research has indicated that there is absolutely no connection whatsoever.

01:37:10.487 --> 01:37:17.733
My personal view is that one of the reasons why there's so much anxiety about autism... They made it to their plane.

01:37:18.373 --> 01:37:23.197
They're gonna be here in a couple hours, so I'm super excited.

01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:24.198
My family's coming back.

01:37:25.939 --> 01:37:31.703
that feel very let down by their health care professionals and by the public health community.

01:37:32.344 --> 01:37:34.265
And I think that's a very real thing.

01:37:35.566 --> 01:37:39.169
And so this is something that they can react against.

01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:44.213
And then it's sort of like throwing a pebble in a pond, and those concerns just ripple out.

01:37:45.554 --> 01:37:52.279
But I think really the only answer to questions is we have a boatload of research, and it all says the same thing.

01:37:53.645 --> 01:37:57.917
And it all says the same thing, except for the stuff that's in the Green Book.

01:37:58.017 --> 01:38:00.163
Those don't say the same thing, right?

01:38:01.772 --> 01:38:15.624
The green book that Children's Health Defense doesn't sell as much as they sell is the Wuhan book, or the books of Robert Malone, or the books of Andrew Huff, or the Fauci book.

01:38:15.664 --> 01:38:22.750
They push those a lot more than they push the green book, which is called Vax Unvax, and it's written by Brian Hooker.

01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:27.634
But if you want the green book, the green book's got a lot of papers which disagree with these dipshits.

01:38:27.854 --> 01:38:32.019
So I really agree completely with what Seth said.

01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:46.515
In a way, we might have created this problem by stating that in our speed or in our desire for speed in getting parents to agree to the vaccines, I think many practitioners, myself included, will say these vaccines are safe.

01:38:47.396 --> 01:38:53.439
And that is a correct statement, but the secondary statement should also be, yes, there are some side effects.

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.421
And some of them are serious, but they're extremely rare.

01:38:57.161 --> 01:39:08.987
But because that second sentence is not often spoken or maybe not even heard, you end up with parents who hear, on the one hand, that the medical community is completely denying any association between vaccines and autism.

01:39:09.027 --> 01:39:13.590
And I think that that is, to the extent that we can, it is a proven scientific fact.

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:16.651
But at the same time, they're being told that vaccines are safe.

01:39:17.071 --> 01:39:31.874
And yet they hear of all sorts of instances where vaccines clearly could be and should be implicated, such as seizures or acute demyelinating diseases and various diseases that are very rare, but are probably causally related to vaccines.

01:39:31.974 --> 01:39:37.635
See, the problem with this is that the parents are actually well aware of how

01:39:38.855 --> 01:39:48.660
Their predisposition to assuming that vaccine injury is so rare it's almost indetectable sets them up for not attributing anything to the vaccine.

01:39:49.001 --> 01:39:50.361
And parents are aware of that.

01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:53.283
Parents have a gut feeling about what that would do.

01:39:54.653 --> 01:40:06.886
That would be like sitting across from the parent of a beautiful teenage girl who goes out every night with her friends until one in the morning and comes back with different guys in different sports cars every night.

01:40:07.367 --> 01:40:11.531
And you're sitting on the porch with those parents and they say, Oh, we trust her.

01:40:11.892 --> 01:40:16.597
She's goes out every night till one o'clock, but I'm sure she's not doing anything that we wouldn't want her to do.

01:40:19.065 --> 01:40:20.466
It's just as dumb.

01:40:20.746 --> 01:40:22.207
It's just as naive.

01:40:22.287 --> 01:40:27.469
It's just as stupid as sitting there saying that, ah, vaccines don't hurt anybody.

01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:40.415
And so you sit there listening to this doctor say this stuff, and you realize as a parent that if you believe what you say you believe, then if there was a signal, you wouldn't see it.

01:40:40.475 --> 01:40:41.316
You know that, right?

01:40:43.686 --> 01:41:04.501
that if your limited spectrum of understanding only involves seizures that are closely correlated in time with the injection, allergic reactions that are closely correlated in time with the injection, or very specific list of things that the manufacturer has provided, you are full of shit!

01:41:05.973 --> 01:41:16.239
And so the language that we use to try to convince patients to accept the vaccines that are extremely safe, but not 100% safe, may have led to some of these problems.

01:41:16.319 --> 01:41:18.500
Let's turn to the audience here.

01:41:19.141 --> 01:41:22.903
Questions from you about vaccines and hesitancy.

01:41:23.283 --> 01:41:24.324
I got something in the mail.

01:41:27.556 --> 01:41:32.157
It's a little envelope that has Scooby snacks on the outside, you'd open it up.

01:41:32.897 --> 01:41:35.198
And then out came this, which is pretty freaking cool.

01:41:35.238 --> 01:41:38.739
They know the rhyme, and it's just really cool.

01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:51.805
or a person who smokes, who doesn't smoke.

01:41:52.025 --> 01:41:54.029
Things that I can actually see in my community.

01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:58.116
That might help me understand how safe it is.

01:42:02.131 --> 01:42:23.518
So we struggle at the other end of things, which is to get a new vaccine through the incredibly thick levels of phase one trials for safety, phase two trials, larger numbers of people, for safety and showing correlates of protection, and then

01:42:24.778 --> 01:42:33.485
to take the original polio vaccine, run in 1.8 million children to see what the adverse effect ratios were.

01:42:34.345 --> 01:42:44.713
So there are very few vaccines where serious life-threatening effects that we're giving in this country are of the order of more than one.

01:42:44.733 --> 01:42:47.995
He said correlates of protection, I think, not correlates of infection.

01:42:48.035 --> 01:42:50.017
But yeah, it's all the same language.

01:42:50.057 --> 01:42:52.138
They're developing it from many, many decades.

01:42:52.158 --> 01:42:53.299
Per million children.

01:42:54.747 --> 01:43:03.271
If a kid doesn't get a sore arm from some of the vaccines, it means we're not stimulating the inflammatory response that helps get a good immune response.

01:43:03.652 --> 01:43:09.755
So kids having a sore arm and crying is not what we would call a severe adverse effect, and it may be beneficial.

01:43:10.775 --> 01:43:15.918
There are these rare cases of acute reactions that are unexplained.

01:43:16.904 --> 01:43:32.495
And there is a system called VAERS, Vaccine Adverse Effects, where every batch of every commercial vaccine is categorized such that anyone who has an adverse effect, doctor or patient,

01:43:33.035 --> 01:43:42.825
doesn't have to be proven, can be phoned in to this network, and it is investigated, and we keep score on that from all the kids that are vaccinated.

01:43:43.246 --> 01:43:48.611
So we have numbers on the number of adverse effects, severe and not so severe.

01:43:49.562 --> 01:43:54.924
I have no idea how many kids are not wearing seat belts that I could compare it with, but it's a great question.

01:43:56.045 --> 01:44:05.089
I mean, one example I sometimes use is every year there are people who are killed because they're wearing seat belts, because it ends up crushing their sternum.

01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:11.852
And yet, I don't think anyone would say, well, because of this infinitesimal percent, I'm not going to wear a seat belt anymore.

01:44:13.133 --> 01:44:22.779
Or another thing, I sometimes tell parents is you're more likely to get in a car accident on the way to your doctor's appointment than you are for your child to have an adverse effect.

01:44:22.839 --> 01:44:29.844
Because I think you're right, one in a million is sort of meaningless when a parent is trying to think of that, so.

01:44:30.865 --> 01:44:32.246
Other questions from the audience?

01:44:33.007 --> 01:44:33.327
Down here.

01:44:35.817 --> 01:44:36.397
Hi, thank you.

01:44:36.658 --> 01:44:37.138
My name is Vicky.

01:44:37.158 --> 01:44:39.940
I'm a fourth year medical student and an MPH student here at Harvard.

01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:49.546
When you mentioned the latest vaccine conspiracy theories, I was reminded of an article that was shared recently with me by a member of the non-medical community.

01:44:50.787 --> 01:45:00.133
One of the latest conspiracy theories, which was that the CDC has covered up reports that there was a 300 times greater risk of autism developing in African-American boys.

01:45:00.974 --> 01:45:03.155
Oh, it's the Brian Hooker study.

01:45:03.195 --> 01:45:04.676
It's not 300 times.

01:45:04.736 --> 01:45:05.437
It was only like

01:45:06.581 --> 01:45:08.248
30 times or 3 times.

01:45:08.951 --> 01:45:09.654
I think it was 3 times.

01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:17.433
And so she's already full of shit and she's already spinning in the hamster wheel and it's already right where we are in 2014.

01:45:17.913 --> 01:45:18.994
Do you see it?

01:45:19.594 --> 01:45:20.515
Do you see it now?

01:45:20.535 --> 01:45:23.337
As opposed to the general population from MMR vaccines.

01:45:24.337 --> 01:45:40.568
And even though we might be able to critique the scientific validity of what or whatever of these results, how can we be sensitive to the concerns of communities that have historically been marginalized and have historically had a relationship of mistrust with the medical community?

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:45.276
Rick.

01:45:45.356 --> 01:45:46.176
Laughing again.

01:45:46.496 --> 01:45:47.256
Oh my gosh.

01:45:47.316 --> 01:45:47.676
Laughing.

01:45:47.716 --> 01:45:48.896
It's so freaking funny.

01:45:48.916 --> 01:45:49.956
It's an excellent question.

01:45:50.217 --> 01:45:53.597
I think, uh, I don't think there's an easy answer to this one.

01:45:53.757 --> 01:45:56.118
So did the CDC cover it up or not?

01:45:58.818 --> 01:45:59.818
Of course they did.

01:46:00.298 --> 01:46:01.419
They had a whistleblower.

01:46:01.459 --> 01:46:02.399
We know his name.

01:46:02.459 --> 01:46:03.519
We saw the data.

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.360
He was recorded on a phone call.

01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:14.390
Brian Hooker drove all across the United States to meet with him personally to get the data.

01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:16.870
They covered it up.

01:46:17.210 --> 01:46:22.232
They took the racial data out of the report in order that that would not be found.

01:46:23.352 --> 01:46:24.452
And they're just laughing?

01:46:24.472 --> 01:46:26.632
They're not going to acknowledge that that occurred?

01:46:29.733 --> 01:46:31.713
Do you see where we are, ladies and gentlemen?

01:46:31.733 --> 01:46:38.775
This has been going on for a lot longer than 2020 when Rand Paul and Tony Fauci argued in front of the Senate to cover up the Scooby-Doo.

01:46:40.643 --> 01:46:44.906
The Scooby-Doo is part of this right here.

01:46:45.367 --> 01:47:08.064
This, when this didn't work, when this kind of shit doesn't work, you pull something like the Scooby-Doo, where you tell people that there's a pandemic, you murder people and lie about it in order to make sure that this childhood vaccine schedule never finds the scrutiny it needs in order to be exposed as the criminal enterprise that it is.

01:47:13.257 --> 01:47:18.123
This was a September 15, 2014 forum at the University of Harvard.

01:47:18.643 --> 01:47:28.895
We need a new consensus about transfection in healthy humans being always criminally negligent, RNA not being able to pandemic, and the vaccine schedule in the USA was a criminal enterprise before the pandemic.

01:47:29.435 --> 01:47:34.400

This is a family of five who's sacrificing everything to try and get this over the finish line.

01:47:40.365 --> 01:47:42.447
Not for me, but for my kids and yours.

01:47:43.308 --> 01:47:45.870
If you want to talk to us, go to gigaohm.bio, which is

01:47:48.993 --> 01:47:50.974
Get my mouse over there, which is the second link.

01:47:51.354 --> 01:47:57.196
And then if you want to share this after broadcast, please share the links at stream.gigaom.bio because that's what we pay for.

01:47:58.276 --> 01:48:00.357
And again, I hope to see you tomorrow.

01:48:00.377 --> 01:48:01.358
My family's coming back.

01:48:01.418 --> 01:48:02.198
I'm really excited.

01:48:02.658 --> 01:48:07.100
I think I'll be up very early and very happy to hit the button for a long time to come.

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.802
This has been a long ride on the Ark all by myself with Ruby, but we made it.

01:48:12.122 --> 01:48:16.023
And I'm very happy to say that I didn't lose a leg or anything like that.

01:48:16.743 --> 01:48:17.644
Thank you very much for coming.

01:48:17.684 --> 01:48:18.364
I'll see you again tomorrow.

01:48:28.732 --> 01:48:38.339
I'm going to film the dog's reaction to the car pulling up so I can share it with you because Ruby is going to go bananas.

01:48:39.259 --> 01:48:49.466
And for a very brief period of time, she's going to exhibit the spinnies of a small puppy dog because she gets so happy to see her mama.

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:52.833
Thanks very much for all the support, all the letters.

01:48:53.674 --> 01:48:55.236
Cindy, thank you.

01:48:56.798 --> 01:48:59.561
Rocky, thank you.

01:49:00.883 --> 01:49:04.388
Rocky, maybe send me an email if you don't mind and you hear this.

01:49:06.937 --> 01:49:09.618
And I will follow you later today, Zard.

01:49:10.199 --> 01:49:12.840
Sorry, I've just been checking in really quick over there.

01:49:13.401 --> 01:49:14.421
I'll definitely follow you.

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:16.502
Don't worry, I'm there.

01:49:17.062 --> 01:49:21.405
Just trying to get into a groove of daily broadcasting before 11.11.

01:49:21.685 --> 01:49:24.807
So I'm gonna try and start hitting the window.

01:49:25.527 --> 01:49:28.489
Always trying for 10.10, but a lot of times I miss 10.10.

01:49:30.535 --> 01:49:34.743
But if I'm not on time at 10.10, I'm going to try to hit the button before 11.11.

01:49:36.046 --> 01:49:36.988
And the latest will be 11.11.

01:49:37.108 --> 01:49:41.476
So I'm going to try and make this a thing.

01:49:42.648 --> 01:49:53.193
It's kind of the least I can do for the supporters that are supporting me and try to provide a little regular appearance that you can try to book or be aware of.

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:57.174
And then maybe we can add a Friday fire tonight.

01:49:57.194 --> 01:50:10.140
We're gonna fire up the fireplace, put a camera on it and just hang out and watch the chat, talk to one another, maybe enjoy a little sounds of kids on the trampoline and maybe a glass of wine.

01:50:11.902 --> 01:50:12.664
or a beer for me.

01:50:13.666 --> 01:50:14.568
Thanks very much guys.

01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:15.110
I'll see you later.
