02:25.040 --> 02:26.560

02:26.560 --> 02:55.560
I'd love you to find that video of him explaining that on Jimmy Doar.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.560
That would be interesting.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.560
I'd appreciate that.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.560
It tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst-case scenario.

03:08.560 --> 03:19.560
Again, you know, I'm having to go down this pathway because of curie-isms and, you know, his lack of imagination.

03:19.560 --> 03:27.560
I'm wearing the masks when I'm required to.

03:27.560 --> 03:32.560
So, that's the best I can do with that.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.560
I have no particular insight with regards to this pandemic.

03:49.560 --> 04:06.560
See, if you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally and these COVID vaccines or vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine. Okay.

04:06.560 --> 04:17.560
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines and, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada saying nine months.

04:17.560 --> 04:29.560
Uh, is as actually JJ Coe's insistence and I think he's right on calling them transfections rather than the vaccines.

04:29.560 --> 04:37.560
I'm not sure exactly who he is. His name is JJ Coe, and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.

04:37.560 --> 04:48.560
And I believe he has a PhD in some sort of scientific discipline from what I understand.

04:48.560 --> 04:58.560
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.560
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

05:01.560 --> 05:07.560
It's embarrassing.

05:07.560 --> 05:14.560
Early, but I want his high morbidity. I want people to complain. So what do I do? I go to Des Moines.

05:14.560 --> 05:21.560
Ladies and gentlemen, people on the screen, I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years. I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of sentinel cases in Des Moines.

05:21.560 --> 05:36.560
I go to Seattle. I infect a couple of cases there. I go to North Carolina. I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.560
These individuals complain. Again, this is a central nervous system condition. So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do.

05:42.560 --> 05:47.560
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.560
And then what I do, the real bug that I use is the internet.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.560
I take attribution for that. Yes, I'm a terrorist group.

05:55.560 --> 06:02.560
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent, and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are X, Y, and Z.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.560
These people are really sick with this.

06:04.560 --> 06:16.560
But then I say, others who are also infected will show subdramal, pre-dramal signs of lethality, and what that will be is anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation.

06:16.560 --> 06:26.560
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal, and I've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door.

06:26.560 --> 06:33.560
The CDC comes back and says, nonsense. That's not real. I come back and say, that's fake news.

06:33.560 --> 06:40.560
And as a consequence of doing that, what I do is I create a schism between the polis and the public health system.

06:40.560 --> 06:47.560
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.560
I'm not going to do that.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
I'm not going to do that.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:36.560 --> 07:37.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.560
I'm not going to do that.

07:44.560 --> 07:55.560
I am not going to do that.

07:55.560 --> 08:03.560
While we all had explained this.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.560
While we started to understand

08:05.560 --> 08:06.560
passing the city of the A's

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
one side to the gate.

08:08.560 --> 08:31.760
You don't understand, Mr. Grant, the bomb's a holy weapon of peace.

08:31.760 --> 08:41.760
You don't understand, Mr. Grant, the bomb's a holy weapon of peace.

09:01.760 --> 09:19.760
It's a pretty hard thing to say five times in a row, diagnostically hypochondriagal.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.760
It's a pretty good one.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.760
He's an absolute master or a raider.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.760
Thanks very much for joining me everybody.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.760
I got everything going in just one second here.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
There's a few more slides to run through.

09:32.760 --> 09:36.760
I've got a few more things to set up.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.760
It's a patch climber.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.760
It's a news brief for you.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.760
That's where the high resistance load noise comes from.

09:44.760 --> 09:56.760
And you can find me and go on biological.com.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.760
I'm not really sure it's a depopulation agenda.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.760
I don't really think they want us all dead.

10:02.760 --> 10:07.760
They want to get everybody that they can onto a new system.

10:07.760 --> 10:17.760
They need to take advantage of the amount of potential experiments to be had.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.760
The amount of potential experiments to be done.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.760
I really think they need to take advantage of that.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.760
I don't think... I mean, you know, I don't know though.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.760
I wish I knew.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.760
But I think it's more of one than the other, although I do agree.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.760
There's plenty of lawns to be mowed, so to speak.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.760
Plenty of lawns to be mowed.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.760
So yeah.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.760
Modified RNA and everything will kill.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.760
Next five years.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.760
Here we go. It's a pretty good prediction.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.760
We don't have long to wait anymore.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.760
Five years is practically no time for me.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.760
Because we've already been doing this for four years.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.760
Four years. Can you believe it?

11:07.760 --> 11:14.760
I can't believe it was four years ago that I rode my bike.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.760
You know, like, think about that.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.760
That's a...

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
It doesn't seem like that long ago.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.760
I got a different house.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.760
I was renting to own.

11:24.760 --> 11:29.760
I was hoping to live in that house for, like, ever.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.760
And then this happened.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.760
Wow.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.760
And then this happened.

11:36.760 --> 11:44.760
Yikes.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.760
And then this happened.

11:48.760 --> 11:53.760
Now we're in 2024 with this same illusion of consensus.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.760
Somebody stole that name and put it on a blog.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.760
I don't know if they stole the name.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.760
You

12:47.760 --> 12:50.760
You

13:17.760 --> 13:20.760
You

13:47.760 --> 13:49.760
You

14:17.760 --> 14:19.760
You

14:47.760 --> 14:49.760
You

15:17.760 --> 15:20.760
You

15:48.760 --> 15:49.760
You

15:49.760 --> 15:50.760
You

16:18.760 --> 16:19.760
You

16:19.760 --> 16:20.760
You

16:48.760 --> 16:49.760
You

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
You

17:17.760 --> 17:19.760
You

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
You

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
You

17:21.760 --> 17:23.760
You

17:23.760 --> 17:25.760
You

17:25.760 --> 17:26.760
You

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
You

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
You

17:28.760 --> 17:29.760
You

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
You

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
That

17:31.760 --> 17:32.760
That

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Subs

17:33.760 --> 17:43.020
The

17:43.020 --> 17:43.060
You

17:43.060 --> 17:47.060
You

17:47.060 --> 17:55.660
It's not even January of 2020 you've already accepted all of this stuff before you know it. It's March of 2020. They're already talking about variants and

17:56.460 --> 18:01.060
Before you know it. There's people like Brett Weinstein or whispering about gain of function and

18:02.060 --> 18:07.580
Pretty soon before you know it ran Paul and Tony Fauci are arguing in front of the Senate about gain of function and

18:08.140 --> 18:10.140
the faith in the novel virus

18:11.420 --> 18:13.420
Has you in its grips

18:14.420 --> 18:17.420
Just because you stayed home and watched some TV and

18:18.980 --> 18:24.660
From the very beginning ladies and gentlemen, I was sitting outside of my should have been house

18:27.540 --> 18:29.700
With the woods behind me in a fire

18:30.940 --> 18:32.980
Saying that biology was the way out

18:33.940 --> 18:42.380
Now I hadn't at that time in 2020 gotten so sophisticated as to understand that at the heart of this is the vaccine schedule

18:43.420 --> 18:47.740
at the heart of this is the intellectual property and and

18:48.580 --> 18:54.060
legal indemnification of vaccines all in the middle of this this

18:55.260 --> 18:57.260
pile of motivation is

18:57.780 --> 18:59.780
The childhood vaccine schedule

19:02.860 --> 19:07.300
And we should be taking it down we should be putting calling for a pause because

19:07.500 --> 19:11.940
That language is very crafty because it seems like you're not really

19:12.580 --> 19:15.940
Actually asking for anybody to stop. We're just asking for you to pause

19:16.940 --> 19:20.220
And so you might see it as clever you might see it as weak

19:20.220 --> 19:26.540
I don't know. I think it's kind of clever in the sense of you know, it doesn't scare everybody doesn't sound quite so coarse

19:26.540 --> 19:28.540
But it has the same effect

19:29.620 --> 19:36.780
Strict liability for all pharmaceutical products again, this is language we should be using but not very many people are

19:37.300 --> 19:39.500
I would say actually none are using it

19:41.260 --> 19:49.420
Investigate the use of deadly protocols, you know, I investigate the illusion of a pandemic and this is all very basic to explain now

19:50.260 --> 19:53.980
Reclaiming our sovereignty and Congress needs to end the CDC

19:55.860 --> 20:04.260
We've also kind of talked about how the pandemic was created because they had scientific programs that no matter what papers came out of those

20:04.340 --> 20:09.460
Scientific programs they were going to end up with papers that said well pandemic potential seems to be here

20:10.020 --> 20:12.020
It looks like we found some

20:12.820 --> 20:15.260
If you give us more money, we'll find even more

20:17.260 --> 20:23.340
And also through the tabletop exercises and finally at the start of the pandemic

20:23.340 --> 20:28.660
It was so important for them to have podcasters and intellectual dark web members and also

20:29.300 --> 20:31.420
freelancers

20:31.460 --> 20:37.380
Private contractors out there ready to step in to control the narrative at news

20:38.620 --> 20:43.820
Agencies at school boards at all these places

20:45.180 --> 20:53.220
Anywhere they thought that they needed to really really be sure that this municipality stayed on narrative

20:53.220 --> 20:58.700
They had somebody there. I can guarantee it. This was a national security priority

20:58.700 --> 21:00.700
And

21:00.740 --> 21:05.380
So this team of worst-case scenario people were there and also co-opted

21:06.260 --> 21:11.140
part of the actual script might have been to wait and see who shows up and

21:11.980 --> 21:18.540
When we say on the TV that we have this mass casualty event in New York City, we expect some people to run into the fire

21:19.060 --> 21:24.620
And when those people come in we're going to catch them as they come in early and we're going to explain what's going on

21:24.860 --> 21:28.980
And they're either going to choose to participate or they're going to go home and be quiet

21:33.980 --> 21:39.260
And that's why making the response to the declared crisis and national security operation

21:39.740 --> 21:44.940
allows them to restrict those people and how they talk about the narrative and

21:46.620 --> 21:51.020
So finally then the narrative over the last two or three years

21:51.580 --> 21:53.660
Has really

21:53.660 --> 21:55.660
dovetailed perfectly into

21:55.980 --> 21:57.580
being able to

21:57.580 --> 22:01.140
Confound while it's the virus and oh, it's the spike. No, no, it's

22:01.460 --> 22:03.460
Transfection. Oh, no, it's the

22:03.460 --> 22:08.340
Transfection of the spike. No, we don't use the word transfection. It's the vaccine that makes you make the spike

22:14.060 --> 22:19.020
And so the magic spell really has been cast it is really here now and

22:19.540 --> 22:24.780
On our Christmas tree and our neighbors have been thinking that this is exactly what happened. Oh

22:27.100 --> 22:30.460
My gosh New Year's Eve was depressing. It was the most artificial

22:32.380 --> 22:35.780
The most artificial expression of that holiday ever

22:37.540 --> 22:42.820
Was painful and really what that's what this that's what this is this

22:43.700 --> 22:52.380
Faith here is this limited spectrum of debate as long as you don't question seven million people died as long as you don't question that

22:52.820 --> 22:57.220
a lot a lot of people were probably saved by all the things that we did I

22:58.660 --> 23:01.020
Mean we might have killed some people in the beginning

23:01.020 --> 23:06.940
But you know that was just because we were making big mistakes or we were Russian stuff or we didn't know how to use ventilators at that time

23:06.940 --> 23:15.340
But these people have given us the sense that there's free thinking going on that there is push back

23:15.740 --> 23:24.460
Happening and there was no push back happening the push back that we saw on television was largely orchestrated or co-opted

23:25.380 --> 23:31.740
The people that pushed back in the beginning were often co-opted and if they would not allow themselves to be co-opted

23:32.820 --> 23:34.820
They were silenced

23:37.420 --> 23:43.580
And so not only did we stalked about how the pandemic was created, but sorry this hat makes my head itchy

23:43.580 --> 23:49.740
But it's cold in here. We've also talked about why the pandemic was created and I think it was created for some practical reasons

23:49.740 --> 23:50.540
I

23:50.540 --> 23:58.020
Think Michael Eden thinks that it was created for some practical reasons reasons that include a really nice easy way to change

23:58.020 --> 24:00.580
To a digital currency a good excuse to do it

24:01.580 --> 24:08.220
A huge transfer of wealth as they transfer us or as they transition us into a digital ID world

24:08.220 --> 24:14.060
And they will probably use a cyber event or privacy invasion on the internet or

24:14.540 --> 24:15.500
stolen

24:15.500 --> 24:22.420
Identities on the internet to say that people have to have a a blockchain type, you know ID for the internet

24:23.620 --> 24:28.060
And places like Twitch will probably be one of the first places they do it

24:28.060 --> 24:31.260
So then we'll move to peer to by then hopefully

24:32.740 --> 24:37.780
The transition to a digital currency will happen the exact same way maybe with the universal income

24:38.660 --> 24:40.660
Proposals that are all coming out

24:41.340 --> 24:45.780
If you don't want a digital ID, you don't have to have a digital ID if you don't want to have a

24:46.540 --> 24:52.900
Use the digital currency. You don't have to do that. But if you take a digital ID, we'll give you free digital currency now. That's a

24:53.860 --> 24:55.620
That's a whoo

24:55.660 --> 24:58.700
That's a tempting one. I like steak, too

25:01.220 --> 25:02.440
So

25:02.440 --> 25:06.300
Transitioning youth into this is really what they want. They don't care about us old fogies

25:06.300 --> 25:10.740
They don't care about us people over 50 years old. They care about you young people

25:11.380 --> 25:16.300
You people that are still thinking about having kids you people that are still too young to have kids

25:17.500 --> 25:24.940
They're thinking about how to change your mind about where your freedom lies in this in this grand scheme of plan and

25:25.180 --> 25:29.300
This might disrupt family formation and for a generation. They don't mind that

25:30.500 --> 25:36.660
Might destroy the cultural fabric of America. They don't mind that the rest of the West. They don't mind that Europe. They don't mind that

25:40.500 --> 25:46.020
Because that fundamental chaos is what is required for them to reorganize the world whatever the way they're trying to do it

25:46.020 --> 25:49.900
I don't know if there's multiple I guess there are multiple forces at play here, but

25:50.580 --> 25:55.620
Honestly, I don't I don't I don't have the sophistication to make a great big, you know

25:56.140 --> 26:00.900
Map of with all kinds of symbols on it that shows you who's connected to who and stuff like that

26:00.900 --> 26:05.500
I just know how people behave and I know when people lie to my face and

26:06.980 --> 26:12.100
That's why I show that picture in the beginning where Christmas I've met all those people safe

26:13.180 --> 26:15.180
Reporter asked me at the last

26:16.180 --> 26:20.260
This is a guy speaking in the third of December

26:21.500 --> 26:28.140
2020 in Manitoba I understand I totally do I am the guy who has told you that you cannot shop I

26:30.260 --> 26:35.500
Am the person who has come forward here in front of you 75 times and

26:36.180 --> 26:40.940
Has asked you to do things you've never done before and has asked you to do that every day

26:41.940 --> 26:47.620
You got to kind of remember that these people were asking us to do this stuff already for a year

26:48.380 --> 26:51.740
After the first Christmas in 2020 and now we're at

26:52.420 --> 26:58.780
2024 Christmases later. They're still doing this stuff. They're still talking this story and

26:59.980 --> 27:07.360
As the past the lie becomes the truth, you know, we got to be very careful here

27:10.940 --> 27:12.940
I don't like saying

27:14.420 --> 27:18.060
But it's got to be said someone has to say it and

27:18.660 --> 27:22.500
So I'm the one that took on this job to say it

27:24.220 --> 27:29.260
When I was 14 years old I lived with my grandparents and I was late for school one day and

27:30.700 --> 27:37.620
The principal was an ex military guy and Bill Taylor and he he met me at the door and he looked up at me

27:37.620 --> 27:41.780
Because it was pretty gangly kid and he said something always remember

27:43.580 --> 27:47.340
He gave me heck and then he looked at me and I guess I frowned or scowled or something

27:47.340 --> 27:53.500
So he's trying to make the argument of course that he was forced to do it and we'll appreciate him doing it after this

27:53.860 --> 27:59.180
And he's gonna start crying a little bit and stuff to really convince you that he feels bad about it

28:02.780 --> 28:06.740
But this is a national security thing it was

28:08.020 --> 28:11.420
A super large high mega priority

28:13.140 --> 28:15.140
To get everybody on board

28:15.580 --> 28:20.100
No holds barred say what you got to say do your best there buddy

28:23.100 --> 28:25.100
Seats on the bus are limited

28:26.940 --> 28:28.940
This is who you need right now I

28:30.460 --> 28:32.460
Am that person I?

28:32.780 --> 28:38.620
Will do what I believe is right and right now we need to save lives

28:40.900 --> 28:46.900
If you don't think that COVID's real right now you're an idiot you need to understand

28:47.700 --> 28:52.860
That we're all in this together. You cannot Wow fail to understand this Wow

28:53.260 --> 28:55.260
Stay apart

28:55.980 --> 29:02.300
So I'm the guy who has to tell you to stay apart at Christmas and in the holiday season you celebrate

29:02.460 --> 29:08.620
With your faith or without your faith that you celebrate with normally with friends and with family that where you share

29:09.300 --> 29:12.740
Memories and build memories. I'm that guy

29:14.260 --> 29:16.260
And I'll say that

29:18.180 --> 29:20.180
Because it will keep you safe

29:23.340 --> 29:27.540
He's gonna cry the guy who's stealing Christmas to keep you safe

29:28.140 --> 29:32.660
Because you need to do this now you need to do the right thing

29:33.300 --> 29:40.220
Because next year we'll have lots to celebrate and we'll celebrate this year if we do the right thing this year

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
You don't need to like me. I

29:44.180 --> 29:50.660
Hope in years to come you might respect me for having the guts to tell you the right thing and here's the right thing

29:51.060 --> 29:53.060
Wow stay safe

29:53.260 --> 29:57.420
Protect each other love each other care for each other. You got so many ways to show that

29:59.740 --> 30:04.420
Early but I want is high morbidity so I play this in the beginning so what do I do?

30:04.420 --> 30:09.540
I go to Des Moines ladies and gentlemen of people on the screen. I have nothing against Des Moines. I live there for four years

30:09.540 --> 30:15.060
I go to Des Moines. I infect a couple of Sentinel cases in Des Moines. I go to Seattle

30:15.060 --> 30:19.460
I infect a couple of cases there. I go to North Carolina

30:19.460 --> 30:27.780
I go to Wisconsin. What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect Sentinel cases with a highly morbid

30:27.900 --> 30:31.940
Condition these individuals complain again. This is a central nervous system condition

30:31.940 --> 30:35.500
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do it'll produce some

30:35.860 --> 30:42.580
Cascative neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms and then what I do the real bug that I use

30:43.060 --> 30:49.420
Is the internet I take attribution for that? Yes, I'm a terrorist group and I have done this by infecting

30:49.460 --> 30:54.420
With a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x y and z

30:54.820 --> 31:00.420
O2 North Carolina now. I want you to listen to how he describes the symptoms of the

31:01.300 --> 31:05.860
of the disease and how they overlay on the population and then I want you to think about

31:06.820 --> 31:12.500
the idea that the biosecurity state would like to shift our

31:13.460 --> 31:14.980
our

31:14.980 --> 31:19.380
Vaccine schedule to a genetic based technology a

31:20.180 --> 31:25.460
Biologics based technology or you might want to call it pro biologic because they're going to inject

31:26.180 --> 31:28.180
lipid nanoparticles or they're going to

31:28.740 --> 31:35.700
Electrapyrate you or they're going to make you inhale RNA or they're going to do all kinds of stuff but always with nucleic acids with the intent of

31:35.940 --> 31:37.540
Transfecting you

31:37.700 --> 31:41.780
Maybe DNA, but mostly RNA. I think and that whole shift

31:42.820 --> 31:47.060
Will change the intellectual property space of all biologics

31:48.180 --> 31:53.220
It will change the production and how all this is done with all these biologics

31:53.300 --> 32:00.020
And in fact, they've used this money that they've given out of the last four years already to shift a lot of this production in that direction

32:00.020 --> 32:04.580
As far as I understand or at least buttress what was there with more

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
and

32:07.460 --> 32:10.420
So knowing that they're going to make this genetic shift

32:10.500 --> 32:18.820
And I think one of the the people that's been most influential in my thinking about this has been Mark Koolack of Mark Housatonic

32:19.460 --> 32:21.460
ITS

32:23.700 --> 32:27.220
Is that if they're going to shift to this various tech

32:29.380 --> 32:32.820
Various transfection technologies, they're going to need to

32:35.140 --> 32:40.420
Hedge their bets or or or I don't have the right the right turn of phrase there

32:41.700 --> 32:44.740
But but in order for them to cover their

32:47.940 --> 32:54.180
Expect and they have the opportunity rather to cover the expected adverse effects of

32:54.820 --> 32:56.820
Transfection and those are not unknown

32:59.220 --> 33:03.460
Now they might not necessarily be widely published, but they're definitely not unknown

33:04.820 --> 33:06.820
And so having

33:07.940 --> 33:14.020
Done any experiments at all they might already know that okay, it's going to be this this this and this and in fact people have shown

33:14.500 --> 33:18.580
Various patents for the lipid nanoparticles various patents for the RNA

33:19.140 --> 33:26.180
With all of these side effects and and some of these documents from some of these commercial products are also

33:26.980 --> 33:29.220
Showing a whole list of these side effects

33:30.100 --> 33:37.300
Many of which were preemptively seeded in the narrative of the novel virus

33:38.420 --> 33:41.540
Now there's multiple ways that could be done that could be done with

33:43.620 --> 33:49.940
A toxin that produces things that you think that transfection will do it could be done by transfection

33:49.940 --> 33:53.220
It could be we don't need to figure it out because we're not the detectives

33:54.580 --> 33:56.580
We are just calling it a crime

33:57.460 --> 34:01.940
Once we call it a crime then we'll investigate all that stuff and we'll figure it all out

34:01.940 --> 34:06.740
But for right now, it's important just to see that he's going to describe a disease with it

34:06.740 --> 34:12.020
It's a neuropsychiatric disease or a neurological disease with those disorders

34:12.500 --> 34:15.620
But it wouldn't necessarily have to be that if we thought that it was going to be

34:16.260 --> 34:19.620
strokes and and clotting and

34:20.580 --> 34:22.580
Myocarditis or other

34:22.580 --> 34:28.180
Cardiac problems, then we would just see that in the narrative of the pandemic before we rolled out the

34:28.480 --> 34:32.420
Transfection for the pandemic and if we did it right

34:32.900 --> 34:39.460
We would seed it with the actual spike protein that we're getting the the the target that we're going to

34:40.020 --> 34:42.020
Focus our transfection on

34:43.060 --> 34:47.460
So that in everybody's mind you wouldn't even need to be a scientist to understand that

34:47.860 --> 34:53.540
Sounds like the spike protein from the virus is the same spike protein they put in that MRNA

34:54.260 --> 35:00.260
So when you make the protein from the MRNA, it's the same protein as in the virus. So that ain't very smart

35:01.780 --> 35:05.060
And everybody thinks that that this is just some kind of rushed

35:06.020 --> 35:11.540
Boy, these guys aren't very smart. Are they man? Oh man, even I can figure that out and there you have it

35:11.540 --> 35:17.620
And so while Giordano is kind of explaining how you would use a toxin

35:18.260 --> 35:23.060
To create the illusion of spread and the panic associated with it

35:24.180 --> 35:28.340
I want you to understand how another layer on top of this could be

35:29.380 --> 35:37.700
Not only to use that psychological panic to generate the illusion of a pandemic with a couple mass casualty events, but

35:38.100 --> 35:39.860
to

35:39.860 --> 35:42.020
set up the psychological confound

35:43.540 --> 35:45.540
confound of

35:45.940 --> 35:46.820
the

35:46.820 --> 35:49.700
effects of a protein on the virus versus the

35:50.100 --> 35:52.980
Transfection of that protein and that is still ongoing

35:53.780 --> 35:57.460
People are still selling supplements to detox from the spike protein

35:57.940 --> 36:01.460
People are still talking about how the spike protein has had cardiac effects

36:01.860 --> 36:06.500
People are still talking about how the spike protein can cause amyloidosis

36:06.580 --> 36:08.580
But sometimes it's the end protein too

36:14.420 --> 36:19.220
And so we've got to wake up ladies and gentlemen because we have definitely been fooled

36:20.100 --> 36:21.620
on purpose

36:21.620 --> 36:23.300
intentionally

36:23.300 --> 36:24.740
with

36:24.740 --> 36:26.580
with the idea of

36:26.580 --> 36:32.180
And trapping our children have give them getting on that train because adults pushed him on the train

36:32.820 --> 36:38.020
Because the adults indoctrinated them into this Santa Claus if we believe it they'll believe it

36:39.380 --> 36:43.860
If we don't actively speak up and correct it for our children and say no

36:44.900 --> 36:46.900
That's not what happened

36:47.060 --> 36:51.700
And we need to reorganize and reorient because that's not what happened

36:53.940 --> 36:58.500
They murdered people in America and a few other places and then said that was spread

36:59.380 --> 37:04.420
And they most likely confounded PCR testing with a background

37:05.220 --> 37:08.580
Made it seem like that was indicative of indicative of spread

37:09.220 --> 37:11.460
Listen to the rest of Giordano and then we'll move on

37:14.820 --> 37:16.820
I go to Wisconsin

37:16.820 --> 37:23.700
What I'm doing is I'm using a dispersion methodology to be able to infect sentinel cases with a highly morbid condition

37:24.020 --> 37:27.300
These individuals complain again. This is a central nervous system condition

37:27.380 --> 37:29.380
So they're complaining of whatever the bug may do

37:30.020 --> 37:34.900
It'll produce some cascade of neurological and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms

37:35.460 --> 37:38.020
And then what I do the real bug that I use

37:38.740 --> 37:40.100
Is the internet

37:40.100 --> 37:42.660
I take attribution for that. Yes. I'm a terrorist group

37:43.300 --> 37:49.780
And I have done this by infecting with a highly little agent and the first signs and symptoms of lethality are x y and z

37:50.100 --> 37:52.100
These people are really sick with this

37:52.100 --> 37:56.020
But then I say others who are also infected will show subdramal

37:56.340 --> 38:00.580
Pre-dram signs of lethality and what that will be is anxiety

38:01.380 --> 38:02.900
Sleeplessness

38:02.900 --> 38:04.340
agitation

38:04.340 --> 38:08.660
What I've now done is I've got every individual who is diagnostically hypochondriacal

38:08.820 --> 38:13.540
And I've got every individual who's the worried well flooding the public health system banging on the door

38:14.100 --> 38:20.580
The cdc comes back and says nonsense. That's not real. I come back and say that's fake news

38:21.540 --> 38:24.580
And as a consequence of doing that what I do is I create a schism

38:24.980 --> 38:27.380
Between the polis and the public health system

38:27.940 --> 38:33.780
I fracture the integrity of trust and reliance upon the population and its government

38:41.140 --> 38:48.580
So that's the bottom part there right to help create the chaos necessary for a fundamental reorganization of how the world is governed

38:48.580 --> 38:54.020
I do really think that that is probably in there as part of this digital ID digital currency

38:58.500 --> 39:04.260
I'm not really sure what to do about it other than to try very very hard not to enlist ourselves in it

39:06.260 --> 39:08.580
But i'm afraid it may take a lot more than that

39:09.860 --> 39:13.300
It may take people on our side running for office

39:14.260 --> 39:19.860
It may take hundreds of us running for office so that we can take back whole state legislatures

39:20.580 --> 39:22.580
in order to really

39:23.300 --> 39:25.300
Turn this ship around

39:25.380 --> 39:27.380
there are a lot of

39:27.380 --> 39:30.180
bridges so to speak that need to be remand

39:31.780 --> 39:33.780
And uh

39:33.780 --> 39:39.620
It's a lot of work that needs to be done because they have had this obviously planned for some time

39:40.500 --> 39:42.100
It we're in

39:42.100 --> 39:46.820
2024 ladies and gentlemen, there's no there's no if ands or buts about it anymore

39:47.700 --> 39:52.020
If you look backwards and you see nothing but perfect tracks, I mean what what

39:57.940 --> 40:00.020
And so it's the spread of these bad ideas

40:00.020 --> 40:08.420
It's the cultivating of these bad ideas and it is the dissemination of these bad ideas by algorithm and by mainstream media social media

40:09.220 --> 40:13.940
We don't even know if the number of people that it says watch my videos even see them

40:14.580 --> 40:16.580
It could be a fraction of that

40:19.940 --> 40:26.900
On the other hand it could be thousands more than that and it could always just report 2,000 people see my videos in three days

40:27.620 --> 40:32.580
And it's never more than that and it's never more than that. It's always the same number every day

40:33.460 --> 40:37.780
And they could be under reporting it by 20,000. How would you or I or anyone else know?

40:39.380 --> 40:45.620
If they don't show us the twitter in the same way and they don't show us the facebook in the same way or the other things in the same way

40:45.620 --> 40:47.620
Then how would we ever know?

40:48.580 --> 40:50.580
It's just one dial

40:50.580 --> 40:52.580
You

41:02.980 --> 41:09.060
We have been fooled into believing that this worst case scenario is real and i'm so sure this is the way it breaks

41:10.340 --> 41:17.860
I'm so sure that this is the way we break this this is the mythology. This is the weak spot right here this gain of function crap

41:18.740 --> 41:20.740
This is the weak spot

41:23.620 --> 41:27.140
Because it may be the only way to find i'm not

41:28.100 --> 41:33.380
These virus people are going to say that i'm trying to resurrect the idea of a virus and i'm not

41:34.820 --> 41:36.820
I'm trying to

41:37.860 --> 41:41.540
Be as parsimonious as possible with all the previous observations

41:43.380 --> 41:45.540
And

41:45.620 --> 41:49.700
Not yet because of my lack of sophistication can i rule out

41:50.660 --> 41:54.580
The possibility of genetic noise at this size scale

41:56.740 --> 42:01.060
But i'm sure that they're telling us stories about high fidelity

42:01.620 --> 42:06.340
RNA molecules coded in lipids that can go around the world for four years

42:07.060 --> 42:14.340
And kill seven million people and infect millions more and justify the spending of trillions of dollars in the crashing of

42:14.420 --> 42:19.860
economies and blah blah blah no way possible unless the goal was right there

42:23.460 --> 42:26.020
To coerce a surrender of individual sovereignty

42:27.620 --> 42:33.540
And a global fundamental inversion of human rights from freedom to fascism. That's what they're doing to our children

42:34.340 --> 42:37.460
With this mythology we cannot let them imbibe it

42:40.740 --> 42:42.740
So these are like

42:43.300 --> 42:50.580
Historical documents about what was said and how the mythology was laid down there historical documents which really

42:54.420 --> 42:56.420
They really document a false narrative

42:57.540 --> 43:03.540
From all different angles from all different sides. I mean look at how how uniform

43:05.060 --> 43:11.460
The the stories are look how uniform the themes are and i don't know if there's any difference between

43:12.020 --> 43:13.540
um

43:13.540 --> 43:17.860
All of them in the sense of what they think about the novel virus that killed millions

43:17.940 --> 43:22.660
That's probably gain a function that will likely come again. All of these books say that

43:28.660 --> 43:31.620
And this book at least somewhere inside of it

43:33.140 --> 43:35.140
Has some faint hint

43:35.780 --> 43:41.140
That actually it's gotten so sophisticated that they could just lie about this stuff and we would never know

43:41.460 --> 43:43.460
And

43:44.500 --> 43:51.140
There's lots of reason to believe that this virology stuff is kind of smoke and mirrors and so maybe they have lied about it

43:52.820 --> 43:58.820
It's not the theme of the book. It's not the conclusion of the book. It's a hint that's in the book somewhere if you just pay attention to what I got

43:58.820 --> 44:01.780
In there, that's it. That's all I can tell you. It's the best I can do

44:05.620 --> 44:09.060
Because like all the other books up there. This is a book about

44:09.940 --> 44:11.940
a great deception

44:12.660 --> 44:14.900
And what the stories that people told

44:15.940 --> 44:20.340
And if you want to crack this story, you're going to have to crack the story of those people

44:20.820 --> 44:25.300
Between 2018, 1920, 2021 you're going to only see it

44:28.020 --> 44:30.020
If you look back to 2021

44:31.620 --> 44:34.820
And unfortunately really they they don't want you to look that far back

44:34.900 --> 44:38.100
But the whole truth is still available on the internet. All you got to do is watch

44:40.020 --> 44:42.020
And

44:42.020 --> 44:50.980
So having this team worst case scenario was really important having it be a national security priority was really important because it motivates people in a different way

44:53.060 --> 44:57.380
It makes people certain in a different way. It makes people feel elite in a different way

44:58.340 --> 45:02.260
And so worst case scenario feels more patriotic in that way too

45:02.260 --> 45:04.260
And

45:05.540 --> 45:14.500
And so we got picked up on that road and we got in in the car with any number of people all of whom were under that pretense

45:16.020 --> 45:20.260
Worst case scenario, but focus on one thing or two things and nothing else

45:21.860 --> 45:24.580
And make sure that nobody really questions this faith

45:24.980 --> 45:26.980
And

45:28.420 --> 45:30.420
Make rivalries between you

45:30.500 --> 45:33.300
It's literally turning into worst case scenario

45:33.300 --> 45:35.780
And from march of 2020

45:37.460 --> 45:40.260
Onward this faith in the novel virus was laid down

45:40.260 --> 45:43.780
The latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario

45:43.780 --> 45:47.940
And four years later the same characters are still saying the same things

45:49.620 --> 45:51.940
And so what happens when we look at this character

45:52.900 --> 45:57.460
What is he saying right now? What stories are he is he adding to this mythology?

45:59.540 --> 46:02.740
Wonder what what he's adding to this mythology here

46:07.060 --> 46:09.060
Oh

46:09.540 --> 46:12.420
You silly get your mouse up in the right screen would you

46:13.860 --> 46:18.980
Here we go from microbe tv. This is beyond the noise episode number 24

46:19.140 --> 46:22.340
Sorry about that. On December 26th, 2023

46:24.500 --> 46:29.860
Hope you don't mind I sped it up a little bit. I'm Vincent racking yellow and joining me today is your host dr. Paul off it

46:30.900 --> 46:36.740
Hello, Paul. Happy holidays to you. You too today. Well, this is a video version of post column on sub stack

46:36.900 --> 46:39.860
It's called beyond the noise cutting to the chase on important health topics and today

46:40.420 --> 46:46.320
Just published this morning. We're going to take a look at post column labels matter operation warp speed and emergency use

46:46.640 --> 46:51.680
Authorization and you say in your column during the early stages of the covid pandemic both the cdc and the fda

46:51.680 --> 46:59.520
You certain words or phrases that inadvertently frightened or confused the american public. So let's start with operation warp speed

46:59.920 --> 47:01.920
What exactly was that?

47:02.080 --> 47:08.720
Right. So this was a program under the trump administration whereby they gave 11 billion dollars and bet on six companies to win one race

47:09.280 --> 47:13.840
Basically taking the risk out of it for pharmaceutical companies and it made for a much much quicker timeline because

47:14.080 --> 47:17.440
Technically when a pharmaceutical company makes a metal product like this a biological product

47:17.440 --> 47:21.200
Wait, what was the series of stages? Wait, what did he say? Hold on? I got to slow that

47:22.560 --> 47:27.760
No, I got to slow that down because I think I heard my friend

47:28.640 --> 47:34.480
I think I heard my friend mark kulak say something to the effect of it being a horse race

47:35.920 --> 47:37.120
a

47:37.120 --> 47:39.280
Transfection horse race of sorts

47:40.240 --> 47:45.440
And didn't he just say that warp speed was 11 billion dollars that was spent

47:46.560 --> 47:52.480
To get six people to compete at six something something to compete. Did you hear that?

47:54.240 --> 47:56.240
What exactly was that?

47:57.520 --> 48:07.280
Right. So this was a program under the trump administration whereby they gave 11 billion dollars and bet on six companies to win one race

48:08.080 --> 48:14.960
Basically taking the risk out of it for pharmaceutical companies and it made for a much much quicker timeline because

48:15.440 --> 48:22.560
typically when a pharmaceutical company makes a medical product like this a biological product they go through a series of stages

48:23.600 --> 48:28.080
And they're done sequentially they're not done pretty much all at the same time

48:28.080 --> 48:31.440
And for example, you would wait to make sure that in a large trial

48:31.920 --> 48:38.720
You're a vaccine in this case worked and was saying before saying committing to building a building and manufacturing

48:39.040 --> 48:41.760
millions of doses where this here this was all sort of

48:42.400 --> 48:46.640
Trunkated so it was it was a phenomenal program. Um, I think frankly

48:47.120 --> 48:52.640
Here was a virus that was first raised its head and entered the human population in late 2019

48:53.200 --> 49:00.320
Um as an animal to human spillover event the virus was isolated and sequenced by january of 2020 and 11 months later

49:00.720 --> 49:04.240
You had a vaccine, uh, using a novel technology

49:05.120 --> 49:07.280
Using a sequence from a single dude

49:08.000 --> 49:15.840
Um, and yeah bet on six companies to win one race is actually what he said

49:16.720 --> 49:23.040
11 billion dollars bet on six companies to win one race

49:23.600 --> 49:26.640
I'm wondering if mark kulak isn't cooperating with

49:27.040 --> 49:28.160
Um

49:28.160 --> 49:32.080
With paul off it in some way and i'm actually not being fooled

49:32.800 --> 49:36.720
Um, i'm going to need to do some research. I think they might live

49:37.120 --> 49:41.440
Uh close to each other. So it is possible that we're being fooled here

49:42.160 --> 49:46.320
Um, but i'm going to keep the video playing for right now. Just kid and mark

49:47.440 --> 49:50.000
To draw an a with which we've had no previous experience

49:50.560 --> 49:54.880
Um, and the size of those two clinical trials and Pfizer, Moderna's mRNA trials

49:54.880 --> 49:57.680
were the size of any typical adult or pediatric vaccine trial

49:57.680 --> 50:02.320
I think it honestly was the most amazing scientific achievement in my lifetime

50:02.400 --> 50:06.640
And i'm old enough to have, uh, lived during the polio vaccine era. So

50:08.400 --> 50:10.800
Yeah, I think that it lived longer than me

50:10.800 --> 50:15.840
And I thought it would take five years at the onset to have a vaccine and we had it in a year

50:16.640 --> 50:18.960
So the program is great, but what's the issue?

50:19.680 --> 50:23.040
Think about the amount of nonsense that's going on here

50:23.200 --> 50:24.640
And i'm old enough

50:24.640 --> 50:26.640
Which we've had no previous experience

50:26.880 --> 50:34.000
Um, and the size of those two clinical trials and Pfizer, Moderna's mRNA trials were the size of any typical adult or pediatric vaccine trial

50:34.000 --> 50:38.640
I think it honestly was the most amazing scientific achievement in my lifetime

50:38.720 --> 50:44.000
And i'm old enough to have, uh, lived during the polio vaccine era. So I think it was amazing

50:44.720 --> 50:47.440
Yeah, I I think I lived longer than you and I

50:48.000 --> 50:52.160
Thought it would take five years at the onset to have a vaccine and we had it in a year

50:52.960 --> 50:55.920
So the program is great, but what's the issue with the name?

50:56.880 --> 50:58.640
Well, so so the um

50:58.640 --> 51:02.320
It was an fda senior person the fda who was a star trek fan

51:02.800 --> 51:07.440
And so he liked the name, uh, worst speed, which at least if you're a star trek fan

51:07.440 --> 51:10.240
You would realize means speed faster than the speed of light

51:10.720 --> 51:13.360
And so he gave it that name. I it was

51:14.080 --> 51:19.920
Uncomfortable, I think for some people to see this happen as quickly as it did because you can understand it

51:20.080 --> 51:27.040
People thought if it's being made this quickly when typically a vaccine takes 10 years to make 15 years to make 20 years to make

51:27.200 --> 51:30.400
I was fortunate enough to work on the rotary sex and it took 26 years to make

51:30.720 --> 51:36.480
How can you possibly make it this fast without truncating a critical stage in the process or worse?

51:36.800 --> 51:43.680
Ignoring safety guidelines. So I think when people heard the term warp speed if anything that didn't allay those fears

51:43.840 --> 51:51.200
Sadly, so you could have argued maybe we could have called it, you know operation defeat covid or end the pandemic something like that

51:51.200 --> 51:53.760
Um, this is really operation warp speed too

51:54.080 --> 51:58.720
And you think about it because and you know, that's better than me that the polyovacine really was was

51:59.360 --> 52:04.800
Made much more quickly because of the the money that was put into it by the march of the he can't stop

52:05.280 --> 52:10.880
He can't stop mentioning the polio vaccine. It's like the sixth time he brought it up. I think he survived

52:12.240 --> 52:14.240
Um, he survived the polio

52:14.880 --> 52:21.200
Epidemic and and the plague and something else indeed. It's really amazing to me how

52:22.400 --> 52:28.480
How all in they are on the mythology at this point. I mean they are just all absolutely all in

52:29.440 --> 52:35.200
These are the best thing that's ever happened in his lifetime better than

52:36.000 --> 52:37.760
the polio vaccine

52:37.760 --> 52:43.600
Isn't that what he said? I mean, do I need to go back and listen to that one more time? I think he said that

52:43.840 --> 52:46.960
He's had and entered the human population in late 2019

52:47.520 --> 52:54.640
Um as an animal to human spillover event the virus was isolated and sequenced by january of 2020 and 11 months later

52:55.120 --> 53:01.600
You had a vaccine using a novel technology messenger RNA with which we'd had no previous experience

53:02.160 --> 53:09.280
Um, and the size of those two clinical trials of Pfizer, Moderna's mRNA trials were the size of any typical adult or pediatric vaccine trial

53:09.280 --> 53:11.440
I think it honestly was the most

53:11.440 --> 53:18.000
Amazing scientific achievement in my lifetime and i'm old enough to have uh lived during the polio vaccine era

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
So I think it was amazing

53:20.080 --> 53:27.520
Yeah, I I think I lived longer than you and I thought it would take five years at the onset to have a vaccine and we had it in a year

53:28.240 --> 53:31.200
So the program is great, but what's the issue with the name?

53:32.160 --> 53:38.240
Well, so so the um so the odd thing is here is of course, they're not really being honest, right if they just said

53:38.960 --> 53:45.120
Okay, the the fda just approved whatever they were given or that it was a a

53:45.920 --> 53:50.560
A military priority or a national security priority to roll this

53:51.360 --> 53:55.200
To roll this thing out. They were taking advantage of the opportunity to do it

53:55.840 --> 54:00.320
Any of these things don't jive with what he just said. It's really bizarre

54:01.040 --> 54:02.160
because

54:02.160 --> 54:06.560
It really doesn't five years at the onset to have a vaccine and we had it in a year

54:07.360 --> 54:12.800
So the program is great, but what's the issue with the name? And so they the idea that they

54:13.760 --> 54:20.800
They just gloss over this that it's they're supposed to be sequential because they're dependent on one another these five steps

54:21.760 --> 54:25.760
You're supposed to adjust one for the other you're supposed to learn something from each step

54:26.400 --> 54:28.400
It's not supposed to be done

54:28.960 --> 54:34.400
In such a way where where you progress from one to the other never mind doing it all at the same time

54:36.080 --> 54:42.160
And of course, that's what it became so confounding about it any of the stuff that was done in animals was completely ignored

54:43.440 --> 54:48.000
Because the human trials were sped up and done and then those preempted the it's

54:49.280 --> 54:51.280
It's so disingenuous

54:51.440 --> 54:53.280
Well, so so the um

54:53.280 --> 54:56.960
It was an fda senior person the fda who was a star trek fan

54:57.360 --> 54:59.360
And so he liked the name

54:59.360 --> 55:04.880
Worf speed which at least if you're a star trek fan you would realize means speed faster than the speed of light

55:05.360 --> 55:07.360
And so he gave it that name

55:07.520 --> 55:08.640
it was

55:08.640 --> 55:14.480
Uncomfortable, I think for some people to see this happen as quickly as it did because you can understand it

55:14.560 --> 55:15.760
on people thought

55:15.760 --> 55:21.680
If it's being made this quickly when typically a vaccine takes 10 years to make 15 years to make 20 years to make

55:21.680 --> 55:23.680
I was fortunate enough to work on the road of ice vaccine

55:23.680 --> 55:27.280
It took 26 years to make how can you possibly make it this fast?

55:27.680 --> 55:32.800
Without truncating a critical stage in the process or worse ignoring safety guidelines

55:32.880 --> 55:38.880
So I think when people heard the term warp speed if anything that didn't allay those fears sadly

55:38.880 --> 55:45.760
So you could have argued maybe we could have called it, you know operation defeat covid or end the pandemic something like that

55:46.640 --> 55:48.400
This is really operation warp speed too

55:48.720 --> 55:53.360
And you think about it because and you know, that's better than me that the polio vaccine really was was

55:53.920 --> 55:58.800
Made much more quickly because of the the money that was put into it by the march of dine

55:58.880 --> 56:04.960
Which was a private philanthropic organization that basically paid these companies to make a vaccine while it was still being tested

56:04.960 --> 56:09.680
So in a way it was similar to that and and so it was a great program

56:09.680 --> 56:14.880
But I think by naming what we named that it didn't allay the fears that things weren't being done too quickly

56:15.520 --> 56:20.240
Yeah, but that's that's a sort of hindsight thing. Well, who knew that that was going to be an issue, right?

56:21.280 --> 56:23.280
Exactly. It's always easy

56:23.360 --> 56:24.640
I mean, I thought

56:24.640 --> 56:33.040
We on twiv often discussed how probably wasn't a great name, right? Because anytime you imply speed people assume you're cutting corners and

56:34.080 --> 56:35.600
Hopefully

56:35.600 --> 56:37.280
next time

56:37.280 --> 56:41.120
We will have learned from this and we won't do that, right? But who knows

56:42.160 --> 56:47.440
Right, I think the thing that really didn't worry people legitimately was that we were coming it was an election year

56:47.520 --> 56:52.560
2020 was an election year and here you had an election that was happening at the beginning of november

56:52.880 --> 56:56.000
Well in order to complete the the safety protocols

56:56.080 --> 57:00.960
Which is to say to follow up two months after the last dose in this case the second dose

57:01.200 --> 57:02.960
That took you into the beginning of september

57:03.440 --> 57:09.200
So there was i'm sorry to the beginning of december so that that would have been after the the election and

57:09.840 --> 57:13.280
Then president trump wanted to move this along

57:13.360 --> 57:15.600
He wanted to have the vaccine before the election

57:15.600 --> 57:18.960
And so he put a lot of pressure on the fda commissioner who at the time was steve and han

57:19.440 --> 57:23.680
To do this now to make sure we didn't have that two month waiting period

57:23.680 --> 57:27.840
But rather had a little less than a month waiting period and han to his credit stood up

57:27.840 --> 57:32.800
He was brought into the into the oval office and an invective late and tirade

57:33.040 --> 57:37.840
Was screened that to get this done early, but he stood tall and so we had that two month safety

57:38.400 --> 57:43.600
Which would you had to have so it all did work very well, but I think you're right. I think the name

57:44.720 --> 57:48.480
Implied speed and speed always implies, you know that corners could be cut

57:49.520 --> 57:55.760
So they're trying to imply that at the last minute the trump administration tried to cut some corners at the end but this

57:56.640 --> 57:59.600
New administration somehow or they somehow

58:00.400 --> 58:02.400
Made them wait two more months

58:02.960 --> 58:06.800
To complete the rest of the safety investigation

58:07.840 --> 58:12.720
Because two more months will tell you a lot about transfection and you know how how art I mean

58:15.280 --> 58:17.280
It is spectacular

58:18.000 --> 58:21.200
They think that that our neighbors and family are dumb

58:22.640 --> 58:26.480
About the polio vaccine. Well, it's true that the uh the march of dimes

58:27.120 --> 58:31.680
National foundation. They really pushed jonus saw to do it very quickly

58:32.400 --> 58:36.240
We've been working on a polio vaccine since the virus was discovered in 1906

58:36.240 --> 58:40.240
So I always like to say it took 50 years to get the science together, you know

58:40.880 --> 58:45.760
Understand how it's transmitted understand there are three serotypes and so forth

58:46.320 --> 58:50.720
And then that made it ready for for jonus saw to do that and of course

58:51.520 --> 58:54.880
All of that science adds up and and it was used for

58:55.440 --> 59:03.120
Covid vaccine is he taking credit for the polio vaccine like saying that he couldn't have done it without us or he wasn't there, right? So

59:04.000 --> 59:12.720
Yeah, I know he just says it weird like we'd been working on a vaccine. He wasn't even I mean, it's not that old is he means as well?

59:13.520 --> 59:17.040
Maybe that's a really good point and technically mRNA vaccines weren't new

59:17.040 --> 59:22.400
I mean the sense that they've been worked on since 2005 initially in an attempt to make an HIV vaccine

59:22.400 --> 59:27.200
So that's a good point. So the second word set of words that you write about is

59:28.400 --> 59:30.400
emergency use

59:30.800 --> 59:32.800
Authorization tell us what that is

59:34.000 --> 59:37.760
That's the term that you use instead of licensure because

59:38.720 --> 59:46.080
The the techniques of the style in which the FDA really supervises program was we're different than would have been done for a typical

59:46.400 --> 59:52.160
Vaccine made on the typical timeline. I mean typically the way it works is that you know the company is

59:52.880 --> 59:54.880
finished their phase three trial

59:54.960 --> 01:00:02.640
And then submit their biological license application to the FDA for approval which takes about 10 minutes and during that period of time

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.720
the FDA licenses

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.320
What's the problem here

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.880
What is he not telling our family and friends? Was he not telling college students?

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.760
What is he not telling all the people that are watching him and trusting that he's giving the right information?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.760
Sorry for the blower in the background. That's the heater in here

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.000
He's not telling them that this has to do with the prep act in an emergency crisis declaration

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.560
By health and human services and specifically I believe

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.520
it's the office of

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:46.880
The I don't know who does it. I think it's the health and human services secretary that declares an emergency if they declare an emergency under the prep act then

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.960
Emergency use authorizations can be granted

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.200
So he's making it seem like it's just a bad name for something that is you know a little bit sped up

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.120
And it's not really it's it's about the same as how they do it normally. No, it's completely different

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.680
Because now anything that is granted in EUA is completely indemnified

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160
You don't have any liability

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880
And so it's a very different

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.640
Manufacturing and and product space than any other

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.400
In existence and it even supersedes that of a

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.640
Of a vaccine because there you at least have this vaccine

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:37.440
Injury something something vicp here you have or no, that's the cicp here

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.120
You have the vicp and that's only for certain things. I mean it's extraordinary

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:47.760
I don't think remdesivir is gonna be that's not gonna be a problem. That's not gonna be vulnerable for anything

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.360
Because it's just a drug unless you

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.600
Has they've shown in one or two cases where they can show that it was dirty

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.440
That it was contaminated but remdesivir is a poison

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.320
But because it was given in EUA, they're just completely indemnified and anybody that used it is completely indemnified

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.480
So he's not really telling the truth here at all. I mean, he's not he's not even remotely telling the truth

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.440
The process by which the product is made were by the company submit a series of protocols that are looked at very carefully by

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.000
The FDA and they also licensed the building and that occurs following then that biological license application

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.680
That's not the way it happened here. The way it happened here was it was ongoing

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.000
I mean the the FDA was clearly supervising the protocols the FDA was clearly supervising the building in which these

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.840
These vaccines were made so it was happening in real time rather than later

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.040
So really it wasn't in the end any different the final product this product that was

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.240
Authorized from emergency. You saw authorization was the exact same as the product that would have been licensed

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.240
But because the term was used emergency use authorization there were people like remember F Kennedy jr

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:07.200
Or ron Johnson who was a republican senator from Wisconsin or type of harleson who said i'm not getting that vaccine

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.040
I'm not getting this emergency vaccine

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.880
I'm going to wait until the vaccine is licensed and a number of people picked that up

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.680
They chose to wait till the product was licensed

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.400
They chose to wait till the product was licensed then they couldn't get karmanity anywhere

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.680
Because all the vials were labeled the other way

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.960
And it was actually the whole that was the whole that was another

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.480
False narrative

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:38.880
It was another easy thing for people to say well i'm not going to get it until it's it's uh, you know, it gets approval

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.800
I'm not going to get it till it's fully approved. So that was just another way to sucker you in

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.480
Was another bamboozlement

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.080
And now he's reverse telling that story and he's blaming it on tucker carlson

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.720
robert f Kennedy jr

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.160
And and it's so disingenuous. It's just sad

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.480
I'm pretty sure bobby kennedy didn't say maybe he did

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:11.520
That he wasn't going to take it until it was approved. I don't I kind of doubt it

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.520
But I don't know it could have been

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.280
I know I didn't say that and I know that makes no sense

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.560
Because transfection and healthy humans is dumb

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.320
Was um ridiculous in the sense that it was the exact same product

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.160
So all they were doing was leaving themselves at risk unnecessarily

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.280
Has this term been used before paul

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:44.000
They were leaving themselves at risk unnecessarily waiting for it for approval like wow that just seems like a huge risk

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:50.880
I mean waiting for six months for fda approval knowing how valuable fda approval is that's

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.400
It's almost like he's making that argument. Do you hear it?

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.080
It's almost like he's making the argument that the fda is pretty much a

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.240
Wet piece of tissue paper when it comes to a regulatory body

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.400
So waiting for the fda to approve it is kind of really waiting for somebody to I don't know

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.600
Sweeped

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.320
There's not even a good enough analogy here. They're going to approve it

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.640
You know they don't even look at anything so waiting for fda approval is kind of laughable

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.120
And so you might as well take it now if you're going to take it at the time that they approve it

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200
That's the argument he should be making

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:32.320
I think it has in certain situations, but it was new to me

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.920
I mean, I'm I'm voting member on the fda vaccine advisor committee

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.720
I hadn't heard that before and I can tell you that when we had that December meeting the first was on December 10th

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.240
Of 2020 we did bring that up because all this notice that this was really no different

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.160
In terms of the way that it was being supervised. It was just being done more quickly

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:55.360
And so we worried about the word emergency and would prefer just use word authorization

01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.680
I think it would have scared people who less why couldn't they have just licensed it immediately

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.440
Called it lifestry. I think that's that's a very good question because certainly it was the rigor

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.440
He's still arguably the same and certainly it would have also helped

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.600
I think because I mean I was fortunate enough to be on this fda's vaccine advisor committee

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:21.760
Well, I got to meet people like mary group or feel crafty these sort of long time uh senior members of the fda

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:29.040
Who are who are very rigorous and and and anybody who uh spends any time dealing with people who work at the fda are really

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:35.360
Encouraged by how careful they are how thorough they are. I do think they tend to be fairly quiet

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.440
Nice if they got up in front of the meeting said look this is what we're doing

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.280
This is how we're regulating this product who kind of reassure people, but uh, they they didn't do that. Of course

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.000
Again in hindsight

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.400
Wasn't a great idea to call it an EU a lot of people didn't even understand it as you said some people took advantage of it

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.160
But many many americans simply didn't understand

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.000
What it meant so I think you know the fda has had long many years

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.040
Tradition and and they do their work very well, but they have to be a little more flexible. I think and

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.960
And this is a time when they should have been and it just said we're gonna license it, but again, how would they know it's hindsight, right?

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.080
Right, I think in theory their communications people could help them out with that

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.960
And I think they I do think I feel the way about the cdc as well

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:31.760
I think we really need to get out there and explain things in detail and like not at a level

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.360
On h grade level meeting newspaper level where you know people untrusted people will understand it

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:44.240
Some people won't understand but but you know do your best to try and explain it in detail trust the american public that they can understand the detail

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.920
Including scientific details. Well, I do hope that these two

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800
kinds of issues the

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.840
Warp speed and the eway. I hope in the next pandemic. We don't use them. I hope the fda in the cdc

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:02.640
Remember you can find paul off it at beyond the noise. We'll put a link to that in the show notes

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.200
That's beyond the noise with dr. paul often. Thank you paul. Thank you

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.120
Yeah, get out of here. Why are you not getting out of here? There we go

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.480
Close that window

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.680
So, um

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.360
I do really think we are making a lot of progress

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.200
I do I do really firmly believe that

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.320
um

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.320
What?

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.880
Why did you do that? I said here

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840
You demon

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720
Yes

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.000
I do really think we're making a lot of progress

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.040
Why is there a yellow box around that thing?

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.920
There shouldn't be a yellow box around that

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760
No outline

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.480
Um

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.880
I do really think we're making a lot of progress

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.440
I do really think that we have come a long way and I do really think we're starting

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.720
2004 24 in a very strong position

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.800
um

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.680
But

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.760
It's now really a crucial time and in this year in the next coming months as we move into spring

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:33.360
I do really think it needs to start to become the conversation that maybe they told us a story about what happened

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.600
And actually they just murdered people in 2020 and 21

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320
and called it evidence of spread

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.640
And

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.160
We need to come to terms with with grit and come to grips with the possibility that this is exactly what all these

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.480
These worst-case scenario people are now trying to cover up and make sure that we never come to that conclusion

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.680
We never do the math and it never becomes obvious to us that that's what happened

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.600
And so I am drawing this diagram differently because I want you to see

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.720
That 2020 and 2021 are becoming compressed

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.960
um and the reason why they're becoming compressed in this image is because

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.040
Those years are being compressed in our memory

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.000
Nobody even wants you to think about what they were saying in 2020

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.280
But I do I would love for you to try and investigate what I was saying in 2020

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.520
Find what I was saying

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.160
Clip the best clips and send it around the world. Please find what I was saying in 2020

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.560
Because in 2021 I became more confused than I was in 2020

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.760
Because I started to think that the

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.040
Transfection could be having an effect on the virus and that the virus was actually circulating

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:05.360
That those variants meant something I became more and more bamboozled by the aggressive nature

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.320
Of all the experts that I was surrounded by the sea of information that I was flooded with

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.320
And the almost infinite challenge that it was to try and cut through the

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.960
Absolute nonsense that I was surrounded by people throwing at me

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.160
Livestreaming about me

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.560
Livestreaming with me

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.520
Blogging about this stuff sending me

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.160
Articles about this stuff making sure that I couldn't see through the illusion of consensus

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.440
To the point where I was also a part of the faith in the novel virus

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.560
Convincing people that this was a lab leak

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Riding my bike around saying that it was a that probably could have what happened

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:58.480
And my only saving grace is that I came to the conclusion quite early that if there's something going around that got out

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480
It would be much better for us to get it

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.200
And make immunity to it like we do to all the other stuff and there's no reason to believe that it's any worse than anything else

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.000
Maybe we're treating these people wrong

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.200
Can you believe it?

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.880
I said those words

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.960
It's in multiple videos

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
That's why nobody makes any clips

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.920
And so this faith in a novel virus is being sustained because they want it to be passed to our children

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.760
They want us to there are children to believe thank heaven

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.120
Transfection works better than expected next round will be great

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040
And this faith is a lie

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.440
We must break it

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.640
We cannot let our college kids. We can't let our young college kids

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.160
We can't let high school kids get on this train

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.640
And high school teachers a lot of them are on this train

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.520
Young kids teachers like my kids teachers are definitely on this train

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.760
Where it makes perfect sense to put a mask on if you're sick

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.440
It makes perfect sense if you put put a mask on if your kids are sick in the room

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320
Makes perfect sense

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.440
A

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.800
Symptomatic spreads definitely reel all this stuff about gain of function is in the back of their heads

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.480
We've got to get it out and get it out now or the train's going to leave the station and the way we do it

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.200
is with biology

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.280
We're going to call for a pause on all

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:39.120
Vaccinations in the United States because the United States schedule is the one example of incredible malfeasance

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.160
At least in other western countries. They keep most of the shots be after six months. They encourage breastfeeding

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.560
We've got multiple studies that show that breastfeeding is a great way to detoxify

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.600
And it's also a great way to keep a break on the immune system

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.600
So that in the event of a vaccination gone wrong where the immune system is over activated or or disrupted in some way

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.920
It is dampened

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
by the breastfeeding

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.880
And so you don't we don't know how it works

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.800
but we do see that breastfed babies tend to have less injuries less less

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.000
Illnesses associated with with vaccine injury

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.480
And so there there are there is biology here

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.960
But the only way that we're going to expose this by we don't need to expose it anymore

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.800
The only way we can act on this biology rather is to call for a pause and we call for a pause because it's a little weaker

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.800
Word that means exactly the same thing

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:49.760
Has a complete stop and we advocate for strict liability because it's not randomized controlled trials that we want because if we want those

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.720
They'll do those and they'll rig them and they'll cut them short just like they did on this one

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.320
And they'll say that placebos we don't need placebos because those that's not ethically

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.040
Okay or morally cool

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.800
We just got a call for strict liability. It's that simple

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.720
Investigate the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.200
Investigate the use of mass casualty events and transfection to create the illusion of pandemic

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.880
Take back our sovereignty and get rid of our cdc's

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.320
How to see the medlers who are currently playing the game for the

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:32.080
The upcoming control mechanism. I think if you really want to see them what you've got to look for people who just don't

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.880
They don't even mention the childhood vaccine schedule at all

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240
They won't even come close to it

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.280
And I think if you look at some of the

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.360
The dissident heroes on the list you can it's a very short list of people who will even approach

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.120
the childhood vaccination schedule to comment on it never mind to say something as bold as

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.360
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080
very

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:12.000
Rarely will they cite the use of deadly protocols to cause mass casualty events is a meaningful data point in other words

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.960
Even when they have data of their own that they've gathered on their own amassed with their own work

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:24.160
They might not spike that football very often and but instead focus on the vaccines

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.200
And I think the more important

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:33.280
Football to spike is the one that there was no pandemic in the first place. So every single one of these shots

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.080
Should have never been given

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.280
They do not use the word

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.520
They don't use the word clone. They don't attack

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:53.680
Ideas they attack people instead. That's why people never talk about what jay kui says. They just talk about jay kui and finally

01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:01.280
They're not able to summarize across the entire show and if they do they're just learning to do it and they haven't done it for three years

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Or longer

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:13.520
So we are at a timepoint where they can feed the AI the most genetic diversity and the most repetitive genetic

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.480
homogeneity

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.540
So they have a very homo homo homo homo homo homo homo homo homo homo homo homogenous

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:26.820
homogenous population in India, very homogenous populations in China, large

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:33.940
populations that are relatively homogenous when compared to the West. And

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:39.660
so over here you have a very heterogeneous population and so you have two sides of

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:46.220
a scientific experimental coin and the maximum number of people that they ever

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:52.260
want to have on Earth again. I mean does that not sound like the perfect setup

01:17:52.260 --> 01:18:01.700
for like 30 or 40 years of experiments? I think it does but we could also see it

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:08.260
as a time point where humanity has a chance to awaken and reorient. And I

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:12.740
think that's what we should be trying to advocate for as we move forward in the

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.820
future. That's my goal. That's what I would like to advocate for because I

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:25.700
think that's what really you know my kids and Nathan's kids they all they all they

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.460
all they all they all they all need that they really do. Sorry about that wrong

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:35.940
button there. Still an amateur at this one-man show thing. They are trying to

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.820
eliminate the control group by any means necessary. They're being kind of quiet

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.380
about it but I assure you that's still the goal. Intramuscular injection of

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:46.940
any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:51.980
is dumb. Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent and viruses are

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:55.300
not patterned integrity.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:26.140
These are the supporters of gig home biological the current subscribers of

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:32.220
course I still have to have to thank people like Greg James and Rodney Mullen

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:41.180
and Eddie boss up there in Canada and Jeff from Earth and Cara a lot of the

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:46.500
bigger supporters behind the scenes to do way more than subscribing but the

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.860
subscribers are where we want to go in the future the idea would be to have

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.340
enough subscribers for this operation to just fly on its own and then we can

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:59.340
say what we want to say and we can push whatever ball forward we want to push

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.980
and we can start to do a lot more because we can probably teach courses and all

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:08.220
kinds of other things with the right amount of support so that's where I'm

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.940
trying to go in 2024 hopefully by the end of the year we'll be able to make a

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:16.780
decision about what we do and how we move forward if you want to help out at

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:20.980
all it's Giga on biological.com thank you very much for joining me and I will

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.260
see you again tomorrow night

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:51.340
I believe it's much more likely it's a lab leak. Stop lying! Stop lying!

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:06.840
you
