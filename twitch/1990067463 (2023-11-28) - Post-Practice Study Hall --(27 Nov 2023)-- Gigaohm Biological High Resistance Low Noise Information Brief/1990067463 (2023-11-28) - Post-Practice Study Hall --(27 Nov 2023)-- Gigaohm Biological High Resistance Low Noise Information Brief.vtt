WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
You

01:00.000 --> 01:19.000
If I could get a sound check here, that would be really great.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
How's that look? Are we alright? Can we align? Yes, great. Thank you very much.

01:29.000 --> 01:42.000
I went back to render forest to get a little special thing for you today just because it's funny.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh no, it's going by itself.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Did you miss the basketball? Sorry, that was it. If you missed it, you missed it.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
It'll be there again. The next time we have a practice post practice study hall, it does help.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
It does happen every once in a while that we will have a post practice study hall.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
In this case, we had practice from 7.30 till 9. That's pretty hard for those boys.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
I don't really like the fact that they have pre teenage boys in the gym till 9 p.m.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
But that's the way it is here in hardcore Pittsburgh.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
These things are definitely the main messages of Gigo and biological.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
One, two, three. Welcome to the show.

02:29.000 --> 02:54.000
And what we are really fighting is really this mythology right here. If we can crack this, we can start to get people to understand that it's possible that this is a mythology, we're going to win.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
And we're really close, ladies and gentlemen, we are really, really close.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
I mean, it's unbelievable how close we are. It's really unbelievable.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So anyway, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the show.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
This is Gigo and biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm back from practice. It's a little late. I'm going to try and fly through this show.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Look at a little video with you, which I just think has another one of these slam dunks.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
And take it easy and go to bed. So welcome to the show. This is Gigo and biological.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
My name is Jonathan Cooley. I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I stream from the back of my garage.

03:36.000 --> 03:50.000
The main message that we have is one of fundamental biology and my fundamental biology where I used to be before the pandemic was I was an academic biologist, which nowadays I'm calling an academy edition.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Because basically what they do is that they use the pretense of doing experiments.

03:57.000 --> 04:13.000
And oftentimes the experiments are done in such a way that the statistical difference, which is identified as a significant result, is actually well within the expected range of noise in the experiment that they've designed.

04:13.000 --> 04:31.000
But because of the way that we use statistics to transform observations into data points and the way that we wield the scientific method, it is wielded incorrectly.

04:32.000 --> 04:47.000
And so anyway, I descend from a group of people like this. I descend from the neurobiology field. And so many of my mentors, many of the people that I learned to wield the scientific method from actually wielded it in this incorrect way.

04:48.000 --> 05:03.000
It's not to say that there aren't scientific methods invaluable, but the way that we move forward with it right now is very misguided with p values and very misguided with a semantic war on what results really mean.

05:03.000 --> 05:16.000
Because there's this push and pull between, you know, I've got to get big results and big grant money and become famous because that's what every professor apparently dreams of being in their own little narrow field.

05:16.000 --> 05:25.000
And, you know, to try and be a real scientist. And so most of the time the real scientist, the real biologist, the real investigator is lost.

05:25.000 --> 05:33.000
And they sell out to this reductionist scientific model, which has really reached its useful end.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
I was a patch clamp physiologist, which meant I did a lot of physiology with live animals. I did a lot of surgeries.

05:39.000 --> 05:52.000
I did a lot of microscopy and all of the measurements that I made that weren't behavioral measurements were made under a microscope with fairly complicated robotic arms attached to it.

05:52.000 --> 06:02.000
And there's a lot of training that goes into this. You have to apprentice with the right people and you generally speaking need to travel the world to apprentice with those people.

06:02.000 --> 06:12.000
And then after that, pulling this trick off on your own with your own lab is another level of investigation.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
And how do you take your instrument and use it wisely, let's say.

06:16.000 --> 06:31.000
So I spent 20 years doing that and the derivative of the name of the show is actually giga ohm biological because giga ohm is the resistance of the seal that is formed when you make the recordings that I made during my academic career.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
And so giga ohm biological high resistance low noise, it all kind of lines up in a very geeky way.

06:36.000 --> 06:58.000
And just in that same geeky way, I am trying to teach the idea that with an illusion of consensus among geeks, we have been fooled into solving a mystery of a mystery virus and fooled into trying to solve the puzzle of who is responsible for the virus.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Who let the virus out.

07:01.000 --> 07:17.000
And this characterization of Scooby-Doo relies on the fact that as an American kid, I really understood this as a funny show because it is cleverly done in the sense of the jokes are all good.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It's a wholesome show and the same thing always happens.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
The monsters never really a monster.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
It's just somebody dressed up as one to try and scare people away from their scam.

07:28.000 --> 07:38.000
And so we have been tricked into believing that very simply we have solved the mystery of the origin of the virus simply by watching television.

07:38.000 --> 07:48.000
Simply by watching people argue simply by catching people in their lives or reading their redacted emails.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
Maybe we should just find a clue on the bottom of a car that was left by a bad guy with a disguise on.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It's all the same.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
This story was planned. This theater was planned.

08:01.000 --> 08:15.000
Even if some of the more recent pivots are off script, 2020 and 2021 were highly scripted years.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.000
And it only takes a few people to lie and the rest of the people just mislead based on this illusion of consensus.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
If you get enough of these leaders to lie, enough of these insiders to lie.

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
How many do you really need in key positions to be telling a lie in order for the rest of the dominoes to fall in order for the rest of the plan to be executed?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And that's really where we are.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
The way that they did it, of course, is that they tried very hard.

08:48.000 --> 08:59.000
Think about how amazing it is that no matter whether you watch Fox News or MSNBC, you've come to believe that there is pandemic potential in bad caves.

08:59.000 --> 09:17.000
Think about how amazing it is that your friends who knew Jack squat about biology three years ago can now explain how pandemic potential is accessible in laboratories through cell culture, animal passage and genetic manipulation.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
Think about how magical it is that the old lady down the street and also the young mother across the street and also the the mailman.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
If we stop them all and ask them about this stuff, they wouldn't scratch their head.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
Some of them would reference John Stewart. Some of them would reference Jimmy Fallon, but they would all know the story.

09:42.000 --> 09:54.000
And they would all have come to the conclusion that, wow, it's a really different world that we live in when this worst case scenario is possible, isn't it? Who would have ever thought?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
That's how amazing this theater was.

09:58.000 --> 10:09.000
And once you grasp it, you can start to present the idea to anybody, basically, because it's all a theater.

10:09.000 --> 10:28.000
And the crazy part about it is the part that took me three years to figure out is that not only was the theater on television, not only was the theater at government podiums, not only was the theater at who and Gavi and all these other podiums, but the theater was also on the social media.

10:28.000 --> 10:42.000
In the back rooms of social media on the rebellion podcasts on social media, on the intellectual dark web, you know, where the heterodoxy is questioned.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
They too were part of the show.

10:46.000 --> 11:01.000
And they worked so well in concert together to split us up to get us to bounce around from social media platform to social media platform to follow them as they were censored.

11:01.000 --> 11:18.000
And this whole time we've been led around by our nose and only very recently are we so off script because people are starting to realize that these people are working in concert to establish this.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
They have to be.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
The build back better, the new normal.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Same team.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
The people at the government podiums and the people on social media same team.

11:33.000 --> 11:44.000
And if they're not the same team, they're competing interests that are both scamming you with the pull and push of the train.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
That's where it starts to become very intriguing. That's where it starts to become very intriguing to actually know the history.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
To have a friend like Mark Koolak, who is really trying to build an archive of facts.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.000
And a web of links between these people so we can really look back and decide, okay, really, how has this been coordinated.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Who has had their fingers in this pie for the longest.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
And you can't know that by having woken up because the pandemic, I knew right away that they were full bull.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
That's not that's not woke yet. That's not woken.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That's aware.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
That's like you can smell that somebody's baking, but you don't know what's being baked yet.

12:30.000 --> 12:37.000
You don't know whether they know what they're doing or whether it's fake and you don't know whether it's in your house or the neighbor's house.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
And so we need to wake people up so that they understand what's happening.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
We are being actively misled to believe that this pandemic potential is a permanent threat.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
So that we will actively mislead our children into believing that.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
That's what's so wicked about it.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
I lost a train of thought there for a second and I wanted to say something else so it might come back and I might have to pop through it again but but

13:08.000 --> 13:20.000
there is something very important to be able to convey about how diabolical it is that the performers are on both sides and they are pretending to antagonize one another.

13:20.000 --> 13:33.000
It's very likely that Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein actually are fighting and actually do dislike one another but both are on and that's what I wanted to say.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
The competing interest part.

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
Remember the train analogy with the guy who's pretending to stop the train and pretending to start the train again and then and we take that analogy farther.

13:45.000 --> 13:58.000
And we say that while the little kids aren't going to be fooled by that one guy that one skinny guy but the little kids will be fooled if we get 40 big guys and they acted out really well or we give them big machines that make a lot of noise.

13:58.000 --> 14:06.000
Then it will be more convincing. Now what I want you to understand is that not all 40 of those guys are on the same team.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
Maybe the goal is is that once those kids are fooled.

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
Then something will happen you know like I don't know.

14:18.000 --> 14:29.000
They win a million dollars but only 20 of those guys can win the million dollars so they're competing for something that the kids don't know they're competing for.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
So in the narrative or the analogy of the pandemic we don't yet understand we are the children.

14:37.000 --> 14:48.000
We don't yet understand the relationship between these people that are pretending to start and stop the train. We don't.

14:48.000 --> 14:57.000
But unless you have a guy like Mark who's trying to find the links between these people and understand there's collective history.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
We're not going to have any hope of understanding who's related to who and who's working together and who would stab the other ones in the back.

15:05.000 --> 15:19.000
We're never going to know that because to us it's just 40 people lined up against the train all coordinating coordinatedly pretending to stop and start it.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
For the 67 people that are listening I hope that you already saw the train thing so you know what I'm talking about.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Because I do think that this nuance is real.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
That in order to understand the pandemic you don't only need to understand that this was a coordinated illusion.

15:38.000 --> 15:46.000
But you need to understand that it was a coordinated illusion that was agreed upon by competing interests.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
And those competing interests might be China and Russia and you know whatever.

15:51.000 --> 16:03.000
But I think it's smarter to assume that those groups that we would just default to are not the groups that are really the players.

16:03.000 --> 16:13.000
We should assume that there's you know like I don't know the East European Mafia and then the West Asian Mafia.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
We should think of it more like that.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
That there are going to be factions.

16:17.000 --> 16:25.000
But what those factions are they banks are they are they new agers are they futurists you know that that's how you should be thinking of it.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
It's not it's not likely to be nation states.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Maybe groups of nation states.

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
But those are the kinds of groups that are working together to pretend to stop and start the train.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And that is the theater the pandemic.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And now if we're really going to win.

16:46.000 --> 16:54.000
The challenge we have is is going to be to try and flush out the various groups that are within this performance.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
And how they are competing with one another so that we can turn them against one another.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
So that we can understand where those weaknesses are where they're trying to use one another and agree that okay once this is all over and their serfs and we're nobles.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
You know then we'll compete you know in a different way.

17:13.000 --> 17:22.000
But right now we're going to cooperate because we're going to get out to the other side of this where there's digital ID and central bank digital currencies and then.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
You know it'll be obvious who we are.

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
And we have to get ahead of this by breaking these people up into obvious groups based on their connections or.

17:34.000 --> 17:42.000
Showing how connected some of these players are so that we can see that the two sides are actually controlled it's something like this.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Wow.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The last one nobody likes to figure it out right.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Foreign human and animal DNA.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
So my goal here was actually not to have the sound on these and just to summarize it quick so the first thing that we did.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
Yesterday was we watched this video of Brandy Vaughn who's now dead.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
God resters the whole.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And she is a.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
A well known activist anti vaccine activist.

18:11.000 --> 18:21.000
And we watched a very brief clip of her you can already hear from the brief clip how sharp she is and how good of a presenter she is and why she probably need to be eliminated.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
We are at a different stage in the history of America though and it could be that wet work is over.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
It could be that they're not going to.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
They can't.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
And.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
You know maybe maybe she's just unlucky that she was around at a time where.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
They still saw what work is something that they could do and get away with but now with the Internet and with all the people that have.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Like the larger.

18:49.000 --> 18:59.000
Collection of video record that you have on the Internet the larger stain you've left than the more likely it is that wet work won't help get rid of you.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I don't know I'm trying to be optimistic here.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
Then we we looked a year earlier excuse me.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
We looked a year earlier.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
Later rather after the pandemic and we watched this video that I kind of made fun of because the guy is speaking a little funny.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
But in this video I wanted to just run it briefly because I don't think I pointed out and I wanted you to see it.

19:25.000 --> 19:34.000
This is just a little bit off lineman here.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh it's running through the slide deck darn it. Sorry guys.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm trying to align this image.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I think I can do that.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Hey there goes.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
So we then watched.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Oh now I'm doing it again. See I'm moving this.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I have a filter over this thing and it gets out of alignment. Sorry.

19:58.000 --> 20:06.000
So we we watched this guy and the reason why I wanted to watch him again I'm sorry I'm blowing this.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
It's after practice I don't have any of this set up correctly as I'd like it to be.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I hadn't rehearsed it all. I apologize.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Normally I give you more attention like a 15 minute quick rehearsal of the slide deck.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
So what I want you to watch is in like one second you're going to notice that they show these other doctors right in the background.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
And look what's that? What's that? What's that? Who's that guy?

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
Those are funny looking scrubs aren't they?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Those are funny looking scrubs.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
Interesting right? I didn't notice that the first time but this is a video from the first rollout of the vaccine.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm not sure where it is but that's interesting.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Right? That seems to suggest that the DoD was involved in distribution of it.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
That's not it's not that we didn't know that.

20:57.000 --> 21:05.000
It's a question of does that make them culpable or does that make them part of the machine that was unleashed by a few liars.

21:05.000 --> 21:13.000
That's the problem here right? If you have a national security plan and a national security threat is declared credible.

21:13.000 --> 21:21.000
Then the military executing that plan is you know like shoulder shrug like that's what we do.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
And the military is not designed for every person in that hierarchy to question hey is this ethical?

21:28.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm not sure this is really ethical. Yeah you can you can say that is the way the military should work but when it comes to.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
Orders and emergencies and national security.

21:42.000 --> 21:53.000
There's not a lot of room for questioning there and you don't climb through the ranks of the military by questioning every order.

21:53.000 --> 22:04.000
And I've talked to a few retired individuals who were officers in the armed services and they've all been pretty.

22:05.000 --> 22:20.000
Pretty clear that if they were in that position they would do the same thing because if you're given orders you assume that these people know the risks and have decided that despite whatever those risks are that this.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Path ahead is the best one for the country.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
That's how the military works.

22:28.000 --> 22:40.000
And so that's why a lot of me is very resistant to this you know let's blame the DoD because the DoD is directly under the President of the United States.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
So if you're blaming the DoD then you're blaming the executive branch and then there's a whole bunch of other people that are above the DoD in that sense.

22:47.000 --> 22:57.000
Once the emergency is declared there is a boss structure and that boss structure ends in the executive branch.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
So not to belabor that point very much.

22:59.000 --> 23:07.000
Then we watch this teen conversations thing from Philadelphia which was just very depressing because again you can see what they're doing.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
They played a game with us in 2021 and they pitted us against each other they even pitted teens against teens.

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
And they made teens feel powerful we know what happens in psychological experiments where one group of people is the prison guards for the other.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
How is it that much different.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
How is this not just peer pressure with endorsement.

23:32.000 --> 23:40.000
We need to reconcile this we need to understand how bad this really was.

23:40.000 --> 24:05.000
We watch this thing from PBS NewsHour where we watch this guy with a very fluid gender projection talking about using a lot of language that was a little strange like I am created from this technology and commodify ourselves and just a lot of interesting

24:06.000 --> 24:12.000
language and even language about metamorphosis and the fact that in this three years we've all been transformed.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
Which I connected back to this possibility that COVID is of it.

24:19.000 --> 24:34.000
Any who then we finally watched a little bit of Twiv and they pulled their usual thing with gain of function with prions and actually the third part of this video is a.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Homage to Stanley Plotkin and I don't know.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
They're praising him because he wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine about.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
About polio virus and how some.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And OPV.

24:53.000 --> 25:00.000
Is no longer ethical to use because it paralyzes kids and yada yada yada.

25:00.000 --> 25:14.000
It's really comical actually that Stanley Plotkin is still like a hero a working active hero of these individuals in a way it should it should signify to you exactly the sinister nature of the.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
Situation we're in because a guy like that should have retired a long time ago and have a boat in the Bahamas and not give a darn about.

25:23.000 --> 25:35.000
The industry that he helped establish because it should be flowing forward with great success because it's built on solid biology right.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:49.000
So tonight I wanted to watch a video that I found from the Vancouver nano medicine day 2023 where you will see.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Let me see if I can do this.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
This is work.

25:53.000 --> 26:03.000
I think this works where you will see that Peter Colus is actually one of the guys speaking and I thought it would be very interesting to listen to that talk because again.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
Did he learn his lesson you know like would he slip up on anything else and sure enough you're not going to believe.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
What he says.

26:13.000 --> 26:25.000
And how we hand wave this introduction to the conference it's just it's just something that I think is really extraordinary because again my main point is is that there are.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Actually probably a quarter million.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
Professional biologists around the world that should have done known better that for whatever reason didn't speak up.

26:36.000 --> 26:47.000
Actively looked the other way or actively did not inform themselves in time to protect themselves their families and their communities.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
I would say that anyone that works at a medical school.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
Anyone that's a postdoc at a medical school anyone posing as.

26:57.000 --> 27:06.000
With a legitimate ID that can go into a academic biological laboratory that gets NIH grant funding.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
Should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for what they allowed to happen and going forward.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
That's one of my goals not to shame people but for people to become ashamed of themselves.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Because teaching this biology if you.

27:26.000 --> 27:36.000
If you actually comprehend what I'm going to teach over the next couple weeks as a new viewer as an academic biologist if you just follow along.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
And you don't feel.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
A great debt.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
A great void.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
For how badly.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
You made as a mistake how badly you navigated the last three years.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
I mean I have I have very high hopes that we are going to change a lot of people's minds over the next few weeks.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I think there is going to be a giant giant giant change.

28:10.000 --> 28:18.000
December 5th is when the book comes out December 5th is when we need to start this full court press.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Of showing people the truth.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Of how.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Gain a function as a mythology was created.

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
When it was needed how was it created over several decades at least two if not three or four.

28:39.000 --> 28:46.000
Certainly the plan that we are currently experiencing has been created over at least a decade and a half.

28:48.000 --> 28:59.000
And I am telling you the main way out is biology and getting some some fraction of these academic biologists to understand how.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
How horrible of a misnavigation they're guilty of.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
Of an oversight of a lack of responsibility they could have just done sat down and read some papers.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
They had access to all the journals.

29:13.000 --> 29:20.000
Working at a university you have access to all the journals you have no excuse not to have read some papers.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
And critically thought about them.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And I mean everybody.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Don't forget that I sent my review.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Two and a half years ago I sent it to all the people that I used to work with.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
Those people still haven't called and said I'm sorry or you're right or wow that's crazy and so I'm still interested in that.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Not so much the apology but the wow you were right.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
And it's not like any of those people didn't know that about me before.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
Now what I want you to do is understand that what we're building right now is a wood pile.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
What we're building right now is the water behind the dam.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
And the water behind the dam is getting really deep.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
And the holes are starting to spring in the concrete.

30:15.000 --> 30:34.000
These people can't keep plugging the holes especially if people like Peter McCulloughs are still going to just talk and not realize the mistake that they're making as they talk like this.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
Now this is I know I'm making big statements here but this is really going to shock you actually.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
I have several talks that I could use because it is a festival of nanomedicines right.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
But this talk is so shocking.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
And it's a talk that you would imagine.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
You would imagine right that this talk.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
I'm going to put the plate speed down.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
I usually watch it for very fast but I'll watch it at 125 so we can spend some time together before I go to bed.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
So the reason why we're watching this again is because I want to make very clear.

31:21.000 --> 31:31.000
They know they had to have known and whenever they talk about using nanoparticles lipid nanoparticles in vaccines they hand wave.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
And you will hear it in this introduction.

31:36.000 --> 31:44.000
He's going to hand wave over it even as when he describes the uses of these things in other contexts their limitations.

31:45.000 --> 31:59.000
These same limitations should definitely apply to the idea that we can transfect antigen presenting cells which are free moving cells throughout the body.

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
And they think that they can put these nanoparticles in your body and find those cells.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
But then in the next breath he'll tell you how they can't target anything in the body.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Think about how contradictory that is.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
We can target individual antigen presenting cells which we can't even really locate in the body.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
They don't swarm anywhere.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
And we can target those by squirting it in your muscle.

32:31.000 --> 32:40.000
And usefully augment your immune system but if we wanted to target your spleen or something like that it's a lot more tricky then we can only get like 30%.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
And if we change some of the stuff on the outside then we can get it a little more to your gallbladder and we can get it to like 50%.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
But if we want to target the liver I mean we can get almost 70 or 80% of them to go to the liver. The liver is great.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
So we could just say that most of them target the liver. That's what we usually do when we write grants.

33:02.000 --> 33:12.000
But when we do a vaccine that's already been approved that worked on a billion people when we put it in the muscle we're really just transfecting antigen presenting cells. That's how it works.

33:13.000 --> 33:24.000
That's the extent to the biological mastery that is the foundation for 5 billion shots being rolled out around the world.

33:25.000 --> 33:37.000
The only way to read this is that they want to make genetic therapy like transfection and transformation something that everybody just thinks is safe.

33:38.000 --> 33:59.000
And you will hear that in this introduction. They are going full tilt on exactly what we said they would go full tilt on three years ago in 2021 when they started to talk about how mRNA and lipid nanoparticles were such a parallel development stream in nature with Scott Gottlieb.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
We already said see they're going to do this.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
And then they're going to blame it on the spike protein and they're going to say well if we wouldn't have chosen the wrong protein then this would have worked out fine.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
It turns out that they've sidestepped that story.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And now they're pushing the DNA.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
Everybody's pushing the DNA. Everybody says it's the DNA that matters.

34:21.000 --> 34:29.000
And you're going to see over the next couple of days that when I say everybody says it, I mean everybody says it.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
There are very few people who will acknowledge that the DNA is like an additional layer of ridiculousness on top of already many layers.

34:43.000 --> 34:53.000
A very, very, very nicely baked thousand layer crust has a little frosting of DNA on top of it.

34:54.000 --> 35:05.000
Listen to this talk and understand that this is a person who thinks that transfection has been proven safe because of the rollout of the vaccines.

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
The investigational vaccines, the transfections after COVID.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So, just kidding.

35:15.000 --> 35:21.000
So, what I was going to ask to do today was talk a little bit about the future of nanomesins.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
And so I thought okay, well I'll go through a few things here that have happened over the years and then project forward.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
But, you know, there's that Yogi Berra statements, predictions are difficult, particularly about the future.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
So, I may be wrong, but we'll see how it all pans out.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
The first thing is the first prediction is that my computer is not advancing.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
So, how do I do that?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
So, just to make sure you, oh, why is this not?

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Just to make sure you understand, this was like from November 18th.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
So, this is not even September or whatever it was the last talk was.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
This is like right now.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
It just happened.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
This is ongoing.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
They haven't corrected him.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
They're not stopping this.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
This is just going to go on because the nature of this is exactly what we've said.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
They plan to normalize this.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
This is the new normal.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Transfection works.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
And we're just going to roll out transfection for lots and lots of things because the FDA is going to let them and they're not going to stop.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
They're not going to stop.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
And we need to stop them.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
We're going to stop them by teaching this biology, the contradiction of it.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
So, listen carefully.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
I'm going to stop it a lot, but I've got to.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Okay. So, just a little bit about the past.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
And so, we're dealing with what really is a relatively new technology.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
So, going back to 1965 when liposomes were first discovered,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
and ourselves to remember the day, right?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
We've all been in this field for a long time.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
So, in 1987, cateonic lipid nucleic acid complexes were discovered.

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
So, this was the first instance where we could actually introduce genetic material into a cell.

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
The first liposomal product or the first nanomedicine containing cancer drug docile was approved by the FDA.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
That was 95.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
And then, this was triggered an avalanche of products.

37:27.000 --> 37:33.000
More than 10 liposomal nanomedicine products were approved by the FDA primarily in the anti-cancer field.

37:34.000 --> 37:45.000
And so, this actually established a huge body of knowledge that we draw now in terms of what kind of characteristics the systems have to have in order to be potentially one day a therapeutic.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
In 2001, the first ionizable cateonic lipos, that was in contrast to the permanently positive echart.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
So, I'm just going to answer the question in the girl rocks here just because it's a relevant one.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
So, most vaccines are not transfections.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Most previous vaccines were some combination of recombinant proteins.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
That means proteins that were grown in a bacteria.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
And then, those proteins are combined with a chemical irritant called an adjuvant.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
So, it could have been an aluminum-derived salt.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
It could have been a diphtheria protein that was attached to the antigen of choice.

38:25.000 --> 38:34.000
So, there's lots of different ways that the vaccines are adjuvanted or that the immune system's attention is grabbed by a vaccine.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
But this is the first time in history that we've transfected people and hoped that their immune system would pay attention to the transfection in the right way.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
So, in that sense, then, look at this list that he's using.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
The 2018 lipid nanoparticle approval by the FDA is actually a small interfering RNA,

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
which I've come to recently understand is a small double-stranded RNA derived from a hairpin

39:05.000 --> 39:13.000
that can downregulate our endogenous RNAs for which it is homologous, or it has overlapping sequence with.

39:14.000 --> 39:22.000
This was approved as a single treatment for something in 2018, but it's a small interfering RNA.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
It's not expression of a protein.

39:28.000 --> 39:37.000
And so, you're not challenging your immune system to do anything other than to clear that double-stranded small interfering RNA.

39:38.000 --> 39:47.000
In this scenario where you start to transfect people to a foreign protein, you are challenging the immune system not to make a mistake

39:48.000 --> 39:57.000
and build auto-immunity to the cells which express that foreign protein, but to make an immune response to that foreign protein alone,

39:58.000 --> 40:06.000
and then hope that the immune response that your system chooses to make is relevant when that protein or a derivative of it

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
is exposed, you are exposed to it in the wild.

40:10.000 --> 40:18.000
So, the whole pretense of transfection as a vaccine is already ridiculous, and in fact, as I start the streams all the time,

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
any combination of substances that you inject in your muscle with the intent of augmenting the immune system is probably dumb.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
And so, my kids have had more shots than me because I've only had the childhood schedule than it was around in the 70s.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I'm 51, almost 52.

40:36.000 --> 40:48.000
And my kids got the same, they're up to date more or less in the United States schedule, even though we came here from Europe because they kind of made us get up to date.

40:49.000 --> 41:01.000
And we have avoided HPV because we got lucky and finally woke up, and we've always avoided flu, but that's just because I don't, I thought that the flu was a dumb vaccine

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
and the other ones were good. You know, I was lost.

41:05.000 --> 41:14.000
So, just to make sure that you understand where I am and I appreciate the question, that's really the situation.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
I woke up in 22, so I'm not, I don't have a lot of skin in the game.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
I'm actually lucky that my children are as uninjured as they are.

41:25.000 --> 41:31.000
So, my point is, is that this single-stranded RNA therapy is not even a transfection.

41:32.000 --> 41:47.000
So, this approval, this sequence of approval that's above my head here is misleading because it's really, it's not the approval of lipid nanoparticles, it's the approval of their combination with other things.

41:48.000 --> 42:00.000
So, the idea, for example, that maybe this works, maybe these can work, but transfection is a whole other application of it.

42:01.000 --> 42:11.000
And then worse yet, it's an application that's kind of antithetical to a lot of the other ways that they want to use it, and that's where we're going to, we're going to see where these contradictions become mammoth.

42:12.000 --> 42:23.000
Large cationic lipids that were devised in 1987, so that was 2001, and obviously that's played a big role in the products that we're currently talking about.

42:24.000 --> 42:38.000
The first RNA, RNAi product on patro, which uses ionizable lipids are approved by the FDA in 2018, and then, of course, the lipid nanoparticles that enabled the COVID-19 vaccines were approved in 2021.

42:39.000 --> 42:46.000
So, that was the most, you know, this is the, I guess, the largest or the biggest new drug ever approved in history.

42:46.000 --> 42:53.000
So, you can say, okay, this isn't bad going, maybe we should just quit here, but there's an awful lot more to come.

42:54.000 --> 43:05.000
So, I just want to go back to basics a little bit, and all of this success really comes from optimizing a delivery system, and you can put these things down in relatively simplistic forms, and you've seen some of that already this morning.

43:05.000 --> 43:16.000
But, you know, the liposomal lipid nanoparticles, we can pack in 100,000 molecules of a cancer drug into these 100 nanometer systems, and they're ideal systems for delivery of cancer drugs wherever you want them.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
The trick is we have to get them to deliver their contents there, and I'll say more about that in a moment.

43:21.000 --> 43:37.000
And then we have the hybrid systems that have not only a core, a hydrophilic core, where, say, the mRNA or sRNA is, but also have a lipid, an oil core that contains these ionizable lipids in the neutral form.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
This is all the pH 7.4.

43:39.000 --> 43:48.000
So, all of this success, all of what I have to talk about, and we'll talk about a bit more, stems from these readings.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
Small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, small interfering RNA.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Any simple delivery systems, if we didn't have these, we wouldn't have got anywhere.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
So, there's certain achievements and issues for small molecule drugs, and you'll have to watch the time here.

44:04.000 --> 44:12.000
We can load essentially any small molecule that we want into a lipid nanoparticle, a liposomal system.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
We can adjust the rate of release. We can achieve long circuits. We can have them circulating around for 24 hours or longer.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
Clinically, and it's accessing most tissues in the body, a clinically validated approach.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
We have some certain issues. We can't target particular cells or tissues.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
And this has all been a bugbear in the liposomal area, and we can't achieve preferential release on arrival in target tissues.

44:33.000 --> 44:41.000
And so, some potential solutions here are targeting, unfortunately, in 40 years of trying, maybe it's longer than that now.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
And the targeting field has been a tremendous number of efforts.

44:45.000 --> 44:52.000
But there hasn't yet been a liposomal targeted drug that's got into the clinic and made it through to being...

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
This is certainly not for ones of trying. Everybody wants to target.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
It's never made it into the clinic and made it through. It's never made it into the clinic and it made it through.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
They cannot target particular tissues. They can't target particular tissues.

45:07.000 --> 45:15.000
It's never made it in from the clinic to... It's just never made it. Never, ever made it. It's never made it.

45:15.000 --> 45:23.000
Cannot achieve preferential drug release on arrival and target tissues. It's never done it.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
They cancer drugs more specifically to where they're supposed to go.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
It's more obvious if you put something on the outside, you should be able to do that.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
But we haven't come close to being able to do that yet.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
And that's for a lot of reasons. But we hate to where they're supposed to go.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
It's more obvious if you put something on the outside, you should be able to do that.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
But we haven't come close to being able to do that yet. And that's for a lot of reasons.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
The other potential solution is triggered release in the region of a tumor, which is kind of the way that we're going.

45:51.000 --> 45:57.000
And so we've now developed... We're now developing, interestingly, triggered release hybrid systems

45:57.000 --> 46:05.000
that have a hydrophobic component and a compartment that encapsulates the cancer drug or whatever it is we want to deliver.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
But in the hydrophobic compartment, we have agents that might be susceptible to external radiation or an oxide nanoparticle.

46:12.000 --> 46:21.000
Now what scares me about this just a little bit is the idea that this could be the source of magnetic business.

46:21.000 --> 46:33.000
And we have seen video of people saying that there were iron oxide particles in their little jars and stuff like that.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
We have to understand, I think, that if the goal really was to just make this normal,

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
if the goal was really to roll a bunch of this stuff out and get some data about it,

46:44.000 --> 46:52.000
it's very possible that some batches were rolled out with this kind of garbage in it for the exact multiple purpose.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
Of course, to test the tolerance of them and what would happen if we used them in humans,

46:59.000 --> 47:07.000
whether or not it would bring about immunity, all of these things they were curious about and what better way to do it than this way.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
And then what they did was just even more diabolical.

47:11.000 --> 47:21.000
They used these stories in these limited places where they saw this stuff and they used it as debunking stuff, debunking stories.

47:21.000 --> 47:37.000
And lots of people, you will recall lots of people were putting vaccine under the microscope and pretending that they could see stuff or not see stuff.

47:37.000 --> 47:49.000
Some people saw hydras, other people checked to make sure there weren't hydras, other people looked for, you know,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
and they knew that we would do that.

47:51.000 --> 48:00.000
More importantly, maybe the better way to say it is was that many of the people who were doing that were doing it because they were part of it, that they were told to do it.

48:00.000 --> 48:09.000
They were told to report those findings, they were told to debunk those findings.

48:09.000 --> 48:19.000
And we got distracted by them, we got bamboozled by them into thinking that that was just another mystery to solve, oh my goodness.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
It's really diabolical what they're doing to us, it's really diabolical.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
For gold nanoparticles.

48:28.000 --> 48:37.000
So the idea here is of course if there's a tumor, this is a CT scan of a tumor in the liver that we know where that is, where the boundaries are.

48:37.000 --> 48:47.000
We zap that in some way by external RF, X-ray laser, high intensity focused ultrasound, whatever the stimulation is and cause release of the lipid nanoparticles as they flow through that area.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And so that's the simplistic approach.

48:50.000 --> 48:59.000
What we've achieved so far are systems where we do have these are these are an oxide nanoparticles or gold nanoparticles together with a drug.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
This is a drug that talks through this and this inside these systems.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
But we haven't gotten to explode yet.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
So it's the explosion part here.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
If anybody has any good ideas, we're certainly game to try them.

49:09.000 --> 49:17.000
But this will revolutionize cancer chemotherapy if we can actually get the drug released to where we in the area that we want to.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
And this is obviously we have very good ways now detecting where cancers are.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
So we just need to get more drug there.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
Only 0.01% of the drug administered systemically of cancer drugs actually gets to a tumor.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
That's kind of criminal really.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I'm sorry. What Peter, can you repeat that again for me Peter?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Because that's a really interesting thing to say out loud.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
It's a really interesting thing to say out loud.

49:43.000 --> 49:51.000
I've actually been saying this for about 10 years that the whole idea of looking for a cure for cancer is a joke.

49:51.000 --> 49:57.000
Because almost all the cancers that are caused are caused by multi factorial things.

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
And if there are genetic versions of cancer, they're not giving you any insight into how the rest of cancer forms.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
And they spend billions of dollars on it.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Listen to what Peter Cullis says here.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Listen carefully.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm going to mute the heater in the background.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Cancers are.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
So we just need to get more drug there.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
Only 0.01% of the drug administered systemically of cancer drugs actually gets to a tumor.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
That's kind of criminal really.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
I mean you consider how toxic these drugs are.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Did you hear it?

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Did you hear it?

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
Only 0.1% of cancer drugs gets to the tumor.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
And that's actually kind of criminal if you think about it given the toxicity of these drugs.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
And how expensive are these drugs?

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
Are these toxins pretty cheap that they give to these cancer patients?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Oh, they're not cheap.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Oh, I see.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
So they.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
So how is it?

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Say it again, Peter.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
How do cancer drugs work?

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Obviously we have very good ways now detecting where cancers are.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
So we just need to get more drug there.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
Only 0.01% of the drug administered systemically of cancer drugs actually gets to a tumor.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
That's because it's kind of criminal really.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I mean you consider how toxic these drugs are.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
And so this is a.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Despite many people saying this will never work.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
We still keep on working on this in the lab.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
So we'll.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Until it will continue with this for a while.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
No, he didn't.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
No, he didn't.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
No, no.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Really.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I mean you consider how toxic these drugs are actually gets to a tumor.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
That's because kind of the drug administered systemically of cancer drugs actually gets to it there.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
We have very good ways now detecting where cancers are.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So we just need to get more drug there.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Only 0.01% of the drug administered system.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
0.01% yes to a tumor.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
That's because kind of criminal really.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I mean you consider how toxic these drugs are.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
And so this is a.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Despite many people saying this will never work.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
We still keep on working on this in the lab.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
So we'll.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
We'll.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Until it.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
We'll continue with this for a while yet.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
Okay, I'm going to have to move along with a bit of more speed here.

52:15.000 --> 52:22.000
But the hybrid and with the nucleic acid based drugs, obviously we can load pretty much any nucleic acid we want.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So if you caught this, that these are hybrids.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
So what we were told was that they were lipid nanoparticles and that's it.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
But actually they're using hybrid lipid nanoparticles, which is what he showed in the very beginning here.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
This is at 809.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
So I'm going to go back and show you that slide.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
He is looking at.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
These guys are hybrid oil core lipid nanoparticles.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
So these are the ones they apparently used for MRNA and that's not the shape.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
Of the lipid nanoparticle that we were shown on the news hour.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
That's for sure.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
And so now I'm going to go back to eight.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
And there we are.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
So here, look, just read this for me really quick, just so you know where we are.

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
Can transfect immune cells following intramuscular administration for vaccines?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
That's the achievement.

53:14.000 --> 53:22.000
Can load small interfering RNA, messenger RNA, or plasmid DNA of essentially any size?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Great.

53:24.000 --> 53:30.000
We can transfect immune cells following intramuscular administration for vaccines.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Let's think about how dumb that is.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Think about how spectacularly dumb that is.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
How many resident immune cells are sitting in your deltoid muscle?

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
How many of these lipid nanoparticles stay in your deltoid muscle?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
How long do they stay in your neph...

53:45.000 --> 53:54.000
They just got through telling you they can't target any tissue.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
They just got through telling you that the lipid nanoparticles won't go where they're told

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
that they stay in circulation, that we can put them close on the outside, but we can't

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
get them to go.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
Do you understand they say things out of both sides of their mouth?

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
You can't say that we can transfect immune cells following intramuscular administration

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
for vaccines unless you explain it a little more than that.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
What immune cells are you talking about?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
How many of them are there?

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
Where do they migrate back to?

54:29.000 --> 54:36.000
Like, I don't understand how it is that somebody can take them that we can be here unless this is

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
like the result of...

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
He can't possibly believe this.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
That they just get lucky and then what?

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
The rest of the muscle gets transfected and it just ignores it.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
There's lots of protein produced.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It only lasts for a few hours.

54:55.000 --> 55:03.000
What is he telling himself to believe that that is an achievement, but you can't target

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
extra hepatic tissues.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
You cannot achieve preferential transfection.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
You cannot access privileged organs.

55:09.000 --> 55:16.000
Well, you can if somebody already has a perforated blood-brain barrier or a perforated gut, which

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
a lot of people do have because of the highly processed foods that they eat and the glyphosate

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
and all this other crap.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
So many assumptions are being made here.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Listen carefully.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Any size.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
We can transfect immune cells with IM, transfected parasites with IV, clinically validated.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Extra hepatic tissue is still a problem.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
And it was over.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
That's it.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
That's it.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
That's all you're going to get.

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
That's the explanation for how it is that they can put it in your muscle and get those immune cells.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
That's it.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
He barely even said a complete sentence about it.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
Are you kidding me?

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
We're done with the nucleic acid based drugs.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
Obviously we can load pretty much any nucleic acid we want of essentially any size.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
We can transfect immune cells with IM, transfected parasites with IV, clinically validated.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
It's already gone.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Do you see it?

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
It's unbelievable.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
What was in the first slide, the greatest achievement, you know, it's like worth a Nobel prize.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Like, oh my gosh, it's my culmination of my life's work.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah, we can do that.

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
It's gone in a flash because it doesn't work.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
It doesn't work.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
He's transfecting all kinds of other cells that he doesn't know and can't control when he says he's transfecting immune cells.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
That's the way it has to be.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
It can't be any other way.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Because of everything he's ever said since we've been watching him.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Thank you, Robert Malone, for showing us the way.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
Without Robert Malone's sub-stack, giving Peter Kullis credit for at least a third of the Nobel prize,

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
I would have never watched a video of this guy and found out that he gives talks like this.

57:07.000 --> 57:14.000
That he's touring around the world giving talks like this where he says they can't control where they go.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Can't control how they release.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
They've been trying for 40 years, but they can't inject him in your muscle and augment your immune system

57:23.000 --> 57:29.000
as if those three statements can go together and not clash.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
Extra-epatic tissue is still a problem, preferential expression.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
Extra-epatic tissues are still an issue.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
Privileged organs, we can't access those via the circulation, but of course there's other ways of doing that.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
There's massive opportunities here from a future point of view that remain for these currently available systems.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
This is the cartoon you've already seen from Miffy with the mRNA in one compartment

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
and the ionized will lip in the oform into another compartment.

58:01.000 --> 58:10.000
Very simple systems, but these are the systems that work very well for vaccine and for ephatocyte transfection opportunities.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
So they work for vaccines and they work when you want to hit the liver.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Do you see how silly that is?

58:16.000 --> 58:24.000
So basically he's telling you that when they put it in your muscle, they basically hit your liver.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
The liver cleans your blood.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
The liver is a filter for your blood, so surprise, surprise.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
That's where it comes out, but that's not the only place.

58:35.000 --> 58:47.000
Any capillaries that it gets to, any small vessels it gets to, capillaries in the heart, done.

58:47.000 --> 58:54.000
Anywhere where the fluid pressure or whatever gets close enough so that these lipid nanoparticles come in very close contact

58:54.000 --> 59:02.000
with the bilayer membrane of the epithelial cells you've got transfection.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
So it's again like the talk we looked at the other day where they could shift it, you know,

59:06.000 --> 59:13.000
if they could get it 70% in the liver and 30% in the ovaries or wherever they wanted to go

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
and then they could change a fat on the outside and now it's only 50% in the liver and 45% in the ovaries.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
So clearly targeting is possible and so all we need are five more grants and 40 more years

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
and we'll be able to put it exactly where we want to put it.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
All we need is five more grants and 40 more years and we'll be able to

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
transfect your immune system usefully.

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
Just like Robert Malone when he was in his post-docs with Murray Gardner and with Indurma Verma

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
or whatever the hell his name was and getting all his patents stolen.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
He was dreaming of curing childhood diseases by being a geneticist in a hospital

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
and he thought that there would be geneticists in every hospital curing childhood diseases using retroviruses.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Just a few more grants and 40 more years and we'll be able to do it.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We are still running in this hamster wheel where we are eventually going to become gods

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and that's just really the evolution of this discussion because if you keep talking smack

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
about what you're going to do but it never comes true then you got to keep talking more smack

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
so that you actually haven't reached the goal that you claimed you were going to reach.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And so what started out is the Heunman genome project has morphed into

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
let's just bamboozle the earth and roll out

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
transfection and transformation and screw these people.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
We're just going to do it whether they like it or not and we're going to force it on them

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
because this is the only way that we're going to get the way we're going to get where we want to go

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
which is becoming masters of our genome I guess.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And this guy is probably just an innocent chemist physicist who's assuming with the look away doctrine

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
like they use in the military where you know those people are doing some really unethical things over there

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and they probably shouldn't be doing that well we just don't look over there then.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And so he's just assuming that these biologists are using his technology in a way that is righteous and good

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
and he's not going to look at the details too much he's not going to think about the details too much

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
he's told you very honestly

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
so assuming they figured out how it works or assuming that when it goes other places it doesn't matter

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
that was also something that he's assuming then and you could just probably ask him what happens

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:04.000
when you transfect ovary cells or testicle cells or you know cells that aren't in the liver

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:12.000
that aren't supposed to be full of toxins right what happens when you transfect those

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
what happens when you transfect the endothelial cells of the heart

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
what happens when you transfect myocardial cells like heart muscle

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
what happens when you transfect breast tissue

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
what happens when you when you transfect I don't know uterine tissue

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000
or we just don't know any of these answers and we definitely know from his talk that they're not going to stay in the

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000
muscle that they're going to go all kinds of places we know from biorum brittle whistle blowing of the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
document from Japan that it goes all over the place including the bone marrow for goodness sakes

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and yet he has the gall to say that they can that they can transfect what did he say they can transfect immune cells

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
that's got to be the most specific target in the body

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
the most distributed target in the body like it's absurd

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and so we're just starting with this I mean the COVID-19 vaccines are just a start you're going to see vaccines

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
and all these areas including bacterial infections that are starting to come online

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and so the mRNA revolution in terms of vaccine is just gathering steam similarly in therapeutics

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000
but of course you know that's the reason why the clown car was talking about prion disease and amyloidosis

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
for the first three years of the pandemic and trying to blame it on a spike protein

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
you must understand that the whole reason why they were doing that was because they knew that

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:05.000
they needed it to be seeded that the virus was capable of doing these fantastic feats of protein misfolding diseases

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
so that when they rolled this stuff out there would already be something to blame it on a virus

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
oh my gosh did you really did you do you have like do you do you have like a prion disease did he die of a prion disease

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000
wow it must have been from the COVID must have been from the SARS-CoV-2 couldn't have been from the transfection right

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:36.000
and that's the magic of these these people that were set up to say that the spike protein is so bad for you

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:46.000
heretofore unprecedented bad protein is on the virus is on the virus is on the virus the virus the virus

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
transfecting you to it is fine apparently because it's codon optimized so it's not even the same protein anyway

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
the contradictions are as big as a woolly mammoth

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and as rotten

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
and once you start to list them to see them to watch them in real time and to reflect on what these people said

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and how they said it because how they said it is important

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
you know a humble person that's wrong is not such a big deal

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
a arrogant

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
dismissive

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
racist

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
ugly

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
insulting

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
aggressive person who's also a hundred percent wrong

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and actually responsible for ceding the worst case scenario narrative

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
despite evidence to the contrary

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
and is still trying to see the worst case scenario narrative about the virus

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:01.000
as opposed to just teaching the basic flaws of transfection the basic shortcomings of lipid nanoparticles

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
the basic shortcomings of the biology that they have used to bamboozle us

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
they spend their time talking about bioweapons and ever expanding list of bioweapons

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
and ever expanding list of Scooby-Doo mysteries to solve

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
ever list of Scooby-Doo villains to unmask

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
when it all comes down to a few people telling a lie at the rest of the people going along with it

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and most of it being murder

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that's the magic of this

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and as long as you listen to all these other people shuffling paper around in the back rooms

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
trying to distract us with other news stories

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
or you listen to these people on the fringes of the internet trying to take

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Mark Coolack's work and turn it into somebody else's

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
or even worse turn it into something that no one can use

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
if you don't see it for what it is

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I don't know how to help you

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
but every one of these things is lining up now because this is falling apart

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and because we are continuing to focus steady pressure on what is falling apart

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
what is falling apart is the narrative of a spreading pathogen

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
called a coronavirus that was novel for our immune system

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
that could be detected by a PCR test

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
that could be sequenced over 15,000 times in the first year and a half of the pandemic

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
that could transmit faithfully

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
for almost four years and tracked phylogenetically

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
for almost four years in a way that is unprecedented

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
for any other RNA molecule in history

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and rather than use your time and energy

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
dismantling that fundamentally ridiculous mythology

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
they want you to chase the mythology of bioweapons

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
they want you to chase the mythology of genocide

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
they want you to chase the mythology of all these other things

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that may or may not be true but they are not true yet

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
what is true right now is that this has been a great big ball of BS

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and there is a lot of professional biologists that should know

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
that this is the story

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
the story is not the spike protein

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
the story is not a lab leak

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
the story is a very concerted effort to mislead us into believing

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that the worst case scenario of a lab leak is possibly happening right now

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
therefore we all must throw everything out the window

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and follow the orders

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
and many many many many people going along with that

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
created an illusion of consensus that was almost irresistible for everyone

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
including me in you

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and that illusion of consensus is still being sustained by people who understand

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
that this biology has incredible limitations

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
but shrug their shoulders and say well I guess it's not all I thought it was

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
because we tested it on 3 billion people

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I'll just give a few examples of this cardiovascular disease heart disease

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
heart failure, cancer, sickle cell anemia

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
the list is going to I mean it's pretty much every disease that you care to name

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
pretty much every disease you care to name

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
will have a vaccine

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
they're not going to call them therapeutics it's going to be a heart failure

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
vaccine it's going to be a cancer vaccine

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
you heard Bruce Gowski talking about this

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
these are not going to be called therapeutics they're going to be called vaccines

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
my ladies and gentlemen my friends my family my my fellow

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
you see where this is going

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
this is from two weeks ago

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
he's still telling the truth and still can't hear himself tell it

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
he's still telling the truth to groups of people who can't hear him tell it

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
because they think that 3 billion people is the largest

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
randomized control trial that's ever been executed

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that this rapid rollout of therapeutics

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and vaccines based on transfection is a great idea

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
this is red alert style bad news

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
because we are being distracted by a lot of other things right now

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
a lot of other things right now that have nothing to do with this central thing

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
this central thing

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
the inversion of your children's rights to permissions based on this

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.000
your children's sovereignty inverted into permissions based on biology

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
that is really lies

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
it's mythology

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
they are misleading us that they have this fundamental understanding

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:36.000
and high fidelity understanding at that when they do not

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
and for some reason this physicist chemist seems to admit it without understanding it

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
it really shows how much of a biologist he isn't really

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.000
that he can give this talk and not understand the implications of it

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
you're augmenting a pattern integrity

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
the homeostatic mechanisms of which you don't understand

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
the immunological mechanisms of which you don't understand

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
and you're attempting to augment this pattern integrity with an RNA

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
that you think will express a protein wherever it goes

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and you know that you can't control wherever it goes

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
and yet you think that you can augment the immune system usefully with this tool

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I don't think that he believes that in his heart of hearts

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I don't think that he can believe that but he's been told that

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
he's been made comfortable because of that if he believes in it

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:46.000
his salary success and fame are dependent on him believing that

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000
even if he knows in his heart of hearts that it can't be true

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
that's where we are right now ladies and gentlemen there's no other way to characterize this

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
he just told you that isn't it criminal that we basically poison cancer patients

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
and he didn't realize he said it

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
that's criminal if you think about it

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
that's criminal if you think about it so what's the

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
then don't think about it I guess is that the advice

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
ladies and gentlemen wake up they're telling us right to our face

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and they don't think we're smart enough to hear it

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.000
this guy's actually not smart enough to hear it I really don't think he is

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I really think the fame and the fortune and the praise has gone to his head

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and he's just said you know I'm making some stuff you guys want to use it

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
for whatever you want to use it for that's great maybe that's why he didn't get the Nobel Prize because

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
in the end you know he doesn't know how they're using it biologically

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
he knows how the cartoon looks he knows how the cartoon sounds he knows what the sales pitch is

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
but he doesn't know the depth and the breadth of the simplification that's being done there

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
he doesn't know the depth and the breadth of the pattern integrity that he's trying to

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
augment and if he did then he would feel ashamed

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
and he'd be sad that his technology was used in such a

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
with such hubris that's what I think

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
others obviously but the others that we can't attack through the liver

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000
but an amazing number that we can this is the from a vaccine point of view we're going to see a universal flu vaccine

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
very soon this is an example for we have an nanoparticle containing

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:49.000
say four proteins from from a given flu influenza virus and that's being challenged with this injected

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
in the mice as a vaccine and being challenged with very different strains of the influenza

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
and you see total protection so this is certainly going to make its way hopefully we're going to be in a situation

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
you don't have to change every year you're certainly going to make its way

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
so what are they doing then?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I guess they're challenging these mices mices internationally with some

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I mean can you read that graph do you do you see how stupid it is?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Can anybody put it in the chat how dumb it is what this graph says

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
what is an LD50?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Does anybody know what an LD50 is?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000
an LD50 is the lethal dose that kills 50% of the animals in an experiment

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:45.000
they're using five times the lethal dose of the virus and they're putting it in somewhere

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:52.000
and the what the animals that don't get the injection die

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I don't they don't lose they don't lose weight what is the dotted line where they sacrifice them

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:08.000
are we to believe that those animals die because they sacrifice them at 70 or 85%

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
75% of their body weight

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
what if those animals would just come right back up right after that

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
we would never know because this one is designed not to let them happen

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
look this one goes right down to the dotted line they didn't kill those animals

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
five times the lethal dose 50% lethal dose

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.000
of what an intranasal injection of something so that it kills 50% of the animals that get it

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I mean

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
if it's

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
you know what they're doing here right they're using clones that's the other thing that you see here

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
that that's what this whole thing is these are clones

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
that's what they're putting up here these are clones

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
they're not I mean

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000
the universal influenza vaccine is coming and it's going to be an mRNA so you're going to be transfected

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
if you take it

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
and so

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:33.000
heretofore unknown consequences of repeated transfection to a wide variety of

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
of

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
foreign proteins

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
an ion channel

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
an enzyme

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
a RNA structural protein

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
isn't hemagglutinine also a

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
enzyme I mean

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
how do they know that they've usefully augmented the immune system of these mice

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
how do they know that they don't

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000
what they know is that in two weeks these animals didn't die and in two weeks some of these animals

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
were sacrificed at

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I guess they died I don't know I just don't understand this

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
the push

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
ever forward more vaccines

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
very different strains of the influenza and you see total protection

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
so this is certainly going to make its way

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
hopefully we're going to be in a situation you don't have to change every year

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
your flu vaccine

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
here's a treatment for heart failure using CAR-T approaches

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
this has worked from

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Andrew Weisman who I say

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
QEDIS is also involved in this

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and so a QEDIS his company is involved with Weisman

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
running a treatment for heart failure

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
where T cells are apparently

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
controlling activated fibroblasts

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and this is probably some mouse model of heart failure

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
that you know they can fix with this

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
little it looks like they're putting a little pump

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
inside the animal here

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
they're injecting

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I don't know what they do here

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
this is probably how they create the

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
the heart problem with this thing

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and then they they inject the

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
the lipid nanoparticle to fix it

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and then they come back and it's okay

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
so saline saline

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
angiotens in two

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I don't know what that does but it probably does something funny

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
we could look that up

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
and

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
so in this case

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
heart injury

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and then going in with a lipid nanoparticle

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
targeted to T cells

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
with antibodies against a CD5

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
it's just for T cells and they contain

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
mRNA coding for a car

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
against the fibroblast activation protein

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
so they go in there they're removing the scar tissue

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
and you can see regaining

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
or reducing fibrosis and regaining heart function

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
do you see a reduction here

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
between this one and that one

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
it says that it's reduced

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
the bar look but look at the spread here

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
look at the spread here

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
there's animals that are down here

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
right here too

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
is this a real significant result

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
or is this the broken science

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
initiative problem here

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
where because the end numbers are low enough

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and because the variation is high enough

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
this is not actually a significant result

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
but with statistics

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
we can make it powerful

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
this is the magic that the broken science initiative

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
is trying to dispel

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
this is the spell right here

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
in a nutshell where you measure things

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
and think somehow that these results are

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
collectively represent something

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
that you can characterize using statistics

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
that you have an idea of what the mean value is

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
if you look at these numbers

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
when in reality

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
you're counting on the fact

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
that the inbred mice

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
are really inbred enough

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
to be uniformed

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
so that they're not contributing to this variation

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
you think that your experiment that you ran

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
and how you ran it is uniform enough

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
so that it doesn't contribute to this variation

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
you think that your experimenters

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
and the animal caretakers have not contributed

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
at all to this experiment

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
even though it goes for three weeks

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
and so their day-night cycle

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
they're handling by caretakers

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
the cleaning cages

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
the whole thing matters

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and so the variation that's in this experiment

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
is assumed to be exclusively from the manipulation that they do

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
but in reality we know that this is biology

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
so that's not possible

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
to get that far down without a really beautiful experiment

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and it doesn't look like this is that

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
that's the difficulty of this going forward

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
is that we're going to have to accept

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
how much charlatism

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000
charlatism is our current state of medicine is based on

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
and also understand that we are up against

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
that charlatism as well as the charlatism

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
of the worst-case scenario of people

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Team worst-case scenario

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
which has been on duty since the end of 2019 early 2020

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
and is still on duty now

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
pushing more stories

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
ever-expanding list of bioweapons

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
ever-expanding list of possibilities

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
ever-expanding list of predictions

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
that are coming right around the corner

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and never copying to the fact that

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
there was no evidence of spread

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
never copying to the fact that the biology of RNA

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
doesn't support a pandemic

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
never mind the fact that we've never tracked

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
a single RNA molecule from a spill

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
in a in a wet market

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
around the world for four years

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
with a really high fidelity phylogeny before

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
and so it's pretty remarkable

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
that in the midst of this

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
catastrophic failure of public health systems

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
we managed to get such a beautiful biological data set

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
once you say it out loud it just sounds so absurd

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I mean the whole story just falls apart on its absurdity

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
so this is kind of a neat thing to be able to do

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
on patro

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
which is a where we're taking sRNA

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
to knock down a pathological protein

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
trans-thyroidin

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
this can be done now using a gene editing approach

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
where we essentially knock out

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
the trans-thyroidin in the liver

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
and you can see here

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
this was a one-and-done therapy

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
for this particular disorder

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
so these are these are huge opportunities

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
so that was CRISPR-Cas9

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
in the liver of monkeys

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
to edit away an enzyme

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
this is actually

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
he's about to talk about glucose 6-phosphate

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
if you remember

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
a little while ago

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
we actually had this lady on

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and she talked about

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
the glucose 6-phosphate

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
protein circled here in red

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
whose job it is

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
is to

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
to release stored sugars

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
so that you can maintain

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
a healthy blood sugar level

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
while you're fasting

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
so Von Gerge's disease patients

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
can't fast

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
they must constantly eat

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
small amounts of carbohydrates

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
including getting up every one or two hours

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
during the night

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
to eat raw corn starch

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
now imagine the toll that this takes on parents

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
and so this lady told us

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
this story three years ago

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
in reference to

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
how mRNA is going to change the world

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
and now this guy still selling the same story

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
and it's still Moderna

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
so that's kind of interesting right?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
we're going to tell the same story again

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
how about how we're going to fix this

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
with an mRNA

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
this is the same sales pitch

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
this is the same grant proposal

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
it hasn't gone any farther than this

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
so they're actually running out of schtick too

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
they're running out of sales pitch

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
it's starting to get old already

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
and it's going to start to fray

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000
really rapidly over the next few weeks

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
as we approach the new year

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
it's going to fray really rapidly

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
as we just lay it out step by step

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
what's wrong with these things?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and it's so fortunate that we have Peter Cullis

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
to tell us exactly what's wrong with these things

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
to exactly lay out the limitations of them

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
to exactly tell us what we need to know

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
and we don't need to prove it anymore

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
with elaborate citations and everything

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
we can just let the master speak

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
and it's just beautiful

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and the master says things like

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
it's a criminal thing

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
that chemotherapy is used the way

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
it's used

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I totally agree Dr. Cullis

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
placement and I'm just going to go through these relatively quickly

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
but as soon as a child is born

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
they're not making a particular protein

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
often you get in these situations

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
the child will die

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
if they don't get to get a particular

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
replacement protein for that

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
all of these types of disorders

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
are going to be very rapidly treated

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
using these 7P approach

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
within a couple of months we can devise this medicine

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
as soon as we know what the protein is

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
that the child is not making

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
and so in this case G6P

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
with the now part is containing G6P

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
for glycogen storage disease

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
that is that IV will be made in the liver

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
and this is an example for

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
minus-minus mice with the G6P

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and you can see that we can then

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
restore the levels of that protein

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and restore blood sugar levels etc.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Propionic anomasodemius

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
is an example where propionylcoic

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
or difarboxylase is not made

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
and again this is a

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
toxic molecule that results

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
from the lack of that protein

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
if you administer the lipid nanoparticle

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
containing mRNA that codes for it

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
so then you basically bring things back to normal

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
if you can't see

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
so there again that's a problem

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
because you can't replace a protein

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
that you don't have it will be a foreign protein

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
your immune system will attack it

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
it won't have tolerance to it

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
so that's a tricky thing

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
you can do that on the short term

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
it's pretty hard for me to imagine

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
how they do it on the longer term

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
if they have to repeatedly inject

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and here you see something that's really creepy

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
where they have

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
a hybrid kind of antibody that uses

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
well anyway

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I don't really know how to explain that one too well

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I would have to read the paper

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
but the mRNA codes for

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
a antibody

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
that ends up doing this

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
so it's a bi-specific antibody

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
which means that it's an antibody

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
which has two different things

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
on its receptor things

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
which is also

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
it's not natural

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
so I don't

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I'm not saying that this doesn't work

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
in a cancer you know thing

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
or as a cancer therapy I'm just saying that now they're making

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
he's talking about transfecting people with

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
antibodies which are essentially synthetic

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
they're synthetically designed

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
their variable region is designed

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
they are made

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
like any other monoclonal antibody

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
no they're not they're going to be made

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
by mRNA

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
so that's a very

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
tricky added level of complexity

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
if now they're

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
purporting to design novel antibodies

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
which they will then express

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
by lipid nanoparticle

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
now it's just not a protein

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
that your immune system will

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
will process it

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
faithfully but now it's a protein

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
that should have a function

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
that you hope will manifest faithfully

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
and I think we're adding

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
even more complexity to

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
to the unknowns that are

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
transfection when we start

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
transfecting

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
designer antibodies into people with the idea

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
of novel cell interactions

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
being

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
facilitated by these antibodies

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
not saying they won't work

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'm just saying that I think a lot of assumptions

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
are being made and we are

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
a bull in a china shop

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
if we think that we can augment a healthy

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
immune system or augment a healthy

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
human with these kinds

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
of technologies so this is probably

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
a cancer thing so great

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
whatever

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
if it's somebody's dying and this is the way

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
you give them eight more years of life

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
perfect but when we talk about

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
and we hand wave

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
when we use this to augment the immune system

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
it drives me bananas

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
because there's plenty of reason

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
to use it on cancer patients that aren't going to survive

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
it's plenty of reason maybe

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
to try and replace

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
or fix people with

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
genetic deficiencies that are

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
debilitating or whatever

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
but Jesse Gelsinger

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
would still be alive

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
maybe he wouldn't be happy

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but I kind of think his dad

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and he would be happier than he they are now

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
and so you're

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
we just got to be careful ladies and gentlemen

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
because they really plan to

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
bamboozle us with this

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and I think it's a good place to stop

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I know that he says even more

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
nonsense up here

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
but he's already said the stuff that

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I wanted you to hear him say

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
maybe I'll use this again

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
or I'll cut some clips from the rest of it

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
and if you want to see it I'm going to drop this in the chat

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
so you can maybe watch this

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
on your own

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
this whole

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
symposium is really crazy

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
so there's this one

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
guy that I was going to put on

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
and then I found the

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
the introduction

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
by Peter

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
and this guy is basically talking about

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
how you know they're going to use

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
it for everything

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
and so it's an enthusiastic

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
next step guy

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and it's

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
it's an incredible talk to

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I don't know if I'll get around to doing a study hall on it

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
but I would recommend this one as well

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
so I'll drop that in the chat

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I am really tired though

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I actually got talked

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
into

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I got talked into doing

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
all the horses with the boys

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
and then the other coach

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
gave a lot of horses tonight

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
so after I opened my big mouth

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
that said that we're running horses from now

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I'm because we need to get

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
everybody in shape

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
then Zach put us on the

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
on the baseline and I ran a little more

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
than I wanted to so I'm okay

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I'm going to be sore tomorrow

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
but the boys ran hard too so that was really fun

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
thank you very much for joining me

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
ladies and gentlemen this has been

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
a very logical

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
a high resistance low noise

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
information brief brought to you

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
by a biologist

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
we are still trying to fight our way through this

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
it's a bunch of people

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
and you might put this slide up and say

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
there was a novel virus

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
millions of people died with millions more were saved

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
it probably came from gain of function

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
but gain of functions real for sure

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
and that's why a virus may come again

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
or you can explain it in more general terms

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
and just say it's a huge

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
chest that's being played

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
all over the world

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and this huge game of chess

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
is actually this train exercise

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
right?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
and there are competing interests

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
within this theater

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
there are competing interests

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
but this theater has all agreed

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
they were not going to talk about

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
they do not resuscitate orders

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
they're not going to talk about ventilators

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
or use of steroids

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
or remdesivir, medazolam, or opioid deaths

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and how they contribute to excess deaths

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
and we're not going to talk about

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
death certificate frauds

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
we're just going to talk about the virus

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
bio-weapons spike protein

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and mild carditis

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
and this is the train stopping exercise

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
we're just going to talk about

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
how everybody's vulnerable

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
we're just going to talk about PCR testing

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
we're just going to talk about

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
novel treatments

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
and how they're necessary for a novel virus

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
we're just going to talk about

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
protocols

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and what novel protocols are necessary

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
how remdesivir might work

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
we're just going to talk about

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
everything that doesn't make you

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
solve the puzzle

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and more importantly

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
we're going to talk about one thing

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
and we're going to coordinate

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
people's thing

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
there's going to be one VAERS expert

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
and one Ivermectin expert

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
and one hydroxychloroquine advocate

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
and one cancer advocate

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and one mild carditis

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
activist

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
and one claiming

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
the

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
RNA intellectual property

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
and we're all going to stick to our stories

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
and when we move

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
and when we shift to the next story

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
then the other people are going to shift to

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
another story too

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
so that we can all pretend

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
to be working this train at once

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
all the time not getting each other's

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
way all the time not stepping on each other's

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
toes even though we don't

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
have the time to pay attention to what each other

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
is saying

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
as long as we agree that there was a

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
novel virus that millions of people were killed

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
by and millions more were saved from

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
and the gain of function is real

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and we won't step on each other's toes

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and you can sell

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
your Ivermectin book and I can sell my

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
lies book and she can sell

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
their bio-weapons book

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
and everybody wins

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I don't know what the competing interests are

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I don't know who the teams are

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
but I do

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
know that that's what we need to find out

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
who's on

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
whose team

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
who's the boss of that team

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
who's the underlings of that team

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
how big are the teams

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that's what we need to find out

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
is there a ranking between the teams?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
are the oligarchs up here

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
and the social media

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
oligarchs up here

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
and the people in government

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
down here

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
or is it the banks

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
and then the government

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and then the oligarchs and then

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
we need to find out

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
we need to understand

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
we need to expose

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
the people who performed

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
this theater who misled us

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
and who are attempting

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
to actively mislead

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
our children

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
that's the goal

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
we've got to stop them from

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
misleading our children

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
please stop all

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
because they are trying to eliminate

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
the controlled group by any means

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
necessary please share this stream

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
with everybody that you know

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
because intramuscular injection

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
of any combination of substances

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
with the intent of augmenting

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
the immune system is dumb

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
transfection in healthy humans

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
is criminally negligent

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and viruses are not patterned

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
integrity

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
this has been a presentation

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
of the independent bright web

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
psychological

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
that's a website

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
and there you can find ways to support the stream

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
including a one-time donation

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
or a regular subscription

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
if you do tend to subscribe

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
and you become like a producer

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
or a collaborator

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
there are other ways that we can make that

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
worth your while including

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
me giving a private zoom

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
conversation to your family and friends

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
your work whenever you want

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
there's lots of ways that we can make that

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and if you want to give on biologicals

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
my website

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
if you want to support

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
please go there and do it

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
it's not going to go to waste

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I've got a lot of work planned

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
and 2024 is going to be a new level

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
of giggle and biological

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I'd love you to be a part of it

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
again you can watch the stream

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
there you can also starting next week

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
you're going to be able to download the

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
stream deck every Thursday

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
and it'll be a deck that corresponds

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
every week

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
the schedule is usually updated

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
