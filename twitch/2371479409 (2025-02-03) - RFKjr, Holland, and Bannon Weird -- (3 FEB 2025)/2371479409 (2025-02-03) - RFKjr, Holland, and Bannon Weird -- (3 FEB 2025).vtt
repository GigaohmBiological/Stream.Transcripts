00:01.101 --> 00:06.167
Beep Beep

00:21.829 --> 00:23.130
Good morning, everyone.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.751
Testing one, two.

00:24.971 --> 00:26.732
This is Gigaohm Biological.

00:26.812 --> 00:29.534
We are live at stream.gigaohm.bio.

00:29.574 --> 00:33.397
We are live on Twitch, on Rumble, and on YouTube at JC on a Bike.

00:35.218 --> 00:36.819
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

00:36.839 --> 00:37.380
Good to see you.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.302
The voice that you are hearing is that of Jonathan J. Cooey.

00:40.362 --> 00:44.625
I come to you live out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as often as I can, usually in the morning.

00:45.926 --> 00:48.247
My last name is spelled C-O-U-E-Y.

00:48.287 --> 01:00.154
You can find the stain of my chasing tenure before the pandemic on the National Library of Medicine website, PubMed, with my last name and my initials J.J.

01:00.834 --> 01:01.995
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.136
I will see you in a few minutes after the intro.

01:04.196 --> 01:12.301
Please tweet this out, share it on your social media platforms that you use, the military

01:13.405 --> 01:20.168
social control mechanisms that you still participate in, please share it and try to help people to find this work.

01:20.208 --> 01:20.788
Thank you very much.

01:43.106 --> 01:46.247
Now, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Fauci talked a lot about isolation and purification.

01:46.747 --> 01:48.547
Can you tell me what the difference is between the two?

01:50.548 --> 01:51.288
Isolation, what was it?

01:51.468 --> 01:52.588
Isolation and purification.

01:54.409 --> 01:55.129
Of the virus?

01:55.209 --> 01:55.409
Yes.

01:56.669 --> 01:58.430
Well, you isolate a virus by

02:05.248 --> 02:07.711
finding the virus which causes a disease.

02:08.371 --> 02:13.236
You purify a virus by making a lot of, I mean, just by purifying it so you get a pure virus.

02:13.797 --> 02:15.458
I don't understand what the issue.

02:15.478 --> 02:15.578
I see.

02:15.598 --> 02:16.840
No, it depends on how they used it.

02:30.694 --> 02:32.636
Well, didn't Dr. Gallo do that?

02:32.716 --> 02:34.558
I mean, he actually isolated it.

02:34.818 --> 02:38.742
So, I mean, why should I do all of this?

02:38.822 --> 02:40.904
This is all textbook stuff you're asking me.

02:46.609 --> 02:52.215
It doesn't matter much at all what you believe about vaccines until we invent really important ones.

02:52.875 --> 02:59.479
You know, until we have a pandemic that's killing everyone, you know, and it's measles plus.

02:59.579 --> 03:05.102
Okay, I can tolerate what you think about measles because not that many people die from it.

03:05.402 --> 03:13.106
It's just a big hassle in the end, but no, when we have this new pandemic that has got 75%

03:15.054 --> 03:15.814
mortality.

03:20.356 --> 03:23.698
There'll be no pretense of being polite in the face of these beliefs.

03:23.778 --> 03:26.319
It'll be a moral emergency, because it has to be.

03:28.420 --> 03:38.644
By about 1660, John Locke wrote that day laborers and tradesmen, spinsters and dairy maids, must be told what to believe.

03:39.144 --> 03:42.826
The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must believe.

03:45.307 --> 03:47.808
just it's literally turning into a worst case scenario.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.490
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:51.610 --> 03:56.413
I'm afraid that the latest data tells us that we're dealing with essentially a worst case scenario.

03:56.473 --> 04:03.337
I'm afraid that the latest data... But you can tell if someone's lying, you know, you can sort of feel it in people.

04:05.098 --> 04:05.858
And I have lied.

04:05.998 --> 04:06.879
I'm sure I'll lie again.

04:06.899 --> 04:07.839
I don't want to lie.

04:08.299 --> 04:09.660
You know, I don't think I'm a liar.

04:09.780 --> 04:10.801
I try not to be a liar.

04:10.821 --> 04:11.681
I don't want to be a liar.

04:12.241 --> 04:14.963
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

04:17.699 --> 04:19.260
I think truth is good for kids.

04:19.701 --> 04:23.544
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

04:24.005 --> 04:25.626
We want everybody to feel good.

04:25.646 --> 04:27.728
That's not the way life is.

04:38.248 --> 04:39.050
Sweaty palms.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.792
This is so crazy.

04:41.574 --> 04:42.415
Like goosebumps.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.418
This is so crazy.

04:44.639 --> 04:46.522
I feel so nervous.

04:46.562 --> 04:47.824
Like what in the world, man?

04:50.984 --> 05:09.529
Jonathan, who's gonna talk about his latest kind of distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and to the whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

05:10.649 --> 05:19.091
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent panel that we have, each one of you is gonna get a chance to comment

05:23.382 --> 05:24.563
I don't care how you get there.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.244
I don't care what you do to get there.

05:27.264 --> 05:37.689
The goal is to win.

05:44.433 --> 05:45.513
Good morning, everybody.

05:45.573 --> 05:46.414
Welcome to the show.

05:46.434 --> 05:52.197
This is GigaOM Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

05:53.971 --> 05:55.332
What a strange trip it's been.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.116
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

05:59.196 --> 06:00.898
No thanks to any of these people.

06:02.459 --> 06:10.007
It's really incredible where we are and I think the only way out is by learning the biology they don't want you to understand.

06:10.667 --> 06:18.576
learning the biology that they're lying about, learning the biology that would destroy the mythology that we are currently trapped in.

06:18.616 --> 06:21.318
That's what Giga Home Biological is trying to help people do.

06:21.839 --> 06:27.525
I'm not the only one, but when I'm one of the few, we are definitely living in interesting times.

06:29.771 --> 06:32.734
And we need people to be like Galileo.

06:32.754 --> 06:35.577
You need to report what you can see through your telescope.

06:35.617 --> 06:39.741
You need to realize that your phone is not a telescope.

06:40.682 --> 06:48.229
It's a way for them to occupy your consciousness, to occupy the limited number of thoughts that you can have every day.

06:48.850 --> 06:52.713
And also, you're allowing them to see them, to share them.

06:53.334 --> 06:57.699
to occupy and control them.

06:58.359 --> 07:03.885
That's where we are, because it's not a matter of what is true, but a matter of what is perceived to be true.

07:04.345 --> 07:11.653
And if you scroll, attempting to find out what's true, you're just going to find out what they want you to perceive as true.

07:12.534 --> 07:15.036
And this has been the way it is since

07:16.187 --> 07:38.044
since fiat currencies and the American banks were taken over and the banking system in the world was usurped by these liars and they have now moved on to the stage where they're destroying our respective cultures by convincing people to stop reading and instead just keep scrolling

07:39.405 --> 07:48.493
And this is also allowing them to effectively erase or replace our history with common folklore and mythology that really has no basis in reality.

07:49.073 --> 07:58.781
And there are people who've seen this way before me and way before anybody and before the pandemic, but the pandemic has helped a lot more people to be shown what's really going on.

07:59.441 --> 08:07.988
And in the end, it's come down to inverting our sovereignty as individuals into something of an experimental animal.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.592
so that they can feed our data to their God.

08:11.554 --> 08:21.151
Because Joshua Lederberg and other people have been telling stories for a long time about how, at a certain point in the future, this would be possible.

08:23.325 --> 08:36.744
And of course, Edward Bernays already knew in the 1920s that the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society.

08:36.804 --> 08:40.569
He also knew that those who manipulated this unseen mechanism

08:44.096 --> 08:49.561
would constitute an invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country.

08:49.601 --> 08:54.566
And then, more than a generation later, you have Noam Chomsky basically saying the same thing.

08:55.386 --> 09:09.419
The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow a very lively debate within that spectrum, even encourage the more critical and seemingly dissident views.

09:10.526 --> 09:21.891
This gives the people the sense that there's free thinking going on while all the time presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate.

09:25.293 --> 09:32.496
That's exactly what Bret Weinstein does and has been doing since he ever went on the internet as a podcaster.

09:33.755 --> 09:42.281
And whether Joe Rogan knows it or not, that's exactly what all of the guests that have come on his show and smoked weed with him have been doing as well.

09:43.402 --> 09:50.467
Participating in a very lively debate which reinforces all the presuppositions of the system.

09:51.487 --> 10:02.255
And once you see it and the illusion breaks, you almost can't go on social media anymore without becoming tainted by the sheer overwhelming

10:03.231 --> 10:04.773
amount of lying going on.

10:08.076 --> 10:10.279
And it's a spectacular commitment to lies.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.280
That's what you see.

10:11.981 --> 10:24.094
These people are spectacularly committed to these lies because they are engaged in an ongoing audition to be a permanent part or a more prominent part member of the overclass

10:24.835 --> 10:45.611
that is ruling us with this combination of controlling the banking system, the monetary system, and effectively controlling us by ruling through mythologies, governance by mythology, and this really elaborate theater on social media, which covers all different stages.

10:45.691 --> 10:48.353
It is a Lollapalooza of liars.

10:49.485 --> 11:11.265
There are blue stages and red stages, left stages and right stages, heterodox stages and orthodox stages, and it's all the same commitment to the lie that it's not one Lollapalooza, but it's a bunch of organically erupting movements that are part of a unity movement or something like this.

11:12.887 --> 11:14.589
No, ladies and gentlemen, no.

11:16.806 --> 11:20.267
The reason why they're gonna get our kids is because we won't wake up.

11:21.367 --> 11:31.930
The reason why our grandkids may already be enslaved is because very few of us are willing to actually wake up, speak the truth every day and see what happens.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.190
Because that's what's really necessary.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.331
You gotta be able to say it whenever called upon.

11:39.312 --> 11:43.575
You gotta be able to call out these lies whenever called upon.

11:44.035 --> 11:50.779
It can't be something where you know this is true, but you let people talk about it anyway.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.522
You've gotta call it out every chance you get now.

11:55.582 --> 12:07.249
You've gotta share my work and the work of Mark Kulak and a few others, like maybe Joe Marshall, as often as possible, because this spectacular commitment's not gonna go away.

12:07.329 --> 12:08.750
These people are not gonna stop.

12:11.909 --> 12:12.870
Why is that not going?

12:15.394 --> 12:21.482
These people aren't going to stop until all of us learn the biology and chase them down with it.

12:22.203 --> 12:28.652
These people are not going to stop because the history has already been twisted and contorted by a

12:29.938 --> 12:49.841
a collective coordinated group of liars that goes all the way back to the history of HIV all goes all the way back to the special cancer virus program and whether or not viruses cause cancer or cause AIDS or this is all the same multi-generational illusion

12:50.942 --> 13:00.964
where we understand most or all of our biology or it's inevitable that we soon will because we discovered DNA and therefore evolution is real.

13:02.076 --> 13:07.218
We must dispel this mythology and the charlatans that push it.

13:07.458 --> 13:14.180
We must dispel this mythology and the charlatans that push it if we want this time to be different.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.240
That's the trick.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.561
You want this time to be different?

13:18.021 --> 13:20.262
You want to get the power back from these charlatans?

13:20.322 --> 13:24.663
We must learn the biology that they are lying about.

13:26.226 --> 13:39.451
The best way that I can encourage you to learn the biology that they are lying about is to take this list of statements and try your best to use any means necessary to disprove them, to check them, to falsify them.

13:41.432 --> 13:43.833
Again, just pause the music for a second.

13:45.534 --> 13:54.878
I'm asking everyone that sees this message to take these simple statements and do their best by any means necessary to falsify them.

13:55.663 --> 14:01.325
that intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

14:02.126 --> 14:07.428
The transfection of healthy humans was always criminal and RNA cannot pandemic.

14:07.488 --> 14:12.630
The subtitle there being the US vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.111
I want real people.

14:15.222 --> 14:21.504
responsible, critically thinking adults to attempt to take this list and falsify it.

14:22.125 --> 14:30.308
Find as many pieces of evidence as you can that work to falsify these statements and we will make progress.

14:32.321 --> 14:47.908
We will get closer to the opening of the cave that we are in if you or anyone you know can take up the challenge of taking this list and explicitly, as detailed as possible, debunk it.

14:50.529 --> 14:54.750
Because if you can't, then the truth is that the U.S.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.432
vaccine schedule is a criminal enterprise and it was before the pandemic.

14:59.793 --> 15:05.116
which makes my statements about who these people were before the pandemic even more relevant.

15:06.316 --> 15:13.000
It makes my statements about the sabotage that has likely occurred or started before the pandemic even more relevant.

15:13.060 --> 15:22.445
Because again, if these statements cannot be disproven, that no one will bother to even speak them out loud,

15:25.439 --> 15:35.783
No one in the health freedom movement will just take these ideas and say, you know, Jay is a blowhard, but man, oh man, he got two of the three of these dead on balls accurate.

15:37.084 --> 15:39.745
You have to see that this is only malevolence.

15:41.205 --> 15:42.166
It's only a theater.

15:43.386 --> 15:49.528
I have gotten to talk to all of these people in person who claim to be aware of the problems.

15:50.669 --> 15:53.230
Claim to be part of the movement.

15:55.856 --> 16:00.298
and can only sell onesies that kinda sorta say this but not really.

16:00.358 --> 16:02.438
They don't make a banner that says this.

16:03.198 --> 16:05.919
They won't buy a billboard that says this.

16:05.979 --> 16:09.981
They won't sell t-shirts for adults that say this.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.642
They won't sell books that say this.

16:16.323 --> 16:19.564
And they've had almost two decades to do it.

16:21.294 --> 16:28.943
culminating with a movement during the first Trump administration with Vaxxed and Vaxxed 2.

16:29.804 --> 16:32.868
During the first Trump administration.

16:38.015 --> 16:40.257
You gotta see it for what it is, ladies and gentlemen.

16:40.277 --> 16:41.498
You gotta see it for what it is.

16:41.578 --> 16:46.283
Ladies and ladies and ladies and ladies and ladies and gentlemen, this is GigaOM Biological.

16:46.863 --> 16:50.226
A high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

16:50.287 --> 16:57.874
Sometimes I am a little upset because I do think that there is a real paucity of real information out there on the internet.

16:58.614 --> 17:01.897
YouTube is almost devoid of anyone that's actually thinking.

17:02.337 --> 17:15.409
And in fact, what you see on YouTube is a coordinated group of liars that extends from somebody like Sam Seder criticizing Brett Weinstein all the way to Tim Pool promoting Brett Weinstein.

17:15.469 --> 17:23.736
And you see all of these people that claim to be arguing and facing off with one another, and it is all just one malevolent chorus.

17:25.882 --> 17:34.864
There are very, very few real, innocent, normal thinking voices that rise to any level of prominence on YouTube.

17:34.904 --> 17:36.464
Because again, you have to think about it.

17:36.524 --> 17:49.347
If there are 100 million people that are trying to put out any message at all on YouTube, and YouTube only can show you 24 videos with each scroll of your screen,

17:50.754 --> 18:03.186
and what you click on can be potentially the source of money, or distraction, or governance by mythology, then why would any of those videos be left to chance?

18:04.648 --> 18:11.555
If you subscribe to too many of these fake accounts, then your entire feed can essentially be fake.

18:12.871 --> 18:26.376
Only if you subscribe to a scant few regularly weeded out groups of people or channels can you hope that the algorithm will be forced to feed you something relevant.

18:27.916 --> 18:30.237
Otherwise, essentially, you're just gonna be overloaded.

18:30.277 --> 18:39.060
Like you can be on Twitter or on Facebook or on any of these other military social control mechanisms, these software suites.

18:40.717 --> 18:45.740
where your attention is essentially offered up to the next thing that shows up on the screen.

18:47.361 --> 19:01.228
We must teach our children to use the internet in a much more vigilant, hyper-focused, and hyper-filtered sort of way so that they are in control as much as possible as to what they spend their time thinking about.

19:02.210 --> 19:08.992
It's one of the most important battles that we haven't even begun to fight because most of these people won't even talk about that.

19:09.212 --> 19:17.095
The fact that before the pandemic, the amount of screen time that any of us had was orders of magnitude lower than it is now.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.336
And it has become normalized even in our youngest children.

19:21.116 --> 19:28.799
And this is the utmost of dangerous scenarios that we seem to have wholly accepted as a result of there being pandemics and stuff.

19:35.444 --> 19:46.688
And so I just want to briefly discuss some of these things before I look at some of the videos that have come out recently, the things that happened last week.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.549
I don't know what I'm going to call this show on Mondays.

19:48.589 --> 19:51.610
Maybe I should call it like last week this morning or something like that.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.431
Anyway, it is February 3rd, 2025.

19:54.671 --> 19:58.333
This still remains for all the children on earth.

19:59.053 --> 20:00.715
I apologize for the Twitch people.

20:00.795 --> 20:01.937
This is Peertube.

20:01.977 --> 20:02.597
Look at that.

20:02.758 --> 20:03.458
Is that there?

20:03.919 --> 20:04.700
Does that work?

20:05.481 --> 20:05.741
Yeah, baby!

20:06.382 --> 20:07.543
Hello, check it out.

20:08.284 --> 20:10.006
I'm gonna put the chats away for now, though.

20:11.248 --> 20:14.552
It is for all the marbles, ladies and gentlemen, definitely.

20:16.144 --> 20:17.225
for all the marbles.

20:17.605 --> 20:30.694
And I just, I can't stress enough how important it is for you to realize that after five years of hard work together, we've gotten to the stage where I think we can pretty much explain it in one slide.

20:31.315 --> 20:39.981
We have no data to differentiate the signals that we are being told was COVID from a background signal.

20:40.681 --> 20:45.024
And in fact, using standard synthetic DNA

20:46.613 --> 20:56.161
and the distribution of it, anyone could turn a background signal into evidence of spread with non-specific PCR tests.

20:56.281 --> 20:57.342
It's just that simple.

20:57.743 --> 20:59.384
Because RNA cannot pandemic.

21:00.985 --> 21:07.331
Now the people that we are opposing essentially say that the COVID shots are bad, just don't talk about 2020, and that's the reason.

21:08.837 --> 21:22.761
Because it is in 2020, 2021, and 2022 that all the murder happened, and that's why none of these people made any useful progress as dissidents in a health freedom movement before 2022.

21:24.562 --> 21:38.546
So I want to make sure that you understand that that is my argument, that the murder happened during the first couple years of the pandemic, and these people just needed to run out the clock with a mystery-solving exercise about a lab leak.

21:41.277 --> 21:43.558
And now I think this is it, right?

21:43.618 --> 21:50.280
I mean, using their tests to find their ghost does not make their ghost real, nor does it make you a ghostbuster.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.481
The way that they rolled out the transfection is simple.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.502
They used placebo, that's what made it safe.

21:58.402 --> 22:07.445
And then they controlled the whining about the safety signal by putting people like Epigirl in place, just like the SPARS pandemic document described.

22:09.013 --> 22:12.956
social media personalities that were pointing out that the shots were bad.

22:15.919 --> 22:28.269
Interestingly, when Jessica Rose was doing her schtick for the first two and a half years, she didn't say that Children's Health Defense knew that the vaccine schedule was criminal before the pandemic.

22:29.110 --> 22:34.034
She said that there was no signal before the pandemic and that the signal started after the vaccine rollout.

22:37.907 --> 22:50.768
Once you start to line all of these things up on the calendar, on the timeline, you realize that none of the people that have been in front of Ron Johnson's Senate group saved anyone from this narrative.

22:53.120 --> 22:57.701
They have not questioned any of the foundational aspects of the narrative.

22:57.841 --> 23:15.525
One of the most important being what I am calling the non-specific PCR tests that people like Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project have been out in front, podcast after podcast since 2020, making sure that no useful questions about that test were asked.

23:16.385 --> 23:19.586
No useful questions about that methodology were asked.

23:20.427 --> 23:27.553
And instead, curiously enough, McKernan is asking the same questions about the PCR test that the no virus people asked about.

23:31.257 --> 23:43.628
And that's why I believe it is very important that our children understand that the overclass, those are the people that don't need money anymore because they have generational wealth, multi-generational wealth.

23:45.141 --> 23:54.546
some of which can be traced back to the Pilgrims, or to the Dutch East Indies Company, or to some other giant, old, weaponized pile of money.

23:56.768 --> 24:02.551
If your family was considered rich in the early 1900s, goodness sakes, ladies and gentlemen.

24:03.991 --> 24:19.074
And so the overclass has placed, using monopoly money, has placed highly trained acolytes on social media just the same way that they used to control what was on TV and what was on the newspaper front page.

24:19.574 --> 24:29.076
They have moved to a much more, much more effective control mechanism, and that is the various forms of social media.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.296
And they can just put people on social media,

24:32.441 --> 24:55.017
use the programming of social media to make them seem to rise, convince the whole world that viral on the internet is a real thing, that good ideas and smart people go viral on the internet, and that way they can control the questions we ask and the answers we arrived at to trick us into believing anything.

24:56.636 --> 25:06.647
and what I am suggesting and what I have been suggesting for some years now on other platforms besides YouTube, although I'm now on YouTube today with 20 people watching.

25:06.687 --> 25:08.229
Hello, good to see you guys.

25:08.309 --> 25:10.612
Michael, good to see you in the chat there.

25:11.957 --> 25:14.859
PCR is not a useful diagnostic tool.

25:14.919 --> 25:15.579
It's just not.

25:16.080 --> 25:23.984
It might be useful for looking for things in nature, in a surveillance sort of way, but it's not a diagnostic tool.

25:24.004 --> 25:25.165
It doesn't prove anything.

25:25.826 --> 25:36.652
Pure oxygen does cause ARDS, which is the main symptom of SARS, and said to be the main symptom of SARS-CoV-2 when it was starting to circulate in 2020.

25:37.993 --> 25:39.194
Pure oxygen does that.

25:40.219 --> 25:50.305
the unadulterated, unmitigated panic that was created by people like Kyle Seidel and Pierre Corey.

25:51.245 --> 26:07.635
The protocols released by the CDC, which I assume, although I would also assume that doctors could check this, would encourage, if you don't have ventilators, to give people pure oxygen if their pulse oximeter read too low.

26:08.911 --> 26:33.693
Interestingly, the pulse oximeter was one of the primary reasons that Pierre Cory should argue that people were saved at the beginning of the pandemic because he said one of the primary strange symptoms that he'd never seen before that could diagnose COVID was a low pulse ox, which I'm sure had nothing to do with the fact that these people were wearing two masks because of the panic that was being created on social media and on TV.

26:35.239 --> 26:50.706
It's weird how this device, which Pierre Cory in 2020 would have argued would have been essential, essential medical equipment, has virtually vanished from the radar of any discussion of anything to do with COVID anymore.

26:51.347 --> 26:53.368
This used to be the way that they diagnosed it.

26:53.988 --> 27:01.772
Actually, the FLCCC protocol suggested that if this number was lower than 94, you should go to the hospital.

27:05.734 --> 27:08.896
And so again, what I am suggesting, I want to be very clear.

27:09.937 --> 27:23.366
I think the overclass placed people like Kevin McKernan, Jessica Rose, and Robert Malone in place and moved them forward into the public eye to enact a narrative.

27:25.227 --> 27:34.914
A narrative about a mystery solving exercise with a lab leak and perpetuated the lie about RNA virology.

27:36.837 --> 27:44.100
perpetuated the lie about antibodies to novel viruses being evidence of memory.

27:45.161 --> 27:48.222
And since we don't have antibodies, we must all be vulnerable.

27:49.763 --> 28:04.009
All of this remained absolutely and positively unquestioned by Kevin McKernan, Jessica Rose, Meryl Nass, Robert Malone, all these medical and biological experts

28:06.394 --> 28:23.099
that parachuted in in 2021 to tell us the truth, to make sure that we kept our eyes on the ball, never once questioned PCR usefully, never once questioned the immunology that was put forth by the state and by the narrative, even by Bill Gates.

28:24.700 --> 28:33.963
And if they did question it, they questioned it in a non-useful way, by still controlling the questions we asked and the answers that we considered.

28:35.276 --> 28:44.382
so that in the end we all believe that there was a toxic spike protein that might be gain of function, that probably was a lab leak, that even if it wasn't, it could be the next one.

28:47.096 --> 29:05.246
And here we are now with the announcement of this AI initiative in America, which falls in line exactly with what myself and only Mark Kulak has been saying, which is that they are inverting our individual sovereignty to this status of experimental animal because the Human Genome Project was a lie.

29:06.227 --> 29:08.428
They need our medical data.

29:08.488 --> 29:11.250
They need our whole genomic data.

29:11.690 --> 29:15.152
And it's not as simple as going through our garbage.

29:16.482 --> 29:19.664
It's not as simple as going through our garbage.

29:20.805 --> 29:23.286
So they needed to have us at home.

29:23.726 --> 29:32.051
They needed to have college kids go back to college and have to be subjected to swabbing every week.

29:32.111 --> 29:41.697
They had to sell those remnants under the guise of sequencing the virus and looking for mutations at Los Alamos Laboratories with DITRA.

29:44.420 --> 29:54.562
And so this illusion, this fraudulent use of PCR as a viral diagnostic is the establishment of a medical remnant stream that has not gone away.

29:55.759 --> 30:18.130
has only become standard, and this is a source of de-identified, de-identified data, that when put back into a big enough computer with a big enough comparison power to compare and enough access to enough of other data, then the de-identified stuff doesn't matter anymore because they'll be able to match it back up with the medical records.

30:18.190 --> 30:25.554
It's not very hard, especially if they have the power of brute force computing behind them.

30:27.338 --> 30:37.825
especially if they have week after week after week of testing, especially if they have university health records from every student that ever enrolled and matriculated.

30:40.367 --> 30:45.330
Then they can get the Epic database and they can de-identify it and cross list them.

30:47.591 --> 30:52.755
And if there's malevolence, if they do it by any means necessary, then I hope you can see that this is trivial.

30:55.356 --> 30:57.017
and that they ran out the clock on this.

30:57.057 --> 30:58.698
This is already ongoing.

30:58.738 --> 31:15.965
They announced it in the Trump administration, but when they announced it, they said the buildings were already being built, which means they were already designed, which means all the power outlets and all the engineering that's gonna be needed to cool the place, all that stuff was designed.

31:16.005 --> 31:17.206
Otherwise, what are they building?

31:22.348 --> 31:23.449
And so this is a plan.

31:25.165 --> 31:34.975
Doesn't matter who is at the top of the pirate ship that everybody's watching and all the lights are on and in the fountain at Las Vegas.

31:35.015 --> 31:44.726
It doesn't matter if one captain or another captain is on that pirate ship out in front of that casino in Las Vegas.

31:44.766 --> 31:45.847
You know that that's true.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.733
Is that the Mirage that has the pirate ship out in front of it?

31:50.773 --> 31:51.334
I don't even know.

31:51.794 --> 31:58.438
But they have all this live pirate enactment and cannons going off every hour or something like that in their fountain.

31:59.474 --> 32:01.694
You know that it doesn't matter who plays the captain.

32:02.295 --> 32:09.396
You know it doesn't matter who plays the pirates that get shot or the pirates that don't get shot in that enactment and it happens every hour.

32:09.996 --> 32:17.957
But for some reason, we've become convinced that on longer timescales, you know, like four-year elections, that these people are real.

32:20.538 --> 32:23.578
And the reason why we're convinced that is because our parents were convinced.

32:23.618 --> 32:27.439
We inherited that myth from our parents.

32:29.525 --> 32:32.327
Heck, it could have even been true when our parents were alive.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.908
It could have been true when we were kids, but it's not true now.

32:36.429 --> 32:41.733
We are being governed as experimental animals, as farm animals already.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.793
It's already happened.

32:42.853 --> 32:44.114
The gates are already closed.

32:44.834 --> 32:47.936
The barn door is already open, whatever the right analogy is.

32:49.077 --> 32:55.441
That's why they felt so comfortable announcing it, even though they told you that they were already going forward with it before Trump was elected.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.463
Otherwise, they wouldn't have buildings already built.

32:59.565 --> 33:06.507
Because buildings have to be designed, especially if they're going to have an enormous number of computers working inside of them.

33:09.307 --> 33:12.968
This was all accomplished for the slavers by Team Worst Case Scenario.

33:14.128 --> 33:20.750
Team Worst Case Scenario are the people that have been manipulating our opinions on social media.

33:21.370 --> 33:27.212
The Team Worst Case Scenario are the people that have been orchestrating this limited spectrum of debate about who's guilty.

33:27.252 --> 33:28.772
Is it Fauci or Daszak?

33:29.795 --> 33:31.156
Is it the diffuse proposal?

33:31.216 --> 33:37.302
The diffuse proposal is the very lively debate within that spectrum.

33:37.382 --> 33:37.923
Is it real?

33:38.023 --> 33:38.604
Is it fake?

33:38.824 --> 33:42.287
Is the debate, is that spectrum?

33:44.429 --> 33:49.854
That's them occupying our consciousness, occupying our attention, giving us questions to answer.

33:50.715 --> 33:51.336
That was him.

33:53.948 --> 34:05.913
Unfortunately, I feel really sad because not everybody has a person like Kevin McKernan that they can look to repeatedly in their experience and say, wow, well, I don't have to, I should always remember him.

34:06.853 --> 34:10.155
Because if I ever have any doubts, that's all I have to do is think about him.

34:11.275 --> 34:12.296
Or think about Rixey.

34:13.116 --> 34:14.316
Or think about McCairn.

34:15.497 --> 34:22.540
And all the real interactions I had with these people before and during the pandemic, from the start till now,

34:23.726 --> 34:36.632
Not everybody has this really clear set of handholds in reality where people lied to them and backstabbed them and made ridiculous numbers of videos, hours of videos about them.

34:37.552 --> 34:39.893
Most of my viewers have not had that experience.

34:39.933 --> 34:47.357
And so it's not as real to you as it would be to me, but my most, most

34:48.766 --> 34:54.189
The thing I'm most thankful for is the Danny Jones podcast and Kevin McKernan's interview on it.

34:54.269 --> 35:00.872
Because in that interview, he repeatedly mentions someone who came to my house in 2022.

35:02.653 --> 35:06.894
He repeatedly mentions him in a way that is verifiably false.

35:11.237 --> 35:18.160
And is verifiably false by a number of people directly connected to and including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

35:19.468 --> 35:24.269
which is a really extraordinary place for anyone to be, but that's where I am.

35:25.529 --> 35:31.210
And so for me, it's not a question of if or what, or maybe it's a question of what do I do now?

35:32.630 --> 35:47.113
Because Kevin McKernan has not only revealed the truth to me for sure about what I was probably right about all along, but the fact of how many people have been coordinating their efforts to obfuscate that.

35:50.839 --> 35:53.261
And so that's why I think my news program is so important.

35:53.281 --> 36:05.750
That's why I think Ego and Biological is so important because I do think the reason why they won't dispute any of the opening statements of this program is because the vaccine schedule in America is actually a criminal enterprise.

36:05.790 --> 36:13.495
That's also why I don't think YouTube can do anything about this show because if they do, they will be calling attention to it.

36:14.135 --> 36:20.100
They will be giving it the badge of honor, you know, the one that says censorship because it's the truth.

36:21.127 --> 36:31.450
And so, they're gonna have to ignore GigaOM Biological on YouTube now, because if they give me a strike or they cancel this channel, then all of it will go viral.

36:31.550 --> 36:32.390
Who knew?

36:33.150 --> 36:37.491
Of course it won't go viral, but you know, it will be further admission that this is the real deal.

36:41.516 --> 36:42.436
So that's my call.

36:42.516 --> 36:44.377
I don't think that they will censor this stream.

36:44.417 --> 36:51.540
They can't afford to call any attention to the fact that we had it figured out all along, long time ago.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.101
That's why they knew this was coming.

36:55.026 --> 37:13.178
If you just pause this right here and you see that in 2004 the population pyramid already clearly revealed that in 20 years when this population right here, this is the males on this side, females on that side, you have age from 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, going up all the way to retirement age.

37:16.581 --> 37:21.044
This is a way of visualizing the population of America.

37:21.064 --> 37:28.129
When I stopped the video, the population was 292 million people distributed exactly like this.

37:28.249 --> 37:33.493
And I think if you can think graphically, you can see that there's a bump here of people.

37:35.895 --> 37:41.879
And that bump was originating, if I get my mouse here, was originating back here.

37:46.331 --> 38:03.362
So when you see it down here now, you realize that already back in 1990, when I graduated from high school, people like Ted Turner already knew that when these people got old, this was gonna be a problem because they would all collect social security, they would all be on Medicare or Medicaid.

38:06.164 --> 38:07.345
I don't know why that advanced.

38:11.027 --> 38:13.469
And so my point is very simple.

38:14.858 --> 38:16.059
They knew this was coming.

38:16.880 --> 38:23.886
They knew that an expected rise in all cause mortality that would last about a decade was coming.

38:24.626 --> 38:35.676
And that if we put all of our energy into giving those people the longest lives possible, all Western nations on earth would run out of money.

38:38.240 --> 38:58.790
We couldn't afford to keep all of these old and, in America, quite unhealthy people alive until they're 90, if possible, by throwing everything at them, as far as Western medicine had, because the stats on that are about $500,000 for the last six months of life.

39:02.232 --> 39:04.433
Or for every six months that you add on.

39:06.420 --> 39:10.943
And so these myths, these are myths perpetrated by traitors.

39:11.003 --> 39:32.755
They hide murder with lies, murder that was, that was, was managing this problem, managing this, what is essentially a budgetary problem, a hospital bed problem, a old folks home bed problem.

39:35.031 --> 39:36.211
And they knew it was coming.

39:36.312 --> 39:37.412
Fauci knew it was coming.

39:37.472 --> 40:00.721
That's why they had Fauci in place for 40 years to build this narrative of pandemics, to build this narrative of disease, global circulating disease, so that when this problem matured, they could manage it with murder hidden by lies.

40:03.717 --> 40:04.858
And that's what COVID was.

40:07.240 --> 40:24.634
Excess deaths, they were already expected that if they showed you this graph on the right time scale, it would have this slope going up like this, because we were expecting a rise in all-cause mortality that was coming from that bump on the side of the population pyramid.

40:24.694 --> 40:26.235
But instead, they managed it.

40:26.275 --> 40:29.238
They made it into sharp peaks by murdering people.

40:30.031 --> 40:48.009
and then told you that was excess deaths that were caused by a novel virus, a mystery virus that might've leaked from a laboratory because, you know, it seems like Fauci's trying to cover it up and it seems like this guy that was on 60 Minutes already knows that there are 1.7 million viruses ready to jump.

40:48.109 --> 40:49.771
So, I mean, holy cow.

40:52.509 --> 41:04.214
And that's why Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose and Kevin McKernan and Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey will never tell you how supplementary oxygen leads directly to ARDS.

41:05.455 --> 41:10.378
how supplementary oxygen at 60 liters a minute is ridiculously lethal.

41:10.918 --> 41:33.872
They won't tell you about the roughly half a million Americans of all age groups that died of opioid deaths during the course of the last four or five years, because then that would contribute significantly to the decrease in life expectancy in America that has heretofore by them been attributed to the mystery virus.

41:35.711 --> 41:56.988
That's why Denny Rancor, the guy who's known since May of 2020 that there's no epidemiological evidence of spread, never interacts with any of these heroes in a critical way and says, hey, by the way, there's no epidemiological evidence of spread, and lets them promote his 17 million people killed by the shot number.

41:57.789 --> 41:58.469
Stop lying!

42:00.511 --> 42:02.612
That's why there are no lawyers

42:03.596 --> 42:12.125
in any of these organizations that can explain why strict liability would fix this problem and what it really means.

42:13.927 --> 42:26.040
And there are no lawyers in this space that will say that we need to hold the government to strict scrutiny when they suspend fundamental rights like they are able to do with the PREP Act.

42:27.677 --> 42:31.862
because then every lawyer worth their salt would understand what we need to do.

42:31.902 --> 42:39.892
We need to strike the PREP Act because it allows the government to suspend fundamental rights without holding the government to strict scrutiny.

42:40.352 --> 42:44.237
And that is a violation of a fundamental principle in American law.

42:44.817 --> 42:47.601
And anybody worth their salt knows that.

42:49.602 --> 42:59.786
How could I get to an understanding where I can say that out loud in plain English after roughly a year of reading and tutoring if it's not true?

43:01.366 --> 43:13.110
Why is it that Bobbie Ann Cox of the Brownstone Institute ran away from me when I started trying to talk to her about that idea that I could say in one sentence?

43:15.951 --> 43:18.272
It's because they're all traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

43:19.175 --> 43:20.336
You can see it right here, 2019.

43:21.257 --> 43:32.570
One of the things I gotta point out with this graph, and as I use it in this talk, is that the CDC does not talk about years.

43:32.870 --> 43:37.576
They talk about flu seasons, and flu season actually starts in week 40.

43:39.221 --> 43:42.103
out of 52 and ends in week 40.

43:43.725 --> 43:47.948
So the year, you know, 2020 actually starts right here.

43:48.689 --> 43:53.873
And the last 11 weeks of 2019 plus the first 50 or 41 weeks, so stupid, of 2020 is the 2019 to 2020 flu season.

44:08.359 --> 44:14.696
And so when you interface with this graph, you have to see that these stripes in light gray are really flu seasons.

44:14.736 --> 44:15.658
They're not years.

44:15.799 --> 44:16.741
It's a little stupid.

44:18.601 --> 44:20.682
But the idea is to obfuscate the truth.

44:20.742 --> 44:25.524
So every little bit of stupidity that you can add to any of these tools, the better.

44:26.404 --> 44:29.286
Now, what you see here is the beginning of the pandemic.

44:29.446 --> 44:30.606
This is the 10th week.

44:30.646 --> 44:32.947
So this is roughly February, right?

44:33.347 --> 44:40.490
And so then here you see again, roughly February of, or January rather of 2021 right here.

44:43.806 --> 44:49.049
And so what you can see is that basically nobody spoke out until everybody was murdered.

44:49.969 --> 44:52.631
Nobody spoke out until everybody was transfected.

44:54.232 --> 44:58.934
This is the middle of 20, this is not even the 10th week of 2022.

44:59.014 --> 45:05.698
So it's like February, March of 2022 right here, see?

45:06.538 --> 45:09.300
So really nobody useful spoke out.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.281
They went on Bret Weinstein, what, in June?

45:12.847 --> 45:16.809
So that's six times five, that's like week 30, like right here, they went out right here.

45:17.109 --> 45:21.991
This is when they spoke out on Brett Weinstein and on the Joe Rogan podcast.

45:22.491 --> 45:28.054
Nobody useful spoke out with any useful resistance until all the murder was over.

45:29.274 --> 45:30.815
And it stops pretty abruptly.

45:38.502 --> 45:47.425
And I'm saying that the way that they did that was they agreed across the board, left and right, up and down, that there was a mystery to solve, that it might be a lab leak.

45:47.485 --> 45:50.006
That might be the reason why a lockdown would be smart.

45:50.786 --> 45:54.868
That might be the reason why we need two years of lockdown.

45:59.810 --> 46:01.350
That's how they did it, ladies and gentlemen.

46:01.390 --> 46:03.171
They fooled us into solving a mystery.

46:03.211 --> 46:06.472
And by solving that mystery, we accepted their monsters.

46:07.708 --> 46:10.170
And this is indeed for all the children of earth.

46:10.230 --> 46:11.631
This is for our grandkids.

46:11.671 --> 46:13.733
That's why this news program is so important.

46:13.753 --> 46:17.996
That's why I need you to share this with as many people as you can.

46:18.056 --> 46:27.183
If we put those deaths, that same graph into my graph, you can see that pretty much from 2020, 2021, and oh, there it is, it's over.

46:28.524 --> 46:29.484
All the murder's over.

46:29.544 --> 46:32.146
Now we can start talking about the shot being bad.

46:36.943 --> 46:39.204
That's exactly what happened, ladies and gentlemen.

46:39.224 --> 46:40.525
That's exactly what happened.

46:40.605 --> 46:43.807
And if you don't see it, except for in retrospect, that's okay.

46:44.787 --> 46:46.008
That's really okay.

46:47.249 --> 46:48.149
That's fine.

46:48.249 --> 46:50.030
If you can see it now, then you can see it.

46:51.711 --> 46:53.492
None of these people spoke out usefully.

47:00.714 --> 47:01.314
There you go.

47:01.915 --> 47:05.537
Even the Canadian trucker protest, you can see it there in the chat.

47:05.617 --> 47:13.502
Even the Canadian trucker protest, says Jason is right here, was February, 2022.

47:14.363 --> 47:19.046
So even the Canadian truckers protest was too late.

47:20.867 --> 47:23.008
Was essentially after everything happened.

47:23.068 --> 47:26.971
So it really fits well into this hamster wheel model.

47:27.071 --> 47:29.773
It's extraordinary, really extraordinary.

47:31.094 --> 47:31.757
Uh, let's see.

47:31.817 --> 47:32.781
Let's go ahead with this.

47:33.383 --> 47:35.291
Um, thanks guys for being here

47:35.697 --> 47:41.441
And there was one more break or make hearing today that was for Health and Human Services nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:41.501 --> 47:42.202
He went before us.

47:42.502 --> 47:44.684
And so, of course, this is what happened last week, right?

47:44.704 --> 47:47.366
We had two hearings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

47:48.206 --> 47:53.490
They were both televised and we got to see a lot of things, hear a lot of things over and over.

47:54.071 --> 47:55.352
I am pro vaccine.

47:55.392 --> 47:57.293
I want to protect the vaccine schedule.

47:57.373 --> 47:59.054
I will not take away vaccines.

47:59.535 --> 48:00.535
I won't end vaccines.

48:00.595 --> 48:02.937
I don't have any preconceived notions.

48:06.537 --> 48:13.022
See, what struck me as odd was the idea that he said over and over again he didn't have any preconceived notions.

48:13.062 --> 48:24.070
But I thought, I was under the impression that him and Mary Holland and Meryl Nass had been working really hard on this problem for about 10 years together.

48:25.851 --> 48:29.034
Because they worked together with ICANN to produce Vaxxed in 2016.

48:29.074 --> 48:30.255
They produced Vaxxed 2 in 2017 or 18.

48:36.227 --> 48:42.492
I thought that they already understood pretty well the biology here, had a pretty good angle on the biology here.

48:42.512 --> 48:48.837
And it wasn't until I actually joined the fight with them that I found out that they weren't interested in that at all.

48:49.818 --> 49:05.130
They were actually interested in erecting and maintaining a big top tent of health freedom, which sounds a lot more like controlling people than it does a nonprofit organization with a set of goals that they want to achieve.

49:07.506 --> 49:12.188
What you will now hear over the next weeks and months is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:12.248 --> 49:15.089
is the co-founder of CHD, but he's not.

49:16.410 --> 49:18.230
Laura Bono founded CHD.

49:20.091 --> 49:22.132
Now they're gonna say Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

49:22.192 --> 49:22.692
founded it.

49:22.732 --> 49:31.396
That's what CHD still says up until today with this Kim Rosenberg or whatever her name is, the lawyer that they put in front now.

49:32.819 --> 49:39.045
What a show she put on today with someone from Texas, Texans for Vaccine Choice.

49:41.688 --> 49:44.090
You see the problem with that, vaccine choice?

49:45.251 --> 49:51.177
If you actually believe that vaccines are hurting children, then it's not choice you're fighting for.

49:53.595 --> 50:01.762
but they talk about our movement and our tribe and our movement and Big Pharma doesn't have our best interests in mind.

50:01.802 --> 50:02.823
What about our government?

50:02.863 --> 50:04.884
Does our government have our best interests in mind?

50:05.345 --> 50:07.226
What about the social media people?

50:07.266 --> 50:08.888
Do they have our best interests in mind?

50:08.928 --> 50:12.270
What about all the weaponized piles of money or the banking interests?

50:12.290 --> 50:13.952
Do they have our best interests in mind?

50:18.717 --> 50:24.687
And so now what we're going to watch is PBS NewsHour, who we know already has a certain spin on Bobby Kennedy.

50:24.747 --> 50:30.036
But remember, we are being bamboozled into accepting something.

50:30.096 --> 50:31.859
This is all part of a ritual.

50:33.291 --> 50:36.013
and what we will accept will come tomorrow.

50:36.834 --> 50:47.222
It could be that we are being prepped to accept him as a Health and Human Services Secretary, who will in the end achieve nothing, and we'll have to accept that.

50:48.243 --> 50:57.030
Or we might have to accept that somebody like him will not be confirmed, and instead accept his replacement.

50:58.376 --> 51:03.682
and then accept the system that even when we elect Donald Trump, we can't get the guy that we really wanted in there.

51:03.722 --> 51:06.525
And then that must be the reason why nothing is going to get fixed.

51:07.586 --> 51:09.868
In my mind, both of those narratives work quite well.

51:11.069 --> 51:16.595
And in my mind, neither of those has been solidly presented to us yet.

51:16.635 --> 51:18.057
It could be either outcome tomorrow.

51:19.963 --> 51:25.226
So let's take a look, a little detailed look at the theater that happened last week as a study hall.

51:25.907 --> 51:38.554
See if we can take a couple examples and see if we can figure out what this health freedom movement accomplished or didn't accomplish by getting their champion to the point where he was nominated for health and human services secretary.

51:38.614 --> 51:39.395
What was accomplished?

51:39.415 --> 51:39.715
Let's see.

51:42.694 --> 51:45.357
committee after a first round of questioning yesterday.

51:45.858 --> 51:50.784
And for the first time, we heard Republican publicly express doubts about him.

51:51.324 --> 51:52.666
Our Lisa Desjardins was there.

51:52.726 --> 51:53.547
She joins us now.

51:53.627 --> 51:57.352
So, Lisa, what were the major differences between the second hearing and the first one?

51:57.571 --> 52:01.052
This was a much sharper hearing and potentially more impactful as well, Jeff.

52:01.112 --> 52:09.676
This was the Senate Health Committee, and it is chaired by a potential swing vote, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who also happens to be a trained physician.

52:09.996 --> 52:22.821
Now, he right at the top of the hearing said something we hadn't heard yesterday, which was he said he has real concerns, as a Republican, of past misleading and unfounded statements, he said, by Kennedy about vaccines.

52:23.141 --> 52:25.522
And then he asked a direct question to Kennedy.

52:27.346 --> 52:36.229
Will you reassure mothers unequivocally and without qualification that the measles and hepatitis B vaccines do not cause autism?

52:36.729 --> 52:40.730
Senator, I am not going into the agency with any reasons.

52:40.750 --> 52:42.031
That's kind of a yes or no question.

52:42.631 --> 52:47.212
Now, what I find, just want to point out as it comes to my mind, I'm just going to talk randomly.

52:48.053 --> 52:54.975
A couple of times during the hearings, they said something to this effect where they said measles vaccine

52:56.258 --> 52:57.999
And they said polio vaccine.

52:58.039 --> 53:00.261
Now here he said hepatitis B vaccine.

53:01.221 --> 53:06.805
The hepatitis B vaccine, correct me if I'm wrong, is the one that's given at birth along with vitamin K shot.

53:09.447 --> 53:15.791
My boys did not have that shot but my girl did because my boys were born in Norway and my girl was born in the United States.

53:19.494 --> 53:22.336
So the point that I want to make is there is no measles shot.

53:24.197 --> 53:25.678
There is no pertussis shot.

53:26.732 --> 53:28.173
There's no diphtheria shot.

53:28.693 --> 53:30.154
There's no polio shot.

53:32.656 --> 53:42.963
And so when they talk about the measles shot being safe or effective, they have already lied to you about the correct question to ask.

53:43.684 --> 53:45.625
There is no measles vaccine.

53:49.306 --> 53:56.951
All the vaccines on the market have multiple antigens in them and probably also different adjuvants in them depending on the formulation.

53:58.132 --> 54:07.477
And so all of these are relevant variables not taken into account when some mouth breathing stage performer says something like the measles vaccine.

54:07.998 --> 54:16.103
And more importantly, when somebody who's supposed to be informed over the course of the last decade of activism doesn't say it.

54:18.055 --> 54:22.538
Well, Senator, actually there is no measles vaccine, so we should be very clear and precise here.

54:25.801 --> 54:27.742
Because that is actually part of the problem.

54:31.705 --> 54:45.795
Part of the bamboozlement, part of the oversimplification, part of the lack of specificity, the part of the lack of precision that allows the mythology to be perpetuated by this illusion of consensus created not just

54:48.075 --> 54:53.739
by the Senators, but also by Bobby's lack of response to them.

54:54.019 --> 54:59.923
Lack of, I mean, if you really been playing this game for 10 years, you got all the basic openings.

55:00.123 --> 55:01.924
You know how this all works.

55:05.887 --> 55:11.150
You know how the first four or five moves of chess is not really that much of a decision?

55:11.931 --> 55:13.412
If you've been playing chess a while,

55:16.613 --> 55:23.157
Well, if he's been doing this for a while, then this question is not like, oh my gosh, I'm so surprised, what a curve ball.

55:25.719 --> 55:33.704
And I can't believe how often I hear these people swing and miss when somebody says measles vaccine or polio vaccine.

55:36.526 --> 55:43.250
The only polio vaccine there is that's accurately called a polio vaccine is the oral one because it's only for polio.

55:45.134 --> 55:46.736
It's measles, mumps, and rubella.

55:51.641 --> 55:55.204
It's diphtheria and pertussis and something else.

55:58.768 --> 56:00.630
And hepatitis B is given at birth.

56:00.690 --> 56:01.631
Like, come on, guys.

56:05.051 --> 56:10.994
And he says, and he says, his only answer is, is that he doesn't have any preconceived notions.

56:11.614 --> 56:17.776
After 10 years of study, after 10 years of activism, he has no preconceived notions.

56:17.856 --> 56:20.077
It's just like Doc Malek in the UK.

56:20.518 --> 56:28.521
After coming out three years late, and after podcasting and interviewing hundreds of people, he has no preconceived notions of what happened.

56:28.841 --> 56:30.502
He hasn't learned jack shit.

56:32.577 --> 56:39.781
And it seems like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after all this time and all this activism, hasn't learned jack shit either.

56:39.822 --> 56:43.804
Otherwise, he'd be dropping bombs right now, not making excuses, right?

56:44.965 --> 56:49.427
Because the data is there.

56:50.028 --> 56:51.269
And that's kind of a yes or no.

56:51.289 --> 56:53.530
And I don't mean to cut you off, but that really is a yes or no.

56:54.531 --> 56:57.913
If the data is there, I will absolutely do that.

56:58.873 --> 57:01.255
Now, this is what Kennedy says, is that he's open to arguments.

57:01.889 --> 57:03.210
If the data is there.

57:04.670 --> 57:06.871
Don't you see how bad that makes him look?

57:08.812 --> 57:17.855
If the data is there, you're waiting for someone to send it to you when you want the largest budgetary responsibility in the administration?

57:21.216 --> 57:23.717
I mean, it's just an extraordinary theater.

57:23.797 --> 57:24.798
That's all it is.

57:24.858 --> 57:27.679
It is a ritual designed to get us

57:28.769 --> 57:36.739
the farm animals to believe and accept the outcome that we are told is the result of the ritual.

57:43.246 --> 57:44.247
I'm going to play this again.

57:48.312 --> 57:48.853
Come on, girl.

57:51.462 --> 57:54.383
He said it's not a question of if the data is there.

57:54.443 --> 57:57.565
In fact, we know the data is there, at least what the data says so far.

57:57.585 --> 58:05.729
There's a 2022 study looking at 19 different studies that shows there's no link that's known scientifically between autism and vaccines.

58:06.189 --> 58:12.652
There's also studies looking at kids who were not vaccinated and say no difference significance in how they

58:12.972 --> 58:40.561
Now are you really willing to believe that after Mary Holland was on Democracy Now in 2015 arguing with or against Paul Offit on the same side as Rand Paul in 2015 and now we're in 2025 and essentially the same ham-fisted discussion is happening on PBS NewsHour after it already happened

58:41.596 --> 58:46.178
on Good Morning America for the movie Vaxxed with Robert De Niro in 2016.

58:46.238 --> 58:47.459
10 years ago.

58:54.773 --> 59:12.120
And we still have people just citing meta-studies with p-values that supposedly prove it without any discussion about the complex biology that's there, about the complex biology that might be behind it, and that there is no one definitive cause.

59:12.140 --> 59:17.922
It could emerge from a number of different combination of causes.

59:19.940 --> 59:42.542
And that still wouldn't mean that autism couldn't come from one particular one, and that is the repeated intramuscular injection of toxins, and their buildup, or their interaction with the many medications and toxins that children are exposed through orally, or through their skin, or inhaled.

59:46.069 --> 59:55.857
And so rather than talking about how almost impossible it will be to discuss the causes of autism as in one cause, of course it's going to be difficult.

59:58.119 --> 01:00:04.424
Because we're screwing up a pattern integrity with a trajectory across time during a crucial point in development.

01:00:05.665 --> 01:00:12.591
When the pattern integrity is changing the most rapidly during childhood, during infancy,

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:28.052
And so messing with a pattern integrity when it's moving the fastest, changing the fastest, growing the fastest, will have the most consequential and potentially devastating outcomes on the final destination and trajectory through time.

01:00:30.854 --> 01:00:37.060
And so think of all the eloquent biology, the sacred biology that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:37.960
could have offered them.

01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:46.011
Which would have been effectively the same thing as saying, I don't have any preconceived notions, but I can tell you that you can't say it doesn't.

01:00:49.234 --> 01:00:53.277
I can tell you that it's much more complicated than what is the cause of autism?

01:00:53.377 --> 01:00:54.237
What is the gene?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:55.198
What are the genes?

01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:56.759
This is all nonsense.

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:58.621
He could have said anything.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:04.185
And what he said was, I don't have any preconceived notions.

01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:10.222
Wow, is that a major, major letdown.

01:01:10.322 --> 01:01:12.043
Were diagnosed with autism.

01:01:12.303 --> 01:01:14.644
Now, there's something else notable in this hearing, too, Jeff.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:23.148
Three Republican senators who were in this hearing, you see them right there, backed up Kennedy's refusal to deny that link between autism and vaccines.

01:01:23.488 --> 01:01:24.668
They said, why not be open to it?

01:01:24.728 --> 01:01:28.170
One of them talking to you afterwards, Tommy Tuberville, said there probably is a link.

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:30.670
That is not scientific.

01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:44.255
And in this hearing where Kennedy was questioning science, he wants to disrupt what he says is people who are acting in bad faith, the truth is Kennedy, who's written books on health, I've been reading one of them himself, is not really sticking to the science here.

01:01:44.335 --> 01:01:46.796
And on vaccines, public health folks say that's dangerous.

01:01:47.128 --> 01:01:49.451
And there was another controversial moment today that centered.

01:01:49.571 --> 01:01:50.332
Very carefully.

01:01:50.392 --> 01:01:53.395
She says, public health folks say that's dangerous.

01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:55.198
So she hasn't learned the biology.

01:01:56.159 --> 01:01:58.081
And now she says she's reading his book.

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:02.066
Which book I wonder.

01:02:04.128 --> 01:02:07.132
Maybe she'll interview me because she'll find me in the acknowledgements.

01:02:13.394 --> 01:02:15.036
on 9-11 and conspiracy theories.

01:02:15.076 --> 01:02:15.637
Tell us about that.

01:02:15.757 --> 01:02:16.157
That's right.

01:02:16.317 --> 01:02:22.925
This centered, in fact, on sort of some past things that he said, including a post that he put on X last summer.

01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:26.208
This is what it said going back to last summer when he was running for president.

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:31.294
RFK wrote that it's hard to tell what's a conspiracy theory and he won't take sides on 9-11.

01:02:31.674 --> 01:02:34.638
Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, asked Kennedy about that.

01:02:36.314 --> 01:02:43.898
You wouldn't take sides on 9-11, and you're admitting, you know, I have a hard time telling what is an conspiracy theory and what isn't.

01:02:44.078 --> 01:02:45.699
Senator, I haven't investigated it.

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:50.961
If the things that I investigate I take sides on, people are allowed to hold that opinion.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.482
I'm not going to tell them they're crazy.

01:02:53.682 --> 01:02:58.745
So he hasn't investigated 9-11 at all, so he's not going to have an opinion on it.

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:06.300
You know, he hasn't investigated pedophilia either, so it could be happening, but he hasn't ever investigated, so he's not really worried about it.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.421
Everything that he investigates, then he knows for sure.

01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:19.865
So, you know, it's lucky that he hasn't investigated vaccines and developed some kind of preconceived notions before he became nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:03:20.365 --> 01:03:28.191
It's sure good that he didn't research anything about vaccines beforehand to have any opinion, because he doesn't have any opinion about 9-11.

01:03:28.592 --> 01:03:31.914
That's all he's saying, just like he doesn't have any opinion about vaccines.

01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:39.280
Is he for holding that opinion?

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.881
I'm going to say, what is your evidence?

01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:44.744
Just two decades after 9-11, not denying conspiracy theories.

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:46.686
No one I talked to afterwards could defend that.

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:55.096
So these three nominees today, RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel, controversial by any normal standard, but we're not living in normal political times.

01:03:55.116 --> 01:03:56.157
I mean, will they have the votes?

01:03:56.437 --> 01:03:57.918
OK, here's where we are right now.

01:03:58.019 --> 01:03:59.340
It looks like Patel is doing well.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.301
He's on track for confirmation at this moment.

01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.563
Gabbard had a tough day today.

01:04:03.983 --> 01:04:10.909
And I think especially from Republicans, I'm hearing there is some talk of trying to convince President Trump to pull her nomination.

01:04:11.249 --> 01:04:12.570
Now, Kennedy, on the bubble.

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:17.434
It really comes down to a question of Trump and the pressure he puts, how much he's committed to these nominees.

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.496
Lisa Desjardins, thanks as always.

01:04:19.676 --> 01:04:20.017
Welcome.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.261
So let's watch the next video then.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:27.751
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:04:27.771 --> 01:04:36.060
So, Mr. Kennedy, I want to start with something that I think you and I agree on, and that is that Big Pharma has too much power in Washington.

01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:42.748
You've said that President Trump asked you to, quote, clean up corruption and conflicts.

01:04:43.638 --> 01:04:44.218
Sounds great.

01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:53.180
You've said that you will, quote, slam shut the revolving door between government agencies and the companies they regulate.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.160
That also sounds great.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.460
So here's an easy question.

01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:11.463
Will you commit that when you leave this job, you will not accept compensation from a drug company, a medical device company, a hospital system, or a health insurer for at least four years, including as a lobbyist or a board member?

01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:14.828
Can you just repeat the last part of the question?

01:05:14.848 --> 01:05:15.669
Can I commit to what?

01:05:15.689 --> 01:05:18.972
You're not going to take money from drug companies in any way, shape, or form.

01:05:19.032 --> 01:05:19.132
Who?

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.013
Me?

01:05:20.513 --> 01:05:21.074
Yes, you.

01:05:21.234 --> 01:05:21.414
Oh.

01:05:22.495 --> 01:05:24.457
Yeah, I'm happy to commit to that.

01:05:25.017 --> 01:05:25.938
That's what I figured.

01:05:26.218 --> 01:05:28.520
I said it's an easy question to start with.

01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:31.422
And I think you're right on this question.

01:05:31.442 --> 01:05:33.664
I don't think any of them want to give me money, by the way.

01:05:34.745 --> 01:05:36.286
Let's keep going.

01:05:36.586 --> 01:05:50.934
You're right to say yes, because every American has the right to know that every decision you make as our number one health officer is to help them and not to make money for yourself in the future.

01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:53.555
So I want to talk more about money.

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:55.755
I'm looking at your paperwork right now.

01:05:56.316 --> 01:06:03.037
In the past two years, you've raked in two and a half million dollars from a law firm called Wisner Baum.

01:06:03.717 --> 01:06:11.919
You go online, you do commercials to encourage people to sign up with Wisner Baum to join lawsuits against vaccine makers.

01:06:12.139 --> 01:06:14.320
Now, I worked with him for a year and a half.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.861
I worked for CHD for that year and a half, and I never heard anybody talk about this law firm.

01:06:20.545 --> 01:06:29.016
And I don't hear Bobby Kennedy denying that he made two and a half million dollars over the last year or year or two with this law firm.

01:06:30.089 --> 01:06:38.178
I find it actually quite extraordinary that anybody would be making money from the VICP instead of fighting it as unconstitutional.

01:06:38.238 --> 01:06:50.651
And any lawyer that's using the VICP to get compensation for victims of transfection can't, because of conflicts of interest, actually object to it as unconstitutional.

01:06:52.025 --> 01:07:11.276
That's why Aaron Siri actually can't fight the CICP or the VICP as unconstitutional, as stripping us of Seventh Amendment violations, because he himself uses them, advocates for that as a way for his clients to get compensation from the government.

01:07:11.296 --> 01:07:19.200
Therefore, he can't, at the same time as he's advising clients that the system is usable, also argue against it being constitutional.

01:07:22.765 --> 01:07:39.760
That's why Aaron Seery doesn't use the words strict scrutiny to challenge the PrEP Act, to codify what is missing from it and would justify its unconstitutionality and it's striking.

01:07:44.324 --> 01:07:46.086
And remember, Bobby Kennedy is a lawyer.

01:07:47.389 --> 01:07:58.084
working with those lawyers, also not saying strict scrutiny when suspending fundamental rights, PrEP Act struck, blah blah blah.

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:03.091
You got to wake up, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:03.111 --> 01:08:04.712
No one's going to wake up but you.

01:08:05.073 --> 01:08:08.735
And for everyone who signs up, you personally get paid.

01:08:09.296 --> 01:08:13.319
And if they win their case, you get 10% of what they win.

01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:19.944
So if you bring in somebody who gets $10 million, you walk away with $1 million.

01:08:19.984 --> 01:08:25.148
Now, you just said that you want the American people to know you can't be bought.

01:08:25.248 --> 01:08:27.510
Your decisions won't depend.

01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:31.248
I hope they're glyphosate suits, glyphosate cancers.

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:32.209
I hope that's true.

01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:36.292
Then I think we should be fighting glyphosate a little more than we are now, aren't we?

01:08:36.992 --> 01:08:38.614
Thanks for that tidbit there, Pamela.

01:08:52.552 --> 01:09:07.082
So, Mr. Kennedy, will you also agree that you won't take any compensation from any lawsuits against drug companies while you are secretary and for four years afterwards?

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:13.081
Well, I'll certainly commit to that while I'm secretary.

01:09:13.141 --> 01:09:17.202
But I do want to clarify something, because you're making me sound like a shill.

01:09:20.083 --> 01:09:21.684
I put together that case.

01:09:22.744 --> 01:09:29.446
I did the Science Day presentation of the judge on that case to get it into court.

01:09:29.686 --> 01:09:32.146
Mr. Kennedy, it's just a really simple question.

01:09:32.707 --> 01:09:34.467
You've taken in $2.5 million.

01:09:34.507 --> 01:09:37.168
I want to know if you will commit right now

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:40.717
I mean, if that is glyphosate suits, he should say that.

01:09:40.757 --> 01:09:41.940
I mean, why wouldn't he say it?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:42.802
It's so weird.

01:09:43.427 --> 01:09:54.815
that not only will you not go to work for drug companies, you won't go to work suing the drug companies and taking your rake out of that while you're a secretary and for four years after.

01:09:54.995 --> 01:10:00.619
It's just- I'll commit to not taking any fees from drug companies while I'm secretary.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.183
I'm asking about fees from suing drug companies.

01:10:06.223 --> 01:10:07.784
Will you agree not to do that?

01:10:08.344 --> 01:10:11.485
You're asking me to not sue drug companies.

01:10:11.705 --> 01:10:13.746
Isn't that the dumbest thing you've ever heard?

01:10:13.866 --> 01:10:22.268
Why would anybody on her staff suggest that as being a good question unless it's part of the theater?

01:10:24.109 --> 01:10:30.031
It's just completely teeing him up to say exactly what he's gonna say here and look like a champ.

01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:34.032
You can sue drug companies as much as you want.

01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:38.545
I'm not going to agree to not sue companies or anybody.

01:10:38.605 --> 01:10:50.272
So let's do a quick count here of how, as Secretary of HHS, if you get confirmed, you could influence every one of those lawsuits.

01:10:50.492 --> 01:10:51.833
Well, let me start the list.

01:10:52.313 --> 01:11:00.278
You can publish your anti-vaccine conspiracies, but this time on US government letterheads, something a jury might be impressed by.

01:11:00.738 --> 01:11:08.024
You could appoint people to the CDC vaccine panel who share your anti-vax views and let them do your dirty work.

01:11:08.405 --> 01:11:14.390
You could tell the CDC vaccine panel to remove a particular vaccine from the vaccine schedule.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:21.376
You could remove vaccines from special compensation programs, which would open up manufacturers to mass torts.

01:11:21.816 --> 01:11:27.441
You could make more injuries eligible for compensation, even if there is no causal evidence.

01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:32.525
You could change vaccine court processes to make it easier to bring junk lawsuits.

01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:38.709
You could turn over FDA data to your friends at the law firm and they could use it however it benefited them.

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.351
You could change vaccines.

01:11:40.451 --> 01:11:44.033
I'm not sure that he could do any of this as Health and Human Services Secretary.

01:11:44.073 --> 01:11:46.455
What she's suggesting is that he could change laws.

01:11:46.715 --> 01:11:52.720
Laws like the BICP or the CICP or the PREP Act or the National Vaccine Safety Act or whatever it was called.

01:11:53.341 --> 01:11:54.682
So this is just ridiculous.

01:11:55.518 --> 01:12:14.664
It's ridiculous oration theater, no different, exactly seamlessly linked as a separate act in the same play with Rand Paul and Tony Fauci in front of the Senate in 2020 about the lab leak or 2021, whenever it was.

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:16.265
It's exactly the same.

01:12:16.567 --> 01:12:17.207
and labeling.

01:12:17.247 --> 01:12:19.709
You could change vaccine information rules.

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:26.753
You could change which claims are compensated in the vaccine injury compensation program.

01:12:27.253 --> 01:12:36.439
There's a lot of ways that you can influence those future lawsuits and pending lawsuits while you are secretary of HHS.

01:12:36.839 --> 01:12:42.663
And I'm asking you to commit right now that you will not take a financial stake

01:12:43.323 --> 01:12:50.705
in every one of those lawsuits so that what you do as secretary will also benefit you financially down the line.

01:12:51.445 --> 01:12:54.186
I'll comply with all the ethical guidelines.

01:12:54.206 --> 01:12:55.306
That's not the question.

01:12:55.486 --> 01:12:56.886
You and I, you have said.

01:12:56.926 --> 01:13:02.108
You're asking me, Senator, you're asking me not to sue vaccine pharmaceutical companies.

01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:02.928
No, I am not.

01:13:03.428 --> 01:13:04.428
Yeah, you are.

01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:06.409
That's exactly what you're doing.

01:13:06.929 --> 01:13:10.571
Look, no one should be fooled here.

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:12.192
And that's the magic trick.

01:13:12.372 --> 01:13:14.833
No one should be fooled here.

01:13:16.954 --> 01:13:18.935
That's the neurolinguistic programming.

01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:23.477
That's how they do it.

01:13:23.557 --> 01:13:27.479
It's exactly what they did with Rand Paul and Tony Fauci with the lab leak.

01:13:27.519 --> 01:13:29.981
It's exactly what they will keep doing.

01:13:30.941 --> 01:13:32.302
These are all theatrical

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:39.067
limited spectrums of debate and a very lively debate within that spectrum.

01:13:40.068 --> 01:13:46.934
But all the presuppositions of the narrative are being reinforced by this lively spectrum of debate.

01:13:48.455 --> 01:13:50.177
No, I'm not, Mr. Kennedy.

01:13:50.257 --> 01:13:51.198
No, I'm not.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:59.965
Nobody should be fooled here, says the Senator, and I totally agree.

01:14:00.563 --> 01:14:10.049
Secretary of HHS, Robert Kennedy will have the power to undercut vaccines and vaccine manufacturing across our country.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:21.317
And for all of his talk about follow the science and his promise that he won't interfere with those of us who want to vaccinate his kids, the bottom line is the same.

01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:26.080
Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.761
I want to play that last little bit.

01:14:27.802 --> 01:14:28.542
That was weird.

01:14:28.622 --> 01:14:30.284
That was a weird thing for her to say.

01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:30.885
What was that?

01:14:30.905 --> 01:14:32.706
Billions of dollars while he does it.

01:14:33.047 --> 01:14:34.808
With all the ethical guidelines.

01:14:34.828 --> 01:14:35.929
That's not the question.

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:38.272
You and I, you have said repeatedly.

01:14:38.712 --> 01:14:42.736
Senator, you're asking me not to sue vaccine companies.

01:14:42.776 --> 01:14:43.517
No, I am not.

01:14:44.037 --> 01:14:45.057
Yeah, you are.

01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:47.178
That's exactly what you're doing.

01:14:47.538 --> 01:14:50.038
Look, no one should be fooled here.

01:14:50.358 --> 01:15:00.821
As Secretary of HHS, Robert Kennedy will have the power to undercut vaccines and vaccine manufacturing across our country.

01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:09.523
And for all of his talk about follow the science and his promise that he won't interfere with those of us who want to vaccinate his kids,

01:15:10.223 --> 01:15:14.847
Won't interfere with those of us who want to vaccinate his kids.

01:15:14.967 --> 01:15:17.128
What a weird thing to say.

01:15:21.031 --> 01:15:22.412
That's how you know it's a theater, guys.

01:15:22.672 --> 01:15:23.993
It's just all a theater.

01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:26.415
The bottom line is the same.

01:15:26.936 --> 01:15:36.062
Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he... He can kill off access to vaccines.

01:15:36.803 --> 01:15:39.205
I mean, seriously, kill, kill off.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:52.452
Senator, I support vaccines.

01:15:53.852 --> 01:15:56.174
I support the childhood schedule.

01:15:57.494 --> 01:15:58.375
I will do that.

01:15:58.535 --> 01:16:01.557
The only thing I want is good science, and that's it.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.639
Senator, I support vaccines.

01:16:07.039 --> 01:16:09.341
I support the childhood schedule.

01:16:10.678 --> 01:16:11.539
I will do that.

01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:14.721
The only thing I want is good science, and that's it.

01:16:15.201 --> 01:16:17.503
How about then say you won't make money off of it?

01:16:17.683 --> 01:16:19.184
I support vaccines.

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:22.927
I support the childhood schedule.

01:16:24.248 --> 01:16:25.108
I will do that.

01:16:25.268 --> 01:16:28.291
The only thing I want is good science, and that's it.

01:16:28.771 --> 01:16:32.453
How about then say you won't make money off what you do as Secretary of HHS?

01:16:33.598 --> 01:16:51.046
Before we go to Senator Tillis, I think it would be important for me to make it very clear that Mr. Kennedy has gone through the same Office of Government Ethics process as every single other nominee in the Finance Committee this year and in previous administrations.

01:16:51.627 --> 01:16:59.770
In addition to listing his assets, including the items that you've identified, he has signed an ethics letter that has been reviewed by the Office.

01:17:02.252 --> 01:17:02.872
Thank you, Chairman.

01:17:03.883 --> 01:17:13.951
Mr. Kennedy, I only have five minutes with you, and I've got a lot of experience with CMS, so you're just gonna have to listen.

01:17:15.232 --> 01:17:15.772
Two things.

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:28.322
One, if you want to move from advocacy to public responsibility, Americans are gonna need to hear a clear,

01:17:29.551 --> 01:17:46.870
and trustworthy recantation of what you have said on vaccinations, including a promise from you never to say vaccines aren't medically safe when they in fact are and

01:17:49.659 --> 01:17:59.822
making indisputably clear that you support mandatory vaccinations against diseases where that will keep people safe.

01:18:01.903 --> 01:18:04.003
Okay, so that's a pretty clear question.

01:18:04.023 --> 01:18:06.604
Let's see his response to it.

01:18:08.104 --> 01:18:10.005
You're in that hole pretty deep.

01:18:11.565 --> 01:18:14.946
We've just had a measles case in Rhode Island, the first since 2013.

01:18:17.256 --> 01:18:19.745
And frankly, you frighten people.

01:18:21.499 --> 01:18:32.163
Two, I want to air harms that Rhode Island has experienced from a remorseless, senseless CMS bureaucracy.

01:18:32.503 --> 01:18:34.164
So I don't know what the CMS is.

01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:37.945
I think that's how they reimburse Medicaid and Medicare or something like that.

01:18:38.466 --> 01:18:46.849
And so now he's going to go on a diatribe about how payments aren't paid the same and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, after he said that stuff about vaccines.

01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:49.610
So I'm going to fast forward just a little bit because I do know

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.672
that most of this is kind of irrelevant.

01:18:53.792 --> 01:19:02.198
CMS has for years, forming ACO and its patients and contrary to the public interest, he dies.

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:09.944
Inhumane court order to be awakened, reparable and likely illegal harm be put into

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:12.242
The record is out.

01:19:12.382 --> 01:19:13.902
You're welcome to respond in writing.

01:19:13.922 --> 01:19:20.546
I ask you to take time and perhaps even make a model for better health care everywhere.

01:19:21.546 --> 01:19:22.247
I've said a lot.

01:19:22.447 --> 01:19:23.247
My time is out.

01:19:23.387 --> 01:19:24.908
You're welcome to respond in writing.

01:19:24.928 --> 01:19:26.029
I ask you to take time.

01:19:26.649 --> 01:19:31.972
It's all expensive, frightening, inhumane, and stupid.

01:19:32.892 --> 01:19:37.275
But the insensate CMS bureaucracy takes a court order

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:42.048
to be awakened to the harm they cause.

01:19:43.049 --> 01:19:53.095
Now, remember what he's talking about is, in my humble opinion, the use of this, this incompetent or crappy system to manage the population pyramid problem.

01:19:54.116 --> 01:20:06.444
People are being murdered and it's being hidden behind incompetence, mismanagement, bad protocols, rushing it, running out of money, not funding something.

01:20:07.591 --> 01:20:11.713
It's a combination of lies that hides the murder.

01:20:12.134 --> 01:20:18.837
And it is a coordinated effort by all of these people to agree that all of these lies are important aspects of it.

01:20:19.658 --> 01:20:31.184
And not just say, we need to murder these people because we can't afford to spend money and resources on all of them and extending their life as long as Western medicine could make it.

01:20:33.145 --> 01:20:34.146
We just simply can't.

01:20:42.119 --> 01:20:43.020
I have had enough.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:51.304
CMS should let Rhode Island try humane end-of-life care through CMMI.

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:57.668
Humane end-of-life care is what he is advocating for.

01:20:59.469 --> 01:21:07.334
Humane end-of-life care so that we don't waste all these resources and money and we're smart about it.

01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:10.967
He's not talking about death panels.

01:21:11.828 --> 01:21:15.973
He's talking about end-of-life care being humane.

01:21:20.017 --> 01:21:21.519
Let's see if it works at a state.

01:21:22.079 --> 01:21:27.445
I bet it will save money, serve families better at a very, very delicate time.

01:21:28.413 --> 01:21:34.898
And I wonder if AI will be involved in optimizing the humaneness of our end-of-life care.

01:21:35.598 --> 01:21:39.581
Perhaps even make a model for better health care everywhere.

01:21:40.582 --> 01:21:41.282
I've said a lot.

01:21:41.502 --> 01:21:42.283
My time is out.

01:21:42.443 --> 01:21:43.964
You're welcome to respond in writing.

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:54.312
I ask unanimous consent that the order declaring CMS's actions to constitute irreparable and likely illegal harm be put into

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:57.559
the record without objection.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.581
Let me just respond very briefly, Senator Whitehouse.

01:22:01.482 --> 01:22:11.468
I'm an implacable enemy of tyrannical, insensate bureaucracies and stupid rules.

01:22:11.708 --> 01:22:13.310
And I will work with you.

01:22:14.344 --> 01:22:21.134
make CMS responsive to the needs of Rhode Island and to remedy those disparities that you talk about.

01:22:21.294 --> 01:22:26.582
I am familiar with the Integra health plan.

01:22:27.956 --> 01:22:32.258
And it is a template for what we ought to be doing as a value-based plan.

01:22:33.279 --> 01:22:39.301
And I look forward to you to making sure that we create pilot programs like this.

01:22:40.302 --> 01:22:51.407
Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, one of the things I've learned in my tenure in the Senate is that a nominee saying that they're willing to work with me amounts to exactly zero.

01:22:51.807 --> 01:22:53.228
We need to get this fixed.

01:22:53.248 --> 01:22:53.748
Thank you.

01:22:55.989 --> 01:22:56.310
Next.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:13.662
If you want to move from advocacy to public responsibility, Americans are going to need to hear a clear and trustworthy recantation.

01:23:13.783 --> 01:23:21.329
And so now let's listen to how the health freedom movement responds to the what you just heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:23:21.369 --> 01:23:23.131
say that he supports vaccines.

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:25.613
He supports the vaccine schedule.

01:23:27.574 --> 01:23:31.377
He supports the childhood vaccine schedule, everything.

01:23:31.417 --> 01:23:33.858
He didn't say the word mandate, but that's what he said.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:51.010
Of what you have said on vaccinations, including a promise from you never to say vaccines aren't medically safe when they in fact are.

01:23:52.431 --> 01:23:55.653
And former law school classmates, interesting.

01:23:57.936 --> 01:23:58.517
Interesting.

01:24:00.019 --> 01:24:10.194
Making indisputably clear that you support mandatory vaccinations against diseases where that will keep people safe.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.019
You're in that hole pretty deep.

01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:16.788
We've just had a measles case in Rhode Island.

01:24:17.268 --> 01:24:17.989
The first since 2013.

01:24:18.029 --> 01:24:20.332
And frankly, you frighten people.

01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:49.411
Now, this guy just had an interview on YouTube with a New York Times reporter where he calls himself, among other things, the creator of Breitbart News and also a intellectual property expert, which is very interesting.

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.772
I'm probably going to show that video tomorrow.

01:24:52.611 --> 01:25:08.482
Now, who is this guy going to be in the studio with talking about the failure of Bob F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to speak out usefully against anything but processed food in the confirmation hearing of that day?

01:25:08.582 --> 01:25:09.823
Who's he going to be talking to?

01:25:10.283 --> 01:25:13.226
What's the spin going to be on this for the Health Freedom Movement?

01:25:13.346 --> 01:25:22.372
Number one, do you think they got to him today, rattled him, and do you think he comes out as strong as he walked in as far as the ability to get confirmed?

01:25:22.935 --> 01:25:25.637
Yes, I think that they did not rattle him.

01:25:25.657 --> 01:25:27.098
He is very used to this.

01:25:27.198 --> 01:25:29.019
This is nearly 20 years of this stuff.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.584
And the betting markets were up about 30% after his confirmation hearing today.

01:25:35.904 --> 01:25:37.545
Why was that?

01:25:37.726 --> 01:25:38.926
The betting markets?

01:25:40.888 --> 01:25:43.870
Is she talking about stocks being up?

01:25:45.663 --> 01:26:07.469
Why would somebody who's fighting for the last decade as a children's health advocate be giving a shit about the stock market in response to their supposed bannerman being nominated for HHS secretary and saying that he is pro-vaccine and supports the childhood vaccine schedule?

01:26:09.369 --> 01:26:12.550
She says the stock market's up and that's a good sign.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.381
I think he showed himself very calm and composed under pressure.

01:26:18.941 --> 01:26:21.742
I think the... Because he pulled his punches.

01:26:21.842 --> 01:26:30.605
You know, Megyn Kelly and I wanted to be a little more aggressive, but we're naturally crazy Irishmen, so we want to... Your theory of the case is it's better not to let Bobby Cole change.

01:26:31.005 --> 01:26:35.508
Yeah, my theory of the case is he let these people grandstand and they burned themselves out.

01:26:35.688 --> 01:26:37.330
They showed themselves to be silly.

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:42.013
Talking about onesies at a Senate confirmation hearing is just ridiculous.

01:26:42.493 --> 01:26:45.395
And I think they just wanted to blather on.

01:26:45.456 --> 01:26:46.957
They didn't want to hear answers.

01:26:47.037 --> 01:26:48.898
And that comes across to the American people.

01:26:49.398 --> 01:26:53.101
It was only half of that committee that really wanted to hear the answers.

01:26:53.581 --> 01:26:59.906
If you don't want to hear the answers from the person who's going to be the secretary, you're not serious about that inquiry.

01:27:00.066 --> 01:27:09.012
Now it's important to realize with Mary Holland that Mary Holland was part of Bobby Kennedy's, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

01:27:08.992 --> 01:27:10.713
's original campaign staff.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:22.560
She stopped and stepped down as head of CHD or wherever she was in CHD to work for the campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.803
until the month that I was hired officially as a staff scientist

01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:28.526
under Brian Hooker.

01:27:28.566 --> 01:27:34.331
And then she left the campaign and came back as head of CHD.

01:27:35.552 --> 01:27:41.117
That's very important to remember because she was not just always the head of CHD.

01:27:41.157 --> 01:27:43.138
She's not the founder of CHD.

01:27:43.218 --> 01:27:44.139
Laura Bono is.

01:27:47.382 --> 01:27:49.464
And yet she's the one who is on

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:59.175
Democracy Now in 2015, arguing against Paul Offit on the same team as Rand Paul.

01:28:01.675 --> 01:28:15.920
Not Laura Bono, not Brian Hooker, not Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but Mary Holland, arguing against the fact or arguing that a component of the MMR vaccine may have injured her son.

01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:42.487
This woman now, 10 years later, is claiming victory because the former president of her nonprofit that she's now the head of is nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary, just answered that question with, I support vaccines and the childhood vaccine schedule, and that he has no preconceived notions

01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:51.706
about public health and the vaccine schedule, despite 10 years of preparation and advocacy.

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:58.733
This is the spin she's putting on it now, listen carefully.

01:28:58.753 --> 01:29:01.316
Great, and that's to me what came across.

01:29:01.809 --> 01:29:03.550
Tommy Tuberville sat in that seat.

01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:05.872
He's going to be on the committee tomorrow of health and human services.

01:29:06.332 --> 01:29:14.318
And I asked him, I said, if you know the military industrial complex, the big tech industrial complex, and then you had the big pharma medical industrial complex.

01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:18.582
So he just listed different industrial complexes, which was what?

01:29:19.202 --> 01:29:21.104
That was the rescue the Republic thing.

01:29:21.884 --> 01:29:31.972
Every person that was on stage at the Rescue the Republic rally had behind them a little graphic projected on the screen that had different industrial complexes.

01:29:32.012 --> 01:29:35.335
The military industrial, the pharma industrial, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:49.166
That was the Bret Weinstein, you know, show that everybody was, that Bret Weinstein is now pushing as his, as his best, you know, whatever.

01:29:51.906 --> 01:29:52.666
that he's a hero.

01:29:54.167 --> 01:30:02.352
Now, Bannon basically admits, indirectly but directly, that he was probably involved in that.

01:30:03.633 --> 01:30:12.638
Why else would he cite those specific things in that specific way and then hand the mic back to one of the people involved in that fake show?

01:30:15.339 --> 01:30:18.301
I said, rank order those of the most powerful.

01:30:18.341 --> 01:30:23.886
And he said, Steve, he says, big pharma and medical is so far above military.

01:30:23.946 --> 01:30:24.526
I said, what?

01:30:24.687 --> 01:30:26.048
And he says, not even comparison.

01:30:26.068 --> 01:30:27.048
He says, they're all over.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:27.769
They're everywhere.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.791
They got lobbyists because there's so much money.

01:30:30.271 --> 01:30:31.672
And he says, they're so powerful.

01:30:32.032 --> 01:30:32.613
Is that true?

01:30:33.233 --> 01:30:38.958
I think it's very likely that CHD's undisclosed sources of money are probably mostly from big pharma.

01:30:39.858 --> 01:30:59.635
Because Big Pharma has every reason to control the anti-vaccine movement, to essentially neuter it and sabotage it by putting people in place inside of those organizations that even maybe have real stories but are willing to basically hobble.

01:31:00.532 --> 01:31:11.024
the movement to sell it out, to make sure that they never make any progress or always run in the wrong direction of big top tent of health freedom or vaccine choice.

01:31:15.249 --> 01:31:17.752
If Lunchables were killing kids,

01:31:18.795 --> 01:31:34.782
and being distributed as required eating at schools, in order to attend schools, and Lunchables were deadly to some children, you would not be advocating for school lunch choice.

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:40.045
You would be advocating for getting Lunchables off the menu.

01:31:42.188 --> 01:31:58.606
If Lunchables were a lethal product and they were required, mandated as lunch at schools, you would not advocate for vaccine choice or lunch choice.

01:32:00.228 --> 01:32:00.909
You end it.

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:12.263
And these people, after 10 years of advocating for vaccine choice, are still advocating for vaccine choice now.

01:32:15.185 --> 01:32:22.069
Even in the confirmation hearing of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they are clapping for vaccine choice.

01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:29.723
Well, there are seven lobbyists for every member of Congress from the pharma-industrial complex.

01:32:29.823 --> 01:32:45.489
And of course, seven lobbyists for- And you really think that the guy who was the main strategist described by himself, self-described main strategist of the Trump administration in 2016 isn't aware of how many lobbyists there are per congressman?

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:47.830
Stop lying!

01:32:48.871 --> 01:32:50.131
This is a theater.

01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:51.432
It's a performance.

01:32:53.325 --> 01:32:58.468
designed to hijack the populist whatever in America and make it nothing.

01:33:00.984 --> 01:33:19.842
to make sure no meaningful populist movement ever rises, and anybody that questions the regular mainstream red and white pill bullshit will inevitably find themselves running in the hamster wheels that Steve Bannon and others have curated over the last 5 and 10 years.

01:33:20.402 --> 01:33:25.027
And it is 5 and 10 years, because it started before the pandemic with these people.

01:33:26.303 --> 01:33:27.224
every member of Congress.

01:33:27.544 --> 01:33:32.308
And of course- So you have 535 members, you're telling- I'm telling you that's the number that I've heard.

01:33:32.688 --> 01:33:38.993
Remember, Bobby's budget, $1.9 trillion, is three times the military budget.

01:33:39.353 --> 01:33:49.281
So yes, this is the biggest money center in the cabinet, and it is connected, especially around pandemic preparedness, this is connected to the military-industrial complex.

01:33:49.801 --> 01:33:52.022
So yes, they are extremely powerful.

01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:55.844
And we're seeing this tremendous pushback, which we've been seeing all along.

01:33:55.884 --> 01:34:01.107
But what's important is that Bobby Kennedy is on the cusp of confirmation.

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:04.388
There were thousands of people who came from all over the country.

01:34:04.608 --> 01:34:08.730
I am certain there are millions of people watching the videos that are out there right now.

01:34:09.131 --> 01:34:10.911
This is something the country wants to see.

01:34:10.931 --> 01:34:13.753
The country wants to understand this vaccine issue.

01:34:14.153 --> 01:34:21.440
And they, I think, are behind what Bobby, basically his message was, I want gold standard science and I want radical transparency.

01:34:21.741 --> 01:34:29.148
Those were his- Gold standard science and radical transparency, which could be five years of funded testing.

01:34:32.011 --> 01:34:36.916
Five years of children continuing to get the hepatitis B shot at birth.

01:34:38.228 --> 01:34:42.749
Five years of teenagers still being administered the hepatitis B vaccine.

01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:53.591
And five years of people still taking the COVID shots, especially old people, you know, the part of the population pyramid that needs managing.

01:34:53.611 --> 01:34:59.292
It's core messages.

01:35:00.072 --> 01:35:02.292
Is that why there's so much money through the system?

01:35:02.372 --> 01:35:05.053
Is that why finance goes before the healthcare committee?

01:35:05.713 --> 01:35:06.293
I think so.

01:35:07.193 --> 01:35:09.134
Because you're just talking about the cash is so big.

01:35:09.154 --> 01:35:09.954
It's so great.

01:35:09.974 --> 01:35:11.635
And you have to know somebody's a fiduciary.

01:35:12.536 --> 01:35:16.178
Yeah, and when there's no transparency, how do you know the money's being honest?

01:35:16.458 --> 01:35:16.938
You don't.

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.699
But the money's not being honest.

01:35:18.799 --> 01:35:21.220
But there's no transparency at CHD either.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.742
It's not like they tell you where all their money comes from.

01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:29.305
Where's Bannon's funding come from?

01:35:32.725 --> 01:35:34.966
Where's Kevin McKernan's money coming from?

01:35:35.026 --> 01:35:40.630
Where's Kevin McCairn and Charles Rixey's money coming from?

01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:44.972
Where did Robert Malone's money come from for all the international COVID summits?

01:35:48.314 --> 01:35:54.698
Where is all this money from Locals and Substack coming from?

01:35:54.798 --> 01:35:58.140
Where does Rumble get all its money and funding from?

01:36:02.054 --> 01:36:13.736
See how they get you focused on one dumb little shiny object inside of the limited spectrum of debate and then fight over it and yell about it and throw it back and forth and then it's so exciting you think, oh my gosh, I want that too.

01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:20.117
There's tremendous corruption in the health care sector.

01:36:20.397 --> 01:36:23.938
I don't think anybody disagrees with that in Medicaid and Medicare that they talked about.

01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:25.558
There's tremendous levels of fraud.

01:36:25.878 --> 01:36:32.840
And I think Bobby Kennedy will look at that, and I think he will be positive in undercutting some of that fat.

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:41.582
Your understanding of this industrial complex, your understanding of Bobby Kennedy, the man and the activist, what are the

01:36:43.323 --> 01:36:49.706
one or two most important things he can accomplish for President Trump and the nation as the secretary.

01:36:50.647 --> 01:36:52.848
Radical transparency is number one.

01:36:52.988 --> 01:36:58.651
There are closed books, Steve, that need to be opened about the chronic disease epidemic.

01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:00.812
He is laser focused.

01:37:01.332 --> 01:37:06.995
About the chronic disease epidemic or about the vaccine schedule or about infectious disease?

01:37:07.075 --> 01:37:07.315
What?

01:37:07.395 --> 01:37:08.396
The chronic disease?

01:37:08.836 --> 01:37:10.657
There are books that need to be opened?

01:37:10.737 --> 01:37:10.937
What?

01:37:11.437 --> 01:37:15.161
on overcoming the chronic disease epidemic in this country.

01:37:15.341 --> 01:37:18.865
Over half of adults and children have some kind of chronic condition.

01:37:18.885 --> 01:37:20.286
Define that when you say chronic.

01:37:20.326 --> 01:37:22.929
Chronic means it's not an acute condition.

01:37:23.049 --> 01:37:24.130
It's not an accident.

01:37:24.330 --> 01:37:27.934
He says define that for me and then he starts writing it down.

01:37:28.234 --> 01:37:28.955
Stop lying!

01:37:29.296 --> 01:37:31.518
Holy crap, this theater is terrible.

01:37:31.838 --> 01:37:33.200
it's not an infectious disease.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.824
It means it's asthma, it's diabetes, it's heart disease.

01:37:35.924 --> 01:37:41.272
I mean that guy's wearing a working man's coat and he probably has a manicure every week.

01:37:42.333 --> 01:37:43.134
What a show.

01:37:43.734 --> 01:37:44.415
It's cancer.

01:37:44.535 --> 01:37:45.876
And America's never been like that.

01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:46.837
It's never.

01:37:46.917 --> 01:37:47.818
Something's happened.

01:37:47.858 --> 01:37:52.982
And as Bobby said, there can be genetic susceptibility, but there has to be some environmental trigger.

01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:54.784
And he's an environmental scientist.

01:37:54.824 --> 01:37:56.725
He's been looking at this kind of science.

01:37:56.846 --> 01:37:57.766
What is the trigger?

01:37:58.087 --> 01:37:59.188
What's making this happen?

01:37:59.288 --> 01:38:04.652
As he said, when his uncle was president, there were like 3% of the American public that had chronic disease conditions.

01:38:04.872 --> 01:38:06.073
They weren't spending money on it.

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:08.796
Now it is 90% of our healthcare budget.

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:12.658
And it's not about the money cost, it's really about the human cost.

01:38:12.778 --> 01:38:20.842
I thought it was really poignant when he said, when people are healthy they have a thousand dreams, when people are sick they have one dream, and that's to be healthy.

01:38:24.935 --> 01:38:43.816
Listen carefully to what she says next, because I think this is where you can hear the truth, plain as day, that these people play for the globalists, they play for the transhumanists, they play for the people that are trying to invert our sovereignty to permissions, our sovereignty to experimental animal status.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:44.677
Listen carefully.

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:46.893
Transparency, what else?

01:38:46.993 --> 01:38:48.594
Well, gold standard science.

01:38:48.654 --> 01:38:56.079
The truth of the matter is, Steve, we look at the science around vaccines every day and it is not transparent and it's not honest science.

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.902
What does that even mean, transparent, honest science?

01:39:00.743 --> 01:39:04.465
Is she going to talk about P values and no hypotheses?

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:12.591
Is she going to be talking about the assumptions of the immune response and pathogen associated molecular patterns versus damages?

01:39:12.651 --> 01:39:13.712
No, nothing.

01:39:15.043 --> 01:39:24.245
These are all just buzzwords and nonsense bullshit that is a limited spectrum of debate that sounds really good and means nothing.

01:39:25.105 --> 01:39:30.507
She's a lawyer using meaningless words and that should show you how malevolent her role is.

01:39:31.067 --> 01:39:34.408
Because lawyers that worth their salt don't use any meaningless words.

01:39:34.528 --> 01:39:36.468
They're some of the funnest people to converse with.

01:39:36.588 --> 01:39:39.109
There's fake placebos that are used every day.

01:39:39.489 --> 01:39:43.930
They game who goes into the clinical trials and they hide the data.

01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:46.551
The FDA doesn't do any independent science.

01:39:46.611 --> 01:39:50.653
The drug companies do the science and they feed to FDA basically what they want to feed.

01:39:51.073 --> 01:40:01.858
So Bobby is going to have a lot to do with creating, recreating gold standard signs and bringing in, as he said, people to HHS who are really ready to engage in unbiased science and innovation.

01:40:02.728 --> 01:40:06.829
What do you put his odds today after the finance committee?

01:40:06.889 --> 01:40:08.250
What do you put his odds as confirmation?

01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:09.610
Oh, wait, what did she just say there?

01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:10.671
Was that the part I missed?

01:40:10.791 --> 01:40:12.191
Did I miss that part?

01:40:12.491 --> 01:40:15.072
And they feed to FDA basically what they want to feed.

01:40:15.493 --> 01:40:26.336
So Bobby is going to have a lot to do with creating, recreating gold standard signs and bringing in, as he said, people to HHS who are really ready to engage in unbiased science and innovation.

01:40:27.177 --> 01:40:27.817
Innovation?

01:40:29.722 --> 01:40:31.864
Unbiased science and innovation.

01:40:31.924 --> 01:40:35.026
Innovation is not a word you want to hear out of Mary Holland's mouth.

01:40:38.528 --> 01:40:42.651
What do you put his odds today after the finance committee?

01:40:42.691 --> 01:40:44.172
What do you put his odds as confirmation?

01:40:44.252 --> 01:40:45.253
Better than 50 percent.

01:40:45.313 --> 01:40:46.553
Way better than 50 percent.

01:40:46.634 --> 01:40:47.394
What do you think?

01:40:47.854 --> 01:40:49.535
What does he have to do tomorrow?

01:40:49.576 --> 01:40:51.637
Because Megan and I would love to see more aggressive.

01:40:51.677 --> 01:40:53.078
You're saying you don't understand the game.

01:40:53.098 --> 01:40:54.639
The game's a confirmation.

01:40:55.099 --> 01:40:56.160
Let the Democrats punch in.

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.921
Think about what they accuse him of.

01:40:57.961 --> 01:40:59.921
They accuse him of being a nut job.

01:40:59.961 --> 01:41:02.803
They accuse him of being an anti-vax conspiracy theorist.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.643
So what's the best antidote to that?

01:41:04.943 --> 01:41:09.325
To be deliberative, to be calm, to be sober-minded, to be rational.

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:10.926
I think that's what he showed today.

01:41:11.006 --> 01:41:12.286
I think that's what he'll show tomorrow.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.007
One of the things that was most impressive.

01:41:14.127 --> 01:41:21.850
Is he being sober-minded and rational by saying that he supports vaccines, he supports the vaccine schedule, he wants to protect the vaccine schedule?

01:41:24.082 --> 01:41:30.788
Or is he just being disingenuous from the perspective of some people that have fought for this for a decade?

01:41:31.068 --> 01:41:32.449
It just sounds like lying.

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:35.071
It just sounds like selling out.

01:41:36.112 --> 01:41:46.441
I don't come into HHS with any preconceived notions seems to mean that in the last 10 years of advocacy, these people haven't learned anything worth telling you.

01:41:49.123 --> 01:41:52.166
Or haven't managed to summarize it into an elevator pitch yet.

01:41:53.098 --> 01:42:11.625
working with you guys last couple of years the people involved with it with you working with you guys for the last couple of years go look it up and see go look up and see how much much bannon has promoted chd as the movement it's a wonderful admission because it's true

01:42:12.714 --> 01:42:13.674
more than a couple years.

01:42:30.619 --> 01:42:33.161
I just talked to people who flew in from Hawaii, Steve.

01:42:33.181 --> 01:42:38.345
I talked to people who flew in from Illinois, people who drove all night, people who waited in line at one in the morning.

01:42:38.705 --> 01:42:42.308
People want somebody who cares about people in that job.

01:42:42.548 --> 01:42:48.913
I think we've seen Alex Azar, Scott Gottlieb, people who really came out of pharma and they went back to pharma.

01:42:48.993 --> 01:42:54.537
Bobby's never been in pharma, he's never been in corporate interest, and he's there for the people.

01:42:54.837 --> 01:42:55.478
As you said, he doesn't

01:42:55.598 --> 01:43:03.303
But he's always been handled by Meryl Nass and Mary Holland, which is not a very good sign of independence.

01:43:03.584 --> 01:43:07.366
He doesn't need this job to be secretary, but he wants children to be healthy.

01:43:07.426 --> 01:43:08.847
He wants our country to be healthy.

01:43:09.128 --> 01:43:12.150
Explain to our audience, what is Make America Healthy Again?

01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:13.711
What does the MAHA movement stand for?

01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:18.970
It stands for taking America's health back from corporate interests.

01:43:19.290 --> 01:43:22.731
The corporate interests make money on sick people.

01:43:23.091 --> 01:43:24.611
We have a sick care system.

01:43:24.671 --> 01:43:26.171
We don't have a health system.

01:43:26.431 --> 01:43:26.791
Five more minutes.

01:43:26.811 --> 01:43:29.472
I think Bobby wants it to be a system that supports health.

01:43:29.792 --> 01:43:30.792
And that's good food.

01:43:31.052 --> 01:43:32.012
That's good medicine.

01:43:32.232 --> 01:43:33.273
That may be supplements.

01:43:33.573 --> 01:43:34.933
That may be use of AI.

01:43:35.033 --> 01:43:36.213
That may be telemedicine.

01:43:36.333 --> 01:43:40.314
It's really- Supplements and

01:43:41.056 --> 01:43:44.257
Supplements and AI, says Mary.

01:43:44.658 --> 01:43:48.279
That might be supplements and AI, says Mary.

01:43:48.719 --> 01:43:55.442
That might be supplements and AI as a medical device which would need FDA approval.

01:43:57.315 --> 01:44:00.437
I'm gonna continue this show over the course of the whole week.

01:44:00.497 --> 01:44:07.782
There's no way I can possibly get it all in all the time because it's just so crazy how long I could go about this stuff.

01:44:08.283 --> 01:44:12.245
But ladies and gentlemen, Team Worst Case Scenario is the reason why we are here.

01:44:12.325 --> 01:44:14.147
Team Worst Case Scenario got us here.

01:44:14.647 --> 01:44:17.909
That's the reason why in 2025, most people think it was a lab leak.

01:44:17.949 --> 01:44:24.174
Team Worst Case Scenario might've been headed by at least two people, namely Robert Malone

01:44:24.914 --> 01:44:27.558
and Kevin McKernan of the Human Genome Project.

01:44:27.578 --> 01:44:38.851
The reason why I'm onto these people is because I've had a lot of personal interaction with them and a lot of experience with them not telling the truth about me, my work, or the coronavirus pandemic.

01:44:39.611 --> 01:44:44.217
I think it's culminated in this guy, Kevin McKernan, lying about how the book

01:44:44.797 --> 01:44:46.758
written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:44:46.818 --> 01:44:50.880
and Children's Health Defense was written, and who participated in it and who didn't.

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:55.982
And those lies are very, very well recorded on the Danny Jones podcast.

01:44:56.483 --> 01:45:03.066
Can't be erased or forgotten, and neither can his five-year history in the pandemic where he started out.

01:45:03.826 --> 01:45:09.369
uselessly objecting to the WHO's PCR test, but not the PCR in general.

01:45:09.749 --> 01:45:18.855
And that means that he perpetuated the narrative of a novel virus that could kill millions, that millions more were saved from, that might come from gain of function if not this time, next time.

01:45:19.295 --> 01:45:21.496
And that's why he is still there now.

01:45:22.417 --> 01:45:26.439
The only difference is now he says the shots are contaminated and it could be gain of function.

01:45:26.899 --> 01:45:31.902
Whereas in the beginning, he actually said that it might be natural and it was just here before in like October.

01:45:33.035 --> 01:45:44.402
And so Team Worst Case Scenario is composed of a lot of people that have had a myth and a part of the mythical script that they pushed for the first couple of years while the murder in America was occurring.

01:45:44.962 --> 01:45:46.623
And that narrative trap is this one.

01:45:47.083 --> 01:45:58.010
And all of that narrative trap is constructed with myths about a spike protein that causes outcomes that are actually expected for transfection.

01:45:59.093 --> 01:46:04.880
Transfection being the vaccine that they call the vaccine for COVID is really just a transfection.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:10.886
And Kevin McKernan's little line about PCR working just not the who's PCR is part of this.

01:46:12.034 --> 01:46:37.038
little screen mythology and embedded even within his bullshit is the idea that there's cardiac damage or mitochondrial damage or prion disease or amyloidosis or long COVID is all expected outcomes of transfection being misconstrued as outcomes of the novel virus that Kevin McKernan is sure has been tracked around the world to the tune of more than 18 million sequences.

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:48.052
That's why none of them are gonna tell you about the fact that the FDA needs to approve AI as telemedicine, as an advisor, as a medical device.

01:46:48.532 --> 01:46:53.934
And there are laws coming out about it because this is all part of the same illusion.

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:57.815
They don't want you to understand PCR as a diagnostic fraud.

01:46:59.255 --> 01:47:03.716
They don't want you to know that the only thing that they have is synthetic recombinant genetics.

01:47:03.756 --> 01:47:06.677
They can make a lot of DNA and they can put it somewhere.

01:47:07.711 --> 01:47:16.094
And by making a lot of DNA and putting it somewhere, that's all they would need to do to take a background signal and misconstrue it as a spreading novel pathogen.

01:47:17.635 --> 01:47:23.297
And that would be enough for you to take their tools to identify their ghosts and think you're a ghostbuster.

01:47:25.658 --> 01:47:28.359
And they did that because transfection was always a crime.

01:47:28.379 --> 01:47:32.501
They were never gonna be able to roll it out unless they had a really elaborate excuse

01:47:33.652 --> 01:47:37.955
And unless they could get away with rolling out placebo for that elaborate excuse.

01:47:38.035 --> 01:47:39.836
Billions of doses are necessary.

01:47:40.717 --> 01:47:41.538
We're going to rush it.

01:47:42.158 --> 01:47:43.859
And now they have a cover story for both.

01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:52.946
And that cover story has its basis in the idea that an RNA molecule can go from a mud puddle to something called endemic.

01:47:54.022 --> 01:48:19.757
And that was seeded before the pandemic by all these virology narratives and all these gain-of-function papers that enabled the mythology of a PCR test that described a novel virus to take hold, to be reinforced by a bunch of liars on the internet that can't tell you the truth, that RNA cannot pandemic, that intramuscular injection is dumb, that transfection of healthy people is a crime, or that we have a population pyramid problem that needs managing.

01:48:20.217 --> 01:48:21.958
And so they murdered people and lied about it.

01:48:22.018 --> 01:48:23.239
And people are getting rich.

01:48:24.019 --> 01:48:28.500
continuing to lie about it.

01:48:29.561 --> 01:48:30.681
Thank you very much for joining me.

01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:32.081
I will be here again tomorrow.

01:48:32.281 --> 01:48:36.102
As usual, we will be here every day now until something better happens.

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.283
Thanks very much for joining me.

01:48:37.323 --> 01:48:41.544
I'll see you again tomorrow around the same time, 10, 11, something like that.

01:48:42.124 --> 01:48:42.484
Thank you.

01:48:42.544 --> 01:48:42.844
Thank you.

01:48:42.924 --> 01:48:43.284
Thank you.

01:48:43.364 --> 01:48:43.784
Thank you.

01:48:44.085 --> 01:48:44.405
Thank you.
