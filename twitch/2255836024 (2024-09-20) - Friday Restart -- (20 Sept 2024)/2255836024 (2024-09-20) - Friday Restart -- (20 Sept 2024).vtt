WEBVTT

00:48.806 --> 00:58.915
Oh, the next thing that I want to say is our lack of biological knowledge and the general poor health of the, of America, of the American people is being used to create the crisis.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.878
They need to divide and conquer us to ruin maybe America.

01:03.038 --> 01:04.980
I don't know, crash the dollar.

01:05.180 --> 01:10.084
I don't know, steal the rest of our, our, what limited treasury value we have left.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.367
I don't know, but I know for sure.

01:13.752 --> 01:31.183
that they are combining our lack of biological knowledge and our general society's lack of good health and access to health care to create a crisis to usher in all kinds of changes that would otherwise never be necessary, and more importantly, never be possible.

01:33.348 --> 01:40.094
If you think about it, you know, if we're defining vaccine really liberally, and these COVID vaccines are vaccines, the flu vaccine is vaccine, okay.

01:40.514 --> 01:43.557
But actually, they're kind of cheating when they're calling these things vaccines.

01:43.637 --> 01:53.085
And, you know, anything with really rapidly fading efficacy, such that you need shots within a year, you know, Canada's saying nine months, is as actually J.J.

01:53.105 --> 01:59.691
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

02:56.907 --> 02:59.712
He can't help when he's happy, he looks insane

03:45.178 --> 03:46.268
Oh yeah!

04:21.448 --> 04:23.969
Living far between all illegal, all the same.

04:24.029 --> 04:34.073
He even calls, but the road like butterflies.

04:34.793 --> 04:44.717
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away.

06:25.279 --> 06:27.303
He chases them away, yeah.

06:27.483 --> 06:32.031
Oh, I just wanna thank him.

06:32.111 --> 06:36.840
He'll begin his life again.

07:35.090 --> 07:37.071
He's scheduled for 60 minutes next.

07:38.152 --> 07:42.836
He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

07:44.261 --> 07:46.031
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

07:47.620 --> 07:48.344
It's embarrassing.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.074
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

08:40.094 --> 08:47.217
Good morning from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

08:47.797 --> 08:54.560
Transfection in healthy humans was always criminally negligent, and RNA cannot pandemic because viruses are not pattern integrities.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.501
Welcome to the show, everybody.

08:56.561 --> 09:03.805
Coming to you live again about this mystery virus that doesn't equal excess deaths because it really is just a long list of

09:04.605 --> 09:05.126
Lies.

09:05.526 --> 09:12.892
Lies and murder and lies and liars and murder and lies and some lies and some financial incentives to commit fraud and lies.

09:13.592 --> 09:27.643
And that's the reason why there's no epidemiological evidence of spread and why the lawyers involved in this won't use the word strict liability to mean one idea and definitely won't say anything that resembles anything to do with the 7th Amendment violation.

09:28.824 --> 09:48.579
uh murder and lies ladies and gentlemen i really believe i believe with my whole heart and soul that we need a new consensus about transfection always having been criminally negligent in healthy humans that the vaccine schedule in the usa was a criminal enterprise before the pandemic and rna can't do that

09:50.681 --> 10:00.694
There is definitely a reason why these people have created an illusion of consensus and how they did it was sticking to a limited spectrum of debate.

10:00.794 --> 10:02.616
That's the reality of things.

10:03.197 --> 10:07.422
I know it's sometimes very hard to accept that social media is really not

10:08.744 --> 10:15.709
The free speech, I'm gonna escape here for just one second and then start it again.

10:17.130 --> 10:20.032
Free speech is not what they sold us.

10:21.353 --> 10:24.476
At least free speech on the internet is not what they sold us.

10:24.816 --> 10:29.360
And fighting against one team or the other team is really just sitting in that chair.

10:30.060 --> 10:34.244
And so it is, whoa, yeah.

10:35.157 --> 10:36.519
That is funky fast.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.804
It is really a new kind of totalitarianism.

10:41.086 --> 10:50.940
It's something where to get your head around it, you need to see this as a continuation of a theater that was in place before the pandemic.

10:51.661 --> 11:07.407
And the only difference now is that the highly trained acolytes have a much greater access to our consciousness, much, much greater access to our attention, because we have willfully given it to them via social media.

11:07.467 --> 11:15.751
That's the reason why, no matter how hard you run in the hamster wheel, it's these people who are going to be in front, these people who are going to be

11:16.371 --> 11:36.803
the pseudo-heroes that the narrative is telling you are coming to the rescue, or the bad guys that are trying to trap you, or vice versa, and these are all part of the same show that really would like you to argue about which one of these people is more significant than the other.

11:37.603 --> 11:52.129
Who are we going to vote for is always a question, but I'm becoming pretty pessimistic about that because the same weaponized piles of money seem to be using the same acolytes on social media to convince us what to argue about and with whom to argue.

11:54.099 --> 12:07.029
And the latest iteration of that seems to be the Rescue the Republic, Join the Resistance nonsense, where many of the same pseudo-patriots are pretending to come to our rescue.

12:07.069 --> 12:12.434
Heck, even Russell Brand will be there to lead the opening prayer, I'm sure.

12:13.715 --> 12:22.402
Ladies and gentlemen, after they convinced us what to argue about and with whom to argue, we basically accepted the premise of their narrative by default.

12:23.513 --> 12:26.174
And that's how we are being governed.

12:26.274 --> 12:38.159
That's one thing I've come to learn during the pandemic, that this isn't just about marital affairs and stock trading and lying about those things.

12:38.199 --> 12:39.820
This is about lying about everything.

12:40.760 --> 12:50.565
And for decades now, the Human Genome Project, something that I based my understanding of biology on for a very long time and approached

12:51.505 --> 13:00.247
my investigations in neurobiology based on the idea that the Human Genome Project represented something that was done.

13:01.467 --> 13:12.710
Gigaohm Biological comes from the gigaohm seal that was used in the methodology to make high resistance, low noise recordings from neurons in the brain and that's why I

13:13.664 --> 13:18.469
very not cleverly took those words and applied them to a news program.

13:18.489 --> 13:19.370
That's where we are now.

13:19.410 --> 13:31.401
If you want to see the stain of my AkataMagic work, you can look on PubMed for my last name and find all the papers that I participated in producing.

13:31.962 --> 13:37.287
If you want a list of reasons why you might want to listen to me, why I saw the alien,

13:39.131 --> 13:43.372
Number 11 and number 12 and number 13 on this list are pretty interesting.

13:43.473 --> 13:45.633
Anyway, welcome to the show.

13:45.673 --> 13:47.934
It's the 20th of September of September 2024.

13:48.014 --> 13:55.656
This is Gigaohm Biological, a high-resistance, low-noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

13:56.337 --> 13:59.678
I'm coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.439
I'm very happy to be here.

14:02.479 --> 14:19.671
It's been a few days off because we had a sudden transition to homeschooling with my middle son and not that that necessarily is a big deal, but it did throw a little wrench in my morning preparation time and my morning sort of schedule and being able to focus on me.

14:20.932 --> 14:26.135
And the stream between, you know, let's say pre-sunrise and 10 a.m.

14:26.816 --> 14:29.057
Which I wasn't better able to do today.

14:29.157 --> 14:31.278
So although I am late, I am here.

14:32.279 --> 14:33.499
So good to see everybody.

14:33.559 --> 14:34.940
Thanks very much for being here.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.843
I'm going to fade this out and make that go away.

14:41.884 --> 14:42.584
Let me see.

14:42.704 --> 14:43.645
How does this work?

14:43.785 --> 14:44.505
Is this going to work?

14:45.166 --> 14:47.127
I'm going to try and pull off a new trick here.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.268
I don't know if it's a good trick or a bad trick or what.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.257
Does that work?

14:52.578 --> 14:53.798
Oh, I almost did it.

14:55.298 --> 14:56.159
Welcome to the show.

14:56.239 --> 14:57.759
My voice feels terrible.

14:57.779 --> 14:59.840
I've also taken a couple of days off because of that.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.260
I still have pain in my throat.

15:02.001 --> 15:06.142
I'm still gonna occasionally haze out, but hopefully you can tolerate it.

15:07.202 --> 15:09.223
As I said, it is the 20th of September, 2024.

15:09.763 --> 15:18.006
It's Friday, thank goodness, but since I'm so behind on my schedule and on my output, a whole week of class missed.

15:19.146 --> 15:31.490
I have a lot of work to do so it's Friday for you and Friday for your family and and I hope that that means that you can look forward to a weekend where a lot of you will still get sun and a lot of you will still have warm weather so please go out and enjoy it.

15:32.991 --> 15:44.655
All of our young chickens have started to lay eggs now and so it's become unbelievably loud out there as they tell everybody that they've completed their work for the morning so it's a

15:46.166 --> 15:51.888
Try to if you can hear that in the background or they start to stand in front of the door again Make sure you understand that it's okay.

15:51.928 --> 15:52.688
Everything is fine.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.129
There's not a fox in the backyard.

15:54.169 --> 15:59.150
They're just happy with their progress We're gonna keep doing this work.

16:00.451 --> 16:05.833
I do Next week want to get back to biology 101 and back to my friend Matt's

16:07.612 --> 16:12.355
probability class, uncertainty class, if you will, and I definitely will do that.

16:13.575 --> 16:30.404
But it has become obvious to me, especially because of the steadfast work of Mark Kulak at Housatonic ITS, Housatonic Live, that there is a lot of repetition to be done.

16:31.206 --> 16:54.201
There's a lot of repeating to be done, because making sure that everybody understands how these ideas have descended from person to person until we are here, and why the people who are most responsible for this sort of chain of mentors and ideas are the people that we're not really talking about.

16:56.202 --> 17:01.785
Even both sides of the debate agree that we shouldn't talk about those people.

17:02.526 --> 17:08.909
Even the people within this narrative are not questioning each other's omission of those people.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.391
And in fact, it seems as though without Mark,

17:14.671 --> 17:16.712
Nobody would be talking about these people.

17:17.432 --> 17:23.354
No one would be talking about Joshua Lederberg and his seminal role in the formation of these ideas.

17:23.494 --> 17:27.896
Nobody would be talking about Hilary Kaprowski and what he brought to our vaccine schedule.

17:28.476 --> 17:33.838
Nobody would be talking about anybody beyond Stanley Plotkin and Bill Gates.

17:35.407 --> 18:01.355
And that's an extraordinary thing to figure out when you realize that Robert Malone is DITRA, and DITRA is nukes, and nukes is the Department of Energy, and the Human Genome Project is the Department of Energy, and if the Nunn-Lugar program was to form DITRA and now DITRA were to be involved in biological weapons, it would be very,

18:01.995 --> 18:03.376
Very bizarre, wouldn't it?

18:03.516 --> 18:09.561
If Robert Malone was the guy who came out in 2021 and said, hey, I'm Ditra and I'm here to save you.

18:10.102 --> 18:11.242
Domain, domain.

18:12.744 --> 18:13.504
I'm Robert Malone.

18:13.544 --> 18:14.465
I invented the thing.

18:15.586 --> 18:23.492
It's a very, very odd narrative when you start to look back with scrutiny and objectivity at 2020 and 2021 to see where we are in 2020.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.862
That's the part of this that makes it so extraordinary.

18:32.864 --> 18:40.056
We can actually do an exercise in recent human history in a way that no one would have ever been able to do before.

18:41.698 --> 18:58.428
Think about how many sources and how many videos would have been available to you if in your teenage years, in let's say 1982, you decided that you wanted to research the last five years.

18:58.468 --> 19:01.130
You wanted to go back to 1976, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, and really figure out how we got to 1982.

19:08.374 --> 19:12.056
How many resources would be readily available to that citizen?

19:12.096 --> 19:14.577
How many sources of information?

19:14.798 --> 19:21.481
How much could you bring back from the public library after an afternoon of running the copy machine?

19:22.802 --> 19:26.304
Because now, in an unprecedented way,

19:28.106 --> 19:35.128
You can, from 2024, look back to 2020 and objectively ask, what were these people really saying?

19:35.848 --> 19:36.968
And how were they saying it?

19:37.028 --> 19:38.388
What words did they use?

19:39.989 --> 19:43.990
And if you do it, I guarantee you, I promise you, you will find the truth.

19:45.330 --> 19:47.731
And the truth will be in the patterns.

19:49.251 --> 19:53.252
The truth will be in the patterns, the words that they chose,

19:54.480 --> 19:56.981
the certainty that they had or did not have.

19:57.741 --> 20:02.342
And these things will feel different from the context of 2024.

20:03.202 --> 20:10.603
As you remember very distinctly how you were uncertain about things in 2020 and uncertain about things in 2021.

20:11.543 --> 20:20.105
There were some people who were extremely certain in 2020 that they knew exactly what was going on and exactly where we were going.

20:22.266 --> 20:23.606
And I think that's pretty significant.

20:25.888 --> 20:43.400
I think it's pretty significant that a lot of those people over there are people that fall into this category of curiously certain, curiously focused, curiously aware of certain things, but not other things.

20:44.821 --> 20:49.304
And that pattern holds true for almost everybody on that red team over there.

20:50.044 --> 20:53.927
Don't talk about 2020, the COVID shots are bad team.

20:55.930 --> 21:01.511
There are few things more dishonorable than misleading the young, and a lot of these people are misleading the young right now.

21:04.972 --> 21:19.595
And we're at a crucial time because we, in this chaos, may be able to take back power from these charlatans, may be able to make it common knowledge that we have been under the spell of these charlatans for generations.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.315
It's possible.

21:21.696 --> 21:24.317
and in a way that has never been possible before.

21:24.377 --> 21:29.999
Breaking this would not have been possible, even in 2015, it would not have been breakable.

21:31.340 --> 21:50.727
But right now, by their own design, the level of uncertainty and doubt is so high that although they have control right now, they have the guy and the cruise ship is going where they want it to go, nobody is technically at the wheel right now.

21:53.206 --> 22:00.872
And so it's only by the sheer momentum of where we're going that we're still going in the direction they want us to go.

22:00.912 --> 22:03.494
We are not actually on their script anymore.

22:03.714 --> 22:10.660
On their script would have been far more people having taken the shot in a far less of a debate than we're having right now.

22:11.921 --> 22:18.386
And that is the reason why there are so many people out there right now helping to curate the debate.

22:20.305 --> 22:39.951
That's the reason why X has to play such a prominent role, why the podcasts and streams on YouTube have to play such a prominent role right now, because we are in a place with a level of dissonance that they never really intended us to get to.

22:42.369 --> 22:44.511
And of course, they can't allow you to see that.

22:44.651 --> 22:53.659
They can only toggle in more people and toggle in more sub narratives that allow the control necessarily of more people.

22:55.043 --> 23:05.331
Because the alternative is, is that all these people who understand that the main narrative being curated by these people is a lie, the same lie that these people are curating.

23:06.011 --> 23:15.218
Once that starts to happen, you need different compartments for these people, or they all come together and realize that, wow, we are being enslaved.

23:17.113 --> 23:22.697
And so that's the reason why you see an unprecedented amount of noise on the internet.

23:22.737 --> 23:33.583
It's not because they wanted this necessarily, but it's because it's been necessary given the level of compliance that they have not been able to maintain.

23:33.623 --> 23:35.585
But I assure you, without a doubt,

23:36.465 --> 23:41.972
that within this plan, there are plenty of things built in and plenty of knobs built in.

23:41.992 --> 23:48.921
They just need to keep the current system in play and the vast majority of the people are still engaged.

23:50.363 --> 23:52.986
As long as we've been out of the system, I mean, it's not...

23:54.994 --> 24:04.178
This illusion of consensus, of course, expands from, you know, dissidents like these two that wrote a paper in 2020, which I'll talk about in a minute.

24:04.678 --> 24:06.959
George Webb and Jessica Rose, same thing.

24:07.459 --> 24:13.782
And Robert Malone and Paul Cuttrell, who at one point in 2021 were streaming together a few times.

24:14.707 --> 24:27.051
And I think you can learn something very interesting about the narrative and the breakdown and how far they are off narrative if you go to YouTube and see what Paul Cuttrell has been putting out for the last few weeks.

24:28.572 --> 24:29.872
It is extraordinary.

24:29.932 --> 24:30.933
Look at his views.

24:31.733 --> 24:32.913
Listen to the content.

24:33.614 --> 24:34.654
Watch the chats.

24:36.519 --> 25:02.321
And this is someone that in 2020 was promoted as a hero by George Webb and lots of other people, reported to get a whistleblower phone call from Taiwan saying that Remdesivir was working in February or March of 2020, and streamed with Robert Malone in his first months of publicity, right after and before the Brett Weinstein appearance.

25:03.120 --> 25:18.637
This guy, some random dude who works for a Catholic charity or something like that, claiming that he was a doctor when he wasn't, still calling himself Dr. Paul Cottrell when he's not an MD.

25:20.419 --> 25:24.604
He claims to have completed two years of medical school, but I'm skeptical.

25:26.226 --> 25:34.428
And of all the people on the internet, Robert Malone practiced his schtick with him first, like very early on.

25:35.148 --> 25:46.951
It is on Paul Cottrell's podcast that Robert Malone said that they were using dexamethasone as a hammer on the immune system to be able to put people back out of the hospital and back to care homes.

25:47.911 --> 25:55.733
I wonder if they put them back in care homes with supplementary oxygen, the perfect combination to get people to die of COVID

25:57.196 --> 26:04.085
The only person at the beginning of the pandemic to call COVID, COVID, is Robert Malone.

26:05.587 --> 26:07.669
Oh yeah, there's one more guy I'm gonna show you in a second.

26:11.054 --> 26:14.859
And so it is with great displeasure

26:18.131 --> 26:36.197
that I admit to you that for three or four years, I really thought I was not sitting in a chair with goggles on holding a joystick, but I was engaged in an ongoing debate about how to get the truth out and about what the truth was.

26:38.238 --> 26:41.419
And the primary place that this was going on was on Twitter.

26:42.580 --> 26:51.763
and on places like the Panda Slack group or something like that, or Signal Chats, and all of these things were an illusion.

26:51.843 --> 27:08.808
That's the reason why after almost two years straight of having these same biological principles, repeating them over and over again, all of these people have decided not to adopt any of these ideas, not to take them for themselves even.

27:11.465 --> 27:25.016
but instead have tried to create this limited spectrum of debate about who I play for or whose government I'm working against or who I'm taking money from as we barely are able to pay rent every month.

27:25.136 --> 27:26.677
I'm still losing subscribers.

27:26.757 --> 27:31.661
I have lost more paid subscribers this month than any other month.

27:31.721 --> 27:39.006
And I guess it's because I'm not putting out the right shows or not saying the right things or going against too many people.

27:39.106 --> 27:39.507
I don't know.

27:40.831 --> 27:52.318
But the reality is, is when the truth is here and everyone ignores it, I don't know what else to do other than repeat it or to show it from many different angles.

27:52.378 --> 27:53.439
And so that's what we're going to do.

27:53.459 --> 27:58.823
We're going to keep doing this because the murder and lies are about to be forgotten.

27:58.883 --> 27:59.583
That's the goal.

27:59.623 --> 28:00.824
They're running out the clock.

28:02.489 --> 28:07.553
I should have wound up my watch so that that ticking is in the background because really that's what this is.

28:07.633 --> 28:11.456
They are running out the clock so that this history is lost.

28:11.516 --> 28:17.942
And the history of 2020 and 2021 is a history that we really need to understand and understand well.

28:20.677 --> 28:37.027
And I think some of the ways to understand this history are to understand that there are good explanations for some of the phenomenon that apparently no one else but GigaOM viewers can see the limited spectrum of debate that's been created, like the limited spectrum of debate about PCR.

28:38.487 --> 28:45.672
It is extraordinary how well understood the PCR reaction is

28:47.037 --> 28:56.485
in the context of an academic bench setting and how it can be used to show a protein is here or an RNA is there or whatever they want to do.

28:57.966 --> 29:12.359
And yet they know exactly how to use it well, but those same academics are unaware that none of those optimizing, none of those controls were used in the context of PCR as a diagnostic for COVID.

29:13.257 --> 29:15.478
but the TV is never gonna tell you that.

29:15.599 --> 29:29.187
And more curiously, Robert Malone, Merrill Nass, Jessica Rose, Matthew Crawford, James Lyons Weiler, Mary Holland.

29:29.247 --> 29:39.554
I mean, all of these people aren't gonna explain to you that there are all kinds of ways to make PCR highly accurate and it's been used on the academic bench successfully for decades to do that.

29:40.839 --> 29:56.590
but in a diagnostic setting with only one amplicon that's not necessarily been shown to be specific, with primers not necessarily shown to be specific, is not really the same as how PCR is used in an academic context to high fidelity detection.

29:58.191 --> 29:59.852
And even there, there are caveats.

30:01.434 --> 30:06.097
But nobody's explained that to you but us here at Gigaohm Biological, me and the chickens.

30:07.304 --> 30:12.788
So how virology can be a lie, but transfection and transformation can be misconstrued as virology.

30:12.868 --> 30:22.575
This is what, after being asked to send a letter on behalf of CHD to the no-virus crew, this is precisely what I told them.

30:23.776 --> 30:28.200
I said that I think I have a biological explanation how both sides can be right.

30:29.162 --> 30:36.164
and we can become a unified front about this stuff, about this fraud of virology and it comes from infectious clones.

30:36.684 --> 30:53.548
And instead there became this thing where they tried really hard to make it seem like they wanted nothing to do with me and that I must be an idiot if I'm working with CHD and they needed to have papers to understand what these infectious clones were because otherwise they weren't going to debate anything with me.

30:56.069 --> 31:03.234
And it was around that same time that I was on Bobby's podcast with five other people that I got no time and they got all the time.

31:03.674 --> 31:10.559
And that same time when five no virus people got together all at once to talk about how dumb my ideas were.

31:10.940 --> 31:20.887
Around that same time is when the Human Genome Project prodigy Kevin McKernan also called the idea of infectious clones being a chemtrail retarded idea.

31:23.462 --> 31:31.904
And so again, there's not going to be anybody who's going to explain why Cooey is wrong about virology basically being an exaggeration.

31:32.505 --> 31:40.507
But transfection and transformation in cell culture in animals can be misconstrued as virology, and they do that all the time.

31:41.047 --> 31:48.229
The reason why they're able to do that is because cells naturally package RNA and DNA and send it around.

31:49.343 --> 31:50.364
It's not unusual.

31:50.965 --> 31:53.267
You're not making a cuckoo clock make toast.

31:53.307 --> 32:05.781
You're just kind of encouraging a cell to do what it would otherwise probably have a propensity to do if there was RNA just floating around that didn't belong there or was extra.

32:07.478 --> 32:09.220
or whatever the case may be.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.921
I don't need to know that biology.

32:11.021 --> 32:18.949
You just need to know that they have misconstrued these things as virology and not told you anything about exosomes and extracellular vesicles.

32:19.729 --> 32:23.453
And finally, the population pyramid provided a booming opportunity.

32:23.553 --> 32:29.238
I have become convinced in the last few days off that actually this

32:30.598 --> 32:40.609
Part of my presentation is one of the things that they really needed me to stop saying, and that's the reason why we chased around clones for so long.

32:40.649 --> 32:45.454
And they allowed McKernan and other people to pay a lot of attention to clones.

32:45.995 --> 32:48.558
Even Sasha was paying a lot of attention to clones.

32:48.698 --> 32:51.241
Even Jiki said, yeah, it could be clones.

32:52.674 --> 32:53.294
And why?

32:53.955 --> 33:03.422
Because at that time, I had already started saying that Denny Rancourt's data was interesting and the population pyramid could be an added part of this.

33:05.103 --> 33:09.467
And so I got an email from Joe Marshall of the Liberty Perspective.

33:09.507 --> 33:16.031
He had already done all kinds of research and links and highlighted stuff about this idea.

33:17.043 --> 33:19.585
And whether or not they had talked about it during the pandemic.

33:19.605 --> 33:22.868
So shout out to Joe for having my back on that one.

33:24.209 --> 33:28.612
I want to start out with a more general part of this just so everybody can see it.

33:30.734 --> 33:32.355
Let me get myself a little tinier.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.556
Oops.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.758
A little tinier over here.

33:36.659 --> 33:42.503
Let's see if I can do this quick without screwing anything up.

33:42.783 --> 33:44.465
So that you can see there, that's a

33:49.195 --> 33:49.755
Hey, look at that.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.897
That's a pyramid there.

33:53.638 --> 33:57.320
And these are population pyramids for the United States, 2000, 2010, and 2020.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.983
Now remember what these population pyramids represent, right?

34:05.625 --> 34:08.506
The light blue here are males.

34:09.067 --> 34:10.768
The dark blue are the females.

34:11.448 --> 34:12.249
This is in the year 2000.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.490
And then this is the distribution.

34:14.530 --> 34:17.352
What you have over here at the top are a hundred year olds.

34:18.328 --> 34:22.399
And then going down all the way to the bottom, you have kids under five.

34:22.439 --> 34:26.390
And then, so it's every one of these bars is five years of age.

34:26.751 --> 34:27.011
Okay.

34:28.092 --> 34:32.315
So in 2000, we had a certain number of old people.

34:32.715 --> 34:35.376
And in 2010, we had a certain number of old people.

34:35.416 --> 34:37.798
In 2020, we had a certain number of old people.

34:38.318 --> 34:43.321
And it might not really look like that much, but I want you to pay close attention to this bump here.

34:43.922 --> 34:47.284
This bump represents roughly the baby boomer generation.

34:47.324 --> 34:52.727
And if we look at where that bump is, and then we follow it every 10 years, we can watch it move up.

34:53.789 --> 35:00.052
it moves up the population pyramid and behind it are other bumps, but they're not as big as this bump.

35:00.612 --> 35:15.539
And more importantly, at the same time here, it's very important that you figure this into your model of understanding that end of life care is becoming better and better.

35:18.277 --> 35:23.720
triage medicine is becoming better and better, and we're just getting better at taking care of people, right?

35:23.760 --> 35:32.784
Now, at the same time, of course, people are becoming less healthy, but we can save them from dying better and better in this 20 years, and so people are gonna get older.

35:35.069 --> 35:37.210
And so you can watch this bump go up, right?

35:37.250 --> 35:39.932
You can see it going up, but then people are also dying.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.653
So it's not going to be a perfect thing.

35:41.693 --> 35:42.794
It doesn't move up like this.

35:42.854 --> 35:46.477
It's got to shrink as it goes up because it's, it, people die, right?

35:46.537 --> 35:47.297
That's what happens.

35:47.337 --> 35:56.143
That, that age group is never going to stay the same from age five, all the way to age 50, because even between then and there, people are killed, people die, whatever.

35:56.844 --> 36:00.386
So you need to watch this and think about how this would move.

36:00.486 --> 36:04.329
If you can animate this in your head, you can go back, you know,

36:05.329 --> 36:16.293
Hundred years here and you can imagine that this population pyramid looked like this a hundred years ago And now it's kind of changing and it's morphing into this thing That is not a pyramid anymore.

36:16.353 --> 36:32.960
And that's we just don't we understand this what I'm suggesting to you is is That the people who wrote these books understood it to Writing books right after World War two they understood that so as they reduced

36:34.093 --> 36:43.138
As they reduced the population size and growth by reducing family size, which they most certainly did after World War II.

36:43.158 --> 36:47.560
I mean, in the 60s, people were still having 10 kids or eight kids.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.582
My father's family is a small family of six kids.

36:53.643 --> 36:56.865
Now we are a relatively large family with three kids.

37:00.239 --> 37:02.322
And so this trend is known.

37:02.342 --> 37:11.355
These people who have presumed to govern us, I assure you, know that this trend exists and know that there is potential here.

37:11.415 --> 37:13.278
Why let an opportunity go to waste?

37:13.799 --> 37:16.322
Let's look carefully at one particular group.

37:16.863 --> 37:18.765
the group that's about to retire.

37:19.385 --> 37:31.055
And let's draw a red line here to see about how many people that are about to retire, about to go on Medicaid and Medicare, about to put all of their expenses off of their employer and onto the government.

37:31.095 --> 37:34.557
About half of the budget of the U.S.

37:34.617 --> 37:40.662
government every year goes to these people and the poor that are on Medicaid and Medicare.

37:40.702 --> 37:41.303
So let's look.

37:42.564 --> 37:43.385
Drop a line in.

37:44.341 --> 37:50.784
In 2000, the number of people that were about to retire here are around 7 million.

37:51.925 --> 37:54.766
In the year 2010, it's now 10 million.

37:54.926 --> 37:57.488
And in the year 2020, it's beyond that now.

37:57.548 --> 38:00.169
This was 9 million, now it's like 11 or 12 million.

38:01.029 --> 38:09.494
And so this is happening everywhere around the world in the Western world, anywhere where they've developed in the developed world, this is happening.

38:10.495 --> 38:15.304
And so there is going to be a natural increase in all-cause mortality.

38:17.267 --> 38:23.698
And all you need to do is take a few of those people and sweep them together and you can get pretty good peaks.

38:25.779 --> 38:47.013
pretty good numbers to report on the PBS NewsHour if you start from zero and then say a few thousand people died, knowing that you're expecting that rise and knowing that the military industrial complex is going to take advantage of that rise and sweep a few of them together to create the illusion of a crisis.

38:49.315 --> 38:50.896
And if you're on the governing team,

38:51.932 --> 38:59.363
If you play for them and you've been playing for them, then you're not that worried about this because you know what's going to happen in four years.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.708
You know that they're going to be telling a story about more people dying.

39:03.149 --> 39:06.534
It's not going to surprise you that some of them are coming from the shot.

39:08.354 --> 39:10.155
and cancer from the shot.

39:10.535 --> 39:30.204
These are all things that will obviously be on the script if you knew already five years before the pandemic that there was going to be a play by the military industrial complex that runs the Western world to use this trend across all of these countries to invert national sovereignty to a global governance system.

39:31.055 --> 39:35.640
to invert individual sovereignty to some kind of neocommunism.

39:35.700 --> 39:47.152
This is exactly what they don't want to talk about, and would be happy to have us argue about infectious clones and virology for the next three years.

39:48.934 --> 39:50.616
Because once the clock runs out,

39:51.787 --> 40:08.691
Once the kids have accepted it, once the college kids that we abandoned in 2020 are adults and have accepted that this phenomenon doesn't exist, this phenomenon's not real, we may be lost.

40:11.348 --> 40:19.453
So please, anybody that wants to, find the numbers, check the numbers, look for the numbers that suggest that this is wrong.

40:20.154 --> 40:29.060
Because what's much more likely is that even the official numbers have been doctored to hide the significance of this.

40:30.458 --> 40:36.060
Because what if they just shaved a little bit off of here and shaved a little bit off of here?

40:36.440 --> 40:38.661
How much more money that represents?

40:38.721 --> 40:40.682
How much more potential catastrophe?

40:40.802 --> 40:47.944
And on the flip side, how much bigger of an opportunity does that present to this 30, 40, 50 year plan?

40:51.144 --> 40:58.670
where before they even knew anything about the genome, they already knew that we were going to be taking over our evolution.

40:58.710 --> 41:09.859
We were going to be pulling on our big boy pants as a species and taking over our evolution because that's what our destiny is, to become gods.

41:12.489 --> 41:15.070
And this is where these ideas come from.

41:15.210 --> 41:17.831
That's why we had a pandemic now.

41:17.931 --> 41:25.234
That's the reason why Tony Fauci knew we'd have a pandemic now, because 10 years before this, they knew we would have a pandemic now.

41:25.314 --> 41:31.096
Not all of them, but I bet you Henry Kissinger knew.

41:31.116 --> 41:34.118
I bet Joshua Lederberg knew.

41:34.138 --> 41:39.620
I bet a lot of these people have known for a long time that they've been preparing for this.

41:40.543 --> 41:46.708
Maybe even that 9-11 was kind of a rehearsal, you know, all of those things are getting things into place.

41:46.748 --> 41:51.692
You know, lots of people have told you that a lot of these laws are kind of already there.

41:51.752 --> 41:51.972
Yeah.

41:51.992 --> 41:52.213
Yeah.

41:52.253 --> 41:52.533
Yeah.

41:52.573 --> 41:57.317
Because they have been planning, planning for this.

41:59.107 --> 42:19.215
planning to tell this story and planning to create this limited spectrum of debate where they could essentially cover up the fact that the vaccine schedule in America has always been a criminal enterprise, that this transfection thing is always the place that they were going to take us and they were gonna use the old vaccine schedule and this as a repair.

42:19.695 --> 42:25.678
Imagine if all of us had taken the transfection, how easy it would be for them to tell a story

42:26.687 --> 42:30.469
that the old vaccine schedule was kind of bad, but this one's really, really good.

42:30.569 --> 42:35.192
Or at least the one without the DNA contamination in it is going to be really, really good.

42:35.572 --> 42:39.815
And it's going to be like a plug and play thing where we don't even really need the FDA anymore.

42:45.918 --> 42:50.021
And so RNA cannot pandemic, ladies and gentlemen, I can't say it any simpler than that.

42:50.241 --> 42:53.643
And that's the reason why they can't do anything but ignore that.

42:54.043 --> 42:54.143
Um,

42:55.165 --> 43:04.417
There would be more biological refute of that simple statement if there was any, and it would be all over Twitter, hand-dunking on me all the time, but it's not.

43:04.577 --> 43:09.563
Instead, these people have blocked me, tried to get you to argue about something else.

43:10.424 --> 43:13.908
That's the reason why Jimmy Dore only was on Twitter.

43:14.689 --> 43:17.450
on Joe Rogan in 2021, like the rest of them were.

43:17.910 --> 43:28.212
And that's the reason why now Jimmy Dore can have somebody like Nurse Campbell on his show in 2023, or somebody from Panda in 2023.

43:28.672 --> 43:42.695
That's why in 2024, now we even have somebody like Vinay Prasad coming around to some idea that maybe the shots, vaccines still, not transfections, hurt people, even though, of course, they're sophisticated enough to know.

43:42.775 --> 43:43.115
And now

43:43.855 --> 43:45.997
Only now is Robert F. Kennedy jr.

43:46.037 --> 44:08.751
Becoming a mainstream dude and the whole idea of vaccine skepticism is starting to become okay And the reason why that is is because that was always part of the plan part of the controlled demolition of America Is to have these heroes in place that can say well, you know we we did really screw up a lot of stuff and we've known it was screwed up for a long time and

44:10.970 --> 44:14.073
And so all these people are parachuting in to save us.

44:15.014 --> 44:20.019
And it is insane to think that any of these people have ever been playing for us.

44:20.079 --> 44:22.942
They have been part of this governing elite, the

44:23.763 --> 44:26.766
the acolytes on social media for a very long time.

44:26.786 --> 44:29.649
And that's the reason why it's not new people.

44:30.169 --> 44:31.691
It's not grassroots people.

44:31.771 --> 44:38.858
It's the same people getting moved around on the board and reappearing for years and years and years with the exact same claims.

44:38.898 --> 44:41.120
And that's why it's really important to look backwards.

44:41.741 --> 44:45.465
It's important to go back to 2020 and see what these people were doing.

44:46.531 --> 45:03.361
Ask yourself what Claire Craig was doing before the pandemic and you find out that she was involved in a 100,000 Genomes Project and sampling genomes just in the same way that a lot of these other people are interested in, like James Lyons-Weiler in 2019.

45:03.421 --> 45:13.847
Here he is in this video talking about how vaccines hurt a subset of genetically vulnerable that can only be identified by canvassing the whole population.

45:15.145 --> 45:22.732
And that's how we will make the vaccine schedule safe and vaccine preventable diseases are spreading asymptomatically among the vaccinated.

45:22.752 --> 45:24.473
And so we have to be aware of that as well.

45:24.974 --> 45:37.926
What an interesting thing to say a few months before a pandemic where asymptomatic transmission is central to people's belief in the biological phenomenon in the first place.

45:37.986 --> 45:41.569
They have to believe that it's for a time undetectable.

45:43.561 --> 45:57.728
And that's extraordinary because he already was seeding that narrative before the pandemic and not saying that vaccines are bad and that vaccines shouldn't be given to kids, but there are some kids who can be vulnerable to them or hurt by them.

45:58.168 --> 46:04.972
It's so absurd to not see the truth for what it is because this same guy

46:06.249 --> 46:12.495
at the beginning of the pandemic already knew all kinds of things that he shouldn't know and should not have known.

46:12.575 --> 46:18.741
This guy has been on stage for CHD like six or eight times in the last few years.

46:19.481 --> 46:22.985
This is one of the most prominent voices that CHD promotes.

46:25.515 --> 46:28.477
other than Merrill Nass, which again, here you go.

46:28.557 --> 46:43.786
You have a person who was involved in a limited spectrum of debate about vaccines that was not an objection to them, just a plea to make them safer and a hope that the government would.

46:44.756 --> 46:56.603
not that dissimilar from James Lyons Weiler, who although he claims to be this guy who's fighting on that side, is actually advocating just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

46:56.644 --> 47:01.306
for safe vaccines, for tested vaccines, and for incidentally, the

47:03.496 --> 47:09.638
the sampling of the population to find out why some people are especially vulnerable to vaccines.

47:09.678 --> 47:27.662
And maybe it's aluminum, or maybe it's thimerosal, and that's the same narrative that Mary Holland came out with in 2017 on Democracy Now, opposite of Paul Offit, which if you see that video, it would just shock you.

47:28.202 --> 47:29.443
Thank you very much for that.

47:31.567 --> 47:32.567
And so let's watch this.

47:32.607 --> 47:38.389
This is from, as you can see from the pink line, in case you haven't figured out my coding here, it's from early 2020.

47:38.910 --> 47:49.734
And here he is talking to an Australian because of course we've got to get the word out about what's happening in America to make sure that Australia understands that their lockdown is working.

47:51.774 --> 47:54.495
And this video is freely available on YouTube.

47:55.055 --> 47:56.116
It was never canceled.

48:00.543 --> 48:03.345
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Under the Wire.

48:03.425 --> 48:09.471
I'm sorry for the late start this morning, but we have an amazing program for you today.

48:10.311 --> 48:18.839
We have one of the few scientists, real scientists in the world, with us, Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, and I'm hoping I'm pronouncing his name right.

48:18.879 --> 48:20.360
I hope he'll correct me if I'm not.

48:21.781 --> 48:34.430
And he is joining us today to talk about the, not only the COVID-19 outbreak, but also a study that he's doing on vaccinated versus unvaccinated children.

48:35.230 --> 48:42.175
And also he's done amazing work into the toxicity of aluminium when it comes to vaccinations.

48:42.695 --> 48:45.117
And we're going to talk about a whole range of things.

48:45.237 --> 48:49.500
So I'm hoping that we can cover a lot of stuff.

48:49.681 --> 48:53.784
And you guys, I'm just lowering this volume down because I think I'm blowing your eardrums out.

48:54.584 --> 49:00.149
And I'm going to, without further ado, switch over to James.

49:00.649 --> 49:03.291
James, thank you so much for being with us this morning.

49:03.371 --> 49:03.851
Welcome.

49:04.932 --> 49:05.733
Thank you so much, Meryl.

49:06.394 --> 49:11.177
Okay, so obviously you're in the United States and the U.S.

49:11.437 --> 49:24.344
is having the same sort of problems with COVID-19 that we're having in Australia, perhaps on a grander scale because you have 330 million people versus our 24 million people.

49:24.904 --> 49:29.266
So that's a lot more people to actually get sick.

49:29.766 --> 49:31.928
But I wanted to speak with you

49:32.908 --> 49:34.329
about your impression.

49:34.409 --> 49:44.634
You have done some work into coronavirus and the spike proteins, especially in coronavirus.

49:44.694 --> 49:58.642
Now, first of all, I want to speak with you about what your impression is about where we're going with this right now, with the lockdown, with the whole situation with people being told that they have to stay at home and they

49:59.762 --> 50:01.883
are at risk if they go out of the house.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.063
Perhaps I'm going ahead of myself.

50:04.143 --> 50:07.004
You start with what you think is most important to begin with.

50:07.925 --> 50:08.605
All right, well, thank you.

50:08.645 --> 50:25.510
Well, I wanted to back up a little bit and say that the reason why things are as bad as they are in the United States, the United States having probably now a third of the world's cases of coronavirus, New York State alone having more deaths than any other country.

50:28.081 --> 50:31.462
Yeah, so we're in dire straits, and how did we get there so fast?

50:31.482 --> 50:40.303
We got there so fast because the CDC declined to use that test that was offered to them by Germany.

50:41.044 --> 50:45.344
On January 16th, Germany had a test that was already validated.

50:45.364 --> 50:49.805
141 other countries had already adopted it, and CDC said no.

50:49.825 --> 50:50.225
The U.S.

50:50.265 --> 50:53.526
CDC said we need to make our own test because our job

50:53.945 --> 50:57.349
is to be the most important lab on the planet.

50:57.829 --> 51:02.394
Our job is to validate everybody else's test, so we can't use Germany's test.

51:02.775 --> 51:09.302
Now the funny thing is, the funny thing about this is, is that this narrative in retrospect is very strange.

51:10.145 --> 51:18.347
Because here's James Lyons-Weiler saying that we didn't want to use the WHO test because we wanted to use our own and that the CDC wanted to make their own.

51:19.127 --> 51:31.310
Now, if you recall the entire narrative, you will recall that in December or November of 2020, a group of authors headed by people like Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig of Heart,

51:32.302 --> 51:37.946
wrote an objection to the WHO PCR test, the Corman-Dwarston PCR test.

51:38.526 --> 51:46.150
And the objection was like a 10-point objection to the design of it and the quick approval of it and the 24-hour peer review of it.

51:46.371 --> 51:50.173
And Mike Yeadon and Thomas Binder were also on that paper.

51:51.340 --> 52:00.882
And it's a very curious assembly of authors in 2020 that says that a WHO test wasn't actually very good.

52:01.642 --> 52:15.745
And it was crap in late 2020 that here, James Lyons-Weiler is sure that the reason why we're having so much trouble in America is because we didn't use the test that the WHO and Germany offered us.

52:16.445 --> 52:34.907
which a few months later we're going to have Kevin McKernan and Claire Craig and Mike Yeadon and Thomas Binder publish a paper saying that that who test was crap and that Joristan is shady and that the primers make dimers and that that thing is full of false positives.

52:34.967 --> 52:36.128
What an interesting

52:37.069 --> 52:38.571
year 2020 was?

52:38.651 --> 52:51.883
Are you interesting debate between these people about the PCR tests and whether they're useful and why they would be and why they're not useful and what were the results of selecting one or not selecting one and who got in the way?

52:51.943 --> 52:53.505
Was it the FDA or the CDC?

52:55.484 --> 53:03.607
I see a limited spectrum of debate being curated here and interestingly curated across national borders, across Five Eyes countries.

53:04.087 --> 53:07.288
This is a guy doing a podcast in Australia.

53:07.348 --> 53:10.409
No one from Australia has ever asked me to do a podcast.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.491
Looks like another egg got laid.

53:16.331 --> 53:21.173
We have to, you know, be the great one and we have to validate everyone's tests.

53:21.233 --> 53:22.033
They made a test.

53:22.705 --> 53:23.825
They shipped the test out.

53:23.945 --> 53:35.488
This is when the people on the Princess cruise ship that were on lockdown there, they tested a lot of people and their tests came back saying, this person has it, this person doesn't.

53:36.148 --> 53:39.809
And then they released people that they said that the test was negative.

53:40.049 --> 53:42.070
Now they were under observation, but they released them.

53:42.670 --> 53:45.651
And some people just left and went their very way.

53:46.331 --> 53:48.871
And it turned out that their test was flawed.

53:49.792 --> 53:50.992
They had made a mistake.

53:51.906 --> 53:59.029
And because of the errors in the test, people were reusing that test and relying on the test and still testing with that test.

53:59.569 --> 54:03.171
Then they said, well, wait a minute, this person died of COVID-19.

54:03.591 --> 54:05.612
And the pathologist says it's COVID-19.

54:06.052 --> 54:08.113
The pulmonologist says it's COVID-19.

54:08.693 --> 54:14.476
The molecular test that we run says that the virus is there, but your test doesn't.

54:14.796 --> 54:16.197
They contacted CDC.

54:16.237 --> 54:19.138
This took a week and a half before they figured out there was something wrong with the test.

54:19.764 --> 54:26.148
And so they wasted that precious time where they could have done real testing with real contact tracing with the test from Germany.

54:27.449 --> 54:30.530
And we have basically no contact tracing in the United States whatsoever.

54:30.931 --> 54:31.831
No, no meaningful.

54:31.891 --> 54:40.116
And the CDC then changed the rules on how to use the test rather than use three of the primer probe sets, just use two of them.

54:40.837 --> 54:45.841
And basically, Anthony Fauci, he's on the, Tony Fauci, he's on the news every day.

54:47.162 --> 54:52.867
He turned to the companies and said, the corporations and said, well, can you guys help us out?

54:53.448 --> 55:01.495
Well, it turned out that the FDA wasn't giving company tests or emergency use approval to give the CDC a heads up, a leg up on testing.

55:02.015 --> 55:06.619
How can the US CDC possibly validate other people's tests if they can't make their own tests?

55:06.659 --> 55:08.901
And I'm confused as towards why they,

55:10.122 --> 55:18.175
can't make an accurate test, I personally right now could teach everybody on the call how to make an RT-PCR test in about three days.

55:18.696 --> 55:23.002
With three days instruction online, I could say this is how you make an RT-PCR test.

55:24.955 --> 55:26.456
I don't think you'd need three days.

55:27.316 --> 55:28.837
It's very funny that he says that.

55:28.937 --> 55:33.639
And it's also very funny that he predicts already that he's, I mean, he always mentions that he's teaching.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.780
He did say COVID.

55:36.400 --> 55:39.182
He repeated COVID often, and here it is already.

55:39.282 --> 55:42.143
The debate is how do the PCR tests work or not?

55:42.683 --> 55:52.328
Remember, at the exact same time, Kevin McKernan is going on the Vance Crowe podcast to talk about how he's using the PCR test to test weed for COVID.

55:53.679 --> 55:55.120
Kevin McKernan says kovat.

55:55.160 --> 55:59.404
He doesn't say covered like Robert Malone and James Lyons.

55:59.524 --> 56:18.900
Why a Wyler say It's very very interesting video it's on YouTube if you want to watch it So again, you know, I keep going back to Robert Malone because I like I think these people are team Robert Malone I think that if anybody You know

56:20.191 --> 56:21.892
Whitney Webb doesn't mention DITRA.

56:21.932 --> 56:26.375
The only person who mentions DITRA is 2020 Robert Malone.

56:27.076 --> 56:33.860
The only one who mentions the domain program is 2020 Robert Malone, 2021 Robert Malone, nobody else.

56:34.781 --> 56:37.123
He's almost forgotten about the domain program now.

56:38.228 --> 56:46.256
and almost forgotten that DITRA did all the sequencing of the virus for everybody for at least the first year of the pandemic.

56:46.276 --> 56:47.858
Why does nobody care about that?

56:48.538 --> 56:52.022
It wasn't, you know, people sequencing the virus on their bench.

56:52.542 --> 56:54.464
It requires hundreds of primers.

56:55.285 --> 56:56.426
It requires like,

56:57.566 --> 56:59.228
a lab at DITRA to do it.

56:59.588 --> 57:00.629
That's how they did it.

57:00.829 --> 57:03.071
I don't care if you can do it in other places.

57:03.671 --> 57:11.458
The reality is, is that DITRA controlled all the sequences and all of that, you know, because it was a national security thing.

57:12.119 --> 57:23.609
DITRA, the same group that supposedly Robert Malone had spun up his DITRA team at the beginning of the pandemic because Michael Callahan called him from Wuhan and told him to.

57:28.325 --> 57:38.176
And so COVID shots are bad, don't talk about 2020 is the strategy that somebody like Kevin McKernan is using now because he doesn't want you to look back and see what he was doing in 2020.

57:39.847 --> 57:54.134
And that's why I think it's very curious that his co-author, Dr. Claire Craig, can also be seen in 2021 doing some pretty sketchy videos where there's not really any useful skepticism, but who own an acceptance.

57:54.174 --> 57:54.354
Wow.

57:54.394 --> 57:55.714
Why did that Dutch word come out?

57:56.315 --> 57:59.276
Just an acceptance of the narrative.

58:00.377 --> 58:01.157
Listen carefully.

58:03.131 --> 58:03.231
you

58:11.823 --> 58:15.946
Now the truth is that we don't fully understand the transmission of this disease.

58:16.527 --> 58:20.450
And we don't fully understand the transmission of other respiratory viruses either.

58:20.510 --> 58:22.352
So it's important we talk about that first.

58:22.872 --> 58:26.615
I'm going to talk about the lack of evidence for asymptomatic transmission.

58:26.635 --> 58:37.484
I believe there is a link on Housatonic Live's website where you can see that actually there is a newspaper report that DITRA was doing all the sequencing at the beginning of the pandemic.

58:38.689 --> 58:46.359
If Mark is not on his ladder listening to us in his headphones, then maybe he'll drop in a link, but I don't expect that to happen.

58:46.399 --> 58:47.921
He's got better things to do.

58:48.281 --> 58:51.345
And then the importance of hospital spread.

58:52.930 --> 58:57.693
Now, all of the modeling has been done on the basis that SARS-CoV-2 spreads like measles.

58:58.434 --> 59:00.515
Measles spreads person to person.

59:00.956 --> 59:03.677
There's a continuous chain of transmission that happens throughout.

59:03.777 --> 59:15.826
Now, remember, Claire Craig, before the pandemic, was a cancer person and a clinical pathologist, which means she does a lot of testing and looking at things under a microscope and works in a clinical laboratory.

59:16.486 --> 59:18.308
And she was part of a 100,000 Genomes Project.

59:22.469 --> 59:29.153
She's not just some doctor, you know, like Meryl Nass is just some doctor in the Northern part of Maine.

59:29.993 --> 59:45.542
This is a person who already had a long professional career as a tester, a sampler, and a enthusiast of using genetics to track down causes of diseases.

59:46.880 --> 59:51.061
Whether or not that biology is robust or not is not the point here.

59:51.121 --> 01:00:02.525
The point is, is that that is the biology and the idea set that is fueling this mythology that all these people have bought into and have accepted foisting on our children.

01:00:03.505 --> 01:00:05.086
They have to know they're lying.

01:00:05.626 --> 01:00:13.749
And if they don't, then they are capable of learning what they have unwittingly foisted on our children.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.081
And so this can't be by accident.

01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:19.062
This is definitely not by accident.

01:00:19.102 --> 01:00:19.902
She's got a book.

01:00:21.803 --> 01:00:24.084
Her hair is going gray in a weird way.

01:00:24.184 --> 01:00:26.345
She wears these funny pointed glasses.

01:00:26.865 --> 01:00:30.526
They always make her kind of seem like this little old lady that she's not.

01:00:30.746 --> 01:00:32.307
It's horrible, I know.

01:00:33.007 --> 01:00:37.952
to be this skeptical of somebody that a lot of people think is a hero, but she's not a hero.

01:00:38.012 --> 01:00:40.294
There's no way that she is a hero.

01:00:40.374 --> 01:00:42.636
She is exactly the same as Robert Malone.

01:00:42.676 --> 01:00:47.701
She just plays a little bit different role because she has a little bit different set of attributes.

01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:51.339
but she's no different than Jessica Rose.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.662
She's no different than Pierre Corey.

01:00:54.123 --> 01:01:03.013
She's no different than any of these other people that as long as they stick to their little show, they feel pretty comfortable because they don't really have to lie if they do that.

01:01:05.016 --> 01:01:05.957
And that's the trick.

01:01:12.259 --> 01:01:24.133
year and somebody who's infected will go into an environment, home or school, where there are susceptible people who will then catch it and you will have more secondary cases than that primary case.

01:01:25.274 --> 01:01:27.777
An alternative model would be influenza.

01:01:28.738 --> 01:01:30.899
Now, we don't fully understand influenza.

01:01:31.699 --> 01:01:41.464
It does spread person-to-person, there is evidence of that, but it's not the whole story, because in influenza, it disappears over the summer, and then it comes back in winter as a surge.

01:01:42.204 --> 01:01:48.988
And those surges happen at the same latitudes across the world, simultaneously with the same genetic profile.

01:01:49.688 --> 01:01:56.111
And that can't be explained by person-to-person transmission, and it happened well before we had international travel the way we do now.

01:01:59.194 --> 01:02:00.054
with influenza.

01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:06.559
So it's a really curious assembly of pseudo-skepticism and certainty, right?

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:21.151
Because at the same time as she tells you how the flu is a biological phenomenon that cannot be explained by person-to-person spread, she's now going to go on to tell you that we have to understand all of these phenomenon as person-to-person spread.

01:02:23.342 --> 01:02:34.251
This is a magic spell that's so full of contradiction that the only way you can listen to her is to accept each premise on its own without evaluating them as a whole.

01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:42.799
And so no matter how incongruous the ideas are, she keeps just listing them.

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:56.390
And as long as you only see the blonde hair and the pointy glasses and the charming accent, then you don't realize that you are being told a mythology, a set of lies that don't work together.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:05.055
that don't mechanistically explain anything and a model that doesn't stand up to validation, but she doesn't care because she's going to tell you that is the truth.

01:03:05.435 --> 01:03:09.618
That this model doesn't stand up to validation, but I'm going to explain it to you first.

01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:19.464
Then I'm going to tell you that a lot of this is bullshit because the government is lying to you, but first understand it and that is how they get you.

01:03:21.189 --> 01:03:27.531
Because with that amount of contradiction, there is no combination that leads to understanding where a light bulb goes on.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:40.236
And now I get it, except for that there is a novel virus that millions of people died from, that millions more could be saved from, and that will definitely come again because these phenomenon are all out there, even though we don't really understand them.

01:03:44.747 --> 01:04:00.591
And if you look carefully at what these people have done over the last five years, you will see that all of them have performed a version of this, where none of them have ever been willing to go all the way and say, we have to stop.

01:04:04.392 --> 01:04:10.374
And the first time I ever said stop was May 2021, when I finally released a review that wasn't right.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.476
still available on my website because it's Scooby.

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:33.691
It's evidence of how bamboozled I'd become that I was so sure there was a virus that it was mutating because we had decided to arrogantly transfect people against a particular protein and caused a huge change, evolutionary rate of change in that protein because the shot was working.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:35.092
And so we had to stop.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:41.117
The only thing that was right in that whole text was that it was transfection and we should have done it to nobody.

01:04:42.186 --> 01:04:43.662
that it could cause autoimmunity.

01:04:44.448 --> 01:04:59.495
But everything else in there fully accepted the limited spectrum of debate of a novel virus and the consequences that might come if it was from a laboratory or it was special or somehow or another we didn't understand the biology well enough to know what to do.

01:04:59.576 --> 01:05:07.139
And we made a rash decision and transfected people against a protein that we shouldn't have done it because the virus was changing and yada, yada, yada.

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:12.342
I'm arguing in that limited spectrum of debate that was reinforced by people like Claire.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:23.856
and reinforced by people like Jonathan Engler, who just recently this year wrote a virology review that was supposed to be some kind of crucial move in this game of chess.

01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:34.083
And remember, I was supposed to be a co-author on that because Jessica Hockett really, really trusts these guys.

01:05:36.985 --> 01:05:41.868
And they, of course, gave themselves away partially because they wouldn't criticize Claire.

01:05:43.513 --> 01:05:47.617
And no matter what kind of silly things she said, nah, you know, I got to leave her alone.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.478
Claire's a good guy.

01:05:48.498 --> 01:05:49.859
There's lots of different opinions.

01:05:49.919 --> 01:05:52.381
Nick Hudson defended her like that.

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:55.384
J Jonathan Engler defended her like that.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:56.846
And all of them did.

01:05:58.107 --> 01:06:01.190
And it became instantly apparent to me what these people were doing.

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:02.471
They weren't sharing my work.

01:06:03.939 --> 01:06:06.320
They weren't saying where they got their ideas.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:19.766
They were diluting them, and they were limiting them, just like Kevin McCarran has done, just like Charles Rixey has done, just like Robert F. Kennedy did with my work in his book.

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:24.849
The parts of my work that fit into this mystery of a novel virus are there.

01:06:24.909 --> 01:06:27.070
The skepticism that fits in is there.

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:37.518
But the statement, the unequivocal statement that RNA cannot pandemic did not make it into the book, because as in RFK's own words, this is not the book for that.

01:06:38.098 --> 01:06:43.122
This is a historical document of what people said during the pandemic, and I accepted it.

01:06:44.872 --> 01:06:49.073
But that doesn't change the fact that we have the truth at our fingertips.

01:06:49.413 --> 01:06:51.513
It is right here for the taking.

01:06:52.014 --> 01:06:55.054
Anybody that wants to go on the internet and assemble it can do it.

01:06:55.134 --> 01:07:00.335
And whatever you assemble, even if it has different pieces, will result in the same picture.

01:07:02.376 --> 01:07:07.237
Because once you're shining your light in the right cave, then wherever you point the flashlight is good.

01:07:08.646 --> 01:07:13.967
That's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen, as I titled this stream, Friday Restart.

01:07:14.727 --> 01:07:27.931
I feel better than ever, because I know that we are hovering around the target now, that there's almost no, we can't miss anymore, as long as we are not distracted by the show.

01:07:30.111 --> 01:07:32.812
And of course, the show needs to get more and more exciting.

01:07:32.852 --> 01:07:34.472
Of course, there's gonna be more fireworks.

01:07:34.532 --> 01:07:36.453
Of course, there will be new characters.

01:07:36.533 --> 01:07:38.193
Of course, there will be new plot twists.

01:07:39.699 --> 01:07:41.480
But the biology is never going to change.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:47.063
The truth of 2020 and 2021 is never going to change.

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:48.324
It can only disappear.

01:07:49.344 --> 01:07:50.445
It can only be altered.

01:07:52.566 --> 01:07:53.747
It can only be burnt down.

01:07:55.548 --> 01:07:58.850
And so while it's available, we need to disseminate it.

01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:04.893
We need it to become common knowledge that these people collaborated with global powers

01:08:06.613 --> 01:08:18.441
in a governance scheme that has been going on, a covert lie mythology governance scheme that has been used against us for decades now, was used against our parents already.

01:08:18.882 --> 01:08:25.046
The primary case does not result in a huge number of secondary cases in the household the way it does with measles.

01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:28.128
We know it's spread through aerosols.

01:08:28.508 --> 01:08:35.694
And in fact, in winter, in indoor environments, after an hour, you will have had an effective dose of influenza.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.431
if you're in a public indoor environment.

01:08:38.471 --> 01:08:44.595
So it's not about the environment, it's about the susceptibility of the person who's in that environment.

01:08:45.456 --> 01:08:53.821
And what we've also seen for hundreds of years is that people who are out at sea with no contact with anyone else can have outbreaks of influenza.

01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:56.142
So what's the evidence for COVID?

01:08:57.062 --> 01:09:02.625
Well, we have seen these surges, which cannot be entirely accounted for by behavioral change.

01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:09.608
With the measles model, when you reduce restrictions, there should be a rebound in infections.

01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:17.432
And in the summer in the UK, we didn't see that with the V celebrations, the packed beaches, the marches, there was no rebound.

01:09:18.093 --> 01:09:19.714
And more recently in the USA, sorry,

01:09:21.874 --> 01:09:31.244
More recently in the USA, we had Biden calling the governors of Texas and Mississippi's Neanderthals when they released all their restrictions.

01:09:31.484 --> 01:09:33.426
And there was no negative consequence.

01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:34.727
And the trajectory continued.

01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:41.114
Now, you have to see that this this use of data from around the world is part of the illusion.

01:09:42.885 --> 01:09:44.927
I don't believe that that's necessary.

01:09:44.967 --> 01:09:56.757
I don't believe in a non-theater, grassroots, normal sort of way that anybody in the UK would be worried about what's happening in America, never mind saying what Biden recently said.

01:09:57.678 --> 01:09:58.539
That's ridiculous.

01:09:59.674 --> 01:10:12.709
And if this was a real biological phenomenon, or this was real opposition to the murder and lying about it in the UK, she would be focused on the murder in the UK.

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.111
But it's not about that.

01:10:16.181 --> 01:10:27.392
She hasn't questioned why people have died or how they died in the UK at all at this time, even though we know already from many reports that they were killing people in the UK.

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:31.677
People were dying of cold and thirst and starving.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:46.970
Are we to believe that Claire Craig is unaware of that and that she's really just decided to read up on PCR and on epidemiology and on the history of measles and flu?

01:10:48.071 --> 01:11:00.441
The clinical pathologist that was working on cancer in the 100,000 Genomes Project in the UK is now an expert on infectious disease, epidemiology, and COVID.

01:11:00.481 --> 01:11:01.942
She didn't say that, but I'm saying it.

01:11:04.818 --> 01:11:08.842
as it did for all the states that had strict restrictions throughout.

01:11:11.064 --> 01:11:17.529
COVID has low household transmission, like influenza, only about 8 to 15% of contacts end up catching it.

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:28.759
Like influenza, we had an Argentinian fishing vessel where everybody tested negative before they set sail, and 35 days later, there was an outbreak of COVID.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.543
Like influenza, COVID spreads through aerosols.

01:11:33.983 --> 01:11:42.490
We've seen quarantine hotels where patients have caught the same genetic virus as somebody elsewhere in the hotel that they have never met.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.192
We've seen it filling the air filtration systems of hospitals.

01:11:46.933 --> 01:11:59.322
And not with SARS-CoV-2, but with other coronaviruses, people have taken air and managed to grow virus in cell culture 10 miles away from where they were infected farm animals.

01:12:00.854 --> 01:12:03.255
Now, Canada have been quite open with their data.

01:12:03.635 --> 01:12:12.458
They've shared data on test and tracing, which shows that they only found a source of infection in half of their patients.

01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:19.241
And that was true during their winter peak, but it was actually also true recently when case numbers have not been very high.

01:12:19.701 --> 01:12:21.662
And it's been true despite lockdowns.

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:25.778
So lockdowns do reduce human contact.

01:12:26.738 --> 01:12:32.202
And what you can see in this top graph is data from emergency attendances.

01:12:32.282 --> 01:12:35.584
And the top graph is for gastroenteritis.

01:12:35.604 --> 01:12:37.826
So we have the beginning of 2020 up until now.

01:12:39.907 --> 01:12:43.088
And the blue line shows the Google mobility data.

01:12:43.408 --> 01:12:50.750
So as people locked down and as mobility increased, the correlation with gastroenteritis cases is really, really tight.

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:58.133
Now, you wouldn't expect that to be an epidemic-type spread, but you can see that it did have an impact on that disease up until recently.

01:12:59.813 --> 01:13:07.399
COVID's in the bottom graph, and you see that as we increased mobility in the summer, there was no rebound.

01:13:07.799 --> 01:13:10.661
We didn't have much change in mobility and then saw a rebound.

01:13:11.062 --> 01:13:13.403
So we don't have the relationship in the same way.

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.387
Why are we told that behaviour is what's driving spread?

01:13:18.407 --> 01:13:21.790
The evidence does not support that, and this measles model has failed.

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.217
Now, is there anything else we could learn from influenza?

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:27.223
Well, I think there might be.

01:13:27.243 --> 01:13:29.028
I think we need to look back to 1957.

01:13:30.959 --> 01:13:59.851
So I think important to realize here is that in no way, shape, or form does this limited spectrum of debate contain the possibility that a national security state or some global set of interests would lie about pandemic potential and lie about the spread of a coronavirus, despite all of the lack of correlation that would otherwise be congruent with all the other biological phenomenon that she purports we understand at a higher fidelity.

01:14:00.768 --> 01:14:09.473
In other words, we're supposedly we understand measles and we well she says we don't understand flu, but we can use it as a model somehow because she keeps referring to it.

01:14:11.753 --> 01:14:20.175
When the COVID data does not have a viable biological model behind it, she doesn't care.

01:14:20.895 --> 01:14:21.875
That's not a problem.

01:14:21.915 --> 01:14:24.376
That just means that we don't understand it yet.

01:14:24.856 --> 01:14:26.776
There's definitely a novel virus.

01:14:26.836 --> 01:14:28.997
It's definitely killing millions of people.

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:31.477
It could definitely be here forever.

01:14:31.557 --> 01:14:37.819
These are all absolute certainties in this presentation in 2021.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.301
And I guarantee you, she's as certain as she was then, now.

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:54.124
There was a novel flu virus, and there was huge concern because it was believed that everybody was going to be susceptible.

01:14:55.305 --> 01:14:58.085
And then they had a bad winter that year.

01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:02.487
At the end of it, they tested people to see who had had an infection.

01:15:03.067 --> 01:15:05.888
And 8% of the population had antibodies.

01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:08.451
it then went away for the summer.

01:15:09.331 --> 01:15:21.577
And then it came back as a variant the following winter, and another 7% developed antibodies, and so on, not every single year, there are some years it missed out, but it was 11 seasons before it was done.

01:15:23.035 --> 01:15:29.099
So was it a coincidence that in May 2020, 7% of us had antibodies to COVID?

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.142
Or is that actually exactly what we should have expected based on influenza?

01:15:34.143 --> 01:15:40.647
Now, some people who avoided that first pass and weren't susceptible then seem to have become susceptible later.

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:44.610
And it seems to me that you could put a hypothesis

01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:51.955
Now remember, she just told us that influenza does things that aren't explainable by person to person spread.

01:15:52.015 --> 01:15:57.018
Influenza does things that don't have a working model that has been validated yet.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:01.881
She told us that five minutes ago, but now she's saying that COVID is the same.

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:06.784
Holy shit, I don't understand.

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:11.507
How is it possible that these people have gotten away with this for so long?

01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:19.918
Now, some people who avoided that first pass and weren't susceptible then seem to have become susceptible later.

01:16:19.938 --> 01:16:27.079
And it seems to me that you could put a hypothesis that this susceptibility will stretch over years.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:36.662
And it's quite unreasonable to take a decade's worth of susceptibility and assume it's all going to come at once, but that is what was done.

01:16:39.966 --> 01:16:47.074
Now I think we're all familiar with this assertion from the government that one in three of us had no symptoms but were passing it on.

01:16:47.555 --> 01:16:49.657
And there really is no evidence to support that.

01:16:50.478 --> 01:16:54.222
Healthy people can and have tested positive.

01:16:54.563 --> 01:16:56.585
They could have been immune, it could have been a testing error.

01:16:57.806 --> 01:17:03.290
And evidence of positivity is not evidence of spreading a disease.

01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:11.015
So these studies that have been done, which show a percentage of people have no symptoms, have shown really different figures.

01:17:11.295 --> 01:17:14.837
Some studies showed 4% had no symptoms, and it's gone right up to 76%.

01:17:15.838 --> 01:17:18.460
Now, a range that big makes no sense.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:25.885
It does make perfect sense because there were many, many products that were used as equivalent diagnostics.

01:17:26.505 --> 01:17:36.387
There were many different places where these diagnostics were produced, many different manufacturing techniques, many different bases for the detection method.

01:17:37.727 --> 01:17:49.090
And so it's absolutely ridiculous that one of the certainties that underlies this fake presentation is that all testing is basically equivalent because, you know, PCR is PCR is PCR.

01:17:51.604 --> 01:17:58.848
And once you see it for what it is, you can see that in 2020, there is no way she's helping anyone here.

01:17:58.988 --> 01:18:02.350
And there's no way she's the expert she claims to be.

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:07.913
Someone told her to say this stuff because if she knew what she was talking about, she wouldn't say this stuff.

01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:21.229
She would have said that PCR could easily be used to create a vast amount of pulse positives, that there are 200 plus ways that we're trying to do this right now that have been given EUA approval in America.

01:18:21.269 --> 01:18:32.840
And so these numbers are very hard to interpret, but instead she talks in very simple terms about all tests being kind of the same, you know, vulnerable to falseness and for whatever and whatever.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.041
It is disgusting.

01:18:35.418 --> 01:18:39.060
During a symptom, like a cough, you'd expect a constant percentage.

01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:44.984
What you're actually seeing there is not a function of the disease, it's a function of the testing.

01:18:45.244 --> 01:18:49.287
The more tests you do, the more asymptomatic positives you find.

01:18:50.953 --> 01:18:53.014
So where's the evidence of asymptomatic spread?

01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:56.234
Well, what people tend to reference are modeling studies.

01:18:56.314 --> 01:19:01.436
Now, what these modeling studies do is they make an assumption that asymptomatic spread occurs.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:11.098
They then do lots of complicated mathematics and make beautiful graphs which show the effect that that would have on an epidemic, and they conclude that it's really important.

01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:15.919
But the whole thing is a fairy tale based on that initial assumption that it occurs.

01:19:16.579 --> 01:19:19.180
Where's the real-world evidence that it occurs?

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.601
So there are reports in the literature of it having occurred.

01:19:24.082 --> 01:19:29.384
Now, a lot of these reports are of people who have tested positive with no symptom.

01:19:29.404 --> 01:19:36.187
The assumption that it occurs, it can make beautiful graphs, is they make an assumption that asymptomatic spread occurs.

01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:38.928
They then do lots of complicated mathematics.

01:19:38.948 --> 01:19:45.891
But don't forget that James Lyons Weiler told us in 2019 that asymptomatic spread of all vaccinated

01:19:46.843 --> 01:19:47.964
diseases occurs.

01:19:48.504 --> 01:20:00.992
And it's one of the reasons why we need to canvas the population to find and identify those genotypes which are vulnerable to certain components of vaccines so that we can make the vaccine schedule a safer thing for everybody.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:16.530
and make beautiful graphs which show the effect that that would have on an epidemic, and they conclude that it's really important.

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:21.371
But the whole thing is a fairy tale based on that initial assumption that it occurs.

01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:24.692
Where's the real world evidence that it occurs?

01:20:25.552 --> 01:20:33.714
And so she is unable to, and will not, because she is defining a limited spectrum of debate where there are novel viruses.

01:20:33.794 --> 01:20:35.194
They do spread around.

01:20:37.275 --> 01:20:38.655
They do kill lots of people.

01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:41.056
you do need treatment for them.

01:20:42.957 --> 01:20:45.820
But we don't really know how they work, or we kind of do.

01:20:46.561 --> 01:20:50.084
Well, when I say flu, I mean, we don't really know, but it's kind of like flu.

01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:53.868
And so maybe measles and flu can help us understand this.

01:20:57.891 --> 01:20:58.332
It's wrong.

01:20:59.281 --> 01:21:02.364
So there are reports in the literature of it having occurred.

01:21:02.844 --> 01:21:13.394
Now, a lot of these reports are of people who have tested positive with no symptoms having been in contact with someone else who tested positive with no symptoms.

01:21:13.975 --> 01:21:16.857
And that is being described as the transmission of a disease.

01:21:18.459 --> 01:21:20.762
There are a couple of situations where people had symptoms.

01:21:20.782 --> 01:21:22.544
There was a mum with a runny nose for a day.

01:21:22.584 --> 01:21:23.826
There was a baby with a cough.

01:21:24.587 --> 01:21:36.703
But there were no cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome or pneumonia or somebody needing medical care because they caught it from somebody who had no symptoms.

01:21:40.216 --> 01:21:41.457
Let's just talk briefly about.

01:21:41.577 --> 01:21:41.797
Okay.

01:21:41.837 --> 01:21:52.523
As somebody who never has any notes and never had any notes, any, any lecture I've ever given any presentation I've ever given, I've never had notes.

01:21:53.483 --> 01:22:01.267
Um, I actually had more notes on my bike rides on YouTube than I have ever done on a stream or something like this.

01:22:01.387 --> 01:22:06.350
And this woman is giving a presentation with note cards for like a high schooler.

01:22:10.282 --> 01:22:10.963
Note cards.

01:22:12.804 --> 01:22:14.825
She needs to be told to get back in the light.

01:22:18.407 --> 01:22:19.788
Traitors, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:19.848 --> 01:22:21.129
Traitors to our children.

01:22:21.249 --> 01:22:22.130
Hospital transmission.

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:27.553
This graph shows patients in English hospitals across the winter.

01:22:27.893 --> 01:22:29.614
In red, you see patients with COVID.

01:22:29.935 --> 01:22:31.115
In black, no COVID.

01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:32.976
And in green, here are the empty beds.

01:22:33.917 --> 01:22:35.658
Now, the empty beds were pretty constant.

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:41.360
So were these non-COVID patients kindly clearing the way to make room for the COVID patients?

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:41.920
Well, no.

01:22:42.741 --> 01:22:50.944
And SAGE have included in their report an estimate that in spring 2020, there could have been 40% transmission through hospitals.

01:22:51.264 --> 01:22:53.785
And this is what we saw with SARS-1 and with MERS.

01:22:55.166 --> 01:23:00.568
So focusing on the community, on pubs and on schools, is detracting from this, and this is really important.

01:23:00.668 --> 01:23:01.829
We could do something about this.

01:23:03.177 --> 01:23:09.700
NHS has been below capacity throughout, but ITU capacity was exceeded in spring and in winter.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.362
And it does seem that COVID... Now we're talking about capacity in hospitals?

01:23:15.322 --> 01:23:21.545
Again, nowhere near questioning the actual premise of this biology.

01:23:21.665 --> 01:23:22.546
Nowhere near.

01:23:23.486 --> 01:23:27.988
In fact, we're a few months away from her probably saying this was a lab leak, right?

01:23:30.441 --> 01:23:32.542
produces higher morbidity.

01:23:32.562 --> 01:23:37.004
So people are more sick with COVID than they are with respiratory viruses from previous winters.

01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:44.166
But it's worth bearing in mind that the UK has less than half the IT capacity per head of the USA and Germany.

01:23:44.907 --> 01:23:46.127
So we could be acting on this.

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:48.308
We could be increasing our IT capacity.

01:23:48.728 --> 01:23:51.549
We could be sort of- Intensive care, I think, is IT, right?

01:23:51.589 --> 01:23:52.489
This is terrible.

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.652
We're talking about making more possibility to get people on pure oxygen.

01:23:59.414 --> 01:24:02.696
We're talking about getting more possibility of killing people.

01:24:03.317 --> 01:24:14.905
You know, this inconveniently large generation of old people that's going to be a common and unquestionable burden on the governments and societies that they are members of.

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:21.189
And they knew this was coming for two decades or more already, ladies and gentlemen, and they knew what they were going to use it for.

01:24:21.309 --> 01:24:25.172
Putting out air filtering in hospitals, putting UVC into the filtering systems.

01:24:28.959 --> 01:24:35.081
So overall, we do not fully understand transmission of respiratory viruses and we need some humility about that.

01:24:35.121 --> 01:24:35.822
Stop lying!

01:24:35.982 --> 01:24:50.228
Policy's been based on assumptions around transmission that the evidence does not support and we could be acting now to improve ventilation and ITU capacity and stop pretending that lockdowns can affect a virus that is spread through the air.

01:24:50.748 --> 01:24:51.068
Stop!

01:24:51.668 --> 01:24:54.010
Wow!

01:24:54.230 --> 01:25:12.483
And so the second half of that talk is over diagnosis where she explains to you that testing in a clinical setting is a trade-off just like a food is at a restaurant where you can have fast and tasty but then it's expensive or you can have fast and cheap but then it's not very good or you can have

01:25:13.944 --> 01:25:29.339
cheap and tasty and then I guess it's also very slow and not fast or something like that and it is absurd it is absolutely absurd that these people are still the only people that anybody that has any skepticism at all runs into

01:25:30.345 --> 01:25:44.317
If anybody from the mainstream is deciding to look into something, they're gonna run into Del Bigtree, and they're gonna run into Bobby Kennedy, and they're gonna run into Mary Holland, and Meryl Nass, and Robert Malone, and Pierre Cory, and all of these people.

01:25:44.377 --> 01:25:49.761
They're the only ones that you're gonna find if you go off of the mainstream narrative, which is what?

01:25:51.663 --> 01:25:52.243
Which is what?

01:25:53.384 --> 01:25:54.265
Harris or Trump?

01:25:56.021 --> 01:25:58.044
Harris, Trump, and J.D.

01:25:58.084 --> 01:26:01.950
Vance, and Harrison, and Oprah last night?

01:26:05.526 --> 01:26:14.535
That's why it's important to understand that Robert Malone is a red thread that you can pull and pull and pull and pull until this whole thing unravels.

01:26:15.376 --> 01:26:23.024
It's the only way to explain why he's going to Japan this month with Meryl Nass and all these other people who are in front of the Senate.

01:26:23.124 --> 01:26:27.809
Even some of the people from Romania and Canada are now there with him in Japan.

01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:37.456
Because this is a traveling show that is continuously reinforcing this limited spectrum of debate around the world for the few people who think they're awake.

01:26:40.318 --> 01:26:47.263
For the few people who still believe that some combination of a unity party will save America.

01:26:49.085 --> 01:26:50.826
Nobody's riding in on a white horse.

01:26:51.974 --> 01:27:01.985
They are gonna take our guns, they're gonna test vaccines and tell us they're safe, and they're gonna take away our sovereignty and put us on a digital ID to save our kids from predators on the internet.

01:27:02.045 --> 01:27:04.148
That's what's coming, and they all know it.

01:27:05.307 --> 01:27:15.237
And it's part of this use of this increase in all-cause mortality that was expected and is continued to be expected to happen into the future.

01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:19.200
And they are just using it to orchestrate the changes that they want to make.

01:27:29.065 --> 01:27:31.407
All right, Kevin Esvelt, who the hell is that?

01:27:31.627 --> 01:27:48.261
I want to watch a video with you as a study hall today to kind of restart this thing and to refocus us on the hard questions that nobody's asking and to move forward in directions that we need to move forward and with ideas that we need to teach our kids.

01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:50.203
So who the hell is Kevin Esvelt?

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.645
Let's watch a movie together and see if we can figure that out.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:57.229
This is a, this is a, why aren't you showing up?

01:27:58.993 --> 01:28:02.375
This is a TED Talk, so get ready.

01:28:15.781 --> 01:28:17.182
It's from before the pandemic.

01:28:19.743 --> 01:28:20.324
Earthrise.

01:28:21.564 --> 01:28:28.608
I love this photo because it shows that we are all fellow passengers on a tiny world ship journeying through the void.

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:33.229
Our vessel is beautiful, but we are a heavy burden.

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:38.512
As you all know, we use many more resources than it can sustainably provide.

01:28:40.554 --> 01:28:45.737
In other words, our beautiful little world ship is damaged and slowly sinking.

01:28:46.877 --> 01:28:49.059
Our best hope of repair is with science.

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:53.781
We must continually invent new ways of fixing our problems.

01:28:54.822 --> 01:28:55.803
We can do this.

01:28:56.523 --> 01:28:57.904
We will have the technology.

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:02.575
We may also have technology that will inevitably sink it.

01:29:04.195 --> 01:29:09.017
The fate of our voyage will be determined by how well we can answer a single question.

01:29:10.057 --> 01:29:12.838
Which technologies should we develop?

01:29:15.078 --> 01:29:20.200
In the last three minutes, a thousand people were infected with malaria.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.921
Two of those, both children, will die.

01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:29.544
If you could invent a technology that would eradicate malaria forever, would you do it?

01:29:31.585 --> 01:29:34.046
Come on, it's okay to show compassion in public.

01:29:35.687 --> 01:29:37.689
Everyone who would eradicate malaria, raise your hand.

01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:40.050
That's more like it.

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:42.532
How about a local problem?

01:29:42.672 --> 01:29:45.053
How many of you here have been bitten by a tick?

01:29:45.433 --> 01:29:45.894
Raise your hand.

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:47.775
That's a lot.

01:29:49.090 --> 01:30:01.237
Well, here in New England, the iconic image of American childhood, that of kids running freely through the woods, is increasingly threatened by the prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens.

01:30:02.558 --> 01:30:08.161
If you could invent a technology to prevent tick-borne disease and let the kids run free again, would you do it?

01:30:08.341 --> 01:30:08.801
Raise your hands.

01:30:10.762 --> 01:30:13.604
Yeah, tick-borne diseases come from where again, Mr. Speaker?

01:30:18.817 --> 01:30:21.278
But of course, it's easy to say yes to the benefits.

01:30:22.259 --> 01:30:27.402
One of the things you should know about Kevin Esvelt is he is a member of the MIT Media Lab.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:28.623
You ever heard of that before?

01:30:28.643 --> 01:30:34.647
The question is, what are the risks?

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.148
How would we go about doing these things?

01:30:38.429 --> 01:30:40.090
Well, both of these are biological problems.

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.532
So the answer must involve CRISPR.

01:30:47.324 --> 01:30:57.767
Now, CRISPR is a molecular scalpel that can be programmed to precisely cut and therefore edit just about any DNA sequence in any organism.

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:04.629
And it's so easy that you can do it in your kitchen, at least in microbes, using a mail-order kit.

01:31:07.216 --> 01:31:07.936
Now don't worry about it.

01:31:08.156 --> 01:31:18.158
Does that sound a little bit like Robert Malone's pitch for how nowadays, you know, you can mail order from eBay all the equipment you need to make a gain-of-function virus in your garage?

01:31:18.918 --> 01:31:25.180
He said that to the UK Parliament in a public meeting in 2023.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.901
In fact, you can drink everything in that kit and be perfectly fine.

01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:30.741
It's totally safe.

01:31:31.401 --> 01:31:31.761
In fact,

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:40.341
Each of us has billions of copies of CRISPR within us already, because it's used as a defense system by the microbes that live within us.

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.644
We've simply adapted it for genome editing.

01:31:44.344 --> 01:31:45.045
Here's how it works.

01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:53.612
Introduce into the cell the DNA that you want to insert, as well as the CRISPR system and instructions telling it where to cut.

01:31:55.013 --> 01:32:01.879
CRISPR will cut the original sequence, and to repair the damage, the cell will insert your new DNA sequence.

01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:04.030
It's that easy.

01:32:06.451 --> 01:32:12.354
If biology is written in the language of DNA, and it is, CRISPR is our pencil.

01:32:14.275 --> 01:32:20.178
And now that we have it, we should be teaching kids to use CRISPR to edit genomes in middle school biology class, right?

01:32:22.179 --> 01:32:25.540
I mean, we encourage kids to learn how to program and to tinker in their garages.

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.241
Why not extend that to living systems?

01:32:28.922 --> 01:32:31.003
I'm seeing a handful of dubious looks out there.

01:32:32.912 --> 01:32:37.255
Perhaps you're concerned that we might inadvertently damage the ecosystems that we all rely on.

01:32:38.295 --> 01:32:40.417
Those are really the life support systems of our world, Chip.

01:32:41.057 --> 01:32:44.359
I think we can all agree you should be careful when you're tinkering with life support.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:55.066
But keep in mind that when we alter an organism, we're tinkering with something that has evolved to optimize reproduction in its natural habitat.

01:32:55.607 --> 01:33:00.250
And while our changes might be good for us, they're generally not good for the organism.

01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:03.671
So natural selection eliminates them.

01:33:05.392 --> 01:33:11.095
To give an example, we spent many years reshaping the wolf into many different breeds of dogs.

01:33:11.675 --> 01:33:16.939
But are any of you worried that your pet is going to escape and out-compete the wolves in Yellowstone?

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:19.960
Of course not.

01:33:21.121 --> 01:33:27.365
Out there, dogs fail against wolves, and engineered traits fail in the wild.

01:33:29.315 --> 01:33:31.557
But what if we could change that?

01:33:33.258 --> 01:33:39.523
Suppose that you could invent a technology that would let anyone who can alter a large organism using CRISPR.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:46.309
I'm not really sure how to approach that, but I'm not sure that that generalization that he just made is real and right.

01:33:48.951 --> 01:33:52.453
I can think of several scenarios where maybe

01:33:53.593 --> 01:33:58.715
the, a wild dog introduced could change a population or whatever.

01:33:58.815 --> 01:34:07.778
I mean, I, I think what he just said there was kind of a bit of a magic spell, but I'm, I, I'm, I'm not really seeing any equivalence there.

01:34:07.798 --> 01:34:11.139
I mean, one of the people in the chat just said it like, it's not the same.

01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:13.800
Dog breeding is not the same as using CRISPR.

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.221
And, and it would, if

01:34:18.482 --> 01:34:30.833
a wild dog got out into the wild and then bred with wolves, you would have introduction of those genes in some way or another into that wild population and potentially in future.

01:34:31.073 --> 01:34:32.454
That's, that's not impossible.

01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:33.015
That's real.

01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:43.224
You're not worried about it because again, the odds of a dog going out there and integrating with a wild wolf population is not very high.

01:34:44.957 --> 01:34:56.522
But he's talking about it in a very disingenuous way for an audience, I think, who's probably not quite sophisticated enough to hear it for the bullshit equivalents that he's using it as.

01:34:58.002 --> 01:34:59.603
That is a living thing that you can see.

01:35:01.043 --> 01:35:06.265
To cause that change to spread over generations through the wild population.

01:35:07.866 --> 01:35:13.048
So anyone who could make a yellow fruit fly in the laboratory could release it and eventually

01:35:13.769 --> 01:35:15.550
turn all the fruit flies yellow.

01:35:17.331 --> 01:35:18.831
What would that do to the ecosystem?

01:35:21.372 --> 01:35:22.293
Almost certainly nothing.

01:35:22.313 --> 01:35:26.535
And that's true of most changes, but certainly not all.

01:35:27.815 --> 01:35:30.036
Suppose you tried to turn them all into males.

01:35:31.437 --> 01:35:37.420
Apart from the obvious downsides, the population would crash and possibly go extinct.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.262
And while initially only very few people would be able to use your technology,

01:35:43.186 --> 01:35:45.947
This is CRISPR, so that would inevitably change.

01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:55.772
So, a technology to alter entire wild populations and engineer ecosystems single-handedly.

01:35:56.673 --> 01:35:57.113
Good idea?

01:35:57.373 --> 01:35:57.833
Bad idea.

01:35:58.053 --> 01:35:59.314
Raise your hand if you would invent this one.

01:36:02.635 --> 01:36:03.676
Not many takers.

01:36:04.636 --> 01:36:05.477
He already did.

01:36:06.057 --> 01:36:07.298
It's called a gene drive.

01:36:08.386 --> 01:36:20.136
And this guy was called in front of the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives, along with Richard Ebright, to testify about the dangers of gain of function coronavirus.

01:36:22.097 --> 01:36:25.380
And that we should have strict regulations on what these people can do.

01:36:27.094 --> 01:36:40.938
all the while knowing that what he does, what he designed, the kinds of molecular tools that he's designed, that any pharmaceutical company could make in giant quantities because that's what they can do.

01:36:41.658 --> 01:36:54.421
The same way they can make biologics like a, I don't know, RNA dependent lipid nanoparticle transfection to be rolled out in millions of doses, they could make gene drives

01:36:55.828 --> 01:37:04.514
using the same recombinant DNA technology and make them as pure and as large a quantity as desired.

01:37:08.277 --> 01:37:12.199
And we're talking about gain-of-function coronaviruses as being scary.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:22.046
We're solving mysteries about who's responsible for gain-of-function coronaviruses being sprayed into bat caves by people like Peter Daszak in the Diffuse proposal.

01:37:25.689 --> 01:37:50.723
And already before the pandemic, someone from MIT who was later in the pandemic a witness about how dangerous gain-of-function viruses is, is explaining to you the ludicrous nature of taking CRISPR and combining it with a series of methodological and molecular tweaks so that it becomes essentially like a super dominant gene.

01:37:51.616 --> 01:38:02.045
that overwrites itself anywhere it is and passes on as into future generations in a almost super dominant way.

01:38:02.365 --> 01:38:09.351
I don't even know if he's gonna explain how bad it is right now, but listen carefully because this is before the pandemic.

01:38:11.152 --> 01:38:16.557
What if I told you it was the same technology that could let us eradicate malaria and prevent tick-borne disease?

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.844
It's a way of using CRISPR to duplicate a natural phenomenon known as gene drive.

01:38:23.905 --> 01:38:29.929
And not only does it already exist, it's been independently reinvented, which means it was probably inevitable.

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:35.374
But scientists are morally responsible for the consequences of our work.

01:38:36.935 --> 01:38:41.619
And that means that someone bears the burden of responsibility for CRISPR-based gene drive.

01:38:41.719 --> 01:38:42.900
And if you must know who, well,

01:38:46.528 --> 01:38:46.789
Funny.

01:38:46.829 --> 01:38:47.069
Why?

01:38:47.449 --> 01:38:50.530
Why do that, given that so many of you have reservations?

01:38:51.291 --> 01:38:53.592
Well, let's put that aside for the moment and look at how it works.

01:38:55.013 --> 01:38:58.514
Introduced into the cell, not just your edited DNA sequence, but also the instruction.

01:38:58.594 --> 01:39:10.240
I would just like to say in a very broad sense that one of the things that we know genetically about dogs and about dog breeds versus some other dog breeds, and this is something very interesting.

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.181
I wonder if Ruby's here.

01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:12.741
Probably not.

01:39:15.572 --> 01:39:22.400
Anyway, some dog breeds are outbred by genetic background and other dog breeds are not.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.802
The best example of outbred dogs are

01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:29.591
the sled dogs in Alaska.

01:39:29.991 --> 01:39:34.614
If you look at their genome, it's like they're mutts.

01:39:35.415 --> 01:39:39.959
If you look at Lienbergers, they also qualify as mutts.

01:39:40.019 --> 01:39:40.939
They are outbred.

01:39:41.019 --> 01:39:44.842
The selection and the arrangement of their genes is not

01:39:46.264 --> 01:40:09.421
the same homogeny that you would find in a breed like Golden Retrievers or a breed like, oh I'm trying to think of a really old breed, but some of these breeds essentially qualify as inbred because their traits have become so selected for they almost have nothing different to pass on to their progeny if they are mated with another one of them.

01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:12.405
And so that's not what happens with Liam burgers.

01:40:12.445 --> 01:40:14.929
That's not what happens with Alaskan sled dogs.

01:40:15.329 --> 01:40:22.440
You get a lot of variety in the offspring because they are by definition, their genome is not inbred.

01:40:24.417 --> 01:40:29.261
They haven't been crossbred, you know, rebred enough for that to occur.

01:40:29.461 --> 01:40:38.147
And the extreme example of this, of course, are the mice that are in a laboratory where they are all essentially genetically equivalent, almost twins.

01:40:38.728 --> 01:40:45.593
If you put those mice out in the wild, they don't stand a chance because they don't have any variation in their genes.

01:40:45.633 --> 01:40:49.976
And so they have no ability to modulate and no ability to

01:40:50.756 --> 01:40:52.277
There's nothing to select against.

01:40:52.637 --> 01:40:57.478
I mean, select for, because you're just left with one alternative.

01:40:57.538 --> 01:41:07.502
And so this idea has been understood for a very long time and only in the broadest sense, but I just wanted to address that in the chat.

01:41:07.522 --> 01:41:08.242
Sorry to interrupt.

01:41:08.302 --> 01:41:09.723
For making and using the pencil.

01:41:10.843 --> 01:41:19.006
So CRISPR will erase the original sequence and write in the new one, plus the instructions for making and using the pencil.

01:41:20.086 --> 01:41:27.849
Once one copy goes in, it will produce the pencil and use it to erase the other copy of the original version and write in the new one.

01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:29.510
So now the organism has two copies.

01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:35.832
So this is a lot like a self-replicating RNA, but now on the DNA form.

01:41:36.392 --> 01:41:37.873
And so this is CRISPR.

01:41:37.993 --> 01:41:43.315
Once you put it in, then it looks for itself and it makes itself and it goes, yikes.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.502
So this is not, this is not natural biology.

01:41:49.542 --> 01:41:51.022
This is just a bad idea.

01:41:51.283 --> 01:41:53.944
And it only really happens if you do it.

01:41:55.124 --> 01:41:57.605
It can only be done with intention.

01:41:58.386 --> 01:42:12.792
And the crazy part is, is that we have the technology to make it at high levels of purity and in giant quantities, thanks to very standard recombinant molecular biological techniques that are descended from the original human genome project.

01:42:16.786 --> 01:42:17.806
And here's where the magic happens.

01:42:18.646 --> 01:42:27.249
When that organism mates with a wild counterpart, all of the offspring are guaranteed to inherit the new version, the gene drive construct.

01:42:27.829 --> 01:42:37.871
And in those offspring, editing happens again, which means that all of those organisms' offspring are guaranteed to inherit the new version.

01:42:38.812 --> 01:42:42.032
And in those organisms, erase, rewrite.

01:42:42.833 --> 01:42:43.473
Holy shit.

01:42:43.493 --> 01:42:44.473
Erase, rewrite.

01:42:45.655 --> 01:42:52.219
on and on through the generations until, if you've done it right, you've altered every version in the local population.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.722
And very possibly, every- Were they putting it in the jabs?

01:42:56.983 --> 01:43:03.847
I don't know, but could they once the entire population has accepted mRNA transfection as the way?

01:43:04.768 --> 01:43:05.688
Absolutely.

01:43:06.929 --> 01:43:07.930
Without a doubt.

01:43:14.534 --> 01:43:15.375
I don't know if they would.

01:43:17.335 --> 01:43:34.165
But they most certainly could, once you give up your sovereignty and accept the fact that transfection is personalized or precision medicine, as James Lyons Weiler described it in 2019, as Robert Malone has described it for years, as Fauci has described it for years, and Collins has described it for years.

01:43:34.745 --> 01:43:37.547
The Human Genome Project, the goal is that.

01:43:38.588 --> 01:43:40.429
Come on, ladies and gentlemen, wake up!

01:43:43.132 --> 01:43:52.418
The biology is available, the real biology is available, and the shiny objects like virology and pandemics, they wanted us to argue about that stuff.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:05.007
That's why no virus was a thing for five years, and none of those no virus people have ever done anything about gene drives in five years.

01:44:06.385 --> 01:44:10.987
I was telling you about Kevin Esvelt and Gene Drives in 2021, ladies and gentlemen.

01:44:11.827 --> 01:44:12.528
Come on.

01:44:12.928 --> 01:44:15.729
Repopulation of that species in the world.

01:44:19.831 --> 01:44:21.212
What might we do with this?

01:44:24.173 --> 01:44:28.315
We could start with the deadliest animal in the world, the mosquito.

01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:37.776
But that's unfair to the mosquitoes, because there are 3,500 species, and just six are responsible for nearly all mosquito-borne disease.

01:44:39.257 --> 01:44:43.480
Six species that could be altered or suppressed to block transmission.

01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:57.030
Imagine a world without malaria, without dengue, or yellow fever, or chikungunya, or Zika, and with no risk of the next mosquito-borne virus to emerge from the jungle.

01:44:59.110 --> 01:45:07.015
We could use gene drive to immunize the mice that infect ticks with the pathogens that cause Lyme and other diseases.

01:45:08.055 --> 01:45:10.617
No infected ticks, no infected kids.

01:45:13.238 --> 01:45:15.840
And that's just a couple of applications in human health.

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:16.940
What about the environment?

01:45:17.701 --> 01:45:28.307
Right now, if we have a problem with a species, say, an insect pest eating our crops, we spray insecticides to kill it, and in the process, kill many others.

01:45:30.211 --> 01:45:37.336
Imagine if we could program that pest to be uniquely susceptible, the only one affected.

01:45:38.197 --> 01:45:44.982
Or better yet, if we could tweak it so that it simply didn't like the taste of our crop and could otherwise go about its ecological role.

01:45:46.863 --> 01:45:51.326
We could save endangered species by controlling or removing populations of invasive ones.

01:45:52.047 --> 01:45:54.449
200 years ago, there were no mosquitoes in Hawaii.

01:45:55.387 --> 01:45:57.088
and there were lots of beautiful native birds.

01:45:57.929 --> 01:46:09.258
We introduced mosquitoes to Hawaii, and eventually, with them came bird malaria, which proceeded to wipe out a lot of the birds.

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:17.004
Of the ones left, we're going to lose most of them in the next few decades, unless we remove those mosquitoes from Hawaii.

01:46:18.945 --> 01:46:21.188
Overall, gene drive is a way.

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:25.673
It's hard for me to imagine that the birds in Hawaii are dying because of mosquito.

01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:28.957
Couldn't be loss of habitat.

01:46:29.017 --> 01:46:30.358
No, that's not possible.

01:46:30.378 --> 01:46:35.284
To solve ecological problems using biology, not bulldozers.

01:46:38.808 --> 01:46:39.749
What if something goes wrong?

01:46:41.673 --> 01:46:47.099
Might seem a bit much to suggest that the same technology that caused a problem could also be used to fix it.

01:46:47.159 --> 01:46:48.821
But in this case, a pencil is a pencil.

01:46:49.642 --> 01:46:57.451
Erase the sequence that causes the damage and write in a corrected version or the original version.

01:46:58.547 --> 01:46:59.929
That's not to say that this will always work.

01:47:00.529 --> 01:47:01.691
Oh, so we could do it.

01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:04.874
And if it doesn't work, we can just put the original one back in.

01:47:05.595 --> 01:47:06.997
Stop lying.

01:47:07.357 --> 01:47:09.559
Holy cow.

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.400
Is that dumb?

01:47:10.781 --> 01:47:14.345
Certainly not to say that there aren't any ecological risks.

01:47:14.905 --> 01:47:17.609
Of course there are, but if,

01:47:18.462 --> 01:47:24.846
We are careful and cautious and humble because we are just learning how these systems work.

01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:30.189
We can usually find out what might go wrong and make an informed decision.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:40.986
For example, before we consider using a drive system to alter a wild population, we should release lots of organisms that have the alteration, but not the drive system.

01:47:41.386 --> 01:47:46.609
Is that what Bill Gates is doing with the genetically altered mosquitoes right now?

01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:52.933
Are we on stage one where we're releasing genetically altered mosquitoes to see if it screws anything up?

01:47:52.973 --> 01:47:56.455
And if it doesn't, maybe we can just do it with a gene drive next time.

01:48:01.206 --> 01:48:05.371
This is very, very bad, ladies and gentlemen, because this is before the pandemic.

01:48:05.411 --> 01:48:08.235
He's telling you that maybe we should just release some first.

01:48:09.376 --> 01:48:10.718
They're doing it right now.

01:48:14.342 --> 01:48:15.383
And if you can't see,

01:48:16.701 --> 01:48:20.365
with just this little backing up, how big this is.

01:48:20.986 --> 01:48:34.882
With just a little bit of backing up and you still can't see the top of it, you've got to realize that starting from the Human Genome Project, we have a massive illusion being created about the fidelity of our understanding of our own biology and our command of it.

01:48:37.008 --> 01:48:52.094
because the only way to roll these technologies out en masse and figure out how they could possibly work is to turn humans into experimental animals because you can't figure these questions out in mice and in cell cultures.

01:48:53.075 --> 01:48:58.257
Into the local environment where it won't spread and see what happens.

01:49:00.618 --> 01:49:03.459
Based on that knowledge, we can then decide whether it's worth proceeding.

01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:05.700
Of course,

01:49:07.185 --> 01:49:10.627
that requires us to be careful and cautious and humble.

01:49:12.327 --> 01:49:20.591
And right now, there is nothing stopping me or any other scientist from building any gene drive system that we want.

01:49:22.452 --> 01:49:26.634
Imagine a well-meaning scientist who wants to solve an ecological problem.

01:49:27.915 --> 01:49:31.958
they want to spur on the ecologists to run those tests, to make sure that it's a good idea.

01:49:32.058 --> 01:49:54.052
Now remember, what we're supposed to believe during the pandemic, according to Charles Rixey and Kevin McCairn and Kevin McKernan and Tony Fauci and Peter Daszak and all these people, is that there is an RNA with a particular set of furin cleavage sites encoded in the protein that it codes for, and that makes this RNA really good at spreading itself around the world.

01:49:55.250 --> 01:50:02.475
and that we should be really concerned about people who would have the audacity of putting fear and cleavage sites into viruses and then spraying them into bat caves.

01:50:03.015 --> 01:50:04.196
What a bunch of shitheads.

01:50:05.857 --> 01:50:19.506
And for four years, people like me and you and everybody else have been arguing about these fake mythologies, these false biological phenomenon, when all the while in the background, these people knew what was going on.

01:50:19.566 --> 01:50:23.088
They know what they're planning, they know what they need to do, and they know what they want to do.

01:50:25.256 --> 01:50:29.558
and they know what the real molecular biology is that you need to be afraid of.

01:50:29.618 --> 01:50:43.182
And that's why they use none other than Kevin Esvelt in front of the United States government and alongside Richard Ebright to say that, yeah, gain-of-function viruses are real and they need real regulation.

01:50:45.583 --> 01:50:47.304
So they build a gene drive system in the laboratory.

01:50:48.264 --> 01:50:50.065
They're confident that it's a good idea.

01:50:52.008 --> 01:50:57.190
we'd certainly find out if any of their gene drive organisms escaped into the wild.

01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:02.191
I'm sorry, Free Rain, but you do understand, right?

01:51:02.271 --> 01:51:11.474
That the bat narrative was seeded all the way back in this man and his future book from 1950, 19 what?

01:51:12.634 --> 01:51:17.316
And the guy who wrote that chapter is Hilary Kaprowski.

01:51:18.174 --> 01:51:21.585
And we wouldn't know shit about Hilary Koprowski if it wasn't for Mark.

01:51:21.625 --> 01:51:22.468
This book was written in 1963.

01:51:24.264 --> 01:51:32.811
Hilary Koprowski who went through the Vatican and then the Rockefeller Institute in Brazil and is responsible for a yellow fever vaccine or some other shit.

01:51:33.211 --> 01:51:35.833
And his wife is a cell culture master.

01:51:36.294 --> 01:51:46.302
That guy wrote a book, a chapter in this book, the introduction and first chapter written by Aldous Huxley or Julian Huxley.

01:51:47.222 --> 01:51:51.626
Hilary Koprowski wrote a chapter about viruses coming from bat caves.

01:51:53.129 --> 01:52:01.775
And exactly the same kind of chapter was written in 2019 by the last postdoc of Ralph Baric and Sina Bavari.

01:52:02.255 --> 01:52:09.941
Alison Totura and Sina Bavari wrote a review about how there would be a coronavirus pandemic and that Remdesivir would work really well for it.

01:52:10.982 --> 01:52:21.289
It's all the same story they've been telling and planning to use in this time when the population pyramid gave them the opportunity to whine about a crisis.

01:52:22.219 --> 01:52:30.984
And they knew already, they've been tweaking this story for 30 years and finding the right people to represent it for 30 years.

01:52:31.024 --> 01:52:33.125
That's why Tony Fauci is still representing it.

01:52:33.165 --> 01:52:46.933
That's why somebody like Robert Malone is representing it to somebody like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's probably been under their bamboozlement since he was 14 years old and became the most dangerous American alive.

01:52:48.814 --> 01:52:52.296
And so yeah, he's been surrounded by liars for a very long time.

01:52:52.796 --> 01:52:57.598
And he's about to bring all of those liars into the Trump administration and we need to stop it.

01:52:58.559 --> 01:53:01.260
Even if Trump's not a good guy, it's possible.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.323
I think it's actually more possible that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:53:06.383 --> 01:53:11.165
could become a bad guy than Donald Trump could become a bad guy.

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.961
Because I think it's possible that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:18.862
could actually realize that these people have been lying to him.

01:53:18.902 --> 01:53:25.905
Even people like Jeffrey Sachs, and Robert Malone, and Meryl Nass, and Mary Holland.

01:53:28.627 --> 01:53:32.948
So that the message of someone simple like Brian Hooker would be lost in that.

01:53:35.370 --> 01:53:38.671
Somebody as humble as Brian Hooker could be crowded out by that.

01:53:41.707 --> 01:53:47.590
James Lyons Wyler also can get in contact with Bobby whenever he wants to, and that guy has got to be a meddler.

01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:53.172
There's no other way to explain his lack of understanding and progress in this biology.

01:53:57.054 --> 01:53:58.675
Only takes one.

01:54:02.596 --> 01:54:03.697
Oops, they might say.

01:54:04.677 --> 01:54:05.418
Terribly sorry.

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:10.340
I didn't mean to unleash a technology that could ultimately impact the lives of billions of people.

01:54:11.752 --> 01:54:16.677
I mean, I know our ancestors fought and died for the right to self-governance, but it was an honest mistake.

01:54:18.699 --> 01:54:19.660
You'd forgive them, I'm sure.

01:54:20.561 --> 01:54:21.762
You're compassionate, remember?

01:54:23.324 --> 01:54:28.569
You wouldn't let a single mistake by a single scientist seriously damage your trust in science.

01:54:29.468 --> 01:54:34.551
And it certainly wouldn't prompt you or anyone else to impose harsh restrictions on what scientists can do, would it?

01:54:35.111 --> 01:54:40.555
Science and one mistake is how this pandemic now everyone has concluded.

01:54:41.155 --> 01:54:45.157
After solving the mystery, how the pandemic started is one mistake.

01:54:46.138 --> 01:54:48.039
Think about this, ladies and gentlemen.

01:54:48.479 --> 01:54:52.101
Because we're trying to fix the sinking world ship here, right?

01:54:54.163 --> 01:54:58.125
And if that's not bad enough... The sinking world ship.

01:54:59.688 --> 01:55:02.170
My children are not inheriting that narrative.

01:55:02.931 --> 01:55:03.551
They are not.

01:55:04.252 --> 01:55:08.855
Even though their teachers believe it, they are not inheriting it because they're growing up in this house.

01:55:08.995 --> 01:55:16.321
Consider, scientists might build a gene drive system using CRISPR without even understanding that that's what they're doing.

01:55:17.742 --> 01:55:20.464
In fact, it's already happened.

01:55:21.825 --> 01:55:26.748
Another group hadn't read our work, any warnings or recommended safeguards,

01:55:27.879 --> 01:55:32.902
and built a CRISPR-based gene drive in the lab to solve a lab-specific problem, nothing to do with wild populations.

01:55:33.762 --> 01:55:41.167
But they were good and careful scientists, so they did what they were supposed to do, they ran it by their biosafety committee, which also didn't see a problem.

01:55:43.088 --> 01:55:55.275
And in fact, they were only two days from publishing their work as a method to be used by other laboratories without mentioning safeguards, even those that they themselves had used.

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.417
That was a near miss.

01:55:59.598 --> 01:56:04.501
But it was an incredibly useful one, because it highlighted the problems with the current system.

01:56:05.521 --> 01:56:14.186
That is, we scientists don't tell other scientists what we're planning to do in the laboratory, let alone the general populace.

01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:23.512
Scientists are typically not so great

01:56:24.491 --> 01:56:26.735
at anticipating the consequences of our work.

01:56:27.676 --> 01:56:37.391
The world is too vast on our own, and regulations will always be playing catch-up.

01:56:38.837 --> 01:56:41.818
I mean, there are teleprompters at TED Talks.

01:56:41.858 --> 01:56:44.860
I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but they're at the floor level.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.740
So he's just reading.

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:47.341
He's reading word for word.

01:56:47.401 --> 01:56:48.582
That's why he's talking like this.

01:56:48.882 --> 01:56:55.045
For example, just yesterday, the National Academy released recommendations for gene drive research.

01:56:55.525 --> 01:56:59.807
Mind you, recommendations, not restrictions, recommendations.

01:57:00.147 --> 01:57:04.389
23 months after we first described how you could use CRISPR to build a gene drive system.

01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:07.331
And then to top it all off,

01:57:08.729 --> 01:57:23.544
There is no universal requirement that any scientist building something like a gene drive system tell people what they're doing, no matter how dramatic and shared the consequences of a mistake.

01:57:25.626 --> 01:57:29.971
Speaking as a scientist and an inventor, this is both wrong

01:57:30.865 --> 01:57:31.846
and dangerous.

01:57:32.647 --> 01:57:33.467
What exactly was that?

01:57:33.487 --> 01:57:33.808
It's wrong.

01:57:34.488 --> 01:57:40.053
Because in medical research, we demand informed consent, recommendations, not restrictions.

01:57:40.173 --> 01:57:42.195
Okay, I want to listen carefully here.

01:57:42.215 --> 01:57:46.459
23 months after we first described how you could use CRISPR to build a gene drive system.

01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:55.627
And then to top it all off, there is no universal requirement that any scientist

01:57:56.550 --> 01:58:05.594
building something like a gene drive system, tell people what they're doing, no matter how dramatic and shared the consequences of a mistake.

01:58:07.675 --> 01:58:13.918
Speaking as a scientist and an inventor, this is both wrong and dangerous.

01:58:15.158 --> 01:58:18.740
So he's begging for regulation and begging for oversight.

01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:19.260
Interesting.

01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:26.183
It's wrong because in medical research, we demand informed consent before experiments can begin.

01:58:27.970 --> 01:58:34.374
And yet, we allow scientists to build gene drive systems capable of single-handedly altering entire ecosystems.

01:58:34.495 --> 01:58:42.440
It's almost like he's seeding a narrative that a gain-of-function virus could be kind of like you being exposed to something without informed consent, huh?

01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:46.903
I know that that's not where we are, but this is a couple years before the pandemic, so it's interesting.

01:58:47.503 --> 01:58:49.625
Without telling people what they're doing.

01:58:51.446 --> 01:58:56.930
It's dangerous because there are technologies out there more perilous than gene drive.

01:58:59.082 --> 01:59:05.206
Robert Oppenheimer said, when you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.

01:59:06.027 --> 01:59:11.210
And you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success.

01:59:12.391 --> 01:59:15.093
That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.

01:59:17.654 --> 01:59:27.581
To me, that sounds a lot like saying that it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission, even when you're building nuclear weapons or dangerous viruses.

01:59:28.522 --> 01:59:29.543
or gene drive systems.

01:59:29.963 --> 01:59:30.504
Yes.

01:59:31.044 --> 01:59:31.705
He said it.

01:59:32.325 --> 01:59:34.287
He said dangerous viruses.

01:59:34.387 --> 01:59:37.009
I, my gosh, I must, I didn't expect it.

01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.669
Wow.

01:59:38.850 --> 01:59:48.298
But it's worse than that because right now the scientific ecosystem actively punishes us for telling people what we are planning to do in the laboratory.

01:59:49.719 --> 01:59:51.501
There is no good reason for that to be the case.

01:59:51.561 --> 01:59:53.422
In fact, there's every reason for just the opposite.

01:59:54.003 --> 01:59:56.805
Closed door science is incredibly inefficient.

01:59:57.915 --> 02:00:00.896
We waste time unknowingly duplicating the efforts of others.

02:00:01.956 --> 02:00:09.699
And it makes it really hard to find the other person who has the missing piece of that puzzle when everyone's doing their work behind closed doors.

02:00:14.901 --> 02:00:22.724
But even though no rational person would design the current scientific enterprise,

02:00:24.608 --> 02:00:32.211
It's the one we have, because we started doing science well before we had the communication technologies that could solve this problem, that could let us communicate what we're doing.

02:00:33.271 --> 02:00:34.692
And science evolved.

02:00:34.812 --> 02:00:40.955
So now he's framing the problem of science as the compartmentalization of it, and that we don't communicate and we're not open enough.

02:00:40.995 --> 02:00:42.895
And so we need open science.

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:47.157
Maybe we should publish using blockchain or something like McKernan as a suggestion.

02:00:48.157 --> 02:00:49.078
This is all,

02:00:49.778 --> 02:01:04.592
hilarious diversion from the horrible use of null hypotheses and p-values to create the illusion of knowledge generation, which is what he really ought to be talking about, but is not because that's not what he's supposed to talk about.

02:01:08.410 --> 02:01:10.071
Traditions are hard to change.

02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:11.771
So it's not secrecy.

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:16.493
Just beware that the reason why science is handicapped is not because of secrecy.

02:01:16.553 --> 02:01:22.315
It's because of the use of null hypotheses and p-values to generate the illusion of knowledge.

02:01:24.356 --> 02:01:27.177
So why did we tell the world about CRISPR-based gene drive?

02:01:28.798 --> 02:01:36.681
Because we wanted to describe capabilities, consequences, and detail available safeguards

02:01:37.566 --> 02:01:51.992
as well as to call for openness and community guidance before we or anyone ran experiments in the laboratory, because we wanted to set an example that technologies like this should always be developed in the light of day.

02:01:54.654 --> 02:01:57.635
We were professionally punished for it, but it was worth it.

02:01:59.284 --> 02:01:59.664
Sadly.

02:01:59.724 --> 02:02:02.826
We were professionally punished for it, but it was worth it.

02:02:02.866 --> 02:02:08.970
He works at MIT Media Labs where everybody becomes a postdoc and then they just kind of disappear.

02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:17.254
Very few people go through MIT Media Labs and then go to another faculty, you know, like become a professor somewhere.

02:02:17.294 --> 02:02:22.838
They all disappear into the system and go work for industry or the military or something like that.

02:02:24.299 --> 02:02:24.979
That's not enough.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.101
It's hard to change the system.

02:02:29.167 --> 02:02:33.429
especially from within, and it still favors secrecy.

02:02:35.590 --> 02:02:40.893
Right now, it's easier to engineer biology than culture.

02:02:43.454 --> 02:02:49.517
But we must change the culture, because people deserve a voice in decisions that will affect them.

02:02:50.737 --> 02:02:55.960
Because there are technologies out there more perilous than gene drive, waiting to be discovered.

02:02:57.179 --> 02:03:02.889
But most of all, because our world ship is slowly sinking.

02:03:03.831 --> 02:03:09.100
And here we are, tinkering with its systems, with the lights off.

02:03:12.264 --> 02:03:14.085
This has to change.

02:03:14.145 --> 02:03:22.471
You can see, right, that this is a limited spectrum of debate that has been carefully crafted by this choice of language and this presentation style.

02:03:22.511 --> 02:03:25.093
And it's really weak and it's annoying for us.

02:03:25.173 --> 02:03:30.056
But see what he's attempting to do and what probably happened in most people's minds that listen to this.

02:03:32.199 --> 02:03:40.324
He's telling you what questions to ask and how to argue about them and what the most plausible moral answers are to those questions.

02:03:40.364 --> 02:03:41.705
And they're not even the right questions.

02:03:41.745 --> 02:03:44.166
He's telling you that there are more dangerous things out there.

02:03:45.307 --> 02:03:46.788
You don't even need to worry about me.

02:03:47.328 --> 02:03:48.149
There's viruses.

02:03:48.489 --> 02:03:48.889
Change.

02:03:49.570 --> 02:03:53.872
And GeneDrive is the key, the lever, the rallying point, the battle flag.

02:03:54.473 --> 02:03:57.335
Because GeneDrive, more than any other technology we have right now,

02:03:58.157 --> 02:03:59.578
demands a new approach.

02:04:00.138 --> 02:04:07.202
And if we can ensure that gene drive research is open and responsive, then that model could spread to the rest of science.

02:04:09.443 --> 02:04:10.163
But hold on a minute.

02:04:10.803 --> 02:04:17.487
You're probably thinking, is democracy really the system we want to govern technology?

02:04:18.847 --> 02:04:27.732
Do you really expect the typical citizen to have the time and inclination to become well-versed in the technical details necessary to offer an informed opinion on this subject?

02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:37.502
Well, as Churchill said, democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.

02:04:40.443 --> 02:04:42.164
And it comes to a question of trust.

02:04:42.944 --> 02:04:49.446
Do you trust me with the power to single-handedly engineer ecosystems?

02:04:50.846 --> 02:04:59.109
Do you trust a scientist who has not spent a lot of time thinking about the consequences, or one that doesn't really understand what they are doing?

02:05:02.284 --> 02:05:03.365
I'll tell you who I trust.

02:05:05.186 --> 02:05:09.389
Local communities coming together to solve problems that affect them.

02:05:10.789 --> 02:05:15.633
You said that you wanted to solve malaria and prevent tick-borne disease.

02:05:16.773 --> 02:05:21.957
Thankfully, we're not affected by malaria, so I don't think we get any say in that.

02:05:23.117 --> 02:05:25.719
But Lyme disease is right here in our backyards.

02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:31.503
Many of you may have grown up in this area, running carefree through the woods,

02:05:32.944 --> 02:05:37.387
But my son will never do that unless we intervene.

02:05:38.488 --> 02:05:41.049
I trust you to decide whether we should.

02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:44.051
So he's not letting his sons run in the woods.

02:05:44.151 --> 02:05:45.612
I let my sons run in the woods.

02:05:45.652 --> 02:05:46.813
They've been bit by ticks.

02:05:48.494 --> 02:05:51.436
I'm not bragging that, oh, I don't care about lambs.

02:05:51.476 --> 02:05:52.596
That's not what I'm saying.

02:05:52.696 --> 02:05:54.358
I'm saying that it's crazy.

02:05:55.858 --> 02:06:01.242
The kinds of ideas that are thrown out on stage, it's crazy.

02:06:02.492 --> 02:06:10.237
And to see that this was before the pandemic, it must be a little rung on the ladder that you can use to help yourself climb out.

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:17.341
Because this is the real biology that you need to be worried about, not gain-of-function viruses.

02:06:17.381 --> 02:06:30.209
Yet not even a year after or two years after this talk, we are exclusively focused on gain-of-function viruses and to the tune that he actually testified in front of our government.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.922
that gain-of-function viruses needed regulation.

02:06:37.284 --> 02:06:37.624
And how?

02:06:39.025 --> 02:06:55.815
Imagine if local communities came together with scientists in New England town halls to make all the key decisions about whether and how to alter those local populations of mice that infect ticks.

02:06:56.926 --> 02:07:00.308
And if it works on a small scale, without a gene drive system.

02:07:00.609 --> 02:07:04.151
What about the ticks that feed off of the deer?

02:07:04.211 --> 02:07:05.412
I don't understand.

02:07:05.472 --> 02:07:07.573
What is he talking about?

02:07:08.394 --> 02:07:11.456
Are mice the only thing that ticks feed off of?

02:07:12.176 --> 02:07:13.737
What kind of, wow.

02:07:14.458 --> 02:07:17.260
Then we can start having discussions about scaling it up.

02:07:18.561 --> 02:07:21.503
It would be a grassroots local community.

02:07:21.603 --> 02:07:24.344
I mean, rats, squirrels, chipmunks.

02:07:24.564 --> 02:07:26.085
There's lots of different squirrels too.

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:29.967
You could think of small red squirrels or bigger gray squirrels, black squirrels.

02:07:30.007 --> 02:07:32.168
You could think of raccoons and opossum.

02:07:32.728 --> 02:07:35.490
It's, what is he talking about?

02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:38.271
Driven model of technology development.

02:07:39.232 --> 02:07:42.133
One that could be emulated by communities around the world.

02:07:43.134 --> 02:07:45.835
That is how we should do responsive science.

02:07:47.895 --> 02:07:49.116
But what about the open part?

02:07:50.076 --> 02:07:54.999
How can we ensure that gene drive technology is developed in the open?

02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:02.784
We can start by recognizing scientists who do things differently, who do share what they're going to do.

02:08:04.085 --> 02:08:09.268
But at the end of the day, you have to follow the money, because science is expensive.

02:08:10.648 --> 02:08:16.432
And that means that if we can successfully pressure funders, including our own governments,

02:08:17.557 --> 02:08:23.439
to require that gene drive research be open, then it will be.

02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:26.140
And we should do it soon.

02:08:27.641 --> 02:08:30.382
Because we need increasingly powerful technologies.

02:08:31.582 --> 02:08:32.822
We will find them.

02:08:33.923 --> 02:08:38.304
And with closed door science, we are mostly blind to the consequences.

02:08:39.605 --> 02:08:43.006
The blind pursuit of power brings only grief.

02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:53.453
It's true that it's easier to engineer biology than culture, but some technologies may be able to do both.

02:08:54.714 --> 02:09:00.357
So let's use GeneDrive to engineer an ecosystem, the scientific ecosystem.

02:09:01.078 --> 02:09:07.201
Let's use it to throw open the doors, to turn on the lights, and to repair our world.

02:09:08.442 --> 02:09:08.742
Thank you.

02:09:19.574 --> 02:09:43.576
Obviously that was gross but you need to see those things because Kevin Esvelt is one of the real people in the background working on the real technologies that they intend to incorporate into this inversion where once you give them the opportunity to use precision medicine that's based in RNA and call this the vaccination schedule or call this precision medicine or

02:09:44.216 --> 02:09:45.937
or personalized medicine, you're done.

02:09:46.037 --> 02:09:51.019
At any point in time, they can put a gene drive in that will, I don't know, just make you passive.

02:09:51.319 --> 02:10:04.143
I don't know what they will do, but I'm telling you that giving them access to your biology will inevitably lead to you being used as an experimental animal, your children and your grandchildren.

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:06.704
And they won't use their kids.

02:10:08.125 --> 02:10:08.805
That's the point.

02:10:10.717 --> 02:10:18.182
Ladies and gentlemen, it's been murder and lies, and it's been an expected amount of increased all-cause mortality that these people have been covering it up.

02:10:18.642 --> 02:10:26.488
That's why they talk about no evidence of spread, or they talk about protocols, but they won't tell you that they expected a lot of people to die in the coming years.

02:10:26.568 --> 02:10:30.510
There are good explanations for how PCR can be accurate, but also a complete lie.

02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:35.374
How the population pyramid provided this booming opportunity for them to create this illusion

02:10:35.854 --> 02:10:43.117
and how virology can be a lie, but transformation and transfection and cell culture and animals can be misconstrued as virology.

02:10:43.177 --> 02:10:46.638
We need a new consensus about these things, ladies and gentlemen.

02:10:46.718 --> 02:10:50.160
RNA cannot pandemic, and they've been lying to us about vaccines for decades.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:53.941
And they would definitely murder and lie in order to cover that up.

02:10:54.481 --> 02:10:56.242
Definitely, definitely, definitely.

02:10:56.302 --> 02:10:57.343
Thank you very much for joining me.

02:10:57.403 --> 02:10:58.603
I will see you again tomorrow.

02:10:59.023 --> 02:11:00.364
And there is a very,

02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:18.735
slim but not zero chance that i will stream this afternoon again because i really do owe you some shows and uh i really do need new subscribers so if you if you can um feel free to go to gigahomebiological.com and find a way to support the stream with a one-time donation of

02:11:19.515 --> 02:11:29.814
of tiny amount of money or $100,000 if you've got it, because my family and I would like to keep this going in perpetuity until this illusion is permanently broken.

02:11:30.255 --> 02:11:32.479
Thank you very much for joining me and I'll see you again tomorrow.

02:13:21.207 --> 02:13:22.007
Stop lying.

02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:28.009
Stop lying.

02:13:32.291 --> 02:13:35.512
I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.

02:13:47.276 --> 02:13:48.557
Thanks guys for your patience.

02:13:48.597 --> 02:13:49.237
I'll see you tomorrow.
