WEBVTT

00:09.301 --> 00:10.723
I have no responsibility

00:27.742 --> 00:31.704
military operations, but they were global military operations, right?

00:31.984 --> 00:34.626
Every country had exactly the same narrative.

00:35.106 --> 00:39.268
I was fortunate to be able to travel during COVID because I had natural immunity.

00:39.328 --> 00:42.410
Having had it for two days, I took ivermectin, I was fine.

00:43.751 --> 00:51.415
And so I saw, you know, two meters, masks, you know, be afraid, stay at home, lockdown, you know, schools closed, businesses tanked.

00:51.855 --> 00:53.316
All of that was on a global basis.

01:00.746 --> 01:15.675
Stop lying!

01:17.816 --> 01:18.637
He lied to me.

01:19.357 --> 01:22.199
I'm pretty convinced that I got used early on.

01:25.068 --> 01:27.630
in promoting the false narratives around this.

01:27.971 --> 01:30.433
And it pissed me off pretty good.

01:31.393 --> 01:38.319
And things like when I raised with Michael that it looked like this.

01:38.579 --> 01:42.202
I was doing sequence analysis like starting January 10th of 2020.

01:44.004 --> 01:47.506
And I raised with Michael this looked like it was an engineered pathogen.

01:47.687 --> 01:48.907
And his comment was,

01:49.648 --> 01:51.171
you know, straight out.

01:51.571 --> 01:52.793
These guys are really good at lying.

01:52.813 --> 01:58.483
You've got to understand, if you're dealing with anybody in the intelligence community that are operatives, they are trained liars.

01:59.429 --> 02:01.831
and train psychological manipulators.

02:01.851 --> 02:03.832
That's what they do, the field agents.

02:04.052 --> 02:05.433
Do you think you can pick one out now?

02:05.453 --> 02:08.756
I mean, someone said to me, Del, you've got to be surrounded by agents at this point.

02:08.856 --> 02:10.297
People around you, people you're talking to.

02:10.317 --> 02:11.257
It's highly probable.

02:11.297 --> 02:15.280
The work that you do, you've just got Bob and Kennedy, you know, no one wants them.

02:15.300 --> 02:19.183
That your cell phone and your data infrastructure are compromised.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.364
Yeah.

02:20.464 --> 02:22.885
With things like Pegasus 2, which you can't track.

02:24.822 --> 02:39.167
I've had people that we both know that when Jill and I turned in our old cell phones and got new ones, suddenly they came out of the woodwork and really wanted to interact with me and wanted me to answer their emails.

02:39.207 --> 02:43.609
Well, that's when you get a ping and then you respond, that's how Pegasus 2 gets loaded in.

02:45.147 --> 02:46.508
and they've gradually gone away.

02:46.548 --> 02:48.308
These people are absolutely out there.

02:49.169 --> 03:00.573
And anybody that's in our space, you kind of have to assume that you are interacting with them at one point or another, usually surreptitiously.

03:00.633 --> 03:07.296
So these are the chaos agents, and they're the ones that they so, so want to work with you.

03:08.076 --> 03:12.220
and collaborate with you and, and you, you know, you're like how brilliant you are.

03:12.261 --> 03:13.001
Precisely.

03:13.081 --> 03:14.363
Yeah, absolutely.

03:14.963 --> 03:25.554
Um, you know, it's not just, uh, the honey trap, um, with the short skirt, there's all kinds of ways to gain the confidence of somebody and flattery is one of them.

03:30.626 --> 03:49.156
Jonathan, who's going to talk about his latest distillation of what the pandemic means to society, to biology, to science, and to democracy, and a whole kind of idea of empiricism and integrity.

03:49.176 --> 03:53.538
And then each of us, this incredible preeminent

03:55.325 --> 04:00.348
have each one of you is going to get a chance to comment on his thesis.

04:00.648 --> 04:06.771
I wanted to bring everybody together because I've read Jonathan's thoughts about this.

04:06.811 --> 04:12.334
He's one of the most thoughtful critics of the pandemic management from the beginning.

04:13.074 --> 04:22.843
He was one of the co-founders of DRASTIC, which was the organization of independent scientists all over the world.

04:22.903 --> 04:35.754
Particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, did really wonderful work in understanding the science, in unearthing scientific studies that made a lot of this stuff comprehensible.

04:37.075 --> 04:56.442
And he's also been instrumental in uncovering some of the involvement of the intelligence agencies and others in the management of the pandemic and also the long history of what we call gain-of-function science.

05:07.549 --> 05:08.050
Actually, J.J.

05:08.070 --> 05:14.715
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

05:15.476 --> 05:15.977
Actually, J.J.

05:15.997 --> 05:22.642
Cooey's insistence, and I think he's right, on calling them transfections rather than vaccines.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.426
But you can tell if someone's lying.

05:27.086 --> 05:28.828
You know, you can sort of feel it in people.

05:30.626 --> 05:31.346
And I have lied.

05:31.366 --> 05:32.407
I'm sure I'll lie again.

05:32.427 --> 05:34.108
I don't want to lie, you know?

05:34.228 --> 05:35.188
I don't think I'm a liar.

05:35.288 --> 05:36.308
I try not to be a liar.

05:36.348 --> 05:37.209
I don't want to be a liar.

05:37.769 --> 05:40.550
I think it's, like, really important not to be a liar.

05:48.754 --> 05:50.314
I think truth is good for kids.

05:50.734 --> 05:54.536
We're so busy lying, we don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

05:55.036 --> 05:56.677
We want everybody to feel good.

05:57.597 --> 05:58.758
That's not the way life is.

06:01.308 --> 06:02.629
Testing one, two, test.

06:02.689 --> 06:03.589
Good morning, everybody.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.249
Good to see you.

06:04.349 --> 06:06.530
30th of June, 2025.

06:06.590 --> 06:08.291
GigaOM Biological, welcome to the show.

06:33.396 --> 06:34.598
I don't care how you get there.

06:34.618 --> 06:37.303
I don't care what you do to get there.

06:37.323 --> 06:39.948
The goal is to win.

06:54.648 --> 06:58.651
One slider, two low, and you blow it for the whole show.

06:58.671 --> 06:59.972
Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.

06:59.992 --> 07:07.338
This is GigaOM Biological, where we stay focused on the biology, we don't take their bait on social media, and we love our neighbors.

07:08.924 --> 07:09.705
Great to see you.

07:09.725 --> 07:16.189
I hope I caught you somewhere happy on a Monday, having had a long, hot weekend, perhaps.

07:17.350 --> 07:26.596
This is a long-standing warning to get off of social media, and most importantly, to try and get your children off of social media, your

07:28.644 --> 07:29.805
your children.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.728
We will not call autism.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.251
I don't like the word autism.

07:35.331 --> 07:36.392
He was vaccine damaged.

07:36.732 --> 07:40.115
He was neurologically damaged.

07:40.235 --> 07:41.376
We will not call autism.

07:41.477 --> 07:42.117
Okay, Brian.

07:42.177 --> 07:43.058
Seriously, I get it.

07:43.158 --> 07:43.939
I had to mute him.

07:44.479 --> 07:45.901
He's always just going off.

07:46.381 --> 07:52.948
Every time I talk to 2013 Brian Hooker, he reminds me that autism spectrum disorder is a myth that's

07:53.548 --> 08:02.680
used to make sure that intramuscular injection is never questioned as a methodology, that virology is never questioned as a science, and that public health is never questioned as a reason.

08:03.160 --> 08:09.208
And actually, the pandemic has used gain-of-function and the whole idea of a pandemic and virology

08:10.128 --> 08:18.891
exactly the same way and our passing this idea set onto our children is essentially passing on these myths that come along with it.

08:19.391 --> 08:31.135
These terrible myths are part of a trap that you don't want to be in but you don't know why the cheese is free yet on social media otherwise you wouldn't be there and you'd be one of the few people that watches this live on PeerTube.

08:32.055 --> 08:36.799
Because even YouTube, Twitch, Rumble X, they're all in on it.

08:36.839 --> 08:43.123
They're all part of the same illusion where AI has solved the problem of protein folding.

08:43.604 --> 08:47.586
Or AI is going to solve the problem of the human genome.

08:47.626 --> 08:48.807
It's all nonsense.

08:48.967 --> 08:57.654
And they have to ignore this show because I have these connections to a lot of these people that are now on stage regularly.

08:57.674 --> 09:00.035
So I'm a pretty inconvenient player.

09:01.076 --> 09:11.371
As is Housatonic Live and his website housatonicits.com if you haven't seen it You are really in the wrong place or at least not in the wrong place, but you've stumbled into a very different

09:13.499 --> 09:18.242
teacher's lounge than you thought you were stumbling into and that would mean you don't know this substack either.

09:18.322 --> 09:19.062
Please follow it.

09:19.582 --> 09:27.107
Please let everyone know about it because what happened in Scotland is one of the few places where the terror was documented.

09:27.127 --> 09:29.048
It can be characterized as that.

09:29.088 --> 09:34.431
It was a psychological terror operation and there were lots of actors involved.

09:35.151 --> 09:46.559
And most of the actors that are really intimate to the show will actually tell you exactly what's going on and also tell you that you won't be able to figure it out because it's so deadly.

09:47.059 --> 09:48.360
It's so crafty.

09:48.780 --> 09:53.063
It's so fifth generation that you just don't stand a chance.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.364
That's what they want you to believe.

09:54.904 --> 10:01.089
And I think that myth is being hoisted upon the children of the West, especially those children in America.

10:01.909 --> 10:05.452
so that they don't see any alternative other than to burn it all to the ground.

10:05.512 --> 10:18.001
Instead of coming together as a nation and using the Constitution against them, they want us to open the Constitution to amendment and they're going to change a few things and make everything fine.

10:18.062 --> 10:20.143
No, ladies and gentlemen, stay focused on the biology.

10:20.183 --> 10:22.045
Don't take that bait on social media.

10:22.065 --> 10:22.725
Love your neighbors.

10:22.785 --> 10:23.686
Find out who they are.

10:24.346 --> 10:27.489
Get to know them and understand that we're all in the same trap.

10:28.329 --> 10:31.112
If you've been here for a while, though, you might be surfing at the top here.

10:32.312 --> 10:34.713
It's not any less wet at the top of the wave.

10:35.273 --> 10:37.935
It's not any less dangerous at the top of the wave.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.236
It just feels a little better.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.717
It's not as if the wave lasts forever.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.559
It's not as if you don't have to swim back out again.

10:47.639 --> 10:49.039
And so that's the trick.

10:50.740 --> 10:55.641
Do not fall for this short times, time horizon narratives.

10:55.701 --> 10:59.102
Don't fall for these short time horizon mysteries.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.343
The voice that you hear is that of Jonathan J. Cooley.

11:02.383 --> 11:04.184
I'm chief biologist at GigaOM Biological.

11:04.224 --> 11:06.844
I come to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the back of my garage.

11:07.384 --> 11:12.106
You can find the stain of my academic work on the National Library of Medicine website, PubMed.

11:12.126 --> 11:12.926
You can also find

11:13.546 --> 11:38.686
A hint of what I've been trying to get out for the last three or four years on the substack called Woodhouse 76 You would be able to find at least three two-hour presentations of me by Panda from the year 2022 But I've shown you in the videos in the introduction everything that I did up until 2022 has been purposefully ignored because basically by the beginning of 2022 I'd figured it out

11:40.627 --> 11:44.409
And so they did all kinds of things to try and get me back on side.

11:44.949 --> 11:47.250
They had me help Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.651
with some citations in that Wuhan cover-up book.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.232
They put me in the acknowledgments.

11:52.292 --> 11:54.453
They put me in the index and cast of characters.

11:54.513 --> 12:01.016
It's really quite remarkable how much of my current stance on the biology is in that book.

12:02.157 --> 12:17.472
And then I got to work for Children's Health Defense until finally Mary fired me for talking about Mr. Robert Malone, now on the ACIP, as co-chair with Martin Kulldorff, a good friend of my barbecue buddy, Jay Bhattacharya, who hasn't called me since he got the call-up.

12:18.373 --> 12:22.737
You know, I mean, Major League Baseball players don't send postcards to their

12:23.638 --> 12:27.280
to their minor league teammates.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.881
That would be being kind of dick.

12:28.981 --> 12:29.782
So I get it.

12:30.162 --> 12:31.362
He's made the big leagues.

12:31.462 --> 12:31.903
I haven't.

12:32.783 --> 12:39.167
I'm still here on YouTube with a channel called JC on a Bike and another channel called JC in the Woods.

12:39.227 --> 12:39.887
I'm on Twitch.

12:39.987 --> 12:40.688
I'm on Rumble.

12:40.848 --> 12:42.028
I'm on my own PeerTube.

12:42.088 --> 12:42.969
And nobody sees me.

12:43.009 --> 12:43.649
That's OK.

12:43.809 --> 12:45.730
That's what happens when you're a minor league player.

12:46.871 --> 12:51.154
But minor league players are paid the same way as the major league players.

12:52.574 --> 12:56.438
You know, they just have followers and they just get donations.

12:57.619 --> 13:00.962
You know, there's no motivation for a salary.

13:01.002 --> 13:03.004
There's no motivation for future promises.

13:03.564 --> 13:06.968
They're all just doing it for the grandchildren of Earth.

13:07.008 --> 13:07.568
Yeah, right.

13:08.329 --> 13:12.793
But we are, at GigaOMBiological.com, we are doing this for the grandchildren of Earth.

13:12.833 --> 13:16.657
This is a family of five putting it all on the line behind their dad, their papa.

13:18.569 --> 13:19.490
behind their husband.

13:20.151 --> 13:21.251
That's what you see here.

13:21.752 --> 13:27.976
So if you think that this is overproduced, or it looks like there's too much work involved, or wow, look at all this stuff.

13:28.757 --> 13:29.918
Look at all of his slides.

13:29.978 --> 13:45.189
I can tell you right now, this is what happens when you let one of the best, one of the brightest young talents as a college level biology professor, when you let them go.

13:47.205 --> 13:55.700
I could hold a lecture hall's attention better than perhaps anybody that I met in the field.

13:56.681 --> 13:59.186
And I often got compliments that

13:59.946 --> 14:01.427
that belied that rank.

14:03.188 --> 14:05.270
And people wanted me to present their work.

14:05.871 --> 14:09.914
People wanted me to be the representative of their lab.

14:11.235 --> 14:16.258
And I think that's what you see here in this stream.

14:17.099 --> 14:26.386
You're just gonna see a really good biology teacher, but I like to call myself a biology coach because biology is so much more about trying to get you to take it on yourself.

14:27.747 --> 14:28.548
It's a bit like,

14:29.488 --> 14:32.030
It's a bit like, how can I say it?

14:32.870 --> 14:34.311
It's a bit like piano.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.692
You know, you could call yourself a piano teacher.

14:38.033 --> 14:42.736
But I think what you really want to be is a piano coach.

14:43.396 --> 14:44.457
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

14:44.477 --> 14:45.517
This is Giggo and Biological.

14:46.538 --> 14:52.662
A piano coach, in the sense of what you're trying to do is inspire a student to work on their own.

14:53.102 --> 14:56.124
Inspire a student to be so eager to learn that they

14:57.233 --> 15:00.314
they can't be contained by any single lesson.

15:00.974 --> 15:17.157
You can get together and talk with them and try to put them on a certain track, but by the time they get back to you, they should have been done with that, eaten it all up, and moved on to other things, and they should have brought back a whole other table full of potential ideas that they can explore with you as a coach.

15:18.498 --> 15:18.818
And so,

15:19.935 --> 15:35.284
For me, as a biology coach, I would like to be somebody in the future who can help high school teachers learn biology, but also help high school teachers ignite that flame inside of them where they want to learn it themselves.

15:35.304 --> 15:47.831
And they don't need a guy like me too often except to come in and check up to see what I'm coaching people on, what I'm suggesting people look into, or what kind of verbiage I'm suggesting be changed.

15:50.086 --> 15:52.807
I think we can build that here at Giga Home Biological.

15:52.827 --> 15:58.968
I think we can make something that's more of a resource for teachers and a resource for students at the same time.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.308
That's what I think a coach is.

16:01.488 --> 16:04.369
Because a real good teacher should be a student, right?

16:04.509 --> 16:08.790
And so, in the end, what we need are coaches.

16:08.870 --> 16:13.091
We need people who can point people in the right direction and we need adults

16:14.133 --> 16:27.339
And that can stem from, you know, 17 year old precocious adult all the way up to a to a 75 year old person who realizes they still have 10 years left to change the world, to plant trees under whose shade they won't sit.

16:28.660 --> 16:33.482
And they might decide that, you know what, I think I want to invest in a high school curriculum that will live beyond me.

16:33.542 --> 16:41.626
I think I want to invest in a coach that's going to try and and build a high school curriculum that will last longer than any of us, because that's really where

16:42.253 --> 16:44.835
where this is and where I see this being.

16:44.895 --> 17:01.087
And that's why I'm spending so much time trying to get myself back into reasonable shape where I won't hurt myself on the basketball court because I think that focusing on moving forward, trying to teach biology, coach biology is really the only thing we can do.

17:01.127 --> 17:06.311
We can't hope to flip the entire narrative and change the world all at once.

17:06.432 --> 17:10.715
All we can do is to start, ah, ah, I see.

17:11.826 --> 17:17.589
All we can start to do is try to build something that when people come they find something there, right?

17:17.769 --> 17:22.651
We want to have it in as many places as possible, in as many forms as possible.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.092
I really like the idea of art.

17:24.152 --> 17:26.713
I can't see what I'm doing here because I'm so blind.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.174
There we go.

17:28.514 --> 17:37.579
And I really like the idea of having gatherings of teachers, gatherings of high school teachers trying to find a way to

17:38.260 --> 17:39.461
to establish that network.

17:39.481 --> 17:42.424
So we got a lot of plans, a lot of ideas that are working in the background.

17:43.445 --> 17:47.369
And the first thing that needs to be done is finally have this 5013C established.

17:51.039 --> 18:02.989
And I'm not sure if it's going to be the intellectual bright web or if we're going to call it just gigaohm again or what, but we are going to have something where potentially we could do billboards, potentially we could fund other people.

18:04.069 --> 18:11.916
Mark Kulak, for example, is somebody who's right now net zero or negative with his family and how the money comes into the house.

18:11.996 --> 18:12.976
And so unlike me,

18:15.643 --> 18:20.885
who has a little bit of a simpler equation in the sense of we kind of just fly by the seat of our pants here.

18:21.866 --> 18:22.846
We don't own our house.

18:23.086 --> 18:25.287
We rent for an incredibly high number.

18:26.508 --> 18:28.428
And we just try to make that number every month.

18:28.889 --> 18:33.531
And because of the generosity of my subscribers, and that's how we get there.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.111
That's it.

18:35.191 --> 18:36.592
And that list isn't very long.

18:36.632 --> 18:40.053
I mean, if you do the math, you'll figure out that there have to be some other people, and there are.

18:43.203 --> 18:49.115
Given the amount of investment of time and energy and equipment and whatever, we're still big time in the hole.

18:49.496 --> 18:53.665
I probably have invested close to...

18:54.784 --> 18:59.086
I don't know, $4,000 in books, maybe give or take.

18:59.246 --> 19:07.190
I mean, there's a lot of books in here that you don't see and a lot of books that I'm taking notes on and reading and using the index to optimize.

19:07.230 --> 19:16.754
I mean, in reality, you know, everybody that shows you books behind them like that, those are all, that's just a fantasy world unless you know how they have been used.

19:17.035 --> 19:23.938
And for me, I can tell you how all of these books have been used and I can tell you whether I've used them or not because I have marks on their binding too.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.061
to tell myself what I've found there and where they are, and they're marked if I have.

19:28.141 --> 19:32.804
So, this is an ongoing project behind me, an ongoing project in this room.

19:33.305 --> 19:43.972
And every time that I make progress in any of these books and start to synthesize what all these books agree on as the history, it's starting to become very obvious to me that there's a gap.

19:45.814 --> 19:47.255
There's a historical gap.

19:48.157 --> 20:05.193
between the time when Max Delbruck and Luria and these other people, Szilard, all of these people that were physicists were coming together under the pretense that bacteria and phages might be a way to get at the foundational rules of life.

20:07.455 --> 20:12.840
And that transition

20:14.784 --> 20:43.253
from a time when the predominant viruses of interest were bacterial, to the time when we are now supposedly in a time when, I'm going to get there, in a time when we accept, at least a certain sect of modern academic biology accepts, that the vast majority of genetic signals in the background are actually phages, many of which, if not the majority of which, have never been characterized.

20:45.171 --> 20:59.420
And this is the biological dark matter that the global national security state, the global national security operation that is the Human Genome Project, needed to hijack.

21:01.001 --> 21:06.464
And somebody like Nathan Wolf, with the book, what was his book again?

21:07.785 --> 21:09.046
Sorry, I gotta spin this around.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.631
I'm just a little bit, this is like my memory palace.

21:13.751 --> 21:21.716
You know, if I have the vision, visual of it, then I can really see all of what's going on in my head too.

21:21.776 --> 21:23.797
I can kind of put everything in a timeline.

21:24.678 --> 21:26.699
The viral storm is what it was called.

21:26.799 --> 21:28.420
Yes, yes, the viral storm.

21:29.421 --> 21:37.205
And so what this book is essentially doing for them and what it was intended to do for them was to take this

21:38.320 --> 21:53.288
irreducibly complex background of biological signals composed almost exclusively of bacterial signals and their phages that in some narratives prey upon them, but I think in a better model would be part of them.

21:53.408 --> 21:58.511
It would be one whole pattern integrity, bacteria and their phages.

21:58.811 --> 22:07.056
And in order to understand them as a component of the irreducibly complex background, you have to understand them in concert

22:07.722 --> 22:12.130
You can't understand one as the pathogen of the other.

22:12.170 --> 22:17.600
You can't understand one as evolving separate or evolving to compete with the other.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.025
And yet that is precisely the story.

22:22.563 --> 22:39.332
that happens if you take the biological model of phages and the presence of this irreducibly complex background and then take that biological dark matter and say that it's all pathogens looking to infect us.

22:40.252 --> 22:41.253
Because that's what they've done.

22:42.523 --> 23:04.140
Nathan Wolfe and Peter Daszak and all of these virologists and all these gain-of-function people, what they are is a great big bullshit storm which is trying to confound an irreducibly complex background of bacterial signals into a forever providing

23:05.677 --> 23:07.078
pandemic source.

23:07.518 --> 23:18.605
So, you know, pandemics can come forever because there's this irreducibly complex background from which they will always emerge that Peter Daszak said from which 1.7 million viruses are waiting to jump.

23:20.286 --> 23:25.470
There aren't 1.7 million viruses of anything other than phages.

23:25.570 --> 23:33.535
All the other things are signals which are misconstrued as something that is spreading, something that went from a point to endemicity.

23:35.134 --> 23:50.180
And so the assumption that they work on is that all these signals are endemic, potentially endemic, we don't know if they're endemic, so we just look and we find them and we tell whatever story we want to, all under the pretense that this irreducibly complex background of phages is just worth ignoring.

23:50.420 --> 23:55.723
In fact, we don't even need to show you that our signal is differentiable from that signal.

23:56.423 --> 24:05.230
All we have to do is take our signal, recreate it in recombinant DNA, apply it to a cell culture, and now you're forced to believe everything we claim about the natural signal.

24:05.891 --> 24:16.119
That's how simple it is to debunk virology while at the same time not saying there are no viruses, which would be absurd.

24:17.280 --> 24:24.066
Because we know there's an irreducibly complex background to phages, and even the no-virus people have, on camera, acknowledged it.

24:25.711 --> 24:27.291
And so something's really goofy here.

24:27.391 --> 24:41.795
Something is super goofy, and that is their wide acceptance of this idea of endemicity, the wide acceptance of the idea that there is a health freedom movement, there are anti-vaxxers.

24:42.416 --> 24:46.397
And the scary part is, ladies and gentlemen, is those people are all part of the trap.

24:46.877 --> 24:54.619
They are all as trapped as anybody that believes this was a natural virus and that the transfection saved millions of people from potential death.

24:55.359 --> 24:57.160
certainly from serious disease.

24:57.701 --> 25:10.490
And that absurdity is just as absurd as the other, that there is a lab leak virus that they covered up that went around the world and caused cardiac symptoms until its spike protein stopped doing that.

25:11.051 --> 25:17.896
And then we transfected people to the spike protein that caused the cardiac symptoms, and now that's why we have cardiac symptoms in these people with clots.

25:18.716 --> 25:24.581
And we said it was amyloid in 2020, and so saying it's amyloid now makes it amyloid, even if it's just fibrinogen.

25:25.939 --> 25:29.662
That's how malevolent of a position we are in.

25:30.463 --> 25:36.828
Because social media has convinced people that they have solved the mystery, that they got the right answer.

25:39.560 --> 25:56.125
And I cannot stress enough how separated we are from our family and friends that are Democrats or think that Trump is nuts or we are so far from seeing eye to eye that we are in a very dangerous position.

25:56.165 --> 25:59.926
And there's only one way for all of us to see eye to eye.

25:59.966 --> 26:05.488
And that is that we must all come to understand that there was a biological signal

26:06.820 --> 26:12.512
that it was anticipated and that it was available to be lied about.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.177
So it didn't take very much manslaughter.

26:17.182 --> 26:23.826
to go from an anticipated rise that everybody's got to deal with to, of course, some kind of crisis.

26:24.086 --> 26:24.726
Big numbers.

26:24.806 --> 26:25.387
Look at them.

26:25.447 --> 26:37.593
And they're numbers which are absolutely revealed as bullshit when you realize we just stopped treating pneumonia with antibiotics for two years, and that was almost all we needed.

26:37.733 --> 26:45.338
Now, if you factor in the half a million drug overdose deaths in America and the age group in which those fell,

26:46.562 --> 27:05.094
now you have the perfect narrative where a virus hit everybody because everybody is vulnerable and so much so that it reduced the life expectancy in America the age you know that people died and that is the narrative that all of these people are sticking to lying about

27:06.178 --> 27:12.661
talking about VAERS and the spike protein and amyloid clots and integration of the DNA.

27:12.681 --> 27:16.422
They're all lying about manslaughter and opioids.

27:16.622 --> 27:17.062
That's it.

27:17.402 --> 27:18.263
It's that simple.

27:19.383 --> 27:24.785
Because it was an anticipated rise in all-cause mortality that was sculpted using manslaughter and lies.

27:24.825 --> 27:30.488
And lots of people are unwittingly participating, including maybe Grace Shara's dad.

27:30.588 --> 27:31.068
I don't know.

27:32.503 --> 27:35.684
But clearly no one was charged with manslaughter.

27:36.244 --> 27:40.906
And the reason why is because apparently going into a hospital gives them consent to kill you.

27:41.886 --> 27:43.126
It's a pretty simple story.

27:44.547 --> 27:52.549
And yet somehow or another they have blown it, but it's a model and we should do the same thing with other people or something like that.

27:52.609 --> 27:58.651
I don't know what to say about Scott Shara, but to say that I'm disappointed would be a gross understatement.

28:01.718 --> 28:10.942
We are in big trouble because Americans were essentially murdered, but I think legally it would be manslaughter in order to create the illusion of a pandemic.

28:11.042 --> 28:17.746
And people like Denny Rancor were put in place to make sure that nobody would say, Hey, there's a, there was a signal in the population pyramid.

28:17.786 --> 28:20.687
Couldn't they have anticipated this rise in all causes?

28:20.707 --> 28:21.988
Where's that in your data?

28:22.748 --> 28:26.069
And he pretends not to know another thing that happened.

28:26.129 --> 28:26.870
Now, this is very,

28:28.527 --> 28:34.330
This is very heartbreaking to say out loud because I know it to be true to the deepest of my soul.

28:36.111 --> 28:42.334
But the way that this worked for a woman by the name of Brandy Vaughn was that Brandy Vaughn started to say it too correctly.

28:43.874 --> 28:47.856
Her and her friend Tony Bark started to say it too correctly.

28:48.537 --> 28:50.778
That there is no good vaccine.

28:51.338 --> 28:57.821
That intramuscular injection is just dumb because it bypasses all of the natural defenses of the body.

28:59.420 --> 29:01.302
It's so different than ingestion.

29:03.364 --> 29:13.235
And so what they did in 2018 and before was they put somebody like Suzanne Humphreys and Mary Holland and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

29:13.596 --> 29:20.744
and Larry Cook and all these other evil people like Judy Mikovits in front of people like Tony Bark.

29:21.849 --> 29:29.894
and Brandy Vaughn on the same stage, saying the same shit that they say, and then they knock these two off and stop saying it.

29:33.336 --> 29:48.144
And I could only make that accusation if there was evidence that when Brandy was saying there's a huge difference between ingestion and injection and that no vaccines are any good, so was Suzanne Humphreys.

29:49.312 --> 29:58.758
But now, Suzanne Humphries went on Joe Rogan, and Joe Rogan actually asked her, you know, you know, so are there any good vaccines?

29:58.858 --> 30:12.928
Now, it would be crazy, right, if during the time when Brandy Vaughn was alive and they were on stage together, that she would have said it very precisely, no, there are no good vaccines because vaccines are biologically dumb.

30:14.528 --> 30:16.290
and then stopped saying it.

30:16.410 --> 30:24.999
And then when in 2025, nine years later, she had a chance to go on Joe Rogan, she would have said, Oh, for sure.

30:25.059 --> 30:26.381
There are no good vaccines.

30:26.561 --> 30:28.603
I've been saying it for 10 years.

30:30.725 --> 30:31.967
I say it in my book.

30:33.680 --> 30:45.612
Wouldn't it be crazy if after all these years, after having a book in 2013 that apparently says there are no good vaccines, apparently explains that intramuscular injection is dumb and RNA could never pandemic.

30:45.652 --> 30:47.955
So these are all, you know, it doesn't.

30:48.816 --> 30:50.577
What's happening on Joe Rogan?

30:50.598 --> 30:51.218
Let's just see.

30:51.258 --> 30:51.819
There's a clip.

30:53.254 --> 31:21.802
because I think this play with them all getting with Brandy and with Tony and kind of saying the same stuff that Brandy and Tony are saying on the same stage and agreeing with them was to make sure that when Tony and Brandy were finally offed, that these people would be right there to forget their names and then to dial it back a little bit and start to build a health freedom, big top tent of health freedom that would get Bobby Kennedy in the White House.

31:25.273 --> 31:26.974
Hmm, let's see what we got here.

31:30.196 --> 31:31.716
Darn it, I didn't do that right, did I?

31:32.617 --> 31:33.337
No, I did not.

31:38.340 --> 31:38.780
There we go.

31:41.322 --> 31:44.823
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

31:46.744 --> 31:48.525
The question of the century, isn't it?

31:48.806 --> 31:51.327
Okay, now, we have to back up a minute because

31:52.051 --> 31:55.013
I had that same question, and I had to go dig deep.

31:55.073 --> 31:58.056
All the questions you have in your head right now, I had them too at one point.

31:58.636 --> 32:11.186
So here I am, a medical doctor, working in the field, believing in pretty much everything I was told, giving hundreds if not thousands of vaccines out to my patients, hepatitis B vaccines in particular, flu shots for sure.

32:11.846 --> 32:15.689
I was a nephrologist, kidney specialist, and dialysis, et cetera.

32:18.874 --> 32:40.164
Initially, so what I'm arguing for you to do right now is to stay focused on the biology Don't take their bait on social media of which a huge fish on the line always is the Rogan show And finally to love your neighbor now this lady is not your neighbor this lady right here is not your neighbor.

32:40.184 --> 32:40.224
Oh

32:51.519 --> 32:52.640
Oh, I see what I did here.

32:56.163 --> 32:57.924
Bring to the front there.

32:58.985 --> 33:02.508
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

33:02.969 --> 33:06.212
So that's a pretty good question of the century, isn't it?

33:06.492 --> 33:06.792
Okay.

33:06.912 --> 33:14.418
Now we have to back up a minute because I had that same question and I had to go dig deep to all the questions you have in your head right now.

33:14.559 --> 33:15.980
I had them too at one helpful.

33:18.332 --> 33:21.034
So again, I'm just trying to rearrange the slide a little bit.

33:21.094 --> 33:21.715
I apologize.

33:21.735 --> 33:23.476
Sometimes I like it to look exactly right.

33:24.897 --> 33:26.999
No, all the time I like it to look exactly right.

33:27.039 --> 33:31.542
That's why I have a problem getting started on time sometimes, because it's the little details of the slides that bother me.

33:31.583 --> 33:32.483
So I'm saving it again.

33:33.524 --> 33:36.466
So I'm trying to cue up the idea again.

33:36.506 --> 33:39.609
Remember, the idea is that if this video

33:41.374 --> 33:46.058
of Brandy and Suzanne Humphreys exists.

33:46.338 --> 33:57.827
And we know that Brandy was saying intramuscular injection is very different than ingestion and arguing that they're just a bad idea, that they're all full of poisons that are not tested, yada, yada, yada.

33:58.307 --> 34:02.871
She was basically saying, learn the risk, they're all toxic, all vaccines are toxic.

34:03.972 --> 34:05.833
And her son had no vaccines.

34:06.494 --> 34:06.634
So

34:08.197 --> 34:10.438
She met Tony Bark around this time.

34:10.518 --> 34:25.023
Tony Bark being a former head of the ER at Rush Presbyterian Hospital, which is one of the most fabulous medical schools and hospitals in the Chicagoland area and maybe in the United States.

34:25.903 --> 34:27.244
I would have probably

34:28.658 --> 34:32.781
given the pinky on my left hand to get admitted into that hospital at the time.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.922
I mean, that's a pretty big sacrifice in my mind.

34:35.522 --> 34:36.923
That means you're willing to do anything.

34:38.464 --> 34:40.826
I really wanted to go to Rush Medical School.

34:40.886 --> 34:44.168
I really wanted to work in the ER.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.369
And so it's really weird.

34:47.050 --> 34:55.115
You know, I was like, in some ways on a path almost to meet Tony Bark in some odd, strange way.

34:55.475 --> 34:56.716
And it's just,

34:58.044 --> 34:59.106
It's remarkable to me.

34:59.427 --> 35:03.555
It really is remarkable to me that in the end there are only a few people on earth

35:04.198 --> 35:17.083
that have gotten all the way to camp four, where they could make a push for the summit, where they could just say, you know what, I can almost explain all the bullshit that I know and explain it well enough that you would actually understand it.

35:17.563 --> 35:25.286
And I've put in enough time on the camps one and two and three and four where you can take my word for it.

35:25.326 --> 35:27.067
There are very few people who've worked that hard.

35:27.127 --> 35:27.667
Most people

35:28.687 --> 35:36.492
are using Sherpas and it's really just an easy two-day trek to the top.

35:38.106 --> 35:50.494
Now, Suzanne Humphries is somebody who essentially said it right when she was around Brandy Vaughn, on stage with Brandy Vaughn, or in a video that was supposed to stand in front of Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker.

35:50.674 --> 35:52.896
Otherwise, she doesn't say it right.

35:52.996 --> 35:55.117
Now remember, she's had a book since 2013.

35:55.177 --> 35:59.640
She's been on stages since 2013, 14, 15, 16, 17, Cal Jam, whatever jam, whatever this shit, all over the place in these anti-vax

36:08.586 --> 36:09.887
you know, circles.

36:10.868 --> 36:17.392
Along with Judy Mikovits and Mary Holland, Brian Hooker and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

36:17.773 --> 36:19.614
and James Lyons Weiler.

36:20.074 --> 36:28.440
And this slowly crescendoed up until 2020 when both Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark would die.

36:29.676 --> 36:31.417
So this is scripted bullshit.

36:31.458 --> 36:34.420
This whole run-up to the pandemic was scripted bullshit.

36:34.460 --> 36:39.964
That's why Brandy Vaughn was so upset that everybody in the movement wasn't making any progress.

36:40.004 --> 36:43.527
They weren't taking on her ideas and saying them.

36:43.968 --> 36:48.872
They were just saying freedom and health and choice and mandates and she didn't understand it.

36:49.032 --> 36:56.198
Very similar to how I couldn't understand it in 2022 when I had explained it to Bobby and Bobby said, well, let's have you on with

36:56.678 --> 37:01.119
Robert Malone and Meryl Nass and Jessica Rose and Tess Laurie and you could explain it to them.

37:01.179 --> 37:02.840
That just didn't make any sense to me.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.722
Those people should have already done known better a long time ago and I'd already explained that to him too.

37:11.603 --> 37:12.843
So what does she say on Rogue?

37:12.883 --> 37:16.324
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

37:18.416 --> 37:20.037
question of the century isn't it?

37:20.258 --> 37:43.218
Sorry now I'm gonna escape one more time because I want to get that out of her face so you can see that this is an old lady okay this is an old lady so if I have a video where you can see that she is significantly younger you know like five or ten years younger and she says it better than she says it on Joe Rogan what does that mean?

37:44.315 --> 38:02.914
What would it mean for all the people that read her book and spread it around the world that after 10 years, 12 years after the book is published, she said it better in 2017 in the same video as Brandy Vaughn than she said it now on Joe Rogan, one of the largest

38:04.432 --> 38:09.476
social opportunities to get her word out after all these years.

38:09.576 --> 38:18.223
After all these years, she was given two and a half hours of uncensored, still on YouTube, Joe Rogan time.

38:19.064 --> 38:29.513
What did this hero say when Joe Rogan asked her what, you know, have there been any good vaccines?

38:32.543 --> 38:36.029
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

38:37.972 --> 38:39.734
The question of the century, isn't it?

38:40.035 --> 38:42.539
Okay, now, we have to back up a minute because

38:43.280 --> 38:46.221
I had that same question, and I had to go dig deep.

38:46.301 --> 38:49.263
All the questions you have in your head right now, I had them too at one point.

38:49.863 --> 39:02.388
So here I am, a medical doctor, working in the field, believing in pretty much everything I was told, giving hundreds if not thousands of vaccines out to my patients, hepatitis B vaccines in particular, flu shots for sure.

39:03.068 --> 39:06.910
I was a nephrologist, kidney specialist, and dialysis, et cetera.

39:10.106 --> 39:13.050
initially, you know, we all kind of have an aversion to needles.

39:13.090 --> 39:14.511
I think it's a natural human aversion.

39:14.532 --> 39:19.257
So when we're kids, we don't, no one's going, Oh, I want to go get my vaccines.

39:19.277 --> 39:19.938
You get over it.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.780
Most of us were lucky enough to get over it.

39:23.683 --> 39:27.047
So by the time the first instance of

39:27.830 --> 39:36.153
problem occurred in front of my eyes, I was already a fully seasoned professor of medicine, you know, working in a tertiary care medical center, okay.

39:36.754 --> 39:50.119
And so it's been a bit of a process because for me it was the influenza vaccines in 2008, 2009 that showed me without a doubt that vaccines can and do cause kidney failure and put people on dialysis, that that does happen.

39:50.419 --> 39:51.820
It can cause hypertension.

39:51.980 --> 39:52.880
It's really annoying, hold on one second.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.141
We're not told to take a vaccine history in medical

39:56.909 --> 40:00.672
I'm going to do something like I'm going to try and save this and I'm going to restart PowerPoint.

40:00.712 --> 40:02.634
Maybe it's just a big video or something.

40:02.694 --> 40:03.035
I don't know.

40:03.055 --> 40:04.035
That's annoying to me though.

40:05.677 --> 40:09.540
And so again, I'll just talk you through it because I really think this needs to sink.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.922
This needs to sink in.

40:11.122 --> 40:14.725
People need to actually understand that it's not acceptable.

40:14.745 --> 40:15.626
Oh yeah.

40:15.806 --> 40:17.327
I had too many things open.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.368
I think that's what it was.

40:18.849 --> 40:19.970
This can be closed.

40:20.090 --> 40:21.071
That can be closed.

40:22.927 --> 40:32.251
It's not acceptable for somebody who had a book in 2013 that they claim debunks vaccines.

40:33.111 --> 40:39.074
And then for them to be in 2025, still not just saying it very plainly, yeah, there's no good vaccine.

40:39.774 --> 40:50.139
Now, if there's any video, any video evidence at all that like Brandy Vaughn, that like Tony Bark, Suzanne Humphreys was saying,

40:50.984 --> 41:07.537
that there's no good vaccine back when they were alive, but isn't saying it now, then we have a pretty big problem on our hands because that would be a liar and not that dissimilar to if there was an audio or video of Brian Hooker in 2013 saying that he didn't use the word autism.

41:07.917 --> 41:09.458
He didn't like the word autism.

41:09.838 --> 41:11.480
His son was vaccine damaged.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.061
He was neurologically damaged.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.382
We will not call it autism.

41:16.303 --> 41:17.724
I don't like the word autism.

41:18.565 --> 41:19.826
He was vaccine damaged.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.923
And now Brian says autism, uses the word autism, and says that autism is caused by vaccines.

41:29.483 --> 41:42.368
You must see this for the lie and the absolute traitorous behavior that it is, or you won't be able to see through this fake health freedom movement.

41:42.408 --> 41:46.210
The people that were put in place have said it when it's safe,

41:47.626 --> 41:57.778
said it when it was necessary to stand in front of somebody else who was saying it, like me, like Brandy, like Tony, and I'm not comparing what I've done to what they've done.

41:57.818 --> 42:07.789
I'm just saying that I'm on the same track and I've had the same experience where every time I think somebody's a good guy, it turns out that they're working with the guy that I just figured out was a bad guy.

42:11.732 --> 42:16.813
And Brandy was losing her mind at the end of her life because so many people had betrayed her.

42:16.873 --> 42:26.256
So many people after all these years of talking to them at hotel breakfasts and talking to them over drinks that nobody is, the messaging doesn't progress.

42:27.056 --> 42:28.457
Nobody makes any progress.

42:31.197 --> 42:33.318
One more time for the cheap seats.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.539
What did she say?

42:36.339 --> 42:39.400
What did she say on the Joe Rogan show?

42:39.480 --> 42:40.380
What did she say?

42:42.025 --> 42:45.632
Have there been any instances where vaccines have been helpful?

42:47.576 --> 42:49.340
The question of the century, isn't it?

42:49.641 --> 42:52.146
Okay, now, we have to back up a minute because

42:52.870 --> 42:55.832
I had that same question, and I had to go dig deep.

42:55.892 --> 42:58.875
All the questions you have in your head right now, I had them too at one point.

42:59.455 --> 43:12.005
So here I am, a medical doctor, working in the field, believing in pretty much everything I was told, giving hundreds if not thousands of vaccines out to my patients, hepatitis B vaccines in particular, flu shots for sure.

43:12.666 --> 43:16.509
I was a nephrologist, kidney specialist, and dialysis, et cetera.

43:19.716 --> 43:22.657
Initially, we all kind of have an aversion to needles.

43:22.697 --> 43:24.138
I think it's a natural human aversion.

43:24.158 --> 43:26.719
Some of our kids, no one's going, oh, I want to go get my vaccines.

43:26.739 --> 43:29.540
We're like, OK, fine, sore arm, you get over it.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.381
Most of us were lucky enough to get over it.

43:33.282 --> 43:45.427
So by the time the first instance of a problem occurred in front of my eyes, I was already a fully seasoned professor of medicine, working in a tertiary care medical center.

43:45.667 --> 43:48.989
So she was quite equivalent professionally to Tony Bark.

43:50.256 --> 43:56.540
And they need someone like that because as I detailed earlier, Tony Bark didn't just have some resume as a doctor.

43:58.101 --> 44:06.025
Tony Bark was the attending physician at the ER that sits right next to Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.

44:06.105 --> 44:12.169
Cook County Hospital is the hospital that they modeled the original ER show after, you know, with George Clooney.

44:14.230 --> 44:16.151
Shit gets real there all the time.

44:18.513 --> 44:21.174
And so Tony Bark didn't just have a resume.

44:21.214 --> 44:39.422
She had an impeccable resume, one that could have served as HHS secretary, one that could have served as the head of the CDC or the head of the FDA or any post anywhere at any university because she already was holding one of the most prestigious working posts in medicine.

44:42.543 --> 44:45.965
The attending at an ER is not a game show host.

44:46.940 --> 44:51.102
You don't get away with faking it until you make it when you are the head of an ER.

44:52.002 --> 45:02.688
I get chills in my spine right now thinking about somebody attaining that level of professionalism, that level of skill, that level of knowledge, that level of everything.

45:05.209 --> 45:12.993
There might be 200 Americans that could fit in three buses that qualify for as cool as that woman is or was.

45:14.878 --> 45:35.559
So how the hell are they gonna replace Tony Bark and somebody like Brandy Vaughn, who, despite being just a pharmaceutical rep, was witness to one of the biggest pharmaceutical crimes in the 20th century and a witness to it that spoke out with an unvaccinated kid who loved Tony Bark like her mom.

45:37.659 --> 45:45.725
What a disaster if you're somebody who, I don't know, wants to become known for being this health freedom movement leader.

45:46.586 --> 45:49.228
How are we going to orchestrate that with these two characters around?

45:49.268 --> 45:51.870
Well, we need somebody to step in front.

45:51.890 --> 45:54.391
Okay.

45:54.992 --> 46:00.076
And so it's been a bit of a process because for me, it was the influenza vaccines in 2008, 2009,

46:02.310 --> 46:08.335
showed me, without a doubt, that vaccines can and do cause kidney failure and put people on dialysis, that that does happen.

46:08.636 --> 46:10.037
It can cause hypertension.

46:10.457 --> 46:13.780
So we're not told to take a vaccine history in medical school.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.181
We're not told to even look there.

46:15.462 --> 46:17.523
It's not even part of, especially in adults.

46:17.844 --> 46:22.668
But when I did start looking there, I started to see more and more associations, let's just put it that way.

46:23.068 --> 46:26.291
And so first I had to go down the flu vaccine bunny trail.

46:26.411 --> 46:28.552
Thinking about good ones is not the way to go.

46:28.892 --> 46:29.893
You are the good ones.

46:30.013 --> 46:30.973
We are the good ones.

46:31.033 --> 46:32.614
That's all we can do is be them.

46:34.135 --> 46:36.316
We have to change people's mind one at a time.

46:36.356 --> 46:42.318
There are no people on social media with a million followers that aren't there by design and programming.

46:42.979 --> 46:45.220
That haven't passed any number of auditions.

46:47.025 --> 46:48.146
That's the reality of it.

46:48.627 --> 46:53.331
If you want something else other than that on the internet, you're going to have to build it yourself.

46:53.411 --> 46:56.274
You're going to have to donate to my work, donate to Mark's work.

46:56.794 --> 47:11.048
You're going to have to support the work that you want to see on the internet because right now the internet and the ads and the algorithms all support the things that the military industrial complex needs to be on there so that our citizens can be fractured.

47:12.088 --> 47:25.892
so that our real communities can be fractured into fake communities on the internet that can then be scattered into the wind as the United States is controlled, demolished from within by people with more than one passport.

47:27.112 --> 47:28.633
This woman is not a hero.

47:28.673 --> 47:35.835
There's no possible way that she could not be only ashamed of herself for not having accomplished anything after all this time.

47:37.415 --> 47:40.776
And every time I went down that flu vaccine bunny trail, guess what I was asked?

47:41.724 --> 47:42.665
What about polio?

47:43.666 --> 47:49.991
So I thought, all right, even though this has absolutely zero to do with polio, because I'm watching people crap out in front of me after.

47:50.071 --> 48:06.765
So we still don't have an answer to have there been any good vaccines, no answer, no short answer, which if you had spent the last 15 years trying to get the message out, you would probably start with the short answer on Joe fricking Rogan.

48:08.991 --> 48:11.032
influenza vaccines, let's see about polio.

48:11.572 --> 48:22.836
Because I knew very little about polio, just like most people walking around out there do, that it was invented by this guy named Jonas Salk, and it saved humanity, and we don't see these little crippled kids anymore, we don't have iron lungs anymore, yay.

48:24.657 --> 48:29.739
Well, I would have to say that the polio bunny trail was the darkest one of all.

48:30.854 --> 48:34.255
And so after polio, then became smallpox.

48:34.275 --> 48:38.896
And I thought, you know, we still have people walking the earth that have experienced the polio years.

48:39.036 --> 48:47.438
So I kind of like to stick to polio because most of the smallpox, you know, people that would have been familiar with it are off the planet.

48:47.458 --> 48:52.499
But there's still some doctors around that'll talk about smallpox, like a guy named Thomas Mack, who's probably close to me.

48:52.539 --> 48:54.420
I got all kinds of books on the shelf over there.

48:55.151 --> 48:57.996
right behind the camera, that talk about smallpox.

48:58.036 --> 49:02.926
And the funny thing is, is that none of those, none of those books talk about smallpox killing people.

49:04.611 --> 49:05.631
It's so weird.

49:05.832 --> 49:07.492
They talk about disfigurement.

49:08.093 --> 49:09.753
They talk about how to avoid that.

49:09.893 --> 49:15.796
They, you know, it's unfortunate and blah, blah, blah, but you don't, it's not like number one outcome death.

49:16.016 --> 49:16.236
No.

49:17.077 --> 49:21.339
Um, you know, it doesn't say like, wow, it killed this many people in this many years.

49:21.439 --> 49:25.360
There's nothing like that in any of the historical textbooks that I have.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.501
And I have a lot of them now.

49:28.902 --> 49:33.344
I don't know how to explain that, but I know it doesn't jive with,

49:34.730 --> 49:42.033
The idea that smallpox was ravaging the world and that people were dying everywhere and that the vaccine stopped that.

49:43.833 --> 49:46.274
But she doesn't seem to want to question that at all.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.215
Doesn't seem to be interested.

49:48.755 --> 49:52.617
Even though she apparently has a book and a co-author and they did research.

49:53.377 --> 49:54.738
I guess they didn't buy any books.

49:56.518 --> 49:58.239
I guess they didn't buy any books on eBay.

50:00.646 --> 50:05.951
They just have a couple of graphs that show that, you know, sanitation and water, that dad did stuff too.

50:06.912 --> 50:08.974
But they didn't actually do any research.

50:09.334 --> 50:12.477
They just basically published the script they were given.

50:12.517 --> 50:13.838
That's why there's two authors.

50:17.302 --> 50:18.623
It's not her life's work.

50:20.405 --> 50:24.749
It's not her, what she was put on earth to do, like Brandy would have said.

50:27.608 --> 50:30.231
Like I say to my kids every night, like, I don't know what to tell you, man.

50:30.732 --> 50:32.094
I don't have any other choice.

50:35.518 --> 50:36.640
Papa's got to figure this out.

50:38.682 --> 50:44.590
So that my kids inherit a world that's real and my kids grow up in America still free.

50:46.893 --> 50:53.395
90 who was kind of ground zero in the 1940s and knows a lot about it and still says we shouldn't be vaccinating for smallpox today.

50:54.755 --> 51:02.017
So then there was that and then everyone and their dog was talking about autism and I didn't really want to have anything to do with autism because I was an adult doctor.

51:02.057 --> 51:03.997
I think we should break down step by step.

51:04.137 --> 51:06.498
She didn't want anything to do with autism.

51:06.578 --> 51:07.558
Isn't that weird?

51:08.737 --> 51:16.999
It's almost like she knows that autism has nothing to do with intramuscular injection, except for, you know, just the fact that kids can be neurologically damaged.

51:17.059 --> 51:20.660
And she probably knows the truth like Brian Hooker in 2013 did.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.041
I didn't want anything to do with autism.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.261
Sounds a lot like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'

51:25.241 --> 51:25.741
's story.

51:27.001 --> 51:28.822
Dap, like, what about polio?

51:28.862 --> 51:29.082
Yeah.

51:29.122 --> 51:30.562
Because you said polio.

51:30.682 --> 51:33.023
Once we've breached that, because that's the big one.

51:33.243 --> 51:33.423
Yeah.

51:33.483 --> 51:33.603
Right.

51:33.623 --> 51:34.983
This is the one that everybody points to.

51:35.043 --> 51:35.904
We don't have crippled kids.

51:36.104 --> 51:36.264
Yeah.

51:38.308 --> 51:48.896
When you look at the historical timeline of polio, just so you're watching and be aware, the choppy connection is the PowerPoint not playing this video very well.

51:48.936 --> 51:54.080
I don't know why it's doing that, but it's, I think me and my voice is probably not choppy.

51:54.121 --> 51:54.961
It's just this video.

51:55.321 --> 52:00.826
What do you think caused it to go, to essentially not be a problem anymore?

52:01.346 --> 52:01.666
Okay.

52:02.547 --> 52:04.709
You don't think vaccinations had anything to do with that?

52:05.290 --> 52:08.474
Well, I also it's not what I think, because that's the thing.

52:08.534 --> 52:13.661
Like, look, when I got into this, I didn't say, oh, you know, I want to argue that vaccines are great.

52:13.701 --> 52:14.582
I said, look, I don't care.

52:14.622 --> 52:15.984
I didn't have skin in the game.

52:16.084 --> 52:17.546
I didn't have vaccine injured kids.

52:17.646 --> 52:21.911
I couldn't have cared less about it, essentially, except that it was something in front of me and didn't make sense.

52:21.951 --> 52:22.412
So I thought.

52:22.742 --> 52:25.264
Wherever the truth falls, that's what I'm going to talk about.

52:25.304 --> 52:31.207
So what I say is that what the facts line up to show you is that polio is still here.

52:31.267 --> 52:32.728
Polio is still alive and well.

52:33.048 --> 52:37.071
Polio is called different things today, whereas back in the 1940s, 1950s,

52:39.913 --> 52:44.897
The criteria for diagnosing polio were completely different to the year that the vaccine was introduced.

52:45.598 --> 52:55.267
The playing field, the goalposts, everything was changed so that despite the fact that there was more paralytic polio in the years after that vaccine was introduced, they were able to show a

52:55.680 --> 53:03.321
complete cascading drop of paralytic polio simply because of the way they changed the definitions of what polio is and what could cause it.

53:03.341 --> 53:06.982
And they started testing for the virus, where before they would never test for the virus.

53:07.582 --> 53:23.905
And when they started testing for the virus later, what they would find that people had Guillain-Barre syndrome, they didn't have virus, or they had Coxsackie virus or Echovirus, or they were lead poisoned or mercury poisoned, which was the mercury and lead were the leading treatments of the day, including blood letting.

53:24.645 --> 53:28.027
They were telling people to take your cigarette and put a little bit of arsenic in there.

53:28.047 --> 53:28.908
It's good for your lungs.

53:29.608 --> 53:30.048
Yeah.

53:30.629 --> 53:32.870
They were literally blowing smoke up people's butts.

53:32.930 --> 53:34.671
That's where the term comes from.

53:35.011 --> 53:37.853
If you want to Google that now, you'll see that there's an instrument that does it.

53:38.774 --> 53:47.179
Now, it's not that funny if you realize that blowing smoke up people's butts is applying nicotine to their blood instantly.

53:48.100 --> 53:53.483
Just like when you do a wine enema, you get drunk really fast because it goes right to your bloodstream.

53:55.529 --> 54:04.673
Now the weird shit about this is, is that not a few weeks after this exact interview, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

54:04.733 --> 54:11.996
and Joe Rogan and all these people started using tobacco pouches, even Tucker Carlson.

54:12.016 --> 54:25.141
And of course, you know that Brian Hooker was on stage with Brian Artis, the guy who's now going around telling everybody that nicotine can cure Parkinson's disease and that they put venom in the shot

54:26.482 --> 54:37.406
I mean, this is all one malevolent show, full of malevolent liars that are acting on stage exactly how Marlboro Malone described it.

54:37.486 --> 54:44.329
These are trained professionals that are psychologically manipulating their audiences.

54:44.569 --> 54:50.331
And Joe Rogan could be an unwitting pot smoking participant in this elaborate illusion.

54:50.371 --> 54:51.612
I'm totally okay with that.

54:53.726 --> 54:57.049
He's just engaged in what is called the look away doctrine.

54:57.089 --> 54:59.071
You know, he knows that he's being used.

54:59.111 --> 54:59.932
He doesn't give a shit.

54:59.952 --> 55:01.953
He gets $150 million a year.

55:09.761 --> 55:11.582
So is she going to answer the question or not?

55:11.622 --> 55:13.304
Are there any good vaccines or not?

55:13.344 --> 55:19.009
Because parents, you know, that are trying to figure it out are listening to Joe Rogan and they still need an answer.

55:19.754 --> 55:24.578
So, Leah, the polio story, where to even begin?

55:24.598 --> 55:26.860
And so there's about 70 pages.

55:26.920 --> 55:28.821
And so that became my obsession.

55:28.921 --> 55:30.863
So when people said, what about polio?

55:30.883 --> 55:31.503
And I started digging.

55:31.523 --> 55:44.113
There are about 70 pages in her book from 2013 that she's still selling on Joe Rogan in 2025, which means her narrative hasn't progressed at all.

55:47.472 --> 55:52.976
Since the book, she has learned nothing more about the polio narrative.

55:56.038 --> 56:05.304
She specifically referred to the number of pages that's in her 2013 book as the current status of her understanding.

56:05.344 --> 56:06.645
So she's gonna explain it.

56:10.008 --> 56:13.010
This is one of the most malevolent frauds in America.

56:14.088 --> 56:14.749
It's gross.

56:15.209 --> 56:16.831
Getting this up, I went deep into it.

56:16.891 --> 56:19.113
Did you dive into pesticides?

56:19.473 --> 56:28.903
Yes, yes, you have to dive into pesticides because the tonnage of production of DDT absolutely mirrored the diagnosis for polio in the days.

56:28.963 --> 56:34.268
And the countries that still make DDT today is where we're still seeing this paralytic polio situation happen.

56:34.728 --> 56:38.392
And also, weren't the first cases, did they break out in a rural community?

56:39.485 --> 56:40.785
The first cases of polio, yes.

56:40.825 --> 56:42.246
In the United States, paralytic polio.

56:42.286 --> 56:43.526
Yes, it was out in the countryside.

56:43.546 --> 56:46.346
Well, and that was probably more because of the sheep and cow dipping.

56:46.726 --> 56:48.587
So arsenic, you'd have to look at arsenic.

56:48.627 --> 56:49.827
You have to look at the mercurials.

56:49.847 --> 56:53.668
You have to look at the calcium arsenate, lead arsenate sprays that were put on trees.

56:53.728 --> 56:55.748
But what you're talking about in particular, they were called.

56:55.768 --> 57:08.391
So after all this discussion, we still have not honed in on the fact that intramuscular injection is very different than inhaling something or being exposed to it on your skin or ingesting it into your,

57:09.091 --> 57:11.972
digestive tract or even blowing it up your ass.

57:14.774 --> 57:38.144
These people are on a malevolent script most likely curated by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan and it was a long time ago put in order and in place to try and hijack the anticipated resistance to the transition to transfection.

57:39.471 --> 57:47.267
And so the pandemic was designed and scripted to make sure that everybody on any side of the narrative accepted

57:48.243 --> 58:05.011
wholesale, the use of PCR as a diagnostic, the use of sequencing as a evolutionary phylogenetic tool, and the use of transfection as a viable means of immunizing someone against one of these novel pathogens.

58:05.051 --> 58:07.532
So you accept the novel pathogen as well.

58:07.572 --> 58:09.593
Those four things were now

58:10.573 --> 58:17.902
settled in everyone's mind, all of your neighbors, probably all your family and friends, cannot explain why those things are not true.

58:18.383 --> 58:28.675
And that's an incredibly dangerous place for us to be, and she in no way, shape, or form is sending a lifeline, dropping a lifeline down to people to try and get them out of that narrative.

58:28.775 --> 58:29.376
Furthermore,

58:30.774 --> 58:38.557
She is clouding the water further by telling you that it could be pesticides and it could be mercurials that are sprayed around.

58:38.617 --> 58:46.899
And she uses all these terms that seem to imply there's a whole family of things you need to be worried about over here and a whole family of things you need to be worried about over here.

58:47.359 --> 58:51.721
And this whole clip starts with Joe Rogan with a very simple stoner like question.

58:52.121 --> 58:58.383
Hey, so, so man, do you think there are any good vaccines at all, dude?

59:00.219 --> 59:01.840
and this is where she is right now.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.100
That's how far she got.

59:03.340 --> 59:10.483
All the cow disease, they'll go out and the family, when you would go to the house, they'd say, all the kids have the cow disease, what the cows had before.

59:10.503 --> 59:11.283
Well, what were they doing?

59:11.303 --> 59:12.384
They would have this trenches.

59:12.424 --> 59:14.325
You talk to farmers even today.

59:14.705 --> 59:15.645
Oh yeah, we had trenches.

59:15.665 --> 59:18.866
We would just walk them straight through and I'd be soaked with this stuff by the end of the day.

59:18.886 --> 59:19.767
Oh my God.

59:20.027 --> 59:20.787
Yeah.

59:20.847 --> 59:24.289
And so the research that she's done is talk to farmers about it.

59:24.349 --> 59:27.610
She hasn't bothered to get any medical textbooks

59:28.826 --> 59:37.135
And start to build a timeline about how people talked about smallpox, how they treated it, how they described vaccination to it.

59:38.977 --> 59:40.399
But GigaOM Biological has.

59:41.720 --> 59:47.246
I've shown them on the screen before, I've shown them on the stream before, I've read them out loud before, they're going in the book.

59:50.336 --> 01:00:02.540
There's no other way to take an entry in a medical encyclopedia from 1920 which describes smallpox and what it is and what it can result in and never uses the word death once.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.121
It's just not possible.

01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:11.683
There are no statistics on the number of people that die from it or its survival rate because there is no

01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:20.184
There is no truth about smallpox in this silly story that she's telling on Joe Rogan.

01:00:20.224 --> 01:00:26.788
There is no truth with regard to these pesticides and these, you know, these are all myths.

01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:40.516
They are the same myth that the polio vaccine sits inside of, because again, remember, in order for this myth to work, the counter myth has to be partly, has to be believable as well.

01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:45.995
You can't have truth on this side and falseness on this side.

01:00:46.015 --> 01:00:47.316
You have truth on both sides.

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:49.456
And that's why it's a circle.

01:00:49.676 --> 01:00:54.058
That's why you get stuck in it like a motorcycle in a giant sphere of death.

01:00:56.579 --> 01:00:57.479
You can't get out.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.900
These people are in performance mode.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.161
They are reading a script.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:08.341
It could be that Joe Rogan has the script in front of him so he can keep bouncing shit off of her.

01:01:08.361 --> 01:01:13.085
And it seems like, wow, these people are, it's like they're, this is the greatest conversation ever.

01:01:15.226 --> 01:01:17.068
Suddenly I want to buy Italian pasta.

01:01:17.468 --> 01:01:24.913
They're basically soaking and bathing in arsenic, which is great for killing fleas and ticks, but it's not really great for keeping your nervous system.

01:01:25.273 --> 01:01:25.934
Whoa.

01:01:27.735 --> 01:01:28.796
No way.

01:01:30.345 --> 01:01:36.607
happy because the fact of the matter is, and this again, I've got medical references, everything, I can't get away with making stuff up, okay?

01:01:37.148 --> 01:01:48.432
I have to put a reference for everything, but arsenic causes the exact same spinal pathology that, and fevers and everything, it literally mimics what they were calling polio and a polio virus back in the day.

01:01:50.157 --> 01:01:54.279
I read this crazy statistic and I still can't believe it's real.

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:56.721
She still hasn't said, are there any good vaccines?

01:01:56.881 --> 01:02:02.784
She still has not explained to you that it goes against all of the biology of our body.

01:02:02.924 --> 01:02:13.230
She still hasn't explained to you that even if you want to consider it, just consider the difference between injecting something in the muscle and inhalation or ingestion or exposure.

01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:15.763
No, we're not there yet.

01:02:15.943 --> 01:02:16.844
We're still not there.

01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:26.873
This is a person who's been waiting for the chance to give the elevator pitch on vaccines for, I guess, at least 15 years.

01:02:28.174 --> 01:02:32.798
Five to 99% of all polio is asymptomatic.

01:02:33.473 --> 01:02:37.135
That's exactly right, so polio virus is what we think.

01:02:37.155 --> 01:02:52.182
So now we have all these asymptomatic signals, including what, that's James Lyons-Weiler in 2019 saying that vaccine-preventable diseases are spreading asymptomatically among the vaccinated because our current vaccines are pretty shitty.

01:02:53.343 --> 01:02:59.866
She's now telling you, because Joe Rogan says, that polio spreads almost exclusively asymptomatically.

01:03:00.947 --> 01:03:05.908
And so we have to be worried about things that only their diagnostics can show you.

01:03:06.388 --> 01:03:10.269
Only their PCR tests could find and track and sequence.

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:13.590
And these people are in no way objecting to that at all.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:21.251
They accept that just like they accept the novel virus because they are on script.

01:03:23.411 --> 01:03:28.072
Commensal, just like you have staph on your skin and strep on your skin and it actually serves a purpose.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:30.853
It keeps other microbes in check as long as you don't get a cut.

01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:34.444
and have not a good immune system to deal from the inside out.

01:03:34.484 --> 01:03:40.967
So polio, the reason I can say that polio is a commensal is because again, there are medical studies that showed that.

01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:42.108
A commensal.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:48.791
See, she's already confusing the listeners another step when reality, what she should have said is they're symbiotic.

01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:49.952
They're present in everybody.

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:52.593
We have a symbiotic relationship with them.

01:03:53.874 --> 01:03:58.737
Breaching the barrier of our gut or breaching the barrier of our skin is a problem.

01:03:58.757 --> 01:04:01.879
Of course it's a problem, but we have a symbiosis with them.

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:05.781
We interact with them and our immune system is how we do that.

01:04:05.921 --> 01:04:08.703
So again, it's the lack of specificity.

01:04:08.863 --> 01:04:16.688
It's the affirmation of the already bullshit narratives that are in Mary's Monkey and these other stupid books that he's probably

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:21.070
at least, you know, listen to the audio while he was in his ice tub.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:31.896
People who dared to get on the edge of some of these wild Native tribes down in South America or elsewhere, but in particular I'm talking about a South American tribe called the Javante Indians.

01:04:32.376 --> 01:04:39.900
So the Indian Health Service got to the edge of it and bargained that they would get some stool and some blood from the tribes so that they could test it for polio.

01:04:40.862 --> 01:04:50.448
And what they found was 98% to 99% of every person they tested, and it was hundreds of people, had evidence of immunity to all three strains of polio.

01:04:51.229 --> 01:04:53.550
And they said to them, well, where are your crippled children?

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:54.571
Where's your short legs?

01:04:54.611 --> 01:04:56.392
Where are the people that died of respiratory failure?

01:04:56.412 --> 01:04:58.574
And they were like, we don't have any of that problem.

01:04:59.141 --> 01:05:01.062
Want to trade like the pros without being one?

01:05:01.562 --> 01:05:01.923
With P.U.

01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:02.763
Prime, you can.

01:05:02.783 --> 01:05:05.945
Whether you're into Forex, stocks, crypto, or commodities, P.U.

01:05:05.965 --> 01:05:11.328
Prime gives you access to 200 plus trading instruments, ultra low spreads, and lightning fast.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:23.436
And so after he makes a clip where she doesn't answer the question of are there any good vaccines at all, he sells you an app where you can trade crypto and other shit.

01:05:24.406 --> 01:05:38.952
Now, if there was a video of her saying it better when Brandy Vaughn and Tony Barker were still alive, and then she didn't say it that way on Joe Rogan, would you believe that she's a liar?

01:05:40.352 --> 01:05:41.853
Would it expose her for you?

01:05:43.382 --> 01:05:55.150
I sure hope that if I show you a video from when Brandy was alive, when Tony was alive, and she says it right, you will see that what she said on Joe Rogan is nothing but scripted bullshit.

01:05:55.190 --> 01:06:00.354
What she's been saying since Tony Bark and Brandy Vaughn died is scripted bullshit.

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:02.715
Just like Brian Hooker.

01:06:03.175 --> 01:06:03.716
Just like

01:06:05.037 --> 01:06:08.139
Mary Holland and just like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:08.239 --> 01:06:09.080
And you can see it.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:14.524
And more importantly, the other side of America can see that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:14.564 --> 01:06:18.426
has always been on a shitty script that he did not understand.

01:06:18.847 --> 01:06:20.488
And now he's floundering with it.

01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:24.290
They are claiming that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:26.132
is writing reports with AI.

01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:29.334
That's why there are incorrect citations in it.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.501
Do you see what they're doing?

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.102
Do you see the trap we walked into?

01:06:33.142 --> 01:06:34.723
The trap that she helped set?

01:06:35.343 --> 01:06:37.224
That she stood in front of Brandy Vaughn?

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:39.646
Now there better not be a video where she says it better.

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:45.098
I say there better not be a video where she says it better.

01:06:45.118 --> 01:06:48.439
My current opinion about vaccinations is that they have never been safe.

01:06:49.159 --> 01:06:50.800
Never has there been a safe vaccine.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.220
Never will there be a safe vaccine.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.821
And it is not possible to have a safe vaccine.

01:06:56.361 --> 01:07:04.484
The reasoning for that is that the actual process of vaccination defies the natural function of the immune system.

01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:06.548
of living beings.

01:07:07.508 --> 01:07:18.356
It thwarts the immune system into a balance that's very unnatural and that leaves it susceptible to more things than just what you may be vaccinated supposedly for.

01:07:18.696 --> 01:07:25.481
Putting a disease matter into a body and thinking that the manner of which it's going in, i.e.

01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:32.386
usually through a muscle, through the skin, using a very unnatural thing, a needle,

01:07:33.606 --> 01:07:36.067
combined with all the chemicals and antibiotics.

01:07:36.367 --> 01:07:39.429
I'm sorry, why wouldn't she say this on Joe Rogan?

01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:45.952
Why did she open the stream with Joe Rogan about cinnamon being vitamin C rich?

01:07:48.933 --> 01:07:59.898
If you don't want to take away all the money that she has for all the books she sold, if you don't want to take away all the likes that you gave to her tweets,

01:08:01.004 --> 01:08:06.028
If you don't want to take away all the nice things that you said about her now, I can't help you.

01:08:07.729 --> 01:08:09.350
Because this is all it's about.

01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:16.076
All it is about is realizing that Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark could say it exactly right.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:41.971
that there was never a safe vaccine, that vaccines are just dumb, they're antithetical to our biology, which is how I was saying it when I met Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when Charles Rixey came to my house, how I was saying it when Kevin McCarran came to Pittsburgh, how I was saying it when Addie Adds came to Pittsburgh, how I was saying it when Paul Alexander came to my house, how I was saying it for years, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:43.272 --> 01:08:46.617
Since the end of 2021, I've been basically saying it like this.

01:08:50.644 --> 01:08:56.293
And this woman is part of an elaborate hoax called a health freedom movement.

01:08:57.096 --> 01:08:58.617
These people have been put in place.

01:08:59.298 --> 01:09:06.564
They murdered people like Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark to get themselves into positions of influence.

01:09:06.804 --> 01:09:14.731
And then people like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk and Donald Trump and Gavin DeBecker and

01:09:16.272 --> 01:09:44.058
and Steve Bannon and all these people used these people to promote Robert F. Kennedy as close to the White House as they could get him so that the FDA could essentially be usurped or neutered so that the progress toward sequencing every baby in America and collecting as much medical data as possible that we could make progress to that final stage of the experiment.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:53.545
And so the people would accept PCR and viral sequencing and gain of function and the mythology of pandemics.

01:09:53.645 --> 01:10:15.482
She is part of the same team of liars, which has ultimately brought Robert Malone to the ACIP, has brought Jay Bhattacharya to the NIH, has brought Marty Makary to the top of the FDA, has brought Vinayak Prasad to the top of Center for Biological Evaluations and Research.

01:10:16.829 --> 01:10:21.514
And America's government is being undermined from the inside by these traitors.

01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:39.211
And America's popular movement among parents and among young people and among Christians is being perverted and twisted by liars who know how to say it and are not saying it because they are being paid not to say it.

01:10:42.918 --> 01:10:44.380
And I mean Mary Holland.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.822
I mean Brian Hooker.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.064
I mean Suzanne Humphries.

01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:51.909
I mean them all because they are all not saying it anymore.

01:10:51.949 --> 01:10:58.316
There's no explanation for this video to exist other than she is a liar.

01:10:59.838 --> 01:11:01.180
This is a liar.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:08.611
My current opinion about vaccinations is that they have never been safe.

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:10.952
Never has there been a safe vaccine.

01:11:11.592 --> 01:11:13.373
Never will there be a safe vaccine.

01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:15.994
And it is not possible to have a safe vaccine.

01:11:16.514 --> 01:11:24.638
The reasoning for that is that the actual process of vaccination defies the natural function of the immune system.

01:11:25.683 --> 01:11:26.684
of living beings.

01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:37.493
It thwarts the immune system into a balance that's very unnatural and that leaves it susceptible to more things than just what you've maybe vaccinated.

01:11:37.513 --> 01:11:46.101
So in the 10 minutes that we listened to the Joe Rogan podcast where he actually asked her, have there been any good vaccines?

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.323
She did not answer

01:11:49.918 --> 01:11:55.941
like Suzanne Humphries of 2018, like Brandy Vaughn of 2018, like Tony Bark of 2018.

01:11:56.922 --> 01:11:58.363
She didn't answer like them.

01:11:59.664 --> 01:12:01.865
She didn't answer like Brian Hooker of 2013.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:08.969
No, she gave a long convoluted answer that actually did not address the question.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.471
and it makes her a traitor to our grandchildren.

01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.492
She cannot be seen any other way.

01:12:14.592 --> 01:12:23.575
I cannot, there is no possible way for me to have just stolen a special clip because this is too important.

01:12:24.395 --> 01:12:26.476
Kids are vaccinated every day.

01:12:27.456 --> 01:12:30.797
Doctors are perpetuating this myth every day.

01:12:30.837 --> 01:12:34.479
The pandemic myth is perpetuating the same mythology.

01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:37.520
And instead of using that opportunity

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:47.451
pulling out a samurai sword that she had been sharpening for 15 years and cutting that melon right in half in front of Joe Rogan and having him go, damn.

01:12:49.413 --> 01:12:52.855
She blew it for two and a half fricking hours.

01:12:52.955 --> 01:12:58.700
She blew it talking about tribes and Amazons and, and, and, and cinnamon.

01:13:01.887 --> 01:13:02.768
supposedly for.

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:09.893
Putting a disease matter into a body and thinking that the manner of which it's going in, i.e.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:31.267
usually through a muscle, through the skin, using a very unnatural thing, a needle, combined with all the chemicals and antibiotics and things that the manufacturing companies may not even know about at the time that they're being injected into a muscle, there's no possible way that that can be safe.

01:13:32.267 --> 01:13:50.971
Now, when you're bypassing the normal immune system by putting this disease matter into a muscle, you are stimulating yet another abnormal response at the site of the injection, pooling of all sorts of metals and things that call in the immune cells in this very unnatural way.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:14:01.053
And the result that these manufacturers or designers of vaccines often look for is simply an antibody, which is one small thing in the

01:14:04.118 --> 01:14:06.241
Ladies and gentlemen, she is a scripted liar.

01:14:07.023 --> 01:14:12.352
She's a scripted liar like he and he and Marty are scripted liars.

01:14:12.392 --> 01:14:14.376
They're all scripted bullshitters.

01:14:15.405 --> 01:14:25.710
on a scripted bullshit script, probably written by Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan largely, and developed on their podcasts over the five or six years of the pandemic.

01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:29.512
There's not many things more dishonorable than what these people are doing.

01:14:29.972 --> 01:14:39.637
There's not many more Americans more dishonorable than the fake health freedom movement of Robert Malone and Mary Holland and Brian Hooker.

01:14:40.595 --> 01:14:44.717
It is absolutely the worst kind of human behavior.

01:14:45.377 --> 01:14:53.761
These people are actually lessers because these are just people that are interested in the post, interested in progression up the ladder that they imagine they're on.

01:14:54.622 --> 01:15:00.905
They see themselves at some higher paid position in a few years and only that matters to them, their name on a door.

01:15:01.345 --> 01:15:03.586
But there are people that are more malevolent than that.

01:15:04.963 --> 01:15:14.774
And those are the people that I've had run-ins with because they are the ones that are willing to lie and spread these bad ideas that are much more dangerous than any spread of an RNA molecule.

01:15:15.235 --> 01:15:16.936
Thank you very much for being here.

01:15:16.957 --> 01:15:19.720
I'll be back in a few minutes with the second half of the show.

01:16:49.127 --> 01:16:49.288
you

01:19:27.755 --> 01:19:28.079
you

01:20:52.025 --> 01:20:52.774
Therefore it's not correct.

01:21:17.253 --> 01:21:22.847
That was Greg Howe, Victor Wooten, and Dennis Chambers on drums.

01:21:22.907 --> 01:21:26.135
Victor Wooten plays the bass and then Greg Howe on guitar.

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:30.512
It's Hal Wooten and Chambers.

01:21:32.613 --> 01:21:38.797
Dennis Chambers is one of my few drummers that I actually used to sort of fanboy about a little bit.

01:21:39.197 --> 01:21:54.225
Dennis Chambers has also made a number of albums with a guy by the name of Mike Stern who plays guitar from the Berklee School of Music, who I got into again because of my friend and former guitar teacher, Nathan, who is here at the bottom of the screen.

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.589
Right there is that yeah, that's that's him right there.

01:21:59.629 --> 01:22:24.626
That's me and him in October of 2023 and then about a month later he died of an extremely quick aneurysm very unsurprised very surprised a great guy left behind two incredibly talented daughters and a really fantastic woman as a mom and wife and partner and

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:44.992
It's still hard for me to imagine that that guy isn't with us anymore, but I know for sure that the reason why him and so many other Americans may never see the justice that they deserve, their families will never learn the truth, is because they are surrounded by, on social media, scripted bullshitters and no one

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:48.956
is going to spontaneously hear the message that I have to bring.

01:22:49.677 --> 01:23:02.992
None of these people that have absorbed what they can from me over the course of these five years will ever point to me again because they are involved in this controlled demolition of America.

01:23:03.032 --> 01:23:04.294
And I don't say that lightly.

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:05.415
I don't like to say that.

01:23:06.576 --> 01:23:25.125
I don't like to think that most of the parents of the kids at my boy's high school are wholly unaware and not even disturbed at the fact that a kid that went to our high school is supposedly responsible for an assassination attempt on the current president of the United States and we still don't know anything about him.

01:23:28.357 --> 01:23:30.319
Nobody cares because it's scripted bullshit.

01:23:30.379 --> 01:23:39.466
Although at the time of the shooting, Brett Weinstein for two and a half weeks was very concerned about how many other shooters might've been in Butler, Pennsylvania.

01:23:39.786 --> 01:23:48.372
He had no concern at all about how that young man was recruited or what social media got him there or what he was doing on the roof in the first place.

01:23:48.572 --> 01:23:51.615
Nah, that doesn't matter because there might've been more than one shooter.

01:23:52.015 --> 01:23:56.599
Let's talk to a former Oracle employee and probably agent of Team Robert Malone

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.244
John Cullen for three hours about it.

01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:05.628
It's all one shitty show that was behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.529
like a Trojan horse.

01:24:07.649 --> 01:24:15.774
And so I want to start out the second half with a little bit of a summary, put a little extra work in since it's only 1136.

01:24:17.455 --> 01:24:18.115
Welcome to the show.

01:24:18.135 --> 01:24:19.436
This is GigaOM Biological.

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:28.982
If you want to support this work, if you think what I'm doing is important, please go to GigaOMBiological.com and find a way to support the stream as little as $10 a month as a subscriber.

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:36.325
it would add up to more than enough very quickly if just, you know, a few people would decide to do it.

01:24:36.385 --> 01:24:55.813
Right now, it's like 110 people have decided to do it in the last six years, which I think should tell you something about how social media can be weaponized against somebody because there's no reasonable explanation for that when, quite frankly, GigaOM Biological is one of the best programs on the internet right now, maybe the best

01:24:56.613 --> 01:25:00.295
science news show that has ever existed on the internet.

01:25:00.455 --> 01:25:06.778
And maybe I'm one of the best biology coaches that's ever tried to make programming on the internet.

01:25:06.818 --> 01:25:19.985
So it's pretty remarkable that a multiracial, well-spoken, not white American is having a hard time rising in this world of, you know, all these people.

01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:22.967
I don't get it, but I don't care.

01:25:24.667 --> 01:25:25.248
I really don't.

01:25:26.215 --> 01:25:42.581
One of the reasons why I'm so lucky to be able to hijack Chief Woohoo and make him into JC on the hardwood is because of that ridiculous notion, the twisted bad biology and the brains of people that are broken within it.

01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:44.201
So I'm going to address a few of those things.

01:25:44.241 --> 01:25:48.583
But first, I want to just summarize where I think we are as far as the pandemic.

01:25:48.603 --> 01:25:49.523
This is a summary that

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:56.147
is a few three months old already, I think, that I tried to do one week just to see if I could do something for people.

01:25:57.028 --> 01:25:58.309
I meant to publish this somewhere.

01:25:58.369 --> 01:25:59.009
Maybe I didn't.

01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:01.411
I guess I probably didn't put it on a sub stack.

01:26:01.491 --> 01:26:19.284
Anyway, the first thing that you need to understand, especially with regard to Aaron Seery and the fake lawyer from Columbia University, Mary Holland, and the fake lawyer named Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Children's Health Defense pays a lot of money, both of them,

01:26:20.044 --> 01:26:31.235
They haven't really made any progress in educating Americans about the trap that they are in, even though they are lawyers, and apparently that should be their job, to kind of explain to parents what's going on.

01:26:31.275 --> 01:26:42.146
They've focused most of their time on mandates and not a lot of time on the fundamental problem of the PrEP Act, the fundamental problem of the National Vaccine Safety Act, or whatever the hell it was called.

01:26:43.348 --> 01:26:53.551
And the fundamental problem of those laws are that they allow the government to suspend fundamental rights without being held to strict scrutiny.

01:26:55.111 --> 01:27:04.874
And possibly that our due process rights are being violated in that regard because we are not allowed to sue for damages.

01:27:04.914 --> 01:27:08.495
And that's also a fundamental right codified in the Constitution.

01:27:10.044 --> 01:27:21.607
And that sits at the base of the, let's say, unconstitutionality of the vaccine schedule in America.

01:27:21.707 --> 01:27:38.431
And so if you were really worth your salt as a Columbia Law professor, and you really were burning your career as a Columbia Law professor to throw it all out there in order to save children from a vaccine schedule that you were sure injured your son,

01:27:39.958 --> 01:27:45.123
In the last 15 years, you would have certainly got to this point by now, but she didn't.

01:27:45.403 --> 01:27:46.724
And neither did Aaron Seery.

01:27:47.365 --> 01:27:49.266
And neither has Roy Flores.

01:27:49.526 --> 01:28:01.517
And neither has all of these people that are taking really nice salaries from this nonprofit with no actual brick and mortar location that you could go and protest or call or send a message to.

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:15.894
Children's Health Defense, the one that Paul Offit will say, and the PBS NewsHour will say, and everybody will say out loud, because they want Americans to go there, if they're going anywhere, to go there, because that's the trap.

01:28:16.694 --> 01:28:20.695
And those are people like ICANN who don't, simply can't say this.

01:28:27.498 --> 01:28:30.040
Yes, virology is a fraud, that is for sure.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:34.423
But the no virus narrative was a trap and it remains a trap.

01:28:35.244 --> 01:28:38.206
Because like PCR, PCR is not fake.

01:28:39.487 --> 01:28:41.128
PCR can work really well.

01:28:42.009 --> 01:28:46.432
Just like a skilled carpenter can make a really badass set of drawers.

01:28:48.408 --> 01:29:02.291
And a person who's lying could claim that they can make a really nice pair of drawers and that they know how, or a set of drawers, and they know how to make them and that their drawers slide just as well as the master carpenter, but that's, that would be bullshitting.

01:29:04.392 --> 01:29:17.695
And as I tried to explain at the beginning of the show, there is an irreducibly complex background of genetic signals that are composed almost exclusively of bacterial signals and bacteriophages, which,

01:29:19.156 --> 01:29:25.678
Up until this point in biology have been mischaracterized, in my humble opinion, as separate from bacteria.

01:29:25.738 --> 01:29:28.078
That bacteria are the victims of phages.

01:29:28.138 --> 01:29:33.219
That phages are evolving independently of the bacteria that they attack.

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.400
And this is the myth.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:43.262
This is the incorrect biology, the bad biology, that assumes that these signals are not part of us.

01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:47.772
that are not part of the bacteria that they infect.

01:29:47.973 --> 01:29:49.014
This is ridiculous.

01:29:50.435 --> 01:29:58.723
I think it's almost as ridiculous as saying that the leaves on the trees are parasitic and that's why they fall off every year.

01:30:00.385 --> 01:30:07.512
They are telling us a story at the microscopic level about trees they don't understand and telling us that when the leaves fall off,

01:30:08.462 --> 01:30:12.823
That's a sign that the tree is dying or that the tree has gotten rid of the parasites.

01:30:12.863 --> 01:30:15.044
But then next year, the parasites come back again.

01:30:19.745 --> 01:30:31.969
And the key thing to understand here is that metabiota and Nathan Wolf and metagenomic sequencing, metagenomic sequencing was invented by somebody who studies phages in coral reefs.

01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:33.309
Did you hear that?

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:42.028
Metagenomic sequencing was invented by a molecular biologist that was studying bacteriophages in coral reefs.

01:30:43.929 --> 01:30:46.551
Specifically, in the mucus of coral reefs.

01:30:48.932 --> 01:30:50.473
Reefs, I guess I should say.

01:30:50.753 --> 01:30:54.375
Reefs, not Chris Reeves, but coral reefs.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:58.838
Anyway, my pronunciation aside,

01:31:00.816 --> 01:31:25.339
That is the point in molecular biology where Nathan Wolf and the Gain of Function narrative and all these bullshitters funded by USAID step in and claim that that irreducibly complex background, that black, black, what do they call it, dark matter of biology is composed of viruses that attack us.

01:31:27.173 --> 01:31:31.896
instead of genetic signals that are a component of our bacterial background.

01:31:31.936 --> 01:31:34.678
You see the wrong biology and how far they went?

01:31:35.619 --> 01:31:41.923
They went so far as to produce two whole rows of books about that bad biology.

01:31:42.043 --> 01:31:43.224
Two rows of books.

01:31:43.945 --> 01:31:51.209
One of the favorite of which, for me now, is this book by Leonard Horowitz called Emerging Viruses.

01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:54.632
This book is a spectacular tome of bullshit.

01:31:56.357 --> 01:32:23.540
but it's exactly the same grift and joke as this book is from Nathan Wolf, where they're taking an irreducibly complex background, tools that were developed on that irreducibly complex background, and then misconstruing those tools' output as evidence of viruses that affect us, without making any effort to differentiate

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:34.208
the viruses that they say are pandemic potential from the irreducibly complex background from which the tools they use are derived.

01:32:38.277 --> 01:32:42.721
And so that's why none of these people have usefully questioned PCR.

01:32:42.741 --> 01:32:58.837
These no virus people have never usefully questioned the fact and been able to explain the fact that PCR can be used to a very high level of fidelity on the academic bench, but has never been used in that way as a diagnostic.

01:32:59.178 --> 01:33:02.121
And it would be such an easy thing for any of these people to explain.

01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:21.237
The least of which, the reasons, the least of which are that I have explained to them repeatedly, including Brett Weinstein and Alexandros Marinos and Chris Martinson and Heather Haying and Jumi Kim and Matt Crawford on Signal in 2021.

01:33:26.687 --> 01:33:35.036
And so RNA is a class of molecule without the requisite biological and chemical characteristics that would permit any kind of sustained spontaneous spread.

01:33:35.757 --> 01:33:41.142
This concept is antithetical to everything we have been taught about the unique biological chemistry of DNA.

01:33:42.734 --> 01:33:48.457
Only virology, primary literature makes claims otherwise, and those paper are all written by players.

01:33:48.517 --> 01:33:49.878
They are, it's just that simple.

01:33:50.438 --> 01:33:53.439
Without David Baltimore's work, this whole thing falls apart.

01:33:53.479 --> 01:34:02.544
Without Vincent Racaniello, the whole thing falls apart, because there's nobody else that can stand there and defend this mythology the way they can.

01:34:04.042 --> 01:34:08.026
And the best clues I have as a coach are look at remdesivir and who wrote about it.

01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:19.737
Look at remdesivir and what its molecular mechanism is and look up this gene and find out what its molecular mechanism is and who described it and how they're related and you will see.

01:34:21.004 --> 01:34:22.585
It's all just one bullshit show.

01:34:23.005 --> 01:34:34.071
The most amazing thing is, is that this gene is the only thing that Kevin McKernan brought up on a stream on the exact day, it is St.

01:34:34.111 --> 01:34:38.774
Patrick's Day, 2023, when Kevin McKernan, John Bodwin,

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:46.375
Jessica Rose, Stephanie Seneff, and myself did a stream together where I explained my theory about what was going on.

01:34:46.935 --> 01:34:50.017
And Jessica Rose said she thought that's exactly what happened.

01:34:50.557 --> 01:34:52.078
Stephanie Seneff said nothing.

01:34:52.598 --> 01:34:54.019
John Bodwin said nothing.

01:34:54.059 --> 01:34:56.621
And Kevin McKernan said, yeah, but XON.

01:34:57.601 --> 01:35:04.245
And in that video, then I rubbed his face in it like a little puppy that had just peed in the carpet.

01:35:05.426 --> 01:35:07.527
I mean, this dude lost.

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:15.936
And that was when everything snapped and he started to call me chemtrail retarded in dedicated substacks written to me.

01:35:15.996 --> 01:35:20.340
And then he had to block me on Twitter because it was all over at that point.

01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:23.712
He had been exposed.

01:35:23.792 --> 01:35:24.933
And what did they do then?

01:35:24.973 --> 01:35:35.781
They put him in 2024, a whole year later on a huge podcast called the Danny Jones podcast, where he lied about the fact that Charles Rixey helped Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:41.465
with his book, that Charles Rixey had the goods on the diffuse proposal, which is of course a bullshit lie.

01:35:41.865 --> 01:35:47.209
And part of the same narrative that Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan are curating.

01:35:49.448 --> 01:35:58.550
The reason why Charles Rixey came to my house in the first place was to get me to go on stream and say the defuse proposal was real and that I was a part of drastic that found it.

01:36:01.031 --> 01:36:03.992
With flattery, you know, like you're a genius.

01:36:04.052 --> 01:36:05.092
I just want to work with you.

01:36:05.512 --> 01:36:09.533
Exactly as Robert Maloney explained it to Del Bigtree.

01:36:10.813 --> 01:36:13.134
Because he's the one scripting these people.

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.742
And why are they scripting it is the question you have to ask yourself.

01:36:18.782 --> 01:36:19.822
Why would there be a script?

01:36:19.842 --> 01:36:21.163
Is it because they want to kill us?

01:36:21.283 --> 01:36:24.205
No, it's not because they want to kill us.

01:36:24.285 --> 01:36:28.227
It's because they want the PCR to be accepted.

01:36:28.287 --> 01:36:34.650
They want this medical remnant stream to be present for sequencing and they want the FDA to be neutralized.

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:41.374
The FDA is the only part of the executive branch, the only part of HHS would have any authority to look over these,

01:36:42.034 --> 01:36:45.135
these diagnostic tools and decide whether there was fraud.

01:36:45.496 --> 01:36:48.157
They're the only ones who could put their foot down and say, you know what?

01:36:48.697 --> 01:36:57.181
We're not regulating any of this diagnostic stuff and we better start regulating it because we let it all go wild during the pandemic, but we better rein it back in.

01:36:57.281 --> 01:37:05.705
Marty McCary's never going to say that because he is on a script from Robert Malone and Kevin McKernan to make sure that no one ever says that.

01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:10.852
because these remnant streams are a priority for the Human Genome Project.

01:37:10.892 --> 01:37:20.318
These methodologies to be accepted en masse so that we can be experimented on properly needs to happen, and that's why these people were put in place.

01:37:21.299 --> 01:37:25.322
And they definitely, it is a national security priority.

01:37:26.178 --> 01:37:33.244
and they will tell you that the old vaccine schedule was a one-size-fits-all and that doesn't really work and we know that now from the Human Genome Project.

01:37:33.644 --> 01:37:38.588
We're gonna have to sequence everybody and we're gonna have to make personalized medicine and personalized vaccines.

01:37:39.188 --> 01:37:41.630
And they need you to teach this to your grandchildren.

01:37:43.411 --> 01:37:47.114
Because this isn't about us, it's about the next generation of babies.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.696
They need it from birth to death.

01:37:49.356 --> 01:37:53.699
They need those babies wearing wearables so that we can practice collecting their data.

01:37:54.541 --> 01:37:56.699
before the population collapses on Earth.

01:38:00.725 --> 01:38:04.726
This year marks a decade since same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide.

01:38:04.766 --> 01:38:13.810
But in several Republican-led states, efforts are underway to ban pride flags from public schools and government buildings, sparking a wave of local resistance.

01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:15.630
Dima Zane has the story.

01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:26.614
As a biologist, I feel like it's kind of in my wheelhouse to be able to provide you a little quick out when somebody starts to argue about this stuff.

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:28.575
And it's a very easy, semantic out.

01:38:29.508 --> 01:38:31.629
And I don't know if I've said it before on the stream.

01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:34.811
I think I have, but it's a very easy semantic out.

01:38:34.991 --> 01:38:39.793
The only mistake we are making is allowing them to call trans men, trans women.

01:38:39.873 --> 01:38:40.713
That's it done.

01:38:40.793 --> 01:38:41.454
It's all over.

01:38:41.934 --> 01:38:52.479
And now you understand because if you were born with a penis and your chromosomes are X, Y, and you think that you're a woman trapped in a man's body.

01:38:53.407 --> 01:38:58.879
then you are a trans man because you are a man who wants to transition into a woman.

01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:01.685
You are never going to transition into a woman.

01:39:01.725 --> 01:39:03.930
You will always be a transitioning man.

01:39:04.946 --> 01:39:08.707
And I honestly think that when I was a kid, that's how that was used.

01:39:08.807 --> 01:39:13.168
I think they had to work really hard to flip that over.

01:39:13.429 --> 01:39:20.451
And at the start of the pandemic, I think they worked extra hard to flip that over to make sure that people weren't using it correctly.

01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:22.391
And that is the correct term.

01:39:22.971 --> 01:39:31.134
If this guy right here is in the process of becoming a woman, which he's free to do as far as I'm concerned, he would be a transitioning man.

01:39:32.014 --> 01:39:35.776
And he is a trans man and he will live the rest of his life as a trans man.

01:39:36.216 --> 01:39:38.937
And now we don't have this problem of what is a woman.

01:39:40.558 --> 01:39:49.101
Because we will be acknowledging with our language that a biological male can never actually fully transition into a biological female.

01:39:49.481 --> 01:39:53.683
He will always be a transitioning man in his mind and in reality.

01:39:58.885 --> 01:40:19.490
The other thing that I think is very important to understand with regard to the rainbow flag debate is to make sure that you see that more often than not, what is going to happen is that what would likely be a homosexual child is being absolutely physically mutilated and medically raped.

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:22.501
And we shouldn't want this.

01:40:23.081 --> 01:40:28.425
And more importantly, the older adults in our groups that are gay shouldn't want this.

01:40:28.485 --> 01:40:44.436
They should be able to see that if they were young and they were subject to the messaging campaigns and to the social media that these kids are, they might not have found their way safely to homosexuality and safely to the community and the friends and the love that they have in their life.

01:40:44.496 --> 01:40:46.077
They might not have found their way there.

01:40:47.588 --> 01:40:51.909
And so we as biologists need to be honest about that.

01:40:54.310 --> 01:41:03.873
We need to be honest about the fact that, you know, the rainbow flag, if it comes right down to it, comes down to a few very simple things about penises.

01:41:04.513 --> 01:41:10.855
Either you have one and you prefer that one, or you don't have one and you would like to, you know,

01:41:11.573 --> 01:41:23.541
interact with other people's penises, or you're really mad that you don't have one and you're going to force the issue by putting one on yourself, or you have one and you're mad that you have one and you want it removed.

01:41:25.302 --> 01:41:33.908
But in reality, flying that flag means that for whatever reason, you want everybody to know that your opinion about dick is important.

01:41:34.744 --> 01:41:42.309
Your preference for, preference against, your preference for your own or that of others is important.

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:45.751
So important that your flag you fly signifies it.

01:41:47.012 --> 01:41:48.493
That's what that flag means.

01:41:48.553 --> 01:42:01.040
That flag does not simply signify inclusion for people who believe in flat earth or people who believe in one Christian God or another Christian God or who are Buddhist or who are agnostic.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.522
This is specifically about unity

01:42:04.605 --> 01:42:07.706
for the appreciation of having or not having a dick.

01:42:07.946 --> 01:42:08.606
That's it.

01:42:09.226 --> 01:42:13.927
And you want one, or you wish you had one, or goodness sakes, I gotta get rid of it.

01:42:15.327 --> 01:42:17.727
But then when you get rid of it, you wanna play with other people's.

01:42:17.907 --> 01:42:31.270
I don't understand what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen, but I do know for sure that this whole concept of there being trans women that used to be men is the semantic enchantment that allows this bullshit to go out.

01:42:32.358 --> 01:42:40.785
If that semantic enchantment wasn't there and we called transitioning men trans men, this whole act wouldn't be possible.

01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:50.372
You wouldn't be able to ask a Supreme Court nominee to define what a woman is because that would be a stupid question.

01:42:52.674 --> 01:43:14.450
but by a semantic trick of calling trans men trans women and arguing that they're also real women, they now have gotten us to the point where we are willing to argue about the flag and fight for the flag that represents this concept that we should all have a firm understanding of where we are with regard to whether we like our own or other people's dicks.

01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:19.754
And if we change our mind about that in the course of our growing up, that's totally okay because you know,

01:43:23.433 --> 01:43:24.374
It's really crazy.

01:43:24.454 --> 01:43:29.218
I'm sorry to use such language, but it's important to see how ridiculous we look.

01:43:31.179 --> 01:43:39.025
It's important to see how ridiculous we look because we look this ridiculous also to our rulers.

01:43:39.626 --> 01:43:44.470
We look this ridiculous also to our elite who have us arguing about this.

01:43:49.315 --> 01:43:52.677
Did Israel and the United States obliterate Iran's nuclear program?

01:43:52.917 --> 01:43:54.098
Donald Trump says they did.

01:43:54.718 --> 01:44:00.642
Other analysts say Iran's facilities are seriously damaged, but that the story of the Iranian nuclear program is far from over.

01:44:01.162 --> 01:44:04.884
It's premature and counterproductive, they say, to claim total victory.

01:44:05.184 --> 01:44:06.185
What's the actual truth?

01:44:06.705 --> 01:44:09.727
We'll try to separate the signal from the noise next.

01:44:13.169 --> 01:44:16.050
This is Washington Week with The Atlantic.

01:44:17.148 --> 01:44:19.149
Corporate funding provided by.

01:44:19.169 --> 01:44:27.393
In 1995, two friends set out to make wireless coverage accessible to all with no long-term contracts.

01:44:28.274 --> 01:44:30.195
Good evening and welcome to Washington Week.

01:44:30.775 --> 01:44:32.936
So let's start with a little etymology.

01:44:33.417 --> 01:44:38.319
Obliterate comes from the Latin obliterare, which originally meant to blot out.

01:44:38.499 --> 01:44:42.942
OK, so I just want to watch this really quick because this is Washington Week from Friday.

01:44:44.201 --> 01:44:51.964
And I wanna just see how they take on the whole, you know, did we destroy the nuclear program of Iran?

01:44:51.984 --> 01:45:02.127
And, excuse me, what I think is most, you know, apt as a coach, I want you to pay attention to what they feel they need to reinforce.

01:45:03.048 --> 01:45:06.149
What the narrative of this show feels they need to reinforce.

01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:08.669
So where are they gonna walk the viewer?

01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:12.631
So in case everybody's not up to speed, this is how nuclear war works.

01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:15.590
And they actually do that on this program.

01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:20.692
And I want you to listen to what they do, and then I'm gonna try and talk you through what I hear.

01:45:22.253 --> 01:45:25.394
And I will just state it right off for the go.

01:45:27.255 --> 01:45:39.560
Like there are no viruses, I think saying that there are no nukes is a dangerous generalization to make, but it's a one that works in our favor.

01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:50.596
It's a dangerous generalization to make in the sense of you could in theory be wrong and then that would, you know, blow back in a way that you wouldn't want it to blow back.

01:45:50.656 --> 01:46:03.803
But on the other hand, I would say that if you're going to take a risk like and say that intramuscular injection is just plain dumb and in the end nobody can come back to you and explain why in certain cases it isn't dumb,

01:46:04.625 --> 01:46:11.309
then I think in a lot of ways saying that there are no nukes is a very similar type of challenge.

01:46:11.549 --> 01:46:13.290
It's a challenge to the rest of the world.

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:17.593
If there are nukes, it should be fairly easy for us to demonstrate it.

01:46:17.633 --> 01:46:19.474
There should be some textbooks we should buy.

01:46:19.494 --> 01:46:26.798
There should be a fairly easily understood sort of concept behind the idea of a nuclear bomb.

01:46:26.818 --> 01:46:27.879
Now, the

01:46:28.559 --> 01:46:43.265
The trick here is to understand that the illusion of a nuclear bomb, and I'm saying this as a high school physics teacher because for a while I was a high school physics teacher when I was also teaching biology and chemistry all at the same school.

01:46:44.405 --> 01:46:46.986
And yes, it was exactly as bad as you can imagine it was.

01:46:47.666 --> 01:46:53.849
I had four preps a day because I also had to teach this class for freshmen called physical science, which had the worst textbook.

01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:57.370
The idea

01:46:58.755 --> 01:47:00.298
of a fission reaction.

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.509
I'm just going to draw a picture now so that we're all on the same page, at least in the terms of what I'm thinking.

01:47:06.549 --> 01:47:08.292
You don't have to be thinking this as well.

01:47:08.312 --> 01:47:09.374
Did I not turn this on?

01:47:13.125 --> 01:47:28.623
Okay, it's gonna come out in a second so the idea of a fission reaction I'm just gonna explain it very quick and I'm not gonna draw good pictures and I'm not gonna get exact things Okay, but the idea of a fission reaction is that you have this great big atom

01:47:29.526 --> 01:47:48.532
a great big atom might be like uranium or plutonium I don't know if it's you if P is also plutonium I think it is maybe it's phosphorus and plutonium is something else probably plutonium is something else so I won't write that down but it could be you 238 for example so if it's PI okay so PI so

01:47:49.992 --> 01:48:10.887
you have this big nucleus right and the nucleus isn't very stable because it's got so many protons and neutrons and electrons and protons and neutrons have to be balanced out and there's some extra neutrons in there and so those extra neutrons are rare and so occasionally a neutron will fly out and when a neutron flies out it can hit another one of these atoms and if it does

01:48:11.607 --> 01:48:21.475
This atom could have enough energy to separate into two slightly more stable atoms and then I think this one splits into another one pretty quick.

01:48:22.355 --> 01:48:29.821
But the idea is, is that that's what you hear when you put a Geiger counter near uranium.

01:48:30.321 --> 01:48:41.090
Is that you're hearing the emission of neutrons and then this neutron can go and bounce off another atom and release another neutron and the concept

01:48:42.129 --> 01:48:52.947
of a nuclear bomb is the idea that if you put these atoms close enough to each other, meaning you made a pure enough uranium metal

01:48:54.175 --> 01:49:05.118
that the neutrons that are released by one would not spontaneously escape and hit the Geiger counter, but would more likely hit another atom.

01:49:05.158 --> 01:49:13.200
And so in the end, you'd get this chain reaction, and the whole nugget of fissile material would go boom at once.

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.160
That's the cartoon.

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:22.782
And the cartoon is based on real physics, nuclear physics, where you have radioactive material, and the nucleus is decaying.

01:49:23.496 --> 01:49:24.917
The decays are understood.

01:49:25.497 --> 01:49:27.139
The emissions are understood.

01:49:27.199 --> 01:49:32.463
But the problem is, is that like all other matter, it's really mostly space.

01:49:33.343 --> 01:49:42.390
And so when a neutron shoots out of yellow cake uranium, it doesn't hit another uranium atom and cause another uranium atom to release neutrons.

01:49:42.450 --> 01:49:48.634
And this doesn't go into a chain reaction because most of the neutrons, all of them, don't hit anything else.

01:49:48.674 --> 01:49:49.495
They just fly away.

01:49:51.294 --> 01:49:58.998
And so part of a nuclear bomb is also this concept that when the neutrons are released, you also have to have these reflectors around it.

01:50:01.419 --> 01:50:13.245
And so you'll see in designs of nuclear weapons that there are these reflectors around it, like beryllium reflectors, so that when the breaking down pure uranium releases its neutrons, that the neutrons come back down.

01:50:13.285 --> 01:50:16.266
And so once you start it, it's supposed to go boom.

01:50:16.486 --> 01:50:17.327
That's the idea.

01:50:18.356 --> 01:50:45.701
And so it's just a big cherry bomb where at the heart of it is this normal decaying reaction of an unstable atom, but then now optimized to happen in an instant because of the purity of the metal and the intricate design of the neutron reflectors and the amount of TNT that's directed on that, on this thing, you know, smashing it really hard.

01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:47.222
That's basically it.

01:50:47.702 --> 01:50:55.530
The first designs of nuclear bombs were actually a thing where, when it hit the ground, it would like compress the thing.

01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:56.751
I mean, I'm not an expert.

01:50:56.791 --> 01:51:00.815
I'm just, what I've read is what I see, and what I've read is what I can tell you.

01:51:00.855 --> 01:51:02.456
And this is the basic gist of it.

01:51:03.197 --> 01:51:07.120
That you have to make uranium pure enough so that the

01:51:08.208 --> 01:51:10.190
the chain reaction can occur.

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:19.557
And then you take that extremely pure weapons grade uranium and you put it inside of a beryllium sphere reflector and you put in all, pack in all kinds of explosives.

01:51:19.597 --> 01:51:20.618
And then I guess that's it.

01:51:21.278 --> 01:51:26.702
Just some manufacturing quirks to get done with and design quirks to decide what shape you want the missile.

01:51:27.043 --> 01:51:27.743
And then it works.

01:51:27.803 --> 01:51:29.885
That's how you, they basically tell you.

01:51:30.325 --> 01:51:36.590
So what's crazy is that it's almost what they tell you on, on,

01:51:37.931 --> 01:51:39.052
on Atlantic Week.

01:51:39.252 --> 01:51:40.733
It's Washington Week.

01:51:40.793 --> 01:51:41.514
It's really weird.

01:51:42.014 --> 01:51:43.395
Or erase letters or words.

01:51:43.875 --> 01:51:55.503
Today, the main use of the word obliterate is to describe what did or did not happen to the Fordow Underground Uranium Enrichment Plant 125 miles south of Tehran when it was bombed by the United States Air Force.

01:51:56.103 --> 01:52:07.091
For reasons we will discuss tonight, President Trump believes it very important to claim that the operation against Iran's nuclear program was an unalloyed, absolute, complete victory requiring no follow-through.

01:52:07.631 --> 01:52:12.255
The truth is, it's actually much too early to come to definitive conclusions about the damage done.

01:52:12.796 --> 01:52:23.946
The thing is, you got to kind of remember that they have depleted uranium shells, and depleted uranium is really uranium that used to be pure, and then they made it less pure, as I understand it.

01:52:24.787 --> 01:52:28.931
That was a program that we looked at the other day in the Wikipedia.

01:52:31.252 --> 01:52:38.662
And so depleted uranium shells are capable of making liquid metal that can go through, you know, plate steel of tanks and things like that.

01:52:38.782 --> 01:52:48.696
So even if you don't have an uncontrolled chain reaction where you get a flash of intense light and electromagnetic energy that can melt cities,

01:52:49.838 --> 01:52:56.186
There's no doubt that this material could be a useful incendiary, a new useful energy releaser.

01:52:56.346 --> 01:53:03.796
And if it released its energy over the course of five minutes or 10 minutes as a result of its, you know,

01:53:05.874 --> 01:53:21.618
Incorporation into a weapon that wouldn't be too far-fetched to me, but it would be in no way shape or form Opening a black hole or ripping a portal in reality Like again, you know, they say about certain they used to say about nuclear weapons that it might make a black hole or some shit

01:53:23.336 --> 01:53:33.725
Joining me tonight to discuss Trump, Netanyahu, Khamenei, and the true state of affairs in the Middle East post-attack are Shane Harris, who covers intelligence and national security for The Atlantic.

01:53:34.405 --> 01:53:37.148
David Ignatius is a columnist at The Washington Post.

01:53:37.808 --> 01:53:42.372
Andrea Mitchell is the chief Washington and foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News.

01:53:43.053 --> 01:53:45.895
And Ashley Parker covers the White House for The Atlantic.

01:53:46.872 --> 01:53:49.693
Thank you all very much for being with us tonight.

01:53:51.074 --> 01:54:01.698
David, I want to turn to you first to give an overall assessment, but let's listen to Donald Trump talk about the attack Saturday.

01:54:03.458 --> 01:54:03.918
The U.S.

01:54:03.958 --> 01:54:10.781
military carried out massive precision strikes on... What did I get wrong, Leland?

01:54:10.861 --> 01:54:15.903
Don't be afraid to put it in the chat to correct me, because I see you already are telling me that I got the...

01:54:16.721 --> 01:54:17.922
U-238 wrong.

01:54:17.942 --> 01:54:18.723
That's fine with me.

01:54:18.843 --> 01:54:24.928
I'm not claiming to be an expert, but you know that I'm describing the cartoon basically correct.

01:54:25.749 --> 01:54:26.149
I think.

01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:36.598
For 25 years, the United States, Israel, Sunni Arab states, Europe, have been warning that it's untenable to allow the Iranian regime to have nuclear weapons.

01:54:36.959 --> 01:54:39.441
They've been looking for ways to stop the program once and for all.

01:54:41.476 --> 01:54:46.191
A lot of people are secretly happy and some openly happy that Donald Trump did what he did.

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:47.695
Is there a chance?

01:54:48.871 --> 01:54:55.953
or a good chance that Donald Trump actually did the thing that for 25 years the West has wanted to see happen?

01:54:56.314 --> 01:54:56.954
Sure he did.

01:54:56.994 --> 01:55:00.015
Well, he attempted it, which is something in itself.

01:55:00.075 --> 01:55:03.536
He actually went ahead and took the strike.

01:55:04.276 --> 01:55:06.977
Ah, OK.

01:55:07.017 --> 01:55:09.478
Thank you very much for the correction on depleted uranium.

01:55:09.518 --> 01:55:14.860
So it's the shit that's left over after they enriched the 235 out, I guess.

01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:15.800
That would be what it is.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:16.340
OK.

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:17.001
That's fine.

01:55:17.201 --> 01:55:17.721
I believe that.

01:55:18.121 --> 01:55:29.632
whatever the final bomb damage assessment, it was an extraordinary use of military power halfway around the world, something that no other country could do or really even could think of doing.

01:55:29.852 --> 01:55:32.074
So I think that's a first thing to say.

01:55:32.094 --> 01:55:39.561
And it does send a message to the world about American power that will persist well beyond this strike.

01:55:39.981 --> 01:55:43.284
The reason that it matters exactly what

01:55:43.792 --> 01:55:49.154
the bomb damage was, is that that will condition what now follows.

01:55:49.674 --> 01:55:56.317
If it was obliterated for years to come, that makes it easy for Trump because the Iranian nuclear program really is gone.

01:55:56.737 --> 01:55:57.837
You don't have to worry about it.

01:55:57.977 --> 01:56:06.280
See, the weird part about that is, is the program could, at some point there were like 2000 tons of weapons grade pure uranium on earth.

01:56:07.341 --> 01:56:07.881
2000 tons.

01:56:08.601 --> 01:56:10.162
Like that's a, that's a shitload.

01:56:11.351 --> 01:56:20.473
And so the way that it's made, as far as I understand, is a pretty complicated, costly process where they're separating one isotope from another.

01:56:21.153 --> 01:56:25.794
And the centrifuges are gas centrifuges, and they're not very high efficiency.

01:56:26.654 --> 01:56:34.396
And so the question is, number one, how much enriched uranium did they have?

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:41.038
And number two, how much are they capable of making in X timeframe?

01:56:41.598 --> 01:56:43.399
Because those are two completely different things.

01:56:43.459 --> 01:57:01.128
If they have enough depleted, sorry, if they have enough enriched uranium in 17 different locations in Iran, under storage, ready to go whenever they need, then the centrifuges being destroyed don't matter at all once they have enough for like as many bombs as anybody would ever want.

01:57:02.483 --> 01:57:09.006
America doesn't have to continually enrich uranium anymore because we took a bunch from the Russians.

01:57:09.066 --> 01:57:13.248
We have so much from the time when we were doing it.

01:57:13.308 --> 01:57:14.829
We don't know what to do with it all.

01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:20.291
We had to convert some of it from the purest form to a lesser grade.

01:57:20.712 --> 01:57:23.913
We had to go backwards in order to make the world safer.

01:57:27.415 --> 01:57:31.677
So if they already have more than they will ever need, the

01:57:32.398 --> 01:57:34.660
program doesn't need to exist anymore.

01:57:35.361 --> 01:57:46.251
The program is irrelevant unless they're enriching it for other people, unless they're selling it to other people, unless they have more uranium than other people have and so it's not fair that they get to make so much.

01:57:46.731 --> 01:57:47.732
Then it would be different.

01:57:50.037 --> 01:57:51.598
follow-on negotiations.

01:57:51.658 --> 01:57:54.321
You don't have to worry about removal of equipment.

01:57:55.162 --> 01:57:57.083
You don't have to worry about a whole series of issues.

01:57:57.103 --> 01:58:00.746
You don't have to think about how you enforce an agreement, because you don't need an agreement.

01:58:00.786 --> 01:58:01.627
It's obliterated.

01:58:02.228 --> 01:58:14.478
But if it's short of that, and the evidence is it is something short of totally obliterated, then a series of questions arise about how you'll make sure that Iran never gets that nuclear weapon.

01:58:15.503 --> 01:58:21.189
will have much more desire to have one now after this war, even than it did before.

01:58:21.829 --> 01:58:23.451
So that's why these questions matter.

01:58:23.711 --> 01:58:25.833
And we're just at the beginning of this.

01:58:26.634 --> 01:58:34.322
For Trump to treat this as a matter of semantics, and I must say, for some in the media to do the same, really misses the point.

01:58:34.342 --> 01:58:38.706
This is about the future, how much destruction of the program happened.

01:58:38.846 --> 01:58:42.187
Shane, maybe you can just walk through this for a minute.

01:58:42.507 --> 01:58:50.609
Give us the granular look at the state of the Iranian nuclear program now, based on the initial battle damage assessment.

01:58:50.749 --> 01:58:51.009
Yeah.

01:58:51.029 --> 01:58:53.710
So it's important to keep two things in mind when talking about this.

01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:59.112
There is the highly enriched uranium, which is the core ingredient that you need to create the weapon.

01:58:59.952 --> 01:59:03.613
There is some question about whether those stockpiles have now been removed and secreted somewhere.

01:59:04.073 --> 01:59:09.915
And then there are the centrifuges, which you need to enrich that uranium to its state where it can be a bomb.

01:59:10.335 --> 01:59:14.336
So the places where Iran was enriching that we know are heavily damaged.

01:59:14.436 --> 01:59:16.237
Forget, you know, obliterate, totally obliterate.

01:59:16.297 --> 01:59:17.117
It's not binary.

01:59:17.577 --> 01:59:18.657
Significant damage done to them.

01:59:18.777 --> 01:59:20.738
Fordow was the one that buried underneath the mountain.

01:59:20.838 --> 01:59:22.158
Maybe a little bit harder to tell.

01:59:22.578 --> 01:59:24.379
Natanz is the other major facility.

01:59:24.439 --> 01:59:26.320
The Israelis had been hitting that as well.

01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:28.540
That's got more visible damage around it.

01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:30.861
And the IAEA, the international inspectors,

01:59:31.622 --> 01:59:31.902
a test

01:59:48.419 --> 01:59:49.960
have sustained some serious damage.

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:59.303
The question now is, can Iran take that 408 kilograms, about nearly half a ton of highly enriched uranium, and get that into centrifuges?

01:59:59.443 --> 02:00:01.504
Are those centrifuges up and running somewhere?

02:00:01.904 --> 02:00:04.645
Are they stored somewhere where they could be put into use?

02:00:05.005 --> 02:00:07.726
These are kind of the really next key tactical questions.

02:00:07.986 --> 02:00:14.168
And so now we're talking about the different grades of enriched uranium, and it sounds like they didn't have any of the pure

02:00:14.728 --> 02:00:17.972
weapons-grade uranium yet, or at least that's the story we're telling.

02:00:18.493 --> 02:00:21.616
And that's a remarkable level of certainty to have.

02:00:22.717 --> 02:00:24.980
It's a remarkable level of certainty to have.

02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:31.913
And the Israelis in the United States will be watching that very closely to see if there's activity related to that.

02:00:32.253 --> 02:00:35.014
But these key components in these facilities that the U.S.

02:00:35.034 --> 02:00:41.097
and the Israelis have been striking have obviously been damaged and will create an impediment for some time.

02:00:41.237 --> 02:00:45.640
How long it would take Israel to rebuild this is the thing that people are debating, right?

02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:46.680
He said Israel.

02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:50.042
Andrea, what's your assessment?

02:00:51.434 --> 02:01:05.490
According to European intelligence, according to the IAEA and others, that some of it was moved to other locations, and not necessarily to Isfahan and Natanz, but to other undisclosed locations, which is one of the big issues.

02:01:06.230 --> 02:01:10.614
What Iran has never explained is why it needed to enrich to 60 percent.

02:01:10.654 --> 02:01:12.235
That is just below weapons grade.

02:01:12.715 --> 02:01:14.317
It then has to go through several steps.

02:01:14.397 --> 02:01:24.404
And that's why the breakout time was for a nuclear capability, but not a weapon, because they still have to turn this enriched uranium.

02:01:24.444 --> 02:01:32.651
Are we really to believe that she has read in well enough to speak so expertly about the various stages of uranium enrichment?

02:01:33.572 --> 02:01:33.932
Really?

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:35.293
Really?

02:01:37.697 --> 02:01:42.759
uranium into small metallic pellets, if you will.

02:01:42.959 --> 02:01:49.122
It then has to be weaponized and miniaturized into a warhead, unless it's going to be some sort of a dirty bomb.

02:01:49.322 --> 02:01:50.562
So there were still other steps.

02:01:50.882 --> 02:01:57.305
But it was not anything that they would have needed for a civilian program, which is what they claimed they needed.

02:01:57.825 --> 02:01:58.986
And so they were vulnerable.

02:01:59.506 --> 02:02:01.367
And the issue now is,

02:02:02.687 --> 02:02:09.371
Is Israel going to go back in on whatever pretext if they feel that this has not been completely destroyed?

02:02:09.851 --> 02:02:12.933
Well, the other question is, would Donald Trump go back in?

02:02:12.953 --> 02:02:16.295
I mean, there is Trump.

02:02:16.535 --> 02:02:24.380
These are not relevant questions, of course, but these are the questions that these people have been scripted to ask, and their answers are scripted as well.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.422
There's possible solutions, possible directions are all scripted as well.

02:02:29.942 --> 02:02:33.004
It's no possible way for any other explanation to be the case.

02:02:33.084 --> 02:02:33.904
They are idiots.

02:02:33.944 --> 02:02:37.486
There are a lot of idiots out there, but they are scripted idiots.

02:02:37.586 --> 02:02:45.529
In fact, on June 13th, it was not at all predicted that he would go in when the Israelis first did.

02:02:45.549 --> 02:02:53.273
There was considerable pressure from the Saudis and others in the Gulf not to do this on him.

02:02:54.273 --> 02:02:56.515
and to try to come up with some other result.

02:02:57.195 --> 02:03:10.463
And in fact, my own interpretation, and I defer to Ashley, who has covered him far longer and more intensively, is he saw the success of the Israeli operation, which was remarkable.

02:03:11.003 --> 02:03:21.250
You know, the air defenses were gone, they went in, they developed air superiority, soon it became... And they assassinated most of the military leadership within the same hour frame.

02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:22.991
Military and political leadership.

02:03:24.712 --> 02:03:30.956
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been Gigaohm Biological, a high resistance, low noise information brief brought to you by a biologist.

02:03:30.996 --> 02:03:35.899
Intramuscular injection of any combination of substances with the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.

02:03:36.439 --> 02:03:40.362
And Brandy Vaughn and Tony Bark were telling you that before they were killed.

02:03:41.162 --> 02:03:44.644
And Suzanne Humphries was saying it at that time, but doesn't say it anymore.

02:03:44.704 --> 02:03:46.545
And that's because she's a scripted traitor.

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:54.688
Just like Claire Craig is a scripted traitor who's very happy that NIH has finally decided to collect all the DNA from all the babies.

02:03:55.189 --> 02:04:01.892
She's on this paper along with Norman Fenton and Tess Laurie and Robert Malone and Jessica Rose and Harvey Reich.

02:04:02.732 --> 02:04:11.041
